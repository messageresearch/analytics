TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I'm continuing on the subject of the house of the Lord and I'm going to uh maybe over the next couple Services back up a little bit to go over some things on the house of the Lord and but our this new sub series that we've started within the context of the house of the Lord to address the same themes and principles that we've been looking at from the beginning is when the young on don't grow up so this is We ministered on it Wednesday night uh as a warning to those who are here Wednesday night I feel led to revisit some of those very same principles to share a lot of the same scriptures hopefully just add a little bit more body to it so there will be maybe in the second half of this sermon uh some addressing what we ministered on Wednesday night uh but in this theme of uh when the youngans don't grow up there's a thought that's in that that I really hope to just reinforce again today and then at the beginning I want to touch on the theme of the purpose of the house of the Lord as we've looked at that already and that the house of the Lord in the beginning whether it was the Tabernacle in the wilderness the temple that was built by Solomon and the subsequent uh rebuilding that there was a vision that God had for it it was made even in the Book of Revelation the the Tabernacle of the temple is opened up and they see into heaven so it represented something Eternal and what was placed upon Earth was patterned after what was in heaven and so there was meaning behind it uh there was a goal it was to speak of something and as we've been using the thought of the house of Lord to relate to us as individuals how that our hearts are to become a home for Christ and what those implications are and how that our homes our families are to be a type of the house of the Lord and it's to uh it's to Harbor God's presence and hold uh virtues and then that also speaks to the church how the church itself is the house of the Lord and we say I was glad when they s to me let us go to the house of the Lord and we weren't talking about going over to um somebody else's house or going to um visit an individual but we're talking about church and so this theme of the house of the Lord has application on every level as far as individually group family and then as a church and that vision and goal this is maybe my thesis statement for this whole uh thought on when youngans don't grow up is the goal for the individual should be maturity the goal for a family is maturity to cultivate character that as we begin to as we fall in love as a couple and we get married and when I say us I'm referring to a sister Elizabeth and I but as you fall in love what you want is that that love that you have for each other to mature to become all that it can be and if God blesses that Union with children and as you begin to raise up children your goal for your children should be maturity I want to raise them up uh I hope it's okay to say this but here brother martin and sister pear are putting prayer requests in for their adult sons for them to find good jobs why it's in the heart of a parent to see their child succeed and to even uh integrate appropriately into society and have character and integrity and and know how to do things honestly and work hard and then start the process all over again with their own family and their own uh wives and and spouses and then for the the goal for a church is not to have fun church services true and if any of you are thinking oh well that explains it uh I apologize but the goal the goal of church is maturity for the Believers to to uh God has equipped you by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and if he hasn't if you haven't come to that the goal of church is to bring you to a birth to cultivate that to Pro provide opportunities with the word of God to to be changed and then to continue to support and resource and equip those who've been born again and those who are individuals and those who are raising families to fulfill their purpose and goal individually and in their home life and so that's the goal of a church is maturity and I think a lot of this could just be summed up with the term character and I know that comes up quite a bit uh in our vision with this church is character but I believe that's at the heart of it is to have character and so that's the thesis behind when youngans don't grow up is there's a goal for this and it's maturity now Luke chapter 10: 21 I hope just to take off from here in that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit and said I thank thee oh Father Lord of Heaven and Earth and here's this designation of father says that thou Hast hid these things from the wise in prudent and H has revealed them unto babes even so father for so it seemed good in thy sight so it seeming good in his sight it means this is the way God planned it this is the way God intends it and God intending to do it he has a purpose and a reason for not taking the wise and prudent and enlightening them but beginning with these babes and revealing truths to babes and these babes are those that can learn you find in that phrasing of the scripture that to be a babe it's speaking of one that can grow that can be taught that can be trained that can be disciplined and it's certainly contrasted with the idea of the wise and prudent uh because they uh they already know they have an answer to everything when you tell them that this is the right way they go yeah you know but I've got my own way and so Jesus is saying he's hid certain things from the wise and prudent have it all figured out uh they've already learned they've already been trained and let me just say in the natural that when one is wise and prudent in the natural then they are those and I and and I I'm not saying this disparagingly but the wise and prudent are ones that would teach that if there was a need and something need to be expounded upon the wise and prudent in a particular area would be the ones to teach those who aren't experienced who are unskilled and untaught so it tells us that he reveals things to those who can be taught those who are are green or those that are new and they can be trained but as the father has Des designed it that the wise and prudent the the elders the the grown a and the teachers are not being trained and taught in new things but that babes that we're to become babes or he Likens it God's plan to revealing truth to babes let me say this the goal is not to have a nursery the goal is not to run a daycare so it's babes that will learn in 1 Peter chapter 1 vers 23 Peter says being born again not of corruptible seed so it's not the natural birth but born again of Incorruptible by the word of God which liveth and abideth forever Peter says that we have been born again by Incorruptible seed which is the word of God and this word of God liveth and it abideth forever so it's active it's working it's it's alive and it's something that we have been born again by so Peter's wanting to use a language to say that you that have been born by corruptible seed in the flesh have experienced the process of birth development physically and mentally and emotionally to a place to where you have grown up as an adult and you come into adulthood and yet you ultimately die so there's this life to the seed that it runs its cycle and he's wanting to bring that into view and then say but then there's this Incorruptible seed that liveth and abideth forever that's going to follow a similar trajectory but it never ends in death it has a coming to Perfection and forever remaining so scripturally then we could say that we being born again we begin in type as babes infants in the body of Christ and Jesus say is saying that God hides spiritual truths Revelation from the learned the grown the adults the mature in in a natural sense and educational sense and reveals them to babes that can learn that can be taught though unskilled you can cultivate skill so Peter visits this in Chapter 2 veres 1 to3 of his first letter wherefore laying aside all malice and all guile and hypocrisies and envies and all evil speakings so there is this laying aside of natural things and I think there's a way that we could point out that malice and guile and hypocrisies and envies and evil speakings would be characteristic of adolescence immaturity juvenile behavior and says as newborn babes do desire the sincere milk of the word of God when we observe two children or the toddlers playing uh and one has a toy and there's only one of them and the other one doesn't have it we observe that it's natural for them to be envious and to want and to not share and we're always working with them share and do this and do that and it's a constant cultivation of that child's attitude and perception and the way that they work with other people and Peter is saying the same thing now lay aside malice G hypocrisy envies and evil speakings as a babe in Christ desire the sincere milk sincere milk of the word so now it's very explicit being newborn babes by The Incorruptible seed of the word of God which liveth and abideth forever you should be Desiring the sincere milk of the word yes now why are we Desiring milk he's using the example of how that babes would be would draw from the breast and they would drink the mother's milk and this is what they're eating uh I haven't ever heard it before but no matter how much we might like meat and potatoes when our babies are born the dad's not over there saying son I got this filet perfectly rare and and seasoned just perfectly and reverse seared and he doesn't give it to his boy he's a he's the first son of the mcari family we love steak and you don't feed them steak probably going to kill them right there's a have to wait until they grow but then there's even a point where if if you continue to only give them milk they will not properly develop can even rot their teeth out and they won't develop they won't learn certain things with their tongue and their mouths and their digestive system so there's a transition in a way Peter's looking at that exact scenario it says as newborn babes desire the milk so that you can grow thereby if so be that you've tasted that the Lord is gracious if you have indeed been born again by The Incorruptible seed The Incorruptible seed then you can as a babe reach out for the appropriate nutrients and nurture in order to grow to increase so there is a process here of laying down the wrong things as Paul would say putting off the old man and putting on the new man which is made after a different order and a different Spirit a process of laying down and then reaching out after you've been born again once we've been born again we're not put on a shelf and you're good you're perfect you're a trophy and then it's just a on a mission to go out and finally save the last one for all of us who are perfect on the Shelf can finally get out of here but it is a process then of beginning in Christ and growing and reaching forth and Desiring the word of God to grow and then mature and hopefully in growing you can go from milk to meat so Jesus is saying in Luke chapter 10 that he trains as he reveals it to babes such as would learn he trains these newly born believers who are seeking God's Will and purpose who are reaching forth for the right things Desiring the sincere milk of the word who are reaching for God's purpose and intended outcome and I say this and hope to be able to prove it by scripture and actually and knowing that I don't need to prove it because you're all well learned and understand the word of God but I'd like to say it this way that God's purpose for the babes God's purpose for his children as a father is emotional and spiritual maturity if you are in fact a son God's not obsessing about the state of your soul you're his nothing can change that and he's never going to banish a child of his to hell so it is then the continual concern of a parent to say to see and to cultivate the right kind of character and that one way of putting it is emotional and spiritual maturity is God's will for his children brother banam says God's will for us is perfection right God's will for us is perfection and that Perfection is patience all right it's a patience is emotional regulation patience is a subjection of the flesh to the truth yes patience is is is subjecting the mind and the body to the promise of God that says it will be in not getting impatient and trying to make it happen ourselves so patience is has to do with emotional regulation waiting on God and waiting for God this is the proc process of character development we are all developmental stage companies companies are a person legally and I had a lawyer friend one time said he just carried Company charters in his seat to say well according to the law a company is a person and so I can drive in the HOV lane as long as I have company files in the car we'll try that out but God's will is perfection that's going to be a theme today is this this phrasing of perfection now if you turn to numbers chap 18 I'd like to read verses 1 to 7 I'd like just to read it to enter it into our record this morning as we're talking about the house of the Lord because the house of the Lord testifies of this plan of perfection or maybe we could put it another way Redemption through Jesus Christ the temple and the Tabernacle itself speaking of Christ and then this purpose of Christ the three-fold purpose of Christ and what God intends to do uh through Jesus Christ in his body and I want you to catch this theme in the original house of the Lord whether it be the Tabernacle in the wilderness or the temple in verse one and the Lord said unto Aaron thou and thy sons and thy father's house with thee shall bear the iniquity of the sanctuary and thou of thy Sons with thee shall bear the iniquity of your priesthood so there was a burden for them to address sin in in the family in the tribe within the priesthood and within Levites and the there was a process they had to go through to sanctify themselves for service and thy Brethren also the tribe of Levi the tribe of thy father bring thou with thee that they may be joined unto thee and Minister unto thee but thou and thy Sons with thee shall Minister before the Tabernacle of witness it's this phrasing that I was really keying in on that the Tabernacle of witness means it is this tent of testimony that declared God's presence with the the people and it was foreshadowing God's Perfection that and all the elements even of an outer Court an inner court and a holy of holies and then the different stages as we looked at and even the erecting of that outward tent that God began to immediately identify himself in there in that most holy place that it's all speaking and types and shadows of greater things to come and so it's a tabernacle of witness of the presence of God and the purpose of the presence of God among his people and they shall keep thy charge and the charge of all the Tabernacle only they shall not come nigh the vessels of the sanctuary and the altar that neither they nor ye also die so now there's this division of services where just because you were a levite didn't mean you were a priest but you still had a place within the house of God to do service there's a lot of types you could use to that but now he's saying that these Levites of the tribe of your father will serve in various capacities but they have these areas within the house that they serve and they can't intrude on the office of the actual priesthood and they shall be joined unto thee and keep the charge of the Tabernacle of the congregation for all the service of the Tabernacle each one has a purpose each one has a duty to serve the greater good of the people or all the people all the body of Israel but then also to serve those that are doing things that they cannot do and the stranger shall not come nigh unto you and you shall keep the charge of the sanctuary and the charge of the altar that there be no wrath anymore upon the children of Israel in other words there was things that children of Israel must observe to keep God's Wrath and they would do service in the Tabernacle in order to preserve that themselves and behold I have taken your brethren the Levites from among the children of Israel to you they are given as a gift for the Lord to do the service of the Tabernacle of the congregation therefore thou and thy Sons with thee shalt keep your priest office for everything of the Altar and within the veil and you shall serve I've given your priest office unto you as a service of gift and the Strang that come n shall be put to death these are very strong words uh in terms of the consequences of not abiding by this and just anyone intruding on it but the overall picture I want you to see is this Tabernacle of witness this tent of testimony set amongst the people where they would all Orient themselves as tribes on each side to that Tabernacle and as this focal point of their journey and their Exodus it would then be forever uh it would be memorialized in the temple that is built in Jerusalem but it was to it had a purpose it had it served an intent then present but also foreshadowing God's Perfection Paul takes it and breaks it down in the book of Hebrews and I know that even Timothy it's attributed to him as having written the book of Hebrews and and so whether Timothy wrote it uh on behalf of Paul uh I I'm ascribing the authorship to Paul in Hebrews chapter 9: 6 6 to 10 says now when these things were thus ordained and numbers 18 is just a snippet of this ordination we could see that here so the purpose of reading that was to have this reference point of this Old Testament ordination when they were thus ordained the priest went always into the first Tabernacle now the language here can be a little bit uh not not confusing but just a little bit misleading in the sense that the first Tabernacle does not refer to the first time erected the tent but it's the inner court or the holy place and accomplishing the service of God so priest could go in there all the time to this court in the Holy place and there was things that had to be done and things that had to be administered on a daily basis but into the second the second Tabernacle or the most holy place the holiest of holies there where the Ark of the Covenant was where The Mercy Seat was the place that God said he would commune you familiar with all those different concepts only the high priest the second went the high priest alone once a year not without blood which he offered for himself and for The Heirs of the people so there was this process that the high priest once a year on the day of atonement would sanctify himself and for the people and then go into enter in behind the veil and offer up and sprinkle this Blood once a year on the day of atonement uh come in behind that Veil into the most holy place the holiest of holies and offer this sacrifice or to present the blood upon the Altar and he did this once a year but then daily in the inner Court things are always happening and then you also had the outer Court where there were other services done now verse eight tells us the Holy Ghost this signifying that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest while as the first Tabernacle was yet standing so it was showing that once a year only one could enter and testified every year it testified nobody has been made whole to be able to go in there even the high priest himself ran the risk of death if he hadn't atoned properly hadn't washed properly and dressed properly and followed the word of God so the Holy Ghost was testifying then that a way into the holiest of holies had not been consecrated for all and as long as that first Tabernacle was yet standing and in service and active this was this the continual testimony verse 9 says that I think even more plainly which was a figure for the time then present and other words at the time it meant this it was a parable of this it was an analogy it was a type which was a type at that time in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices that could not make him that did the service perfect as pertaining to the conscience the very way in which the temple was ad ad ministered and the sacrifices repeated was signifying at that time that in those gifts and sacrifices they could not make the one who performed them perfect as pertaining to the conscience now catch this in this house of the Lord there was a lot of gifts a lot of service a lot of function a lot of things being done in the house of the Lord that were all right and all correct and according to ordination but there was no perfection in those things as pertaining to the conscience this conscience covers the heart and mind of a man and so not only could I think this will become clear as we go forward not only could that blood and those gifts and those offerings perfect the soul but it could not uh it could not unburden couldn't unburden the soul from sin nor could it purify the mind and heart completely that the conscience was still condemned and the man still had consciousness of sin because it's only a type and it had to be continually done says which stood only in meats and drinks and diverse Washings and carnal ordinances opposed on them until the time of reformation so if we look at this kind of as a whole that the the function of the house of the Lord and those who did the service were standing as a parable or signifying first that the worshipper and those that did the service and the conre conation could not be made perfect in other words th those things could not add what was lacking to render it whole that to be perfect it's complete and so this worship was in part it lacked something in wasn't the Perfection that God wanted to signify if all God wanted was worship it was in that house if all God wanted was praise it was in that house if all God wanted was to make his presence known and you feel it it was in that house but there was something in in it and it pointed to that time of reformation or the restoration of it all the proper order and the way things ought to be so Hebrews 9 again verse 11 says but Christ being come a high priest of good things to come by a greater and more perfect Tabernacle now you see how he's just transitioned Christ who himself represents a greater and more perfect Tabernacle and a high priest of good things to come a tabernacle more perfect that means a That Word Perfect there is full grown the word there is even speaking of one of his full age an adult or mature not made with hands that is to say not of this building neither by the blood of goats and calves but by his own blood he entered in the in once into the holy Place having obtained Eternal Redemption for us what beautiful poetry what a beautiful image how Christ ascended up into heaven as a high priest to present the blood to present the sacrifice as the high priest did once a year Christ does it one time once and for all there no there's no more need of for a sacrifice for the remission of sin there's no more need for anyone to shed blood to atone for sin and and some cultures they actually require uh stoning and the shedding of blood to atone for sin still why because you reject it's a rejection of the atonement in Christ for if the blood so he by his own blood entered in once in the Holy Place having obtained Eternal Redemption for us for if the blood of bulls and goats and the ashes of a hepher sprinkling unclean sanctify to the purifying of the flesh this is in those that did service these temporary sanctification for service a and what it did uh to keep the service of the house of the Lord going how much more shall the blood of Christ what a greater thing a greater and more perfect Tabernacle how if if the blood of bulls and goats accomplished that how much more how much more the blood of Christ who through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to God how much more can it Purge your conscience from dead Works to serve the Living God this very language to serve the Living God was typed by the Levites typed by the priesthood to do service in the house of the Lord to do service unto God how much more would it be able to purge your conf conscience if the original service in the Tabernacle could not make him that did the service perfect pertaining to his conscience his mind and his heart how much more now since the soul has been atoned for can Christ the blood of Christ through his eternal spirit Purge your mind and your heart from dead Works to serve the Living God how much more ought we be to be able to lay aside all malice all guile all hypocrisies and envies and evil speakings and grow in the word of God God to become Perfect by this greater and more perfect offering in Tabernacle so backing up to Hebrews chap 7: 11-19 Paul had said it this way if therefore Perfection Perfection here is a different conjugation of that underlined word perfect which is uh complete mature fully grown this Perfection here means the Fulfillment of purpose or the accomplishment of purpose Pur coming from that word perfect meaning to be mature or complete if therefore Perfection were by the levitical priesthood for under it the people received the law what further need was there that another priest should rise after the order of MDC and not be called after the order of Aaron what a great question if the Perfection required by God could be achieved under those natural disciplines and uh uh works of the Flesh and and bodily exercise and in that service if you could obtain to it why would the Messiah need to come and I know it's a question it's like well nobody's asking that question but it's good to think about the fact that Paul supposes it for us to think more deeply about Christ and what his purpose was for the priesthood being changed there is made a necessity of change also of the law for he of whom these things were spoken pertaineth to another tribe of which no man gave attendance at the altar for it is evident that our Lord sprang out of Judah of which Tri Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood now this is good stuff this is a stuff for ministers meetings if we were all uh Jewish rabbis right like and you're going to be receiving the message and you're going to be changing out of this old denominational order and coming to Christ then you start working on these difficult questions of how could he be a priest if he's of the tribe of Judah and not after the order of Aaron and it is yet far more evident for after that after the similitude of MZ there ariseth another priest speaking of Christ who is made not after the law of a carnal commandment it's numbers 18 and the law of a carnal Commandment that perpetuated the priesthood because the high priest died and the law made way so that a new one would rise up a law preserved the sanctification of the priesthood it made sure that those that did offerings and service were cleansed and it made sure there was always one to replace if one fell and one died and and one went another way that was a law of a carnal Commandment that preserved it carnally through another seed another son another son but this mzc this Messiah this priest was made after the power of an endless life Hallelujah you then are made after the power of an endless life if you're just going to be a cultured Christian or a cultured message believer then you are made after the law of a carnal commandment but you must be born again after the power of an endless life the never stop stop s never quits this power of an endless life is the word of God which liveth and abideth forever for he testified thou art a priest Forever After the order of MDC for there is verily a disannulling of the Commandment going before the weak going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof for the law made nothing perfect but the bringing in of a better hope did what's this better hope he said it's Christ who's become a high priest of good things to come a greater and more perfect Tabernacle the things that these elements and these services and this priesthood suggested and pointed to and uh in were parable of the bringing of a better hope did by the which by which we draw nigh unto God it's through this better hope it's through this more perfect Tabernacle that we draw nigh unto God doesn't say that we are become God we draw nigh that we could say The God Who is the becoming God is now living in us for us to become more like him Hebrews chapter 10 visits a very similar theme for the law having a shadow of good things to come I think that just marries perfectly with verse 19 of chapter 7 the law made nothing perfect made nothing mature made nothing complete it was in part it it brought nothing to Perfection it never completely fulfilled the purpose that God had for his people because if it did we wouldn't have needed Christ if it could have been done through Worship in the original Temple we would all as the elect of God be Jews and we would be going to Jerusalem three times a year and we would be doing everything we could in whether it be through the traditional Orthodoxy through learning through achieving that Perfection under the law if it were so but God had ordained another priesthood he'll uh if it I can say there hid the mystery of mzc go into the book of Hebrews and how much more he wanted to expound and then does expound upon melz because it spoke of this great mystery to those who would be feeding on the word of God and it testified of greater things he's saying it was hid in this priest Forever After the order of mzc that there would become there would come a nation of Kings and Priests who would offer spiritual sacrifices therefore we understand that it could not be achieved under that Division and that order but under a new order to be new creatures in Christ Jesus the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of the things the law can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers there unto perfect cannot make them complete could not make them mature religious service does not perfect a Believer right religious function and bodily activity and uh whatever anything of the flesh a law of the carnal commandment I'd even like for you to in your mind revisit how on the subject of Liberty when something becomes a must it is the human nature to be able to create a checklist and we have a to-do list so if we could do all the things on our to-do list at the end of the day we could go to bed saying I had a good day right today was a good day I did everything on the list and on the list was wake up get dressed take a shower right because you want to check things off right you want to be able to say you did something and and that's that's the human nature is to be able to have a law of a carnal commandment to be able to say I made it and so there's a things that become an ought to and a must in order to appease that uh fig Leaf religion that I'm covering myself but Paul is emphasizing over and over again no these cannot make the worshipper perfect for then would they not have ceased to be offered because that the worshippers once purged should have had had no more conscience of sins but in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sin every year what's the conscience pertain to again the mind the heart the intellect and the emotion yes it's all in that regulated that area of the Mind conscience memory reason affection uh the for it is not possible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sins wherefore when he cometh into the world he saith sacrifice and offerings thou wouldest not but a body hast thou prepared me Prophecy of the Messiah in burnt offerings in sacrifices for sin thou Hast had no pleasure then said I lo I come to do thy will oh God so this parenthetical phrase lo I come and the parenthesis says in the volume of the book it is written of me so he's not saying lo I come in the volume of the book he's saying lo I come and it's been prophesied of me in the in the Old Testament in the Psalms I come to do thy will oh God I'm not coming just to offer sacrifices because obedience is better than sacrifice I'm not is coming to perform religious service because doing the will of God many will come to me that that day and say we've done a lot of neat things have you seen our Bucket List have you seen our to-do list have you seen all the good things we've done all the Miracles all the signs and wonders he like there's something you left out my will he that doeth the will of God lo I come for a singular purpose to do thy will oh God above when he said sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and offering for sin thou wouldest not neither hath pleasure therein which are offered by the law then said he is just kind of repeating it again I come to do thy will oh God he taketh away the first that he may establish the second by the which will we are Sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all and every priest standeth daily ministering and offering often times the same sacrifices which can never take away sins but this man I hope you can just see the image as he as the writer Paints the picture but this man after he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever sat down on the right hand of God not doing what these got daily ministering and offering often times the same sacrifices over and over and over again because it never made anything perfect the soul the mind the body none of it though there was a temporary sanctification and purifying of the flesh for those that did service says but this man after he had offered one sacrif for sins forever sat down on the right hand of God from henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his foot stol for by one offering he hath perfected forever them that are Sanctified there's the purpose the perfecting forever whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us so our the soul if you have been Sanctified he has perfected you forever it's the condition the abiding condition of the Soul wherefore the Holy Ghost is a witness to us this is a I think this is a critical part to recognize that though the soul is made perfect through this regeneration of the baptism of the Holy Ghost we need a witness to remind us of this this is the Covenant that I will make with them after those days sayith the Lord I will put my laws into their hearts and in their minds will I write them and we say thank you Lord and their sins and iniquities will I remember no more he who the son has set free is free indeed where the spirit of the Lord there is Liberty Liberty unburdened should I say from what has been I won't do it but there is there's this unburdening of the soul from sin and now I'm free to become I'm free to be what God wants me to be I don't have to go back to the law I'm not made perfect by the flesh but he has written his law in my heart it's the word of God which liveth and abideth forever in my Minds this word can have preeminence and my sins and iniquities will no longer restrain me and the Holy Ghost testifies this continually to us aren't you grateful as Sons and Daughters of God that when you make mistakes that what the word of God wants to bring us back to is not the law but his promise that your sins and your iniquities will I remember no more and this L to see an age of darkness and filth and perversion and how much he attacks us let us not use justification as a an excuse to stay in sin but let us use it as an opportunity to be renewed and to leave it behind to lay it aside to be burdened from it to no longer be stained by it and grow in Grace and increase in the knowledge of the son of Goden for by one offering he ha perfected Forever This Perfection of the soul is the initial work of the Holy Ghost the law could never do this it was impossible for the law to do that and to those that are born again and those who have become babes in Christ as you would read in Hebrews 5 he says in verse one of chapter 6 therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ now if it's the principles of the doctrine of Christ when he says leaving them he doesn't mean forsaking them disregarding them counting them as nothing these are foundational principles upon which everything else would be built but it means we're building God does not pour a foundation and say this is beautiful this is my home this is where I want to live the foundation of Faith speaks that there's going to be a structure that he has all the materials for Amen to make you a Dwelling Place the stature God does not have a nursery could you just imagine if heaven was like a nursery it was just screaming babies all the time and and that's what the Angels had to do or that's what the Old Testament Believers had to do is change our diapers and bottle feed us whatever they do in heaven right streets of gold or it's Cribs of gold strollers of gold on streets of gold God does not birth you as a babe a and gooo gag G you know crying and blabbering and all the little things that a baby does and he's like you're just perfect yes you are you're just perfect you look just like your daddy right it's not that's not what he does he says let us go on unto Perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of Faith toward god of the doctrine of baptisms water and even the pouring out of the spirit and of laying on of hands and of resurrection of the dead and of Eternal judgment he's covered all the foundational things for in the Covenant there is salvation in the Covenant there is Divine Healing in the Covenant are are these baptisms and laying on of hands and the and the gifts of the Spirit and he says and this will we do if God permit Perfection is God's will Perfection is what God allows what God must permit he's speaking of not just a faith but a perfect Faith let us go on unto Perfection that word there tootes is the finisher it is a perfector and so will God permit us to go on unto the perfect one will he permit us to no longer be babes will he allow us in nurture Us by the nature that he's put inside of us in the nurture of the word of God will he allow our faith to be raised to Perfection that it might come to the highest example of faith and achieve the ultimate Perfection that Faith stands for and sees and believes in that faith is the very evidence of that faith is the very substance of the things hoped for that Christ himself spoke of because the it brings what Christ does is it brings in that of a better hope which faith is the evidence of this Perfection that's right Hallelujah so it's not a question of sin but a question of growth for God would not want us to always be under the burden and the shadow of sin that if our hearts condemn us we would know that God is greater than our hearts and knows all things and he knows nothing of your sin yes and that our Soul's being unburdened from the penalty of sin and our soul not able to be condemned to death nor is our soul ever able to be judged again we can now be free in him to become what he wants us to be so he wants to settle the sin question but in settling the sin question he has not fulfilled his ultimate purpose and goal for the Plan of Redemption Paul even visits the same thing when he's writing in Hebrews he goes they without us could not be made perfect in other words Perfection was not achieved under the law nor was Perfection achieved you got to hold on this we're talking about accomplishment fulfillment of ultimate purpose nor was full Perfection achieved on the day of Pentecost it was the start of what God was looking to achieve all along to have a body that would be his church that would be his bride that would be his own so this Tabernacle spoke of the purifying and cleansing of the soul forever from sin but then the Holy Ghost testifies about growth the maturity and fulfilling purpose to the highest example of Faith to the perfector the perfect one in Hebrews 13: 17 to 21 we'll just read to verse 21 obey them that have the rule over you and submit yourselves for they watch for your souls as they must give account that they may do it with joy and not with grief for that is unprofitable for you there will be a day in which the Believers the children of God will stand before him to before the be of the Judgment seat of Christ not to be judged for sin but our works to be judged for rewards cannot be banished to hell and so in that image that we will all have to give an account every man will give an account and those who have stewardship will give account for those they were stewards over and they will give a report and let them do it with joy and not grief because that would be unprofitable for you telling even the Born Again Believers to obey them that have rule over you those that watch over you pray for us for We Trust we have a good conscience in all things willing to live honestly but iech you to rather do this that I may be restored to you sooner now the God of Peace that brought again from the dead our lord Jesus that great Shepherd of the sheep through the blood of the Everlasting Covenant make you perfect in every good work to do his will amen is this not the image lo I come to do thy will oh God he repeats it twice it's written of me in the volume of the book lo I come not just to do religious service not sacrifice and offering but I come to do thy will oh God so he says pray that God would make you perfect in every good work to do his will working in you that which is well pleasing in his sight through Jesus Christ to whom be glory forever and ever amen this is your thesis statement for your life if every day you were writing a five paragraph essay this is your thesis statement if your working on your thesis if you're working whatever your dissertation whatever it is you're doing this is it that God would make you perfect in every good work to do his will working in you that which is well pleasing in his sight through Jesus Christ not on your own to him be glory and for forever and ever the word here make you perfect this phrase make perfect means to strengthen to complete to make one what he ought to be amen when we have children and babes are born and the young ones begin to fill up the house we look at them with the potential that they have and we realize that every moment it's a phase of growth and some we enjoy more than others and others we just try to get through as much as we can but we look at them and we say that at this stage whether it be physical development or maturity this isn't as he ought to be and we're constantly trying to present whether by our own uh example in how that we treat our wives how we treat our children how we treat other people and how our discipline that we have we're wanting to demonstrate to them that there is a way that you ought to be and the way that you are now is is it has a vision it's looking forward the way that we ought to be then does not speak of certain demonstrations and manifestations as we said before but it's that righteousness to be as you ought and if we try to take our own peculiar identities and say this is the way that you ought to be then one could be testifying in your family you ought to be a foot surgeon cuz that's what I am no not me I mean but with the father was hypothetically speaking you're you need to be this you need to be that but it is a growth to be as one ought to be the word that it draws from in the compound meaning to make perfect it's Aros fitted perfected refers to this special aptitude for a given use you're realizing that each one of us have a calling each one of us have a place that God wants to use us and someone else can't take your place is that positional placing of a Believer where he comes to his call and he comes to what he's gifted in he's he's faithful in that and so God wants to make you perfect to make you as you ought to be because he has made you he's birthed you for a purpose and he's given you an aptitude for G certain uses and what do we do when we test people early on we have aptitude tests and that's what the world is looking out after trying to find what one has an aptitude for and therefore if you can find your aptitude then you could be oriented and shaped and promote growth in what you're you have an aptitude for a certain handiness too and a skill too God knows you're apt he knows what you've got he knows what's in you he knows that he's got gold he knows what to how to make you and so he he needs to do likewise that the world wants to do through schooling and resources God wants to through his word cultivate that and bring you to that place that he has raised you up for not just to be a baby in a in a crib not just to be a nursery not just to be a rock on a shelf but he wants you to be used to be placed in the body of Christ this Perfection is also spoke of in the parable of the sewer the parable of the sewing of seed in Luke chapter 8 you'll find it in other places but that seed which fell among Thorns it was choked out by the cares and riches and pleasures of this life and it brought no fruit to Perfection no it did not ever bring fruit to maturity and the word that's used here in this analogy it's used in The Sewing of seed is it says those that bring forth young whether it be animals humans uh plants it's the bringing of the young to maturity it's the bringing of that which has been fruited that which has been born to maturity it's about the word having expression in you not just being in you right but being lived through you a life lived by the will of God becoming the word expressed let us all take comfort in knowing our soul is sealed but have knowing that the soul is sealed let us all have this attitude and if we can have an aptitude for anything let it be that Lord I want to do your will I want to be Christlike in each phase and each turn I don't want to keep making the same mistakes with my wife I don't want to keep making the same mistakes with my children I want to stop living selfishly I want to stop living arrogantly and presumptuously I want to grow up if my sins indeed have been forgiven if I have in my soul realmed detained to an eternal State then God I want to live in my mind and my heart more at peace amen more forgiving more loving more faithful more true I don't want to allow the cares of this life and riches and Pleasures choke out the expression of the word of God I want it to live in me I believe I can go just a little bit we'll be real real conscious of the time but I want to just transition now from this to when the young ons don't grow up and just Ponder this phrase and even of this um this title if you would if you're wanting to know where I'm not hiding the ball on this at all if you're want to know where I'm drawing this from but it's the series that brother Brandon preached in streetport 1965 go study it from the first one to the last if you want to go further on to the end of the that year in December it's perfect kind of microcosm of what's inspiring me what the purpose of the word of God is and I've chose even this font as you would I think it's the font that Calvin wrote in this was his handwriting for all you homeschool moms take comfort and knowing that this is the way uh what Calvin's handwriting looked like and that comic Calvin and Hobbs and I was thinking about how that he lived in this imaginary world fascinating world and he's always doing you know these uh Rascal things right Dennis the Menace type things and always so innocent and quite an imagination and I was considering well what if Calvin never grew up from that imagination from that childlike behavior and that way that he saw everything and he could never see it from his parents perspective he never saw it from his dad's perspective it was was always just he he lived in his own world one of my favorite ones is when Calvin is at an end table in the living room and he's got a hammer in his hand and there's Nails in the coffee table and he's just going Bam Bam Bam and you hear his in the frame Calvin and she's running and you see her sprinting through the house and she stops and she says what are you doing and he goes is that a trick question in other words seems pretty obvious to me I'm nailing Nails in your coffee table and it shows that to the child he knows exactly what he's doing but to the parent she recognizes the boundaries she recognizes the the lack of respect of the different things she realizes this is maybe to be expected with Calvin but he needs to realize you don't do this kind of stuff and so that's you maybe I didn't mean to go down that route but I do it maybe sometimes just to just to be able to bring us all in to be able to relate to the particular thought but the title and even my title slide this title I want to paint a picture and I phras I felt led to phrase it this way when the youngans don't grow up that they would convey in this picture convey a warning of the consequences for not maturing or at least the urgency in the sense of necessity to mature in Ecclesiastes 10:16 it says wo to them o land when thy King is a child and thy princes eat in the morning it is a shame it is a woe it is a dread it is a for boing when the child is a boy when he is a youth when he differs nothing from a servant because he needs to be told what to do he doesn't have the power and the character to carry things out well to you when you're King as a child and when the princes eat in the morning in know words they always inclined to satisfy the urges of the flesh first and not observe what is right first it's speaking of emotional being emotionally immature whoa it's this passionate C of grief and this despair because if your King as a child and your princes that are supposed to do what is right eat in the morning for selfish reasons you're doomed to failure because your leadership is immature self- serving selfish in 2 Timothy 2:22 I'd like to add it to this wo to you when your king is a youth flee also youthful lust but follow righteousness Faith charity peace with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart remaining emot Ally immature that's why I says well when you're King as a child remaining emotionally immature keeps One Forever under the grips of these youthful desires youthful inclinations to pound nails into coffee tables to to imagine things to reach after fleshly things if one remains a youth they'll always be subject to the passions of Youth and say well what about when we all become young again your character ain't going to be young [Music] right I say I say this i' I've been holding it off maybe but when brother Brandon was asked what age would you want to live and he said that that senior age where the wisdom is he's been settled out he's learned he's grown that that's where he wanted to come back not as a 21y old why because it's character it's knowledge it's wisdom it's experience now if we could have Best of Both Worlds we'd come back 18 years old with the mind of the W wise the learned with the experience we have I have yet to come to the place in my life where I would trust myself to go back to 18 with what I am now but I want to be that I want to grow I want to grow to one day God can say I trust you in a young body I trust you with the power to speak worlds into existence I trust you to manage and run with everybody else the Millennium I hereby give you lelena Peninsula to do whatever you want for the next thousand years right like that's that's I want to I want to be that kind of son where he could trust me amen God grant that for us so these youthful lusts he says desires the Cravings that influence action of Youth so I want this title to convey this warning of being a child and what happens when you remain a child and I'd also like it to point to this true sign and evidence of the new birth which is the Seal of the Holy Ghost in John 14:26 but the comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever I have said unto you so the function of the Holy Ghost is to teach you and then you remind you what he taught you the inside teacher which is the Holy Ghost he will be with you even in you this inside teacher will instill in US wisdom and knowledge and understanding of the truth and then this inside teacher will also then give us recall of the things he has in stilled so that what our life becomes is a life of learning and application there's many things that we learn academically and there's things that we learn in life and there's things that we'll be learning just to uh influence our thought process and give us tools to be able to analyze and problem solve and it's exercising the brain to think critically like well when am I ever going to use this you will use it if I just speak defensively maybe as a homeschool family who might have to explain the purpose or if you there speak defensively of of certain disciplines where it just seems to be just academic it all has some use to cultivate the mind and to give you uh to increase your aptitude in certain things even it's say Well when am I ever going to use that formula it's knowing how to figure things out it's knowing how to think and to reason things out that's in the natural and then the life of a Believer is learning the things of God and then making application and once you get into the higher disciplines you're not just learning things but you're applying them you're getting out of the theory and you're getting to more the mechanical and that's what the Holy Ghost wants to do is teach you and then see you remind you to apply it brother random in the sermon the future home of the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly bride he said the evidence of the Holy Ghost is when you can receive the word not some system but have a clear understand how do you know the word is clear and understand it watch it vindicate itself well you say I see this do it and that now that's the thing he's leaning in on oh yes weeds live the same way what do weeds live by the rain that falls and they do this and they do that they can do all sorts of stuff in the flesh he says but it's got to be the entire word to be the bride you have to be part of him he is the word and what part of him is it the word that's promised for this day when he calls his bride be a part of that we're not just a gathering of weeds it's not just the Clapping of shuck it's not all those other things it's the bride part it's got to be the entire word the Holy Ghost comes to teach you to give you a clear understand the word to know the will of God for the hour that we're living in to be a part of the word that's promised for the time and the moment we're living in and John 16: 12 and 13 I have yet many things to say unto you but you cannot bear them now how be it when the spirit of Truth has come he will guide you into all truth it's not that at the moment you get the Holy Ghost go I have been enlightened and I know all truth it's not some fairy tale where you just all you do is all of a sudden you just see everything in eternity it's not it's not the matrix it's not taking a pill never seen it just hear about it all the time but there's this idea in those things where it's like oh I've just tapped into something and I Know It All no the Holy Ghost in you from the soul realm is wanting to push out everything you've learned in your mind and in your body and re-regulate your emotions re-regulate your perceptions and your disciplines and the things you're doing and to guide you into all truth not just give you a knowledge of the truth but literally guide you that you may grow up into him and question and answers brother B's talking about the evidence of the Holy Ghost and and he said what is the evidence what's this def he says he will perfect it right this is what the Holy Ghost does he perfects what's the evidence you have the Holy Ghost only you will know it now our spirit can bear witness with other people's spirits but I think we need to be really careful in how we try to judge and discern there's times that you even have to be careful somebody could be worshiping praising God speaking in tongues dancing and shouting and having a wonderful time and you see they're bobbed here and you make judgment you say that's not the Holy Ghost that's not a child of God what are you doing you're Jud you could be judging incorrectly and we're cautioned not to have that kind of attitude to not be so quick to write people off and judge them what would it what what would that speak of maybe somebody's immature knew a couple that when they first started to serve the Lord they had a phrase I might get it wrong but every time they see somebody say Revelation 3:17 or 2117 or something like that and they would have a phrase they used for certain people that looked you know Le Dean Revelations 3 and they would say this about them in this quick knee-jerk judgment and it didn't end well for them he'll perfect it manads won't do it and he is the word when the Holy Ghost has come he will identify himself in you with scripture and this is a true sign that the Holy Ghost is in you because it is the word how are you going to know you're Overcoming By the word it's not how do we know everybody else is overcoming how do you know do you want to do a man-made wouldn't it be great if we could just self- fulfill prophecy and just say I believe that I have the Holy Ghost when I can do this or this right and be like that's great that's awesome because you can do it that's the manads he'll identify you in the word he is the word when he the Holy Ghost is come he'll identify himself in you with the scripture and that is the true sign that the Holy Ghost is in you because it is the word now look what if you spoke with tongues I just want to ask you that is is speaking in tongues scripturally okay absolutely hey I believe if you wanted it ask God to do it he'll guarant it to you give you that experience there's nothing not scriptural about it he says I just want to ask you Jesus said when the Holy Ghost come what he would do and what if you spoke with tongues jumped up and down shouted and everything else and then come to the word what is he what is he kind of identifying and pointing out to us is that we can do all these things and enjoy it it's scriptural it's how the spirit can move upon an individual but how do you where's the emphasis at the end of the day what's your attitude towards the entire word do you do all those things and look at the what the Bible says to do this N I don't know I don't know because look I I'm getting results aren't I we're having a good time over here th this is kind of work church is fun now finally after all these years you can't argue with the results and he said well tap the brakes there nothing's wrong with this but there's a real problem in your attitude towards the rest of the word and that's where the problem is what about the people that claim to be holding to the word and then they see in the word that you ought to do this or that you can do this or the spirit of God moves this way and they judge it and they speak critically of it and they're immature and they have malice and evil speaking but they're twins of the same birth wow good that are looking at the full word and picking and choosing where they want to end up on it because Jesus never said the Holy Ghost would make you cry he never said the Holy Ghost would make you scream he never said the Holy Ghost would make you dance or shout or or make you starchy Jesus said when the Holy Ghost has come he told you what it would do guide you into all truth am teach you all things bring all things to remembrance I'm just reading from John 14 and John 16 there's a lot more that you could read so I'll say this although the baptism of the spirit can move you emotionally physically it can it it stimulates you there's a stimulation when the holy spirit moves do you believe that sir one of the very first times I could ever remember feeling the presence of God uh it was in the in it was in the 80s and I was just a young I I think I was less than 10 years old and the presence of God is moving in a camp meeting and I'm sitting I'm sitting down on this folding chair and I'm just weeping and weeping and crying cuz I know this is this is beyond human and I remember crying and weeping and I looked over to my buddy who lived in the air we were visiting and uh and he was just just across the aisle and I'm just sobbing as a 8 to 10y old or whatever maybe a little younger and I look over at him this crazy like what is going on and he's going I don't know if you thought I was in trouble or he's just laughing away at me laughing at me but I was like this is real because that's what the Holy Ghost does there's uh there's I've been in meetings where the word of God just even while it's preached hits somebody so hard that he has to be carried out of the carried out of the sanctuary can't move Still Standing after the piano's done playing finally deacons come up to him it's been forever and and they're like are you okay and he's I don't know I don't know I don't know I don't know what happened and there's a worldly kid who liked a girl in the church who visited that day cuz he wanted to get her number or whatever he's sitting down next to him he can't move either just a really kid knows nothing about church and the movement of God he's like sitting there and he's kind of like yeah you know good thing I was sitting down and they have to help him out what did the Holy Ghost can do that now did that vindicate the guy who preached that day oh well all right I accept it it didn't didn't vindicate the kid in the neighborhood nor did it vindicate the young man who was so slain in the spirit he couldn't move went home they had a Revival in their house but the marriage didn't last both of them split up gone their separate ways not serving the lord what that's that's a that's a sad tale right I still believe there's restoration I still think there can be salvation I desire when I think of that couple I still have a letter they wrote after the began to work in their lives and they knew God was real and I wish that they could have been uh nurtured in the word of God I believe they would have come to that experience but it just goes to show God moves that way although the spirit of God can stimulate and do that I want you to understand that's not the specific purpose of the Holy Ghost the specific purpose of the Holy Ghost isn't to stimulate Sensations or emotions in Acts chap 2:1 17 quoting Joel it says and it shall come to pass in the last days say God I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams because the spirit's poured up out poured out upon All Flesh and what is it going to do it's going to cause some to there's going to be gifts there's going to be things that manifest the rain is going to fall and what are the just going to do those that live by faith those who have been born again when the rain falls they're going to enjoy it let's not become so formal and start you that when the rain falls we're worried well I don't really will I want I don't want to give a false evidence well come on just be yourself listen if it's in you to dance if it's in you to shout if it's in you to cry just be yourself just don't tell yourself when you leave that that's good enough come back to the EV the evidence come back to the emphasis to remember the emphasis isn't on the stimulation the emphasis is on the revelation of the word of God in your heart am the emphasis on the personal knowledge of Jesus Christ the influence he's having on your daily life and whether or not you can look back and say I know that my sins have been forgiven and I know that the word is working mightily in me not because I can come to church and shut my mouth and stay quiet and be still because the bride needs to sit still and she needs to do this and she needs to or because I dance and run the aisles but because I see the trajectory of Christ in my life I'll pour out a spirit on All Flesh and the just they rejoice in it I believe that's why brother brandom kind of makes the statement sometimes that it has no emotion bury it cuz it's dead it can't be stimulated but the unjust will do the same thing the same rain that makes the wheat dance makes the weeds dance and this spirit being poured out upon All Flesh is not just some worked up emotional panic-stricken people it's not something that you look you you you give names to and and run down and criticize this is the general effect of the spirit on all people and the reason why you have to be careful not to speak against it is because if it is the spirit you would never want to speak one thing against it right so if someone testifies they could be a ranked sinner they could be someone who lives an ungodly life but if they testify to you that God healed them then what you should say is I believe God's A Healer if somebody testifies they felt the spirit of God you say I believe you because God lets his Spirit be made known in certain ways and there's a way that we can rejoice and fellowship a l class of people but we must realize that although the the general the Holy Spirit can be poured out generally and many people can be made to enjoy it and have this effect upon the mind and the body the specific work of the holy spirit is to perfect and to mature his body even the rain that falls on the weeds and brings them to their maturity wasn't meant for their maturity it was meant for your maturity the rain is meant the former the latter however you want to say it the teaching the Harvest whatever reain you want to talk about it's meant to bring seed to perfection in the church age book brother BR said the word always comes to the truly spirit filled that is the evidence of being filled the holy ghost that is what Jesus said would be the evidence think very deeply about this because I'm wanting to emphasize now when youngans don't grow up the title is meant to convey the true evidence of the holy spirit it's meant to convey the specific work that the Holy Ghost is intended in the individual it may manifest in a lot of things and never take that away from a Believer especially someone tends to cry if someone tends to shout someone tends to giggle I I kind of have this aptitude when the word is really really good and I'm sitting in my seat and the word's really good I laugh a lot and that may just be my nature and that doesn't mean that somebody I look over there and somebody else is just going I'm like that's not what you do there's a there's a there's a certain personality some of us are going to have and we're going to manifest it but the evidence of being truly spirit filled is the word comes to you so what ought we to emphasize what ought we to rejoice in when the word opens up to us when the word comes to us he says I want you to note very carefully that Jesus did not say the evidence of being baptized with the Holy Ghost was speaking in tongues interpreting prophesying or shouting and dancing I like the way he combines those last two he said the evidence would be that you would be in the truth you would be in the word for your age evidence has to do with receiving that word yes sir good and this is exactly what Paul is referring to when he says but when that which is perfect has come then that which is in part shall be done away when that which is perfect is come in other words when that which is perfect is made known when the word is opened up not a man-made not a public show but Supernatural things are imparted for the in time right for the time that you're living in it's when all these little things that are indicative of childhood and things that relate to adolescence and toddlerhood and growing up and teenagehood it's when we come to the perfect interpretation of the word with Divine Vindication amen that we begin to grow up it is perfecting in other words it's fulfilling purpose so Paul says in 1 Corinthians 13:11 when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child I thought was a child but when I became a man I put away childish things was that child it's a babe it's childish an infant actually remember we said on Wednesday night covers a spectrum an infant a toddler a little kid a minor and so if there's a an age at which you achieve status in the natural then as long as you're not 18 you're considered a minor not an adult or you're under 21 you're a minor right and we see that legal as far as the legality of the law and certain benchmarks for allowing certain behaviors or consent to vote to go to war to buy alcohol cigarettes all these different things because there's this spectrum of consent and age and immaturity to be unskilled and to be untaught when I was a child I acted like a child I had certain characteristics in me that manifested that were emphasized that came out as a child but when I became a man he's using this to distinguish an adult from a child when I attained that state that was fit for my aptitude and for my purpose I put away childish things he said I became more emotionally mature we can't leave who we are and who we were in our infancy even as a person today we are a product of what we were when we were six years old we're a product of the decisions we made when we were 15 we can never separate ourselves from what we have been it's a part of us now but we reach forth yes the same goes for our spiritual birth Paul in Corinthians 13 1 Corinthians 13 is using this analogy of the believer of spiritually maturing or perfecting and you find this in the message of the hour where brother brandham is saying when he preaches uh the signs of the time he says I want to preach a subject called the countdown and see how far we've progressed and he teaches in that sermon how we've left a Pentecostal age and we're coming up like the pyramid to what he says this last step has to come into Perfection preaches perfect Faith he says we're coming now to the Perfection because people have to come to that in order for the Rapture this last great step is in to Perfection it's not sinless Perfection because in the flesh we've sinned we've all sinned and fallen short of the glory of God so what does God do he gives us the sinless perfection in our soul and Jesus Christ who knew no sin the Bible says and being made perfect and he was per he was made perfect he learned obedience by the things which he suffered and being made perfect became so there was a Perfection to Christ and Christ was sinless so our Perfection is not sinless Perfection we never have a wrong thought we never do anything wrong but it's coming to maturity it's coming to our place and our position because we've got to come to that in order for the Rapture why because this is not the Pentecostal age this is the bright age because this is not the L to see in age of the restoration of the gifts this is the rapture time as Jesus said in Mark 4: 29 but when the fruit is brought forth you know what that means when it presents itself fully am CU you can see fruit on the vine you say oh well it's brought forth the word is no not yet you haven't seen it yet I'm looking right at it I can tell it's a raspberry that's not as good as it gets the life in that will bring that to a point where it can't get any good her no more time in the vine will make it any more mature it'll be what we call is ripe it was green but now it's what it needs to be what it was meant to to be and Jesus says As soon as it presents itself fully immediately he putteth in the sickle because the Harvest has come what is that maturity brother Bram said Jesus said by their fruits not tongues or emotions but by their fruits you shall know them so that is the fruit of the spirit it's God unfolding himself want you think about maturity about growing up God unfolding himself in humility sweetness and every day the same amen there's some days I've feel like I got it it's something about a man that stays right with the word every time that he sees the word he punctuates it with an amen no matter what the other people say he believes it that's what Jesus said the evidence would be by your fruits and he says not tongues or emotions but the fruit of the spirit the fruit presenting itself as Paul said then I now it's part now it's dark now it's cloudy but then face to face then I shall know even also as I am known eye to eye what's it speak of stature growing up to the stature of the father amen you can see eye to eye to know as I am known that's a maturity that's to actually see ourselves amen the story is told that the young man when he was 18 years old was leaving to go to college and he was so sickened by how little his parents knew 4 to 5 years later he graduates from college gets a real job out there in the world comes back and spends some time with his family he's shocked at how much they learned in such a short period of time the idea conveyed with that is that he had wisened and realized that they knew better all along to know as I am known is maturity as I said Wednesday night this is the process of character development growing into mature Believers am in Ephesians 5:1 he says be ye therefore followers of God as dear children that means imitators I'll just come back to this at a later time to expound upon it more but I just feel to kind of throw this out there as these little seeds musicians feel free to come to your instruments be imitators of God to be a son to be a child of God to be a son or daughter of God implies the absolute necessity for of imitation the absolute necessity of Desiring to become in the father's image be ye therefore followers of God runs parallel with Matthew 548 that says be therefore for perfect as a matter of fact I would argue that they are the same saying be therefore followers of God as dear children who can learn from the father emulate the father do what the father says obey the will of the father in desire to achieve that image and likeness of your heavenly Father which is perfect be therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect that word there perfect means complete perfect Integrity perfect virtue it means to be fully grown and mature to grow into the stature of him that is perfect this was spoken in the law in Deuteronomy 18:13 Thou shalt be perfect with the Lord thy God that was God's purpose and plan from the very beginning from Deuteronomy 18 to numbers 18 and Beyond God's will for you was Perfection and the law could not do that but Christ can and we can develop in the natural and just eat right not kill yourself through your nutrition habits and you can and let me just say this everybody has a body type you know some are shaped like a pear some are shaped like an asparagus you know everybody has their different shapes and uh I would like just to find mine I think it's covered up but there's a there's a way that you will just if you eat correctly even sometimes according to what your DNA tells you it should be and what you might have allergies to if you just Eat Right your body will develop within the bounds of its DNA but there's certain deficiencies that one could have as they're being nurtured in certain critical stages of life if something's lacking you may not be able to physically develop within your full potential can have great ramifications just in the natural and then as one begins to grow the same could be so with certain skills and aptitudes you could have been the greatest basketball player of all time but you never picked up a basketball you weren't willing to put in the time you weren't willing to put in the effort so there is in the natural this growing and this increasing a and this uh coming into your full poal IAL as an individual emotionally and physically you could just do that as a person with certain disciplines but that would only go so far as the law would allow you to go you could keep the law perfect but there is a life in Christ wherein once the soul has been born again God wants you not to fit the image of the world but to fit the image of the Divine and he wants you to grow it was always his will it's always what he was was testifying in the house of the Lord is perfection Jesus said except you be converted and become as little children what does it mean that in our conversion we become as children we become babes that then must learn and grow and brother brm said I believe that we've been children long enough God is going to turn his church into manhood now and we played and frolicked as children listen the play and Frolic nothing wrong with it sometime the the Frolic is a lot better than be that starchy old moaning and groaning dead tree but he says we're going to have to put away childish things and take on manhood maturity that's the time we're living in right now is growing up maturing now we have to use wisdom because if we are actually growing up and maturing we have patience for those who are young on we have patience for the young people get to experience wonderful things at their camps that may look really different than what goes on here but thank God the youth have their chance thank God they have their Outlet thank God they enjoy the certain things that relate to enthusiasm and have a great experience genuine outpouring of the Holy Ghost and and thank God that there's Real Men of God that'll continue to emphasize the right things to where they're not making a decision of leaving the divine presence of God at camp and going right back to the Catholic Church church called informal dead Church they've got at home but they realize they all have their place and they all have their purpose Let The Children Play Let Them Frolic as we do now even with our own children but be purposeful and have a vision that what we want them to do is grow yes sir we want them to grow up because en tight the bride has reached that age and therefore that's God's purpose in every age now as we come to the Lord God bless you let's stand let's just pray together now
