TRANSCRIPT
========================================
My title this evening is a filter change. And we'll kind of explore just exactly what we mean by this as we go forward. I think there's going to be some things that'll be pretty obvious to you, but a filter change. We're kind of looking at changing your filter. I don't know if anybody here changes their oil. Uh some people do, and I always joke that that's why I have a job is so I can pay professionals to do stuff like that. But admire people who can change their oil and the filter while they're at it. But if we could just look at verse 33, I'd like to just jump right into it tonight. It says, "No man when he hath lighted a candle putteth it in a secret place." In other words, nobody else has access to it. Uh it's hidden, neither under a bushel, but on a candlestick that they which come in may see the light. Uh just a couple things right at the very beginning is just to think about some of these things that are quite obvious. But light has power, illuminating power, and light has a purpose. He's saying nobody lights a candle just to put it in a closet or hide it, but they light it because there's darkness and it needs to give light. It needs to express. And so he says that you don't e even put it under a bushel. So that would be some means of uh diminishing the light. So a bushel will dim the light. It'll darken that light. And there's a lot of different bushels that we could call out tonight. I know in the message of the hour, brother Brandham refers to denominationalism and traditions. And the scripture shows us a lot of things that hinder or restrict the light. But I wanted to read this statement from the masterpiece. A sculptor wouldn't make a great masterpiece and then take it and set it in an alley somewhere or hide it behind buildings. As our Lord told us, a man doesn't light a candle and put it under a bushel. When we become God's masterpieces, we're not hid in an alley somewhere. We must give light. And I was reminded by brother Lucas uh just before service that I never finished Sunday morning service. And I completely forgot all about that in preparing for this service. Uh but one of the things that I was going to finish up on Sunday morning, maybe we'll just carried it over to next Sunday is that we we must be serious about this calling to express the light, to express Christ. And so God has not done what he's done in you and this beautiful work that he's doing in you. He hasn't done it so that it would be hid away. He hasn't done it so that we become very cultish and clanish and we just hide ourselves in the closet as it were, but that we are to display and give light. &gt;&gt; God has done this for a reason. He's begun a good work in you and he wants to express and manifest that work. &gt;&gt; In Matthew 5 14, 15, and 16, he says, "Ye are the light of the world." We're getting into that season and I some of you know some of you have probably already done it. you've dusted off your Christmas music collection and and and you're singing already about lights and the light of Christmas lights and joy to the world. The the light has come and those things, but now he's saying you are the light of the world. It kind of changes the perspective a little bit. A city that is set on a hill cannot be hid. So this is speaks to God wanting to set you forth as light. Neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick, and it giveth light unto all that are in the house. Notice here, this is in Matthew chapter 5. The reading that we took in Luke chap 11 is a different instance. And so this is something a theme that Jesus repeated more than once. So he says, "Let your light so shine before men." So you have a light. You've been given uh this brilliance or this brightness. Let it shine before men that they may see your good works. So we could connect the brightness of our light to works that we do. It it this isn't a challenge to outdo the neighbor this year with your holiday lights. Uh and I don't know if anybody's competitive in that way, but we know some neighborhoods that's what they're known for is their Christmas displays. But we don't want to just shine at one time of the year. We want our lights to so shine. And it's through your attitude, your response, the way you live, the way you dress your good works. And that in living this kind of life, it's a drawing power because he says, "And glorify your father which is in heaven." I feel like the Lord just opened this scripture up to me more earlier this year in that it wasn't that people see how good of a Christian you are and say, "Man, God is a good God." But that your light brings them to glorifying God for salvation in their own life. &gt;&gt; That you would be a light that would draw others to Christ and them repenting of their sins would find the goodness of the Lord. So that we are set forth to be witnesses. &gt;&gt; We are set forth to be uh to to be light to the world. So we are light and we have not been made this brilliant light for it to be hid, but we are to let our light shine. So a man that lights a candle uh raises it up conspicuously in a way that it would give light to others as they come in would see the light. Verse 34, Lukeap 11:34. Now he begins to look at this characteristic of ourselves. How are we illuminated? The light of the body is the eye. Therefore when thine eye is single the whole body also is full of light. So this uh this singleness of eye just think of this and how it required it the requirement in order to be full of light and th when thine eye is evil thy body also is full of darkness. Take heed therefore that the light which is in thee be not darkness. If thy whole body therefore be full of light, having no dark part, the whole shall be full of light. As when the bright shining of a candle doth give thee light, he's speaking about an eternal light that we have that is being externally manifested that you are the light of the body is the eye. And so he's talking about the whole body being full of light. And and so it's it's referring to the expression of this light. So I want you to think of it in two ways and I hope that I could kind of carry this through tonight. that you have an inward light and then you have an outward light. &gt;&gt; And so this full enlightenment Jesus is saying that the the whole body shall be full of light. It depends on the singleness of your eye. In that singleness, it doesn't mean you want to poke one of your eyes out. Uh but that you have a simple eyesight or it means that it's clear. If I could kind of tie it into what we've ministered on the last couple services, it's not mixed. It's not impure. There's a singularity of vision or purpose. And so Jesus is referring to the soundness of eyesight and that if you have sound eyesight and you have clear vision uh in other words you're not looking two different ways &gt;&gt; and you don't have um you have singleness of purpose not having two ends in view then the whole body can be illuminated. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Proverbs 4:es 25 to 27. Let thine eyes look right on and let thine eyelids look straight before thee. It's it's there not this there's not this double vision. There's not this blurring or this divided this divided path. Ponder the path of thy feet and let all thy ways be established. Turn not to the right hand nor to the left. Remove thy foot from evil. This speaks to that singleness of eye. It means a singleness of purpose where you have and I think this is good a lot of times in work settings where you have some overarching theme or goal or some mission or objective and you say this is the objective that we want to fulfill. And when you're left with a decision uh with that's not clear in the rules or you're not sure what to do, measure it by your goals. Does it fit with your objective or the these goals? And so we've got to have this singularity of vision to say this is ultimately what I'm wanting to do so that we're not divided in our energies and our focus. &gt;&gt; Helps us com uh from turning away from evil. In James 1:8, it says a double-minded man is unstable in all his ways. That's that wavering or uncertainty. the doubting. A double-minded man is divided in his loyalties. &gt;&gt; He's divided in his interest. So, and maybe he'd be this way one moment, this way the next, or even in the same moment, he's got a double-minded man. And really, this speaks to a man who's got a lot of religion up here in his head, but not Christ in his heart. And that makes him double-minded because, oh, I want to serve God, but without being born again, it's just religion. 1 Timothy chapter 3:es 8 and N. Likewise must the deacons be grave. I didn't I probably should have warned the deacons ahead of time. But the deacons must be grave. That doesn't mean in the grave or dead. There must be a soberness to them. It says not double tonged, not given to much wine. Yeah, this was the phrase I came up with today. Double-mindedness leads to double tongedness. Should be the new word of the year. Double tongedness. It kept saying it was not spelled correctly. I'm assuming there's no such word. But it says that they should not be double tonged. That means saying one thing to one person and another thing to another. &gt;&gt; What does that show? This lack of consistency, this lack of singularity, not double tongue, not given to much wine, not greedy, a filthy lucer, holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience. So what does it kind of relate back to? that there must be this purity of mind, this purity of sight, this purity of conscience in order to be grave and not double tonged and not given over to excess as Ephraim was a cake not turned too much extremes. &gt;&gt; And so the clarity of the inward eye, this is what Jesus is saying and or I'm trying to draw this from it. The clarity of the inward eye uh imparts this pure vision, this clear and beautiful perceptions of of things. When your eye has some obstruction, then you you can't see clearly. And and also I want you to look at this way. Not only does it give these beautiful perceptions to the one who's seeing, but it allows for beautiful expressions. &gt;&gt; The mind or the eye filters what is seen and then it'll also filter what is expressed. &gt;&gt; If there's an inward light, if there's light coming in, a filter can stand in the way of that. there's light to be going out, it can be in the way of that. So the filtering of light, this is where I was drawing my inspiration from, but the filtering of light, it diffuses or suppresses our uh in other ways otherwise keeps light from shining perfectly or clearly. Anyone who's in photography knows how that these filters work. And I'm not talking about in the post-processing, but in the initial time of of taking a picture, uh these filters selectively block light. you say, "Oh, well, I'm going to use this filter and I'm going to place it on my lens so that it doesn't allow this certain spectrum of light to go through." So, it selectively blocks uh and reduces or maybe even enhances certain wavelengths of light. It's kind of, you might have noticed this by some people who use filtering in the post process. Uh when they're posting, you say, "I noticed that every picture that they post kind of has this yellow hue to it." Well, they found their favorite filter. And no matter where they are or what the picture is, it always maybe looks v uh vintage or it always looks uh has a certain hue to it. And that's the process of filtering. But I'm not talking about something that's done digitally. But I'm talking about in the moment where something is seen. For a photographer, they'll use some sort of glass or resin that's placed in front of the lens and it CONTROLS HOW LIGHT ENTERS the camera. I'm talking about a filter now that we use in ourselves related to if thine I be single then the whole body can be full of light then what is it what is going to cause this evilness of eye and whenever you use a filter and on a camera on the lens it shapes the image even before it's captured &gt;&gt; so even before the image is created you've already manipulated it &gt;&gt; even before the light strikes the lens you've manipulated it before it senses a hits the sensor or it goes on the film, you've changed what the picture is going to look like. &gt;&gt; Shapes the image even before it's captured. So the challenge I present tonight to all of us is what kind of filters are present in our lives? What kind of bushels do we have that are distorting the images that we see and the image that we express? &gt;&gt; That if we are looking at something, what filters have we placed between us and what is being expressed? So that by the time it hits our mind, by the time it hits our heart, we've already manipulated it to reduce certain wavelengths or enhance others. And like when you listen to a sermon and you're listening to it just to know just exactly how it's really going to hit your spouse and when it does, you're kind of like, &gt;&gt; right, you've put up that spousal filter kind of like we do it for the neighbor in the apartment next door, right? We just kind of put that resin up there and it's going to filter through. The only thing that's going to get through is the things that really nail the neighbor. And this is the way that it can be for us. We have these filters in our minds or our eye and we put on, you've probably heard the phrase rosecolored glasses. &gt;&gt; I can still remember the first time that really ever was used on me. I'm just skipp sharing a testimony. I don't know if I'm just waxing nostalgic cuz my parents are here, but I was working at a law firm in my undergrad uh before I went to law school and I was getting really close to graduating, going to be starting to go to law school and I was working at this law firm and had kind of come up a little bit in and what I was asked to do and I was overseeing summer interns and I was determining who would get job offers and so I thought I'd go see the partner and just ask, look, this is going pretty good. Do I have the guarantee? You know, could I have some sort of promise? Is there a path for me to get a job? uh as I go through law school and when I graduate and I should have known something was gonna happen when he said shut the door. I was like, "Okay, I shut the door." And he said, "I'm going to give you what I call my rosecoled glasses speech." And he slapped the rosecolored glasses off my face so bad I was like, "Can I go home now? I've been turned into a cow." Like, I was shook. And I walked out of there and I went right to the person I worked with, the parillegal that was a worked with this partner and I opened the door and they go, "What is wrong with you? You look horrible." I'm like, "Uh-huh. I I am I'm horrible." And I said, "Can I go home now?" I literally said I I pulled a Jenkins. I was like, "I I want a half date." And so I went home and I remember it was a Wednesday and I remember and what he did is he basically said, "Look, you want to go to law school? Let me tell you how horrible it is to go to law school. Let me tell you what's going to happen to you. And let me tell you what's going to happen to you when you graduate. Let me tell you how bad the job market's going to be. I'm going tell you how hard you're going to be working. And any any filter that I had about riches and about prestige and about power and all or what how good it was going to be to be a lawyer, he removed all the filters so I could see it for what it was. &gt;&gt; And I was so shook, so sick to my stomach and [snorts] so anxious. I remember thinking, "My dad better not lay an egg tonight." No. I went to church knowing I need to hear from God. And I remember my dad preached a sermon that didn't put rosecolored glasses back on, but put the eye of faith back on my eyes &gt;&gt; to where I was seeing things now not through another filter, BUT THROUGH THE FILTER OF GOD'S word so that I could stand and SAY, "HEY, DOES IT MATTER WHAT'S AHEAD of me?" &gt;&gt; And so, WE MIGHT HAVE THESE DIFFERENT FILTERS that distort what we see. But I also want you to understand those filters will distort what others see. &gt;&gt; Right? Is there a filter we have on our lives where other people are looking say, "Man, I really want to see a Christian, but I'm I'm getting a certain spectrum or wavelength here." No offense to the spectrum, BUT I'M GETTING SOMETHING COMING through here, and it may not be Christ. &gt;&gt; So, think of this in the sense that filters keep light from coming through &gt;&gt; or it modifies the light into something it purely isn't. And the wrong kind of filter will keep God's light from penetrating our spirits. &gt;&gt; The wrong kind of filter keeps the word of God from being effective. We should believe the word of God is powerful. &gt;&gt; We should believe there's nothing wrong with the word, which is the seed. Nothing wrong with it. So, if we're getting we're not getting results, we don't question the word of God. &gt;&gt; Now, we can question whether or not we have what we have is the word of God and what we're believing is the word of God. BUT IF YOU KNOW YOU have the word, you don't need to manipulate it. You don't need to change it. You don't need to add to or take away. The word of God is perfect. It is a seed. And if it's not producing, THE PROBLEM IS SOMEWHERE ELSE, not with the word. &gt;&gt; And so the the these filters will keep God's word from penetrating our spirits, but then also from being shined abroad. In Ephesians 5 6 to14, once again, I'm trying to use just a little bit more of scriptures in the context. You could just see how applicable these things are, how relevant they are within the context. Let no man deceive you with vain words, those things that are empty, have no weight or or benefit. For because of these things, cometh the wrath of God upon the children disobedience. Be not ye therefore partakers with them. There is that uh that not mixing. For ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord. Walk as children of light. &gt;&gt; Jesus said that you are the light of the world. Now we are light in the Lord. Therefore, if we are light, we must walk as children of the light. For the fruit of the spirit is all goodness and righteousness and truth. I believe we could connect this to the light that Christians emit and to the good works that will cause others to glorify God. These fruits of the spirit are goodness, righteousness, and truth. And we as lights, verse 10, prove what is acceptable unto the Lord, and have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them. These are some, this is some pretty heavy words. You are light, and as light, we should be emitting light, walking in the fruit with the fruits of the spirit of goodness, righteousness, and truth. That we're proving what is of God. We're proving what is the perfect will of God. and that we ought not to have communion or uh this affection or even this representation with unfruitful works of darkness, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And and it's not that we don't have anything to do with it, but we also reprove them. &gt;&gt; THERE'S GOT TO BE A TESTIMONY. THERE'S GOT TO BE A WITNESS that says this is the right way. AND IT'S BY THAT WITNESS THAT THAT those that are wrong are reproved or corrected. &gt;&gt; Amen. One of the worst ways to correct something is just to say they're wrong. &gt;&gt; You know you're doing it wrong. No, I didn't know I was doing it wrong. You're absolutely doing it wrong. That's that's not the right way to do it. Oh, well, what is the right way to do it? I don't know. I just know that's not the right way. Well, I'll just keep doing it the wrong way until you show me the right way. And that's what a lot of people do is they just they do like they did to the man going down uh to Jericho. They beat them and rob them and strip all their Christianity away, all their faith away, and they leave them naked and half dead, and they don't have anything else to give but to take away. &gt;&gt; He says, "But we're to reprove them with goodness, righteousness, and truth, for it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret. But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light." Don't forget who he's talking to. Children of the light. Now, ye are light. And so we are that which reproves and it's done so by light. For whatsoever doth make manifest is light. So we have to make manifest. By making manifest we reprove. Wherefore he sayith awake thou that sleepst and arise from the dead and Christ shall give thee light. The inward light that we have if Christ has made us light. This inward light must be unfiltered in order to properly manifest the fruits of the spirit. in a kind of filtering keeps out uh the the goodness and righteousness and truth and that light that is in us must be unfiltered to reprove the fruits of darkness. If you put a filter in the way, what will it do? It it'll it won't reprove darkness. If if we take some filter and we're filtering out patience, then impatience isn't reproved. &gt;&gt; Whatever whatever wavelengths aren't getting out, then it's not going to expose or bring to light. This is how things will just continue in people's lives and fester is when light isn't either being received or it's not being admitted. It allows things to hide in the darkness. &gt;&gt; So the light of God must be unfiltered even to try your own thoughts. &gt;&gt; You come to church and you put up all your I I think maybe you've used this before just how what kind of spiritual black belt some of us are where we come and we can block every move, right? There's no way the word's going to get in there and hit you because you've gotten so good at just blocking every shot. &gt;&gt; And so, we must have this unfilteredness of heart to where the word of God can try our thoughts, our desires, and our own works. &gt;&gt; I don't I I I don't necessarily want to just encourage you to go out there and shine, you know, 500 billion lumens on somebody else's life, but let it first shine in me &gt;&gt; that it might try me and reprove. I love the song that we sang at the start of the service. Search me, oh God, &gt;&gt; with your search light. Search me out with light. See if there be anything hidden, anything dark, and chase away the darkness. &gt;&gt; That's the beauty of light. They haven't invented it anything yet. That's the reverse of a flashlight. &gt;&gt; Or you can just suck the light out of a room. It doesn't exist. But you can go in a dark room and turn on light and darkness has to flee. &gt;&gt; In Ephesians chapter 5, just continuing a little bit later in verses 25 to 27. But brother Brandham takes this text when he preaches a thinking man's filter. He says, "Husbands, love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it." So we're talking about some of the most important things that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word. Hold that in mind. And this is the work that it produces. That he might present it to himself a glorious church. &gt;&gt; This is what verse 26 produces. Not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but that it should be holy and without blemish. And what does that? The word does. &gt;&gt; The word is what washes. &gt;&gt; It's what sanctifies and cleans. It's what removes spots and wrinkles. It's what produces holiness and this without blemish. And so this is very simple. And you know where I'm getting it from. The word must be the believer's filter. &gt;&gt; So we can say, well, I just I just want to be unfiltered. And I know I'm referring a little bit to being unfiltered, BUT NOT COMPLETELY UNFILTERED. You just want the right filter. &gt;&gt; You've got to have the right filter. You've got to the word must be the believer's filter because that's what God's filter is is his word. &gt;&gt; In numbers chapter 19 verses 7 8 and 9, it speaks of the process of once the the hepher's been burned and the ashes need to be uh taken care of and the priests are now going to be changing out of their garments that they use to offer this sacrifice for sin. says, "Then the priest shall wash his clothes and he shall bathe his flesh in water and afterward he shall come into the camp and the priest shall be unclean until the evening." So there's this purifying process. Once washed, then through the evening he can enter back into service on the next day. And he that burnth her the heer shall wash his clothes in water and bathe his flesh in water, &gt;&gt; and shall be unclean until the evening. I I know the chemical guys have come up with stuff to clean without water, but that's not how God works. &gt;&gt; No synthetics, no harsh chemicals. You can just wash in water. Says, "And a man that is clean shall gather up the ashes of the hepher and lay them up without the camp in a clean place, and it shall be kept for the congregation of the children of Israel, for a water of separation. It is a purification for sin." What a beautiful image of the the nature of God's word which is power to cleanse power to wash. The word of God is what washes you and separates out anything impure. The Bible says in Psalms IN PSALMS 119, YOU KNOW, HOW SHALL A young man cleanse his way? HOW AM I GOING TO PURIFY my mind and my heart and my actions, MY ATTITUDE TOWARDS OTHER PEOPLE? HOW AM I GOING TO DO IT? The Bible says, by taking heed according to thy word. In other words, BY SUBMITTING TO THE WASHING of the word. BY ALLOWING THAT WORD to water my spirit, WASH THROUGH MY MIND, WASH THROUGH MY THOUGHT PROCESS, IT has the ability of removing anything unclean or impure. &gt;&gt; Whatever can be removed, it can be removed BY THE WORD OF GOD. AND THEN WHAT REMAINS is the word itself. &gt;&gt; So the word washes the word purifies sin or unbelief. &gt;&gt; And just as these priests would wash their clothes with water, wash their flesh in water. In Ephesians 5, this very image that he might wash his bride, sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the water by the word. The word is the filter. It's what washes. It's a protection against harmful things. That's what that's what the washing is to do. The fil word of God as a filter protects you from harmful things. It's going to collect and block out things that are harmful, but it's also your access to good things. &gt;&gt; I I'm not But you know, maybe maybe I should have studied more for this sermon. But you know, you use the wrong filter on something, you can completely destroy it &gt;&gt; because a certain something needs to get through that. &gt;&gt; And it's designed in such a way to whatever is going to operate that engine or whatever is going to operate that that that that process, it has a filter that keeps the things out that'll inhibit it. &gt;&gt; Uh but it's going to allow the things it needs to get through. And so the word of God is is a FILTER THAT ALLOWS THE WORD TO WASH you &gt;&gt; and it's going to let the word through because the word coming to your faith is HOW DOES FAITH COME? BY HEARING THE WORD OF GOD. &gt;&gt; And so with THE RIGHT WITH THE WORD FILTER, it lets the word get through but it's also going to keep other things out. &gt;&gt; But if you have the wrong filter, the word may not be getting through, &gt;&gt; but other things are. &gt;&gt; With the wrong filter, personality can get through. If anybody starts acting like me, I'm going to say, "Change your filter." Hey, you got the wrong You got the personality filter on. You're only letting personality through. &gt;&gt; It's got to be the word that comes through. &gt;&gt; So, it's the right filter is access to good things, but protection from harmful things. &gt;&gt; In uh in the sermon, a thinking man's filter, and brother Brennham is using the cigarette filter as his example. And what what happens with I actually did a little studying on cigarette filters. I didn't do any kind of experiments with it, just read. But it basically modifies the smoke phase through filtering, but then it also modifies the gas phase by absorption. And so there's these two processes that take place where it's going to filter out um particulates of smoke, but then it's also supposed to absorb the gases. And the purpose behind the filter is to reduce harm caused by smoking. and does it by what? Absorbing the gases or uh filtering these harmful chemicals that could be inhaled. And so in the sermon of thinking man's filter, one of the things that brother Brandham identifies very very clearly and it's so very very helpful for me is how that he connects a filter to a taste. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; That the filter uh has this effect and he's making this connection between the filter and what one craves and what they desire. He says, "We find out of our day that the people has got a taste." Why does a man smoke a cigarette? It's to satisfy a taste. If it was just the sucking, then you just put your finger in your mouth, right? What are you doing? Satisfying my urge to smoke. But it doesn't work. What does the woman smoke a cigarette for? Satisfy a taste. This is very simple. says, "And then if the church has figured out a religious group to get the people in there, they've got to have a certain kind of filter to GIVE THE PEOPLE THE TASTE that they want." &gt;&gt; It really does describe where Christianity has gone today where church looks more in uh more for Instagram. &gt;&gt; It looks like IT'S MADE TO POST PICTURES. It's branded and it's done in such a way to where we want we want this to be engaging in a theatrical way because it pleases the eye &gt;&gt; and and and you might be saying and you guys have gone the opposite direction and I'm not saying that's the right way to go but THERE IS SOMETHING ABOUT BEING SO CAUGHT UP IN THAT KIND OF filtering &gt;&gt; and what will it ultimately speak to the Instagram in us &gt;&gt; the social media part of us that popularity wanting to belong the pretense. So they get a certain filter for the taste they want. So if they don't get any taste that they want, they don't want the cigarette. &gt;&gt; Do you hear that? &gt;&gt; They don't get the taste they want, they won't they don't want the cigarette. And if they can't get the taste they want in religion, they don't take the religion. &gt;&gt; So if you're not if you have a taste, if you have some sort of leaning or inclination, if you're not getting that through your religion or through your church or what you want, then you won't you'll go try to find it somewhere. &gt;&gt; Right? So, in my in my my studying on this, I just thought I wanted to do somewhat not maybe not a deep dive, but just kind of go in the waiting pool of cigarette filters. And I was reading some studies and different things. And there was many different tests that showed that there was this reduction of tar in nicotine in cigarette smoke. And though there there was this reduction though there's this reduction, the filters were essentially ineffective at removing the gases to any kind of substantial weight. such as carbon monoxide. And this is what one of the studies said. Most of these measures, most of these measured reductions occur only when the cigarette is smoked on a smoking machine. And some of you might BE LIKE, "THAT'S UNCLE FRED." BUT NO, WE'RE TALKING about something that was made for the sole purpose of just drawing smoke. &gt;&gt; It says when smoked by a human, the compounds are delivered into lungs regardless of whether a filter is used. Okay. So, what you're telling me is there's a bunch of robots that never got cancer &gt;&gt; and because they never got cancer and that that whatever it was they were ingesting and hey, you know, robot number two over here hasn't coughed ever. And then but then it says that you go to smoke it and it's delivering tar and nicotine STRAIGHT TO YOUR LUNGS. SO, think of this whole image that's trying to be perpetuated that, WELL, INSTEAD OF SMOKING IS BAD, DON'T do it. WE COULD JUST USE A filter so that you could smoke. But then just ask yourself, why would I smoke? &gt;&gt; WHY WHY WOULD I DO THAT? WHAT GETS A PERSON TO SMOKE? I I'm preaching to non-smokers tonight. I mean, I I'm getting kind of nervous all of a sudden. And that that includes vaping. &gt;&gt; I'm sure there's going to be a series on the dangers of vaping because that's just another subtle way it sneaks in. It's just like, &gt;&gt; yeah, I'm good, right? No, probably not. There's this they've used they perpetuate this lie that oh, smoke cigarettes because the filter is going to protect you from anything harmful. Brother Bam says a thinking religious man's filter is the word. So, he's drawn from that uh the the advertisement uh and I'll get to it here in a moment. Uh that uh a thinking man's filter uh and a smoking man's taste. &gt;&gt; But he says a a religious man, true, genuine, pure and true. This this one of goodness and righteousness and truth. His filter is the word and it satisfies the holy taste that's in his heart. A ficky man's filter, a holy man's taste. And I would say this that a child of God is ordained. They're they're they're made with a craving inside of them uh to be born again. AND NOTHING WILL EVER SATISFY that unless it's the word. &gt;&gt; So he says, "Oh my, what are we into?" He says, "INSTEAD OF USING GOD'S FILTER FOR HIS SOUL, HE'S LETTING SATAN DECEIVE HIM BY SOME denomination or creed, JUST EXACTLY LIKE THE TOBACCO COMPANIES ARE DECEIVING YOU PEOPLE THAT SMOKE CIGARETTES." AMEN. &gt;&gt; NOW, we didn't know that maybe all that the tobacco industry is exactly what modern monetized Christianity has become, BUT IT'S ALL JUST A ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN to sell you a poison &gt;&gt; to line their pockets and to make themselves rich. &gt;&gt; The tobacco companies are deceiving you the same way that these are are are deceiving the people that smoke cigarettes. And that's the same tool that Satan is using to deceive people into the wrong filter. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It's good. &gt;&gt; He says you just get more members. That's all. &gt;&gt; So here is I'm draw taking this from a study. Brother John, if you want to put that slide up. I had done this a number of years ago where I tried to find every place where visceroy cigarettes used this advertising campaign of a thinking man's filter and a smoking man's taste. I know it's difficult to see here. This is not AI but this is different industries you can say maybe someone who works in shipping another one who kind of looks like a lawyer maybe another one who's a a scientist another one who's a builder and uh maybe an astrophysicist there's just different industries right and so you have these different men here saying a thinking man's filter smoking man's taste viscery victory and it's a draw to say we have a filter but you're still you're still going to get the taste. But it says by the mid 1960s, cigarette designers realize that the intractability of the filter PROBLEM DERIVED FROM A SIMPLE FACT. THEY had this problem with the filter is not solving our problems. We cannot undo this. Here's the simple fact. That which is harmful in mainstream smoke and that which provides the smoker with satisfaction are essentially one and the same. Just letting that marinate a little. &gt;&gt; Let's put a filter on it to keep the bad stuff out. And then as soon as you put a filter on it, it's like, I'm not enjoying this anymore. &gt;&gt; Because what do they have? They have a taste for the bad stuff. &gt;&gt; That which is harmful and that which gives satisfaction are one and the same. Only in the wake of this realization did the agenda of cigarette designers appear to transition away from mitigating the health hazards of smoking and towards the perpetuation of the notion that cigarette filters are effective in reducing these hazards. &gt;&gt; Filters became a marketing tool designed to keep and recruit smokers as consumers of these hazardous products. &gt;&gt; What do they want you to do? Keep you just use a filter. It'll take out all the bad &gt;&gt; and it'll just give you what you want, that taste. But what was it actually doing in order to satisfy the taste? It was the appearance of taking out the bed. &gt;&gt; Because the taste is what was so important. &gt;&gt; And I and I want to use as brother Brandham did in the thinking men's filter, how that the filter that is used is related to your taste or your desire. The filters that you have as far as your eye and your mind and your spirit will either allow the world through or it'll allow the word through. &gt;&gt; And what we allow through or keep out will either strengthen us or weaken us. &gt;&gt; If we have a filter that lets the bad stuff in, no matter how much we tell ourselves it's working, if it's not the right kind of filter, it weakens you. And this is how you can self-regulate. And you can look at yourself and say, "Am I getting stronger?" If you're not getting stronger, what kind of filter have you been using? Wow. &gt;&gt; Filtering even becomes a means of twisting what we see, reshaping the image that we look at. We can have a kind of filter and we always put that filter on when we go to the word of God, when we read the Bible, when we listen to the word of God. The kind of filter we have is going to determine what gets through. And if you have a filter that's looking for particular taste, you may still be getting harmful things. &gt;&gt; Because the wrong filters will keep the word from having preeminence. Amen. &gt;&gt; The filter changes the image before it strikes the sensor. &gt;&gt; So if you have the wrong kind of filter up, the word's not having the impact it ought to because you're THE YOU'RE WARPING THE LIGHT. &gt;&gt; Says the wrong kind of filters keeps Jesus out of our homes, &gt;&gt; out of our hearts. &gt;&gt; And these filters are what influence our tastes. It's what causes us to be loyal, causes this dependency where, you know, there's uh there's sometimes where, and I'm not making light of it at all, but sometimes people say, "No, I I only drink this water in that is it the shape?" And they'll be, "Yeah, it's that shape or whatever. It's it's this water." Like I remember when Fiji Water said their water was better than Cleveland's water and it turned into a lawsuit and Cleveland proved that they had better water than Fiji water. It's all just being pumped out of the back lot of a Walmart somewhere anyways, right? But we've convinced ourselves this is better, right? Filtered water is better. So there's a certain taste that we begin to develop, a certain dependency. And as we have this taste, it influences our desires and our pursuits. And it's what leads to what? Addictions. &gt;&gt; Smoking is not an innocent recreation. These things I'm reading and these exhaustive studies that have been done have proven that the dishonesty of the tobacco industry has resulted in immeasurable deaths in cancer because they hid the truth that there was it was damaging, it was addicting, and it was cancer-causing. But just this inference of a filter was somehow going to solve all the problems when in reality they realized that they were allowing people to be lulled into an addiction by telling themselves they were filtering out the bad. They had the wrong filter. What they needed was a filter that says don't even smoke. &gt;&gt; What they needed was a filter that told them that this kind of stuff perpetuates the wrong kind of dependencies, the wrong kind of loyalties and the wrong kind of tastes. Amen. &gt;&gt; 2 Timothy 4:3 says, "For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine." &gt;&gt; That light shining makes THEM UH GET UNCOMFORTABLE. &gt;&gt; But after their own lust shall they heap to themselves filters, &gt;&gt; says teachers here, but they become a filter for the word of God. Having itching ears, &gt;&gt; what is that? They want to hear, "Scratch my itch, brother. &gt;&gt; I want to hear it a certain way. &gt;&gt; I I want to hear you put the spin on it. I want to hear you put a particular emphasis on it. Satisfy my bent. I I believe the message is THIS WAY. SO, I WANT YOU TO FILTER IT THROUGH THAT THEOLOGY. I WANT YOU TO FILTER IT THROUGH THAT INTERPRETATION. I WANT YOU TO GIVE ME THE TASTE. AND THERE'S SIMPLY JUST SOME PEOPLE THAT MERELY HAVE THE TASTE FOR PERSONALITY OR POLITICS AND NOT THE PURE word of God. And once YOU STRIP THE POLITICS OUT OF LIKE don't like it. &gt;&gt; ONCE YOU STRIP THE PRETENSE AND THE PERSONALITY OUT OF IT, they don't like it. &gt;&gt; Why? Because they have itching ears, [snorts] &gt;&gt; it becomes a filter. &gt;&gt; In Matthew chapter 6 19 to 24, I kind of toyed with the idea of cutting my sermon short tonight because then if I did that and then I joined it with what I didn't get last Sunday, maybe I'd have a few days off, you know, next Sunday for next Sunday. But um I so it's I guess it's just up to you. It just help me help me finish in the right spot. Matthew chapter 6 19 to 24. This is companion to what we read in Luke. Remember Jesus already in chapter 5 says ye are the light of the world. Candle's put on a candlestick that it might give light to those that are in the house. So let your light so shine. Notice the context of this. Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth where moth and rust doth corrupt and where thieves break through and steal. Where are these spiritual investments? How are we making these as believers? &gt;&gt; A brother was sharing with me a tremendous testimony today. A and you see the hand of God and and the the the measurable things it can bring naturally. But there's this other side that's a spiritual investment that you begin to calculate. What are these spiritual intangibles? How is my spiritual balance sheet in my marriage, in my relationship with my children, AT HOME? HOW IS THAT BOTTOM LINE BEING increased spiritually? BECAUSE WE GOT TO LAY up eternal spiritual treasures. So he says, "But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, where thieves do not break through nor steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also." Think of this in terms of your alignment, your eye, your vision, what your aim is. Because he says, "The light of the body is the eye." Notice how quickly he comes to this. The heart, the light of the body is the eye. If therefore thine eye be single, the whole body shall be full of light. just it it's it's not something else placed upon the lens. There's not some other filter being put in there. One of the things that really inspired me to do this is I was fellowship with brother Frankie on Saturday and he was talking about uh the the the process of a filter and the sermon thinking man's filter and he actually had AI create another advertisement called a thinking man's filter. Uh and it kind of took from that visceroy thing showing that this is the kind of filter we ought to have the word of God. And it says that if thine eye be single, unmixed, pure, this singular vision of eternal treasures, thy whole body shall be full of light. But if thine eye be evil, the wrong kind of filter, the wrong kind of adding to or taken away, thy whole body shall be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is that darkness? And then notice what he says in verse 24. We're talking about laying up treasures and having singleness of vision or eye and how the eye acts as a filter for light and that a single eye will allow the light of God's word to come in and wash and filter. And I know I'm adding these other things into these other principles into this. And as he says, but if your eye be mixed or evil, then it causes darkness. And he says, no man can serve two masters. &gt;&gt; He comes right to it. It's the double-mindedness. the the double tongedness and you cannot serve two masters for either you will hate the one and love the other or else he will hold to the one and despise the other and this is just a natural uh uh rule it's saying you cannot have literally two masters &gt;&gt; in natural but he says to this you cannot serve God and mammon &gt;&gt; so if what you are filtering for is is mammon and what you want is mammon and things out of the world he says CAN'T YOU CAN'T USE THAT KIND OF GOAL, THAT KIND OF AMBITION, THAT KIND OF FILTER AND PLEASE THE LORD. &gt;&gt; There has to BE THIS SINGULAR OBJECTIVE OF pleasing God. I want to I want to be a light. I want to be a Christian. I want to do THESE THINGS CORRECTLY. YOU CANNOT SERVE GOD AND MAMMON. There can't be THIS DUPLICITY OF MOTIVE and objective. &gt;&gt; There can't be this double-mindedness in the sermon of thinking men's filter says blindly to see. How blind can we get? Blind lay to see of the blind leading the blind of this age under false pretense under false creeds under dogmas that's false under denominations that's false under creeds books that's false oh blind le to see leading the blind you're all headed for the ditch he says change your filter tonight preacher &gt;&gt; all you preachers &gt;&gt; change your filter I kept saying that so much to myself the last week or so that I in my mind I kept thinking my title was change your filter and could have well been. We could go and post and filter out the original title, but a filter change is what I'm presenting tonight. &gt;&gt; And he says, change your filter. &gt;&gt; Don't draw that denominational nicotine into your system of dogmas and creeds. &gt;&gt; Which Jesus said, whosoever shall add one word to it or take one word from it. &gt;&gt; I I want to take the God the word of God in its purity. &gt;&gt; I don't want anything mixed in it or laced in it. I don't want anything added to it. The word of God, the stimulation of revelation does something. It intoxicates the believer. It gives you strength. The word OF GOD IS A LIGHT. IT HAS POWER AND IT HAS PURPOSE. YOU FILTER IT, IT LOSES ITS POWER. The word OF GOD IS THESE WATERS OF UH UH of washing and waters OF SEPARATION. YOU FILTER IT, it loses its power. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he make he has this prayer at the close of the sermon. He says, "Let me plant the word of God in my heart and purpose that I'll not turn to the right hand nor to the left away from it, but I'll live true to it all the days of my life. &gt;&gt; Plant the word of God in my heart." Been exploring a lot of these principles of the seed and the growing and the gardening. Plant the word in my heart and in purpose to not vary that it might I might live true. Oh father, think of this. He says, "Oh Father God, then send down upon me the Holy Spirit of life to quicken those words to me that I might manifest Jesus Christ before those who are before me." &gt;&gt; You said, "That's my prayer. &gt;&gt; Lord, plant the word of God on my heart and quicken it by the Holy Spirit that I might manifest Jesus Christ to those who are before me." Amen. &gt;&gt; If that's going to have happen, then the word has to find good ground. &gt;&gt; And the and the light of God's word and the waters of God's word has to reach that seed unfiltered. And anything else mixed in could contaminate it, impede its growth, harm its growth. So you need a word filter. So Sunday we talk about word upon word, the right kind of support. If you're going to paint a picture, you want to have a word support to paint your word picture. And you don't want to have word support and then paint your own human picture on top of it. It's got to be word upon word that I might manifest. How is it you're going to be light when the light that is in thee can shine forth? &gt;&gt; And how is the light in you going to get brighter and more intense as the word of God filters out all the darkness and all the impediments and all the things that get in the way and allows the word of God to almost lighten off that mirror. your life becomes a magnifying glass for that dynamic power of God's word to now it could express and manifest out. &gt;&gt; I'm going to go ahead and close with this. This is the part that I was going to maybe uh keep out, but it's from um a devotion that we use as a family and one that I came across one time and I find this writer George Mat just to be an incredibly gifted writer. Uh he suffered a lot in his life. U just an incredible testimony. He wrote he wrote a a book called rest by the river and it's published in 1906. I'm just going to read this chapter and he uses uh the scripture let your light so shine or uh the um if the darkness the light of the body is the eye if therefore thine eye be single thy whole body shall be full of light. He takes it from Matthew there 6:22 and he says our lord says that when a man looks at the sunshine it is not only his eye that is affected. You just listen with me here. I don't know that you're able to read this. His whole body is influenced by the light. His pulse is quickened. Listen, science to tell you today that you're supposed to get so much sunlight, at least for your vitamin D, right? There the the not the vitamin depression, but vitamin D. Get out there. Get in the light. Right? Get out there. Feel it. It's going to do something for your body. His pulse is quickened. His blood is accelerated. His step is lightened. His arm is strengthened. His voice is vivified. Even so, Christ says that in the moral world, everything depends on what a man looks at. &gt;&gt; You listening? &gt;&gt; I I'll pick up on this on Sunday and then you all will already kind of be in the channel and the amens will be in sync. He says his ideal. I want to relate that kind of to the filter. What an eye be what you're beholding HIS IDEAL. HE SAYS THAT THE GREAT QUESTION IS WHAT IS THAT picture of heroism which you have set before your inward eye? What is it you admire? WHAT IS IT YOU SEE BEAUTY IN? What is it you like? He exclaims in effect, it is no use to lay down rules of morality. WHAT IS YOUR MODEL OF PERFECTION, YOUR IDEAL of beauty, your standard of excellence? &gt;&gt; Everything depends on that. &gt;&gt; Talking about an acquired taste. &gt;&gt; Something that you've you've learned to appreciate. I used to not like to drink at all, but you know, man, now I've kind of got this acquired taste for just really good tasting alcohol beer. And you're kind of like, I think the beer company's probably deceived you, too. I want to introduce you to tobacco company, &gt;&gt; right? [clears throat] He says everything depends on that. Not your laws of morality, not the restrictive access, but he says what's your model of perfection? What's your standard of excellence? What's your ideal? What's your model of beauty? Says if you admire that which is really noble, the picture before the eye will permeate the whole life. What you admire, what you look at, what you allow yourself to take in will permeate the whole life. If you admire that which is mean and debasing, the picture before the eye will corrupt the entire nature. Mean and debasing, we have just summarized the internet, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Two words, three. mean and debasing. &gt;&gt; Social media, &gt;&gt; politics, that's what's before your eye. He says the picture before the eye will corrupt the entire nature. You want to know why our natures feel a little bit rough? Yes, it's social media. It's Tik Tok. It's news. It's politics. &gt;&gt; Show me what a man is looking at and I will show you what his life will be. &gt;&gt; Tell me his favorite author, his favorite artist, his favorite pleasure, and I'll tell you where his strength or weakness lies. I'M GOING TO BE PASSING OUT A QUESTIONNAIRE on Sunday. You guys got you guys to SEE IF YOU PASS THE TEST. Bring him into a room. I'll say this. Don't if you really like a Christian song, don't find out what that artist's favorite artist is because you'll be like, who's Beiance? And what is that anyways? Is this guy Taylor Swift a trucker? And you find out these people you really like to listen to their FAVORITE ARTIST AND WHAT'S WATERING THEIR SPIRITS. &gt;&gt; There's no lick of Christianity in it. &gt;&gt; I heard a song the other day and I was just struck by how beautiful it was, how the poetry, the message. I was stunned. It was Bob Dylan and it [laughter] was done by a Christian artist I like. And so I had to check if it was after Bob Dylan's conversion and he had become a born again Christian. So I was like, "All right, I can mainline this for a couple weeks." No, it just shows there's certain things that YOU DON'T REALIZE WHAT THE INFLUENCE IS. &gt;&gt; TELL ME HIS FAVORITE AUTHOR, HIS FAVORITE ARTIST, HIS FAVORITE PLEASURE. I'LL TELL YOU WHERE HIS STRENGTH or weakness lies. &gt;&gt; Bring him into A ROOM CROWDED WITH PICTURES and watch where his eye first lights and longest lingers. &gt;&gt; There will his heart be also. It is in the direction of the eye that you must seek the aim of the life. So he says, "Beware ye mothers and teachers how you furnish the halls of fancy." &gt;&gt; This is where it gets real. &gt;&gt; That was all poetry. Now this is practical application. Beware how you furnish your halls of fancy. Beware what ideal you suggest to the admiration of the child. &gt;&gt; One of the words that's used in our household is what are we promoting? They say, "Well, we're not promoters, but what is it we have set before our children that they begin to admire?" &gt;&gt; DO NOT point to Cain and say, "I have gotten a man from the Lord." If to the young eye, you make Cain a hero, you will soon, to the young heart, make violence heroic. &gt;&gt; This has such deep application. I hope you're making your applications. I hope you're thinking about the ideals that you set before your children and what you're making heroic. what you're putting before them and even ourselves and allow us to see beauty in it and that's what we're beholding and that's WHAT PERMEATES LIFE. DO NOT POINT TO A PHYSICAL CONQUEROR AND SAY THAT IS THE MESSIAH. &gt;&gt; IF THE POWER THAT CRUSHES BECOMES BEAUTIFUL, it'll airong seem beautiful. IF THE POWER THAT CRUSHES BECOMES BEAUTIFUL, WE WILL FEEL IT IS OUR duty to crush. And is that not how the word has been misrepresented to some? Therefore, they feel it is their duty that they must crush. Come on. &gt;&gt; DO NOT POINT TO THE COVETOUS MAN AND SAY, "THERE GOES JUST LOT." If you make selfishness an ideal, it'll soon become a practice. &gt;&gt; Point the child to the greatness of some things deemed foolish. Point him to the man of Calvary and say, "What a strength was there." &gt;&gt; This is what ought to be the filter in our lives. This is what should be the ideal. This is what we behold. This is what we promote IN OUR HOMES. SHOW HIM THE SACREDNESS OF SACRIFICE, THE POWER OF PITY, THE kingliness of being kind. Tell him that there may be an inf infancy over w which the angels sing. Hours of childhood which are about the father's business. Days of tender youth in which the very heavens are opened. Seasons of wilderness want which are themselves the ministration of God. Moments of death in which a soul has saved the world. That's beautiful. Tell him there's an infancy over which the angels sing. A childhood which is tender and about the father's business. Days of youth in which the very heavens are opened. Seasons of the wilderness want the desires in the wilderness which are themselves God ministering in moments of death in which a soul has saved the world. Where do we learn all that? Christ &gt;&gt; revealed to him the majesty of the manger and the coronation of the cross. My Christ must be crowned heir. I can serve him. Crowned beforehand, crowned to the eye. In vain you will point to Calvary. If you teach me first, that self-surrender is a shameful thing. In vain YOU WILL CRY, "FOLLOW JESUS." IF YOU'VE IMPRESSED me with the notion that meekness is cowardness, that mercy is weakness, that purity is effeminate, that grief is unmanly, that peacemaking is unheroic. You must guide the eye air. YOU GUIDE THE STEPS BEFORE YOU PREACH CHRIST. CROWN HIM LORD OF ALL. WREATH CALVARY WITH FLOWERS. FILL GETHSEMANE WITH MUSIC. STRE THE DOLORES WAY WITH PALM LEAVES. WRITE IN GOLDEN LETTERS THE OLD OLD STORY. LET IT APPEAL FIRST TO THE EYE TO THE ADMIRATION. ENCIRCLE ITS CLOUDS WITH THE RAINBOW. Let its tears even while they fall glitter in the sun. Let the star of Bethlehem lead me up the heights of Golgtha. You will imprint Christ upon my life when you have made him beautiful to my eye. &gt;&gt; There's my calling. &gt;&gt; There's my prayer. Christ will be imprinted even on my children's life when I make him beautiful to their eye. Christ will be imprinted upon someone's life when he has been made beautiful to your eye. And he says, "Crown him first." To me, it speaks to that filter before it strikes the sensor, before it strikes the film. I want him for what he is, his glory and his majesty. I want it to reflect. I want the beauty of that to be imprinted upon me. &gt;&gt; I hope we could take these things to heart and maybe we could just take a little look at what kind of filters we've been using. &gt;&gt; And it could just be as simple tonight as a filter change. Because the word of God is still powerful. &gt;&gt; Experience is still in your heart, but just a a filter, the wrong kind of filter changes what you see and what you express. If we could stand tonight, musicians, as you come, thank you for your attention. Beautiful spirit that you all created. You will imprint Christ upon my life when you have made him beautiful to my eye. Lord, help us. My prayer then is is Lord, plant the word of God in my heart. Water it with your spirit that I could live true to it every day of my life and manifest Christ to those who are before me. If you need prayer tonight, just pray to him. Lift your hands. If you need special prayer, with our heads bowed, our gracious heavenly father, Lord, there's an inexhaustible fountain that we could come to [music] tonight and we can ask for living water and you'll give us that water of life freely. You said that we could come and ask for wisdom and you give it liberally, Lord, that you will not uprade us for asking. And Lord, we realize that when it's preached, it seems kind we're just so clear and these bright lines of filter, no filter, or the word of God is a filter and the wrong kind of filter. But I realize, Lord, that in application, it can get muddy. But Lord, we can pray tonight that Lord, I want your glory to be seen on me. And Lord, in order for you to be seen on me, then I must see you. And whatever's gotten in the way, Lord, remove it. Whatever's getting in the way, Lord, remove it. Whatever door in my heart is closed, Lord, open it, Lord. Serve that search warrant. Kick down the doors, Lord. Just go through my heart. Explore, Lord. Let the light just go through and reprove and manifest. Father, if there's a wall that I've built in my heart that's not loadbearing, that's only keeping you out, just take it out, Lord. And Lord, may all these worldly filters and all these bushels and all these complexes and fears that I've just used to gum up the light that should be shining into my soul, but oh Lord, even worse, the light that's in there not getting out. Lord, remove it. For you cannot be seen through me until you see through me. And Lord, come [music] just as you are in your glory and in your word and in your power. Heal us of anything that's scarred up, anything that's in the way, any channel that's clogged so the light can shine in. And Lord, may we then reflect back your life, your light, [music] your attitude. May we take these words to heart. Commit the people to you. Every hand that was raised, all the desires that are in these people's hearts, may you lead them and guide them. We love you. We ask this in the name of Lord Jesus Christ. [music] Amen.
