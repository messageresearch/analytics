[0:00] romans chapter 5 verses 12 to 19.
[0:04] romans chapter 5 verses 12 to 19.
[0:09] it says wherefore as by one man sin
[0:12] entered into the world
[0:13] and death by sin and so death passed
[0:16] upon all men
[0:17] for that all have sinned for until the
[0:20] law sin was in the world
[0:21] but sin is not imputed where there is no
[0:23] law
[0:24] nevertheless death reigned from adam to
[0:27] moses
[0:28] even over them that had not sinned after
[0:30] the similitude of adam's transgression
[0:32] they had not
[0:33] committed the same act or were not
[0:35] present and complicit in it
[0:37] but he says who is the figure of him
[0:39] that was to come
[0:41] but not as the offense so also is the
[0:44] free gift
[0:45] for through the offense of one many be
[0:47] dead much more the grace of god and the
[0:50] gift by grace which is by one man jesus
[0:52] christ
[0:53] hath abounded unto many i'm sure you
[0:54] understand the emphasis that paul is
[0:56] making
[0:57] he's comparing adam to jesus christ it's
[1:00] a very interesting contrast compare and
[1:02] contrast
[1:02] and not as it was by one that sinned so
[1:05] was the gift
[1:06] for the judgment was by one to
[1:08] condemnation but the free gift is of
[1:10] many offenses unto justification
[1:13] forth by one man's offense death reigned
[1:15] by one much more they which receive
[1:17] abundance of grace
[1:18] and the gift of righteousness shall
[1:20] reign in life by one
[1:22] jesus christ therefore as by the offense
[1:24] of one judgment came upon all men to
[1:26] condemnation
[1:27] even so by the righteousness of one free
[1:30] gift
[1:31] came upon all men unto justification of
[1:33] life
[1:34] for as by one man's disobedience many
[1:36] were made sinners so by the obedience of
[1:38] one shall many be made righteous
[1:40] moreover the law entered that the
[1:42] offense might abound
[1:43] but were sin abounded grace did much
[1:45] more abound and we know he deals with
[1:46] this in the next chapter
[1:48] do we send that so there's more grace
[1:49] god forbid he says that is sin
[1:52] hath reigned unto death even so might
[1:55] grace reign through righteousness
[1:57] unto eternal life by jesus christ our
[2:01] lord amen you may be seated
[2:09] i was tremendously blessed by the the
[2:13] special sister wendy saying
[2:15] and really just uh i felt the presence
[2:17] of the lord come behind it just
[2:19] immediately and it was a tremendous
[2:21] strength and
[2:22] confirmation to me just gave me courage
[2:24] to uh to take the word of the lord and
[2:26] just deliver it
[2:28] uh with confidence today because i mean
[2:30] that could have very well been the title
[2:32] of what i would ministering today is
[2:34] down from his glory
[2:36] and it's just wonderful you'll see how
[2:37] we start here in the beginning
[2:40] we're continuing on the subject of god
[2:42] created
[2:43] and i i apologize if it
[2:46] seems like i'm jumping right into the
[2:48] middle of something but we were
[2:50] last time we walked through last service
[2:52] we walked through
[2:53] the uh first chapter of the book of the
[2:55] bible genesis chapter one
[2:57] and in doing so we were showing things
[3:00] in the first three chapters
[3:01] and a comparison to the last three
[3:03] chapters of
[3:04] the book of revelation and and so
[3:07] we've we went verse by verse and it was
[3:09] kind of laying a foundation
[3:10] for what was on my heart uh for the next
[3:14] few services and i was wanting to take
[3:16] chapter two
[3:17] and just go verse by verse but i just
[3:20] feel
[3:20] so overwhelmed in this way just to kind
[3:23] of take it
[3:24] from just kind of the sow the seeds of
[3:25] it and take it from a ten thousand foot
[3:27] view
[3:28] and then go back and go specifically
[3:30] through chapters 2 and chapter 3 verse
[3:32] by verse
[3:33] lord willing and it's become more
[3:36] and more uh profound to me how that the
[3:39] first three chapters of genesis are
[3:41] necessary
[3:42] to understand god and his purpose and
[3:45] one of the key things that we were
[3:46] identifying last time is god is laying a
[3:48] pattern
[3:49] and brother branham even identified how
[3:50] that god was foreshadowing things and he
[3:52] was sowing seeds and
[3:53] it was a pre-figure and things god was
[3:56] doing things even in the six days of
[3:57] creation
[3:58] in the seventh day of rest that the
[4:00] bible says it was a pattern
[4:02] that was later followed in worship and
[4:04] and taking the sabbath day
[4:06] and so there's there's god was laying
[4:08] something down and a track so to speak
[4:11] we looked at the trail of redemption and
[4:14] how
[4:14] brother brahma identified and began to
[4:15] talk about the the beast at the
[4:17] beginning the beast at the end and the
[4:19] trail of the serpent
[4:20] but there was this trail of christ that
[4:22] we can see from the
[4:23] genesis to revelation and to understand
[4:27] god's relationship to man we truly need
[4:31] an
[4:31] understanding of the creation and the
[4:34] fall of it
[4:35] and it's as i study this and just labor
[4:39] in looking at this
[4:40] becomes apparent that the the brand of
[4:42] christianity that exists
[4:44] uh that pervades in most churches and
[4:46] most people's understanding
[4:48] is one that's so narrow to the true
[4:50] purpose of god
[4:52] that it salvation has really lost its
[4:54] true meaning and god's relationship to
[4:56] man has been lost
[4:57] i want to start with romans chapter 3
[4:59] verse 23
[5:00] and in reading this scripture use
[5:03] something that may be familiar to all
[5:07] it might resonate in terms of what
[5:08] salvation is and
[5:10] and if you were to witness to somebody
[5:12] and they didn't know god
[5:13] then you you might actually say
[5:15] something to the effect of well all have
[5:16] sinned and fallen short of the glory of
[5:18] god
[5:19] and so you would you would start with
[5:21] this scripture
[5:22] for someone to recognize their need for
[5:24] repentance their need for redemption
[5:25] their need for a savior
[5:27] and as it said i just quoted it just uh
[5:29] so readily for all have sinned and come
[5:31] short of the glory of god i just want to
[5:33] use that phrasing there
[5:36] and ponder this because there's a
[5:37] there's a deep truth that's contained in
[5:39] this
[5:40] for all have sinned so there's none that
[5:42] have not sinned
[5:44] and in this sinning they've come short
[5:46] of the glory of god
[5:47] now we know that sin uh entered into
[5:50] satan
[5:51] and we looked at this in isaiah chapter
[5:52] 14 so we could see that sin
[5:54] or iniquity began in satan but then it
[5:57] was brought into creation
[5:59] through adam and it says in romans
[6:01] chapter 5 verse 12
[6:03] wherefore as by one man sin entered into
[6:06] the world
[6:07] and death by sin and so death passed
[6:10] upon
[6:11] all men for that all have sinned so this
[6:14] sin which says all have sinned
[6:16] it's because of adam says death passed
[6:19] upon all men
[6:20] by one man's sin enters into the world
[6:23] and by this man centering in
[6:25] sin entering in death passes upon all
[6:28] men so we have
[6:29] all come into this world as sinners all
[6:31] have sinned and come
[6:33] short of the glory of god so we see all
[6:36] men are sinners
[6:37] through adam we all become sinners and
[6:39] therefore being sinners we're under the
[6:41] judgment or penalty of death
[6:43] and it says come short of the glory of
[6:45] god
[6:46] now this is not solely a reference to
[6:48] god's praise of man can we say
[6:50] all uh all men have sinned for all have
[6:52] sinned
[6:53] and come short of god's uh compliment or
[6:56] god's praise or
[6:57] or god's satisfaction and you could use
[7:00] that phrasing
[7:02] to uh to the phrase
[7:05] fallen short of the glory of god to
[7:06] express that sentiment that god is
[7:07] displeased with the sin of man
[7:09] but it's not a reference merely to god's
[7:12] pleasure in man
[7:13] but rather it's a reference to god's
[7:15] image
[7:16] for all of sin and falls short of god's
[7:19] glory or god likeness
[7:21] and also a man has now fallen short of
[7:24] what he was originally
[7:25] intended to be for the scripture says in
[7:27] first corinthians 11
[7:28] 7 as he which is the man is the image
[7:31] and glory of god
[7:33] so paul teaches us that the man is the
[7:36] image and glory of god but yet when you
[7:37] see mankind today
[7:39] you're not getting the full reflection
[7:41] and manifestation of the attributes of
[7:43] god
[7:44] there could be some similitude in
[7:45] certain similarities
[7:47] but then we know that god is not like
[7:48] man that he would lie
[7:50] and there's a lot of things about man
[7:51] that we know are not in the image of god
[7:53] so when paul says all have sinned
[7:55] and come short of the glory of god they
[7:57] have fallen short
[7:58] of this image that they were to be in
[8:01] they are no longer god-like
[8:03] it's no longer the divine image that's
[8:04] being expressed
[8:06] and in genesis chapter 1 verse 26 and 27
[8:10] and we're reading a lot of the same
[8:11] scriptures but i feel that
[8:13] we're coming from just a little bit
[8:15] different angle to where i'm not just
[8:17] repeating myself
[8:18] it says and god said as we've looked at
[8:20] this in great detail for these through
[8:22] these several services
[8:24] god said let us make man in our image
[8:28] and our likeness and it says and let
[8:31] them have dominion over the fish of the
[8:33] sea and over the fowl of the air
[8:35] and over all and over the cattle and
[8:37] over all the earth
[8:38] and over every creeping thing that
[8:39] creepeth on the earth
[8:41] so this dominion as god describes it
[8:44] notice what description he gives man
[8:46] very quickly
[8:47] if we make him in our image and in our
[8:48] likeness now i've got to empower him
[8:51] i've got to give him something
[8:53] that is also god-like so this dominion
[8:55] in government
[8:56] is essential to god's image had adam
[8:59] been made
[9:00] uh had been made in the image of god and
[9:02] not granted this dominion
[9:04] then that would say something about
[9:05] god's likeness or god's power
[9:08] but he's made in the bible continues so
[9:10] god created man
[9:11] in his own image in the image of god
[9:14] created he him
[9:15] male and female created he them and
[9:18] again
[9:19] that part we've gone we looked at very
[9:21] closely that is also
[9:22] an image of god a reflection of what is
[9:24] in god but this dominion this government
[9:27] this power
[9:28] to have dominion over the fish over the
[9:29] fowl over the cattle over all the earth
[9:32] and over every creeping thing upon the
[9:34] earth this is part of the
[9:36] image of god and it's part of the divine
[9:38] nature as adam is placed upon earth and
[9:40] he becomes a god upon the earth
[9:42] so he says god now we're pondering this
[9:46] god made man then in his own image god
[9:49] created man
[9:50] in his own image so this is the original
[9:53] description of the composition of man
[9:56] how he's constituted his makeup
[9:58] you can say his character his nature his
[10:00] instincts his impulse his thinking
[10:03] god made man created man in the
[10:05] beginning god created man in his own
[10:07] image
[10:08] this is the composition of man and
[10:10] brother branham says in the message
[10:12] fundamental foundation for faith
[10:14] man was made as a secondary god on earth
[10:19] he was given the power to control all
[10:21] things all
[10:22] elements of the earth all elements
[10:25] of the earth so he's given power to
[10:27] control but it's not
[10:29] it's not well you can control this cow
[10:31] and you can control that dog all the
[10:32] elements
[10:34] all the atoms all the molecules
[10:35] everything that would uh come together
[10:37] to comprise these elements he's given
[10:39] power
[10:40] over them and he says that was adam
[10:43] adam was given and i want you to kind of
[10:46] grasp a hold of this phrase adam was
[10:48] given these great powers
[10:51] so adam is constituted a certain way he
[10:54] has a certain composition a makeup a
[10:56] character attributes
[10:58] this becomes part of who he is and this
[11:00] is in him
[11:01] because of his god-likeness because of a
[11:03] divine quality
[11:05] and so he's given these great powers so
[11:07] god has granted it to him
[11:09] and then notice how brother branham
[11:11] makes a connection here and this
[11:13] is where i i might just be amplifying
[11:16] this statement
[11:17] uh through the remainder of the service
[11:19] but then the power
[11:21] that he was given to make himself
[11:24] is where he fell
[11:29] dramatic pause the power he was given
[11:34] to make himself the power he was given
[11:37] to recreate the power that was granted
[11:39] him by god so you could define it anyway
[11:41] the power that was given to him it's
[11:44] through that power
[11:45] is where he fell now we know that it
[11:48] could not be according to divine
[11:50] operation or
[11:51] in other words it couldn't have been
[11:53] perfectly in the character of god
[11:55] uh we just know this by virtue of
[11:57] looking back in history
[11:58] hindsight's 2020. but we know he used
[12:01] that power
[12:02] and that's where he fell brother ram
[12:04] saying the power that was given to him
[12:05] to make himself
[12:06] is where he fell and i'm trying to be
[12:08] very deliberate my language
[12:10] as we go forward because there's such a
[12:11] tremendous uh
[12:13] truth that i want you to catch today so
[12:15] the power that he was given to make
[12:17] himself is where he fell
[12:19] in genesis 1 28 says and god blessed
[12:21] them
[12:22] and god said unto them be fruitful
[12:24] become many
[12:25] and multiply them so be fruitful just
[12:27] you're going to
[12:29] put forth seed and multiply become many
[12:31] and replenish the earth
[12:33] and subdue it so you could break this
[12:36] commandment up into two parts
[12:38] be fruitful and multiply applies to him
[12:41] uh and his image and him and the woman
[12:44] but then also there to replenish the
[12:45] earth and subdue the earth
[12:47] so there's a part of them that must be
[12:49] multiplied up to completion
[12:51] but then there's uh there's also this uh
[12:54] portion that relates to the earth to
[12:56] subdue it and
[12:57] replenish the earth and this is an
[12:59] all-or-nothing provision
[13:02] brother branham said the power that he
[13:04] was given to make himself is where he
[13:05] fell
[13:06] be fruitful multiply and replenish the
[13:07] earth and subdue it we saw this in
[13:09] genesis 1 22 this is the power
[13:12] to procreate this is the power to make
[13:14] himself
[13:15] and so this is to fulfill this you have
[13:17] to do all the ends
[13:19] so this is an all or not nothing
[13:21] provision it wasn't be fruitful
[13:22] or multiply or replenish the earth orbs
[13:25] to do it
[13:26] if it was ore you could just get one and
[13:28] say we did it
[13:30] right just like they say wash your hands
[13:32] or wear a mask
[13:34] right then we would all just say clean
[13:35] hands but it's not a it's not a
[13:38] this wasn't an either or this was all or
[13:40] nothing it was an and
[13:42] be more be fruitful and multiply and
[13:45] replenish
[13:46] the earth and subdue the earth and so
[13:49] this prophecy whether it be multiply and
[13:51] re um
[13:51] be fruitful and multiply or replenish
[13:53] and subdue the earth and specifically
[13:56] i want you to ponder this replenish and
[13:59] subdue the earth
[14:01] this is prophecy brother branham called
[14:04] it an oncoming thing
[14:05] a promise so it was a promise and since
[14:07] it was oncoming it was prophecy
[14:11] and it's this word which is the original
[14:13] seed
[14:15] this is the seed this is something
[14:16] that's original god spoken word
[14:18] and when it says the scripture says and
[14:20] god blessed them
[14:22] the phrasing that's used and the word
[14:24] that she's god bless them it's not like
[14:25] bless your heart or god you know
[14:27] and just saying something over them but
[14:29] god in blessing them is communicating to
[14:31] them
[14:32] the ability to reproduce this is the
[14:35] blessing
[14:36] the blessing wasn't you know i hope your
[14:38] days are long and you have sandy shores
[14:41] and
[14:42] and it's always 75 degrees with no
[14:43] humidity and that would just be a wish
[14:45] right i just wish you well i'm just
[14:47] blessing you god bless you uh
[14:48] safe travels but rather this is a
[14:51] communication
[14:52] of a divine a covenant the blessing
[14:56] is a divine covenant for their
[14:58] continuance
[14:59] it says he blessed them and he said unto
[15:02] them so him speaking to them it becomes
[15:04] the covenant then
[15:05] the spoken word of god which grants them
[15:08] power
[15:09] and so the word which we call a blessing
[15:11] and it's it's a phrase as a blessing the
[15:13] blessing the blessing
[15:14] the word communicated to adam by god
[15:17] speaking it
[15:18] the spoken word empowered adam or gave
[15:21] adam a basis to place his faith
[15:24] and be able to reproduce so it was
[15:26] spoken beforehand that adam could take
[15:29] himself make himself subject to that
[15:30] word
[15:31] and so the blessing gave him the ability
[15:33] to increase
[15:34] gave him the ability to satisfy and
[15:36] subdue the earth's purpose
[15:38] because god blessed him and in giving
[15:40] them the blessing
[15:41] it's communicated by the original spoken
[15:43] word adam the power
[15:45] to be fruitful to multiply and then
[15:47] replenish the earth
[15:49] and subdue the earth so this was power
[15:52] then
[15:53] to reproduce the image of god if adam is
[15:56] made in the image of god and after the
[15:57] likeness of god then this power that's
[15:59] conveyed to him
[16:00] is to reproduce god likeness
[16:04] and so adam had the potential of divine
[16:09] power
[16:10] and it laid within him be fruitful
[16:14] multiply replenish the earth he's told
[16:17] that he's going to have and we'll come
[16:18] to it
[16:18] maybe here in a moment he's going to
[16:19] have dominion he's going to subdue he's
[16:21] going to have control
[16:22] he i've given you these things this is
[16:24] god conferring upon him a blessing
[16:26] god given him power and so this divine
[16:28] power laid within
[16:30] adam power to impart life
[16:34] power to bring forth power to multiply
[16:37] power to replenish power to subdue
[16:39] it's all laying in there so this divine
[16:42] power if i could put this way existed
[16:44] deep within adam
[16:46] it's deep inside of him it's there it's
[16:48] laying there it's part of the image of
[16:50] god
[16:51] but yet it's not developed the power
[16:54] lays within them but it hasn't been
[16:55] manifested
[16:57] it's hidden or concealed and we could
[16:59] see that this great power that he was
[17:01] given to make himself
[17:03] could not be expressed unless there was
[17:05] a woman
[17:06] so it laid within him as a potential and
[17:08] a possibility
[17:10] as even an oncoming promise but yet it
[17:12] had yet to be
[17:13] manifested or developed so it's hidden
[17:15] it's concealed if i could put it this
[17:17] way it's as if the power
[17:19] is in the seed but it lays dormant
[17:23] and in the principle of a seed you can
[17:24] take a seed and the life is in there and
[17:26] it can lay dormant for
[17:28] thousands of years but once
[17:31] germatized it will bring out whatever's
[17:33] in the seed
[17:34] so the power is in the word the power is
[17:36] in the seed adam is given possession of
[17:39] it
[17:39] and it lays dormant until the time the
[17:42] right season
[17:44] it's got to come forth in the right
[17:45] season now so adam
[17:48] conferred with this divine power to be
[17:50] fruitful
[17:51] multiply replenish the earth and subdue
[17:53] it
[17:54] we know that he acts to bring forth
[17:58] and he has he has a son abel and we see
[18:00] that he has other sons so these acts
[18:03] according to what we would think was
[18:04] being fruitful and multiplying
[18:06] so in genesis chapter 3 verse 22
[18:10] it says in the lord god said behold
[18:14] the man is become as one of us
[18:17] to know good and evil and now
[18:20] lest he put forth his hand and take also
[18:22] the tree of life and eat
[18:24] and live forever so i'm just going to
[18:26] stop there because i want to
[18:29] i want to take out of this before the
[18:32] scripture continues and i think we're
[18:34] going to pick up on it here in a moment
[18:36] in uh in verses 23 and 24 because it
[18:39] says therefore the lord god so god acts
[18:41] because
[18:42] of this but take what the preface is and
[18:44] what he says
[18:46] the man is become of one of us as one of
[18:48] us to know good and evil
[18:50] so he says lest he put forth his hand
[18:53] and in doing so
[18:54] take also the tree of life and in taking
[18:56] of the tree of life eat
[18:57] and live forever therefore so by god's
[19:01] own words if you could follow this and
[19:03] if see if i'm going slow and i'm
[19:06] and if i'm going slow it's a miracle in
[19:08] itself but i'm wanting just to
[19:10] be very patient to emphasize this by
[19:12] god's own words the man
[19:14] has become as one of us man has further
[19:17] become something
[19:18] in the image of god you catch that
[19:22] man was made in the image of god after
[19:24] he made man he said this is very good so
[19:26] man was in the image of god
[19:28] but yet there was more to be developed
[19:32] that we this is very simple genesis
[19:34] chapter 2 is what unfolds this and
[19:35] reveals to us
[19:36] though creed god rest in the seventh day
[19:38] and everything's created there's still
[19:40] more that needed to be manifested more
[19:41] that needed to be expressed
[19:43] and by god's own words he's saying man
[19:45] has now done
[19:46] something to make him more like us
[19:48] because he says man has become as one of
[19:50] us he has done something
[19:52] to further develop this image and he's
[19:54] now further in the image of god
[19:56] so adam's image was perfect in creation
[20:00] he couldn't speak anything against him
[20:02] he was granted powers which was the
[20:03] blessing to
[20:04] make him god-like in earth but genesis
[20:08] chapter 3
[20:08] shows us that through free moral agency
[20:11] adam
[20:12] exercises his god-given power but in
[20:15] doing so
[20:16] it brought death by free moral agency
[20:19] he's made a free moral agent through his
[20:21] own
[20:21] uh free will he acts according to this
[20:24] god-given power
[20:26] but being misplaced it doesn't produce
[20:29] what the seed was supposed to produce so
[20:32] you're introduced
[20:33] very quickly in the bible the the the
[20:36] the sin of mixing something
[20:39] if you take the original and change it
[20:41] it can't reproduce itself
[20:43] and so genesis chapter 3 shows that that
[20:45] adam's act of free will
[20:47] was an unfolding of a power that god had
[20:49] given them
[20:50] but it brought misery it brought woe it
[20:52] brought suffering it brought death
[20:55] now if you've if i've been able to make
[20:58] myself clear and i have a lot of
[20:59] confidence in your ability to follow
[21:01] so if it's not clear i i shoulder the
[21:03] blame
[21:05] if we could be looking at a picture now
[21:07] we're adam in genesis chapter one
[21:10] and even chapter two comes forth it's
[21:12] the picture is developing the picture's
[21:14] developing
[21:15] adam and the woman in the garden every
[21:17] seed bringing forth of its kind
[21:19] everything is placed perfectly and now
[21:22] man acts in genesis 3
[21:24] in god's responses man has become as one
[21:27] of us
[21:29] now and then what what transpires as a
[21:32] result of that is
[21:33] misery woe suffering death disease you
[21:36] name it
[21:38] right now i want you to consider this
[21:43] could have god been fully expressed
[21:48] if adam only ever knew the garden of
[21:50] eden
[21:52] this is where it just this is where i
[21:55] want you just to ponder that
[21:57] could have god ever truly been made
[21:59] known
[22:01] if all adam ever knew was the perfection
[22:03] of the garden
[22:05] perfect love perfect understanding of
[22:07] the love of god perfect fellowship
[22:09] everything perfectly in operation
[22:13] so let's think about this phrase then
[22:16] the man is become
[22:17] as one of us man had developed
[22:20] we could say even evolved to something
[22:23] that was closer to god
[22:26] in genesis chapter 3 verse 5 notice what
[22:29] satan says he says for god don't know
[22:32] this is in the temptation of the woman
[22:34] for god doth know that in the day you
[22:35] eat thereof
[22:37] then your eyes shall be opened and you
[22:39] shall be as gods
[22:41] knowing good and evil we can say this is
[22:43] the devil's lie
[22:44] it's his promise as well the devil's
[22:47] promise is always a lie
[22:48] if he promises you to wash your car
[22:51] don't count on it
[22:52] right just don't don't bank on it it's
[22:54] not going to happen
[22:55] so his promise is a lie but yet
[22:59] the devil's promise is confirmed by
[23:02] genesis 3 22.
[23:03] notice how he says it if you the day you
[23:06] eat thereof your eyes shall be opened
[23:08] and you shall become
[23:09] as gods as elohims and god says
[23:12] the man has become one of us to know
[23:14] good and evil he's
[23:15] the the promise of satan has actually
[23:18] been confirmed
[23:20] now remember his temptation of the woman
[23:22] wasn't merely about dietary restrictions
[23:26] it wasn't about what they could eat what
[23:27] they couldn't eat are you are you gluten
[23:29] intolerant or
[23:30] are you a vegetarian what are you able
[23:31] to eat here caffeine what can you do
[23:33] it wasn't anything about that but it was
[23:36] about
[23:36] procreation it was about the tree of
[23:38] life it was about the power to create
[23:40] and so when he's talking to him
[23:41] he's trying to entice her god knows that
[23:43] the day that you
[23:44] act is a day that you'll become wiser
[23:47] your eyes will be open and you'll become
[23:48] as elohim
[23:49] and as a result you will know good and
[23:51] evil this is the devil's promise but yet
[23:53] it's a lie
[23:56] why because he he hid death from him
[24:00] and so the devil is actually referring
[24:02] to
[24:04] the growth of mankind he says if you if
[24:07] there's an
[24:08] act that you can take undertake there's
[24:09] something that you can do
[24:11] and in doing so there's going to be a
[24:13] further expression of yourself there's
[24:15] going to be a further understanding and
[24:16] enlightenment enlightenment
[24:18] so he's preaching and he's sowing
[24:19] something but it's sown in deception
[24:22] and it results in death or if i could
[24:24] say this way he hid
[24:25] he lied about the consequence which is
[24:27] death
[24:28] because man did in fact become his gods
[24:31] to no good from evil
[24:32] but yet the result and the consequence
[24:35] was death
[24:36] so he brought so the the bible says
[24:40] since man has become as one of us now
[24:43] lest he take also of the tree of life
[24:48] i i i think this is very simple but it's
[24:52] if i don't if i don't do it correctly i
[24:55] could be complicating this
[24:58] man is in a per in creation he's perfect
[25:01] but he has potentials that are not yet
[25:02] realized
[25:04] prophecies that are not yet fulfilled
[25:07] when he acts
[25:08] according to a power that he was given
[25:12] god realizes that man has now become in
[25:14] my words
[25:15] more like us there's been a further
[25:18] unfolding into the image of god
[25:21] now there's still more because he says
[25:23] lest he take also the tree of life
[25:27] it suggests there was more that could
[25:29] develop
[25:31] so he wants to stop him before in this
[25:34] condition
[25:35] he takes a hold of the tree of life and
[25:37] eats and what happens
[25:38] has eternal life because if he took of
[25:41] the tree of life and ate now all
[25:42] in everything that's represented that
[25:44] the symbolism of it it means that god
[25:46] now
[25:46] man in his condition he is going to be
[25:48] forbidden from something can go no
[25:50] further
[25:51] because the further expression the next
[25:53] expression would have to be
[25:55] the tree of life or eternal life oh my
[25:58] goodness
[25:59] this is just thrilling maybe you'll just
[26:02] watch me for the rest of the
[26:03] rest of the afternoon whoa there i just
[26:05] told you how long it will be
[26:08] morning lord willing so it's it's
[26:10] showing that there was more that could
[26:12] unfold
[26:14] and i hope my humor is not taken as a
[26:15] reverence there's nothing more
[26:17] precious than this than than you as
[26:19] god's purchase
[26:20] and the minister of the word to you
[26:22] there if he
[26:23] took hold of the tree of life he's
[26:25] already become like us
[26:26] to know good and evil now let's stop him
[26:30] lest he act further and live forever
[26:34] it is do you understand that can you
[26:36] follow that
[26:38] but since now there is a vulnerability
[26:42] or a weakness because he exercised his
[26:44] power of his own will
[26:45] god says this in verse 23 so it says now
[26:47] therefore lest he take all
[26:49] put forth his hand take also the tree of
[26:51] life eat and live forever
[26:52] because of this vulnerability that's
[26:54] crept in because when it happens
[26:56] man's fearful for the first time so now
[27:00] for the first time he feels fear
[27:02] and he you wouldn't want to act out of
[27:04] fear you can't be motivated out of fear
[27:07] so god is laying some very significant
[27:09] principles
[27:09] in the very beginning that's uh that's
[27:12] uh
[27:12] instructional to us and good for us to
[27:14] understand but because of this
[27:16] vulnerability in this weakness
[27:17] that he has now exposed himself to by
[27:20] exercising his power
[27:22] this power that got to him in his own
[27:23] time in his own will god has to do this
[27:26] and it says this in verse
[27:27] 23 and 24 therefore the lord god
[27:30] sent him forth from the garden of eden
[27:34] to kill the ground from whence he was
[27:38] taken so he drove out the man
[27:42] and he placed at the east of the garden
[27:44] of eden cherubims
[27:45] and a flaming sword which turned every
[27:47] way to keep the way of the tree of life
[27:52] i want to identify just a few things
[27:54] very quickly here
[27:55] god sent him forth from the garden so he
[27:59] drove out the man so it's god sending
[28:03] him
[28:04] it's god driving him god is the god is
[28:06] the force
[28:07] that takes man in the garden here he is
[28:09] in a perfect
[28:10] garden of eden and it's god that moves
[28:12] him out of the garden
[28:14] into the world in still in eden but yet
[28:17] not in the garden and it's perfection
[28:19] so something in the divine order had
[28:21] been upset
[28:22] at least uh to the to the optics to the
[28:25] eye
[28:26] to what we read something's been upset
[28:30] but let me emphasize this this is not
[28:33] the accident of sin
[28:38] if we if we look at god the garden of
[28:40] eden is perfection
[28:43] that perfection and then god's
[28:45] subsequent response to it being god
[28:47] moderating things and changing things
[28:49] and rearranging things and trying to
[28:51] make man suited for the fall
[28:53] and figure out redemption we're missing
[28:54] the story completely
[28:56] what begins to unfold is not the
[28:58] accident of sin but it was actually
[28:59] god's purpose
[29:01] and i know this is hard for me to
[29:03] understand completely
[29:04] but i know the more i ponder it the more
[29:06] i accept it the more i say amen to it
[29:08] the more i appreciate my salvation
[29:10] the more i fall in love with jesus
[29:12] christ to understand the plan from the
[29:14] beginning
[29:16] down from his glory so if you could
[29:19] focus
[29:20] with me very intently on this
[29:24] god led adam into the wilderness of eden
[29:29] god sent him forth god drove out the man
[29:32] and he leads him he drives him out of
[29:35] this
[29:35] garden into i want to use the phrase
[29:37] wilderness to contrast what the garden
[29:39] would have been
[29:40] to till the ground a focus on that
[29:44] it's it's god is being very deliberate
[29:47] i'm going to drive him out and he uses
[29:48] the phrase
[29:50] i'm going to drive him out and now he's
[29:52] given a purpose to till the ground from
[29:53] whence he was taken
[29:56] till the ground it speaks of the earth
[29:57] so now he says i was
[29:59] from whence he was taken now he's sent
[30:01] forth from the garden
[30:03] and now he has this task of tilling the
[30:06] ground which was the origin of his body
[30:11] in genesis chapter 2 verse 5 god says
[30:14] this
[30:16] and i'm looking at this to understand
[30:17] that this is god's not
[30:19] genesis chapter 3 and four and the rest
[30:21] of the bible is not god
[30:23] readjusting and it took him two thousand
[30:26] years or four thousand years to finally
[30:27] figure out oh
[30:28] finally i figured it out we need to send
[30:30] a savior
[30:32] there's it was all laid out from the
[30:35] beginning
[30:36] so look it says he sent out to chill the
[30:39] ground from which he was taken notice
[30:40] what god says in genesis chapter 2 verse
[30:42] 5.
[30:43] and every plant of the field before it
[30:45] was in the earth
[30:46] and every herb of the field before it
[30:48] grew for the lord
[30:50] god had not caused it to rain upon the
[30:52] earth and there was not
[30:53] man to kill the ground
[30:57] so when god has kind of given a
[30:58] description of the generations of the
[31:00] creation of heavens and earth
[31:02] and he's wanting you to understand the
[31:04] condition of things and how seeds were
[31:05] sown and i
[31:06] this is when i'll go back to this when
[31:07] we go through this verse by verse
[31:10] what i want you to catch is that before
[31:12] the fall
[31:13] god places man as a tiller of the ground
[31:18] so this is part of his constitution
[31:21] especially in light of the blessing in
[31:24] black
[31:25] in light of his powers and light of his
[31:27] commission god is going it says he says
[31:29] before the
[31:30] herb was in the field before it grew
[31:32] before anything was coming forth
[31:34] before it's in the earth or before it's
[31:35] manifesting he says before
[31:37] man had even come to till the ground and
[31:38] it continues to describe these things
[31:40] but god before the fall man is being
[31:44] described as one who's going to till the
[31:46] ground
[31:46] so in genesis chapter 2 verse 5 15 sorry
[31:50] in the lord god took the man and put him
[31:53] in the garden of eden
[31:55] so as it says in genesis chapter 3 god
[31:57] drove the man out of the garden of eden
[31:59] he sent
[32:00] him out to till the ground but notice it
[32:01] says he took the man
[32:03] put him in the guard of eden to dress
[32:06] which is the same word as till
[32:08] and to keep it so he's called
[32:11] he says man is to till the ground and
[32:13] when man is going to be brought forth
[32:15] he places him in the garden of eden and
[32:18] he has a purpose his purpose is
[32:20] to dress the garden which is to till it
[32:23] and to keep it
[32:25] so he has a commission then and this is
[32:28] something he must do to keep he must
[32:30] preserve he must protect he must
[32:32] perform keep he must perform that which
[32:34] is spoken of the earth
[32:37] he needs to till and to keep in order to
[32:39] achieve earth purpose
[32:41] there was one man that was given the
[32:43] responsibility in genesis chapter one
[32:45] and two
[32:46] to see that the earth was satisfied
[32:50] that the earth and whatever it was
[32:51] pregnant with the earth and whatever
[32:53] potentials it had
[32:54] and whatever it could do and whatever it
[32:56] could produce man was given the
[32:57] commandment you were to till the ground
[32:59] and you were to you're to dress it kill
[33:02] it and you were to keep it
[33:03] to cultivate it bring out the life in it
[33:06] preserve it
[33:07] protect it and perform it
[33:11] that's his responsibility
[33:14] i want you to look at it this way i
[33:15] trust you can see it from this
[33:17] perspective
[33:18] that god specifically equipped adam or
[33:21] gifted adam
[33:23] with abilities suited for his commission
[33:25] amen
[33:26] abilities that were suited for his
[33:28] calling he was called to dress
[33:30] and to keep so in genesis chapter 2
[33:33] verses 5 and 15
[33:36] and and we'll look at it also in genesis
[33:39] chapter one
[33:41] he is to be a tiller he's to be a
[33:43] dresser he is to be a keeper
[33:46] and this is the love of god expressed
[33:51] this is the grace of god to take man and
[33:53] give him certain attributes and
[33:55] characteristics that he would possess
[33:57] and that would be his to use
[34:00] this is the love of god being expressed
[34:04] because then god drives adam out of the
[34:06] garden
[34:10] in genesis chapter 3 verses 23 and 24 we
[34:12] read it god sent him forth from the
[34:14] garden
[34:14] god drove out the man and then he guards
[34:16] the way to the tree of life where he
[34:18] could eat and live forever and then you
[34:19] don't need to eat anymore
[34:21] right you don't need to continually eat
[34:23] for healing you don't need to continue
[34:24] to eat to preserve the body and keep it
[34:26] going
[34:26] so he's cut off from that
[34:30] in order to live forever and he's told
[34:32] he's going to be sent forth from the
[34:34] garden even to till the ground from
[34:35] which he was taken
[34:37] so when god drove adam out of the garden
[34:39] it was
[34:40] not before he had fully adorned the
[34:42] earth and specifically had furnished
[34:44] adam
[34:45] to dress it and to keep it god had
[34:48] already placed everything
[34:50] that man would need in the earth
[34:54] and also in himself can you see the
[34:56] grace of this
[34:58] we read genesis chapter 3 and it seems
[35:00] so much judgment
[35:01] so much condemnation but god knowing
[35:04] what was coming
[35:05] in his grace was fashioning man
[35:08] to deal with the fall i'm gonna make you
[35:12] a
[35:12] killer of the ground why couldn't adam
[35:14] just tell the serpent to do it
[35:16] but he was equipping him he was making
[35:18] him able
[35:20] he had already placed it in the earth
[35:22] and placed it within adam himself
[35:25] as it says in genesis chapter 2 verse 1
[35:27] thus the heavens and the earth
[35:28] were finished and
[35:32] all the host of them
[35:36] thus the heavens and the earth were
[35:38] finished and all the host of them this
[35:40] is the conclusion
[35:41] before god rest on the seventh day it
[35:43] says creation is complete
[35:46] we can say it's a perfect picture we
[35:48] understand already that there can be
[35:50] more to be developed
[35:51] but the seeds are sown amen everything's
[35:53] furnished
[35:54] everything's there god will not have to
[35:57] speak
[35:58] later to amend
[36:02] god won't have to readjust well satan oh
[36:04] man i had my
[36:05] six moves planned but i wasn't
[36:07] anticipating that one i need to readjust
[36:09] my seventh my
[36:10] my sixth move there was no choose your
[36:13] adventure here though it might look like
[36:15] it to satan
[36:17] all the heavenly earth were finished all
[36:19] the host of them
[36:20] for man
[36:23] before man was created and even before
[36:26] he was made flesh
[36:28] the earth was fully arranged creation
[36:31] was fully expressed
[36:34] and genesis chapter 1 verses 28 to 30
[36:38] it establishes the order and the purpose
[36:41] of mankind
[36:43] and also for creation all of creation
[36:46] has meaning in light of genesis 1 20 to
[36:48] 30.
[36:49] all of mankind is established placed and
[36:51] arranged
[36:52] under genesis chapter 1 verses 28 to 30.
[36:55] it is the commission to man
[36:57] and this is what he must keep and now
[36:59] everything in its play everything is
[37:00] given
[37:01] a purpose and everything has a place
[37:04] and there's a place for everything it's
[37:07] the easiest way to stay clean right
[37:09] everything in its place and a place for
[37:11] everything and and
[37:12] there was a place for it that's how you
[37:14] wouldn't have chaos you wouldn't have
[37:15] disorder
[37:16] like what is this doing here everything
[37:17] had a place and everything was in its
[37:19] place
[37:20] and genesis chapter 1 verses 28 to 29
[37:23] places things in relation to each other
[37:25] as it says in verse 29 and god said
[37:27] behold
[37:28] to the man male and female i have given
[37:30] you
[37:31] every herb bearing seed which is upon
[37:34] the face
[37:35] of all the earth and every tree in the
[37:38] witch
[37:38] is the fruit of a tree yielding seed to
[37:41] you
[37:41] it shall be for meat
[37:46] take that you vegetarians
[37:49] means food
[37:53] he says i have given you in this
[37:55] commission commission in this blessing
[37:57] in this empowering
[37:58] every herb every tree which yields fruit
[38:01] is your
[38:02] food it's part of god's divine blessing
[38:05] so even before adam was made flesh i
[38:08] want you to catch the order of this
[38:10] before adam is even in a body from the
[38:12] earth
[38:13] and even before that body falls and is
[38:15] driven out of the garden
[38:17] god created
[38:20] substance for life and then empowered
[38:23] man to partake of it
[38:24] in order to sustain his life this is
[38:27] before he's even in a body that would
[38:28] need it and before he would even fall
[38:30] god said i've made fruit and i've made
[38:32] vegetation i've made these things for
[38:34] you to eat of it every herb that brings
[38:36] forth you can eat
[38:37] every tree that yields fruit you can eat
[38:39] it's for you for meat for your flesh
[38:41] and so god before adam even existed in
[38:44] the body
[38:44] before genesis chapter 3 god created and
[38:47] commanded the substance for sustaining
[38:49] adam's flesh
[38:51] god was already sustained god was
[38:53] already making provision
[38:56] god was already looking out after adam
[38:57] before he fell
[38:59] and if god would do this for man who is
[39:01] imminently going to fall would god not
[39:03] do the same for you today
[39:06] can you not rest in his provision can
[39:08] you not rest in his promise
[39:11] so in genesis chapter 2 verse 7.
[39:17] it says in the lord god formed man
[39:21] of the dust of the ground and breathed
[39:24] into his nostrils the breath of life and
[39:26] man became
[39:27] a living soul so the image of god
[39:31] is now placed in a fleshly body which
[39:33] came from
[39:34] the dust came from the earth
[39:37] but the man talks about how all our
[39:39] bodies laid in the earth talking about
[39:40] our bodies are already in the earth
[39:43] all the elements everything's already in
[39:44] there and so now the image of god which
[39:47] adam was made in
[39:48] which god is a spirit adam's made in
[39:50] that likeness made in that image
[39:52] genesis chapter 2 does not re-explain or
[39:55] rewrite what happens in chapter one
[39:57] it's a further development
[40:01] genesis chapter one is perfect all
[40:03] creation is made everything's expressed
[40:05] all the host everything it's ever gonna
[40:06] be
[40:07] is already there but now seeds have to
[40:09] come forth
[40:10] and genesis chapter two is god's spoken
[40:13] word developing
[40:14] and it's expressing things and god is
[40:16] bringing things forth so he hasn't
[40:17] created again
[40:19] in genesis chapter two and then i want
[40:21] you to ponder this
[40:22] genesis chapter 3 is also a development
[40:26] maybe just in the the loosest use of the
[40:28] phrase it's a development you might
[40:30] think well that's not a development
[40:31] that's a that's a fall backwards but
[40:33] it's a development
[40:37] but this is a necessary development him
[40:40] being placed the man
[40:41] he's formed man from the dust of the
[40:43] ground
[40:44] this is a necessary development for man
[40:46] to fulfill the prophecy or the
[40:48] commandment of genesis 1 28.
[40:50] as long as he's a spirit being he cannot
[40:54] do all the ends be fruitful and multiply
[40:58] and replenish the earth and subdue the
[41:00] earth
[41:01] he could not fulfill genesis 1 28
[41:04] unless he was in a body so now adam is
[41:08] composed of an earthly body
[41:11] with a heavenly soul and a spirit which
[41:12] came direct from god so now it's an
[41:14] earthly body
[41:15] we know adam is made in the image of god
[41:17] which is heavenly and then it says god
[41:19] breathed into his nostrils the breath of
[41:21] life so this is a spirit which comes
[41:23] direct from god
[41:24] and when man now is placed inside an
[41:26] earthly body
[41:28] now that he's body spirit and soul man
[41:31] becomes a little world
[41:32] himself he actually becomes
[41:36] like creation heavens and earth
[41:40] because the soul and spirit came from
[41:41] god which is the heavenly the body came
[41:43] from the earth so adam is almost a
[41:45] little earth in a little world a little
[41:47] creation in himself
[41:48] and brother bottom says this i'm going
[41:50] to read from three places i had a dozen
[41:53] that i could have read from because
[41:54] brother bannon makes a very direct
[41:55] connection any time
[41:57] most of the time that brother bannon
[41:58] talks about adam's body
[42:01] being formed he makes specific
[42:03] references to certain things and in
[42:04] these three statements
[42:06] you'll see how brother adam's
[42:07] identifying what the evolution was for
[42:10] and i will restore in the beginning when
[42:12] god made man in his image
[42:13] the first man adam was a man like god he
[42:16] was a spirit man
[42:17] he says then later on we find after he
[42:20] made man in his image
[42:21] there was no man to till the soil
[42:27] brother branham when he's looking at
[42:28] this genesis 2 7
[42:31] he points to this phrase there was no
[42:33] man to till the soil
[42:35] that it was necessary for god to put
[42:37] adam in a body to till the soil
[42:40] man had to do that then he says this
[42:43] this is the other
[42:44] part that he mentioned so often accord
[42:45] when he refers to genesis 2 7.
[42:47] so he put man in five senses to contact
[42:51] his earthly home that's the purpose of
[42:54] the body
[42:55] so god in genesis chapter 2 verse 7
[42:58] gives adam a body
[42:59] which is going to allow him to properly
[43:01] relate to and go through
[43:04] and interact with all of creation his
[43:06] earthly home the garden of eden
[43:09] without that he would have had a
[43:10] peculiar relationship to creation
[43:12] in the same way that god was still a
[43:14] mystery to animal life
[43:16] and that god still would have been a
[43:17] mystery and unable to partake in the
[43:19] grass and and
[43:20] and the fruit and all of creation there
[43:22] was a way that adam had to be expressed
[43:24] and he had to be equipped with certain
[43:26] senses in order to make his way
[43:28] in the perfect eden so brother branham
[43:31] points to
[43:32] he had to come into flesh in order to
[43:34] till the soil and he was given senses to
[43:36] contact his earthly home that's the
[43:38] purpose of the body
[43:40] he says in jehovah jireh he says when he
[43:41] formed man the first time
[43:43] he made them in his own image and god is
[43:45] a spirit in the image of god created he
[43:46] him
[43:47] male and female created he them and then
[43:49] still there was no man to till the soil
[43:53] then god formed man out of the dust of
[43:55] the earth and put his dual spirit in him
[43:57] and that was the first adam so
[44:00] just adam further expressed and god's
[44:02] power to transform he quotes genesis 1
[44:04] 27
[44:05] and he says and then he goes on and many
[44:07] things happened upon the earth
[44:10] then we say man was made in his likeness
[44:12] and in his image
[44:13] and he says then many things happened
[44:15] upon the earth
[44:16] then we come to find out there's no man
[44:18] to till the soil
[44:19] then god created man out of the dust of
[44:21] the earth
[44:22] he goes that was a different man
[44:25] now i don't find anywhere else where
[44:28] brother
[44:28] who teaches that this is a a separate
[44:31] entity from adam
[44:33] it's a different it's it's a different
[44:35] expression of the same adam
[44:38] that was a different man and he breathed
[44:39] the spirit of life into him and he
[44:41] became a
[44:42] living soul now what god has done
[44:45] is he's taken man and he's made him into
[44:49] something
[44:50] that puts him in relationship to
[44:52] creation
[44:53] as the highest in creation and he says
[44:56] and man became so brother man i'm saying
[44:58] he was given senses the body
[44:59] genesis 2 7 so he could have a body with
[45:01] five senses to contact his earthly home
[45:04] that's what it's for and then it's for
[45:07] him to also till the ground to fulfill
[45:08] his purpose
[45:09] and so this process of making a body out
[45:11] of the dust of the earth breathing a
[45:13] breath of life into his nostrils
[45:14] man becomes a living soul brother says
[45:17] and then he became
[45:18] a living soul that that word is living
[45:25] and nephesh living soul nephesh
[45:29] it's a that's what the hebrew is that's
[45:31] what a living soul is
[45:34] what he has done now by making adam a
[45:36] living soul now in our minds we think
[45:37] living soul we think a soul of man which
[45:39] comes direct from god and
[45:40] we think this is acquainted him further
[45:42] with the divine and this has made him
[45:44] more godlike but actually the opposite
[45:46] is true
[45:47] what god has done is now he's given him
[45:49] an affinity to the creation that he's to
[45:51] help
[45:52] he's actually connected him to the ones
[45:54] that the commission and the commandment
[45:56] applies to genesis 1 28-30 applies to
[46:00] mankind animal life and all the the all
[46:03] the
[46:04] the vegetation and life anything that
[46:05] would grow anything that would come up
[46:07] and it's given this relationship man you
[46:09] could eat of the fruit and you could eat
[46:10] of the herb
[46:11] animal life you can eat of the
[46:12] vegetation and the grass and everything
[46:14] was placed in its order and everything
[46:15] had
[46:16] an understanding what their role was and
[46:18] what they were to do and so when god
[46:19] makes man a living soul
[46:21] he's given him an affinity to the living
[46:24] creatures
[46:25] genesis chapter 1 verse 21 and god
[46:28] created wells
[46:29] and every living creature guess what
[46:32] that phrase is
[46:33] living soul it could have very well
[46:35] create said and man became a
[46:37] living creature because it's the very
[46:39] same uh uh kae
[46:41] it's the same living creature so in the
[46:43] fifth day
[46:45] god brings forth living creatures then
[46:48] in the sixth day verse 24
[46:49] and god said let the earth bring forth
[46:52] the living creature
[46:57] this is all happening before adam
[46:59] becomes a living creature
[47:01] so when adam is made
[47:13] flesh and i've given you this i've made
[47:15] you this way and when i
[47:16] kick you out of my garden i've given you
[47:18] what you need adam
[47:20] you will make it amen you may not be
[47:22] able to live that thousand
[47:24] years because what i said the day you
[47:25] eat that day you die but adam you'll
[47:27] live a long time
[47:29] because of the gifts i've given you
[47:31] provision i've made for you
[47:33] i wonder if god wanted to say adam i'm
[47:37] sorry
[47:38] but i'm painting a picture you'll
[47:40] understand one day better
[47:43] the day when he woke eve up he said
[47:45] honey he's here
[47:46] that one i told you about
[47:50] the one that was to come
[47:55] despite what adam lost
[47:58] when he forfeited that title deed
[48:06] god made adam knowing that trouble would
[48:08] come
[48:13] i think we should rethink god's judgment
[48:17] he made him knowing that trouble would
[48:19] come
[48:21] and in genesis chapter 3 verse 21
[48:26] he says unto adam also and to his wife
[48:31] did the lord god make coats of skin and
[48:34] clothe them
[48:36] i'd like to emphasize it more later but
[48:39] chapter two ends where they're both in
[48:41] the garden
[48:42] they're naked and unashamed
[48:46] but now their nakedness is exposed
[48:50] and there's shame that comes with it but
[48:53] god cares about
[48:54] nakedness and it says that god
[48:57] the lord god made coats of skin and
[48:59] clothed him
[49:00] this is when death full death fully
[49:03] enters
[49:05] because an innocent creature had to be
[49:07] slain for men's clothing
[49:09] so when we read it it just says and the
[49:11] lord god made coats of skins and clothed
[49:13] them that means god had to take the hide
[49:15] of an animal
[49:17] and in order for him to do it he had to
[49:21] kill it
[49:23] or it had to be killed rather i want to
[49:24] say it that way it had to be killed
[49:27] so it says the lord god made coats of
[49:29] skins and clothed them god did not
[49:31] literally stitch together clothing but
[49:33] rather he provided for it
[49:35] and i may i may just have to stop here
[49:37] cutting this this sermon in half
[49:41] i just i i i want to labor on this point
[49:44] now
[49:45] the lord god made clothing out of animal
[49:48] skins
[49:49] to cover them but god didn't
[49:52] himself because god's not in a body
[49:55] and though god could have supernaturally
[49:57] done anything he wanted created skins
[49:59] but that would have been
[50:00] complementary to his purpose what god
[50:03] did is he provided
[50:05] everything that was necessary for that
[50:08] clothing to eventually cover them
[50:12] now watch this in revelations chapter 19
[50:14] verses 7 to 8
[50:16] because now this is another parallel
[50:18] genesis 3 in revelations 19 let us be
[50:20] glad and rejoice
[50:21] and give honor to him for the marriage
[50:23] of the lamb has come
[50:25] and his wife hath made herself ready
[50:30] she's dressed herself but is she
[50:33] dressing herself with her own clothing
[50:36] is she dressing herself with what she
[50:38] thinks is good and what she had her own
[50:39] possessions no
[50:40] but she's taken something and made
[50:44] herself
[50:44] ready and it says in verse 8 and to her
[50:48] was granted
[50:49] that she should be arrayed in fine linen
[50:52] clean and white for the linen is the
[50:54] righteousness of his saints brother man
[50:55] refers to the scripture says his own
[50:57] word
[50:58] and he says his righteousness that's
[51:00] what she was granted to be dressed and
[51:02] so the bride is granted
[51:04] furnished the necessities furnished what
[51:06] was necessary
[51:08] she was appointed and commissioned just
[51:11] as god blessed them
[51:12] now the bride is granted when she's
[51:14] granted she is furnished with what is
[51:16] necessary
[51:17] and she's also appointed and she's
[51:19] commissioned she has given what she
[51:21] needs to dress herself
[51:22] so she not only has the elements but she
[51:25] has the understanding to take it
[51:27] she has the mind of christ to know what
[51:29] he wants done with the word
[51:30] so he has not only furnished the word
[51:32] but given her the revelation to take it
[51:34] and wear it properly
[51:35] oh hallelujah think about what the
[51:37] scripture speaks of that
[51:38] god had granted god granted to her he
[51:42] had given her a revelation of the word
[51:45] of how to prepare herself how to make
[51:48] herself ready
[51:50] so in revelations chapter 21 verse 22
[51:52] what do you see and i john saw the holy
[51:54] city new jerusalem coming down from
[51:56] god out of heaven
[51:59] prepared as a bride adorned for her
[52:01] husband
[52:02] revelations 19 7 says made herself ready
[52:06] that phrase
[52:07] is used prepared same word made herself
[52:10] ready
[52:11] is the same word that's used it's just
[52:12] translated to his wife hath
[52:14] prepared that's that's what one
[52:16] translation could say
[52:18] his wife half prepared and the
[52:20] understanding would be she prepared
[52:22] herself
[52:23] because you read the next verse because
[52:24] she was given righteousness
[52:26] the word to clothe herself so she was
[52:28] given the elements of it
[52:30] she took it and by revelation knew how
[52:32] to wear it
[52:33] so when john sees the city he says i see
[52:35] a bride
[52:36] a city prepared made ready made herself
[52:39] ready prepared as a bride adorned which
[52:41] means made ready
[52:43] for her husband
[52:46] now this is the same thing that happens
[52:48] in genesis 3 21.
[52:49] you may say that's a very very bold
[52:51] statement to make
[52:53] i i believe you're catching just exactly
[52:55] what god did in genesis 3 21
[52:57] just as the white in the end was given
[52:59] the material
[53:00] and the understanding and knowledge how
[53:02] to use the material
[53:03] god foreshadows this in genesis 3 21 and
[53:06] the lord god made coats of skin and
[53:08] clothed him
[53:09] the same thing happens in genesis 3 21
[53:11] god
[53:12] how did it happen how did it unfold in
[53:14] the sixth day
[53:15] god created the lamb
[53:18] he had already before before man was
[53:20] even created
[53:21] in the sixth day this is the beautiful
[53:24] symmetry
[53:24] man is coming i'm gonna create an animal
[53:28] in the sixth day before adam even has
[53:31] any before he comes forth from god
[53:33] in the image of god before genesis 1 26
[53:35] and 27 god created the lamb
[53:38] that would dress him the very one that
[53:40] would clothe him god said i must make
[53:43] preparation
[53:44] before he comes
[53:47] and he takes this lamb god creates the
[53:49] lamb
[53:50] and then right there in genesis 3 21
[53:52] grants them the knowledge
[53:54] and gives them the revelation that this
[53:57] innocent
[53:58] must die and they must wear it
[54:08] that's how god made them close
[54:11] he creates the lamb in the sixth day
[54:12] before man has even come forth
[54:15] but yet he's premeditated he's foreseen
[54:21] and it's a lamb that's gonna what die
[54:24] think about that
[54:25] here came an innocent lamb in a perfect
[54:28] eden
[54:29] and god made him he would die
[54:32] but he was gonna use it to dress his son
[54:35] and his bride
[54:41] it's further understood that it was a
[54:44] revelation because in genesis chapter 4
[54:46] verse 4
[54:48] and abel he also brought of the first
[54:51] lings of his flock
[54:52] and the fat thereof and the lord had
[54:55] respect
[54:55] unto abel and to his offering why
[54:59] because his his revelation was connected
[55:02] to the revelation that was given in the
[55:03] garden
[55:04] his revelation was connected with
[55:06] genesis 3 21. he had a revelation
[55:08] that in the garden what was used to
[55:11] cover
[55:12] man when he fell was a lamb that had
[55:14] been slain
[55:15] and they were driven out of this garden
[55:17] in these bleeding skins that were
[55:19] flapping on them
[55:20] flop bump bump bump his brother bam
[55:22] describe it abel caught the revelation
[55:24] that adam had
[55:26] adam had a revelation given it to him by
[55:28] god in your condition
[55:29] in your nakedness i provided islam
[55:32] here's the lamb
[55:33] you're gonna have to kill it and you're
[55:34] gonna have to dress yourself on those
[55:36] skins
[55:36] we see that abel now has the same kind
[55:39] of revelation
[55:40] because he takes the first slings of his
[55:42] flock and he sheds the blood and he
[55:44] offers it back to god
[55:45] to create that connection and that
[55:46] symmetry of the first thing to die
[55:48] before being sent out from the garden
[55:51] and the very first proper sacrifice made
[55:53] to god
[55:54] all foreshadowing what the lamb that
[55:56] would come
[55:57] that was slain when before the
[56:01] foundation of the world
[56:03] i said brother why are you so emotional
[56:05] i didn't sleep
[56:07] that this was just precious to me i feel
[56:10] i feel more connected to the lord than
[56:12] ever
[56:14] every scripture means so much more to me
[56:15] to walk through it this way to see
[56:17] these things that are taken that just
[56:19] dovetail so abel by revelation
[56:22] offers the first things and that's what
[56:24] hebrews 11 4 says
[56:26] by faith abel offered unto god a more
[56:29] excellent sacrifice something that
[56:31] excelled than cain by which he obtained
[56:33] witness that he was righteous
[56:34] his revelation granted to him gave him
[56:37] righteousness
[56:38] god testifying of his gifts and by he
[56:40] being dead yet speaketh
[56:42] but it was more excellent than cain's
[56:44] offering so what was cain's offering
[56:45] genesis chapter 4 verse 3
[56:48] and in the process of time it came to
[56:50] pass that cain
[56:51] brought up the fruit of the ground an
[56:54] offering
[56:55] unto the lord now you see the vast
[56:59] difference
[57:00] between the two abel's offering
[57:03] is connected to god's mystery
[57:06] abel's offering is connected to life
[57:10] his offering by revelation expresses
[57:13] that
[57:13] the innocent has to die
[57:16] to appease god's justice so
[57:20] and this is what man must be dressed in
[57:22] this is what he must be covered in
[57:24] so that's abel's revelation it's
[57:25] directly connected with the revelation
[57:27] given in the garden
[57:28] adam god created the innocent lamb gave
[57:30] adam the understanding that it needed to
[57:32] be slain
[57:33] and stitched and dressed and placed over
[57:35] him he had the understanding what to do
[57:36] with it so abel's
[57:38] revelation connects to that but notice
[57:40] cain's revelation
[57:42] is connected to the ground which is
[57:44] cursed
[57:46] so his knowledge not revelation we could
[57:48] call it revelation but his knowledge his
[57:50] inspiration
[57:51] is not connected with the mystery of
[57:52] what was hid in the garden or what was
[57:54] granted before adam was driven out but
[57:57] rather it's only tied to the earth which
[57:59] god himself had cursed
[58:01] so he offers from the fruit of the
[58:03] ground but now notice the connection and
[58:05] the symmetry
[58:06] to the fallen knowledge in fear-based
[58:08] religion or fear-based dressing
[58:11] fear-based response when it's not faith
[58:13] or revelation
[58:14] genesis chapter 3 verse 7. are you dizzy
[58:17] yet
[58:19] good thing we all use our phones and our
[58:21] tablets now or there'd be dust
[58:22] everywhere
[58:24] genesis chapter 3 verse 7 and the eyes
[58:27] of them both were open so now they're
[58:28] open and what
[58:29] no good from evil there's been a further
[58:32] step in the development but something's
[58:33] not right about it
[58:35] because it says and they knew that they
[58:36] were naked
[58:38] and they sowed fig leaves together and
[58:40] made themselves aprons
[58:43] so before god gave adam and the woman to
[58:46] revelation
[58:47] they tried to cover themselves by their
[58:49] own will it's the very same thing that
[58:51] got him in trouble
[58:52] the enticement of the flesh the
[58:54] knowledge of man the the the seed of the
[58:55] serpent now
[58:56] is sowing this in through discourse with
[58:58] the woman it's caused them to fall but
[59:00] now they're acting they're motivated
[59:01] completely out of character
[59:03] and they know they're naked and they
[59:04] know something needs to be done but what
[59:06] do they grab they grab
[59:06] fig leaves from a fig tree god never
[59:10] said the trees that bear figs have
[59:12] leaves for clothing
[59:14] he never said that but yet they go
[59:17] to a fig tree that would have had figs
[59:19] on it
[59:20] and they take the leaves thereof and
[59:21] they make themselves clothing so it's
[59:23] they have now some understanding of how
[59:26] to close themselves and cover up their
[59:27] parts
[59:29] but this is before the revelation is
[59:31] made no
[59:33] what's happening god is letting his
[59:36] story be told
[59:40] divine love is being expressed
[59:45] sometimes we get so focused on the
[59:46] judgment
[59:48] that we miss his plan
[59:51] so focused on the curse of the woman the
[59:53] curse of the serpent the curse of the
[59:55] earth and we get so focused on
[59:57] them being driven out and and the
[1:00:00] of the sin
[1:00:00] and the wickedness of the woman and
[1:00:02] we're so focused on those things that we
[1:00:03] completely miss
[1:00:04] the pattern that god is laying in the
[1:00:06] beginning
[1:00:09] brother branham writes this thus what
[1:00:10] god worked out here in the garden
[1:00:12] was his predestinated plan
[1:00:18] and he's referring to genesis chapter 3.
[1:00:21] what god worked out in genesis 3 what
[1:00:23] happened in genesis 3
[1:00:25] god allowed it to be worked out it was
[1:00:26] part of his predestination plan
[1:00:28] genesis chapter 3 is a development not
[1:00:31] an interruption
[1:00:34] the development was an interruption but
[1:00:37] it was part of the development
[1:00:38] it was a necessary one because he says
[1:00:41] and when satan
[1:00:42] had brought about that which was
[1:00:43] necessary to the purpose of god
[1:00:46] i have i have more
[1:00:50] to share than i've even covered now but
[1:00:51] i'm just going to close with this
[1:00:54] had adam remained in the garden of eden
[1:00:59] the mystery of god would have forever
[1:01:01] been hidden
[1:01:04] think about it he just stayed there
[1:01:08] and every seed came forth
[1:01:12] there would have been a part of god that
[1:01:13] would have been left unsatisfied
[1:01:17] there would have been things about god
[1:01:21] that he would have wanted to express but
[1:01:23] couldn't
[1:01:26] had adam remained in the perfection of
[1:01:28] eden
[1:01:30] who god is would have forever been lost
[1:01:33] the full manifestation of god
[1:01:37] all god is would have forever laid
[1:01:38] dormant in the image
[1:01:40] the potential there the power there
[1:01:44] the desire there but never expressed
[1:01:48] and this is what i want to leave you
[1:01:50] with
[1:02:00] i would at least like to get to my text
[1:02:08] says nevertheless death reigned
[1:02:11] romans 5 14
[1:02:14] nevertheless death reigned from adam to
[1:02:16] moses
[1:02:18] even over all them that had not sinned
[1:02:21] after the similitude of adam's
[1:02:22] transgression
[1:02:24] adam who is the figure of him
[1:02:28] that was to come god only used adam
[1:02:33] as a signpost he only used him as a
[1:02:37] figure
[1:02:39] because god's purpose could not be
[1:02:42] revealed without redemption
[1:02:46] his full character couldn't be expressed
[1:02:48] without
[1:02:49] redemption the very essence of his name
[1:02:52] could not be expressed without
[1:02:55] redemption
[1:02:57] if i can say it this way his need and
[1:03:00] his desire to be a redeemer
[1:03:02] is at the center of god's character
[1:03:05] it wasn't it wasn't so much that god's
[1:03:07] heart purpose was to have a bride of his
[1:03:09] choosing
[1:03:10] but one that he could reveal himself
[1:03:12] totally to
[1:03:14] one that would experience every single
[1:03:18] part of his being one that would know
[1:03:20] him in the fullness
[1:03:21] of his abilities one that would know all
[1:03:23] of his characteristics all of his
[1:03:25] attributes not just really know you know
[1:03:26] god is a really good artist and god
[1:03:28] knows how to paint a sunset and god
[1:03:30] knows how to make high mountains
[1:03:31] but all the things that he was whether
[1:03:33] it be a comforter or a deliverer
[1:03:35] or a healer or a savior he wanted her to
[1:03:38] know him
[1:03:39] in all of his names in all of his
[1:03:41] character and all his attributes so his
[1:03:42] need to be a redeemer
[1:03:44] his desire was insatiable he had to be a
[1:03:46] redeemer
[1:03:47] it was an absolute necessity
[1:03:51] man was placed upon the in the garden
[1:03:53] and god knew unless he falls
[1:03:55] i will forever be longing and i read
[1:03:58] genesis chapter 2 verse 1.
[1:04:00] it says in the all the heavens and earth
[1:04:02] were created and all the host of them
[1:04:05] it so struck me last week with such full
[1:04:08] force in revelation
[1:04:09] god said that's it from this will come
[1:04:12] my desire
[1:04:13] i'm done creating i will get what i want
[1:04:16] from this one i will not create another
[1:04:18] alternate reality i will not ever create
[1:04:20] again
[1:04:21] my desire will be satisfied in this
[1:04:26] and it was an insatiable desire for
[1:04:29] redemption
[1:04:33] so not only did he foreknow adam's fall
[1:04:39] but he arranged all things according to
[1:04:42] the plan of redemption
[1:04:45] and then he sealed it
[1:04:50] and let me say this as the worship team
[1:04:52] comes
[1:04:56] that's what they say at the bible
[1:04:57] churches if the team will come
[1:05:01] let me say this maybe we could sing that
[1:05:03] song down from his glory
[1:05:09] i was going to express it through so
[1:05:11] many different scriptures
[1:05:16] let me say this the mystery of
[1:05:20] redemption
[1:05:22] is that whenever god redeems
[1:05:27] it's always greater
[1:05:32] [Music]
[1:05:33] the work of redemption and the mystery
[1:05:34] of redemption
[1:05:41] i just i i i want to stop but i just
[1:05:44] feel god
[1:05:45] it has to be impressed in someone's
[1:05:48] heart
[1:05:50] god's need to be a redeemer
[1:05:55] can we just spiritually relax then a
[1:05:58] little bit
[1:06:00] when we see the chaos
[1:06:03] when we see things turned upside down
[1:06:06] and we see something that seems so far
[1:06:08] beyond hope
[1:06:10] god sees it and says i need that right
[1:06:14] and the situations that we face in the
[1:06:16] end of laodicea
[1:06:18] my goodness we could despair but there's
[1:06:22] things that we will face as the bride as
[1:06:24] we triumph and as we're
[1:06:25] being raised and being lifted there's
[1:06:28] great acts of redemption in store
[1:06:31] and let me let me add my personal
[1:06:34] conviction
[1:06:35] i am here in phoenix arizona in this
[1:06:38] in this state to walk in his plans
[1:06:42] of redemption and to be a co-laborer
[1:06:45] for god's purpose to redeem anything
[1:06:48] that is lost
[1:06:49] no matter how far lost it will be
[1:06:52] and if we have things in our own life
[1:06:54] that are upset and things that we go
[1:06:56] through and losses and things
[1:06:57] don't fret don't despair there must be
[1:07:00] loss in order for god to have meaning
[1:07:02] there must be renting and torment
[1:07:06] god envisioned in the very beginning he
[1:07:09] not only
[1:07:10] envisioned and foreknew that man would
[1:07:12] fall but he arranged
[1:07:14] everything knowing he would fall for the
[1:07:17] sake of redemption
[1:07:19] and could we not believe that god had
[1:07:21] your redemption in mind
[1:07:23] your claims in redemption your promises
[1:07:26] under the open lord
[1:07:27] good could did god not already provide
[1:07:29] it if he was providing for adam in the
[1:07:31] beginning
[1:07:32] in genesis 1 and genesis 2 and genesis 3
[1:07:35] for his reality in genesis 4 and on
[1:07:38] would god not then in the end
[1:07:40] provide you what is necessary to get to
[1:07:42] the condition of the end of revelation
[1:07:44] would god not do it and what would cause
[1:07:47] him to do it his need
[1:07:48] his desire for redemption
[1:07:52] that's what would do it i
[1:07:56] i say that we should just reverence him
[1:07:59] praise him and worship him
[1:08:03] and exalt him and say god i
[1:08:06] trust you i trust you
[1:08:12] adam and that fear brother brown
[1:08:14] describes it this way
[1:08:17] the brandon gets the story and he just
[1:08:19] kind of turns it around
[1:08:23] and he has adam and the woman being
[1:08:26] dressed
[1:08:27] in the bleeding bloody skins of an
[1:08:30] innocent lamb
[1:08:32] they're walking out of their garden and
[1:08:33] they're so tore up
[1:08:36] and so anguished and fear is coming over
[1:08:39] him
[1:08:40] in the woman they don't know what's
[1:08:42] going to happen
[1:08:44] but brother branham rearranging it you
[1:08:46] can see then
[1:08:48] that god as he begins to curse the
[1:08:50] serpent and the woman
[1:08:52] and then the earth he was actually
[1:08:54] trying he was actually sharing something
[1:08:56] which was the mystery of redemption and
[1:08:58] he was telling adam
[1:09:00] adam i got this i've made you for this
[1:09:04] i've already planned it i may i put you
[1:09:07] upon this basis adam
[1:09:09] i didn't make you sin but i put the
[1:09:12] capacity to do it in you
[1:09:15] i didn't force the woman to sin but i
[1:09:17] put her on the basis that she could fall
[1:09:19] i arranged it this way and so as he's
[1:09:21] forcing him out of the garden and the
[1:09:23] sphere might have come over and god said
[1:09:25] as they're walking about to take that
[1:09:26] last step into the wilderness
[1:09:28] brother brown describes how something
[1:09:30] dropped down out of heaven
[1:09:32] and he spelled it a little funnel l o
[1:09:35] v e called love and he said stop
[1:09:39] as the tears were flowing and the fear
[1:09:41] was gripping them
[1:09:42] and they were so anxious about the
[1:09:44] future he said stop
[1:09:46] don't worry adam i will redeem you
[1:09:50] don't worry redemption has already begun
[1:09:54] don't worry i've already made a way one
[1:09:57] day
[1:09:58] one day you'll stand upon this earth one
[1:10:01] day the suns will be manifested
[1:10:03] one day genesis 1 28-30 will be
[1:10:06] expressed
[1:10:06] don't worry adam the seed will come
[1:10:09] through a woman
[1:10:11] and you'll crush the serpent
[1:10:15] and adam must have taken that and lived
[1:10:18] on it
[1:10:19] all his days we need to live by the
[1:10:22] revelation
[1:10:24] there's a redeemer coming a revelation
[1:10:27] that god made me for this
[1:10:29] yeah this is my job yeah i'm gonna sweat
[1:10:32] yes this is gonna be hard but he made me
[1:10:34] a tiller of the ground
[1:10:36] it's not gonna be easy but he made me
[1:10:39] for this
[1:10:40] it's not gonna be easy but god has
[1:10:42] arranged it honey
[1:10:45] eve don't worry he's made it a certain
[1:10:48] way
[1:10:50] and we can work with his seeds we can
[1:10:51] work with his laws
[1:10:53] and we're going to be okay how many
[1:10:55] years do you live around 900 years
[1:11:00] let's stand if he would do that
[1:11:05] for him
[1:11:09] he did it for you whether you see it or
[1:11:11] not whether you recognize it or not he
[1:11:13] did it for you
[1:11:15] you may not even understand it but he
[1:11:17] did it
[1:11:19] i know there's a song he didn't have to
[1:11:21] do it but he did but i'm just going to
[1:11:22] say it this way he had to
[1:11:25] he had to or he would have forever been
[1:11:28] a mystery
[1:11:31] let's bow our heads
[1:11:37] is there anyone that want to give their
[1:11:39] heart to the lord today
[1:11:45] anybody feel the love of god beaming
[1:11:48] upon a lost soul
[1:11:51] there's something inside of you it says
[1:11:52] lord i want to accept
[1:11:55] the plan of redemption for me
[1:11:58] if anybody would give their heart to the
[1:12:00] lord you could just lift your hand
[1:12:03] lord i surrender my heart to you
[1:12:06] if you want to stand for somebody else
[1:12:08] say lord
[1:12:09] i'm staking redemption claims today
[1:12:14] redemption he said lord i stand for one
[1:12:18] [Music]
[1:12:20] today
[1:12:22] bow our heads in a word of prayer a
[1:12:24] gracious heavenly father
[1:12:28] we're humbled by your presence
[1:12:32] lord i i'm emotional today
[1:12:37] and i know that that can be a little bit
[1:12:40] of a danger
[1:12:41] dangerous area lord because i'm
[1:12:43] certainly not wanting
[1:12:45] to merely provoke emotion in the people
[1:12:49] something so deep within me has been
[1:12:51] struck
[1:12:53] to i i i'm enveloped by something lord
[1:12:58] and every way i turn i see it
[1:13:02] and i even realized that even as of late
[1:13:05] and
[1:13:06] even in preaching on these things i
[1:13:08] myself found
[1:13:09] that i was trying to to juggle
[1:13:13] what became redemption
[1:13:16] what turned into a redemption story and
[1:13:19] what seemed to devere and change course
[1:13:23] the lord this past week it's just
[1:13:25] finally
[1:13:28] this this picture is almost fully
[1:13:30] developed and that it always was the
[1:13:32] plan of redemption
[1:13:35] therefore lord i take great comfort in
[1:13:37] knowing
[1:13:39] that i was in you before there was time
[1:13:42] and my expression is in time
[1:13:46] and it's fallen and it was weak
[1:13:49] but you have begun a good work in me
[1:13:53] and the seal which you have placed upon
[1:13:55] my soul
[1:13:57] is good until the day of the fullness
[1:14:01] of redemption and father i pray today
[1:14:05] for any young person whether it be my
[1:14:07] own children or someone else's children
[1:14:10] someone streaming at home
[1:14:12] who has a recognition that they have
[1:14:15] sinned and come short of your glory lord
[1:14:18] i pray that they would yield their
[1:14:20] hearts to you for your purpose
[1:14:22] and you could begin a work in them as
[1:14:24] they repent of their sins
[1:14:26] change directions lord seek water
[1:14:29] baptism
[1:14:30] because they know that in repenting
[1:14:32] there is forgiveness of sins
[1:14:34] and as sins have been emitted inwardly
[1:14:38] we go to the water as an outward sign
[1:14:40] that sins have been omitted
[1:14:42] lord that would be my my plea to anyone
[1:14:44] that is lost
[1:14:46] and fathers we stand as your elect
[1:14:50] as adam was one who was a figure of him
[1:14:52] to come
[1:14:54] lord we stand with the word of god today
[1:14:58] on our side and we make claims on our
[1:15:02] loved ones upon our seed
[1:15:04] lord we make claims upon those that have
[1:15:06] gone wayward
[1:15:07] we make claims upon marriages that seem
[1:15:09] to be here
[1:15:10] beyond repair we make claims upon health
[1:15:13] it seems beyond restoration
[1:15:14] we make claims for salvation in cases
[1:15:17] that though
[1:15:18] so the critic and the skeptic
[1:15:21] and the the the ones that doubt
[1:15:26] uh the the very ones that we would might
[1:15:28] even
[1:15:30] believe to be akin to us lord they would
[1:15:32] look at those situations too far gone
[1:15:35] but lord we join our faith to this word
[1:15:39] that whatever exists in the world today
[1:15:42] is a disease
[1:15:43] whatever exists in the world today is an
[1:15:45] infirmity whatever
[1:15:46] exists today is a weakness in humanity
[1:15:49] your word had already made provision
[1:15:51] for a remedy and we accept it today lord
[1:15:56] we commit ourselves to you now in the
[1:15:59] name of the lord jesus christ touch your
[1:16:01] people
[1:16:02] amen
