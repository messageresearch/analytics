TRANSCRIPT
========================================
1 Corinthians chapter 15 12-28. Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead? That's correcting doctrine there. But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen? And if Christ be not risen, that is our preaching then is our preaching vain. And your faith is also vain. I think that's very key there. Yay. And we are found false witnesses of God because we've testified of God that he raised up Christ who he raised not up. If so be that the dead rise not. For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised. And if Christ be not raised, your faith is vain. Ye are yet in your sins. Then they also which have fallen asleep in Christ or perished. If in this life we have o hope in Christ, if in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable. But now as Christ risen from the dead, and become the first fruits of them that slept. For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive. But every man in his own order, Christ the first fruits, afterward they that are Christ at his coming. Then cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father, when he shall have put all put down all rule and all authority and power. For he must reign till he hath put all enemies under his feet. The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death. For he hath put all things under his feet. But when he saith all these things are put under him, it is manifest that he is expected, which did put all things under him. And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the son also himself be subject unto him that put all things unto him, that God may be all in all. &gt;&gt; Amen. We desire God just really make this alive to us this morning. You can be seated. I hope the title doesn't catch you off guard, but the title is the kod. On Wednesday night, we ministered on the prelude. And speaking on the prelude, we were using it in a m musical sense and how that it's a piece. The prelude is a part of a musical piece uh that is the introduction sets the tone. It kind of foreshadows and it's a real critical part of a musical composition and how that God has used the prelude even in sending the word to his prophets or using these uh ways of of introducing or foreshadowing and we used it even how that the prelude establishes the key and John the Baptist was the prelude to Christ and even in future revealings of Christ there is the prelude even in Malachi 4 there's a prelude for uh the comingings of Elijah and so or with the coming of Elijah and so the kota within a musical piece it is that passage that brings it to an end. So the kota is the end that part of the musical piece that finishes or ends the uh uh that composition and it could be a very simple the kota could be very simple could just be a few measures or it can be an entire section in itself but the kota is the end. We had the prelude, the beginning. Now we're looking at the end. And and we're kind of using it in this sense of the art of music. And the kod is actually necessary in the climax after building the momentum from the prelude of the piece itself to let it all accumulate. This is what a visionary does when they compose a piece. they it's been something that's seen as not just something optional but almost as critically necessary so that everything kind of accumulates up to this climactic finish and when it ends it creates some sense of balance because it's looking back it's gathering everything together and it kind of sums it all up and you're left feeling this sense of resolution and that's what happens when a song begins and you establish that consonant key through the prelude when it ends and maybe there's dissonance and there's a bridge and there's different places and the way that the melody and the composition unfold, but then the ending on the consonant is stable. It's restful. Whereas dissonant endings, that's what has that tension, that unresolved conflict. I'm sure some of you have heard it before where a song ends and it ends on a note that just seems like it hasn't ended, leaves you wanting more. and and actually there's times when that happens where it actually gives a little bit of a hook in you because you're you're you're restless wanting to find that conssonance and so the kota is that climax that highest point uh to or that finishing climax of the piece and I believe that as God composed the masterpiece and has conducted it down through the ages with the prelude and now the unfolding of ages the Holy Spirit is leading to that climactic finish that great ending the kota to God's masterpiece. And it's with the end in mind that I I want to focus today on these things because as Paul is writing, he says that if there's not a resurrection of the dead, then our faith is in vain. And that if we only have hope in this life, we can have faith. But he's saying that we of all people are most miserable. And the reason why is because our faith is not just based upon living a good life and and making an impact in this life, but it's connected to something beyond this life. We have faith in a Jesus Christ who died and rose again. &gt;&gt; So then if that faith has been rendered half because we believe Christ has died but in fact he did not raise again and there is no resurrection, we of all people are most miserable. So we we're thinking about and contemplating the finishing the kota in Matthew 24:6 he says and you shall hear of wars and rumors of wars see that you be not troubled for all these things must come to pass but the end is not yet. So he said there's a lot of things that are going to happen a lot of intervening intervals and interludes and bridges and a lot of different uh choruses and verses a lot of things happening but as these things happen just know the end is not yet. He says in verse 14, "And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations and then shall the end come." So Jesus is saying that there is a work to be done that in Christ who has come, died, buried, risen, ascended, has now sent back his holy spirit, given gifts to men, whereby the gospel, even through you can be preached unto all nations. and that there's a filling up and then there's a finishing point. &gt;&gt; There is a point where this ends. The Bible even speaks that if the days are not shortened, there'll be no flesh saved. That there's there's an end point to this. There's even an end in mind when God says uh to Adam and the woman to multiply and replenish the earth. That there's the sense of filling it up to its end point. In Philippians 1:6, he says this in admonishing the believers, being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work, he started it, he began it, &gt;&gt; will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; That perform means bring to an end. &gt;&gt; There is a composer of of of his of a will and a desire and a plan for your life. He has composed it. Now, the Holy Spirit is conducting it and you are performing that will. And he will bring it to an end. Amen. &gt;&gt; He started it. He will complete it. He will finish it. &gt;&gt; He says in Revelations 22:13, I am alpha and omega, the beginning and the end. He is the key, the beginning and the end. The kota, the first and the last. That has a that's a means of wrapping it up. That's a means of starting it and finishing it. I do think that it speaks to to this idea of an all-encompassing endless God. But he's also saying that I've hid the end from the beginning. There's something about the beginning and the end. There's things that it relates to, but I am the mystery of the first and the last, the beginning and the end. The kingdom of God has these boundaries that sum it up. First Peter 1:es 3-9. I found that I was drawing significantly from uh Peter's letters says, "Blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again were born again unto a lively hope." So this is a forwardlooking hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead. Is this not what Paul was preaching in chapter 15 of 1 Corinthians that if Christ be not risen from the dead, there is no resurrection? And he's saying if Christ is risen, which our faith tells us he has, then there will be a resurrection of the believer. &gt;&gt; He that believeth, though he were dead, yet shall he live. So there is this hope of the resurrection by the resurrection of Jesus Christ. And this resurrection is in verse four, to an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you. &gt;&gt; Aren't you so glad you have a reservation? It's reserved. You have, if this body dies, you already have one waiting for you. &gt;&gt; And it's reserved for those who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation, ready to be revealed in the last time. So this hope looks to this ending point. So he says, "Wherein ye greatly rejoice, this salvation, though now for a season, if need be, you're in heaviness through manifold temptations." This is that wars, rumors of wars, toiling, struggles, fighting, dissonance, all these things that greatly rejoice in this faith uh which is to and the salvation which is to be revealed that verse seven that the trial of your faith the testing the proving of your faith being much more precious than of gold that perisheth. Which is more precious? The faith or the trying? Both. &gt;&gt; The tried faith. This faith is so precious. The trying of it makes it purges it, makes it pure, though it be tried with fire that your faith may might be found unto praise and honor and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ. And think of just how beautiful these words are from one Peter who knew him. &gt;&gt; Walked with him in the flesh. He says, "Whom having not seen, ye love." &gt;&gt; If that does not describe the gentile bride, it's you whom having not seen ye love. In whom though now though now you see him not yet believing ye rejoice with joy unspeak unspeakable and full of glory. This is p these are powerful words. This is describing who you are as a Christian. You haven't seen him &gt;&gt; but I've seen him in this. He's revealed himself to me. I know him that. Yes. And that's the beauty of it. You know him through the key of faith. you know him by revelation and you rejoice &gt;&gt; with joy and full of glory and you're looking forward to um things to come and you're believing that he's present now. That's the kind of faith that God wants you to have &gt;&gt; and that's the faith that's going to be tried &gt;&gt; is the faith that believes in having not seen through the heaviness and the manifold temptations. He's speaking he's speaking of very real challenges and persecutions and he says receiving the end of your faith even the salvation of your souls. So there's a finishing of your faith. That's why Paul said if we have faith in Christ but there be no resurrection then our faith is in vain because that faith speaks of an ending. &gt;&gt; We read it earlier in our text 1 Corinthians chapter 15 21- 24. This is where he's saying if if we if Christ be not raised, your faith is in vain and you'll always be in your sin. Because if those that fell asleep in Christ perish, then in this life we only have hope, then we're most miserable. But he says that for since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead. That's Jesus Christ. For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive. And then notice this. But every man in his own order. So it's showing this this work of God unfolding through the ages &gt;&gt; that there has been a cycle of revival and death. There has been many who have died in the faith believing in God and th those that believed in him though they were dead. They're living in a dimension of saints waiting in their theophony because the promise that you have an inheritance already reserved for you in heaven. So it's every man in his own order. Christ the first fruits. He was the firstborn among the dead. Afterwards, they that are Christ at his coming. Here is the resurrection to a new body. Then cometh the end. &gt;&gt; And when he says this, we could think say the end. The end. The end. And we might look towards the very end of the Bible. But this is a particular end when he shall delivered up the kingdom of God, even the father. For when he hath put down all rule and all authority and power. He's speaking specifically about death being triumphed over until finally the kota the ending then cometh the end when all and all will be in God. So if there is an end and we find that Jesus is raising the end in view when he says you're going to see a lot of these things happen but this has to happen then the end cometh and that there's a certain particular order of these unfolding but yet we have a faith that is tethered to something in the end. Peter writes in 1 Peter chapter 4:7 but the end of all things is at hand. Now notice this theme in the New Testament. They all wrote as if any moment the end would come. And it's important to live that way. &gt;&gt; It's important to live that uh I'm I'm going to through prudence plant my potatoes and live as if as if I have a lifetime yet instead ahead of me. So therefore, I'm going to teach my children. I'm going to establish correct order. I'm going to do all these things that a prudent wise man will do according to the scripture. Uh a brother uh shared with me a quote this morning. A and brother Nathaniel uh brother pastor Nate as we might call him. Brother Nathaniel Saias shared a quote from Lamb and Dove where God said, Brother Ram says, "We should have an intelligent church." And woo, I just imagine there's some people out there just had a heart attack and thought for sure that was AI, right? Because you can't have you can't have intelligence uh and believe the message. But there is uh an intelligence we have to have which is wisdom, prudence. &gt;&gt; So we should live as if our children are going to have grandchildren. So, we want to leave a legacy for our grandchildren so that when they raise their there's an inheritance for their for our sons through their children. And and I'm referring specifically to scriptural principles there. But then at the same time, we have to have an end in view. &gt;&gt; And that's what Paul is saying. If all you only look to this life alone for your faith, you're going to be miserable. So we want there to be this kindling and this if I could even say perhaps an edge or something unresolved in us that's always wanting to get to the end &gt;&gt; a goal in mind to say no matter how good it gets here no matter how pleased I am here no matter how well God is moving no matter how happy how happy I am in my marriage no matter how beautifully my children are being raised no matter how powerful the Lord is moving in our church services and the people that God gives us to serve God with I can say that with a group and I mean this from the bottom of my heart that the fact that I'm serving God with you all who are here this morning, it if the Lord was to terry another 50 years, it's going to be a wonderful journey to do it together. &gt;&gt; And that's how I feel. The people that God puts in your life and you're around, it's like, man, it's just wonderful to see God give us this kind of fellowship if this is going to linger. But there still must be a part of us that says, "But I'm not just here to stay, and I don't want to just go to a grave and remain there. I want my faith to see beyond this life. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; so Peter writes in first Peter chapter 4:7, "The end of all things is at hand. Be ye therefore sober in watch unto prayer." This is that deliberate mindset of enduring until the end. He that endureth to the end. There's this sense, this dissonance of the end is not yet, but it's nigh. It's here. It's ending. And if there is an ending, be sober and watch. Jesus says in Luke 14:es 28 to30, "Which of you intending to build a power tower, excuse me, intending to build a tower siteth not down first, and counteth the cost, whether he have sufficient to finish it." These are good instructions for um IKEA purchases, right? Look at all the parts, follow the instructions, make sure they're all there. I saw a joke the other day. I thought it was really good. They said that the there was a newly elected Swedish uh prime minister and they said he should have his cabinet put together by the end of the weekend. That's a political joke there. That was a good one. That's a number of levels there. Very layered. But you if you're going to build something, count the cost, budget, make sure you have the resources to finish it. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's one of those things that maybe haunt a lot of us is all the unfinished products. Uh I got a stack of analog cards, to-do cards, where it's like today, next day, and someday. And I should just order a pack of some days because there's this I need to do this. I need this. It gets uh further and further away. I have a spring cleaning list that obviously I'm going to get to maybe next spring. But you have to count whether you have sufficient to finish to end lest happily after he hath laid the foundation and is not able to finish it. Strong foundation, great foundation. But he says if it's not finished, all that behold it begin to mock him. And I want you to focus in on this aspect. Foundation's being laid and and work begun. But it's in the lack of finishing that the mocker is engaged. It's in the lack of finishing where you do not have the requisite uh um uh compliment or the the completion. And this is what they say saying this man began to build and was not able to finish. So foundations are wonderful, but you got to have a vision for what the finished product's going to look like. Something that you're aiming for. if you're not able to finish it, that's where the criticism comes from. Now, not solely uh due criticism, but even unwarranted criticism often is in the lack of a finish or the way that it's finished. So, that that lack of finishing becomes the sore spot. So, Paul writes in 1 Corinthians chapter 9 vers 24, "Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize?" Notice this. I think I might have had uh my scriptures uh mixed up there where it says where I had 2 Corinthians 9:6 put down there. But the the emphasis there is completing is important because a source of mockery is to not finish something. So he says in verse uh verse 24, "Know you not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize. So run that you may obtain &gt;&gt; the prize. that there's a prize I'm aiming for. Paul talked about a reward which is being set before him that he might apprehend the high calling, the mark for the prize of the high calling. So, we are to run the race. We all run. He says, "But do you not know that even in our own sports, in our Olympics, that everyone runs, but there's only one that obtains the prize." And he's not trying to tell you you better outrun the next person. Uh it's more it's not the same facing a bear attack where if you run into a bear, just run faster than the person that's with you. It's you all have to run and the only way you can run is run in a manner such that you obtain the prize for you. &gt;&gt; It's that finish line. &gt;&gt; In Hebrews 12:es 1 to2, I hope you can see a lot of familiar scriptures that we've been repeating over this year. Wherefore, seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, all these preludes, all these believers that have gone before us, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us. &gt;&gt; There is a course before us. There is a race that you must run. That's why Paul said, "I have run my race. I have finished my course." He'd come to the kota of his course. He'd finished his faith. His faith was bringing him to he says the prize that is laid up for me and for all those who finish their race. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So let us run looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God. We are to run and run in this race with the end in mind, with the goal in mind. You find this even to our young people that may say, "Well, if I can just graduate homeschool and then if I could just go to college and there's these benchmarks in life where you feel like maybe it's going to settle down and it's going to be you're going to kind of reach this plateau and you can just rest." No, this life is about laboring a and working and persevering and there's always going to be something next. and you come to retirement and you've saved up your whole life and you have enough money for retirement. Then you retire and you're bored to death being retired and so you want to figure out something to do so you could spend all the money before you have to leave it to your kids and there so there's always something next. There's always something left. Put up our donation link, brother John, for those facing that quandry. I'm kidding. But there is always a fa our faith has to be connected to something beyond tomorrow and the next day but an end. Notice how Jesus said that the mockery comes to those who don't finish. And so we got to run this race with the finish in mind in second Peter chapter 3:es 3 and 4. Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers and their mockery. Notice the source of their mockery. They're walking after their own lust. No, remember that first. Remember that you cannot get truth from a critic. &gt;&gt; You cannot get truth from a scoffer. The mockers and scoffers seek understanding and truth. And the Bible says they cannot find it. &gt;&gt; And so the scoffers are walking after their own lust. And they say, "Where is the promise of his coming?" And what is it they say? For since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of creation. All things continue. In other words, it began. There's a foundation, but it's never ending. It's just this continuous uh unfolding without the hope of an end. And even in their eyes, they have this sense of, well, this is how it should end, and this is how it should be, and this is the promise of the end, and this is the last days, and it is at hand. And yet, here we are. It's been so many decades or so many hundreds of years or thousands of years, and everything just continues as it is because it's it's connected with that instinct of a mocker to look at a foundation and with a lack of a structure that's been completed and finished, mock it. So their mockery is in some ways connected to the lack of an end. And I believe that we must be convinced of a finish line. &gt;&gt; And if we can be convinced of an end, we should be focused on that. Not in a day or a date or even an idea of what that should look like, but rather the fact that we have there is an end to come. Then cometh the end. We've seen the prelude. We're in the masterpiece, but there's going to be a finish. So, we have an aim and a goal and objective about even if it's to scriptural principles related to this climactic finish that God wants to achieve in his bride. If you could look again at 1 Corinthians 15, we read, we went back over those verses in chapter in verses 21 where he says that death came by one man, life will come by another, but every man in his own order. says, "Then cometh the end." And he says, "When so the then cometh in when all things going to be delivered." Notice he says in verse 50, "Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, neither do corruption inherit incorruption." This is specifically related to this end. He says, "Behold, I show you a mystery." I just put this as the mystery of the kota because that kind of sounds mysterious. We should use this with other believers, right? Right? I said, "Well, do you understand the mystery of the Kota?" And they like, "Well, what is that?" Go, "Well, I think maybe you need to look into the mystery of the prelude." Right? They're like, "Is this a car? We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed." So, there's the sleeping and the living, &gt;&gt; but all of us are changing &gt;&gt; in a moment, in the twinkling of night, at the last trump. For the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed. Notice the finality of this, the last trump. This finality doesn't mean there's not any more trumpets or something to sound, but it relates to the end, the climax of something in particular, it shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed. For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality. So when this corruptal shall have put on incorruption and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, death is swallowed up in victory. &gt;&gt; What was it we read? That he must reign till death be put under his feet. The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death. I love the layering even of that prophecy because there is a death which is the result of sin that is completely vanquished in the bride. When there's those that do not taste death, that shows the justification. It shows the final uh uh condemning of death and the power no longer over the believer by by the blood of Jesus Christ. And then there's layerings of this prophecy to where in the end death is actually destroyed itself. &gt;&gt; And and it's that second death. &gt;&gt; But here he's talking about this time of this changing death is swallowed up in victory, not in defeat, not just in the lake of fire. So Paul writes this in 1 Thessalonians chapter 4 13 to18 and I I I find it um let me see if I could just turn there. He he mentions how don't be troubled e even as it were if it was by letter from us. And so I was thinking of how Paul instructed the believers to read his letters in churches. And so there was uh you know they take Paul's letters and they would read them and share them and they'd quote the Apostle Paul to one another. And and I thought that he said do not be troubled as it might some might think that even as letter by us and if we're worried about AI creating a fake message or sermon even where it's in the voice of brother don't worry about it. Paul's believers would be like, "Man, let me tell you, there was this forger back in the day who'd perfected Paul's exaggerated large handwriting, and man, you had to know. You just had to know God and have the Holy Spirit and not worry about whether or not the letter was from Paul." So, don't worry about what AI can do. There's something about the genuine that can always sp identify the artificial. &gt;&gt; And hey, if it agrees with the word, hey, &gt;&gt; I like that. But the you're you're trusting in the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; 1 Thessalonians chapter 4 13-18. But I would not have you be ignorant, brother, concerning them which are asleep. This is uh this is about uh um death. He's writing this to the Corinthians, but let me talk to you about those. I show you a mystery. We're not all going to sleep. It's what he's writing about and saying, "Wow, you know, if there's not a resurrection, then we of all people are most miserable." So, he's writing to the Corinthians in a way to encourage them and uplift them to look to the resurrection. Even you who have the resurrection and life in you now, we're still forwardlooking. So, we should not sorrow as others who have no hope because Peter said, "We begin born again unto a living hope, which is that incorruptible inheritance. For we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which uh them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him. For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain under the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep will not come before. because he said to the Corinthians, "Every man in his own order. For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God, and the dead in Christ shall rise first. Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air." Notice when he descends in this scriptural prophecy. It's not to set feet on earth through his own corporal body &gt;&gt; to reveal himself to the Gentiles. &gt;&gt; There's that coming even to the Jews &gt;&gt; that they're looking forward to. A coming of the corporal body to reveal himself to the Jews. That's after we're gone. &gt;&gt; But to the bride, this mystery of the kota, to the gentile church, which is his body that he reveals this mystery of in his own ministry, that upon this rock will I build and lay the foundation of my church. and he's going to finish it to this climactic finish. The Lord himself shall descend and we will meet him in the air. &gt;&gt; And so shall we ever be with the Lord. &gt;&gt; Those are just and the pun is intended rapturous words, &gt;&gt; thrilling words. So he says in verse 18, wherefore comfort one another with these words. &gt;&gt; So the kota is a source of comfort. That's right. &gt;&gt; The the true ending. Jesus who for the joy which was set before him endured the cross, the death, the agony, the rejection, the persecution, the beatings, the despising, the lies, the falsities, all those things. And then even the death, the excruciating death for the joy which was set after that but yet before him. So for us, we may look at our lives and say, "Oh, well, I I'm sick. I'm getting old. I may have to die." Listen, there is no shame in dying. &gt;&gt; Zero. None. &gt;&gt; Death has lost its sting. &gt;&gt; There's no victory. The devil may dance on your grave, but you'll forever be the soul that got away. &gt;&gt; He can burn your house to the floorboards. He can dance through your minds. He can do all sorts of things. He wants to torment you. a a and rail against you, but you'll never be his. &gt;&gt; And in the end, you will always be and he'll have he'll be finished. &gt;&gt; And so, we're looking past sufferings of this present times, graveside services, our own death. That's not going to I fear I'm not going to be afraid of death. Yes, it can seem to be bittersweet in terms of those you leave behind. But let us live such a life to if we actually left loved ones behind, they could take courage and the life that we lived and the legacy we left to say, I am not I may miss them, but for a few days or years, but one day I'll see them again in a meeting in the air. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because their lives weren't shaken and rattled at the prospect of death. &gt;&gt; They knew God worked all things together for good. Amen. &gt;&gt; We shall meet the Lord in the air together. &gt;&gt; Comfort one another with these words. &gt;&gt; That's the the coder, the resolution. The grave is dissonant, isn't it? The grave is foroding and suspenseful what lays in the end. But the the resurrection, the meeting in the air resolves everything. There's even this sense I believe even as brother Brandham described it as who's going to be there right there's this resolution and brother Bradam says in the sermon power of transformation this is the climax age this is the age beyond those denominations &gt;&gt; we could take um brother Bradam's sermons especially since we have 1200 of them and we have the words recorded that we could hear and we could transcribe and we could we could even use analytics to go through and comb through the message and we could try to distill it down to all these different points that if you're a Christian, you must do this and and and it could be incredibly misleading. But what one of the main things that you have to that brother Brandon was pointing to is the last times, the end of times. &gt;&gt; That that's the day and age, the time that we're living in is the climax of the ages, the ending time. And truthfully, I don't know that there should be much debate even for those who re would reject u brother Bram's ministry or they say they don't believe it's scriptural or if they don't even believe he was a prophet or even a Christian. Whatever those reasons are, if someone was to believe in Christ in the Bible, I think most people would probably agree that it's getting pretty late. &gt;&gt; They might have their own reasons for doing it, &gt;&gt; but that's one of the things that to recognize is this is a climactic time. the climax age, &gt;&gt; the age of the finish. In Zechariah 4:es 5-9, then the angel that talked with me answered and said, "No, knowest thou not what these be?" And kind of skipping into the middle of this, and he they said, "I I said, no, my lord." So what do these things mean? Then he answered and spake unto me, saying this, "This is the word of the Lord unto Zerubable, saying, not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, sayeth the Lord of hosts." &gt;&gt; How's he going to do it? He's the one composing. He's the one conducting. He's the one both to will and to do of his good pleasure in you. This treasure and earth and vessels. Who art thou, oh great mountain, before Zerubable. Thou shalt become a plain. &gt;&gt; This speaks of this ministry of Christ, the Lord himself. And he shall bring forth the headstone. That's the capstone, the finishing thereof with shoutings, crying, grace, grace unto it. &gt;&gt; This is that finishing. This is a finishing scene. Even in this chapter says, who has despised the day of small things? It's the finishing up. It's the buttoning up. Moreover, the word Lord came unto me, saying, "The hands of Zerubel have laid the foundation of this house. And though it's been mocked and laughed at and scorned and ridiculed as rubble, his hands shall also finish it. &gt;&gt; The Lord will bring again Zion. He will repair her walls. He will establish her. She will come forth." &gt;&gt; And thou shalt know that the Lord of hosts hath sent me unto it. There's a foundation. There is a beginning. There is an alpha. &gt;&gt; There is a first. &gt;&gt; There is an omega. There's a completion. There is a last. We are in the kod. &gt;&gt; We are in the final section of God's great masterpiece. &gt;&gt; It could be yet just a few more measures. It could be that as we've seen this beautifully unfolding entire section and it may seem that it lasts for quite some time but this is God how God composed it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Some some composers who've written songs, they have these outros or what we might say in gospel music a tag that plays out for a very long time. And God has written this last piece, this kota. And it seems to be much longer than perhaps we thought it was. But we're right here in these final this is the ending. Jeremiah 29 10-14. Well, I I I want to read this in closing. I have one more scripture after this one. And I'm reading this with the intent that I want you to put yourself in the the position of the Jews who were given a promised land, weren't faithful or obedient, and because of that, they were carried away captive into Babylon. &gt;&gt; But by prophecy, they were going to come out of that captivity. And we we likewise are here in Babylon. We're in this prison house of a flesh. We we suffer great pains. I would even say that a lot of people's criticisms of maybe you may feel that in your life the criticisms aren't so much about the fact that you have a foundation and you're a Christian, but it's everything that's happened afterwards. Not so much that you've backslid, but just the fact that you're all still here or you've lost this and this person doesn't believe and you don't have that and this hasn't happened and that hasn't happened. And it may be this sense of well everyone looks at this my testimony back then when I came to the Lord and everyone is now looking at me saying well where has it got you? You still just kind of I mean look where you are. &gt;&gt; But God's not done yet. &gt;&gt; For thus sayeth the Lord that after 70 years be accomplished at Babylon, I will visit you and perform my good word toward you in causing you to return to this place. This is very familiar scripture. For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, sayeth the Lord, thoughts of peace and not of evil, to give you an expected end. &gt;&gt; God's thoughts of you are these complete thoughts. He has he's for he has the the beginning from the end and the in between. Brother Jake, that's why I really loved your song this morning. Until then, &gt;&gt; it the song speaks of a beginning, the difficulties in the middle, but there's going to be a day and a time when my eyes will behold that city. But until then, &gt;&gt; going to persevere. I'm going to endure in the meantime, in the middle, &gt;&gt; knowing that that God has thoughts of peace for me to give you a finish. &gt;&gt; He calls it an expected end. Just that that stroke of his masterpiece, then shall you call upon me, and you shall go and pray unto me, and I will hearken unto you. This is what we do in the cod. This is what we do in the ending. If I'm in the ending, if I'm expecting an end, then I'm going to pray. I'm going to call upon him and you shall seek me and find me when you shall search for me with all your heart. Perhaps that's what we need to do about the end. &gt;&gt; And I will be found of you, sayaeth the Lord, and I will turn away your captivity, and I will gather you from all nations and from all the places whether I have driven you, sayith the Lord. and I will bring you again into the place whence I caused you to be carried away captive. &gt;&gt; I will bring you back home. &gt;&gt; The the beginning point they were driven away into all this dissonant meandering but then finally he resolves it brings them right back to what they believed in the first place. I think that we have a duty to look at the composition, the masterpiece, the word that God's given us and just see it accumulating all up. If we aren't convinced of the end time, if we're not convinced of the moment that we're living in, and we misperceive where we are now, it's very easy to misinterpret what has been, well, maybe God didn't do this for me, or maybe this wasn't real. And all this all these questions begin to arise. But if you can let it all accumulate up in your heart and consider whether it be of God or not, because we're in these last moments. If our musicians could come my final scriptures in Psalms 138 67 and 8. Though the Lord be high, yet hath he respect unto the lowly, the humble, the broken, the vulnerable. This is the necessity of evil. But the proud, he knoweth the far off. So he's high, but he's near the brokenhearted. He's near the humble. The proud he knows, but he's distant. So he says, "Though I walk in the midst of trouble, for in the time of trouble, he shall hide me. Though I walk in the midst of trouble, thou wilt revive me." Anybody here just need a little pickme up, a little reviving? Man, maybe I should preach a sermon on caffeine, spiritual caffeine. And and and because I mean, you think about it, we I just need a pickme up. I just need a jolt. And uh and and so whether whether you're trying to micro dose things to stay just primed and focused all day or taking something just to get jacked and real ripped up for a good workout, we want God to revive us. &gt;&gt; Thou shalt stretch forth thine hand against the wrath of mine enemies. Thy right hand shall save me. [Music] &gt;&gt; I believe he fights your battles now. Amen. &gt;&gt; I believe if you have experienced loss in this life that you ought to look at it differently and say, "Well, there's got to be victory in there somewhere." &gt;&gt; But no matter what you face now that has caused you to feel low regardless of your pain and your trouble and what you seem to be afflicted by, his hand is still reaching out to you. &gt;&gt; It will come against the mockery and the scoffing and the wrath of your enemies. Even that enemy which is death that would eat up your flesh, his right hand will save you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So he says in verse eight, the Lord will perfect that which concernth me. &gt;&gt; The Lord, this may not sound good in some context, but the Lord will finish you. &gt;&gt; He what what your fears are, your worries, those things that antagonize you, the Lord will accomplish. He'll give purpose and reason to it. This thing has bothered me my whole life. This haunts me. I don't know how to make sense of this. God will perfect, accomplish, resolve, and bring to an end all those things that worry you. All those things that bother you, all those things that concern you, he will finish it. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; He will perfect it. So the psalmist says, "Thy mercy, oh Lord, endureth forever." And he sings it as a prayer, but I believe we should take it as even an absolute promise. Forsake not the works of thine own hands. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You are his work. You are his masterpiece. I could say this with absolute certainty today. It's not too late to believe in a great finish. &gt;&gt; Amen. to look positively towards the word of God &gt;&gt; because he says, "Forsake not the works of thine own hands. You are his uh masterpiece. You are his building. You are his husbandry. You are his creation. You are the one that he's working on." And listen, even if there's times as he's forming us and we get along comfortable and we've tried to fight ourselves off the off the wheel and and maybe we fall and we get broken up, he just kind of gathers it back in again. Brother Victor, this is your chance to amen begins to work that clay a little bit, right? There's a point where you have to throw it away. Has to start all over and go through the process. But they could even still reuse that. But God knows just how to work it &gt;&gt; in your life. He's still making you. And sometimes where we are is maybe we're in that last firing part &gt;&gt; in the kiln. That's why it's getting so hot. &gt;&gt; But what is it doing? It's creating that glaze, &gt;&gt; that perfect patina, that beautiful look. &gt;&gt; And you look at it and go, "Oh man, when I've made this and when or when it was being made and I looked at it, I couldn't really see just how beautiful it was." But God used just the way he made me, &gt;&gt; just exactly what he allowed to take place. Remember the the flaw paradox? How God fills in the cracks with himself and he's producing something beautiful, something perfect. Sometimes we have in our minds what perfection looks like. But I just would rather take his way of perfection. Jesus Christ, the lamb of God, does not look like a perfect son of God. As I read his life story and the narrative and the arc of his life, I see a lot of things that are troublesome and disconcerting. But I believe the Bible what it says he did only that which the father told him to do. That he was without sin. And though he was beaten and broken and lied and persecuted and misunderstood, God has raised him up to great glory. And I believe that if God raised Jesus Christ from the dead and he sits at the right hand of God right now, forever making intercession for you, that we have every right to believe in a great glorious finish. And we're living in those moments right now. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This is the ending. &gt;&gt; This is the time. And God will perfect your masterpiece. &gt;&gt; We can have that assurance. We can believe it with all of our hearts. He will perfect. He will end. He will finish that which he started. If you're uncertain, just go back to the prelude. If you're uncertain, just go back to the whole composition. Start to rehearse again all the things that has unfolded through these different movements and these different and then you realize now we're living out the end that ties up all the loose ends that looks back and it builds momentum and it ends it with a meeting in the air. &gt;&gt; I'm living for that. We had a theme in our family for quite some time. We haven't lost this vision. But the rapture is our goal. &gt;&gt; And I'm more aware than ever that we're going to have to live the word to leave here. &gt;&gt; But I don't ever want to forget why I'm living. &gt;&gt; And it's because I want to meet him in the air. And if we go by the way of the grave, any one of us go by way of the grave, we know, we have a promise, we have an assurance that we'll meet the Lord in the air. and forever all of us together be with him. If we could stand today, [Music] take that hand of faith and grab a hold of the key because that's what the ending is. Christ the resurrection and the life. He that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live. And he that believeth in me, shall never die. &gt;&gt; There's going to be a people on earth who are alive and remain. I believe we're living in a great time. Let's pray. Our gracious heavenly father, as we close this service in prayer, I'm praying that your grace would be upon your people, Lord. just feeling this inspiration through early last week and just filled it building for some time. My prayer is that these words would comfort us. I know that we face a lot of pressure especially in this day and age where there's so much so many podcast and blogs and vlogs and uh so many influencers whether it be Tik Tok or through shorts or X or whatever it might be that tell us all about family planning and what it means to be a traditional wife and what it means to be a man and how to run homeschool properly and having a vision and all these lofty ideals sometimes that just bear down so hard on us and we feel like, man, I got to come up with a business plan. I got to get a private placement memorandum together. I got to figure out my mission statement. Lord, I believe that we can say very simply on a very high level. I want to see you one day in the air. That the time that I'm living in now is I'm living for a rapture. I'm living for a change. And Lord, I know that has a lot of ramifications, but it kind of sets that overarching principle to ask myself what things are expedient, what think what things aren't. And it can just be as simple as that is that I want my life to be lived by the word so that I hasten the day that I see you as you are in that glorified body. Am I in my own? and to ever be with the Lord. Lord, may we have a greater vision for Dakota, this ending, this great climactic finish where these notes are being played out. We're not looking for another movement, Lord. We're not looking for another section. We're not looking for another composer or leader or chorus. This is the ending. May we be faithful in it, Lord. Comfort those hearts that are hurting. Lord, there's others who've lost loved ones. Others, Lord, that we've heard of that have uh being buried, Lord, is even those that are facing great trials, great crossroads of decisions to be made. Our prayers are with them, Lord. We love you. We pray a special blessing upon brother Andrew today and his 40th birthday. We appreciate him. Be with him in his travels. Be with his family as he leaves them behind. Be with my family, Lord, as we travel. Lord, bless these people. Lord, I honestly say just buried in my soul that my wife and I have found vacation so much more enjoyable because we so look forward to being back home with these believers. And so, Lord, we know that as our trip winds down, there'll be no dread in returning back. But we pray that you bless us on our trip and be with those that we leave behind. We love you. We ask this in the name of Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
