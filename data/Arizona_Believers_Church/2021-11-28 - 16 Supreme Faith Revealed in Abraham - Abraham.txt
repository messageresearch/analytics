TRANSCRIPT
========================================
genesis chapter 18 verses 1 to 15 by god's grace and i've actually been so bold as to put the end on my title slide i think i may be finishing this subject but the way these things connect it's really just jesus christ part 1 billion and 12 or whatever we're just really preaching christ every service but in this i just feel it just sealed up in my heart and something that had been kind of a target of mine we're going to get to today and i'm just very very excited to be able to minister this morning in genesis chapter 18. i'd like to read verses 1 to 15 uh just to set this uh kind of the context for where we're going to end today and the lord appeared unto him in the plains of memory he's speaking about abraham and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day and he lift up his eyes and looked and lo three men stood by him and when he saw them he ran to meet them from the tent door and bowed himself toward the ground so abraham in the tent door sees the lord coming and he sees that there's these two other men with the lord and he said my lord if now i have found favor in thy sight past not away i pray thee from thy servant let a little water i pray you be fetched and wash your feet and rest yourselves under the tree and i will fetch a morsel of bread and comfort you your hearts after that you shall pass on for therefore ye come to your servant and they said so do as thou has said and abraham hastened into the tent unto sarah and said make ready quickly three measures of fine meal knead it and make cakes upon the earth and abraham ran under the herd and fetched it fetched a calf tender and good and gave it unto a young man and he hasted to dress it and he took butter and milk and the calf which he had dressed and set it before them and he stood by them under the tree and they did eat and they said unto him where is sarah thy wife he said behold in the tent and he said i will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life and lo sarah thy wife shall have a son and sarah heard it in the tent door which was behind him now abraham and sarah were old and well stricken in age and it ceased to be with sarah after the manner of women therefore sarah laughed within herself saying after i am waxed old shall i have pleasure my lord being old also and the lord said unto abraham wherefore did sarah laugh saying shall i have a surety bear a child which i'm old is anything too hard for the lord and that the time appointed i will return unto thee according to the time of life and sarah shall have a son then sarah denied saying i laughed not for she was afraid and he said nay but thou didst laugh let's bow our heads in prayer heavenly father we thank you for your presence which we have felt this morning lord just the atmosphere of worship and the praise and thanksgiving that's been offered we ask that you would come now and take the words which we have read and just anoint them and bless them to our hearts as we desire to see jesus christ in the word lord may you make yourself known to us through it as we surrender ourselves to you pray in your blessings upon this part we commit it to you in jesus name amen you can be seated as i mentioned where the looking at the subject of supreme faith and hope hoping to come to the end of this series that has been in 16 parts and kind of was a continuation of the subject of blind trust and bad faith i would just really encourage you maybe to pay close attention as we have maybe a very simple thought very direct but it's going to get tied together um very strictly and just would probably need your attention as we do so we've been through these prior parts and i'm going to summarize uh last sunday um try to use some statements to summarize last sunday but through the first 15 or so parts 14 parts we were just looking at how abraham is an example of our faith and he has been determined and set we even see scripturally he's the father of us all he's a father of faith he's affording us this example that god was beginning something in abraham the beginning of christianity the beginning of judaism and a very important figure in scripture and so he's also determined to be and set in a particular way to be an example in the time that we're living today and so we view him and we recognize him as being holding even the example of rapturing faith and our desire in looking at the example of abraham was not to create a greater legend about abraham to where we kind of looked to him as an idol but rather we could look to him more as a role model and and him being a station being in a position that we ourselves can achieve so we wanted abraham's faith to become relatable we saw that in different aspects of whether we looked at genesis chapter 1 to 4 and how abraham's calling in his life connected back to what was happening in the first four chapters of genesis we saw even how genesis chapter 11 sets the context for god calling abraham now he was called out of babylon we saw it even in him being called away from lot there's a lot of different ways that we could relate to it and so that's what we were going through those many different parts at the beginning and last sunday we wanted to make this simple point that the story of abraham is meant to reveal the character of god not just the testimony of abraham that when we read about abraham's life we gather a lot about abraham and we learn a lot of details and we can piece together how old he was and how many children he had and the different wives he had after sarah was passed away and him being remarried and having children there's a way that we could begin to gather a lot of information about abraham and his sons and then his grandchildren and great-grandchildren but the story is meant to reveal god's character not just tell us something about abraham or just tell us something about the faith of abraham and so god uses the life of abraham to hide a mystery about himself that there's something about god that's being revealed in the story of abraham so we use we want to look at the life of abraham and allow it to reveal to us the attributes of god something about god's disposition something about his character and what really began to stand out to me as i looked at the life of abraham and just was reading through his life over and over again it really stood out to me how that god took abraham and he didn't just tell them hey this is what you're going to do or this is what you're supposed to do like here's a to-do list and i want you to get it done but god literally took abraham under his wing and mentored him and discipled him into supreme faith that abraham was not just told go out there have a son and then sacrifice him to me he was like all right here i am 75 years old i guess i need my wife needs to have a boy and then he needs to be old enough for me to sacrifice him and he had to kind of walk through those paces with this this goal ahead of him that seems to be so insurmountable but god just mentored him to the supreme faith that he expressed on mount moriah when he offered up isaac upon the altar and so as god took abraham and put him through different trials and different testings and different circumstances we realize that abraham's learning something about himself he's learning something about the promise but more importantly he was learning about god and this is a god that was unknown he was shrouded in polytheism and the one true god was not being worshiped and so god want needed to put abraham in circumstances to where abraham would learn the nature and character of god that when he makes a promise he's going to fulfill it so when there's a famine that comes up in the land that i've promised you you don't need to abandon the land i promise to bless you in the land and even though it doesn't look like you're being blessed in the land persevere in the land that i called you in but abraham gets a little worried because of the famine goes down into egypt gets in trouble and and we'll look at this here in a moment about those particular instances but then god rescues them right out of that and he's learning god made me a promise he's not going to abandon me and i think we could all probably just for a moment be honest with ourselves we've made great professions of faith i'm the elect i'm his daughter i'm his son i'm going into rapture i'm filled with the holy ghost and then we have those very moments where we wonder what if god's abandoned us and maybe i've made a mistake too many times and maybe i should have done this and i should have done that and there's this feeling that we begin to have of oh no i'm in i'm in trouble maybe god's uh not going to bless me maybe god's abandoned me maybe i deserve to be kicked out and become an orphan again but all these circumstances that happened in abraham's life speak also to us we realize that what god was doing with abraham is revealing his character and he was teaching abraham to trust and god also is teaching us to trust and god is demonstrating his trustworthiness we can read it you know trust in me and we read it and we ought to believe it okay i can trust in him but there's something different about experiencing someone's trustworthiness you can trust me and i can say hey i promise you in the coming year my new year's resolution is to wash every single one of those cars and wax your car i'm going to do it and you can say hey he said he was going to do it i trust him but there's not there would be nothing like me actually doing what i said i would do and realizing you know when he says he's going to do something he's going to do it and so we might trust people implicitly in the beginning just trust them take them at face value but once they do something then you're actually building trust and this is what god was doing he was demonstrating this trustworthiness he was demonstrating faithfulness god was we talk about faithful abraham well he's called faithful abraham why because he submitted himself to a faithful god and he became what he was submitted to that abraham was called a friend of god so abraham's faithfulness was an expression of the kinship and the relationship and the intimacy he had with god he was faithful abraham because he had a faithful friend god and that's what we we begin to recognize for ourselves god is teaching us to trust and then whenever we find ourselves again in similar circumstances we don't all of a sudden say wait a minute wait a minute i thought you were teaching me to trust and and in that circumstances you taught me that i could trust you and now i'm right back in the same situation what is he wanting us to do demonstrate trust and so in abraham's life he was given opportunities to trust and then once he learned to trust then he could demonstrate trust and ultimately that's what he does on mount moriah is he demonstrated this absolute trust and confidence in god to the point to where the very nature of god is relied upon to be able to raise the dead and that's that supreme faith that's expressed in abraham and i feel that even in that it really summarizes the point that we've been wanting to express and so i want to take some moments i'm just going to some of these things i know will be a very strict review for us but this is just my way of trying to end this series on on supreme faith revealed in abraham and our goal i remember in the very beginning we expressed it this way our goal was to make the faith of abraham so practical that it can work in us to do to see the supernatural to experience the supernatural that we make abraham's faith not legendary and an idol but rather something so practical and attainable that it work we allow faith to work in us to the supernatural or to the supreme to perfect faith to achieve the things that god desires to achieve in our lives and in hebrews chapter 12 verse 2 it says this is instructed to us that we ought to be looking unto jesus the author and finisher of our faith now we recognize scripture that abraham is the father of our faith he's the father of us all he's the father of our faith but christ is the author and the finisher of him one the the dis the expression that abraham is the father of our faith holds a certain image and a certain relationship to us but christ is the author and the finisher of our faith christ himself is the author or the the originator of our faith and if faith has begun in you the same one who has started the work is just and faithful to finish the work he is the author and finisher or the perfecter of our faith so it's important for us to realize that if we know that we have genuine faith then that has this origin this genesis of of coming forth and being raised up within our lives but faith is to lead us to a destiny it has a beginning and it's going to have a destiny it's going to have something that it achieves and brings us to and as abraham believed god he is the father of our faith abraham believed god so therefore he gives us this example as dear children we follow after his example in that he believed god and then following his example we believe in christ that we're not believing in abraham but we believe in christ and as abraham believed in the promise and then he believed in the power that promised and achieved the potential of it then we likewise believe in christ the promise of christ the power of christ in order to receive and fully participate in all the potential of christ that's the example that abraham has given us he believed in god and in the same way we believe and trust in god we believe in christ now a statement that has been um just the real driving force behind this and i've read it several times but it's been many services since we've read it i wanted to read it again just to read to to bring this in at the very end here he says one thing that we brother branham making this statement in the sermon balm and gilead the one thing that we have to move up to now is a supreme faith to what we've had so we have faith but then faith is a supreme can come to supremacy to its full expression it's perfect expression he says we we need to move up to a supreme faith to what we have had he says you cannot have that faith until you know perfectly what you are doing you cannot have that faith until you perfectly know what you're doing now that seems to be a um uh we could say uh to know perfectly that almost could make it seem a little bit unreachable but i love the steps that we do we can take to get there and he says that he uses this as the example you just say well i'm going home i'm gonna go out and start the car so if we said i'm going to go start the car i'm going to drive home he says that's all an act of faith for us to say i'm leaving this room and i'm going to go get in my car i'm going to start my car and drive home this is on some level an act of faith tomorrow i meet you at a certain place and when it happens we'd say he says that's all an act of faith because you've just done it so much because it's a regular routine with you you realize tomorrow morning at 7 30 when you get your coffee at just exactly the same time or whether you drive to do it or your coffee maker does it and you you're on that same routine every morning that's an act of faith and you expect it i'm going to have coffee at 7 30 in the morning you know there's some people that you know you could meet them at certain places and right on the dot i know they're going to be there right at this exact moment some of us who uh commute to work if we're not all still working remotely and you drive to work and you always leave the house at the same time you'll find yourself at stoplights and you can always see somebody else who's right there with you going the same way and you don't even know where they live and where they come from or where their work but you go there's the white tesla again and you just know this is the routine we're all in the routine it's in this routine that brother venom is identifying that on some level these are all acts of faith he says you've just done it so much it's a regular routine with you and he says well that's the way the things of god are this is important to i think to recognize that things that become routine and take preeminence in our lives naturally there's a way that the things of god can begin to take preeminence and become routine in our lives spiritually he says after you've trusted him watched him do so many things until it becomes just like a regular routine so this is something that i'm wanting to emphasize in this last service you trust him you watch him do things over and over again and since you trust him and he and he demonstrates his trustworthiness then it just becomes a regular routine and then he puts it in this pinnacle this climax and that's the condition i think the church will be in just before the coming of the lord so the rapture will just go right on that way the rapture is going to take place and go on and come to its completion it's summation in the same way that you every day through daily acts of faith achieve the things that you're supposed to do that the chur the rapture is going to go on that way it'll just be a regular routine of following the scriptures and the plans of god we can make the rapture the change of our body this resurrection and rapture that's to transpire and we can make it this just a specific particular moment on the calendar that wow we're just kind of holding on and abiding our time until this great climactic moment when we're all going to be caught up to meet the lord in the air but we have to recognize that if we want to participate in that then we need to be in the regular routine of following the scriptures and the plans of god so we're not necessarily planning every moment of every day to somehow figure out a way to change our body to make it like this huge climactic event every day where something supreme something of mount moriah experience every day but just having daily acts of faith towards building us to the place to where we can trust god follow the scriptures and the plans of god and i believe the example of abraham shows us how supreme faith comes by daily acts of faith towards just a routine and i think even that phrase acts of faith it uh pondered it yesterday this the acts of faith it can seem to have to be very high you know acts of faith it seems to be out of reach and because we've designated certain events to be acts of faith that if i could somehow have an opportunity to pray for someone who is sick and then pray for them and then immediately they get well we think that's the that's an act of faith you know lay hands on somebody if if there was somebody who was dead and and we were able to pray for him and they were to raise the life that's an act of faith and we we have certain things that we would place in the level of acts of faith and really the truth of the matter is some of us narrow acts of faith to such a strict definition that we would never have the chance unless a preacher said hey it's saturday night why don't you come up and join us in the prayer line so you can benefit and participate in the acts of faith because that's almost where we put all of them is in in atmospheres like that and circumstances like that and and i as i was pondering i thought that it's and i'm not saying that this is so but i want to share this just to broaden our understanding of what an act of faith is we think about the book's book of acts and we say well when the god when that tree puts forth another branch he's going to write in other books of acts behind it but remember the book of acts are not the acts of the apostles or the acts of the disciples but it's the acts of the holy spirit and so it was the it was god demonstrating power through yielded vessels and god taking chosen vessels and working himself through them so it was the acts of the holy spirit and it was the disciples then it wasn't their acts but the the acts of the disciples was very simply to believe the word to believe it and to not narrow it i mean if they would have said well we believe in christ but we don't believe in divine healing we believe in christ and we don't believe in miracles we believe in the gift of the holy ghost well we believe that all you must do is be circumcised and recognize the laws and just accept christ so it's kind of judaism plus jesus uh they they had to believe the word and all the word and because they believed the word and they yield it to the word then the holy spirit could act through a vessel that believed so it takes it out of this realm that daily acts of faith for us are not i must be doing the acts of the holy spirit but i have to do the act of faith i have to believe that's my action that's what i'm doing is i'm believing and in believing that i put myself in a position for the holy spirit to act on my behalf or through me and so the daily acts of faith are is just that believing the act of faith i'm believing today in john chapter 6 verses 28 to 29 it says then jesus said unto him then then said they unto him this is their question what shall we do that we might work the works of god what can we do to have acts of faith what can we do to demonstrate the power of the holy ghost jesus answered and said to them this is the work of god that you believe on him whom he hath sent how can i do the works of god i love how it's narrowed from works and so oh let's just think about all the things we can do all the works that we could set forth and the things we could do with our hands and the things that we could demonstrate the things that we could display and jesus just distills it all down to one he says this is the work you want to do mighty works well then you just have to do one that's to believe on christ like that's the work that's what we do and if we if our faith has limits if our faith is qualified if our faith is not um fully uh uh fully open to believe all things then that's the that's the limitation on the acts that's why sometimes people just want to know whether or not you believe uh do you believe that god is a healer do you believe in divine healing do you believe that the bible says you shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover i was in a circumstance i'm just using this one time as an example that then there's when the circumstance demands it and you're a believer then you can demonstrate an act of faith and all if you're going to pray for somebody you don't need to sit down and say now um which bible do you use i believe in the king james version oh you believe the american standard version well you know good luck take an aspirin get some rest and you just kind of back out because they don't read the same bibles you do you just could say do you believe in god yes i believe in god do you believe that jesus christ is a healer do you believe in the bible these certain principles and they and they're in that moment they give a cent to the word of god and faith then you're creating an atmosphere to to pray for them because they're believing the word and i was in a circumstance one time there's hundreds of prospective lawyers taking the bar exam in dallas 100 it may have been a thousand and we're all gathered in this lobby of this building uh to go up and and take this over three days you took the bar exam i don't mean to lose anybody right now if you're finding out i passed the bar isn't that a good testimony if a preacher passes the bar you're like good good work uh but this was a different bar and i did pass on my first try and so i am a licensed lawyer so i don't know if we need to sing take the name of jesus with you but um in that we're there in the basement and somebody that i had been i think they'd graduated number one in their class at ut law and they had been in my pre-my bar prep course and i knew them and i kind of got to know know her husband a little bit and in the on my way walking up she's having a complete meltdown in the parking lot her husband's there going it's going to be okay and she's completely lost it and as we walk into the lobby i asked her husband i said what's going on she's had an adverse reaction to medicine she was disabled and she was given special accommodations to take the exam she had a disability and then she was completely this is a brilliant student number one in her class at ut law i believe and here's the second day of the bar exam third day of the bar exam and she's she has lost herself and hundreds of people begin to gather and there's it's a big commotion and i had a prayer cloth that i had in my pocket um and that my dad had given me and i'd taken it and i was gonna wear it each day that took the bar exam and i just went up to her and i said do you ask do you mind if i pray for he goes no please and in the presence of everybody i took the prayer cloth out i said in the bible they took garments of paul and they prayed over them and then they and they put them on people who were sick and had evil spirits and they were delivered i said do you believe that she says yes i believe i said do you mind if i take this prayer cloth it's been prayed over it was uh that was worn by a prayed over by a man of god and i gave it to her and i said i want to lay this on you i want to pray for you and believing in the word of god that you're going to be healed and everything's going to be okay and we prayed for her and i put in my pocket and i went up to take the exam and right before the exam started she had uh she come over and she she said i'm feeling fine everything's left i feel like i'm doing great i'm doing fine and at lunch break i was sitting off to the side and she ran up to a table of friends she said i don't even know what happened but all of a sudden it just left me like that she said she was completely fine and because all i had to do is point her to the word just to believe in the word that's the work of god that we all have to do is believe god believe in his word believe in christ i don't necessarily like to share a lot of my personal testimonies and you could just take that as anecdotal from brother aaron but it's an example of in the moment just you point to the word get them to believe in the word of god and this is what jesus is doing this is the work of god that you believe on him whom he hath sent so we find in the book of acts the acts of the of the apostles was to believe the word and then the acts of the holy spirit begin to demonstrate itself in acts chapter 12 verse 24 it says but the word of god grew and multiplied this is what you find to be the the real indication of the book of acts is the word of god grew it became greater and it multiplied it increased the word of god is increasing getting greater that gives greater opportunities to faith because faith cometh by hearing hearing by the word of god so as the word increased and grew faith becomes more robust it says it again in acts chapter 19 verse 20 so mightily grew the word of god and as the word of god mightily grew which means to increase in strength it says and it prevailed it gave power to overcome so this is the work of god to believe the word the example of abraham shows us how that supreme faith comes by daily acts of faith then i must daily then what i do daily is i daily believe the promise that's what i do i daily believe the word of god so that the word of god can grow and multiply increase in order for there to be power to overcome and that was abraham's challenge his challenge was to believe god every day not necessarily to see any difference in his his physicality not to see any difference in in sarah and not necessarily to see that he could build a fence around all of canaan that was promised to him and chase out all the canaanites and become the ruler of this great nation and to see thousands of progeny in his lifetime that wasn't his challenge to see that his challenge was to every day just believe god to trust him daily and could we all agree that's our challenge just to everyday trust him did you find yourself kind of hitting your stride and you're kind of believing you know hey everything's gonna be fine everything's gonna be great god's gonna take care of me ever all that's going well and all of a sudden a new variant comes out i don't i've only read it so i don't know how you say it omicron or something there might be a more fancy way to say it but um and all of a sudden a new one comes out and you're like oh no it's another opportunity to trust god right another opportunity just to take god in his word and just believe and trust in him and that's what our challenge is regardless of what happens oh it looks like they're going to lay people off or looks like this is going to happen it looks like that's going to happen that we have to daily learn to trust god second corinthians chapter 4 verse 16 for which cause we faint not but though our outward man perish yet inward the inward man is renewed day by day just taking that phrase to ponder that phrase the inward man is renewed day by day it means to cause to grow up to make new to make fresh i love to make unworn anybody feel weary sometimes come on i could testify for a while i i just there's just a weariness that that takes place and you just get weary and wearing like i just need a break why because we feel worn and maybe the the outward man whether it be your physical body and even your mind can be weary there is a renewing of the inward man it's to be fresh to be unworn that's a promise to us this is something that we could recognize no matter how much pain i have in my joints no matter how much my mind plagues me there can be a renewing and a refreshing of the inner man this is a daily it says the inward man is renewed day by day i wouldn't take it to say oh well since it's not being renewed i must not be a christian if it's not being renewed you're not participating in all the benefits of being a christian because the inward man can be and is renewed day by day listen you you're not going to get the inward man's not going to get a a spiritual or soul arthritis you don't you don't need you don't need a fair gun for your soul so to speak it is renewed day by day it's it's it's there for you to take benefits from jesus says in luke chapter 9 verse 23 if any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me i realize that there is a there's a danger in kind of watering down what the meaning of the cross is and and to make it into something that's oh it's just your tax burden or it's just this or it's just that it's putting up with the in-laws on holidays and to make the cross seem really really innocent and neat and clean and pretty because it does speak of a death it was a very gruesome death to speak of the cross as a crucifixion and so if jesus said take up your cross everybody they would be going this this is in the this is speaks of a crucifixion and and the tradition of one burying their own cross to be hung on as a as a murderer as a criminal or as one that was a revival this would be something that would be a tremendous reproaching and so i believe that we ought to take it in that context but then to also we don't want to put in such a way to where we're not daily having opportunities to take up the burden now well i'm not being asked to die today and i'm not being you know threatened to be killed tomorrow so i must i don't have a cross to bear but daily there's a burden there's a cross there's a responsibility that we pick up and we daily don't miss this part daily follow him such an important aspect of just beginning to realize this has to be a daily walk a daily communion a daily uh yielding a daily opportunity to be renewed and refreshed day by day to become unworn to take up my cross this burden this belief in jesus christ the reproach of it and to follow him something that i've been reminded of through fellowship recently and then a sermon uh that had been shared with me brother tim daughter preached on what is that to you follow me follow thou me it doesn't matter whatever what you know what is it to you that this person does this and this person says this has happened and this person says they're going to do this what is it to you what everyone else is doing you must personally be following christ daily take up your cross daily in the message is your life worthy i believe it's in another place it's called is your life worthy of the gospel i think there's a couple instances maybe where it's preached or just it could be i could have abbreviated it here is your life worthy of the gospel i think there's a few titles on it and brother branham says it this way we have to follow every day every hour of the day every step of the way we've got to be led by the lord jesus christ this is the standard now every day every hour of the day every step of the way we've got to be led by the lord jesus christ if we don't we take an on take an organizational life quite a mouthful organizational life doesn't necessarily have to have an org behind it or an ink or have to be associated with an official organization but you can just become so organized in your own self to where it's just more discipline and carnal effort and it's more organizational life as opposed to true genuine leadership of the holy spirit in your life and he says and the life that doesn't follow christ daily is not worthy now i am not i'm not setting this forth at all i believe we have we all have an opportunity to uh to read this these sermons and to listen to this and the thought that he's sharing and so what i'm expressing to you in this is not does not change the meaning at all in this but yet i'm kind of approaching the mindset that immediately we begin to say something that somebody is worthy is your life worthy of the gospel it says a life that doesn't follow christ daily is not worthy now there's a way that we immediately begin to think of of i'm not worthy but worthy means having or showing the qualities or abilities that merit recognition in a specific way so it's having or showing qualities or having or showing abilities that merit or recognition a specific certain kind of uh um recognition and so when we read this it says a life that doesn't follow christ daily is not worthy we ask ourselves is my life worthy of the gospel it's not that we would be worth the gospel or am i deserving of am i worthy to receive it am i worthy of it am i uh have i been deemed privileged enough uh to be a beneficiary of it and am i good enough that i could receive it and be blessed by it that's not the question is your life worthy of the gospel if that was the question none of us would have it right if here's the gospel ready to be received and then well is your life worthy is your life worthy and just every sunday we got together and i had the gospel in a bowl the gospel here and you're going to get some gospel and i had you had to demonstrate worthiness to get it then we would never it would still if we started with a 10 it would be out of 10. the church has been here 100 years and no one's ever gotten a dip out of this because we would never be worthy in that sense of the gospel but this is what i want you to ponder in terms of the question is your life worthy and it says a life that's not daily following christ is not worthy it's not are you deserving of it but rather think about it this way is our life getting the value or the worth of the gospel that's the question that's being asked of us if these things aren't in your life are you really getting the benefit and the value of the gospel is your life indicating that you're receiving the benefits of the gospel in no way is it to turn it around to where now it's it's works and you've got to deserve the holy ghost and you've got to make yourself good enough to be sealed by god but it's a question of if a life that doesn't daily follow christ is not recognizing the value and the worth of the gospel and what's made available to us and i see this example in the life of abraham in a very simple way and again i want to i want to kind of qualify once again that the life of abraham and i'll mention it here in a moment lord willing the life of abraham details very significant peaks in his life very significant events that take place in his life and so we see these very dramatic images of abraham trusting god and these supernatural miracles that take place but that's not all that's transpiring in his life but abraham in his life there's daily acts of faith daily contacts with god that are the same ones that we can have it's not that we're all waiting for the day that we're just sitting there in our front door in our subdivision kind of looking around drinking our our mud water and all of a sudden we see three men walking down the street saying jesus is coming hey honey make some bread you know son go fetch a lamb and that that's the experience we're gonna have that's that's a that's a special instance in abraham's life but brother bannon makes the statement in going beyond the camp in the case of abraham in his camp it was almost an everyday occasion that abraham met god he talked to him now you could take this back into that whole that mindset of acts of faith they're laying hands on the sick and they're recovering that's an act of faith but you take it toward daily acts of faith have to be on that level and then you think that every day abraham got a vision from god every day melchizedek visited him every day god bailed and fleshed that sat down and ate a lamb sandwich with him but that's not what he was saying every day abraham met god and talked with him now you have that opportunity every day the greatest privilege a mortal man has ever had is to bow his head in his heart and speak face to face to god and you do that when you pray child of mine when you look into this word you're looking at me face to face do you realize that we have been what's been made available to it to us is the same experience that abraham had almost an everyday occasion where he met god and he talked to him in the message without money and without price brother ben i'm talking about the exodus and how that god gave them uh manna from heaven and quail said god fed them every night with bread made by angels hands without money without price and today that bread represents christ spiritual life come down from heaven to give his life and says and god gives his children every day a new experience this is not done to be a litmus test of whether or not you're worth a daily experience with god and are you worthy of every day do you have a new experience every day well if you don't then you're not a child of god no it's to remind us that as children of god he gives us a new experience every day and if we don't have one it's just merely because you haven't exercised your right to get it i know i've been a rito's evangelist for some time i don't know if i've ever evangelized matt's big breakfast highly recommend it i went to their grand opening of their store off of in um in glendale we know the owners we got to know them years ago when we lived here before don't read into that at all we just ate there a lot and uh and so we were one of the first 50 people at the grand opening so all six members of my family got a card for free bacon for six months every visit and that means every single day every single member of my family can go into matt's big breakfast and wave the card and get a plate of really really good peppered bacon thick cut cooked perfectly and we could do that every day if we wanted and i don't even think we do it every week but i could if i wanted to right because that's what the card gets me and you may not every day have a new experience but you could have one if you wanted to because that's what god does that's what he gives i don't want there to be any defeat in the fact that you're not in the practice or routine of doing that and feel like well i must not be a christian no i'm telling you this is just something you can strive for this is something you can believe for this is something that you can have faith to believe that tomorrow morning when you put your feet on the ground you can say today i have the benefit of receiving a new experience a fresh experience a daily renewal the inward man to be renewed and just to have that kind of attitude to believe that this is god's promise and if it doesn't happen to you and you feel like it hasn't taken place lord there must be something wrong on my end because your word never fails i'm going to keep believing because that's the challenge that i'm in right now is to learn to trust and so i want to demonstrate trust it's the daily acts of faith and their simplicity that's going to lead us to this place in our own lives of a mount moriah experience that abraham had that the scripture recognizes as being the moment that abraham's faith was made perfect i'm not leaving that or transitioning from that but this just forms an important foundation and now there's just going to kind of be just two turns here and i want to just look at abraham's life in very quickly some uh some something uh some some something up there you go yeah some something some some dim sum that's a good idea today for lunch are there any good dim sum places in the valley i haven't found one yet still looking in genesis 15 15 says thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace this is god's speaking to him this is a prophecy to him that he must have recognized jehovah shalom is making himself known to me i'm going to go to my my father's in peace i'm not going to die of violent death i'm not going to it's not going to be tragedy you're going to go to your fathers in peace thou shalt be buried in a good old age god promised abraham long life and a good old age in genesis chapter 25 verses 7 to 8 it says and these are the days of the years of abraham's life which he lived 103 score in 15 years 175 years he lived 103 score in 15 years then abraham gave up the ghost and died in a look at this a good old age exactly what god said you'd be buried in a good old age and he died in a good old age an old man and full of years and was gathered to his people now ponder this for a moment the life of abraham is said to be 175 years old what we what we have covered scripturally is bake about a hundred years from genesis chapter 12 until genesis chapter 25 about 100 years of living so if we look at this from genesis 12 to genesis 25 that covers a hundred years of a man's life and then when you begin to look and you could just read the headings in your bible and begin to read about the instances you'd find that there's not a lot of stories about a man's life if he lived 100 years in other words my goodness you have books on former presidents that are this thick right and all they're doing is just kind of covering a little bit of their military history and eight years of presidency and you get volumes and volumes and volumes but then when it comes to abraham's life i want you to just look at what it looks like in my bible 175 years right here this is it and think about the books that are written about other people and here's a life 175 years of living and all that's recorded in some of our bibles is it maybe a dozen pages a dozen chapters about a man's life but what's recorded are the highlights that god wanted us to learn by i really do believe that if there was something significant in the life of abraham that would that would would be critical or necessary for us to believe more in jesus christ than it would have been put in there for us to learn by it because the scripture is the things that are recorded of abraham are there for our instruction and for our benefit as it says in romans 15 4 and for whatsoever things were written before time were written for our learning that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope every event recorded in abraham's life is given sufficient context to encourage our daily faith that you can read these and take something from it this is the word of god this is this has happened this isn't mythology this isn't a love story that's just some sort of fiction you haven't gotten this story out of the fiction section of the bookstore but this is something where every event that's recorded in abraham's life i believe there's sufficient context within the scripture that god can quicken something to us to encourage us in daily faith that we might have comfort from the scripture comfort from the story that it can make us patient because it says the patience and comforts of the scripture will give us hope there's something written in these stories then if we take from abraham and i'm wanting just to emphasize just what a narrow view of abraham's life that we have abraham lived and i think there's maybe two different schools of thought but the definitive that in genesis chapter 12 he's 75 years old i think it's generally accepted but only 70 to 75 years of his life are recorded or not there's up to 70 or 75 nothing's recorded of abraham because in genesis chapter 12 he's 75 years old in chapter 16 when ishmael is born he's 86 years old genesis chapter 21 isaac is born he's 100 years old and genesis chapter 22 just one chapter later 15 years later he's 115 years old when he offers up isaac upon the altar 40 years are covered from genesis chapter 12 to genesis chapter 22 and you look at the events that are recorded i could just rattle them off too in two minutes but i'm not going to do it because i need every minute this morning there's 40 years covered very very quickly from the moment that he leaves out of iran and he's going to travel down into canaan to the moment that he's offering isaac upon the altar it's a he's 115 years old 40 years is represented in genesis chapter 23 when sarah dies he's 127 years old when you think about that the significant events that are recorded in his life it's only 57 years that are recorded the moment that he's called out of haran to the moment that he it that his wife dies sarah dies which is really uh you know the next significant event in chapter 24 is finding a wife for isaac so the story begins to focus in on isaac chapter 25 um is just the descendants of abraham and his death and so you think sarah dies in chapter 23 isaac gets the wife in 24 abraham dies in 25 57 years of his life recovered and then in the in up to chapter 23 43 years is glossed over in his death 43 more years by genesis 25. i'm sharing this just to think about when we view his life over a hundred year period i would want his faith to become more relatable and at the same time more admirable i wouldn't wouldn't want you to lose respect for it because think about it he only melt he he met with melchizedek had communion with melchizedek once had lunch with the lord once we realized it's the same manifestation of god but in in these years of these visitations and a hundred years of life that's recorded has communion with melchizedek has a lamb sandwich with the lord in genesis 18 and you realize he has these visions in genesis 15 the lord speaks to him in genesis 17 these are the highlights of a man's life every day wasn't a dream every day was in a vision every day wasn't well it's noon i guess the lord's gonna show up that wasn't the life that he lived but he did have the privilege of every day communion with god he did have the privilege of every day having a touch point with god with respect to believing the promise he had the privilege every day of communion with god by building an altar by worshiping by communion with him saying lord i believe lord lead me lord guide me he had the opportunity every day in the greatest way to commune with god in simplicity and quietness it wasn't a daily visit to melchizedek daily lunches with elohim it wasn't daily visions and daily dreams a hundred years of his life but yet daily opportunities almost every day to have this experience with god and what is it it's something that god grants to us through the baptism of the holy ghost and access to his word to daily commune with him that's the example of abraham that's the beauty of the life of abraham as at 175 years we just see the peaks and then we could take from that that where we live most often is in the valley of a daily walk with christ and that's what abraham had that allowed him to achieve the peaks now with abraham i feel like my part of my almost all of my burden of abraham delivered i want to close and my my closing statements you know closing arguments sometimes could take days in a trial in my closing i want to express this the thought of supreme faith revealed in sarah and i know that i'm not doing her life justice by just trying to sum it up here in at the end of this series but let's just begin again with genesis chapter 11 verses 29 and 30. and abram and nehor took them wines and the name of abram's wife was sarah we're introduced to abram immediately introduced to his wife the wife of nehor's wife named neher's the daughter of haran the father of milka the father of iska and then this statement so striking in the narrative especially when you read of the other genealogies and the the begettings it says but sarah was barren she had no child there's a harshness to it sarah which means princess immediately followed up with baron which means sterile comes from the root to pluck up to root up to hamstring or to cut and so it signals there's something that's been uprooted in her she is barren she she's not fertile she's not able to bring forth children and this is the glimpse that we have of sarah and the as the narrative unfolds we realize that sarah is traveling then with abram and abram's given a promise he's going to be the father of many nations going to make his name great and so in genesis chapter 12 because of famine abraham goes down into egypt and she's 65 years old at this point in genesis chapter 12. and we read by in the scripture that she was a fair woman she was a beautiful woman and that abram is telling her listen sarah you're a beautiful woman uh you need to lie and say that you're only my sister so that you um they do not kill me in order to have you as wife and so at 65 years old her being um from babylon and from a different region a different country traveling down into egypt there would have been a different uh beauty to her and a different appearance and she would have been fair she was beautiful by nature and then there would have been this attraction even at 65 years old to where she would have been viewed as desirable and pharaoh wanted to have her as a wife and abraham begins to lie and this is really kind of our this is where we see sarah participating in the story but then 25 years later in genesis chapter 20 nearly 25 years later should have been almost 90 years old we know for certain she would have been 89 years old in genesis chapter 20 abraham goes down into gerar and a similar situation happens in genesis chapter 20 verse 2 and abraham said unto sarah his wife said of of sarah his wife she is my sister and abimelech king of gerard sent and took sarah at 65 years old here it is it's happening in in egypt pharaoh wants sarah to be his wife because of her beauty 25 years later king abimelech wants her to be wife it's striking that in genesis chapter 26 the same thing happens with isaac and rebecca just one of these things i guess it ran in the family uh something about this abimelech but it says a bit like kim guerrar wanted to take sarah and i'm just going to say this and i'm not hiding anything because i know you know the truth of it most of you to be taught in these things but there's a beautiful mystery that is silent in this verse yes she's beautiful and she's fair and genesis chapter 12 but 25 years later when she's nine nearly 90 years old there's still this draw on this attraction where the king wants to take her to a wife and there's this paradox many people have recognized that the commentators and different theologians have recognized this paradox of a king wanting to take a 90 year old woman to be a wife there's some that have speculated that when being a king it was all about economics and forging relationships and abraham had possessing many things this would have been a marriage according to economics to participate and benefit in the different possessions that abraham had there's others that uh knowing that king abimelech would have been about 90 years old they say hey he's 90 she's 90 what a perfect match uh or they attribute to the fact that in those days you lived a longer lifespan so 90s really not as old as we may think it is or they just say hey look she's already beautiful and she was if she's beautiful at 65 she's probably beautiful at 90. but this is just mankind trying to resolve the paradox of why a king of 90 years old would want a woman who was 90 years old right they're just looking hey would a nine-year-old man today want to have a nine-year-old woman today and that's they're just wrestling with maybe a paradox and trying to figure out give an explanation to it but there's a mystery that's hidden in this when the king wants sarah and to marry sarah it's not just going to be explained away by oh that's rational and that makes sense and maybe it means something to somebody but if we look into the word of god the bible already sets up to tell us that sarah is aging and in genesis chapter 18 verses 10 to 15 the lord speaking he said i will return i will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life genesis 18 we're going to read 10 to 15 and lo sarah thy wife shall have a son and sarah heard it in the tent door which was behind him and abraham and sarah the bible is telling us and abraham and sarah were old and well stricken in age and it ceased to be with sarah after the manner of women this means that she was unfit for conceptions to cease to be after the manner of women in other words there could be no hope of her having a conceiving a child in a natural way we'd already been told that she was barren but now she'd reached a time in her life to where she's no longer able it ceased to be after the men or women where she's in the cycle she's able to conceive this is long past and the bible's wanting to know that if there ever was a moment or window there was a time when sarah naturally is going to be able to conceive we've moved way past that and god does it for a reason so that nobody say well i guess you know she was young enough she's healthy enough and you finally got lucky and you just finally got the rhythm right and everything worked out great and that's why she's had a baby but no god is moving it way past that when we're told she's barren she's not able to have children now it specifically says it ceased to be with sarah after the manner of women she can no longer have a baby the natural way therefore then it just kind of gets real um direct therefore sarah laughed within herself saying after i am waxed old so the bible says old well stricken in age and i'm waxed old now there's maybe a pretty big pic put down after i'm waxed old shall i have pleasure my lord being old also my lord my husband he's waxed old he's even older than me and i'm wax old and well stricken in age and it ceased to be after the manner of women i've passed this particular time shall i have pleasure we could think of this as adults today and realize that she's indicating that something is even different in her relationship with abram where it's physically impossible as brother branham identifies in different places how could this be when abraham and i haven't had well we haven't been as young people family relationship maybe for 20 years this is brother i'm just dramatizing it quoting sarah well maybe we haven't been as young people family relations relationship for 20 years another place see it certainly as a social affair it had ceased many many years and so they didn't have any family affair you see what's being spoken of in the bible in other words this was not going to happen because it doesn't happen by osmosis it couldn't be a uh it wasn't going to happen physically it ceased to be with sarah she's even acknowledged were we even going to have pleasure this doesn't happen anymore so i want you to recognize how sarah had waxed old as well stricken in age and then the lord even speaks to it the lord said unto abraham verse 13 wherefore why did sarah laugh saying shall i have a surety bear a child which i'm old how can i have a child i'm old and then the lord seemingly acknowledges her assessment of her physical condition and her testimony about her current status of a relationship with abraham says is anything too hard for the lord in other words he didn't object oh no sarah you're young you're beautiful you're healthy you're able he acknowledges yeah you're sick you're decrepit you're waxed old you don't have pleasure anymore but is anything too hard for the lord can we not recognize even for ourselves no matter how bad the symptoms are no matter how bad the condition is no matter how bad our circumstances are it's not a matter of denying the symptoms or denying the circumstances but not denying christ that is greater that's the challenge because the symptoms are right in our face and the devil just rubs our face in it you smell that huh you get that and you're like yep but god's greater that's the challenge it's not saying i don't smell anything i don't see anything no but god's greater and so the lord doesn't necessarily argue with her he just says but is that too hard for the lord at the time appointed i will return unto thee according to the time of life and sarah shall have a son and sarah denied saying i laughed not for she was afraid and he said nay but you did laugh notice what's standing out now about sarah is her doubt she's incredulous about the promise imagine that i don't know if there was any ambiguity to her if she wasn't clear on who was visiting but here the lord is saying i am going to allow sarah to conceive and she's like whatevs that's not going to happen and and then she's so she's incredulous about the promise and then when she's called out and she's i didn't laugh me i didn't laugh you know it was hagar where's hagar hagar right she she wouldn't even she lied about it why because she's afraid doubt and fear are the two things that we can gather from genesis 18 about what's working in sarah but when the lord visited her think about right now in this scripture when the lord visited her she's an old woman bible says she's old waxed old well-stricken in age the lord even acknowledging it i don't even have pleasure with my lord anymore and the lord even acknowledges it by asking is anything too hard for the lord romans 4 19 it said about abraham his own body was dead and about sarah the deadness of sarah's womb the bible coming in the new testament saying abraham's body was dead and sarah's womb was dead this is an old woman this is what we see in genesis chapter 18 but it's within the next year that abraham and sarah go down into guerra the next year genesis 18 and then we see 19 tells us a story a really of lot but then it tells us abraham journey with sarah down in a gerard and it's one year later the king wants to take her as a wife why not because of economics not because the king was looking for someone his age not because she was just well she was just a beautiful woman and she she looked young but something supernatural had happened to her because in genesis chapter 21 remember her womb is dead her body's dead cease to have relationships with her husband and genesis chapter 1 21 verses 1-3 in the lord visited sarah for he had said as he had said and the lord did unto sarah as he had spoken what a beautiful poetry he visited sarah as he had said and the lord did unto sarah as he had spoken lord visit me as you have said do unto me as you have spoken see it's almost exactly what mary says be it unto me according to thy word as you did unto sarah as you had spoken do unto me according to thy word for sarah conceived and bear abraham a son in his old age at the set time which god had spoken to him and abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him whom sarah bare to him i love it just keeps repeating over and over again isaac sarah who was barren from genesis chapter 11 and then well past the physical possibility well past you know the luck of the lottery and just keep trying maybe you'll have your baby it had ceased to be with her she was waxed old she was aged she would have had the appearance of an old woman but she goes from that barrenness to birth to bringing forth the sun at 100 years old or at the age of 90 years old and this is just a very simple statement and i could end on it but i'm not going to end on it but this is the thought i want to amplify for the next few moments that the process sarah's process from baroness to birth is a type of our process from birth to body change her process of being absolutely barren and coming to the place where she's going to bring forth a son at 90 years old is a say is a type of our process of going from the new birth to a body change she shows us and i want you just to grab ahold of this i am closing i just got some statements i want to read to you from the message of the hour for as part of my closing the harder you pull the faster i'll preach but she shows us that we too can go from doubt and fear to bring forth the promise of god and not necessarily taking decades because she goes from genesis 18 89 years old fearing lying doubting laughing to bringing forth the sun and it was something that happened very quickly within her life it was something that transpired to where god is taking this old woman and something takes place in her life that brings it from a place of doubt to manifesting the promise and really as i began to look at the life of sarah over the last several months only just by using this story in genesis 18 and then in genesis 21 almost nothing else is recorded of her before this except when it relates to hagar and what did she do in genesis 16 hey maybe hagar's the one right maybe you could have a son by hagar why don't you have a child by my servant and then what does she immediately do resents it immediately and she changes her mind and she's jealous of it and really all you really see is this contention this conflict relating to hagar and even the son ishmael later on after isaac's born outside of that there's not a lot that's told of us about sarah uh that we would know except that she was beautiful in chapter 12. she uh she suggested hagar in chapter 16. and before this all oh this is the greatest details we have about her now she's old she's well stricken in age she's doubting the promise once again like she did in chapter 16. she's laughing at she's fearful she's lying but think of it the lord visited sarah as he had said and the lord did unto sarah as he had spoken all it took was one day with the lord that was it all it took was a moment and all of sarah's doubted in chapter 16 all of her age in chapter 18 oliver laughing in chapter 18 all of her doubts in chapter 18 all of her fears and lies in chapter 18 all it took was the lord to visit her all it took was for the word to be spoken over her and then nothing could stop the effect of the word upon her the lord did unto sarah as he had spoken as he visited her as he had said it was the word that brought her to a change and the unconditional covenant that god made with his people he says we know that god had to do something speaking of sarah to the womb of sarah didn't he she had been barren all these years nearly 100 years old and was barren now remember the process of sarah going from barrenness to the birth of isaac is a type of the process of us going from faith to body change i'm preaching about the supreme faith revealed in abraham supreme faith revealed in sarah and he says well in order it's a mixed audience but you listen to your doctor i'm your brother in order to do something to make this he had to recreate something in that woman's womb to make it fertile is that right in order to do it he had to stimulate her heart because she couldn't go into labor like that a woman almost 100 100 years old is that right couldn't do it and another thing what about the milk veins god doesn't and god doesn't he says god doesn't patch up anything but let me say he's wanting us to think about this a 90 year old woman having a baby wax old well stricken in age cease to be as it was at the met of men or women no longer having pleasure with her lord all these things are true of sarah and saying if she's going to have a baby i want you to notice that she's going to have a baby at 90. god has a process god has a way and and to us we'd say oh he's still god he can take an old weak a woman who can't have a baby and just let her have a baby right just imagine a nine-year-old woman having a baby but god's way is different than our way he says i'm going to do something i'm going to make her able so listen there's a process and i had a lot of things maybe there'll be a part 17. there was a lot of notes i wanted to share with you on the process god has a process god has a process god has a process in yielding to that process there's a way that god wants to take us to a body change we can't just sit cross-legged and hum long enough to get rapture in faith you've got to go through the process there's got to be faith and the experiencing the working out of that faith and god has to take us through the process so god just didn't take an eight a 90 year old woman then one day she's like oh i feel funny i think i'm having a baby no he took her through a process because god is looking at he had to make a womb that was fertile he had to give her a heart that could last through labor he had to give her the ability to nurse that baby god doesn't patch up anything he made sarah a new woman he made her a young beautiful woman again and he made abraham a young man again he turned them back to show what he's going to do in the rapture to us oh in the beautiful the beginning of christianity he expresses the end and the goal of christianity eternity newness of life even a new body in the beginning he's already showing the end and feast of the trumpets he says notice what happened immediately she turned back to a lovely young woman showing in there portraying what he's going to do to the royal seat of abraham to receive the son that's been promised there's a lot with the order here that i'm wanting you to catch that your change is going to become before the meeting you're not going to meet him in the air and change you're going to change before you meet him in the air it's important that you recognize that because if you're thinking the image of a 900-foot jesus is going to stimulate rapturing faith to put you in a new body you're going to miss it or you're missing it you've got to recognize the christ who is present with you now wanting to take you under his wing and mentor you into a new body she turned back young they went down into garage what happened abimelech the king fell in love with her said she's fair and beautiful and was going to marry her is that right old grandma and all them other pretty girls down there granny she's beautiful she's fair to look upon god changed her body and turned them back notice how he places it it's a mystery that's to be revealed now in this day by the son of man the evening message turn back this is the mystery in genesis 20 where it says that the king wanted to take her to be a wife what's silent there is it's not economics it's not politics it's not that she was it's not the the the physical popularity what she would have been as a 90-year-old woman she just lived a good clean life never did drugs and i never wore makeup and her skin was perfect and she used cold water every morning splash cold water in her face she never got a wrinkle because she knew just use the coldest water and you'll never get a wrinkle she had good genetics none of that was the case it was a mystery that god had turned sarah back to a young woman again and even abraham he says turn him back and that's the last sign they seen was that discernment the last thing that we see in the scripture is genesis 18 before the change of the body comes and before we can ever receive the sun what happens before we can ever receive the sun it's like this meeting in the air the trump of god shall sound the dead in christ shall rise first a new body and we which are alive and remain shall be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye and shall be caught up together to meet the lord in the air this statement to me is so beautiful the secret has been made known the seals are open i know that sounds maybe mysterious and oh what does that even relate to it's very simple it's very practical it's the fact the bride has all she needs to overcome to prevail to rise above omicron to rival rise above everything that would come against her to rise above anything that would try to weaken your faith not that we don't get sick not that we don't lose jobs not that we don't have financial pressure but we have what we need available to us to learn to trust and demonstrate trust we have god has not holding anything back to us the secret has been made known this is a beautiful statement here in question and answers part three someone asked brother brandon the question please explain the mystery of the translation of the bride it's like you know this is when you need brother wes you know court reporter write it all down we don't want to miss a word right get your pins out just to change yeah just to change like they said brother dalton shared with me a story one time he'd ask to brother branham uh what can we do to be more spiritual and the way he kind of shared the story with me it's kind of like everybody's weighted with baited breath like right get this down don't miss this everybody be quiet listen he said are you ready what can we do to be more spiritual pray pray read your bible every day no seriously what can i do to be more spiritual pray pray read your bible every day that that's the simplicity of it so here's the question please explain the mystery the translation of the bride just to change he says our bodies now he says let's say our and then he says you know what i mean when i say that i don't mean to be sacrilegious i don't mean to say ours i don't mean to say this church i mean to say every believer abraham so now he's going to get into this he was looking for a promised son that was promised him and the church is looking for a promised son the bride is looking for the prominent son before the promised son could come to sarah and abraham their bodies had to be changed she was too old to have a baby she had no milk veins in her breast her breasts were dried up her womb wasn't fertile she was sterile she could not have the baby her heart was too old to stand labor so what happened god changed her back to a young woman and he did this abraham the same thing because he said his body was as good as dead and he had to change their body in order to receive the promised son and we cannot re receive the promised son that's promised us today in these bodies that we live in these bodies are sin and this is what i and i want to share this if the musicians would come i i just have another statement i'll read before we stand in prayer that this if you could take now everything that we've expressed in the life of abraham when it comes to this point the translation it this is going to be achieved what did sarah do she had to believe god she had to be have a promise she was elected to it she was ordained to it despite her doubting despite her laughing despite her line god had made her a promise and he was going to bring the promise to her and she just had to be in position to receive it and to accept it and there she stayed faithful to her husband there she walked by his side abraham himself stayed faithful to the promise despite his doubtings and his journey as it's all a walk of faith and then one day please explain the translation the mystery of the translation of the bride it is going to be a change of the body just like it was in abraham and sarah then i know that what i must do is believe god and walk with him and that what we need for that is here that we're not waiting on another visitation because if that's what's needed to receive the promised son that's what's needed to see him than i have already at work within me now what's needed for the change the word is here to give us rapturing faith my last statement in the message the faith of abraham he says god turned sarah and abraham back to a young man and a young woman again he will do all the seed of abraham the same way turned them back young again when they come from the dust of the earth not all great headed and broke down but young in the very splendor of health always will be that way forever and ever never to blemish sin will be done away with there'll be no serpent in that garden of eden he will be done away with forever it'll all be renewed again god's great purpose and he cannot be defeated because he's god this is what we're living for this is what we're believing in that there is a life beyond this one that there is an eternity awaiting us and that the supreme faith revealed in abraham speaks of the faith that we have in this end time and i say just trust him with everything that is in you believe in the miracle of his word in your life and in your heart and daily daily yield to him that you too could be like sarah and just watch yourself walk right into a new body to receive the promised son remember her process of going from barrenness to birth we can see ourselves going from faith to rapturing faith could we stand today [Music] let's pray together [Music] our gracious heavenly father it's inspiring to read a book that we know you wrote [Music] and the list of critics that have said disparaging things about this book will never end [Music] until the day that all natural life is vanquished because it's questioned it's doubted it's assailed it's picked at it's even people who claim to believe it tear its pages out and deny parts of it but it's so refreshing to be a christian that believes this book is true and not through dissonance or just you know overcoming doubt but to have a real anchored faith deep within our hearts this is the word of god and that's why we could read the story about a 75 year old man who begins to travel down into a land he'd never been before with his wife believing in his heart that one day he'd be the father of many nations that's why we can believe and be encouraged by his journeys and his pathways what he went through and what he experienced even to 115 years old when he offered up that son isaac upon an altar we believe it's true lord and we believe that you preserved this story of abraham that it might not necessarily not create a faith in us in abraham but create a greater faith in us for you and a longing for you my prayer would be today as we close this service and also this series that there'd be a greater love and thirst for jesus christ and not for religion and not for churchianity and not just and some sort of ism or an organizational life but a true thirst for you in light of the promise that you've given for abraham and sarah no matter how many acres of cattle they had or land they had or how many head of cattle they had no matter how many servants no matter how rich you made abraham none of that is emphasized and given preeminence in their lives though it's referenced that's not what they sought after that's not what becomes the focal point of the story the focal point of the story is the promise you made them to have a son and lord may we have a craven and a desire in our hearts not to be good church members and not just to play the part and not just to be able to say oh look at me i'm blessed i'm getting promotion i'm getting this i'm getting that i i'm doing good but to truly thirst for your word as it relates to the promise and i believe that you want to do extraordinary things with us as we see a year coming to the close to think lord that we're soon entering another year it just seems like they go by so fast this is a time where humanity stops and looks back and and maybe turns a new page and looks forward to resolutions and a new beginning a new start lord may we become more inspired than ever to be genuine christians that display the love of christ to others that it can humble themselves when they're wrong that can be willing to risk rejection lord when it when it calls for standing for truth but i was inspired by my friend brother stephen sharing with me how fearless he's become with the message to share it regardless of the consequences i pray that we likewise as a church would not be ashamed of this gospel knowing that we have something to offer lord we can preach grace we can preach safety we can preach uh loving kindness and forgiveness but we must demonstrate it ourselves lord may we not merely be those that speak of it but may we be those that live it and my prayer is that we would continue in this process from faith to perfect faith by your grace may we experience daily acts of faith get into the routine of trusting you and believe in you and watching your word be fulfilled i commit us to you now lord as we always do asking that you take control of us use us for your glory in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen
