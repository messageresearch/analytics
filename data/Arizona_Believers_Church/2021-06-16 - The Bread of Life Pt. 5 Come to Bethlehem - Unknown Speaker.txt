TRANSCRIPT
========================================
ruth chapter one i'm gonna just read verse two ruth chapter one verse two since we've all been together in these services i feel i can just jump right in where we were um and the last time it says and the name of the man was elimelech this is the man who him and his family journeyed into moab and the name of his wife was naomi in the name of his two sons mahan and kilian efferties of bethlehem judah and the part we're focusing on now and they came into the country of moab and continued there if we could bow our heads gracious heavenly father lord we're appreciative of your presence that is with us this evening uh just a tremendous atmosphere lord and it's one that i do not believe is synthetic it's not one that we try to work up it's not the product of you know a band practicing and everything being synchronized to produce just the right emotional response but lord there's a peace in our hearts there's a joy that we have in our hearts there's an expectation that we've brought with us and lord we we look upon the facilities that have been extended to us and we're grateful for them and we realize that there's a privilege we have and be able to be together with this type of closeness even thinking last year where meetings were banned and these number of people could not be together and all the restrictions that would have been placed on us but we're certainly grateful but yet lord we realize that it's not the facility that makes the church it's the kingdom delegates that have gathered together therefore lord i believe as much as we are rejoicing and feel an excitement in our spirits tonight i believe that heaven is eve under even more anticipation when they see the group like this come together in love for your word and with such an anticipation to hear from you so i believe in a supernatural realm there is a positive frenzy and there is a rush of excitement lord and may we just lean into that and accept it and and allow you to have your way in this service bless your people we pray in the name of lord jesus christ amen you can be seated it's going to pick right up where we were last time looking at this phrase at the end of verse 2 it says and they came into the country of moab and continued there just a few things at the outset by way of kind of review and picking up a few things i want to maybe place it in this way they left god's provided way god had a place provided for israel it was the promised land and so they ought to have remained there regardless of how difficult things were in that land if they were in a place where they were contrary to the god's word if they were in a in a place that god had not promised them if there had been markers and significations and signs that this was contrary to god's word then we could see that taking his step in moving would have been justified according to the word would have been what the holy spirit was leading but we look at a number of different factors in elimelech's move and we see that he forsook god's promised word for his day and i know when we put it in that context that they had forsaken god's provided way he abandoned god's promise word for that day that those are phrases that we can use to challenge ourselves and and terms that are very familiar to us within the message and so elimelech's move from bethlehem judah into moab was an act of rebellion it was not a man exercising wisdom and doing that which was best for his family and it was prudent and something that god was leading him to do but it was actually disobedience a continued disobedience against god's word in a day when the judges ruled in a time when every man did that which was right in his own sight he leaves bethlehem judah and will find that when naomi returns later that there's a lot of people says oh here's naomi she's coming back and so we realized that they that there was many who stayed and maybe we could say a lot of people who stayed because it was kind of significant to them that oh here's a limoulex wife that's returning back and it was something that everyone noticed so elimelech may have been one of very few and this is the only one that is recorded and that we know of that left bethlehem judah during this time of famine and went into moab and what elimelech ought to have done is repented he himself ought to have called upon the name of the lord and ought to uh relented of his rebellion and ought to have yielded to the the spirit of god and said lord we're sorry we avail ourselves to you and we repent of our wicked ways and we realize that famine would only be the result of us leaving the path that we ought to have been in so god we pray that you would lift this famine and this curse drive away our enemies who are taking these things away from us and our oppressors and and what he ought to have done is repented but instead in an act of rebellion he goes into moab and so they come the scriptures and they came into the country of they went into moab and last time we were looking at how that moab is i was the son of lot and lot means covering and how this was a son of covering and we just looked at how that this was a religious covering and we could we're going to look at that in more detail tonight maybe not focusing on this aspect of religion being a covering but you'll be able to see how this dovetails together without the emphasis but i want to say this choosing moab represents something to us as bride the scripture doesn't just say that a family left bethlehem judah and went into a foreign country whereas when jesus gives the parable of the what we call the prodigal son it says that he went and joined himself with as a citizen of a foreign country it doesn't tell us exactly what it was uh because maybe that it wasn't necessary to understand the point or the mystery behind the parable that jesus was using but here in told this telling the story of elimelech leaving bethlehem judy tells us exactly where he went and i believe it's because it represents something to us this type of moab is part of the hidden mystery and ruth because this is just a very simple way to look at this and kind of maybe get our attention and bring us to be spellbound it's what ruth was called out of and when we look at it that way it starts thinking all right let's think about this because ruth didn't leave bethlehem judah and go into moab but ruth was in moab that's where she was and so we see these chain of events we haven't even seen ruth's name yet in these services and just looking at verses one and two it's not until you get to verse four that you actually have ruth that's introduced and i know that's very quickly within the framework of the story as it's written but yet this is a number of years from the moment that elimelech leaves it doesn't just start and say where there's a woman in the moab named ruth and and she went to bethlehem judah during a time of great harvest it wants us to understand this background and so ruth chapter one is the background of ruth's story these first few verses are the background not it's not really a limoulek story so much it's not the two sun story it's the background for week so that we can understand ruth and we can understand her and understand her redemption and her restoration and ruth being a book of redemption the very lines of redemption are drawn in this story this is background of this story of redemption we see boaz as a type of christ and and we recognize that we believe that boaz are the type of christ we recognize that ruth is a type of the bride and then recognizing and as we'll see further see in boaz as a type of christ there's a lot of instances that boaz is mentioned in this story and you can see a reflection of christ in the actions of boaz and so we could do the same thing and looking at ruth and see that ruth we could we can learn something by looking at the country of moab because that's what ruth who is the type of the bride is brought out of and we say then this must be there must be some connection as to how the living bread of life is the shout bringing forth the bride and of ruth being a type of the bride we can see how the liv what the living bread of life is bringing us out of today what the word we're hearing is continually washing us of and even if i could say it this way we can begin to identify how how particular and specific the message is to meet the needs that we have in our lives because we ought to believe that the word has the answer i really believe that we could say we've got the answer what's the question right we can say that we've got the answer now what's the question and i do believe the question is relevant but we have the answer by god's grace we have it and we so we could see look into the message and just have this faith to believe the word of god addresses our needs and so we can see some of these types coming out in in this story now we mentioned last time we'll be maybe a little bit more uh we're going to use some summary language but and if it seems to be maybe a little bit uh um offensive it's just it's just the plain truth of the scripture and as we've been reading through the old testament together as a family there's parts where you just kind of pause and you figure out how how can i say this you know you know you don't really you wish they kind of had a a different version of the bible to be able to read it but the bible the old testament is full of a lot of stories that make us blush a lot of stories that it's maybe very difficult to explain to our children but we know that the moabites were descendants of law through an act of incest and so a lot's daughter has a son with lot and his name is moab now go that's that's the point at which we can go back to says ruth was a moabitess she claims she's when she refers to herself as ruth the moabitess elimelech and his family go into moab so we know ruth is going to come from there but we're going back and asking ourselves what is moab to begin with what kind of beginnings did moab have and you find didn't have a very good beginning didn't have a very good foundation and but this is what ruth is called out of this is the foundation of what she's called out of and brother branham makes this statement and does god change his mind and you'll find he preaches this one in jeffersonville on april 18 1965 and then i believe he preaches it on april 27th um later on in los angeles of that same year and in each one of these he deals tremendous gives a lot of attention to moab and and these different instances that we're mentioning tonight but it says moab to begin with was an illegitimate nation it started out illegitimate yet by a father believer and a daughter believer i mean you could just sit there for a while and start scratching your head think about how close this starts to bring this and he said the beginning the way that this child was produced though it was a believing father and a believing daughter he says it was illegitimate to begin with just exactly if you will type that and use a spiritual mind you can see that denomination standing there just as plain as anything so he's saying though you might have had what would seem to be the right elements there's a way that it produced it produced something that was illegitimate produce something that was against what god's order would have been it had the wrong kind of foundation it had the wrong kind of beginning and it's important to look at how something starts it's important to look at the beginning of something because that's gonna it's gonna kind of establish its direction and it's gonna give it some momentum if something starts off wrong give it time it begins to deviate further and further and further and for those who've already kind of started with it if they don't realize the wrong foundation they feel that they're building correctly feel completely justified in the direction it's going but he says the whole thing is all together wrong and look when it's brought started like that it keeps like a ball of snow it just keeps rolling more and more and more so it's the snowball effect he says you get one error start on that one error and you just keep rolling one thing after another one thing like another all after another so this is this is what we're looking at in the nature and the characteristics of moab that are important for us to consider that moab began illegitimately moab even as a nation has a the wrong kind of foundation and he says you can see denomination standing there just as plain as anything so let's look at moab now as denomination and so moab represents and i've been studying a lot of different places where brotherhood says this so i i can use a little bit of and today i'm just going to use these statements from the message to substantiate this but i want to say this that i can use a lot of summary language and if you say well where did you get that from there and and how could you say that i i can show you the quotes of brother branham and the statements he made to substantiate it and so just for sake of time i want to use some things that are kind of summary he already says here that you can see moab as a denomination standing there just as plain as anything and this is not a history lesson this is applicable to the time that we're living in now so moab represents a denominational spirit a moab represents a denominational condition and and i want to use this as a way of uh uh representing what a denomination is it's a man-made system that keeps an individual from god that's my definition and i think it's it's informed by the many the thousands of things that we could see in the word of god that it's a man it's something man-made that's going to keep the individual away from god so when we use the phrase denomination it's important and i'm sure those of you who are here this evening i would you could just nod in agreement say yep we understand that we perfectly understand that but maybe it just bears being reminded that when we think denomination don't think strictly about a legal structure that what denomination are you a part of and you think oh well we're southern baptist or we're of this convention and we're of this organization we're upc or we're assembly of god or we're we're uh we're it's more than that it's more than a legal structure it's more than some sort of formal recognition or a hierarchy but denomination can be much broader more general and more elusive than that we could all say right now and feel fairly confident that we are not part of any denomination but that may just speak to the fact that this church does not have any particular affiliation with an established legally organized informed denominational group a recognizable organization and in that way we can say well we're not a denomination but it's important to recognize that you can become a denominational or be a denomination and still call yourself independent uh not to offend our neighbors next door in the apartment but just look at the independent baptist you'll find this independent just means they're independent of this organization within the baptist hierarchy but they themselves are still yet an organization and so even with the churches becoming loosely affiliated they begin to operate just like an organization can be so denominationalism can be very very subtle and when we look at moab and we see that brother brahma says with the spiritual mind you can see that denomination standing there just as plain as anything it's important to realize that denominationalism can just be a mindset it doesn't have to be a dot org or an ink it doesn't have to have a headquarters it can just be a mindset you can have a denominational approach i let i'll just be very frank you could be sitting in a church that is absolutely not a denomination in a church that does not have a denominational spirit a church that is not subject to a headquarters answering to some denominational hierarchy and being told what to do and you yourself have a denominational mindset you you just kind of have this this mindset you approach things just like a denomination with so denominationalism can just be an attitude i said that we just kind of enter into that and it's just a system that can be developed where this is the way things are done and this is the way we think and this is the way we operate this is how i think this is the way i think things should be done and so there could be a denominational spirit denominational attitude denominational approach and it can be on a on a collection of churches even a collection of individuals that go to a church or even just one person or a small clique within a church be very very denominational and so ruth is being called out of moab she's been called out of this and brought into a promise and by seeing ruth called out of moab and being brought into a promise it's a warning to us it speaks something to us as individuals that ruth is being called out of this denominationalism she's called out of it into the promised word into a particular field it should be a warning to us because there is no quote-unquote i'm using a lowercase m and i'm using air quotes for those who are just streaming the podcast there's actually no podcast yet uh that's there's no message immunity to not denominationalism when we are taught that the message will not denominate we ought to realize that brother branham and making that statement was referring very specifically to the word that was brought and that that word would never organize and that that word would never formalize but that word would continue on until a rapture and when this message would be undenominated and it would not denominate he's saying that there will never be a need for another prophet raise up there'll never need to be another eighth messenger another messenger another prophet another move of god to break out those who were walking in truth out of a denominational structure but this is this is the message that'll lead to a rapture he says it will not denominate in others it won't stop it won't die but that doesn't mean others won't stop doesn't mean people won't die in their own organizations and organize around the message and make it something it's not so denominationalism can be alive and well even among people or in someone's life who fully with all their heart believes the message a father believer father daughter producing an organizational denominational mindset it can happen and so we want to be very sensitive to that so that we don't do that we have an opportunity as a church that's just begun in our beginning to make sure that we begin right and that it just doesn't snowball and then we find years later man aren't we aren't we strong and aren't we great and don't we got the numbers and hasn't this been awesome but yet somehow somewhere in the beginning it starts off wrong and we just we're just patting each other on the back so excited we're having our 15-year anniversary services and i can't believe it we had to we had to rent the bank one ballpark or whatever it's called now we had to run a baseball field we had to run the convention so we had to kick the suns out to have the convention because we're so big and so many people are attending and just patting ourselves on the back but god looks at just a snowball of heirs and it can get bigger and bigger and it looks really really good it has a lot of momentum but it's headed the wrong direction but the man says this and does god change his mind we just read in paragraph 99 this is paragraph 102. now lots group here moab was lot's daughter's child illegitimate to start with so he's making this point now notice as the natural church moab represents the natural denomination so there is a church carnal there's a natural church there's a church denomination israel represents the spiritual church now remember that what we're doing today relates more to natural church right because we're in a natural building we have we have a name that we've given ourselves and these different things let's let's not just think that any that there's a there's an always a natural element to this this kind of gathering all right is that i mean is that a strange concept to everyone amazing in the world are you thinking we've always thought that we something we've left our bodies at home and we're kind of hearing our theophanies our theophanies are waiting in our car just you know when when i get back to my tesla my body will just kind of unite back with my theophany oh this is not a gathering of theophanies this is people with backaches and people who are tired and people who who don't like the sound of my voice after 45 minutes and we're all natural here and when you start a church and you organize something you have not all there's a lot of natural things that pertain to church so let's just realize there is there are natural things that relate to church but in the midst of all that there's people who are part of a spiritual church and there's no one church that can claim to be the spiritual church it's important to ponder these things so moab represents the natural denomination israel represents the spiritual church israel was the true the church true it was the bride of that day called out of egypt and vindicated to be the truth so when we see moab it's distinct from israel which would represent the bride and and the bride that was called out of egypt and vindicated to have the truth so bride is represented in israel moab and really what we're focusing on now is how moab represents a natural state a natural condition a natural organization it represents natural denomination remember and i believe we might have gone over this at some point i can't remember in what exact subject area we're looking at but i just recall there were some statements we were looking at and recognizing it's important to realize that a denomination as brother branham refers to it or the church natural is a group movement when brother bam talks about denominations he talks about the church it's a it's a group thing he's identifying singling out a group he's talking about a movement he's talking about something that has some sort of identification but when we talk about the bride that relates to an individual that there's there's a there's a message that can be broadcast and given to the church even the fallen church the brotherhood says that the laodicea and these different churches the natural church the false church claims to be the true church so god speaks to them as the church and he addresses them as a group but when god wants to deal with your heart he will not deal with you in in as a group he deals with you as an individual and so if we all want to be lutherans we could just become a lutheran church and therefore we are lutherans by the fact that we identify with an organization with a system of beliefs and a way of living and a way of approaching things and then whenever our convention makes a decision we say oh well this is what we believe now and this is how we'll identify and it becomes a group move this is how even jehovah witnessed in different ones they have this evolution of their theology and their beliefs over many many different decades and years and they all just accept it and continue on with it because it's a group thing but when god wants to make someone a part of the bride it's not well here's a group there and there's a group there it's here's my word you receive it into your heart and you're baptized into a body and it's not a group movement it's an individual thing it wasn't a group move when ruth came out of moab as you continue to read and we get into this in more detail you'll find just how striking it is so in type bib is saying that moab is the natural church so it represents a carnal religion and and we'll see how brother ram is saying it represents political religion and and this has the dovetail in kind of the uh the the tie-in to what we ministered on sunday on our the conscience and a clear conscience and we were looking at how the world today has had their conscience seared but it doesn't mean they've all they they become emotionless and they become dead they're passionate they're excited they're motivated they stand for things they push for things they rally for things and they have a lot of passion and they're conscious but they lack a spiritual conscience they lack the morality they lack in integrity and so and and so religion has become uh politics has become a religion science has become a religion you don't think science is a religion watch how dogmatic they can be when anyone has a contrary opinion they behave just like organized religion they behave just like the religious zealots they have the same kind of ideology the same kind of mindset the same kind of activities and they behave much the same way that you could say these uh religious zealots act very interesting to ponder that and think about it but moab represents a carnal religion and even a religious politics lot was the nephew of abraham the brother man pointing that out a number of different places points it out to identify that there was kinship then with moab and abraham's family there there would be a relationship here there would be some sort of kinship to him and we'll find in these statements we're reading tonight moab they the moabites were not heathens they there was something in their genesis and in their beginning remember our brother-in-law says if it starts off wrong where it ends up but in their beginning they were not heathens and i want i want you to ponder it this way they're so close to the truth even the historians suggest that the moabites and the israelites probably understood one another's language because they were so closely related this is an outstanding statement here that brother madam writes this in the church book chapter 5 page 202 paragraph 1 he says you remember who moab was he was the son of lot by one of his own daughters lot in turn was a nephew of abraham so israel and moab were related i want you to see that and so when we think about moab there's some sort of kinship in relationship to abraham and this statement here is so powerful the moabites knew the truth whether they lived up to it or not this is this is the condition of being a moabite you can know the truth claim to have relationship to the truth be able to maybe describe and outline and diagram and give pay homage to the truth whether you live it or not that'd be a horrible condition to be in and he says this about the moabites they knew the truth whether it was exhibited in their conduct or their lifestyle they were so close to it where they knew what it was and so this is the moabites very very close they know the truth even if they're not living up to it again and does god change his mind at paragraph 70 and israel of the old testament is a type of the bride of the new testament coming up out of the world marching on to the road to canaan or the canaan that we go to the millennium now i'd like to pick up on this particular thought next wednesday so if the musicians would come everybody can everyone also gets this burst of adrenaline like yes it's happening we're out before 8 o'clock but next wednesday i'd like to pick up on this this uh journey of israel and he says now is israel and how moab and i'll say just say here israel comes up to moab before they as their closest point before they enter the promised land so ponder this just think about it if brother ramy uses the millennium as our type here in being the bride coming out guess what the last land you've got to get out of before you can go into millennium is moab we've got to get out of a message moabite condition got to get out of a moabite mindset in order to cross over into the promised land so he says now verse 7 paragraph 71 now we notice moab here is the type of the church so you have the bride moab is the type of the church come out of her my people you see now that there's a church is the one type of entity you all are very taught very very well in that there's a church but the bride is called out of the church and so when he says church spiritual that relates to the bride but then you still have the church natural israel had just slew some kings and had routed the enemy killed off everything possessed the land and moved up by moab this is in the this is in the progress this is in the journey moab was by no means a heathen nation moab was a nation that served the same god that israel served we think moabites there's nothing they say there's a moabitess god and there was mobile midas religion this is something he says they serve the same god that israel served as we'll find as we amplify this further perhaps next week or the following week that whenever israel comes up to moab and balak is like whoa wait a minute what's going on here it says and god said to balaam and it's not strange and balaam's not like who are you the rock's not speaking to me who are you he knew he was think of this affinity this closeness this connection how close moab would be now skip to paragraph 74 moab here is a type of such because they were an organized nation in their own land like in their denomination and there they had their own religions and their own religion was the same religion that israel had somebody at some point just go whoa wow that's the problem with preaching to people who are well taught you're not going to surprise him with anything like i'm like wow like yeah brother and we were we were reading that in the 80s ponder this now now as it relate to us they were organized nation organized like a denomination they had their own religion and the religion was the same religion israel had they were moabites and believed in jehovah god but they were an organized group of people so start to think about if they had if they they knew the truth they were not a heathen nation they served the same god that israel served they believed in jehovah god but then he says but they were or an organized group of people what is it that became their restriction what is it that's keeping them from being the people of god what is it that's keeping them from actually serving god fully and being the same as israel and now as they represent the natural church israel represents the spiritual church in its journey the spiritual church never settles down the spiritual church the spiritual bride member never arrives at an address and says this is it this is the message mecca we've arrived now we're just biding time until brother branham comes back or until the rapture happens but we've made it to mecca here we are we've arrived and this is the culmination of all god dealing with me and the message of the hour this is the culmination of the books this is the culmination of the tapes this is the culmination of my spiritual journey i've made it to the perfect message church and now that i'm here and we're organized we've got church order we've got structure we've got everything together now i'm here no you miss it you become a message moabite because the bride member is always in a journey and you could be born in the same church raised in the same church marry in a church raise your children in a church and you can see your children married often that church begin to have grandchildren at church and never leave that church and that's perfectly okay and and i would say preferred but that you never stop you are in a spiritual journey and by god's grace we can all look back and look at where we've been in our lives and say that i never stopped when i went to that church i never stopped when i was fellowshipping with that church because i was always in a spiritual journey praise the lord the spiritual church in its journey now israel was not an organized nation still reading the same place they were not an organized nation as long as they followed god they were independent elimelech my god my king abandons israel and go wisdom goes into moab foreshadowing what that israel one day would want to be like moab that israel one day would reject god and become organized as a nation under a king would then institute structure and order and conscript armies and do all sorts of things why this is because as long as they followed god they were independent this is to the individual we cannot hide behind church order for our salvation we cannot hide behind this structure we cannot hide behind the natural things we cannot hide behind the fact and think to ourselves that well and listen i'll say it this way and hopefully remember to come back to it we cannot hide behind the church structure seeing that as all as far as long as these components are in place everything's okay and i'm okay you are in a spiritual journey and what you want from church and what you want from hearing the word of god is something that is energizing you in motivating you and facilitating your maturing and your progress in that spiritual journey and that's independent of how a church as a collective is progressing because let's not fool ourselves just because we get a building doesn't mean we've matured as a church and just because we get a facility that we can call our own and brother john doesn't have to come here two hours early and start setting up and brother mitch doesn't have to be here early and brothers don't have to stay late to territory let's not pat ourselves on the back and say we've arrived if we stay in here 10 years but we're maturing and growing and seeing the soul saved and the spirit of god moving in our midst we're on our spiritual journey and if we never find a permanent dwelling here we can say thank god as long as we take that step as individuals into a body change job well done purpose satisfied we do not exist to try to settle down and organize and figure out all the natural elements as long as god is meeting the spiritual needs we'll rejoice in that i believe god's going to give us a permanent facility but more than that i just love to see as we're seeing the progress in the spiritual journey of the kingdom delegates are you progressing spiritually are you growing in the word of god let's just focus on that the building will take care of itself as souls are saved and people are healed and people are energized by the word of god god will provide the natural things in their time let's just seek his kingdom in this spiritual journey he'll add all the natural things that we need so we don't hide behind church order it's the individual that is part of the spiritual church i would like to believe that arizona chur believers church is a spiritual church but we're not the spiritual church we are uh we are kingdom delegates that have gathered together and fellowship together and bringing together church order and growing and how things being set into place and we'll watch how the deacons are ordained and trustees take their offices and different things will begin to come together and those parts will take their place and we'll see those things happening and in that way we are a collection of individuals who are following god and the own leadership the holy spirit who are our desires to see god move and we take individual responsibility of that and not just thinking well if we could just find the place the church one of the lessons i've been pondering in this whole story of elimelech and it just hasn't seemed um to find its place but i guess this is just where it hits the grass is always greener in the church that we stream right man i could just move there if i could just move there every problem solved right or is that nervous laughter like no we've never thought that i know i was taught my neighbor in the apartment next door and they mentioned they wanted to move you know to lima because that's where all the bride's gonna end up or johnson city i mean i know they mentioned it but i mean me no it always looks better in the production it's always better when you just stream a service did you hear this person got healed did you see their worship sir did you see this did you hear this it always seems greener eliminate left where he was supposed to be and went where he thought there would be greener it's pastures alerts the attraction of trying to be a part of something big and great and and nice and attractive and has all these different things and things that we can enjoy and we kind of take comfort him well i know i'm not where i need to be but sister so-and-so got healed and i don't really feel that i'm really have the kind of faith that i need and i don't know if i'm foolish virgin or the bride but man this church really is dynamic isn't it man this guy can really preach and really and the gifts are working and the worship service is awesome and man have you heard that choir lately and you kind of feel better about it all right no no what's most important is that you as an individual are finding peace with god that you're finding peace with god that you're led of god that you're you're auditing yourself on a regular basis and saying it it's it's it's wonderful to have a church that has these different things it's wonderful to experience church services like that but at the end of the day god it's got to be moving my heart and changing me and making a difference for me so now brother branham when he takes the same thought and does god change his mind in los angeles a couple weeks later he says so now to outline this we know that balaam was a prophet and balak was the king of moab at the time and i'd like to get into the these specifics but we're just kind of backgrounding moab and this is wonderful way of just kind of getting these elements out there he says and they were not infidels up at moab they served the same god that israel served because moab the nation was founded by a lot son by his daughter and so they serve the same god if you notice their sacrifices and everything we're just exactly the same bullocks and also rams speaking of the second coming talks about in different places i believe i have it here this evening seven altars and seven rams and everything was perfectly sevens all these things everything was just perfectly typed all these the the numerology and all this elements everything that you would need he says and now if fundamentalism so what he's identifying is in serving the same god having the appropriate sacrifices having the right language the right numerology the right doctrines the right theology the right works and everything in place that's fundamentalism he says if fundamentalism is all that god requires then moab was just as fundamental in his offering as what israel was are you pondering this considering this we're not looking at this historically to try to figure out well what made moab different from israel what am i going to be facing today as an individual what is what is going to be the hold on me am i going to get caught in fundamentalism and being fundamental find my safety and fundamentalism but i fail in the spiritual journey and i'm not growing because i become fundamental and i miss the connection with the dynamics that are necessary in order to be maturing as a christian but we find them now israel oh so beautiful is in the line of following the word of god to that land that had been promised to them so the attraction of moab is to settle down in some sort of fundamentalism some sort of organization some kind of structure and then to get complacent and relaxed within this mindset this denominationalism but the true spiritual church is in the line of following the word of god to the land that is promised to them remember how our whole inspiration in starting this series on being hungry is that the rapture is on and the living bread of life that is going to translate our bodies is available to every bride member and so here we see the very lines of redemption and the story of ruth and there's a hidden revelation that when you catch it it can bring you close to god and what we're seeing is that we've got to break out of a moabite mindset follow the line of god's word to the land that's promised to us here would be a type of the natural and spiritual meeting and now this is this is powerful the way that he says this so extraordinary and i i just want i hope that it just impacts you as we hear this here would be a type of the natural and spiritual meeting and when the natural and spiritual meets there's always a collision because they run right head on into each other this is the conflict this is the resistance this is the pressure a moabite pressure to to fight against and to stop the believer's momentum i'm going to a land that's promised to me and now you come up against a moab and he says it's a natural church that now fights against the spiritual and when the natural and spiritual meets there's always a collision because they run right head on into each other some of us just may have a little bit of a concussion from the collision but shake the cobwebs let the butterflies go the whirly birds running around your head shake them off get it together hold yourself together there was a collision but now you know what the collision was now you know why there was a collision now you know why there was a conflict because you are the spiritual church on your way to the promised land and you just had to run head-on into moabite in order to make it there you have the collision because you're the spiritual church he says in israel here would i want to represent as a spiritual church and moab is the natural church just the church what we call church natural just a natural church that can be just as fundamental and perfect in the doctrine and church order of the message natural church and we're all sure that there is a church and there's a bride coming out of that church he says we know that that that is true and they clash here there's a clash and we notice that when they clashed here it come under something that i would like to speak a moment on as soon as they clashed and one seen what the other one was doing there was a great impersonation one of the other this is the nature of moab instead of changing from natural to spiritual and giving the momentum of the move of god into the promised land they just impersonate what god's doing and this is the time when i would like you to stop thinking about the church your neighbor in the apartment next door goes to and think about your own individual conflicts and your collision and this you're you're gonna have to confront this mobile mindset in your own life and so when there's a collision and the other sees what the others doing he says there's just a great impersonation that takes place so moabite is religious fundamental very religious organized all these different types and things that brother brand brings out how perfectly in sync they were they worshipped the same god as israel did they they had the same kind of fundamentalism he says but now there's an impersonation they're going to impersonate these elements that made israel different in paragraph 78 he continues that day when he was preaching in los angeles now we find here that this carnal impersonation that moab had think about this element of the moabites to impersonate he saw this prophet among israel that was able to bless curse lead and so forth so it tries to match it and this part i want you to catch by politics there's a way that we can try to become the bride not by yielding to the spiritual dynamics of the word of god but by impersonating and by politics there's a way that we can try to match what the move of god should be through politics through implementing through impersonating this is heavy we all should give a brother hughes woohoo this is heavy now that's just what's taking place in the churches today they have tried to match it with some kind of system what is it it's the spirit of moab system some kind of system you can't do it the holy spirit must be alive in the church always leading the church for the age that it's living in to confirm the word that's promised for that age god spoke the word from the beginning and so much for this age and so much for that age and certain for them age it's always happened just that way and see the holy spirit must be alive in the church to make this church live in its day it must be here today to confirm this latter day ministry latter day signs latter day pour out of the holy ghost it's just got to be there to do that and you cannot get it through working of systems cannot be through politics it cannot be through impersonation it cannot be through legislation it cannot be through organization it cannot be through structure it's gotta be by the holy spirit working in the word for this time that we're living in not trying to go back and impersonate what god did on the day of pentecost go back impersonate what happened at the birth of the laodicean church it's got to be the word for this time this moment that we're living in and where we make our mistakes is when we try to impersonate oh the gift's working and this happened and that happened we need a system that facilitates this operation we need a system that emphasizes this and lifts this up and puts this before the people no we need god's spirit to move and where god's spirit is moving people will be healed where god's spirit is moving the gifts will be moving where god's word is preached the vindication of it will be in signs and wonders following they'll be souls saved there'll be sick people healed listen the testimonies that we could share as a body in the several months that we've been together god is doing miraculous things of physical healings restoration of marriages the backsliding being saved atheists being converted god is moving but we don't produce a system to where that has the emphasis and that becomes the point and we're all trying to lift that up and make that happen and conjure it up let the word have preeminence because he said god has a system he's the one who has to give us the holy spirit he's the one who has given us the holy spirit so we have to have a system yeah just make sure it's god's system church does not ever replace or substitute god's system and let me say this church is not god's system it's a part of it it's part of it this is an important part of it so much so that i believe i had absolute confidence that when the pandemic kit and church door started closing i just felt in my heart i said we're either going to be raptured here very soon or we're getting back to church because it's part of god's program it's part of god's system and here we are we're back at church i mean god has more work to be done i believe they're souls that need to be saved there are people that are hungry for this he says now we find out here carnal impersonations matching the word of god by politics match it with some kind of system it's an impersonation of god's system so let's let's think of this in somewhat of a review moab represents religious fundamentalism message fundamentalism how about we just say that just to make everybody a little bit uncomfortable it represents a system of organization a system of politics that messes churches aren't immune from a collection of message churches that fellowship together is not are not immune from and that we as individuals are not immune from therefore god has to give us he has to give us a word to combat that and this is where i'd like to i'd like to use this in closing as kind of a way to transition into what happened when israel in their exodus on their way to the promised land which we can recognize ourselves as a member of we identify with israel as the bride going to her millennium change of body in our next place and moab then stops and resists them i want you to kind of catch this just as this would kind of be a maybe a little bit of a pivot point moab with their fundamentalism their system of organization their politics and as brother branham said that they had their own religion they had settled they had everything together and there's so many different statements that we could have read how organized they were they had their he says in one place they had their fighters they had their workers they had everything just perfect they had their board they had their members everything was so established and everything was so robust and well-oiled it was a machine he's saying they had all of this but one thing it did to them gave them a little bit of an air of superiority and so whenever israel comes when they see israel coming their instinct isn't this is our family these are our brothers and our sisters that are coming when they looked at israel they kind of had this little bit of air of superiority to think this is our stepsister right this wasn't our sister coming this is we have family ties and here they come and they're coming into the land what can we do to support them what can we do to help them there of their father abraham which was a was the uncle to our father lot and our who through which moab came and have some sort of closest how can we help you in in your journey in what you're doing but they had a little bit of arrogance whenever israel showed up and brother adam says and does god change his mind now they found out moab looking upon it balak the king he looked down upon the nation of israel he looked down on him brother branham writes in the church age book page 204 certainly moab looked down on her now catch this if you can think about this in how we're trying to pose these things moab is the natural church israel is the bride of the spiritual church and these dynamics can even work within ourselves and there's a mentality that we can have to where the message moabite mindset can look down on the humility and the meekness of a true spiritual believer and we wrestle with this idea that no we we want things to be a certain way or to appear a certain way we want to have a appear a certain way and it's the pretense it's the politics it's the impersonation and just as it can work within the individual this denominationalism is any kind of man-made system whether it be your own within yourself to keep you from following god's word or even a church structure a church mindset or a collection of churches or even a spirit that can be on a movement that identifies around something and it's just a message by mindset that kind of has this uh air of superiority and arrogance to look down on a true spiritual son or daughter of god or move of god he says certainly moab looked down on her all the other nations did too organizations always look down on the unorganized somebody say see honey that's why i don't keep a clean room that's why my desk is an absolute mess oh organization always looks down on the unorganized that can be applicable in so many different ways right those people have ocd and everything's just really neat you go into somebody's pantry and everything's organized by calorie count and color coded and it's like wow and then they see yours and organization looks down on then organized did you see her pantry it was awful they had soups mixed up and their pastas were all just in one basket you couldn't tell one from the other organization always looks down on the unorganized but now we're looking at this this conflict remember the collision the organized well-oiled well in place well-established we want we want to hide behind structure we want to hide behind humanity and flesh we want to hide behind these things but then there's a collision and the organize looks down on this unorganized and either will by determination bring them into organization or destroy them when they won't come why is there a collision we want you to become like us and he pondered that and think about it someone's taking a voice note it's not that one day all of a sudden israel showed up and they're like who are you again are we related we have distant cousins i follow you on facebook you know yeah yeah no moab had heard about israel's fame moab knew what god was doing moab knew exactly how powerful god was vindicating israel god they knew that god had brought him out of egypt with the mighty hand god they had heard about the red sea partying they had heard about the things that god was doing they had heard what they had just done to the king of the ammonites they had heard what they had done to eat them they knew that this was a mighty move of god that god was bringing them out and they knew that god was leading them to their destiny they knew the promise they were ordained to possess that land on the other side of jordan our neighbors just beyond the dead sea our neighbors just beyond the jordan river that's who's going to be our neighbor they saw exactly what was happening and instead of rejoicing and facilitating they hated israel hated him when they thought about what god was doing for him and moab felt threatened by her moab could have said hey let's help you out here let's do what we can to support you we will always have your flank we can all this is our land this is where we belong this is where we're this is what we're called to be we can't be anything more than this but if god's leading you to do something i don't want to be in your way isn't that what we're taught in the message of the hour this is what i believe this is where i'm at but if you believe god's calling you higher don't let me hinder you don't let me stop you i wouldn't want to stand in your way but they felt threatened by israel feel threatened by the spiritual church and got so bitter against her now this will tie into the future so they had to concoct a plan to make her fall because moab looked down on her i think some of you will probably do it and you'll read into it brother bam goes into great detail describing the women of moab and the women of israel and the churches of moab always look a lot prettier than the true church of israel i say always it's somewhat of a generalization there but it's the tendency of the human part to be drawn to the natural part this is going to seem like just a total rip the needle off the record but turn to first kings chapter 10 verses 1 and 2. they had heard of israel's fame and instead of being who they were instead of being happy in their land and what they had and what they possessed instead of being confident in their uh promise and their provision they felt threatened by israel they hated her moab looked down on her this little stepsister balak looked down on upon the nation of israel in first kings chapter 10 verses 1 and 2 it says when the queen of sheba heard of the fame of solomon concerning the name of the lord she came to prove him with hard questions she's coming because she wants to know is this real is this true perhaps moab could have proved israel with some hard questions is it god that has done this and what promise are you going by and what has happened we heard of this and we heard of that if god is with you can this be so in these different things she came to prove him with hard questions but notice she came with verse two and she came to jerusalem here's another gentile coming to jerusalem coming to israel hearing of this fame with a great very great train with camels that bear spices and very much gold and precious stones and these weren't her travelers checks to make sure she could buy gas and provisions on her way and have something to eat when she got there she had this because if those hard questions were answered this was something she wanted to support this is something she wanted to show that she favored that she believed in she was excited about it was worth worth getting behind and when she come to solomon she communed with him all that was in her heart in other words if she if he had the answers and brother brown brings this part out if solomon had the answers to her question then she was going to give all these spices all this gold and all these precious stones she was going to give it to the one that could answer these hard questions she wasn't going to just come and benefit by it and have all these hard questions answered like okay you guys are legit we're going to stay out of your way but there and she didn't fall for the moab side to her she looked down on this kingdom this king what is he doing and all this fame he's richer than ever anyone in the world he has wisdom too and he's building all these great palaces the queen of sheba could have felt threatened by it i'm a queen i'm royalty i have wealth and i have riches and i have trains and i have spices and i have gold and i have i have all sorts of amenities and and then begin to compete and fight listen we are never ever ever competing as message believers we are never competing as a church we have one adversary one enemy that's anything anti-word that's what we stand against there is no competition if we win as chur as a church if we win as believers while we're competing there's no joy in victory zilch not a zero nunca nothing if we do it by competing but instead of her competing what happened she said i want to go see is god really moving and i'm going to ask some hard questions and if he's got the answers i'm going to support it i'm going to give to it i'm going to i'm going to show that this is something this is of god and this is something worth worth succeeding and and show that pay that homage and brother abraham says this this is our last statement before we i have you to stand in the presence of god unrecognized he said that woman could teach pentecostals that woman could teach us yes sir support things out there that laugh and make fun of divine healing this is what moab did moab looked down on israel laughed about her stories laughed about her testimonies laughed about the things that they did laughter look at these people look at how look at how they're living and look how unorganized they are look what they're doing and and they laughed at them and they says wait this is teach them about the pentecostals let's just put ourselves in this position we as message believers can learn something from the queen of sheba the queen of sheba that means seven this queen that comes out of these seven church ages there's such a beautiful type of us who's been raised up at the last days to judge the nominal cold formal church world here you are as a bride member we can learn something from this queen of sheba to not support things that laugh and make fun of divine healing and yet you support the radio programs instead of your church i think about this the support going to radio programs let's just think very broadly i think even very specific in your life the support the time the attention even the money and the resources that you'll give to political causes of the religious causes even other things and you give it to it but yet when it comes right down to it they laugh and make fun of the very things you believe in think about it how much how much support would you get from your senator they found out what you really believed how how kind would trump be to you if he found out what the word has to say about a man of his character let's be honest i did have we finally i'm all said i'm feeling something well up inside of me that is that is beyond me right now there used to be enough character and backbone with men of god that would stand up against nonsense and adultery in filth and perversion in leaders and every prophet was characterized that from the very beginning and brother branham was characterized he wasn't afraid to call sin out and have we gotten to a place where we're afraid to speak against ungodly perverted men because they're political causes in social platforms aligned with ours because of their economic policies are more aligned with what our ambitions are in business god forbid we stand as truth we stand for truth and we support things that when in reality if fox news ever really got a whiff of what we believe that tucker carlson would make fun of us to no end somebody somehow passed a message to rush limbaugh about what we believe he'd be rolling at his grave they don't they don't support you because you believe in pro-life they don't support you because you don't believe believe in the decriminalization of marijuana they don't support you because your tied this just like they are that's not even what makes us who we are that's not what we're identified with well i don't believe that marijuana should be legal and i don't believe that you know man should marry a man and that that's not our identification that's politics that's a moral bite mindset we're in a spiritual journey we're not building a platform for political causes we're not trying to identify ourselves with some sort of political affiliation wake up wake up god's calling us to a rapture we've got to get out of these things that are holding us back if this is what has to shake you and get your attention you know if they knew what you believed they'd laugh at you am i telling the truth and it's time to get behind the word of god support something that gets the message out to where it needs to be support something that's going to facilitate a child of god coming to know truth let's stand forgive me it just that just is burning in my heart you'll find that there's a a dovetailing with what we're looking at on sundays how to even there's rioters who are now identifying the cult of trump just the same as the cult of the left and they have all the earmarks of religion i trust you know my heart i trust you understand what god's trying to say to you when it comes to the danger line of politics and causes and movements bower heads [Music] my gracious heavenly father i just want to say how clean it feels right now [Music] how your word is just scoured out things and how that we could even say as individuals we've been guilty [Music] of getting caught up with these moabite issues we had a collision and in the collision we kind of seemed to lose our way and maybe in this collision we kind of felt like we were part of that momentum of whatever collided with us but now lord there's something that is scouring us out washing us helping us to realize [Music] that we ought to show as decent human beings respect to another who disagrees with us politically and that if someone was to vote for biden that that's their prerogative as an american that's the right that's their choice if a believer voted for trump and felt that it best represented their political ideals or their objectives and matters that they felt were important whether it be uh the opportunity to homeschool or or some economic issue that those are things that are somebody's right that they're doing their civic duty to do those things there's there's a there's a process that we participate in that relates to our civic duty and our rights as americans but lord and every may we never make the mistake to think that those things are part of our rapturing may we never make the mistake of thinking that those ideals and those causes and our support of them is somehow protecting our ability to receive rapturing faith lord we could get so caught up in certain things as americans and not realize that there's bride around the world there's bride in china that's receiving rapturing faith in their political environment that does not have freedom of religion there's bride in europe lord that's coming to rapturing faith where there is no homeschool there's social uh socialized medicine lord there's and there's hate crime laws and there's a lot of restrictive things in their lives that certainly they're not supportive of and if they would change they would be happy to do it and lord somehow we get so caught up in things today and we begin to identify with certain ideals and movements and groups and we join in our these causes and we've lost our way [Music] i don't feel that i've lost my point tonight or my uh leadership in this the lord we would be laughed at mocked and made fun of by a lot of these people if they knew what we believed and lord you've overwhelmed me with this for some time now just biding time and waiting for the moment to express this lord may we support your truth get behind your word and not be guilty of supporting radio programs and movements and systems that would laugh and mock and look down upon what we believe [Music] and give the right balance in these things lord charitable causes and what we can donate to and what we spend our time in lord there's many wonderful worthwhile endeavors that are not in the name of christianity or even in the name of uh of or just not even in the name of christianity let alone something that would be near to our hearts in the message but may we not be under this wrong denominational mindset be discerning be understanding be motivated be moved that we as the bride are on a spiritual journey we see tonight even more clearly why roof had to be called out of moab not if not out of philistine not out of edom not an ammonite not an egyptian not a syrian [Music] but a moabite i'm seeing who you are in this story and what you are to me [Music] and this revelation has drawn me closer to you may it be so for us lord maybe so for those that are here tonight maybe so for those that we hear this may they be drawn closer to you bless your people tonight we commit them all to you go with us as we're dismissed we thank you father for your plainness for your boldness [Music] for you taking your liberty to speak to us lord i say it as a as a man that was you lord speaking through these lips we thank you that you would have the boldness to speak to us the things that we needed to hear in the name lord jesus christ amen amen
