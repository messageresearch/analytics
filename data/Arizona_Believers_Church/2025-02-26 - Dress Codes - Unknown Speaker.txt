TRANSCRIPT
========================================
but John chapter 19: 19-23 and I really wrestled with just what text to take and I'm not sure how far I'll get I was going to read the story of the Hebrew children in being thrown into the fiery furnace and uh it uh if I don't get that if I get that far we'll just recapture that story since we're dealing with u former knowledge for most of you anyways John chapter 19 verse 19 and pilate wrote a title and put it on the cross and the writing was Jesus of Nazareth the king of the Jews this title then read many of the Jews for the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city and it was written in Hebrew and Greek and Latin then said the chief priest of the Jews to pilate write not the king of the Jews but that he said I am King of the Jews pilate answered what I have written I have written very interesting signpost or display then the soldiers when they had crucified Jesus took his garments and made four parts to every Soldier a part and also his coat now the coat was without seam woven from the top throughout they said therefore among themselves let us not Rend it but cast lots for it whose it shall be that the scripture might be fulfilled which saith they parted my reignment among them and for my vesture did they cast lots these things therefore the soldiers did and I just read a little bit further in there but we just we desire God to take this word and give us some understanding so you can be seated I'll give you my title it here just in a moment so if you like to write down the text there's the text if You' like to write the title it'll come shortly but I want to start with First Corinthians chapter 7 verse 31 for this is this is where we were last Wednesday and Paul in addressing the shortness of time and the attitudes of people he said those that weep be as though You Weep not and those that rejoice as though you rejoice not and those that have wives be as though you had none and it was kind of relating to attitude and what you commit yourself to and what takes preeminence and his kind of conclusion is that you can attend unto the Lord without distraction and he makes this statement and they that use this world those that get something out of it and and leverage it and have use of it uh and taking something from it as not abusing it for the fashion of this world passeth away there's this uh acknowledgment that being in the world though we're not of the world being in the world we will have to make use of the world and that's from everything to drive your car wearing the clothes you have on tonight uh if we say it's either of God or of the world there's a lot of things in our lives that we know are of the world but he says those that use it don't abuse it that means if it's available to you don't fully use it because in using the world we can use it to such an extreme that it becomes our it is to our detriment it's this excess or lack of moderation that causes this Tipping Point where you can use the world and we use the world uh for income we use the world for certain needs and certain things but there's a point at which it that it can tip to become a detriment to us and that's what we used last Wednesday when we preached on the subject fashion that the Fashions of this world pass away and that word world is a cosmos which is adorning or decoration it's kind of like that orderly or harmonious Arrangement or the constitution of something and the way it's phrased in the Fashions of this world and if the world has fashioned something we saw that it's temporary that it doesn't really speak to someone the the Integrity of it it's not strong it's just temporary and the world's Fashions of these outward adorning and what you see by the eye it misleads that word passeth away means to lead aside it departs from the path that's on it quickly changes Direction and we all run out and we buy something because we want to be the cool kid and by the time we finally get home with it it's not cool anymore and that's how the Fashions of the world work it departs it changes it's uncertain and the word fashion is that uh word schema means the figure and so not only does it uh relate to the appearance of something but it's also uh the habitus the condition the appearance the way that they dress but it also speaks of actions and manner of life so worldly uh Fashions things of this world as far as Pursuits and habits all these forms are always shifting and always changing so Paul is saying those that use the world don't get comfortable with it don't sell yourself out to it because it's going to pull the rug out from underneath you it's not what we live by it's not what we live for that should not be our world so in 1 Peter 3:3 it says who's adorning speaking to a sister a believing uh lady who's adorning let it not be that outward adorning of platting the hair and of wearing of gold or of putting on of apparel and saying who's Cosmos it's the same word there that's used for the fashion which is the schema of this world is the cosmos whose World whose Arrangement let it not just be about the adorning of the hair and wearing of gold and putting on of a we could say this to all of us uh men or women or brother or sister that our your Cosmos or your world is not dressing to excite attract attraction our dressing isn't platting the hair so that it can turn heads our our dressing isn't wearing of gold or putting on a apparel that can signal something flashy or attractive but he says it's a meekness of spirit that ought to be our world so it's a humility and I could say this the bride's world is ordered it is arranged it is fashioned by the word amen God made the world in the beginning by his word the bride's reality her world her Cosmos is not just this outward uh making ourselves look good to fit in with the world but it is fashioned by the word and this is a point I'm carrying over to tonight and we said it last Wednesday to say that God looks in the heart and that a looking in the heart he knows the character of a man and God looks at you in your faith and you're justified by faith that truth that truth that God looks on the heart of a man and that in the eyes of God if you've been baptized uh sealed by the Holy Ghost and you're born again then God looking at your soul sees it as perfect and complete that's what God looks at but that truth does not stand for another truth that God doesn't care about or disregards your appearance we say well the soul is sealed and God looks on the heart it doesn't matter the way you look that's not true that truth that the God looks at the heart does not create a subsequent truth that God doesn't care about the outside God wants even your physical appearance to portray a spiritual message God wants the way that you act the way that you talk the way that you do your hair the way that you dress he wants there it to convey uh um what has happened even in your soul in Philippians chapter 2:8 and being found speaking of Jesus Christ being found in fashion as a man that's the schema of a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross I know I'm going over a lot more review from last time than maybe normal but I think this is good so that my dear friend doesn't think I'm crazy if this Foundation was necessary in preaching it but he say really I have more motive than just that but uh at least we got it out there that I'm nervous that Brother Paul's here but being found in the image of the fashion the habitus of a man in other words Jesus looked just like a man he dressed just like a man he ate just like a man he slept just like a man he did things that all men do even to the point to where uh the Pharisees took issue with how he lived his life as a man and but yet in that he humbled himself and became obedient to God's word so though you are in the fashion of a human being a man or a woman that we can find ourselves through humility being obedient to the word of God because Christ in flesh the word in flesh never changes God's nature or God's ways there's going to be humility and obedience and so our fashion must fit his form we can we're human we're going to dress we're going to wear human clothes and there's a certain way that we're going to conduct ourselves and do worldly things so to speak but yet even in doing it in our dressing in our activity and our Recreations and those things even to the point of the things that we would ingest and the way that we talk the things that we laugh at must still be in the his nature and his character Galatians 3: 27 for as many of you have have been baptized into Christ by one Spirit we're baptized into Christ so this is the new birth which is the Seal of God the baptism of the Holy Ghost by that spiritual baptism we are in the body of Christ so he says those who have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ This is a language of dressing this is a language of clothing this is a language of putting on something to give an appearance in Colossians 3: 12 and 13 it says put on therefore as the elect of God you who are the elect of God You Are Holy and beloved put on wear uh as I'm putting a garment on your flesh vowels of mercies kindness humbleness of Mind meekness longsuffering these are all very spiritual Concepts he says forbearing one another and forgiving one another If any man have a quarrel against any these are things we need to put on and so this is telling you if you're not wearing this wear it even as Christ forgave you so also do ye does not take away your ction does not take away your Holiness or your belovedness but he says as one who's been baptized into Christ we are to continue to put on Christ we're getting dressed so to speak so put on here in both instances as a term of dressing or clothing it would signify what someone is wearing and I realize that in many of these scriptures we're going to use tonight we would most often look at it in a spiritual sense but I want to make a point and this is where I'm going to give you my title my title tonight is dress codes and I had a lot of different titles I was working on um AI suggested holy drip I really liked it uh but I I I I decided not to but dress codes and I want to identify clearly in the scripture that how we dress is important to God I believe that there's a certain point at which we can without getting into the specifics of what kind of dress God desires specifically who says well he wants Holiness he wants righteousness he wants modesty well then we could argue about modesty one of my other titles is going to be between the burka and the bikini somewhere in the middle right is the modesty that God's looking for and so regard whether we get into the specifics or the extremes of it we must recognize and believe and come to this satisfaction that God does care about how you dress it matters to God how you look and add dress codes as we just keep this here for a moment a dress code would be a set of rules that kind of outline or specify what's required in terms of dress uh in a particular situation so it's a set of rules spec uh specifying the required manner of dress some sort of customary style of dress or for a specified group or a certain activity I think there's a meme out there that sometimes they take a picture of somebody and it says it's when you have class at noon and a boxing match at 1 and so they're dressed in a way where it looks like uh you know they got something that comes up later on or has a dual purpose and a code is a system of words or letters or figures or even symbols that convey meaning or signal something so I'm kind of using more than just one meaning here a jurass code is a set of rules but in it being a code we think oh it's rules but codes convey meaning codes convey a a something of substance a code could be some assigned series of letters or or numbers or symbols for the purpose of identifying something and the way that a person dresses forms a code that signifies their identity that conveys a certain meaning dress code is a language exactly dress codes or they have a dress code for certain things and like even Saturday night we had a a coup's dinner and it was for married couples and the widows and widowers in our in our assembly and and the dress code was business casual well there's a lot of people and and it's kind of given as a guideline and so people would dress and it didn't necessarily in our instance here we're just so laidback it didn't necessarily signify that um brother Paul thinks business casual is a tuxedo but there's just different ways of interpreting that to some people but that's what a dress Cod is for Black Tie formal different things are to signify the nature of the event and to also create an atmosphere around it it's one of the reasons for the Pomp and Circumstance with all the award shows and the way people dress it's to kind of create a certain culture a certain feeling to cultivate a certain atmosphere and certain signifying certain things through these dress codes there's certain award ceremonies that require women to wear high heels for men to wear tuxedos and and bold ties and they do this to create a particular image it's a language that conveys meaning in Matthew chap 23:5 I'd like for us to revisit some of these things to just see how that this applies uh as a language to signify the way you dress speaking to the Pharisees but all their works they do for to be seen of men notice the motive behind it is to attract the wrong attention it says they make broad their felies and enlarg the borders of their garments so they to bind the word upon them they it wasn't good enough just to meet the mark they wanted it to be extravagant so that it couldn't be missed and they weren't doing it to honor the Lord with their dedication to the word they were doing it to excess to signify I'm more spiritual than you it it's it's like sometimes they say the joke is the bigger the Bible the better the Christian right and some people are bringing their family bible to church and you're like there's just no way I can compete with this guy but it is something to signify and it says and they large the borders of their garments why they want to they want to be seen in what was doing it what they would carry what they would wear upon them their felies and the borders of their garments was a to socially amongst the people signify it became a dress code that they used to signal and to speak a language about who they were and Esther 8:15 another example of how dress is used after morai had been recognized as one who saved the king from a conspiracy and it reminds me of one of my favorite Veggie Tales is the one on Esther and there's a point there where the one that I hope I didn't offend anybody but uh the hmon I don't come here if he's played by Mr Lunt or who he's played by but he is conspiring right and so those who disobey the word of God get banished to the aisle of Perpetual tickling and so more hmon thinks he's really set it up in morai is going to really going to have it and and he and they've gone out and they've done something a and is Mori is all happy and Mr hmon says you won't be laughing tomorrow or yes you will never mind right because he was going to be banished to the aisle of P Perpetual tickling I just needed to say something to Draw Rowan into the service this evening and and so here Mori goes out from the presence of the king and the King has declared I want him to be recognized for his great service and he doesn't just put them in Uber black and send them around the city he wants it to be conspicuous he wants to signal to the people some honor so it says in Royal apparel of the blue and white and with the great crown of gold and with a garment of fine linen and purple and the City of shashan rejoiced and was glad so he used Royal apparel certain colors a great crown of gold and Garment of fine linen and purple he didn't want to be mistaken for a valet driver no one wanted to think that the Royal Chariot had been stolen but he wanted to signify this is somebody who's being honored by allowing him to wear Royal garments so there was a way that he dressed there was a certain expectation or code for Kings how they dressed and now as he's wearing it the way he looks conveys something just going to reference uh American goth it very quickly I'm sure some of you are familiar with this it's by Grant Wood the 1930 and I'm just curious do anybody know who these people are not personally but what they might do anybody want to guess farmer now what made you think that yeah well the Pitchfork is one thing they're dressed humble people working people and there's a certain sense of conveying through the way they dress a and the way that they present themselves they they have this very austere look and so these are hardworking humble people from the earth so to speak and I'm going to maybe use more images later on in this at a future service but I'm wanting you just to consider how that the way someone dresses and especially if you're portraying something through a medium such as painting that you're going to deduce by what they wear and what's around them who they are and what their status is if all you have is a glimpse if all you have is a moment we can say well I'm Christians come and visit me spend some time at my home go to church with me and if you've spent enough time with me maybe there's a way that you would know that I'm a Christian but if someone only has a glimpse it really says a lot about that moment where they see you where you don't want to look so much like the world that you just blend in right good in Luke chap 16: 19 it says there was a certain rich man Devas Dives however you want to say it which was clothed in purple and fine linen and fared sumptuously every day the way that he dressed signified that he was rich separated him from The Peasants or the the the Beggars at his door and if I could say this there is a Biblical dress code it is developed using God's language that's right and that God has written things in his word a certain code that if we will engage in it and let run its course in our lives that there's something that it wants to feature something that it wants to display and that there is a Biblical dress code that's right in Matthew chap 22: 1 11 and 12 says and when the king came in to see the guest and I'm just jumping right into the middle of this Parable he says so there's this wedding Feast this wedding supper the king comes in and he sees all these guests and he saw there a man which had not a wedding garment and he saith unto him friend how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment and he was speechless this is alluding to brother banam goes to Great Links to explain some of these things and it's commonly accepted in the through for Bible students that there was this custom where in these type of Feasts that a host would provide the appropriate garments for those who attended the feast and you would be properly you would be properly dressed and everyone would dress that way so that in the party or at the feast there would be no everyone would be dressed the same regardless of their social class regardless of how much money they had or how far they traveled or what their circumstance might be the host would do that and in doing it the evening would be cohesive and I I'm not so much sure that a lot of it had to do with Instagram at the time where they wanted everything just to look just right for the pictures there's this painter over there in the corner feverishly painting everyone dressed in white and but yet there's this uh image that they want to portray and notice that the king walks into the room in a immediately know that the man was not wearing the provided wedding garment he immediately knew there wasn't this spectrum of all well it can go through this way and it can go that way he immediately knew because it stood outer clashed with how everyone else was dressed the king had provided garments to wear for the wedding supper this one did not get the Garment did not follow the instructions was not dressed in a way that declared and showed what was right and what was proper that's right that's good and so I believe that what we ought to realize is that our clothing or our appearance is not without consequence or meaning EXC there are it's and we wouldn't want to necessarily come up with a set of rules and say you can only order these clothes with these skew numbers from these websites but it's a challenge to those of us who are dressing ourselves or dressing our children are working together in a way to please the Lord as a family that we have this mindset that not just anything goes as long as it's closed in Revelations 19: 7 to8 just carrying on with this subject of not having a wedding garment and how it was something appropriate for the occasion there was a dress code for this wedding Feast it says in Revelations 19: 78 let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb is come and his wife hath made herself ready and to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints the Bible just does not uh comment that she dressed herself for a wedding it says she made herself ready and they begin to speak about the things that she was granted and she should be because she was to be arrayed in fine linen clean and white and it signified the Holiness and the righteousness and the correct n of the Saints and it says it was given it was given to her so it was not it was given if I can say it was given because it was required if it didn't matter well you know come as you are remain as you are but it was required so it was commissioned therefore it was supplied that's right when it says it was given to her it was furnished he furnished the Necessities for the wife to make herself ready God wasn't even necessarily stressing about it and ringing his hand hands and say here let me put this on here let me put that on he provides the word he provided the Necessities he provided that which we're to dress ourselves in and we dress ourselves in that just as Esther went before the king in those things that the servant had made available to her she didn't try to dress herself she didn't try to impress the king she went with the instructions that the the servant knew the servant of the king knew would catch the king's eye in Revelations 21:2 it says John saw the holy city knew Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband that word adorned means made ready she dressed herself she was dressed appropriately for the occasion why because there's dress codes for the occasion of a marriage this is a rule that's maybe quite often violated maybe not amongst our circles but on the wedding day the bride wears the white dress and dare anybody else do that because it would it would violate decorum it would violate these certain boundaries there's a dress code I know we're all familiar with the concept of a dress code here the bride has adorned and made herself ready who for her husband there's something that she has in mind when she's making herself ready we see this at the end of the book The Bible in Revelations 21 it's given to her to be array in a certain clothing we know in the Book of Genesis as we looked at it here recently how that when man fell when he first became conscious of his nakedness it was his instinct to cover it up uh immodesty nakedness uh is the is the human instinct to cover up if they don't have that instinct it's because through the particular culture and the process of time they've just gone numb to it right uh or it's in some sort of setting where they have it's never been shamed or scandalized as we see some people they're still Native and they dress a certain way and it doesn't maybe hold the same attraction to other people but here we could think of in Genesis as soon as they sinned they covered themselves because they were ashamed once they saw the power of these things and how it could be used they they covered that but that wasn't enough for God man's instinct to only do so much wasn't enough but it says in Genesis 3:21 and unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins and clothe them God institutes clothing you say well the original way is this no God institutes clothing in the end of the book we're not back in the original form of being naked and not being ashamed God clothes the bride clothes herself there are garments there are ways to dress that are represented in the scripture amen it was a covering for the body what did he use the innocence of a lamb it signifies humility and modesty was not just a loin cloth that man put on but it was a full garment as we looked at this scripture in the past we saw how that it's most likely that God did not literally slay the lamb and Stitch the Garment but he provided for it as he did in Revelations 198 he gave them the Revelation this is what you ought to do and Adam went and slew the lamb and he and his wife made clo why because God gave it to them gave them the revelation that they ought to dress themselves more than just with their fig leaves so I Believe by Revelation God's bride has by Revelation the bride has God's dress code Brother B said it's his own word it's his righteousness that we're dressed in and Isaiah 61:3 again we're just wanting to clearly identify in Scripture that what you wear your garments are important to God they have meaning and significance if I could say this a lot of the script we're going to use are going to refer to maybe a spiritual principle but it's going to use a language that speaks of how we dress and we shouldn't dismiss in this process that oh he's just using as a type it means how you dress is so significant and important and conveys such Rich meaning that God can use it as a type it's like God does with the love his own love he has to compare it to a love of a mother so that we can begin to understand and we don't just dismiss the love of a mother and just say well God's different we say no that's the way a mother should love because God wants to use it to compare himself to in Isaiah 61:3 to appoint unto them that mourn in Zion I know there's a lot of scriptures here we're leaving out but to give unto them Beauty for Ashes this would signify an appearance where one is trying to show themselves in mourning the oil of joy for mourning the Garment of Praise for the spirit of heaviness that they might be called the Trees of Righteousness the plain in the Lord that he might be glorified God wants to change your appearance with Beauty for ashes oil of joy for mourning and swap out the spirit of heaviness with the Garment of Praise so that you can be identified as righteous trees that God has planted you're not wishy-washy you're not spineless that you that he might be glorified the Lord this Garment of Praise it's a dressing or clothing that signifies joy and though most might just say well this it's meant to refer to a joyful Spirit but a Garment of Praise In this context contrast the sackcloth that someone who's mourning would wear and you wouldn't try to figure out say I can't tell if they're laughing or crying you could tell by the sackcloth that they probably are wanting you to think they're crying you could tell by the ashes that they're trying to portray that they're grieving and they're mourning and God says I don't want you to be looked down on anymore I want you to dress and act and wear a character about you that shows that you know who you are that you know your position I like that brother yes sir amen Ecclesiastes 9:8 it says let thy garments be always white and let thy head lack no ointment white is a token of Joy this spotlessness this white garment it symbolizes the righteousness of Christ he wants to swap out a spirit of heaviness for garments of praise the Bible says let your garments always be white it's a dress code for the occasion think about it a dress code for the occasion a dress code for the season I I don't know if I've used it here necessarily but when you pack for a vacation and where you're going somewhere you don't you don't pack for where you are you pack for where you're going and when we know that we're going to an eternal righteous holy city then we prepare accordingly so that we we ought to be those kind of people that find ourselves at the point of dep departure and everyone else is dressed for the winter and they look over at us and be like he must be going to somewhere warm well in the opposite we got a lot of people around here who dress for a place that's going to be really really hot and we should be dressed for a place that's going to be holy a place that's going to be righteous there there ought to be an outward adorning that signifies that we're ready to meet the challenge of the moment there ought to be some sort of outward adorning that says I've got work to do and I'm dressed for that work and Isaiah 59:17 the scripture speaks to that Prin principle for he put on righteousness as a breastplate and a helmet of salvation upon his head and he put on the garments of Vengeance for clothing and was clad with Zeal as a cloak it uses the breastplate the helmet the robe a a a and the clothing and a cloak all to convey an attitude a disposition and to signify what he's about to do knows if you were going to dig a ditch you might have boots on and a shovel in your hand and you're you're prepared you're adorned for the occasion for the moment there's a dress code that's required for work that needs to be done and they figured enough out I don't know if we've baned disbanded OSHA yet maybe that's on the table coming up but there's uh there's certain requirements in certain workplaces like wear steel toed shoes because you never know when a piece of metal might fall and hit you on your foot and there goes your toesies right there's a way that you dress wear a helmet wear this do that wear goggles there's things it's dress code because of what you're doing and you want to be prepared for the activity in Isaiah 61:10 notice now he that had a breastplate and a helmet and garments says I will greatly rejoice in the Lord my soul shall be joyful in my God for he hath clothed me with the garments of Salvation he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness as a bridegroom dethorn and as a bride adorne herself with her Jewels it it it's it's of those Customs there's some uh religions and some cultures where there's a very specific way that a bridegroom would dress and there's certain things he's going to Adorn himself with and it would signify to everybody else he's getting married and I know that in our culture that there's been a lot of changes in how weddings are conducted where you can wear whatever you want maybe or dress however you want and that's certainly fine there's no scriptural prescription for it but the point is there's usually some identifying Factor if we were all going to wear overalls for brother loy's wedding uh uh we would all have overalls in a white press shirt and and but brother loy's overalls might be a different color I have no idea if he's engaged I don't know if he's in a relationship uh I know he's out of town for work so it just makes a very convenient uh punching bag but he would wear something to distinguish him from all the other bridegroom or the groomsmen right something and and same with the bride could you imagine a whole bridal party men and women all showing up in wedding dresses like whoa who's getting married right you can't even tell by a beard anymore and Isaiah 51 52:1 it says notice this awake awake put on thy strength o Zion where is her strength put on thy beautiful garments oh Jerusalem the holy city for henceforth there shall no more come into Thee the uncircumcised and the unclean your strength is identified by your dress your character your integrity your strength your your confidence is indicated by what you wear yes now please just bear with me I don't want to go lengthy tonight that's not my desire at all but I do have a lot that I want to continue to express when we read these things especially if we say a spirit of heaviness and a Garment of Praise there's something abstract about that there may be something intangible about well what is a spirit of heaviness and what is a Garment of Praise And there's certain things we might say well let your garments be always we might say well some have taken that to create a cult that only wears white right there's certain things that people take and they really construe it as a literal prescription to dress a certain way we're only going to wear fine linen and it's only going to be white so there is something uh that we don't take as a literal mandate to wear only white but there's something symbolized by that white which is the Bible says the righteousness of the Saints this fine linen and I could go I'll go further to say that there is something intangible and uh abstract about a personal revelation of Jesus Christ a personal revelation of Jesus Christ is exactly that it's personal when you get a revelation of Jesus Christ I don't share in that Revelation the moment that you received the Holy Ghost and you knew that you were born again I wasn't somewhere else going oh my goodness Elliot just got the Holy Ghost it's not how it happens it's very personal I I and there may be those that would uh brother Brandon may be working sometimes in a prophetic realm and he'd be able to see the the pillar fire fall on somebody and he may identify a spiritual experience but speaking in general the personal revelation of Jesus Christ is to the individual it's inward it's deep and so the scriptures constantly as we've already referenced these things that are intangible or abstract God's word demonstrates that there is a physical portrayal of our spiritual revelation James says that God sees your faith and you're Justified but your faith has works and it's by those works that it declares and portrays a spiritual Revelation in second Peter chap 3:14 wherefore beloved see that you look for such see and that you look for such things be diligent that you may be found of him in peace without spot and blameless this without spot and blameless yes we are uh innocent before God our souls having been Justified but there's still this pursuit of this Perfection cannot be sinless Perfection because you're born in sin you we all have a past but there is a desire to be without spot and without blemish is as the scriptures teach that these things that are happening in your your your uh communion services are spots in your Feast of Charity and there should be this desire to cleanse and to check ourselves up and to be sure that we're operating not with the excuse that we all have spots but the desire that we would be without spot and blameless we've already covered that a lot in in looking at Holiness this this goes to this extends to our outward appearance not just that our conscience would be pure but having a heart that's purged from unrighteousness a soul that's sealed and a spirit that's being renewed by the word of God uh I think it would be good if it kind of seeped out a bit in your words seeped out in your actions in the way that you dress 1 Peter chap 2: 9 and 10 in like manner also that women Adorn themselves in modest apparel this is very specific you cannot construe this to say oh it's just referring to this cute little knit sweater around the heart just a little Chicken Soup for the Soul no this is literal it's saying that a woman a sister in the body of Christ ought to dress and cover herself with modest apparel rate me debate debate me on what modest apparel is but at least we're debating that the apparel must be modest right that it's a requirement scripture requirement now it's not just the modest apparel but there's a shamefacedness and sobriety that goes with it so we cannot just everyone wear white and somehow achieve this holy status it's with shamefacedness and sobriety not with broided hair or gold or pearls or costly array but which becometh women professing godliness with good works I know that we could really stir up a debate on braided hair gold or pearls or costly array but notice that Paul is hitting at this desire to present yourself in a way that attracts the attention of the world for the wrong reasons it's not something that makes somebody thirsty because you're being salty but it makes somebody competitive because you're being salty right you're dressing in a way to provoke and to instigate that's right I'm laying in this Foundation because I want us to see and Lord will we'll get to it on Sunday how that there is a consequence for dressing provocatively in a way that is designed for sexual attraction and when God in Deuteronomy 22:5 says that a woman shouldn't wear a man's garment and a man shouldn't wear a woman's garment at the heart of it is that model of dressing for sexual attraction or to express or to to declare in some way your sex beyond that which is normal or god-given a woman ought to dress in modest apparel in a way that is becoming of a woman that professes to be Godly and she must also be sober and shamefaced Ephesians chap 5: 27 speaking of Christ that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle what does that refer to the spot or wrinkle is your FL your garments the spot or wrinkle is using the image of a a robe or a gown uh some sort of uh clothing or garment not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish it's not just the flesh it's not just the spirit as we looked at the requirements of the sacrifice and those things that were Abomination to God will always remain Abomination and the rules of the sacrifice is pointed to a perfect sacrifice which is Christ and we found that the same requirements for Christ are the same requirements for us as he was without blemish and without spot as an innocent sacrifice we too are to also be without spot and blemish and it uses a language that refers to our clothing I think sometimes that's why we like to wear linen because it can look better wrinkled no which one is it it's corduroy remember my brother one time was wearing a sear sucker suit and a brother showed up and said man where do you plug that thing in in Revelations 3:4 thou Hast a few names in Sardis which have not defiled their garments this is speaking literally of their clothing and they shall walk with me in white for they are them there's some illusion to even the prescriptions in the law where one would handle something with their garment and it would be kept a certain way and that garment would be considered unclean or defiled and a priest or someone else wouldn't be able to perform a certain function or enter a certain place but he says there's people who have not defiled their garments he talking about clothing that is in some way perverted or defiled or spotted they shall walk with me in white for they are worthy Revelations chap 16:15 behold I come as a thief blessed is he that WTH and keepeth his garments lest he walk naked and they see his shame it's the one that watches needs to be dressed for watching right there's this illusion to the the priest who would walk about the temple in the mountain and at a certain time there were certain Le Levites that would need to be on guard and he would go and he would try to find those who were uh awake if they were awake and they were sleeping he would Rous them up but if someone had taken off their clothes and fall asleep he would this is just the story that's used traditionally he would burn their clothes so that when they woke from their watch they would be shamed in walking back home naked and there there's this requirement then that speaks of if you're on guard if you're watching then dress appropriately we're not dressed for sleep it's high time that we awake out of sleep that we dress a certain way we act a certain way cuz as Paul says in Romans that this is a time where we got to awake to righteousness we got to dress ourselves in clothes ourselves not just in our thought process but in a thought process and a way of discerning that has implications in the way that we treat one another talk to each other dress raise our children it covers everything brother Paul you shared this with me decades ago on the phone but we were talking about the third pool in the open of the word and you said that your desire was to take those things a and where rubber met the road and made make the seventh seal practical that's what God's wanting us to do is not have Gatherings like this where it's just magic the Gathering and we're all just playing cards and we can go home and be something else but we want to find where this word that is so elusive can become concrete and lived out in lives yes sir blessed is he that watches who's on Watch Who's to be looking and is dressed that way so that he doesn't find himself not dressed appropriately and he's ashamed in Exodus 12 when they're in their Exodus not did he tell them how to prepare the lamb how to eat the lamb but he told him how to dress and thus shall you eat it with your loins gted and your shoes on your feet and your staff in your hand and you shall eat it in haste it is the Lord's Passover someone could say I've already done all this with a one-year-old lamb and I did it this way and I prepared it and I may eat all of it and now I've got to have shoes on my feet and I've got to have my loins guarded yeah and a staff in your hand is this enough and God says there's a reason for it God had a dress code for the Passover meal and what did what did the dress signify they're ready to leave what would it say about somebody if they believe this is the last meal before the death angel passes over and on the tomorrow we're going to leave Egypt and they haven't bothered packing it all they didn't bother dressing they didn't bother uh looking the part they didn't bother doing anything that would signify I believe I'm leaving in the morning I believe that I'm reflecting a holy place I believe I'm a bride that's prepared for her husband but nothing changes in the outward nothing changes in the tongue nothing changes in the relationships to signify that they really believe it their loins were girded it was a way that showed that they were they could quickly move shoes on their feet they didn't have to go running and looking around for their slips they were ready staff in hand and I say God has an ordained dress code amen there are dress codes the world has them all sorts of situation has them but God has an or dress code to express his character it's his nature and his way doing fantastic on time I'm just encouraging myself in the Lord we're doing fantastic on time tonight so I'll just make reference to the sermon we preached on deceptive form recently where there's shapes and forms that signify something that's not there right it's done to deceive that's what Deuteronomy 225 is all about is a woman in any way relinquishing her glory as a woman in mixing signals as a man to look like a man same with the man it's a deceptive form so this God's dress code is not an external thing alone it's got to be this internal work of God that works its way to the out in 2 Timothy 3:5 speaking of the end time they have a form of godliness but denying the power thereof the power of Revelation brother BR says from such turn away they can have the appearance of good but Evil Within they can have a form of godliness but be Godless and so our Holiness is not hypocritical we're not just trying to achieve a form of godliness I this is I think sometimes and I wasn't maybe planning on saying this here but sometimes there's this attitude uh uh that we can get where if a brother wears something that's pink well he's just a pervert like well I can just guess where you were born right because they just think any kind of pink you're you're a pervert right and it's just all they get really worked up and they're just judging on color alone well if if we're not careful by by this uh by taking away certain things that we can't wear we're subconsciously signaling that we can be virtuous by only what we wear if we say well we're not allowed to wear pink if we're brothers we we can't wear pink well you've just bought into some 19 20th century uh modality that they came up with because it it wasn't always that way there wasn't always these color schemes where this is for the girls and this is for the boys that was probably just a commercialization thing like we need to sell more blue well make blue for men oh it worked let's make a color for the girls pink boom right or maybe it was just a matter of trying to tell the difference of babies in the nurseries cuz we're no longer having home birth right we got 40 babies in a nursery War it's like who's a girl who's a boy right right there's ways you want to tell them apart by quickly glancing and so there's this idea that we can have this construct in our minds that well if we avoid this and avoid that but it's not that alone we can have the appearance of godliness the form of it but lack the Revelation that drives behind it so I'm not advocating for us sitting down and figuring out the dress code and just checking the Box Zechariah 13: 4-6 says and it shall come to pass in that day that the prophet shall be ashamed every one of his vision when he prophesy these are very weighty words neither shall they wear a rough garment to deceive but he shall say I am no Prophet I am a husbandman for man taught me to keep cattle from my youth notice why don't you catch what's happening here that they had dressed in a way at a time there was a dress code for a prophet and you dress a certain way and you did that to signify that you're not a herdsman you're not just a Shepherd you're not just a a dresser of the vineyard you are a prophet you're this humble man of the Wilderness who speaks on God's behalf so there was a dress code for prophets that were given as a sign and here they're admitting that they weren't actually prophets but they were trying to look the part and they come to their position I want you to think very closely about this there's still men today that want to give you the impression that they're prophets and they instead of just being pastors instead of just being husbandmen instead of just staying in their place they want you to think by their appearance that they're prophets and by God's grace there will be those who will recognize the heir their ways and repent and be ashamed of their false prophecies and say I will no longer try to wear the mantle of a prophet I am but a husbandman and I've been taught to keep the Sheep so that's what I'll do in second Kings chapter 1:8 and they answered him about who is it that did this and they said he was a hairy man it was speaking of the Garment he was wearing cuz they wear the garments of the animal with the hair turned out it was a rough garment they wear rough garment to deceive and a girt with a girdle of leather about his loins and he said it is Elijah the tishbite just had to describe the way he dressed it's kind of like we say well who was it that did that it's like what sister was it it's like well she had long hair and we're like yep immediately we know who it was no but this was so particular Elijah dressed in a way to where was like Elijah the tis bite that's who it is Matthew chap 3:4 and same John and the same John had his rment of camel's hair and a leathern girdle about his loins and his meat was Locust and wild honey so Zechariah it's talking about false prophets who imitated true prophets to deceive the people and they were using the way that they would dress they'd put on these rough hairy garments as if they were humble men self-denying men even without thinking about it many people today will try to impersonate brother brandham through a a a forced humility yes that is just a impersonation of the nature that we're familiar with on tape to where they want to talk a certain way dress a certain way act a certain way Force themselves to hunt and do all sorts of things to try to come off as this uh uh this consumate message believer and it's no different than putting on rough and hairy garments to show that we're humble we're hbling ourselves to the message and we're forcing ourselves to do these certain things but it cannot be this kind of forced image of a carnal person it must be God on the inside Amen in Ephesians CH 4:14 and that you put on the new man which after God like God is created in righteousness and true Holiness we are to be putting on the new man that this new man that we put on is like God who now dwells in our souls Colossians 3:10 talks about taking off the old man's fashion taking off putting off the old man and putting on the new man that if we have been gener re born again in our souls that we now have this different metric we now have a different dress code we now can by the renewing of our mind be transformed and be conformed to the image of Christ who though he was in the fashion of a man he humbled himself obediently to God's [Music] code there isn't a personation that we can do but that's not what I'm advocating we're to put on the new man yes in Luke 5 vers verse 36 he spake also a parable unto them no man putteth a piece of a new garment upon an old if otherwise then both the new maketh a rent and the peace was taken out of the new agree Earth not with the old I know there's so much Rich principles we can share here but he's just sharing common sense about clothing and apparel you don't cut up a perfectly good new garment to repair an old one now I want you to follow me in this vein that once we are being once we are renewed inwardly by the holy ghost that even the way the lives that we live is not to be Patchwork it it's not a situation where we just want to keep this and get rid of that we want a complete transformation Hall here it doesn't say that what's being presented is that you have a you have a shirt and it's a certain type of shirt and and it's basically saying that if you had something that was broken or torn you use a perfectly good shirt to repair the old one so it's not saying we don't wear shirts anymore but saying wear wear the new one tailor in other words a tailor won't damage something new and whole and complete to repair the old it's not common sense you've got a new garment here why use the new garment to patch up an old one because if you do that both are now damaged in doing so they're misaligned and mismatched a new piece even if it's the same you learned this if you're if you're ever wanting to replace the tile one tile in your house you better go find the right lot on the right day from the right Kil at the very moment all the other ones were done we built a house in Texas and after we' already moved in I'm going this tile doesn't match we had like four different color tile in our bathroom it's like well we're eclectic right we we meant to do this no tile guy just didn't buy enough and he bought others and it's the same brand right same color but it doesn't match so things could be misaligned and mismatched the new piece will not match the color the texture or even the wearin it'll be unappealing just using these practical principles as the foundation of a much deeper spiritual truth I recognize that if I could say this what does it tell us let's not take our old theology that's got a hole in it and just cut out something from the message and patch up the hole in our theology let's just get rid of the whole Theology and people have become very very good false seamstresses and tailor with the message they don't ever want to relinquish their prior ideas they don't ever want to start over with the theology they just keep plugging holes and what is it when you take a step back that's mismatched that's not the Garment of righteousness that's not the word that brother brand hoped to dress the bride in that's your Patchwork of your prior Pentecostalism with a few Badges of the message when he said don't let any smut come on this message he gave you a clean garment and it ought not to be spotted with humanism truth yes sir this applies not just to that spiritual truth but also to our outward appearance I'm saying this forcefully to you tonight this w a Wednesday night crowd that I believe can form this fabric of faith for advancement in these things that if if you if we're on the same page together tonight as a family that the outward appearance matters it's something to deeply consider yes sir then we can begin to more uh uh effectively teach our children and our young ladies and our men how to dress and how to act go listen in terms of a new garment old garment there's a lot there I'm leaving on the table for this but you don't take an old garment with a hole and use a perfectly good garment to patch up the whole you get rid of the old and you put on the new we're re-evaluating we're rethinking these things because God does not want us code switching from one language to another so so we can fit into the world just so that we can somehow signal with a patch I I I really do feel like there's certain things we can see one time sometimes and we've gotten to the place anymore where you can see the way someone's dressed like that's a message believer you say well how do you know because they're just right at the edge a girl in the world's not going to go to Great Links to look like that why contrive so much right they're they're going to say I don't have this isn't fashionable this isn't but there's a way that we can be tempted and I'm saying this very humbly to our young sisters and to all of us there's a way even as brothers there's a way that we want to get just code switch a little bit right with our holy drip I thought about preaching CrossFit he not the workout cult but having a fit for the fit for the cross right and you know anymore we got to the point where we got home in away jerseys hey and you want your city connect so you can be identified with your homies right we cannot be caught in that pattern I'm going to keep pushing on thank you for your patience Zechariah 3: 1-5 Joshua the high priest standing is this great image and symbol of one that would come the high priest he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the Lord and Satan standing at his right hand to resist him now notice through this resistance and the Lord said unto Satan the Lord rebuke thee Oh s even the Lord that hath chosen Jerusalem rebuked thee is not this a brand plucked out of the fire now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments and stood before the angel now I want you to catch this image he has these filthy garments what we see just before this is Satan has been resisting him and his garments are filthy God rebukes him and he answered and spake unto those that stood before him saying take away weigh the filthy garments from him this isn't Spot Treatment let's just try some Tide on this he says take away the filthy garments from them and unto him he said behold I've caused thine iniquity to pass from thee and I will clothe thee with change of reignment thank God that in the the things that even sometimes our spiritual our physical dresss is a type of as Divine Healing is a type of a new body and our spiritual dress to be spotless and without blemishes testifying that one day even this spotted flesh is going to be changed into its glorious image I'm glad that he's not going to take this 5' 10 and a half no to take this Frame that I am now that's balding and getting weaker by the day and he's not just going to say you get to live forever I'm going to look like this yeah you're going to live forever you know what a lying vanity it's the mirror I look at right I don't I don't like to see myself that way it's a vanity right and and so there's something in my heart that rejoices that I'm going to get a new body and here the the high priest wasn't just stripped down and they did a wash cycle on his Remnant it was a change of clothing right and I said let them set a fire Fair miter upon his head so they set a fair miter upon his head and clothed him with garments new garments clean and the angel of the Lord stood by this is what God's wanting to do not just spiritually but he's wanting us to take some sort of approach to this naturally I realize that with any principle of God there's a way that we can take it so literal to where in our enthusiasm we just all donate our clothes to Goodwill tomorrow and make them a lot of money and we find those who can sew and we all sew ourselves uniforms right maze in blue uniforms and we all dress the part right or Pure White that maybe that'd be neutral white and we all going to we and we're all going to have a uniform that way we don't have to worry about anything we don't have to try to figure out the mind of God we don't have to figure out what's holy what's not holy we come with some sort of forced structure that we operate within and maybe in a more realistic thing is like well anything I own before I begin to serve the Lord I got to throw out and burn oh maybe that's not the case but maybe it is with our entertainments with the way that we treat one another with the way that we dress the way that we act some of the things that we indulged in God is still doing a work of sanctification amen we constantly stopping and re-evaluating as a family there's things that we didn't allow for a long time then there's things that we allow our children to participate in it could be Sports it could be video games it could be certain entertainments but we always have Liberty as Christians to stop and re-evaluate and say Lord am I still navigating this with Integrity for the best for my family in a way that pleases you and sometimes what we need is not a wash cycle we need new clothes in the spirit spiritual principle also stands for the very literal truth that God cares about the way you look and the way you dress I won't be able to get to uh Daniel chapter 3 tonight but I do want to finish with my text at least John chapter 19 we'll just start with verse 20 we'll just go to verse 23 then the soldiers when they had crucified Jesus I read in the beginning where they wanted to place this sign where it says the king of the Jews in every language signpost here he is hanging between two malactor and they strip him naked so there's no way to identify him as royalty there's no way anybody would be confused that the literal King of the Jews is hanging on the cross but guess what he was the literal and spiritual King of the Jews he had the lineage of Jo all the way back to David on both sides he had the Royal right he had the uh the legal right he was the king of the Jews and they took his garments they wanted to convey that he had been stripped of what he had worn they took His Garment and made four parts to every Soldier apart and also his coat now please just focus with me let tell you right now so you don't have to look it's 8:24 I got started around there and so I think we could just hold together for just a little bit longer they took four parts and gave to each Soldier and also his coat now the coat was without seam woven from the top throughout that's a real peculiar I mean you're kind of thanks John you know I really wondered you know just exactly how the his robe was made but it means something the fact that it's telling us that it was a coat without seam woven from the top throughout is signaling something to us that the Garment that Christ wore had some meaning to it that even in the way that it would have fit him and the way that it was without seam from the top throughout signified something and it's literal construction what it was made out of and how did he wore it stood for something says in Luke Chapter 8:3 speaking of these different ones that were with them Joanna the wife of chuah Herod Stewart and Susanna and many others which ministered unto him of their substance they would they they labored they gave him things they provided for him he who had no home or Earthly place to lay his head was relying upon these ministries of other people and perhaps one of these women had swed him a a a nice coat and it wasn't just anything put together and patched together in Exodus 28: 32 uh maybe we could go to 34 and there shall be a hole in the top of the priest's garment his robe you read in verses the prior verses just how this would have fit upon him in the midst thereof it shall have a a binding of woven work round about the ho of it as if it were the hole of a harbon that it be not rent this Garment of the high priest this gar of priest was not to be torn not to be easily torn so they didn't piece it together the whole thing needed to be woven that's why when the high priest rent his garments he was so mad at Christ he defiled his Priestly garments he did something he's so worried about the law being observed by Christ that he defames and blasphemes the priesthood by renting his own garments that it be not written beneath upon the him Thou shalt make pomegranates of blue and of purple and of scarlet roundout the hymn thereof and bells of gold between them round about and a golden Bell and pomegranate and a golden Bell on a pomegranate upon the Hemm of the robe roundabout such intricate detail about the high priest notice again just how much detail God gave to certain things in the temple in the house of Lord the way people were to dress how that God is expressing something spiritual about all these things Something That Matters to him so he just didn't say uh high priest just make sure it's white as white as you can get it it doesn't matter cream off-white doesn't matter just something along those lines just get close God's like this isn't Horseshoes and Hand Grenades close isn't good right right this isn't a cornhole we just want to be on the board he's like you got to hit the mark th this is this is something you want need to be precise so he gives very precise uh descriptions and Christ now is wearing a coat that's in the very IM image of that of a high priest without seam he is now fulfilling even in what he's wearing something that would signify and show that he's wearing this garment this coat without seam that couldn't be easily rent and I want you to catch this and I'm going to I'm going to say it if I could say it this way that Christ was wearing this robe which was in the image and to the specifications of that which the high priest would wear and because he wore this robe that would reach down to have these hymns God could use it in a particular way Mark 6:56 and withersoever he entered into Villages or cities or or country they laid the sick in the streets and besought him that they might touch if it were but the border of His Garment and as many as touched him were made whole could you imagine if Jesus was wearing wind shorts that day I know that's funny to think that I'm making a point by it though words God gives this requirement that a high priest would have this garment that would reach down to this hymn and because he wore what would been this common garment something maybe everyone would have a coat but because this coat me certain specifications because this coat was at the length that it was there was people who could Reach Out And Touch the Hem of His Garment and be made whole and what he was wearing became a point of contact the fact that they identified even themselves with just the Hem of His Garment what he wore became a point point of contact in a Dynamo the Dynamo that could use Faith could it not be the same today that by the way that you dress sisters your dress can become a point of contact for somebody else's Faith men dressing in a way that's becoming of Godly men men professing godliness that it could be a point of contact in Matthew 9: 20 and 21 Behold a woman which was diseased with an issue of blood 12 years came behind him and Touch the Hem of His Garment for she said within herself if I may but touch His Garment I shall be whole Brothers you could come to your instruments we'll end here and in Luke it says and she came behind him and touched the border of His Garment and immediately her issue of blood staunched from touching his clothing clothing that the Bible wants us to know is without seam woven from the top throughout he was our high priest who could be touched he wore those in a way to where though there was some uh difference in humility and there wasn't just this outright taking a hold of him but he was made he dressed way that was accessible for these Meek and these sick and these broken to reach out and touch and by faith be healed and when we're counseled in Leo DEA to buy gold tried in the fire that we may be rich and to buy from him white rment that we may be clothed and that the shame of our nakedness not appear there's a very literal physical application of this in our lives I allude to this quite often in speaking on these things that we could sit down and try to figure this out as a church what we're allowed to wear and what we're not allowed to wear but I believe saying that there is a dress code that God has a dress code hopefully will remove the stigma that's often said well that's just a Clos line religion these aren't clothes on a line these are clothes on a bride this isn't a clothline religion this is a this is a word which is a which is a language and there's a way that we are to dress ourselves in the word and we can't F our elves into thinking that the very bride who's sitting still long enough to be dressed in the garments of his righteous spiritually has no time to get it right in the flesh has no time to dress holy has no time to abstain from the things of the world listen we don't have the time to mess around we better slow down and get it right cuz we don't have time to make a mistake sir to buy from him reignment that we might be clothed and if God could [Music] take brother Paul what's a brother is it brother George from greater Vision the one that writes all the those songs he wrote If God could take just this uncommon garment if he could take if God could just use a coat a literal coat is God wanting to use us literally is God want to use the way we dress the way that we act and I'm being very specific a dress code sit down as fathers of your family sit down as husband and wife sit down as Mom sit down as individuals and whatever and say Lord I want to dress according to your word I want to I want to through the what I actually wear I want it to be a language that speaks Holiness and the world may not understand it but maybe there's somebody that says wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute what there there's a language being conveyed here that's right that's right and maybe they'll hear it in their own language maybe God will speak to them it might be tongues to a lot of people but God maybe the way God's wanting us to dress is for a great purpose like it was with Christ the Bible says that we ought to pull people out of the fire hating even the Garment spotted by the flesh the Garment hating even the Garment spotted by the flesh God help us to even desire that our garments and what we wear would please the Lord let's stand to our feet this evening I want to thank you for your patience so patient to hear these things left left a lot out but we'll get to it another time and it will be timely them then and thank you I know that there's a lot of force behind what I'm saying I'm very very under great conviction that these things are necessary for us to uh reaffirm I know this isn't anything new for us but just to reaffirm that Holiness counts it matters amen and that when we come to a Sunday morning service and all the seats are full that we begin to deal with things there's going to be people that need to hear truth sometimes for the first time sometimes it's for the first time they're hearing it well they've heard that preach now they're finally hearing it for the first time if we could bow our heads in a word of prayer our gracious Heavenly Father lord it's a great privilege to be gathered into your presence once again this evening and Lord I do count it a privilege to minister to such wonderful people with this appetite for the word and Lord I I I know that maybe all of us were hoping to hear somebody else preach tonight and but I trust that through everything they heard from the same God that could use any other vessel and that what was shared is pertinent it could be made clear to them that they could understand just just how your heart is for them that these requirements that the world might look at as merely forced modesty and a dress code of of man but that the the origin of this language the origin of these signs the origin of this is a deep work that you're doing within our souls and that this is experience that is so elusive that we can't quite explain that we can't describe cuz somehow be made flesh in the way that we live and that there could be a swapping out of dress swapping out of habits to be more like you that though we are found and fashion as a man we can display a humility and obedience to you and the whole world isn't going to see it but Lord there's those that need to hear these voices of lived lives thundering out by conduct and dress code and I'm praying for the people tonight this Wednesday night crowd the ones that are built to handle this kind of teaching and I pray that they'll be benefited by it bless us now father as our service is soon dismissed give us the courage we need for the day tomorrow
