TRANSCRIPT
========================================
ruth chapter one i'm gonna just read verse six ruth chapter one verse six i'd like to make a few comments at the outset about this particular verse and then get through um verses three to 14 today though there's um maybe some time and attention that could be spent more on these verses but i feel like we could cover some ground with just how deliberate we've been through the first uh three verses or two verses of this book but let's just look at verse six here in our text ruth chapter one verse six then she this is speaking of naomi arose with her daughters-in-law that she might return from the country of moab for she had heard in the country of moab how that the lord had visited his people in giving them bread this is what motivates her out of this land of moab this message that says god has visited her people and is giving them bread god bless you you could be seated this evening i'd like you to take notice in our for our title we've been we begin in this thought on being hungry and our burden was just looking at how that god has provided the bride a a feast in this time it's a spiritual feast that is what we are feeding on that's given us strength to rise above the laodicean condition ultimately it's those things that we're feeding on that's going to give us power to see the translation of our bodies and these things are connected with the open of the word it's connected with the third pull and these different things and it transitioned from being fed and hungry to this con this thought of which we're introduced to is the living bread of life as brother branham calls it in the rapture looking at the subject of the bread of life and started examining how ruth came out of moab into bethlehem and the scripture says and when they were come to bethlehem they naomi and ruth came at the harvest time so we're just looking at this thought of come to bethlehem and in looking at that we just started and went back and started with root chap ruth chapter one and started in verse one and for a few services we were examining very closely in verses one and verses two uh some of the particulars of elimelech's family and the meanings of their name and some of the foreshadowing some of the symbolism and representation and then the last three services looking at moab and the moabite condition of those different things and i could have called that the condition and and i just may be pondering this in hindsight we could have been looking at specifically maybe as a subtitle the condition and as we uh move into this part here may take just a couple of services as of in looking at the opposition so that we're looking at the bread of life that is made available to the bride that she's to feed on so we are come to bethlehem and there's these different beautiful things that are transpiring for us as the bride and there's a condition that this living bread of life is calling us out of and what i want us to begin to identify is now there's an opposition and we've already looked at it in some ways in looking at how there's a collision with moab before israel got to the promised land and how we have this collision with moab before we come into the millennium so we've been identifying it a little bit already but i'm wanting you to think about this in terms of the opposition there's something that's withstanding you there's an attitude there's a condition there's all sorts of ways that we could express it that's trying to oppose you and keep you from enjoying your spiritual feast so does that make sense to you this evening is maybe just a little bit of a recap and to where we are right now so just want to maybe just use a few terminologies here before we get uh go take a step further we're looking at moab brother branham has identified moab as the formal church it's a lukewarm condition we've identified it as a denominational spirit that does not necessarily follow the ink or place with headquarters with the dot org but it's a spirit a denominational spirit it is uh it is a spirit that can be on an individual that takes comfort in knowing that there's a strict structure or organization uh it is something that can be very fundamental but yet it's not yet in the real channel of the word of god it might have technical truth but yet it's not really in the spirit or the revelation of it there's a lot of different ways that that spirit and condition of moab is identified and we looked at how that there was a system that was set up by impersonation through balaam through balak in moab that bound the people and it was that structure in that system and the whole way that they were operating that rose up to try to keep israel from coming into the promised land so how that's relevant to us is moab is the condition that ruth comes out of we could look at it it was israel's coming out and they meet moab and how elimelech and naomi went into moab and there's a lot of different ways that that's instructive to us and great truths that can be typed in this story but where we see the strongest representation and the most direct message to us as we begin to like wait a minute ruth was a moabite and she has to be brought out of moab in order to be married to boaz then we can immediately begin to identify more particularly with her and say so then what that moabite condition and the things that she would have believed and been bound by and thought was so wonderful it's that circumstance or condition that ruth comes out of therefore it's relevant to our hidden mystery it's relevant to the hidden mystery that we can find in the book of ruth that when you catch it it'll bring you close to god and i think it's worth it for us to take time to examine these things in detail and i want to point this out in verse 6 at the beginning at the outset that by the time you get to verse 6 there's a lot of things happen ten years have been covered rather quickly through the first five verses and elimelech and naomi and their two sons having been in moab left bethlehem judah and gone into moab because of a famine in israel and in particular bethlehem judah her husband having died her two sons died it says she arose the onomia is now arising with her daughter-in-laws so there seem to be animated and active with her that she naomi might return she's going to leave the country of moab and this is what spurs her on she's there she's living her life she's trying to get by she's dealing with her grief and her pain but she hears something for she had heard in the country of moab so a message got to her where she was the message got to naomi and her daughter-in-law's there in the country of moab and this was the message that the lord had visited his people this is a visitation of the lord if we looked at the the circumstances of how elimelech left israel because of a famine god withdrew his blessings from israel because of their disobedience but now god had returned god's presence is back amongst them vindicated with signs and wonders vindicated with his presence among his people and so the lord had visited his people and now in particular in giving them bread and this is why naomi then is quickened to go back whatever her justifications and reasons a decade earlier had been regardless of whatever suffering she had endured and whatever connection she might have felt to moab there was a message that caught her attention that uprooted her out of moab and set her sights on israel to go back to where she knew she belonged now that's a remarkable way to express it for naomi but this is what begins ruth's transformation this is the message that god had visited his people and giving them bread this begins ruth's exodus out of moab now when this message comes and it begins to animate the family and that naomi's inspired and ruth is going to begin to go out and even we'll see the orpha as well when this happens this i want you to look at it not so much as naomi but this is ruth's story it's called the book of roof it's not the the book of elimelech and his failures but it's the book of ruth and so she is going to be she's the central figure and so god sends a message and i want you to ponder this because i'd like to i'm i kind of have this vision in mind of coming to this point and i want to be very very impactful when we get to it later on that here's ruth having no idea really what's happening she she doesn't hear this message like oh god the lord has visited his people and given him bread you know that sounds a lot like the messiah or it sounds like this and it sounds like that and you know that moab represents this and we're the product of incest and this and that and she starts using all these types and says i've been waiting for this invitation all my life don't you know that israel's promise to messiah this is a great type of the messiah coming there's probably a kinsmen redeemer there that i can show in type about the bride she has no idea what's going on she there's just something that begins to transpire and happen and as the story unfolds i believe that we could see ourselves even where we are today and begin to realize that when we heard the message of the hour to quote a lot of message preachers come on somebody think about it how that when we were in when we heard the message we were just like this is awesome but just think how much more awesomer it became right although this is good we're going to go to israel and get some bread change of scenery this is nice or this is much better than the denomination i was in or this is much better than the sinful condition i was in but as this message began to unfold you found out wait a minute this is just not another denomination this just isn't another way to worship christ this isn't pentecost plus or something with more truth this is it and it's a it's a progression and unfolding that transpires for us and so his roof is coming out of moab this is her exodus this is the beginning of her transformation now let's look at verse three and i want to begin to read in in injecting some statements from brother branham in here to amplify these these verses so it says analimolex so i well let's i can just read these very quickly now came to pass in the days when the judges ruled that there was a famine in the land this is verse one and a certain man of bethlehem judah went to sojourn in the country of moab he and his wife and his two sons and the name of the man was elimelech in the name of his wife naomi in the name of his two sons mohan and kilian efferties of bethlehem judah and we looked at those in a few services and then we focused on this statement through three services or so and they came into the country of moab and continued there so those are the prior uh six services or so or five services that we spent on this now verse three and the limit naomi's husband died and she naomi was left and her two sons now this is the the first instance that we have of describing their life in moab and it's very dramatic that it we come to this because the book of ruth opens with a famine and then immediately a funeral it's a famine that it opens with and it opens with the funeral now remember that's how it opens but remember how it ends with a wedding and a conception and a birth so it begins with the funeral a famine and a funeral it says elimelech dies and so naomi's there with her two sons and this death we need to catch how that it's an untimely death that this was not a death of old age and this is not him dying of natural causes but he left israel this is not just some wild assumption and you can go into some of the historians the caudis or even josephus and they amplify this in a way to emphasize that this the text is telling us that elimelech left because he need he wanted to secure his life he wanted to have better provision he wanted to make a better uh status for himself and for his wife and his two sons and so eliminate leaves israel which we could say even david would refer to it as the land of the living not just the realm of mortals but israel that's the land of the living that's where life is that's where the promise is he lives it leaves israel to save his life only to perish probably very soon after getting there and then so there's my honey we're this we're just coming here for a little while and this will be good and our boys will find some nourishment maybe i could get a job for a while we could save up some money when the time's right we can go back and redeem our property there and buy it back at the time of the jubilee or different things maybe they thought there was a way that it could be restored to him but he gets there and very soon probably very soon he dies and we can say this is probably very soon because the way that the scripture is written um josephus says they were probably only there 10 years total the way that it's written suggests that the boys were married and that they'd only been there 10 years before they died but as this happens very suddenly elimelech could have never probably never imagined what awaited him when he got there he would have never thought that yeah we're going to make this big move i'm going to get there i'm going to pass away he could have never thought and i want you to ponder this what awaited his family because this wasn't in his mind elimelech is not going there to totally repudiate and reject the law to reject god to reject um uh the the moses and to reject the things that he had been given reject the coming of the messiah he was going there kind of as a way to save himself and and i imagine and this is just me uh thinking this that he would have taught his sons now we're just here for a season but when it's time for you to marry we'll go back and find daughters of bethlehem judah and that's who you'll marry you'll marry daughters of israel and he would have taught him the things look while we're here you need to be careful we need to watch out for this and watch out for that but he should have had a little bit more wisdom before he went because he didn't he didn't have the foresight of the vision to think well what would happen if he passed away he could have never imagined that his sons would have married uh moabites and that they would have had an untimely death themselves brother branham i identifies this in the sermon why little bethlehem and i hope that you can pick up on uh the way that he begins to zero in on some of these things it's just beautiful we find out that years later after naomi had left the country and gone over to sojourn with the moabites and then he's gonna he's gonna use naomi kind of as a central figure not necessarily a limoulek but it becomes naomi once he's gone and we can say that she certainly represents elimelech's decision and family he says and when they had evilly mistreated her i was to where he says it's the moabites and she had gotten out of fellowship with the rest of the believers we know as a limelight that made the decision to move with his wife but now we see that naomi is out of fellowship with the rest of the believers she's being evilly mistreated by these these people that she's associated with and she associated herself in a backslidden condition so there's this representation in the type of moab represents a backslidden condition naomi finds herself in that in another land among another people he says and otherwise now he's maybe gonna look at it this way and this is the part i really want you to catch on because it's going to become critical to looking at these other verses she had left the true believing church to go out into the world for a little while now notice the the the parameters for this because it i think it becomes a very clear warning to us to be careful of what gets our attention what moves upon us or what kind of establishes the structure that we want to exist within she went left the true believing church to go out into the world for a little while we're just gonna go for a little bit to join some social church this is one of the biggest dangers to us you say oh well not in the message maybe even more so in the message that we get so comfortable in the fact that the fundamentals there and the doctrine's there and this is mainstream message and it's not in this in this uh fringe movement here and not in this kingdom over here or not with this false doctrine over there we get kind of comfortable in the fundamentals of quote unquote mainstream message but we can get into a social the social mechanics and the social dynamics of mainstream message and he says to join some social church who just who believed in just anything would be all right there's some sort of comfort that they're taking in their fundamentals in there she lost her husband now he's making he's identifying this that it's in that uh in this process and this unfolding that she lost her husband and it don't have to be every time in physical death so it tells us that it's not so much well if you get out of this and you become more social and you lose your connection with the things of god and you're not in that channel of a true believing uh individual in the right kind of atmosphere that you're going to physically die but he says you might lose him in a spiritual death or lose your wife and what a spiritual death so spiritual death would be the worst consequence and this is what he's warning us about so he says better stay on good grounds think about that better stay on good grounds and this is a very this is foreshadowing because he's saying that elimelech and naomi made their mistake when they left good ground and got on background and it was in that bad ground that elimelech dies naomi's now in a person you know out of fellowship with the rest of the believers associate herself in a backslidden condition and he's saying the death of elimelech is a type of spiritual death and he says you better stay on good grounds now this foreshadows something that begins to happen and transpire in the book of ruth because what begins to get really pronounced when ruth comes back into bethlehem and she happens in what a field and she finds yourself in the good ground that that that elimelech had left and so the ground the place where you settled where you're feeding where you're existing is important to spiritual vitality spiritual life and spiritual strength we cannot fool ourselves into thinking that we can be strengthened in the inner man and strengthen spiritually if we just are out there on bad ground and since it's wednesday night let's pat ourselves on the back we can't fool ourselves into thinking that we can stay out of church and grow in christ bill graham said it's impossible he said you can't be a christian and stay at home anybody familiar with that should i start bringing my laptop up here so we can just pull it up real quick i that says he said you can't do it oh i'm gonna step forward here a little bit i just kind of got something just really struck me in my mind that i've been pondering so he says you had better stay where you know you were covered by the blood you better stay where you know the word is preached you better stay where you know the presence of god is you better stay where you know you are walking in the light and the blood of jesus christ is cleansing us from unrighteousness in that isn't that the kind of assurance that we want especially in a time like this in an age like this you better you had better stay where you know you're covered by the blood and this is let this impact you tonight let it really really uh challenge you as an individual but more importantly challenge us as a church challenge us as a church as we're as god is forming an identity and shaping us as a body of believers and giving us a vision as a family of what we're going to stand for what we're going to look like even what we're going to present to those that we come in contact with in witness to are we just wanting to have a particular structure that engages people in a social way or do we want to have an atmosphere where people know they're covered by the blood he says regardless of what the rest of them looks like how big they are how fine of spires they have on their churches or how big the bells ring this is hitness right where it counts when we have become the instagram generation and we become those who are enamored with social media and we're constantly checking the news and the and the tweets and all these different things and we need to be informed we want to know what everyone is saying and we have all these filters and ideals and ideas and all these things are trying to be positioned and presented in such a way to where it's dramatic and it's awesome and it's so huge and it's so great and we have to realize that we have this part of us in ourselves that even in sincerity we want to be able we want to be a part of something big we want to be a part of something great we don't want to have any shame when we invite people to church we don't want to be stigmatized as being backwards or even backwoods and especially in this day and age i don't want to be old-fashioned and i don't want to be identified with this and i don't want to be identified with that and sometimes we feel like if the spire can be big enough and everything can be large enough and the bell can ring beautifully and it really really looks big then i can somehow hide within that but don't be fooled it's not how big it is it's whether or not the blood is there he says that again you better stay where the blood covers the sins of the people he says you might lose one another and he says and above all you might lose the lord jesus and be barred out so it's being barred out being cut out it starts to come into view there so these things when he says you better stay where you know you're covered by the blood these things cause us to examine ourselves and ought to cause us to examine ourselves even as a church so continuing now verse four as she is left with her two sons so this verses and they this is the two sons hollande and killian they took them wives of the women of moab i was going to take some time just identifying the scripture some of the prophecies concerning the women of moab the consequences for mary and them but i realize i feel like the point was has already been driven home on those things already so they married these women and the name of the one was orpah that was killian's wife and the name of the other ruth that was uh muhan's wife and they dwelled there about 10 years this is where we kind of get the duration of how long it would have been as i said before limelight could have never imagined what awaited him when he got there and then also what awaited his family we had never considered that he would have died and then that his sons would marry strange wives brother banham points this out kind of these characteristics things to look at as oprah orpah and ruth are introduced he says in the message redeemer redemption while they were over there the two sons grew up and married two girls one of them named orpah and one of them named ruth this is this is really this is exciting stuff and the two beautiful pictures of the churches or a beautiful picture of two churches because you're going to separate these things out and naomi and maybe three we could say three different churches but one just relating to the gentiles naomi a perfect picture of the orthodox church brother graham identifies the jewish orthodox church or she represents the jews naomi a perfect picture of the jews orthodox church he says orpah catch this a picture of the lukewarm gentile church now she's a picture of the lukewarm gentile church where do we identify that in the scripture revelations chapter 3 verse 17 this is laodicea so now we are actually beginning to see that there's a lot contained in in the book of ruth there's a lot more to it than well ruth kind of represents this gentile woman that mary's boat has and therefore we have the gentile bride and we have christ represented in this love story so much more to it in that orpa now represents the lukewarm gentile church the culmination of seven church ages in that it is represented in the laodicean condition so orp is a picture of the lukewarm gentile church and ruth a picture of a bride so moab which orpah was a moabitus she is she's the product of moab she's the culmination of a moab condition being raised as a mobile even marrying a bachelor a husband who dies and an orphan now she's a representation of laodicea the lukewarm gentile church that's a product of moa but here's ruth now she has a picture of a bride he says such a beautiful way as god has laid all of his word by inspiration could you say amen to that it's just beautiful how god has laid these things out by inspiration that in one verse we can see naomi who represents the jews we see orpah who represents laodicea of the lukewarm gentile church but then ruth is going to represent the bride who is called out of not only moab but really called out of an orpah condition she's called out of a lukewarm condition so there might have been some camaraderie that they had and some symmetry in their own lives and well we married brothers and they both died and and there might have been something that they identified and had in common and maybe we could say that ruth at one time was very closely in sync with orpah but things are going to change i'm inspired tonight i i i just feel so so free in my spirit and verse five and mohan and killian died also both of them so these are the women that they married muhammad married ruth achillian marries orpah and the both of them die now this is we're just in verse five we've had some verses that are kind of setting things up and then we get into the real action and well now that we're in mobile limelight dies and well okay now we finally have these two boys getting married this is the chance for naomi to get back under her feet again and what happens these two guys die so now we have three widows we have three funerals three widows and says and the women woman was left of her two sons and her husband meaning they had died and they passed away verse six then she arose in this time of sorrow and sadness and death and this widowed condition the death of her first husband the death of ruth and orpah's first husband says she arose with her daughter-in-laws that she might return from the country of moab for she had heard remember the message came heard in the country of moab how that the lord had visited his people and giving them bread christ the word visiting the people making himself known drawing people back to the promised land bringing them to the place to be positionally placed into such a beautiful picture being represented now verse seven wherefore she went forth out of the place where she was this is just describing that she's making advancement now she's leaving where she lived in moab and she's reversing course that she took with her husband and she's going back and as she does says and her two daughter-in-laws her two daughters-in-law with her and they went on the way to return unto the land of judah now we could somehow conceptualize this in our minds and as we showed it on the map before how they reversed the exodus and they went back to where they had left from went back to the place of the collision went right back to the place where israel had fallen in the feast of bel peor here they're back in mob but now the message comes and naomi's leaving and it's not just naomi by herself but she has orpah and she has ruth with her and they went on the way they're in a journey now they're leaving so there's some distance that's been traveled and i don't think that it necessarily matters just how far they went or how long it was but we need to understand that ruth and orpah start out and they're on their way to return unto the land of judah judah so they're making progress to it it's getting closer and let's not just think that there was a conversation that was had they're kind of texting each other in the family whatsapp and saying well hey i think i'm going to go back to judah and and they're both saying hey that sounds like a good idea maybe i'll join you this is not happening in some sort of stasis where they're all you know quiet sitting down talking about this over cheesesteak no they're moving they're advancing they're going forward and they're making progress towards this return so there's been some decision made by all three of them that yes let's go let's do this together and brother branham describes it this way and i think it was in um the why little bethlehem or i think that's the sermon it was in she returned back he makes a statement she returned back because there was no revival spirit in the city at the time so this is some awakening some discernment to recognize there's no revival here this is dead this is going nowhere this is the wilderness experience we just go in circles there's a place that i could be be fed there's a place where god has visited his people there's a revival taking place this place is stagnant this is sterile this is death this is dying so she returned because she recognized there was no revival where she was and so she was moved by a message to get into a place where there was revival this is where we can start to see the types uh begin to emerge as brother adam said orpah represents the lukewarm gentile church and ruth represents the bride here we can begin to wreck these types begin to emerge because orpah representing the lukewarm gentile church she's not personified she doesn't personify the unbeliever so much right the one that just rejects the word and won't believe it but she more personifies or represents the make-believer the one that says amen and the one that pretends to believe the one that impersonates and the one that seems to kind of be in activity in motion with the rest of the believers that's who she represents she is the type of the lukewarm christian she professes she she she begins she starts out she has a she has some sort of profession and this is the part i want you to recognize it says and they went out on the way to return unto the land of judah she begins and starts out in the journey back think about that how malachi chapter 4 verse 5 that the the spirit of elijah is going to come in an anointed prophet which we know to be william branham and he has a message to turn the hearts of the children back to the the fathers and we see that as a faith or revelation of those apostolic disciples and the apostles at the beginning of the church and so that's what the ministry of malachi 4 5 does is it turns our hearts back to a revelation of christ and so there's people that believe in elijah they believe in the elijah this day and they've left denominations they've left this and they've left that and they seem to have made some progress but if their hearts are never turned they've never benefited from the the purpose of his ministry if you don't have your heart turned to recognize jesus christ present today i'm talking about 2021 1963 i'm talking about today then have you returned are are you can you say i am a roof i am coming to this i'm on good ground i'm in the place that i ought to be i'm in this channel and so this is identifying how that you can start out even as orpah and they're walking you wouldn't be able to tell which was which you see three women you might know naomi maybe she looked a little bit older maybe we knew well that's the mother-in-law and there's the two daughters but which one's going to make it they both look the same they both have very similar testimonies and they're coming from the same the same condition and so now remember this about moab orpah and ruth are moabites and moab was the son of lot by his own daughter and this is where we already looked at it before that beautiful symmetry where we saw a man and his daughters and we saw even the death of a spouse and we saw these things and we just looked at them very quickly and we didn't get into a detail let's look at genesis chapter 19. to see how light that this type of lot and we can see more of the condition that's represented in moab and the character the condition and the character and if i could maybe put us back in the frame of mind of the opposition this is the condition and the character that ruth's called out of but since she's called out of it it becomes the condition and the character of what opposes her since she's since she's leaving it there's always this see when something begins to leave that the the character and the condition wants to kind of grab a hold of it and pull it back put it or just subjugate it put it down push it down and so it's very important to identify these i believe genesis chapter 19 we'll read verses 15 to 17 and then i want to skip to verse 26. and when the morning arose let me back up so this is when the two angels go into sodom and they're and they're going to try to get lot and his family out his wife and his two daughters and when the morning arose then the angels hasten lot saying arise think of this symmetry that how we've already just read that naomi arose in moab to leave and go now this is the message of this these angels to arise take thy wife and thy two daughters which are here let's thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city brother iran talk about how there is no revival spirit in the city we can see this symmetry now in genesis 19 and while he lingered the men laid a hold upon his hand and upon the hand of his wife and upon the hand of his two daughters yeah do we really need to leave he's kind of lingering a little bit but now these angels they lay hold and and the lord being merciful unto him and they brought him forth and set him without the city i actually just even it's striking me a little bit more different right now how that all all naomi had to hear was that there was a message and she's going but here the angel i'm the drag lot out of sodom hey this place is going to burn well it's fire's so bad and and now for the out of the love of abraham and for the types to to fit perfectly the angels have to lay their hands upon them and drag them out of sodom not a really good testimony it's like well so why are you here yeah yeah my husband drags me here hey i'm just here because of this guy it's not a very good testimony they say oh okay well hello brother lautner sister sister nita need a lot and verse 17 and it came to pass when they had brought them forth abroad then he said this is the message to him escape for thy life look not behind thee neither stay thou in all the plain escape to the mountains lest thou be consumed as a paradox here because they were told to not stay in the plane but escape to the mountain lot gets so far and says i don't think i can make it to the mountain here and so or i believe it was and there's an exception made but notice it says escape for the life look not behind thee they had to be dragged out of sodom rescued from a sinking ship taken out of a place that's judged where there's no spirit removing it's it's a it's in shambles it's a terrible condition there's great perverseness ways that we could look at sodom and gomorrah which is what laodicea it's absolutely legal to see in condition they're being kind of dragged out can they make it can they exceed we find out that they never do really but then it says look not behind me now let's skip to verse 26 but his wife looked back from behind him and she became a pillar of salt so here is a man and his wife and two daughters that are leaving sodom and as they leave one of the spouses dies and the man is left with his two daughters and why don't we see that whenever elimelech and naomi went into moab with the two sons one of the spouses dies and naomi's left with her two sons and it shows this almost mirror image and this is the beginning and i think this is important this is the beginning of moab because it's one of these daughters that brings forth moab and sets the character in the condition that one day in the future orpah and ruth are going to be leaving and so we catch we go back into the scripture and say wait a minute look at genesis 19. look at this this is the genesis of mob this is the character of moab and the character of moab is to have to be dragged out of sodom and be told whatever you do don't go back whatever you do don't go back but there was something in the nature of lot's wife that looked back there was something even the nature of lot and i didn't put it in here i'm saying who didn't continue all the way to the mountains but stopped in the plains there was something in that character so this tells us that the moab condition is to only go so far be right up next to the borderline of the promised land the conditional mob is to stay right there and because they don't enter in because they're not ordained to it they stand there as a barrier in a block for the the true believer to come and do a collision with and so that believer's got to go through moab to get to the promised land but their character and their condition gets real clingy and is going to be the opposition so now you see ruth this helps us understand it even better ruth is there seemingly lukewarm gentile unbeliever moabitus she's going to leave orpa's going to leave with her but the character of moab is to go back the character that was birthed into that family we see it in the very beginning they have to be dragged out but they only go so far they end up going right back i feel like we could stop right there don't don't say man too loud or too much affirmation in that moment can make give me a little bit of a conflict that's right brother aaron you certainly can i say we could and we've heard from god you know a 40-minute sermon said absolutely we've heard from god that's plain that's direct and you begin to take it as it was in the days of lot as it was in the days of lot as it was in the condition of moab as it was in the beginning in genesis in the birth of a moabitess condition of the man moab and all that that represents so shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed so shall it be when the living bread of life comes forth to call out a bride there's gonna be this opposition you find that brother brandon begins to identify certain characteristics and maybe we'll we'll hold off a little bit to amplify it later certain characteristics in the days of lot that's represented in lot's wife and this is exactly what is is being portrayed in the book of ruth verse eight naomi said under two daughters-in-law now they've started out together they're in this journey they're getting so far but now this is very interesting because now naomi is going to turn to them and instead of saying just wait till you see the heels of home just wait till you see how beautiful our ranch was and how green the hills were and right now how golden it's going to be and oh it's so hot and muggy here in moab but man once you get over there the elevations just change just a little bit it's going to be gorgeous going to be beautiful a little bit closer to the the mediterranean and she's not trying to sell them on where they're going now listen it's a dry heat it gets a little hot but it's a dry heat no there's no salesmanship here the only senator two daughter-in-laws go return each to her mother's house as they're leaving she says hey you know what you guys should probably stay here you probably you probably shouldn't go and then i want you to kind of catch naomi's language here the lord deal kindly with you as you have dealt with the dead and with me the lord grant you that you may find rest each of you in the household of her husband wanting them to find a husband again in relationship and and children and protection and provision then she kissed them and they lifted up their voice and wept and she told him go ahead and go back now i've been pondering this for weeks now and i think it just it just merits just the statement notice the nature of naomi that she knows she's got to go back because she's heard a message and she begins to recognize that maybe ruth and orpah would have reason or cause to remain in moab and instead of her putting pressure on them and twisting their arms and dangling them over hell and calling them serpent seed if you don't go she says hey if it's in your heart why don't you stay maybe you could find a husband here in moab and maybe you can settle down and maybe you can be comfort and maybe you can find rest notice that and naomi there's no judgment in her attitude towards orpah and her attitude towards ruth there's no condemnation in her words but she actually can express kindness and encouragement and we know where the story goes it's not like all of a sudden i'm gonna go tada orp it turned around you're like what we know that's what's coming so i want you to realize that naomi doesn't bash her oh i i knew you i knew you couldn't follow and naomi's the one that comes up with she's out left us she went out promised me because she was never part of us isn't that what we always say when someone leaves the church well they left but they never were part of us yeah that's why you called them brother that's why you always hung out with him that's why you compliment them that's why you said so glad you're here and god brought you here and that's why you had all sorts of affinity and connections but all of a sudden when they leave it's like well they never really were part of this and then the ministry of truth takes over and you have to do revisionist history right you have to go back and change everything so everybody could do double think that's that's right they never were part of us though they were part of us they never were part of us but nobody doesn't fall for that let's never have that attitude as a church if god sends somebody amongst us and they fellowship with us for a while if they get offended we should repent we should say i'm sorry if it's the word that offends them we don't we can't apologize for the word but we can always humble ourselves and if god would call someone to another place to go to church if god would call someone to a greater ministry god would call them to do something else we ought to give them our blessing say god bless you and let them know hey if it doesn't work out you can always come back don't shut doors and that's what naomi was able to do with orpah she had such an attitude in this situation it wasn't judgment it wasn't condemnation but it was just if it's in your heart you can go back god help us god help us out in verse 10 and they said unto her now this is kind of the the response now from these two daughters surely we'll return with thee unto thy people oh she kind of did a little check hey let's just check ourselves right here before we go any further do you really want to go this is i i want you to know that you have husbands and you have a chance here in moab and there there's ways that you can prosper and thrive where you are now are you sure you want to come with me and so they said yeah we want to go then naomi takes it a step further and naomi said turn again my daughters why will you go with me are there yet any more sons in my womb that they may be your husbands now she started to really look at it from a logical perspective like why are you staying close to my side do you think you're gonna be able to marry another one of my sons and redeem their names of the ones that are dead turn again my daughters go your way for i am too old to have a husband i can't get married and have children and if i should say i have hope if i should have a husband also tonight and should also bear sons nine months later have twin boys would you wait for them till they're grown would you wait 16 17 20 years until they're grown and then marry would you stay for them from having husbands would you keep yourselves for these next two decades and you yourselves not getting married name my daughters saying think about it think about this logically for grieve with me much for your sakes that the handle lord is gone out against me now this is this is very interesting dynamics and i i haven't felt to amplify it any further than this what's obvious and on the surface is this is just naomi kind of giving them a little bit of pushback just saying are you sure you want to do this now what does this become uh to naom to ruth and orpah a test you've left and you say you've been challenged well no we want to do this and you're going to continue but now she kind of gets a little bit more forceful and it's almost as if naomi is trying to discourage them to bring up thoughts in their mind and cause them to rationalize and think about these different things wow are you sure you want to do this and we can see that this template exists in the scripture that when everyone was showing up well man this jesus of nazareth this guy can feed us for days this is where we want to be this is awesome he gets to speak in a little bit of way that's kind of controversial people like what kind of chill out jesus this is this is too weird this is getting this that escalated quickly you know one day we're eating bread now you want us to eat your flesh woohoo come on now let's slow it down a little bit tap the brakes and she's like oh that bothers you and he aggravates a little bit more and it becomes something that kind of creates a little bit of a stigma a little bit of activation what do you do it caused many to walk away and brother branham actually teaches us that sometimes things are sta said in such a way to stumble the people to cause them to go away to stumble to go out and wonder and ponder things yes god does that where he'll actually allow things to be said and done to challenge you to see if that's enough to shake you he allows things to happen he actually uses a statement and i realize i'm paraphrasing a little bit where he says that jesus says go ye therefore in all the world and baptize the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost and that was the word but it became a ladder that they used to walk right out of the word why would he say it in such a way that would cause people to walk out of the word just the way that god does things and so we hear we see naomi kind of just turning and pushing a little bit are you sure you want to do this and these things happen in our lives things come up you sure you want to do this you sure this is what's right you sure this is what you should be doing a little bit of a little bit of discouragement a little bit of challenging and testing and then now they as they said before they lifted up their voice and wept and it's almost going to say the same thing and they lifted up their voice and wept again so both times they both think of this uh the how synchronized they are they both are lifting up their voice together they're both weeping but now all of a sudden there's a change and orpah kissed her mother-in-law in other words it was the goodbye kiss just as judas kissed christ to betray him now orpah kisses her mother-in-law and what does this represent she's saying goodbye but now the description but ruth clave to her they both by by what they heard the testing the challenge now they're walking together two sister-in-laws they're walking together they're walking together they stop you sure you want to do this yes they both they lift up their voices together they're both weeping together they're in harmony they're synchronized then they're challenged again and it seems as if in the very moment their voices are lifted together they're both weeping together and they both go to naomi they're going to cling to her they're going to come to her but this is where there's so much how you can amplify this if no naomi represents israel she could even be represented as the law and the prophets the old testament and the first coming of christ and how this is all embodied in these prophecies that are fulfilled and its orphan comes up and is she going to grab it or say no naomi we believe you we hold to you we will follow you but she gives her the kiss and she's going to turn and walk away but ruth grabs a hold of her and there's your type that's who you are you're the roof that cleaves but also here's your opposition here's your challenger you've already begun to make it this is good stuff you've already begun to make it out of moab but now where's your challenge where's your opposition it's in the one kissing naomi brother brahm says in redeemer redemption he says now she said the homeland's got food i must go back and she kissed her donde laws and told them goodbye so the kiss represents goodbye and so orpah a type of the church nominally or he says normally the church formal was willing to kiss her mother-in-law goodbye craving the things of the world and that former life turned back to her idols so here's orpah this laodicean condition this lukewarm condition this formalism everything that moab represented is now still embodied in this orpah and he says why did she turn back because her mother-in-law discouraged her a little by saying to both of them saying now i'm too old to have children and if i would be married again and have children would you wait for them no go back to your mother's in comfort well that's the way with the lukewarm church member just the first little thing comes along they're discouraged and willing to turn back oh what a pity that's this condition of orpah type of the nominal church the formal church she can come to a place where she kisses naomi goodbye because it's naomi that's going to lead her it's naomi that knows the way but ruth cleaves to her orpah gives her the goodbye kiss and brother brahm is pointing out how this represents the lukewarm church member we're just a little bit of opposition a little bit of fear a little bit of pressure you know you could lose and you're going to lose things and may not be as rosy on the other side and oh you sure you want to do this and she turns back he says what a pity he visits this again and why little bethlehem he says in orpah one of her to her son's wives when she comes to look upon what she had to sacrifice so now it's in what you leave it's what you sacrifice being a type of the modern church you listening type of the modern church if i have to go over there i'll have to get away from my dances i'll have to get away from my big time and my social gatherings notice the metrics by which she measures the choice i'm being called i'm being pulled i'm being moved i'm willing to go out but as she gets closer and gets further away she's informed and apprised of what she has to lose he says the sacrifice and what does she think about social aspects the very things that brother branham identified in the beginning of how the bigger church spires and the and the bells ringing and how big they are and what they look like he's identifying it's just the social aspects that begin to work on the orpah and she's afraid to lose something socially not loving what she stands to gain spiritually and wouldn't this wouldn't the spiritual gain be worth losing everything in the world i if i lose all my friends i lose all my best friends i lose social opportunities i lose social status i lose position i lose my job i lose respect from everybody but yet i fall i'm following in god's will that's what matters because it'll happen to you in your life when you do what god wants you to do there's people that you thought would always be there standing by your side who won't even bother to return a phone call the people that you thought would be there your whole life sometimes disappear and you'll never even know because they won't bother to tell you why at the end of the day they may have disagreed with what you did but all you need to do is do what god asks you to do he says the social gatherings then she just wept and kissed her mother-in-law and returned back now again we're pondering this that's not you right is there an orpha here tonight oh but not only is there a roof here but there's you're all roofs so then what does orpah represent how how is her example what is it that what is the scripture bringing up what is part of this mystery that when we see it it draws us closer to god in this example of orpah it's the same spirit that collided with israel and the exodus now it's not just israel as a type of the church in her exodus now it's a gentile who's now giving this perfect brotherhood called it a perfect picture of the bride now she's coming out and she has a twin as it was or a sister a sister-in-law one that's starting out with her in the same place in the same state as here she is she's come out and now she personifies the spirit that collided with israel in their exodus and this is where you see the opposition brother braham says it in kinsmen redeemer and orpah a type of the lukewarm church that once started a type of the church that won't go all the way she said that sounds pretty good so she kissed her mother-in-law and return back that's a type of the lukewarm believer who will believe jesus to be christ and then turn around and go back into the things that she come out of so much that could be said on all the different levels that that may pertain to an individual to the man that'll stake the way with the lord's despised few and then turn around and go back like a dog to his vomit and a hog to his wallow as the bible says so yeah it's a despised few you begin you start out you seem to be on the right track but something begins to work just as lot's wife looked back for a moment and turned to a pillar of salt now it happens again in orpah she starts out and she turns back he says many times we return back to the gods of our beginning that make a good sermon title the gods of our beginning maybe we get we got eyes of lust after the wrong thing we turned back to lusting again maybe we got idols of drinking idols of smoking not meats idols of lying idols of stealing all kinds of idols it could be a cult of personality it could be a certain way things are done it could be a pet doctor and he says and then profess and be baptized and then turn again what a sad thing he said in redeemer redemption what a pity you remember it never spoke her name no more i'm gonna i want to read i think one more statement tonight after this one but i want this to kind of be the our connector to the next sermon notice it never spoke her name no more she was excommunicated because of her decision so there's an ex communication but it's not you it's orpah the lukewarm church the lukewarm believer as each believer represents the church every american represents america every german represents germany every christian represents christ here she turned her back to go back into the things she came out of so now she's represents the lukewarm believer she represents the formal church the gentile church the laodicean church age how that meant and he says even preachers sometimes will take the way of the lord and when you speak to them about the baptism holy spirit nonsense turn away from it that's orpah what's orpah orpah is the one who rejects the truth no matter how much they've received before when the word unfolds further she shows her colors when she rejects the unfolding of the word she could come all the way up to something and be in every single one of the paces but then denies jesus christ is the same in every detail except the physical body that's the seed of orpah when you can believe malachi 4 5 god sent a prophet the church order and the books and tapes and all these and believe all these things and then come all the way up to the third pool in the open of the word but deny that and he says that's orpah that that's the spirit he uses it and maybe in a very innocent way for us to say we believe the baptism of the holy spirit but think about any truth in god's word when you say that's nonsense and turn away from a further unfolding of the word of god that's orpah and something about orpah if they could just turn away and mind their own business maybe there would be no fight maybe there would be no opposition but that's just not the moabite way and brother brown uses this phrase it's later in this statement i was just reading from here in kinsman redeemer you can go back and look it up he says orpah lukewarm excommunicated he says she orpah was excommunicated because of her decision now i want to just for a moment and i'm going to read a statement from what was the holy ghost given for it hopefully ending on a high note i want just to put this in here and this is what i'm hoping to pick up on next wednesday night orpah is the one that's excommunicated we feel as ruth what do we feel many times that we're excommunicated we feel picked on and laughed at and you know people kind of look down on us and make fun of us and we feel the ones that are outcast but orpa's the one that's lukewarm orpa's the one that's excommunicated it's the shock now that as a result of the presence of the sun that begins to pull away from the seed so it's not it's not that the shucks in there and kind of pushes you out and you're just there on the ground going oh no what happened no the life enters into you and because that's where the life is the shuck just begins to wither away and as they with their way they're saying i hate you hey because you've got the life and there i'm melting and you've got the life and they just begin to wither away and so what do they begin to tell you i'm really the seed i'm really the bride you're not because i guess even in one sense as you begin to as the grain begins to bow down they might feel like they hold a little bit of higher position on the stock hey because they pull back and you're hanging out and they feel like well i'm still above you think about it i want you to ponder it i want you to think about these feelings we have sometimes the isolation the persecution the rejection the bride feels is not you being rejected as much as it's the word separating out orpah and you feel that separation could you imagine the emptiness that ruth might have felt she might have thought oh the providence of god that i would be able to leave with with uh with arpa who was there with me i was there for her when her husband died she was there with me when my husband died and this camaraderie we had and this closeness that we had and just the way that we confided into one another we fought battles together we're persevering together but now we're going further in this word and we're taking the next step and oh this is fearful oh i can't believe this or i can't believe we're doing this together and then all of a sudden as you cleave and you've already made up your mind and you you have it in your heart you're going to say oh naomi i'll go anywhere you go your god will be my god your people be my people this word is the truth every single bit of it i believe i believe that all seals are opened and are ready for me to receive i believe it and as you're there cleaving to naomi and you feel that orpah's right there with you to think oh god in this there's three of us together we're going to be going back all of a sudden you notice something begins to change and it's orphan that kisses and begins to walk away and you don't think that ruth begins to feel some sort of maybe she begins to internalize am i doing something wrong well i'm related to her that's family am i i mean what now i have to choose i mean i only this is my mother-in-law and and this is one of my blood from my own nation and my own people and she begins to experience these wrestlings and these trials within herself what ruth is feeling is not because she's rejected but because orpah's excommunicated it's the lukewarm make-believer orpah lukewarm excommunicated the one that says nonsense and turns away from it that's the one that's rejected not the believer musicians if you could please come let me just remind you these are the circumstances of ruth's exodus this is how roof had to leave and if she types the bride then it's a type of our challenge today what ruth had to go through and you're sitting there going where in the world are you getting this brand my goodness this is just we just read it right here and all it says is that or kister where in the world are you getting this the prophets taught us he taught us what moab represented he teaches us what orpah represents it's the lukewarm gentile church and he's taught us all these things so i just look right into the message and say all right if that's who orpah is then you start looking at that church in its modern terms and how it fits with the bride you find she's the one that hates the believer that's where the persecution comes from i know i know i get it we're all afraid of antifa right we're going to come burn our message bibles they're going to take away our scofield we're all afraid of what they're going to do to shut down message churches but you ever realize that the real stigma and the real pressure you feel when you walk in truth it's not an unbeliever [Music] it's it's not it's not the it's not the liberals it's not the democrats it's not the evangelicals but really if they found out what you believed they'd probably ridicule you a little bit but it always hits real close to home sometimes it's the closest people to you brother branham says and what was the holy ghost given for in the days of ruth and the laws of redemption when naomi left the country because of trials hard times she went into the moabite land which were just lukewarm nominal christians because the moabites came from the daughter of lot and they were so-called believers and mixed up now remember ruth was one of them was that one of us at one time he says and her husband died and her sons died and on the road home naomi on a road home one of her daughter-in-law's orpah she said that she would return back to her country to her gods and to her church and to her people naomi tried to get ruth to go back but she said your people are my people your god is my god where you die there i'll die where you're buried there i'll be buried and i'll not turn back this is used as a wedding vow this is used to describe the heart of a of a bride on the day of her wedding and her attitude towards her groom as she formalizes this this union and this marriage it's often used to say that i as your wife is your wife to be as your fiance as the bride here on my wedding day your god will be my god your people will be my people wherever you go to church i'll go to church where you work i'll support you and there's this complete abandonment to the vision of the man these words were not spoken of a woman who's going to be joined to a husband who has the hope of a new beginning and seed coming forth and redemption in marriage and redemption and childbirth this is coming for a woman that is widowed promising another widow that shall go back to a land that was just famished with the hope that maybe there's something there do you realize what kind of vow and pronouncement this was this is not one that has a bunch of contingencies this is not one that did the research and read everything that was in the mls list and said this is a good deal this is gold there's a lot of good pictures there's a lot of amenities didn't read all the reviews on yelp and say yeah this will take care of what we're looking for no she went with the vision in her heart with the feeling that this is what's right this is what i must do and even in the face of bigger things and better things and more glorious things and more what would seem to be more powerful things and then her confidant and her friend leaving she says i your people whoever they are will be my people your god is my god but i said that's when a person's caught a vision don't make any difference what her people said didn't matter what her family said didn't matter what her friend said didn't matter what everyone was saying notice brother branham is the one that identifies the opposition coming from the moabite the opposition coming from the example of orpah the opposition coming from those that are the closest to ruth you're going over there and becoming a holy roller or something that didn't make any difference to ruth there was a purpose of god to be fulfilled and just as sure as you're hungering tonight for the holy spirit it's something in you pulling you that a purpose of god in your life has got to be fulfilled just like it was with ruth oh can you identify brother loyal can you identify brother joel can you identify with the believers that this is something in my heart doesn't make any difference to me the purpose of god for my life must be fulfilled and i'm hungry for something tonight it's something that's pulling me what is it it's the purpose of god for me i won't i won't talk bad about orpah i won't want to orphan down i'll give her a blessing i'll tell her to go i'll tell her to thrive i'll tell her to rest i'll tell her to go find her husband where she believes she belongs but as for me i must fulfill the purpose of god in my life i can only walk in the vision that god has for me just as it was in ruth i have to walk this way can you personally identify with it tonight i'm talking to each one of you as individuals boy and girl and man and woman married or single whatever your circumstance may be tonight i believe that god has called you in the type of roof and you're having to walk this path maybe most of us tonight can stand in the presence of our boaz in the presence of our redeemer knowing that we are now the impregnated bride of jesus christ and just look back and see what he has done and what we've gone through and how we left moab we we were opposed by our sister-in-law but here we are today and we can say thank you god there's a great purpose in my life we can rejoice and thank god for it but oh i think it would be wonderful if we could catch the attention of a ruth in her journey and help her on the way because there's good ground coming there's better things in store let's [Music] stand [Music] are you happy tonight has the word driven away some darkness has it discerned a need in your life has it has it come and put things in perspective for you has it helped you that was him that was him that was your gift that was your need he gets the glory let's give it to him let's praise him now let's thank him now let's talk to him now share your heart if it's in quietness if it's with the head bowed if it's in a whisper to be in praise you're with family tonight don't be afraid to pour your heart out to him and say thank you god i'm a ruth i've caught a vision and maybe even we could have some honesty lord it really matters a lot to me what people say it matters a whole lot to me what people say [Music] lord help me to focus more on the purpose that you want to fulfill let's pray thank you father thank you lord jesus for the clarity of your word for your presence that is with us [Music] thank you lord that the word is constantly unfolding more layers and more depth [Music] on a wednesday night sir an hour 15 minutes [Music] but it feels like eternity lord feels so free and unbound it feels supernatural without the perspective of seconds and minutes it just feels present that's what eternity is it's just present i pray lord that if there be any lifting or reviving now in our spirits may we take advantage of this opportunity to come boldly before your throne of grace to ask to receive from you what we have need of if we identify with ruth in this story and we identify in particular with ruth not orpha not naomi not muhammad or killian or elimelech but we identify with ruth if that's our faith lord then no matter where we are if we're in moabite if we're if we if we have a dead husband if we're just hearing about a message and a land lord we know how the story ends we know what we're coming to may that give us courage lord may that give us faith to believe all things are possible what i pray for the people tonight who've been disciplined beyond discipline lord they've been faithful they've been attentive they've pulled upon this i pray that you bless them and strengthen them give them courage lord and be their portion answer their prayers father i pray bless them in the name of the lord jesus christ [Music] amen
