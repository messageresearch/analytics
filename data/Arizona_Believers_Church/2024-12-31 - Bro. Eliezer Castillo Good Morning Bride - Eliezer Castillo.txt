TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Romans 1311 to13 it says and that knowing the time now that it is high time to wake out of sleep for now is this our Salvation nearer than when we believed the night is far spent the day is at hand let us therefore cast off the works of darkness let us put off put on the armor of light let us walk honestly as in the day not in rioting or in drunkenness not in U chambering or wantedness not in strife and envying let you may be seated um I I believe that's a fitting scripture today um when there's a lot of people that's what they're doing they're out in the night in drunkenness they're doing all these things right but if we can stay in the light as a Christian I think that's the best thing to do um if You' like to turn with me also to Genesis or you don't have to but I'm going to read this real quick Genesis 32:31 it's um in the story of Jacob where Jacob wrestles with the man it says the Angel God he after he was done he asked the man what's your name the man didn't want to tell him his name but he had a revelation that he said well I just met God face to face right and here in 32:31 it says and he passed over Pinel the sun rose upon him and he halted upon his thigh yeah so um I I I think that's such a good picture to see because the day has come he's a happy man right he's limping it looks like he the Bible says that he overcame but in reality he just got beat up by by an Angel by a man by God right but he prevailed right and now finally the son is on him and whatever he was afraid to face that day he was able to face it because he went through that long hard night I want to read a little scripture or a little quote from brother brandham and Shalom where he says my New Year's message is to the church elected in Jesus Christ for 1964 not not just to the church groups but the elect lady the lady of the church Christ bride see that's who I'm addressing we're facing here in our two subject that we read two scriptures rather a very contrast one to another in Isaiah it says arise and shine for the glory of God has come upon you the light is here and then the very next verse he says gross darkness is upon the people right and when we are in a mixture his of light and darkness then my address to the church is Shalom peace let's find out what it's all about see we're facing this year with both Darkness and Light Where We Are The World is one of the most chaotic times of Darkness that it ever has stood in and is standing in again the the Most Blessed light that it ever did Shine in and there is there it is so that's one thing that we can see is brother brandham he he said the these um these words and if you ever listen to I'm sure everybody's listened to Shalom yeah but he was always showed and reveal to to us that the seven Church ages they represented the moon so when Jesus left the scene and he said I promise that I'm going to send the comforter that that was a nighttime right the darkness went over the Earth and he said now I'm going not going to have my full presence on the earth or or My fullness upon the Earth but you little flock are going to reflect my word right so throughout the seven Church ages the churches reflected Jesus Christ and every Church reflected a portion of Jesus Christ the Bible says ye are the light of the world so it wasn't his direct presence anymore but it was through the church the seven Church ages had the moon phases right because he said that the church was a type of the moon and the only way the light would be shown to the world is through this moon right and so now that you can't see the sun anymore but you can see the light through the church and we find brother brandham he says in Shalom we find out the moon and the heavens reflects the light of the Sun in the absence of the sun right so the son said hey I've got to leave I've got to go but I'm going to send a comforter and then you are the light of the world now so there's an absence of the Sun and that now there's a Darkness over the whole entire world right and and brother brandom says that's a darkness of worldism of unbelief this whole Darkness but the churches would always reflect that light and here at night it if you look throughout the whole Bible it it say if you would like to see in certain scriptures like Matthew 25 uh scriptures in uh Psalms 30 18 it talks about the night as being a time of striving weeping and and and almost awaiting time that there's going to be a getting a ready time in the gospels um the night also becomes something like a uh an apprehension a trial potentially symbolizing a spiritual TR struggle whenever Jesus whenever he gave the Last Supper there was a struggle right there was a stress there was something going on there because the night was there there was a struggle because the day was about to happen and and Jesus was going to be crucified so the the night always seems like there's going to be a struggle a weeping a travail something's going to happen brother brandham he says that when Jesus was there in Gethsemane he says Prevail means wrestle and overcome oh my The Garden of Gethsemane when the blood dropped down from his face he was overcoming see see he was overcoming so when Jesus he was there praying to God there was a prevailing there was a wrestling there was a weeping there was something going on where Jesus needed something from God so at night that's what it was and throughout the seven Church ages that's what it has been right it has been a a weeping a striving for something that's what it has been in Psalms 35 it says anger endureth but a moment but his favor is life yes weeping may endure for a night but joy cometh in the morning now um this word weeping may endure for a night the word endure is is in the Hebrew word is to Lodge or to sojourn and it's almost like a person coming in and lodging with you so so it's almost somebody coming in and it's a stranger that is going to stay there for a night yeah wow and and and weeping is not you it's not the bad thing there's something that caused the Weeping right so there there's there's a something that caused the struggle and now weeping has come right and and and so it says like as a person but joy comes in the morning meaning there's another person coming and it's going to cause the Hebrew word joy and somebody to cause to chout and and that's what's going on today where there is a weeping there is a a crying out for something now brother brandham he starts talking about this mixture of light and darkness that this is different than all the other ages because all the other ages they had this light on in the moon every time but whenever he starts talking about this this is completely different right that many many events they occurred in that time and revealed that the light the the lights that he drew on the board they they changed in the lady oia so do you remember whenever he had that Revelation and the Lord showed him how to draw those the moon phases and showing okay the light this is how the light is going to be in every Age and and things happened during this message that brother Brandon preached in Shalom where he said that there's now there's a mixture there there's a total blackout yet there's light right and it says that because there's been a lot of uh events that happened and what what happened and so brother Brandon preached that message in I believe January 1st or January 12th 1964 and the event that happened was in December 30th 1963 where they was a complete blackout of the Moon in North America and he said that was a sign to the church that God sent out a sign and he said that means something and and after that days after I believe in January 4th the pope visits Israel and in in this in uh January 6th he goes and he goes to the Orthodox church and it says if you could look it up in in uh Google but they went and they they gave themself a kiss of fellowship and and it was showing that the churches went into complete darkness brother Bram says that Total Blackout shows that every single church every church that calls thems by a name has gone into blackout complete blackout and and and and turned their self away from Christ right and that that eclipse encapsulates what that was brother brandham he says in recognizing your day preached in 1964 he says then we see before the Seven Seals that hid all the Mysteries me not knowing what I was drawing on the board for the church ages I never God knows just by Vision I draw it out not knowing that God year and 6 months later I was going to vindicate it in the skies by the moon and slip across the national papers I did not know that I didn't know that there'd be a mysterious blackout in the moon to represent the lady OA age now the papers you only get six um now you only get six ages but it's the lady oia Church age um was completely blacked out completely and if you notice the spiritual application as God said it in heaven when I set it here on Earth I left a little bitty space as you see just a teeny little bit of light and that was before the very elected was to be called from the earth the reason I placed it on here um for the seventh age but God put it in the heavens and it was totally blacked out means maybe the last one is called from the lady a age we don't know there could be a sermon on it so brother Bram he showed that in this last day which is called the lady oia Church age whenever he drew the moon and he put a little light showing the reflection of Christ every church had that reflection of Christ he showed a little bit of light right and he said this is going to be the little light before the going away of the church that there was going to be a little bit of light but then God coming in and giving a total blackout of the Moon showed that there was no more light in this age brother brandham he showed that there was no more light that the light was not reflecting Jesus or the moon was not reflecting Jesus Christ anymore and the L and that's lady oia we know what lady oia means it's it's the people's rights see I I believe that the lady o age encapsulated every single church that denominated themselves now I just wanted by curiosity I wanted to see what denominate meant it means to label it means to name so every time a church would come and say this is our Doctrine this is what we believe this is who we are they put a period and they separated themselves from the light it's not that God he he said you know what I'm do away with lady oia but the Bible or brother brandham said that because of her actions right because of her actions she pushed him out of the door and because of her name it showed what her character was right that she was going to push him out brother Bram he says in the samirian church age he says now the church name is associated with the nature of the character now you're talking about the lady see a church age that had the Pentecostal age that had the methodists that had the lutherans that had all these people and her name that that's what her names were brother Bram called them Blasphemous names he said it's the nature of her character did you notice with Samaria meaning bitter and did you know each one of the church now it's the church name that has something to do with the character of the church I could say something here but I better not cuz you get me wrong see your name does too you you might not know it but it does oh yes you know it's numer um it's numerology no it's not or you say it's numerology no it's not when Jacob was born they called him Jacob which was supplanter but he wrestled with the angel and God changed his name to Israel a prince is that right Saul was Saul of Tarsus a mean fellow but when he come to Jesus he was called Paul Simon was a Simon but when he was come to Jesus he was called Peter a little Stone oh yes sir your name Associates your it has an impression on your character and and we know that in the Jewish culture in the Bible names were very important right I believe the the word uh name in Hebrew is sh which it's it's uh the same word used for soul which is uh Nisha so the the Jews the Hebrews the Israelites they knew that your name that their names were tied to something deeper than just oh yeah that's so and so so every time there was a character change or every time something happened sign significant in that person's life they would name that child they would name them and say you know what because of my sorrows because of this I'm going to name him this right job he was an Afflicted man there was people that was favored from God so they were named that person and they would walk in that name and here the reason I'm saying this is because this lady oia Church age that name is tied to that church right even to the point where they kicked Jesus out and now there's a completely blackout in the church brother Bram says the name Leia means people's rights was very common and was given to several cities in honor for Royal ladies so named and if you look at what what the message was to the lady OAS to the lady oia Church age it was um well I'm going to do this well I'm going to do that well you think you're this but you're really this and brother brandham he says Darkness this lady oia Church age when Jesus when which is the word in in the lady oia Church age was outside the church knocking at the door trying to get in darkness gross Darkness upon the people was that right preached that in Shalom showing that they're the ones that cause the darkness it's because of their desire brother bam said it was world worldliness and her name showed who she was and her actions brought the manifested darkness in the church now now um he continues on he says that the Pentecostal CH Church age is the lady oia Church age the Methodist Church age is the lady oia Church age all of these these um churches and names it is the lady oia brother Bram says we're not living in that Pentecostal age anymore he said we're not we're living in another age see we're not living in the Methodist age we're living in another age we're living on up here in the bright age calling out of the church and getting it together for the Rapture and that's the age that we're living to my honest opinion that's the truth now how are we in the bright age because every church is associated with this with a name yeah now how are we in the bride age when there has been um Believers that represented the bride from Paul's time all the way to the 21st 20th century but now we're in the bride age Paul Paul was bride the people that followed him they represented the bride and all these other people represented the bride but now we're in the bride age right now now now it's outside of this dark church that is no light and there there's a separate church now how is that possible there was something that caused this Darkness brother brandham says that that whenever the sun comes up it presses the darkness whenever there's light that starts coming up it presses the darkness to where the the the darkness gets even gross Darkness gets even worse what caused this brother brandom he says in Shalom he says when you see Darkness settling here or or here in Shalom he says now in the heavens above did you notice I'm looking on this the light the picture out there in Life magazine that the brother lives here in in this home has it put on his wall the triangle of light now it's strange that brother brandham called it a light because we know it as a cloud but he said that this was a light right now now you have to understand that brother brandham it was 1964 it was January and he's saying all this something is going on here right now to us maybe you you know life goes on and all of this but in 1964 something was going on right he said there's Darkness going on well how do you know because the the signs have been showing that the church has rejected Jesus Christ well why did they reject Jesus Christ because first the sun has to start moving up in order for the darkness to start pressing on to the people and so before December 30th you go all the way to the springtime a cloud appeared and that Cloud represented the fullness of the word where where the word was going to be shown the light came that was the rising of the sun there right so as the sun rose and it showed the revealed word the word for our day that was going to take us out of any denominational thought anything that was going to uh make us stuck in this world that word those Seven Seals was going to reveal everything to us yes so that light came up and then months after the darkness came right but first that sun had to rise first that revealed word so this is happening in present time in actual time it's happened years and years and years Ando ago and people might say well what does it apply to me well people are rising today yes because as that word has been given there's people barely receiving it right now there's been people that we say there are loved ones or people that we love that are out in the world they don't know anything about it but yet maybe they're catching a revelation of the word and as they're catching that Revelation they're stepping out of that Darkness stepping out of the worldism and stepping into the light amen he called it a cloud he called that cloud a light and it was the face of the Son of God and that represented the seals that was going to be open to bring back the son through the fullness of the word he was going to bring him back he's been absent this whole time he's been allowing all these things but now Shalom good morning the son is coming yes he was going to come and he was and and and it took another light brother Brenham says to identify him he says when you see Darkness settling Darkness just before the day we know that the morning star is hanging out yonder to introduce the coming son so before that sun comes he says there's a Morning Star right to introduce so every time you see that sun you're going to see a Morning Star and what it's doing it's saying Shalom right it's introducing the coming son it's it's a going between it's always Darkness just a few minutes before the day black um blackout comes the moon fails to shine the darkest before day is because the light is pressing the darkness but the Morning Star comes out and says good morning Shalom that's him Among Us his word being identified and it took this star to identify him to say hey he's here that we we shouldn't live below the blessings God has given us that we we have the fullness and he's the one that identified him brother brandham he says and God's provided only provided place of worship he says and the name is in the word because he is the word so how do you identify him he showed he said his name well what was his name it's in his word because he is the word amen so what is he then the word interpreted is the manifestation of the name of God no wonder flesh and blood has not revealed this to you but my Father which is in heaven has revealed this to you who I am and upon on this rock I'll build my place of worship and the gates of hell can't shake it down amen so the name it identifies him and what's that name he said that's the word manifested that's the word he the word is in the name and the word in is interpreted is the manifestation of the name of God right so every time that word becomes new to you when it becomes open to you you've seen the name you know who he is and and and it it might not sound like much but why are we called the bride yes because there was somebody just like John says he was the friend of the bridegroom right and he had to come and he had to present the bride to the husband right and so we are in a bright age because this is now the time yes whenever the bride and the bridegroom come together right and his name was identified and whenever the bridegroom's name is identified and the bride is coming her name has to change she's not going to be her maiden name anymore she's not going to be Pentecostal no more right she's not going to be sinner no more she's not going to have her Earthly name once she comes together with the bridegroom her name has to change am and it was the friend of the bridegroom that came and he said behold here is here he is and he revealed him to the bride and the bride she changed her name from the church and all those things to bride right right she changed it and what was she was standing in the presence of the son yes she was standing in the presence of the Lord Brother brandham he says in once more he says you say a name he means nothing then why did he change his uh change Abram's to Abraham why did he change Saul's to Paul Simon's name to Peter why did he change his own name why did he change Jacob to Israel not until he wrestled with the Lord not until he overcame but when Jesus overcome death Hell In The Grave the Bible said he had a new name and J when Jacob overcame and if the church can overcome she will stop saying I'm Methodist Baptist Presbyterian I believe this way I'm this I'm that when she can overcome her Creeds and the worlds that draw her in there she'll come back to the Bride of Jesus Christ Miss Jesus Christ and people say well you know we believe in the name of Jesus Christ yes but in that name has the word in there yes in that name there's more to it than just say Jesus because you know I was thinking about Paul how he was Sol of Tarsus he was persecuting the church he knew the word but whenever the light came to him he began he he he had a conception of what that light was he had enough Revelation to sayl who are you see he's asking for his name right and whenever he gave his name he said I am Jesus it wasn't just a name all the scriptures tied together he realized what he was doing he realized that every single thing that maybe he was taught in in in in with gelia and all of that had been tied together because now he there's a name attached to the word yeah that's that's what it is good it's just not oh just the name of Jesus what where is the Revelation where is the word where the life can be changed because every time you meet this word every time you'll meet this son every time you encounter Jesus Christ the word you've got to change you've got to change from the condition that you're in you've got to change from one place to another another because there's no way you can't change you know when I was thinking about all of this I was thinking about Jacob I was thinking about how Jacob he had a terrible issue going on he's been a supplanter he's been a deceiver his whole life yeah and now it's finally catching up to him right finally when it seems like everything is going right he's got his blessings he's got his children and the Lord tells him go back home and I'm going to bless you and he goes and he starts going back home but he's got a big problem the very person that he stole every single blessing before he's got to confront him right he's got to go back his name is Jacob and I I I myself personally I attach myself to that my Earthly name my Earthly position the way I was born and raised and everything that's attached to Jacob and though Jacob was a blessed man though though God loved him and even as he was going and if you look at chapter 32 it says that a host of angels went to go meet him he was he was a blessed man but yet when he came to confront his brother man he was having a rough time he tried to figure out everything and once that night came in in he started to think he started to figure out things he said you know what we're going to separate the car Caravans you're going to go and you know he had sheep goats and what have you but he separated them he said just in case these guys are killed the other ones can escape so he goes and he starts sending Caravans there of people his servants all of the goods and saying you know what this is for Esau these are presents let him know that this is from his servant Jacob and and that this is for him finally the last night comes and he sends out everybody and the Bible says that the night and he went to sleep there that night and he the Bible says that he arose up and he got his wife and his kids this the most precious people to him he said okay you guys are the last before me I need you to go over there and I need you to make friendly there with Esau and I'll meet you there and he goes and they they go and the Bible says that he was there left alone and in night and and a man came there didn't say an angel didn't say we we we don't know who it was well we do know yeah but the Bible says a man yeah and we the Bible doesn't say it's very vague there's no intention no nothing but I really like how brother Aaron brought it it was a man to come wrestle with God or it was a man to come wrestle with Jacob and it wasn't necessarily to go and Prevail over Jacob right I believe that there there was intention there with God yeah that Jacob this deceiver this this person that has supplanted and deceived everybody took all of his blessings with his own hands he says now you you've you've got to change yeah right you've got to wrestle it out and and the main blessing is not going to come from you it's not going to come from your own devices and you thinking about it no you're going to meet me face to face and I don't come here to just knock you out but I I want to rest and I want to see where you're at and it was during that time Jacob began to wrestle it out yeah Jacob began to fight for his life I I believe that's where the church has been for years yeah and this in this wrestle and this weeping yeah and this weeping towards the night right crying out to the Lord getting more from the Lord asking the Lord for a blessing yes yes and there there's a point where the Bible says that the day was coming yes and the angel they they both have two uh conf inner confence going on in inside of them if you just read it if you read it for face face value Jacob could not leave that night without the blessing he could not face the sun with without changing before that son arose a change had to happen before he he had to receive that son with gladness and here this Angel he could not be here when the sun revealed himself he couldn't he just like John said I have to decrease so that he may increase so here at the breaking of the day where I believe that's where we're at today right at the breaking of the day he starts being desperate with them and the angel says I can't be I must decrease so that he must increase I can't be here yeah he said but Jacob says I can't be here or I can't face the son without my blessing without my change because if I'm still the same sinner if I'm still the same Pentecostal right the same message believer without any Revelation without any true experience of Christ how am I going to greet the son I need I I need the angel I need that morning star to say good morning welcome him yes welcome him in so there's this fight between both of them saying I need something from you before you leave they fight and they fight and he turns and and there's there's a point in I believe in the first seal where brother brandham he stops referring to the people as a church he said and this this is this is during the opening of The Seven Seals right right the the son has already shown himself and now in the sky a representation of what God was going to do reveal himself to the people right and he says before all of these things I'm no more calling you church I'm no more calling you something that the that is a Blasphemous name no more something that's going to be just a diff different people but the same spirits but I got to call you bride yes and he said you're no more going to be a supplanter you you know what I like is he asked him what his name was first right yeah and you know what I I put my name there what's your name what what do they call you yeah well my name is Jacob I'm a sinner I I mess up all the time I have habits I have this I have unbelief whatever whatever our human nature is whatever our human struggle is we put it there we put it in that struggle what do they call you I'm mess up all the time I'm this I'm that I'm a failure put it all on that wrestling match put it all while you're striving with God if you truly desire something you put it all you don't Reserve anything see Jacob was used to reserving he was used to oh well I'll do this but he always had a trump up his sleeve he always knew how to get his Blessing one way or another without being scaved or without any scratch he did that to his father-in-law he did that to his brother to his own father he did that too now he's face to face with God now he's face to face with the word there's it's a mirror now right there there's no faking yeah there there's no going going around it what's your name what's your failures what's the things that that hinder you put it all on there I'm I'm no good I'm a sinner I'm an unbeliever I'm this I'm that you'll no more be called that no more you'll no more be called a failure you'll no more be called a deceiver a sinner right a just a church member but you will be my bride yes you will be my bride why is she called bride because she takes on his name what is his name it is the manifested word you take on the word yourself yes you are Miss word yes you'll no more be called Jacob you are Israel and when when he received that just like Saul he says Lord who are you yeah who are you and God didn't want to say I believe God revealed it to him the only reason I know that is because the Bible says when he left that place he says I'm going to call this place Pinel cuz I've just gone face to face with God it was just a man it was just a regular man but he knew who he was yes what's your name Saul said who are you Lord he says I'm Jesus and from that moment on he he gave his life for the Lord he had a different revelation of all the study and everything that he had all all of his credentials didn't matter because now he knew the Revelation he had the Revelation when he met the sun he met that light he said who are you he said you'll no more be called Jacob but your name is Israel a prince one who prevails against against God and over people and it's amazing because he represented all the children of Israel why why are we called bride why is this called a bride age is because this is the time of the marriage one day we'll have a marriage supper but this is the time when we unite and every single person that has been called bride throughout the whole seven Church ages are represented in you so that's why they can be called bride because there was people here to take the hand and once you took the hand your name Miss Jesus Christ Miss bride represented the whole seven Church ages Eve she was the mother of all she represented all Abraham his name was Elohim the ham part but Abram was the father of all so it mixed together and now he represented millions and millions and millions of people in one man he represented them and today you represent those that have died and gone on as we Unite with Christ and we get ready for what's next we Face a new day we're not living in darkness no more we're not living in in in other ages anymore we're living in the light yes and and as we're living in the light there's people that that are still seeing the break of a new day yes there's maybe still people out in darkness in drunkenness that still need something but the bride she's waking up yes the bride she's stepping out into the break of a new day and this word even though the the prophet has gone the word is still saying good morning yes he's saying good morning bride you're not a church anymore you're not a sinner anymore you're the Bride of Jesus Christ good morning well all these things are happening it doesn't matter we are in that day yes we are in another age it's amazing because in the scripture that I read previously he says that he passed over penuel and the RO a sun rose upon him and he halted upon his thigh there the Sun finally Rose the sun on his back and now he can face everything that he was afraid to face see he had a right to be scared as Jacob because all of his offenses towards his brother towards his family was Jacob so he was afraid because Jacob has to face his judgment Jacob has to face everything that he's gone through and Jacob he will not be able to face it he has to face that judgment that's why he was afraid and God had to change him he was a different person so it was no more Jacob no more schemes no more no more backsliding no more deceiving no more he was a different man his name was Israel a prince beat up limping yeah but it showed that was a sign that he met God sometimes we come in come into the message come into whatever with pride saying I know it all I know this I know that but we'll leave limping yes we'll leave understanding that God is God yes we'll understand that there's a greater thing out here yes that it it'll never be like everything else that's the one thing I I love is that though it seems like we're doing this just for ourselves and and we're we're getting our family yet there there's people the whole seven Church ages depending on the bride here if You' like to stand with me just wanted to give that out a little encouragement if You' like to pray as the um musicians would like to come up Heavenly Father lord it's such a honor that we were chosen for the great Revelation that you gave to us Lord even though we didn't deserve it when we look at our fleshly lives when we look at the Jacob part of our Lives yet father it was predestinated even before they were born he said the young the older Shall Serve the younger you already had it pre-planned before the foundation of the world and even though there's a part of unworthiness unsecure insecurity Lord you already had this in your mind father you had each and every person here father and as we Face a new year Lord we can face it with confidence knowing that you're with us that no matter what happens Lord you'll be there whatever step we make you said I'll be with you whether it's through the valleys through the deserts you
