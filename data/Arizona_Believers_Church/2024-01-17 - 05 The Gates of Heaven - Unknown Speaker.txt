TRANSCRIPT
========================================
continuing on the series on the house of the Lord and wanting to just go further in this subject as we mentioned on Sunday maybe take it piece by piece what the house of the Lord means I've already looked at it in two respects it's a tabernacle or a dwelling place it's referred to as a tent um the house of the Lord is the Tabernacle of the Lord that Tabernacle in the wilderness was a Dwelling Place of God's presence a place that he promised to meet meet them in between those Cher boms above the mercy seat and then it became a temple when Solomon built the Temple that Tabernacle that was the house of the Lord now the temple this physical structure this one with a permanent foundation is called the house of the Lord and to be called the temple it speaks of a consecrated place a place of worship and offering and just I think you probably already know this already well before we even started the series but to use the house of the Lord as a subject it's just rich in meaning so many different types and examples to us and we've even mentioned how that the Lord desires to tell the story of Redemption and see our own selves reflected in the house of the Lord and I believe that there's uh personal things that we can gather from this that are very very practical and so before I continue and go further tonight my title is going to be the Gates of Heaven and going to be drawing it from here in Genesis chapter 28 the Gates of Heaven and I'll show you what my original title slide was going to be I was originally going to call it all your gates are belong to us and that was my working title and uh just at the last minute things just shifted around and I realized maybe all of us could really participate in the Gates of Heaven but all your gates are belong to us might not uh belong to God may not quite ring true to to all of us or ring the way that I would want it to but if you could turn to John chapter 14: 23 and and look at the scripture together Jesus is saying if I go I'm going to come again to you I'm going to prepare a place for you in my father's house are many mansions and there's a forward-looking aspect to that where we're going oh one day in eternity in the future there'll be a place where we could sit down forever and it'd be the house of God and in my father's kingdom are many palaces and we know that there's a body waiting for us Eternal in the heavens and all that light is on that but in verse 23 in that same reading Jesus answered and said unto them if a man love me he will keep my words and my father will love him and we will come unto him and make our Abode with him make our mansion with him and so when it says that you're going to be uh a dwelling place there's going to be an abiding or a staying with you and we looked at this on Sunday as this is a home for heaven that we want to go make Heaven our home and one day we want to leave here and we want to live eternally in heaven and we've got a body in heaven and our angel in heaven behold is before the father's face and there's a lot of things that are forward looking but now to say that we'll make our Abode it means there's a mansion here now and you are that home your your heart can be a home for heaven and we've looked at three different aspect aspects of the house of the Lord how that in the Old Testament God dwelled in the Tabernacle he dwelt in the temple in the New Testament God dwells in his body the church or the bride and that and that's been our real emphasis and we'll continue to emphasize that part tonight and then in eternity in the future home God is resident in man with man in Christ and the bride and we looked at all these different instances old Old Testament New Testament future home all of them in every instance God makes a home on Earth that God has a place where he dwells God has a place that he wants to be and so tonight as we look at the subject of the Gates of Heaven and it to use the phrase Gates expresses an entr entrance of an access or even an introduction uh to heaven and I want you to think of that way when we talk about we're still talking about the house of the Lord and a home but now the Gates of Heaven is expressing an entrance or an introduction to something now just take your Bibles and turn to where you were just a moment ago in Genesis chapter 28 start with verse 16 and I will go through this and read to verse 22 again we've already uh read this and we'll just make reference again how in the night uh Jacob was dreaming and he saw this ladder which was from the earth and reached to heaven and angels ascending and descending from that ladder in this place where he was it says Jacob awake out of his sleep and he said surely the Lord is in this place and I knew it not now he has this sensitivity to believe that when he arrived the Lord was already there that him having laid there and and dreamed there that God was already present with him but now he's been awakened to this and he's alarmed by it and he says I I didn't know it and he was afraid and said how Dreadful is this place now not in a terror that you would run from but it's this awe and this reverence for it he says this is none other but the house of God and this is the Gate of Heaven that's quite a statement just imagine going to sleep in the wilderness and putting together some stones to make a bed and you fall asleep and you have a dream and you wake up and you feel as if you had fallen asleep unknowingly in the house of God somehow you found yourself at the foot of a ladder to Heaven he says this is the very House of God and this is the Gate of Heaven these are very strong words for Jacob to utter and Jacob rose up early in the morning and took the stone that he had put for his pillows and set it up for a pillar and poured oil upon the top of it and he called the name of that place bethl but the name of that city was called lus at the first I believe that's almond tree and Jacob vowed a vow saying if God will be with me and will keep me in this way that I go and will give me bread to eat and reignment to put on so that I come again to my father's house in peace then shall the Lord be my God and this Stone which I have set for a pillar shall be God's house so he erects something this this this stone that he laid upon now he sets it upright and he he says this shall be God's house and of all that thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto thee so here's where the these tithes are born where he's going to give this tenth and are not necessar born but here's this expression of this tithing to God and he says I'm going to set this pillar up and it's going to be God's house when he calls it the house of God it's a place that he's going to identify with God but not a stopping point it's a place where God dwelt when he wakes up he says surely the Lord is here this is the place where God is pleased to be he says I I'm going to call this God's house a place where God dwells the word he's using is going to imply a dwelling place and then he says and this is the Gate of Heaven now when he says the Gate of Heaven I hope you can get this image in your mind right now and I'll just get to it and just fix it it was a meeting place between the natural and the supernatural he's a natural man wanting to get a good night's rest because the sun is down and it's late at night and he goes to bed and in his dream in his sleep he dreams of this latter reaching to heaven and angels coming from Heaven to Earth God above it God speaking God de de claring things to him so when he called it the Gate of Heaven he said this is where Heaven comes to Earth this is a meeting place this is a way that angels can come from Heaven Down to Earth this is the place where God can speak from Heaven to Earth this is a a a super a place where the supernatural communes and makes itself known to the Natural this is a a a a meeting place Between Heaven and Earth and the word that's used there for gate it refers to an entrance it's also can be referred to a meeting place a place of authority a place of judging so when he says gate it carries with it a a lot of meaning in Psalms chapter 24:7 says lift your lift up your heads oh ye gates and be ye lifted up ye Everlasting doors and the king of glory shall come in so to speak of a gate it's an entrance and Gates often uh reflect the glory of a city and there's a reason why they had gates in those days and you'd find it in a village you find it in a town you find it in a city that they would use build walls they build Gates and it had a purpose and it had a design even when God is describing the New Jerusalem one of the last descriptions it has of it is the 12 gates to that City all the doors are made of one Pearl and so it speaks of the glory and the Grandeur of a city uh how the how ornate they are how big they are how many it would have would speak to just the vastness of the city and the beauty of the city and so this the gate reflects a point of entrance into something and speaks of the glory of something in Proverbs 31: 23 speaking of this virtuous woman it says her husband is known in the gates when he sth among the Elders of the land when this is an illusion to the fact that there are Elders that would sit together and dispense judgment in the gate and the Bible speaks of it in different places that when the father stands there his sons will stand with him in the gate as a witness as a Defender and it's a place of it's the to say that the husband sits there in the gate it's a place rightful place of honor and respect and he sits there with a place of power and judgment with the other Elders to discern a matter to judge a matter so the gates is a place of honor it's a place of power in judgment says in Proverbs chap 22:22 Rob not the poor because he is poor neither oppress The Afflicted in the gate because in the gate it's a judgment scene Justice is dispensed at the gate there's correction uh that goes forth in the gate and and this is the image of a gate it's a place of grandeur and Glory it's a place of entrance it's a place of honor and respect it's where Justice Goes Forth and righteousness Goes Forth when you possess the gates of a city you possess the city it's what the Bible says over you shall possess the gates of your enemy in different places it speaks of when you go to possess their Gates and possess the gates of the city if you possess the gates you possess the city you determined what would come in and what would go out and so it carries with it Such Great Expressions Zechariah 8:16 these are the things that you shall do speak ye every man the truth to his neighbor execute the Judgment of Truth and peace in your Gates so the gates was a place where Justice is served a place where Justice is to go forth but it's the place where you to find truth place where you find righteousness this is what the gates mean when he says these are the Gates of Heaven uh don't just simply look at as maybe a doorway but there's something that Jacob recognizes in this this the symbolism what it typed and what it showed this place of authority this place of righteousness this place of judgment this rightful place this place of Correction it says in Matthew 16:1 18 Peter has this Revelation and he says Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God and Jesus says I say unto thee that thou art Peter and Upon This Rock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it expression of Satan's kingdom and his his authority and his attitude and his judgments and uh the things that he would honor the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against the Revelation but Peter with the Revelation the Gates of Hell could not Prevail against Peter and and with the Revelation the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against the church so it cannot Prevail against the Revelation nor the church that's built upon that Revelation and the individuals who make up that church that's built upon that Revelation and it's the gates of hell it represents the power and authority the Grandeur all the all the conspiracies and all the activities and all the tricks and everything that the devil would do that's what the gates of hell are so when he looks at this he says this is the Gate of Heaven the gate has a an expression it has a life behind it it has a power behind it it means something say this is the Gate of Heaven but he calls it bethl this place he calls bethl which is the house of God what it translates to the house of God from Beth which is house and L which is God this was a consecrated place it was a sacred meeting place this is the reason why when Jacob wakes up he says surely God has been in this place a and because God was there he wants to consecrate it he wants to dedicate it he wants to acknowledge that this is this is a place special where God has revealed something very great to me notice the promise given to Jacob and how it echoes what he said to Abraham what he said echoed to Isaac it's now being rehearsed to him so this is the very uh precious place for him to lift up this Stone and it says that he took the stone that he used for a pillow and he he sets it up for a pillar maybe it was laying flat but now he wants it to be standing up in a way that you would look at says man has Man Has Lifted this up he's it's not just a stone Lan on the ground it's been erected by man and then he anoints it with oil and by anointing it with oil it's this act of dedicating the place says this is the house of God it ought to be Anointed with oil ought to be consecrated and dedicated and he was doing it as a sign and and these things as I've been studying on them even since last year this these very elements that begin to this this picture begin to crystallize before me as I was seeing what Jacob would do here in Genesis chapter 28 and here there's a picture of the house of the Lord and all these different applications there's things that you could start to see when he's there in this moment he places this pillar up and he pours this this oil upon this pillar and he's it's as if it's a sign of this rock being anointed just as Jesus says Upon This Rock I'll build my church and we know that that rock is a revelation and now as the stone is being lift it up he pours oil on it this act of consecrating and it gives so many different applications to God's house to us and when he says this is the house of God the word that he uses for house this is just language so what I'm sharing to you here is just language we wouldn't just build this principle on this alone but the word that's used for house in the Old Testament refers to the human body or can ref refer to a Dwelling Place such as a home or a house that contains the family or it can refer to a temple this is the house of God and it could be uh this word house could be used of a person's body the individual or the house that they live in or the temple that they would Worship in and so this is kind of the picture that I've been chasing now even through some series we were on last year I just feel like I'm right at the cusp of getting into some things that have been very burdensome upon my heart but I want you to consider your body your house your residence where you live and your church as the Gates of Heaven I want you to first look at yourself as in your body now you say well is the body the gate to heaven well we know the soul we emphasize that over and over is the soul but now I want you to look at your person and who you are you're a three room house and you are a gate to heaven and as the word bethl uses the word house it can also relate to a home that you live in so where you live whether it be an apartment whether it be a room in in some other house whatever it might be or a home that you rent or a home that you own regardless of where you live or you live in an office or live in your car are the place where you dwell and you spend your time we look at that as a place where my possessions are a place where my heart is we call that also look at that as a Gate of Heaven and then also your church where you go to church you should think of your church in some in as the house of the Lord amen you should look at your church the church you go to as a place I want you to think of it this way as a Gate of Heaven these three things your body your house and your church as the Gates of Heaven in 1 Corinthians chapter 6:9 this is just the review uh from other services but now wanting to use these tonight says in 1 Corinthians chapter 6:9 know ye not that your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you which you have of God and ye are not your own we have been baptized with the baptism of the Holy Ghost uh that anointing oil as it was has been poured out upon us and so now we are as a a building we have been Anointed with oil we've been consecrated we've been dedicated and he says says that we are the Temple of the Holy Ghost that when that Soul has been sealed through the new birth it God dwells there and Paul says your body is the house of the Lord your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost brother Brandon when he's preaching the statue of a perfect man if you go and read those scriptures and listen to that sermon he makes a statement similar to this in several places but this was this title building the living Tabernacle of the Living God Dwelling Place the perfect man the living Tabernacle of the Living God where he dwells building the living Tabernacle of the living God's Dwelling Place the perfect man the living Tabernacle of the Living God where he dwells and he just doesn't relate it to Christ but he says this is the building that God is doing in us that we want to be a Dwelling Place how to be a Dwelling Place of his Spirit how to be a Powerhouse for God and all those different things that's expressed in them and so as we read Sunday in 1 Peter chapter 2:5 ye also as Lively Stones live living stones are built up a spiritual house and a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ you are an anointed Stone uh oil has been poured out upon you that oil of the Holy Ghost sealed into your heart your body your life has been Anointed with the baptism of the Holy Ghost and you are a living Stone you are a spiritual house so as Jacob said oh this is none other than the house of God and this is the Gate of Heaven you as in that house of God you become a portal you become a Gate of Heaven brother B saiding you are God's house living walking around manifesting the Living God for he dwells not in temples made with hands but a body hast thou prepared me you are God's letter a written epistle God is in you manifesting himself through that's what we are this these are the very things that you are to be that's the ultimate and in the sermon why Christ speak if you could could just focus on this for a moment here he says but there's only one real church and you don't join it right too bad there's only one real church and you don't join it you're born into it by one Spirit you're baptized into the body of Christ so he's saying there's only one real church and if you're born in it the Living God works himself through you in making himself known so now you now God if once you're born into that church God works through He makes himself known through you now if you'll think about that there is one true church that true church is his body that true church is the bride and we have this thought well then that's where God is he's in his church he's in his people and He makes himself known through the church and I know immediately in our minds we start thinking of an entity where God's going to make himself known maybe a church off of some road or or some building somewhere some special meeting like through that edifice and through that structure and through that building and it's local government govern and its Pastor the special speaker that's where God makes himself known but he has no means of making himself known through the church except through you and your life and how you live and what you say and what you lift up says that's where God dwells in his church God goes to church every day just lives in church am he lives in you God goes to church every day just lives in church he lives in you you are his church you are are his church you are the Tabernacle that God dwells in so God goes to church every day least we could do is couple times a week right he goes to church every day he dwells in church he just lives in church and he's saying that's you so in my in my the way I see this it's that's the ultimate that God that Christ would live in you and since it's certainly not practical us not being God for us to live every be here every day and just live in church all the time and go to church every day we do this even showing what God does in us he Tabernacles in us so going to church is just a reflection of what God's done for me and maybe that's why people don't go to church says you are his church you are the Tabernacle that God dwells in you are the Church of the Living God yourself then he kind of tightens this down quite a bit if you if the Living God lives in his living being then your action is of God if it isn't then God isn't in there it challenges us to be then if I'm his church I then I want to reflect him well I know that you know we've all been in the message long enough to hear it whether it be just a rumor or whether it be from our neighbor in the apartment next door how that many times some Churches want you to do things because they're really at the end of the day concerned about their image they whether they tell you just to come as you are and you can wear shorts and flip-flops do whatever you want they want to appear cool and hip to everyone else and they're asking you to do things not to please the Lord but to be instagrammable or they tell you to do certain things because people are watching they don't want to be perceived a certain way and so there's this idea well the pretense of well we don't want to make the church look bad but I tell you there's something better than that is to have a real genuine experience of the new birth and know that my life what I say what I do how I dress and how I live is somehow reflecting upon God and I don't want to be a wrong reflection of who he is if we concerned ourselves with that we wouldn't have to worry about the reputation of a church because it's God in there he says he wouldn't make you act like that when he says in the word his blueprint don't do it there's our challenge the word says something we do it if it says not to do something we don't do it you go do it he says see that's wrong when you deny it then that shows the life isn't even in you I acknowledge it that kind of pulls it down tight but it's challenging to us to recognize that the Life of Christ inside of me lives The Life of Christ and it would be my own human nature that would be manifesting anything different and if you can't express his life if you can't express his nature and character then one ought to examine themselves so our body is the Bible showing it is a temple of the Lord and and and I know there's so much we can keep talking about that so many scriptures I'm repeating some of the same ones just so that we uh maybe don't get caught up in going through even more verses but your body is a temple of the Lord and now I want to take this a step further and say your home should be too and the church ought to be that they ought to be Gates of Heaven and there is a duty as it is as we've already read that your body is the temple of the Lord and he's admonishing them even in that very chapter that you ought not to defile the Temple of the lord your body is a temple don't defile it there's a duty for us to consecrate and to set aside our home or our house as a home and also the church different rules regarding uh different things that are taught in the message of the hour different scriptures that speak to how the home ought to be operated and it's telling us that yeah you are a temple of the Holy Ghost but now also you live in that house and you live in a place this is where you reside you lay down your head this is a place that you're identified with this is the place where you're raising your children and where you go to church these are places that they too like you ought to be set aside we have things that rules and governments and and things in the word of God and how to keep our home and even how to keep the church there's things that we don't do in the sanctuary there's things that we try to do in preparation for service and it's all because we recognize a sacredness of these things 1 Timothy 3:5 Paul in these parenthetical phrase as it is in our translation for if a man know not how to rule his own house how shall he take care of the Church of God well Paul is doing and speaking about the qualifications to to rule the Church of God and he's talking about the local church he kind of draws this parallel and this connection between the home life and Church Life and he doesn't Begin by saying hey if the guy's a really good pastor then he'll Ru rule his home well he said no if the guy if the guy can rule his home then he'll know how to rule the house of God because there's a certain fac that you can put on at church but when it really gets real it's how a man lives at home that really speaks to his qualifications in his own family in his own marriage speaks to his qualification for caring for the Church of God so he saying your home life and the way things are at home if he can rule his own house then he is able to take care of the Church of God Amen and that asks the question if he's unable to rule his own house if he doesn't know how to rule his own house it's very clear that he cannot take care of the Church of God that's right and therefore we must rule not only our bodies but also our homes and we need to do so if we want the church to be right it's not our responsibility and I'm not trying to Sherk responsibility today and say well it's not on me guys it's on you but it's not the responsibility of the deacons and the pastor to get everything perfect here so that you guys can escape imperfection and come to a perfect church and feel like all right we're doing our part in a really good place but rather the strength of this church relies upon the individuals who gather inside of it it relies upon the heads of homes it relies upon even the young men who are single and living lives single they don't have accountability where they live and how they conduct themselves and the places they go and the things they feed on there's a lot of ways there's finger pointing and everything he can point right back at you there's a lot of ways that we do things and we say things and we explore things that it's incumbent upon us from the top down all of us that the way what we think about the things we live on the things that we pursue it's the things that take place outside of the church that are going to determine the strength of the church because our heart is a home for heaven and therefore if our heart is a home for heaven then I would argue and that is this is that what I'm positing tonight is that our house then must be a home for us if I'm a spiritual being if I'm a if I'm one that has is bearing the presence of God in my life and I have I have the Holy Ghost and I have a spiritual consciousness and brother Braham said you are the Church of the Living God you are God's Dwelling Place you are the Temple of the Lord then as a as a temple I would want to have an atmosphere that I could live in I I would want to have a home that has the token applied to it I would want to have a certain structure and a certain emphasis and I'd want it to be a certain way to where it's a refuge I believe when we were preaching in the series our family tree how that we would come to a sanctuary at church and we enjoy our fellowship and this music and the presence of God and the things that we get from one another but we don't want to have this kind of dread where we leave this Sanctuary to go home uh uh uh to hell hole we want to go from one Sanctuary to the next and that's how homes ought to be structured and that we would want our house and our living quarters and where we live and where we stay that there'd be some sacredness to it not that it would become like church where you tell Siri to turn on the pre-service music on your way home and then by the time you get home it's been playing for a while and you have to get real legalistic about it but there's just a Consciousness that you know what this is a Dwelling Place th this is where I live this is where my thoughts come together this is where I try to get away from the world and there's a ought to be an attention to detail in those things I I have one of the places that brother bam tells the story printed out in front of me I think just kind of reading it might might lose a little bit of my momentum this evening but I'm sure that most of you remember the story that brother bam tells where he had married a rich couple and then he had also married a poor couple and I was doing some research this week on EV night and the new Al and the places they even this neighborhood that brother BR refers to as Silver Hills uh quite extraordinary pieces of property and an amazing neighborhood eeve night was very successful uh prior to the depression in and Manufacturing uh siding for houses and things like that so he brother br's talking about how he had a daughter that married uh Herman Holtz I believe is his name and it was a friend of brother Brams and and he's telling this he's going to tell a story of that that rich man this young man who married this rich man's daughter and lived in Silver Hills a and big huge beautiful homes and then this other couple that lived in a box carart down by the river not a van but a box carart and and brother brandham says that he he opens this story in some places and happiness doesn't consist in the amount of things that you have in this world and how much of the world's Goods you own but how contented you are with the portion that's given to you that's kind of the thing that he expresses and he's talks about I know this one sharp intelligent man who married a Millionaire's daughter and the door knobs he says we're 14 kid in their home so he said there's this one man who married well and had a really really nice house but then he said I did another ceremony and this boy that he married he said just within a short period of time after that the boy didn't have enough money to get married on and the girl didn't have enough money to pay the preacher and his brother said hey his brother knew him and said my my brother will marry the couple and he said when he come to marry him it was during the time of depression he said his old washed out pair of trousers an old shirt one collar piece of collar buttoned higher than the other he's just describing this disheveled kid probably put on his best didn't know how to button it up like I've never had this many buttons before which one goes where haircut needed he said he needed it bad he said the girl hitch hike from Indianapolis her feet were on the ground he said I felt like buying that poor child that child a pair of shoes and he said well where are you going to live he goes he he said he had an old box car down by the river where they used to do an old dial Iron Works and he said I'm just going to live down there and I said what are you going to do if this job Runs Out you don't have anything she says I love them just the same and he's just thinking wow this is this is quite a couple and but then he says one day he goes to visit his friends in Silver Hills and he goes to visit them the eeve knight's daughter and Herman Holtz and he goes he said had a nice home they had plenty of money he said that they were sitting when he came up he walked on he said one was sitting one corner the other in the other corner and he said they were fussing they were in a big huge fight in this particular reading he's not describing the home in great detail but you could you you can go search civil Hills in in New Albany just a platial home 14 karat whatever uh door knobs in the home H this is this is extraordinary and he he kind of walks up on them and they're fighting they've been fussing the way they were living their lives it brought discontentment in the home and then he shows up and they real quick kind of grabbed their hands together and wanted to put on a front here's the preacher that married me so we want to put on an affront for him and he said are you happy oh yes dear aren't we right aren't we happy completely forgot all about the dance the night before and he goes I knew they were fussing and yet and they went on and you couldn't see it wasn't right the spirit didn't feel right here they are saying the right things but he knows the spirit's not right in that home but he says one day I thought I'd find out what had become of this couple that I married that lived in a box car and he talks about how he's working for the service company he's going to make his way down there and he's going to find his place path to where they were and he said that um this boy worked for a Lumber Company and he said he had an old box car and they put newspapers up and tacky buttons and he asked if anybody knew what a tacky button is does anybody know what a tacky button is and brother Brandon would say well what part of Kentucky are you from anyhow because apparently people who knew what that was were from Kentucky take cardboard he said they put a tack in it push it into the wall and they put up paper and newspapers This Is How They furred out and finished out the inside of an old train car he had bought some brought down some old boxes and they had made a table out of it he says and this is where the quote is here he says' but brother if I'd ever found a heaven on Earth it was if I'd ever found a heaven on Earth it was not walking through the place that had the really nice gate and the 14 karat door knobs and the the Millionaire's daughter and a a nice intelligent good-look young man on the inside but he calls this box car with newspaper as wallpaper with box of old boxes as a table and chairs and he says brother if I ever found heaven on Earth it was brother Braham dramatizes how from that vantage point he could look up and turn around this way and look to the top of the hill and see one home of the other the top of one home the Steeples on top of the house and then look at the box car and his question was who is the rich man but notice what he says about this home it might not have had a lot of amenities it might it wasn't even a home let's just be technical wasn't a house it was a box car but yet somehow they took a box car how cold and hard and and how much it would have lacked but yet brother Bram said they made an old box car heaven on Earth and I say that to express this ideal tonight just as much as our body is a temple of the Holy Ghost and we could call ourselves the Gates of Heaven as being the very place where God dwells and where God manifests himself written Epistles and and and the manifestation of the Living God we could say that our house can be a home for heaven a place where God is welcome and this is something to a Spire or two that our home can be a place that when other people come they find that the atmosphere in our home is different it can be a a Gate of Heaven where we as the church live and others can be at the very foot of Heaven themselves that they too can meet Christ in your home that might be the most effective tool of witnessing and not necessar just to invite them to church but when they're with you you're a Gate of Heaven that your life is lived in such a way to where something's beckoning them there's Angels descending now to this portal in this place and you're a bear of heaven and they find themselves coming in contact with heaven and that your home likewise could be a place that when people are in that home like it's different here has a different vibe to it I could tell that this isn't like all other homes and that would not only be in the way that it's laid out necessarily and and the things that are in it but even the atmosphere that you provide in that home because you are the church and where is the church it lives in that home home and I could even just kind of point that your children live there other family may live there from time to time people come visit your your house if I could put it this way this will maybe be a theme that we'll try to pick up here soon your house can be made a home also a home for the supernatural a Gate of Heaven 1 Timothy chapter 3 we read about how he was drawn that parallel how a man who rules his house could take care of the Church of God all right is asking if a man can't rule his own house then how can he rule the Church of God because I believe it's incumbent upon all of us as men to rule our house whether we rule the house of God or not it is something that we ought to do and in verse 15 he says but if I T long that thou mayest know how that thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God which is the Church of the Living God the pillar and ground of the truth we'll amplify this more later tonight I just I have just a few more things to share with you and be finished and the scripture has a lot of detail we can bring into it but he brings in the church which we've read about brother BR says you're born into the Church of the Living God and there's only one church God lives in his church God goes to church every day uh that is the Church of the Living God he calls it the pillar and ground of Truth well that's a statement to chew on a little bit to ponder some that the pillar and ground of truth that is the Church of the Living God but he also brings in the if I could say the local Gathering into view at the same time that you might know how you ought to behave yourself in the house of God that has something to do with the Church of the Living God which is the pillar and ground of truth because the local church itself and its government its structure and its location is not the pillar and ground of truth but it is a Gathering Place for those who are part of the Church of God as we said before this church serves the true church this church isn't the true church otherwise I would have just called it true church or the true church and all the others are Impostors right I mean that has to be what it is if you want to call it that but it's not the true church yet it serves the true church we are a church because there are churches who are the living place of God who are the individuals who are God's church and God's dwelling place that come to church that the Holy Spirit leads them to be in service and so God has churches to receive the members of the true church if there was no the church we shouldn't even have a church puts things into perspective we read this it may have been in part one on this series in the sermon why I fa just to read it again tonight CU he gives an emphasis here he says because there's no joy in the house of the Lord why do people are not overcoming and why things are the way they are why don't people go to church is it because you don't find Joy there what makes a person want to drink and run around and act like that is it because we don't have any God is it because there's no joy in the house of the Lord anymore that that's good that's a good question why do people fall away and why do things get cold and get things get stagnant he said is it because there's no joy in the house of the Lord anymore is it because the Holy Spirit isn't ready to bless all of us is there anything wrong with it is there anything wrong with God nope anything wrong with the word nope anything wrong with the Holy Ghost nope something's got to be wrong somewhere but because that we do it that's the reason we're cursed that's the reason God's puts this thing upon the church this cold and dampness we're going to other places for pleasure instead of the coming to the house of the Lord for pleasure I what a checkup you say well I come to the house of the Lord I'm checking the box I'm there I'm a good message Catholic I'm there I'm checking the boxes I'm doing the stations this is what a message uh believer does but if you're not coming to the house of the Lord for pleasure but you're going to all the other houses and and and opportunities and extravaganzas and invitations and attractions if you're going there for pleasure but yet you go to church and you're not finding your pleasure there if your one thing desired isn't found in this house but you find all the other Desires in other places that's why that's how a church get cold it's the reason why God puts the cold and dampness on the church it's because people don't want to be there anymore for the right thing that's how they go in the ruts and and and and the presence of the Lord leaves it and it's just routine and it's just up and down it's the roller coaster the up and down because people are going to other places for pleasure and he doesn't say they're forsaking to go to the house of the Lord but they don't go for pleasure then he says the house of the Lord is the Joy the Lord the house of the Lord is where God finds joy amen there's something satisfying to the Lord to have a house where he can dwell then he says the joy of the Lord is the joy of his people so the house ought to be something that gives Joy there's something that stimulates Joy he says he wants you to to come to church and to worship him and be happy and satisfied give him praise and honor and glory and wisdom and might and power to God he wants you to do that this should be a thesis statement for every service that we come to church to worship him and to be happy and satisfied giving praise and honor and glory and wisdom and might and power to God this is what church ought to be we ought to have these elements in it if this church doesn't have it all then all let's get serious about seeing it come to church to worship Him be happy satisfied you ought to be happy to come to church I know what it's like to dread going to church that's no way God wants a Believer to live I believe that there's a certain trauma that's inflicted into a spirit of a Believer every time they go to the house of the Lord in dread fearful of what will be swn into them with complexes already being beaten into them and they go and it's wound after wound after wound When God says that we're to be happy when we go to church we ought to be satisfied when we're leaving there's such a trauma to a person's Spirit they begin to express certain physical maladies and problems because they're not getting the satisfaction they should from the house the Lord about to be honor glory and wisdom and might and the power of God he says he wants you to do that he wants us to go to church brother Bram in the sermon the unchangeable word of God he says the Bible says these signs shall follow them that believe and I believe that go read that these signs shall follow them that believe we know where he put it in the Bible and he never took it away he says God makes a distinction he gives a mark on the people if he believes these signs shall follow them that believe that's right the believer not that they say they believe or not the supposed believer but the real believer says I want to belong to a church that's got them signs and wonders following it now make sure they're biblical right make sure they're scriptural make sure they're according to scripture but he said I want a church that's got scriptural signs and wonders following it that's where I want to have my fellowship right under the blood of Jesus Christ notice what he says about the about church cuz he's being very clear he's not saying I want to go to heaven he's not saying he wants to go to the temple in Jerusalem he's saying I want to go to a church this is going to a local church this is a place that a Believer finds himself wanting to be place where he just said we ought to go to church and he wants you to come to church and worship him he says I want to belong to church that's got signs that's where I want to have my fellowship we're angels and powers and Holy Ghost and God works back and forth through his church through his people showing signs and wonders says why it's the greatest thing I've ever not my life it's a part of Heaven on Earth look at that Cemetery where a man and a woman living in poverty in a box car down by the river could have what brother said if I've ever found a heaven on Earth it was in the arrangement of a man to a woman in a and a box car that wasn't even a proper house but yet brother man sister there was a home where there was Heaven on Earth and then he could say of a church no matter what its address whether no matter what if it's composition he could say a place where the Holy Ghost moves and works God works back and forth It's a gate Holy Spirit descending coming angels and powers of the Holy Ghost coming to the church working through his people showing signs and W says it's a part of Heaven on Earth Church ought to be a place where Heaven makes himself known on Earth again it's a gate I feel like I'm pre I've been preaching like 13 minutes and then I I look and I know probably been preaching fast enough to fill 13 hours and I look at the clock it's time to stop I don't know how this happens what I don't it's the mic I know it it's got to be the mic this not you brother Mike or is it the mic but as we just try to tie this together and I've been looking at a lot of different places where brother BR talks about God's house even went down a rabbit Trail in Phoenix history here recently where brother Bam's referring to he's in an auditorium and he says this is God's house he's in an auditorium and I've gone back and I've read newspaper clippings from the 30s and 20s of what's held in this Auditorium it was a a law it was a Auditorium put together H for a place of amusement and and other people could rent and things could be expressed but BR say now it's a place that's been set aside for the word to go forth for angels to descend the power of God to move he says this is the house of God and a place that may be used for something totally different when eyes are turned towards heaven and the holy spirit's made welcome it could become a heaven on Earth and if God could do that in an auditorium look what God did service after service at the Hilton Garden in at the Marriott service after service if God could turn a hotel room and I remember I had this in my heart every time we would gather we might not know what happened in the Saturday night before sometimes we did and we were like oh boy that's interesting but we had this confidence to know that what they did the night before wasn't greater than what my God could do and we knew that God had ordained that ground for us to come together in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and where we were he would be there also and we believe that when we gathered that was the house of God and the presence of God would come and I want you to think if a hotel room that's used for weddings and sell seminars and there's this yo-yo back and forth from a Wednesday to a Sunday and all sorts of other nonsense that takes place can be turned into the house of God how much more can we transform our own homes into a house of God and not be afraid of the change that we can make within our own Dwelling Place you may not have much say what you can do in the rest of the house but you could turn your bedroom into a place that's consecrated I mean these words and we ought to feel the same way about this church it ought to be be a place where we're happy and satisfied to come a place where the praise of God the honor and glory and wisdom and the might of God is welcome place where the power of God moves and because it because it's that's so we have a we have a respect for it when we come we come expecting to hear from God because it's a Gate of Heaven I am the Church of God and here I am coming to a house of God where God wants to speak to me talk about omnipotence meeting talk about how we we might we might be wanting to check what the speed limmit is so we could hurry up a little bit and get to church right I don't want to drive below the speed limit what is it I want to hit it I want to get there I want and have this excitement to be in church and say well why what's the whole point do you even know what it is do you even know what it can do very reason why I was using the tagline kids eat free my whole rationale and justification and my vision in sharing that was to get you thinking about it but there's a parallel among the three gates your body which we say your body it's who you are your three- room house Body Spirit soul and because the Lord lives down in that Soul guess what the house it was called the house of the Lord but the Lord wasn't walking around the outer Court he was in the inner court or in the holies of holies so there's a parallel among these three gates that we can begin to see and recognize and we could use it to bring certain things out that there's things that's true of the local church that are just a type of the family and there's things that are true of the temple that are just a type of you as an individual but these parallels among the three gates the body your house where you live your residence your room your apartment whatever it might be in the church and your home life ought to reflect the hidden life the way that we dress the way that we act reflects the hidden life and then the home life ought to reflect the hidden life and the church ought to reflect the Life of Christ and I believe as I've already me mentioned this I believe that the church exist to promote the health and well-being of your body and your home and not so much just your physical body but that too there's a lot of things that we could teach from the house of God to correct Us in the way that we even keep our natural bodies there's a lot of things that could be taught uh that relate to things that relate to mental health and physical health and I believe the church exists with an idea that it must give resources and minister to the needs of the individual and to the home life the family because we need all three this is kind of where I'm wanting to wrap this up we need all three we need to have a body otherwise who who are you we need we need that home otherwise we have no place to live and we need a church because together they constitute in that three that three room house three different elements of our existence your soul think of this your soul which has been sealed by God that is that's the real you as brother BR calls it that's the that's the me that's the US the individual it's inner it's the most private that's where you know who you really are deep down in your soul no matter how much we wrestle in our spirit sometimes as a result of Disobedience or stubbornness or everything there's just a place we come to deep down in our soul brother even desing it at one time just like maybe the sliver of her fingernail but once your Anchor's there you realize no I know I'm a Son of God I know I'm a daughter of God and that's the inner part that's the private part that's where the faith is but then even as we have a spirit that's the part that other people get to know a little bit your personality it's it's still personal but and and but yet some of it's hidden not so much from everybody but your spirit is even indicative of the house people come into your home they get to know you a little bit better they learn certain things about you I don't know why this just pops in my mind but you want know some houses just have a smell to it right and it's not that it's bad but you're like that's the meiri smell right and uh and like man if they ever made a candle just don't ever buy it for me or something like that right there there's just a scent that some people have and we associate so there's a there's the you in the soul but then there's also a spirit that's a you that other people know they don't know you in the soul just like your house becomes an extension of who you are it's hidden from the world it's personal but yet people can be invited into it you can see the outer court and then you have your body that's visible it's public other people can see it other people can make judgments about you based upon your body and how tall you are how short you are and boy he's short he must have a little man's complex or you know there's just certain things that people could try to say he's tall he must play basketball and there's things that people conclude and things they could know about you and things that they can see that's public and you can even see in that Soul spirit and body there's a lot of things that we could see in these parallels among them how that even the body that's the church this is it's open to the public people could come and they can see and they can experience things they can relate to it and people drive by they see the church they see how we keep up with the property they can see the services online everyone can PE into this not the same way that others could into someone's home and certainly not the way that someone knows your life privately and so you can see Soul spirit and body even laid out in these different rooms and these different Gates brother Bram says in the sermon and it not he says that's three rings three circles it's where he The Body Spirit Soul he said that's you and he says that's God God and a trinity is one and without a trinity he's not God he can't be manifested any other way and neither can you be manifested without being the Trinity that you are the Trinity person that you are that's Body Spirit Soul so you have to have all three to be manifested without either one of them you are not complete you didn't have a soul you'd be nothing you didn't have a spirit you wouldn't be nothing you didn't have a body you'd just be a spirit not a body and what I'm wanting to say and not that anyone would overthink this and try to over type it or try to be legalistic with it but if we don't have these three gates something's missing if he doesn't If he if we are not a Gate of Heaven our souls aren't sealed you could have a house and you could have a CH church but without it you're nothing and you could have you could say I have the Holy Ghost and you could have a home but yet you don't have a church something's missing he says you can't be manifested without being a trinity person that you are without any one of them you're not complete and could we not say that yet even as an individual I could recognize the need for these places the need for these things the strength of my own spiritual well-being as an individual the atmosphere and the condition of my home and a happy place where I'm satisfied to go as a church and I believe as I I say this and just rounding it out got a couple more scriptures and a statement to read from the message we have a duty to consecrate these Gates we have a duty to make these Gates of Heaven and not gates of hell we have duty to consecrate these Gates and these houses as homes to God we become Gates of Heaven our body me as a person my home and my church remember what we read about a gate Gate of Heaven was a meeting place a gate was an entrance it was a meeting place place of authority a place of judging a place where others can have access to God a place to see God manifested a place to receive the truth that's what we ought to be and say I want to be a Gate of Heaven my life let my life me as an individual my words the things I seek the way I live the way I dress let it be a Gate of Heaven our distinction that God gives us in our distinction as men and women and and even the way that we individually live it out as brothers and sisters he does it so that we can be identified as a Gate of Heaven but because these are to be Gates of Heaven me as an individual Christian my home life and my church the gates are what the enemy attacks he wants to that's where he wants to find uh he wants to make us vulnerable and weaken us because that's where he can have access in Ezekiel CH 21:15 he says I've set the point point of the sword against all their Gates it's referring to this act of pointing the sword toward their gates in this particular passage as I was reading and studying on it he's not only just saying my sword is at the gates of the city but it's at the gates of your Palace and at the gates of your home it's not just going to be the city structurally that's going to be punished but the palace The Authority is going to be punished the homes are going to be punished it referred to the city the palace and their houses why because they're all have Gates and these are things that we must guard we must strengthen things that we must be aware of that these are Gates of Heaven my life my home my church these are Gates of Heaven and and I want to be conscious of them we must guard these Gates my body my house my church in Psalms 147: 12 and 13 praise the Lord oh Jerusalem praise thy God o Zion for he ha strengthened the bars of thy Gates Heath blessed thy children within thee this is the secret to even strengthening relationships with our children and as our children are reared I've blessed thy children within thee because he strengthened the gates I I the Gates of Heaven whether it be myself my home the physical house or the church we've got to have all three strong and again I'm not trying to Sher responsibility uh because if anything I'm taking on more responsibility I believe in my heart and that begins the strength of a church is directly reflected in the strength of the individuals and the strength of the family so as a church I want to strengthen those and willing to take responsibility if there's weakness say all right we need to do better we need to try harder as a church but let's all take responsibility to strengthen the gates and think about what these Gates mean the Gates of Heaven and how that God wants all your gates to belong to him God hiding himself in Simplicity then revealing himself in the same we've read this recently we've read it several times but he says now I think it's our duty to make the inside right by the grace of God to be so grateful to God it's our duty he's talking about the Tabernacle he's talking about a recent Remodel and he says man they do a lot to make the outside look good and I was even just looking at some pictures of what this church looked like when we first rented it you remember the 30x30 red carpet red chairs the the portal to the 80s that it was and and and we were happy maybe we've done a lot to make things look better even on the outside it doesn't even look the same anymore things that have been done and by the help of Agape Church our landlords and and just everyone working together the labor the trustees and those that have given there's been a lot of things made right but then he says we have a duty to make the inside right by the grace of God and when he says that he doesn't mean just alone in the physical upkeep of the building but yet the ATM spere the thing that really makes house a home he said this will just not only be a beautiful building that we come to but may everyone who comes in see the beautiful characteristic of Jesus Christ and every person that comes in church after church such like on a you say well people say well how many people were at church on Sunday we we say we don't count people anymore we count churches there was aund 50 churches there on Sunday people like wait what what in the world I was at a meeting one time where a brother had all the ministers stand up in the meeting and so about maybe 30 Brothers stood up in the meeting and the next night he asked again and the same Brothers like oh well here we are again and stood up again and the third time third meeting he had it happen again he goes there was 30 the first night 30 the second night 30 tonight there was 90 ministers represented the building we're like it's the same 30 every night but maybe we could have even that kind of added to us I'm Church coming to church that this is a place where people can see the beautiful characteristic of the Church of Jesus Christ and each family and how it conducts himself in each individual he says may it be a consecrated place to our Lord a consecrated people I'm talking about the Gates of Heaven as us as individuals and now even the church itself and our homes may it be a consecrated place to our Lord as he's talking about the physical Church to be a consecrated place he says a consecrated people for no matter how beautiful the structure is that we certainly do appreciate the beauty of the church is the character of the people I trust it'll always be a house of God of beauty let me be a house of God where people could see the beauty of the Lord as David said one thing have I desired Lord that will I seek after that I may dwell in the house Lord all the days of my life to inquire in his Temple to behold the beauty of the Lord let me be a bear of God's Beauty the beauty of the church is the character of the people therefore I want my life to be seasoned I want it to be working towards a glory I want it to be expressing the right kind of things and emphasizing the right kind of thing because my life expresses the beauty of Christ's character and as he prayed this for brandom Tabernacle I pray it for you as individuals I pray it for your houses that they could be homes and I pray it for Arizona Believers Church that the beauty of this church would be the character of the people that it would always be a house of God's Beauty will you stand with me this evening bow our heads in prayer that it would be a house of God's Beauty
