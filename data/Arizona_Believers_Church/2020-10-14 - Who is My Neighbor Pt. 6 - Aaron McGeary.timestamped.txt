[0:00] matthew chapter 23 verses 1 to 7
[0:03] then spake jesus to the multitude and to
[0:06] his disciples saying
[0:08] the scribes and the pharisees sit in
[0:10] moses's seat
[0:12] all therefore whatsoever they bid you
[0:13] observe that observe and do
[0:16] but do not ye after their works for they
[0:18] say and do not
[0:20] for they bind heavy burdens and grievous
[0:21] to be born and lay them on men's
[0:23] shoulders
[0:24] but they themselves will not move them
[0:26] with one of their fingers
[0:27] but all their works they do for to be
[0:30] seen of men
[0:31] they make broad their phylacteries and
[0:33] enlarge the borders of their garments
[0:34] and
[0:35] love the uppermost rooms at feast and
[0:37] the chief seats in the synagogues
[0:39] and greetings in the markets and to be
[0:41] called of men rabbi
[0:42] rabbi let's bow our heads in a word of
[0:44] prayer our gracious heavenly father lord
[0:47] we're grateful to be gathered together
[0:48] this evening in your house
[0:50] lord we've appreciated the worship lord
[0:52] just even the the continuity of the
[0:54] specials that were sung
[0:56] and lord just having those things
[0:58] ringing in our hearts as truth lord
[1:00] we've been our hearts have been prepared
[1:02] to receive your word
[1:03] lord we trust and and no lord that
[1:06] you're here present with us to divide
[1:08] to us our portion tonight to distribute
[1:10] to us the bread of life
[1:12] so come now lord take control this
[1:13] service for your glory
[1:15] as we commit it to you in the name of
[1:16] the lord jesus christ we pray
[1:18] amen amen you may be seated
[1:24] i'd like to continue with the subject of
[1:27] who is my neighbor
[1:29] and we have drawn it from luke chapter
[1:31] 10
[1:32] and i think i might just uh touch on
[1:35] that just very quickly
[1:37] and how that jesus is asked
[1:40] in regards to eternal life and the
[1:43] question
[1:44] being posed to him he answers
[1:49] in this that question he's one of the
[1:51] lawyers says unto him master thus saying
[1:54] thou reproach us
[1:55] also and um he's talking about even in
[1:58] luke chapter 11 actually i just wanted
[2:00] to refer to how he rebukes these lawyers
[2:02] he says woe unto you also you lawyers
[2:03] free laid men with burdens
[2:05] grievous to be born and ye yourselves
[2:07] touch not
[2:08] the burdens of one of your fingers and
[2:11] so this is the continuity in luke
[2:12] chapter 11
[2:14] how jesus addresses this and he's
[2:16] looking at how they have um
[2:19] the the admiration of men before them
[2:23] and they're not considering the things
[2:24] of the lord and i'm just trying to
[2:28] find a spot here to launch from
[2:31] because i had some things i wanted to
[2:33] share and just trying to get my order
[2:35] together
[2:36] i'm not nervous so you shouldn't be i'm
[2:39] i'm at home today i'm not worried
[2:41] uh i don't usually eat my dessert before
[2:43] my meal and if it looks like i'm doing
[2:44] that maybe i got things a little bit out
[2:45] of order
[2:46] but in luke chapter 10 jesus also is
[2:48] rebuking the scribes and the pharisees
[2:50] he often calls them hypocrites
[2:52] but it's in luke chapter 10 where we see
[2:55] the question
[2:56] is asked of who is my neighbor in verse
[2:59] 29 luke chapter 10 verse 29
[3:01] says who is my neighbor and he asked
[3:03] this question wanting to justify himself
[3:05] and it's then that jesus gives the
[3:07] parable of the good samaritan
[3:10] and so i wanted to take a moment tonight
[3:12] just to kind of back up a little bit
[3:15] and go back over what it was what we
[3:18] have covered so far
[3:19] in the first few parts so that we could
[3:22] kind of see the
[3:22] um where we've been and then maybe even
[3:24] give you a little bit of a
[3:26] pointing of a direction to where we're
[3:27] going to be and so the question we're
[3:29] pondering is who is my neighbor
[3:31] we recognize that this question is asked
[3:33] by a lawyer in regards to eternal life
[3:35] and then jesus gives the parable of the
[3:37] good samaritan in order for us to think
[3:40] and to ponder
[3:41] who our neighbor is in order to
[3:42] challenge even a lawyer on some of his
[3:44] assumptions
[3:44] so in part one we talked about the right
[3:46] foundation
[3:48] and how you have to lay the right
[3:49] foundation and looking at the right
[3:51] foundation
[3:52] we were considering how we're asking
[3:54] ourselves who is my neighbor
[3:56] not to do as the lawyer did to
[3:57] self-justify but rather to
[3:59] understand our calling and so in looking
[4:01] at that in the first part we really
[4:03] challenged
[4:04] this mechanism of self-justification how
[4:07] man wants to be right he's usually right
[4:08] in his own eyes
[4:09] and this is what was motivating the
[4:11] lawyer to ask that clarifying question
[4:13] in the second part we looked at how
[4:15] eternal life is living for others
[4:18] and this lawyer initially begins to
[4:20] inquire about eternal life
[4:22] and and he's wanting to know uh what
[4:25] shall i do to inherit eternal life in
[4:27] verse 25
[4:28] jesus says well what does the law say he
[4:30] says well to love god and then
[4:31] and to love thy neighbor as thyself and
[4:33] then when he's he asked
[4:35] go and do that's right you've done well
[4:37] he says who is my neighbor
[4:38] and then jesus gives the parable the
[4:40] good samaritan they haven't left the
[4:42] subject of eternal life because eternal
[4:44] life is living for others and we saw
[4:46] that symmetry
[4:46] even in the original question and the
[4:48] parable and then in part three
[4:51] we were looking at how that one of the
[4:54] remarkable characteristics that's often
[4:55] expressed about brother branham is you
[4:57] couldn't tell
[4:58] who is his friend and who is his enemy
[5:00] by the way that he treated people
[5:02] so it wasn't suggested that he had no
[5:03] idea who his friends were had no idea
[5:05] who his enemies were
[5:06] it was you on the outside couldn't tell
[5:08] by how he treated people with respect
[5:10] and courtesy
[5:11] that you couldn't tell who his friend
[5:13] was or who his enemy was
[5:14] and that we also want to be able to have
[5:16] that kind of character
[5:18] to where people don't just look at how
[5:19] you're acting and how you're treating
[5:21] somebody
[5:21] and say well we can tell they're not
[5:23] friends but rather know
[5:25] do as the scripture says love thy enemy
[5:27] as
[5:28] thyself and then in part four we were
[5:30] saying don't be a thief
[5:32] and we're looking at how that we offend
[5:34] people
[5:35] and also how we treat those who are
[5:37] offended and even looking at some of the
[5:38] different levels to backsliding and
[5:41] that's where we were
[5:42] at last week in looking at the concept
[5:44] of backsliding and how there can have a
[5:46] bruised cell or bruised seed
[5:48] and to backslide actually means you can
[5:50] be repulsed or pushed away so often if
[5:52] we talk about a backslider oh they chose
[5:54] to do this they're just reaping what
[5:55] they sow
[5:56] but a seed can be bruised and when it's
[5:58] bruised it backslides and then they take
[6:00] a path that
[6:01] they didn't really want to go down and
[6:03] one that's not even in character with
[6:05] their true calling or their true
[6:06] election
[6:07] and so we can call them a hypocrite when
[6:08] they come to church but do you realize
[6:10] church is the only place that the seed
[6:12] of god can't be a hypocrite
[6:15] right when you're in the world doing
[6:18] everything that you would be doing in
[6:19] the world
[6:20] you're testifying that you're of the
[6:21] world you're testifying that you enjoy
[6:22] the things the world but deep down
[6:24] inside there's a representation
[6:25] from eternity so it's not at church that
[6:27] you're a hypocrite
[6:28] it's when you're out there in the world
[6:30] living like the world that you're
[6:31] actually a hypocrite so
[6:32] we wouldn't want to discourage anybody
[6:34] from coming to church because
[6:35] they wouldn't want to be a hypocrite
[6:37] actually we say come to church it's the
[6:38] only place you can't be
[6:40] because you're a son or daughter of god
[6:42] you're a seed of god and so we're
[6:43] looking at how
[6:44] we treat others and then even our
[6:46] attitude towards others and our attitude
[6:48] towards those that are backslid and then
[6:51] i want to give you a little bit of a
[6:52] road map
[6:53] as to where we're going and and in doing
[6:56] so
[6:57] not necessarily wet your appetite or not
[6:59] even put god in a box that means this is
[7:01] what i'm going to be doing
[7:02] for the remainder of these services that
[7:04] we might have to address this subject
[7:06] but just so you could see
[7:07] that there's a little bit of a vision as
[7:09] to where we're headed and so as we're
[7:11] looking at the parable of the good
[7:13] samaritan we will eventually get to the
[7:15] good samaritan
[7:16] and and looking at him we could see that
[7:18] in the good samaritan we can see an
[7:20] expression of christ
[7:22] and therefore by extension
[7:25] we can see ourselves because christ has
[7:28] no hands but your hands he has no feet
[7:29] but your feet so we could see
[7:31] we could see christ in the good
[7:32] samaritan and then also us as being his
[7:34] body
[7:35] and then we even the end that is
[7:38] mentioned in this parable of the good
[7:39] samaritan and how
[7:40] he took this man after he poured in the
[7:42] oil and the wine put him on his own
[7:44] beast and brought them to
[7:45] brought him to an end and took care of
[7:47] them the n is our church
[7:49] brother branham makes reference to this
[7:50] the n is the church and in a broader
[7:52] sense it's the body of christ so there's
[7:54] all these different parallels that are
[7:55] applicable to us as individuals and i
[7:58] share this roadmap so you can see that
[7:59] it's part of the vision as this church
[8:01] has established
[8:02] that we're considering the role of a
[8:04] church the purpose of a church
[8:05] the character of a church and then the
[8:08] the parable speaks of the host that is
[8:10] at that end
[8:11] and brother branham talks about this
[8:13] host or this caretaker as being the
[8:14] pastor of the ministry
[8:16] so you have the in which would be the
[8:17] church you have those who are there or
[8:19] tasked with
[8:20] overseeing the church and the operations
[8:22] of it and then the oil and the wine we
[8:24] know brother graham talks about that
[8:25] being spirit and revelation or pure word
[8:28] and there's it's actually even connected
[8:30] with worship
[8:31] and then the two pence these are all
[8:33] different elements in the parable that
[8:34] the
[8:35] word of god expounds upon that's also
[8:37] spirit and words there's a lot of
[8:38] different things that we can
[8:40] that we can look through and learn from
[8:43] that's instructive to us in our
[8:45] fellowship together
[8:46] as a church now
[8:50] this is so now that i've done that i
[8:52] feel like i've kind of given you a
[8:53] review of where we've been
[8:54] giving a little bit idea where we're
[8:55] going i just want to jump right back
[8:57] into it
[8:58] in terms of where we were last week and
[9:00] when jesus gives this parable he's
[9:02] challenging the lawyer
[9:04] to put himself in the shoes of not just
[9:07] the priest
[9:08] and the levite or the good samaritan but
[9:10] also to challenge him to consider
[9:12] whether or not he's the thief
[9:14] or the thieves because he's very direct
[9:16] and purposeful in each one of these
[9:18] elements that he uses in this parable
[9:20] are you a thief are you a priest are you
[9:22] a levite which one is your neighbor and
[9:23] he's challenging
[9:24] this lawyer and the question at the end
[9:27] of the parable which of these three
[9:29] who was neighbor to the man who fell
[9:31] among thieves
[9:32] the first thing that this lawyer is
[9:34] confronted with
[9:35] is the group of thieves and what i want
[9:38] to do tonight again is we've done this
[9:39] in a little bit is i want to
[9:41] continue to compare this group of
[9:43] thieves
[9:44] to the priest and the levite and you
[9:46] might seem like well these these don't
[9:47] have any comparison at all but you'll
[9:49] find
[9:49] that these three if you want to consider
[9:51] the group or two groups or three groups
[9:54] or
[9:54] or three types of people they have more
[9:56] in common than you
[9:57] realize in luke chapter 10
[10:01] in verses 10 to 31-32
[10:04] it says and by chance there came down a
[10:07] certain priest
[10:08] that way so this man who left jerusalem
[10:10] is on his way to jericho
[10:11] has been found among thieves he's torn
[10:13] he's beaten his remnants ripped from him
[10:15] and now the priest is introduced to us
[10:17] it says and by chance there came down
[10:19] a certain priest that way he did he
[10:22] wasn't
[10:23] going looking for someone to help
[10:26] he wasn't going with even an idea that
[10:28] he would render aid to anyone it was
[10:30] just by circumstance and coincidence
[10:32] that he passed by this way of this man
[10:34] that was hurt and when he saw him he
[10:36] passed by on the other side
[10:38] and it says and likewise a levite when
[10:40] he was at the place came and looked on
[10:41] him
[10:42] and passed by on the other side and so
[10:45] in the the way the sentence is
[10:47] structured both the priest
[10:49] and the levite by chance pass by the one
[10:52] that was hurt and wounded
[10:53] they were neither seeking one that was
[10:55] hurt they were neither looking for one
[10:56] that was hurt
[10:57] it was only a coincidence that caused
[11:00] them to pass by one that was in need of
[11:02] aid
[11:02] but as you continue to read in verse 33
[11:05] but a certain samaritan
[11:06] as he journeyed came where he was
[11:10] and this is immediately instructive to
[11:11] us and jesus is wanting to contrast
[11:14] the actions and activities of the priest
[11:15] and levi and so he says
[11:17] by chance by coincidence they passed by
[11:20] this one that was hurting
[11:21] but this is not suggested of the
[11:23] samaritan in other words
[11:24] he perhaps went out looking for someone
[11:27] to help
[11:28] because he had what you would need to
[11:29] help he had oil he had wine he had
[11:31] things to administer aid so it says a
[11:33] certain samaritan as he journeyed as he
[11:35] traveled
[11:36] he came where he was it was almost as if
[11:39] he had a purpose in going out he kept
[11:41] his eyes open he was prepared
[11:43] and he was seeking one who on this road
[11:45] might be
[11:46] accosted by thieves and and be beaten
[11:49] and robbed because he knew this was a
[11:50] dangerous way
[11:52] so he was looking for someone to help as
[11:53] he went out and this is
[11:55] instructive to us as i said when he came
[11:58] where he was
[11:59] and when he saw him he had compassion on
[12:01] him and went to him
[12:04] and i think it's important for us to be
[12:06] to challenge ourselves because sometimes
[12:08] we can kind of get this prideful
[12:10] mentality
[12:11] of come to us right we're a church we
[12:14] have a church you come to us
[12:16] if you want help come to the church if
[12:18] you need healing come to the church
[12:20] if you want to find your way come to the
[12:21] church and if we're not careful all the
[12:23] great and wonderful things about church
[12:24] and church services and church amenities
[12:26] actually begin to work against us
[12:28] because we just settle in our comfort
[12:30] zone of church
[12:31] and we just expect everyone to come to
[12:32] us who needs help
[12:34] but the samaritan it says it went came
[12:36] where he was
[12:38] and so it changes this idea of come to
[12:40] us we know how to help the hurting
[12:42] but rather you go out to the lost you go
[12:44] out to the hurt and you seek those who
[12:46] are in need
[12:46] and you go to where they are and when
[12:48] you come to them
[12:50] you find them where they are you have
[12:51] compassion on him it says and went to
[12:53] him
[12:54] and bound up his wounds pouring in oil
[12:56] and wine and set him on his own beast
[12:57] and brought him to and in and took care
[12:59] of him so you don't sit at the church
[13:01] store saying hey anybody
[13:03] hurt anybody lost come inside but rather
[13:06] you go
[13:06] out to the one who's hurting you find
[13:08] them in the place that they are
[13:10] and you begin to minister to them in
[13:11] their need wherever they are and then
[13:13] the goal and the objective is to bring
[13:15] them to a place of fellowship in christ
[13:17] in the body of christ and so it's by
[13:20] chance that the priest happens upon the
[13:22] hurting
[13:22] and it's by chance that the levite comes
[13:24] across the one that's hurting
[13:26] but it is it is by uh seeking and by
[13:29] humility that the samaritan
[13:30] found one that was hurting and he came
[13:32] to where he was
[13:34] went to him and ministered to him in his
[13:36] need
[13:41] and so the the priest
[13:45] and the levite have more in common with
[13:48] the thieves
[13:49] than they do the samaritan and this
[13:53] might seem like well if it seems
[13:54] a little bit a kind of a stark a
[13:57] contrast and
[13:58] you're not maybe seeing the overlap i
[14:00] very quickly want to come to it
[14:02] just use allow your mind just to ponder
[14:05] for a moment
[14:06] what a band of thieves would be he fell
[14:08] among thieves this was a group this was
[14:09] a band of thieves it was more than one
[14:12] and i'm going to characterize him a
[14:13] certain way and you say well this may be
[14:14] self-serving to what you're trying to
[14:16] preach tonight
[14:16] and i have the benefit of doing that
[14:18] because i've been pondering what i was
[14:20] preaching tonight so if it seems a
[14:21] little self-serving the way i
[14:23] define this i'm very intent on doing it
[14:26] this way
[14:26] but the thieves were a group who
[14:29] capitalized on the vulnerability of
[14:30] somebody else
[14:32] and so as they were watching those that
[14:34] would pass by they wouldn't attack
[14:35] another group that would be well
[14:37] defended or that they would have
[14:38] maybe even looked like they don't even
[14:40] have anything they're very discretionary
[14:41] and who that they would have cost
[14:43] but they were a group who capitalized on
[14:45] weakness vulnerability
[14:46] and even someone's inability to defend
[14:48] themselves or their resources
[14:50] for their own personal gain so these
[14:52] these thieves
[14:53] laid in weight and they were opportunist
[14:55] when one passed by
[14:57] that had something they wanted and they
[14:58] could get it out of them they would use
[15:00] force or whatever it was to get
[15:02] something
[15:03] and so jesus uses a group for a reason
[15:06] he doesn't say he passed by someone
[15:07] arrogant he didn't say passed by a
[15:09] gentile he didn't say passed by
[15:11] a a a ruthless priest but rather he says
[15:14] this is a gang this is a group of
[15:16] thieves
[15:16] and they fell upon him and wounded him
[15:18] and beat him and took away his clothes
[15:21] so each one of the of these thieves now
[15:24] they're acting in concert together
[15:26] and there's certain dynamics that are at
[15:28] work upon these thieves as they begin to
[15:30] rob this man who went down from
[15:32] jerusalem on his way to jericho
[15:34] and they were part of an organized
[15:35] social structure
[15:37] i want you to think about this and
[15:39] because they were part of an organized
[15:40] social structure
[15:42] they behaved according to a certain uh
[15:44] set of norms or behaved according to
[15:46] established set
[15:47] code of conduct that was expected among
[15:49] thieves
[15:50] and when they say there's no honor among
[15:52] thieves and so that but yet there's
[15:54] still a a a a
[15:56] professional respect or a accord or
[15:58] there are certain ways that you would
[15:59] treat one another certain ways that you
[16:00] would have acted
[16:01] so within this gang or this group of
[16:03] people they had this organized structure
[16:05] that would have behaved according to a
[16:06] certain set of norms
[16:08] in other words there would have been a
[16:09] culture that each one of them had joined
[16:12] and now they're characterized as robbers
[16:13] and thieves but they have a certain
[16:15] dynamic that makes them operate
[16:19] and the culture is a specific collection
[16:22] of values and norms
[16:24] that are shared by people in a group or
[16:26] an organization
[16:27] so cultures shared values and certain
[16:29] normative behavior
[16:30] that everyone shares within an
[16:32] organization and then it's those values
[16:34] and norms that control the way that you
[16:36] interact with one another
[16:37] and with others outside the organization
[16:39] we've heard of organizational culture
[16:41] an organization can have a culture a
[16:44] baseball team can have a culture a
[16:45] clubhouse can have a culture a school
[16:47] can have a culture
[16:48] churches can have a culture and so
[16:50] within this culture there's a set of
[16:52] norms there's certain values there's
[16:53] certain ways that we behave
[16:55] and it determines how we interact with
[16:57] each other and even how we interact with
[16:58] those
[16:59] who are outside of the group or the
[17:01] organization
[17:03] and so the priests and levites and the
[17:06] thieves
[17:07] both of them as two separate groups we
[17:08] want to look at it with groups or uh
[17:10] three different groups they acted
[17:11] according to group dynamics
[17:13] to be harmful and i'm wanting not to
[17:16] think of the priest in levite as jesus
[17:19] purposely putting him in a category of
[17:21] people and then purposely placing in a
[17:23] group of people in
[17:24] as a contrast you have thieves and you
[17:26] have priests and levines
[17:29] and now i want you to think about these
[17:31] thieves
[17:32] and these priests and this levite as
[17:34] having things in common
[17:36] in hosea chapter 6 verse 9 it says and
[17:39] as troops of robbers wait for a man
[17:41] so the company of priests murder in the
[17:43] way by consent
[17:46] for they commit lewdness now the old
[17:48] testament's just done all the hard work
[17:51] as i'm i'm suggesting to you that the
[17:53] thieves have more in common with the
[17:54] priest
[17:55] than the priests have with the samaritan
[17:57] that the thieves have more in common
[17:58] with the levite
[17:59] than the levite does with the samaritan
[18:01] the bible actually makes the comparison
[18:03] that as a gang of robbers would wait for
[18:05] a man to rob him so
[18:06] the company of priests murder in the way
[18:09] by consent
[18:09] through their commission of lewdness so
[18:12] an unfaithful priest an unfaithful
[18:14] levite operating in that capacity as a
[18:16] priest or unfaithful
[18:18] in the duties that he should administer
[18:19] in the temple the bible compares him to
[18:21] a gang of robbers
[18:23] then in matt micah chapter 3 verses 10
[18:25] to 11
[18:26] it says they build up zion with blood in
[18:28] jerusalem with iniquity
[18:30] the heads thereof judge for reward
[18:33] they're influenced by bribes and the
[18:36] priests they're of teach for hire for
[18:38] payment or for money
[18:39] and the profits therefore divine for
[18:41] money yet
[18:43] yet will they lean upon the lord and say
[18:45] he is not the lord among us
[18:46] none evil can come upon us so think
[18:49] about the example that these men are
[18:51] setting whether it be the
[18:53] the heads that judge for reward the
[18:55] priest that teach for hire the prophets
[18:56] that divine for money
[18:58] it's actually taking the priest and put
[18:59] him in the category of somebody
[19:01] who is influenced by gain influenced
[19:05] by something that they can benefit from
[19:07] it's not actually service
[19:08] it's not something that they can give
[19:10] but what can they get out of it and they
[19:11] actually are teaching for higher
[19:13] teaching for payment
[19:14] and the bible in the old testament's
[19:16] taking these priests to say they
[19:17] act just as robbers who just want to get
[19:20] into your pocket and take something from
[19:21] you
[19:22] and then in the text that we read in
[19:24] matthew chapter 23 verses 1 to 7
[19:28] says then spake jesus to the multitude
[19:30] and to his disciples
[19:31] the scribes and the pharisees sit in
[19:34] moses's seat
[19:36] that means they put themselves in a
[19:37] position of authority
[19:39] and it struck me that even in in the
[19:42] contrast now
[19:43] you have the scribes and pharisees and
[19:45] priests would certainly be a part of
[19:47] that though it may not be inclusive of
[19:48] all priests
[19:49] but scribes and pharisees now are seated
[19:51] in moses seat
[19:52] as the successors to the prophet and now
[19:56] they're sitting in a seat of authority
[19:57] and he says all therefore whatsoever
[19:59] they bid you observe
[20:00] that observant do if they teach good
[20:02] doctrine if they're teaching you what
[20:03] moses said
[20:04] if they're deriving what they teach for
[20:06] moses authority then you ought to do it
[20:08] but do not ye after their works for they
[20:11] say
[20:11] and do not in other words they become
[20:13] hypocrites
[20:15] they try to use the authority of moses
[20:17] they try to use the authority of the
[20:18] prophet and they teach you many
[20:19] wonderful things that you ought to do
[20:21] but they themselves will not do it so
[20:23] we're saying when you see the priest
[20:24] they act hypocritically and they don't
[20:27] even do what they're telling you to do
[20:28] so don't do what they're doing
[20:30] and then he says for they bind heavy
[20:32] burdens and grievous to be born and lay
[20:34] them on men's
[20:35] shoulders but they themselves will not
[20:37] move them with one of their fingers
[20:39] they will not ease the burden they will
[20:41] not aid those that are in
[20:43] in this a predicament they've even
[20:45] placed upon them
[20:46] and there's other scriptures that i
[20:48] refrain from using
[20:50] but they're taking advantage of the
[20:51] people just as it said this company of
[20:54] priests murder in the way or they
[20:56] they teach for hire they're taking
[20:58] advantage of the sincerity of the people
[21:00] the bible even talks about how men will
[21:02] take a women who are laden with sins and
[21:04] lead them away captive why
[21:06] they capitalize on their guilt
[21:08] capitalize on their desire to be made
[21:10] free
[21:10] capitalize on their their predicament
[21:12] the situation that they're in
[21:14] and they prey on women who are
[21:15] vulnerable for their own benefit and for
[21:17] their own
[21:18] and for their own reputation it says
[21:21] verse five but all their works they do
[21:24] for to be seen of minutes for show not
[21:26] surface
[21:27] they make broad their phylacteries and
[21:29] enlarge the borders of their garments
[21:30] they want you to be sure that you know
[21:32] this is a priest this is one who's very
[21:34] holy this is one
[21:36] that you ought to give attention to and
[21:38] love the upper most rooms that feast and
[21:40] the chief seats and the synagogues they
[21:42] separate themselves
[21:44] they want to have the preeminence they
[21:45] want to put themselves forward they want
[21:46] to be recognized
[21:47] as being better and as being greater and
[21:49] as the ones that need to be served and
[21:50] says and greetings in the markets and to
[21:52] be called of men
[21:53] rabbi rabbi and there's a number of
[21:56] different scriptures that could be used
[21:58] but i think with just the few
[22:00] that have been referenced here you could
[22:02] consider how these
[22:03] even the priests would be characterized
[22:05] as opportunists themselves
[22:07] who will capitalize on weakness for
[22:09] personal gain
[22:11] who were not leaders but rather
[22:12] manipulators
[22:14] because as leaders they would have
[22:15] required of the people to do certain
[22:17] things and to give service and to
[22:19] and to worship and to make an offering
[22:21] for the people's own benefit for the
[22:22] worshipers benefit
[22:23] and that's what a leader will do it'll
[22:25] compel you it'll encourage you to do
[22:27] things and obey
[22:28] for your own benefit but a manipulator
[22:29] requires you to do something
[22:31] for their own benefit they want you to
[22:34] dress holy because it makes the church
[22:35] look holy
[22:36] they want you to act right because it's
[22:38] a reflection of their personality their
[22:40] character their ministry
[22:41] but that's a manipulator versus a leader
[22:44] and so these priests they were all into
[22:46] pretense and how they looked and how
[22:48] everyone saw what they were doing
[22:49] and so they were manipulating the people
[22:51] to extract gain
[22:53] out of them for their own benefit not to
[22:55] take sides in this political season
[22:57] we're in but they would have been
[22:58] capitalist
[23:06] and so as we
[23:10] think about these things the thieves
[23:14] the priest and the levite they're all
[23:17] acting under the influence of a group
[23:20] dynamic
[23:22] a thief within the gang of thieves the
[23:24] company the troops of robbers as the
[23:26] scripture says
[23:27] and then the priest as a company the
[23:30] levite as being part of a group that's
[23:32] separated and set apart
[23:34] now if i seem to be nervous and jumbled
[23:37] and mixed around i realize it may be a
[23:39] little bit scattered and
[23:40] not well put together but now i know
[23:42] that maybe i've got your attention a
[23:44] little bit
[23:44] and at least now you can start to relate
[23:47] because we all do things in a group that
[23:49] we otherwise wouldn't do
[23:51] by ourselves can we all agree there's
[23:54] things that we will do as a group that
[23:56] we otherwise would not normally do
[23:57] if we were alone and then we'll do
[24:00] things because of a group
[24:01] even when we are alone because of the
[24:03] same dynamics
[24:06] that because we identify with a
[24:07] particular group because we
[24:09] know of a particular group so it doesn't
[24:10] mean we have to be in the group and
[24:11] physically together to do that but
[24:13] sometimes the fact that we belong to a
[24:15] group are identified with a particular
[24:16] group
[24:17] even when we're alone will act according
[24:19] to a certain set of dynamics that are
[24:20] associated with that group
[24:23] and so i want you to ponder the power of
[24:25] the culture that acted upon the thief
[24:26] the power of the culture that acted upon
[24:28] the priest and the levite to bypass the
[24:30] one that was
[24:31] wounded by the thieves consider the the
[24:34] power
[24:34] of a social structure consider the power
[24:37] uh uh that
[24:38] existed within this gang of thieves and
[24:40] they existed amongst the priests and the
[24:42] levites that actually
[24:43] influenced them one to rob one to hurt
[24:46] one to harm
[24:47] and the others to avoid and to bypass
[24:49] them
[24:51] so if you're thinking with me now on uh
[24:53] the way that a group works
[24:55] to influence our behavior because we're
[24:56] part of a group we'll act a certain way
[24:57] in a group
[24:58] in a group setting that we otherwise
[25:00] wouldn't do when we're all alone
[25:01] and then also we do things when we're
[25:04] all alone that we otherwise wouldn't do
[25:06] but rather because we're part of a group
[25:07] we're acting according to a group
[25:08] behavior
[25:10] i used to think it'd be fun just to take
[25:12] to video people
[25:13] i'm probably mentioning something nobody
[25:14] knows about except uh telling your age
[25:16] but you take a hacky sack
[25:18] and uh look maybe you could demonstrate
[25:20] but you get in a circle and you play
[25:21] hacky sack and you
[25:22] have a group of people standing around
[25:24] and you're bumping it and kicking it and
[25:26] stalling and everything you do and i
[25:27] thought it'd be great to do that and
[25:28] then take
[25:29] edit out the hacky sack and just watch
[25:31] this group of people doing the most
[25:32] bizarre
[25:33] set of movements and so you there's
[25:36] things that you do in a group
[25:38] that makes sense in a group that you
[25:40] wouldn't otherwise do
[25:41] if you were alone and i want you to use
[25:44] that
[25:45] being able to relate that way and think
[25:46] about how someone if you were an
[25:48] individual in this gang of thieves
[25:50] how you would begin to act a certain way
[25:52] and do a certain thing
[25:53] that you would have never done by
[25:54] yourself never jump out and rob
[25:57] somebody and this priest and this levite
[26:00] because the group that they were part of
[26:03] it affected the way that they acted
[26:06] now i'm going back to two statements we
[26:09] read last time just to see how this
[26:10] how this was unfolding as we were
[26:12] looking at this
[26:13] brother branham says when men and women
[26:15] get to a place and now he gets into
[26:17] their thought process
[26:19] well i really ought to stay at home i
[26:21] really ought to stay at home and see
[26:22] this good play tonight i should stay
[26:24] home and watch this tv show
[26:25] want to stay home and watch the ball
[26:27] game whatever it is he says but i tell
[26:28] you
[26:29] they will think i'm backslid if i go
[26:31] don't go on down to church
[26:33] so he's looking at thought process and
[26:35] how someone's at home on a wednesday
[26:37] night uh
[26:38] maybe a sunday night he's saying oh well
[26:40] i should go to church
[26:42] but i really want to watch this and
[26:43] they're wrestling with these thoughts
[26:44] inside of their mind but then they
[26:46] decide to go to church
[26:47] not because they want to go to church
[26:49] but because of what everyone else at
[26:51] church will think
[26:52] if i don't show up at church they'll
[26:54] think that i'm backslid if i don't go to
[26:56] church
[26:56] so it's identifying an individual's
[26:58] thought process
[26:59] then there the thought process of the
[27:01] group like well how did this person know
[27:04] that that's what everybody would think
[27:06] because that's what they think when they
[27:07] go when you don't
[27:11] have you ever been around somebody
[27:12] always talking about everybody else
[27:16] now do you think they don't talk about
[27:17] you when you're not around them
[27:20] you've got a lot of faith and that's why
[27:23] this person could say well i
[27:25] i really want to stay home and but i
[27:27] better go to church because they'll all
[27:28] think i'm backslid
[27:29] it was the way the group thinks
[27:32] it was actually something that the
[27:34] church had projected
[27:36] that they had participated in and
[27:40] and maybe i could say this maybe they
[27:41] didn't think that way but they felt that
[27:43] way about everybody
[27:44] that's how they knew people felt but it
[27:45] was something that characterized the
[27:47] church
[27:48] that was causing this person to think
[27:49] through well i better go to church
[27:50] tonight because if i don't the church is
[27:52] going to think i'm
[27:53] backslid then in the message thirst
[27:55] brother says let me tell you something
[27:57] when you're worshiping god
[27:58] in the spirit and in truth then so he
[28:01] says that's what we ought to be doing
[28:02] right worship begotten spirit and truth
[28:03] he says when it becomes a custom for you
[28:05] to do it
[28:07] when your worship as a church becomes
[28:08] tradition it becomes custom this is what
[28:10] we do this is
[28:11] how we worship because you think you
[28:13] ought to do it
[28:16] he says because you think if you don't
[28:18] shout or jump up and down or dance with
[28:20] the music
[28:21] your neighbor is going to think you're
[28:22] backslid you are drinking from a
[28:24] stagnated
[28:26] stream so again he's looking at a
[28:28] thought process
[28:30] one the first one about going to church
[28:32] now even while you're in
[28:33] church you're worshiping because you
[28:36] think
[28:36] a certain way and you're worshiping
[28:39] because others
[28:40] think a certain way and if i don't
[28:42] worship with a particular expression if
[28:44] i don't stand up when everybody else
[28:45] stands up if i don't clap when everybody
[28:47] else claps when i'm not doing what the
[28:48] group is doing
[28:49] then the group is going to think i'm
[28:51] backslid because i'm not acting like
[28:54] everyone else is so brother branham is
[28:57] identifying
[28:58] how we can even begin to be influenced
[29:00] by a group
[29:02] by our church and as a church have a way
[29:04] of thinking
[29:05] and because you have a way of thinking
[29:06] as a church the individual begins to
[29:08] operate within the
[29:09] structure of that church not by their
[29:12] desire to be in church or their desire
[29:14] to worship god in spirit and truth
[29:16] but because they don't want to be
[29:17] considered as backslid
[29:20] and as i mentioned last time that's the
[29:22] last reason we want people come to
[29:23] church
[29:24] is because they don't want to be
[29:25] considered backslid
[29:27] i guess i'll go to church because i
[29:28] don't want people think i'm backslid
[29:30] and then everybody's just hooting and
[29:32] hollering in worship service because
[29:33] they don't want you to feel like they're
[29:34] backslid
[29:36] and then they just say amen to the
[29:38] preacher and get all excited because
[29:39] they don't want to be considered
[29:40] backslid
[29:41] and what have we accomplished in the end
[29:44] if we should hand out buttons that say
[29:46] foolja didn't i
[29:48] right or at least have a bumper sticker
[29:52] says at least i don't look backslid
[29:54] right and that becomes the tagline
[29:58] arizona believer's church at least we
[29:59] don't look
[30:00] backslid can we fit that in our logo
[30:05] and that's what brother brahm's
[30:06] identifying so consider
[30:10] then the factors that are influencing
[30:12] thinking
[30:14] just in these two examples alone
[30:16] consider the factors that
[30:18] influence behavior we're talking about
[30:19] the thief we're talking about the
[30:20] priests we're talking about the levi
[30:22] we're not even talking about the
[30:23] samaritan we're just talking about these
[30:26] three that this lawyer should be
[30:27] accosted with and he should be thinking
[30:29] about
[30:29] man am i a thief am i a priest or am i
[30:31] levite
[30:32] because which one was neighbor to him
[30:34] who fell among thieves
[30:38] in proverbs chapter 19
[30:41] verse 21
[30:45] it says there are many devices in a
[30:47] man's heart
[30:49] nevertheless the council of the lord
[30:51] that shall stand
[30:53] now for the remainder of our time this
[30:55] evening i want to
[30:56] expound upon the devices in our heart
[31:01] but i want to make this very clear right
[31:03] now there's a comparison that's made
[31:06] devices in our hearts versus the counsel
[31:08] of the lord
[31:10] and the counsel lord this is the
[31:12] necessary answer to the devices
[31:15] so if i if i use economics or i use
[31:19] psychology or sociology are you some
[31:21] scientific discipline
[31:23] to identify a device in a man's heart
[31:25] i'm by no means suggesting that the same
[31:28] schools and
[31:29] of thought and the same disciplines that
[31:31] can identify the problem within human
[31:33] thinking
[31:34] i'm not suggesting that the same school
[31:36] or discipline is
[31:38] is equipped to have the answer to it
[31:41] science can tell us all day long what's
[31:42] wrong with us
[31:44] and science can tell us all day long how
[31:46] we act a certain way and we behave a
[31:47] certain way but it doesn't have the
[31:49] answer to the human condition
[31:50] the word alone has the answer to it and
[31:53] so there's many devices in a man's heart
[31:55] but it's the counsel of the lord that is
[31:57] the necessary
[31:58] answer the necessary resolution and
[32:01] barrier or
[32:01] guard to these devices that are in our
[32:04] hearts
[32:05] there are many devices in a man's heart
[32:07] that device actually means
[32:09] we might say it well that's where we're
[32:10] headed anymore right just by
[32:12] uh we actually get a device implanted in
[32:14] us
[32:15] and we can just have the devices uh uh
[32:18] installed in us since we think devices
[32:20] cell phones tablets and different things
[32:22] but this when it says devices they're
[32:24] inventions in our mind
[32:26] a device is a perception so it's talking
[32:29] about
[32:30] thoughts and not just a fleeting thought
[32:32] but calculations
[32:34] so there's a computer inside of
[32:35] everyone's head
[32:37] there's a computer inside everyone's
[32:38] hearts and it's processing data
[32:40] analyzing data and it's coming to
[32:42] conclusions
[32:43] so there's many thoughts or calculations
[32:46] and then instincts within
[32:47] a person's heart so when the bible says
[32:49] there's many devices in a man's heart
[32:51] that's judgments that's conclusions it's
[32:56] thought
[32:56] it's thought pat thought patterns even
[32:58] think about this there's a code
[33:00] in your heart and it basically says if
[33:03] this then that
[33:05] and so it's it's actually throwing
[33:07] things out oh it didn't it's not this
[33:08] then go to that it's not this then go to
[33:10] that
[33:11] and it's searching for the it's
[33:12] searching for the the variation of the
[33:14] data variable that's going to change
[33:15] what the output is
[33:17] and so all of us have that in our hearts
[33:21] and and maybe you too can be a coder or
[33:23] developer
[33:24] because it's just in you naturally to
[33:26] think that way
[33:28] so i want to put it this way and in
[33:30] science it called a heuristic
[33:32] but it's a mental shortcut that allows
[33:35] us
[33:36] to solve problems and make judgments
[33:38] quickly and efficiently
[33:40] so it's it's actually these devices that
[33:43] allow you to be able to say don't touch
[33:45] that it's hot
[33:47] right and you can do it very quickly
[33:49] it's what allows you to see a face and
[33:51] it's like that person looks
[33:52] angry it's what it's what makes you able
[33:56] to make decisions very quickly and not
[33:57] just quickly but efficiently so we all
[33:59] have
[34:00] mental shortcuts or formulas or ways
[34:02] that we process information
[34:04] and we use it to solve problems or make
[34:05] decisions or make judgments
[34:07] and it helps us to do it very quickly
[34:09] now that's a benefit right
[34:10] to have that in our heart to have a
[34:11] device in our heart would allow us to do
[34:13] that
[34:14] but there's a downside to it and the
[34:16] downside to it is
[34:17] a cognitive bias and so we have mental
[34:20] shortcuts
[34:22] we have ways of processing information
[34:23] if we see this and we see that then we
[34:25] make this conclusion
[34:26] if this happens and that happens then we
[34:27] view it a certain way but then the
[34:29] cognitive bias is basically a systematic
[34:31] error in that problem solving something
[34:34] that's wrong in the very
[34:36] a systematic error in that judgment
[34:38] making something wrong in our thought
[34:40] process that's actually creating a bias
[34:43] and keeps us from behaving correctly
[34:45] acting correctly
[34:46] or doing what we ought to do
[34:49] and and i established this in talking
[34:52] about groups or culture
[34:54] because it's these devices in a man's
[34:56] heart that puts us
[34:57] into groups desire to belong the
[35:00] desire to be accepted and so it's these
[35:03] very heuristics or these mental
[35:04] shortcuts or these thought processes and
[35:06] value judgments in our mind
[35:08] that cause us to be put into groups and
[35:09] then allow that group to influence us
[35:12] so there's many devices in a man's heart
[35:14] these devices in your heart
[35:16] cause you to become a part of a group
[35:19] and then it allows the group to
[35:20] influence
[35:21] the way that you act in the way that you
[35:22] think
[35:24] so i want to look at these group
[35:25] dynamics not necessarily how we get into
[35:28] them
[35:29] but the power and the influence of them
[35:31] the power and the influence of culture
[35:34] and revelations chapter 3 verse 17
[35:39] this is speaking to the whole age so it
[35:42] addresses the age as a group
[35:44] because thou sayest i am rich and
[35:46] increased with goods
[35:47] and have need of nothing and know us not
[35:50] that thou are wretched and miserable
[35:51] poor
[35:52] and blind and naked this is the spirit
[35:56] of the age and since we're part of an
[35:59] age and where
[35:59] we come forth in a particular age
[36:01] there's a attitude
[36:03] or a thought process or a spirit that
[36:06] works upon the age
[36:08] just by virtue of being born into
[36:09] laodicea there's an influence of
[36:11] laodicea
[36:12] there's the course of this world there's
[36:13] a way that we're made to think a way a
[36:16] way that we're made to act
[36:17] and it's a pressure that comes upon the
[36:19] age
[36:20] and since there's a spirit on the age it
[36:22] characterizes the entire age so i'm just
[36:24] putting the whole age into one group
[36:26] and the bible's saying they have a way
[36:27] of thinking and they have a way of
[36:28] acting why they're in laodicea
[36:31] they're in that time and so there's a
[36:33] power and an influence over the people's
[36:35] thinking
[36:36] it's the condition of the age that makes
[36:37] them think they're rich and increased
[36:39] with goods and have need of nothing
[36:40] it's the condition of the age that has
[36:42] blinded them to the fact
[36:43] that they actually are naked poor and
[36:45] miserable
[36:47] and then brother branham identifies this
[36:49] about this age
[36:50] he says it's the hour of uniting that's
[36:54] the spirit of the age we've got to unite
[36:56] everything you talk about has got to be
[36:58] organized so we're living in a time
[37:01] where things are
[37:02] being united things are coming together
[37:05] so there's a spirit on this age and then
[37:07] one of the spirits on this age is the
[37:08] spirit of let's come together let's
[37:10] organize let's come into groups
[37:11] and now this works on just the devices
[37:13] in a man's heart of wanting to belong
[37:15] and wanting to be accepted
[37:17] and wanting to to be acknowledged
[37:20] amongst your peers and those things
[37:21] these are all things that are working in
[37:22] the age that we're living in
[37:25] and now i'm gonna i don't care remember
[37:27] how many i might have here to go through
[37:30] but i want to start looking at some of
[37:32] these biases in our hearts
[37:40] there's a and again this is maybe
[37:41] academic and if you
[37:43] had taken your behavioral economics
[37:45] class today and it's all review
[37:47] give me credit if you get a good grade
[37:48] on your test
[37:51] but there's a conformity bias this is a
[37:53] device in our hearts
[37:55] this is a way of thinking this is a
[37:56] power this is a mechanism in our minds
[37:59] the way we think that works against us
[38:01] and the conformity bias is the tendency
[38:03] to behave like those around us
[38:06] rather than use our own personal
[38:08] judgment
[38:10] so instead of acting by your own
[38:11] conviction instead of doing what you
[38:14] would want to do
[38:16] you you conform to everyone else around
[38:18] you so it's a tendency to behave
[38:19] like those around you then use your own
[38:21] personal taste or your own opinion
[38:24] and you say well what would be an
[38:25] example of that brother and you go out
[38:27] to eat
[38:27] and you really really like tofu and
[38:30] you're finally at a place that's got
[38:32] tofu and everyone else starts ordering
[38:33] steak and you don't want to be the guy
[38:35] who orders the tofu burger
[38:38] and so you change your order to what
[38:40] everybody else is ordering especially if
[38:42] everyone else starts ordering it
[38:44] and what you do instead of just ordering
[38:45] according to what your personal taste is
[38:47] according to your preference
[38:48] you actually will order something else
[38:50] because everyone else
[38:52] is ordering it and that's a conformity
[38:54] bias that may be a very innocent simple
[38:56] way
[38:57] of how this works but we all have this
[38:59] mechanism in our heart
[39:00] to where we want to behave like those
[39:02] around us instead of just using our own
[39:04] conviction even our own taste
[39:06] or using our own opinions to guide us
[39:08] and influence us
[39:10] and let me point this out as we go
[39:12] forward with a lot of these
[39:14] influences and these dynamics of group
[39:16] behavior physical presence isn't
[39:18] necessary
[39:21] and all we needed was the facebook
[39:22] experience experiment
[39:24] to figure that out that you don't have
[39:26] to physically be with somebody in order
[39:27] for
[39:28] them to influence you and make you angry
[39:31] you're in a great mood next thing you
[39:33] know you're reading somebody's wall and
[39:34] it tells you something and you're a bad
[39:36] mood
[39:36] physical proximity being physically
[39:38] together is not required for a group
[39:41] to act upon you and to influence you so
[39:44] you can be subject to this desire to
[39:46] conform and to behave like everyone else
[39:47] around you but it doesn't mean they have
[39:49] to be within the same room
[39:50] you can just be grouped together through
[39:51] social media
[39:54] and what they find is that people are
[39:56] more comfortable with impersonating or
[39:58] mimicking others than they are with just
[39:59] doing what they would want to do
[40:03] and it's it it's how that uh they've
[40:05] done many different experiments and you
[40:07] can just see it work where
[40:08] if everyone else is doing something you
[40:10] won't even ask i guess i better stand up
[40:13] because everybody else is standing i
[40:14] guess i better clap because everybody
[40:16] else is clapping
[40:17] let's if you would you would just rather
[40:19] you're more comfortable fitting in with
[40:20] everyone else is doing
[40:22] than just following your own instinct to
[40:24] doing what you feel you should do
[40:27] they'd rather just follow the crowd than
[40:29] their own conviction
[40:31] and because of that they have what is
[40:33] called a bandwagon effect
[40:36] it's a tendency to like the team that
[40:37] just won the championship
[40:41] it's a tendency to act a certain way or
[40:44] believe a certain thing because many
[40:45] others are acting the same way
[40:47] the bandwagon effect it's the the
[40:49] tendency to act a certain way or believe
[40:51] a certain way
[40:52] because others are acting or believing a
[40:54] certain way
[40:56] and you just kind of get on the
[40:57] bandwagon everyone's liking this
[40:59] everyone's doing this and this is how
[41:01] these uh they call them memes they say
[41:03] they go viral they're actually just
[41:04] talking about the
[41:05] way that it infects because while
[41:08] because it's passed from person to
[41:09] person
[41:10] and it's this mimetic compulsion
[41:12] everyone else is doing it so i'm gonna
[41:14] do it and people do the silliest things
[41:16] because everyone else is doing it
[41:18] my goodness now that i'm thinking about
[41:19] it i didn't even have to edit out the
[41:21] hacky sack just with everyone
[41:22] tick-tocking they look crazy
[41:25] because you go by somebody like what in
[41:27] the world are they doing it looks so
[41:28] weird then you're like oh
[41:30] yeah they're tick-tocking that's why
[41:32] they're doing all sorts of weird
[41:34] weird things and why are they doing it
[41:35] because everyone else is
[41:38] it's the power of the crowd it's the
[41:39] sway it's the mood it's and they get on
[41:41] the bandwagon to fit in and they get on
[41:43] the bandwagon
[41:44] so they can be part of the group and go
[41:46] the direction everyone else is going
[41:48] now so far ordering a burger at a
[41:50] restaurant or a steak at a restaurant
[41:51] because everyone else is ordering it
[41:53] and liking the chiefs because they want
[41:55] a championship all those things may seem
[41:56] very very innocent
[41:57] but this is where it gets it really
[41:59] starts to get down to where we live
[42:01] there's a lot of different groups that
[42:02] we're a part of
[42:05] to where this isn't just as innocent as
[42:06] going out to dinner
[42:08] and where this worked on the thieves and
[42:10] where it began to work on the priests
[42:12] and levites is then there's such a thing
[42:13] called the group think
[42:15] the hive mentality we all behave the
[42:18] same way
[42:19] and how this is effective is we have a
[42:21] desire for harmony
[42:23] since we have this desire to conform
[42:26] this desire for harmony or conformity in
[42:28] the group results in decisions
[42:31] or conduct that is irrational or
[42:33] dysfunctional
[42:35] why because the desire to conform is
[42:37] there and the desire to have harmony
[42:39] within the group
[42:40] is what's motivating everyone to act and
[42:42] it actually causes people with this
[42:44] group think mentality to do things that
[42:45] are irrational
[42:47] to do things that are dysfunctional and
[42:50] group members will try to minimize
[42:52] conflict
[42:53] and reach consensus decision without
[42:55] critically evaluating other alternative
[42:58] viewpoints and by actively suppressing
[43:00] dissenting viewpoints
[43:02] this is what happens in group think
[43:05] everyone tries to minimize
[43:06] conflict to reach a consensus
[43:09] and so that since that's the goal we
[43:11] don't want to hear someone else's idea
[43:12] we don't want to hear someone else's
[43:13] opinion
[43:14] we isolate ourselves from other
[43:15] influences and because we're wanting to
[43:17] think a certain way
[43:18] act a certain way and you just get in
[43:20] this mentality is it doesn't matter if
[43:21] it's irrational doesn't matter if it's
[43:23] dysfunctional
[43:23] what we want to promote is a lack of we
[43:26] don't want any disconforming thought we
[43:27] don't want any
[43:28] it's what cognitive dissonance is just
[43:29] push anything out of the way so i feel
[43:31] good about what i'm doing
[43:33] and it occurs because there's a desire
[43:35] to conform
[43:38] it occurs because we derive our
[43:40] information from others
[43:44] and then what happens is our group
[43:46] becomes an echo chamber
[43:51] and you may have heard this phrase
[43:53] before it's not unfamiliar
[43:55] but its ideas are repeated within a
[43:57] closed
[43:58] a closed system
[44:01] which excludes any other input so the
[44:04] idea would be expressed that ideas
[44:06] are are promoted ideas are expressed and
[44:08] then they're repeated
[44:09] inside this closed system that won't
[44:11] allow any disconforming idea
[44:14] anything that's a rebuttal anything that
[44:15] balances anything that would be outside
[44:17] of this pattern of thinking
[44:18] and so what happens is the same thing is
[44:20] repeated over and over again they call
[44:21] it an echo chamber
[44:23] anybody ever heard that phrase used
[44:25] before
[44:27] and so because they want to keep
[44:29] anything that doesn't fit that narrative
[44:31] out
[44:32] it only allows information in that
[44:34] reinforces that view
[44:36] now when it when a group think becomes
[44:38] an echo chamber that's what
[44:40] that's when people get polarized and
[44:42] that's when you have social polarization
[44:44] social extremism political polarization
[44:46] political extremism
[44:47] was there's just a closed loop looper
[44:49] the only thing you keep hearing over and
[44:50] over again is the same thing over and
[44:51] over and over and over and over and over
[44:52] and over and it becomes that's the only
[44:54] thing anyone ever considers
[44:56] i'm just looking at academia looking at
[44:59] things that are in our hearts to
[45:00] describe the way groups work
[45:02] and then i think you're spiritual enough
[45:03] to begin to apply that we've got to be
[45:05] careful how we behave and act in groups
[45:09] this was a conclusion that was drawn
[45:10] from a group study it said something
[45:12] strange happens when you put people into
[45:14] groups
[45:16] they take on new roles form in-group
[45:20] alliances
[45:21] get swept up by extreme stances
[45:25] succumb to peer pressure in a group
[45:28] setting the reasonableness of our
[45:29] thinking can be distorted and
[45:31] compromised
[45:33] so as soon as you identify yourself with
[45:34] the group you can take on a different
[45:36] kind of role
[45:37] you form alliances within the group you
[45:39] can get swept up in extreme stances how
[45:41] groupthink echo chambers
[45:43] you succumb to peer pressure why the
[45:45] group is doing it
[45:46] this is in the and you uh in the
[45:49] reasonableness of your thinking can be
[45:50] distorted
[45:51] and compromised all through what being
[45:54] placed within
[45:55] a group that's why it's called herb uh
[45:58] herb that's the combination of herd and
[46:01] mob
[46:02] and if i was in a real in a hurry i'd
[46:04] just do it it's
[46:05] herb mentality and maybe there is some
[46:08] kind of type there when it comes to
[46:10] herbs but but this herd mentality or mob
[46:14] mentality
[46:16] people are in a group and someone kicks
[46:18] a window and everyone's like
[46:19] let's bust some windows and you have a
[46:21] group of people that would never would
[46:22] have vandalized a day in their life
[46:25] but now that everyone else is doing it
[46:27] all of a sudden they get swept up in the
[46:28] collective
[46:29] everyone else is acting in this mob
[46:31] mentality this herd mentality
[46:33] individuals in a group begin to act
[46:34] collectively without even centralized
[46:37] decision making
[46:39] and everyone's doing the same thing and
[46:40] it's not like someone told them to do it
[46:43] it's not like they've received a command
[46:44] they call like a hive mentality there's
[46:46] just like a
[46:46] mindset that sweeps over the people and
[46:48] everyone starts doing the same thing
[46:50] this is what happens when people are put
[46:52] into groups
[46:53] now it can happen in a positive way when
[46:56] people see that others are giving they
[46:58] can be giving also
[47:00] but then when they see other people
[47:01] taking they can take also
[47:03] they did a cheating study and they found
[47:05] that cheating is contagious
[47:07] when we see others succeed by cheating
[47:09] it makes us more likely to cheat as well
[47:13] it's the attitude when you see somebody
[47:15] looting
[47:16] you may not be a looter but when you see
[47:18] somebody else coming out with a really
[47:19] nice pair of air jordans you're like
[47:22] i want a pair and good
[47:25] people can get swept up in the moment
[47:27] and do things
[47:29] and i'm sure none of you are wearing
[47:31] shoes that were looted
[47:33] but maybe i'm using well if if not then
[47:36] let's talk
[47:37] but i'm using maybe examples that we can
[47:40] begin to relate to then just
[47:41] think about how that we then and people
[47:44] can do
[47:44] things that they otherwise wouldn't do
[47:47] but the power of the crowd
[47:49] everyone else is doing it well if i
[47:51] don't do it i'm going to be at a
[47:53] disadvantage if i don't do it
[47:55] then everyone else is getting ahead and
[47:56] everyone else is cheating if i don't
[47:58] cheat
[47:58] i can't keep up my grades will be bad or
[48:01] they're getting the benefit why can't i
[48:02] get a benefit
[48:03] it's all part of the dynamics that work
[48:05] upon the devices in our heart
[48:06] that cause people to go down the wrong
[48:09] path
[48:12] there was a a a really profound
[48:15] experiment that was done in regards to
[48:17] this the power of the crowd and the way
[48:18] we behave in groups
[48:22] and they did a group experiment and
[48:25] in this experiment they had and and i
[48:28] don't have the numbers in front of me
[48:29] but i believe it was like maybe five
[48:30] people
[48:31] five or six people that were actors and
[48:34] they had one person who was not an actor
[48:36] they were the participant in the study
[48:38] but the participant didn't know
[48:40] everyone else was acting and so he's in
[48:43] a room with five other people the
[48:44] participant is
[48:46] and they're asked a question and then
[48:48] they're
[48:49] all going to have to answer uh orally
[48:51] out loud
[48:52] what the answer is but the participant
[48:55] is always going to go last
[48:57] and the question was which of these uh
[49:01] which of the of these four lines
[49:05] i'm trying to remember just exactly how
[49:06] it was phrased but i'll show you the
[49:08] slide in a minute and probably make it
[49:09] really easy to articulate this if you
[49:10] were looking at it so i'll just do that
[49:15] it was presented this way i'm going to
[49:18] get out of the way
[49:20] which line on the right is the same
[49:22] length as the line on the left
[49:25] so the question is of a b and c which
[49:28] letter here is the same length as this
[49:30] one here
[49:31] now we're looking at that and we're
[49:33] thinking well this is easy
[49:34] right this is not a hard question
[49:38] and it was done this way purposefully to
[49:40] where now you have
[49:42] six people in a room they're all
[49:43] participants in a study seemingly and
[49:45] the question is
[49:46] which line on the right a b or c is the
[49:50] same length as the one on the left now
[49:52] i'm not going to trick anybody how many
[49:54] think that it's c
[49:56] right all of us together is a group this
[49:59] is not a visual illusion
[50:01] it is true c is the same length
[50:04] as the line on the left but what they
[50:07] did is they had the five
[50:09] actors in the study answer first
[50:13] and they all said a or b
[50:17] and so as they got down the line the
[50:19] participant in the study now
[50:21] has to give an answer in the group
[50:24] dynamic
[50:25] and in the when the study was originally
[50:27] done 75
[50:29] of the non-actors said
[50:32] the wrong answer and gave the same
[50:36] answer as the group
[50:39] so you had five people and they'd say
[50:40] which line on the right is the same
[50:42] as the length as the line on the left
[50:44] and they say a
[50:46] a a a a and the whole time you're
[50:50] thinking
[50:51] no no no and then it gets your turn
[50:54] you're like
[50:55] a yep a
[50:58] good job guys yep now what would make
[51:02] somebody do that
[51:03] conformity bias the
[51:07] even the group thing the echo chamber
[51:08] it's like that this i want to be a part
[51:10] of the group
[51:11] they did the study one time and 97
[51:15] of the people in the study answered
[51:18] wrong
[51:19] when they knew better it's not that your
[51:22] perception changes necessarily
[51:25] it's not that by the time the fifth
[51:26] person gives the wrong answer you
[51:28] have this epiphany it's like i've been
[51:30] looking at it wrong the whole time
[51:32] you change it because the pressure you
[51:35] change
[51:36] it because you want to conform and then
[51:37] you might actually be trying to convince
[51:38] yourself oh well maybe
[51:40] maybe it is this way maybe it is that
[51:42] way and this is the power of the crowd
[51:44] this is how we
[51:45] many times act contrary to what we know
[51:47] is right
[51:48] and we do it because everyone else is
[51:50] doing it
[51:52] even in things that we know to be very
[51:53] very obvious and it's this should be
[51:55] obvious to everyone
[51:56] but because everyone else has given the
[51:58] wrong answers we've been raised better
[51:59] we see in the message that it's not this
[52:00] way we know the bible teaches
[52:02] differently but because everyone else is
[52:04] doing it it works on us and influences
[52:06] us and because we don't want to be
[52:07] considered to be backslid
[52:09] because we don't want to be
[52:10] non-conformist because we desire to fit
[52:12] in
[52:12] we'll do what everyone else is doing
[52:18] and then they have an in-group bias and
[52:21] i think this is where i was kind of
[52:22] narrowing it down
[52:28] it's a tendency to give preference or
[52:30] preferential treatment
[52:32] to others who belong to the same group
[52:35] and this is hidden head on where the
[52:37] priest and levite were
[52:38] because the reason why they didn't stop
[52:40] and render aid because he wasn't a jew
[52:43] and that's why jesus in answering the
[52:45] question gave the parable because he
[52:46] wanted this lawyer to think
[52:48] about who was in his group who he
[52:50] considered his neighbor
[52:52] who he considered a friend and not have
[52:54] a way of categorizing people
[52:56] so you don't have to behave correctly
[52:58] towards them
[53:00] well since they're not really my
[53:01] neighbor i don't need to be neighborly
[53:03] that's that's the notion that jesus was
[53:05] challenging he's challenging groupthink
[53:07] he's challenging group identity he's
[53:10] challenging how we can get
[53:11] this conformity bias that sweep people
[53:13] up into these extreme stances
[53:15] and this in-group bias is our tendency
[53:18] to prefer
[53:19] others and to give preferential
[53:20] treatment to those who belong to the
[53:22] same group
[53:24] and what's remarkable is you don't even
[53:27] have to have a strong
[53:28] relationship with the group identity in
[53:30] other words this prejudice exists
[53:32] even when people are randomly put into
[53:34] groups
[53:36] you're just going to randomly put people
[53:37] into groups and it's not because of
[53:39] their age it's not because their weight
[53:40] it's not because of their location it's
[53:41] not because of what they like and don't
[53:43] like
[53:43] you just randomly put people into groups
[53:45] and they still get
[53:46] swept up and we're the group
[53:50] so really the group itself the making of
[53:52] the group is meaningless the
[53:53] the identity of the group is mean is
[53:55] it's just the fact that we're all in a
[53:56] group
[53:58] and this prejudice works on people and
[54:00] this is what leads to extending
[54:01] privileges to those
[54:02] who are in the group but denying the
[54:04] privilege to those who are outside of
[54:05] the group
[54:07] it's this in-group bias that actually
[54:09] leads to discrimination and prejudice
[54:12] it's what creates unequal outcomes some
[54:15] people get preferred a certain way
[54:17] their outcome is better unequal
[54:19] treatment
[54:20] so it causes hypocrisy because you treat
[54:23] some people one way others another
[54:25] and so there's a disparity in action
[54:27] versus what you say
[54:30] and so there was a study that was done
[54:32] it was called the the the robbers the
[54:34] robbers cave study robbers k was a
[54:36] reference to a camp i think was in
[54:37] seriously arkansas
[54:39] and so they did a study and in this
[54:42] study
[54:43] they took 22 boys they're all 11 years
[54:46] old
[54:47] and they were invited to a fake summer
[54:49] camp if summer camp wasn't bad enough
[54:51] this was a fake one
[54:53] and as they took these 22 boys they
[54:55] separated them into
[54:56] two different groups of 11. and one team
[54:59] was called the eagles
[55:00] and the other one called the rattlers
[55:02] and because of our group thinking
[55:04] we all are biased for the eagles
[55:08] right we're already cheering for the
[55:10] eagles
[55:11] and we don't know who these boys are
[55:12] it's just a group of 11 year old boys
[55:14] they're called the eagles plus god i
[55:15] hope they win
[55:17] by the other group called rattlers don't
[55:18] they know the serpent in the beginning
[55:20] just by giving them names we've just
[55:22] we've said this one's serpent seed and
[55:24] this one's the bride
[55:27] because it's our group think and we're
[55:29] thinking yeah which one's the rattler
[55:31] oh yeah this kid here it's gotta be him
[55:32] don't have a shirt on
[55:34] kid with these beetle bangs over there
[55:35] yeah we're already figuring out who the
[55:38] rat would this has got to be an eagle
[55:39] nice short high and tight smiling shirt
[55:41] tucked in
[55:43] right and we can pretty much just sit
[55:45] there and figure out who's an eagle
[55:46] who's a rattler
[55:48] and so they had a group of 11 boys they
[55:50] were in a group called the eagles they
[55:51] had another group of
[55:52] 11 boys all of them 11 years old and
[55:54] they're the rattlers
[55:55] and so they're separated and they only
[55:57] interacted when they were competing
[55:59] in various activities so they never saw
[56:02] each other they didn't
[56:03] fellowship socialize they only did it
[56:05] when they were competing they only met
[56:06] up when they were competing with each
[56:07] other
[56:08] so the dynamic was we're the eagles
[56:11] we're the rattlers and we're always
[56:13] competing against the eagles or
[56:14] competing against the rattlers
[56:16] and then as they begin to interact
[56:18] through these competitions
[56:19] the two teams showed increasing
[56:21] hostility towards each other
[56:23] which eventually led to violence
[56:27] and the hostility so there's no they
[56:30] haven't been put into camps
[56:31] because these people from south arkansas
[56:33] the others are from north arkansas
[56:34] this one's a yankee this one's a rebel
[56:36] they weren't categorized that way
[56:38] without any other uh a means of
[56:40] separation it's just you're an eagle
[56:42] you're you're a rattler and then we're
[56:44] going to compete and then they got so
[56:46] swept up and we're eagles and we're
[56:48] rattlers that they actually begin to
[56:50] uh impose violence on one another
[56:54] and they're a hostile to each other
[56:57] and one of the most sound conclusions
[56:59] they come to is that
[57:01] it's a demonstration of how just group
[57:03] identity can become the foundation of
[57:04] conflict
[57:06] just group identity alone that i'm part
[57:09] of a group you're part of another group
[57:13] that's reason enough to be hostile
[57:14] towards you
[57:16] that's reason enough to not love you
[57:18] like i should that's reason enough not
[57:19] to be neighborly
[57:22] oh well i won't punch you in the face i
[57:25] had a brother tell me that one time
[57:27] we're in a conversation he said and i
[57:28] was standing
[57:29] standing here the brother was standing
[57:30] there there's another brother right here
[57:31] and he said see this brother here and he
[57:33] pointed to me and i'm like yes
[57:34] he said i want to punch him in the face
[57:36] right now i'm like what
[57:38] he says but i can't he's my brother and
[57:41] i thought oh my goodness well i'm glad
[57:43] he's got that
[57:43] bias in his mind you know at least he
[57:46] thought i was a brother because at the
[57:48] time i didn't really think he was my
[57:49] brother and i thought swing ahead you
[57:50] know go ahead swing i'm not really your
[57:52] brother
[57:53] but there this is where people if they
[57:54] can if you're not my brother i can take
[57:56] a swing at you
[57:58] if you're a rattler i can take a swing
[57:59] at you i'm an eagle you're a rattler
[58:02] they got so swept up in these groups
[58:03] they actually became
[58:04] violent towards one another
[58:06] eleven-year-old boys all they had to do
[58:08] was be put into groups
[58:10] and they could hate each other put into
[58:12] groups and they could be violent towards
[58:14] each other
[58:20] and it's these biases
[58:24] that harm our relationships with people
[58:27] who don't belong to our group
[58:32] i'm still asking the question who's my
[58:34] neighbor and we're not just neighborly
[58:37] to those who fit in our social circle
[58:39] or fit our group and paul is looking at
[58:43] this in second corinthians chapter 10
[58:44] verse 12
[58:46] for we dare not make ourselves of the
[58:48] number or compare ourselves with some
[58:50] that commend themselves supply their
[58:52] supply testimonials about themselves
[58:54] those that put themselves forward
[58:55] they're always bragging it's a very
[58:56] interesting statement where paul says
[58:58] i'm not so bold as to compare myself or
[59:00] to put myself in their shoes but he says
[59:02] but they
[59:03] measuring themselves by themselves
[59:05] measuring themselves
[59:06] among themselves and and to each other
[59:09] and comparing themselves among
[59:10] themselves
[59:11] are not wise we as humans are wired to
[59:15] compare it's hardwired in your mind
[59:17] you're going to compare and it's
[59:18] actually good at times to compare
[59:21] but it becomes a it becomes a a negative
[59:23] to us it becomes this cognitive bias
[59:25] because we're wired to compare so we
[59:27] compare ourselves with others who are in
[59:29] our group
[59:29] we compare groups with other groups and
[59:31] this is what makes social groups very
[59:33] very dangerous
[59:34] is because we're always comparing
[59:35] ourselves to those who are around us
[59:38] and because of these things that are in
[59:40] our hearts and these things that are in
[59:41] our minds
[59:42] the conformity bias the bandwagon effect
[59:44] group think echo chamber
[59:46] mob mentality or herb mentality and of
[59:48] this in-group bias and all these things
[59:50] that work within our lives
[59:51] it makes us think and act a certain way
[59:54] and it's all dependent upon what the
[59:56] group is doing
[59:59] maybe if it was always expected and
[1:00:01] priest had this pressure within the
[1:00:03] group
[1:00:03] if you see somebody who's been robbed
[1:00:05] the very least get them back up on their
[1:00:07] feet and give them your cloak and put
[1:00:08] them on their way
[1:00:09] the priest would have acted according to
[1:00:10] the group even if it wasn't in his heart
[1:00:12] he just would have done what the group
[1:00:13] was supposed to do
[1:00:16] because that's how powerful it is but
[1:00:18] the dark side of this group think the
[1:00:20] dark side
[1:00:21] of a group mentality or the sway of the
[1:00:23] crowd is it causes us to treat people
[1:00:25] unfairly
[1:00:27] it causes us to judge others entirely
[1:00:29] upon even their group affiliation
[1:00:32] oh right
[1:00:35] i was fellowshipping with a brother that
[1:00:37] says oh you're from down there
[1:00:39] a condescending way oh oh
[1:00:43] why because just by putting them in a
[1:00:46] category
[1:00:47] just by associating them with a
[1:00:48] particular doctrine we've already put it
[1:00:50] in a category say well these are all the
[1:00:52] characteristics associated with that
[1:00:54] group
[1:00:55] this is how we ought to treat that group
[1:01:03] are you making this real to the church
[1:01:05] you make it real to you personally
[1:01:07] i don't have time to do that i just have
[1:01:09] time to share some of these things with
[1:01:10] you
[1:01:11] but there's so much more that you
[1:01:13] personally can be doing to challenge
[1:01:14] yourself with this
[1:01:17] and i and i i am wanting to challenge
[1:01:19] our our thinking as a church
[1:01:21] we are a group well brother should we
[1:01:23] not have groups no
[1:01:24] no we just don't want to have a group
[1:01:26] think mentality you don't want church
[1:01:28] ever to become an echo chamber
[1:01:30] why because the way that seemeth right
[1:01:31] to a man there's many devices in a man's
[1:01:33] heart
[1:01:34] and if we don't allow the council of the
[1:01:35] lord to remain supreme
[1:01:37] churches become echo chambers if we
[1:01:40] don't allow the council lord to have
[1:01:41] preeminence then we do
[1:01:43] have a hive mentality
[1:01:46] we we just act because the group is
[1:01:48] acting and if i've gone so far in the
[1:01:50] academic side of it and the behavioral
[1:01:52] economic side of it remember what
[1:01:53] brother branham said people go to church
[1:01:54] just because they don't want to be
[1:01:55] thought to be backslid
[1:01:57] people worship because the group thinks
[1:01:58] a certain way brother brahma identified
[1:02:00] these issues within the framework
[1:02:02] of our church the local church in the
[1:02:05] body and how it interacts
[1:02:06] and how we have a group identity when we
[1:02:07] give ourselves a name we have a place
[1:02:09] where we associate
[1:02:10] we have to be aware that there's many
[1:02:12] devices in our hearts and it actually
[1:02:14] will influence our behavior and cause us
[1:02:16] to be a certain way
[1:02:17] when we don't want to be influenced by
[1:02:18] the group we want to be influenced by
[1:02:20] the word
[1:02:22] and i'm not just referring to a church
[1:02:24] identity when we talk about groups well
[1:02:26] this church and that doctrine these
[1:02:27] different groups
[1:02:28] i'm talking about even about groups
[1:02:29] within the church itself
[1:02:33] what do we call those clicks
[1:02:36] and though there is uh the sociology on
[1:02:40] this
[1:02:41] to suggest that there's this inherent uh
[1:02:43] desire to be a part of a group
[1:02:45] or be part of a clique and it's just
[1:02:47] it's innate in us and it's not harmful
[1:02:49] but the idea of a clique that's used in
[1:02:50] this in this context that i'm referring
[1:02:52] to
[1:02:53] is it's something that's exclusive or
[1:02:54] privileged
[1:02:56] and a click is associated by the fact
[1:02:59] that others can't just readily join
[1:03:02] you can't just join a click right like
[1:03:05] oh that's a neat click that's all the
[1:03:06] cool guys
[1:03:08] i'm just going to join you at your lunch
[1:03:09] table like who are you man
[1:03:11] you're not even rolling up your pants
[1:03:12] right
[1:03:14] right are those guest genes now if
[1:03:16] you're not wearing your bows you can't
[1:03:17] be part of this group
[1:03:19] i'm just dating myself here purposely
[1:03:21] being 80s for you
[1:03:24] but there's a way that people are put
[1:03:25] into categories you just can't readily
[1:03:26] join
[1:03:28] you can't just be part of that group why
[1:03:29] it becomes a click that you're not it's
[1:03:31] not
[1:03:32] it's not easy to join it's exclusive
[1:03:33] it's privileged and you know what
[1:03:36] it's only a click if you aren't in it
[1:03:39] right well those people over there
[1:03:43] you know that's just a click right right
[1:03:46] people
[1:03:48] i mean it's the pot calling the kettle
[1:03:50] black it's only a click if you're not in
[1:03:52] it but then your group
[1:03:54] like one buddy one brother told me one
[1:03:56] time he said man
[1:03:57] that church nobody fellowships and
[1:04:00] nobody gets together
[1:04:01] and there's seven or eight families that
[1:04:03] feel the same way i'm like how did that
[1:04:05] happen
[1:04:05] well we all got together and talked
[1:04:06] about it
[1:04:08] help me out here nobody gets together
[1:04:12] seven or eight families got together to
[1:04:13] talk about it well it sounds like you've
[1:04:14] got your group that's getting together
[1:04:16] what because it's not a click if it's a
[1:04:19] click if you're not in it since you
[1:04:20] weren't part of
[1:04:21] that click and i say that just to
[1:04:23] challenge ourselves can we be part of a
[1:04:24] clique but we wouldn't call it that
[1:04:27] because we're in it and this is how
[1:04:30] sides are formed
[1:04:32] this is how we take sides on an issue or
[1:04:34] situation that leads to divisive
[1:04:36] behavior
[1:04:37] i'm very i'm very conscious of the time
[1:04:39] here i realize it's a wednesday night
[1:04:42] but we're not just talking about being
[1:04:43] part of a group but now within a group
[1:04:45] you can have cliques or different groups
[1:04:47] and they form a side because of an issue
[1:04:48] that comes up and because there's an
[1:04:50] issue that raises up people quick to
[1:04:52] take sides and in taking sides
[1:04:54] at least a divisive behavior well the
[1:04:56] eagles are on this side and all the
[1:04:57] rattlers are on this other side well
[1:04:59] don't you all go to the same church oh
[1:05:00] no well yeah but
[1:05:03] i'm pro-drums i'm anti-drums and i'm
[1:05:06] pro-single cup for communion and i want
[1:05:07] multiple cups and
[1:05:08] pro master and time mask could you
[1:05:10] imagine a church splitting because of a
[1:05:12] position on mask
[1:05:19] the brother brand makes this statement
[1:05:20] he's talking about branham he says a
[1:05:22] little fuss can come up in the church
[1:05:23] and branham tabernacle
[1:05:26] he says it's okay i can say this i'm at
[1:05:27] home now he says a little fuss can come
[1:05:30] up the church and branham tabernacle
[1:05:31] and they'll form a little clique and one
[1:05:34] get on one side and one on the other
[1:05:37] within the branham tabernacle which
[1:05:39] would be a group a fuss raise up and
[1:05:41] then people start taking sides
[1:05:44] i notice what the scripture says
[1:05:46] philippians 2 3 let nothing be done
[1:05:48] through strife now the word strife to us
[1:05:52] is immediately contention fighting right
[1:05:55] but the word that's used for strife here
[1:05:57] is politicking or electioneering
[1:06:01] let nothing be done to make a party
[1:06:05] let nothing be done to create a group
[1:06:09] let nothing be done that's partisan or
[1:06:11] separates are factious
[1:06:13] that's what the bible's saying is if we
[1:06:16] can make
[1:06:16] groups if we can set people into parties
[1:06:18] if we can put people into categories
[1:06:21] this is how people justify their
[1:06:22] behavior
[1:06:24] this is how people justify their wrong
[1:06:26] attitudes this is why the lawyer
[1:06:28] was so quick to say well who is my
[1:06:29] neighbor because he wanted to justify
[1:06:31] his actions he wanted to justify his
[1:06:33] attitude
[1:06:33] and people actually justify immoral
[1:06:35] behavior and dishonest actions
[1:06:37] just as long as it benefits their group
[1:06:39] or their position
[1:06:41] people not above lying people not above
[1:06:43] hurting people not above
[1:06:44] breaking even the conviction and the
[1:06:46] standards of the word of god just
[1:06:47] because it benefits their group this is
[1:06:49] the danger
[1:06:50] of group thinking this is the danger of
[1:06:52] the sway of the crowd this is the danger
[1:06:54] when people begin to act according to
[1:06:56] group dynamics and not the dynamics of
[1:06:58] the holy spirit let nothing be done
[1:07:00] through party making electioneering
[1:07:02] causing sides splitting people up
[1:07:06] for where envy and his strife is in
[1:07:08] james 3 16
[1:07:09] where envy and strife is there is
[1:07:11] confusion and every
[1:07:14] evil work
[1:07:17] where there's politicking where there's
[1:07:18] electioneering where there's party
[1:07:19] making
[1:07:20] it says there's there is confusion
[1:07:23] and every evil work
[1:07:27] brother brahman says this in revelations
[1:07:28] chapter four part three when he's
[1:07:30] preaching
[1:07:31] uh the church ages revelation of jesus
[1:07:32] christ taking that scripture to submit
[1:07:35] yourself
[1:07:36] he says congregation submit yourself to
[1:07:38] your pastor
[1:07:40] pastor submit yourself to your
[1:07:42] congregation it's not a one-way street
[1:07:44] right we all believe the message don't
[1:07:47] we
[1:07:49] so now speaking to the pastor he says if
[1:07:50] a little click rises up
[1:07:52] don't be on either side submit yourself
[1:07:54] to the whole congregation
[1:07:56] so you're going to submit to what is
[1:07:58] beneficial and what's best
[1:07:59] for the whole congregation don't take
[1:08:02] signs in it don't split it up don't harm
[1:08:04] it
[1:08:04] to submit yourself to the whole
[1:08:05] congregation he says congregation
[1:08:07] if you start in a click submit yourself
[1:08:09] to your pastor in the fear of god he's
[1:08:11] addressing
[1:08:12] the the tendency for people to be
[1:08:13] factious he said a little fuss rises up
[1:08:15] they'll form a little click one get on
[1:08:16] one side one another he's saying
[1:08:18] submit yourselves one to another and
[1:08:20] submitting yourselves one to another the
[1:08:22] congregation to the pastor
[1:08:23] pastor of the congregation you can bind
[1:08:25] yourselves together and keep yourself
[1:08:27] from being divisive
[1:08:28] infectious because when things are done
[1:08:31] merely for part of making
[1:08:32] party making or partisanship that's
[1:08:35] where there's confusion in every evil
[1:08:37] work
[1:08:44] there are many devices in a man's heart
[1:08:48] nevertheless the counsel of the lord
[1:08:50] that
[1:08:51] shall stand got a lot of ways that we
[1:08:54] think
[1:08:55] a lot of ways that we process
[1:08:57] information just to get along with one
[1:08:58] another
[1:08:59] just to be able to navigate work and
[1:09:00] school and make decisions
[1:09:02] but we're just exposing a dark side to
[1:09:04] our thought process biases that we hold
[1:09:06] within our hearts
[1:09:08] and because we have these biases we can
[1:09:10] be part of a group
[1:09:12] that acts a certain way and does certain
[1:09:14] things and treats people ways
[1:09:16] that makes other people feel isolated
[1:09:19] alone rejected hurt right
[1:09:24] if you're gonna if you can only say amen
[1:09:25] because you feel isolated alone
[1:09:26] rejecting a hurt just saying man i'm
[1:09:28] trying to wrap up
[1:09:29] right i'm not saying you all are part of
[1:09:32] you you're just a bunch of bullies
[1:09:33] tonight
[1:09:34] i'm so glad you came tonight i'm so glad
[1:09:36] you didn't stay home and do netflix
[1:09:39] i'm glad you came because you're afraid
[1:09:40] of being called a backslider no you're
[1:09:42] not the group of bullies but we're
[1:09:43] challenging
[1:09:44] groupthink we're challenging when a
[1:09:46] church culture becomes one
[1:09:48] where it's just everyone going because
[1:09:49] they don't want to be considered a
[1:09:50] certain thing
[1:09:51] everyone acting because they want to fit
[1:09:53] the mold that everyone else is doing
[1:09:54] could you imagine if you had a a a if
[1:09:57] because you have opinions and opinions
[1:09:59] become
[1:10:00] so ingrained within a church or within a
[1:10:02] group that people have to conduct
[1:10:04] themselves and conduct their lives and
[1:10:06] how they raise their children and how
[1:10:08] they act all by someone else's opinion
[1:10:10] or other people's opinions
[1:10:11] and no one has liberty anymore to obey
[1:10:13] the lord well i feel that
[1:10:15] for my home the best thing i can do is
[1:10:18] to send my kids to school i just feel
[1:10:20] led of the lord
[1:10:20] that they go to school they go to
[1:10:21] charter school go to private school but
[1:10:23] then create a culture in a church where
[1:10:24] everyone's looking down
[1:10:25] on the family that's sending their kid
[1:10:26] to school
[1:10:29] and now someone feels forced to home
[1:10:31] school
[1:10:32] because everyone else in the church is
[1:10:34] homeschooling i had a brother call me
[1:10:36] one time
[1:10:36] didn't even say hello said brother aaron
[1:10:38] i said hello he goes brother aaron do
[1:10:39] you have a christmas tree
[1:10:40] and i was like do i have a christmas
[1:10:42] tree and i i was like well
[1:10:46] no he goes okay good he said the church
[1:10:49] i'm at they're
[1:10:50] actually putting they're putting
[1:10:51] pressure on me to have one i thought
[1:10:52] well that's different
[1:10:56] and it ought not be that way it
[1:10:58] shouldn't be that way when someone has a
[1:11:00] an opinion or idea or someone wants to
[1:11:02] live a certain way they want to honor
[1:11:03] the lord with their own convictions who
[1:11:04] are just pervades to the whole group now
[1:11:06] everyone wants to do what everyone else
[1:11:08] is doing
[1:11:08] and they forfeit their liberty in christ
[1:11:10] and they merely conform and everyone's
[1:11:12] going to church because they don't want
[1:11:13] to be backsliders
[1:11:16] right and we all stand up at the same
[1:11:19] time in the songs we all sit down in the
[1:11:20] same songs
[1:11:23] right remember to talk about the pastor
[1:11:25] jerks his head certainly
[1:11:26] everyone else does the same thing it's
[1:11:28] the power of the crowd
[1:11:31] but the bible says this romans chapter
[1:11:34] 12
[1:11:35] verse 2 and be not conformed to this
[1:11:39] world
[1:11:42] when it says be not conformed it implies
[1:11:43] there's a pressure
[1:11:45] implies there's a force that wants to
[1:11:47] mold you to an image
[1:11:49] and we're all susceptible to this in
[1:11:52] group dynamics and broader dynamics
[1:11:54] whether it be americans whether it be
[1:11:56] well maybe it's not
[1:11:57] fit for arizona because it's become more
[1:11:58] like california but in texas there's a
[1:12:00] pride that comes with being in texas
[1:12:02] and you know what you got to learn to
[1:12:03] shed that
[1:12:05] you got to learn to shed the bravado
[1:12:07] over a name where mcgeary's i remember
[1:12:08] the megiers could have such a
[1:12:10] bravado that my cousin leon's like i'm
[1:12:12] only going to marry a mcgear and you're
[1:12:13] kind of like well that doesn't really
[1:12:14] work that way
[1:12:16] well family identity we're mcgearies
[1:12:18] we're texans oh yeah
[1:12:20] lawyers right and
[1:12:23] you create an identity around what
[1:12:24] there's a force there's a pressure be
[1:12:26] not conformed to this world why there's
[1:12:27] a pressure whether it's on a state level
[1:12:29] or country level
[1:12:30] a broader level level to see there's a
[1:12:31] pressure that wants to make you
[1:12:34] conform to a particular image
[1:12:37] and then here's the answer to it be not
[1:12:38] conformed to this world but be ye
[1:12:40] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[1:12:43] and so this transformation
[1:12:44] by this impact upon your mind it does
[1:12:47] this that you may prove what is that
[1:12:48] good
[1:12:49] and acceptable and perfect will of god
[1:12:54] so be not conformed to this world in
[1:12:56] judgment and spirit in an attitude or
[1:12:58] behavior
[1:12:59] but let your behavior prove what is that
[1:13:01] good and acceptable and perfect will of
[1:13:03] god because you've had the devices in
[1:13:05] your heart
[1:13:06] transformed or made subject to the word
[1:13:09] of god
[1:13:10] the renewal of our minds by god's
[1:13:12] transforming power it's the only
[1:13:14] guard or defense against these devices
[1:13:16] in our heart because the devices in our
[1:13:19] hearts
[1:13:19] yield to the pressure of this world to
[1:13:21] conform to the group to conform to a
[1:13:23] group identity
[1:13:24] to conform to group behavior and we want
[1:13:26] to realize that we're not
[1:13:27] merely christians because we're part of
[1:13:29] a christian church we're part of a
[1:13:31] particular group here on earth but we
[1:13:33] have our place
[1:13:34] in a supernatural body
[1:13:38] one that is subject to a head
[1:13:41] one that has the mind of christ
[1:13:45] and so we do not want to be conformed to
[1:13:46] this world but we want to be transformed
[1:13:48] by the renewing of our minds
[1:13:57] that's the only way
[1:14:01] we can overcome these devices in our
[1:14:02] hearts if you'll stand with me
[1:14:05] sister cassandra if you come i like the
[1:14:07] song that she's saying is a special
[1:14:12] feel free to play that all i want to see
[1:14:16] is jesus
[1:14:30] brother man makes this statement in the
[1:14:32] sermon thirsting for life i want this to
[1:14:33] be our
[1:14:35] our preamble to this prayer
[1:14:39] wherever it says the pleasure of a
[1:14:40] christian is serving the lord at the
[1:14:42] house of god
[1:14:44] you don't have to sign no cards you
[1:14:46] can't open the door quick enough
[1:14:48] [Music]
[1:14:50] he's talking about the reason why you go
[1:14:52] to church
[1:14:54] i i'm not speaking cryptically or in
[1:14:57] symbols
[1:14:58] uh my family we moved across the country
[1:15:02] following god's leadership to start a
[1:15:04] church a new church
[1:15:06] so i i god is dealing with my heart of
[1:15:08] what kind of
[1:15:10] what kind of dna is the church going to
[1:15:12] have
[1:15:14] what kind of factors are going to be at
[1:15:15] work do you just want to create
[1:15:18] a dynamic social structure like a social
[1:15:20] community where
[1:15:21] everyone is just benefiting socially we
[1:15:23] could do that and still have a good
[1:15:25] church
[1:15:26] but that's not our goal our goal isn't
[1:15:29] that we would have
[1:15:30] church our goal isn't that we'd have all
[1:15:31] the accoutrements of church and
[1:15:33] we have the things that you need for
[1:15:34] church you have church order you have
[1:15:36] the officers you have this piano player
[1:15:37] you have the song
[1:15:38] we have everything that makes up a
[1:15:39] church without the real vision and
[1:15:41] purpose of a church
[1:15:42] being fulfilled so we're confronting
[1:15:45] them here at the beginning we're
[1:15:46] addressing
[1:15:47] group dynamics and the way groups can
[1:15:49] think because that's not what's
[1:15:50] influencing us that's that's what
[1:15:53] causing us to rally together
[1:15:55] the very beginning we're laying these
[1:15:56] things down in the foundation so we can
[1:15:58] always come back to this and challenge
[1:15:59] us you can even challenge me
[1:16:01] brother aaron you said brother aaron you
[1:16:04] read this quote this is what you were
[1:16:06] wanting this church to be founded on
[1:16:07] this is the very basis for the
[1:16:09] leadership of the lord that's reaching
[1:16:10] out to the lost and the hurting
[1:16:12] and the scattered sheep this is the
[1:16:13] reason why we came together not for
[1:16:15] politics not for party making
[1:16:16] and not to have some kind of dynamic
[1:16:18] social gathering but that the will of
[1:16:20] god would be done
[1:16:24] and we're looking at who is my neighbor
[1:16:27] who is it is it only those that go to
[1:16:29] our church
[1:16:32] is only those that believe that the
[1:16:34] seals are open
[1:16:35] [Music]
[1:16:37] because those dynamics that work that
[1:16:38] caused this lawyer to justify himself
[1:16:41] that caused the thieves to harm a man
[1:16:43] and hurt him and strip him of his
[1:16:45] clothing and take his possessions
[1:16:46] the the the pressure that worked upon
[1:16:48] the priest to cause him to walk by the
[1:16:50] pressure that worked upon the levite to
[1:16:52] forsake
[1:16:52] rendering aid all those group dynamics
[1:16:55] and group pressures
[1:16:56] work upon you now to even do as brother
[1:16:58] branham said you go to church because
[1:17:00] you don't want people to think your
[1:17:01] back's lit
[1:17:02] you worship because you think if you
[1:17:05] don't
[1:17:06] the neighbor is going to think your
[1:17:08] back's lit
[1:17:08] [Music]
[1:17:10] so he says the pleasure of a christian
[1:17:12] is serving the lord at the house of god
[1:17:14] you don't have to sign cards you can't
[1:17:17] open the door quick enough
[1:17:20] all right for the christian and if the
[1:17:23] members of the church
[1:17:24] love one or another enough instead of
[1:17:27] the little clicks and pulling away from
[1:17:29] the church
[1:17:30] they love one another enough he says
[1:17:32] brother if you love one another so much
[1:17:34] that it hurts your heart till you get
[1:17:36] together again
[1:17:37] that's the way it should be that's the
[1:17:40] kind of atmosphere i want the word to
[1:17:42] promote for our church
[1:17:44] kind of love that we have for each other
[1:17:46] not a cult of personality
[1:17:48] not a love for church order not a love
[1:17:50] for going to church
[1:17:52] but a real love for one another
[1:17:55] that's the way it should be he begins to
[1:17:57] quote the song blessed be the tithe that
[1:17:59] binds our hearts and christian love
[1:18:01] the fellowship of kindred mind is like
[1:18:03] to that above
[1:18:04] when we asunder part it gives us inward
[1:18:07] pain but we shall
[1:18:09] still be joined in heart and hope to
[1:18:11] meet again
[1:18:13] he says oh god if we have to take
[1:18:16] every miracle out of the church we have
[1:18:19] to take out all the pipe organs
[1:18:21] and the plush pews give us back to that
[1:18:25] godly love
[1:18:26] brotherly love among the people in
[1:18:27] fellowship if you have to do all that
[1:18:30] take it back to that again
[1:18:34] wow did you did you did it hit you like
[1:18:36] you hit me
[1:18:37] if you have to take out the pews take
[1:18:39] out the organs
[1:18:40] take out all the things that makes
[1:18:42] church what we think it makes a church
[1:18:44] he says even take out the miracles but
[1:18:47] just bring us back to brotherly love and
[1:18:49] fellowship and togetherness he says
[1:18:51] do all that and take us back to that
[1:18:54] again
[1:18:56] well i think we're a few steps ahead you
[1:18:58] look around there ain't no pipe organ
[1:18:59] behind that curtain
[1:19:02] there's no pews
[1:19:05] let alone plush ones but even gets down
[1:19:09] to the miracles
[1:19:11] i'd rather have love among the people
[1:19:13] than a bunch of miracles
[1:19:15] i'd rather have love than a dynamic
[1:19:16] worship service i'd rather have
[1:19:18] love than all the signs and wonders and
[1:19:20] testimonies of
[1:19:21] this and testimonies of that and
[1:19:23] comparing ourselves one to another i'd
[1:19:25] rather have
[1:19:26] love amongst us than any of those things
[1:19:31] and he says if you have to do all that
[1:19:34] just take it back
[1:19:36] to that godly love brotherly love and
[1:19:39] fellowship again
[1:19:41] it's wonderful when you're starting
[1:19:44] because then you don't have to ask god
[1:19:45] to take out the plush pews
[1:19:49] you don't have to ask god to take out
[1:19:50] the the screaming be three hammond
[1:19:53] organ you just say lord at the beginning
[1:19:56] establish
[1:19:57] us build us upon love
[1:20:01] godly love and brotherly love among the
[1:20:03] people and fellowship
[1:20:04] let's bow our heads
[1:20:12] and everything that i hold dear
[1:20:16] lay before the holy
[1:20:20] consuming fire
[1:20:27] and almighty every prayer
[1:20:31] said all my knees lay
[1:20:34] before the holy
[1:20:38] consuming fire
[1:20:42] and all i want to see is
[1:20:47] jesus
[1:20:51] all i want to see
[1:20:54] is him in me
[1:20:59] and all i want to see
[1:21:02] is jesus
[1:21:06] [Music]
[1:21:08] shining
[1:21:10] through me all i want to
[1:21:13] [Music]
[1:21:26] is
[1:21:28] [Music]
[1:21:40] is
[1:21:43] through me with our heads bowed i want
[1:21:46] you to ponder even the words to this
[1:21:47] song
[1:21:48] could you say lord that's what i want
[1:21:52] i want them when they see me they see
[1:21:54] jesus
[1:21:56] even if it might initially be a fearful
[1:21:59] sight upon the water
[1:22:00] let them see jesus even if the image
[1:22:04] that first strikes their eye
[1:22:06] is one that they're not familiar with
[1:22:08] and may cause fear
[1:22:10] let me have the kind of character that
[1:22:12] could say fear not
[1:22:14] let me have the kind of love that could
[1:22:16] break down barriers and prejudice and
[1:22:18] defenses
[1:22:20] and allay the fears of somebody who's
[1:22:22] been abused and manhandled in the name
[1:22:24] of the
[1:22:25] christianity with the using the bible
[1:22:31] not as a hammer to build but a hammer to
[1:22:34] destroy
[1:22:36] you know the bible belt means a
[1:22:38] different thing to a lot of people
[1:22:40] it's not just a belt in the geography of
[1:22:42] america where there's a lot of churches
[1:22:44] but it's the thing they've been whipped
[1:22:45] with
[1:22:47] you can build with a hammer but you can
[1:22:48] also crush a man's skull with it
[1:22:52] and we don't want to wield a hammer in
[1:22:54] such a way that it causes people
[1:22:56] to see an image that's contrary to that
[1:23:00] of christ
[1:23:04] let us challenge ourselves tonight
[1:23:08] lord if we're going to be part of a body
[1:23:10] let it be the body of christ
[1:23:13] if we're going to have a mentality let
[1:23:14] it be the mentality of christ
[1:23:17] let nothing be done through strife and
[1:23:19] vainglory but let each
[1:23:21] esteem other better than themselves
[1:23:24] let us not compare ourselves one to
[1:23:26] another let us not succumb
[1:23:27] to group dynamics that cause us to think
[1:23:29] we're better than another oh god help us
[1:23:31] i'm saying this before we pray let it be
[1:23:34] this way in our hearts
[1:23:35] this is our cry lord let them see you
[1:23:38] and me
[1:23:41] let it become a foundation i see how the
[1:23:44] devil would fight this so hard and
[1:23:46] try to scatter thoughts and minds and
[1:23:48] try to work against this oh god let us
[1:23:50] not
[1:23:51] act a part of a group mentality but let
[1:23:54] us act
[1:23:54] as a part of the body of christ truly in
[1:23:58] spirit and in truth
[1:23:59] [Music]
[1:24:00] our gracious heavenly father lord as we
[1:24:02] bow our heads in prayer
[1:24:05] lord i'm closing this service now and
[1:24:07] i'll be dismissing the people
[1:24:10] but father i'm praying that you would
[1:24:13] speak to our hearts through this
[1:24:17] even now lord i believe you have a way
[1:24:19] of just taking things and tying it up
[1:24:22] making sense of things lord there's
[1:24:25] times when
[1:24:27] a brother could preach a series through
[1:24:30] several services
[1:24:32] and then another brother get up and make
[1:24:34] one statement and all of a sudden
[1:24:36] everything this brother's been trying to
[1:24:37] say makes sense
[1:24:40] lord i believe you could do it within
[1:24:41] the context of even this church service
[1:24:43] lord
[1:24:45] the holy spirit could just come and make
[1:24:47] sense of these things that were
[1:24:48] expressed
[1:24:50] lord i don't want us to leave
[1:24:53] and be educated lord in how minds work
[1:24:58] but i would father that we would have a
[1:25:00] healthy distrust for our biases
[1:25:03] a healthy distrust of our prejudice
[1:25:07] a healthy distrust of all these devices
[1:25:10] that are in our hearts
[1:25:11] that quickly cause us to join a group
[1:25:13] and assimilate merely because of devices
[1:25:16] that work within our minds but lord
[1:25:20] may we above all be led as sons and
[1:25:22] daughters of god
[1:25:24] and lord if we're traveling down life's
[1:25:26] way may we be like a good samaritan
[1:25:28] that could act contrary to everyone else
[1:25:30] who walked before
[1:25:31] we can do that which is pleasing in your
[1:25:33] sight
[1:25:35] not even because the group did it not
[1:25:37] even because we were told by
[1:25:38] centralized headquarters what to do but
[1:25:40] lord because we've tapped into your word
[1:25:42] we've tapped into your mind
[1:25:44] we can begin to say and do the things
[1:25:46] that are appropriate
[1:25:48] let it be said lord that we act as
[1:25:51] christians at home
[1:25:53] that we treat others with respect
[1:25:56] that we have friends because we show
[1:25:57] ourselves friendly
[1:25:59] that our enemies are not readily
[1:26:01] identifiable by the way that we look at
[1:26:02] them with contempt or avoid them
[1:26:07] but rather we have a kind of character
[1:26:09] that gives the holy spirit liberty
[1:26:13] commit ourselves to you tonight as we
[1:26:15] close the service as we're soon
[1:26:16] dismissed
[1:26:18] bless the people i pray in the name of
[1:26:20] the lord jesus christ amen
[1:26:25] oh why
