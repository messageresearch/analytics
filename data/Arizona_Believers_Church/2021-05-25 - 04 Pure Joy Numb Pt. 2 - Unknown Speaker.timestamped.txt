[0:00] Psalms 143 and we're going to read the
[0:03] same verse we left read last time, verse
[0:05] four. It says,"Therefore is my spirit
[0:09] overwhelmed within me and my heart
[0:12] within me is desolate." He's writing
[0:14] this because of the enemy which is
[0:15] persecuting him. And he says that as a
[0:18] result of his oppression and as a result
[0:21] of the darkness that he's facing and u
[0:25] the the overwhelming criticism and
[0:27] persecution, he says, "Therefore is my
[0:30] spirit overwhelmed within me. My heart
[0:34] within me is desolate." Amen. God bless
[0:36] you. You can be seated.
[0:40] And continuing on the subject that we uh
[0:42] ministered on last week which has been
[0:44] part of the overall subject of pure joy
[0:48] and a title subtitle being numb. I
[0:51] wanted again just to make a few comments
[0:53] at the beginning because we're I I feel
[0:56] that last week uh was very specific um
[0:59] and maybe not applicable to everyone but
[1:01] we could relate in some way. and I'm
[1:03] wanting to kind of continue on the same
[1:05] theme and maybe not have time to pick up
[1:07] and um put those other parts in it for
[1:10] context. So, if you hadn't heard the
[1:12] first part and you have some questions
[1:14] after this morning, maybe just going
[1:16] back and listening to that uh might help
[1:18] a little bit. But, we're addressing uh
[1:20] the condition of being emotionally numb
[1:23] and this condition of numbness being a
[1:25] hindrance to our experiencing pure joy.
[1:28] And we're we're looking at how that bad
[1:31] experiences or even uh spiritual abuse
[1:34] or certain kinds of events that take
[1:35] place in our lives can kind cause us to
[1:37] kind of turn off. And in doing so, we're
[1:40] we're we disengage and we're kind of
[1:42] we're a little bit of a a drift and
[1:44] we're not really focused. We're not
[1:45] entering in. We're not feeling things.
[1:47] And uh when you even go to church or
[1:49] even you do things as a a spouse or even
[1:52] as a parent and this could be a broad
[1:54] range of applications. You're just kind
[1:56] of going through the motions. there's
[1:58] really no feeling in it. Uh you you're
[2:00] not getting anything out of it. You're
[2:01] kind of just doing it because you know
[2:02] that you should and there's just nothing
[2:04] else available or there's no other
[2:05] options or if I don't do this then this
[2:07] is going to happen. And that's really no
[2:09] way to live. It's no way to live. And so
[2:12] this is uh that's kind of what we're
[2:13] looking at how to certain things can
[2:15] happen and events can take place and
[2:16] when that happens we just kind of uh
[2:18] shut off. We disengage. We turn off.
[2:20] shut down and we're no longer really
[2:22] feeling and going through things with
[2:24] feeling in it uh with a real
[2:26] understanding of purpose. And when that
[2:28] happens, learning to re-engage can be a
[2:30] very difficult process. If anybody's
[2:32] done that where you kind of take a step
[2:34] back and you get arms length or you kind
[2:36] of shut down or you turn things off um
[2:38] or you go are just going through the
[2:40] motions for to change to where you
[2:42] re-engage and it has feeling again and
[2:44] and you really like it and you're
[2:45] excited about. It's a very very
[2:47] difficult process. very hard when
[2:49] something has happened to to wound you
[2:51] or to turn you off or to kind of push
[2:53] you away to overcome this sense that I'm
[2:56] still being pushed. I'm still being
[2:58] harmed. I'm still being hurt and reach
[3:00] past beyond the pain or reach past scars
[3:02] or things that uh bother us and to
[3:04] re-engage.
[3:06] And and that these are just little
[3:08] principles I'm wanting to express here
[3:10] at the outset. And we came to the the
[3:14] emphasis last Sunday that to in order to
[3:17] heal, you need to feel. And that if
[3:21] we're going to be in a position for God
[3:22] to heal us, we're going to be in a
[3:23] position for God to deliver us, we need
[3:25] to start feeling again. And that if
[3:28] we're going to grow, if we're going to
[3:29] mature, if we're going to change, we
[3:31] must have feeling. It's not going to
[3:33] take place just unconsciously for us.
[3:35] It's not going if you're sick in your
[3:37] body a and and you don't feel it, then
[3:39] you're not going to call out to God to
[3:41] heal it. But once you know and once it
[3:43] begins to set in on you, once you begin
[3:44] to experience hardships and difficulties
[3:46] as a result of it, it creates a
[3:48] desperation. And so it's through that
[3:49] feeling and that burden and that that
[3:51] anxiety that you call out to the Lord
[3:53] and he relieves you of your distress and
[3:55] can deliver you. So sometimes this
[3:57] numbness has a negative side effect
[3:59] where you're just going to live with it
[4:00] the rest of your life. Well, I'll just
[4:02] make do. I'll just buckle down and I'll
[4:04] get through this. I'll just become hard
[4:05] to it. I'll get used to it and I won't
[4:07] have to worry about it. And that's kind
[4:09] of the point that we're trying to make
[4:10] that if you're ever going to heal, you
[4:11] need to start feeling again. And in the
[4:14] context of pure joy, if you're going to
[4:15] experience the full joy of the Lord, we
[4:17] need to even begin. For some of us, I'm
[4:19] not saying that all of you are just uh
[4:21] you know, all of you are numb and we're
[4:23] trying to make you feel by kicking you
[4:25] really hard. That's not the emphasis at
[4:26] all. But for some of us, if we're ever
[4:29] going to experience the full joy of the
[4:31] Lord, God's going to have to first start
[4:32] dealing with our numbness and become
[4:34] aware that we have a we're numb and and
[4:36] we're not moved and we're unaffected by
[4:38] the things of God or we we don't have
[4:39] the joy that we used to have. And God's
[4:41] going to have to deal with us in that
[4:42] area. And when he starts to do it, it
[4:44] can cause your heart to race a little
[4:46] bit. You start breathing a little bit
[4:47] faster and you might start to get a
[4:49] little bit a little bit uncomfortable.
[4:51] But instead of running away this time,
[4:53] you ask yourself, God, what is it you're
[4:54] trying to do? Lord, I I want I do I want
[4:57] to feel again. I don't want to feel
[4:58] miserable, but I want to feel joy. And
[5:00] right now, because I'm trying to protect
[5:01] myself from misery, I can't feel
[5:03] anything. And then you have to start
[5:04] trusting in the Lord and letting him
[5:06] begin to do this work that he wants to
[5:08] do. So, that's just a few comments at
[5:10] the outset and the subject of pure joy.
[5:12] We've been uh just really moved by this,
[5:15] been studying it has such a tremendous
[5:17] connection to the things of God that
[5:18] have been taking place in the end time
[5:20] and the open of the word of God. But
[5:22] when we talk about pure joy, it's not
[5:23] just an emotion uh that you can
[5:26] experience when you go on a when you do
[5:27] something thrilling or you go skydiving
[5:29] or you win the lottery, which those are
[5:31] all things that we do all the time. Uh
[5:33] it's not that kind of thrill or that
[5:34] kind of excitement, but it's a harmony.
[5:37] This is how I like to ponder. It's a
[5:38] harmony when all the other emotions are
[5:41] subject to the word. Pure joy is is not
[5:44] that well I don't have any problems with
[5:45] pure joy is in the midst of these other
[5:48] anxieties and these fears and these
[5:50] difficulties and these pains there's a
[5:52] harmony that exists because they become
[5:54] subject to the word of God. I I've got
[5:56] this sickness but I believe God's my
[5:57] healer or man this is a very terrible
[6:00] situation and my heart is broken but
[6:01] God's a comforter. And so you have this
[6:03] harmony to where these emotions you have
[6:06] become subject to the word of God and
[6:08] the word of God which resides within our
[6:10] souls that becomes our source of joy.
[6:11] And therefore it's a pure joy. We've
[6:14] used the we've identified this statement
[6:16] as being a very important one that
[6:17] brother Brad makes. If you're if our
[6:19] faith is set right in the right
[6:21] position, it gives a constant
[6:23] satisfaction. So if our faith is set
[6:26] right and in the right position. So we
[6:27] have faith and we know we have faith.
[6:29] But if there's some kind of unsettled
[6:31] feeling or you're not getting the joy
[6:32] that you want to have, then that faith
[6:34] has to be oriented correctly. It has to
[6:36] be set right and in the right position.
[6:38] And then once it sets right and is in
[6:40] the right position, it gives a constant
[6:43] satisfaction. And that would be a sign
[6:45] to us that when all of a sudden we're
[6:47] not getting the satisfaction that we
[6:49] once got or we know there's more to be
[6:51] satisfied. Then it's not a matter of,
[6:52] oh, I don't have any faith or or or I
[6:55] must not be a believer. No, it's just a
[6:57] matter of getting your faith in the
[6:58] right position. And that should come as
[7:00] a comfort to all of us that it's just a
[7:01] matter of us yielding and finding that
[7:04] place where our faith needs to be. And
[7:08] the joy of the Lord as we're looking at
[7:09] it, this pure joy, it's something that
[7:11] frames our lives.
[7:13] It's not something that we say, well,
[7:16] uh, uh, I just want to be happy all the
[7:17] time. I want to be excited. I want to be
[7:18] bubbling. And we're talking about an
[7:19] emotion. We're talking about a pure joy
[7:21] that kind of frames our lives that no
[7:22] matter what's taking place, no matter
[7:24] what happens, there's something that
[7:26] frames it and gives it context. We know,
[7:28] you know what, difficult things happen
[7:30] and we're really going through a hard
[7:31] time, but God uses this for good or this
[7:33] happens or that happens, but God has a
[7:35] way of bringing this out or oh, I've
[7:37] been here before and I despared and I
[7:38] couldn't think about what I was going to
[7:40] do when I lost that other job, but God
[7:42] gave me a better one and I know this
[7:43] time he can do the same thing. It's
[7:45] something that kind of gives context to
[7:47] things that happens in our lives and
[7:48] it's something that ultimately just
[7:50] upholds our hearts despite any
[7:52] difficulty that's taking place.
[7:54] So pure joy or if we look at what
[7:56] brother Brandham said about constant
[7:57] satisfaction, it's not the absence of
[8:00] negative emotions. To have pure joy
[8:02] doesn't mean that you're never sad. To
[8:03] have pure joy doesn't mean you're not
[8:05] frustrated to but pure joy just it
[8:08] doesn't mean an immunity of from pain.
[8:11] Doesn't mean an immunity from sadness.
[8:13] But pure joy is the product. It's the
[8:15] outcome of pursuing something that has
[8:17] purpose. Pure joy is the product of
[8:19] living a meaningful life. And so we do
[8:22] not flee from pain. Then if we think
[8:25] about this, this is probably where where
[8:27] my emphasis is going to be. We do not
[8:29] run from pain, but we run toward our
[8:31] destiny.
[8:32] That we experience difficulty, hardship,
[8:35] and this hurts and that and that and we
[8:36] want to we kind of back up and we don't
[8:38] want to we want to stop. We want to run
[8:40] away. We want to do things differently
[8:41] so that we don't experience the pain.
[8:42] But we're pursuing a purpose. And in
[8:44] pursuing a purpose, I'm not going to run
[8:46] away from pain if my destiny is on the
[8:48] other side of it. I'm not going to run
[8:50] away from difficulty if what God is
[8:52] calling me to requires me to go through
[8:53] it. And if we just become people are
[8:55] always running from pain and always
[8:57] running away from things that are
[8:58] difficult, you're never going to achieve
[8:59] the destiny that God has for you. Unless
[9:02] we can all be honest, we we don't like
[9:05] generally all uh you know, human beings
[9:07] are do not like change. That's generally
[9:10] what pain signifies. Change is coming.
[9:13] And so we try to avoid it. We don't want
[9:14] to feel it. We don't want to go through
[9:16] it. And it's understandable. And some of
[9:18] us maybe can tolerate a greater pain
[9:19] than others. And some of us may actually
[9:22] uh embrace or you know hate pain more
[9:24] than others. But we have to be able to
[9:26] feel in order to grow and to mature and
[9:29] to come to our destiny. As I posed the
[9:31] question last time, I experienced it in
[9:33] my own life. I don't know if I'm if this
[9:35] is faith or if I'm just numb. And that's
[9:37] a that's a tough spot to be in. Am I
[9:39] unaffected because I'm believing? Am I
[9:41] unaffected because I just know God's
[9:43] going to work things out? or have I gone
[9:45] through this so much I'm just numb to
[9:46] the hurt of it. I'm just numb to the
[9:48] difficulties. I'm just numb to the
[9:50] darkness. I'm just numb to the
[9:51] bleakness. And we don't want to be numb.
[9:52] We want to have faith. Hearts full of
[9:54] faith. And so if you're constantly
[9:57] undergoing pain, if you're constantly
[9:59] experiencing disappointment, this can
[10:01] trigger an emotional defense, an
[10:04] emotional defense mechanism. It's and we
[10:06] do it in order to protect our feelings.
[10:08] We do it in order to protect our
[10:09] thoughts. We don't like to be tormented.
[10:11] We don't like to be discouraged. We
[10:12] don't like to always have this thought
[10:13] that something bad's going to happen.
[10:15] And so when that takes place, when these
[10:17] situations happen and we start going
[10:19] through them, often we get the feeling
[10:21] of, uh-oh, it's happening again. Uh-oh,
[10:23] this is so and so's coming over. Oh no,
[10:26] somebody said something and we shut
[10:27] down. We just want to tune it out. We
[10:29] don't want to think about it. And it's
[10:30] actually your body trying to protect
[10:32] you. It's an emotional defense
[10:34] mechanism. And that's what we read about
[10:36] in Psalms 143:4
[10:39] as you look at it. And we just we'll
[10:40] begin here trying to go forward with
[10:42] that's um kind of marrying the thought
[10:45] of pure joy and numbness together. So
[10:46] you understand the overall vision that
[10:48] we have in our text Psalms 143:4.
[10:52] Therefore is my spirit overwhelmed
[10:54] within me. My heart within me is
[10:57] desolate. He's saying my spirit is
[10:59] wrapped in darkness. I'm shrouded in
[11:01] darkness. I see no way out. It's a
[11:03] helpless situation. I have no vision. I
[11:05] have no hope. And my heart grows numb
[11:08] within me. The only way that he could
[11:10] begin to deal with the constant
[11:12] persecution and the difficulties and the
[11:14] hardships is he retreats into a dark
[11:16] place and he begins to feel such an
[11:17] overwhelmed feeling that it triggers
[11:19] something and his response is shut down.
[11:21] Come become numb to it or you're going
[11:23] to have a panic attack. Become numb to
[11:25] it or you're going to fret and you're
[11:26] going to be anxious. You're going to
[11:27] stop operating, stop functioning. So it
[11:29] says my heart grows numb within me. And
[11:32] this is when you read this, I want you
[11:34] to think about it in your in your sense.
[11:36] I mean this is a human being writing
[11:38] this. This is someone experiences the
[11:40] same emotions you write or that you
[11:42] experience as as this is written of
[11:44] them. This co this this condition even
[11:46] what's being written here and you can
[11:47] relate to this this condition of
[11:49] constantly feeling overwhelmed provoked
[11:51] this defense mechanism of becoming numb.
[11:54] Who wants to be in a state of of horror
[11:56] all the time? Who wants to be in a state
[11:58] of anxiety? And it's the body saying you
[12:00] know what enough's enough. Shut down.
[12:03] And so numb it means to be deprived of
[12:05] power of sensation or movement. Deprived
[12:07] of of movement, deprived of sensation,
[12:10] deprived of feeling where you can't feel
[12:12] anymore. Or deprived of responsiveness.
[12:14] Like something you get uh something hits
[12:16] you, you should experience pain. Or
[12:18] somebody pretends to take a swing at
[12:20] you, you should flinch. But when you're
[12:21] numb, you don't even respond to
[12:23] stimulus. Like this isn't even normal
[12:25] anymore. Normally a person would say,
[12:27] "Oh, that's hot." Or, "No, oh that's
[12:28] cold, or this is that's not good or
[12:30] that's bad." But you get to a place
[12:31] where you're just numb. I was pondering
[12:33] some of the different examples in the
[12:35] scripture how that the prophet was
[12:36] blushing at the sins of Israel and
[12:39] brother Brandham preaching the blushing
[12:40] prophet saying we don't blush anymore.
[12:43] And what was he identifying? We become
[12:44] numb to sin sin and something happens
[12:47] and we don't even blush and go THAT'S
[12:48] HORRIBLE. HOW COULD YOU SAY THAT? How
[12:50] could you do that? Oh my goodness.
[12:52] That's that's awful. But we hear it so
[12:54] often and so often it just gets oh
[12:56] that's just so and so. Oh, that they're
[12:59] just that's just the way they are. And
[13:01] really what we've we just become numb to
[13:03] the horror of it. We become numb to
[13:05] really just how awful it is. And this
[13:08] emotional numbing, it's a a mental and
[13:12] emotional process of just shutting down
[13:14] your feelings. So, it may not have to do
[13:16] with I'm not talking about maybe the
[13:18] physical numbness, but we use the
[13:20] physical numbness to kind of understand
[13:22] what we may be meaning by emotional
[13:23] numbness. But it's just the shutting
[13:25] down of feelings. And when you shut down
[13:27] your feelings, you're you're it results
[13:30] in an inability to feel emotions. But
[13:33] ponder this. It results in an inability
[13:36] to express emotions. So, well, I'm going
[13:38] to shut down because I don't want to
[13:40] feel pain. But if you shut down because
[13:42] you don't want to feel pain, you may not
[13:43] be able to express kindness. You shut
[13:45] down because you're afraid to be hurt,
[13:47] you may not be able to express love or
[13:48] healing, emotions of healing. And you
[13:50] find that you have an emotional
[13:52] paralysis to where I don't want to be
[13:53] hurt, so I can't engage. I can't love. I
[13:55] can't act. I can't do things. Uh uh to
[13:57] show that I love because I'm so busy
[13:59] trying to protect my heart from being
[14:01] hurt. And as they have a physical
[14:03] diagnosible condition called a cognitive
[14:05] insensitivity to pain and where some an
[14:08] actual person will not feel pain. They
[14:10] could jump off a balcony and break their
[14:12] leg and just try to stand up like
[14:13] nothing happened. They can put their
[14:15] hand on a hot stove and it begin to melt
[14:17] their flesh and they won't feel
[14:18] anything. And there's something
[14:19] neurologically long wrong with their
[14:21] body and they can't experience pain. We
[14:24] can get to that place where emotionally
[14:25] we get so beat up and battered to where
[14:27] we just don't feel anything anymore. And
[14:29] for some people, maybe it doesn't take
[14:31] an emotional battery and they're just
[14:32] born like a cyborg and nothing ever
[14:34] phases them. They don't care and it
[14:36] doesn't bother them and they're unmoved
[14:37] and you're just wanting them to feel a
[14:39] little bit. But that's the point I'm
[14:40] trying to make and the thing I'm trying
[14:41] to identify is that we can get to a
[14:43] place where we're insensitive and we're
[14:45] not feeling anymore.
[14:47] There's ways that you could you could
[14:49] ask yourself, well, am I is this me? Am
[14:51] I going through this? is do I engage in
[14:53] this? And some of the warning signs
[14:55] where you're becoming emotionally numb
[14:57] is you're not enjoying positive things
[15:00] that you once enjoyed. I used to love
[15:02] this. Get nothing out of it now. This
[15:04] used to be fun. I used to look forward
[15:05] to it. I I used to I used to want to do
[15:07] this. But you begin to lose interest in
[15:09] things that were positive that you
[15:11] derived a tremendous benefit from or
[15:13] derived pleasure from. But now you begin
[15:15] to lose interest in it. Another warning
[15:17] sign you sign is you begin to detach
[15:19] become detached from others. you begin
[15:21] to disengage. You get away from
[15:22] fellowship. You're no longer involved.
[15:24] These are warning signs of becoming
[15:26] emotionally numb.
[15:28] And I'm I'm not just uh didn't sign you
[15:30] all up for a psychology class
[15:33] uh where this it m we're emotional
[15:35] beings. So, we can't just disregard
[15:37] emotions like you're going to leave your
[15:38] emotions at the door and you're just
[15:39] going to bring your soul in here and I'm
[15:41] just going to preach the word and feed
[15:42] your faith and forget about your
[15:43] emotions. No, that that's being naive.
[15:46] That's absolutely being naive. Even
[15:48] after you've been born again by the
[15:49] baptism of the Holy Ghost, it the the
[15:51] Holy Ghost is constantly wanting to have
[15:53] preeminence in our emotions. So, it has
[15:55] to address our emotions in a very
[15:57] special way. And so, the the really the
[16:00] I don't want you to kind of lose sight
[16:01] of, well, I I don't feel like I'm
[16:03] emotional numb. I'm strong emotionally.
[16:04] These things are great. Brother Aaron's
[16:05] just using psychology this morning. When
[16:07] I'm talking about being emotionally
[16:08] numb, it's something that impacts our
[16:10] spiritual well-being or is an evidence
[16:13] of our spiritual well-being not being
[16:15] healthy.
[16:17] So, it's a dangerous place to be
[16:18] emotionally and spiritually numb to
[16:21] where you're lacking sensitivity or
[16:22] you're just shell shocked. I've been
[16:23] through so much. I'm just not even
[16:25] phased anymore.
[16:27] In Hebrews chapter 4:15,
[16:30] we were um emphasizing this scripture
[16:32] last time. It's such a beautiful
[16:34] scripture. For we have not a high priest
[16:36] which cannot be touched with the feeling
[16:39] of our infirmities, but was in all
[16:41] points tempted like as we are, yet
[16:43] without sin.
[16:45] We read it this way. We have a high
[16:48] priest who can be touched with the
[16:50] feeling of our infirmities. And so he
[16:53] has compassion not because we have
[16:55] infirmities, but because he can
[16:57] understand and relate to and be
[16:59] empathetic about the feeling of our
[17:00] infirmities. He can be touched by the
[17:02] feeling of our infirmities. It means
[17:04] he's provoked to compassion as a result
[17:06] of our infirmities because of his own
[17:08] temptation. He can relate to how we must
[17:10] feel. He can relate to what we must be
[17:12] going through. And so when we read this,
[17:14] we our takeaway is Christ knows how we
[17:17] feel and how I feel is relevant. He
[17:20] said, "Oh, it doesn't matter about your
[17:21] feelings." Well, it matters to God how
[17:23] you feel.
[17:24] As a father who's concerned about his
[17:26] children, and I realize it takes some
[17:27] qualification because you know, people
[17:29] right now just writing very fervently.
[17:30] Did you hear what he said? And they're
[17:32] just on the table looking up quotes
[17:34] about it doesn't have nothing to do with
[17:35] feelings. Wow. I'm talking about God's
[17:38] care and love for you where he's wants
[17:40] to demonst he's he's demonstrating to
[17:42] you that what you're going through
[17:43] matters to him because he can be touched
[17:46] by the feeling of your infirmities and
[17:48] and you can look at Christ who is the
[17:50] high priest who is in all points tempted
[17:52] like as we were and can be touched with
[17:53] the feeling of our infirmities. This is
[17:55] someone who is deeply in tune with his
[17:57] own emotions. He Christ was not
[17:59] emotionalist.
[18:01] Christ was not a robot who just kind of
[18:03] went through things and said, "You can
[18:04] want to stone me, but it won't bother me
[18:06] at all." And and he didn't create the
[18:08] mantra, "Sticks and stones may break my
[18:10] bones, but your words will never hurt
[18:12] me." He was very honest about his
[18:14] feelings. He expressed his feelings
[18:15] often. In Matthew 9:36, watch this. It
[18:19] says, "But when he saw the multitudes,
[18:21] he was moved with compassion on them."
[18:24] Why was he moved with compassion for the
[18:26] people? Because they fainted. They gave
[18:29] up. They were becoming numb. They were
[18:30] hurt. They were weary and they were
[18:32] scattered abroad and as as sheep having
[18:34] no shepherd. So he could see these
[18:36] people who had fainted and they were
[18:38] weary because they'd been broken. They'd
[18:40] been wounded. They'd been scattered and
[18:41] they were like sheep without a shepherd.
[18:43] And he didn't just look at them and tell
[18:44] them, "Oh, God gave you a promise to
[18:46] suck it up and be faithful and look for
[18:48] the Messiah." He had compassion on them
[18:50] because he knew that those circumstances
[18:52] they went through were not without
[18:54] consequence.
[18:55] that here's sheep without shepherds and
[18:57] without a shepherd and can they trust
[18:59] again? Can they love? Can they be can
[19:01] they come back under the fold and he has
[19:03] a he has a a feeling for them. HE'S
[19:05] MOVED WITH COMPASSION BECAUSE of their
[19:07] situation, their emotional situation.
[19:11] In Isaiah 53:3,
[19:15] he is despised and rejected of men a man
[19:18] of sorrows and acquainted with grief.
[19:23] Now, that's this is the Messiah we're
[19:26] talking about. He's despised and
[19:29] rejected. Well, we can maybe accept that
[19:30] just very readily. No, people just don't
[19:32] accept the word. And when the word
[19:33] comes, he's despised. It's rejected.
[19:35] It's hated. But now, notice the
[19:37] consequence of the rejection or
[19:39] consequence of being despised. A
[19:41] consequence of being called to what he
[19:42] was called to. He is characterized now
[19:44] as a man of sorrows, acquainted with
[19:47] grief. That he himself was sorrowful. He
[19:50] himself experienced distressing
[19:52] emotions. He is now characterized,
[19:54] generally characterized as being a man
[19:56] of sorrows. And that he's so acquainted
[19:58] with grief, he's familiar with it. He
[19:59] knows what it's like. It's not a man
[20:02] that merely knows your sorrow or a man
[20:04] that knows your grief, but it's a man
[20:06] himself who is characterized as being
[20:08] sorrowful and is being characterized as
[20:10] one with grief.
[20:13] John 11:33, I just wanted to use one
[20:15] scripture to point this out. When Jesus
[20:18] therefore saw her weeping and the Jews
[20:20] also weeping which came with her, this
[20:22] is at the resurrection of Lazar.
[20:23] Lazarus, he groaned in the spirit and
[20:26] was troubled.
[20:28] This is something that's written about
[20:30] Jesus. He he doesn't see the weeping and
[20:32] the unbelief and the fanaticism and he's
[20:34] immune to it. He's not moved by it. I'm
[20:37] just conducting myself above all this
[20:38] nonsense. No, he groans in his spirit
[20:41] and is troubled by it.
[20:42] Right?
[20:43] He's a man of sorrows, acquainted with
[20:44] grief. He's moved on uh with compassion
[20:47] about the circumstances of other people.
[20:49] He groans in his spirit and is troubled
[20:51] when he sees the Jews weeping who wanted
[20:53] to kill him by the way just at that very
[20:55] moment and going out with her something
[20:57] has grown in his spirit and he's
[20:58] troubled. I would say at the very least
[21:00] and and I mentioned this quite often
[21:02] that when we see scriptures like this
[21:04] and you see Elijah under a juniper tree
[21:06] and you see these different examples in
[21:08] the scripture, you see even the example
[21:09] with our messenger how despondent he ca
[21:11] became after the loss of his wife and
[21:13] his daughter. this seeing these things
[21:15] should at the very least remove the
[21:17] stigma of going through things back
[21:20] battling things emotionally.
[21:22] I think that maybe the worst thing that
[21:23] comes with it sometimes is the stigma.
[21:26] Oh, well, you're just weak mentally. Oh,
[21:28] you just have mental health issues. I'm
[21:30] just concerned about your mental health.
[21:32] A and and and because you're just weak
[21:34] in your mind and and there's a stigma
[21:36] that comes with it and and there's even
[21:39] a language that we can use about certain
[21:41] things to where it places a stigma on it
[21:44] and then once it's stigmatized someone
[21:45] who's going through this you stigmatize
[21:47] it. They're not going to stick their
[21:49] head up and say, "Oh, well, you know
[21:50] what? I'm struggling with that. I could
[21:51] really use some help." They don't want
[21:52] to be labeled.
[21:54] They don't want to be labeled the
[21:55] makebeliever. They don't want to be
[21:56] labeled someone who's weak or well, you
[21:58] just need the Holy Ghost. And so by
[22:00] looking at these things, it should at
[22:01] the very least remove the stigma. But I
[22:04] think the next step for me would be want
[22:05] you to understand or at least it give
[22:08] you faith to believe that he has a
[22:10] remedy for your emo painful emotions.
[22:13] That if he can be touched with the
[22:14] feeling of my infirmities and he knows
[22:16] what it's like to grow in his spirit and
[22:17] be troubled. He's a man of sorrows
[22:19] acquainted with grief. He had compassion
[22:21] upon those who faint and are scattered
[22:22] and wounded. Then it shows that this is
[22:24] a part of the HIGH PRIEST THAT I WANT TO
[22:27] TOUCH. THIS IS PART OF THE HIGH PRIEST
[22:28] who can enter in empathetically to what
[22:30] I'm going through and not just say, "Oh,
[22:32] I'm so sorry." But can actually have a
[22:34] solution for it. Give us faith to
[22:37] believe that he can remedy, he can heal
[22:39] our pain.
[22:41] There's a lot that could be said about
[22:42] emotions,
[22:44] but emotions are conscious experiences
[22:46] that are characterized by some thought
[22:48] process, some kind of mental activity.
[22:50] So, it's something we're conscious of
[22:51] and aware of, and whatever degree of
[22:54] pleasure or displeasure that it brings
[22:56] us. So this is things that are in our
[22:58] spirit, our mind. We're thinking, "Wow,
[23:00] I I am experiencing right now the
[23:02] feeling of joy. I'm experiencing right
[23:03] now the feeling of pain. I'm
[23:05] experiencing the feeling right now of
[23:06] rejection or jealousy." Those are
[23:07] emotions. And emotions are critical for
[23:11] to function healthy. If we're going to
[23:14] have a healthy function of our of our
[23:16] person, then our emotions are critical.
[23:18] Think of your emotions as feedback
[23:20] mechanisms.
[23:22] And we and the same way that the sense
[23:24] of touch and something's hot, it'll burn
[23:27] you. Uh is a feedback mechanism to say,
[23:29] well, don't touch that or don't leave
[23:30] your hand on it too long or don't drink
[23:32] that it's too hot. The same way that our
[23:34] emotions give us feedback for our
[23:35] protection. They give us feedback for
[23:38] preservation. You know that I noticed in
[23:40] my family in my two oldest that there
[23:43] was uh the with Elliott, he was
[23:45] immediately sensed when something was
[23:47] kind of dangerous. Like he's like, "Uh,
[23:49] why are you putting me on top of the
[23:50] refrigerator?
[23:51] But it looks funny, you know, just let
[23:53] me do it. It's like no, but like with
[23:55] Preston, I mean, it's kind of like, is
[23:57] that all you got? You can't get me any
[23:58] higher. And so, one maybe has this sense
[24:01] of this is risky, this is dangerous. The
[24:02] other one, I I don't know. This is is
[24:04] this good? Everything seems fine. And
[24:06] I'm not the I'm not the type that likes
[24:08] to, you know, would go to a lake and try
[24:09] to find the highest spot and let's jump
[24:11] off of it. I mean, I just start kind of
[24:13] uh locking up just with the thought of
[24:14] it. You know what? Why don't we just
[24:15] play Take the Name of Jesus with you. I
[24:17] think I'm about to have a panic attack
[24:18] just thinking about it. But others ARE
[24:20] LIKE, "LET'S DO IT. THAT'S GREAT. LET'S
[24:22] KEEP DOING IT." And they're all into it.
[24:23] And that's just this sense of of risk or
[24:26] danger. And some people have none.
[24:28] Others have maybe too much. But that's
[24:30] what our emotions do. They give us
[24:32] feedback. Don't do this. This is
[24:33] dangerous. Don't do that. That's risky.
[24:35] And it's for our protection and our
[24:36] preservation. In some ways, for our
[24:38] enjoyment.
[24:40] And emotions provide, this is the very
[24:42] critical to how the Lord's dealing me.
[24:44] Emotions provide motivation.
[24:46] And the very word emotion and its
[24:48] etmology and the way it was used
[24:50] originally and the how the word came
[24:51] together, it means a moving or a
[24:53] stirring or an agitation. So an emotion
[24:56] is a mover. An emotion is an agitation.
[24:58] It's a stirring. It's something that
[25:00] moves you. It comes in the Latin from
[25:01] stir up in the French to move out or to
[25:04] remove. And so you have these in these
[25:06] different conjugations and these
[25:07] different uh the origin of this word to
[25:09] stir up to move out to to agitate. These
[25:12] are this is what emotions are. So
[25:14] emotions serve as motivation.
[25:18] So then to be without emotions or to not
[25:20] have feeling is a dreadful state.
[25:23] If you don't have anything that can
[25:24] motivate you, you understand where I'M
[25:26] SAYING THAT? WELL, YEAH, I DON'T WANT TO
[25:27] FEEL PAIN. But if you lose the sense of
[25:29] feeling, then you lose ambition.
[25:31] You lose motivation. If you can't feel
[25:34] that something is burning you, then you
[25:36] lose actually the impetus and THE
[25:37] MOTIVATION. SAY, "GET UP. IT'S BURNING
[25:39] YOU."
[25:40] RIGHT? And that's what happens when you
[25:41] your emotions begin to get mudded and
[25:43] things get muddled up and things get
[25:45] calloused over and scarred. You lose
[25:47] feeling.
[25:50] I heard this from a number of people
[25:52] that when they had COVID 19
[25:56] that the worst thing was the loss of
[25:58] taste and loss of smell.
[26:00] And some people it seemed to me when
[26:02] they articulate that their greatest fear
[26:04] is that it wouldn't come back
[26:06] and because it was something that you
[26:08] always had and now you lose it and it
[26:10] changes things and it becomes very very
[26:11] difficult and it could become very
[26:13] fearful and just imagine if you are if
[26:16] you lost your sense of smell and you
[26:17] lost your sense of taste and you were a
[26:19] chef
[26:23] immediately say well this is my this is
[26:25] this is how I enjoy this. This is how I
[26:27] I I make this work. These are things
[26:29] that I would do. Uh um uh these are
[26:31] things I need. And I'm saying this so
[26:33] you can get a relate now to the how
[26:35] important our feelings are and our
[26:37] emotions are just as our natural senses
[26:39] are important.
[26:41] Maybe this will help. Brother Bam said
[26:43] anything without emotion is dead.
[26:47] Anything without emotion is dead. And so
[26:50] you if you have no emotions at all,
[26:53] you're dead.
[26:55] You have no feeling. It's a
[26:56] characterization of being dead. So,
[26:59] brother Bam, when he uses that in
[27:00] different places, so if it doesn't have
[27:02] emotions, just buried, it's dead. He
[27:03] says, "So, we got to have emotions.
[27:06] We've got to have feeling. There has to
[27:09] be there has to be some sense." And when
[27:11] I say feeling, I'm not just trying to
[27:12] talk about shouting and dancing and
[27:14] getting all excited. I'm talking about
[27:15] even faith, which is a sick sense.
[27:17] Something deep down inside that feels,
[27:19] that knows, that senses. Talking about a
[27:21] discernment. I'm talking about a
[27:22] perception. I'm talking about an
[27:23] awareness to where we don't say, "Well,
[27:25] I'm just numb to everything and nothing
[27:27] bothers me." That's not faith. That's
[27:28] becoming callous.
[27:30] That's retreating to darkness. That's I
[27:32] don't want to think about it. I don't
[27:33] want to consider it. I don't want TO
[27:34] KNOW ABOUT IT. DON'T TELL ME. AND A LOT
[27:36] OF TIMES BAD THINGS HAPPEN and everybody
[27:38] just shuts up.
[27:39] Nobody says anything. You know why? They
[27:41] don't want to talk about it and confirm
[27:42] their worst fears that that's exactly
[27:44] what happened.
[27:45] THINGS CAN COME AND GO WITHIN FAMILIES,
[27:47] WITHIN CHURCHES. Nobody talks about it
[27:49] at all. Why? They they don't want to
[27:51] they don't want to feel it. They don't
[27:52] want to consider what may have happened.
[27:53] They don't want to think about the
[27:55] reality. Well, I heard and if that's
[27:57] true, this isn't good.
[27:59] And so, they don't want to talk about
[28:00] it. So, then it just gets buried. And
[28:02] then when it happens again, they're
[28:03] like, is this a pattern? No. No. Uhuh.
[28:05] Because the other one really didn't even
[28:06] happen either. You become numb to it.
[28:08] You become numb to it. Become numb to
[28:09] it. We've got to have feeling.
[28:11] Again, I said last time, I hope that you
[28:13] just really stay focused to what I'm
[28:15] saying because uh
[28:18] that I'm not pushing you to emotion. I'm
[28:21] not pushing you to feelings. I'm trying
[28:24] to identify how some people become
[28:25] callous to him completely.
[28:29] This statement really really moved me as
[28:32] I was studying last week in the message
[28:34] conferences. God says, "But God made a
[28:36] decision." This is in the beginning when
[28:39] mankind fell. And the decision was
[28:41] something had to die because it spoke of
[28:44] him, his holiness and righteousness to
[28:46] his own law. The day you eat of that,
[28:48] you die. And there had to be a
[28:51] substitute with the feeling.
[28:54] Botney life has no feeling. So he had to
[28:57] kill something in order to get skins to
[28:59] cover them up.
[29:01] Why is it that a a fruit wouldn't work?
[29:04] Why is it that the the fig leaves that
[29:06] they sewed together didn't work? Why is
[29:08] it he had to take a lamb that was
[29:10] innocent in order to get usher them out
[29:13] of the garden? He had to take something
[29:16] with feeling.
[29:18] It wasn't enough that it would be
[29:19] inanimate. It wasn't enough just to set
[29:21] something in motion. He had to take
[29:23] something with feeling. What does this
[29:24] signified? It signified the sacrifice OF
[29:26] JESUS CHRIST WHO WOULD FEEL THE FULL
[29:29] WEIGHT OF REJECTION. FEEL the full
[29:31] weight of sins. HE KNEW WHAT IT FELT
[29:33] LIKE TO WHAT IT FELT LIKE TO BE A
[29:34] SINNER. HE BORE IT. HE BORE THE SORROW.
[29:36] HE BORE THE REJECTION. HE BORE THE
[29:38] LONELINESS. And as he's hanging there on
[29:39] the cross, HE SAY, "I KNOW WHAT IT'S
[29:41] LIKE TO FEEL LIKE A SINNER. I KNOW WHAT
[29:43] IT'S LIKE TO FEEL REJECTED. I KNOW WHAT
[29:44] IT'S LIKE TO FEEL LONELY." HE COULD
[29:46] SENSE AND FEEL ALL OF THAT. AND GOD'S
[29:48] SACRIFICE REQUIRED SOMEBODY WHO COULD
[29:50] FEEL.
[29:52] Think about that.
[29:54] There had to be a substitute with
[29:55] feeling. Botney life has no feeling. So
[29:58] he had to kill something. SOMEBODY HAD
[30:00] TO FEEL it in order for there TO BE
[30:02] ATONEMENT. SOMEBODY HAD TO FEEL IT in
[30:04] order for there to be redemption.
[30:06] You say, "Oh, well feelings DON'T
[30:08] MATTER." WELL, THEY did in this sense.
[30:12] You don't go by, well, I don't feel good
[30:13] today, so things aren't good. That Yeah,
[30:15] that has the application. And that's
[30:16] true. We don't go by feelings, but that
[30:18] doesn't mean we become emotionless and
[30:20] we have no feeling.
[30:21] Right?
[30:22] There's a way that we just need to be
[30:23] balanced in that. And that's really not
[30:25] what I'm trying to do. But I just sense
[30:27] as I'm preaching this, sometimes you can
[30:29] get so tunnled in on one specific
[30:31] thought that you don't realize some
[30:33] people are looking at a piece of a
[30:35] puzzle in the broader picture. And I
[30:37] just feel to frame it a little bit. say,
[30:38] "I'm not I'm not disregarding all the
[30:40] things that we've been taught about
[30:42] feelings and emotions and those things,
[30:44] but bring in a balance
[30:47] because we can take this side to where
[30:49] feelings don't matter, emotions don't
[30:51] matter, your spiritual your emotional
[30:53] well-being, your spirit doesn't matter
[30:55] when it absolutely does."
[30:58] Let me just say this and and this is
[31:00] kind of some things that I'm
[31:01] forwardlooking in this subject matter
[31:03] that brother Brandham uses an example
[31:04] and I'll use this maybe here very soon.
[31:06] He's talking about a young girl who went
[31:08] to college and he said the professor
[31:09] swung her mind away from the truth and
[31:11] she took on an evil spirit. And brother
[31:13] Bam said the preaching of the gospel is
[31:15] to swing your mind back.
[31:18] Now think about it. We could get so word
[31:20] only, it's like, well, forget about your
[31:22] mind. I'm speaking to your soul. But
[31:24] we're taught in the word of God that in
[31:26] order for the word to get to the soul,
[31:28] the mind has to be swung back to an open
[31:30] channel to receive it. And so the word
[31:32] of God isn't JUST TAKE HIM AS WORD, TAKE
[31:34] HIM AS HIS WORD, TAKE HIM as word. But
[31:35] the word of God has to come in a special
[31:37] way to take that person's brokenness and
[31:39] their emotions and their mind and line
[31:41] it up to where they come to this spot to
[31:42] where once THAT CHANNEL OPENS UP, THEN
[31:44] THE WORD only comes into the soul.
[31:47] And so the the word of God in the Bible
[31:49] does not just disregard all of our
[31:51] feelings and emotions and our past and
[31:52] all of our experiences. It wants to meet
[31:54] those needs so that we can go forward.
[31:58] not get out our lawn chairs and sit back
[32:00] and just look back and say, "Man, this
[32:01] life's been hard and I've been through
[32:02] this and I've been through that." And
[32:03] like a bunch of war veterans comparing
[32:05] scars and talking about how wounded we
[32:07] are and how broken we are. No, we want
[32:08] it to heal so we can go forward.
[32:11] We're pursuing purpose. We're running to
[32:13] a destiny.
[32:15] So, when we use the subject of numb,
[32:20] I'm addressing our own emotional
[32:22] numbness.
[32:25] I believe the word of God wants to
[32:26] expose any spiritual numbness.
[32:30] Emotional numbness is caused by a
[32:32] physical pain or even emotional pain,
[32:34] verbal abuse or even physical abuse or
[32:36] difficult things or trauma that takes
[32:37] place. And whenever we experience
[32:41] physical trauma or emotional trauma or
[32:43] difficult situations or we have the
[32:45] sense of being overwhelmed constantly
[32:47] whether it be in our finances, on the
[32:49] job or stressful situations, it can lead
[32:51] us to becoming emotionally numb. But
[32:53] then that can lead to unintentionally
[32:54] becoming spiritually numb
[32:57] because you're trying to shut off all
[32:58] these painful emotions in your natural
[32:59] life and it makes you unable to
[33:02] experience the move of God in your
[33:03] spiritual life. Become sensitive to how
[33:05] God's leading you sensitive to God's
[33:07] love FOR YOU. WHY? YOU TRIED TO PROTECT
[33:09] YOURSELF by yourself instead of putting
[33:11] him between you and the problem. You
[33:13] shut down over here and you become hard
[33:14] over here. But then it carries over into
[33:16] your spiritual relationship with the
[33:17] Lord.
[33:20] So becoming emotionally numb
[33:23] can hinder God dealing with our hearts
[33:25] because as I mentioned a moment ago, God
[33:27] deals with our feelings.
[33:30] Often we ignore or we begin to repress
[33:33] or or dismiss feelings which are the
[33:36] Lord moving within our emotional life.
[33:40] No h there's a godly sorrow that comes.
[33:43] There's something begins to work in our
[33:45] hearts. You shouldn't have said that.
[33:46] You shouldn't have done that. These are
[33:47] emotions. God or there's something you
[33:49] could change. There's something you can
[33:50] do. It begins to work in your heart and
[33:52] ah dismiss it. No, that's just the
[33:53] devil. I I remember a situation one time
[33:56] where a a a brother was sharing
[33:58] something that had been said about him.
[34:00] He's actually reading a letter and he
[34:02] was kind of sharing it and he's reading
[34:03] through it and as he's reading it, it
[34:05] became very revealing like, wow, it was
[34:07] from a worldly person like wow they've
[34:10] really been hurt. They've really been
[34:12] offended by something that was done that
[34:13] was really wrong and insensitive. And
[34:15] when they got done reading it, that's
[34:17] just the devil.
[34:19] It was like,
[34:21] uh, which part? What you did? Because if
[34:24] that's what you're saying, then I agree
[34:26] with you. But it was a complete
[34:27] inability to say this person's hurt.
[34:30] This person's offended. I need to make
[34:33] this right. It was just dismiss it as
[34:35] the devil. Just dismiss it as, well,
[34:38] that was disconcerting. Or, I I, you
[34:40] know, that that that's not right. This
[34:41] isn't. And you just dismiss it. And no,
[34:43] no, just be quiet. I don't want to hear
[34:44] it. don't want to hear it. And God may
[34:46] be trying to warn us. God may be trying
[34:49] to get our attention. He may be trying
[34:51] to change us, but we just kind of say,
[34:53] "Nah, I'm just going to dismiss it." So,
[34:55] we need to be honest about red flags.
[34:57] We need to be honest about things that
[34:59] are signaling, things that are taking
[35:00] place. Lord, what's happening? What's
[35:02] taking place? So, put it before the
[35:03] Lord. Ponder it. Lord, is this you
[35:05] that's DEALING WITH MY HEART? PUT IT
[35:06] BEFORE THE LORD AND THE LORD can say,
[35:07] "No, that's nothing but the devil." Then
[35:08] you want to stand with it. But if you
[35:10] REALIZE GOD IS ALLOWING THESE THINGS,
[35:11] GOD IS WORKING IN MY HEART. God is doing
[35:13] things to get my attention. This is
[35:14] God's way of warning me. Then we want to
[35:16] we WANT TO ACCEPT GOD'S DEALING WITH OUR
[35:19] HEARTS.
[35:20] Reminds you of the story where brother
[35:21] Bam talked about the prospector. I think
[35:23] it might have been here in Arizona where
[35:24] he said his dog was barking every night
[35:26] and that dog was there to protect him.
[35:28] AND THIS DOG KEPT BARKING. WHY? Because
[35:30] this outlaw had crept up near the camp
[35:32] and knew this prospector was sitting on
[35:35] some gold and the dog was there to warn
[35:37] him and he got tired of the barking dog
[35:39] so HE JUST SHOT IT AND KILLED IT. Then
[35:41] the prospector was murdered and all his
[35:42] gold was taken. And what was the lesson?
[35:44] Don't steal the voice that's trying to
[35:46] warn you.
[35:48] Don't quiet the sense in your heart that
[35:50] says something's not right. Something's
[35:51] wrong. Something's a miss. Don't just
[35:53] keep deadening that and deadening that
[35:55] and say, "No, everything's fine.
[35:56] Everything's we'll just get through.
[35:57] It's just a phase or whatever." And just
[35:58] pushing it down, pushing it down. Ponder
[36:00] it.
[36:01] If it be from God,
[36:06] we can't run away every time we get
[36:07] uncomfortable.
[36:10] We can't shut down every time we begin
[36:11] to experience pain. We need to ask
[36:14] ourselves, what is it I need to
[36:15] overcome? Here it comes again. What is
[36:18] it I need to overcome? I can't just
[36:21] always run away. I can't just always
[36:23] ignore it. I can't always deny it. What
[36:25] is it that I need to overcome?
[36:31] As I said last time, the danger of
[36:32] numbness is not only do you develop an
[36:34] inability to experience
[36:38] pain because you don't want to feel it,
[36:40] you develop an inability to experience
[36:42] pleasure.
[36:44] You develop an inability to experience
[36:46] happiness or as we're trying to identify
[36:47] pure joy.
[36:50] And I wanted to maybe develop this I I I
[36:53] think in my mind the whole service I
[36:55] wanted it just to be this thought and I
[36:56] realized you know what it's just it's
[36:58] just one statement that needs to be made
[37:01] and and I and I may have to back it up
[37:02] with some uh some examples
[37:06] but in order to experience joy and I'd
[37:09] even say experience happiness or pure
[37:10] joy and I'd say even in one of any of
[37:12] these positive emotions you have to put
[37:14] yourself in a position to potentially
[37:16] experience a letdown.
[37:20] In order to experience joy, you're going
[37:22] to have to put yourself in a position to
[37:24] experience sadness.
[37:26] In order to experience pleasure, you
[37:28] might have to put yourself in a position
[37:29] to experience pain. If you want to
[37:31] experience acceptance,
[37:33] you're probably going to have to put
[37:34] yourself in a position of experiencing
[37:36] rejection.
[37:39] So, this is uncomfortable. This is why
[37:40] we don't engage. This is why this is
[37:42] what makes a good salesman is they're
[37:44] willing to face rejection.
[37:47] and and they and they've kind of owned
[37:48] that and they've accepted it. They lean
[37:49] into it. What's the worst thing THAT CAN
[37:51] HAPPEN? SAY NO. That's it. That's the
[37:52] worst thing that can happen is they
[37:54] could say no. And and they're like, "If
[37:55] that's the worst thing that can happen,
[37:57] THEN JUST DO IT. JUST GO OUT THERE AND
[37:58] SELL." AND I'M THE PERSONALITY and they
[37:59] say, "What's the worst thing that can
[38:00] happen?" The worst thing is they could
[38:02] say no. And they're like, "EXACTLY."
[38:03] LIKE, "I KNOW. I KNOW. That's awful.
[38:08] I'm just going to go jump off a cliff."
[38:11] But you're afraid of heights. I know.
[38:12] I'm stuck. I don't know what to do.
[38:16] you just become numb.
[38:18] I I feel like I could never be a
[38:20] salesman. I have a hard time, you know,
[38:22] sending the steak back to the kitchen
[38:24] like, "Yeah, I know I'm paying $50 for
[38:25] this, but it's fine. Just bring me some
[38:27] ketchup."
[38:28] What kind of boot is this anyways?
[38:31] Because you're afraid of you, you know,
[38:33] you you just don't want to. You're not a
[38:34] salesman. You don't have it in you to do
[38:35] it. But if you're going to be successful
[38:38] in sales, you have to put yourself in a
[38:40] position to be unsuccessful.
[38:43] I know the saying is I guess it's Wayne
[38:44] Gretzky, brother Wayne Gretzky who said
[38:46] you miss 100% of all the shots you don't
[38:48] take.
[38:50] And really if you wanted to take issue
[38:51] with them, you say, 'Well, brother
[38:52] Wayne, I don't think you're right right
[38:54] exactly because I don't miss any shots I
[38:56] don't take. And that's the whole point.
[38:58] If I don't take my shot, I don't miss.
[39:00] And therefore, really, I'm not on the
[39:01] board at all. And you can't say I'm a
[39:02] loser because I didn't take a shot.
[39:06] But really, the point that's being made
[39:07] is you'll never make a shot if you don't
[39:09] shoot.
[39:10] That's the point that's being made. If
[39:13] you don't want to miss a shot, don't
[39:14] take a shot. BUT IF YOU WANT TO MAKE A
[39:16] SHOT, you're going to have to take one.
[39:18] You're going to have to take the risk of
[39:19] being blocked. You have to take a risk
[39:21] of missing the net. You have to take the
[39:22] risk because you're going to miss 100%
[39:24] OF THE SHOTS YOU don't take. And if your
[39:26] goal is to make one and not worry about
[39:28] missing one, then you're going to have
[39:30] to take them. And listen, DON'T SPEND
[39:31] YOUR ENTIRE CHRISTIAN LIFE WORRIED about
[39:33] the misses and worried about failures
[39:35] and worried about not getting this and
[39:37] missing that and missing that. Instead,
[39:39] TAKE THIS ATTITUDE THAT GOD HAS
[39:40] SOMETHING FOR ME AND I DON'T WANT TO
[39:42] MISS THAT. SO, I'M WILLING TO PUT MYSELF
[39:44] IN A POSITION OF RECEIVING IT AND
[39:46] WAITING FOR it and believing it and
[39:48] praying for it is to say, "Well, I don't
[39:49] want to experience rejection, so I'll
[39:51] just retreat, not ask for anything."
[39:53] Don't get to a place WHERE YOU FEEL SO
[39:55] rejected and so beat up and so
[39:57] DESPONDENT AND SO SAD TO WHERE I'M JUST
[40:00] NOT GOING TO ASK ANYMORE. I'M NOT GOING
[40:01] TO HOPE ANYMORE. I'M NOT GOING to
[40:02] believe anymore. If any of you have ever
[40:05] felt that way, this is what God is
[40:06] bringing me to as a minister to speak to
[40:08] you. SAY, "LISTEN, GET OUT OF THAT
[40:10] MINDSET. DON'T BECOME NUMB. Believe in
[40:12] God. EXPECT GREAT THINGS. PRAY AND ASK
[40:15] BIG."
[40:18] If you're always running away or
[40:19] retreating from potential pain, you'll
[40:21] never advance to pure joy.
[40:25] In Luke chapter 19, Jesus tells the
[40:27] story about the the man who gave the
[40:29] talents to the different servants.
[40:33] And he the the scriptures explains how
[40:35] he gave one this much and he was able to
[40:37] double it. This one this much and they
[40:38] all kind of amplified what they were
[40:40] given. But he comes to the one and he
[40:43] says uh Lord here's thy pound which I
[40:46] have kept laid up in a napkin.
[40:49] And then he gives his reason for I
[40:50] feared thee. So it was fear that
[40:53] motivated his lack of investment.
[40:56] We should never be motivated by fear. We
[40:58] should be motivated by faith. So it's
[41:01] this fear and it's not even a respect
[41:02] necessarily. He says because thou art an
[41:04] austere man, a harsh man. Thou takest up
[41:08] that thou laidest not down and reapest
[41:10] that that thou didest not sow.
[41:13] And and his master's like, you fool, you
[41:14] should have at least given it to the
[41:16] money changers if you know I was harsh.
[41:18] You should have at least given it to
[41:19] somebody who give me interest on it when
[41:21] you're done. But instead of doing what
[41:23] would have been maybe the least prudent
[41:25] thing or the safest thing to do or the
[41:27] the the had the less risk, YOU DIDN'T DO
[41:29] ANYTHING AT ALL because you were afraid.
[41:33] And so here's a man who was paralyzed by
[41:35] fear.
[41:37] He knew that HE WAS A HARSH MAN. AND HE
[41:38] EVEN GIVES EXAMPLES of what he had DONE
[41:40] IN THE PAST. SO NOW IT'S even a complex
[41:42] that maybe this YOUNG MAN HAD BUILT UP
[41:44] TO WHERE HE'S AFRAID TO INVEST. HE'S
[41:46] AFRAID TO do something because what
[41:47] might HAPPEN AND THE REJECTION and the
[41:50] pain and the THINGS THAT COULD BE SAID
[41:51] AND all the OTHER THINGS THAT MIGHT
[41:53] HAPPEN and he he was at a place where it
[41:55] mattered too much to him the negative
[41:57] things that might happen if it doesn't
[41:58] turn well. And so he didn't even do
[42:00] anything. Not even the least thing he
[42:01] should have done
[42:02] with those feelings. Yeah. Well, maybe
[42:04] you shouldn't try to gamble it and and
[42:06] and put a large bet on Bitcoin or do
[42:08] this with that and use the money that
[42:10] way. Maybe you should just be really
[42:11] safe. Put it in a CD. When's he going to
[42:13] be back? Six months. put it in a
[42:15] six-month CD which earns 0.00000000001%
[42:19] and at least that way he'll get 0.1%
[42:22] on his investment instead of just laying
[42:24] it under a napkin and getting nothing.
[42:31] The fear did not prompt him to proper
[42:34] action
[42:38] but he locked up. He froze.
[42:42] He was given a talent. What are you
[42:43] going to do with it?
[42:46] I'll just hide it. Well, why don't you
[42:48] why don't you invest it? Well, what if
[42:50] something bad happens? Okay. All right.
[42:52] Well, then don't invest it. How about
[42:54] you just put it in a savings account?
[42:56] No. Um, I'm just going to leave it here.
[42:59] Got paralyzed.
[43:02] Hope you can relate somehow.
[43:05] Very characterist characterization of
[43:07] Leodysia is that they're not hot or
[43:09] cold, but lukewarm.
[43:12] That's numb
[43:14] because they're numb to their spiritual
[43:15] condition. They become numb to their
[43:18] depravity. They become numb to their
[43:19] nakedness. They become numb to their
[43:20] need and they ah we don't need anything.
[43:22] And the Bible says that they are
[43:23] lukewarm.
[43:26] This is spiritual apathy.
[43:28] They're apathetic. THEY DON'T CARE. IT
[43:30] DOESN'T MATTER. ME. Their favorite
[43:32] philosopher is uh mediocrates,
[43:35] right? Ah, good enough. It just doesn't
[43:38] MATTER ANYMORE. THEY'RE NOT MOVED. THIS
[43:41] IS WHAT THIS WORD MEANS. It means of
[43:42] being tepid or cold. They had come to a
[43:46] place being lukewarm. They're not
[43:47] concerned. They're not moved. They're
[43:49] cold. Brother Brandham identifies them
[43:50] over and over again as being cold. They
[43:52] have become hard. Their hearts have
[43:53] become hardened. They are, this is a
[43:55] phrase brother uses a lot, indifferent.
[43:59] Doesn't matter. What about this? Doesn't
[44:01] matter. What about that? Nah, doesn't
[44:03] matter. And it's not faith.
[44:08] I I I I read some relationship advice
[44:10] one time. It says, "If you ever want to
[44:13] know where your wife wants to go eat,
[44:16] ask her to guess where you're taking
[44:17] her.
[44:21] The offering box is in the back.
[44:23] [laughter]
[44:24] That That's going to pay off." Honey,
[44:27] guess where I'm taking you? Flemy's.
[44:31] Exactly.
[44:32] Siri, make a reservation at Flemy's.
[44:37] Where was I going with that? Oh,
[44:39] indifferent. But the worst part is like,
[44:41] it doesn't matter. Okay, Flemings. H I
[44:43] don't want steak. Ah, it doesn't matter.
[44:45] It doesn't matter. And really, it does.
[44:46] But you just become indifferent. I don't
[44:48] care. I can put up with anything. I can
[44:51] handle it.
[44:52] It's a bad place to be.
[44:55] When it says they were lukewarm, it was
[44:57] a heart that was not passionate about
[45:00] anything
[45:03] and a heart that's not soft,
[45:06] a heart a heart that's not sensitive.
[45:09] Listen, I'm not talking about being weak
[45:10] Christians. I'm talking about a heart
[45:12] that's pliable, a heart that's
[45:14] teachable. And when we as believers
[45:16] experience so much, we get to a place
[45:18] where our hearts are hardened, then it
[45:20] can no longer properly be impacted by
[45:22] the word. We could, listen, this is
[45:24] going to be very sobering. We could just
[45:26] be saying amen from here.
[45:30] Our discipline to church, our belief in
[45:32] the message and everything. We're just
[45:33] going through the emotions, it's really
[45:34] all just kind of on on automate now
[45:37] because we stopped feeling a long time
[45:39] ago because this happened and that
[45:40] happened and this happened and that
[45:42] happened and we just want to become numb
[45:43] to everything and numb to everything.
[45:45] That's what results in the blowup
[45:47] BECAUSE NOBODY SLOWS DOWN ENOUGH TO SAY,
[45:49] "WELL, what just happened and what about
[45:50] this and what about that?" and allow God
[45:52] to come on the scene and put things in
[45:54] perspective and bring healing and
[45:55] everyone just kind of no no no no I'm
[45:56] just not gonna think about it I'm not
[45:57] gonna think about it and then one day IT
[45:58] JUST BLOWS UP on somebody
[46:02] if our heart is not soft and sensitive
[46:04] becomes callous the word can't even
[46:06] impact it anymore
[46:08] I know this is pretty sobering stuff and
[46:10] I said last time that it may only be
[46:11] applicable to very few
[46:14] but it's important to ponder these
[46:16] things in the parable of the swer and
[46:19] the word was cast out and there's some
[46:20] that were on the wayside and some that
[46:21] fell on stony ground and then others
[46:23] that were in the midst of thorns and
[46:24] then some that fell on good ground.
[46:26] Jesus in Luke 8:13 interprets those that
[46:29] fell upon the rock. They on the rock are
[46:32] they which when they hear receive the
[46:34] word with joy. So initially when they
[46:36] receive it there's joy and these have no
[46:39] root which for a while believe. So they
[46:42] receive it with joy and they they they
[46:45] they believe for a while but because of
[46:47] the hardness of their heart the word
[46:50] cannot take root
[46:53] and not taking root it says and and in a
[46:55] time of temptation fall away. Now I know
[46:58] it's very easy for us to say oh yeah
[47:00] time of temptation they lusted they
[47:02] committed adultery they committed
[47:03] fornication oh they stole they robbed
[47:05] they committed murder. TEMPTATION JUST
[47:06] MEANS A TRIAL.
[47:08] It means approving
[47:11] in a testing of their faith, IN A TRYING
[47:12] OF THEIR FAITHFULNESS BECAUSE THEY
[47:14] DIDN'T HAVE a heart that the word COULD
[47:16] PENETRATE. THIS HARD HEART RESULTS IN
[47:19] FAILURE. AND IT'S not because they
[47:20] didn't believe at one time. It's not
[47:22] because THEY DIDN'T HAVE JOY AT ONE TIME
[47:25] IN THE WORD OF GOD. IT'S JUST SOMETHING
[47:27] IN THEIR HEART HAD NEVER BEEN RESOLVED.
[47:29] They had never let the ground get broken
[47:31] up. They'd never properly been watered.
[47:33] THEY BECOME CALLOUS. THEY BECOME HARD.
[47:35] THEY BECOME INDIFFERENT. AND THEY CAN
[47:36] SAY, "YES, AMEN. I believe. But then
[47:38] DIFFICULTIES COME AND THEY FIND THAT
[47:40] their faith is being tested. And it's
[47:42] THE GRACE OF GOD THAT he lets THEM FALL
[47:44] AWAY BECAUSE then they could realize my
[47:45] heart was too hard. It needs to be
[47:46] healed.
[47:48] If I'm ever going to serve God, I'm
[47:50] going to have to have this heart broken
[47:51] up and this ground is going to have to
[47:53] become soft again.
[47:56] In 1 Timothy chapter 4:es 1-2, it says,
[47:59] "The spirit speaketh expressly in the
[48:00] latter times that some are going to
[48:03] depart from the faith. Men will depart
[48:04] from the faith." And I'm going to skip
[48:06] to verse two. Having their conscience
[48:08] seared with the hot iron. They depart
[48:11] from the faith, they manifest these
[48:12] different wicked things of wickedness.
[48:14] And it's their conscience that is seared
[48:16] with the hot iron. Cauterized flesh. If
[48:19] you take a an ir a hot iron and you burn
[48:21] the flesh, it becomes hard. It becomes
[48:23] dead to sense.
[48:26] There's a lot a lot of rich uh history
[48:28] behind this thought of uh slaves being
[48:31] uh branded or criminals being branded
[48:33] and this brand this cauterized flesh
[48:35] serves as a reminder uh that they were
[48:37] sinners. But here he's talking about a
[48:39] seared conscience.
[48:41] A conscience that is seared is past
[48:43] feeling.
[48:45] A conscience that is seared is unable is
[48:47] hardened and can't feel anymore.
[48:50] Now, I'm not WANTING TO APPROACH THIS IN
[48:52] THE SENSE THAT I FEEL LIKE I'VE stumbled
[48:53] upon a group of a bunch of makebelievers
[48:55] or unbelievers who are just living
[48:57] ungodly and doing this and doing that
[48:59] and trying to justify AND YOU GUYS ARE
[49:01] ALL A BUNCH OF FORNICATORS AND DRUG
[49:02] users and a and ponzi scheme promoters
[49:05] and just really ripping you up and
[49:07] trying to get you TO FEEL AGAIN. NO, I'M
[49:09] not wanting to look at in the sense of
[49:10] this gross, terrible, negligent,
[49:13] perverse sin that might have even be
[49:14] referenced here in the scripture, BUT
[49:16] PONDER THE ASPECT how that our
[49:18] consciences can become hard
[49:22] and how that it's through that that we
[49:23] can begin to depart from the faith or
[49:25] lead the feeling and conviction that
[49:26] faith wants to give us. AND WE CANNOT
[49:29] LET THE HARDNESS OF LIFE harden our
[49:31] hearts. We cannot do it.
[49:34] Jesus said in Matthew chapter 13:15,
[49:36] "For this people's heart is waxed gross,
[49:41] waxed gross." It's said this way in
[49:43] Psalms 119:70, "Their heart is as fat as
[49:45] grease." Remember that one. You ever
[49:48] want to burn somebody?
[49:50] Their heart is as fat as grease. It it
[49:53] it's the waxed gross. It means
[49:55] insensitive, numb. When your heart is
[49:58] fat as grease, it doesn't mean you've
[49:59] been eating in and out every day or, you
[50:02] know, going to the fair and eating
[50:03] everything that's deep fried. Your heart
[50:05] is fat as grease becomes insensitive,
[50:07] becomes numb. It's thick. It's hard.
[50:10] It's callous. Their heart is waxed,
[50:11] gross. And notice what happens when you
[50:13] become your heart becomes w dull. Your
[50:15] ears are dull of hearing. And this is
[50:18] the part that you have to recognize
[50:19] here. Ears can be dull of hearing
[50:21] through the hardness of your heart.
[50:23] their eyes they have closed.
[50:27] So now there's even an affirmative act
[50:28] on this person's part through the
[50:30] hardening of their heart. Their heart
[50:31] becoming fat as grease, their hearts
[50:33] grassing a waxing gross because of
[50:34] iniquity. They they become dull of
[50:36] hearing and then they purposely close
[50:38] their eyes lest at any time they should
[50:41] see with their eyes and hear with their
[50:42] ears and should understand with their
[50:44] heart. Notice and should be converted
[50:46] and I should heal them.
[50:49] If there's no feeling, there's no
[50:50] healing. If you don't feel the pains and
[50:54] regret of sin, you can never experience
[50:56] salvation and a conversion by virtue of
[50:58] your repenting.
[51:00] You have to feel it. YOU HAVE TO FEEL
[51:01] THE WEIGHT OF IT. YOU HAVE TO RECOGNIZE
[51:02] THE HORROR. I'M A SINFUL CREATURE.
[51:04] CHRIST DIED FOR MY SINS. THERE HAS to be
[51:06] feeling in order to be converted. THERE
[51:08] HAS TO BE FEELING IN ORDER FOR THERE TO
[51:09] BE HEALING.
[51:11] And if we let the circumstances of life
[51:13] begin to produce a heart that is fat as
[51:15] grease or a heart that's wax gross and
[51:17] we become numb to certain things because
[51:19] I don't want to hear it, I don't want to
[51:20] hear. If you just mention it, it's a
[51:21] trigger. my heart starts racing and then
[51:23] we begin to just CLOSE OUR EYES BECAUSE
[51:24] WE DON'T WANT TO EXPERIENCE IT. THEN WE
[51:26] BECOME NUMB. AND JESUS IS SAYING IF YOU
[51:28] DO THAT, I can't heal you.
[51:32] We must not become numb.
[51:36] We must not become numb to our own need
[51:38] of healing.
[51:41] And I say this, the needs of others.
[51:45] because you get so locked up and caught
[51:46] up in self-preservation,
[51:49] you're never going to be able to help
[51:50] somebody else. There's several different
[51:53] concepts I wanted to amplify, but I'll
[51:54] just mention them because I know that
[51:55] you know these things in the message.
[51:57] Brother Bam defined spiritual amnesia
[52:00] this way. People get to a spot to where
[52:02] they have no feeling on the inside of
[52:04] them.
[52:05] That's what spiritual amnesia is. We
[52:07] think, "Oh, it's just when I forget."
[52:09] No, it's when you want to forget and so
[52:12] you become numb. people get to a spot
[52:14] where they have no feeling on the inside
[52:16] of them. I had at least two people
[52:18] mention to me after last Sunday that it
[52:21] reminded them of leprosy
[52:23] and how that the one of the conditions
[52:25] of leprosy is you lose feeling or
[52:26] sensation and this is in the flesh. The
[52:29] the the neurological impact of these
[52:31] things is uh even one brother shared a
[52:33] story with me how a doctor who treated
[52:34] leprosy and lepers in India uh uh one
[52:38] day went home and he took off his shoes
[52:39] and noticed that he had been bleeding.
[52:40] He was like what's going on? I didn't
[52:42] even notice that. So he took a needle
[52:44] and jabbed himself and sure enough he
[52:45] couldn't feel it and he had leprosy. You
[52:48] lose feeling in your limbs. You lose
[52:49] feeling. You can't sense feeling
[52:50] anymore. And so if there's spiritual
[52:52] leprosy, which brother Bam talks about
[52:53] it, it's a loss of feeling.
[52:57] It's a loss of sensation,
[52:59] spiritual apathy, as we mentioned a
[53:01] moment. It's a lack of interest, no more
[53:03] enthusiasm, no more concern.
[53:07] And again, I'm not berating you. I'm not
[53:09] I'm not judging you. And I'm not being
[53:10] harsh about, oh, how could you become
[53:12] spiritually apathetic? I'm wanting to
[53:14] acknowledge we go through things that
[53:15] are so hard and difficult that the only
[53:18] way we know to deal with IT IS JUST TO
[53:19] SHUT DOWN. And in shutting down, WE
[53:22] BECOME APATHETIC. NOT BECAUSE WE DON'T
[53:24] LOVE GOD, not because we don't love
[53:25] truth, not because we don't love our
[53:26] spouse, NOT BECAUSE WE don't love the
[53:28] message, not because WE DON'T LOVE
[53:29] CHURCH, BUT WHAT WE'VE GONE THROUGH HAS
[53:31] MADE us apathetic. What we've gone
[53:32] through has given US SPIRITUAL LEPROSY.
[53:34] WHAT WE'VE GONE THROUGH HAS CAUSED us to
[53:35] experience spiritual amnesia BECAUSE WE
[53:37] DON'T WANT TO FEEL THE DREAD, THE
[53:38] HORROR, the anxiety, and the pains that
[53:41] have come through the things that we've
[53:42] been through.
[53:44] And yeah, maybe you're protected from
[53:46] all the words and all the deeds and all
[53:48] the sayings and all the sermons and ALL
[53:49] THE EXPERIENCES THAT CAUSED YOU THE THE
[53:51] racing heart and ALL THE THE KNOTS IN
[53:53] YOUR STOMACH AND all the difficulties
[53:54] YOU WENT THROUGH BEFORE, BUT NOW YOU
[53:56] CAN'T EVEN BE impacted by the spirit of
[53:58] God.
[54:01] And you feel like you're just living in
[54:02] a wasteland.
[54:06] A wasteland, something that's
[54:08] spiritually, emotionally dry.
[54:13] You all know what dry is.
[54:16] But not just dry, but unsatisfying.
[54:23] Can you identify with any of these?
[54:28] Feel like I'm in a wasteland.
[54:30] Nothing satisfies. I don't have any joy.
[54:32] Everything seems dry and lukewarm and
[54:36] unsatisfying.
[54:42] There's a solution for that.
[54:46] Ask I want to kind of I want to turn the
[54:47] corner to to
[54:53] help you as we go through this subject.
[54:57] Let me just ask, has spiritual stress or
[55:00] personal trauma resulted in you becoming
[55:03] numb to the movement of God?
[55:05] Consider it for a moment. Again, I'm not
[55:08] talking to everybody and I'm not making
[55:09] all of you, you know, go back in your
[55:11] childhood. Don't you remember when your
[55:13] dad hit you? You all remember, right?
[55:15] Kind of like the classic question you
[55:16] can ask somebody where they just can't
[55:18] eat answer it right. Have you stopped
[55:20] beating your wife yet?
[55:22] If you say no, then yes or no. You say
[55:26] yes and either way, you're you're stuck.
[55:28] I don't know if it's a lawyer's trick or
[55:30] just a good joke or what it is, but it's
[55:31] just one of those things that
[55:34] can't answer, right? I'm not trying to
[55:35] trick anybody. I I I want to talk to one
[55:38] person. Could we all agree that if it's
[55:40] just for one person, it's worth it?
[55:42] a daughter of God or a son of God who's
[55:44] been trapped in a wasteland crying out
[55:48] for rain and crying out for something
[55:49] that satisfies, wanting to eat something
[55:51] that tastes good and wanting to feel the
[55:52] move of God again and thinks back the
[55:54] way that it used to be and now the
[55:55] devil's trying to tell him, "See,
[55:57] there's nothing to this and because it's
[55:58] not the way it used to be. Maybe you're
[56:00] not bright or maybe all these people are
[56:01] deceived and all these different
[56:03] bombardments that are taking place."
[56:04] Wouldn't you want God to open things up
[56:06] and turn their wasteland into a
[56:08] beautiful flowering verdant uh place?
[56:15] has the have these things spiritual
[56:17] stress or something you've gone through
[56:19] personally caused you to be numb to the
[56:21] movement of his spirit.
[56:23] Have we gotten to a place even as
[56:25] individuals where we're numb to sin?
[56:28] We're numb to error
[56:30] that that mistruths or lies are fudging
[56:33] a little bit. Things take place, things
[56:34] happen. Oh, well that's just a little
[56:35] white lie or it doesn't really matter.
[56:36] It doesn't mean, you know, and just we
[56:38] come up with excuses and reasons to
[56:40] justify things. Have we become numb
[56:43] TO HOW PRECIOUS THE WORD OF GOD IS?
[56:46] Have we become numb to sin?
[56:49] And doing so, have we in this numbness,
[56:51] this is maybe where I would say it
[56:53] relates to all of us. Have we become
[56:54] numb to the needs of others?
[56:59] In Matthew 25:es 42 to 43, I want to
[57:03] read these verses and let me recall very
[57:05] quickly. There's a group of people who
[57:06] will enter in to life on the day of
[57:09] judgment that white throne judgment and
[57:11] they'll enter in as a result of their
[57:13] works and it'll be said of them and we
[57:15] all know it when I was thirsty you gave
[57:16] me a drink right when I was naked you
[57:19] clothed me when I was in prison you
[57:20] visited me and and they're like well
[57:22] when did I do that and he says well in
[57:24] so much as you've done unto the least of
[57:25] these my brethren you've done unto me
[57:27] we're all familiar with that well we're
[57:29] familiar that the opposite's true too in
[57:31] verses 42 and 43 for I was hungered and
[57:34] you gave me no meat
[57:36] I was thirsty and you gave me no drink.
[57:38] I was a stranger and you took me not in.
[57:40] Naked and you clothed me not. Sick and
[57:42] in prison and you visited me not.
[57:46] So it's not just that there is something
[57:48] to be given to those WHO ACTUALLY DID.
[57:50] BUT it's a detriment to those who don't.
[57:53] And to some they saw a need and they
[57:55] felt that this needed to be met. They
[57:57] were moved in compassion by what
[57:59] somebody ELSE WAS EXPERIENCING. BUT NOW
[58:01] THEY'RE DESCRIBING TO PEOPLE THAT WHEN
[58:02] BROTHER BAM looks at this, he says, "No
[58:03] feeling."
[58:06] People with no feeling THAT YOU CAN SEE
[58:07] SOMEONE'S HUNGRY AND YOU DON'T WANT TO
[58:09] FEED THEM. YOU CAN SEE THAT THEY'RE
[58:10] THIRSTY, YOU DON'T WANT TO GIVE THEM A
[58:11] DRINK. You can see that they're a
[58:12] stranger, they're a visitor, or they
[58:14] don't know what they're doing, AND YOU
[58:15] DON'T MAKE THEM FEEL WELCOME OR
[58:16] COMFORTABLE. THEY'RE NAKED, AND YOU
[58:17] DON'T WANT TO CLOTHE THEM. They're sick,
[58:19] and you don't pray for them. THEY'RE IN
[58:20] PRISON, AND YOU DON'T VISIT THEM.
[58:23] I was reading in the as a family, we're
[58:25] reading the story of David AND WHEN SAUL
[58:27] WAS OUT TO UH UH KILL HIM AND TRYING TO
[58:29] KILL HIM AND DAVID time and time again
[58:31] was demonstrating, I'M NOT A THREAT TO
[58:33] YOU, SAUL. I'M NOT A THREAT TO YOU,
[58:34] SAUL. AND FINALLY, DAVID FINDS OUT THAT
[58:36] THIS KING WHO' pursued him, this wicked
[58:38] king that the the presence of God had
[58:40] left in the ANOINTING LEFT. WHEN HE
[58:42] FOUND OUT THAT HE HAD DIED, DAVID DIDN'T
[58:45] SAY YES.
[58:48] David didn't say he had it coming to
[58:50] him. David didn't say he deserved it. He
[58:53] said the light has gone out of Israel.
[58:56] And I wonder sometimes, I'm not berating
[58:57] you, but I wonder sometimes if we have
[58:59] allowed our hurts to get to a place to
[59:01] so bitter that if a brother died, we
[59:04] would rejoice in it. People who've made
[59:07] mistakes and rejected things AND THEY GO
[59:08] ON HARDSHIPS and they and they make
[59:10] mistakes and their lives become A WRECK
[59:12] AND BAD things begin to happen if we
[59:13] don't say, "Well, he asked for it."
[59:17] THINK ABOUT IT. WHAT CAUSES US TO DO
[59:19] THAT? WE DON'T FEEL ANYMORE.
[59:24] AND WE WISH JUDGMENT ON PEOPLE AND MAY
[59:26] THEY BURN AND I HOPE THIS HAPPENS. I
[59:27] HOPE THAT HAPPEN. THEY DESERVE THIS AND
[59:29] THEY DESERVE THAT. WE DON'T FEEL
[59:30] ANYMORE. WE BECOME SO HARD-HEARTED WE
[59:32] DON'T FEEL. AND JESUS SAYING those who
[59:34] feel can do things that would merit THEM
[59:37] ENTERING INTO LIFE. BUT THOSE WHO CAN'T
[59:38] FEEL ARE in danger of judgment.
[59:43] In other words, have we become numb to
[59:45] things that ought to provoke us?
[59:50] I'm I'm not scolding you at all. I I
[59:52] promise you I won't I'm not going to say
[59:55] that God's not if you if you sense it.
[59:58] Maybe some of us need to be corrected a
[59:59] little bit. But just trying to I I want
[1:00:01] you to feel again.
[1:00:03] I want you to consider JUST HOW
[1:00:05] HARD-HEARTED WE BECOME AND HOW BITTER WE
[1:00:06] BECOME TOWARDS PEOPLE AND SITUATIONS AND
[1:00:09] THINGS THAT WE WOULD REJOICE IF
[1:00:10] SOMETHING BAD HAPPENED. AND WE SHOULDN'T
[1:00:12] DO THAT. WE SHOULD BE LIKE DAVID THAT
[1:00:13] WHEN THE MAN WHO WANTED TO KILL HIM
[1:00:15] DIED, HE WEPT. HE GRIEVED. HE SAID,
[1:00:17] "THIS IS AN offense to Israel. ALL OF
[1:00:19] OUR ENEMIES ARE REJOICING." IF I SEE A
[1:00:21] BROTHER IN THIS MESSAGE FALL IN THE
[1:00:22] FIGHT, I SAY, "AH, WELL, HE DESERVED IT.
[1:00:24] HE DID THIS. HE DIDN'T believe in that."
[1:00:25] I SAY, "OH, GOD, THIS IS CAUSE FOR
[1:00:27] REPROACH TO THE BODY OF CHRIST. LORD,
[1:00:29] HAVE MERCY. LORD, BRING HEALING. LORD,
[1:00:31] BRING COMFORT." AND I WANT TO FEEL
[1:00:34] for people who make mistakes. I want to
[1:00:35] feel for people who are in error. I
[1:00:37] DON'T WANT TO REJOICE IF I SEE SOMEONE
[1:00:38] GOING THROUGH A BAD TIME AND THEY SAY,
[1:00:39] "OH, THEY ASKED FOR IT. THEY HAD IT
[1:00:41] COMING." OH, LORD, LET IT NOT BE SAID IN
[1:00:43] MY PRAYER LIFE. LET IT NOT BE SAID IN MY
[1:00:45] HEART. LET IT NOT COME FORTH FROM MY
[1:00:46] HEART THAT I WISH EVIL UPON ANYONE. BUT
[1:00:49] LORD, MAY I ONLY WISH TO DO GOOD ALL THE
[1:00:51] DAYS OF my life.
[1:00:55] And if we become numb, all these things
[1:00:57] are possible.
[1:00:58] What things? Oh well, to get to the
[1:01:00] place where you're numb to sin, you're
[1:01:01] numb to error, you're numb to the needs
[1:01:03] of others, you rejoice when bad things
[1:01:05] happen to other people.
[1:01:09] We need to have feeling.
[1:01:15] I want to use a couple scriptures
[1:01:17] to set to set the stage for our closing.
[1:01:22] Emotional numbness may protect you from
[1:01:24] pain, but it'll keep you from change.
[1:01:29] It may protect you from pain, but it'll
[1:01:31] keep you from change.
[1:01:33] And not only will it keep you from
[1:01:34] change, but it robs you of your
[1:01:37] rejoicing.
[1:01:38] You lose the ability to rejoice.
[1:01:41] Paul says in 1 Corinthians 12:es
[1:01:44] 25 and 26 that there should be no schism
[1:01:46] in the body but that the members should
[1:01:48] have the same care one for another the
[1:01:50] same feeling for one another and whether
[1:01:54] one member suffer all the members suffer
[1:01:56] with it
[1:01:58] but if you become numb you won't suffer
[1:02:00] with them
[1:02:01] you say well that's kind of good I'm the
[1:02:03] type of person that somebody can start
[1:02:04] sharing me a story and all of a sudden I
[1:02:06] get anxious I I just oh anybody have
[1:02:09] sympathy pains
[1:02:11] kind of the same thing emotionally. You
[1:02:12] like someone's telling you a story like,
[1:02:13] "Oh my goodness, my leg is killing me."
[1:02:15] And you you can get that kind of phantom
[1:02:17] sympathy pain. Well, the same way with
[1:02:19] someone's telling you a horrible story
[1:02:20] and they're telling me what they're
[1:02:21] going through and all of a sudden I
[1:02:21] start getting anxious like like you feel
[1:02:24] you begin to feel what they feel. And if
[1:02:26] you don't like that, you can just become
[1:02:28] numb to it
[1:02:31] and say, "Well, maybe I'm better off
[1:02:32] that when you suffer, I don't suffer."
[1:02:33] But guess what? But when all members
[1:02:35] rejoice, when one is honored,
[1:02:37] one member be honored, all the members
[1:02:39] rejoice with it.
[1:02:42] And then that's what creates this ugly
[1:02:44] side of it. You try to protect yourself
[1:02:45] so much you don't want to feel pain that
[1:02:47] when there's a honor that comes, you try
[1:02:50] to tell yourself it's not real. You
[1:02:52] start saying, "Well, that can't be the
[1:02:53] Lord." Well, they said they had really
[1:02:54] good meetings. Ah, you know, that was
[1:02:56] just fanaticism. It's probably just the
[1:02:57] devil that showed up. But someone was
[1:02:59] healed of cancer. Probably fake. You
[1:03:01] can't even rejoice anymore. Someone told
[1:03:03] me a testimony one time. Well, did you
[1:03:05] hear about that guy prayed for this
[1:03:06] person? And there there was two, it was
[1:03:08] like a a well-known worldly uh, you
[1:03:10] know, nominal Christian evangelist and
[1:03:12] some athlete who got prayed for and
[1:03:13] healed. And they go, I don't believe it.
[1:03:14] I said, what what do you not believe?
[1:03:16] That God heals things?
[1:03:19] You don't need to weigh in on it. You
[1:03:20] can say, "I believe God's a healer.
[1:03:22] I think Evander Holyfield had a hole
[1:03:24] heal in his heart by his own testimony.
[1:03:25] I'm fine believing that. That when Benny
[1:03:27] Hinn prayed for him, his heart was
[1:03:28] healed. That doesn't bring any reproach.
[1:03:32] that that's not a threat to what I
[1:03:33] believe.
[1:03:34] If that threatens what you believe, then
[1:03:36] what you believe is that God's not a
[1:03:38] healer.
[1:03:39] AND THAT'S THE THREAT THAT GOD IS
[1:03:41] ACTUALLY STILL HEALING. WE DON'T NEED TO
[1:03:43] HAVE JUDGMENTS ON YOUTH CAMPS AND MOVES
[1:03:45] OF GOD AND DISPLAYS OF GIFTS AND ALL
[1:03:47] THESE DIFFERENT MANIFESTATIONS BECAUSE
[1:03:48] THOSE THINGS ARE NO THREAT OF THE TRUTH.
[1:03:53] And that's the problem when you get in
[1:03:54] this state of you becoming numb. Not
[1:03:56] only do you are you do you not suffer
[1:03:58] when another member suffers, but then
[1:03:59] when one a member is honored, you can't
[1:04:01] rejoice with them.
[1:04:04] Because if you're not willing to suffer
[1:04:05] pain, then you can't enjoy the glory.
[1:04:08] If you're not willing to suffer with
[1:04:09] somebody else, then you can't enjoy
[1:04:10] their honor. And that may be the reason
[1:04:13] why sometimes we find it so hard to
[1:04:14] rejoice in others is because we weren't
[1:04:16] willing to enter into their pain. that
[1:04:18] when they experience the deliverance,
[1:04:20] they experience the rescue, they
[1:04:21] experience the honor, we're unable to
[1:04:22] rejoice with them because we never hurt
[1:04:25] with them.
[1:04:29] Does it make sense to one of you?
[1:04:31] Paul revisits a similar thing in 2
[1:04:33] Corinthians chapter 7:3 after they have
[1:04:36] repented. He backs it up a little bit. I
[1:04:38] think it's around verse 5. He says a
[1:04:39] little bit more about this setting it
[1:04:40] up. He says, "Therefore, we were
[1:04:42] comforted in your comfort." Paul derived
[1:04:44] comfort in his pain and his anxiety in
[1:04:46] the fact that the Corinthians were
[1:04:48] comforted that they had repented and
[1:04:49] they had been restored. Yay. And
[1:04:51] exceedingly the more joyed we for the
[1:04:54] joy of Titus
[1:04:56] because his spirit was refreshed BY YOU
[1:04:58] ALL. PAUL REJOICED AND WAS ENCOURAGED BY
[1:05:00] THEIR REPENTANCE. PAUL WAS COMFORTED
[1:05:02] knowing that they were comforted. Paul
[1:05:04] delighted in Titus's joy because of
[1:05:06] their care. THIS IS SOMEONE WHO
[1:05:08] REGARDLESS OF WHAT HE WAS GOING THROUGH
[1:05:10] COULD ACTUALLY BE HAPPY BECAUSE SOMEBODY
[1:05:11] ELSE WAS GETTING SOMETHING GOOD.
[1:05:14] Doesn't matter what I'm going through, I
[1:05:15] am comforted. I BELIEVE THAT WHEN ONE
[1:05:17] MEMBER SUFFERS, WE ALL SUFFER. PAUL WAS
[1:05:19] SUFFERING WHEN THE CORINTHIANS CHURCH
[1:05:20] WAS IN ERROR. BUT NOW THAT THEY HAD BEEN
[1:05:21] RESTORED, PAUL SAYS, I'M COMFORTED BY
[1:05:23] THE FACT THAT YOU'VE REPENTED. I'M
[1:05:25] COMFORTED BY THE FACT THAT YOU'VE BEEN
[1:05:26] RESTORED. AND YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M EXCITED
[1:05:28] and I'm joyful because of the joy of
[1:05:30] Titus. Not my own joy because I'm happy
[1:05:33] I'm happy, but I have a joy because of
[1:05:35] the joy of Titus.
[1:05:39] Isn't that beautiful?
[1:05:45] This is this is what we miss out on when
[1:05:46] we become numb. Again, I'm not trying to
[1:05:48] correct you or scold you. I want you to
[1:05:50] start have feeling again. Maybe provide
[1:05:53] motivation to feel. So, yes, I've tried
[1:05:56] to protect myself for so long, but God's
[1:05:58] built me to serve. God's built me to be
[1:06:00] a servant. God's built me to be a prayer
[1:06:02] warrior. God's built me to be one that
[1:06:04] can care and one that can reach out and
[1:06:06] do these things. And I've allowed myself
[1:06:07] to build myself into a complex to where
[1:06:09] now I'm afraid to do all these other
[1:06:11] things because of this complex. And you
[1:06:13] want to start having feeling to motivate
[1:06:15] you to walk into the gift that God's
[1:06:17] given you. I want to have feeling again.
[1:06:19] So, I'm motivated. This emotion
[1:06:21] motivates me to begin to do the things I
[1:06:23] know that God has gifted me and called
[1:06:24] me to do. Motivate me to do what I know
[1:06:26] is God's PERFECT WILL. REGARDLESS OF
[1:06:28] WHAT THE consequences may be on this. I
[1:06:30] want to feel again in order to face the
[1:06:32] reality of these difficulties, FACE THE
[1:06:34] REALITY OF WHAT MAY take place, but yet
[1:06:35] have this motivation for the joy which
[1:06:37] is set before me. I'm willing to step
[1:06:39] out and endure the rejection,
[1:06:43] the hurt, the pain, the loss, or the the
[1:06:45] disappointments that come with service.
[1:06:49] And the message, believe thou this,
[1:06:52] he's talking about how when Mary came to
[1:06:54] Elizabeth, I could see Elizabeth sitting
[1:06:55] maybe doing some knitting and when she
[1:06:56] seen Mary coming, she threw aside the
[1:06:58] crocheting or knitting, whatever it was,
[1:07:00] and run out there and grabbed her in her
[1:07:02] arms and begin to hug her and kiss her.
[1:07:04] Says, "Well, they had feelings
[1:07:08] between them. It's something mutual uh
[1:07:11] uh between Mary a and Elizabeth that
[1:07:14] when they saw each other, there was just
[1:07:15] something that sprung up inside of
[1:07:17] them." and and and that was maybe one of
[1:07:18] the drawbacks uh uh for the introverts.
[1:07:21] We loved COVID. We put we had masks on.
[1:07:23] We couldn't shake hands. It wasn't this
[1:07:25] awkward when you go to shake a brother's
[1:07:26] hand. Does he want to hug? Does he not
[1:07:28] want to hug? I don't know what to do.
[1:07:29] And so you just kind of
[1:07:31] But with co it was just kind of like
[1:07:33] they didn't even have to know you had a
[1:07:34] frown, right? You just kind of try to
[1:07:35] use your eyebrows to signal God bless
[1:07:37] you. And but this is something that they
[1:07:39] had then there was like this instinct TO
[1:07:42] GO AND EMBRACE and to hug. He says,
[1:07:43] "Well, they had feelings. You know
[1:07:45] what's the matter with the people today?
[1:07:47] We're getting away from that. Don't feel
[1:07:50] for one another. I'd say you don't even
[1:07:53] have to be through some personal trauma.
[1:07:54] You just have to get busy.
[1:07:57] Doesn't have to be trauma, a personal
[1:07:58] heart. Doesn't have to be a terrible
[1:07:59] catastrophe in your life. Doesn't have
[1:08:00] to be some kind of emotional verbal
[1:08:02] abuse or spiritual abuse that put you in
[1:08:03] this state of being numb. It could just
[1:08:05] be life, just the grind, the demands. He
[1:08:08] says, "Well, we are getting away from
[1:08:09] that. We don't feel for one another.
[1:08:11] Why? It used to be when I was a kid, if
[1:08:12] the neighbor got sick, why we went over
[1:08:14] there and cut wood for them and help
[1:08:15] them fill the silo, cut their corn, and
[1:08:17] mom would go down and wash up the kids
[1:08:19] and get their breakfast for them when
[1:08:20] someone was sick. But now, you don't
[1:08:22] even know your neighbor's dead unless
[1:08:24] you read it in the paper.
[1:08:27] The paper. I got to explain that now.
[1:08:32] He said, "There's no feeling.
[1:08:35] You don't even know anymore until it's
[1:08:38] on Facebook.
[1:08:41] You don't even know anymore till it hits
[1:08:42] the media, social media, something said,
[1:08:44] "Oh, I didn't know that."
[1:08:47] The Bible said, "Because iniquity
[1:08:49] abound, the love of many shall wax
[1:08:50] cold." There it is. Why? When daddy
[1:08:53] would need $50, he'd go over and borrow
[1:08:54] it from the farmer friend. He'd pay him
[1:08:56] back when he had sold the crop. Why?
[1:08:58] This is an amen. Big amen here. Why? You
[1:09:00] couldn't borrow $5 now without a $50
[1:09:02] security.
[1:09:04] [laughter]
[1:09:06] What does he relate it to? That's right.
[1:09:07] No feeling, no trust.
[1:09:12] The dark side of capitalism,
[1:09:15] greed,
[1:09:17] not altruistic anymore. You don't have a
[1:09:19] feeling for somebody. You're looking at
[1:09:20] somebody who says, "Look, I'm a hard
[1:09:21] worker. I can do this. I just need a
[1:09:23] little bit of capital to make it through
[1:09:24] this harvest season. If I get through, I
[1:09:26] got these crops and I can I can give you
[1:09:28] this security and I can do this." And
[1:09:29] they're looking at saying, they're
[1:09:30] running the numbers. Well, how many
[1:09:32] points am I going to get on the loan
[1:09:33] origination? What's the LTV? If you
[1:09:36] can't make the payment, you know, then
[1:09:37] I'll loan you 30%. You know, I'll give
[1:09:39] you a 30%. Because you're hoping that he
[1:09:41] doesn't pay then,
[1:09:43] right? You can get the land. People
[1:09:45] think scheme that way. They operate that
[1:09:48] way. Read a headline the other day that
[1:09:50] Amazon managers will intentionally fire
[1:09:52] people that they know they're going to
[1:09:53] hire people that they know they're going
[1:09:54] to fire so they can meet a turnover
[1:09:56] ratio.
[1:09:58] So, do they care what you're going
[1:10:00] through when they hire you? Are they
[1:10:01] they have a sense of feeling that you
[1:10:03] need to you have your bills paid that
[1:10:04] this needs to happen? Or are they just
[1:10:06] motivated by the fact that my numbers
[1:10:07] are going to look good and I'm going to
[1:10:08] get get the bonus?
[1:10:10] Hey, I'm not trying to scare you AND
[1:10:12] MAKE YOU REGRET THE JOB you have and
[1:10:13] think life is horrible. This is why we
[1:10:16] need pure joy.
[1:10:18] This is why we need it more than ever.
[1:10:21] Look at HOW BROTHER BRAM'S DESCRIBING
[1:10:22] THE WAY PEOPLE GET. THEY HAD NO
[1:10:24] FEELINGS. We're getting away from
[1:10:25] feeling. WE DON'T FEEL FOR ONE ANOTHER.
[1:10:27] There's no feeling for your neighbors,
[1:10:29] for your community, for the sinner, for
[1:10:30] the people around you. No feeling.
[1:10:34] He's describing the way that it used to
[1:10:35] be. He said uses a similar line of
[1:10:38] thinking in the resurrection of Lazarus.
[1:10:39] He said, "Women used to do that."
[1:10:40] Talking about Mary
[1:10:42] and Martha and Elizabeth embracing and
[1:10:44] kissing. Men used to have great
[1:10:46] fellowship, BUT THAT DIED OUT SOMEWHERE.
[1:10:49] That's right. We don't have love one for
[1:10:51] another no more. Don't have no feeling
[1:10:53] for one another no more. Why? The only
[1:10:56] way you know your neighbor's dead is
[1:10:57] when you read it in the paper anymore.
[1:10:59] That's right. Nobody don't have any
[1:11:01] feeling for one another. That's this is
[1:11:03] where you need a double negative to make
[1:11:05] the point.
[1:11:07] Nobody don't have any feeling for one
[1:11:09] another. There's no feeling. Where's the
[1:11:12] real feeling? Where's the real care?
[1:11:14] Well, down in Kentucky, we used to go
[1:11:15] and help shuck the corn and cut the wood
[1:11:17] and everything when somebody was sick.
[1:11:18] YOU DON'T KNOW NOTHING ABOUT THAT no
[1:11:20] more.
[1:11:22] Nobody knows anything about it.
[1:11:23] Brotherly love just seems to be ceasing.
[1:11:26] It's too bad.
[1:11:33] I'm not suggesting you go chop your
[1:11:34] neighbor's tree down when you hear they
[1:11:36] have the flu and
[1:11:38] just go buy them corn.
[1:11:41] But anymore, I'd say, well, th that
[1:11:44] those specifics aren't applicable unless
[1:11:46] we lived in more of an agrarian
[1:11:47] community.
[1:11:49] But what's the general not the
[1:11:51] specifics, what's the general thing? You
[1:11:52] know your neighbor enough to know one,
[1:11:54] they're sick and two, what they might
[1:11:57] need when they are.
[1:12:00] And again, my emphasis isn't that we
[1:12:02] would get to know our neighbors enough
[1:12:03] to know. I think there's got to be a lot
[1:12:05] of wisdom and prudence in the time that
[1:12:07] we're living in. I'm just talking about
[1:12:08] the lack of feeling.
[1:12:11] Because you could look at even in our
[1:12:12] own church. Do we know when another
[1:12:14] one's suffering enough to suffer with
[1:12:16] them? Do we know one another enough to
[1:12:18] be honored when another person is
[1:12:20] honored and rejoice with them? He's
[1:12:22] identifying a callousness,
[1:12:24] a slackness.
[1:12:28] And I know that many of you have
[1:12:30] suffered deeply.
[1:12:32] I know that many of you have wounds and
[1:12:34] there's scars
[1:12:37] in your emotions and in your spirits.
[1:12:39] And I say this as from the Lord. He
[1:12:42] wants to heal you.
[1:12:45] We can go forward.
[1:12:48] I wouldn't suggest that you need to get
[1:12:50] over it.
[1:12:51] But you can move forward.
[1:12:55] You don't need to move on and get over
[1:12:56] it. But you can go forward.
[1:12:59] You can go forward not worried about
[1:13:00] things being debilitating. You can go
[1:13:01] forward without not being afraid of the
[1:13:03] pain. You can go forward not being
[1:13:04] haunted by rejection. You can go
[1:13:06] forward. Why? Because you're trusting to
[1:13:08] the yourself to the care of God.
[1:13:11] Revelations chapter 2 verse two,
[1:13:14] God says, "I know thy works and thy
[1:13:16] labor and thy patience." Brother says
[1:13:19] this about the word labor. The very word
[1:13:21] labor signifies a weariness through
[1:13:23] oppression. Now, think about this. We
[1:13:25] say, "I know thy works, and I know thy
[1:13:26] labor." We say, "Oh, well, I I I'm just
[1:13:28] not able to work anymore. I'm not able
[1:13:29] to labor. I'm not able to do. I'm not
[1:13:31] able to perform. I I don't do all the
[1:13:32] things I should have done before." And
[1:13:34] this IS ACTUALLY WHAT HE'S SAYING. I
[1:13:35] know your labor. I know your weariness
[1:13:37] through oppression.
[1:13:39] I know that you were faithful at one
[1:13:41] time. I know you used to do this. I know
[1:13:42] YOU USED TO REJOICE. I KNOW THAT YOU
[1:13:44] USED TO ENJOY THIS. And I know this the
[1:13:46] way it used TO BE. BUT I'M ALSO NOW
[1:13:48] AWARE OF your numbness and your
[1:13:50] weariness through oppression. He said,
[1:13:52] God's people do not only work for him in
[1:13:54] a labor of love, but they suffer for him
[1:13:56] with joy. They're patient in bearing the
[1:13:58] yoke.
[1:14:00] So God is mindful of the oppression. God
[1:14:03] is mindful of the difficulties. If
[1:14:06] you're suffering, DON'T DON'T GET FRIED
[1:14:07] AND BE SO DESPONDENT AND CAST DOWN
[1:14:10] BECAUSE YOU'VE SUFFERED AND YOU LOOK
[1:14:11] BACK UPON YOUR LIFE. I'VE SUFFERED. I'VE
[1:14:13] SUFFERED THIS. I'VE SUFFERED THAT. AND
[1:14:14] MY WHOLE LIFE HAS BEEN SUFFERING IN LOSS
[1:14:16] AND REJECTION. AND YOU BEGIN TO LOOK AT
[1:14:17] IT. BROTHER B said, "The church that is
[1:14:19] not suffering and is not being tried,
[1:14:21] hasn't got it." He says, "Isn't of God."
[1:14:26] So the suffering is no evidence that
[1:14:27] you're not a child of God. Suffering is
[1:14:29] no evidence that you don't have what
[1:14:30] have what you need.
[1:14:33] And maybe even the devil's convinced you
[1:14:35] that it's happened because you're not
[1:14:37] worthy.
[1:14:39] When in reality, you know the opposite
[1:14:40] is true. that the church when it endured
[1:14:42] affliction and persecution and
[1:14:44] suffering, they counted themselves
[1:14:45] worthy. They saw he he thought I was
[1:14:48] worthy. If you're in a difficult time
[1:14:50] right now, it invert and say, you know
[1:14:52] what? God counted me worthy for this.
[1:14:55] I'm not going through it because I'M NOT
[1:14:57] WORTHY. I'M NOT GOING THROUGH IT BECAUSE
[1:14:58] I'M WORTHLESS AND I'M HOPELESS and I'm
[1:15:00] helpless and I can't do anything. YOU'RE
[1:15:01] GOING THROUGH IT BECAUSE YOU ARE WORTHY
[1:15:04] OF IT. BECAUSE HE KNOWS THAT YOU CAN
[1:15:06] MAKE IT THROUGH IT. HE'S NOT GOING TO
[1:15:08] PUT ON YOU MORE than you can bear.
[1:15:11] invert. Always invert.
[1:15:15] Don't let it overwhelm you to where you
[1:15:17] enter into a darkness
[1:15:20] and your heart becomes numb within you.
[1:15:23] Let me say this. I I
[1:15:26] with God's help,
[1:15:28] the very things that God that the very
[1:15:30] things that made you become numb can be
[1:15:33] used to bring you joy.
[1:15:37] Not in them being repeated, not in you
[1:15:39] justifying them, but in you facing them
[1:15:43] and overcoming them.
[1:15:45] I have a lengthy statement to read to
[1:15:47] you in closing.
[1:15:50] Follow me as we go through this. I
[1:15:51] didn't anticipate uh being this long,
[1:15:54] but I know you probably did.
[1:15:57] Don't fool yourself, brother Aaron.
[1:16:01] And the message uniting time and sign.
[1:16:04] Such a beautiful a beautiful reading
[1:16:07] here. Are you with me? It's 11:47. I
[1:16:11] think we can make it. We can make it
[1:16:13] through. I think we can do this.
[1:16:16] Not through numbness, but just owning
[1:16:18] the weariness, owning the length of it,
[1:16:20] saying, "It's been long. It's been kind
[1:16:22] of dry, but God's going to pour out
[1:16:24] something. I'm going to get my going to
[1:16:25] get my blessing." in the message uniting
[1:16:28] time and sign he says speaking of
[1:16:30] tension I was a praying about I was
[1:16:32] praying about it this morning
[1:16:35] what would you do if you didn't have
[1:16:36] tension now take tension and think
[1:16:39] stress
[1:16:40] think anxiety think pressure think being
[1:16:43] bowed down think of the sense of feeling
[1:16:45] overwhelmed there's conflict there's
[1:16:47] tension and it's tension a lot of times
[1:16:49] that causes people to disengage and
[1:16:51] there's some people when there's tension
[1:16:52] they run from it
[1:16:55] people don't like conflict they don't
[1:16:56] want an argument All of a sudden, they
[1:16:58] notice like the volume starts to raise
[1:16:59] in a room. It looks like there's going
[1:17:00] to be a fight. Boom. People are gone.
[1:17:03] They don't want confrontation. They just
[1:17:04] assume, "Let something go crazy. THINGS
[1:17:06] GO WILD. If they if you GOT A PROBLEM,
[1:17:08] YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO SOLVE IT. If
[1:17:09] your problems with me, then I'm sorry.
[1:17:10] I'm just going to get out of here." And
[1:17:11] and you don't want to face it. That's
[1:17:13] tension.
[1:17:14] And can we admit that in that context,
[1:17:16] tension a lot of times is what causes us
[1:17:18] to become numb because we don't like to
[1:17:20] feel tension.
[1:17:23] But what would you do if you didn't have
[1:17:24] it?
[1:17:26] Just think of it. Tension is part of
[1:17:28] living.
[1:17:30] That kind of encouraged me when I
[1:17:31] thought that.
[1:17:33] This is Brother Bram. Now, if you had no
[1:17:35] tension, you'd be like a ragd doll. You
[1:17:39] wouldn't have no feelings.
[1:17:41] There'd be nothing you could work on.
[1:17:47] Think of that. The tension is the signal
[1:17:52] that this is where work needs to be
[1:17:53] done.
[1:17:55] in your own jealousy, in your own
[1:17:57] frustration, in your own perception, in
[1:17:59] the relationship, the tension is a
[1:18:01] signal God wants to work here.
[1:18:04] And if we become numb to it, whatever it
[1:18:06] is in us that's a weakness, whatever it
[1:18:08] is in us that God's WANTING TO CHANGE,
[1:18:09] WHATEVER IT IS ABOUT US THAT HAS caused
[1:18:11] us to be perpetuate these cycles, God
[1:18:13] said, "I'm wanting to deal with it. I'm
[1:18:14] wanting to deal with it." But whenever
[1:18:16] we get tense, we run away from it. And
[1:18:17] what I'm saying to you this time IS IF
[1:18:19] THERE'S TENSION, DON'T BE SO QUICK to
[1:18:21] numb up and RUN AWAY. ASK YOURSELF, WHY
[1:18:23] IS IT I'M STARTING TO BE uncomfortable
[1:18:25] with this?
[1:18:28] There'd be nothing you could work on,
[1:18:29] which is about growth, maturity, change.
[1:18:33] If there wasn't tension, there'd be
[1:18:35] nothing to work with, nothing to work
[1:18:37] on. And then the next paragraph, this is
[1:18:39] kind of reading this together. And the
[1:18:41] way that he uses this, I thought it was
[1:18:44] wonderful because I kept reading it over
[1:18:45] and over and again say trying to make
[1:18:47] complete sense out of it and I realized
[1:18:49] he's referring to something and he's not
[1:18:52] able just to come right out and say it.
[1:18:54] And it could have been just the way the
[1:18:56] word could discern situations. But what
[1:18:58] I want you to take away from this is
[1:19:00] even though he doesn't get specific,
[1:19:02] he's talking about a husband and wife
[1:19:03] coming into conflict in tension and how
[1:19:06] that and I know that I'm trying to
[1:19:08] summarize it when I could just read it
[1:19:09] to you. how that if the husband and wife
[1:19:12] will work out the tension, the beauty
[1:19:14] that results from it is so awesome.
[1:19:18] But if they just through their tens and
[1:19:20] just turn away from each other, they're
[1:19:22] just going to get further apart. So they
[1:19:25] want to avoid this dealing with this
[1:19:26] issue that could actually bring them
[1:19:28] closer together. And in just becoming
[1:19:29] numb to it, you walk away.
[1:19:32] And I've expressed this to my wife
[1:19:34] before with things that I've gone
[1:19:35] through in my life, whether it be as a
[1:19:38] as a child growing up and things in
[1:19:40] school, uh, and things in college and
[1:19:42] you just name it. And then even as a
[1:19:43] Christian, as a minister, and the
[1:19:45] experience I've gone, I I I have I I
[1:19:47] have a a very robust defense mechanism
[1:19:49] that can just shut down, get callous,
[1:19:51] put my head down, work, get through, and
[1:19:52] I'll make it and not have to worry about
[1:19:55] everything else. And I realized that's a
[1:19:56] weakness, not a strength
[1:19:59] because I'll never I you'll never
[1:20:01] nothing will ever change. Nothing will
[1:20:02] ever get better.
[1:20:04] So it's like a husband and wife maybe if
[1:20:06] she wants to do something and they're
[1:20:07] trying to work together. He says
[1:20:08] especially Christians.
[1:20:10] Come on somebody.
[1:20:13] And the other one wants it's a fragment.
[1:20:15] And then the and then when you come
[1:20:16] together
[1:20:18] and find out what she's done, she finds
[1:20:21] out
[1:20:24] Huh.
[1:20:26] What? What you saying, brother Bram?
[1:20:28] Just tell me. Just tell me what what
[1:20:30] what are you trying to say? WELL, HE'S
[1:20:31] TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING. SO, let's just
[1:20:34] put ourselves in here that she wants to
[1:20:36] do something. You're trying to work it
[1:20:38] together. You're Christians. The other
[1:20:39] one wants this. Then, when you come
[1:20:41] together and you find out what she's
[1:20:42] done, she finds out whatever it might
[1:20:44] be. Fill in the fragments. Complete the
[1:20:46] sentences. See that? But he says the
[1:20:49] tension really brings you closer
[1:20:50] together
[1:20:53] when you come together AND FIND THINGS
[1:20:55] OUT AND DISCOVER things and work through
[1:20:56] things. It really brings you closer
[1:20:58] TOGETHER AND SOMEONE TELLS YOU WELL said
[1:21:01] well just think of that little wife that
[1:21:03] went under a lot of tension when you
[1:21:05] wasn't so good or the husband went under
[1:21:07] some tension when you wasn't so good.
[1:21:11] Then when it's all forgiven look how you
[1:21:13] feel about him. My you just see you've
[1:21:17] got to have tension. That's all.
[1:21:23] It really struck me. I don't know how
[1:21:26] you feel.
[1:21:28] Go ahead and answer it and tell them it
[1:21:29] really struck you, too. Is someone
[1:21:31] streaming wanting to call in an amen
[1:21:33] because it was so quiet. They're feeling
[1:21:34] bad for me. Like, oh, that was really
[1:21:35] awesome. Let me just call in and give an
[1:21:37] amen.
[1:21:40] No, I was waiting for the to put it on
[1:21:42] speaker.
[1:21:45] This is so beautiful in just a few
[1:21:48] sentences that really seem to convey
[1:21:49] some incomplete thoughts. We can all
[1:21:51] ENTER INTO IT WITH OUR OWN situation
[1:21:54] that when people are Christians and they
[1:21:56] love one another and a difficulty comes
[1:21:58] up, IF YOU RUN AWAY AND DON'T ADDRESS
[1:22:00] IT, IF YOU ALWAYS SEPARATE, IF YOU
[1:22:01] ALWAYS BURY IT, IF YOU NEVER NEVER
[1:22:03] RESOLVE IT, THEN YOU'RE ACTUALLY
[1:22:05] ULTIMATELY MISSING OUT ON RESOLVING
[1:22:07] TENSION THAT BRINGS YOU CLOSER TOGETHER.
[1:22:09] SAYS, "OH, IT MAKES ME LOVE YOU MORE
[1:22:11] WHEN ALL IS FORGIVEN. LOOK HOW YOU FEEL
[1:22:13] NOW. AND IT'S THE TENSION THAT BROUGHT
[1:22:16] OUT A DEEPER AND GREATER LOVE. HE SAID,
[1:22:18] "THAT'S all the tension did it. This is
[1:22:21] inversion.
[1:22:23] This is inverted. Oh, THIS IS HARD. THIS
[1:22:24] IS ROUGH. THIS IS GOING TO THIS IS GOING
[1:22:27] TO RUIN US. NO, IT'S GOING TO MAKE US
[1:22:28] BETTER. WE'RE GOING TO GET THROUGH
[1:22:30] THIS."
[1:22:32] Then he says this, this is continuing
[1:22:34] just straight on through. He goes, "And
[1:22:35] just think of feelings. What if you
[1:22:38] didn't have any feelings, no pains or
[1:22:39] nothing? What if there'd be no pain at
[1:22:42] all? You'd have no feelings at all. If
[1:22:45] you had no feeling, then one of your
[1:22:46] senses would be gone. See? So, see,
[1:22:49] everything's just right anyhow.
[1:22:52] What is when you hurt?
[1:22:56] When you feel, see that everything's all
[1:22:59] right. So, God just give us grace to
[1:23:03] stand up to it. That's the thing.
[1:23:07] Now, notice the language. If you had no
[1:23:10] feeling, there's nothing standing up.
[1:23:14] There's nothing there. You don't feel
[1:23:15] it. I'm just dead to it. And I do I do
[1:23:18] believe just to throw a qualifying,
[1:23:21] there's some things we just need to die
[1:23:22] to.
[1:23:24] But we can get in such a practice of
[1:23:25] dying out to things that when something
[1:23:26] really matters, we just get dead to it
[1:23:29] instead of trying to figure it out. What
[1:23:31] go what is God doing? Why is this an
[1:23:32] issue? Why is this happening? So his his
[1:23:35] attitude is so God just give us grace to
[1:23:38] stand up to it,
[1:23:40] not run away from it, not become dead to
[1:23:42] it. That's the thing. If I just stand up
[1:23:44] with that grace and stand there and say,
[1:23:46] "We know that when this life is over,
[1:23:48] the great ones on the other side what
[1:23:50] we're looking to go to."
[1:23:53] If there's feelings, you want by the
[1:23:55] grace of God to stand up to it. He
[1:23:58] continues, "Some people tries to
[1:23:59] introduce Christianity that you're free
[1:24:01] from worry. No, you're not. You're free
[1:24:05] from tension. Oh, no.
[1:24:08] You add tension when YOU BECOME A
[1:24:10] CHRISTIAN.
[1:24:11] ALL RIGHT, there you go. Much better.
[1:24:14] You add tension when you become A
[1:24:16] CHRISTIAN. DO YOU NOT THINK THE TENSION
[1:24:17] WOULD GET GREATER THE FURTHER and deeper
[1:24:19] you go in Christ?
[1:24:22] Because there's something against you.
[1:24:24] He says BECAUSE YOU WAS KIND OF A SLOP
[1:24:27] GO HAPPY GOLUCKY whatever it was out
[1:24:28] there, not caring what you did. But when
[1:24:31] you become a real Christian, every
[1:24:33] moment you're wondering, am I pleasing
[1:24:34] the Lord? If I could hear from him,
[1:24:37] it puts you on attention, puts you on
[1:24:40] guard. THAT'S WHAT MAKES YOU WHAT YOU
[1:24:42] ARE. SO, AFTER ALL, TENSION IS A
[1:24:44] BLESSING.
[1:24:46] There's so much more God could
[1:24:48] communicate to you through this than
[1:24:49] what I'm conveying because I'm talking
[1:24:51] about feeling again. And we've gotten so
[1:24:52] used to denying the tension and the
[1:24:54] stress that we've made we we've run away
[1:24:56] from it. But now, I'm wanting you to
[1:24:57] feel again. Become uncomfortable with
[1:24:59] your numbness. start to feel again. Say,
[1:25:01] Lord, if there's tension, there's got to
[1:25:03] be beauty on the other side of it. Then
[1:25:05] there's something in this, Lord. We're
[1:25:06] going to we're going to stand up to it
[1:25:08] by the grace of God. We're not going to
[1:25:09] lean into it and accept it what it's
[1:25:11] speaking about. We're not going to take
[1:25:12] it for what it's trying TO SAY, BUT I'M
[1:25:14] NOT GOING TO RUN AWAY FROM IT this time.
[1:25:16] And I'm going to STAND UP TO IT BY THE
[1:25:17] GRACE OF GOD AND KNOW THAT this tension
[1:25:19] is going to be a blessing. IT'S JUST THE
[1:25:22] WAY YOU'RE LOOKING at it. Invert.
[1:25:25] It's just the way you're looking at it.
[1:25:26] He says it twice. IT'S YOU JUST LOOK THE
[1:25:29] OTHER SIDE. NO MATTER HOW THIN YOU SLICE
[1:25:31] ANYTHING, YOU STILL GOT TWO SIDES TO IT.
[1:25:33] YOU SEE, YOU WANT TO SEE BOTH SIDES.
[1:25:38] SO, WE COULD JUST TAKE IT. THIS TRIAL IS
[1:25:41] GOING TO TURN INTO A BLESSING. THE ON
[1:25:43] THE OTHER SIDE OF IT, JUST FLIP IT
[1:25:44] AROUND. IT'S GOT TO BE THERE. THIS
[1:25:45] TENSION IS GOING TO BECOME a blessing.
[1:25:47] THIS PRESSURE IS GOING TO BECOME A A
[1:25:49] BLESSING. EVERYTHING YOU'RE FACING JUST
[1:25:51] INVERTED. TURN IT AROUND. IT CANNOT WORK
[1:25:53] OUT ANY OTHER WAY THAN GOOD.
[1:25:57] And we wouldn't have it without the
[1:25:59] tension.
[1:26:01] Some people say Christianity is free
[1:26:02] from tension or worry. Oh no. Uh-uh. You
[1:26:04] add it when you become one.
[1:26:08] Does that mean our lives become tense
[1:26:09] and forboding? No. No. We're just
[1:26:12] letting something keep us from running
[1:26:14] into the garden of the fruits of the
[1:26:16] spirit.
[1:26:18] And maybe that's the maybe that's where
[1:26:20] most of us find us ourselves,
[1:26:23] the fruits of the flesh and all the
[1:26:24] sinful activities that are listed there
[1:26:26] in Galatians. We haven't run into that,
[1:26:30] but we're not enjoying the fruits of the
[1:26:31] spirit.
[1:26:33] We're just numb
[1:26:35] right in between.
[1:26:37] Loving God enough to know I can never go
[1:26:39] back to that, but complex enough to
[1:26:41] where you can't enjoy the outcome and
[1:26:44] the product of walking in the spirit.
[1:26:47] So he says, 'What is tension? What's
[1:26:49] this tension?
[1:26:51] If I could have been born without this
[1:26:53] tension,
[1:26:55] this blessed me so much because here
[1:26:56] just recently I even made the comment, I
[1:26:58] wish I could live my life over again
[1:27:00] uh with with uh being free from these
[1:27:03] anxieties and cares that I was plagued
[1:27:04] with. He says, if I could have been born
[1:27:06] without this tension, well, if I
[1:27:07] wouldn't have had this tension, I
[1:27:09] wouldn't have been what I am. I wouldn't
[1:27:11] have been a Christian. Perhaps it was
[1:27:13] this tension that drove me to Jesus
[1:27:15] Christ.
[1:27:16] So it's been a blessing thing to me. So
[1:27:19] then as Paul said as though when we had
[1:27:20] attention or something or another, I had
[1:27:22] consulted the Lord to take it away from
[1:27:23] thee three times. The Lord said, "Paul,
[1:27:25] my grace is sufficient." He said, "Then
[1:27:27] I'll glory in my infirmities. Then when
[1:27:29] I'm weak, I'm strong. And as long as
[1:27:32] it's to do the will of God, all right."
[1:27:35] Now, I consulted him one time when it
[1:27:37] used to bother me so bad, his tension.
[1:27:40] It scared me. And he told me about eight
[1:27:42] or 10 years ago, he said, "Now listen,
[1:27:44] this is where if you become numb to the
[1:27:46] fear, that's one thing. But if you ask
[1:27:49] God to take it away, that's another. But
[1:27:52] notice where God puts him. It'll never
[1:27:56] scare you again."
[1:27:58] And it never has, did it?
[1:28:02] He didn't say the tension was gone. It
[1:28:05] just didn't scare him.
[1:28:08] Isn't that why we become numb?
[1:28:11] You may never you never may you may not
[1:28:13] be able to change what has been or what
[1:28:15] is, but it's what it does to you.
[1:28:19] And God says, "I don't need to change
[1:28:21] anything. I can just change what it does
[1:28:23] to you.
[1:28:25] It'll never scare you again. It never
[1:28:26] has did it." No, sir. Don't worry about
[1:28:29] it. I just feel it, but I know it's
[1:28:32] there. But I just go on because it don't
[1:28:34] scare me no more. So thankful for that.
[1:28:38] NOW, HE COULD HAVE SAID, "IT won't be no
[1:28:40] more just as well as that, you won't be
[1:28:44] scared no more."
[1:28:46] You pondering this? Are you catching
[1:28:49] this? He said he could have said, "It
[1:28:51] won't be there anymore just as well AS
[1:28:53] IT WON'T SCARE YOU ANYMORE. SO, IT'S HIS
[1:28:55] WILL THAT IT HAPPENED. SO, I JUST
[1:28:57] EMBRACE IT AND SAY, "THANK YOU, LORD.
[1:28:58] [screaming] I'LL WALK THAT WAY.
[1:29:01] I'LL JUST EMBRACE IT. SAY, "THANK YOU,
[1:29:03] LORD." IF HE CHOOSES NOT TO TAKE IT
[1:29:05] AWAY, THEN WE COULD STAND UP TO IT BY
[1:29:07] THE GRACE OF GOD AND NOT LET IT SCARE US
[1:29:10] ANYMORE.
[1:29:11] I don't need to LIVE MY WHOLE LIFE
[1:29:13] AFRAID I'M GOING TO RUN INTO THIS AT THE
[1:29:14] GROCERY STORE. I DON'T NEED TO LIVE MY
[1:29:16] WHOLE LIFE AFRAID THAT IT'S GOING TO
[1:29:17] COME BACK AGAIN. WELL, WHAT IF IT COMES
[1:29:19] BACK AGAIN? WHAT IF THIS HAPPENS AGAIN?
[1:29:20] WHAT IF THIS SWELLS UP? WHAT IF THIS
[1:29:22] BREAKS UP? WHAT IF THIS HAPPENS? WHAT IF
[1:29:23] THIS HAPPENS? NO. YOU CAN'T CONTROL THE
[1:29:26] THINGS THAT CAN HAPPEN. BUT YOU CAN
[1:29:27] YIELD YOUR HEART TO GOD THAT SAYS IF IT
[1:29:30] HAPPENS, IT WON'T SCARE YOU ANYMORE.
[1:29:33] And brother Brown's basically saying it
[1:29:35] could have been one or the other, but
[1:29:36] it's the same result.
[1:29:40] He could have said just as well as he
[1:29:41] said the other. So I just embrace it.
[1:29:46] That's why I could say with with the
[1:29:48] caution of the Holy Ghost and the
[1:29:50] balance of the word of God, God, give me
[1:29:52] my feeling back.
[1:29:54] Don't let me shut down when I start
[1:29:56] getting anxious. Don't let me shut down
[1:29:57] when I get overwhelmed. Lord, let me let
[1:29:59] me stand up to it and not be afraid of
[1:30:01] it. and even ask myself, what is this
[1:30:04] pain trying to teach me?
[1:30:07] When I feel this, is it because I've
[1:30:09] offended somebody else?
[1:30:12] When I feel this, is it because the
[1:30:13] spirit is grieved? When I feel this, is
[1:30:16] this because God's trying to signal to
[1:30:17] me it's time for change? What is the
[1:30:20] pain trying to teach me? How is this
[1:30:23] tension trying to lead me?
[1:30:34] I want to close with a statement from
[1:30:35] God has provided a way.
[1:30:38] Sister Elizabeth, you comment
[1:30:46] like to
[1:30:49] really drive this home. It's a little
[1:30:51] bit different
[1:30:53] uh than maybe the channel that we've
[1:30:55] been on, but it speaks to where we can
[1:30:57] we can we can rise from here and just
[1:31:00] put ourselves in that channel of faith
[1:31:02] and say, "Lord, whatever it is, I'm I'm
[1:31:04] I'm going to I'm going to yield myself
[1:31:06] to your glory. I'm going to yield myself
[1:31:08] to your leading. I'm going to yield.
[1:31:10] Thank you, brother. I I'm going to yield
[1:31:11] myself.
[1:31:14] I'm going to learn from this pain.
[1:31:17] It's not your enemy.
[1:31:19] God uses it.
[1:31:22] Brother says in a message, God's
[1:31:24] provided a way. He said, "Now, this is
[1:31:25] the last night of the service.
[1:31:28] I want each one of you to give me your
[1:31:29] undivided attention." And listen, close
[1:31:31] now. We're trying to go in on for the
[1:31:34] greatest victory of the meeting. Now,
[1:31:37] quickly, we have to do this quickly
[1:31:38] because it's [music] in the we're in the
[1:31:39] afternoon. The greatest battle ever
[1:31:42] fought is raging right now. And some of
[1:31:44] us are more in tune to it now than we've
[1:31:45] ever been our whole lives. And we
[1:31:47] recognize [music] this great battle
[1:31:48] that's raging within our minds is we
[1:31:51] were taught and foreworned ahead of
[1:31:52] time. [music] And we've gotten great
[1:31:54] comfort from knowing that. We go back
[1:31:56] and look at greatest battle ever fought.
[1:31:58] It's in the mind. That gives us comfort
[1:31:59] knowing [music] that's exactly where I'm
[1:32:00] fighting. I believe the word. My soul is
[1:32:02] sealed, but I have such terrible mind
[1:32:04] battles. Now, he's using this example
[1:32:06] how that he's had a series of meetings
[1:32:08] and now it's the last night of the meet.
[1:32:10] It's the climax. It's the culmination.
[1:32:13] It's the ending of the meetings. And so
[1:32:15] now he's going in for the greatest
[1:32:16] victory of it. Why? Because it just
[1:32:18] keeps [music] getting goodter and
[1:32:19] goodter and it's going to crescendo.
[1:32:21] It's going to climax. It's going to end
[1:32:22] with the great because this is the last
[1:32:24] night. Usually there's more people
[1:32:25] healed on the last night [music] than
[1:32:27] there is in the rest of the meeting.
[1:32:29] Their great anticipation.
[1:32:32] Think about where we are as the bride
[1:32:35] in this greatest [music] battle ever
[1:32:36] fought. We're nearing the end of this
[1:32:39] battle. We're nearing the end to where
[1:32:42] we are translated. All these meetings
[1:32:45] are going to climax and culminate till
[1:32:46] one day WE HAVE OUR LAST ONE.
[1:32:49] So if this happens in a meeting in 1954,
[1:32:54] then think about what's been building
[1:32:55] through the ages. Think about what's
[1:32:57] been building IN THE CHURCH AND NOW INTO
[1:33:00] THIS BRIDE AGE. HOW THAT THIS THAT OUR
[1:33:02] BRIDE THAT AS A BRIDE, OUR ANTICIPATION
[1:33:04] should be getting greater and greater.
[1:33:09] So he says, "Satan fights harder."
[1:33:12] I hope you can run it on that parallel
[1:33:14] track of where we are today as
[1:33:15] believers. Not just in this meeting, but
[1:33:17] in a parallel track as believers.
[1:33:19] Everything goes wrong seemingly because
[1:33:22] Satan's trying to keep that people in
[1:33:23] tension and everything so that [music]
[1:33:25] he can keep them away from this great
[1:33:27] time of strain that we're now entering
[1:33:30] into
[1:33:32] the strain. And what is it? for the
[1:33:34] great, as we would say, going in for the
[1:33:37] kill. Now,
[1:33:39] [music] that's what we're doing.
[1:33:41] We're going in for the kill. What are
[1:33:43] you killing? The influence of death, the
[1:33:45] sting of death, the power of death.
[1:33:46] We're going in for the kill. We're going
[1:33:48] in for a translation. We're going to put
[1:33:50] death under our feet. We're going in for
[1:33:51] the kill. So, WHAT IS SATAN DOING?
[1:33:52] SATAN'S FIGHTING HARDER THAN HE EVER
[1:33:54] HAS. EVERYTHING SEEMS LIKE IT'S GOING
[1:33:56] WRONG. HE'S TRYING TO PUT US IN TENSION.
[1:33:58] AND BROTHER RAM TELLS US LATER ON,
[1:33:59] TENSION IS A BLESSING. DON'T RUN FROM
[1:34:01] IT. WHY IS THERE TENSION?
[1:34:04] IT'S THE DEVIL FIGHTING AGAINST THE
[1:34:05] GREAT CLIMAX.
[1:34:07] Because we're going IN FOR THE KILL. AND
[1:34:09] THEN I LOVE THIS. Imagine this. This is
[1:34:11] your vanquished foe today. HE'S ALREADY
[1:34:14] BEAT UP IN the corner. He's been exposed
[1:34:17] and ALL OF HIS DEVICES are exposed.
[1:34:20] And men and women have accepted Jesus
[1:34:21] CHRIST AS THEIR SAVIOR. [music] PEOPLE
[1:34:23] WITH CANCER and tumors have everything
[1:34:24] else HAVE BEEN HEALED. DOCTOR STATEMENTS
[1:34:26] proven that it's true. Listen, this is
[1:34:28] the history. This is our This is our
[1:34:30] testimony. This is WHERE WE STAND TODAY.
[1:34:33] WE KNOW WE'VE BEEN SEALED. WE KNOW GOD'S
[1:34:35] A HEALER. WE KNOW THIS WORD IS TRUE. AND
[1:34:38] OUR VANQUISHED FOE IS TRYING TO BRAG,
[1:34:40] TRYING TO BLUFF, TRYING TO FIGHT OUR
[1:34:42] VERY heart against this. And notice he
[1:34:44] says this. Now, here sets a group of
[1:34:46] people here tonight waiting under great
[1:34:48] anticipation. And Satan, if he can
[1:34:51] interrupt your mind, that's all he has
[1:34:54] to do.
[1:34:56] shut it down, turn it off, cover you up,
[1:34:59] overwhelm you, disappoint you, just
[1:35:02] interrupt your mind. THAT'S ALL HE has
[1:35:03] to do. This beat up, bloodied,
[1:35:06] vanquished foe who he says is beaten up
[1:35:08] and sitting over in a corner who's been
[1:35:11] exposed.
[1:35:13] [music] All he's got to, all he can do
[1:35:15] anymore is just play mind games with you
[1:35:18] and try to pretend he's coming after
[1:35:20] you. Don't let him do it. He says, "But
[1:35:23] let's go in now for the great kill just
[1:35:25] now [music]
[1:35:26] to drive Satan and all of his powers
[1:35:29] plum out of the building that God can
[1:35:31] have the right away and heal every sick
[1:35:33] person for the glory of God."
[1:35:36] You're not going to get You're not going
[1:35:37] to get there by saying there is no
[1:35:39] devil. You're not going to get there by
[1:35:41] saying there is [music] no tension
[1:35:42] against my anticipation. You're not
[1:35:44] going to get there unless you begin to
[1:35:45] recognize the pressure is because of
[1:35:47] [music] where I'm going. The pressure is
[1:35:49] because of what I'm CALLED TO. OH GOD,
[1:35:51] DON'T LET IT SHUT ME DOWN AGAIN. I I'll
[1:35:54] I'll speak as a brother to you that I
[1:35:56] know the weight and the feeling OF BEING
[1:35:58] OVERWHELMED TO THE POINT WHERE YOU JUST
[1:36:00] FEEL SHELL SHOCKED AND YOU JUST SIT
[1:36:02] THERE almost seemingly as a scripture
[1:36:04] WORD BE JUST SHOCKED AND DESOLATE,
[1:36:06] unable to move, unable to act, unable to
[1:36:08] do the things you know THAT YOU WOULD
[1:36:10] ENJOY AND THE THINGS THAT WOULD BE A
[1:36:11] BLESSING. AND AND YOU'RE TRYING to flee
[1:36:14] from these things [music] AND THESE
[1:36:15] PAINS THAT BOTHER YOU. AND YOU GET TO A
[1:36:17] SPOT WHERE YOU'RE NUMBED BY IT AND YOU
[1:36:18] CAN'T BE MOVED by someone else's
[1:36:20] feelings. You can't be moved by what
[1:36:21] someone ELSE IS GOING THROUGH. BUT THANK
[1:36:23] GOD WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN HE PULLS
[1:36:25] SOMETHING BACK just a little bit and YOU
[1:36:27] BEGIN TO FEEL AGAIN. AND NOW I WANT TO
[1:36:29] STAND UP BY THE GRACE OF GOD AGAINST THE
[1:36:32] TENSION AND SAY, "HIS GRACE IS GREATER.
[1:36:36] His grace is greater than this.
[1:36:39] And by his grace, I can stand up to it.
[1:36:41] BY HIS GRACE, HE'LL take me through it.
[1:36:43] AND I KNOW I KNOW THOUGH I MAY DREAD
[1:36:45] THESE FEELINGS THAT ARE COMING. GOD HAS
[1:36:48] TAKEN ME BY THE HAND AND SAID TOGETHER
[1:36:50] AARON WE'LL MAKE IT.
[1:36:52] SAY YES LORD I'LL FOLLOW YOU. I'LL JUST
[1:36:55] EMBRACE AND SAY THANK YOU LORD I'LL WALK
[1:36:57] THAT WAY.
[1:36:59] Oh God give us feeling again as a
[1:37:01] congregation. I know we're very new
[1:37:03] coming together but we bring with us our
[1:37:05] past and OUR SCARS AND OUR PRIOR
[1:37:07] EXPERIENCES. And I don't want there to
[1:37:08] BE ANY SUSPICION. I DON'T WANT THERE TO
[1:37:10] BE ANY COMPLEXES. I DON'T WANT THERE TO
[1:37:12] be any calluses. I don't want there TO
[1:37:14] BE ANY DISTANCE. OH GOD, HELP US TO
[1:37:16] BEGIN to heal and to grow. AND IF IT
[1:37:19] MEANS I'VE GOT TO FEEL AGAIN AND PUT
[1:37:21] MYSELF IN POSITION TO BE HURT AGAIN,
[1:37:23] GOD, I'M WILLING TO DO IT FOR THE
[1:37:25] PURPOSE OF DESTINY.
[1:37:28] I'm willing to trust not [music] man but
[1:37:29] you, Lord. Even though men have hurt me
[1:37:31] and things have happened, I'm going to
[1:37:33] trust you because you've got a plan.
[1:37:34] You've got a purpose. And this time, I'm
[1:37:36] going to keep my eyes on you. I'm going
[1:37:38] to follow you.
[1:37:40] And I know I know you'll heal me.
[1:37:44] Let's stand to [music] our feet.
[1:38:00] Let's bow our heads in a word of prayer.
[1:38:09] It's been a [music] lengthy service,
[1:38:11] kind of drawn out and a lot of emphasis
[1:38:14] in different places.
[1:38:18] If we could just bring it to this this
[1:38:21] part right [music] here, it's personal
[1:38:22] between you and the Lord.
[1:38:25] If he's spoken to you in a personal way,
[1:38:29] then just embrace how he's speaking to
[1:38:33] you.
[1:38:36] and let's
[1:38:38] let's get away from our fear.
[1:38:46] Ask God to help us with our hurts.
[1:38:51] Don't be afraid that God would ask you
[1:38:53] to do something that's not [music] going
[1:38:54] to be good for you.
[1:38:56] Don't be afraid that God would subject
[1:38:58] you to
[1:39:03] pain that'll leave you broken.
[1:39:17] But sometimes if we want to have what
[1:39:19] God's asking, we're asking God for,
[1:39:27] we actually have [music] to work through
[1:39:28] something in our own hearts
[1:39:30] to be in a position to receive it.
[1:39:34] Just ask God to give [music] you grace
[1:39:35] today.
[1:39:37] Ask God to help you. Our gracious
[1:39:39] heavenly father,
[1:39:41] it seems
[1:39:44] so hard to close with such a vast
[1:39:46] subject open up before us
[1:39:50] speaking about emotional things and
[1:39:53] feelings of numbness and hurt,
[1:39:56] brokenness.
[1:40:04] [music] I trust Lord that you're dealing
[1:40:06] with the individual's hearts today.
[1:40:09] in a very special way, in [music] a very
[1:40:10] sovereign way. I trust it's a very
[1:40:13] personal way
[1:40:15] because I recognize Lord that as I
[1:40:17] minister there's a
[1:40:19] there's a boundaries on each side.
[1:40:21] There's a ditch as it were on each side
[1:40:22] that I want to be very careful
[1:40:26] circumspect in how I walk this path.
[1:40:29] So Lord, I [music] pray that you take
[1:40:30] these things which have been shared and
[1:40:32] personally reveal it to these
[1:40:33] individuals that are here.
[1:40:36] L Lord, I do not believe that any one of
[1:40:37] us should take a complex and pet it and
[1:40:39] baby it and own it as our identity.
[1:40:44] And certainly, Lord, we should not let
[1:40:45] that complex become [music] our master.
[1:40:51] But Lord, if you never heal it, perhaps
[1:40:52] there's a [music] way you want to use
[1:40:53] it.
[1:40:56] Perhaps there's a tension that'll always
[1:40:57] exist and then we can look at it the
[1:41:00] right way. We'll recognize that it's a
[1:41:01] blessing.
[1:41:04] And Lord, as we've run from [music]
[1:41:06] stress and pressures and anxieties and
[1:41:08] as we've just maintained the status quo
[1:41:10] and we've just gone through the the
[1:41:12] motions and we've just knuckled down and
[1:41:14] just kept doing what we've always been
[1:41:16] doing because we were afraid of [music]
[1:41:17] change,
[1:41:19] maybe we take a deep breath and say,
[1:41:21] "Lord, if you're calling me, if you're
[1:41:22] leading me, Lord, I'll embrace [music]
[1:41:26] where you're taking me." And if if we
[1:41:29] begin to feel tension, ask ourselves
[1:41:30] [music] why. Why? Is it because I need
[1:41:34] to change or because God's changing my
[1:41:35] situation? Lord, why? Why do I feel
[1:41:38] this? What are you doing?
[1:41:41] And Lord, once we begin to feel again, I
[1:41:44] believe you can change us
[1:41:47] and you can help us to change others.
[1:41:51] It's amazing, Lord, how sometimes
[1:41:53] someone else's complexes and [music]
[1:41:55] fears and worries and failures are
[1:41:58] projected onto us
[1:42:01] and we begin to feel like we're wrong
[1:42:03] and we're misled and we're not getting
[1:42:06] what we need. And it's because it's
[1:42:08] being projected on us.
[1:42:12] And if by the courage of the word of God
[1:42:14] and faith, we [music] could stand up to
[1:42:15] that tension,
[1:42:18] maybe God could let us help that person
[1:42:20] who's wrestling
[1:42:22] to overcome their pressure,
[1:42:24] overcome their [music] dissonance,
[1:42:26] overcome their disappointments,
[1:42:29] and we can begin to feel again for
[1:42:31] others.
[1:42:33] That's our desire as a church, Lord,
[1:42:36] is to do your will to live for others.
[1:42:40] So heal us, Lord, so we can be in your
[1:42:42] service. Bless your people. Hearts have
[1:42:44] been lifted up to you and the soberness
[1:42:47] of the moment. I believe that you're
[1:42:48] dealing with people's hearts and I ask
[1:42:49] that you'd heal them. Precious name of
[1:42:52] the Lord Jesus Christ we pray. Amen.
[1:42:54] [music]
