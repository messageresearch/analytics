[0:00] my title today is unshakable and I'm
[0:03] taking it from
[0:04] verse 28 there it says that we receive
[0:06] in a kingdom
[0:07] which cannot be moved and we'll come
[0:10] back to Isaiah chapter four I actually
[0:12] mentioned it a little bit this morning
[0:14] and then come back to it Wednesday night
[0:17] and then maybe in the future just to see
[0:19] the climax of those two kingdoms as
[0:20] we've been building through that but I
[0:23] felt directed to this subject for a
[0:25] couple Services before we went out of
[0:26] town as a way of just just felt to
[0:30] really encourage you and direct you to
[0:32] some things that would be stabilizing
[0:34] and it's also foundational because as we
[0:37] read here in Hebrews chapter 12 there's
[0:39] a lot of things that Paul is looking at
[0:40] and pointing to
[0:42] that are at the time that he's saying it
[0:45] showing the Believers where they then
[0:47] existed at the time but he's also
[0:50] prophesying and seeing something at the
[0:53] outset that's just going to grow and and
[0:55] grow into the body of Christ and so
[0:58] there's a lot there to see and a lot of
[1:00] my inspiration has been coming from the
[1:02] sermon Christ is revealed in his own
[1:05] word so this would be maybe a sermon
[1:07] German that someone some of you may want
[1:10] some direction in terms of something to
[1:12] study or to listen to but this sermon
[1:15] Christ is revealed in his own word has
[1:16] just been full of things that have been
[1:19] inspired and he covers uh quite a bit
[1:21] I'm trying to kind of cover it in just a
[1:23] little bit different way today he makes
[1:25] this statement at the beginning he says
[1:27] now my text this morning is Christ is
[1:30] revealed in his own word
[1:32] now where I come to the conclusion to
[1:34] talk on this was because that knowing
[1:37] that we say we mustn't just say because
[1:40] we gather together to just haphazardly
[1:42] speak on anything I think that's great
[1:44] just because you know you're going to
[1:46] have a captive audience and everyone's
[1:47] going to be there you don't just come
[1:49] and speak on anything but he says that
[1:51] you want to
[1:53] um you know you want to give some
[1:54] thought to it not just be haphazard and
[1:56] then he says but it's something that
[1:58] will help stabilize the people and
[2:01] that's hearkens to the title we have
[2:03] today unshakable something that will
[2:05] help stabilize the people for we're
[2:07] going to pass through dangerous
[2:09] treacherous Waters we're already sailing
[2:12] through them and sometimes I guess it's
[2:14] with you like it is with me that seems
[2:16] like that so much of it is he says it's
[2:19] it's such a scary
[2:20] and I can say that we could say that and
[2:22] fill in the blank it's such a scary
[2:24] there's a lot of things that we go
[2:25] through uh that cause
[2:27] anxiety and that seemed very fearful and
[2:31] brother Brown was saying that has he had
[2:33] this opportunity to come and preach
[2:34] Christ is revealed in his own word uh
[2:37] this is on August 22nd 1965 and he's
[2:40] wanting to minister something that'll
[2:42] stabilize in given a tumultuous time and
[2:45] an unsettling time he wanted to speak
[2:47] something that would bring stability and
[2:49] for the next few uh chapters or those
[2:52] paragraphs there he starts talking about
[2:53] how what a nervous age that we're living
[2:55] in I think he even uses the phrase
[2:56] neurotic and how that there's a wearing
[2:58] down of our minds and our bodies because
[3:00] of the tensions it talks about the
[3:02] hybrid Foods or doing it to our body he
[3:04] says if it doesn't to our body what's it
[3:05] doing to our minds and he talks about
[3:07] just even the tensions how it's wearing
[3:10] down our bodies and our minds so there's
[3:12] a wearing down of emotionally and
[3:14] physically he's called it a nervous age
[3:16] and he's bringing the thought that
[3:18] Christ is revealed in his own word and
[3:21] so given all the chaos that exists in
[3:24] the world today the one thing that's
[3:26] going to bring us safety is cry Christ
[3:28] one thing that's going to bring us
[3:29] stability is Christ and we might in in
[3:32] the face of being wore down physically
[3:34] and being wore down emotionally we might
[3:37] seek things that could prop us up
[3:39] physically prop us up emotionally and
[3:41] find things that can placate us or calm
[3:43] our fears and he's wanting us and he's
[3:45] wanting to stabilize by saying you're
[3:47] going to find the stabilizer in the word
[3:49] I think it's in the absolute he says
[3:51] he's the one that stabilizes and brings
[3:54] the stability and he takes John chapter
[3:56] 1 verse 1 as part of his text he says in
[3:59] the beginning was the word and the Word
[4:01] was with God and the Word was God
[4:04] and he's talking about building a
[4:07] foundation he uses the phrase for
[4:08] Christian Living
[4:09] and the Very foundation for Christian
[4:11] Living is is Christ the word and he's
[4:15] mentioned how if you're going to have a
[4:17] Christian Life you have to have an
[4:18] ultimate and for some people the
[4:20] ultimate is their church or the ultimate
[4:22] is their denomination or particular
[4:24] Doctrine but he's building the
[4:25] foundation for Christian Living as the
[4:27] ultimate of God's word
[4:30] given the instability and given
[4:32] uncertainty we need an absolute we need
[4:35] we need something that's sure something
[4:37] that's not changing and he says we
[4:39] Christ is that and you'll find him
[4:41] revealed in his own word
[4:44] and he makes this statement
[4:46] I just uh I'm wanting to read these so
[4:48] you could see that in in an age of
[4:51] nervous tension in an age where the
[4:53] foods are killing us and the pressures
[4:55] are killing us it's not just a change of
[4:57] diet it's going to give you life
[4:59] it's not just a vacation that's going to
[5:01] give you life but he's saying there's
[5:02] one thing one thing where you're going
[5:04] to find your stability he says today so
[5:07] confused about the evidence of the Holy
[5:09] Ghost and so forth
[5:10] Satan can impersonate any kind of gift
[5:13] that God has got now that's quite a
[5:16] statement
[5:17] Satan can impersonate any gift that God
[5:19] has but he cannot bring that word word
[5:22] by word
[5:24] it's uh it's an impossibility for Satan
[5:27] to stay on track long enough to get it
[5:29] right and so if it starts out just give
[5:32] him enough time he's going to vary
[5:33] because he can't do it word by word he
[5:37] said that's where he failed in the
[5:38] Garden of Eden that's where he's always
[5:40] failed a lot of this is fresh in our
[5:42] minds the things we've examined he said
[5:44] that's where the tape on false anointed
[5:46] ones or anointed ones and this is quite
[5:49] a statement they can be Anointed with
[5:51] the spirit that's a capital s
[5:53] speak in tongues dance shout preach the
[5:56] gospel instill a devil
[5:58] now that's quite a statement and I don't
[6:01] believe that brother Branham just always
[6:02] emphasized that but it's kind of used as
[6:04] one of those wake up if we were doing it
[6:06] today it would be in all caps and said
[6:08] you won't believe what the prophet had
[6:09] to say about this right and we would
[6:12] click it and we'd want to know well what
[6:13] did he have to say about it that you
[6:16] could manifest these gifts or these
[6:18] outward emotions of tongues dancing
[6:20] shouting he even preach he says he says
[6:22] it's still a devil in other words it's
[6:24] not an a true genuine anointed one still
[6:27] of the devil or not right and that's
[6:29] quite a statement
[6:31] and what is he I believe his emphasis
[6:34] isn't so that every time we see someone
[6:35] speaking with tongues like Devil right
[6:37] anytime someone dances we say devil
[6:39] because then you'd be wrong
[6:40] but that we wouldn't be taking our
[6:42] comfort from the fact that we preach
[6:44] wouldn't be taking our security from the
[6:46] fact that we can dance or shout or speak
[6:48] in tongues but that we we find our rest
[6:51] solely in Faith's only resting place and
[6:54] that's the word of God
[6:56] again he says this and these things are
[6:58] just right here at the outset of him
[7:00] preaching Christ is revealed in his own
[7:02] word he says you can be anointed out
[7:03] here in this spirit and desire and do
[7:06] all these other things
[7:08] but when it comes to this type post to
[7:10] that word you'll never move from there
[7:13] and that could be said of you could be
[7:16] anointed in your spirit to shout or to
[7:17] dance and you can even be anointed to
[7:19] shout and dance in your spirit by some
[7:22] wrong Spirit where you're shouting the
[7:23] wrong things and dancing to the wrong
[7:25] thing so look those are things that
[7:26] exist within that spiritual and Physical
[7:28] Realm and the spirit can be anointed to
[7:30] do these things but when it comes to the
[7:32] typos to that word you'll never move
[7:34] from there and that that's got to be in
[7:36] that Soul Realm
[7:38] it'll hold right steady and true to that
[7:40] word as it can be
[7:42] outside of that regardless of what you
[7:45] do you're still lost so unless the soul
[7:47] has anchored in the word of God unless
[7:50] there's been life brought forth by the
[7:52] new birth you're still in a state of uh
[7:55] subject to punishment
[7:57] subject to missing the Rapture and then
[7:59] he says the laodicean church Age naked
[8:01] blind miserable don't even know it
[8:03] it's that anointed and he says Anointed
[8:06] with the real spirit
[8:08] that Holy Spirit can fall upon a man in
[8:10] his Spirit but his soul is his germ that
[8:13] germ is the word
[8:15] that's where that's where you want it to
[8:17] come from I don't care how much you can
[8:19] preach how well you do this and how much
[8:21] you love that's one of the inlets to the
[8:23] spirit you can't love with your body you
[8:25] love with your spirit that's one of the
[8:27] inlets and you can love and even love
[8:29] God and still not be right you can cast
[8:31] out devils and preach and do these
[8:33] things and still not be right as I read
[8:37] this a lot of times you hear preachers
[8:38] preach against this dancing the shouting
[8:40] speaking in tongues and all that but
[8:41] they always miss the part about you can
[8:43] preach too buddy
[8:45] and still not be with it but but I'm
[8:47] brave enough to read this
[8:50] he says you can cast out devils and
[8:52] preach and do these things still not be
[8:54] right Jesus said so said many would come
[8:56] in that day says that word settles it
[8:59] so we're not deriving our anchor isn't
[9:01] well I can preach and well I can shout I
[9:04] can dance I can I can do all these
[9:06] different things and he's pointing to
[9:07] the scripture where Jesus says many will
[9:10] come to me in that day and profess to
[9:13] have done many wonderful things in his
[9:15] name
[9:16] so it's not that they were practicing a
[9:18] witchcraft or sorcery but they spoke
[9:20] with tongues they laid hands on the sick
[9:22] they cast out devils in his name and and
[9:25] there's this uh emphasis to say well
[9:27] that's great but Jesus in that moment
[9:30] says I never knew you
[9:31] so there's a there's a knowledge that
[9:33] must come by the new birth in our soul
[9:35] where the germ of God which is in your
[9:37] soul is quickened to life and and God
[9:40] help us that we wouldn't be a seed of
[9:43] God who is so attracted to the physical
[9:46] and the spiritual that we never have a
[9:48] face-to-face meeting with God to be
[9:50] birthed from the inside
[9:52] and because there is brother Branham
[9:53] says that if if the devil can't get you
[9:55] out on the smoking and the drinking and
[9:57] the partying he can get you out on the
[9:59] religious limb but what we what we're
[10:01] encouraging uh often reminding you of is
[10:04] that there is a new birth to be
[10:05] quickened again by the holy spirit of
[10:07] God in your soul realm and there is
[10:10] where your soul find finds rest and if
[10:13] your soul can be anchored if your soul
[10:14] can find rest in the word of God oh what
[10:17] a wonder it does for the body and the
[10:19] spirit it's even according to that life
[10:21] which is in the soul you can cause your
[10:23] emotions and cause your body to come
[10:24] subject to the word that is in your
[10:27] spirit
[10:28] now the other scripture that brother
[10:31] Bradham takes as his text in the sermon
[10:34] of Christ is revealed in his own word is
[10:36] Hebrews chapter 1.
[10:38] verses one to four and if you don't mind
[10:41] even in the presence of the Hebrew
[10:43] scholar I'm going to take a few pages
[10:45] from the book of Hebrews uh and ex
[10:48] expound upon it a little bit
[10:50] foundationally but to come to this point
[10:52] of how that you are to be unshakable
[10:55] we want to be unshakable especially
[10:57] given so many things passing through
[10:59] treacherous Waters and uh and I even I
[11:02] guess it's good for me to kind of
[11:04] exercise this one of the things that
[11:06] caught my attention is the very things
[11:08] that we might feel that we would have
[11:11] the right to lean into a little bit and
[11:13] be comforted by dancing shouting praise
[11:16] and rejoicing speaking with tongues like
[11:17] these are gifts of the Spirit a genuine
[11:20] anointing the very things that we might
[11:22] feel like wow at least that's going to
[11:24] purge me that's going to make me feel
[11:26] good that's going to lift me up brother
[11:27] branham's even in a way saying hold on
[11:31] that doesn't settle it
[11:33] and maybe that's a little unsettling
[11:36] maybe that's a little well that seems
[11:38] kind of counter counterproductive that
[11:40] seems to be kind of counter scripture
[11:42] but he's wanting to be sure that at the
[11:43] end of the day you're rooted in the word
[11:45] of God and you're and your foundation so
[11:47] he takes this from Hebrews chapter one
[11:49] and you read verses one to four he says
[11:51] God and Paul now beginning this book
[11:54] is coming right out front and telling us
[11:59] what his whole purpose of this letter is
[12:01] God who at sundry times in diverse
[12:02] manners spake in time pass unto the
[12:05] fathers by the prophet so this would be
[12:07] uh the Jews
[12:11] their faith their conviction that when
[12:13] God wanted to speak to them the law was
[12:15] given to them by Moses a prophet that
[12:18] the prophets came and spoke words and
[12:20] spoke words of judgment and gave
[12:21] prophecy of even Restorations and these
[12:23] different movements and things he says
[12:25] that God in the past when he wanted to
[12:27] talk to us he talked to our fathers by
[12:29] the prophets and right off the bat he's
[12:31] saying but now the prophets have ceased
[12:34] because all the prophets foreshadowed
[12:37] the coming of the Messiah he says hath
[12:39] in these last days spoken unto us by his
[12:42] son so now he's saying this belief that
[12:44] we thought a messiah would come is
[12:46] fulfilled he has spoken unto us by his
[12:49] son whom he hath appointed heir of All
[12:51] Things by whom also he made the worlds
[12:54] who being the brightness of his glory in
[12:57] the express image of his person and
[12:59] upholding All Things by the word of his
[13:01] power
[13:02] when he hath purged he had by himself
[13:06] purged our sins that's a remarkable
[13:08] statement to Jews who solve the the
[13:10] sacrifices of bulls and goats
[13:13] in Rams as a shedding of blood to one uh
[13:17] to cover sins once a year and even in
[13:19] that
[13:20] uh that one offering says he has by
[13:23] himself purged our sins
[13:26] sat down on the right hand of the
[13:29] Majesty on high I believe we used this
[13:31] in the first part on the kingdom how
[13:33] that this is the the Messiah as the King
[13:35] this is this is elements of the Kingdom
[13:39] now if you could just for a moment just
[13:41] draw on your prior experience and things
[13:44] that you've heard and things that you've
[13:45] been taught
[13:46] and how that we know that brother
[13:48] Branham says he preached the same gospel
[13:50] Paul preached
[13:51] and that's a significant statement and
[13:54] it's given in the context of uh we're
[13:57] resting on that you know that will Paul
[13:59] be judged and he says well I preached
[14:00] the same gospel Paul preached and we
[14:03] know that uh brother teaches in the
[14:07] in the um Church age book that the word
[14:09] was perfectly given and perfectly
[14:10] understood by Paul and that just as Paul
[14:14] uh was given the word in that day that
[14:16] again in the last days it'll be the word
[14:18] again as Paul had it
[14:21] and with that in mind it's good just to
[14:23] think well this is what Paul taught
[14:24] these are the teachings of Paul brother
[14:26] Branham did say that Paul's Revelation
[14:28] then was prophecy for today so you can
[14:31] preach the same gospel but you can also
[14:34] be fulfilling the gospel and bringing it
[14:37] out in the manifestation that Paul saw
[14:38] it coming in
[14:40] and I mentioned this before and I just
[14:41] wanted to take a few moments this
[14:43] morning
[14:44] to based upon these very scriptures how
[14:47] that God at one time spoke by prophets
[14:48] but now he speaks by his son
[14:51] and and and to consider Paul's faith
[14:54] that we have Paul's gospel I preached
[14:56] the same gospel Paul preached the word
[14:57] as perfectly understood and perfectly
[14:59] given to Paul Paul's Faith as we think
[15:02] about it and even his conversion was not
[15:05] a conversion to a new religion and I
[15:08] know when we think conversion and Jesus
[15:09] says when thou art converted
[15:10] strengthened thy Brethren that now when
[15:12] we think of someone being converted we
[15:14] think of them coming out of sin and a
[15:17] world of maybe drug use and devil
[15:19] worship or maybe someone who's agnostic
[15:20] or an atheist and then the gospels
[15:22] preach to them in this prior belief
[15:24] system that they had about the world or
[15:26] this Paradigm that they saw in the world
[15:28] has completely changed and we say
[15:30] someone is converted maybe when if
[15:32] they're Muslim and they convert to
[15:34] Christianity that's that's how we see
[15:36] from a false Faith to a true faith if
[15:39] you were to witness and maybe there's
[15:40] someone who's formerly was Catholic and
[15:43] they come to the message and say well
[15:44] they were converted from Catholicism to
[15:46] the message maybe someone who's a Mormon
[15:48] and they're convert uh to uh
[15:50] Christianity there's this idea of what a
[15:52] conversion is is maybe an abandonment
[15:55] from a prior belief system and the
[15:58] leaving of a faith into a new faith but
[16:02] Paul's religion Paul's conversion is not
[16:04] that
[16:06] and one thing to take note here as we're
[16:08] leading this has been kind of I don't
[16:10] know why it takes me so long sometimes
[16:12] to get there but Paul's religion wasn't
[16:15] an institution that they visited it
[16:18] wasn't embodied in the temple or the
[16:20] Tabernacle or the history of the
[16:22] Tabernacle or the existence of the
[16:24] temple those were elements of it but
[16:25] Paul's religion was in everyday life
[16:28] there was no separation of it in a in a
[16:31] church building there was no separation
[16:33] of it uh separation in his everyday life
[16:35] for worship or faith and that's quite a
[16:38] statement for us uh at least in North
[16:41] America where church and religion has
[16:44] always seemed to kind of find a place
[16:46] and as time has moved on Christianity is
[16:50] less about our everyday lives and more
[16:52] of a hobby or a recreation something
[16:55] that's in addition to it but to a Jew
[16:57] their life was their religion their
[17:01] everyday life everything they thought
[17:03] everything they ate everything they wore
[17:05] the way that they lived and even as the
[17:07] scripture is telling them to bind
[17:08] certain things and keep the word always
[17:10] before them and they had a language that
[17:12] they used that to speak of promises and
[17:14] a coming Messiah and they all looked
[17:16] forward to one day when there would be
[17:17] this Kingdom set up on Earth and all the
[17:20] Gentiles would come to their light and
[17:22] so they didn't have a separate place for
[17:25] their faith they didn't have a separate
[17:27] place for their worship their lives were
[17:29] that
[17:29] it was their everyday life
[17:31] and as Christianity has declined in
[17:34] North America
[17:36] it's very interesting that it's not just
[17:38] scandals in the church that's causing
[17:40] the decline
[17:42] of Christianity though that is a part of
[17:44] it but the majority of people are no
[17:46] longer attending church and no longer
[17:48] participating in worship and church
[17:51] functions not because of the scandals
[17:54] but because it just doesn't fit into
[17:55] their lifestyles
[17:58] that light it's not conducive to their
[18:00] lifestyle that it doesn't fit in with
[18:01] their with their travel schedules with
[18:03] their Recreation schedules with their
[18:05] hobbies and where it's just not
[18:07] convenient anymore and two and to a Jew
[18:10] they're Christian their faith or their
[18:13] belief wasn't contingent and tied only
[18:15] to going returning to Jerusalem a few
[18:17] times a year it was embedded in their
[18:20] everyday life
[18:21] and let us not be those who are
[18:23] maintaining the vestiges of church going
[18:25] uh because we can still traditionally
[18:28] attend service a couple times a week but
[18:30] let's be sure that our lifestyles have
[18:33] have kept a place where Christ is
[18:36] present in our everyday lives and so
[18:38] that we're not still Christians and
[18:40] we're still church goers because we've
[18:42] been able to carve out a little bit of
[18:43] time twice a week but rather our lives
[18:46] are defined it's called brother I said
[18:47] Christian Living must have an ultimate
[18:49] we found that Bedrock we found that
[18:52] ultimate and therefore there's you
[18:54] cannot separate me from this religion
[18:56] because my life is this quote unquote
[18:59] religion
[19:01] when Paul was converted they're on the
[19:03] Damascus Road and I know it's often
[19:05] referred to as that Damascus Road
[19:07] conversion and as he tells about it in
[19:10] different places in the book of Acts
[19:11] when he meets this Pillar of Fire and
[19:14] and he asks and brother Branham does a
[19:17] tremendous job of identifying how that
[19:19] Paul says who art thou Lord
[19:21] and it wasn't Rabbi or Master but it's
[19:25] translated to capital L that he's
[19:27] recognizing well this is the one
[19:30] this is the one we worship this is the
[19:33] one that the Jews reverence and he said
[19:35] I am Jesus and I believe it's in chapter
[19:37] 21 he says Jesus of Nazareth I am Jesus
[19:40] whom now persecutes
[19:42] and this becomes this this converting
[19:45] point
[19:46] for Paul
[19:47] as he tells the story when he tells his
[19:49] conversion this is where he begins and
[19:51] that word conversion just it means a
[19:53] returning or coming back too
[19:56] now when we say conversion we think
[19:59] turning away from sin turning away from
[20:01] false religion turning away from the
[20:03] things of the world and and and to God
[20:05] but now to Paul
[20:07] and as it's used in different places in
[20:10] the conversion it's a returning or
[20:11] turning back again
[20:13] and now for Paul it's almost as if
[20:15] wherever they began in the Promises by
[20:17] virtue of their traditions and their
[20:19] ideas and their Concepts they had gotten
[20:22] so far away from who the Messiah was
[20:24] going to be that when he came They
[20:25] Crucified him but now he turns
[20:29] and he comes back to the real heart of
[20:31] it it's a it's to he's turning now in
[20:34] that moment he's had this belief and
[20:36] conviction all along that there'd be a
[20:37] messiah but now he comes to the truth of
[20:39] it
[20:40] as the Bible even says nevertheless when
[20:42] it shall turn to the Lord that's the
[20:44] same word used for conversion or when
[20:46] thou art converted he says the veil
[20:47] shall be taken away and when Paul then
[20:50] is converted he's turning to the word
[20:53] presently
[20:54] he's fighting this and for him if I
[20:57] could put it this way
[20:59] Paul then Paul's faith when he's
[21:01] converted he's not converted to a New
[21:03] Faith you follow me that far and I think
[21:05] this is very critical to understanding
[21:06] the message of the hour that Paul is not
[21:09] converted to a New Faith but it was a
[21:12] fulfillment of his faith
[21:15] it's what God had been leading to from
[21:17] the moment that he said Abram get thee
[21:19] out like this is this is it and this is
[21:22] what Paul recognized is wow this isn't
[21:25] new religion this isn't a a a new belief
[21:29] system he was not denying the one true
[21:31] God he wasn't forsaken all the prophets
[21:33] as false and condemning everything that
[21:35] had been before Paul's message then in
[21:37] essence was that guys God fulfilled that
[21:41] what he said he would do
[21:43] you believe the prophets that's great
[21:44] you've got to believe the prophets
[21:46] because otherwise you won't believe who
[21:47] Christ is so it wasn't rejecting the
[21:50] Jewish faith it wasn't a turning over of
[21:52] Judaism into something new and denying
[21:55] the one true God and changing who
[21:57] created the heavens and the Earth and
[21:58] redefining uh the the the fabric of
[22:01] their religion he's saying this is what
[22:02] it all pointed to
[22:04] his conversion uh was was to the truth
[22:08] and the reality of what the faith was
[22:11] pointing to
[22:12] so Paul did not leave the Jewish
[22:14] religion but he advocated that Christ
[22:15] was the Fulfillment of it
[22:18] now if you could use that in type of how
[22:20] the message of the hour
[22:22] is not a rejection of Christianity
[22:25] it's not a complete tearing down to the
[22:27] principles of the Bible and picking
[22:29] apart uh uh things that people had
[22:31] believed before and all the prior
[22:33] expectations and ways of worship it's
[22:36] saying everything that the Christian
[22:38] church has been looking for we're living
[22:40] in the time in the hour where God is
[22:42] fulfilling what he's promised to do to
[22:45] the Gentiles
[22:46] so it's not it's not something new and
[22:48] different in the sense that oh we're
[22:50] completely repudiating what's been but
[22:53] we can say this message is what you're
[22:55] looking for
[22:56] this Christ whom you claim to believe
[22:58] this Messiah you claim to be looking for
[23:00] and desire to see this word is who
[23:04] reveals him
[23:06] so when he was writing in the book of
[23:07] Hebrews and he's writing this letter
[23:10] he's saying and he's taking chapter by
[23:13] chapter elements of the Old Testament
[23:15] elements of their worship and their
[23:17] faith and their belief and he's saying
[23:18] the law is not the ultimate
[23:21] the temple is not the ultimate the
[23:24] priesthood's not the ultimate and he
[23:26] takes each element of the law and maybe
[23:29] not each but he takes elements of the
[23:30] law elements of Temple worship elements
[23:32] of the priesthood and he takes all these
[23:34] things and he starts identifying how
[23:36] that Christ fulfills all that they typed
[23:40] Christ is the Fulfillment of it Christ
[23:42] is uh is what all these things pointed
[23:45] to as they were a shadow of it
[23:47] so then in Revelation excuse me Hebrews
[23:50] chapter 12.
[23:52] Hebrews chapter 12 verses 1 and 2.
[24:00] I hope that you're comfortable this
[24:02] morning
[24:04] and uh
[24:05] if for some reason you're not we'll just
[24:07] blame it on the song leader
[24:11] in Hebrews chapter 12 verses 1 and 2 he
[24:14] says wherefore seeing this now this is
[24:16] we're coming to the very end there's one
[24:18] more chapter chapter 13. uh and it's uh
[24:21] kind of his final warnings and and uh
[24:24] encouragements to the church
[24:26] and as he has gone through
[24:28] establishing Christ as the Messiah
[24:31] and then all these elements in these
[24:33] other chapters
[24:34] he says we're foreseen we also are
[24:36] compassed about with so great a cloud of
[24:38] witnesses
[24:39] what I was looking at in this sense
[24:42] everything Paul was sharing was a
[24:45] witness
[24:46] all the foreshadowing all these types
[24:48] Sins that were compassed about with all
[24:51] these shadows and types and Christ is
[24:53] the perfect fulfillment of it seeing
[24:55] that we have this
[24:57] now it becomes incumbent upon us let us
[25:01] lay aside every weight and these sin
[25:03] which doth so easily beset us and let us
[25:06] run with patience the race that is set
[25:08] before us
[25:10] Paul recognizing that there is some
[25:11] Journey there's some Continuum even as
[25:14] much as they believed even in the
[25:16] immediacy of the returning of the
[25:17] Messiah that these are the last days and
[25:19] the latter times he saw that there was
[25:21] prophecy to be fulfilled things to take
[25:24] place it says the race which is set
[25:26] before us looking unto Jesus
[25:29] not quite quite a statement now if you
[25:32] take someone who's just been newly
[25:33] acquainted with the Messiah and Jesus of
[25:35] Nazareth is that Messiah and now their
[25:37] their whole Paradigm is being changed
[25:39] their language is being is being changed
[25:41] and now I'm not looking and waiting for
[25:43] the Messiah to come I'm now looking to
[25:45] the Messiah who has come looking unto
[25:48] Jesus who is now the author the beginner
[25:50] and the Perfecter or finisher of our
[25:53] faith who for the joy that was set
[25:55] before him endured the cross despising
[25:57] the shame and is set down at the right
[26:00] hand of the Throne of God that's when he
[26:02] opens the chapter with as how that he is
[26:04] set down at the right hand of the
[26:05] Majesty on high who by himself has
[26:08] purged our sins so he returns right back
[26:11] now he's gone full circle from Hebrews
[26:13] chapter 1 to Hebrews chapter 12 he's
[26:17] he's kind of closed the loop in some
[26:18] ways to say now that's I've set this
[26:21] forth Jesus Christ is the Messiah he is
[26:25] the Fulfillment of your faith he is the
[26:28] the long-awaited Messiah and King that
[26:31] the Jews have longed for and that have
[26:32] looked for
[26:34] as he continues it through the next
[26:35] verses 12 to 17 he admonishes them to
[26:38] continue to endure correction so these
[26:40] are the elements of going forward that
[26:42] now that you've looking unto Jesus the
[26:44] author and finish of our faith that
[26:45] there's a correction that takes place
[26:47] and there's a there's a shaping and
[26:49] there's a teaching he's telling to look
[26:50] diligently stay on guard lest ye fail
[26:53] and uh and he's inspiring them to be
[26:56] perseverant
[26:58] and he arrives at this
[27:01] Hebrews in Hebrews chapter 12 we'll
[27:03] start with Verse 18 because this is our
[27:04] text that we took
[27:07] and I'm very happy with the the pacing
[27:10] today and just your expectation
[27:12] and uh and I know that you're listening
[27:14] very very intently and it's very good
[27:16] for me I commend you on your on your
[27:18] attentiveness
[27:20] and because I'm just it's to me it's
[27:22] just very uh very structured today and
[27:25] very simple
[27:27] so now he comes to this and I feel at
[27:30] this point is he's tried to encourage
[27:31] them says now Christ we're looking at
[27:34] Jesus the author and finisher of our
[27:36] faith now he's saying this is how we go
[27:39] forward
[27:40] this is this is his final uh words to in
[27:43] this Hebrew letter in his closing words
[27:45] as he exhorts them
[27:47] I says for ye are not come
[27:50] and and what a way to hearken back to
[27:53] everything he's just rehearsed to them
[27:55] for a year not coming to the mount that
[27:57] might be touched
[27:59] and that burned with fires using an
[28:01] incredible language here the mount that
[28:03] might be touched in other words that
[28:04] could be touched a physical Mountain
[28:06] Mount Sinai was a physical Mountain that
[28:08] could be touched but yet when we come to
[28:10] Exodus chapter 19 he says God says don't
[28:12] touch it so when he says it might be
[28:14] touched it's the to bring into view the
[28:16] physical Mountain so you are not come to
[28:18] that the mountain that might be touched
[28:20] and that burned with fire
[28:22] and nor unto Blackness and darkness and
[28:25] Tempest
[28:26] it's important to catch this year and
[28:28] not come unto a mountain that can be
[28:30] touched and that burned with fire those
[28:32] are characteristics but then he says you
[28:34] are not come unto blackness
[28:36] you have not come under Darkness you
[28:38] have not come unto tempt us
[28:41] verse 19 and the sound of a trumpet and
[28:43] the voice of words these are all ways of
[28:45] describing Mount Sinai and he narrows it
[28:48] down even further lest there be any
[28:50] ambiguity as to what he was referring to
[28:51] which voice they that heard entreated
[28:53] that the word should not be spoken to
[28:55] them anymore remember how in Exodus 19
[28:58] that when God spoke the children was
[29:00] like whoa let's don't do that again
[29:03] just Moses you just tell us what God has
[29:06] to say and we'll believe you right yet
[29:09] this is what they didn't want to hear
[29:10] the voice of God anymore they were
[29:12] frightened by it and and Paul says this
[29:15] drawing from
[29:16] uh the scripture for they could not
[29:18] endure that which was commanded
[29:21] and if so much as Beast touch the
[29:23] mountain it shall be stoned or thrust
[29:25] through with the dart
[29:26] and so terrible was the sight that Moses
[29:28] said I exceedingly fear and Quake
[29:32] there's a lot of scriptures I'd like to
[29:34] bring into this view as Paul is using it
[29:36] in Exodus 19 and 20. a lot of the
[29:40] descriptions that take place on the
[29:41] mount over those days
[29:43] that Paul is taking and distinguishing
[29:45] between the spiritual Mount Zion
[29:49] and the physical Mount Sinai that we can
[29:52] read about in Exodus 19 and 20. there's
[29:54] these this physical Mountain that
[29:56] existed in The Exodus Paul was saying
[29:58] you didn't come to Mount Sinai
[30:00] and as we'll go as we continue in the
[30:03] next verses he's saying this is not the
[30:05] mountain you came to you came to Mount
[30:07] Zion
[30:08] now Mount Sinai is no little mountain
[30:11] for him to say you haven't come uh uh to
[30:14] Mount Sinai it's not like him saying hey
[30:16] you haven't come to Camelback Mountain
[30:17] and someone's like yeah I don't prefer
[30:19] it anyways I like South Mountain right
[30:21] it's not just throwing something out
[30:24] there uh uh uh some of us might prefer
[30:26] Mount Lemon so shout out to Tucson that
[30:29] it's it's not it's not just some kind of
[30:31] recreation spot well when I go on
[30:34] vacations I prefer you know the real the
[30:36] real pastors they they climb Mount
[30:37] Rainier and we have some sort of
[30:40] competition about mountains but to say
[30:42] Mount Sinai this is the beginning of all
[30:45] of it
[30:46] as God had called them out of bondage
[30:48] and prophesied that they would be in
[30:50] this Exodus and they would return uh to
[30:52] the promised land before they entered
[30:54] the promised land actually The Exodus
[30:56] begins with God revealing himself to
[30:59] Moses on this mountain
[31:01] in Exodus chapter 3 God reveals himself
[31:03] to Moses in the burning bush on this
[31:05] mountain and it Mount Sinai then becomes
[31:07] associated with God revealing himself
[31:11] where some form or Visage of God some
[31:13] expression that God was hiding himself
[31:15] behind makes himself known to the
[31:17] prophet and The Exodus is kicked off by
[31:20] the Lord himself coming down and
[31:22] identified himself in a in a burning
[31:25] bush on a Mountaintop and says I come
[31:28] down and I'm going to send you so the
[31:30] very Deliverance begins on this mountain
[31:33] and he says when you bring them out
[31:35] return back here so it was a place that
[31:37] they came back to it's called the Mount
[31:39] of God
[31:41] it's a place where the Ten Commandments
[31:43] are given
[31:44] Mount Sinai is where the law began
[31:49] it's where they're even the law
[31:50] beginning and where they're coming to
[31:52] the understanding that I the Lord uh
[31:54] will raise up prophets and I'll raise up
[31:56] a prophet like and unto me and it's all
[31:58] it's all happening around this time and
[32:01] associated with this uh this this
[32:03] mountain Mount Sinai it's even here that
[32:07] God for the first time ever begins to
[32:08] speak of a kingdom that he wants to
[32:10] establish
[32:11] in Exodus 19 5-6 now therefore if you
[32:14] will obey my voice indeed and keep my
[32:16] Covenant
[32:17] then ye shall be a peculiar treasure
[32:19] unto me above all people
[32:21] it says where it begins
[32:23] if you will obey my voice and keep my
[32:25] Covenant I like thinking about that in
[32:28] terms of his voice
[32:30] it establishes the Covenant and he says
[32:34] if you'll keep my Covenant
[32:36] says you'll be a peculiar treasure unto
[32:38] me above all people
[32:40] and then there is a covenant that he
[32:42] keeps
[32:44] that his voice establishes
[32:46] he says you will be a peculiar treasure
[32:48] unto me above all people for all the
[32:49] Earth is mine and it tells us something
[32:52] I made the Earth there's a treasure hid
[32:55] in it
[32:56] and if you'll keep my obey my voice and
[32:58] keep my Covenant then you'll be that
[33:00] treasure that is in the earth that I
[33:02] that is mine and you will raise up out
[33:05] of the earth as notice this you shall be
[33:07] unto me a kingdom
[33:08] you'll be the kingdom that splits up out
[33:11] of the earth you'll be the kingdom that
[33:12] rises up from the from the dust and the
[33:14] ashes you'll be the one that emerges ye
[33:16] shall be unto me a kingdom of priest and
[33:18] a holy nation first time that God uses
[33:20] the phrasing
[33:21] you will be unto me you will be my
[33:24] kingdom
[33:25] you will be priest in the holy nation
[33:27] these are the words which Thou shalt
[33:29] speak unto the children of Israel
[33:31] so Moses is going to bring this message
[33:33] from Mount Sina this is the beginning of
[33:35] the Kingdom this is where they begin to
[33:37] hold in their minds that there's not
[33:39] just going to be a a land that is being
[33:42] returned to them we're not going back to
[33:44] the way that it was uh with our father
[33:46] uh Abraham but we're going we're going
[33:48] to go back and know that God's going to
[33:50] raise us up that God is going to
[33:53] establish us that God is going to send a
[33:54] messiah we're going to be a holy nation
[33:57] we're going to be blessed above all
[33:58] people over the face of the Earth and
[34:00] we're going to be a kingdom of priest a
[34:02] holy nation
[34:04] and then he tells them that's not the
[34:06] mountain you came to
[34:07] you we have not as he says now we have
[34:10] not come to Mount Sinai but verse 22 but
[34:13] you're coming to Mount Zion
[34:15] now there's so much that I hope stirring
[34:18] up within your hearts and I want you to
[34:20] think about this there is going to be a
[34:22] Mount Zion Showdown for the bride there
[34:25] was a Mount Carmel Showdown about
[34:27] Transfiguration Showdown and there will
[34:29] be a Mount Zion Showdown and what did
[34:31] Brother Ram say Jesus Will Be The
[34:33] Showdown in the Mount Zion Showdown
[34:36] he'll be the showdown between the bride
[34:38] and the denominations between the
[34:39] kingdom of God and all the worldly
[34:40] kingdoms
[34:42] between organized religion and the truth
[34:44] so we have come unto Mount Zion and
[34:47] under the city of the Living God the
[34:49] heavenly Jerusalem
[34:51] and to an innumerable company of angels
[34:54] oh what a language we could begin to use
[34:56] so many scriptures that can begin to
[34:58] take out of the Bible that Paul is
[35:00] saying you've come unto Mount Zion the
[35:02] city of the Living God the heavenly
[35:04] Jerusalem you've come to it
[35:06] now what Paul said is here and I know
[35:09] that
[35:09] I could say it quickly without having to
[35:11] go into the scriptures
[35:12] Paul is saying that you've come to the
[35:14] Heavenly Jerusalem
[35:15] Paul sees it as it's beginning John in
[35:18] Revelation 21 has seen it in its end
[35:21] because we see the Heavenly Jerusalem we
[35:23] see these things the city of God coming
[35:24] out of heaven
[35:25] and the City of the Living God the
[35:27] heavenly Jerusalem he's Mount Zion then
[35:29] is the dwelling place of God
[35:31] it is God's habitation if I could say
[35:34] this I know it's self-serving to the the
[35:36] series but it's the spiritual kingdom of
[35:38] God
[35:39] you have not come to Mount Sinai you've
[35:42] come to the kingdom
[35:44] you've come to the city of the Living
[35:46] God the heavenly Jerusalem Mount Sinai
[35:49] was in the wilderness
[35:51] Mount Sinai was not in Israel was not in
[35:56] the promised land it's actually
[35:57] connected with Egypt it's uh it's tied
[35:59] uh to Egypt it was a temporary stop in
[36:03] The Exodus
[36:05] it was not their final destiny as a
[36:07] matter of fact when God begins to speak
[36:09] in Exodus 19 about in The Exodus he says
[36:11] he talks about how I have brought you
[36:13] out of Egypt On Eagle's Wings
[36:15] and he's showing that we're coming out
[36:17] and now the stopping point before on
[36:20] Mount Sinai where the law was given in
[36:22] the wilderness before we enter in that's
[36:24] where cyanide is it's not even in the
[36:26] Promised Land
[36:28] it was just a it was pointing to the
[36:30] promised land it's not in the adoption
[36:32] it's not in in all the things that
[36:34] pertain to the Eternal Kingdom it was a
[36:36] stopping point on the way so it wasn't
[36:38] the final destiny
[36:41] so when he says Mount Zion he's he's
[36:43] bringing up before the Jews and again
[36:44] it's not like
[36:46] he said Mount Zion and
[36:48] and it's uh you know something foreign
[36:51] to them you have not come to Mount Sinai
[36:53] but you've come to mount Denali this
[36:55] where's that right I mean what is that
[36:59] where is it but he refers to something
[37:01] that was sacred to them
[37:03] take something very sacred Mount Sinai
[37:05] he's not destroying it it's not
[37:06] demolishing it he's he's placing it look
[37:08] at the place that it had look what it
[37:09] represented in the law look at all these
[37:11] things that I've I I've showed you that
[37:14] pointed to Christ that that were brought
[37:16] forth there in the law brought forth
[37:18] there at Mount Sinai the very law of the
[37:20] prophets begins there
[37:23] the very the very things that brought
[37:25] forth Elijah in Micah in Malachi they
[37:28] all originated there but he says now
[37:30] Christ has come he says instead of us
[37:33] thinking so much about the Wilderness in
[37:35] Mount Sinai think about what Zion
[37:37] represents because Zion Mount Zion was
[37:39] the first city of David
[37:41] it's an area in Jerusalem where David
[37:43] first established his kingdom
[37:46] this is this is an orientation I said
[37:49] now we've come and again I'll reiterate
[37:52] this
[37:53] Israel is built upon the prophecy of
[37:55] Mount Sinai this is what made them who
[37:58] they are we're on our way back to the
[37:59] promised land if I could just use it to
[38:01] Encompass everything they brought with
[38:03] them into that into the promised land is
[38:06] based upon everything that they'd heard
[38:07] in the wilderness
[38:08] going to be a messiah raise up it's
[38:11] going to be a kingdom established on
[38:12] Earth and Paul is saying now instead of
[38:15] you living in the glare of what was
[38:18] given on Mount Sinai do you not realize
[38:20] that everything that Mount Zion
[38:22] signifies and there's going to be a
[38:24] restoration of the kingdom and it's
[38:25] going to be great and all it's good
[38:26] everyone's going to come to Jerusalem
[38:27] this is it you're there you've arrived
[38:31] you've come to it
[38:33] continues in verse 24.
[38:36] to the uh well verse 23 sorry to the
[38:39] general assembly and the Church of the
[38:41] firstborn
[38:42] now this is mysterious language
[38:46] the general assembly and the Church of
[38:48] the firstborn is that you're all already
[38:50] taken the general assembly and the
[38:52] Church of the firstborn.com I always do
[38:54] spell check when you're registering urls
[38:58] general assembly in the Church of the
[38:59] firstborn which are written in
[39:04] hand of spirit
[39:06] perfect now all these are just
[39:08] just large thoughts you've come to Mount
[39:11] Zion well you could spend a lot of time
[39:13] on that in a Bible class so then you
[39:16] come to the city of the Living God
[39:18] you've come to the Heavenly Jerusalem
[39:19] even uh him referring to the angels and
[39:22] orienting just what habitation this is
[39:25] and now this is a further description of
[39:27] the mountain they've come to what
[39:28] they've come to
[39:30] to the general assembly in the Church of
[39:31] the firstborn
[39:33] Paul now is describing it more
[39:35] particularly that Mount Zion is the body
[39:37] of Christ
[39:39] that it is made up of the elect of God
[39:41] whose names are written in the Lamb's
[39:43] Book of Life for him to say that their
[39:45] names are written in heaven he's saying
[39:46] you are these are the citizens of the
[39:49] New Jerusalem recall how that uh what a
[39:52] name means and then also for a name to
[39:54] be written it was a roll call
[39:56] that for a Jew to have a place and for
[39:59] Jew to have a position in the in in the
[40:02] nation of Israel and for a levite to be
[40:05] a levite and for certain Levites they're
[40:07] entering the priesthood it was a matter
[40:09] of where's and where's the name at buddy
[40:11] yeah he had to go back to the role you
[40:13] had to go back to the books and flip
[40:14] through and say okay yeah all right
[40:15] you're good so when he says these names
[40:17] written in heaven I think that sometimes
[40:20] to only have the
[40:24] that we we sell ourselves short a little
[40:26] bit in our excitement about that when we
[40:28] only just think about some book up there
[40:30] one day that's going to be opened up and
[40:32] where the pencil smudges are there's
[40:34] somebody who's going to hell and where
[40:36] the ones that remain those are the ones
[40:37] that are going to go to heaven and
[40:38] there's so much more to it than that
[40:40] these names written in heaven that
[40:42] relate to the general assembly in the
[40:44] Church of the firstborn these are the
[40:46] elect of God who sit in zenri whose
[40:49] origin
[40:50] whose place of origin who's rightful
[40:53] place and their inheritance is in heaven
[40:56] whose rights and privileges are in
[40:58] heaven who are not just merely
[40:59] earthbounding and come up from the earth
[41:02] and only have some sort of Genesis in
[41:04] the earth they can we can trace our
[41:06] lineage back to in the beginning was the
[41:08] word
[41:10] and he says we've come to God the judge
[41:12] of all
[41:13] these are elements that are represented
[41:15] as Paul is describing something
[41:17] I I when I when I look at it this is
[41:20] just me personally and the way that Paul
[41:22] describes it there's a lot of things
[41:24] that strike the eye as being
[41:25] foundational and that this is this is
[41:28] what makes it up but it's as if he's
[41:30] building to now the god the judge of all
[41:34] and the spirits of just men made perfect
[41:35] that it's it's it's thing it's something
[41:38] that's layered
[41:39] something that is building he says God
[41:42] the judge of all of it
[41:44] and God the judge of all to the spirits
[41:46] of just men made perfect God the
[41:48] righteous judge has Vindicated them as
[41:51] just
[41:53] and what a phrase the spirits
[41:56] of just men righteous men Justified men
[41:59] made perfect
[42:02] Justified and perfected
[42:05] an acknowledgment and a recognition of
[42:07] this maturing of the Christian Life and
[42:10] what's represented in the Beyond and
[42:12] even in this great Kingdom
[42:16] now I I will maybe come back to this
[42:19] very point
[42:20] in after vacation
[42:23] maybe with a much better uh toned tan
[42:27] uh come back to Zion here
[42:31] but Zion is the birthplace of God's
[42:33] children this is when we think Zion
[42:35] there's something spiritually
[42:37] significant about it and the reference
[42:39] to the daughters of Zion I think maybe
[42:41] we'll come to it a little bit uh this
[42:43] morning so you can see how this
[42:44] overlapped and how this tied together
[42:47] and maybe I could say this at this
[42:49] moment if there some of you may be
[42:51] trying to reach real hard into what we
[42:54] have preached to kind of under connect
[42:56] it to seven women
[42:58] in one bride and if the connection's not
[43:01] being made that's fine but it's this is
[43:03] an incredible overlap for me it says the
[43:07] daughter so even the daughter of Zion is
[43:09] a reference to
[43:11] the rightful citizens and Heirs of Zion
[43:14] it's the citizens of design the
[43:16] inhabitants of Zion even the the phrase
[43:18] that's used the sons or the daughters
[43:19] the Zion is it's a reference to the
[43:22] rightful citizens The Heirs of Zion
[43:26] and I want to say this as we go to verse
[43:29] 24. Paul arrives
[43:31] as he says fear not come to the mount
[43:33] that might be touched in The Exodus the
[43:35] children of Israel came to the base of
[43:36] Mount Sinai and they were never allowed
[43:38] to go to the top
[43:39] it was only in a beautiful type Moses is
[43:41] called up and and there's and there's a
[43:43] there's a barrier a boundary that's
[43:45] built around the mouth don't touch don't
[43:46] come near because it's death to come
[43:48] near to it
[43:49] and as Paul comes to Mount Zion he is in
[43:52] figure doing the same thing we've
[43:54] arrived at the base
[43:57] we've arrived at the beginning
[44:00] you're at the foot of Mount Zion the
[44:02] beginning of Mount Zion we are we are
[44:04] now the Church of the firstborn we are
[44:07] uh we are we are now the the initial
[44:10] ones who follow Christ who's the
[44:12] firstborn among the dead we are now the
[44:13] first uh the first church that's been
[44:16] raised up we're the first general
[44:18] assembly we are here we are we're at the
[44:21] beginning
[44:22] the very beginning of this Kingdom
[44:24] I hold that in mind as Paul arrives at
[44:27] the base at the beginning the foundation
[44:28] and in verse 24 he says unto Jesus the
[44:31] mediator of the New Covenant
[44:33] this is what we've come to we've come to
[44:35] Jesus looking unto Jesus the author and
[44:37] finisher of our faith the one who is sit
[44:39] down at the right hand of the Majesty on
[44:41] high
[44:41] the one that sat down at the right hand
[44:43] of the Throne of God and to Jesus we've
[44:45] come to Jesus the mediator of the New
[44:46] Covenant now we know that Christ is in
[44:48] the midst of his church Christ is
[44:50] mediating Christ is Christ is
[44:51] interceding through these ages
[44:54] and to the blood of sprinkling and then
[44:56] I love how he brings it all the way back
[44:58] to Abel that speak of better things than
[45:00] that of Abel
[45:02] so we've come to Jesus the media to the
[45:04] Covenant we've arrived at the foundation
[45:08] there is no church without the mediator
[45:10] there is no body of Christ without
[45:12] Christ the head
[45:14] Paul says for other Foundation can no
[45:17] man lay then that that is laid which is
[45:19] Jesus Christ
[45:21] it is from this Foundation that God
[45:23] builds his church this Foundation of
[45:26] Christ this is from this Foundation that
[45:27] he develops his body
[45:30] so Christ is the Cornerstone
[45:32] Christ is that Foundation
[45:36] Jesus says I say unto thee Peter Upon
[45:39] This Rock I'll build my church and the
[45:41] Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against
[45:43] it it's the only time that Jesus ever
[45:46] mentions having a church
[45:48] and Paul can never get away from it
[45:51] why because this Revelation that I'm
[45:53] going to have a church and upon the
[45:55] revelation of Jesus Christ I'm going to
[45:57] build and develop my church Paul says
[46:00] you've come to the Church of Christ
[46:03] you've come to this Foundation that no
[46:06] one else can lay we've come to and
[46:08] arrived at the very Cornerstone
[46:10] revelation of Jesus Christ upon which he
[46:13] declared he would build his church
[46:16] so Christ is telling us that he did God
[46:18] intends to build up and establish a
[46:22] church
[46:23] an assembly called by his name
[46:26] this is in the image as we've come to
[46:28] Mount Zion
[46:30] and the sermon Christ is revealed in his
[46:31] own word
[46:33] if you listen to the sermon or read it
[46:35] you'll find that brother Branham is
[46:36] telling this story
[46:38] of this of Mount Zion
[46:42] in a particular way so this is it'll
[46:44] overlap with it if you take time to
[46:45] study it the entire Bible Brothers the
[46:48] entire Bible is the entire revelation of
[46:50] Jesus Christ
[46:52] Christ is revealed in his own word got
[46:54] to have an ultimate got to have an
[46:55] absolute the entire Bible is the entire
[46:56] revelation of Jesus Christ making
[46:58] himself known to every age so he will
[47:00] make himself known to you through his
[47:02] word
[47:03] it must come from the word
[47:06] we don't we don't want someone to take
[47:08] the word and manipulate it and to make
[47:11] something outside of the word
[47:13] that has some semblance of it remember
[47:15] the devil's lie that's not the realm we
[47:17] want to exist in we want to always be
[47:19] able to bring it back to the word
[47:23] he says he made himself known in the
[47:24] days of Luther as a foundation the
[47:27] church the foot the legs now now this
[47:30] image is remarkable like he did King
[47:32] Nebuchadnezzar you remember he dreamed
[47:33] those dreams and come from the head down
[47:36] so now if you think of that in Daniel
[47:39] and that image of these kingdoms from
[47:41] the head down uh to the feet
[47:44] and and we see that in the Earthly
[47:46] kingdoms says now look at it here he
[47:48] comes from the feet up
[47:50] in the Babylonian Kingdom he showed all
[47:52] those Old Testaments he come from the
[47:55] head down and you're I trust that most
[47:56] of you are familiar with that as he
[47:58] describes these kingdoms and their
[47:59] different compositions down to the feet
[48:01] until he come down till God himself
[48:03] became flesh at the foot of the ladder
[48:06] so is that those kingdoms wind down and
[48:08] then Christ is coming
[48:10] from the head down to the feet Christ
[48:12] comes he says now here in the New
[48:14] Testament he brings himself right back
[48:17] up again to the head again the head of
[48:20] God to be crowned
[48:22] and this is himself
[48:25] so it's got to come back to he calls it
[48:27] the intelligence it's got to come back
[48:28] to the crown it's got to come to the
[48:31] Head not just the feet the legs the hand
[48:33] the tongues the eyes it's got to come
[48:35] even into the intelligence
[48:38] the head the crown the top he says it's
[48:40] he brings himself back to the Head they
[48:42] had the gold to be crowned so now he's
[48:44] showing it it's coming up from the feet
[48:46] he says God was in the beginning he kept
[48:49] coming down through the prophets on down
[48:51] until God himself became human like us
[48:52] plumbed down at the foot of the ladder a
[48:55] baby born in a manger hated rejected
[48:56] despise a bad name in everything he was
[48:59] so that's it comes down to the feet
[49:01] God happens under times spoke to us by
[49:04] the prophets but now in the last days
[49:05] has spoken to us by his son
[49:09] and he said then he started Rising
[49:12] from the feet he began to build the
[49:14] church the bride coming back on back
[49:17] you see
[49:19] many women one bride many Church ages
[49:22] many churches many denominations many
[49:24] splits many things but one bride's being
[49:26] built through all of it the bride coming
[49:28] back and now coming out now coming out
[49:31] into the headstone
[49:33] where it all joins together and makes
[49:35] the one great transfigured body of Jesus
[49:38] Christ
[49:39] a transfigured body of Jesus Christ that
[49:42] that's something to chew on
[49:45] yeah are you pondering what I'm
[49:46] pondering that's something to think
[49:48] about that that's transfigured body of
[49:51] Jesus Christ it builds up to that moment
[49:53] we should be thinking then that it's all
[49:55] built into a climax of a resurrection of
[49:56] those that have been before and a
[49:58] glorifying of those that are alive and
[49:59] remain
[50:00] this is where we've arrived we've come
[50:02] to the Pinnacle we've come to the top in
[50:04] this hour I'm getting ahead of myself
[50:06] but Paul says we've come to Mount Zion
[50:08] but now as he started at the base he
[50:10] builds to the Head
[50:12] now let's I'll try to go more quickly
[50:15] here
[50:16] in verse 25
[50:19] Paul says that we've come and arrived
[50:21] and he's wanting to give this image as
[50:22] they came to Mount Sinai and they
[50:24] refused they did not want him to speak
[50:26] anymore on that mountain and they had
[50:27] Moses speak and the Judgment was if you
[50:30] do not obey my voice and you don't heed
[50:32] my voice then you you won't be this
[50:35] Kingdom Paul says see that you refuse
[50:37] not him that speaketh for they escaped
[50:40] not who refused him to speak on Earth
[50:42] much more shall not we escape
[50:45] if we turn away from him that speaketh
[50:47] from heaven
[50:50] it's that principle that God sends his
[50:52] word for our deliverance for our healing
[50:54] and if we reject it it's judgment
[50:57] this therefore the same message that
[50:59] saves is the same message that judges
[51:01] the same message that heals is the same
[51:04] message that condemns
[51:06] the same one that's going to bring you
[51:08] out it's the same one that slams the
[51:09] door on you if you won't come
[51:11] you're saying we must hear his voice
[51:17] I'm gonna go ahead and Skip
[51:19] um
[51:20] uh where I was going to go
[51:23] with this and just try to bring it
[51:26] stay within Hebrews 12 and close
[51:29] but if you can remember in Isaiah
[51:30] chapter 4
[51:32] because it says if they escape he's
[51:34] talking about escaping in Hebrews
[51:35] chapter 4 it starts talking about they
[51:37] that escape
[51:39] they that are left
[51:42] those that have been separated out by a
[51:45] spirit of judgment by a spirit of
[51:46] burning
[51:49] see that you refuse not him that speak
[51:51] it for they escape not who refuse him
[51:54] that spake on Earth
[51:55] much more shall we not Escape
[51:58] if we turn away from him that speaketh
[51:59] from Heaven the gospel Christ the media
[52:01] or speaking if you reject him how can
[52:03] you how can you escape how can you be
[52:05] spared
[52:07] this brings us back to the image of
[52:08] Mount Sinai in verse 26 whose voice then
[52:10] shook the Earth
[52:12] but now he have promised saying yet once
[52:15] more I shake not the Earth only but also
[52:17] heaven
[52:18] this is a prophecy from haggai this is
[52:20] this is Paul where he's standing we've
[52:22] come to Mount Zion and he's saying God's
[52:26] going to speak again
[52:27] oh I hope that you could just uh think
[52:30] about what this message represents and
[52:33] the symbolisms and the the events and
[52:35] the things that transpired to bring us
[52:37] to where we are today he says this voice
[52:40] shook the Earth yet once more I shake
[52:42] not the Earth only but also heaven and
[52:45] this word this prophecy yet once more
[52:49] so it's he's not pointing back
[52:51] historically
[52:53] to Mount Sinai he's not even pointing
[52:56] back historically to the days of Jesus
[52:58] on Earth and he's not just speaking to
[53:01] the voice and the mediator of the New
[53:03] Covenant which is speaking from heaven
[53:05] but he says this word yet more what's
[53:07] more signified the removing of those
[53:09] things that are shaken as of things that
[53:12] are made that those things which cannot
[53:14] be shaken May remain
[53:17] what Paul saw we are facing the
[53:19] completion of
[53:21] what Paul was looking at and challenging
[53:24] to persevere you had not come to Mount
[53:25] Sinai this is not a temporary stop on
[53:28] our way to a Promised Land we've come to
[53:30] Mount Zion we've come to the kingdom and
[53:32] this is the very things that make it up
[53:34] and whereas you couldn't touch that
[53:35] mountain and you couldn't walk that
[53:37] mountain you couldn't Traverse that
[53:39] mountain we've arrived at one that we
[53:41] have we must Ascend and we must come to
[53:44] the top we must go all the way through
[53:46] this so what Paul saw there at the
[53:48] beginning we're facing the completion of
[53:50] because we're not at the base of Mount
[53:52] Zion
[53:54] we've come to the Capstone
[53:56] we've come to The Headstone we've come
[53:58] to the completion and it's there at the
[54:00] top God doesn't speak at the base he
[54:02] speaks at the top
[54:04] look at what takes place in these types
[54:06] of Mount Sinai look at what takes place
[54:07] and even where it would be represented
[54:09] in Mount Carmel Mount Transfiguration
[54:11] Mount Zion it was the voice of God that
[54:13] shook the Earth on Mount Sinai
[54:16] and it will come again and Shake Heaven
[54:19] and Earth
[54:20] in Exodus 19 when they heard the voice
[54:22] they are afraid
[54:24] in Exodus 19 they they felt like they
[54:27] couldn't endure in light of what was
[54:28] being spoken even said you know what I
[54:30] don't want to hear from God anymore
[54:34] amazing
[54:36] that they didn't want to hear direct
[54:38] from God
[54:39] they just get it they just wanted to
[54:40] hear it from Moses
[54:42] and just leave it at that we'll just
[54:43] take the letter of what Moses says
[54:48] they were afraid but now Hebrews 12 18
[54:51] for ye are not come unto the mountain
[54:52] that might be touched
[54:54] or that burned with fire you're not come
[54:56] to blackness in Darkness Darkness and
[54:59] Tempest
[55:00] that's not what you've come to
[55:03] they came and they trembled and they
[55:04] were afraid and it shook and even Moses
[55:06] was exceedingly fearful and the Earth
[55:08] shook in the mountain Shook and he's
[55:10] saying God's going to speak again
[55:12] and there's going to be a word go Goes
[55:14] Forth and it's going to shake heaven and
[55:16] earth
[55:16] and there's going to be signs given and
[55:18] there's going to be things shaking and
[55:19] things happening and this word this
[55:22] voice yet again signifies the removing
[55:24] of things
[55:25] I was going to bring it out of uh Isaiah
[55:28] 4 and Malachi 3 but let me just say it
[55:30] this way there's a word that comes and
[55:32] separates
[55:33] it's a word that comes and takes away
[55:36] those things that can be shaken as
[55:39] things that are made so that things that
[55:41] are original can remain
[55:43] the things that have been added to can
[55:45] be shaken the very things that are in
[55:48] incomplete can be taken away so that the
[55:51] unshakable can remain
[55:54] and he says in verse 28 29 wherefore we
[55:57] receiving a kingdom which cannot be
[55:59] moved
[56:00] let us have Grace
[56:03] think of this this beautiful beautiful
[56:05] word wherefore we receive in a kingdom
[56:08] which cannot be moved
[56:11] let us have Grace
[56:14] this is what we need let us have Grace
[56:17] so that we can whereby we may by this
[56:20] grace
[56:22] in this Kingdom serve God acceptably
[56:26] there's an acceptable way
[56:28] and then to do it with reverence and
[56:30] godly fear
[56:32] this should be a like a guiding
[56:35] thought to our lives
[56:37] that we've received a kingdom which
[56:39] cannot be moved therefore let me have
[56:40] Grace
[56:42] and I want to serve God acceptably
[56:44] with reverence and godly fear they've
[56:47] got to have that reverence and godly
[56:49] fear
[56:50] one thing that I I trust that maybe you
[56:53] could say Amen to there's a lot of
[56:55] things Christians don't do because they
[56:58] fear God
[57:01] there's people you wouldn't speak
[57:03] against there's things you wouldn't do
[57:05] ways you wouldn't act not because you're
[57:08] afraid of getting exposed or afraid it's
[57:10] not going to work or afraid of man you
[57:11] just fear God too much
[57:13] you know that God's the judge of all and
[57:15] that if you presume and you venture out
[57:17] God at any moment can say oh yeah buddy
[57:19] you're on your own
[57:21] and so the fear of God is so important
[57:24] do we fear God enough to moderate our
[57:26] Behavior
[57:27] do we have enough Godly fear to change
[57:29] the way we live and the way that we Act
[57:30] is we ought to have Grace so that we can
[57:32] serve God acceptably
[57:34] I I believe that we're gonna we're gonna
[57:36] be challenged if we're not already being
[57:38] challenged let's not make the mistake of
[57:41] thinking that there's some sort of that
[57:44] it's some sort of either emotion or
[57:46] intellectual Revival that we kind of get
[57:48] caught up in in church becomes our touch
[57:51] base and our in our all hands on deck
[57:53] rally cry a couple times a week just to
[57:56] make sure we're all still in the same
[57:57] game listen this has gotta this is real
[58:00] this has got to come down to life this
[58:02] has gotta I I say it just from the
[58:05] bottom of my heart I need a God that's
[58:07] with me every day
[58:10] oh my I guess if we could just start
[58:13] some sort of Revival or whatever we're
[58:15] feeling depressed there's enough people
[58:16] here running around the auditorium and
[58:18] whooping it up say well I'm feeling down
[58:20] today I guess I'll just go by the church
[58:21] and whoop it up for a while you know
[58:22] that's what gems are for
[58:25] that's what that's what uh uh that's
[58:27] what CrossFit is what if you want a cult
[58:29] it's going to motivate you just join
[58:31] CrossFit
[58:33] but if I want something that's with me
[58:36] I want something real I want something
[58:38] that changes that changes the way that I
[58:41] raise my children and I'm able to
[58:43] overcome complexes and weaknesses and
[58:45] fears and and things that have been
[58:47] poured into me and things that I'm
[58:48] holding on to I want to be able to show
[58:50] Christ to my children I want to love my
[58:52] wife as Christ loves the church there's
[58:54] things that mean that should mean
[58:56] something to us I want to serve God
[58:59] acceptably
[59:02] he says for our God is a consuming fire
[59:06] and the very thing
[59:08] that the very thing that'll consume
[59:10] everything else is the very thing that
[59:11] delivers you
[59:13] the very thing that refines and purifies
[59:15] you very thing that causes people to
[59:18] shriek and run away and others to melt
[59:20] and others to cry out and and to be
[59:23] burned up it's the very thing that
[59:25] delivers you
[59:26] as those Hebrew children were thrown
[59:28] into a furnace heated seven times hotter
[59:30] than ever been burnt before it only
[59:32] slayed the men that threw him in
[59:35] and loose the bounds that held them
[59:39] our God is a consuming fire
[59:42] you I would encourage you to listen to
[59:45] one or all or read some of the sermons
[59:47] that brother Brown preached the world
[59:48] has again Fallen apart of the world has
[59:49] fallen apart he preaches it a few times
[59:51] multiple times more than three
[59:54] this statement the world is again
[59:56] falling apart he said we receive this
[59:58] Kingdom
[59:59] he's some other word
[1:00:01] both Heaven and Earth will pass away but
[1:00:03] this word shall never pass away
[1:00:06] and this word is the kingdom
[1:00:08] we may have been reading this already
[1:00:10] this is the king and the kingdom the
[1:00:13] system the life it's every bit right
[1:00:15] here
[1:00:16] and one of the things he's constantly
[1:00:18] referring to in the world has fallen
[1:00:19] upon is all the systems
[1:00:21] all the systems that people make to
[1:00:23] placate themselves or allay their fears
[1:00:25] or give them some sense well I've been
[1:00:27] accepted and you know I've been prayed
[1:00:29] out of purgatory I've lit the candles
[1:00:30] and I've been baptized in the Latter-Day
[1:00:32] Saints I've got all my bases covered and
[1:00:34] I choose Thursdays to kind of doubt
[1:00:36] things just in case the agnostics are
[1:00:38] right and on Saturdays I just completely
[1:00:40] deny it all so that at any given moment
[1:00:42] I've covered all my bases and all those
[1:00:44] systems won't work he says the word this
[1:00:47] is the king this word is the king the
[1:00:49] kingdom the system of life every bit of
[1:00:51] it right here
[1:00:53] and if I could say this as Paul said we
[1:00:55] receive in the Kingdom brother Branham
[1:00:58] in Christ The Mystery of God revealed
[1:01:00] his one is to recognize that the kingdom
[1:01:03] that the Christian church was looking
[1:01:05] for and the King that the Christian
[1:01:07] church was looking for was revealing
[1:01:09] himself to his word he says because our
[1:01:12] headship is a kingdom he's saying the
[1:01:14] headship is here
[1:01:16] the kingdom has come to us and we have
[1:01:19] received that immovable unshakable
[1:01:21] Kingdom
[1:01:25] we receive in a kingdom that cannot be
[1:01:27] moved
[1:01:28] he says this in response to the fact
[1:01:30] that there will be a voice that'll Shake
[1:01:32] Heaven and Earth
[1:01:34] pass away but my word will never pass
[1:01:36] away there'll be a shaking and things
[1:01:38] that both in heaven and things in Earth
[1:01:40] if they were made if they're impure if
[1:01:43] they're not part of the original they
[1:01:44] will vanish they will perish
[1:01:48] that those which cannot be shaken
[1:01:52] those things which cannot be shaken
[1:01:55] May remain
[1:01:58] to be shaken it's a it's a motion that's
[1:02:00] produced by an outside force
[1:02:03] some wind or storm or wave that
[1:02:05] something is buffeted
[1:02:07] and so it to be shaken means to be
[1:02:09] agitated
[1:02:11] right isn't this what we all say or
[1:02:12] maybe our grandparents say it when
[1:02:14] something happened and a car runs a red
[1:02:15] light and they almost get hit they go
[1:02:17] I'm shook right
[1:02:18] isn't that what the Boomers say
[1:02:20] something happens in it and it shakes
[1:02:22] them up oh I'm unsettled I'm agitated
[1:02:25] I'm stirred up it means the cost to
[1:02:27] Teeter taught her
[1:02:28] to move now think of that but there's a
[1:02:32] just whatever could be shaken
[1:02:35] it means to shake down or to overthrow
[1:02:38] the very word
[1:02:40] to be shaken it's to cause one to no
[1:02:43] longer be happy
[1:02:45] to cast down from a secure state of
[1:02:47] security to agitate the mind to disturb
[1:02:49] them whatever can be shaken will be
[1:02:51] shaken whatever can be agitated whatever
[1:02:54] can be stirred up will be stirred up oh
[1:02:56] I want to find that immovable
[1:02:59] he said we receive in a kingdom it's
[1:03:02] ought to be closed on this I'll invite
[1:03:03] our musicians to come brother Batman
[1:03:05] Christ is revealed in his own word
[1:03:07] there's some more statements maybe we'll
[1:03:08] read them on Wednesday he says now
[1:03:10] the stabilizers have been put on the
[1:03:12] ship
[1:03:14] We're not gonna we're not going down
[1:03:17] we're not going to be tossed about I I
[1:03:19] the the concept and the idea of wind of
[1:03:23] Doctrine has begun to become more
[1:03:25] pronounced to me in how that things blow
[1:03:28] through and things move and listen
[1:03:30] there's a wind of Doctrine and it blows
[1:03:33] through and there's people that Teeter
[1:03:35] on it right
[1:03:36] and and I realize there's people that
[1:03:39] lean into it
[1:03:40] and what are they doing they're just
[1:03:42] fighting the wind they're all being
[1:03:43] moved by it
[1:03:44] but I want to be unmovable
[1:03:47] let every wind of dark let it move it's
[1:03:49] not going to sway me
[1:03:50] I'm not going to change my orientation
[1:03:53] based upon the wind the way the winds
[1:03:54] are blowing oh you want to blow at me
[1:03:56] with that well
[1:03:58] and try to fight it again no I don't
[1:04:00] need to do that
[1:04:02] he says the stabilizers have been put on
[1:04:04] the ship
[1:04:05] great fearful waves are out here before
[1:04:08] us but we know
[1:04:10] just beyond that way of Yonder we're
[1:04:12] nearing the shore we're nearing the
[1:04:15] shore in other words it's that finish
[1:04:16] line that Paul talked about let us run
[1:04:18] with patience the race that is set
[1:04:20] before us he says just stay stabled
[1:04:24] just stay in the word he opened it by
[1:04:27] saying what he wanted to what he wanted
[1:04:29] to preach was something to stabilize
[1:04:31] just stay in the word stay with God no
[1:04:35] matter how you feel
[1:04:38] what anything else stay right with the
[1:04:40] word
[1:04:41] we've been talking about this with with
[1:04:43] our children and just as a family
[1:04:45] discussing things the reason why we
[1:04:47] don't go by emotions is there's a lot of
[1:04:49] things even that are wonderful
[1:04:50] emotionally shouting dancing praising
[1:04:53] speaking in tongues all these things
[1:04:54] that you feel it these things are
[1:04:56] awesome but if that's your stability you
[1:05:00] don't always have it
[1:05:02] you may not you you may be one that
[1:05:04] loves to dance and shout and work it up
[1:05:06] and you can you can work in that way
[1:05:07] because you're natured that way and the
[1:05:09] holy spirit moves on you but if that's
[1:05:11] your time post where what are you when
[1:05:13] that's gone
[1:05:16] what are you when you're you don't have
[1:05:17] the emotions you don't have the one two
[1:05:19] you don't have the know-how so he says
[1:05:21] it's not what you feel stay right with
[1:05:22] the word let it stay stable when you see
[1:05:26] all those great big old clouds around us
[1:05:28] and storms coming and atomic bombs and
[1:05:30] everything else they're talking about
[1:05:33] yeah
[1:05:34] Hunter Biden or whatever else
[1:05:38] but our stabilizers right straight in
[1:05:41] the word
[1:05:42] [Music]
[1:05:43] God said it would be here
[1:05:46] and it is
[1:05:48] that's what he's saying God said it
[1:05:49] would be here could you see him just as
[1:05:51] Paul we're saying there God promised us
[1:05:54] the Messiah on Mount Sinai the law and
[1:05:56] the prophets pointed to a messiah he's
[1:05:58] like he's here God has spoken to us by
[1:06:01] his son whom the heavens must receive
[1:06:03] until the time appointed and the
[1:06:04] fullness of times this is this is what
[1:06:06] you ought to be looking to he says but
[1:06:08] our stabilizer is right straight in the
[1:06:10] word God said it would be here we'll
[1:06:13] Crest every one of them
[1:06:16] in the shore we won't be deterred we're
[1:06:19] not going to be rocking from side to
[1:06:21] side we're just gonna go right through
[1:06:23] it we're gonna Crest every one of them
[1:06:25] he says yeah we'll go right over the top
[1:06:27] of them yes indeed they can't sink us
[1:06:31] they can't drown us
[1:06:34] let me say that we have a voice behind
[1:06:37] us saying don't turn to the left don't
[1:06:40] turn to the right stay in line
[1:06:43] and we'll Crest every one of them
[1:06:46] he says the world has fallen apart but
[1:06:49] the kingdom of God Has Come
[1:06:51] now if I could say this this is
[1:06:54] controversial
[1:06:56] yeah
[1:06:57] for for a prophet amongst the
[1:06:59] denominations and amongst the
[1:07:00] theologians and everyone for him to say
[1:07:02] the kingdom of God has come that's
[1:07:04] controversial because even the
[1:07:05] Christians were wanting to put it off
[1:07:07] for some other day
[1:07:08] but he says the kingdom of God has come
[1:07:10] and we're sitting with the Messiah
[1:07:14] God's Messiah let's feed on that for a
[1:07:17] little bit that's where we are and let
[1:07:20] me say this
[1:07:21] be unshakable I'll just pick up on a
[1:07:24] Wednesday night Lord willing be
[1:07:25] unshakable be unmovable
[1:07:28] in this day and age that we're living I
[1:07:30] think more than anything that's what we
[1:07:32] crave
[1:07:34] so not be shaken little things come up
[1:07:36] little things happen you know what it
[1:07:37] feels like in your in your spirit you
[1:07:40] know when you've been agitated you know
[1:07:41] when it starts to affect you physically
[1:07:42] I'm talking about that that you who have
[1:07:46] had that Bedrock can find that you're so
[1:07:48] solidly anchored in the word of God he
[1:07:50] said I'm not going to be shaken
[1:07:52] because I found that which is unshakable
[1:07:55] please stand with me today God bless you
[1:08:00] [Music]
