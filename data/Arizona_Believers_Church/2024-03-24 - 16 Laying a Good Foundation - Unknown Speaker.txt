TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I'm going to try to jump right into this and and get going and see how far that we could get today if you could look just at this scripture that we just read I'll start just by pointing out a few things here as Paul is charging them that we could say are rich in this world I think it speaks to those who have some means or resources uh rich in in wealth and worldly things and not in worldliness or things that were are wicked uh but because they have these certain things and resources and wealth and money uh that they should not be high-minded or trust in those riches so you can see what it's referring to in these riches but they should trust in God this is a living God who gives us abundantly all things to enjoy so the things that we have we rejoice in them as from the Lord but we don't trust in them we trust in the Lord and then he says this is the charge to them that are rich uh not only that they trust in the Living God but they do good and they are rich in good works and ready to distribute of their wealth and their riches H and then it makes this statement in doing these things they are laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come that they may lay hold on eternal life and it's this phrase a good foundation I want to take that's my title today laying a good foundation and if you could just focus with me as we give that title laying a good foundation uh Focus because it builds on a lot of these other parts if you haven't heard any of the other parts you still can get a lot out of this but there's a lot of touch points that you could see um where these things are coming from in the subject of the house of the Lord so he says laying up in store for themselves a good foundation we're looking to ourselves really on our us laying a good foundation and when it says a good foundation that good there means beautiful it's choice or precious it's excellent excellent in its nature and care character it's useful it's suitable it's well adapted therefore it's approved so it's this is a sure foundation not just laying a foundation but laying a good foundation uh maybe there's something he could have said to say well you know do these things because it's it's it's it's a foundation but he wants to convey the idea that this is a not just a foundation but a good foundation which is excellent which is beautiful which is well suited for its purpose and a foundation is in Even in our word if we say Foundation it comes basically its roots is in a founding something that is beginning it comes from to lay the basis of or to establish something and we use Foundation to refer to the solid base of a structure so if there's a structure the foundation is that solid part that it rests upon and it doesn't really take much logic to realize that that would probably need to go first if there's a structure to be built built on it so it's the founding it's the beginning of something in 1 Corinthians 3:1 it says for other Foundation can no man lay than that is laid which is Jesus Christ now this is uh I know I'm using a familiar scripture we've already used a few times in the last few Services if Jesus Christ is the only foundation that can be laid how important is the foundation not just anything can be a foundation so this speaks to the importance of the foundation the founding or the beginning of something and this would go to anything that requires a foundation if Jesus Christ is the only foundation that could be laid then that tells us wow laying the foundation is very very critical as it says in Isaiah 28:16 therefore thus sayith the Lord God behold I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone for a beginning for a start a stone not just any stone a tried Stone and not just any Cornerstone a precious Cornerstone a sure Foundation he that believeth shall not make haste shall not be confounded shall not be ashamed and so I will lay for an a a beginning a stone a tried Stone a precious Cornerstone a sure Foundation you could find where Jesus Christ fits this example he fits this prophecy not just the example but he fulfills this prophecy and so it's for foundation stone that's your foundation stone as they might say a setting Stone it's the very first stone that would be laid uh in a construction and in the construction of a foundation and then once you laid that Cornerstone or that setting Stone all other stones in the foundation everything else you do on the foundation is set in reference to it so as we said before it determines the position of the building it determines the strength of the entire structure it's a this foundation stone in this Foundation is very very critical now if you could turn your Bibles or turn your eyes to however it is you get the scriptures these days but in psalm 1045 it's speaking of the Lord in verse one it says bless the Lord oh my soul oh Lord my God Thou Art very great so this is a this declaration to the Lord and in these preceding verses there's it's about the creation and it says of God and this blessed Lord he says who laid the foundations of the earth that it should not be removed forever so the creation of the earth is in this verse is compared to the erecting a building on a solid foundation now we know that it's a much greater task but yet to draw on Human Experience he says I laid I laid the foundations of the earth and it gives this image of a building not that the Earth itself is sitting on some literal Foundation but it gives us an idea he founded the Earth on her basis on a basis or Foundation this is something that God has done in the beginning he created the heavens and the Earth he was laying foundations for it in the beginning that it should not be removed forever in job 38: 1-7 you'll recognize this scripture then the Lord answered job out of the Whirlwind and said who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge if you ever hear that you better you're you're you're being told something so he says G now G up now thy loins like a man for I will demand of thee and answer thou me so he's telling him to Lo up his GS as it might be said a and I'm going to demand of you you're going to have to answer me and then he says where was thou when I laid the foundations of the earth so God's the one that laid him he's even ascribing it to himself I laid the foundations of the Earth where were you when I did that you want to come to me talking you have all these questions to ask where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth declare if thou Hast understanding who hath laid the measures thereof if thou knowest the measures of what the foundation or who ha stretched the line upon it now he's using uh maybe an architectural engineering language and and a foundation that you're going to measure you're gon to you're going to check these things you're going to lay it out you're going to stretch the line upon it whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened or who laid the Cornerstone thereof when the morning Stars sang together and all the sons of God shouted for Joy now remember this as we continue as this is a setting before job this is a setting before creation he says where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth I laid the measures thereof I stretched out a l upon it whereupon are the foundations fashioned a and who laid the Cornerstone of that Foundation God saying I did that in the creation of the earth God established the Earth on a foundation as it says in Psalms that it should not be removed forever it's fast it's unmovable it it's secure it's fixed cannot be shaken out of its place now it may be shaken but it cannot be shaken out of its place it's fixed permanent solid and God laid it so it says the Earth is fixed firmly by his power and when it talks when it's wanting us to think about God's Providence and God's planning and how solid and firm the Earth is it's saying it's been fixed by his power and his power is manifested in his foundation I've laid the Earth on a foundation that it should not be removed forever it says in Isaiah 48:13 mind also hath laid the foundation of the Earth in my right hand hath spanned the heavens when I call unto them they stand up together he's not only the founder but he's the ruler he's the governor I've laid it upon the foundations I know how they work I have laid the foundations of the Earth where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth and laid the measures thereof and ran a lion upon it who laid the foundations of the earth that's God who did that Proverbs 8:29 when he gave the sea his decree that the waters should not pass his commandment when he appointed the foundations of the earth now at this point I want to make this point this is not this is not physical foundations though we could find firmament and things in reference to the Earth itself and uh the mountains underneath and the mountains above and certain things that uh relate to the creation of the earth I had some uh passages going to read about the pillars of Heaven and the pillars of the earth and what those things are that he's not just referring to physical pillars or physical foundations but when he appointed the foundations of the earth though there are is a physical manifestation of certain things and I've laid the foundations of the Earth where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth it's not we're not only thinking physical and I think this is important for us uh to catch this but it's the principles upon which it was constructed and and the laws by which it's governed I laid the foundation of the earth my right hath spanned the heavens when I call unto them they shall stand together I appointed the foundations of the earth it's not that he laid some concrete and he has the world sitting on some pillars literally but saying the Earth itself is uph it's upheld by a law that there are certain principles that I was using in creating and there's certain uh wisdom and there is are are laws that govern these things so a foundation isn't necessarily physical but it's wisdom says in Jeremiah 10:12 he hath made the Earth by his power he hath established the World by his wisdom and has stretched out the heavens by his discretion the foundations of creation represent God's wisdom the foundations of the earth represent God's power so who laid the foundations of the earth and who uh where were you when I laid them and what was the wisdom and what was the power I made the Earth by my power I've fixed it and established it by my wisdom so the foundation is made by his power that The Establishment the permanence of it is made by his wisdom and he just as his hand hath spanned the heavens and he says that my hand is stretched out uh by my discretion it's wisdom discretion discernment power that builds the foundation I mean let's just think of it if it's not wisdom that's doing it what good is it if it's not done in power what good is it it says in Proverbs 9:1 wisdom hath builded her house sheath heun out her Seven Pillars that heun as we looked at in the beginning of the series it's cut out as a Mason cutting a stone and she's hewing out her pillars that guiding supporting strength that raises something up these pillars hold them up as it says in first Samuel 2 for the pillars of the Earth are the Lords and he hath set the world upon them as a house set upon pillars as a house set upon a foundation The Pillars of the Earth are the Lords and he set them as he built them he set the world the Earth and all Humanity upon it the foundations which God created the very foundations uh that he upholds and by these foundations he sustains the Earth and all creation and Mankind that that's what governs all creation that's why things are time that's why science calls it uh mother nature and different things that we can calculate because God has set these things in motion he's put it on some basis and I could continue Without End showing how the word demonst Ates over and over again the importance of Foundations and I can't think of any more greater things to point to other than the fact that there's no other F Foundation that can be laid than the Lord Jesus Christ that means it has to be the best it has to be the perfect it has to be Supreme it's the it's the most important thing and then God in creating the heavens and the Earth the language of the scripture continually repeatedly is the foundations of the earth not just the Earth but the foundations upon which it rest God did not have a creation with without basis he did not bring forth without basis he did it by power he did it by wisdom he did it by discretion and so therefore there are foundations that are the success to this creation do I have permission to continue we got that part okay we're doing good on time I think now this might seem a little bit of a a shift but as our Series has been on the house of the Lord I I kind of we'll dip into this so you can see how these things connect together in 2 Chronicles 3:1 if you could begin reading here with me and then we'll stay in Chronicles for a little bit and and and this could may slow down perhaps and start focusing on a very particular part and so I was just laying a foundation for this part and I hope it was a good one in 2 Chronicles 3:1 then Solomon began to build the house of the Lord at Jerusalem in Mount Mariah where the Lord appeared unto David his father in the place that David had prepared in the threshing for of Orin the jebusite if I can say this we're now very specifically looking at the beginning of building the house of the Lord and in the is as I've studied the scriptures and just reading different things that are relating to foundations and beginnings and the it being established and being firmed and being fixed the foundation of the temple the house of the Lord and the foundations of the earth share similar descriptions things that are said about the foundations of the Earth are similar to the foundations of the temple and the building of the house of the Lord I'm using the house of the Lord as examples to us and we've already us several services in showing how the house of the Lord is used in different types and shadows and how that it relates to us the house of the Lord which we saw in the Tabernacle but then ultimately in that fixed place the temple uh they are a type of Christ so the house of the Lord is a type of Jesus Christ it was made in the pattern of Heaven it is even an image of Heaven and Earth as the Jews say the structure of the Tabernacle and the temple correspond to the structure of Heaven and Earth in the outer Court inner Court holy of holies there it's PL it shows the Plan of Redemption it shows the arrangements of Earth and Heaven and even the uh the Unseen heaven and so in the temple the house of the Lord it represents the individual you are pictured in that three room house and it represents the Church of God the body of Christ or we could say the bride so the house of the Lord is a real easy subject to get a lot of sermon material out of and that's not why we're doing it but we realize that you can get a lot of distance in using that but we want it to be applicable we want it to be relevant so as it says that solom begin to build the house of the Lord when it says he began to build the house of the Lord there's something that God will show us in the way the house of the Lord was built that's relevant to us who are a house of the Lord but then also those of us who are building a house making our houses homes part of the house of the Lord that we're that we're to look out after and looking out after one another the body of Christ which is the house of the Lord his Dwelling Place his body and so solom began to build the house of the Lord at Jerusalem in Mount Mariah I want to keep coming back to these phrases where the Lord appeared unto David his father in the place that David had prepared in the threshing floor of oron the jebusite so David hadn't prepared a a in this place and now salon's going to build on it now if you can look at 2 Chronicles chapter 8 verse 16 I I want to refer to this very quickly hopefully come back to it at a later date now all the work of Solomon was prepared unto the day of the foundation of the house of the Lord and until it was finished so the house of the Lord was perfected incred statement it's Amplified elsewhere to understand just exactly what this means maybe we'll get into more of it later but let me say this all the work of SSM was prepared from the day of the foundation until it was finished in other words all the materials were acquired manufactured furnished beforehand he he didn't just start building with what he had on hand and hope that he could run into it later we built uh we built a fixer upper in Texas and and when we had the tile laid in the master bathroom uh the the tile guy had to go out and buy more tile and it wasn't until it was all done I was just looking I'm like this this tile's two different colors because when you when the tile goes into the Kil and when it's manufactured could be the same white or label white but different sets and different groupings and whatever they call them uh will have different different manufacturing dates and different chemical uh process that takes place it's a totally different color even though that's the only color they sell and so that would be a situation where you want to know how much tile you need in your master bath anybody taking notes how much tile you need in your master bathroom and buy it all at the same time so you have everything you need and it's all the same color and all the Builder said and so this is something that he had done he beforehand says I've got everything I need a lot of planning and preparation that went into this so I want to draw from this example for ourselves and for our homes and for us as Homemakers and home builders as brother bam said about ourselves were building the living Tabernacle of the living God's Dwelling Place the perfect man the living Tabernacle of the Living God where he dwells and he wasn't just talking about Jesus Christ he was talking about us so we are to be a a a spiritual house we're to be Lively stones in a spiritual building we are you are the Temple of the Holy Ghost so as Solomon began to build the house of Lord at Jerusalem in Mount Mariah he it says that he was prepared s the work was prepared prepared furnished um acquired manufactured we know this from the teaching of the Bible things took place off site and then were brought to the site and then put together there was no waiting uh 13 weeks for Windows or doors it was they had it I want to examine the background of this place that s begin to build on and what it represents for us I trust that you're kind of foll me step by step here Solomon began to build the house of the Lord at Jerusalem in Mount Mariah now could have just moved on right we could have maybe skipped seven chapters and said and it was all prepared the house of the Lord was perfect and then move on right let's get to where good the good stuff starts happening like Ehud and things you know let's get let's get to exciting things Kings fighting in Wars but it gives us all these details and it says this about this site this place where the Lord apped to David his father and the place that David had prepared in the threshing floor so it says in 1st Chronicles 21:18 that's before 2 Chronicles so if you found that it's not hard to find the first 1 Chronicles 21:18 then the angel of the Lord commanded Gad this is the prophet now to say to David that David the Lord is saying this that David should go up and set up an altar unto the Lord in the threshing floor of ornon the jebusite this is the sight of the house of the Lord and this is where Solomon is going to build the temple and God is telling a prophet to have David the king go build an altar on that very site the Tabernacle I believe it's in gibian at this time it is it's the Tabernacle in the wilderness and now David is being told by the prophet God wants him to go to this very specific Place go to the threshing floor of or and the jebusite go to that very spot and I want you to build an altar there now God didn't just check um altar BNB a a and just find out which one's available right where could we where oh well you know oron's got got a good listing here uh and he gets back to you in about an hour so let's just see if we can't book a sacrifice uh uh in the threshing floor of Orin good pictures good ratings good reviews God chose it for a reason not just because it was available now this is where I hope to emphasize this and we're going to get somewhere some where in this as far as us both the act of building the Altar and the worship that proceedes there and the location of it God intends to express great truths not just historical facts but principles for us living today it's going to reflect things about Jesus Christ it's going to reflect things about what he does for us it's going to reflect things what we ought to be doing as his servants the threshing floor let let's just start with that he said to go set up an altar in the threshing floor so he could just said go to the land of orn and with the plot that he owns but he wants him to go to the threshing threshing floor to do so and this was a very hard flat surface that was used to break the chaff and the sheaves from the seed so you would Harvest Grain and you would and you'd have things that we would Harvest and then you would use this ground as the as the foundation to separate the sheaves and the chaff the husk the Shu from the seed you want to get to the seed you want to get to the grain there had to be a place to prepare that now I just want to reference this I'm not going to try to teach this if you if you want to reject this it's fine but this threshing floor symbolizes the separation of righteousness from unrighteousness it's the separation of righteousness from wickedness so it's what he says go to the threshing floor this the threshing floor carries it with its symbol uh symbolism it speaks of something of purification in judgment a shuck is being separated a chaff the the the husk all these things the sheaves are being separated so this is this is Judgment this is separation and this this threshing floor is located on the Harvest field it it's there and it's meticulously leveled they' use a cylindrical block and they would level it and they would use chalk and they would compact it in order to keep the weeds out and and keep it in such a way to where if there was an extensive drought it still would be even and firm it wouldn't be cracking and unleveled so they were very meticulous about keeping the weeds out keeping it flat and level no cracks uh watered just right because this is the this is where they would come to that final stage of the Harvest now those of you who like the types and shadows you can go ahead and start getting Giddy and maybe I'll tickle that itch a little bit here and Ruth 3: 1 to3 this is where we see a very striking uh represent presentation of this threshing floor that remember this that David is going to come back to that a threshing floor that David not that not so David's going to come to a threshing floor and now look at this threshing floor who is in the lineage of these characters here what it represents and symbolizes in his lineage then Naomi her mother-in-law said unto Ruth my daughter shall I not seek rest for thee that it may be well with thee and now is not Boaz of our k with whose maidens thou was and so we realize that this is after in Chapter 2 where he had shown her great favor and kindness and where did you get all this grain if you stolen he like no this guy Boaz he's taking a Lykan to me and she's saying this isn't your near kizman and so this is what she says behold he went with barley tonight in the threshing floor here's the lord of the Harvest here's the owner here's the richest man and he is on the threshing floor winnowing The Barley that night and N he says wash thyself catch these things before you when you come to this threshing floor wash yourself anoint thee and put thy rment upon thee and get thee down to the floor but n make nelf not known unto the man until he shall have done eating and drinking the winnowing was the final stage of this Harvest uh there would be a crushing and there would be a breaking up and then there would be winnowed and it would be done at night and the owner even the owner would remain all night during the Harvest Time not only because the Grain and they speculate because the grain was valuable but the winds were also suitable and the work needed to be done and so here is Boaz the near Kinsman the kinsman redeemer on the threshing floor and Ruth the Gentile has got to come to the threshing floor to meet the master of the Harvest in that final stage of the Harvest in the final stage of the separation for her to be redeemed so the flesh the threshing floor it represents purification it represents judgment but it also represents Redemption because here's Boaz the Redeemer and Ruth types of Christ in the Gentile bride and and a beautiful picture of the Rapture at at the nighttime at the ending of the Harvest in the last stage of the separation of the seed from the Shu and that Harvest Time Our Redeemer comes to the threshing floor Our Redeemer comes to the testing ground Our Redeemer Christ Our Boaz appears and we come to him in the final stages of the winnowing in the final separation there on the threshing floor was Redemption you know how the penan fathers and The Poets wrote of how for Christ's sake Ruth was drawn to the threshing floor and laid at the feet of Boaz that night on the threshing floor to show Christ to show Redemption and this is the ground that the prophet tells David he wants this is the type of ground that the prophet tells David he wants him to go to the threshing floor of Orin the jebusite there was a threshing floor there in the days of Boaz the threshing floor in Bethlehem but now this threshing floor just as Christ was born in a stable in Bethlehem he's going to be the king of Jerusalem now he's told to come to a threshing floor of ornon the jebusite at Jerusalem in Mount Mariah and the reason that God calls him this is 1st Chronicles 21:18 if we go back to the first verse of 1 Chronicles chapter 21 verse one's not hard to find it's before Verse 18 so if you found that one you'll be able to back up a little bit to this one it says and Satan stood up against Israel and provoke David to number Israel so a little bit of testing to David a little bit of pushing a little bit of trying and David is tempted and he's provoked David is provoked and he numbers Israel at Satan's testing and it says in verses 78 and God was displeased with this thing therefore he smok Israel and now David recognizes this in verse eight and David said to God I've sinned greatly because I've done this thing but now I beseech thee do away the iniquity of thy servant for I have done very foolishly then God gives them choices well okay I'll give you choices you choose which way what I do and how I deal with this and whatever you choose I'll do so in verse 15 doing this for time sake skipping down he says and God sent an angel un Jerusalem to destroy it this is upon David's decision and now God sends the angel upon on Jerusalem to destroy and as he was destroying the Lord beheld and He repented him of the evil and said to the angel that destroy it is enough stay now thy hand and the angel of the Lord stood by the threshing floor of Orin the jebusite now the when God tells and I know I I know maybe one person's going to think well why didn't you just start at the beginning and we all wouldn't be like why why the threshing floor but the the very place that David is asked to go and build and set up the altars the very place this Angel Of Destruction with his sword drawn is standing the very one that is smiting Jerusalem and the angel stood by the threshing floor of or the jebusite and David lifted up his eyes and saw the angel Lord stand between the Earth and Heaven what a what an incredible image there on the threshing floor of Orin stands the Judgment angel of God with his Thorn drawn standing between Heaven and Earth on this very spot having a sword drawn in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem then David and the Elders of Israel who were clothed and sackcloth fell upon their faces and now watch what this does this image of this one standing on the threshing floor and a and a sword held out over Jerusalem standing between Heaven and Earth what a scene and David said unto God is it not I that commanded the people to be numbered even I it is that hath sinned and done evil indeed but as for these sheep what have they done oh this is a real king this is a real Shepherd this is a real leader maybe initially he said oh do whatever you want God but don't let me fall into the hands of the enemy he was more concerned about how it would look if he got captured by the enemy how it would look if his armies failed but now it Dawns on him why why would I want the Sheep to suffer it was me who sinned I was I'm the king I'm the one that did it these sheep what have they done let thine hand and I pray thee oh Lord my God be on me and on my father's house but not on thy people that they should be plagued I I want I want to say that's the image of a king that's the image of a a priest king that's the image of one who's going to take responsibility as this judgment angel stands on the threshing floor of ornin the jebusite his sword stretched out over Jerusalem he's seen the curse he's seen the plague a and David in the way is responsible for it he's guilty and people are going to suffer and he finally says you know what don't let the family suffer don't let everybody else suffer don't let the Israel suffer Jerusalem I'm the one that's guilty let me suffer so David repents David takes personal ownership of this situation he's taking responsibility and then as soon as David repents it's as we just read to verse 17 it's at that very moment that the angel Lord commands the prophet to say to David that he should go and set up an altar unto the Lord in the threshing floor of or and the sight and me we might think oh good but there's an angel of death standing there with the sword and David is told to go to that place to build an altar on the threshing floor the place where God by his Angel appeared in judgment and wrath come to this place therefore when God tells David to come to the threshing floor which we've touched on it could be looked at as as sanctification and purification and judgment separation all these different images that come before us there on the threshing floor where this Angel stood it was the proper meeting place for repentance it was the place that he had to come and start to satisfy God's Wrath I was going to use this statement a little bit later on in the sermon but it says in the Statue of a perfect man which is just ties all together with these themes building this Monument building the stature it starts off with the foundation stone Faith there's got to be a place that you begin there's got to be a starting point and here David in this time of judgment in this plague this Angel is standing there in this very specific location and he says David go there and build an altar and that that was inviting him to come to a place of judgment a place to a place of giving and it might seem to be a dreadful place but God is inviting him to come to that place and in the sermon the unfailing realities of God brother man says before you can ever get started right you got to get on the right foundation remember Solomon began to build the house of the Lord where on this very place that David's coming to on this very place where this Death Angel if we could say it that way stood Between Heaven and Earth with his sword held out over Jerusalem and stops David sees it he repents God says go to that spot and offer build an altar and offer sacrifice or it says set up an altar maybe the rest is implied in this moment and brother BR says before you could ever get started you got to get on the right foundation so when Solomon began to build the house of the Lord he had to start on the right foundation brother is pointing to In this passage what's the right foundation he says Pentecost and this is what he means by Pentecost what kind of foundation you going to lay Peter you got the keys to Heaven he said repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the the same Holy Ghost the promises to every generation that will follow afterwards to your children and to them that's a far off as many as the Lord Our God shall call that means not one stone in the temple of the Lord will not will be outside of this Foundation the foundation of repentance and the Seal of God the foundation of repentance and the baptism of the Holy Ghost but says there's the foundation if God is going to build his church Upon This Rock will I build my church it's on the foundation of Pentecost what's P PC is it shouting is it dancing oo this sounds really exciting what is it it is to repent and to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Pentecost is the holy ghost coming and sealing the soul of the believer in a new birth that's the foundation outside of that you're you're not a temple before you ever can get started you got to get on the right foundation David coming to the threshing floor to build an altar signifies this starting point to Faith this Foundation of being born again this Foundation of repentance and this Foundation that you know David being invited had Faith to believe he was going he was forgiven this invitation to offer verse 21 1st Chronicles chapter 1 verse 21 we're just in this still my image is where Solomon began to build the house of the Lord why on the threshing floor now David is told to come to this plot this spot now we already know this spot's going to be where the house of the Lord's built so we we kind of have this advantage point of going wow we know what's going to happen so when you look at this history like this is pretty significant what what is what does a site represent how how did it come to be the very place that God was going to build the house of the Lord and it says in David came to oron oron looked and saw David and went out of the threshing floor and bowed himself to David with his face to the ground and so there it would be an open area but yet there' be a covering over it and it'd be open on the sides he sees David coming there's Orin this is his land and where is he on the threshing floor and he bows himself to David with his face to the ground and then David said to ornin grant me the place of this threshing floor that I may build an altar therein unto the Lord now David's the king and he's saying Grant it now we could just stop there and be like that's right you give it to me but he says Thou shalt Grant it to me for the full price this is where you I really want you to focus and stay with me I've been putting in Pillars and laying a foundation and this this sermon is kind of like a Min sermon this this is a sermon within a sermon within a sermon this is very meta now look at what this rest upon says Thou shalt Grant it to me for the full price that the plague may be stayed from the people I want this land to build an altar but I don't want you giving me a deal I don't want to lease it I don't want to borrow it I want to buy it I don't want to buy it cheaply I want to pay the full price I don't want anyone to question my right to have it I don't want anyone to say this is not good ground whatever it's worth I want to pay for it Hallelujah an or S to David take it to thee other words I'll give it to you and let my Lord the king do that which is good in his eyes lo I give thee The Oxen also for burnt offerings and the threshing instruments for wood and the wheat for the meat offering I give it all woo let's preach a sermon on Orin hey say oh you can have it all whatever you need I'll just give it to you and the King David said to Orin nolu Hallelujah but I will verily buy it for the full price for I will not take that which is thine for the Lord nor offer burnt offerings without cost wo Hallelujah am what is this showing David could have been given it without paying for it Jesus is tempted this trid stone is tempted I'll give you all the kingdoms of the earth if you'll just Bow Down and Worship and he says I'm not going to take him without a price I'm not going to take them without paying a full price for it and when it came to building this altar on that ground David recognize are you listening this is an example to us as the house of the Lord this is an example for us who are building houses into HS there could be no shortcuts he could not cut Corners he could not accept deals he could not ask other people to do the work he could not borrow he could not go off of the the oron had labored and acquired Orin had used and bought or could not say well he could not say well I'll just use your aux and I'll just use your W wood and rely upon someone else's work David as the one that was having to build the altar said I've got to buy it I got to procure it I got an own it that even comes to the wood that's going to be burned to the oxin that'll be sacrificed to The Barley that'll be used in what kind of grain offering let me buy all that I as the worshipper I as the Builder I've got to pay the price this is what he has to do for the threshing floor now I want to join this with 1st Chronicles 8:16 and we'll maybe get into this more at a later date not today don't get nervous but in First Kings 5: 17 and 18 and the King commanded and they brought great Stones costly stones and huge stones to lay the foundation of the house they didn't just bring Stones great Stones they didn't get a good deal on it costly Stones they weren't raw they were hee to lay the foundation of the house and Solomon's Builders and herm's Builders did Hue them and the stone cores so they prepared Timber and stones to build the house later in chapter 7 it says the foundation was of costly Stones even great Stones when it speaks in Revelations about the New Jerusalem the foundation is not adorned with these precious stones it is those precious stones costly price a price to be paid work to be done so just as Solomon is laying the foundation on this very site this place of the threshing floor David is already he's already going and paying a price he's buying it full price and all the instruments thereof it says in verse 25 of 1 Chronicles 21 so David gave to Orin for the place 600 shekels of gold by weight and David built there an altar un the Lord and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings and called upon the Lord and He the Lord answered him from Heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt offering this is this is a very special happening if you want to take time to go read about it and consider these prior instances that could be referenced and here the king is offering a this sacrifice upon the Lord's command in obedience to the prophet not in Disobedience but in obedience and now after he's offered burnt offerings and peace offerings this is his repentance this is that the wrath of God would be satisfied the Lord commanded the angel and he put up his sword again under the sheath thereof it's now David had come to that place where this Angel is he risk it all he builds the altar he offers the burnt offerings in the peace offerings and when he does God sends his fire upon it and he tells the angel put your sword up my judgment's passed you see the picture you see what this means for us our threshing floor our Christ Our Redeemer and that time when David saw that the Lord had answered him in the threshing floor of or and the jebusite then he sacrificed there now watch this he's offered burnt offerings and peace offerings but now that he has been received he offers up sacrifice it's what we do right as Believers now that we've been received offer up yourselves as your bodies as a a sacrifice which is your reasonable service we offer up our lives to him it says he offers up the sacrifice in the threshing floor it keeps telling us where he's at let's just remember where is he at where is he at it's in this place well what happened what's what's going on in this place well this is the place that David had to buy this is the place that this Angel is standing and later on this is the very place it's not just going to to be an altar that's built but it's going to be the very Temple the very house of the Lord and then it says at this very moment as David is there sacrificing and David offers up sacrifice why why didn't he go to the Tabernacle for the Tabernacle of the Lord which Moses made in the wilderness and the altar of the burnt offering were at that season in the high place at gibian but David could not go before it to inquire of God for he was afraid because of the sword of the Angel of the Lord God allowed it explains to us why David wouldn't go there because that's what you where you would expect this sacrifice to be offered it's kind of showing us now in such a contrast to what would have been expected or even what would have been required that David is asked to build an altar he offers burnt offerings and peace offerings now he's sacrificing God is signifying a change from the Tabernacle in the wilderness to the temple cuz now he's saying the Tabernacle Lord is of the Wilderness is at in gibian David was afraid go there so this is why he offers sacrifice David is now offering sacrifice on the very spot where he would build his house because he says in Exodus about this Tabernacle of witness make them have them make me a sanctuary that I may dwell among them build me a house so that I can live with you and Solomon and David are saying why would God live in a tent and I dwell in a house let us build him a house that has a foundation let us build him a a a very specific place where God could live that's what the house of the Lord was no longer a tent and a tabernacle of witness now it's the temple and it was going to be built on this very Place God was moving from it God was moving into that mountain God was going to go from the heights of gibian to this place this molten pillar called Mount Mariah God was going to come to this pillar of Heaven God was going to come to this pillar of the earth Solomon begin to build the house of the Lord at Jerusalem in Mount Mar this place Mount Mariah it represents the beginning the side of the foundation of the house Solomon began to build the house at Jerusalem but not just Jerusalem in Mount Mariah there's some zip codes that are preferable sometimes people looking they looking for certain zip codes but then when you really get down you realize it's not just the ZIP code it's got to be the area and then it's got to be the subdivision and then it's got to be this one it can't just be you just don't want to live in Phoenix you want to live in Arcadia you just don't want to live in you don't really want to live in Scottdale you want to live in uh Paradise Valley or Fountain Hills or something you want to get you want to start narrowing it down right there there's there's this is where he says not not just Jerusalem but in Mount Mariah I know we've covered this even for several places and several different times even just recently in this but Mount Mariah now that's a place that's significant the Jews believed the temple was built on the very spot that Abraham offered up Isaac unto God Genesis chapter 22 he says take thy son thy only son Isaac whom you love get thee into the land of Mariah and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of and what was this mount it was Mariah Mount Mariah is where it took place to the Jews it was the very center of creation because in the center of Mount Mariah they believed was the foundation stone of creation now remember for us the foundation stone is Faith remember the foundation stone is Christ we see all these images and so God in planning for the natural Temple I want to just transition very quickly try to finish this here very soon here God tells so is Solomon is going to build the temple on the threshing floor in Mount Mariah and before that David Builds an altar in that very spot that God told him to do it and then before that God told Abraham to come to this very place to offer up Isaac on this very spot and to the Jews they believe that when God created it was the very spot where he started right the foundation stone of creation and therefore if I could put it this way the foreign knowledge of God is demonstrated in his founding acts that if God was going to build a temple he tells Abraham to go there beforehand and offer up Isaac what a type he tells David to go there in a time of a plague and offer up to build an altar and now he tells Solomon to build it in Mount Mariah and all these different images start coming before us the four knowledge of God is demonstrated in his founding acts if we come back to this thought that in the very beginning when he laid the foundations of the earth there was a place that to the Jews they believed was the first stone and it's at that spot that beginning point that Abraham comes back and sacrifices that David comes back and sacrifices that Solomon builds the temple and as I'm wanting you to catch an example of yourself brother bam says in God's only provided place of worship he's talking about then a new creation This Is Us you got to see yourself in this provided place not a denomination but to the word you are a creation of the word because the foundation stone was laid in you before the foundation of the world predestinated to be Sons and Daughters of God and upon this Cornerstone come this upon this come Stone upon Stone in each age to vindicate that word that's coming up just exactly as Jesus did in his age which is the Capstone of it all I know that paints a pretty big picture but just think how he said that in you he laid the foundation stone the Cornerstone before the world was created as he did that for us by his far knowledge laid in you the foundation stone could we not believe that God so youw even in the earth that God by his for knowledge was laying things in the earth and we see whether it be by type or just a faith of the tradition of the Jews that there was a stone laid in Mount Mariah there was a stone first before the mountain came to be around it this Stone was the beginning stone that God allowed to be pushed up there before the foundation of the world he said Upon This Rock will I build my house Upon This Rock will I build my church Upon This Rock will there be a dwelling place where I can dwell that's where the Temple of the Lord will be and then he laid before the foundation what he laid in me a foundation stone the foundation where the house of the Lord would be built and this Foundation is significant in Psalms 871 speaking of God it says his foundation is in the Holy mountains his foundation the one that he lays the what he established the one that he set forth as the Jews write about this Mount Mariah here Adam came into being about this side of this threshing floor about this Stone here Abraham Isaac and Jacob served God here the first and second temples were built upon this mountain the Ark of the Covenant was set upon the foundation stone itself that when they this is to the Jews that's what they believe in that Temple the very Ark of the Covenant sets on that stone in the holy of holies it was to be set on that stone then Solomon began to build the house of the Lord at Jerusalem in Mount Mariah the tarum the oral Bible of the Jews says Solomon began to build This Is How They recite this Solomon began to build the house of the sanctuary of the Lord at Jerusalem in the place where Abraham had prayed and worshiped in the name of the Lord this is the place of the Earth where all generations shall Worship the Lord here Abraham was about to offer his son for a burnt offering but he was snatched away by the word of the Lord and placed in his stead here Jacob prayed when he fled from the face of Esau his brother and here the angel Lord appeared to David at which time David built an altar to the Lord in the threshing floor which he bought from or the jebus site what a sight what a place God cons God laid it in creation God consecrated it God Revisited it God bringing them back over and over again to this place where the house of the Lord would be built meaning God God gives great weight and significance to foundations if this place would be so well thought of if God would secure this place if he would Solomon would build the house of the Lord at Jerusalem in Mount Mariah where Adam came forth where Abraham worshiped where Isaac worshiped where Jacob worshiped where David worshiped if God would allow have it to be in this place then God gives great weight to foundations and I close with these thoughts in 1 Timothy chapter 6 veres 17 18 and 19 as I read this in the very beginning as our text charge them that are rich in this world now I know most of us just tuned out charge them to rich in this world let me just say this this is a charge to the Bride of leod DEA because thou sayest even the even as this is written it's connected to Leo to see it charge them that are rich in this world that they be not high- minded nor trust in uncertain riches so it talks about your attitude with which you carry those things you're wealthy in a a and your trust so it's not saying that you know as it says it's impossible for a rich man or it's as hard as a rich man to enter to Heaven as it is a camel in the eye of a needle there's some that speculate that's just how hard it is and they say it's not saying the rich man can't and therefore that's what we chase after we chase after riches but this is a challenge charge them that are rich in this world that they be not high High minded nor trust in uncertain riches but trust in the Living God who gives us richly all things to enjoy so he wants us to enjoy the things that we can acquire he wants us to enjoy our single greatest asset to Building Wealth as our income he wants us to enjoy our income he wants us to save it he wants us to use it for all the right things there's a lot that can be said in that but this is the charge that they do good that they be rich in Good Works ready to distribute willing to communicate so he's actually saying you want to do good with what you have if you have wealth if you're rich in this world if you have a lot of income you have a lot of possessions do good with it he's tell he's telling Timothy to teach those that have some have some resource have some wealth that they not be stingy that they not be greedy that they not be selfish that they share this and that they give now I think it's just kind of nice that we're doing a financial report right after this this is beautiful I love how the Lord Works we've been planning this for months but he's this is what he's communic but now catch this laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come that they may lay hold on eternal life and now if I could back up he's it's actually if we could say it this way and I'll use the scripture here in a moment Earthly he's saying distribute give do good works Earthly riches scattered in faith lay up in store a sure increase of heavenly riches things that you have that God gives us richly to enjoy as we scatter them it's a certain increase of heavenly riches if I give if I give even from my poverty or or even my abundance is saying this is a sure increase of heavenly riches in Proverbs 11:24 there is that scattereth there's a man there's a person that scattereth and yet increaseth and there is that withholdeth more than as meat but it tendeth to Poverty this is what this is what Paul's building on of there's those that just give and as they give they get more they scatter they sew and then there's those that withhold more than it's necessary and they they never get they never get ahead it actually they become more poor they become more broke and he's telling do this I felt it was necessary to capture that in order to understand what he means in verse 19 do this Lay It Up in store for them or we would do this he's encouraged us to do this those of us even here in Leo deia who's rich and increased with goods and think we have need of nothing don't trust in uncertain riches don't trust in leoda but live a trusted in God who gives us all things laying up in store for themselves for yourself laying up in store for yourself a good foundation against the time to come lay a good foundation for your future not so much dictated by the things that are happening right now but just as God had this this Divine foresight and God as a Watchman whose for knowledge was demonstrated in his founding acts and we who are father of the home who knows more who's experienced things who've learned things those of us who are set as The Fifth Gospel the the king and priest in the home and those who are leading our families and those who've had an experience with the Lord he's saying you ought to lay a good foundation for the future in other words there is a price to pay in the beginning that as God demonstrated over and over again there were sacrifice on the foundation there were sacrifice on the threshing floor and then David comes and he's got to buy that site and he purchases it say oh great he bought it he was able to build an altar but one day because of the price because of the consecration it's a place that he can now build the house of the Lord but it wasn't just done overnight there's a price to pay to build a good foundation an excellent in its nature and characteristics something that's surpassing precious imminent Choice excellent in its nature and character and therefore it's well suited for its purpose it's adapted for its use therefore this is this is the simple thought I arrive at in all this if we have to have a foundation it takes work there's great sacrifice there's great work there's great investment there's a price to pay in laying a good foundation and we all must do it God help us to be better Builders God help us to be on the right foundation so we can build the right foundations could I pray for you if your head's bowed but the mic if you could come Brothers you can come to your instruments and just for this moment we'll pray our gracious Heavenly Father Lord as we bow our heads at our hearts this morning at the close of this hourong sermon recognizing many exciting things in your scripture but at the end of the day its real purpose and use is as the Bible says it's profitable for us amen this is instructive to us in all scripture given by your breath as we breathe it in Lord we want to learn from The Acts of Abraham the acts of Isaac and Jacob and now we see David in a time of judgment and great loss because of sin and provoking you to anger there's a price being paid upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem and David in that moment repents and he says let me suffer why should the Sheep suffer let it be upon me in my house and David in this moment of repentance it must have pleased you because now you have a prophet go to him with the word and say go to this place of ornon this very sight with this Death Angel standing with the sword drawn and there in the shadow of this Angel build an altar and as David comes to the threshing floor the owner the jebusite comes out and Bows himself to the king and David says I I want to buy this so I can offer to stop the plague and all the heart of or and he's says oh I'll just give it to you and if there's sacrifice I'll give you the wood and if there's Stones you need I'll give them from my field and if you need oxen you can sacrifice those whatever you need David I'll just give it to you and I'm so glad you chose David to show forth this example he didn't say oh well this is easier than I thought oh I can just piggy back off of what ornon did I could just go I could just use his work I could just borrow I could just let the prophet do it all I can just let the pastor do it all I could just let somebody else do it all but no David said uh no I want to buy it all and I want to pay a fair price far be it from me to offer up things borrowed far beit from me the one who's repenting to not offer myself and to [Music] give and he buys it pays a fair price and does all the work and the labor and he offers burn offerings and peace offerings and fire comes and consumes it you receive it David sees that the angel puts back the sword and David now knowing that judgment has been satisfied and that your wrath is passed David offers up sacrifice well what beautiful images that have already been expressed in the Tabernacle in the temple through sacrifices and offerings but now David the king offering David this type of Christ offering this moment of forgiveness he signifies this great repentance this foundation stone that we all have to come to this beginning place and then when Solomon comes to build the temple he builds it on this very floor the threshing floor with all its symbolisms Lord and with all the things that I with great joy was imparting and sharing I speak personally Lord just I wanted the people to see how special and significant this site was this Foundation was so that we could be more serious about about our works what we're laboring in and what we're working for some of us may be trying to rebuild our house on a foundation that's condemned and we got to come back down to bedrock maybe we're trying to build outside of the foundation we got to come back to Center and Lord I I express it this way in some ways I I know where I want to be maybe on Wednesday and I know what I want to preach and a couple more services coming up on on the work that needs to be done in the beginning [Music] and that there's great work that has to go into this so father I'm praying for people that I know are going to be challenged to work be more Del deliberate right now to give themselves now to sweat to sacrifice to pay to give not so much for now but for the time to come because David saw great benefit in what he was doing in the moment but my what did it mean for the time to come and to think that David and then his son Solomon are benefiting from generational sacrifice that I can do things today that perhaps will make it even easier if you T on my great-grandson what a legacy Lord that we're building and I pray for everyone here Lord as we sang the power of your love as we ministered Wednesday night on this is your house I'm hoping that everybody recognizes here today that even in the image of this Temple that was built there came a time when that very Foundation which had been corrupted was restored we read it in Ezra and Nehemiah and the rejoicing of the Levites and how you allowed it to be restored so father I say today over these people that regardless of what the foundation looks like you are a redeemer that's what the threshing floor represents Redemption so Lord we come back to you today the foundation stone but not just a stone ourselves being a living Stone and we come to you and say Lord my foundation's not right will you help me get it right and Lord may we start doing the work that is necessary as parents as young people as individuals now the hard work now for the future for that time to come CU that time will come when we'll have benefited from all the work and all the labor we put into the foundation bless your people today as we worshiped for a moment as we close this service in Jesus name amen amen
