[0:00] Uh the overall subject is judgment and
[0:02] rewards. The very specific subject this
[0:04] morning is that of crowns. And I will
[0:07] say this as we begin um if I could put
[0:10] it this way, this is the sixth service
[0:12] that we've um had on this subject. And
[0:15] so I'd like to say that all of these
[0:17] services are building um and each one
[0:19] kind of builds together and adds adds to
[0:22] I remember in uh my undergraduate uh
[0:24] work I remember taking accounting and
[0:26] and I thought I wanted a minor in
[0:28] accounting and um in that first semester
[0:30] of accounting I missed a few classes and
[0:33] showed up one day and didn't understand
[0:34] anything that was taking place and
[0:36] learned very very quickly that with um
[0:39] some subjects um each thing builds and
[0:42] builds and builds and it's not like you
[0:43] can just miss a week or miss a few
[0:45] services or miss a few classes as it was
[0:48] and um and be able just to kind of
[0:49] understand where you're at. There's some
[0:51] things that build and I'd feel that way
[0:53] about this subject although I do believe
[0:55] each service can be taken in itself and
[0:57] enjoyed but for to really uh kind of
[0:59] understand the heartbeat of the
[1:00] inspiration behind this. I think these
[1:02] services are building and building up
[1:04] and each one uh um you know complements
[1:07] the other and uh many of the quotes
[1:10] we've already shared from the message of
[1:12] the hour and many of the scriptures are
[1:13] being tied in and so we may not read
[1:15] them today. We may not even be able to
[1:17] refer to them very quickly uh but
[1:19] they're kind of all being tied in. So
[1:21] hopefully you can recall some of the uh
[1:23] the many statements we used at the
[1:25] outset to show this concept of of
[1:27] rewards for the believer. And I think
[1:30] there's today even as we continue in
[1:32] this there's a really a tremendous
[1:33] principle that uh as for me I can just
[1:36] say it's just stirred up my love for
[1:37] Christ all the more. Now, um, last
[1:41] Sunday we spoke on the day of reckoning.
[1:44] And in looking at the day of reckoning,
[1:45] we're just talking about that moment
[1:47] where we answer that time of
[1:49] accountability. Uh, where where we're
[1:51] going to answer for our particular
[1:53] calling and our responsibility as God
[1:55] has blessed you and given you things and
[1:57] distributed to you talents and gifts and
[2:00] responsibilities and and things that you
[2:01] have oversight over. uh even as a
[2:04] believer and as a Christian, there's
[2:05] that moment or that time where you're
[2:07] going to answer for what you did with
[2:09] what you received and what you were
[2:11] given. And so the day of reckoning is
[2:14] that that bema, the judgment seat of
[2:16] Christ, as we call that, as we see it in
[2:18] the scripture in Corinthians and in
[2:20] Romans, that it's that moment in time
[2:23] when we uh when our works are judged and
[2:25] as our works are judged, they're tried
[2:26] as if by fire. And the ones that stand
[2:29] out and the ones that remain, uh there's
[2:31] a reward for that service and there's a
[2:33] reward given. And in the sixth seal,
[2:36] brother Brandham uh makes this
[2:38] statement. This is how we're just able
[2:39] to transition very quickly into the
[2:41] subject of crowns. He says, "I dreamed
[2:42] about a month after that that I was
[2:44] standing one day and I was watching the
[2:46] great time that." And so you can see
[2:48] he's thinking of a in my mind he's
[2:51] thinking of a a a j a throne and a great
[2:55] time, a tremendous time. And he wants to
[2:57] distinguish it from the white throne
[2:59] judgment. So he says, "Not the
[3:00] judgment." Now he says, "I don't believe
[3:03] the bride goes to a judgment. But I was
[3:05] there when the crowns was being given
[3:08] out." And he described how there was a
[3:10] recording angel and there was Jesus
[3:12] Christ was there and the ivory stairs
[3:14] and it seemed to ascend, but everyone
[3:16] was where they could see and different
[3:18] ones were going to with this recording
[3:20] angel calling different names and Christ
[3:22] was there welcoming them. and and it had
[3:25] some language that refers specifically
[3:27] to some scriptures. And brother Brandham
[3:29] described this dream and he he kept
[3:31] emphasizing just a dream now. But I just
[3:34] want you to catch how he's acknowledging
[3:36] and referencing this time when crowns
[3:38] are being given out. So it suggests
[3:40] there's this distribution of awards or
[3:42] we talk talked about awards banquet,
[3:43] awards ceremony where this is a an award
[3:46] for faithful service and this is an
[3:48] award for looking out after this and it
[3:51] wasn't a judgment for salvation. It's
[3:53] not the crowns are not receiving eternal
[3:56] life or or sealing someone's soul or
[3:58] giving them salvation. But as brother
[4:00] Vanam even used the language, it's a
[4:02] reward for all of our efforts to please
[4:04] him. The things that we have done to
[4:07] please him and to honor him there at the
[4:09] judgment seat of Christ where all of our
[4:11] works and all of us will have to give an
[4:13] account as Paul said for what we've done
[4:16] with what we received. there we are
[4:18] rewarded for all of our efforts to
[4:20] please him and to serve him. And so
[4:24] um these remember it says this is when
[4:26] crowns are given out. I want to tie it
[4:29] in specifically with the eternal rewards
[4:33] that are available to the faithful
[4:35] saints. The eternal rewards that brother
[4:37] Brandham said that far too little time
[4:39] is spent laboring for um these eternal
[4:42] rewards. And in the church age book
[4:45] chapter 5 it says that each message to
[4:48] each age holds out an incentive to the
[4:50] believer encouraging him to be an
[4:52] overcomer and thereby rewarded of the
[4:55] Lord. So each age brother Ram describes
[4:58] it this way and I think it's really
[5:00] remarkable the way that it is described.
[5:01] Each age there's some incentive being
[5:04] held out uh to the believer and the
[5:06] incentive that's being held out is an
[5:09] encouragement. And I think the word
[5:11] choice is important. It's not um it's
[5:13] not the motivation, but it's an
[5:15] encouragement. We have uh we have other
[5:17] motives, and we'll even touch on it here
[5:18] in a little bit on how the Bible is even
[5:21] looking at what kind of is underpinning
[5:23] the reasons why you're doing certain
[5:25] things. And it's that kind of heart
[5:27] attitude or that heart purpose that God
[5:29] is looking at that what the thing that
[5:31] motivates you that God's looking at to
[5:32] determine whether or not he's going to
[5:34] reward you. And so he's saying that he
[5:36] holds out an incentive to the believer
[5:39] that encourages him to overcome. And in
[5:42] the book of Revelation, we see that in
[5:43] each age, he that overcomes is rewarded.
[5:46] And there's a reward for him that
[5:48] overcomes. And he says to overcome and
[5:50] thereby be rewarded of the Lord. And
[5:54] these crowns, as we're looking at the
[5:56] subject of crowns, the crowns are not
[5:58] the motive, but they're the means of
[6:00] encouraging the believer to labor.
[6:04] And it's a means of saying, "I know that
[6:05] there's a crown to be gained. I know
[6:07] that there's something to be won. And
[6:09] and I know there's uh in a true sense,
[6:11] we say, well, you have eternal life. You
[6:13] never have to answer for your sins.
[6:14] They've been judged in Christ. You're
[6:16] sinless. You're justified as if you
[6:18] never did it in the first place. Um
[6:20] you're going to live in eternity. You're
[6:21] going to be um together with Christ um
[6:25] in an unending age." And we would say,
[6:27] "Really?" And we'd say, "All right, I
[6:29] don't need anything else." in in in a
[6:31] true sense that that could be our our
[6:33] heart's response is you know what I
[6:35] don't need anything else if that if
[6:36] that's true Lord then then I I I have
[6:40] more than I deserve and there's a
[6:41] satisfaction with it but God wasn't
[6:44] happy just to leave it at that
[6:46] God says in addition to these things
[6:48] that accompany salvation um I'm going to
[6:51] promise you rewards as a means of not
[6:54] motivating you but encouraging you
[6:56] because your motive is going to be love
[6:58] your motive is going to be the grace
[6:59] that you received your motive after
[7:01] having been saved, you mean there's a
[7:02] way that I can show thanks? Let me have
[7:04] at it. There's a way that I can work for
[7:06] him. And so there's a uh these crowns
[7:10] that are given as this motiv motivation,
[7:12] as this incentive, as this reward. I I I
[7:16] I'll say this at this point and because
[7:17] I think it's a good time to say it.
[7:20] They're symbolic uh largely symbolic
[7:22] because maybe brother Benham even
[7:24] touchedes on it in different places
[7:26] where it's not that you're going to be
[7:27] wearing a literal crown. Uh and there's
[7:30] going to be some manifestation and some
[7:32] literal application of this. But I don't
[7:34] know that we ought to be thinking
[7:36] literally like a Burger King crown or
[7:38] something like that that we're all just
[7:39] going to be collecting uh in heaven. But
[7:42] there's a it's there's a lot of
[7:43] symbolism related to it and just exactly
[7:46] how that may manifest itself. I think
[7:48] that may be a beautiful mystery that'll
[7:49] unfold in the moment. But brother
[7:51] Brandham just says there's a time when
[7:52] crowns are being given out. And the
[7:56] details that I'd like to share today out
[7:58] of the scripture and even the emphasis
[8:01] uh is uh it's necessary uh to make this
[8:05] truth of judgment and rewards and the
[8:07] truth of rewards clear. A and I want you
[8:10] to be certain that God is mindful of
[8:12] what you do. And he's a rewarder of all
[8:15] all that you do to seek him and to honor
[8:17] him and to do his will. And if I can put
[8:18] it this way, to manifest him
[8:21] that where he is made manifest, where
[8:23] he's expressed and his nature is is is
[8:26] conveyed that pleases him because he has
[8:28] no means of identifying himself. He has
[8:31] no means of conveying himself. He has no
[8:32] means of being heard and felt and no
[8:34] means of touching and seeing except by
[8:37] your your body. as brother Jack
[8:39] mentioned on Wednesday night through
[8:41] flesh. He's going to be manifested. He's
[8:43] manifested through our flesh. And so I'm
[8:45] hoping to kind of unleash a real pure
[8:46] ambition in our lives even further uh
[8:49] that we could serve him with all that's
[8:50] in our hearts. And if you could just pay
[8:54] pay close attention this morning. I'm
[8:55] going to be reading a lot of scriptures
[8:56] that I know you're already familiar
[8:58] with, but if you could pay close
[8:59] attention, I want you to notice how the
[9:01] meaning uh I think it it's for me it
[9:04] just gets clearer and clearer, but the
[9:06] meaning is more pronounced when you
[9:08] recognize the things that are being
[9:09] talked about refer to something very
[9:11] specific and that it actually has
[9:13] application in in a future blessing or
[9:16] future promise. a a and that day of
[9:18] reckoning or that judgment seat of
[9:20] Christ, this future time when crowns are
[9:22] given out and that it's not in any way
[9:25] placing this category that if you do
[9:27] this, you'll get saved one day.
[9:29] And I think it's sometimes maybe
[9:30] misapplied a little bit. So there's
[9:32] scriptural principles that we can look
[9:34] at very quickly if you want to turn to
[9:36] second Timothy chapter 2. Scriptural
[9:38] principles of a crowning uh for labor, a
[9:42] crowning of service that is rendered.
[9:44] And so again, we want to recognize the
[9:47] timing of this, the timing of this
[9:49] crowning. Uh there are blessings in this
[9:51] life. And there's an application for
[9:53] some of these scriptures in this life.
[9:54] But then there's also one in the in the
[9:56] life to come. But the timing is after
[9:59] the rapture before the millennium that
[10:01] this is that time when brother said in
[10:03] this dream, it was the time when crowns
[10:04] are given out. And you can see this in
[10:07] scripture that we're all gathered
[10:08] together and we have to answer and be
[10:10] beyond the curtain of time. It's exactly
[10:12] what is mentioned that we're there
[10:14] waiting for when they would be gathered
[10:15] together to Christ and the person told
[10:18] brother Brandham and you'll be judged
[10:20] and he'll be judged with his people. So
[10:22] in second uh Timothy chapter 2:5 and if
[10:25] a man also strive for masteries it means
[10:27] endures or contends yet he is not
[10:30] crowned except he strive lawfully. So a
[10:34] man who who is fighting who's contending
[10:38] uh he is crowned. So, this word crown
[10:40] there, it means adorned or honored with
[10:43] a crown. And I'll admit that I had never
[10:46] taken um every scripture that I could
[10:49] find in the New Testament and studied
[10:50] out in detail. I'd never taken time to
[10:53] unpack a lot of this though ministered
[10:55] on this subject before. And I thought,
[10:57] you know what? I'm going to I'm going to
[10:59] look at every instance where there's a
[11:00] crowning or a crown or something is
[11:02] crowned a and and I was certain that
[11:05] there's going to be some maybe hidden
[11:06] mystery and some Greek word like you
[11:08] guys won't believe it. Uh it's using all
[11:11] the same word and it's and it's even
[11:13] conjugation of the name Stephen and it's
[11:16] that Stephanu and it's just referring to
[11:17] a crown which is encircled or adorned
[11:20] and it it's look thinking of something
[11:22] upon the head. crown of the head,
[11:24] something in circles. It's in it means
[11:26] to be honored with the crown. It says
[11:28] crowned, honored with the crown. And a
[11:30] crown is just the very same word. It's
[11:32] just referring to something that
[11:34] signifies honor or praised. A crown is a
[11:37] mark of royalty or in some instances
[11:39] some sort of exalted rank. And you'll
[11:42] find it referred to in the scripture and
[11:44] it specifically had this meaning at the
[11:46] time. women. It's even used uh precisely
[11:48] this way as the wreath uh that was given
[11:50] as a prize to those who were victors in
[11:52] public contest. And it was placed upon
[11:55] their head and the one wearing the
[11:57] wreath, it encircled the crown of their
[11:59] head. It was called a crown. Uh it was
[12:01] they were identified. This is the one
[12:02] who won. This is the one who prevailed.
[12:05] And so the use of the term crown in the
[12:09] scripture by Paul and these writers, it
[12:11] refers to the eternal blessings that are
[12:13] given as a prize to the believer who
[12:15] labors for Christ. And Paul is saying
[12:17] that he that strive for the masteries um
[12:20] he's not going to be crowned unless he
[12:22] strives lawfully. So this crown
[12:24] represents a reward. In 1 Peter chapter
[12:27] 3:es 8 and 9, it says, "Finally, be you
[12:30] all of one mind, having compassion one
[12:33] of another. love his brethren. Be
[12:35] pitiful. Be courteous. Maybe be pitiful
[12:38] will sounds like, "Oh, I could do that."
[12:41] Uh,
[12:42] but it means it's a little bit
[12:43] different.
[12:44] You might be like, "Brother Aaron, you
[12:45] do that. Awesome." Like you're pitiful.
[12:48] Says, "Finally, be of all of one mind."
[12:49] I want you to recognize what's being
[12:51] said here because he's saying, "This is
[12:52] the way that we ought to act." This
[12:53] becomes ambition to be of one mind. Have
[12:56] compassion one for another. love his
[12:57] brethren, be merciful or pitiful, have
[12:59] compassion, be courteous, not rendering
[13:02] evil for evil or railing for railing,
[13:05] but contrary wise blessing. So these are
[13:07] all uh kind of things that this is what
[13:09] we ought to do as believers. These are
[13:11] kind of measuring sticks in each
[13:12] situation. You say, well, are we of the
[13:15] same mind? And if someone's in a
[13:16] situation, is the way that I'm feeling
[13:18] for that person, am I having compassion
[13:21] or am I despising? Am I judging? Am I
[13:23] being too harsh? Am I loving his
[13:25] brethren? Am I being pitiful, courteous?
[13:28] Uh do I render evil for evil or railing
[13:30] for railing? If someone rails against
[13:31] me, do I rail back? Uh um do I do I
[13:34] render evil for evil? These are all
[13:36] tremendous challenges of one con one's
[13:38] conduct and attitude in Peter the whole
[13:41] underpinning of it and kind of the
[13:43] incentive for it is he says knowing that
[13:45] you're there unto called. So you're
[13:47] called to this. This is what you're
[13:48] called to do that you should inherit a
[13:51] blessing. and just inherit the blessings
[13:54] mean be celebrated with praise that if I
[13:57] am of one mind and I have compassion I
[13:59] don't respond to railing with railing
[14:01] and I don't render to evil evil and I do
[14:03] all these things that I've done then I
[14:05] will inherit a blessing or there will be
[14:07] an acknowledgment for a job well done
[14:11] and that may seem to be uh you kind of
[14:13] might be thinking I don't know about
[14:15] that seems kind of odd but the idea is
[14:18] that even in those quick interactions
[14:20] that you may have in those situations
[14:22] you come into where you know you did it
[14:24] right and you know you did the right
[14:26] thing there's a blessing for that
[14:29] there's an acknowledgement there's a
[14:31] praise that comes with it and brother
[14:32] Brandham refers to those different times
[14:34] where our actions are going to be played
[14:36] back
[14:37] right and and there and everyone's going
[14:40] to and these things are going to be
[14:41] played back and and you're going to have
[14:42] you're going to see the things you said
[14:43] and the things you did and you're going
[14:44] to have to answer and these things are
[14:46] be are going to happen you know there's
[14:48] it's a fearful thing to have that played
[14:50] back at the white throne judgment
[14:52] But if you just kind of invert a little
[14:54] bit or just kind of kind of do the
[14:56] backward reasoning, uh, when you stand
[14:59] there, there's not a record of your sin.
[15:02] When you stand there at the judgment
[15:03] seat of Christ, they're not going to be
[15:04] playing back all the lies you told. You
[15:06] be like, "Whoa, wait a minute. How'd
[15:09] that get through the filter? I thought
[15:11] we had lie block on. How how is how is
[15:13] this getting through?" You know, who's
[15:15] in charge of the IT around here and the
[15:16] security that that should Jesus, that
[15:18] should have never made it in there. I'm
[15:19] so sorry you had to see that. No, it
[15:22] might be in and symbolic symbolically
[15:25] playing back all the times you had the
[15:27] right word, all the times that you
[15:29] represented the nature and spirit of
[15:31] Christ. That's the idea that ought to be
[15:33] gathered from this. And Peter calls it
[15:35] inheriting a blessing. And Paul is
[15:37] saying that we will be crowned if we
[15:39] strive lawfully. So there's an honor and
[15:42] a praise to be received by the believer
[15:44] who conducts themselves in this way. As
[15:47] the Bible says here, compassion, one
[15:49] mind, courteous.
[15:51] And this crowning is not dependent on
[15:53] merely laboring, but also laboring
[15:57] lawfully, which would imply in agreement
[16:00] with the law or in agreement with the
[16:03] word. And I would say not just
[16:04] technically, but in the spirit of it.
[16:07] And so there's a way that we want to
[16:09] labor and we labor that is there's a
[16:12] fidelity with the nature of Christ. that
[16:15] is that not what you want to be to
[16:16] somebody else.
[16:18] We don't want to be the law. Uh and we
[16:20] don't want to be just ourselves and we
[16:23] don't want to just be technical and we
[16:25] don't want to just be um rigid and we're
[16:27] just doing it because well it's like
[16:29] robotic. But I want to be the heart of
[16:31] God. I I want to be the expression of
[16:32] Christ. I want there to be um some sort
[16:35] of inviting. even if it is in correction
[16:38] and even if it's making a stand I want
[16:40] to do it that even in my stand in my
[16:42] conviction in my willingness to stand
[16:44] for what is right that there's something
[16:46] that projects Christ in that
[16:49] and so there's a way that we do it where
[16:51] it's in agreement with Christ the word
[16:53] it's it's lawfully
[16:55] and this word lawfully means the a law
[16:58] or rule that produces a state approved
[17:01] by God so we are crowned when we strive
[17:06] or endure
[17:07] in a way that produces something that is
[17:10] approved by God. So even in what Paul is
[17:12] saying, it's kind of like it almost kind
[17:14] of states the obvious and everything
[17:15] begins to agree that we labor, we
[17:18] endure, we strive so that it can be
[17:20] approved by God and the approval is the
[17:22] crowning is the praise
[17:25] and how we labor and how again not just
[17:30] u how we labor. even go to so far as to
[17:32] say what our motivation is or what our
[17:34] attitude is characterizes whether our
[17:37] labor merits this praise or merits a
[17:41] crown. And again, I'm I'm providing a
[17:43] lot of these just so we can continue to
[17:45] build um the subject of rewards. I
[17:47] mentioned before that we did uh uh
[17:51] accountability and um responsibility and
[17:54] some of these subjects were just ways of
[17:56] uh using some sort of framework to bring
[17:58] in all these different scriptures
[18:00] instead of just kind of printing it out
[18:02] and just reading to you these things. I
[18:04] trust the Holy Spirit is weaving
[18:05] something together that's engaging. In
[18:08] Matthew chapter 6:es 1 to4, notice how
[18:10] Christ places this. He says, "Take heed
[18:13] that you do not your alms before men to
[18:15] be seen of them. Otherwise, you have no
[18:18] reward of your father which is in
[18:19] heaven. I in plain language doing your
[18:23] alms
[18:24] uh begats a reward from your father
[18:26] which is in heaven. Other words, this is
[18:28] something that they ought to have done,
[18:29] but yet it's still something that God
[18:31] promises he will bless and there's a
[18:32] reward. But he's saying don't do it
[18:34] before men so that you'll be seen. In
[18:36] other words, just because you did your
[18:38] alms, you did it to be seen and
[18:40] therefore it's not rewarded. Whereas you
[18:42] ought to have done it just because you
[18:43] were asked or because you knew that it
[18:45] would please the Lord. And if you had
[18:47] done it for that reason, therefore God
[18:49] would reward you. He says, "Therefore,
[18:50] when thou doest thine alms, do not sound
[18:52] a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites
[18:54] do in the synagogues and in the streets,
[18:56] that you may have glory of men." So
[18:58] there's the recognition, the praise, the
[19:00] pat on the back. He says, "Verily, I say
[19:01] unto you, they have their reward. But
[19:04] when thou doest alms, let not thy left
[19:06] hand know what thy right hand doeth,
[19:09] that thy alms may be in secret." Kind of
[19:12] good for those of us who our left hand
[19:13] gets us always in trouble. But it says
[19:16] that thine alms may be in secret and
[19:18] that thy father which seeth in secret
[19:20] himself shall reward thee openly.
[19:24] Now taken together with many other
[19:25] scriptures, you can see that this this
[19:27] has application to that moment in time
[19:29] where everything you've done for Christ,
[19:31] though it may not have been noticed here
[19:33] on earth, there's a time where the
[19:35] father is pleased to honor you before
[19:37] all those that are gathered before the
[19:39] judgment seat of Christ. And as brother
[19:40] Brandham described it in the sixth seal,
[19:42] he says just a dream now. But it gave
[19:44] this image of your name is being called
[19:46] and people are patting you on the back
[19:47] saying God bless you. God bless you. A
[19:50] and for laboring this way, laboring that
[19:52] way, brother Joel, you there may nobody
[19:54] may know how many times you went to the
[19:55] reservation, but God knows. And there's
[19:57] a labor that undertakes and people don't
[19:59] know it and they don't recognize it and
[20:00] they don't hear it. But there's a time
[20:02] when he says, "You know what? Because
[20:04] you did it for the right reasons and not
[20:06] because your name was on a marquee, not
[20:07] because you you knew you would get get
[20:09] noticed for it, but you going to be
[20:11] rewarded for the right kind of labor."
[20:14] And that's I believe that kind of fits
[20:16] with this striving to lawfully. There's
[20:18] a crown for that. Jesus says there's a
[20:20] reward openly for that.
[20:22] Revelations chapter 23, it says, "And I
[20:24] will kill her children with death."
[20:25] Whoa, that escalated quickly.
[20:28] All right, maybe we should have just
[20:29] went with 23b.
[20:31] It says, "And all the churches shall
[20:33] know that I am he which searchth the
[20:36] reigns and hearts." Kind of that your
[20:37] gut. What's making you do this? What's
[20:40] motivating you? What's your inspiration?
[20:42] What's your ambition? What's your motive
[20:43] and objective in order to accomplish
[20:45] this what you see to be the word of God?
[20:47] And why do you um why do you do missions
[20:50] work? And why do you go overseas? And
[20:52] why do you share these things or tell
[20:54] these things or accomplish these things?
[20:55] I I just in my mind I think of all the
[20:57] different things that maybe we could do
[20:59] even to the extent that people said hey
[21:00] we cast out devils in your name we did
[21:02] many wonderful works and the idea was
[21:04] what it never showed up on my radar
[21:07] I didn't you know I said I I I didn't
[21:10] see it why because they honored him with
[21:12] the external things
[21:14] but the heart was tried and found
[21:17] lacking says I so I'll search the motive
[21:20] and the ambition the objective I'll
[21:21] search the reigns of the hearts and I
[21:23] will give unto every one of you
[21:25] according to your works.
[21:27] So, it brings in this idea that, well,
[21:29] he's going to judge your works and your
[21:30] work's going to be rewarded. But before
[21:32] I just throw out accolades for a job
[21:35] well done, because I see the the
[21:37] product, I want to also see your work.
[21:40] And and all those that take math,
[21:42] homeschool or otherwise, cringe when you
[21:44] have to show your work, right? And and
[21:46] you say, "Well, how did you get this
[21:47] answer?" Well, you know, I worked
[21:49] really, really hard. And no, no, show me
[21:51] your work. Well, I threw it away. I
[21:54] erased it. It was really, really messy.
[21:56] It's not just getting the right answer.
[21:58] Do you know how to get the right answer?
[21:59] And wouldn't that be great? Sometimes we
[22:01] I know that when it comes to fishing,
[22:03] it's good to keep a journal. I haven't
[22:05] done it in so long. I think I'm aging
[22:07] rapidly. That there's uh there's times
[22:09] when you catch a if you really want to
[22:11] catch more fish, you need to kind of be
[22:13] aware of how you caught that fish. Yeah.
[22:15] Right. You're like, "Well, what was the
[22:16] temperature like and what was the water
[22:18] temperature? And what kind of line was I
[22:20] using? And how was I working the bait?
[22:22] Was the moon underfoot or overhead? I'm
[22:24] telling you, it's complex.
[22:27] That there's a lot of things you take
[22:28] into consideration. I remember one time
[22:30] I went on a guided trip and be in our
[22:32] preparation for it. The guy said, "Ah,
[22:33] people make a big deal about color and
[22:35] you don't need to worry about coloring.
[22:36] You just you got to know this. You know
[22:38] that." He was really setting himself as
[22:39] an expert. And then the very first bank
[22:41] we pulled up to says, "Now, you really
[22:42] want to throw something with the red
[22:43] fleck in. It does real good on this."
[22:44] I'm like, "Great. I've wasted all my
[22:46] money." Very first thing out of his
[22:48] mouth, he contradicts himself. But when
[22:49] it comes to fishing, the more you learn
[22:52] from what produced an accomplishment,
[22:55] it's better to easier to replicate it.
[22:57] Same thing with recipes and cooking and
[22:59] all sorts of things. And uh and when you
[23:02] make your own rubs and you're smoking
[23:03] meat, uh there's a there's a product,
[23:07] man, really good. That tasted good.
[23:08] What's in this? You're like, man, I wish
[23:09] I'd have written it down.
[23:10] Yeah.
[23:11] And so, there's something to be said
[23:13] about knowing the the formula that
[23:16] really makes it work for God. And it has
[23:18] to do with our motive and our objective
[23:20] behind it. 1 Corinthians chapter 4:5.
[23:23] Therefore, judge nothing before the time
[23:24] until the Lord come. That that that's uh
[23:29] speaking to that day of reckoning. And
[23:31] there's a judging. Don't do it before
[23:33] it's time. You don't judge something. We
[23:34] have to be very very careful that we
[23:36] don't judge something too soon. Uh there
[23:39] may be some people may I I've I've felt
[23:41] this way for myself that you may look at
[23:43] my family, look at my children and you
[23:46] may be quick to judge me and and in my
[23:48] defense I might say don't judge me yet
[23:50] as a father. I'm still working on it.
[23:52] But even more, don't judge my children
[23:54] yet.
[23:55] They're still a work in progress. God's
[23:57] still working on them.
[23:58] And so there's a there's a thought here.
[24:00] Don't judge something before it's time.
[24:01] And then Paul says until the Lord come.
[24:03] Well, when would that be? It's the Bema.
[24:05] It's the judgment seat of Christ. She
[24:06] says, "Who will bring to light the
[24:08] hidden things of darkness and will make
[24:10] manifest the counselss of the heart?"
[24:13] And he says, "And then shall every man
[24:15] have praise of God." It doesn't make
[24:18] sense unless we're talking about the
[24:19] judgment seat of Christ where we will
[24:22] all stand before him and be held
[24:24] accountable and have to answer for our
[24:26] works. And it's then they just give you
[24:29] praise, give you the honor, give you the
[24:31] accolades, give you the crown, which is
[24:33] the acknowledgment and the reward for
[24:35] the believer who has labored
[24:37] effectively. And he's when he's doing
[24:38] it, notice he's judging the councils of
[24:40] the heart. Luke chapter 6:35. I hope
[24:43] you're able to look at these not just
[24:45] merely as amplifying lawfully and not
[24:49] just amplifying our motive and
[24:50] objective, but see that how they're
[24:52] referring to a time when the Lord will
[24:54] judge. A moment and an instance where
[24:57] our works are judged and to render every
[24:59] man according to his works and according
[25:00] to his motive behind it. Luke chapter
[25:02] 6:35 to me is another perfect example of
[25:06] if we conduct ourselves appropriately,
[25:08] God will honor it. He says, "But love
[25:09] your enemy. Love ye your enemies
[25:12] and do good and lend hoping for nothing
[25:15] again and your reward shall be great."
[25:18] Amen.
[25:19] The reward is and again I I will not I
[25:23] hope I'm not saying such a way to where
[25:26] and and that can be a danger for a
[25:28] minister. Sometimes you get kind of
[25:29] tunnel vision. You get so amp focused on
[25:31] one thought that you could be say in
[25:33] such a way to where it feels like oh
[25:35] well I guess that's it. That's it. No,
[25:36] there's there's blessings. you you reap
[25:38] what you sow in this life. And there's
[25:40] things that God will do and reward you
[25:41] in when you labor in this life, but the
[25:43] love your enemies, do good, lend, hoping
[25:45] for nothing again, and your reward shall
[25:47] be great. This applies even to that
[25:49] reward of the believer at postrature,
[25:52] new body, theophony, glorified body,
[25:54] united together, standing before Christ.
[25:56] And there's a reward for that. Remember
[25:59] was told to brother Brandham, a huge
[26:00] portion of heaven awaits thee. That
[26:03] there's a great reward that is in store.
[26:05] Your reward shall be great and ye shall
[26:07] be the children of the highest. Now,
[26:09] it's not saying that you will become the
[26:11] children of the highest, but you will
[26:13] reflect and manifest that you are of him
[26:16] who is the highest. Then you will by by
[26:19] loving your enemies, doing good and
[26:21] lending without hoping anything in
[26:22] return. It speaks to motive and
[26:23] objective. Again, says there's a great
[26:25] reward because you have portrayed and
[26:27] expressed the very nature of the highest
[26:30] because he says for he is kind unto the
[26:32] unthankful and to the evil. Again, it's
[26:35] mo it's in it's it's incentivizing and
[26:38] encouraging us to labor correctly to be
[26:40] Christlike and to manifest the right
[26:43] kind of attitude and judgment in every
[26:45] situation as we as much as we are able
[26:47] to and yield to because he says then
[26:50] you'll declare that you are God's
[26:53] because he's kind to the unthankful and
[26:56] the evil.
[26:56] So you ought to be kind to the
[26:58] unthankful and to the evil.
[27:01] And can we all agree
[27:04] it ain't easy,
[27:07] right? You know, it's uh it's
[27:11] uh it might be easier to just not say
[27:15] anything. Just going to bite my lip.
[27:17] Just not going to say anything. I'm just
[27:18] going to walk away. I'm not going to do
[27:20] anything. But this says to love and do
[27:23] good and lend.
[27:25] And so it's not just, you know, I'm just
[27:27] going to run away from this. I'm just
[27:29] going to keep quiet. It's actually the
[27:32] nature of God to uh when you feel that
[27:36] uncction when you when it's inspired and
[27:37] you know it's the Lord, it's it's the
[27:39] nature of God to do the right thing.
[27:43] Now, I hope that's a a good good part of
[27:46] the foundation this morning looking at
[27:48] these different scriptures that speak
[27:49] about striving and and rewarding and the
[27:52] crown. Paul says, "If we strive
[27:54] lawfully, there's a crown." Jesus says,
[27:56] "There's a reward. there's a judgment of
[27:58] your of your striving and there's going
[28:00] to be a great reward for how you strive
[28:02] and every man will have praise of God in
[28:04] that time in that moment uh when your
[28:06] your in motive and your objective has
[28:08] been examined. Now in the scripture
[28:12] um there are in the New Testament is
[28:14] what we'll look at. There are different
[28:15] descriptions of crowns in the New
[28:17] Testament and there's not much detail
[28:20] and there's some uh writers or com
[28:23] commentaries and different theologians
[28:25] that a lot of academic study on these
[28:27] things and I just didn't have the
[28:29] appetite for it. So I I never really
[28:31] delved into what other people had to say
[28:33] about it. But I studied the message of
[28:35] the hour still going through every
[28:37] instance I can find where brother uses
[28:39] crown and the conjugation of it and but
[28:42] in the scripture it's fairly easy to
[28:43] find in the New Testament all the
[28:44] different places that there's a
[28:46] description of a crown or what seems to
[28:48] be a specific crown reference and there
[28:51] are five different ones five different
[28:54] descriptions. Some break it out as
[28:55] distinct crowns. There's an
[28:57] incorruptible crown. There's a crown of
[28:59] life. There's a crown of righteousness.
[29:01] There's a crown of rejoicing and a crown
[29:03] of glory. But in looking at it, there's
[29:06] a way that you could just look at it as
[29:07] this is just symbolic language to
[29:09] describe all the same state of the
[29:11] believer in that blessed eternal state
[29:13] in a new body uh with eternal life
[29:15] forever. And it makes a lot of sense. Um
[29:18] but yet you see in each one of these
[29:19] instances, there's a phrase that's used
[29:21] for something specific. And so I'm not
[29:24] trying to create a very rigid structure
[29:26] where we have the the five crowns and
[29:28] and and you know, have you checked your
[29:30] scorecard lately and how many stars do
[29:33] you have on in in that ledger? It's not
[29:35] to create a rigid structure. But when
[29:38] you see that the scripture uses five
[29:39] different ways of describing a crown or
[29:42] five different crowns perhaps, then it
[29:44] tells you just how varied and just how
[29:47] much more nuance there is to scriptural
[29:49] principle than sometimes we get in our
[29:51] minds. It's like, oh well, the crown of
[29:52] glory is the crown of righteousness,
[29:54] which is the crown of life, which is
[29:55] incorruptible. And maybe there's more to
[29:57] it than, oh, if you've got eternal life,
[29:59] you've already been crowned with these
[30:00] things. 1 Corinthians chapter 9 25
[30:06] says, "And every man that striveth for
[30:08] the mastery is temperate in all things.
[30:11] Now they that do it to obtain a
[30:12] corruptible crown, but we an
[30:15] incorruptible."
[30:17] So he's saying we which labor fervently,
[30:20] the word strive there is actually
[30:21] different than the one that he uses when
[30:22] he's writing to Paul, the strive for
[30:23] masteries. But the striveth for mastery
[30:25] here is a word that means labors
[30:27] fervently. And he that's laboring
[30:29] fervently has a goal in mind, an
[30:31] objective he's wanting to accomplish. So
[30:32] he's temperate in all things. And he's
[30:34] referring to the the competitors in
[30:36] games, in public games. It's like, I
[30:38] want to wear that wreath and I want to
[30:41] stand before everybody and I want them
[30:42] to know though there may be no value in
[30:45] the wreath. I want them to know that I
[30:47] was the greatest in this endeavor. So,
[30:49] I'm going to labor fervently. And in
[30:51] laboring fervently, it's not so much
[30:54] what I exert, but it's also those things
[30:56] that I do not exert myself in. So, I'm
[30:58] temperate in all things so that I could
[31:00] gain a wreath that'll fade and corrupt.
[31:03] And Paul is saying in the same way that
[31:05] these contestants and these Olympians
[31:07] and those that engage in these public
[31:08] contest uh train and train and train and
[31:12] restrain and restrain and restrain so
[31:14] that they can win a wreath. He's saying
[31:15] they do it to obtain a corruptible
[31:17] crown. But he's saying that we strive
[31:20] for the mastery not and we are temperate
[31:23] not for a corruptible crown but an
[31:25] incorruptible crown.
[31:27] Amen.
[31:28] It's literally an immortal crown. It's
[31:32] not the crown of immortality, but it's
[31:34] an eternal reward that never perishes
[31:36] because we do not labor
[31:39] per se that we might be rewarded with a
[31:41] new body. That's been guaranteed to us
[31:44] by the baptism of the Holy Ghost, but we
[31:47] strive for the mastery that we might
[31:50] receive what Paul says is an
[31:52] incorruptible crown.
[31:55] And so there's the the description of an
[31:57] incorruptible crown. The next one is the
[32:00] crown of life. In James chapter 1:12
[32:04] says, "Blessed is the man that endureth
[32:05] temptation, for when he has tried, he
[32:08] shall receive the crown of life, which
[32:11] the Lord hath promised to them that love
[32:13] him."
[32:14] That's not a passive love. This is an
[32:17] active love.
[32:19] It's that love that would even allow one
[32:21] to endure temptation. So it comes back
[32:22] to am I enduring temptation because I'm
[32:24] thirsty for the crown or have I endured
[32:26] temptation because I love the Lord and
[32:28] thereby he rewards me with the crown.
[32:30] Blessed is the man that endureth
[32:32] temptation. That means he's patiently
[32:34] patiently tried and tested. It says for
[32:37] when he is tried completely different
[32:39] word.
[32:40] So it's not that blessed is the man who
[32:41] endureth temptation for when he is
[32:43] tempted. It's blessed is the man who
[32:45] undergoes that trial that that trial
[32:48] that testing that temptation for when he
[32:50] is approved.
[32:53] When he's accepted as pleasing, he shall
[32:55] receive the crown of life. So temptation
[32:59] is the earthly trial. The approval is
[33:01] the result of the heavenly trial. You go
[33:04] through an earthly trial and you suffer
[33:05] and you endure and you're bullied and
[33:07] you're trying to persuade to do this and
[33:08] you say no and you're trying to be
[33:10] intimidated to this and you say no and
[33:12] and you're trying to be encouraged to do
[33:14] something wrong and you say no and you
[33:15] you make a decision and you suffer or
[33:17] you do what's right and you suffer and
[33:19] all these different things are
[33:20] happening. It says when we've endured
[33:21] the temptations, there's going to be a
[33:24] time when all your striving and all your
[33:26] enduring is going to be approved by God.
[33:29] The Bible says he shall receive the
[33:32] crown of life.
[33:34] It results in a crown of life for the
[33:36] ones who are patient and withstand
[33:39] testing. Revelations 2:10, it says,
[33:42] "Fear not these things which thou shalt
[33:44] suffer. Behold, the devil shall cast
[33:46] some of you into prison that you may be
[33:48] tried and you shall have tribulation 10
[33:51] days. But notice how God speaks to these
[33:53] faithful martyrs. But thou faithful unto
[33:55] death, I will give thee a crown of life.
[34:00] They have not inherited eternal life,
[34:02] and they're not being crowned with life
[34:04] because they chose to shed their blood,
[34:06] and that's how they're going to live
[34:07] forever. But is it not in addition to
[34:10] those who have believed and received his
[34:12] life and withstand even unto death that
[34:15] he says, I will crown them with life
[34:18] that you may be tried. It's tempted.
[34:20] It's tested. It speaks of this
[34:22] tribulation, this affliction and
[34:23] anguish. And those who are faithful to
[34:26] death, it says, receive a crown of life.
[34:30] So you have Paul referring to an
[34:32] incorruptible crown
[34:35] that we strive, we strive and we labor,
[34:37] not for the crown, but we strive and
[34:39] labor and we're temperate. And in that
[34:42] way that we live, God rewards us with an
[34:44] incorruptible crown. And then James
[34:47] writes that when we endure temptation
[34:49] when we we will be found approved by God
[34:52] and receive a crown of life. And then
[34:54] Jesus says that those who are faithful
[34:56] unto death, the martyrs as it's
[34:58] referring to will receive a crown of
[35:00] life.
[35:02] Brother Bam in the church age book
[35:03] chapter 4 says, "And I will give thee a
[35:06] crown of life." It's just quoting
[35:07] directly from Revelations 2:10. Now
[35:09] brother Brandham writes, "Since not even
[35:11] a cup of cold water given in the name of
[35:13] the Lord fails to receive a reward."
[35:15] Remember we read this? I I know you
[35:17] remember just exactly the moment when I
[35:19] read this in part one. I know. And it
[35:21] makes me feel so good. You're thinking,
[35:23] why didn't he read this in part one? But
[35:25] I did. I believe. He says, "How great
[35:27] shall be the reward to him who gives his
[35:29] life as a martyr for the name of Jesus
[35:31] the Lord Jesus Christ." So if God's
[35:34] going to reward a cup of water, how much
[35:37] greater is there going to be a reward
[35:39] for he who gives his name his life in
[35:41] the name of Jesus Christ? So there's
[35:43] this this idea of these additional
[35:45] rewards and this recognition of service.
[35:47] Perhaps we can get a small idea if we
[35:49] compare this crown with the crown one in
[35:52] a race. In 1 Corinthians 9:24, Paul
[35:54] says, "Know you not that they which run
[35:56] in a race run all, but one receiveth the
[35:58] prize, so run that ye may obtain." A
[36:02] crown given to the winner of the Olympic
[36:03] race was a garland of olive branches. So
[36:06] it's that encircles the crown of the
[36:08] head. But the crown spoken of here in
[36:11] the revelation given to a martyr is the
[36:14] crown of royalty. So you have the crown
[36:17] of olive branches. But now brother Bram
[36:19] contrasts the martyr's crown with the
[36:20] crown of royalty. So the crown of life
[36:23] is not just what we might think oh
[36:25] eternal life but it's a crown of
[36:26] royalty. Says Jesus calls it the crown
[36:28] of life. The one crown is for those who
[36:31] have striven.
[36:33] The other is for those who have given.
[36:36] Both crowns are incorruptible. they will
[36:39] not perish.
[36:40] Now, are you a little bit like, wait,
[36:42] huh? Because I was.
[36:46] And he's referred to the prize that Paul
[36:50] is telling us that we ought to run to
[36:52] obtain.
[36:54] And that's an incorruptible crown. And
[36:56] that crown is for those who have
[36:58] striven.
[36:59] Right? There's a one crown for those who
[37:01] have striven. And there's another crown
[37:02] for those who have given what? Given
[37:05] their lives. So, Brother Bam is breaking
[37:07] this out that Paul's referring to a
[37:09] crown, an incorruptible crown that he
[37:10] gives to those who strive, but now he's
[37:13] given he's talking about a crown of
[37:14] royalty and a crown of life that he
[37:15] gives to those who have given their
[37:17] life. And he says they're both
[37:19] incorruptible. They'll not perish. But
[37:22] one is for the striving and one is for
[37:23] the giving. They will not perish. The
[37:25] winners of the worldly race, however,
[37:27] race of life will lo soon lose the joy
[37:29] of the plottits of the world. Their
[37:31] glory will fail.
[37:33] Right?
[37:35] But those who have given their those who
[37:38] give their lives for God and then he
[37:40] says either by daily striving or
[37:42] shedding their blood as the crowning
[37:45] sacrifice of their lives will be given
[37:47] the crown of life. He says all too
[37:50] little time is spent on laboring for the
[37:52] eternal rewards of God. So recognize
[37:54] that the context of what he's talking
[37:56] about. There's a crown to be gained.
[37:57] There's crowns to be gained. the
[37:59] recompense of God is too lightly
[38:01] esteemed. If we believe in the reality
[38:03] of the resurrection of the body and an
[38:04] eternal kingdom of substance, then we
[38:06] ought to lay up in heaven those good
[38:08] treasures that are available to the
[38:11] faithful saints.
[38:13] The crown in Revelation is a crown of
[38:15] royalty. It's a crown of life. Paul,
[38:16] he's talking about striving for a crown.
[38:18] And he says they're both incorruptible.
[38:20] And if we strive daily strive, we give
[38:23] our lives and striving and shedding of
[38:25] blood. There's a crowning of the crown
[38:28] of life.
[38:31] Brother Brandham refers to the scripture
[38:33] 1 Corinthians chapter 9:es 24 and 25.
[38:35] Know you not that they which run in a
[38:37] race run all but one receiveth the
[38:40] prize. So run that you may obtain.
[38:42] Obtain what? The prize.
[38:44] He's he's literally telling us run so
[38:47] that you can obtain the prize. Make it
[38:49] your goal and your ambition. Make it
[38:51] something uh that you're conscious of.
[38:53] And brother Ram is saying too little
[38:54] time spent laboring for them and the
[38:56] recompense is too lightly esteemed. And
[38:58] we ought to lay up these good treasures
[39:00] which are these rewards available to the
[39:02] faithful saints. If I could put it this
[39:03] way, there's crowns available for you to
[39:05] acrue.
[39:07] And every man that striveth for the
[39:09] mastery is tempered in all things. Now
[39:10] they do it to obtain a corruptible
[39:11] crown. But we an incorruptible the prize
[39:14] is an incorruptible crown. Amen.
[39:18] So, we have an incorruptible crown. We
[39:20] have the crown of life. Then there's the
[39:21] crown of righteousness in 2 Timothy
[39:23] chapter 4 7 and 8. I think I can go a
[39:26] little bit quicker here because we've
[39:27] covered this. I have fought a good
[39:28] fight. I have finished my course. I've
[39:31] kept the faith. Henceforth, there's laid
[39:33] up for me a crown of righteousness which
[39:35] the Lord, the righteous judge, shall
[39:38] give me at that day. What day? The day
[39:41] of the Lord. The day of reckoning, the
[39:42] day of the Beimma, the day of the
[39:44] judgment seat of Christ. and not to me
[39:45] only, but unto them also that love his
[39:48] appearing. He's literally saying that I
[39:51] shall receive a reward in recognition of
[39:53] my righteous conduct. He says, I
[39:56] finished my course. I've kept the faith.
[39:58] And so, it was my labor was just, my
[40:00] labor was right. My works, the fruits of
[40:04] righteousness. It's not the condition of
[40:05] my soul because that's his
[40:06] righteousness. But now the working out
[40:08] of that life in my life is now
[40:10] manifested and declared proper conduct,
[40:13] right attitude, good works and and
[40:15] abundant fruit. And my fruit has
[40:16] remained. And because I finished my
[40:18] course and I kept the faith and I was
[40:20] not a castaway, he has laid up for me a
[40:22] crown of righteousness, a reward given
[40:25] in recognition of a job well done or the
[40:27] right kind of conduct. saying, "In the
[40:30] day of accountability, I I'm going to
[40:32] receive a new reward of honor, a new
[40:34] reward of praise, not a new
[40:36] righteousness in that." He's already has
[40:38] that being justified. He already has
[40:39] that being sanctified. He already has
[40:41] that being perfected, but now it's a
[40:43] crown of righteousness.
[40:46] And and I do believe it's appropriate to
[40:48] recognize that it represents the
[40:50] crowning of immortality and a body
[40:51] that'll never die. That's a righteous
[40:53] body. It's a a pure body.
[40:57] But this crown of a new body, if I could
[40:58] say it this way, it'd be enough for us,
[41:01] right?
[41:02] I mean, let's just be honest.
[41:04] If God said, "You know what? I'm going
[41:05] to give you a perfect body." We'd say,
[41:06] "Sign me up.
[41:08] It it'd be worse than a a food line at a
[41:10] a youth meeting, right? Elbowing people
[41:13] out of the way." You know, we'd be I'm
[41:15] this is mine. I'm going to get it. And
[41:18] God is saying, "Hey, perfect, sinless,
[41:20] never going to die. It's going to be a
[41:21] perfect picture of health and
[41:22] everything." And said, "Hey, you know
[41:23] what? That's enough. You know, just let
[41:24] me be there in a perfect body." I be
[41:26] like, "Hey, hey, look at me." Right? But
[41:28] it's an up. It's not enough. God
[41:30] promises more blessings.
[41:33] I I mean, we know God's simple, right?
[41:38] God hides himself in simplicity. And
[41:40] God's very simple. But then, haven't you
[41:42] noticed as you've gotten to know him in
[41:43] his word, you're just like, "Wow,
[41:44] there's no end to this."
[41:46] And you look at the human body and we
[41:48] see how it it works. And then you start
[41:50] looking at the way it functions, like,
[41:51] "Wow, this is a beautiful mystery." And
[41:52] you look at creation and the stars and
[41:54] the planets, the human body and nature
[41:56] and everything, you realize God is so
[41:57] intricate and so detailed and his mind
[41:59] is beyond figuring out. Well, he's done
[42:01] the same thing in terms of what he has
[42:03] planned for us and and how that he
[42:06] recognizes and honors and uses his word
[42:08] to think that well I thought we were
[42:10] just going to have eternal life and I
[42:11] thought I would just have a body that
[42:13] never died and God says whoa whoa whoa
[42:15] whoa whoa I have not seen nor ear heard
[42:16] neither has it entered into the heart of
[42:18] man. can't even imagine the things that
[42:21] God has prepared for them that love him.
[42:24] I think it's a specific reference to
[42:27] these crowns and these rewards.
[42:30] So, there's your crown of righteousness.
[42:32] Then there's the crown of rejoicing. I
[42:34] think this is a um a beautiful one. It
[42:37] says in 1 Thessalonians chapter 2 19,
[42:39] for what is our hope or joy or crown of
[42:42] rejoicing?
[42:44] And this scripture even means more to me
[42:45] as of late than even how I've used it in
[42:47] the past. So I trust you you really
[42:49] focus on this because it's just a
[42:52] another a deeper way maybe even a more
[42:54] correct way of seeing this than we've
[42:56] emphasized in the past. Says are not ye
[42:58] e even ye in the presence of our lord
[43:00] Jesus Christ at his coming.
[43:02] There's definitely this takeaway that
[43:04] when he comes uh what is notable about
[43:07] that is being in his presence and
[43:09] there's a lot of truths that build uh to
[43:11] that in through scripture. But Paul's
[43:14] crown of rejoicing, he's saying, "What
[43:17] is our what is my it's the it's the
[43:19] royal we as it were. What is my hope?
[43:21] What is my joy or crown of rejoicing?"
[43:23] Paul's crown of rejoicing in that day in
[43:25] the day of Christ was their salvation.
[43:29] His crown of rejoicing. So he's going to
[43:31] have rejoicing. A and he knows that he
[43:34] has he has rewards. But now he's
[43:37] actually saying that at at the time of
[43:39] his coming when we're gathered together
[43:40] in his presence, I am going to have a
[43:43] crown of rejoicing because you're going
[43:45] to be in his presence too because I know
[43:48] your security in him and those who've
[43:50] been sealed into his body on that day
[43:52] when we're gathered together and I'm
[43:54] think about beyond the current time I'm
[43:55] gathered with my people. This is going
[43:57] to be a crown of my rejoicing. A crown
[43:59] of rejoicing rather is the fact that
[44:01] you're there also.
[44:04] the fruits of his ministry is another
[44:06] way of saying it will be a crown of
[44:07] rejoicing when they're gathered to
[44:09] Christ. And brother Brandham says it in
[44:11] a number of places. He says in one place
[44:13] if I ever have if I ever have one when I
[44:16] get there he's talking about a crown. He
[44:17] says you'll be the that jewel outshining
[44:20] part in the crown of my ministry when
[44:22] it's crowned you'll be that jewel.
[44:25] Think about that. That there's this
[44:27] there's some sort of representation of
[44:29] souls one
[44:31] and Paul recognizing these are my
[44:32] people. When the angel when the the
[44:34] voice spoke to brother Brandham said he
[44:35] said are these Brandhams? He says no but
[44:37] these are your converts. These are your
[44:39] people. These are gems and jewels and a
[44:41] crown. Paul says my crown of rejoicing
[44:44] is going to be the fact that you're
[44:45] there
[44:46] as jewels and gems in my crown. He says
[44:48] if I ever have a crown you'll be the
[44:50] outshining part, a jewel in my crown. He
[44:52] says another place, I know you, my
[44:54] people, my jewels in the crown.
[44:57] And a third place, and there's a number
[44:59] of places where he says, he says, there
[45:00] are stars in my crown. He says, the same
[45:02] way they are in your crown, my minister
[45:03] brothers. So, it's not just Paul or
[45:05] brother Brandham.
[45:08] A crown of rejoicing
[45:10] is those souls that you have helped win.
[45:14] Brother Bram even refers to it in one
[45:15] place and forgive me for kind of
[45:17] chopping it up and paraphrasing that
[45:19] that there is a a representation of a
[45:22] star in heaven when there's a soul saved
[45:24] when there's a a child that comes to God
[45:26] and sealed in the body that there's a
[45:28] star that hangs in heaven and is
[45:30] represent heaven. He says in your name
[45:31] wrapped up in it. You familiar with
[45:33] that? maybe using the language just a
[45:34] little bit differently, but see there's
[45:36] some representation that that's a jewel,
[45:38] that's a gem, that's an outshining part.
[45:40] And it's in that crown of rejoicing
[45:43] that's related to faithful service to
[45:45] win souls and to reach out to the lost.
[45:48] Paul says in Philippians 4:1,
[45:49] "Therefore, my brethren, dearly beloved
[45:51] and long for, who is it? The brethren,
[45:54] my joy and crown.
[45:57] So stand fast in the Lord, my dearly
[45:59] beloved." Think about what he's saying
[46:01] to the Philippians. He's writing to the
[46:03] people and he calls him his crown.
[46:07] Why? Because he knew that they would be
[46:08] there at the presence of the Lord. That
[46:10] it would be a crown of rejoicing. The
[46:11] people were my crown.
[46:14] Are you keeping track? Are we at number
[46:15] five?
[46:16] Who's taking notes? The fifth would
[46:17] crown of glory. 1 Peter chapter 5:es 1
[46:21] to4.
[46:23] I hope we're building to a a climax here
[46:26] with you. 1 Peter chapter 5:es 1-4. The
[46:29] elders which are among you I exhort who
[46:33] am also an elder and a witness of the
[46:35] sufferings of Christ and also a partaker
[46:36] of the glory that shall be revealed. To
[46:39] me this even gives another way of re
[46:41] recognizing
[46:43] the glory that's to be revealed in us
[46:45] that is proportional or commiserate with
[46:47] the suffering that we have endured.
[46:50] That when we have suffered and we've
[46:52] taken it patiently that there is a
[46:54] weight of glory that's being
[46:56] accumulated.
[46:57] Right? Isn't that what Paul tells us?
[46:59] There's a measure of suffering, brother
[47:00] Ram says, left to us that when we take
[47:02] it patiently, that we're going to
[47:03] receive a a a glory.
[47:06] And so the sufferings of this present
[47:07] time are not worthy to be compared, if I
[47:09] could put it this way, the the reward
[47:10] that we're we're going to receive
[47:12] because we suffered. You think about
[47:14] your heartaches and your sorrows and the
[47:16] things that you went through a and you
[47:18] come through it on the other side and
[47:19] you've endured patiently and you've had
[47:21] the right attitude. You bit your tongue
[47:23] and you've done the right things. Just
[47:24] think you've been acrewing.
[47:27] crowns, if I could say it that way,
[47:29] rewards. And so he said, "I want to be a
[47:32] partaker of the glory that shall be
[47:33] reveal revealed." So now this these are
[47:35] his instructions to elders. Feed the
[47:38] flock of God which is among you. Take in
[47:40] the oversight thereof. So you want to
[47:42] feed and take oversight. Now he says,
[47:44] now he speaks to the motive, not by
[47:46] constraint,
[47:48] but willingly, not for filthy lucer, but
[47:51] of a ready mind. Right? So notice how
[47:54] it's it's judging us much deeper and
[47:56] much greater than just wow, you know,
[47:57] bless God, I'm the pastor and I'm the
[47:59] one feeding and if you don't like what
[48:01] you're eating, then it's because you're
[48:02] feeding on too much of the world. It's
[48:04] no, there's just a there's a different
[48:05] heart and attitude that comes with it.
[48:07] And if that's the case, maybe that's
[48:09] what I do need to say. But he says,
[48:10] "Feed the flock of God which is among
[48:12] you. Take an oversight thereof, not by
[48:13] constraint, but willing, not for filthy
[48:15] lucer, but of a ready mind. Neither is
[48:17] being lords over God's heritage, but
[48:18] being examples in samples to the flock."
[48:21] Amen. Now I think this is this is
[48:24] tremendous instruction. Uh this is what
[48:26] we ought to look for in leadership. This
[48:28] is what leaders ought to hold themselves
[48:30] accountable to. It's a beautiful
[48:31] scripture describing uh a leader the
[48:34] difference between a leader and a
[48:35] manipulator. The difference between one
[48:37] that has a real heart of a pastor and
[48:39] one who just occupies the office. But it
[48:41] it's speaking to the shepherds
[48:44] speaking to those that take oversight.
[48:46] And and this is how you ought to do it.
[48:48] And and I believe that this can be
[48:50] helpful too in this regards. I I've been
[48:53] thinking a lot about this this subject
[48:54] matter in this way. U I I think I
[48:57] preached a sermon one time called was it
[48:59] God and did they have the Holy Ghost?
[49:01] Because there's times that things happen
[49:03] in our lives and they're very
[49:04] significant and noteworthy and then
[49:06] later on other things happen and go well
[49:07] was that even the Lord we start to
[49:09] question it. And there's people that
[49:10] have tremendous impacts in our lives and
[49:12] God uses them and we we're not
[49:14] questioning it was God, but then their
[49:16] lives to end up in a train wreck or they
[49:18] deny something, they do something awful
[49:20] and you start saying, "Well, was it ever
[49:21] even God?" And you start saying, "Oh,
[49:23] well, did they even have the Holy
[49:24] Ghost?" And I think those are valid
[49:25] questions.
[49:26] And so, do you guys have time
[49:30] the miracle of the cloud? Glory. I could
[49:32] probably pull the notes up right now.
[49:35] But I want to say this. This can help us
[49:37] to understand that sometimes we see
[49:40] people that God has used and we have
[49:41] confidence in them and they they've
[49:43] blessed our lives and we believe them to
[49:44] be true men of God. But in the process
[49:47] of time and whether it be failing health
[49:48] or mental problems or circumstances,
[49:51] they become hard and they harden their
[49:52] heart and become bitter and they become
[49:54] more like Sauls than they do uh um with
[49:57] the heart of David. And we we think we
[49:58] just want to completely write them off.
[50:00] Well, you don't judge anything before
[50:02] it's time. But know this, God will hold
[50:04] them accountable for how they led.
[50:06] That's right.
[50:08] And it's certainly true that the wrong
[50:10] kind of leadership results in this
[50:12] because he says, he says, "If you do
[50:14] these things, and when the chief
[50:15] shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive
[50:18] the crown of glory."
[50:20] Amen.
[50:20] That fadeth not away.
[50:22] Amen.
[50:24] This is a reward for the servants, for
[50:26] the stewards that lead correctly with
[50:27] fidelity, who have a heart for the
[50:29] sheep, who are leading in reflective of
[50:32] the nature of Christ and in harmony with
[50:33] his with his desire.
[50:36] So I think this just is a perfect spot
[50:38] to think about. Can you see this truth
[50:41] now
[50:42] that this is the this is the only place
[50:44] that this phrase is used and it's used
[50:46] of laboring correctly and if you do it
[50:48] God has reserved the chief shepherd is
[50:51] going to give you a crown of glory that
[50:53] fadeth not away.
[50:54] Amen.
[50:55] Peter's being very precise about this
[50:57] being very specific to you shepherds who
[51:00] can lead the right way. There will be a
[51:03] crown of glory given to you that fades
[51:05] not away when the chief shepherd shall
[51:06] appear.
[51:08] It's not that they again it's not that
[51:09] they finally receive eternal life
[51:11] or that they u ultimately receive a new
[51:14] body because of this but it is a reward.
[51:17] These crowns these five different crowns
[51:19] or descriptions are describing and
[51:21] referring to rewards that are available
[51:23] for the believers.
[51:24] It is in some ways I said it was
[51:26] symbolic and we have to kind of think
[51:28] deeply about this uh to uh to not just
[51:31] cabbage down on one uh framework
[51:35] but it is praise and honor
[51:38] some recognition for all of our efforts
[51:40] to please him. If you fulfilled your
[51:43] calling, if you if you did what you were
[51:45] responsible for, if you said the right
[51:47] thing and there's been times even you
[51:49] think about the the principle uh like
[51:51] sister Hadtie, right, when she said the
[51:52] right thing and it opened up a channel
[51:54] and we see the power of God working in
[51:56] that particular instance, brother Bam is
[51:58] there beyond the curtain of time and his
[51:59] dog is licking his hand and and his
[52:01] horse is running up to him and what did
[52:03] he he refer it to? Reward for my
[52:05] service,
[52:06] right?
[52:07] Like that was something that was a crown
[52:08] to him. It was a reward to him for
[52:10] faithful service.
[52:12] And in Job chapter 19:9, I know this is
[52:15] going to sound kind of harsh, but he
[52:16] says, "He hath stripped me of my glory
[52:18] and taketh the crown from my head." So
[52:21] notice how dishonoring or shame, being
[52:24] deprived of something is reflected in uh
[52:27] glory being removed, a crown being taken
[52:29] from a head, a praise being withheld,
[52:31] kind of a lower estate being represented
[52:34] by having his glory stripped and the
[52:35] crown taken from his head. that that
[52:37] helps us to understand that glory being
[52:39] stripped and a crown being taken away
[52:41] helps us to understand what's going to
[52:42] be added to us.
[52:44] Right?
[52:47] In the image of a crown
[52:50] Jesus even saying in Revelations 3:11,
[52:52] "Behold, I come quickly. Hold that fast
[52:54] which thou hast that no man take thy
[52:57] crown."
[52:58] These are the images of the crown. These
[53:00] are the things that are being expressed
[53:01] about these crowns. I believe this is
[53:02] these things relate to what brother B
[53:04] was talking about say is that time when
[53:05] crowns are given out.
[53:10] I'm I'm comfortable with uh my pacing
[53:12] this morning in the time that we're at.
[53:14] And so I'm going to continue Luke
[53:15] chapter 19 12 to 19. I just have just a
[53:19] little bit more here and we maybe I'll
[53:22] pick up on this Wednesday night. He said
[53:24] therefore here's this parable. A certain
[53:26] noble man went into a far country to
[53:28] receive for himself a kingdom and to
[53:30] return. So that's important to catch. A
[53:33] noble man is receiving new jurisdiction,
[53:35] receiving a new kingdom, receiving new
[53:37] cities. So he's a nobleman and catch it
[53:39] in the story. He's a noble man who has
[53:41] those who are with him who are who are
[53:43] his servants. But now he's going to go
[53:45] away and there's going to be a new
[53:46] kingdom
[53:48] with new cities. See, and this future
[53:51] kingdom. And now he's given this parable
[53:54] and he's going to come back. And he
[53:56] called his 10 servants and delivered
[53:57] them 10 pounds and said them, "Occupy
[53:59] till I come." So here's 10 pounds minus
[54:02] or however you want to look at it in the
[54:04] scripture. Occupy till it come. But his
[54:06] citizens hated him and sent a message
[54:07] after him saying we will not have this
[54:09] man to reign over us. And it came to
[54:12] pass that when he was returned having
[54:14] received the kingdom. So now there's
[54:16] this new jurisdiction, this new kingdom.
[54:19] And you also just I just I I need to go
[54:23] quickly here. He says, "Then he
[54:24] commanded these servants to be called
[54:26] unto him to whom he had given the money
[54:28] that he might know how much every man
[54:31] had gained by trading."
[54:36] And the day trader said,
[54:38] "Then came the first, saying, Lord, thy
[54:41] pound hath gained 10 pounds." And I
[54:44] almost instinctively want to say, "Yeah,
[54:45] amen." It's it's money, right? Thy
[54:49] poundath gained 10 pounds. He said unto
[54:50] him, "Well, thou good. Well, thou good
[54:53] servant, thou hast been faithful and
[54:55] very little. Catch this. Have thou
[54:58] authority over 10 cities."
[55:01] And the second came saying, Lord, thy
[55:02] pound hath gained five pounds. And he
[55:04] said, "Likewise to him." Right? Good.
[55:07] Good job. Well done. Be thou also over
[55:09] five cities.
[55:11] So, are we tracking the parable that
[55:13] this nobleman had had had he had an
[55:15] authority, had a domain, he was
[55:17] reigning. He put servants instead and
[55:19] they were there overlooking his affairs
[55:21] and reigning and he gave them each a
[55:23] distribution of talents to see how much
[55:25] money they would uh to see how they
[55:27] would look after it. And so when he came
[55:29] back what's happening is the the
[55:31] faithful servants are receiving greater
[55:33] stewardship according to the capacity
[55:36] that they demonstrated.
[55:37] Right?
[55:38] And he says to see how much they had
[55:39] gained by trading. That means thoroughly
[55:42] uh and and and earnestly undertaking a
[55:44] business for the sake of gain. Right?
[55:47] like he's he's wanting to say, "Hey, I
[55:49] gave you a gift. I gave you talents
[55:52] where hey, say amen if you want to go to
[55:53] lunch." I mean, what I mean is, "Amen
[55:57] me, right? You guys are awesome. Amen.
[56:01] If you want me to finish today, cuz
[56:04] there this is exciting." And someone
[56:05] said, "Amen." I don't know how to take
[56:07] that. I'll be honest with you. Um there
[56:09] there there's something so beautiful
[56:11] here. here. If we could just kind of get
[56:12] in the rhythm of this a
[56:14] and and and think about what Christ is
[56:16] wanting to represent in this beautiful
[56:17] picture that he's saying, I'm going to
[56:20] give you I'm going to send and I want
[56:22] you to think very literal about this. I
[56:24] go to prepare a place for you.
[56:26] He sends back his Holy Spirit. He gives
[56:28] gifts to men. He gives you the Holy
[56:30] Ghost. He gives you blessings in life.
[56:32] He's given you opportunities. But he
[56:34] says, I'm going to come again one day
[56:35] and there's going to be there's going to
[56:37] be a millennial reign. There's going to
[56:38] be new heavens and new earth. There's
[56:39] going to be a never- ending kingdom.
[56:41] There's going to be things greater
[56:42] beyond what we do here and now. He says,
[56:45] "But I'm going to give you these things
[56:47] and then I'm going to come back and I'm
[56:48] going to look at what you did
[56:50] with what I gave you."
[56:52] And their faithfulness was determined by
[56:54] that trading. Here it's the
[56:56] multiplication of the pounds
[57:00] and there was different degrees of
[57:02] future rewards, right? Proportional to
[57:04] the fidelity that they demonstrated in
[57:06] this in in that service. So he says, "I
[57:09] gave you 10 pounds. You've doubled it."
[57:11] He says, "You know what?" And it seem,
[57:13] it might seem kind of odd, but he's
[57:14] saying, "I'm going to give you
[57:17] stewardship over 10 cities."
[57:19] Now, just think now, think of what he's
[57:21] trying to show them, the image that's
[57:23] being expressed here. And I think this
[57:24] is the template that we can use to
[57:26] relate to judgment and rewards. As we
[57:28] read last time in Matthew 25, well done,
[57:30] thou good and faithful servant. Thou
[57:32] hast been faithful over a few things. I
[57:34] will make thee ruler over many things.
[57:36] enter thou into the joy of thy Lord. So
[57:39] the Lord has a joy. He has a dominion.
[57:41] He's inherited a new kingdom. All things
[57:43] are his. And he's saying, I have this
[57:45] glory. I have this dominion. I have this
[57:47] kingdom. I have all these cities and
[57:49] this responsibility. You've demonstrated
[57:51] to me and I can and I want to place you
[57:54] now in authority as a jointly with me
[57:57] over these things. This is the image
[57:59] that's being expressed.
[58:00] Amen. Christ is teaching that rewards
[58:03] will be proportional to our faithfulness
[58:05] with the talents he's given us here on
[58:07] earth
[58:08] with the things that we know are his
[58:10] gifts.
[58:11] He's going to reward us proportionally
[58:13] to how we use that gift. And those of us
[58:16] who have the gift of eternal life, those
[58:18] of us who have spiritual gifts and
[58:19] ministering gifts and gifts of the
[58:21] spirit and gifts in the body, he's going
[58:22] to judge us as to how we used those
[58:25] gifts. Amen.
[58:26] In Luke 14 12 to 14, then said he also
[58:29] to him that bade him. When thou makest
[58:32] to dinner or supper, notice again, this
[58:34] is the proportionality. Call not thy
[58:36] friends, nor thy brother, neither thy
[58:37] kinsmen, nor thy rich neighbors, lest
[58:40] they also bid thee again, and recompense
[58:42] be made thee. In other words, why do you
[58:44] invite the guy over to dinner who you
[58:46] know makes the best brisket in the
[58:48] church,
[58:51] hoping that they invite you over? Right?
[58:54] I know it's simple tonight. We're just
[58:55] having pizza, but I don't cook as good
[58:57] as you.
[59:00] Right? He's saying, don't don't be that
[59:03] guy
[59:04] when you make a dinner or supper and you
[59:06] you only invite the people that are
[59:08] prestigious or elite or make you look
[59:10] good. But he says, "Lest thou bid thee
[59:13] again to make recompense." But this is
[59:14] just speaking to the heart. I know maybe
[59:16] it means different things in these days
[59:17] than it did then, but the principle is
[59:19] still the same. When they'll make us to
[59:20] feast, call the poor, the maimed, the
[59:23] lame, the blind. Be charitable.
[59:26] Look out for the ones who aren't maybe
[59:29] uh what we might say the cool kids or
[59:31] whatever, the ones that have an
[59:32] opportunity. And you only invite the
[59:34] people over uh into your home who's, you
[59:36] know, who who has a nice home that you
[59:38] can be invited into. Say, look after
[59:40] those who don't have even the resources
[59:42] to host you, like the ones that ought to
[59:44] be hosted or the ones who can't host.
[59:46] Amen.
[59:47] And I'm not trying to make specific
[59:48] application to this, but I think God can
[59:50] do with your hearts uh as necessary if
[59:52] that is what even the Lord would do. But
[59:54] thou when you make a feast, call the
[59:55] poor, just recognize what he's saying,
[59:56] the mame, the lame, the blind, and thou
[59:59] shalt be blessed
[1:00:01] for they cannot reward thee.
[1:00:04] For thou shalt be rewarded. And I know
[1:00:06] I'm saying a different word, but this is
[1:00:08] what it means when brother Brandham
[1:00:09] said, "The recompense of God is too
[1:00:10] lightly esteemed." Right?
[1:00:13] They can't reward thee. They cannot
[1:00:15] recompense thee. When are we going to be
[1:00:17] recompensed? For thou shalt be
[1:00:18] recompensed? At the resurrection of the
[1:00:21] just.
[1:00:21] Amen.
[1:00:23] Why didn't I just read that at the
[1:00:24] beginning,
[1:00:26] right? It's just so clear. just so plain
[1:00:31] that there's going to be a recompense, a
[1:00:33] reward at the re first resurrection
[1:00:37] when the bride and the elect through all
[1:00:39] ages are raised and and we who are alive
[1:00:42] and remain our bodies are changed and we
[1:00:44] go to meet our theophies and those who
[1:00:46] are already in their theophonies, they
[1:00:47] come to meet their glorified body and
[1:00:49] we're all gathered together and brother
[1:00:51] Bam describes it that we're going to be
[1:00:53] gathered together to our messenger and
[1:00:54] under the messenger different ones
[1:00:56] gathered together and we're all
[1:00:57] gathering together for that great
[1:00:59] climactic moment, that meeting in the
[1:01:01] air, and then in this wedding supper
[1:01:03] time, and in this season, there's going
[1:01:05] to be the distribution of crowns.
[1:01:08] Jesus says here, just know that when
[1:01:11] you've done these things unselfishly,
[1:01:14] when you've labored and you served and
[1:01:16] you've done things without expecting
[1:01:17] anything in return, as a matter of fact,
[1:01:18] you looked out after those who couldn't
[1:01:20] even give you anything back. Therefore,
[1:01:22] showing that you had the right motive in
[1:01:24] doing it, he says they may never be able
[1:01:26] to repay you and you may never even be
[1:01:28] repaid in this life, but you're going to
[1:01:30] be rewarded at the resurrection of the
[1:01:32] just.
[1:01:33] Amen.
[1:01:34] And as we think about this in our
[1:01:36] closing of how this nobleman went into a
[1:01:39] far country, was going to leave and go
[1:01:41] be establish a new kingdom and a new
[1:01:44] dominion.
[1:01:45] I want you to look at this as a type of
[1:01:47] what God has given to us
[1:01:50] and the things that he's given to us.
[1:01:52] This eternal life, these gifts, these
[1:01:54] blessings that he's given it and that we
[1:01:56] ought to use it then to lay up treasures
[1:01:58] in heaven.
[1:02:00] So it's where this nobleman looked down
[1:02:01] and he said, "Oh my, you're I gave you
[1:02:04] this and I've come back and I want to
[1:02:06] see what you've done with this, what
[1:02:07] you've used and what you've traded with
[1:02:09] and and what it looks like now." that in
[1:02:11] some way just as a type that Christ
[1:02:12] could say, "I gave you eternal life. I
[1:02:15] gave you freedom from sin. I loosed you
[1:02:17] from the law of sin and death and you
[1:02:19] used that life to live for others. You
[1:02:22] used that life to do this. You used this
[1:02:24] gift to do that." And he says, "I gave
[1:02:26] you life. If I listen, I gave you life
[1:02:29] invisibly. I gave you life internally. I
[1:02:32] gave you life permanently forever. Hid
[1:02:35] from the world. And you took that
[1:02:37] singular eternal life and you multiplied
[1:02:40] it through abundant fruit and you
[1:02:42] amplified it through your life and you
[1:02:44] let it become not just an eternal
[1:02:45] possession but you let it become an
[1:02:47] external expression and others saw me on
[1:02:51] a daily uh basis. I met you and sealed
[1:02:54] you in a moment in an instance. I saved
[1:02:56] you and I put my life inside of you but
[1:02:59] you through the process of time have
[1:03:01] amplified that life by yielding to it.
[1:03:04] Amen. Praise God.
[1:03:06] And in doing so, you've earned rewards
[1:03:10] by the exercise of his grace. I mean,
[1:03:12] think about it. By the exercise of his
[1:03:14] grace, I mean, what kind of arrogance
[1:03:16] would that servant have? Walked up there
[1:03:19] and he says, "Let me see what you've
[1:03:20] gained by trade." He says, "Look at
[1:03:22] this. I got 10." And he's like, "Well, I
[1:03:26] gave you five." He's like, "Yeah, and I
[1:03:28] doubled it."
[1:03:30] It it it wouldn't be registering, right?
[1:03:34] But think about the one who says you you
[1:03:36] gave me you gave me 10 or you gave me
[1:03:38] five you gave me 10 and I doubled it or
[1:03:39] you gave me five and I I got five more
[1:03:42] and he says oh man that's awesome you
[1:03:44] did great I'm going to give you 10
[1:03:46] cities
[1:03:48] and you know what the servant would say
[1:03:50] like well this was yours
[1:03:54] I I mean I I could have never come up
[1:03:56] with 10 pounds had you not even given me
[1:03:59] the five and the author or the 10 to
[1:04:01] begin with and the authority to use it
[1:04:02] and I there's no way I could have done
[1:04:04] this. Th this is these are yours
[1:04:07] anyways.
[1:04:08] I I used the things you gave me. I used
[1:04:11] the things you taught me. I was your
[1:04:12] servant. It it afforded me certain
[1:04:14] opportunities. I I could have never
[1:04:16] opened those doors. I could have never
[1:04:17] done those things. And so it's the
[1:04:19] exercise of his grace
[1:04:23] that we've manifest his life, manifested
[1:04:25] his life and multiplied our reward.
[1:04:30] And so as we built it in the beginning
[1:04:34] through Revelations chapter 19,
[1:04:38] I want to close on this and and the
[1:04:40] musicians you could come.
[1:04:46] The Bible says that on him is written
[1:04:48] the name called the word of God
[1:04:52] and and he's coming. He's going to rule
[1:04:54] with the rod of iron. This is the time
[1:04:55] of the millennium.
[1:04:57] So this is after the rapture, the
[1:04:59] resurrection of the just. This is after
[1:05:01] the wedding supper. This is before we
[1:05:02] get into the millennium where Satan is
[1:05:04] bound for a thousand years. And there's
[1:05:05] going to be a ruling and reigning with
[1:05:06] the rod of iron. We are going to rule
[1:05:08] and reign with him in the millennium. So
[1:05:10] keep that image in mind. Maybe we'll
[1:05:11] touch it on Wednesday night that there's
[1:05:12] going to be we are going to reign. And
[1:05:14] so this is preparation for reigning.
[1:05:16] That this image of rewards and crowns
[1:05:18] and authority and expansion of
[1:05:20] stewardship is built into this idea of
[1:05:22] judgment and rewards. And it says that
[1:05:23] on his thigh, a name written, King of
[1:05:25] Kings.
[1:05:26] Yeah. and Lord of Lords.
[1:05:28] Who is this faithful and true? It's
[1:05:30] Christ.
[1:05:31] Here he is riding on this horse and and
[1:05:33] and he comes with the faithful saints.
[1:05:35] And the Bible says in Revelations 19
[1:05:37] 11-2, "And I saw heaven opened,
[1:05:40] and behold, a white horse,
[1:05:43] and he that sat upon him was called
[1:05:45] faithful and true,
[1:05:49] and in righteousness he doth judge and
[1:05:51] make war."
[1:05:53] His eyes were as flames of fire. And I
[1:05:56] just want you to focus on this phrase.
[1:05:58] And on his head
[1:06:00] were many crowns.
[1:06:03] This is after the after that time when
[1:06:06] brother said crowns are given out.
[1:06:09] Says Christ is wearing many crowns on
[1:06:11] his head. I like to refer to that as
[1:06:13] proof that there can be more than one
[1:06:15] crown.
[1:06:17] It's a proof of the multiplicity of
[1:06:19] crowns because he had on his head
[1:06:21] crowns.
[1:06:23] But where did he get those crowns?
[1:06:26] What were these crowns that he was
[1:06:28] wearing?
[1:06:30] Could it be said that these are the
[1:06:32] crowns that he earned and these are the
[1:06:33] crowns that he deserved and these are
[1:06:34] the crowns that he have given his own
[1:06:36] life. He merited them in his service and
[1:06:38] during his time on earth these are the
[1:06:40] crowns that his fathers had given him.
[1:06:41] Where did he get these many crowns?
[1:06:43] Brother Brandham says he's done been
[1:06:45] crowned by his saints.
[1:06:49] He's been crowned by his saints.
[1:06:54] How is it that he is king of kings
[1:06:57] because we've been crowned kings, but
[1:06:59] now he's the king of kings. How is it
[1:07:02] that he is made lord of lords when we've
[1:07:04] been placed as authorities over and and
[1:07:07] and miniature messiahs as it were?
[1:07:10] How is it he is the king of kings and
[1:07:13] the lord of lords? How is it that he
[1:07:15] rides with many crowns on his head?
[1:07:18] Where did he get those crowns? It's the
[1:07:20] crowns that you earned by his grace. And
[1:07:24] in that moment, in that time, the
[1:07:25] redeemed, having received the crowns,
[1:07:28] will then say, "All these crowns that I
[1:07:30] earned, they were by your grace." And
[1:07:32] the redeemed will then take their
[1:07:34] crowns, and they will crown him. You're
[1:07:37] not just the king. You're the king of
[1:07:39] kings. You are not just the Lord. You're
[1:07:42] the Lord of Lords. And we bow ourselves
[1:07:44] before him. And we acknowledge my
[1:07:47] rewards are by your grace.
[1:07:51] These are your crowns.
[1:07:54] And we will do just as the elders did in
[1:07:57] Revelations 4. Kind of a preamble, this
[1:08:01] a precursor where they stood there and
[1:08:03] the scene's described, but then all of a
[1:08:05] sudden these golden crowns are being
[1:08:07] cast to the throne and they're saying,
[1:08:09] "Worthy is he to receive glory and honor
[1:08:12] and power. Worthy is he cuz he created
[1:08:14] all things." and for thy pleasure they
[1:08:16] were they and were created and there was
[1:08:19] this expression of worship. And is it
[1:08:21] even any wonder when the worthy one is
[1:08:23] being pronounced and it says fear not
[1:08:26] for the lion of the tribe of Judah hath
[1:08:28] prevailed and John turns in Revelations
[1:08:30] 5 and he says there's the lamb and they
[1:08:33] begin to cry out and they begin to say
[1:08:35] he's worthy. And then John says, "Then I
[1:08:38] cried out. Then I begin to say, blessing
[1:08:40] and honor, glory and power, crown after
[1:08:45] crowd after crowd be unto his name to
[1:08:48] the lamb forever and ever."
[1:08:51] Oh, if I could just think, and this is
[1:08:53] the part that just so overwhelmed me as
[1:08:55] I've been studying this, could it be,
[1:08:57] saints, could it be that we're crowning
[1:09:01] him now?
[1:09:02] Amen.
[1:09:04] that even now as we labor and as we
[1:09:06] serve, we're crowning him now with our
[1:09:08] faithful service. That just as the
[1:09:10] elders cast their crowns, just as John
[1:09:13] pour out that praise, that I in this
[1:09:15] life as I serve him and I do what the
[1:09:18] scripture said today, I'm crowning him.
[1:09:20] And I say to you believers, crown him.
[1:09:24] Crown him. Do not deny him the crown
[1:09:27] that he is due. Do not deny him the
[1:09:30] glory that he is due. Give him honor.
[1:09:32] Give him praise.
[1:09:35] Crown him.
[1:09:37] Crown him
[1:09:39] for he's worthy.
