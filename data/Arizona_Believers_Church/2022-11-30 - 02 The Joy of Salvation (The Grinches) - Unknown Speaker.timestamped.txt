[0:00] but our our title tonight uh our subject
[0:03] tonight still the joy of Salvation And
[0:06] this is maybe going to be a little
[0:08] thought-provoking right off the start
[0:09] but my my uh title is the grinches
[0:13] and so I've got everyone's attention
[0:15] maybe this is another edition of kids
[0:16] eat free I don't know I didn't think of
[0:17] it that way but this is a series about
[0:19] salvation uh the joy that it produces
[0:22] and even touching on some of its
[0:23] connections to some Christmas themes of
[0:26] the Christmas time we do not believe
[0:27] that Jesus was born in the month of
[0:29] December uh you might just admire the
[0:31] fact that I'm using Christmas is still
[0:33] in November uh maybe that's just the at
[0:36] least it wasn't after July 4th like most
[0:38] people do these days but the uh we know
[0:42] Christ wasn't born in December but yet
[0:44] the the uh Christmas signifies and
[0:47] stands for Christ's coming to the Earth
[0:49] God's sending forth his son so a lot of
[0:51] themes connected to this that I want to
[0:53] tie back to Joy and the subject of the
[0:55] Grinch is we'll make abundantly clear to
[0:57] you tonight as we go forward so if the
[1:00] the use of the word Grinch stumbles you
[1:01] at all stick with me hopefully we'll
[1:03] give it some context to help you out so
[1:05] the joy of Salvation is the subject and
[1:07] we're just giving a title tonight called
[1:08] the grinches John chapter 16 verse 20.
[1:11] this is a great place to start to begin
[1:12] to to kind of launch into this thought
[1:14] more could be said on this scripture but
[1:17] I just want to kind of right over the
[1:18] top of it just to kind of introduce
[1:21] reintroduce some principles and touch on
[1:23] some things Jesus says very very I send
[1:25] you that ye shall weep and lament but
[1:28] the world shall rejoice that's a really
[1:30] odd statement he's describing the
[1:32] disciples as weeping but yet the world
[1:34] rejoicing and he then he comes right
[1:37] back to but your sorrow shall be turned
[1:39] into Joy so we may have moments of
[1:41] weeping moments of sorrow but sorrow
[1:43] shall be turned into joy and then he
[1:45] alludes to the pain of childbirth as
[1:48] being kind of like and unto what they're
[1:50] experiencing weeping and lamenting while
[1:52] the world is rejoicing but sorrow turned
[1:54] into Joy he says a woman when she is in
[1:55] travail hath sorrow because their hours
[1:58] come but as soon as she is delivered of
[2:00] the child she remembers no more the
[2:02] anguish for the joy that a man is Born
[2:04] Into the world let me just keep reading
[2:06] and ye now therefore have sorrow but I
[2:09] will see you again and your heart shall
[2:11] rejoice and your joy no man and taketh
[2:13] from you and in that day you shall ask
[2:15] me nothing verily verily I say unto you
[2:17] whatsoever ye shall ask the father in my
[2:19] name he will give it you hitherto have
[2:21] you asked me nothing in my name and ye
[2:24] shall ask and you shall receive that
[2:26] your joy may be full so again just
[2:29] looking at it as an overview he says
[2:31] you're weeping now you're Sorrowing the
[2:33] world is rejoicing but your sorrow will
[2:35] be turned into joy and he's going to use
[2:37] this example of a woman who is in her
[2:39] hour of travail knowing that that child
[2:41] is coming forth the pain that
[2:43] accompanies it and that terrible
[2:45] tremendous anguish that may be and even
[2:47] the trepidation the fear of how terrible
[2:49] it might be I'm not speaking from
[2:51] experience I can't but there's a pain
[2:53] that comes with childbirth there's a
[2:55] fear of the pain that comes and he
[2:57] alludes to that pain of childbirth
[2:59] quickly being forgotten as soon as the
[3:02] baby is born I'm sure that maybe mothers
[3:04] could testify to that and witness that
[3:06] there's this pain and even in the moment
[3:08] of that physical pain there's something
[3:09] about the child being born that causes
[3:12] the pain pain to dissipate and to
[3:14] disappear and you're not cognizant of it
[3:16] you're not thinking about it says oh for
[3:17] the joy that a man is Born Into the
[3:19] world and he eludes and even in saying
[3:23] this for the joy that a man is born in
[3:24] the world he's he's hearkening even to
[3:26] his own birth at the time that this
[3:28] child was born into the world because
[3:29] his birth is associated with joy and
[3:32] Luke Chapter 2 verses 10 and 11 it says
[3:35] and the angel said unto them speaking to
[3:36] the Shepherds fear not for behold I
[3:38] bring you good tidings of great joy and
[3:41] think of all the themes connected with
[3:42] the birth of Christ Joy is the
[3:44] consistent one which shall be to all
[3:47] people for unto you is Born This Day in
[3:49] the city of David a savior which is
[3:52] Christ the lord so he says that even as
[3:56] he speaks about even the scripture talk
[3:57] about the world being in travail and the
[3:59] world sorry in the world being in
[4:01] darkness and at the coming of the
[4:02] Messiah great light has sprung up and
[4:04] there's now this great joy that has come
[4:06] I bring you great Good Tidings of great
[4:08] joy Jesus is even alluding to his very
[4:10] coming using that language and then then
[4:13] he says that we should ask in his name
[4:16] and the point and the and the reference
[4:18] of that as he closes that as that your
[4:20] joy may be full he's pointing to a
[4:22] complete Joy the fullness of joy that he
[4:25] brings that only he can be or in total
[4:27] Joy so these are that just kind of shows
[4:30] that Joy is this main subject in this
[4:32] particular passage here as Christ speaks
[4:35] to him but my focus is on this he says
[4:37] your heart shall rejoice and that
[4:40] rejoice it means to be glad to Rejoice
[4:42] exceedingly the word is translated to
[4:44] Joy joyfully joyous joyful and
[4:47] joyfulness these are the words that's
[4:48] used it speaks of Joy ye shall rejoice
[4:50] you shall be joyful you shall cry out
[4:53] joyfully and he says and your joy no man
[4:56] taketh from you
[4:58] now when he says your joy no man take it
[5:01] from you he's clearly alluding to a
[5:03] stolen Joy he says you're Sorrowing now
[5:05] but joy will come your sorrow will be
[5:07] turned into joy and he says that this
[5:09] Joy you're going to have no man will be
[5:12] able to take away from you and I think
[5:13] we can gather from then by our own
[5:15] experience recognize that there's times
[5:17] of sorrow and stress wherein Joy has
[5:20] been lost there's times when oh I'm
[5:22] happy everything's great but something
[5:24] comes along and steals your joy and you
[5:27] thought where did my joy go where did my
[5:28] happiness go it's been stolen from you
[5:31] and Jesus is saying that there's going
[5:33] to be a time when your hearts will
[5:35] rejoice and the joy that you have no man
[5:38] will be able to steal from you no man
[5:41] will be able to take that Joy away from
[5:43] you so he's he is speaking of a joy that
[5:45] is permanent a joy that is inaccessible
[5:47] to a thief and so when we look at the
[5:50] idea of stolen Joy have you already made
[5:52] it there that's where that brings me to
[5:55] the grinches
[5:58] because the Grinch's steal things
[6:01] and Jesus says that the let no man he
[6:03] says your heart shall rejoice in your
[6:05] joy no man taketh from you Joy is
[6:08] something that can be stolen from you
[6:10] but we do not want our joy to be taken
[6:13] from us
[6:14] now the Grinch we've all heard of the
[6:17] Grinch before and you can think you can
[6:18] go to the next slide brother John if
[6:19] perhaps that'll work there the Grinch I
[6:22] think immediately all of us in our minds
[6:23] when even I use the phrase the grinches
[6:25] we associate it with Ted gazel's uh 1957
[6:28] character from the the short story the
[6:31] book How The Grinch Stole Christmas and
[6:34] this is how we envision it this is even
[6:35] from the book itself and that's where
[6:38] our minds first go when we think of the
[6:40] Grinch I think that's appropriate
[6:41] because that's really how it entered
[6:42] into our language and even how the word
[6:44] is used today would be based upon this
[6:46] character Roderick Kipling however used
[6:48] the phrase grinching in the 1890s I
[6:51] believe it was it's in the lament of the
[6:53] the Border cattle thief and he speaks of
[6:56] a grinching a grind and a very grating
[6:58] noise something that would be bothersome
[7:00] something very harsh there's even
[7:03] references to the surname Grinch and
[7:05] fiction to describe characters who are
[7:06] harsh or severe going back as far as
[7:08] 1903 and you didn't know you were here
[7:11] for a literature lesson but you're
[7:12] getting one but this is this is a phrase
[7:15] though that we most often identify with
[7:17] Dr Seuss's character the Grinch even the
[7:20] Grinch may be remind us of Charles
[7:23] Dickens character Ebenezer Scrooge that
[7:26] Miser and the Christmas Carol from 1843
[7:29] and so there's this there's this
[7:31] caricature of these personalities where
[7:33] they're they're mean they're all they're
[7:34] they're severe they're very very harsh
[7:37] and let me just give you a synopsis of
[7:39] the Grinch of Dr Seuss's Grinch and just
[7:43] generally he was hateful and
[7:44] ill-tempered but he especially hated
[7:46] Christmas and kind of the how many here
[7:50] have actually read the Grinch raise your
[7:51] hands are familiar with the Grinch all
[7:52] right so you'll you'll be able to catch
[7:54] the plot here very quickly
[7:56] but in the synopsis he hates Christmas
[7:58] so much that he tries to ruin Christmas
[8:00] for all of Whoville by stealing all
[8:03] their Christmas gifts and all the things
[8:04] related to it and he concocts this plan
[8:07] and by by Magic he's able to get all the
[8:09] all the gifts and all the trees and all
[8:11] the bells and whistles and everything
[8:12] that the who's used to celebrate
[8:14] Christmas and puts it back on top of
[8:17] that mountain I guess and he has stolen
[8:19] in his mind he has stolen Christmas from
[8:21] all the Whos and this is to his uh he is
[8:25] this makes him happy to make other
[8:27] people miserable and that's a
[8:29] characteristic of a Grinch and so he has
[8:32] now uh seemingly accomplished his great
[8:35] plan only to wake up on Christmas
[8:36] morning and hear the who's rejoicing and
[8:40] singing and happily celebrating
[8:42] Christmas and and he's like he's
[8:45] thinking wait how could they be
[8:47] celebrating Christmas when I've taken
[8:49] the gifts from him I took the tinsel I
[8:51] took the trees I took the turkeys I took
[8:53] all everything that they gather around
[8:54] for this tremendous day and he wakes up
[8:56] and he hears them still celebrating and
[8:58] they're happy to have hands to clasp and
[9:01] they're rejoicing that they have each
[9:02] other and Christmas means more to them
[9:04] than the gifts and he realizes Christmas
[9:06] means more than he thought and the The
[9:09] Story begins with him having a heart two
[9:11] sizes too small
[9:13] and then when he hears this rejoicing on
[9:15] Christmas Day by all the who's his heart
[9:17] grows three sizes he returns back down
[9:20] the mountain to give all the gifts back
[9:22] to the who's and they celebrate his
[9:23] feast and that's the story of the Grinch
[9:25] so in the story The Grinch is redeemed
[9:29] and and it's a it's a story of
[9:30] redemption and one whose character is
[9:32] changed but the way that we use the
[9:34] phrase today a Grinch and the next slide
[9:37] with John a Grinch is a grumpy person
[9:39] who spoils The Joy or the happiness or
[9:42] the pleasure of others that is the idea
[9:44] behind a grinch anybody use the word
[9:46] Grinch lately you will before the month
[9:49] of December is over I'm sure
[9:51] but it's somebody it's a grumpy person a
[9:53] grudging person a Stern a harsh person a
[9:56] unfund person just as the Grinch was uh
[9:59] just generally mean and ill-tempered a
[10:02] Grinch is one who spoils the joy of
[10:04] others
[10:06] a person who does not does not like
[10:08] other people celebrating or enjoying
[10:11] themselves a grinch does not rejoice
[10:13] when somebody else rejoices a Grinch is
[10:15] not happy when somebody else is happy a
[10:17] grinch as a matter of fact does not like
[10:19] it when other people are celebrating it
[10:20] does not like it when other people are
[10:21] having fun a grinch even by definition
[10:24] and I believe it maybe Cambridge or
[10:26] oxfords is a person whose mean-spirited
[10:29] and unfriendly that's what a Grinch is
[10:31] ever heard of a killjoy
[10:34] right it literally means a murder of Joy
[10:37] but a killjoy that's a grinch a killjoy
[10:39] is one who spoils the pleasures of
[10:41] others one who will Who is grudgingly
[10:43] about something and just out of their
[10:47] ill-temperedness refuses to participate
[10:49] in an activity and we're like oh don't
[10:51] be a kill Joy surely you could play
[10:53] exploding kittens or surely you can play
[10:55] Taco whatever it is it is you you know
[10:58] what huh
[11:00] yeah sure Taco goat cat cheese pizza
[11:02] whatever surely and someone who doesn't
[11:05] like I don't like doing puzzles I don't
[11:06] like doing board games I don't like
[11:07] doing this I don't like it we said
[11:09] they're a grits they're Killjoy
[11:11] and so this one who doesn't participate
[11:13] in an activity and it kind of brings
[11:15] everything down and sours everything and
[11:17] so this is what a Grinch is in our minds
[11:20] and this is what a Grinch is this is
[11:21] what I'm alluding to a grumpy person who
[11:24] tries to steal somebody else's Joy
[11:27] unhappy person who doesn't like it when
[11:29] people are celebrating and and is it
[11:31] bothers them when people are rejoicing
[11:33] and and I think the phrase is right I
[11:36] think I don't know if it's from the
[11:37] cartoon or something but the people are
[11:39] rejoicing and singing songs and the
[11:41] Grinch laments I think it's in one of
[11:42] the movies where he says oh it's joyful
[11:44] and triumphant right he hates that
[11:48] and when we talk about the grinches
[11:51] going a little bit too fast there
[11:52] brother John but it's all right the
[11:54] Grinch's
[11:55] we want to identify the grinches
[11:58] so we're doing is we're going to
[11:59] identify the grinches and I'm also going
[12:00] to say don't be a Grinch
[12:02] in other words don't let anybody steal
[12:04] your joy
[12:06] that's when we identify grinches we're
[12:08] identifying these things that try to
[12:09] steal your joy grinches still our joy
[12:11] and then you don't want to steal other
[12:13] people's Joy
[12:16] and so the Grinch is that still Joy
[12:18] we're going to look at a few grinches
[12:19] that still Joy but let's and we're
[12:21] thinking about this the Grinch is that
[12:22] still Joy David already alluded to one
[12:24] when we read Psalms 51 12 on Sunday he
[12:26] says restore unto me the joy of my
[12:28] salvation it was on his own sin his own
[12:30] Disobedience that stole his joy and he
[12:33] asked for it to be stored back to him
[12:34] why because it had been taken away from
[12:36] him and so when we say the grinches it's
[12:38] the grinches that steal your joy
[12:41] in John chapter 16 verses 23 and 24 he
[12:45] said in that day you shall ask me
[12:46] nothing verily verily I say unto you
[12:48] whatsoever shall ask the name ask the
[12:51] father in my name he will give it to you
[12:53] hitherto have you asked nothing in my
[12:55] name ask and you shall receive that your
[12:57] joy may be full I come back to this
[13:01] because Jesus is saying that if you ask
[13:04] I'll give it to you ask you shall
[13:06] receive and it's an asking of him and
[13:09] receiving of him he says that brings us
[13:11] the fullness of joy and so I start here
[13:14] because we need to know where our joy
[13:16] comes from we need to be sent or to
[13:18] recognize where do I find my true peace
[13:20] where do I find my Tranquility where is
[13:23] it I'm going to find my satisfaction and
[13:25] there's ways that we can testify that
[13:27] when we were in the world we try to find
[13:29] our satisfaction a lot of things whether
[13:31] it be Athletics whether it be in a hobby
[13:33] whether it be in the bottle whether it
[13:35] be in in women whether it be in this we
[13:37] tried to find our where we fit in we
[13:39] tried to find something that brings us
[13:40] this enduring peace and satisfaction and
[13:43] there's only one place we find it you're
[13:44] going to find it in God he said well
[13:46] that's not true of this person it's not
[13:48] true of that person well I can't speak
[13:49] for everyone else but for the elect they
[13:51] need to know that their true joy and
[13:53] their true happiness comes from God
[13:56] so we read on Sunday in the message the
[13:58] token brother Brown says God is your joy
[14:00] God is your strength I love this knowing
[14:02] the message knowing the truth that's our
[14:05] sufficiency think of that then
[14:07] everything is satisfied in knowing truth
[14:09] you shall know the truth and the truth
[14:11] shall make you free it's kind of this
[14:13] liberating precept that that liberates
[14:15] me from sadness and despondency and
[14:18] Melancholy he's my all sufficiency
[14:20] everything I find is in him and in this
[14:23] truth in him all things I have need of
[14:25] is in him that's our strength My Help
[14:27] Cometh From The Lord my hope is in the
[14:30] Lord my expectation is in the Lord these
[14:32] are the things we want to emphasize you
[14:34] Christians Look to Him for your joy Look
[14:36] to Him for your strength look for him
[14:39] for your happiness he is my peace he is
[14:41] my joy he is my love he is my life
[14:45] there's one thing about Christmas and
[14:47] maybe I'm not necessarily riffing right
[14:49] now but it's one some of the things that
[14:50] have informed my heart as I've
[14:51] considered these things as is the
[14:54] promise of Christmas is so Grand and has
[14:57] gotten even more and more sparkly as we
[15:00] advance in technology and there's this
[15:02] huge promise for it and you could just
[15:04] simply relate it to the fact that I'm 47
[15:06] years old and not seven but there's
[15:08] there's this emptiness that comes
[15:10] sometime around on the 25th in the
[15:13] afternoon right after everything's
[15:14] already been opening look this is it
[15:16] right I'm just looking forward to this
[15:18] for for a whole year and this is it it's
[15:20] over and there just seems to be
[15:22] something always lacking where no matter
[15:24] how great it is there's always this was
[15:27] there more is there another something
[15:28] hidden do you remember as a kid maybe
[15:30] going through all the paper and looking
[15:31] under the couch and shuffling under the
[15:33] nativity scene and hoping that maybe
[15:34] there's one last gift because even
[15:37] though you've got a lot of great things
[15:39] there always seems to be something it
[15:41] just that doesn't quite put you over the
[15:42] edge why because our there's the promise
[15:46] and the Allure of all the tinsel and all
[15:48] the lights and all the singing and all
[15:50] the gifts can never satisfy you like
[15:53] Christ can satisfy you
[15:55] our happiness comes from him he is our
[15:57] peace he is our Joys our love he's our
[15:59] life
[16:00] and in Psalm 62 5 it says my soul wait
[16:02] thou only upon God for my expectation is
[16:06] from him
[16:07] my hope is in him my expectation is from
[16:10] him in other words those things that I
[16:12] desire those things that I believe will
[16:13] bring me joy those things that I believe
[16:15] will satisfy those things that I believe
[16:17] will suffice come from him for he is my
[16:20] joy he is my strength he is my peace
[16:24] so there's a few Grinch I didn't number
[16:27] them I guess maybe I could have done it
[16:28] and we could do it maybe as we go along
[16:30] but of the grinches that still Joy hope
[16:33] is a Grinch
[16:35] when I say hope I'm talking about the
[16:37] the the wrong kind of expectation
[16:40] hope is a grinch it's one of the
[16:42] grinches that steals our Joy James
[16:45] chapter 1 verses 16 to 17 he says do not
[16:47] air my beloved Brethren every good gift
[16:50] and every perfect gift is from above and
[16:52] cometh down from the Father of Lights I
[16:54] don't know that James knew that gifts
[16:56] and lights would come together in the
[16:58] season of Christmas and would be so
[17:00] pronounced in such a festive time as
[17:02] this but it reminds us that every good
[17:04] gift and every perfect gift is from
[17:06] above and cometh down from the Father of
[17:07] Lights with whom is no variableness
[17:09] neither shadow of turning God is The
[17:12] Giver of good gifts we can give gifts to
[17:15] one another we can give what we would
[17:16] call good gifts we could even find that
[17:18] gifts are practical very useful and
[17:20] bring us joy there's joy and giving
[17:21] there's certainly joy in receiving but
[17:23] God is The Giver of the good gifts God
[17:26] is the source of our joy that even in
[17:29] our giving we should be we should
[17:31] recognize that I'm giving of what God
[17:33] has given to me I'm able to give because
[17:35] God has blessed me when we receive from
[17:37] others we should receive it as from the
[17:39] Lord and as a the goodness of God and
[17:41] something he's blessing us with so that
[17:43] at the end of the day all praise and
[17:45] glory goes to God from whom all good
[17:47] things come from every good gift and
[17:49] every perfect gift comes from the Father
[17:52] of Lights in whom there is no Darkness
[17:54] there is no ulterior motive there is no
[17:56] jealousy a dark jealousy
[17:59] or something hidden
[18:01] to our demise every good gift every
[18:03] perfect gift comes from above
[18:05] and so even if we revisit John chapter
[18:07] 16 verse 33 Jesus has given them of
[18:10] words of warning he's telling the word
[18:12] you're going to be sorry in the world is
[18:13] going to be rejoicing and he says a lot
[18:15] of difficult things in this passage but
[18:17] he says these things have I spoken unto
[18:19] you that in me you might have peace our
[18:22] peace ought not come from anything else
[18:24] but him even in light of the difficult
[18:26] things that he says he says I'm telling
[18:28] you things with the promise so that me
[18:30] alone you'll have peace not just merely
[18:32] hay in the future this is going to
[18:34] happen in the future that's going to
[18:35] happen he wants our peace to solely come
[18:37] from him these things have I spoken unto
[18:39] you that in me you might have peace he
[18:41] says in the world he shall have
[18:43] tribulation but be of good cheer I have
[18:46] overcome the world what's the source of
[18:49] our joy what's the source of our cheer
[18:51] it is from the Lord
[18:54] our expectation is from him be of good
[18:57] cheer my joy comes from the fact that he
[18:59] has overcome the world so my my thought
[19:02] was this is I looked at these scriptures
[19:04] it's when we're looking to the wrong
[19:06] things to give a satisfaction that we
[19:08] find ourselves disappointed we get our
[19:10] hopes up we get all excited we're
[19:12] anticipating something we all know this
[19:14] is going to satisfy I think we even
[19:15] mentioned it here recently now if I
[19:16] could just do this if I could just do
[19:18] that that's going to satisfy that's
[19:19] going to suffice that's going to the
[19:21] momentum is going to shift everything's
[19:23] gonna go in my favor and we kind of we
[19:25] go all in on these things and we kind of
[19:27] stake our happiness on it and we're
[19:29] expecting something from the world to
[19:32] tip the scales to bring us joy that's
[19:35] always going to let you down
[19:37] even if you get what you're wanting it's
[19:39] never going to bring you the happiness
[19:40] that you would want it to bring you ah
[19:42] well I was really hoping this would
[19:43] happen and sure enough it happens and
[19:45] guess what it's going to be empty to you
[19:48] I remember I had a friend in law school
[19:50] who was uh going through a very very
[19:53] difficult time with the grades and
[19:54] everything and I guess one of the
[19:55] statements they made to me is they said
[19:57] how come you don't sweat your grades and
[19:58] how come you're not worried about what
[20:00] the outcome is going to be and I I was
[20:02] just testifying of the goodness of God
[20:03] and I told him if I God wants me to have
[20:06] um the best job with six figure salary
[20:09] and at one of the best law firms when I
[20:11] graduate then I can have the worst
[20:12] grades in the class and I'm still going
[20:14] to get the job
[20:15] I said but if God doesn't want me to
[20:17] have that job I can have the best grade
[20:19] in the class and I'm not going to get
[20:20] that job I said so I've sold out and
[20:22] I've staked everything on him and I told
[20:24] this person I said this is just my just
[20:26] a testimony to give to support this what
[20:28] your expectation is from I said what you
[20:31] should I said what I've done is I've
[20:32] tied myself to an absolute and I chose
[20:35] the word of God and so my joy my
[20:38] happiness and my expectations connected
[20:40] with the word whatever the word stock
[20:42] price is at that's where my happiness is
[20:45] whether or not it's ever gonna is it
[20:47] ever gonna demise is it ever going to
[20:48] fail is it ever going to let me down no
[20:50] the Heaven and Earth shall pass away but
[20:52] the word will never pass away so I'm all
[20:54] in I'm invested in the word of God that
[20:56] determines my happiness so that's why I
[20:58] stake everything and I said that's what
[21:00] I've done I've sold out to the word of
[21:02] God I said I just recommend that you
[21:03] find yourself an absolute I said if it's
[21:06] your mom's cooking sell out to it and as
[21:09] long as that's good and as long as
[21:10] you're getting it be happy I said if
[21:11] it's the Dallas Mavericks sell out to it
[21:13] as long as they're winning as long as
[21:15] they're doing good you can be happy
[21:16] whatever it is find an absolute sell out
[21:19] to it and let that be your measure of
[21:21] joy
[21:22] that's when we begin to look to those
[21:24] other things as our source of
[21:25] contentment our source of satisfaction
[21:27] and we're hoping that's why I use this
[21:29] term hope we our hope hope is a grinch
[21:32] it's the greatest enemy that faith has
[21:34] in that sense hope is a Grinch why
[21:37] because it builds us up to expect these
[21:39] great things and I want this to happen I
[21:41] want this to happen and what happens
[21:42] even when it gives it to you
[21:44] you get it but it stole your joy
[21:47] because hope is a Grinch
[21:49] our expectations should be on the Lord
[21:51] and the Lord alone
[21:53] the next Grinch is we're identifying the
[21:55] Grinch's jealousy is a Grinch
[21:57] touching on these very briefly didn't
[21:59] want to be lengthy tonight because each
[22:00] one of these is worthy of a lot more
[22:02] attention in themselves but in Hebrews
[22:04] chapter 13 verse 5 remember jealousy is
[22:06] a Grinch if you didn't get that down
[22:07] that's number two Hebrews 13 Verse 5 let
[22:10] your conversation be without
[22:11] covetousness let it be without Envy in
[22:14] this deep-seated jealousy that connives
[22:16] and conspires and wants to have let your
[22:19] conversation let your life be without
[22:21] jealousy let it be without This Bitter
[22:24] Envy let it be without covetousness and
[22:26] we know what he's talking about because
[22:28] he says and be content with such things
[22:29] as you have for he hath said I will
[22:32] never leave thee nor forsake thee to me
[22:35] I believe this connects right back to
[22:36] Hope as a grinch we're putting our
[22:38] expectation in the right things he says
[22:40] don't live with jealousy be happy with
[22:43] you what you have because he said I will
[22:45] never leave thee no forsake thee
[22:47] because he has said I will never leave
[22:49] thee nor forsake Thee I can be content
[22:51] in whatever state I'm in because he said
[22:53] the never failing presence of Jesus
[22:55] Christ will be with you whether wherever
[22:56] you go therefore I can be content
[22:58] because I'm confident in his presence
[23:00] I'm confident in his provision I find my
[23:02] pleasure in the things of God and
[23:04] because he has said I'll never leave
[23:05] thee nor forsake Thee I can be content
[23:08] with whatever it is I have
[23:10] let your conversation be without
[23:13] jealousy or covetousness I think it's in
[23:15] times like this that we could find
[23:16] ourselves comparing whether it be how we
[23:19] celebrate Christmas or what we're going
[23:21] to get for Christmas or what we're going
[23:22] to do for Christmas or what is being
[23:24] presented as available for Christmas
[23:26] it's amazing how just saying one left
[23:29] one available or get it now sell ends
[23:32] after the repeated emails when they're
[23:34] they're just emailing you saying hey we
[23:36] only got three in stock you really
[23:37] should buy and I'm thinking why are they
[23:39] emailing me telling me they only got
[23:40] three in stock I mean if they only got
[23:42] three in stock they're going to sell
[23:43] right you really you know me huh you
[23:46] know I want that this is very personal
[23:47] all of a sudden you get this I just
[23:49] think it's great that J crew thought of
[23:51] me before everybody else when they were
[23:52] down to three you know three sweaters
[23:55] and and so there's just something where
[23:57] the world is trying to kind of get us
[23:58] into this mode of I I need this and I
[24:00] need that I got to have this and I got
[24:02] to have that and again if I could borrow
[24:04] from what we wanted to say on Sunday in
[24:07] no way would I want you to twist what
[24:09] I'm trying to say as me preaching
[24:11] against anything we're standing together
[24:13] looking at something and we're and we're
[24:15] observing it and we're wanting to
[24:16] encourage one and be sure our Spirits
[24:18] are right
[24:19] something about the Christmas season
[24:21] despite all the the the the the
[24:22] lightness of the bells that are ringing
[24:25] that come carries with it an edge in
[24:27] this maybe this unperceptible uh uh
[24:31] tension that begins to build
[24:34] it that the very tension of Carol of the
[24:37] Bells is building and building behind
[24:40] the scenes and we're no longer joyful
[24:43] and triumphant we're anxious and angry
[24:46] all because of the things are being
[24:48] presented to us and there is a sense of
[24:50] jealousy and there is this sense of I
[24:52] need to have that I need to have this
[24:53] and there could be a lot of tension
[24:54] that's related to it and I'm not shy at
[24:57] all just to go ahead and talk about it
[24:58] and share it with you because I believe
[25:00] it'll be a strength to us to just be
[25:01] sure we're properly centered during
[25:03] times like this so that we don't have
[25:05] the disappointments that come with the
[25:06] wrong attitude
[25:08] be without covetousness brother Brown
[25:10] said in the sermon door inside the door
[25:12] he says it's in a number of places he
[25:13] always tell my young couples like this
[25:15] that happiness does not consist of how
[25:18] much of the world's Goods you own
[25:20] our happiness is not tied to how much we
[25:22] get for Christmas can you say Amen all
[25:25] right there you go getting the kids say
[25:26] Amen happiness is not tied to the goods
[25:28] that we own the goods that we get the
[25:30] gifts that we receive he says but it's
[25:32] how contented how happy you are how
[25:34] contented you make yourself with the
[25:37] portion that's allotted to you what a
[25:39] remarkable image that's expressed in
[25:41] that where there was a happiness that
[25:43] was found in the simple things brother
[25:44] Branham found happiness and his young
[25:46] marriage with things that were just
[25:48] cobbled together and scraped by and
[25:50] there's a way that you can find
[25:52] happiness in being satisfied with what
[25:54] you have and what will steal your joy
[25:56] quicker than anything is looking at what
[25:58] other people have and coveting after it
[26:01] Envy will rob you of your joy and thus
[26:04] your contentment
[26:05] so we want to be satisfied with the
[26:07] portion that's lauded to us he said
[26:09] brother Aaron this is really really a
[26:11] smooth way of telling your children not
[26:13] to get their hopes up and to be happy
[26:14] with whatever they get for Christmas
[26:16] but that's not what I was thinking of
[26:18] but I may be quick to draw back to this
[26:20] if necessary
[26:22] the Bible says in first Timothy chapter
[26:23] 6 verses 6 7 and 8 but godliness with
[26:26] contentment is great gain we want to
[26:29] gain things we want to have things we
[26:30] ought to accumulate we want to have the
[26:31] 2.0 but godliness with contentment is
[26:34] what is the greatest gain it is great
[26:36] gain to have godliness it is a great
[26:38] gain not only to have goddess but to be
[26:40] content there with for we brought
[26:42] nothing into this world it is certain we
[26:44] can carry nothing out of it and having
[26:47] food and arraignment let us therewith be
[26:49] there with content wow I mean that's a
[26:52] heavy statement as long as you have
[26:53] clothes on and food to eat we should be
[26:56] happy
[26:57] does it matter if I don't have if I'm
[27:00] not wearing the Jordans if I don't have
[27:01] the Yeezys it doesn't matter if I what
[27:03] if I don't have this and what if I don't
[27:05] have that do you have food yes do you
[27:07] have clothes yes well there should be a
[27:09] contentment that comes with that
[27:11] so when we begin to keep our eyes on the
[27:13] other things and we get caught up in the
[27:15] upgrade cycle we get caught up in the
[27:16] latest and the greatest in what other
[27:18] people have those are the things that
[27:19] begin to close in around us and begin to
[27:21] suffocate out our joy why because we
[27:23] begin to Envy after what other people
[27:25] have but godliness with contentment is
[27:27] great gain
[27:28] the Bible says in Psalms 37 16 a little
[27:31] that a righteous man hath is better than
[27:33] the riches of many Wicked
[27:36] if a righteous man has just yet a little
[27:39] it's better than the riches of many
[27:41] Wicked so take the riches of many Wicked
[27:43] and it pales in comparison to the little
[27:46] that a righteous man has
[27:48] because a righteous man with a little
[27:50] fares better is in a better position is
[27:52] better off than the many Wicked who fare
[27:54] sumptuously and who have riches
[27:57] these are things that are instructive to
[27:59] us how that to look upon others and to
[28:01] lust after the things that other people
[28:02] have steals us of our joy and our
[28:05] contentment why because jealousy is a
[28:07] Grinch
[28:09] hope is a Grinch jealousy is a Grinch
[28:11] that's number one and two number three
[28:12] comparison is a Grinch
[28:15] maybe a companion to jealousy a lot that
[28:17] could be said on this I found myself
[28:19] kind of getting lost in this study on
[28:21] comparison there's a lot of things that
[28:23] relate to this they've identified that
[28:25] as humans we are wired to compare that
[28:28] we just instinctively compare that when
[28:30] we think of ourselves and whether or not
[28:31] we're fit We compare ourselves to
[28:33] someone we know that is fit when we
[28:35] think of of our cooking and how good do
[28:37] you cook we immediately compare
[28:38] ourselves to someone that we think Cooks
[28:40] better than us and that we're just wired
[28:42] that way instead of even just kind of
[28:44] being objective about your own abilities
[28:46] and your own worth and your own looks
[28:48] that we always will compare ourselves to
[28:50] somebody that we think is better and
[28:52] just in doing that it brings us down
[28:55] it's something that we do instinctively
[28:57] it's something that we do as human
[28:58] beings and we have to avoid the urge to
[29:01] compare ourselves to be happy with the
[29:03] things that God blesses us with to be
[29:05] content with the things that are
[29:06] allotted to us and to not make the
[29:08] mistake of comparing ourselves to others
[29:11] I believe the statement is of course
[29:13] there's a real Rich history and trying
[29:15] to pin it down but there's a lot of
[29:16] statements to the centuries about the
[29:18] things that still joy and one of the
[29:20] things that's attributed to Roosevelt
[29:22] and Mark Twain and a lot of different
[29:23] people but I think it only came into
[29:25] writing in the 1980s its comparison is a
[29:28] thief of joy then when you compare
[29:31] yourself you can be very happy with
[29:32] something like oh my I mean listen this
[29:34] has probably happened with the last
[29:36] seven to 72 hours you give your kids a
[29:38] slice of pie and they're happy until
[29:40] they see how big their siblings I Supply
[29:43] is right in comparison is the thief of
[29:46] Joy because they're like this is wait a
[29:48] minute
[29:49] yours is bigger than mine and they were
[29:52] perfectly happy with what they had until
[29:54] they learned that somebody had something
[29:56] different or bigger or better
[29:58] why because it's something that just
[30:00] immediately in comparing we it robs us
[30:04] it steals us up it steals our joy from
[30:07] us
[30:07] Romans chapter 12 Verses 4 to 6 for as
[30:11] we have many members in one body this
[30:13] may be a unique scripture to use but it
[30:15] says and all members have not the same
[30:16] office so we being many are one body in
[30:19] Christ and everyone members of one
[30:21] another
[30:21] having them gifts different according to
[30:24] the grace that is given to us whether
[30:26] prophecy let us prophesy according to
[30:28] the proportion of Faith Paul is going to
[30:31] continue but what he says is whatever
[30:32] you have be happy with it be who you are
[30:35] use what you have
[30:37] we have gifts different according to the
[30:39] grace that is given to us during this
[30:41] time of gift giving some of us may be
[30:42] able to give greater gifts than we're
[30:45] able to receive to uh we receive greater
[30:47] gifts than we're able to give
[30:50] and one thing that gets us in that
[30:51] dangerous trap is trying to keep up
[30:53] right
[30:54] don't you hate having to buy gifts for
[30:56] people come on if we have to stop the
[30:58] stream and not and not archive this just
[31:00] so you can let loose some amens tonight
[31:03] it's not fun when somebody buys you a
[31:06] really really nice gift and you feel
[31:07] compelled to match the dollar price
[31:10] right they made sure they make sure the
[31:12] price is still on there and they say
[31:13] yeah I couldn't find anything under 800
[31:15] bucks but man that's the best one money
[31:17] can get and and they're sure that you
[31:19] get it early so that you can go out and
[31:20] try to figure out how you can match
[31:24] but having gifts different according to
[31:26] the grace that's given us we all have
[31:28] different measures there's going to be
[31:30] things that people can do that you will
[31:31] not be able to do there may be things
[31:33] that you can do that others can't do and
[31:34] in doing so we've got to recognize that
[31:36] God blesses us in different measures and
[31:38] having different gifts according to the
[31:40] grace that's given us let us just use
[31:42] our gifts and be ourselves
[31:45] and not compare ourselves if one is
[31:47] given a gift to do this not compare
[31:49] ourselves to another person who doesn't
[31:51] have that gift or someone who has this
[31:53] gift and I don't have the comparison is
[31:55] something that will tear us down and
[31:57] wound us severely Paul recognized this
[31:59] in the Corinthian Church in second
[32:00] Corinthians chapter 10 verse 12 it says
[32:03] for we dare not make ourselves of the
[32:05] number or compare ourselves with some
[32:07] that commend themselves he says but they
[32:09] measuring themselves by themselves and
[32:12] comparing themselves among themselves
[32:13] are not wise
[32:15] in other words it's unwise to compare
[32:18] it's unwise to find yourself receiving
[32:21] something and then saying well what did
[32:22] they get
[32:23] isn't this not the the weakness of Peter
[32:26] when he found himself wanting to know
[32:27] well what about this guy what about John
[32:30] what's going to happen with John what
[32:32] what does he get you've told me what my
[32:34] fortune is what is his fortune what does
[32:36] his future look like and Jesus said what
[32:38] is that to you
[32:40] if he tarries till I come what meaneth
[32:43] that to thee follow thou me in other
[32:46] words Peter don't worry about what
[32:47] everybody else is doing don't worry
[32:48] about what this church is doing don't
[32:50] worry about how many do this and how
[32:51] many do that as for you and your house
[32:53] serve the Lord as for what God has asked
[32:56] you to do do it Faithfully whatever your
[32:58] conviction is in light of God's word and
[33:01] whatever he's attached you and burdened
[33:03] you with by Revelation Faithfully
[33:05] servant and desire the same for
[33:07] everybody else that they would be
[33:09] faithful to their calling that they
[33:10] would stay in their place that they
[33:12] would do the things that God has asked
[33:14] them to do because if you do your job
[33:16] and I do my job and you do your job the
[33:18] job will get done but when we start
[33:20] comparing our workload to somebody
[33:22] else's workload somebody's calling to
[33:24] our own calling and we find ourselves
[33:25] comparing we're immediately carnal and
[33:28] the job's never going to get done let
[33:30] alone done right
[33:32] because comparison is a Grinch
[33:34] those are just
[33:37] a few
[33:38] but I wrestled with my title today
[33:40] whether it was going to be the grinches
[33:41] or don't be a Grinch
[33:46] and so there are a number of different
[33:47] grinches that steal our joy and so what
[33:49] we're doing is we're identifying those
[33:51] things that take our joy away you can
[33:53] say jealousy comparison
[33:55] the wrong kind of expectation
[33:58] but just taking a little bit of a turn
[33:59] here as we're going to be closing soon
[34:01] we might be trending towards Wednesday
[34:03] night sermons under an hour and the
[34:05] algorithm now
[34:08] I may be saying that a little bit
[34:09] premature so don't mean to let anybody
[34:11] down if you have the wrong expectation
[34:13] but I really I mean this and I'll just
[34:16] I'll just say it to myself Aaron don't
[34:18] be a Grinch
[34:21] and maybe we could just examine
[34:23] ourselves by it
[34:25] there are ways this is becoming more
[34:27] real to me and by my own failures there
[34:29] are ways that we can steal the joy out
[34:32] of our own home
[34:33] we don't need the Grits to come down
[34:35] from whatever Mountain it was above
[34:37] Whoville North Mountain or something
[34:40] is it Mount Crumpet I can't remember
[34:43] what it what armpit can't remember the
[34:44] name of the mountain but it comes down
[34:46] from the mountain he sneaks into
[34:48] everybody's homes and he steals
[34:49] Christmas tries to steal Christmas from
[34:51] him but you know what it's not the
[34:53] Grinch from without that we need to
[34:55] worry about sometimes it's the Grinch
[34:56] Within
[34:58] there are ways that we personally
[35:00] whether it be as fathers or just parents
[35:02] or even individuals within a home it is
[35:04] very easy for us to be the chief thieves
[35:07] of Joy within our homes
[35:09] as we could relate it even to this
[35:11] season I think that we are the primary
[35:13] caretakers over our joy and that even in
[35:16] identifying grinches if we could just
[35:17] not be a grinch ourselves we're well
[35:19] down the way of preserving our sanctity
[35:21] and pervert preserving our sanity during
[35:24] difficult times and these are just some
[35:27] general admonishments but we're using
[35:29] this theme of The Joy of Salvation
[35:31] tonight the grinches
[35:34] I was reminded earlier today in the the
[35:37] poem
[35:40] I don't know if it's called the visit
[35:41] from Santa Claus but we call it the
[35:43] twizz the Night Before Christmas
[35:45] and you remember how it begins
[35:47] Twas the Night Before Christmas
[35:52] a creature was stirring
[35:53] not even a mouse
[35:55] and then everyone's quiet everything's
[35:58] peaceful everybody is resting right it's
[36:01] just this this this calmness
[36:04] and then what was it out on the lawn
[36:06] arose such a clatter right there's these
[36:08] things that take place that disturb our
[36:11] Tranquility things ought to be calm and
[36:13] quiet and peaceful we should be living
[36:15] in times we can be contemplating the
[36:18] things of God and we want to steal away
[36:20] from all the static and all the noise
[36:22] and all the data and all the information
[36:24] it's the curse of the cell phone to
[36:26] where we're never separated from the
[36:28] noise of the world the world and so
[36:30] there's a I'm kind of identifying that
[36:32] moment that time when everything ought
[36:34] to be quiet there Rise is such a clatter
[36:36] this agitation is stirring
[36:40] and as we say to us you know maybe it's
[36:43] to the heads of the households and ones
[36:44] don't be a Grinch in Proverbs chapter 15
[36:46] verse 27 it says he that is greedy of
[36:49] gained trouble with his own house
[36:52] greed like I said greed is a Grinch
[36:56] but here we are in control of this this
[36:59] idea we have we can be be possessors of
[37:01] this idea that greed will trouble our
[37:05] house he that is greedy for gain he that
[37:07] finds himself pursuing the accumulation
[37:10] of riches pursuing the having of things
[37:12] the spirit of greed is one of the
[37:15] primary characteristics of laodicea the
[37:17] fear of missing out
[37:18] the lust for things it grips laodicea
[37:22] and we must not allow ourselves to
[37:24] succumb to its pressures
[37:26] his brother brother Branham identifies
[37:27] them the pressure the great pressure of
[37:29] this age
[37:31] and I you know you say greed is a Grinch
[37:34] noise noisy distractions are grinches
[37:37] what did they do it that robs us of our
[37:39] peace
[37:40] robs us of our tranquility
[37:43] and so when we when I when I admonish it
[37:45] this way don't be a grinch if greedy
[37:47] Being Greedy of gained troubles the
[37:48] house it tells us that the things that
[37:51] we pursue can be the very things that
[37:52] begin to deprive us of joy
[37:55] the very things we pursue the very
[37:56] things we try to grasp the very things
[37:58] we try to have the very things that we
[38:00] think and I think this is instructive to
[38:01] parents because I know for me I have a
[38:03] weakness I want my children to be happy
[38:04] I want my children to have I I don't
[38:07] like it whenever any one of them are
[38:08] stressed out or anxious or crying it it
[38:11] does something to me where I'm
[38:13] immediately uh worried and what do we
[38:15] need to do and are they okay is
[38:17] everything going to be all right and
[38:18] you've got to be very careful because
[38:20] that can be such a pull on you that you
[38:21] want to give give give give but it'll
[38:23] never produce the returns that you want
[38:26] them to have
[38:27] sometimes we're better off saying no and
[38:29] suffering the interim knowing that in
[38:31] the long term it will promote the right
[38:33] kind of things
[38:36] they say to us let's not be grinches
[38:38] where we're distracted even ourselves
[38:41] we're noisy the Bible says in Psalms
[38:43] verse chapter 1 verses one to three
[38:45] blessed is the man that walketh not in
[38:47] the counsel of the ungodly watch how
[38:49] this progresses first you're walking in
[38:53] the Council of the ungodly and then
[38:54] after you've spent some time in that way
[38:56] you begin to stand in the way of Sinners
[38:58] this is progression now that you've
[39:01] walked in their counsel now you stand in
[39:04] the way of Sinners and then ultimately
[39:06] you sit in the seat of the scornful
[39:09] you arrive at your throne where now
[39:11] you're the critic you're the Grinch
[39:13] you're the scorner you're the killjoy
[39:15] walk not on the Council of the ungodly
[39:17] nor stand in the way of Sinners nor sit
[39:18] in the seat of the scornful but the man
[39:20] who's blessed but his Delight blessed is
[39:22] the man whose Delight is in the law of
[39:25] the Lord I derive my joy my expectation
[39:27] my delight my pleasure is in the law
[39:29] Lord in his law in his law doth he
[39:32] meditate day and night
[39:35] meditate means is everybody ready to put
[39:37] a check mark it means to ponder
[39:41] to think deeply upon to concentrate or
[39:44] to focus your thought to give attention
[39:46] means to exclusively dedicate awareness
[39:49] that there ought to be a meditation upon
[39:51] the things of God day and night but the
[39:53] blinking neon signs of this world want
[39:56] to take our eyes off the things of God
[39:58] and we look at the the bright flashy
[40:00] things that exist within the world the
[40:03] world is is flashing I'm reminded of how
[40:05] they say that you know raccoons like to
[40:06] grab a hold of flashy things
[40:08] uh even to the point to where there's uh
[40:11] certain traps I think are fabricated to
[40:12] where it capitalizes on the fact that
[40:14] they will not less let loose their grip
[40:16] and it'll put them in a position that
[40:17] once they've reached for something it'll
[40:19] trigger and they even say even though I
[40:21] haven't been able to find maybe some
[40:23] documentation for that they will not let
[40:25] go of the flashy object right they will
[40:28] not do it because there's there's
[40:30] something they don't want to let go of
[40:32] that thing that is shining but what I've
[40:34] what I'm thinking of in terms of the
[40:36] disappointment of a raccoon as have you
[40:38] ever seen the video when they got the
[40:40] raccoon gets cotton candy
[40:42] and a raccoon likes to wash their food
[40:44] if there's water available they want to
[40:45] dip it in the water and so there's this
[40:46] video of a raccoon that gives a lot of
[40:48] this cotton candy it's like oh cotton
[40:50] candy this is great puts it in the water
[40:51] what happens it disappears and
[40:54] immediately the raccoon's like
[40:58] and that's how a lot of us are going to
[41:00] be with the things that we're all
[41:01] excited about it's going to disappear
[41:03] like that and all of a sudden like
[41:06] where'd it go it's disappeared it's gone
[41:09] there was no substance to it
[41:12] but if we Delight on the law of the Lord
[41:14] and in the law meditate day and night to
[41:17] give exclusive
[41:18] awareness too
[41:21] there's a great reward in that
[41:24] there's a replenishment of our joy
[41:27] and the sermon question and answers part
[41:30] two say sermon but it's uh
[41:32] that's when brother Brown is answering
[41:33] questions in 1964 August 23rd in the
[41:36] evening this statement here
[41:39] was the inspiration for this series
[41:42] someone gives a dream and he's talking
[41:44] about how this person is going in the
[41:46] dream but this is how he finishes the
[41:48] answer to the question because you're
[41:50] just all nervous you're all worked up he
[41:51] says and you let one member of the
[41:53] family get nervous this this is this
[41:54] statement that inspired the entire
[41:56] series to me so you know that one member
[41:58] of the family get nervous it goes to the
[42:00] next member and the next member and the
[42:02] first thing you're all fussing and going
[42:03] on
[42:05] can I get a witness
[42:07] all it takes is for one to fuss
[42:10] and then the next one fusses and the
[42:12] next one fusses and then you're all
[42:13] fussing and going on and I say let's not
[42:16] be a family full of grinches
[42:18] let one be the blocker
[42:20] say wait a minute hold on we're fussing
[42:24] what are we fussing over let's get back
[42:25] to First principles
[42:27] what are we fussing over let's get back
[42:29] to the rainbow trout
[42:31] it says and one member of the family
[42:32] gets kind of upset about something it
[42:34] upsets the other and the other and the
[42:36] other and the first thing you know the
[42:37] whole family is upset it's a ton
[42:40] right it's Santa
[42:43] that's who it is
[42:45] he says it's Satan
[42:47] that's who's doing it
[42:49] one member gets nervous the next one
[42:51] gets nervous the next one gets worse and
[42:52] we're all fussing then one member gets
[42:55] upset over something it upsets the other
[42:57] person upsets the other person and it's
[42:58] just the domino effect he says hey it's
[43:00] Satan
[43:02] he's the one that does this
[43:04] and could we have some Grace on one
[43:06] another that whenever we all get the
[43:08] fuss and we can all go wait a minute
[43:10] we know who it is it's not you it's not
[43:13] me it's Satan right and put the blame on
[43:17] him
[43:18] say hold on let's not let him get the
[43:20] victory in our home let's not let him
[43:21] get the victory out let's not let him
[43:24] sneak into our home and steal our joy
[43:26] don't let him sneak in our home and and
[43:28] take our our joy and leave with it
[43:31] fussing and take our joy and leave with
[43:33] his stressing in nervousness this is
[43:35] something I think we can be very
[43:36] conscious of that one member gets
[43:38] nervous and it can have the effect of
[43:40] making everyone else nervous one member
[43:42] can be uh upset and the next you know
[43:44] everybody get upset but if we can't have
[43:46] that kind of fortitude and discernment
[43:49] to say wait hold on let's stop it right
[43:51] here don't let it go any further it's
[43:53] not your fault it's the devil's fault
[43:55] let's invite Jesus Christ to come The
[43:59] Giver of our joy the placater of our
[44:01] anxiety let him come
[44:04] and let him have control
[44:08] he says then if one member of the family
[44:10] rejoices
[44:12] let the rest of them Rejoice with it is
[44:14] that is that not the Cure
[44:16] one's fussing another one's fussing and
[44:18] one's nervous the other one's nervous
[44:19] just start rejoicing Rejoice you know
[44:21] the right things he said when a family
[44:23] rejoices and let the rest of them
[44:24] Rejoice with it so every one of the
[44:26] family try to do that wouldn't it be
[44:29] beautiful that's what we all try to do
[44:31] as family members is rejoice
[44:33] I know it's very easy in this day and
[44:35] age maybe to be critical to point things
[44:36] out there's maybe just a culture of of
[44:38] calling things out and and there's a way
[44:41] that we can kind of nitpick and maybe
[44:43] that's the way siblings can be with one
[44:45] another but wouldn't it be great that
[44:46] even if as siblings and as young people
[44:48] and as children within the home and
[44:50] parents promoting this attitude that
[44:52] we're going to rejoice
[44:54] we're going to Rejoice with one another
[44:55] when we see one rejoice and we'll
[44:57] Rejoice with them and everyone in the
[44:59] family try to do that
[45:03] remember the Branham
[45:06] the next evening a week later
[45:09] he's asked about what kind of activities
[45:11] should children participate in and you
[45:14] know what kind of associate should you
[45:16] encourage them to have and he's saying
[45:17] hey you know make sure your children
[45:18] have Christian friends
[45:20] and he says make your home nice
[45:23] this is uh this is kind of comes with
[45:25] the idea of don't be a Grinch and this
[45:27] this this lays within the power of the
[45:29] parents make your home nice
[45:32] make your home a place where your
[45:34] daughter or son will not be ashamed to
[45:36] bring their company before their father
[45:37] and mother and into their house
[45:39] that's a I think that's the right kind
[45:41] of aspiration it's the right kind of
[45:43] thing to desire to have sometimes we can
[45:45] be so austere and we can be so severe
[45:46] and we can be so strict and we can claim
[45:48] to be so religious but what we've
[45:50] created is the wrong kind of hostile
[45:51] environment within our own homes for
[45:53] even our own children don't feel welcome
[45:54] there he says but we ought to be able to
[45:57] make our home so nice that it's a place
[45:59] that our sons and daughters would not be
[46:01] ashamed to bring their friends to he
[46:03] says make home so happy that they'll
[46:05] plea be pleased in their home to stay
[46:07] there
[46:09] that's the kind of home that we want to
[46:11] create not a a den of a grinch but a
[46:14] happy home a happy place a place that's
[46:17] inviting warm and welcoming a place of
[46:19] understanding a place of Grace he said
[46:21] that's the kind of home that we ought to
[46:22] create make your home a place where your
[46:24] children are not ashamed to invite their
[46:26] friends a place that your children are
[46:28] not afraid he says and not ashamed the
[46:30] place that they'll be happy to remain in
[46:33] to be pleased in their home to stay
[46:35] there
[46:37] it said it several months earlier almost
[46:39] a year earlier in the message influence
[46:41] he said if we made home more lovely
[46:43] children wouldn't want to run away
[46:46] right in in our Instinct just to blame
[46:48] the rebellious teenager they don't want
[46:51] to obey the word of God and we don't
[46:52] want they don't want to come under my
[46:54] thumb they don't want to subject
[46:55] themselves to Authority they don't want
[46:56] a headship and brother bear said hey you
[46:58] know what sometimes we made church more
[46:59] lovely they wouldn't run away
[47:01] if we made home more lovely children
[47:03] wouldn't want to run away he says make
[47:04] things more for them make it for the
[47:06] children where they feel welcome and
[47:08] nice and comfortable at home we're home
[47:10] they can't hardly wait till they get
[47:13] there
[47:14] and that's the way home should be
[47:16] I'm wanting to encourage this if you
[47:19] want to say oh is this the is this
[47:21] making things Merry and bright for the
[47:23] Christmas season uh absolutely
[47:26] make a conscious effort as parents to to
[47:29] uh to make your home nice to make your
[47:31] home Happy uh to create an atmosphere an
[47:34] environment Where Your Children Are
[47:35] comfortable because he says that's the
[47:37] way home should be
[47:39] home should be a happy place home should
[47:41] be a place where the children long to
[47:43] come back to there should be things that
[47:45] we're doing within our home that promote
[47:46] this continuity and this unity and and
[47:49] encourages our children encourages our
[47:51] youth he said this is what we ought to
[47:53] be these are the things that spoke to me
[47:55] in the idea of the grinches
[47:58] and we don't want to be one
[48:00] the kill Joy the grumpy person
[48:05] the person who's always trying to spoil
[48:07] somebody else's Joy
[48:09] I know a lot more could be set up on
[48:11] this angle but I want to close with a
[48:14] lengthy statement from Charles Spurgeon
[48:16] but let me just preface it with this
[48:20] your testimony before your children
[48:23] has the greatest impact
[48:26] if they see if they see a a father or a
[48:31] mother
[48:33] who are dedicated to a cause that brings
[48:36] them no joy they'll never want to be
[48:39] dedicated to that cause
[48:42] if they see that they're faithful to the
[48:44] detriment of their own peace and
[48:45] happiness then it does not it's not
[48:48] inviting to them to likewise dedicate
[48:51] themselves
[48:52] and it doesn't mean that our lives need
[48:54] to be without difficulty does not mean
[48:56] we need to live you know where we're all
[48:58] we're always wealthy and we always can
[48:59] do whatever we want always vacation
[49:01] always have that that's not it but it's
[49:02] your testimony and your attitude admits
[49:05] the trials that God and his wisdom
[49:07] allows to come to pass and when we can
[49:09] conduct ourselves with the true joy we
[49:12] can conduct ourselves with hey man
[49:14] that's awful I can't believe that
[49:15] happened but you know what things are
[49:16] going to work out everything's going to
[49:18] be fine and there's this real positive
[49:19] attitude the manner in which you carry
[49:21] yourself with the faith that you express
[49:23] with your mouth is going to have the
[49:25] utmost impact upon those who are
[49:27] observing you somebody is watching you
[49:30] somebody's watching the way you act we
[49:32] are God's Billboards we are his
[49:34] advertisements and the way that we carry
[49:36] ourselves the way that we talk the words
[49:37] that we use if we're critical then it
[49:39] speaks of Christ if we're encouraging
[49:41] then it speaks of Christ there's a way
[49:43] that we must conduct ourselves towards
[49:45] not always this negative cynicism
[49:51] yeah maybe we don't all want to just be
[49:53] a bunch of pollyanna's
[49:57] but we don't want to be the Eeyore's
[49:58] either
[50:02] and so there's something about the joy
[50:05] of salvation
[50:07] that has to be
[50:09] the Bedrock
[50:12] of our joy
[50:14] that when we when we look at that we
[50:16] know that's something that can never be
[50:17] taken away from us
[50:19] and this statement is meant so much to
[50:21] me I'm not sure if it comes from one of
[50:24] his devotionals it sounds it may be one
[50:26] of the morning evening
[50:28] Renditions that was done by his wife
[50:30] says do you believe I don't have this
[50:32] together for you so you just have to
[50:34] listen do you believe that your sins are
[50:35] forgiven
[50:37] and that Christ has made a full
[50:38] atonement for them
[50:40] this is something to be asked of each
[50:42] individual do you believe
[50:43] that your sins are forgiven that Christ
[50:45] is made a full atonement for them now
[50:47] that's something to think about
[50:49] right we talk about the joy of Salvation
[50:51] this is it what is salvation sins
[50:53] forgiven full atonement is made you are
[50:55] a possessor of God brother Branham said
[50:57] he says that you believe and he says
[50:59] then that then what a joyful Christian
[51:01] you ought to be
[51:03] I love the way that he characterizes it
[51:06] if your sins are forgiven and you're a
[51:07] possessor of eternal life if Christ has
[51:09] made a full atonement for your sins we
[51:11] could say that we are therefore
[51:12] Christians but he doesn't just say
[51:14] Christians he says what a joyful
[51:16] Christian you ought to be
[51:19] there is kind of a spin that's put on
[51:21] Christianity where there has to be the
[51:23] severity and that's austerity and the
[51:25] seriousness and the soberness that there
[51:27] was smiling and being happy and even to
[51:29] be jovial was somehow uh an indicative
[51:32] of sin and not worthy not the right kind
[51:35] of attitude that was meant for a
[51:36] Christian but I love how spurge is
[51:38] saying wait a minute if your sins are
[51:40] forgiven then joyous Christians we ought
[51:42] to be
[51:43] how you should live above the common
[51:45] trials and Troubles of the world
[51:47] since sin is Forgiven can it matter what
[51:50] happens to you now
[51:52] all right
[51:53] if sin is Forgiven does it matter
[51:55] whether or not you're able to celebrate
[51:56] Christmas does it matter if you're
[51:57] paying five bucks for what used to be a
[51:59] 98 cents 98 cents a pound or for a 10
[52:02] pound bag of potatoes you say there's
[52:04] things that we focus our sights on and
[52:06] say yeah you know what things are
[52:08] changing but there's one thing that'll
[52:09] never change
[52:10] and that he's forgiven me
[52:13] how should you live above the common
[52:15] trials and Troubles of the world is this
[52:17] not what brother Batman modest us to do
[52:18] when he said how shall we prove our
[52:20] loved for him by conducting ourselves
[52:22] with joy in this in the midst of the
[52:25] trials that he and his wisdom allows to
[52:27] come to pass I know there's a way that
[52:29] sometimes we want to let everyone know
[52:31] that we're really really going through
[52:32] it and things are really really bad and
[52:34] things are really really rough but
[52:36] listen there has to be at some point
[52:38] rising up of this unspeakable joy that
[52:41] we have inside of us who that holds at
[52:44] the end of the day
[52:48] since sin is Forgiven can it matter what
[52:50] happens to you now
[52:52] this beautiful statement that he
[52:53] attributes to Luther Luther said Smite
[52:55] Lord Smite for my sin is Forgiven if
[52:59] thou Hast but forgiven me Smite as hard
[53:01] as thou wilt
[53:03] Spurgeon adds in a similar Spirit you
[53:05] may say sin sickness poverty losses
[53:08] crosses persecution what thou wilt thou
[53:10] Hast forgiven me and my soul is glad
[53:14] could we say that thou has forgiven me
[53:17] sin sickness poverty losses crosses
[53:20] persecution whatever you will thou Hast
[53:22] forgiven me and my soul is glad
[53:26] this is where I find my worth this is
[53:28] where I find my joy this is where there
[53:31] is that beam of light
[53:36] this is where I find that in the midst
[53:38] of all the darkness and all the
[53:39] depravity God has opened up
[53:42] a ray of light
[53:43] and I don't look on this I don't look on
[53:45] that but I look
[53:47] at this light that is shining
[53:49] even if it is from but for a crack
[53:53] my soul is gladdened he said Christian
[53:55] if Thou Art thus saved wilts Thou Art
[53:58] glad
[53:59] while Thou Art glad be grateful and
[54:01] loving
[54:02] cling to that cross which took thy sin
[54:05] away serve thou him who served thee
[54:09] why you're glad be grateful and loving
[54:12] our gratitude and our loving
[54:15] is what's going to is birth from our joy
[54:19] there's times maybe someone say you say
[54:22] thank you for something and and they're
[54:24] kind of quizzed about it well did you
[54:25] really like it are you really happy with
[54:26] it well you were just being kind right
[54:28] but true gratitude is rooted in some
[54:31] sense of satisfaction
[54:33] since the joy I was talking to my
[54:35] children this evening about the title of
[54:37] the sermon I said what do you think this
[54:38] would be about they said gratitude
[54:40] and certainly it is
[54:42] for when we have found joy when we are
[54:44] glad let's be grateful and loving cling
[54:46] to the cross
[54:47] then he continues since Thou Art thus
[54:49] forgiven freely for Christ's sake go and
[54:52] tell the uh to others the joyful news of
[54:55] pardoning Mercy
[54:57] be not contented with this unspeakable
[55:00] blessing for thyself alone but publish
[55:03] abroad the story of the Cross we ought
[55:05] to still be doing this
[55:08] be not just contented to this
[55:11] unspeakable blessing for ourselves but
[55:12] publish a broader story of the cross
[55:13] holy gladness and holy boldness will
[55:16] make you a good preacher
[55:18] and all the world will be a Pulpit for
[55:19] you to preach in
[55:21] not good holy gladness and holy boldness
[55:24] those are the that's the pulpit the
[55:25] whole world
[55:26] will be a Pulpit for you to preach in
[55:28] you don't need this Pulpit this goes to
[55:30] a very very small audience but your
[55:31] lives can turn the whole world into a
[55:34] Pulpit for you to preach holy boldness
[55:36] and holy gladness
[55:38] and then this is the sum the statement
[55:40] to me that I is stuck with me from the
[55:42] first moment I ever read it cheerful
[55:44] Holiness is the most forcible of sermons
[55:49] not just holiness
[55:50] cheerful Holiness not just austerity not
[55:53] just severity not just applying the
[55:55] token not just strictness not just
[55:56] discipline not just saying what the
[55:58] tapes say but cheerful Holiness is the
[56:01] most forcible of sermons cheerful
[56:02] Holiness is the most forceful of sermons
[56:04] but the Lord must give it to you
[56:07] and that's what we must desire that's
[56:08] something that we could ask for Lord
[56:10] give me cheerful holiness
[56:12] seek it this morning before you go into
[56:14] the world
[56:15] when it is the Lord's work in which we
[56:17] Rejoice we need not be afraid of being
[56:20] too glad
[56:21] I love it if it's in the things of God
[56:24] that you are rejoice and then Rejoice
[56:26] Evermore if it is in Christ that you are
[56:28] rejoicing then Rejoice Evermore when it
[56:31] is the things of God in which we Rejoice
[56:33] we need not be fearful of ever rejoicing
[56:36] too much we need not be afraid of being
[56:39] too glad I cannot be too happy about the
[56:42] happy things he's done for me I cannot
[56:44] be too proud or to boast too much in the
[56:47] things that he's done for me that is our
[56:49] true rejoicing
[56:51] as the statement has been made there's
[56:53] no amount of real gold that you can ever
[56:55] add to the gold you have to ever turn it
[56:57] to Fool's Gold
[56:59] and so there's no amount of boast in
[57:01] Christ that you ever boast too much
[57:02] there's no amount of faith that you can
[57:04] have in the word of God will ever turn
[57:05] in the wrong kind of Faith there's no
[57:07] kind of rejoicing in the truth of God
[57:09] where you could ever be too glad
[57:13] and let it be sad of these things as a
[57:15] nervous family member an upset family
[57:17] member
[57:18] are kind of the the uh the anti to the
[57:21] rejoicing family member
[57:24] the home that is unpleasant is the anti
[57:26] to the home that is happy and the
[57:28] children are pleased to be a mean home a
[57:31] grinch home are the kind of homes that
[57:33] the children would run away from but
[57:34] when we make things welcome nice and
[57:36] comfortable it's a place that they can't
[57:37] hardly hate to be there and that's the
[57:39] way home should be that's the cheerful
[57:41] holiness
[57:43] that's the joy for Christianity that's
[57:45] that rejoicing faith that is attractive
[57:49] and let that be us in this time
[57:51] let people see not just tinsel and gifts
[57:54] and a lot of cash in the Salvation Army
[57:56] bucket but may they see a kind of
[57:58] character in this time that flash of
[58:01] lightning in a dark time that declares
[58:03] that Christ is risen
[58:05] that publishes abroad the story of the
[58:08] cross
[58:09] and let it be immense in the midst of
[58:11] our own families and amongst one another
[58:12] this forcible sermon a cheerful holiness
[58:18] oh there are a lot of grinches
[58:20] but let's not be a one of them
[58:23] could we do that together
[58:25] don't be a grinch I was taking
[58:27] suggestions for sermon titles one of
[58:28] them was grinches get stitches that
[58:31] didn't make it
[58:32] was going to do just the Grinch but then
[58:34] I thought that may just be too on the
[58:36] nose
[58:38] but let's just remember the grinches
[58:39] this season
[58:41] and purpose in our hearts that we're not
[58:43] going to be one of them
