TRANSCRIPT
========================================
so if you grab your Bibles and turn to Matthew chapter 3 I'd like to start here and looking at the Kingdom so this would be the first the first half of the service looking at the Kingdom and there's a lot for you to chew on if you just Ponder the title of Heaven's mystery Earth's glory and I do it to be thought provoking hopefully even kind of steer you a little bit in the message to study some things and read different things it says in Matthew chapter 3 verses one and two and those days Came John the Baptist so it's those days it's orienting us to a time it says preaching in the wilderness of Judea and saying this is his gospel repent ye for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand that phrase at hand is it's not just imminent but essentially it's arrived that there it's got to be preparation for it because it's it's very if it's not here it's imminently close and he's preaching to repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand and this phrase the Kingdom of Heaven is only used in The Book of Matthew it's not used anywhere else and uh they say that this particular gospel is really uh heavy towards it it's a Jewish gospel to the Jews it's used 35 31 different times in this gospel alone and this phrase the kingdom of heaven we could pull from other gospels and use the kingdom of God so we're not just trying to drill down on Kingdom of Heaven versus kingdom of God you'll find that they are related to each other Jesus even uses them interchangeably to the Rich Young Ruler I believe but to use this phrase to be preaching and then say the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand this would have significant meaning to a Jew and and if you just say it to a gentile and maybe if you said it to somebody who's not raised in church and you were said it to somebody who does is not familiar with the Bible and you just say the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand they might be thinking well what movie is that from and what book are you reading and is that is it a future kingdom is it sci-fi is it medieval and and they're thinking Kingdom and they'll be thinking something but uh they're trying to draw from some experience to figure out what you mean of the kingdom of heaven but to a Jew this would be significant to say the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand and this would be alerting them that the Messiah is near Messiah is here and so it being related to the Messiah they immediately start thinking about a lot of different scriptures and some of the most pronounced scriptures on this we can find in the Book of Daniel in Daniel chapter 2 and then also chapter seven but let's start in Daniel chapter Two and we can say that you'll find a lot of references to the kingdom as it relates to Israel or the kingdom of Judah so there's these natural kingdoms that had a natural king that's shown in the history of Judah the history of Israel or them combined as the Kingdom of Israel but that kind of just served as this placeholder for the time that the Messiah would come and so when Daniel prophesies here it's looking to this a permanent Kingdom to be established and it says in the in the days of these Kings and I know there's a lot that we're kind of skipping over but for brevity's sake the song service wasn't long enough for me to read all of the all of these verses here but says in the days of these Kings shall the god of Heaven set up a kingdom so the god of Heaven shall set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed this would be very unique to the kingdoms of Judah and Israel that uh that had already had done were unfolding during this time ones that are set up ones that are destroyed ones that have an end runs whose Thrones are constantly changing this is going to be a kingdom that God Of Heaven sets up that will not be destroyed and the kingdom shall not be left to other people that kind of is suggesting that this this kingdom is going to be a restored Kingdom that we've always believed in and thought would come but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms and it shall stand forever so as these prophecies are going forth the kingdom of God or the the god of Heaven shall set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed it'll break into pieces all other kingdoms it shall stand forever so when John comes preaching repent the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand a Jew is going to think oh this is that permanent Kingdom this is the kingdom that'll break all other kingdoms and as we often say they might be thinking oh good those Romans are going to get it and these other kingdoms are going to get it but there's it's bringing up certain things in their mind now in Daniel chapter 7 read verses 13 and 14. he said I saw on the night visions and behold one like the son of man came with the Clouds Of Heaven now this is there's a lot there's a lot here that you could chew on one like uh the son of man came with clouds of Heaven there's this image certainly there's this image we could get there and then it says and came to the Ancient of Days so one like the son of man clothed with these clouds of heaven and it comes to the Ancient of Days so there's this image of these being together and it says and they brought him near before him and there was given him dominion and glory and a kingdom this is again this is identifying what the kingdom would mean when John comes preaching the Kingdom of Heaven here we see one light the son of man with the Clouds Of Heaven coming to the Ancient of Days and they bring him forward and they'll be given him dominion and glory and a kingdom that all people Nations and languages should serve him his Dominion is an everlasting Dominion which shall not pass away and his kingdom that shall not be destroyed this is a quite a kingdom this is quite a significant Reign and they these attributes and these characteristics of the one that would be given Dominion glory and be given the kingdom and whose Rule and Reign would reach all people Nations and languages it would serve all of that they would all serve him this is the Messiah this is the Messiah Kingdom this is the one that the Jews believe the Messiah will come he will fulfill chapter two he will fulfill chapter seven uh he will all the nations and Rule all the nations and they will allow father to this light into this Kingdom and it shall not be destroyed it shall never have an end and it says it shall they shall serve him and his Dominion is an everlasting dominion and then in verse 27 it revisits it it says the kingdom and Dominion and the kingdom and dominion and the greatness of the Kingdom Under the whole Heaven shall be given to the people of the Saints of the most high whose kingdom is an everlasting Kingdom an Old Dominion Shall Serve and Obey him now just a little bit of uh amplifying of this Messiah Kingdom our Messianic Kingdom however you'd like to say it but this Kingdom and dominion and the greatness of the Kingdom Under the whole heavens shall be given to the people of the Saints of the most high so this is the work of the Messiah to where the people the chosen ones the Jews those Sons and Daughters of Abraham they're believing this is our we are going to be brought into this Kingdom and this is going to be our kingdom and it's going to be given to us the Saints of the most high and it's an everlasting Kingdom and all other dominions and all other nations and this is a clear swipe at the Gentiles or the Heathen in their eyes like yeah all these reprobates and all these other ones that who do not know God and have not served God and God has not sent prophets to revealed himself to they are going to serve and Obey him in this Kingdom and so John comes preaching the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand these are these elements of the Kingdom and then in Luke chapter 16 verse 16 as Jesus says the law and the prophets were until John so you have the law and the prophets until John so John comes preaching the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand Jesus says the law and the prophets this is where until John and then since John comes it says since that time the kingdom of God is preached and every man presseth into it now this is this is maybe a I wouldn't say critical because I don't want you to get nervous if you don't know this but John brother I'm talking about how he comes and he stands there blending two dispensations together so John is coming at the end of the law and the prophets and he is he's he's not the Capstone to it he's not the summation and finality of it but he stands there to tie two dispensations together so you have the law and the prophets that are coming to an end that are going to be fulfilled in Christ and then you have uh so you can say the two dispensations are being blinned together of Law and Grace so he stands there at this Junction at the end of the law and Prophets and and Grace is going to be coming in so it says the law and the prophets that's ending Grace is beginning and at that time John is preaching the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand and so the law and the prophets that's a specific dispensation in the Old Testament that's characterized by sending prophets it's characterized by the law and I would say it's characterized by this forward-looking prophecy to the Messiah coming and then it says since John now since John is preaching the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand and now there's a new covenant that's emerging if we say the Fulfillment of the law is at hand everything that the law and the prophet spoke to is going to be coming to pass and so when John so the law and the prophets of the Old Testament this Old Testament Kingdom we can say that he's now saying is it hand It's associated with this reign of the Messiah the coming of the Messiah so it's transitioning out of our hope is in the Messiah the hope of the Lord cometh the hope of heaven will come and all their sayings and all their songs and all their prophecies now John is saying ready yourselves because now it's coming and it's since John the Kingdom of Heaven kingdom of God is preached now the Bible touches on this in Hebrews chapter 1. verses 1 to 4 it says God who at sundry times and in diverse manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophet so the law and the prophets were until John even John being a prophet and here he's speaking to Israel and he's rehearsing in them of the Prophecies of the Messiah and there's one that is coming and God spoke in these pastimes and in different ways to Israel by the prophets but now notice this immediate change in verse 2 hath in these last days spoken unto us by his son so it's it's now it's not law in prophets now it's the prophecy that they pointed to now it's the son which was promised to come now it's not just a prophecy saying oh one day the Messiah is going to come now the son has revealed himself now the Messiah speaking so he says in these last days he spoke to us by his son whom he hath appointed arable things by whom also he made the worlds and it says who be in the brightness of his glory in the expressed image of his person and upholding All Things by the word of his power when he had by himself purged our sins set sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high that brings in that royalty that brings in the image of a kingdom this is a king this is now a son of this this eternal God this one coming who is the express image of God and now he as he has conquered and he has fulfilled these prophecies he sets down on the right hand of the Majesty on high this is the Messiah being made so much better than the angels as he hath by an inheritance obtained a more excellent Name than they this is the law and the prophets are till John but now the kingdom of God is preached and God now in the kingdom of God is speaking by his son and he is and there's something that's being made manifest and declared if you look at Matthew chapter 4 and I want you to see this because John is preaching for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand he said well there's John blending these dispensations together John being this Forerunner this prophet and then it says now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison he departed into Galilee and that kind of gives us a little bit of an itinerary leaving Nazareth he comes to Capernaum which is upon the Sea Coast as he enters there he's fulfilling prophecy that in the land of Zebulon and by the coast about Galilee the people which sat in darkness saw great light and to them which sat in the region and the shadow of death light is sprung up so Jesus goes there not just kind of haphazardly or willy-nilly but this was prophesied so the word is govern his action he's coming to these regions and then it says in verse 17 from that time Jesus began to preach and to say repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand now is he just uh is he just repeating John at this point but he's saying the same thing John did when John says repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand so now the Messiah is here so John's message is is kind of a forerunner of this of the message of the Messiah amen because he knows what's coming I say I I may just be building a platform but this is I I this is what I need to declare to you this is what I need to say he says repent for the king of Heaven is at hand and now as Christ the Messiah comes on the scene his message is mirrored already what had been foretold and he's saying repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand this is Christ now uh in fulfillment and satisfying John what he what John was to forerun he's preaching the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand so this is uh these are elements for you to consider when it comes to the kingdom of heaven now in Matthew chapter 4 verse 23 I guess maybe we're just skipping a little bit further in that uh in that chapter I think this is I I think I may just skip a little bit here but uh just make a quick emphasis it says and Jesus went about all Galilee teaching in their synagogues and preaching the gospel of the Kingdom and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people so what it's telling us he's preaching the gospel of the Kingdom it's not just about the kingdom uh the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand all right I think I hope that that means something to you other than just talking about something and being something it's not John's not just saying well you know let me tell you about this and let me describe this and all right let me get you paint a picture in your mind of something but it's not what it is is here uh what it represents what it stands for and what what's signified by scripture these things are here Jesus is repenting the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand it's here Lo the kingdom is here wake yourselves up and pay attention uh be beneficiaries of it receive it don't be caught in the stupid don't be caught in darkness light is sprung up the king of Heaven is at hand and it says he's preaching the gospel of the Kingdom and so it's the good news of the Kingdom it's the proclamation of the Kingdom so the kingdom is being preached there's something better there's something that should be thought of and conceptualized in the hearts of the Believers they hear that this is the kingdom Lord this is the kingdom the kingdom is being preached and it says healing all manner of sickness in all manner of diseases among the people brother Brown talks about the kingdom being ushered in the Gentile Kingdom being ushered out if we could use that as he's talking about the Gentile Church being I should end he talks about how the kingdom was ushered in by the supernatural he says it comes in by the supernatural it'll go out by the Supernatural and so here the kingdom has be is being ushered in by the supernatural and as he preaches and he declares these things the gospel of the Kingdom says he's healing all manner of sickness and all men are disease among the people and and I want to emphasize this and hopefully in doing so if I could say this hopefully it'll promote more miracles instead of maybe stifling it but when it says he's preaching the kingdom and he heals all manner of sickness and all manner of diseases these signs and wonders that are manifesting himself the kingdom is not just healing it's not just signs it's not just wonders but these were the consequences of the Gospel being preached and so if I could say and I'm careful this was evidence of the Kingdom this was an these were evidences of a greater power because sickness operates according to the law of sin and death and and there are certain things that doctors can diagnose and there's certain symptoms that one could see and say oh this person has this condition and this is a blood issue and this person has this disease and this person has leprosy and this person has the dropsy and all these different things that people could identify and they could treat symptoms and they may even know the cause and all you must have gotten this you must have drank that or been exposed to this and and science can start to operate in a realm of the law well this is what happens is you get this infection and this is how it progresses and you have to wait till it runs its course or this is how you treat it but then Jesus comes and he's interrupting that and that there's a though we see it in just quick glimpses in the Old Testament in raising the dead he's taking the Law of death and saying let me just I play the reverse card on that and let's raise them back up again and so it's not to say that oh that is the sum and substance of the Kingdom healings and miracles and signs and wonders but it's it's something that's done to show that the kingdom is a higher Kingdom than the order of men this this is a departure from this ordinary course that this is this is what happens to people when they get cancer but when Jesus comes preaching the kingdom is at hand and someone's healed of cancer is to signify that this is different than the kingdoms of this world if Jesus came as a great War General or as one who is a great debater but let me just or maybe lean into the thought of him being a warrior and he can learn how to he knew how to write a chariot he knew how to ride a horse and he knew how to wield a sword and it was just some sort of uh as we would see in modern day superhero where he could just do uh he could maybe not quite superhero but maybe just somebody that knew All the Right Moves right like a Kung Fu Master and he had this way where he could just uh defend himself against anything and he could he could just uh nobody could get the jump on him and so he could just uh he could bully the Romans and if Jesus had come in and by Charisma and by military might and training get together a band of soldiers and Chase out the Romans that Kingdom would be no different than the Romans who came in and took over that Kingdom would have been no different than any other kings and kingdoms that have toppled other governments is this would have been the ordinary course of history and Jesus would have been joining a long list of revolters and revolutions but Jesus comes doing something saying whoa the king of Heaven is at hand and diseases are being healed the dead are being raised and things are taking place to signify this is a different Dominion this is a different Power this is a different Authority brother random says this and God's power to transform and I would say in some of these sermons that we're reading from or really any one of these there's more more meat on these bones than I'm sharing and you can go back and listen to these he says there'll be no automobiles or nothing that science has ever done he's talking about the future in the future home in that Eternal Kingdom and I believe we read this maybe in the series on Divine Healing he said there'll be no such things in the world that is to come but it'll be God's Own type of civilization that he'll set up in the Glorious reign so God that we we look at this worldly civilization and what it's characterized Automobiles and Science and uh and construction and all these different things we had the opportunity to be in a high-rise that's under construction in downtown Vancouver and the technology and the science and the things they're able to do and and how that industry it works it's fascinating we are looking down into a four-story pit where they're tunneling in a subway system in downtown Vancouver and the roads that all these cars are driving on are just suspended in air I guess maybe it was a little concerned as the big huge sewage pipe was being held up by truck straps you're thinking this is very interesting I wouldn't want to be working in that pit but this is It's just amazing what man is accomplishing and what man can do but brother says it's not gonna be like that in God's civilization there's a lot of things we see in the Civil civilization we're like wow that's incredible but brother Branham says the reason why man has advanced as much as he has in the last hundred years is because he let loose his faith in God and has given himself over to his own inventions and his own wisdom and they've been able to accomplish extraordinary things that that can mesmerizes to this day so I try to get your head around modern technology I'm still trying to figure out how vinyl disc can play with music how can it do it how can it play it back how are grooves in a record disc Abel hardly able to put it on it and how can a needle play it back so I'm still stuck in the vinyl age let alone all this other stuff but there's the kingdom of God so far beyond that and and it's a greater power and a greater Authority a greater dominion and he's saying it in God's glorious Reign we won't have this he says for in this civilization there is sickness death sorrow Graves and want there's that neediness that lacking this want he says but in that Kingdom that is to come There Is No Death no sorrow no sickness no old age why does that tell us that when Christ comes preaching the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand and then we see the healing all manner of sicknesses and all manner of diseases it's signifying that God's kingdom doesn't have that that God's kingdom does not have sorrow does not have death does not have sickness does not have old age so it is the power of the Kingdom these things are related to uh the effect of the Kingdom that would drive away sickness that would drive away sorrow that would cause one to raise to death because that's the power and the law of that Kingdom that's being preached amen and so this Kingdom is of Heaven it's it's God's civilization the way he would want to arrange things it's from this Kingdom it's from the divine it's not it's not what man can do man can set a bone and it can heal man can topple kingdoms a men can build things and and think of what man could accomplish but now Jesus is doing something that even his critics would say now we know no man can do the things he you're doing except they come from God Jesus even arguing can Satan's kingdom be divided and showing that the signs and wonders that's not the end all but that's the evidence of the power of the Kingdom and so I'd like to read two statements I think I have these in the slideshow from this first one from Countdown the countdown and this is there's a whole lot here so this would be one you could just jot down quickly and meditate on this as science achieves something Looking Backward now he's using justification sanctification back to the Holy Ghost these countdown principles I Believe by the Chris you Minister on these very things last sometime last year I believe in these the principles you go to the countdown messages brother I'm trying to show the sync with sequencing and what we've unfolded to in this astronaut age trying to show a difference between the the ages that have unfolded previously and then demonstrating science has achieved this God achieves but now science achieves something looking backwards so even the civilization of automobiles and these things that's going backwards because brother Branham says God's power to transform him what do they get what is science doing leading to more death some of the greatest factors in death these days whether it be heart disease or car accidents you could trace it back not to the original but to man's own devices in man's own invention so they're just discovering more death they're just bringing upon themselves More Death because science achieves backwards but God achieves if we say a science achieves going backwards God achieves going this way going forward to the kingdom so this is how that God moves when God does something he's always moving and inching towards the Kingdom so let's just say we don't we have no idea if we just assume for a moment we have no idea what the kingdom is this is an important principle to grasp even it goes all the way back to the beginning in the beginning what God is doing is he moves he's always moving ever closer to whatever this principle is of the Kingdom that when God speaks when God creates when God unfolds things it just inches ever so closely towards the kingdom we say well we don't know what that is but God does and this is what he's trying to accomplish so I would say that in everything God has ever done God is always moving forward toward the kingdom and that God doesn't take the step back man does so when God builds this evening and he comes this perfect creation and then the serpent is beguiled first I guess the serpent is inhabited by Satan and beguiles the woman that's not God taking a step back that's Satan causing mankind to fall back but when God now is going to the next thing he does even in uh calling Noah even call neighbor he's just ever so closely with each step if you look hard enough he's unfolded a little bit more about the kingdom because this is what God does he's always moving forward to the kingdom now if we could take that as a principle then this kingdom is God's aim this kingdom is God's desire this Kingdom has something to do with God as Jesus comes preaching the kingdom of the preaching the gospel of the kingdom and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease and it's called the Kingdom of Heaven and the Bible says that God the god of Heaven shall set up a kingdom this is a Divine Kingdom now in the sermon the world is again falling apart I might I might hit a point where the filter you're gonna have to come up and finish your song list just to give me you might get me to go maybe 10 more minutes of a song sir so I can at least preach an hour tonight which brother Chris said that you're only remembered by how long you are compared to the last guy who preached you were over an hour but not by much the sermon the world is again falling apart this is just this countdown and these two are just I think principles that stand on their own that you can chew on that you can really get a lot of uh a lot of weight from he says in this word and he's the way that it's written or the way that he speaks it he's talking about this Bible he said this word is the kingdom this this word he says and if we want to kind of uh if we want to do embody that in the black and white or the the the the ink and the Indian paper this Bible represents the kingdom in written form and we know that this then in written form that there's a manifestation of this so we wouldn't just limit it to what's been published because in this word is the kingdom this is the king and the kingdom he says the system the life it's every bit right in here so if I could say this the kingdom of heaven or the kingdom of God is the word and as this is the word in written form the Bible holds the seeds or maybe I can say this way holds the revelation of the Kingdom because he says the word is the kingdom this is the king and the kingdom which and some of the future Services we could get more into just even what that phrase means Kingdom that word the etymology of it but he says the system and the life so the word the Bible if you look at it just as the Bible being the written word of God it's expressing to us a revelation of the Kingdom the revelation of the king and the kingdom that it re it reveals and it holds these seeds of the system and the system and it invites a thought of thinking that God has some order God has some construct there's something that the kingdom represents and and it has it it has an image and it has a uh transactions and it has a power and it has laws if I could use that and I I find that you try to describe this and you Resort you have to resort to human language to describe it but this is the Kingdom of Heaven is the word it is it has a system it is a life and he says it's every bit in the word of God and so as we touch on that in we kind of enter into this next part that's the kingdom of Heaven that's the kingdom of God those are the those are things that we're thinking about when we use that phrase in our title The Kingdom but now if I could take I want to grab a little bit more Foundation because that's certainly not exhaustive in terms of just even a foundation I wouldn't be satisfied in my heart if I was going to do a series on the kingdom just stopping there and calling that a foundation so I want to continue a little bit and grab a little bit more Foundation or lay a bit more Foundation but as I do this I want you to get an idea of what the foundation looks like and if you can get idea idea of the foundation that gives you some understanding of the footprint of what goes on top of it and so as I kind of grab some of these little a little bit more of the foundation I want to preach under the second half of this sermon in a way that would assume as if all the other parts have been preached that instead of for me this is where I feel it maybe it's a little bit different for me the way that God usually works with me is I see something and then I just start God just kind of works me back and works me back and then I just start building to that and I keep that image in mind and sometimes what God's doing is he's crystallizing that a little bit more or I'm realizing that we he wants to come at it from these different angles and then in my mind I'm always thinking I want to preach that last sermon that just kind of ties it all up in a really neat pretty bow and I say this is what we were tracking all along and so what I what I want to say tonight it's going to be very very simple so if the build up lets you down I apologize uh but there's it's and there's something to this that this is what's been burning inside my heart through all even all these sermons I've been preaching on perfect love this this has just been burning in my heart of this of this conclusive I can call this is the conclusion of the Kingdom Heaven's mystery and Earth glory and so if you could take Acts chapter one and the Beautiful part is is if you just keep it a secret everybody else who comes is gonna be like what is this about and you're like well I don't know I don't know you'll have to just go stick around for the rest and you'll know because you were here in Acts chapter one maybe we'll put this one behind a password this will be for the uh patreon subscribers and Acts chapter 1 verses 4 to 9 we read verse 6 in our a text he says and being assembled together with them commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem but wait for the promise of the Father which saith he ye have heard of me a lot that we could call you back to what she's referring to so for John truly baptized with water but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence so John is preaching the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand and they're bringing forth fruit meat of repentance and John is baptizing but what John preached wasn't the Fulfillment of the promise John was pointing to the one because he said himself hey I baptize you with water but there's one coming after me he'd have a spiritual baptism a greater baptism so it's it's he Christ he's the one that ushers in these elements of the kingdom and so he says you're going to be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence now that's according to a prophetic barrier or a boundary it was the day of Pentecost had to fully come they couldn't pray hard enough and fast hard enough earlier to get it God had to wait until that day so he says when they therefore were come together they asked of him saying Lord thou at this time restore again the Kingdom of Israel now we read in Daniel chapter 2 Daniel chapter seven these are the those scriptures would have been in the hearts of these disciples when they said now is this the moment in nowhere they're trivializing what he's done because they recognize the great signs and wonders the miracle of his death and Resurrection and so there's this Faith this confidence in him and he's confirming his presence with them and he's ministering to them and he's appearing and they realize this is different this is one that has been raised from the dead we knew that he was dead we saw him crucified now he's alive amongst us eating uh uh fish and he's walking and he's materializing himself before us and so now they're thinking now is this the moment that Daniel 2 is going to be fulfilled well will you now somehow present yourself as the Messiah and not just in a in a way of mocking him but declare himself the king of the Jews that this is the Messiah this is the long-awaited one will you restore the kingdom to Israel that's permanent Everlasting Kingdom and he says this and maybe bring in remember God's always moving forward to the kingdom so they're looking for the kingdom they want to see it restored and his answer we might take to mean uh well forget about that I I forget about that but pay attention that God has to be moving toward that that if if this is God speaking it has to be something that moves forward he can't take them back to something else he's not going to go back to the days of John he's not going to go back to the days of his Earthly Ministry there's got to be another advancement that takes place he says it's not for you to know the times or the seasons which the father have put in his own power no doubt Jesus in answering this is answering to their expectation and could say that no this is not the time for a millennial Reign this is not time for an eternal Kingdom as you would think it to be so it's not given to you to know these things in these times and seasons for these different manifestations but now notice what he says next but ye shall receive power now to them who were believing that it shall be given to the people the Saints of the most high an everlasting Kingdom and power and Dominion he's now telling him and telling them in a language that has something to do with Dominion but you will receive power but are you going to restore the kingdom he says wow as you are envisioning certain things to come to pass it's not given to you to know these different times or seasoned which are according to God's delegation and dispensation but you shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you this is the promise which he shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost in verse 5. he says when the Holy Ghost comes upon you and ye shall be Witnesses Now watch how this language would hearken back to uh this the kingdoms who will be that all people Nations and languages will serve and it says and you shall receive power and you're going to be Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and in Samaria and under the uttermost part of the Earth now there's no doubt and I guess maybe there is some conjecture on my part that if somebody had had the Scrolls open in the Old Testament and said will you restore the kingdom and All Nations and all tongues and all people be gathered to you and Jesus and this is what he's they're asking well this this Kingdom be restored now and then when Jesus says no well it's not given you to know these times but you're going to receive power and then begins to use the language that if someone was look looking at both they would say hmm right yeah all right who's with me I might just lock all right I just might lock my eyes on you can you see this that there's that there's this overlapping now the language that Jesus is using is not this sudden departure from what the Jewish Jewish Believers are looking for and what their expectations are but now he says this but you will receive power and when he had spoke these things why they beheld he was taken up now this part to me is this incredible inversion and a cloud received him out of their sight the Jews were expecting and believing that the kingdom was to be established on Earth so they ask is the kingdom now being established on Earth and they would have read of this time when the one like the son of man comes with the Clouds Of Heaven and now he says uh well let's not get ahead of yourselves but you will receive power and you will prophesy and you'll be a witness and you'll be a testimony to all tongues and Nations and people and around the whole world and verse 8 that is pointing them forward and saying now don't be looking back uh don't be just gazing up as the Angels begin to say but do what he said because he thou points them forward to the king the mystery of the Kingdom here you're looking for the kingdom well you will receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you and then you're going to be Witnesses and Jesus had said in Luke 24 49 Tara ye in the city of Jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high what does that say power from 100 a power from heaven this is a power from the kingdom of heaven this is the kingdom coming so when he says that you shall receive power of being dude with power from on high and you're asking about the kingdom being restored you shall receive power and you're going to be Witnesses in Jerusalem which would have been the seat of the Messiah Kingdom to them and then and then witnesses to all Judea Samaria are the most parts of the earth he has a way of just in one sentence kind of summarizing all the hopes of Israel that the Messiah would Rule and reign with the rod of iron Over All Nations and the Gentiles would come to his life from around the whole world and they would Reign together with him he says you will receive power and then this I say this beautiful inversion because now as he says this a cloud receives him out of their sight which is a sign of the Kingdom which to them when the Messiahs to appear he's going to come in the Clouds of heaven with the clouds of heaven and now a cloud uh it takes and kind of envelops him and he leaves their sight at this sign of the cloud is what's given at the time that he has departed he has sent it up on high it's in the same way in which you have seen him disappear there will be a sign when he appears again and so this this Kingdom coming then we could continue to read how when the day of Pentecost is fully come they are baptized with the Holy Ghost and the Bible says they are filled with the Holy Ghost this is the power that they are now endued with and God is establishing the kingdom in man by the baptism of the Holy Ghost by the New Birth the new birth which is the baptism of the Holy Ghost there now is a new kingdom that lives inside of them whereas by your natural birth you're subject to the laws of nature part of the you're part of Kingdom different kingdoms and phylums and genres and Geniuses and species these are all things that you find yourself in but now when you're born again this is a different Kingdom and brother Bram says in the sermon the falling part a part of the world he says Peter on the Pentecost opened the door to the kingdom he did the kingdom had just been set up at Jerusalem I want some man to tell me that the church began at Rome I want somebody to prove that to me the church never begin at Rome the church began in Jerusalem the kingdom was set up on the day of Pentecost now the day of Pentecost and now there's certain things you can hyper focus on oh they all spoke in tongues and and this happened and that's the sign and that's the evidence of the Holy Ghost but what you see is the Holy Ghost indwelling flesh brother I think it's a deity of Crisis he returned back on the day of Pentecost now now there's a there's a coming for you to think about he's ascended up into heaven and then he returns back into the Jews uh on the on in who they're in the upper room on the dead Pecos and the Holy Ghost indwells them this is the comforter this is giving them new life this is birthing them this is the birth of the church Barrett says the kingdom is set up for the day of Pentecost why because now deity is living in manner now they have a new life a new they're new creatures this is this changes the old order whereas before they would live a natural life and they would plunge into a natural grave but now for the events of the death burial and Resurrection now they are guaranteed eternity now they have their place in the great beyond and by the baptism of the Holy Ghost he says the kingdom is being set up on the day of Pentecost then is it any wonder that as the kingdom is being established on the day of Pentecost that those who are now are bearing the the kingdom go out amongst all those gathered in Jerusalem in the day of Pentecost and they begin to speak in what is seemed called unknown tongues but now all men hear it in their own language what this is this is why I call this the conclusion because you begin to recognize something that when they went out and they began to speak God God wants the Kingdom of Heaven to be translated in a way that we can understand it he wants it to be real it wasn't he wants it to be grasp he wants it to be understood Hallelujah the kingdom has been being established he says set up on the day of Pentecost and it's signified wherein every man is hearing hearing in his own language why because that's what the kingdom was to do All Nations and tongues and languages would serve him and it says and these thousands are added to the kingdom that day wow so then let me and again there may be something it may not satisfy me to say some of these things without more background so I'm preaching it assuming I've already preached all the other parts and so this is just a little trick I'm playing on myself a little psychology it's like you've already preached all the other parts go ahead and take a risk just say it without trying to prove it through 45 Services because it's nothing but the truth and it's on Luke chapter 17 verses 20 and 21. I guess I could say this the Lord had uh dealt very strongly with my heart to minister out of the series we preached on our family tree to minister on that and in Cloverdale and I was certainly happy to have such a broad Foundation when you go and just preach one sermon knowing that wow you've got all this foundation of the word of God you're standing upon to be able to present something in obedience to the Lord to his people so now it says here in Luke chapter 17 and we're just assuming that Foundation is there tonight right and Luke chapter 17 verses to 20 to 21 and when he was demanded of the Pharisees when the kingdom of God should come so the disciples had the question after the Resurrection the Pharisees have this question pre-resurrection when is the kingdom of God going to come if you're the Messiah then you you should know this if you're the Son of God you would know this he answered them and said now this is remarkable this is really a mouthful the kingdom of God cometh not with observation now this is of there's a lot in this and I know you'd be in Bible students and especially listening to the message of the hour you know how brother Branham addressed these things and talked about these things the king of God comes not with observation now certainly we could take just that phrase and we could unpack it in a lot of different ways but if one would come with military might in toppling governments you know all you have to do is see the one flag lowered and the other one raised you say that's a new kingdom we got them he planted the Messiah flag on Temple Mount where we've arrived this is we're here but he said it doesn't come with observation neither shall they say Lo here or Lo there all right oh behold the Messiah will come suddenly to this Temple and they're looking for these things to happen they're looking for these things to be fulfilled I said oh well he's here and oh he's there he says for behold the kingdom of God is within you now one could take this and say well the kingdom of God is among you no question the Messiah is there the kingdom is amongst them Christ now in just this microcosm embodies the kingdom he has a perfect reflection of it because now he's demonstrating he can walk on water not anybody the man Kingdom the animal kingdom can't can't demonstrate these things of multiplying creation and speaking out to creation and stopping the winds and walking on water and raising the dead Christ we can say the kingdom is with them but he doesn't use the language that just says the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand and and I you just wonder just how much more Force this may have landed it may be one thing for John to say the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand and one thing for Jesus to say repent the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand for them to just kind of turn it into it and say the kingdom of God is within you question that uh uh that was had Nicodemus had of you know well we know that you must be come from God and Jesus says well hey you cannot because what's the what's this Rabbi what's this Pharisee what's a scribe what are they all looking for the Messiah the Messiah the Jewish religion is built on the coming of the Messiah this says all their hopes you say while the Jews they don't eat this and they wear this and they worship here and they do all these things but everything points to the kingdom and this is this is the this would the Fulfillment of their faith even today would be the Messiah to come in fulfillment of the law and the prophets and so as the question is asked even Nicodemus when he asked the question Jesus is very quick just to say hey uh you know except the man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God brother ma'am tells us how that that's to understand and then he says well how can a man enter into his mother's womb and be born again he says I I say unto you except the man be born of water and spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God that which is flesh is flesh that was Spirit of spirit so he says Marvel not when I send you you must be born again that's that's quite a statement and and it's addressing this misunderstanding or I maybe I shouldn't just say shouldn't say misunderstanding it's addressing what their what the materialization of their faith will look like you understand in other words if they have all these hopes Jesus is saying wow if you ever if you want to see it this is what it's going to take this is what it's going to look like so brother Berman the sermon sermon proving his word Jesus said except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom in other words understand the kingdom because the kingdom is the Holy Spirit In You [Music] that's the kingdom the kingdom of God is within you so now Jesus I Repent the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand and Jesus is saying the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand and we we find this happening at a time when the heavens have opened up and the spirit descends Upon Jesus like a dove as his behold this is my son and the and and the Father the Lord God comes to dwell in Christ who had been born of the woman apart from sex but here is this the king of Heaven the king of Heaven being represented in Christ he's preaching he's displaying the power of the Kingdom he's preaching the gospel of the Kingdom oh I I can't preach to the whole Ministry of Jesus Christ but think of what was manifested in the days of his flesh culminating his death burial and resurrection and now he's saying that the kingdom of God is within you and he says the kingdom is the Holy Spirit In You I hope this gives not just color or context but just a much more deeper meaning to what it means to be born again a much deeper intimacy with God's promises when I realize I have the Holy Ghost I it has not just made me a religious person it has not just made me a Christian it has not just made me subject to the gifts but if I had the Holy Ghost dwelling on the inside of my soul then the kingdom of God is within me oh I hope that that could have more Force hope that it could have more weight to you tonight I thank God that you're here I thank God that you sacrificed I thank God that you you make it a matter of commitment to be in the service and I say Let It Be A payoff tonight to understand this baptism in a greater way than it is the kingdom inside of you and Paul if you want to get a head start on this maybe read Hebrews chapter 12. and even in Mount Zion he writes in this conclusion way wherefore we receive in a kingdom which cannot be moved is Paul not hearkening back to Daniel 2. is he not pointing him back to Daniel 7 and I'm just taking those because you remember in all the other parts where we use many more scriptures on this the the assumed ones I see I had to finish the joke that time and so someone asked me I spoke at the graduation banquet um Saturday night and someone said how does it feel brother Aaron to tell a joke in 95 of the people don't get it and I said it's the most amazing feeling in the world seriously see what I did there he says we receive in a kingdom which cannot be moved this is the kingdom he says we've received it now I'll say this and this is a whole series in itself and I may have already said it to you I know I've said it in Fellowship maybe I've already said it in my preaching I and if I have if this is emphasis repetition for uh to make emphasis here that when Paul is preaching and he's preaching Christ and preaching Christ on him crucified we look at Paul and Peter and all these other Jews as their conversion out of Judaism into Christianity and so he said oh well we have the Old Testament in the old Covenant now we have the New Covenant and Paul is converted he's no longer a Pharisee of the Pharisees he's converted from his old Faith to a new faith and you miss a lot if you think of it that way Paul wasn't converted to a new faith hello come on somebody trying to think of all the phrases that work sometimes he wasn't converted to a New Faith he had found the Fulfillment of his faith so Paul's not preaching a new Faith Paul's not preaching a new gospel Paul's not trying to bring them into some newfangled idea he's trying to say that's what the book of Hebrews represents to us he's trying to say look everything you believed in everything you hoped for every type every shadow every Prophet this isn't a new religion this isn't a new cultish idea this is the satisfaction of the Jewish faith so his conversion but he says we've received the kingdom this isn't some new mystic thing that happens apart from what they believe you're saying this is everything a Jew ever longed for and looked for now if I could just say this this message is in the same pattern brother Brown's message doesn't come up with some cultist idea it's not a conversion from Christian faith it's a message to all Christians and to all believers to all ages that let me say this and let me declare it Jesus Christ is the son of God there is only one God there's only one Lord Jesus Christ and you'll deny him to your own Peril brother Branham does not come preach in another gospel he said this is everything you've ever believed in amen this is the Fulfillment of the Gentile faith it's not a conversion to some new idea it's a satisfaction of it he says we receive in a kingdom which cannot be moved let us have Grace oh and this is this is something you've received a kingdom that will never be destroyed Be Without End and if if you had said that maybe to the Pharisees who came to Jesus to win the kingdom of God uh be restored he says well the kingdom of God is within you and no doubt may be a zealot is going yeah let's do this right find that ax murder where's this where's the axon where's the Spears and the javelin you know let's go do this and right in their minds they're thinking one thing the Pharisees thinking yeah king of God's inside of me I need Zeal I need these I need to top all these Roman governments and and maybe even in saying this we receive a kingdom which cannot be moved oh well what would that do and motivate a Hebrew what would how would they then think oh I know this Kingdom this Kingdom will know no end this Kingdom has no no barriers around the Earth all kingdoms all governments all lands Everything Is Ours what ought that to do Paul how can I then how can I then be the the best for the kingdom he says let us have Grace let us have Grace whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear Kingdom a kingdom and its power can be manifest in Grace in reverence and godly fear let me it's not a weak Kingdom it's not a weak gospel it's a gospel of power but we can't wield it in arrogance we can't wield it in Pride we can't see it being effective through intimidation but if we have Grace and then Brethren Bradham says and the seed shall not be here with the shuck I I'll have just uh I just need to quickly gloss over this well let me ask I'm gonna take a poll who wants me to stop right now and we'll pick this up later raise your hand nope I'm just looking at the young people the kids here because there's maybe enough of you you guys don't realize how powerful you are not one person raise their hand so all right cut the stream this won't be archived we'll just make this for the local Folk again they don't do it matches the kingdom of God which is in the Earth today can never be set up justly on a permissive will he said it's got to come back to his perfect will the kingdom cannot be set up justly rightly correctly on permissive will remember how we explored uh the and in the beginning how that brother Bradham or we see that God allowed mankind to come to a first birth and that's permissive will but now he's saying You must be born again why the kingdom couldn't be established on permissive will Christ came as a spoken word Son of God apart from the original sin why the kingdom could never be made manifest on perfect will therefore we cannot relate to interact with and be beneficiaries of and find our place in the Kingdom on permissive will so the first birth leads us back to a second birth and we've got to come back to his perfect will and let me say this not just into the birth but in our lives the kingdom cannot be rightly justly righteously established by permissive will it's got to come back to his perfect will the kingdom which is on Earth today this is part of Heaven's mystery and I just take back anything I ever said about song service length and stuff like that it's just confusing for me I I don't I only count by my hourly rate so this is just getting too hard for me the kingdom he says which is on Earth today did you catch that part the kingdom which is on Earth today this is part of Heaven's mystery now let me I want to preach now I the LIE of Catholicism and start paying attention to this the shadows of Catholicism are strong in Christianity Today in a really strong even within the message and things are done in the name of apostleship and things are done in the name of church order and things are done in the name of reverence to the message which are not detached from the spirit of Catholicism and I'm not trying to put that on leadership I'm putting it on individuals who follow that there's a lot of things we do and it's no more than Catholicism rebranded and so with having said that mouthful listen to this mouthful the lies of Catholicism have watered down this life brother says the Kingdom of Heaven which is on Earth today catholicism's lie is that this life has now been watered down to a decision between hell and heaven that this is what our decision is and it divides this is that this is the conclusion this is a summation it has divided eternity between hell and heaven right this is this is what all Christianity points to virtually and I say nominal Christianity is you're here on Earth as a sinner to make your decision where you want to spend eternity do you want to accept Christ as your personal Savior and spend eternity in heaven or do you want to deny Christ and spend your eternity in hell and what they've done is they've turned Earth into this temporary uh hodgepodge of experiences and temptations to where we've got to make our decision whether or not we want to be saved and spend eternity in Hell or spend our eternity in heaven and part of that equation is and this is where it comes back to for God so loved the world part of that equation is that Earth then is destroyed and Heaven and Earth shall pass away and there'll be a new Heavens A New Earth and so then Earth is just this temporary Proving Grounds you're going to make your choice you'll be in Hell For Eternity in heaven for eternity and then all eternity is bookended by hell in heaven but Jesus says in Matthew chapter 13 verses 10 and 11. the disciples come to him this is after he's given a parable he says why speak is thou unto them in parables foreign Chris brought in um what you identify as like well there's a we identify with them all right one of them and she is him I don't know what the confusion is he says this in verse 11 he answered and said to them because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven but to them it is not given that's 8 30. I want you to just concentrate for just a few more moments here then if you just read this chapter alone and we're not taking any other thing into view except chapter 13. Jesus gives different Parables of the Kingdom of Heaven and as he gives these Parables I'm in no way trying to water them down I mean not trying to trivialize them or just try to oversimplify them but I want you just to catch this brother Branham says the kingdom of the whole kingdom is the Holy Spirit In You and Paul says we've received a kingdom so let us have Grace and serve God acceptably with reverence and fear Brethren says the kingdom was set up on the day of Pentecost Jesus said the kingdom of God is within you and then and then if we just could understand that the disciples went out and if they had some idea that the Messiah is going to materialize and governments are going to be changed and it's going to be this Millennial what we'd call me like a millennial type Reign it doesn't happen they go on Marion they go on having wives and and children and propagating churches and spreading the gospel and so Jesus gives different Parables of the kingdom and each one when he uses it and I do not believe it was just merely the construct he would use so that people could understand but it's always say this way in it each one he uses some aspect of just everyday life and it wasn't just this is the part I went emphasize it wasn't just so that we could be like oh okay yeah like this but if I could say this it has something to do with it it wasn't like well in heaven in heaven there won't be Fields per se or in heaven there won't be this per se in heaven I mean there's not like a literal net but it's like this right you know like a group doesn't like the Beatles or something no it's not just trying to say it's like something he said he's wanting the parable to convey something and he uses all these Earthly examples the sowing of the seed and the Harvest of those seeds that there's going to be the sowing of wheat and there'll be a harvest of wheat but then there's also the sowing of tears and there'll be a harvest of tears and you get the image of one that's sowing a good seed and harvesting that and that even bad seed that sowed and a harvest of that and you'll find that has specific application in our lives both naturally and spiritually and then he goes into the casting of the net and how the nest is cast out in what it catches and brings in and so you have the image of one who's a farmer and one who's a gather you have an even image of one who is a hunter and these are means of planting that they might get bread they might get seed there'd be a harvest of that there's the effort of fishing that they might get things that they could sell things that they could eat and then he goes not just to the sowing of seed but it's the Harvest of those sea seeds so then it's the use of the things planted in the parable of the mustard seed and how it starts out small and it grows and it gives shade and it gives uh comfort and these different things that it does even with the the wheat how he's going to use the wheat flour and going to bake something and how you use the use of the wheat and even the the adding of the leaven these are all images where one is making a cake one is fishing one is plowing one is doing this and even down to where the Parables of the Kingdom in a treasure hid in the field and a pearl of great price there's trans they're selling there's buying there's transacting I say all the elements of life the needs of Life the Necessities the library says seek ye first the king of God and all these things will be added unto you you could fast forward to Matthew Chapter 13 and in the planting and the watering and the sowing and the baking and the fishing and all the labor that you can say these are the things that have to do with natural life and this is what what's being expressed here is not that we can say Oh Heaven oh Earth but then we can see the kingdom is associated with these things that the kingdom being typed as this can be manifested in this I I'm losing my voice tonight but I hope that you can see this that when he gives these Parables it was to take heaven and bring it down to earth and I would say the kingdom is Heaven's mystery revealed his Earth's Glory I look given you know to know the mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven and the midst of the Kingdom of Heaven is represented where'd that come from it's represented in the sower in the seed in the Harvest in the cultivation and I realize this is this is everyday life that this is where the glory is there's so much division there's so much separation and the Catholics just want you to say well I choose Jesus and one day I'm going to go to heaven for eternity or if you'd reject Jesus you're going to go to hell I I would say and let me say this in this great glorious hour we're living in if you think Christianity is just a choice between heaven and hell you're going to miss the most glorious aspects of Christianity and there's the smallest seeds of this are in that decision and where you end up in eternity but let me say that heaven's mystery is revealed now in Earth's Glory and the revelation of this topple Satan's agenda I believe that we ought not to be so consumed with where we'll spend eternity but be concerned with how much Heaven Can manifest on Earth let your will be done on Earth as it is in heaven I'm not satisfied with going to Eternity I long to see eternity birthed here and brother Branham says in Christ is the mystery of God revealed I think do I have this statement there good we belong to a kingdom I know my daughter Eliza will like this a little it's a kind of artsy in the Kingdom is the word of God made spirit and life in our own life the word of God heaven our own life Earth together make the kingdom and red and blue make purple I think someone said white but I'm starting all over the kingdom is the word of God made spirit and life in our own life he said this word is the kingdom this is the king and the kingdom the system and the life every bit right here and let's say that he put the Bible out there but can you say tonight sisters can you say tonight brothers that the kingdom is right here let the kingdom is the word of God made spirit and life in my own life bringing to pass every promise in this day as it did in that day when the word and God Was Won what is he pointing to not just in the beginning was the word but Jesus Christ who came bearing the characteristics of the Kingdom he says in the word and God is one in his church today making it the headship of the body that is redeemed to bring back the message in the last day and be taken up from the dead and the resurrection to go back and restore again was he said in the sermon the kingdom in its right position as Adam and Eve in the beginning In the Garden of Eden the world that God loved the threefold mystery of God his body the kingdom is the union of divinity heaven and Humanity Earth that's the kingdom and so when they when we take this life and we just this is why I say that this Revelation and I'm not saying the Revelation I'm preaching but what I'm trying to point you to tonight that it's not a choice between hell and heaven and that we're not just Holding On by God's grace that we're going to make it into the Millennium and make it into the eighth day but when you recognize that God this is it this is the Clincher right here that God all along wanted the Kingdom right here this is where he wanted it not in heaven and not in hell he didn't want a place where there was the absence of the Kingdom he wanted to where there'd be a he did not want a place to exist where the kingdom of God would not be therefore hell will disappear and Earth the new Heavens is not so without a new Earth therefore God's image in the beginning was that the kingdom would be here on Earth I say therefore let us have Grace that we can serve God we can do it correctly and to recognize my life here every day every Monday morning listen let me say it for tomorrow morning that it matters this this word is relevant and it matters why because the kingdom has got to be lived it's got to be expressed and his desire all along was to have deity in flesh and to manifest Heaven and Earth and I say let your will be done a nerfed as it is in heaven could we stand together this evening
