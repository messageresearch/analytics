[0:00] 1 Corinthians chapter 10 verse 16 says,
[0:03] "The cup of blessing which we bless, is
[0:05] it not the communion of the blood of
[0:07] Christ? The bread which we break, is it
[0:09] not the communion of the body of Christ?
[0:12] For we being many are one bread in one
[0:14] body, for we are all partakers of that
[0:17] one bread." Amen. You can be seated.
[0:22] Continuing on uh the subject of all
[0:25] things common on Sunday, we ministered
[0:27] on the subject all things common. We
[0:29] brought it through a number of different
[0:30] scriptures and we'll be visiting that um
[0:35] you know tonight just a little bit
[0:36] wanting to continue on that. Really the
[0:38] way that we address that was Christ is
[0:40] the all things common to his church
[0:42] which is his body which he is the head
[0:44] of. He is that thing that is common to
[0:47] all Christians. He is everything as we
[0:49] saw that in the scripture and wanting to
[0:52] my burden has been at least initially
[0:54] just to identify the basis for community
[0:56] in scripture and not just trying to use
[0:59] that as a buzzword or some sort of
[1:01] modern phrase but there's just something
[1:04] in the scripture that speaks about
[1:05] fellowship and unity and togetherness
[1:08] and even the service that we give one to
[1:10] another in the body of Christ and it
[1:12] just draws on those themes of uh unity
[1:15] and community and tonight I want to
[1:17] cover a number of different scriptures.
[1:18] I kind of see it as maybe just a
[1:20] scriptural survey covering a lot of
[1:22] ground in the Bible. And if I could just
[1:25] kind of throw these uh two things out to
[1:27] you at the very very beginning so you
[1:29] can kind of be listening for this. I
[1:30] want to address two different concepts
[1:32] of community or even togetherness or
[1:34] unity. And that's the the unity of the
[1:36] body of Christ. But as we look at this,
[1:39] I think there's something we can draw
[1:40] from that that's more uh personal in
[1:42] another way. And it's really just the
[1:44] the treatment of others by Christians.
[1:47] And hopefully that gets everybody's
[1:48] attention. There's a unity in the body
[1:50] of Christ that is the work of the Holy
[1:52] Ghost. Uh and it's something that we
[1:54] believe in. It's something that we yield
[1:55] ourselves to. But then there's also
[1:57] admonition in the scripture on how that
[1:59] we as being members of that body of
[2:01] Christ treat people.
[2:03] &gt;&gt; Not just people within the household of
[2:05] faith, but how we treat others. And I
[2:07] hope that you can see that theme uh
[2:08] coming through this. And as we've looked
[2:10] at Christ being uh that foundation and
[2:13] that common all things to the church and
[2:15] to Christians uh these are important
[2:17] principles to uh understand what the
[2:20] body of Christ is the Christian
[2:22] community. Uh we might call it the
[2:23] fellowship of Christ or the church. And
[2:26] this is uh the subject that I'm looking
[2:28] at I think is very common to all of us
[2:30] as human beings because we tend to form
[2:32] groups with people that we are like. Not
[2:34] just that we like but that we are like
[2:36] and when there's a shared social goal uh
[2:40] it makes it easier to connect over those
[2:42] different things. And so in light of
[2:44] that there's a lot of different kinds of
[2:45] communities that you may be a part of
[2:47] right now and ones that you support or
[2:49] ones that you uh find yourself enjoying
[2:52] and get a benefit from. And so when we
[2:55] are in we'll form these relationships
[2:58] and these identities around people that
[3:00] we uh that we uh find find that are in
[3:03] the same situation that we're in. So
[3:06] there's a way to identify with people
[3:07] who are say same economic status or even
[3:10] if it's just the same geographical
[3:12] location or some sort of as they might
[3:14] put it today a common obsession with
[3:16] something. And so because you have a
[3:18] common obsession, you're kind of lumped
[3:19] together and you're even given names and
[3:21] you become fans of something. It's just
[3:23] how we have a tendency to form groups.
[3:25] But it's in these groups uh this is kind
[3:28] of the human dynamic, the human side to
[3:30] it. We we tend to build or reinforce our
[3:33] identity. Our social identity is based
[3:36] around even these groups. And so what we
[3:38] begin to do is we begin to construct
[3:40] these concepts of who I am uh and who I
[3:43] and what I identify with out of these by
[3:46] these groups that we're a part of. And
[3:48] this is just kind of the the human side
[3:50] to things. Brother Brandham in the
[3:52] sermon leadership makes this observation
[3:54] and he's talking about the rich young
[3:56] ruler and he's he's talking about the
[3:58] breakfast that he's speaking at the full
[3:59] gospel businesses breakfast and he's
[4:01] saying that perhaps this rich young
[4:03] ruler was part of the businessman's
[4:04] breakfast or he could have been uh um
[4:06] and then referring maybe even to Zakius
[4:08] in some places about being a member of
[4:10] the full gospel businessman's group and
[4:11] he says a businessman always had
[4:14] fellowship with one another because
[4:15] they're like birds of a feather. So it's
[4:18] that phrase birds of a feather flock
[4:19] together. I'm sure you've heard that
[4:21] before. And it just implies that you
[4:23] you'll find birds of the same type uh in
[4:26] a flock together. Birds of a feather um
[4:28] uh will flock together, will be
[4:30] together. They have things to talk
[4:31] about. He says religious men, they don't
[4:33] want to talk about the man that runs the
[4:35] barroom and all them together because
[4:36] they have nothing in common.
[4:38] &gt;&gt; So think of the the principle. He's
[4:39] saying that to somebody who oper
[4:42] uh that would be a different kind of
[4:43] businessman's meeting. if you have uh
[4:46] some sort of chamber of commerce
[4:47] gathering or something where you get
[4:48] together and it's just it's strictly
[4:50] business. He's saying that a Christian
[4:52] businessmen want to be able to get
[4:54] together so they can talk about the
[4:55] gospel. He says we've got to have things
[4:58] in common. So Christians have things in
[5:01] common with Christians. Sinners have
[5:03] things in common with sinners and
[5:05] societies whatever they are they have
[5:07] things in common. So what makes a
[5:09] community and what causes people to form
[5:12] different groups or uh identify strongly
[5:15] with one another is when they have
[5:16] something in common. And when we have
[5:18] something in common, it's our human
[5:20] nature to begin to build an identity
[5:22] around that and identify myself. Oh, I'm
[5:24] part of this group. Uh if you if you
[5:27] grow up in Wisconsin and you and you
[5:29] really really love professional
[5:31] football, you might call yourself a
[5:32] cheese head.
[5:34] uh and and there's different ways that
[5:36] you begin to identify yourself and you
[5:37] operate as a group and you have certain
[5:39] passions and desires. That's just how
[5:40] that it works within human nature. And
[5:43] so for there to be fellowship and
[5:45] identity and those things, you have
[5:46] something in common. And one of the
[5:49] reasons I believe that God has dealt
[5:50] with my heart very strong on this
[5:51] subject is because community or just
[5:53] have fellowship and friendship to belong
[5:55] to something. Uh being social, we're
[5:57] social creatures. It's it's necessary.
[6:00] And so God's word uh doesn't say, "Well,
[6:02] you're going to be alone the rest of
[6:03] your life and you you got to do this on
[6:05] your own and live on your own and
[6:07] disregard the human condition to want to
[6:09] socialize and have friends and have an
[6:11] identity or have belonging." It doesn't
[6:14] disregard that. It reinforces the need
[6:16] for it by identifying the true way to
[6:18] satisfy it.
[6:19] &gt;&gt; And [snorts] so God's word outlines the
[6:21] basis for building the right kind of
[6:23] community. And so as we emphasize the
[6:26] body of Christ and even how that uh how
[6:29] the this local church works together to
[6:31] form family and community and support
[6:33] you, we're we're we're not trying to
[6:35] draw some sort of line to where it says
[6:37] the only right kind of community is your
[6:40] local church and to be a Christian.
[6:41] There may be other communities you're a
[6:43] part of and that you might get a benefit
[6:45] from and friendship groups or different
[6:47] things you do recreationally that um are
[6:50] certainly they're fine and everything is
[6:51] okay with that. But recognize the
[6:53] dynamics of community and how that there
[6:56] could be something very social or
[6:57] economic that begins to fill the need
[6:59] that you have for belonging, but it's
[7:02] taking you away from that community in
[7:04] Christ.
[7:05] &gt;&gt; That is the greatest the greatest
[7:07] belonging and identity you can have.
[7:10] &gt;&gt; In Titus chapter 1, and this is where I
[7:12] might I'm just going to be going through
[7:14] a number of different um scriptures to
[7:17] identify
[7:18] um a common faith. That's kind of how my
[7:21] notes were running over the last several
[7:23] weeks is this idea of a common faith. He
[7:25] writes, "Paul a servant of God and an
[7:27] apostle of Jesus Christ according to the
[7:29] faith of God's elect." That's a very
[7:32] specific faith.
[7:34] &gt;&gt; The faith of God's elect. That that puts
[7:36] it in a category that's um special. It's
[7:38] peculiar. Says, "And the acknowledge of
[7:40] the truth which is after godliness."
[7:42] That even identifies what kind of truth
[7:45] he's referring to. in hope of eternal
[7:48] life, which God that cannot lie promised
[7:50] before the world began, but hath in due
[7:52] times manifested his word through
[7:54] preaching, which is committed unto me
[7:55] according to the commandment of God our
[7:57] savior. There's a lot in just these
[7:59] three verses here that he has laid out
[8:01] there. The faith of God's elect, the
[8:03] acknowledging of truth, which is after
[8:04] godliness, this promise of eternal life
[8:06] that God has promised and he's
[8:08] manifested his word through preaching.
[8:10] This is part of God's way that he does
[8:12] it. He says it's been committed to him.
[8:14] So as Paul writes this to Titus, he's
[8:16] identifying a lot of things. He says to
[8:18] Titus, my own son after the common
[8:22] faith. So he's not Paul's son after the
[8:25] flesh. But he's beginning to identify
[8:26] this familial bond and this brotherhood
[8:29] and this kinship that is after a common
[8:32] faith. This just isn't like an ordinary
[8:34] faith uh um and and something that's
[8:37] just common to humanity. There are
[8:39] temptations such as are common to man.
[8:41] But what he says here is this shared
[8:43] faith, something communal. This is the
[8:46] faith of God's elect. Titus my own son
[8:48] after, if I could put it this way, the
[8:50] faith of God's elect. He says, "Grace,
[8:52] mercy, and peace from God the father and
[8:53] the Lord Jesus Christ our savior." So
[8:56] this common faith is the same faith in
[8:58] verse one, the faith of God's elect. And
[9:01] this is what unified Paul to Titus.
[9:04] &gt;&gt; This is the the greatest bond between
[9:06] them. This is the This is what unified
[9:09] the Christian church together in the
[9:10] very beginning. It wasn't their Jewish
[9:12] heritage. It wasn't their belief uh uh
[9:15] in in the law. It wasn't a lot of these
[9:17] different things that maybe they did
[9:18] share, but it was Christ that brought
[9:20] them together.
[9:22] &gt;&gt; He was the common thing.
[9:26] And so you have a common faith, the
[9:30] faith of God's elect
[9:33] in 1 Timothy 1:2
[9:36] unto Timothy, Timothy, my own son in the
[9:40] faith. Now I wonder if there was any
[9:41] kind of rivalry between Titus and
[9:43] Timothy, which one was his favorite son?
[9:46] But you notice that he's identifying
[9:47] himself as a father. He even tells the
[9:51] church to be followers of him as he's
[9:52] followers of Christ. So it say this as
[9:55] he told Timothy that he was Titus that
[9:57] he was a son after common faith. Now he
[9:59] says unto Timothy my own son in the
[10:02] faith grace, mercy and peace from God
[10:04] our father and Jesus Christ our Lord.
[10:06] Very similar salutations to Titus. But
[10:09] notice again it's a son in the faith.
[10:13] The Bible speaks about the faith.
[10:16] &gt;&gt; It's this faith that is foundational to
[10:18] a Christian experience.
[10:20] &gt;&gt; It is the faith of God's elect. common
[10:22] faith or the faith in Galatians chapter
[10:24] 2 20 in the prior verses he's talking
[10:27] about the faith of Jesus Christ he says
[10:28] I'm crucified with Christ nevertheless I
[10:30] live yet not I but Christ liveth in me
[10:33] the life which I now live in the flesh I
[10:36] wanted to just emphasize this I live by
[10:38] the faith of the son of God who loved me
[10:42] and gave himself for me he's not
[10:44] identifying it as his own faith in the
[10:47] son of god but a faith of the son of god
[10:51] is the faith that he refers to the
[10:53] common faith or the faith of God's
[10:55] elect. This is a different kind of life
[10:57] that he now lives by the faith of the
[10:59] son of God
[11:01] in acts 16:5 as we've been doing a using
[11:04] a lot of scriptures from the book of
[11:05] acts and so were the churches
[11:07] established in the faith and increased
[11:10] in number daily.
[11:12] I know that there is maybe a natural
[11:15] wondering of the mind to say well what
[11:16] is the faith and what does that comprise
[11:19] and what does that look like and could
[11:21] we distill the faith down to script uh
[11:23] different principles and this is our
[11:25] church mission statement or this is what
[11:27] we believe these are our doctrinal
[11:28] points and there's it's certainly
[11:31] possible to begin to try to outline what
[11:34] the faith is but really that's what the
[11:36] New Testament's telling us and what's
[11:37] showing us and the different ways that
[11:39] it manifested itself but we could just
[11:41] identify this one thing today that there
[11:43] was something that when they say the
[11:45] churches were being established in the
[11:47] faith that means something
[11:49] &gt;&gt; something very specific that they were
[11:51] being established in as Peter referred
[11:53] to it as the present truth not a faith
[11:56] and and not just a belief and not just a
[11:58] religion or just establishing a a
[12:01] support group but they were established
[12:02] in the faith and increased in number
[12:04] daily
[12:06] the believers admonished in 1
[12:08] Corinthians 16:13 watch ye stand fast in
[12:11] the faith quit you like men be strong.
[12:14] So this faith is a very specific
[12:17] Colossians 1 23. If you continue in the
[12:20] faith grounded and settled and be not
[12:22] moved away from the hope of the gospel
[12:24] which you have heard and which was
[12:25] preached to every creature which is
[12:26] under heaven whereof I Paul am made a
[12:29] minister as he said that he has preached
[12:31] and the word of God has been manifested
[12:33] by preaching which was committed to him.
[12:35] He's preaching this common faith the
[12:37] faith of God's elect. He's saying,
[12:38] "Stand fast in the faith.
[12:41] Continue in the faith a as it has been
[12:44] inspired in you by the preaching of the
[12:46] word of God." Faith cometh by hearing,
[12:48] hearing by the word of God. That's the
[12:50] faith of God's elect.
[12:53] &gt;&gt; Peter writes it this way in second Peter
[12:55] chapter 1 verse one. Simon Peter, a
[12:58] servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ,
[13:00] to them that have obtained like precious
[13:04] faith with us through the righteousness
[13:06] of God and our savior Jesus Christ.
[13:10] &gt;&gt; Here we can even use uh these very
[13:12] specific words that he uses obtained. So
[13:16] it's something that's been received and
[13:18] been inherited, granted, acquired like
[13:22] precious faith. So it's it's peculiar.
[13:26] It's to be treasured. This precious
[13:29] faith that you've obtained this precious
[13:31] faith with us. This is not and really
[13:35] zero in on this because this is where
[13:36] we're going to kind of stay in this area
[13:38] and I imagine that we're going to be we
[13:39] should be out of here. Here I'm setting
[13:41] myself up. I should be done by 8:30.
[13:44] That'll be up to you. So just amen me.
[13:46] Get behind me. Just really really rally
[13:48] me. We're going to do this.
[13:51] Obtained precious like faith. This faith
[13:53] is not faith to perform miracles.
[13:56] This isn't faith to be able to operate
[13:58] gifts, but this is the gift of faith by
[14:01] his grace.
[14:02] &gt;&gt; You've obtained like precious faith been
[14:05] established in the faith. So stand fast
[14:07] in the faith. My own son in the faith
[14:09] after the common faith, the faith of
[14:10] God's elect. This is that precious faith
[14:13] that Peter had, that Paul had, that the
[14:15] Colossian church was being admonished to
[14:17] stand fast in and and the Corinthian
[14:19] church to stand fast in to continue in
[14:21] these sons of Titus and Timothy were
[14:23] because of the faith, not because of
[14:26] confession of the mouth, not because of
[14:27] common experience of of healing the
[14:30] sick, but it was a faith of Jesus
[14:34] Christ. It's a gift. Ephesians chapter
[14:37] 2:8, for by grace are you saved through
[14:39] faith and that not of yourselves. The
[14:42] faith, it's not a faith of yourselves
[14:43] that saves you.
[14:45] &gt;&gt; We can't brag that, well, I believed and
[14:46] I was saved. Though, you can't be saved
[14:49] apart from belief. We realize there
[14:50] something given by God. It is the gift
[14:53] of God. The grace is a gift of God. The
[14:56] faith is a gift of God.
[15:00] You've obtained like precious faith with
[15:02] us. For by grace are you saved through
[15:04] faith. This faith again is not
[15:08] a shared experience, emotional
[15:10] experience, physical experience or a
[15:14] faith to perform miracles or walk on
[15:15] water, any of those things. It's the
[15:17] faith in Jesus Christ, the personal
[15:18] revelation of Jesus Christ to you.
[15:22] &gt;&gt; You can see this identified more clearly
[15:24] in 1 Corinthians chapter 13
[15:27] as we were reading from it before. how
[15:29] charity never fails and these list of
[15:31] things that charity cannot do and these
[15:33] list of things that charity does do. He
[15:35] was identifying how on one hand uh
[15:38] you're nothing without charity. So then
[15:40] charity becomes everything. God is love.
[15:43] &gt;&gt; There's something that becomes the all
[15:44] in all. And he says and though I have
[15:47] the gift of prophecy. So there's this
[15:50] ability to a gift being used in a
[15:52] person's life and understand all
[15:54] mysteries and have all knowledge. And
[15:56] though I have all faith,
[15:59] so that I could remove mountains and
[16:01] have not charity, I am nothing. We know
[16:05] that there's times scripture appears to
[16:06] contradict scripture. There's even
[16:08] instances in scriptures where it says it
[16:09] one way and then says it another and we
[16:11] say, "Oh my goodness, what's happening
[16:12] here? Paul says you're justified by
[16:14] faith." James says, "You're justified by
[16:16] works." And we can look at that and say,
[16:18] "Oh, they contradict." But then it's
[16:20] made it we're we understand that one is
[16:22] from God's vantage point, the other's
[16:24] from man's vantage point. There's a way
[16:26] that they dovetail. And with all the
[16:28] scriptures we have on faith, we don't
[16:29] read this and say, "Oh, well, apparently
[16:31] faith means nothing." But rather, it's
[16:33] identifying, if I could say this way,
[16:35] KIND OF A secondary faith, a faith that
[16:37] we operate more within ourselves, a
[16:39] faith that is a trust or confidence. And
[16:42] he says, "I can have all faith so that I
[16:43] could remove mountains." And that's
[16:46] that's an incredible earthmoving faith.
[16:48] He says, "And have not charity, I'm
[16:49] nothing." It's because this faith he's
[16:51] talking about here, this is this is a
[16:53] faith that could uh could use a gift
[16:55] could use. This is a faith that could
[16:57] cause mountains to be moved. But this
[16:58] the all things common is not gifts.
[17:03] &gt;&gt; It's not outward works.
[17:05] &gt;&gt; The we don't there's a lot of ways that
[17:07] you uh churches can form around shared
[17:09] experiences where it's like, well, we're
[17:11] more of a charismatic bunch and uh for
[17:14] our visitors, we're going to be bringing
[17:16] out snakes later,
[17:17] &gt;&gt; right? All right. So, we can all have we
[17:18] can have community experience. And
[17:21] that's how some people I'm I'm just
[17:22] joking for those who may not know I'm
[17:24] joking. Uh some some of the young guys
[17:26] are like, "Yes, yes."
[17:28] There's uh there's a way that people do
[17:30] things. So, we all kind of have this
[17:31] shared experience because we've done
[17:33] this together. We're in this together
[17:34] and that's how they join because it's
[17:35] through the certain style of worship, a
[17:37] certain taste or something. But the
[17:40] Bible's saying I could have a gift of
[17:41] prophecy. I could have faith through
[17:43] enough to remove mountains and I am
[17:44] nothing. And that's be this is a
[17:46] different faith than the faith of God's
[17:48] elect.
[17:49] &gt;&gt; This is a different faith than the
[17:50] common faith. The faith of the son of
[17:52] God. The faith that they were to be
[17:54] established in to standfast in and
[17:55] continue in. This is different.
[17:58] 1 Corinthians 12:es 27-31. This is the
[18:02] the verses preceding though I have all
[18:05] faith. He says now ye are the body of
[18:07] Christ in members in particular. This is
[18:10] Christ, the church, and the Christian.
[18:13] You are the Christian that's in this
[18:14] body of Christ. And God hath set some in
[18:16] the church. First apostles, secondarily
[18:19] prophets, thirdly teachers, after that
[18:21] miracles, then gifts of healing, helps,
[18:23] governments, diversities of tongues. And
[18:25] so in the body of Christ, there are many
[18:28] different gifts.
[18:30] And they've been set in the church by
[18:32] God. But then he asks this question, are
[18:34] all apostles? And the answer is no. Are
[18:37] all prophets? And the answer is no. Are
[18:39] all teachers? Are all workers of
[18:41] miracles?
[18:42] have all the gift of heal gifts of
[18:44] healing. Do all speak with tongues? Do
[18:47] all interpret? And each one of these
[18:49] instances, the rhetorical questions to
[18:50] say, "No, we all don't do that.
[18:53] &gt;&gt; We're not all expected to do that.
[18:56] &gt;&gt; But any one of us could be subject to
[18:57] the Holy Spirit to do one of these
[18:59] things in us at any given time." SO HE
[19:01] SAYS, "NO, WE DON'T ALL DO THAT, BUT
[19:03] COVET EARNESTLY all of you the best
[19:05] gifts. And yet I show unto you a more
[19:07] excellent way, and that way is charity."
[19:11] It was the greatest of these.
[19:14] &gt;&gt; How there was faith, hope, and charity.
[19:15] And the greatest of these is charity.
[19:17] That's that was the more excellent way
[19:19] because he says, "Though I speak with
[19:20] tongues and men of angels, and though I
[19:22] I give my body to be burned and and
[19:24] though I do this and though I do that,
[19:26] if I have not charity, I'm nothing."
[19:27] He's identifying the faith. Amen.
[19:31] &gt;&gt; The faith which is common to all
[19:32] believers. Not faith to have gifts of
[19:35] healing, faith to speak with tongues or
[19:37] faith to interpret, but a more excellent
[19:39] way.
[19:41] Ephesians 4:es 1:7.
[19:45] I therefore the prisoner of the Lord. I
[19:48] keep finding that in these
[19:49] introductions. Paul a servant. Peter an
[19:52] apostle and a servant. Paul a prisoner.
[19:55] Each time over and over again they were
[19:56] bound to something. I therefore the
[19:59] prison Lord beseech you that you walk
[20:00] worthy of the vocation wherewith you are
[20:03] called.
[20:04] &gt;&gt; There's a worthiness to your calling to
[20:06] be a Christian.
[20:07] &gt;&gt; If you are called to have any one of
[20:10] these gifts in a church, you ought to
[20:12] walk worthy of these vocations. And then
[20:15] where is the worthiness found with all
[20:16] loneliness and meekness, with
[20:18] longsuffering, forbearing one another in
[20:20] love?
[20:21] This would speak to not just the unity
[20:23] of the body of Christ, but how those in
[20:25] the body of a Christ treat people.
[20:27] Endeavoring to keep the unity of the
[20:29] spirit in the bond of peace, the lack of
[20:32] strife and warfare, the unity of the
[20:35] spirit. Notice, it's not the unity of
[20:36] different personalities. It's the unity
[20:39] of the spirit. There's a way that we can
[20:40] grieve the Holy Spirit. There's a way
[20:42] that we can act contrary to the nature
[20:44] of the Holy Ghost. which is a way that
[20:45] we can clearly act when we're in the
[20:47] flesh and we're not in the nature or in
[20:49] that continuity of Christ. So he says
[20:52] endeavoring to keep the unity of the
[20:53] spirit in the bond of peace. This is a
[20:55] unity that pertains to those who have
[20:57] precious like faith
[20:59] &gt;&gt; because we can't force unity and say
[21:01] well you have this temperament and you
[21:02] have this personality and you have this
[21:04] desire and you have this we're going to
[21:05] try to come up with a structure we can
[21:07] all just kind of be forced together and
[21:09] get along. It doesn't work that way.
[21:13] There's this unity of the spirit that
[21:14] only comes through the body of Christ.
[21:17] &gt;&gt; If we try to achieve unity outside of
[21:19] the body of Christ, you try to achieve
[21:21] this spirit of unity outside of the
[21:23] common faith, then that's something that
[21:25] becomes organizational, denominational,
[21:28] &gt;&gt; ecumenical. There's a way that you get
[21:30] further and further from the unity that
[21:33] the spirit desires.
[21:34] &gt;&gt; So it says there is one body and one
[21:36] spirit even as you're called into one
[21:38] hope of your calling. One Lord, one
[21:41] faith. Amen.
[21:43] &gt;&gt; There are not thousands of ways to
[21:47] Christ
[21:48] &gt;&gt; or to God. There's only one way, Jesus
[21:50] Christ. There is only one faith.
[21:53] &gt;&gt; And and I believe that we should be so
[21:55] bold to draw that line and say, "Yes,
[21:57] there is only one faith." So, are you
[21:59] saying your interpretation is the right
[22:01] one? No. By faith, you've got to believe
[22:03] that you found Christ. But we c we
[22:05] should be agree as Bible believers that
[22:07] there is one faith, [snorts]
[22:09] &gt;&gt; one baptism, one God and father of all
[22:11] who is above all and through all and in
[22:14] you all.
[22:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:15] &gt;&gt; Then he says, but unto every one of us
[22:17] is given grace according to the measure
[22:19] of the gift of Christ. What does that
[22:22] identify as? He goes into in this
[22:24] chapter how he's given some apostles and
[22:26] prophets and evangelists and teachers
[22:27] and pastors. He says these gifts have
[22:30] been given just as he says there in 1
[22:32] Corinthians 12. There's been different
[22:34] gifts that are given.
[22:36] He's saying that there's a different
[22:37] there's a grace given according to the
[22:38] measure of the gift of Christ. So people
[22:40] may be gifted to different measures. But
[22:43] that's not what makes us one.
[22:45] &gt;&gt; That's how we compare ourselves. Said,
[22:48] well, this person does this, this person
[22:49] does that. That's what destroys unity.
[22:51] But this the individuality you might
[22:53] have, the different gifts you have, the
[22:55] different callings you have, God gives
[22:57] those and grants those. But that's not
[22:58] what makes us fit together. It's the
[23:00] common faith that you have in Christ
[23:03] &gt;&gt; that brings you together.
[23:04] &gt;&gt; So the purpose of these different gifts,
[23:06] the purpose of preaching the word as you
[23:08] find in Ephesians 4:12 is to verse 13,
[23:11] till we all come in the unity of the
[23:14] faith
[23:15] &gt;&gt; and of the knowledge of the son of God
[23:16] unto a perfect man unto the measure of
[23:19] the stature of the fullness of Christ.
[23:22] &gt;&gt; There has to be uh speaking the truth in
[23:25] love.
[23:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:26] &gt;&gt; The truth
[23:27] &gt;&gt; Christ.
[23:29] If we thought about, well, are we
[23:30] achieving Christian unity? We would be
[23:32] disappointed tonight
[23:33] &gt;&gt; because there's so many different
[23:34] churches that are gathering right now
[23:36] preaching so many different uh uh
[23:38] versions of Jesus Christ. A and so many
[23:41] different identifications and people
[23:42] waring over the pulpit, names being
[23:44] called and all sorts of fights being
[23:45] fought. We say, "Oh, what a what a
[23:47] horrible state of the Christian church."
[23:49] We say, "Well, we need TO GET ALONG. WE
[23:51] NEED TO get along more with other groups
[23:53] of people and other Christians. So,
[23:55] let's try to have unity. and we'll have
[23:59] this person preach, we'll have this
[24:00] person do this, and we'll just try to
[24:02] try to get everybody together. But
[24:05] that's THAT'S THAT'S THE WRONG KIND of
[24:07] unity
[24:08] &gt;&gt; really. You have to believe in your
[24:09] heart as Paul is. He says, "I've been
[24:11] given a gift to preach Jesus Christ."
[24:13] And the word is being preached and
[24:15] that's what people unite to is the word
[24:16] of God.
[24:18] &gt;&gt; If that's not what's happening, then
[24:20] it's the wrong kind of unity. Amen.
[24:23] &gt;&gt; In this Mian church age, when brother
[24:25] Bram's preaching the revelation of Jesus
[24:27] Christ, he said God never intended the
[24:29] church to be run by men
[24:32] and nor women either. So he's just
[24:34] saying it's not to be run by humans.
[24:38] Let's update this in uh God never
[24:41] intended the church to be run by they
[24:42] them.
[24:44] &gt;&gt; God runs this church and he runs it
[24:46] through gifts of the spirit.
[24:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. The gifts of the of the spirit is
[24:50] in the church to correct the spirit.
[24:53] &gt;&gt; Not the spirit but correct spirits of
[24:55] men's hearts and people's hearts. He's
[24:56] got five ministerial offices in his
[24:58] church. First of apostles. He says
[25:00] missionary. The highest calling there is
[25:02] as apostle. Missionary means one cent.
[25:05] Apostle means one cent. So that's that's
[25:07] that dynamic there. Why they ever chose
[25:09] to be called a missionary? I don't know.
[25:11] But they're apostles. Apostles,
[25:13] prophets, teachers, evangelists,
[25:14] pastors. That's the elected offices of
[25:17] God to his church. Says in one place
[25:19] it's God's dressear in his church
[25:21] declaring his presence by what? The word
[25:23] being preached speaking the truth in
[25:25] love. And all these things go in each
[25:27] local body. And every person in the
[25:29] church has an individual ministry and
[25:31] that individual ministry goes together
[25:33] with the rest of the ministry to edify
[25:35] the body of Jesus Christ.
[25:38] So though there's different uh uh
[25:40] administrations and different ministries
[25:42] and different gifts and different
[25:44] measures of gifts and every individual
[25:47] you every individual in the church from
[25:48] youngest to oldest is in some way gifted
[25:52] to add to the body of Christ
[25:55] &gt;&gt; to edify the body of Christ
[25:58] &gt;&gt; and as the body of Christ is edified we
[26:00] are to be coming coming into what would
[26:03] be the unity of the faith
[26:06] &gt;&gt; this knowledge of the son of God, I'm
[26:08] growing. I'm increasing. This is this
[26:09] development, this internal development.
[26:13] And because of that, we may be at any
[26:16] given time at a different level in our
[26:20] understanding, in our own faith, in our
[26:22] own growing. So in 1 Thessalonians
[26:25] chapter 3:10, it says, "Night and day,
[26:27] praying exceedingly that we might see
[26:28] your face and might perfect that which
[26:31] is lacking in your faith."
[26:34] &gt;&gt; Listen, there is nothing lacking in the
[26:36] faith. There's nothing wrong with the
[26:38] common faith. There's nothing wrong with
[26:40] the faith of God's elect. There's
[26:42] nothing wrong with the faith of the son
[26:43] of God. There's nothing wrong with the
[26:44] faith. So therefore, it is our
[26:46] understanding, our revelation or our
[26:48] faith in the faith,
[26:50] &gt;&gt; our understanding of the faith, our
[26:52] obedience to the faith.
[26:54] &gt;&gt; No Christian is any more stronger or
[26:56] spiritually healthy and alive than his
[26:58] adherence, his understanding of and his
[27:01] adherence to the true word of God.
[27:03] That's right.
[27:04] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[27:05] &gt;&gt; So as we are coming into a greater
[27:07] understanding and thereby subjecting
[27:09] ourselves to that truth, we become more
[27:10] healthy.
[27:11] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[27:12] &gt;&gt; And so there is a perfecting of that
[27:15] which is missing or lacking or deficient
[27:17] in your faith.
[27:18] &gt;&gt; So that's where we can have different
[27:20] levels of faith, different levels of
[27:21] understanding. But that's not the faith
[27:23] that we're talking about.
[27:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:26] in 2 Corinthians chapter 10 verses
[27:29] 11-17.
[27:32] I I hope that I think I have all the
[27:34] slides here. I did a lot of rearranging
[27:36] um earlier today in my notes and so
[27:39] there may be some things we're missing
[27:40] here and I felt to just take some things
[27:42] out so we could be very focused on just
[27:45] this particular line of thinking.
[27:47] And a couple really lengthy scripture
[27:49] readings in 2 Corinthians and then in
[27:51] Romans, but that'll kind of be the sum
[27:53] of our service tonight. He says, "Let
[27:55] such 2 Corinthians chapter 10 11-17.
[27:59] Let such and one think this that such as
[28:02] we are in word by letters when we are
[28:05] absent, such will we be also indeed when
[28:07] we're present." Lot lot to think of
[28:10] there. I like that. For we dare not make
[28:12] ourselves of number or compare ourselves
[28:14] with some that commend themselves, but
[28:16] by they measuring themselves by
[28:18] themselves and comparing themselves
[28:19] among themselves are not wise. So,
[28:21] where's the this is the the uh
[28:23] comparison.
[28:25] &gt;&gt; It's the thief of joy.
[28:27] &gt;&gt; We compare ourselves to one another. And
[28:29] what's going to happen if we begin to
[28:30] compare ourselves to each other? And you
[28:32] say, "Well, that brother, he he is so
[28:34] much better this way and so much better
[28:36] this way. This sister's better this way,
[28:38] or I'm better than them and this and I'm
[28:40] better than them." And we begin to lose
[28:41] sight of what it is we have in common.
[28:44] &gt;&gt; And by comparing ourselves by ourselves
[28:46] and measuring ourselves by one another,
[28:47] he says that's says it's not wise. In
[28:48] other words, it's foolish.
[28:50] So, we're not trying to compare
[28:52] ourselves and measure ourselves. Let's
[28:54] not do that in any way.
[28:56] &gt;&gt; As the Lord has been dealing with my
[28:58] heart in terms of community, I believe
[28:59] that at some point we'll be able to deal
[29:00] with competition.
[29:03] &gt;&gt; I remember when my father-in-law came
[29:05] and preached a sermon uh at at my the
[29:08] church I grew up in and he preached on
[29:09] competition. I'm like, why would he need
[29:12] to preach that here?
[29:14] And he did it innocently, but it was
[29:17] definitely relevant.
[29:20] We just kind of Mcgirious we have a
[29:22] competitive streak in us.
[29:25] Oh, you want to do you disagree with me?
[29:28] I'll prove to you that we got a
[29:29] competitive streak.
[29:33] &gt;&gt; But he says, [laughter]
[29:41] &gt;&gt; I expect a a full retraction in the
[29:43] morning.
[29:45] He says, "But we will NOT BOAST THINGS
[29:47] WITHOUT our measure, but according to
[29:49] the measure of the rule which God hath
[29:51] distributed to us, a measure to reach
[29:53] even unto you." So he said that he's
[29:55] been granted a measure and that he has a
[29:57] measure that he said a portion of the
[29:59] gospel has been granted to me. So he
[30:01] says that I have been given this uh this
[30:03] the word has been manifested through the
[30:05] preaching which has been committed unto
[30:07] me. Says for we stretch not ourselves
[30:09] beyond our measure as though we reach
[30:11] not unto you. For we are are come as far
[30:14] as to you also in preaching the gospel
[30:17] of Christ. I I don't want just to get
[30:18] lost in some of these words he's using
[30:20] here. But I hope you can see these
[30:21] saying I've been given a measure.
[30:23] &gt;&gt; There's different measures given to
[30:25] different individuals. We have different
[30:26] spirits, different when I say different
[30:28] spirits, different offices, different
[30:29] gifts. And the Bible says all by one
[30:31] spirit.
[30:33] &gt;&gt; So we'll find later that there's uh we
[30:35] have different measures and different
[30:36] administrations but it's still the same
[30:38] spirit.
[30:39] &gt;&gt; So we're wanting to identify that there
[30:40] is a common faith. There's a common
[30:42] spirit. Those are the bonds. Those are
[30:45] the things that we have to come back to.
[30:46] It's the word of God. It's the spirit of
[30:48] God. It's the faith in the word of God.
[30:50] These are the things that we we find our
[30:52] strength in. These are things that we
[30:53] find in common. Now, if somebody comes
[30:54] along and says, well, the word of God's
[30:56] not true. Then we realize, well, that
[30:58] how how do I deal with that?
[31:01] &gt;&gt; How can I join TO SOMEBODY SAYS THE
[31:02] BIBLE'S NOT TRUE? YOU SAY, WELL, I
[31:04] BELIEVE the Bible's true. THEN YOU
[31:05] REALIZE THAT'S A FUNDAMENTAL difference
[31:08] &gt;&gt; that makes you recognize THAT THERE'S
[31:10] GOING YOU MAY HAVE SOMETHING IN COMMON
[31:11] WITH THAT PERSON. They may be family.
[31:13] They may be somebody you love. You may
[31:14] be able TO FIND UM SOME MEASURE OF
[31:16] participation or relationship with them.
[31:18] BUT THEN YOU REALIZE THERE'S SOME
[31:20] DIFFERENCE
[31:21] &gt;&gt; THAT OPPOSES THE COMMON FAITH.
[31:26] &gt;&gt; So he says these different measures, he
[31:28] doesn't stretch himself beyond that
[31:29] measure. Verse 15, not boasting of
[31:31] things without our measure, that is of
[31:33] other men's labors, but having a hope
[31:36] when your faith is increased.
[31:39] &gt;&gt; So there is an an increasing of one's
[31:41] individual faith.
[31:43] &gt;&gt; There are measures that we can grow in
[31:44] in our understanding.
[31:47] &gt;&gt; It's why it's so important for us to
[31:48] maintain a humility with our experience
[31:52] to recognize that God will God manifest
[31:54] truth to whosoever he will. Yes.
[31:57] &gt;&gt; And that what God has showed you, carry
[31:59] it with humility because it's by the
[32:00] grace of God that you've seen that
[32:03] &gt;&gt; God reveals something to you. If God
[32:05] reveals himself to you, if you're sick
[32:07] and maybe you have cancer and God
[32:09] reveals himself to you as a a healer,
[32:11] you become healed.
[32:12] &gt;&gt; And that's the grace of God. So if you
[32:14] see somebody who has cancer and NOT
[32:16] BEING HEALED, DON'T JUDGE them
[32:18] &gt;&gt; because what you've been healed of can
[32:19] come right back on you.
[32:21] &gt;&gt; But you want TO PRAY THAT GOD WOULD
[32:23] GRANT TO THEM THE SAME REVELATION. AMEN.
[32:26] &gt;&gt; RIGHT.
[32:26] &gt;&gt; So there is a when your faith is
[32:28] increased, this kind of speaks to the
[32:31] heart of the attitude we ought to have
[32:32] towards those who are who don't have the
[32:34] same as you do. The Bible says, "Walk in
[32:36] wisdom to those who don't have wisdom."
[32:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:40] &gt;&gt; Because the days are evil. We have to
[32:42] CARRY THIS LIGHT MUCH more circumspectly
[32:44] than we ever have before. So that we
[32:47] lose the arrogance, we lose the
[32:48] hottiness, WE DON'T LOOK DOWN ON PEOPLE.
[32:50] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[32:51] &gt;&gt; BUT FOR THE GRACE OF GOD, THERE GOETH I.
[32:54] AMEN.
[32:55] &gt;&gt; That when their faith is increased,
[32:58] it's a lesson that I I I had to learn
[33:00] personally
[33:02] that in my attitude towards people who
[33:04] don't see this see the word the same way
[33:07] I would. Well, it's really easy to say,
[33:08] "Well, how could they be my brother?
[33:11] &gt;&gt; How could they be my sister? Why how
[33:14] could they be Christians if they they
[33:15] disagree so fundamentally on on the
[33:17] things of God?" And I realized, well, we
[33:19] could just split hairs then on if that
[33:22] moment has been memorialized and nothing
[33:23] ever changes, then we can say, okay,
[33:25] well, yeah, if they're denying this or
[33:26] they're denying that, how could they
[33:27] have the Holy Ghost? But the attitude
[33:29] isn't isn't based in faith as much as it
[33:32] is, I would say, fear
[33:34] &gt;&gt; that you could be wrong. Fear that of
[33:38] maybe not being so certain where you
[33:39] stand. But the more confident you get in
[33:41] your revelation, the easier it'll be to
[33:43] believe that somebody else can have the
[33:45] same one. Amen.
[33:48] &gt;&gt; The more THE MORE HUMBLY YOU'LL CARRY
[33:50] THE TRUTH IN BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT AFRAID
[33:52] IF SOMEBODY DISAGREES WITH you
[33:54] &gt;&gt; because you know what God has revealed
[33:56] to you. You know that you hold this
[33:57] truth deep within your heart and that
[33:59] the devil can't take that away.
[34:02] &gt;&gt; And so when it comes to calling someone
[34:03] brother or sister, you don't need to
[34:05] withhold that
[34:06] &gt;&gt; to protect your truth. That's right.
[34:08] &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T NEED TO WITHHOLD THAT TO TO BE
[34:10] SURE THAT you're you're right and that
[34:12] you make this stand that that you know
[34:14] they're wrong.
[34:16] &gt;&gt; But call them in brother or sister not
[34:18] because you agree but because you
[34:21] believe the same God that showed you
[34:22] truth can show them as well. Amen.
[34:25] &gt;&gt; I know that I'm sharing maybe my
[34:27] personal testimony with this, but I
[34:29] remember for me what it crystallized in
[34:31] scripture is when those 12 spies went
[34:33] over to seek out the promised land that
[34:36] they went over and when the 12 CAME
[34:38] BACK, TWO of them said, "We are more
[34:41] than able to take it."
[34:44] &gt;&gt; And they weren't just speaking about the
[34:45] two of them,
[34:46] &gt;&gt; right?
[34:46] &gt;&gt; It wasn't Caleb and I believe that we
[34:48] can take it. And K goes, "Yes, Joshua
[34:50] and I believe that we, the two of us,
[34:52] dos armonos, WE COULD TAKE IT."
[34:55] &gt;&gt; And it wasn't them that were speaking
[34:57] exclusively OF THEMSELVES. THEY LOOKED
[34:59] OUT UPON ALL ISRAEL AND SAID, "WE ARE
[35:01] more than able."
[35:03] &gt;&gt; But then THE 10 SPIES GOT UP THERE AND
[35:05] SAID, "NO, WE ARE NOT."
[35:08] &gt;&gt; And their sin was NOT TO SAY THAT THEY
[35:10] couldn't because clearly they didn't.
[35:13] &gt;&gt; But it WAS THE SIN WAS BY THEIR
[35:14] CONFESSION TO SAY THAT THEY COULDN'T,
[35:17] &gt;&gt; THAT YOU COULDN'T. THAT JOSHUA COULDN'T,
[35:19] THAT CALEB COULDN'T. And so there's A
[35:22] DANGER IN HOW THAT WE TRY TO DRAW LINES
[35:23] AND DIVIDE things and say AND TRY TO
[35:26] BUILD THIS EXCLUSIVITY. OH, THERE IS AN
[35:28] EXCLUSIVE BODY OF CHRIST AND WE'RE NOT
[35:30] THE ONES THAT DETERMINE who's in and
[35:31] who's out. Amen.
[35:33] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[35:34] &gt;&gt; And when we stand upon revelation, we
[35:36] should be better able to say, "Brother,
[35:38] sister," and to treat others with
[35:40] kindness
[35:41] &gt;&gt; and with the love of JESUS CHRIST, NOT
[35:43] NOT TRYING TO BUILD SOME SORT OF FALSE
[35:45] UNITY, but believe in God, open their
[35:47] eyes to this great grace.
[35:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:49] &gt;&gt; That they could know you in a personal
[35:51] way. when your faith is increased that
[35:53] we shall be enlarged by you according to
[35:54] our rule abundantly to preach the gospel
[35:56] in regions beyond you and not to boast
[35:59] in another man's line of things made
[36:01] ready to our hand but he that glorifith
[36:03] let him glory in the Lord
[36:07] &gt;&gt; there's an increasing of faith doesn't
[36:09] change thee faith it's just one's faith
[36:14] in Romans chapter 12
[36:17] verses 3- 1
[36:21] For I say through the grace given unto
[36:23] me to every man that is among you not to
[36:27] think of himself more highly than he
[36:29] ought to think.
[36:32] This is really really good good things
[36:34] to consider.
[36:37] I I I maybe I I have to admit I'm
[36:39] preaching some from my heart tonight
[36:41] just by inspiration because I I've been
[36:43] asked to speak at a minister's meeting
[36:44] that the subject is how do we have unity
[36:48] and and in my mind I'm thinking well I
[36:50] mean we could have a lot of rules right
[36:54] and we could have uh we could have
[36:55] different ways that we can create unity
[36:57] but the true unity comes by the word of
[36:59] God
[37:01] &gt;&gt; and so how is it that we could have
[37:03] unity each one of us personally hold
[37:05] ourselves accountable to the word of God
[37:07] to not think of ourselves more than we
[37:08] ought to think
[37:10] &gt;&gt; with loneliness of mind. Let each esteem
[37:11] other better than themselves. It's just
[37:13] a way that you begin to conduct yourself
[37:14] in a manner which somebody's would say
[37:16] to themselves, I like being around that
[37:19] person.
[37:20] &gt;&gt; I I I like there's something about him.
[37:23] There's something about th THOSE PEOPLE.
[37:24] THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT THIS THAT'S REAL
[37:26] AND GENEROUS. SAYS, WELL, you know, they
[37:28] don't believe like us, don't you? Like,
[37:31] oh, well, I know what we believe kind of
[37:34] produces this.
[37:36] So maybe this isn't what I want.
[37:39] There's a way that you begin to conduct
[37:40] yourselves when you know there's some
[37:42] people you know there's some people you
[37:43] like to be around. There's others that
[37:45] you don't like to be around. That's just
[37:47] human nature. So the Bible's teaching
[37:49] you how to be somebody that others can
[37:51] like to be around. Get be salty so that
[37:54] they would hunger and thirst after what
[37:55] you have.
[37:56] &gt;&gt; But to think soberly according to the
[37:58] grace to God hath dealt to every man the
[38:00] measure of faith. So every man has been
[38:02] given a measure of faith. For as we have
[38:04] many members in one body, and all
[38:06] members have not the same office, so we
[38:08] being many are one body in Christ.
[38:12] &gt;&gt; This is true of the real
[38:15] supernatural body of Jesus Christ. We're
[38:17] not talking about the local church.
[38:18] We're talking about the body of Jesus
[38:20] Christ. All members have not the same
[38:22] office. They all have different measures
[38:23] of faith, but they're still one body,
[38:25] and everyone members one of another.
[38:27] Having then gifts differing according to
[38:30] the grace that is given to us, whether
[38:32] prophecy, let us prophesy according to
[38:35] the proportion of faith. Do you see how
[38:38] instructive this is?
[38:40] &gt;&gt; Let us fill up the measure that we've
[38:42] been granted. Paul said, I don't go
[38:44] reach out beyond my measure. I fill up
[38:46] my measure. 2 Corinthians 10. I I go to
[38:48] the extents of my calling. I fulfill my
[38:50] office. I perform my duty. You ought to
[38:53] be doing the same. And that it's in the
[38:54] meeting of the duty that we meet.
[38:57] We shouldn't overstep yours. You don't
[38:58] overstep mine. There's this way that we
[39:00] meet. We're each doing our part,
[39:02] &gt;&gt; having different gifts according to the
[39:03] measure of grace that is given us. If
[39:05] you have a gift of prophesy, do it
[39:07] according to the proportion of faith or
[39:08] ministry, let us wait on our
[39:09] ministering. Or he that teacheth on
[39:11] teaching. Or he that exhortth on
[39:13] exhortation. He that giveth, let him do
[39:15] it with simplicity. He that ruleth with
[39:17] diligence. He that showeth mercy with
[39:19] cheerfulness. Let love be without
[39:21] dissimulation. That's for all of us. Let
[39:23] it be without hypocrisy. The poor that
[39:25] which is evil, cleave to that which is
[39:27] good. Here's this uh uh he's speaking
[39:31] about the one body. This is the unity of
[39:32] the body of Christ. This is the
[39:34] community, the fellowship of the body of
[39:35] Christ. But now here's the treatment of
[39:37] others by these members of the body of
[39:38] Christ. Be kindly affectionate one to
[39:40] another with brotherly love, in honor,
[39:42] preferring one another, not slothful in
[39:45] business, fervent in spirit, serving the
[39:47] Lord, rejoicing in hope, patient in
[39:49] tribulation, continuing instant in
[39:51] prayer, distributing to the necessity of
[39:53] saints, given to hospitality. Bless them
[39:56] which persecute you. Bless you. Bless
[39:58] you.
[40:00] BLESS AND CURSE NOT. REJOICE WITH THEM
[40:03] that do rejoice, and weep with them that
[40:05] weep. Be of the same mind one toward
[40:07] another. Mind not high things, but
[40:10] condescend to men of low estate. Be not
[40:12] wise in your own conceit conceits.
[40:15] Recompense
[40:17] to no man evil for evil.
[40:19] &gt;&gt; Provide things honest in the sight of
[40:21] all men.
[40:22] &gt;&gt; These are the aspirations of a
[40:24] Christian.
[40:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:25] &gt;&gt; This is, as I put on the slide, this is
[40:27] conduct becoming of a Christian.
[40:29] &gt;&gt; Right?
[40:29] &gt;&gt; These are things that you ought to judge
[40:31] yourself by. We let's not create a
[40:34] Romans 12 template and then ask chat GPT
[40:38] to tell us whether or not our friend
[40:39] meets this qualification or whether or
[40:42] not the neighbor in the apartment next
[40:43] door fits these parameters, but rather
[40:45] we should examine ourselves by this
[40:48] &gt;&gt; to see whether or not we are in the
[40:49] faith, whether or not we're walking in
[40:50] the spirit. Does our own is our own
[40:52] nature conforming to this great
[40:54] expectation of scripture?
[40:56] &gt;&gt; If it if it be possible, I'm so glad he
[40:59] said that. As much as lith in you, live
[41:02] peaceibly with all men.
[41:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:04] &gt;&gt; Paul acknowledging that there's times
[41:06] when it's not possible, but as much as
[41:08] you are able, live peaceibly with all
[41:09] men.
[41:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:11] &gt;&gt; So, we're not keep endeavoring to keep
[41:13] the unity of the spe uh the unity of the
[41:14] spirit in the bond of peace. I'm not
[41:16] waring. I'm not striving.
[41:19] Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves,
[41:21] but rather give place un rather give
[41:23] place under wrath. In other words, let
[41:25] God be the judge. For it is written,
[41:27] vengeance is mine. I will repay, sayeth
[41:29] the Lord. If you avenge yourself,
[41:32] &gt;&gt; if you try to get restitution yourself,
[41:34] then you take it out of God's hands.
[41:36] &gt;&gt; So he he he's speaking to human nature.
[41:39] &gt;&gt; I want to get payback. I want to get
[41:41] even. Well, if you get your own
[41:43] vengeance, then vengeance isn't the
[41:45] Lord's.
[41:46] &gt;&gt; So he says, "Give place to wrath." That
[41:47] doesn't mean your own wrath. It says,
[41:48] "Let God be the judge. Therefore, if
[41:51] thine enemy hunger, feed him.
[41:54] If he thirst, give him drink. For in
[41:57] doing so, thou shalt heap coals of fire
[41:59] on his head.
[42:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:01] &gt;&gt; Be not overcome of evil, but overcome
[42:03] evil with good.
[42:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:07] &gt;&gt; I believe this to be the truth.
[42:10] &gt;&gt; I believe this to be the word of God.
[42:12] &gt;&gt; I believe it'd be very wrong for us to
[42:13] quibble with and say, "Well, this is
[42:15] just Paul. You know, Romans, you know
[42:18] how they can be." This is only
[42:19] appropriate in that time. And that I
[42:21] believe these are timeless truths.
[42:24] I think it speaks to the heart of the
[42:25] things that sometimes go missing in that
[42:27] simple Christian life that we're called
[42:29] to live.
[42:30] &gt;&gt; That rugged life out there amongst the
[42:32] people being a light. If your enemy is
[42:34] hungry, feed him. If he thirsts, give
[42:36] him a drink. And try not to say, you
[42:40] know, here's your hot coals.
[42:42] Because there's times when we act, we're
[42:44] doing it. We're doing it because we want
[42:46] to heap coals of fire on his head. Well,
[42:48] I don't know that you kind you may be
[42:50] missing the point there.
[42:53] Be not overcome of evil, but overcome
[42:55] evil with good anymore. The this great
[42:58] temptation is for us to be agitated and
[43:01] triggered and to respond to evil.
[43:05] &gt;&gt; And when we do it in our flesh, we're
[43:06] just returning evil for evil.
[43:09] &gt;&gt; But we can only overcome evil with good.
[43:13] &gt;&gt; This is all speaking to the one body of
[43:15] Christ. And in that one body of Christ,
[43:16] there's different measures of faith.
[43:19] There's different gifts. There's
[43:20] different ministries. There's different
[43:21] callings, different ways that people are
[43:23] filling up that measure. Faith can be
[43:25] increased. There can be something
[43:27] lacking in our faith.
[43:30] Been uh studying for a youth service on
[43:32] help Lord, I I believe. Help thou my
[43:35] unbelief.
[43:36] &gt;&gt; This honesty about how sometimes there's
[43:38] my my faith isn't all there. It's not
[43:40] where it needs to be. I have I have
[43:42] doubts. I I have questions. So there
[43:46] there there are those things that exist.
[43:48] But those things exist even as Paul is
[43:50] putting it here. It's being placed in
[43:52] scripture within the context of those
[43:53] who are part of the body of Christ. So
[43:56] what IS IT THEY HAVE IN COMMON? Not that
[43:58] everyone every day is all the same
[44:01] and we're all just on cloud9, whatever
[44:04] that means.
[44:06] And we're all happy all the time and we
[44:08] all drive the same car. We're all
[44:09] getting the same gas mileage. Even if we
[44:11] drive an electric vehicle, same gas
[44:12] mileage. We're all wearing the same
[44:14] things. We're all listening to the same
[44:15] music. Right? I'm going to be sharing my
[44:18] playlist later this week. I don't want
[44:19] you all to listen to anything other than
[44:20] what I listen to.
[44:25] You hear me? I want to be sure I keep
[44:27] this hand low enough to where I don't
[44:28] get in trouble.
[44:31] There's a way that we could try to say
[44:33] this is what but no, it's a faith on the
[44:35] inside.
[44:37] &gt;&gt; It's an affinity. It's a dynamic that
[44:39] transcends how much we could try to look
[44:41] alike and talk alike and feel like.
[44:42] THAT'S HOW THE world builds community to
[44:44] where they get SO CLOSE AND THEY RALLY
[44:46] around this common ASSESSION WHERE THEY
[44:48] BEGIN TO HAVE A LANGUAGE THAT NOBODY
[44:49] ELSE CAN understand
[44:51] &gt;&gt; and that's how they get cultish.
[44:54] &gt;&gt; They get different and they make
[44:56] themselves weird.
[44:58] &gt;&gt; AND WE'RE CAUTIONED NOT TO DO THAT.
[45:01] &gt;&gt; YES, THERE'S A way that we CAN BEGIN TO
[45:03] TALK AS BELIEVERS THAT WE CAN SAY IT
[45:05] TAKES THE token to understand that that
[45:07] it takes the MIND OF CHRIST TO REALLY
[45:08] UNDERSTAND. BUT IS THAT WHAT WE SHOULD
[45:10] BECOME is is clingons where we say we
[45:13] have a special language and and hand
[45:15] signals
[45:16] like he must be yeah WHATEVER ELSE
[45:19] YOU'RE SAYING YEAH YOU GET IT and
[45:21] everybody's just kind of nodding only
[45:22] and other people
[45:24] what is this
[45:26] we become barbarians one to another
[45:31] &gt;&gt; it's a common faith
[45:36] it's a faith of God's
[45:39] So all things common as we we're
[45:42] identifying that on Sunday we don't
[45:44] start with the outside
[45:48] &gt;&gt; promoting certain things. Well this is
[45:49] the way it should look and this is the
[45:50] way it should sound and this is the way
[45:51] it should be but you start with the in
[45:53] the heart of a person.
[45:55] &gt;&gt; Let God start working on that. Let him
[45:57] do a deep work. Where many of us miss it
[45:59] is we're no longer letting the word deal
[46:01] with our hearts. We're just letting it
[46:03] deal in the outward things.
[46:05] &gt;&gt; We get a lot out front. We can defend
[46:07] ourselves.
[46:08] &gt;&gt; We get really really good h with our
[46:11] spiritual judo. Not going to let anyone
[46:13] get to us because it's all out here.
[46:18] Our closing scriptures are this one that
[46:20] we opened with in 1 Corinthians chapter
[46:22] 10
[46:24] verses 16 to1 17. I'd like to read some
[46:26] of the verses prior to this on Sunday
[46:28] morning, Lord willing.
[46:30] But he's asking this question. And he
[46:32] says, "The cup of blessing which we
[46:34] bless, is it not the communion of the
[46:35] blood of Christ?
[46:37] The bread which we break, is it not the
[46:39] communion of the body of Christ?" The
[46:41] word communion, there's community,
[46:43] fellowship, association, this joint
[46:45] participation, the sharing of what one
[46:47] has. So if you have something, and think
[46:51] of it this way, the sharing in the
[46:53] community, it's not that, well, I've got
[46:55] faith and I have this faith, so I'm
[46:57] going to share it with brother Aio and
[46:58] here you can have some of my faith. But
[47:00] we share the same faith.
[47:04] &gt;&gt; That's the fellowship of the blood of
[47:06] Christ.
[47:07] &gt;&gt; The community of the body of Christ is
[47:10] this joint participation. You
[47:12] participate in the blood of Jesus
[47:13] Christ. Your sins are forgiven you. You
[47:14] have faith in Jesus Christ. That's the
[47:16] that's the sharing of what we have. IT'S
[47:18] NOT ONE PERSON HAS all the faith and now
[47:20] I'm just going to chop it all up and
[47:21] share it with all of you. Churches that
[47:23] are like that. They're the worst kinds.
[47:26] Everyone just comes to hear what the
[47:27] pastor has to say and he's going to tell
[47:28] them what to think and what to do and
[47:30] then you're all just I'm just going to
[47:31] give you my revelation. You just accept
[47:33] it for the way that I teach it. And
[47:34] that's not sharing.
[47:37] &gt;&gt; That's not fellowship.
[47:41] &gt;&gt; That that's the that's the kind of
[47:42] dynamics that make people sick to their
[47:44] stomachs when they think about going to
[47:45] church.
[47:48] But he says, "For we being many are one
[47:51] bread
[47:54] and [clears throat] one body, for we are
[47:56] all partakers of that one bread."
[47:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:59] &gt;&gt; I just maybe a little bit self-aware in
[48:01] this moment that maybe there is a lot of
[48:04] uh try not to make we don't want things
[48:06] to be about church. You might say,
[48:06] "Well, for someone who's not trying to
[48:08] make it about church, you sure talk
[48:09] about church a lot." But you know what?
[48:10] There's a lot of undoing.
[48:12] There's a lot of washing that has to be
[48:14] done for us to not think the way that
[48:16] we've been taught to think for so long.
[48:20] &gt;&gt; And I believe that God's wanting us to
[48:21] grow, wanting us to mature, take a take
[48:24] a a step into our positions.
[48:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:26] &gt;&gt; And we have to recognize that the local
[48:29] church and this church dynamic is to
[48:33] thrust you to propel you to push you
[48:35] into that position,
[48:37] &gt;&gt; not become the fulfillment of it. Right.
[48:40] &gt;&gt; So, for we being many are one bread and
[48:42] one body, for we're all partakers of
[48:43] that one bread. What does the Bible say?
[48:45] What is Paul saying? By eating the same
[48:47] word,
[48:49] &gt;&gt; by feeding on the same substance,
[48:52] &gt;&gt; we coalesce, we harmonize into one body.
[48:57] &gt;&gt; How? It's not by the physical drinking
[48:59] of wine, not by the physical communion,
[49:03] but this is a communion not of bread,
[49:05] but of Christ the word. By having the
[49:08] same life, partaking of the same life,
[49:10] feeding on the same substance, what
[49:12] happens? We become one.
[49:15] &gt;&gt; There's there's an external uh there's a
[49:17] way that we could just speak things.
[49:19] speaking facts in frustration,
[49:22] we can all just kind of tow the line,
[49:25] which I found out this week is a
[49:27] nautical term to tow the line. And that
[49:30] we could just all we're just going to
[49:32] all tow the line. We're all going to
[49:33] look the same. And by speaking facts in
[49:35] frustration, we can become one
[49:36] outwardly, but it's speaking the truth
[49:38] in love. By feeding on the word, by the
[49:41] word of God being preached, by us, all
[49:42] feed on the same revealed word of God,
[49:46] the unfailing body word of the son of
[49:47] man. By feeding on that, we're all going
[49:49] to become one bread.
[49:52] &gt;&gt; How is it accomplished? HOW ARE WE EVER
[49:53] GOING TO BE COME INTO THE UNION OF
[49:55] FAITH? ONLY BY FEEDING ON THE FAITH.
[49:58] &gt;&gt; ONLY BY THE WORD OF GOD.
[50:02] &gt;&gt; That's how we become
[50:04] one body. That's how we become unified
[50:06] by eating one bread.
[50:09] &gt;&gt; So what what if we're not eating the
[50:11] same bread? Be kindly affectionate one
[50:13] another with brotherly love.
[50:16] If it be possible, live peaceibly with
[50:19] all men, provide things honestly. This
[50:21] the word begins to speak to us. The
[50:24] common the common ground in the word of
[50:26] God is what's going to build unity of
[50:27] the Jesus uh unity of Christ.
[50:30] &gt;&gt; You doing what the word says is what's
[50:32] going to keep you from being at enmity
[50:33] with everybody you meet.
[50:36] musicians, if you would come.
[50:39] There's a lot of different statements
[50:41] that I've been reading over and just
[50:42] really been blessed by, but this one
[50:44] from a thinking man's filter really
[50:45] stands out.
[50:47] Says, "As the days grow closer and
[50:49] closer in the narrowing of the path, we
[50:51] want to get go closer together." I think
[50:54] this speaks to us even as a church, we
[50:57] must just be one, one body. We must move
[51:00] together.
[51:01] You say, "Uhoh, where are we moving?
[51:05] It it it's two walking together. It's
[51:07] this we're in harmony in concert with
[51:10] one another. How's it going to happen?
[51:12] By walking in the spirit.
[51:14] &gt;&gt; By not fulfilling the deeds of the
[51:16] flesh. Just being one. Move together.
[51:17] Says forgetting one another's sins and
[51:19] our differences. Just sticking closer
[51:22] and closer as we see the day
[51:23] approaching. Assembling ourselves
[51:26] together all with one accord AND ONE
[51:27] HEART. THESE ARE SCRIPTURAL PRINCIPLES.
[51:30] And if a brother or sister gets out of
[51:31] the way in any way, don't do anything
[51:34] but pray for that person in love. Always
[51:37] considering one another.
[51:39] &gt;&gt; Ye who are spiritual restore such a one
[51:42] that in that spirit of humility
[51:44] considering your own self.
[51:49] Don't ever let any one of you get away.
[51:51] Stay together. And if you can add more
[51:53] to it constantly all the time. I love
[51:55] that. [music] Stay together. And if you
[51:58] can't add more all the time,
[52:01] we have this need to be [music] one.
[52:05] For some
[52:07] in in a church, church becomes the only
[52:09] place that they have friends, the only
[52:12] place that they have fellowship.
[52:14] They look forward to it and it provides.
[52:16] It's in the church that there the there
[52:19] is a a father to the fatherless,
[52:22] a husband to the widow. There's a
[52:24] there's the the needs that are are met
[52:27] through the fellowship of a body of
[52:29] Christ through believers. So, we need
[52:31] it. We can't just stay at home and read
[52:32] the Bible. Can't just stay home and
[52:35] stream.
[52:36] You miss out on so much that God desires
[52:38] to get grant you by being partakers of
[52:41] that one bread.
[52:43] So, he speaks to this attitude that we
[52:45] have.
[52:47] Pray for one another.
[52:49] Forget our sins and our differences.
[52:51] Stick closer together.
[52:53] when someone gets out of the way, pray
[52:55] for them in love. Consider one another.
[52:57] Don't don't don't let just let you one
[52:59] get away
[53:02] and then look our our doors are open to
[53:04] see more saved, more come to the light
[53:07] of God's word for our lives to have an
[53:09] impact. [music]
[53:11] That's what we want God to do. We want
[53:12] him to have preeminence.
[53:14] And I believe [music] that there's a
[53:17] there's a calling that he is bidding us
[53:19] to. And I believe that we [music] should
[53:22] embrace it.
[53:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:23] &gt;&gt; As a church, I believe that you should
[53:24] embrace it. If we could stand on our
[53:26] [music] feet,
[53:29] pray together.
[53:34] Our gracious heavenly father, tonight
[53:36] [snorts] as we close, we thank you for
[53:39] your presence that's been with us
[53:40] tonight.
[53:43] Lord, I know that in reading a lot of
[53:45] scriptures, it's easy for there to be
[53:48] may fragments or one thought here and
[53:51] another thought there. But Lord, truly,
[53:54] you could take all these scriptures and
[53:56] begin to weave together these touch
[53:58] points in a way that it makes a a
[54:01] profound thought in the believer's
[54:02] heart. And I trust that as you do it
[54:06] that there wouldn't be this instinct to
[54:09] compliment the preacher. There wouldn't
[54:11] be this instinct to say, "Wow, what a
[54:13] sermon." But would they recognize, Lord,
[54:15] your love for them. And how you could
[54:18] take a sermon with a number of different
[54:19] scriptures and just weave together
[54:22] what we individually had need of
[54:24] tonight.
[54:26] There's so much in here, Lord, that we
[54:27] can challenge ourselves with
[54:32] that there is a unity, a true unity, and
[54:34] it's not going to come by politics.
[54:37] It's not going to come by external
[54:39] power. It's going to come by the Holy
[54:41] Spirit working within your body
[54:48] and you'll use gifts,
[54:50] use the gospel, the preaching of the
[54:52] word and it's working this out in
[54:53] individual's lives.
[54:56] And then Lord, how is it that we can
[54:57] then have unity as a church or unity
[55:00] with other Christians and other
[55:01] believers? Well, let's conduct ourselves
[55:06] in a life that's worthy of the gospel
[55:09] in a way that's becoming of a Christian.
[55:12] And I know that's a lot, Lord, to ask.
[55:15] You expect a lot of us, Lord. But you
[55:16] would never ask us to do something that
[55:18] you're not willing to give us the power
[55:20] to do. So, Lord, may we be willing to
[55:22] receive it and walk in it and bless your
[55:25] church tonight, I pray, and everyone
[55:26] assembled. In the name of the Lord Jesus
[55:28] Christ, we ask these things. Amen.
[55:32] He met.
