TRANSCRIPT
========================================
so my title tonight is very straightforward game over and that might be attention grabbing for some one brother saw it and told me that this is probably a little bit of a shot to all the kids who've had their devices taken away from them over the last few weeks but I did not mean that at all it kind of slipped right by me but if it kind of rubs it in a little bit maybe you just needed that and maybe it's uh not kids eat free today but kids eat a spoonful of gravel but the the title is game over I don't know if you could tell it by the subtitle underneath this or just the tagline we included in this is it is ending the blame game and originally my title was the blame game but I just rather put in this context game over putting the end to the blame game and in looking at that I could say this maybe as a thesis statement it's about taking responsibility taking responsibility for our actions and just how much power is in taking responsibility and there's a lot of things in our lives that are beyond our control there's a lot of things that happen to us and we're very quick to recognize I had nothing to do with this but when we can take responsibility for ourselves and we can take responsibility for our families and our own decisions and our own conditions and even our own mistakes it's very empowering it might not seem so and I think it works against our human nature but I want to look at taking responsibility because there's a power in doing that that breaks us out of a lot of mindsets that debilitate us and weaken us and kind of self-defeating is the phrase I believe I want to use is there's a self-defeating mentality that we feel that we're doing ourselves a favor by blaming but we're actually making it worse and bringing ourselves into a very negative cycle so tonight game over the end to the blame game now just pick up right where we were in verse nine as we've already seen that man was tempted the woman was tempted participation continues to demand Adam and the woman have fallen they've come up with their ways of addressing their fallen nature and now comes the moment when they're going to answer to God and he says in the Lord God called into Adam and said unto him where art thou and he said I heard the voice in the garden and I was afraid because I was naked and I hid myself and he said who told you I guess we could have read verse eight but we just skipped over that part where they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden and they were uh and they hid themselves amongst the trees if I we read that good he says I heard thy voice in the garden and I was afraid because I was naked and I hid myself and now God says who told thee that thou was naked hast thou Adam points his finger at the woman and then he says what is this thou has done and the woman said Adam points his finger at the woman and then he says what is this thou has done and the woman said the serpent beguiled yep I did exactly what you asked him not to do but his answer is the woman that you gave me she gave it to me and I did to verbalize what's taking place Adam says I was afraid and I hid I was like well what have you done and the very first thing they do and I want to look at it as one of the first characteristics of their broken nature was to say she did it and then she's like he did it and points to the serpent and we know that God despite where the fingers were placed in verse 14 he begins to curse The Serpent and there's judgment but this was the ACT Adam blamed the woman the woman blamed the serpent and to kind of give us kind of Grease the skids a little bit and get our minds thinking on what's been burdened me on the subject over the last few weeks it's an act or expression of disapproval that's what a noun blame would be an act of disapproval or it would be the responsibility for something that is wrong or done wrong you accept the blame or you place blame it's an act of expressing disapproval or kind of the responsibility for something that is wrong we used it as a verb where Adam blamed the woman it's place and responsibility on somebody for something that you deem wrong if somebody bakes a really really good cake you don't blame them for it right so it kind of blamed carries with it this negative connotation who's done this and are you looking someone to blame and when it's good you're looking to compliment you're looking to express something so blame kind of carries with it a wrong blame means if you blame someone it means to find fault with them and we'll write we'll kind of touch on what fault means here in a moment now I I share this and I hope that this could strike you as adding some kind of layers or some depth to this but to use the verb blame if I blame you it's a rebuke the word means and it's the richness in its original meaning and of these other languages it means to condemn or to criticize and the Very if you want to say the etymology of the word or just the the conjugation of it and what builds it in its prefixes and suffix the suffix of it in the blame it's the opposite of praise there's something just something that just struck me and I just meditated on for some time it's supposed to blame is the opposite of praising someone to blame is the opposite of commending someone so if you just looked at it logically that if something bad happens you blame someone if something good happens to you praise them or give them credit and so blame kind of is the opposite of encouraging somebody blame does the opposite of inspiring somebody and I want you to think about that that that's what blame does is it does more to kind of tear down and more to harm someone just in its word because when you praise someone that does something to encourage one but when you blame that's a discouragement I think that's a good important very important and very good point to consider as we talk about the blame game now enrollment so as we've looked at the failure of the man and the woman in Romans chapter 5 verse 14 speaks this and we're just kind of grabbing a truth from this nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression who is in the figure of him that was to come so it's Adam's transgression Adam sinned Adam he made a mistake and though we can kind of delineate where his mistake was and what he did and how he fell and what he was knowledgeable of and what his act was if we could put it this way Adam's transgression the phrase suggests that he bore some responsibility and so Adam was responsible despite his instinct to blame the woman When God Says did you eat of the tree in the Garden of Eden or this God this tree that I told you not to eat of Adam answering truthfully could have just simply said yes I did but rather he says uh this woman that you gave me and and notice how he's not even totally Shifting the blame on the woman right this woman that I don't know if you forgot you gave me that's that's interesting he shift wanted to shift the blame to the woman but in case there's any question whether or not Adam was responsible he's like now you you're the one that gave her to me like when I was when it was just this we were doing fine but when you wanted to put me to sleep and take her out now that she stands there and she can be tempted now I've fallen because you've done this and it's a way of Shifting the blame and if I could say this he had every reason just to own it every reason to say yes I did it in verse 12 he could have just said instead of saying the woman that thou gave us to me he could have said yes I did it but instead he shifts it First Timothy chapter 2 verse 14 it says and Adam was not deceived so kind of give some color to his action brother Branham in one place says she was a part of him and he was willing to take her responsibility upon himself So Adam had already acted in a responsible way brother but I'm characterizing the act that Abraham did it's so beautiful as Romans 5 14 is pointing to it that Adam even in his sinning was a figure of Christ who was to come who would become our sins so he could have taken responsibility but it what a beautiful picture he would have painted of how that Christ bore took responsibility for our own sins but yet any when he verbalized it brother said when he acted he was taking responsibility for the woman but now when answering for it he shifts a little bit but now it says Adam was not deceived but the woman being deceived was in the transgression guess what the Bible says Adam transgressed the Bible says the woman was responsible as well so neither one of them could we build the scriptural case to say that they had no reason to admit culpability or they just they were one of them was innocent one of them had been duped uh 100 completely and they shared no blame but despite her instinct to pass the blame to the serpent she was responsible and she knew she was at fault but she passed it on and in each one of these instances maybe we could ask we're looking at this scene the Temptation and the fall and before we get into the Judgment when there's judgment if we looked at it from a legal perspective they're trying to affix liability for one who's acted in a civil context they can actually say you're 40 to blame you're 60 precipit to blame and they can kind of divide liability if injuries were a certain amount and you're proportionally liable you can they can reduce the amount you would owe according to what they felt you were responsible for and who's to blame you may be speeding through a green light and somebody may run the red light and they could say you know what but for your speeding you're partially liable and the person who ran the red light they're also liable so when we look at the situation we're saying well who's at fault fault is a shortcoming or failure the word even suggests some sort of opening or Gap where something is left undone and and there's a fault like you think of a fisture or a break in something it's a flaw it's a deficiency there's some sort of lacking so when we say fault it's really broad that we could bring ourselves uh who's at fault who did something wrong who left something undone who did the shortcoming who failed in these situations who's to blame who would we blame in this as Adam said it's the woman that thou gave us me do we just kind of back all the way up and say wow let's just go ahead and blame God or do we say well it was the devil who used the serpent we're looking at who's responsible for the ACT who who should bear the consequences for what was done and that's what we read in the preceding verses yeah and what we're what we're describing is the blame game and it was sometime last year that I heard this phrase I remember if you want to show that uh I was going to use the all your base are belong to us for this uh but it says I'm not saying it's your fault I'm saying I'm blaming you and just really stuck with me and this was the beginning of and they and this this sermon that we're preaching tonight that I believe we'll just be able to finish tonight Lord willing and just stand on its own and I feel that this is a very important subject that we're expressing to you tonight and I would I would encourage you to hit that subscribe button no I would encourage you to share this with anybody who misses it that's part of our church because there's a chance there's some that would not hear this and I feel it's so important for us as a church to have this to understand this principle and have this Instinct that that when something goes wrong we're not quick to point the finger like Adam and when the finger gets pointed at us we're not quick to keep it going we're the kind of people says game over good man what happened let's fix it right and so I feel this is a very very important subject and it was this phrase I'm not saying it's your fault I'm saying I'm blaming you I think it just perfectly describes the mindset of people in the world today and it kind of carries with it the human nature to where there's my there might even be a part of us that says I know it's not your fault but I'm blaming you I know it wasn't your mistake I know it wasn't your deficiency I was I know it wasn't you that left the opening I know it's not you that had the lacking you're not the one with the blemish but yet I still need to blame somebody and that to me is what makes it a game almost is that there's it has its own set of rules uh that's kind of confined to this activity is the whole the whole objective and goal is to not be the one that's to blame so even if you're not at fault you blame somebody else or even if you are even if they're not at fault you blame them so if you want to have T-shirts printed I'm not saying it's your fault I'm saying I'm blaming you it would make for an interesting one there's one A friend of mine told me one time it was on the front or I think it just said on the front sometimes never sometimes regardless now chew on that for a while now as we've looked at the very first blame game I hope we've kind of introduced some things into our hearts tonight our minds as we think about it and fault in blame if we're using blame or fault and kind of using those interchangeably they really Center on responsibility and so though it would say I'm not saying it's your fault I said that I'm blaming you you know in some ways what's happening is since blame and fault relate to someone's responsibility to blame someone would be our effort to make someone accountable so something happens uh the the man eats of the in the analogy eats of the tree of the this fruit of the tree and now he's partaken in it and now as he's been called in the carpet did you do what I told you not to do he when he says the woman that thou gave us to me there's some sense in what he's doing he's trying to say you know what she's the one that should answer for this because the question was asked of him and by pointing the finger he's trying it's an effort to make the woman accountable and so we blame or find fault when someone is irresponsible and we do that because in the most innocent sense we want them to answer for it and so now I feel like I'm real deep into the teaching part of this we're trying to unpack this Blame Game and how it works that when somebody does something let's say that you're not even a participant you're an observer and you see that somebody does something and causes something and you're like oh my goodness look what they've done and someone says what's happened here you go he did it he did it it's the very action of saying well he should he should be responsible for that he he should have he should answer for what he's done so it's our attempt to get them to answer for something they've done now I I may have lost count and I don't know if I wrote it down here what it is so if I get the numbers wrong it's not an Easter egg I apologize I just got it wrong and it reminds me of a sermon brother Paula Fontaine preached one time where he called it three simple words and he kept using four over and over and over again Adam it's just three simple words just remember these simple words and just Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself is but I want to go through some problems I think I maybe have six here just three simple problems six of them and and the first problem I identify with the blame game because now the instinct to blame someone is they need to answer for this but you know what people just instinctively resist accountability it's just wired in US that whenever and and it's just really really strong from a young age that whenever someone's did you did you know a kid could be one and a half years old and learned its first words it's got a paintbrush in their hand paint everywhere paint all over the wall it's like did you do that and they're like and they point to the dog right it's just hardwired and it works really good from the beginning that we just instinctively resist accountability now as we begin to become more adults or we are more adult-like and not just there in a diaper with the paintbrush our pride gets in the way and we don't like to be questioned about something when we've done something we don't like that we don't want to have to answer for it we don't like to be challenged why did you do this and explain yourself that's being answerable we by Nature resist that Genesis chapter 4 verse 9 just watch how quickly this is kind of nature filters into the children and the Lord said unto Cain after uh regarding Abel where is Abel thy brother and he said I know not am I My Brother's Keeper and what was this he resists the even the inference of responsibility like where's your brother and his first thing is instead of maybe feeling that if he's being asked do you even know where he is he feels that he's responsible for his whereabouts he says am I My Brother's Keeper the question doesn't even necessarily suggest that he knew or should have been responsible for that he was responsible for it but it shows when he says am I My Brother's Keeper it shows that he's not willing to be accountable he doesn't want to be questioned he doesn't want to have to answer and just as Adam showed it I think we're all very good at blaming but not very good at accepting responsibility in Romans chapter 9 verse 19 it says that will say then unto me why doth he yet find fault for who hath resisted his will Paul in talking about election Paul come up the sovereignty of God and how that he chooses and how he chooses by love he anticipates the objection and he just draws from Human Nature that's just gonna say Well then why does God blame me why does he find fault with me why should we be held accountable isn't God to blame Paul anticipates the objection and remember he doesn't even answer it because it's not even worth answering but it shows the nature of humanity not willing to accept responsibility quick to shift the blame why does he yet blame us why does he find fault with us who's resisted his will is it he to blame for the way that we are and so that's this is the problem with the blame game is we instinctively resist accountability or we just if I could put it this way maybe the more obvious but we just don't like to be blamed we're good at blaming but not very good at being blamed and so if I could kind of uh extend that a little bit and call it another problem this is problem number two if you're counting my words another problem with the blame game is it's an act of imposing accountability on another since we're trying to hold them accountable if someone's done something and acted in a way to where they've caused a problem and we say he did it he did it he has to answer by that by playing the blame game you're not only wanting to hold someone accountable and they instinctively resist it you're doing it against their will because the it's an act of imposing answer ability on someone if we place the blame it's the act of identifying someone that we think is responsible for a fault someone who's responsible for a wrong and if the person's unwilling to be accountable a blame usually only provokes a defense so this is the problem with it that unless they unless they have are willing to be held accountable once you blame them you're not going to get them to say sorry I did it it's usually you gave me the woman it was a serpent that Did It My Brother's Keeper so if someone is not willing to make themselves accountable it's only going to be an instinct to be self-defense to be uh to be defensive I tell you I don't know all the ninjutsus and all the other things out there the MMA levels but we've all got a black belt in self-defense right because as soon as somebody as soon as somebody we just we just sense it I didn't do that right because our self-defenses are just so strong that we just instinctively it's just a reflex before they could even get out no uh I didn't do that walked right and we take care of it real quick because nothing's going to touch us and it were just really really good at this instinctively not being held accountable because if we haven't asked for it we feel that it's kind of been uh pushed on us I had a friend one time that says uh it was unsolicited or UNS an unsolicited advice is criticism in another form they just didn't want to be accountable but there's a truth to it because that's how you're going to take it Ephesians chapter 5 verse 21 it says submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God there is a lot that can be said about accountability I'm kind of carving this out just as a little part of the blame game but when it says to submit ourselves to one another in the fear of God the word submitting speaks of arranging ourselves not necessarily underneath somebody but it's arranging ourselves to one another that if we submit ourselves one to another you tell me who's submitting and who's not if I've submitted to you and you've submitted to me who do you say is the who's the most powerful who's the one to under subjection we've submitted to each other we've leveled it so it's not so much trying to put someone on top and someone on bottom and someone in power and someone in a position of weakness if we submit ourselves one to another the phrase is suggesting that we're arranging ourselves to one another in relationship and that it's a voluntary the word submitting ourselves one to another it means a voluntary attitude of cooperation it is it's a giving in it's assuming responsibility that I'm going to assume responsibility I'm going to answer to you and I and you're I'm willing to answer to you and it's this Mutual accountability in this Mutual dependency where we're going to mutually carry a burden I'll answer for myself your answer for yourselves okay let's submit ourselves one to another and to submit one to another it means to yield to one's admonition or advice so it in that way you just take care of the fact that it's unsolicited advice you're saying I'm willing to hear I'm willing to listen that's what it means to submit one to another to submit to someone it means you're making yourself subject to answer to someone and so if someone is not willing to submit to another person and you blame them the only thing you're going to do is provoke the defense because they haven't they haven't been submitted to you they're not cooperating with you they haven't put themselves in a position to be made answerable to you and let me say this uh just a connection to somebody or a relation to ship to somebody alone does not hold us accountable you can say well brother Aaron's the pastor so he's accountable to the Sheep you know I I I ought to be right and as the Bible teaches and the message teaches it and the Sheep accountable to the pastor it's so beautiful that when you recognize Mutual dependency is what avoids codependency and it's under the guise of codependency that sheep are abused pastors are abused because once it becomes a codependency that's when there's manipulation abuse and control and there and people are not didn't answer for their conduct and so the relationship alone does not hold us accountable we must within the context of the connection and relationship voluntarily submit to it it's one of the things that I've learned in studying the subject is that accountability should never be imposed by power so if someone ought to answer you could recognize they need to but you can never impose accountability by power accountability must be offered willingly and voluntarily so accountability is never imposed it's offered something that's yielded it's welcome through humility and so if we try to blame someone who hasn't welcomed the blame or hasn't welcomed the correction hasn't welcomed the the answer the accountability then we put them in that position where we're just trying to fix blame and once we do it we just cause them to instinctively be defensive but remember that about accountability if you want to be accountable then you have to voluntarily into humility offer it and I know we might have situations as adults where we want to hold people accountable and you may feel that you have the right because you're in relationship to them but what you what you would desire is that that person would offer it wouldn't work if all of a sudden I just picked up the phone and started calling people in the church and said I'm just going to hold you accountable on your desired detox and it would go ring ring and you'd pick it up and you'd be hello and you'd say excuse me it doesn't work that way does it has to be voluntarily offered I'm not interested in auditing that anyways now the third problem with the blame game I should have said second just to kind of get you guys the third problem with the blame game it's an is it's an act of self-justification and if I could put it this way and I think I think these things are real heavy principles tonight real real solid uh this is good good eating kids eat free and all there is a stake on the menu tonight even though it's very simple I think it's there's some heft to it there's some real good cow the caloric density is off the charts tonight when I say the Act of self-justification I hope that means enough to you that as we kind of Amplified a little bit for a few moments when we blame someone we're often often when blame we blaming others it's more of an active excuse in ourselves it's not so much that we're accurately assessing blame on the appropriate person but when we blame others it's maybe more so that we're trying to excuse ourselves or we're making excuses for our mistakes Adam did it Adam could have said you know what I shouldn't have done it but I knew Lord that if if I didn't take her to myself and show some responsibility she would have died Adam more or less used by pointing the finger finger he was making an excuse as to why he did it and so if we're going to have willful personal accountability if we're going to voluntarily through humility take responsibility for our actions then then we've got to we've got to demonstrate that example first in fact I said but willful accountability is taking responsibility and it's and and it's it's showing ourselves as being I I'm gonna I'm willing to take accountability I'm willing to be held accountable and it affords a great example instead of just offering excuses the Bible says in Galatians 6 5 for every man shall bear his own burden remember how we look through this in verse two how bear you one another's burden but now in chapter verse five it's this burden which is a load or obligation one's own personal obligation speaks of a ship that's Laden down with Goods but these goods are marked for that ship and that ship is made to transport that so it's not the kind of Burden you say oh no they're loading the ship let me take some of this and put it on my ship it's like no Every Man Has to bear his own obligation notice we have to answer for ourselves we must answer for our load for our responsibility for obligation in not loaded up on somebody else because that's what verse two is saying bear you one another's burdens and in other words the number one rule of that would be carry your own and don't put on them your own don't put on them somebody else's so we must answer for ourselves and not this put this heaviness or this inappropriate weight on somebody else according to verse two and so black the blame game one of the problems with the blame game is it is evident that when someone blames somebody else they're usually not necessarily wanting to actually hold somebody truly and purely accountable but there's an element of excusing themselves with it and so throughout this I'm hoping maybe just to kind of look at the other side and say just focusing maybe at one time on the the positive side of not playing the blame game but if we're going to have willful humility or willful accountability through humility when others see our willingness to be accountable so if we're saying tonight game over I'm not going to play the game a blame game anymore if people see us being willing to be accountable it motivates them to be accountable and we can Inspire Inspire others in our relationships or others in our family to be accountable by accepting responsibility ourselves before placing the blame because we're only we're only affording them an example that and I wonder where e the woman got the nerve to blame the serpent she's sitting there going we're busted we're busted we're we're dead in the water there's no way we're getting out of this and and Adam says I didn't do it the woman you gave me she did it she's like I didn't think about that I knew I didn't know you could do that and maybe she's kind of smarting a little bit because she got blamed but she's like I don't like the fact that you threw me under the bus but I didn't know you could throw somebody under the bus so the serpent did it hey and so she learned she learned from Adam that oh you can you can blame it on somebody else and so if we said game over and we were willing to accept responsibility accept the blame it affords somebody else the example of accepting the blame and it motivates others to be accountable when others see that you hold yourself accountable it motivates them to be accountable in Matthew chapter 7 verses 1 to 5 this is a real critical scripture this could have been my text and I think just reading through it just kind of adds to this it adds some more weight and some more Meats to the to the skeleton of this in Matthew chapter 7 verses one to five let's just work through this judge not that ye be not judged and so it's really uh talk it's really challenging us on our instinct to condemn somebody else and you know kind of draft a sentence he says for with what judgment ye judge ye shall be judged and what measure ye meet it shall be measured to you again so kind of however you want to judge somebody else you're going to get judged by he says and why now this is when it it I mean it escalates even further and why behold this thou the moat that is in thy brother's eye and we're all kind of thinking yeah I've noticed that little speck of straw there I've noticed that little sliver but consider it's not the beam that is a 909 Jesus using this extravagant dramatic language to make a point or how about say to thy brother let me pull out the moat out of thine eye and behold a beam is in thine own eye and isn't that just like human nature to see something wrong in somebody else and perceive it as something that needs to be dealt with when we're not willing to deal with an even greater problem in ourselves and perhaps not even considering that the beam in my own eye is impairing my ability to appreciate the severity of the sliver in my brother's eye because Jesus says Thou hypocrite First cast out the beam out of their own eye and then Thou shalt See Clearly to cast out the moat out of thy brother's eye when he says judge not it's an act of offering an opinion concerning right or wrong you're making some sort of assessment whether someone's in the right or someone's in the wrong it's calling someone into question it is a it is a part you could say of a blame game you see the fault in someone else do you want them to answer for the fault you say well you need to address this you need to deal with this you've got the smoking right you've got this moment you're right and Jesus saying you know what you can see the fault in somebody else but you can't see your own I think we've mentioned this here before you've heard of the phrase the pot calling the kettle black and it wasn't that they're both black it's the pot seen Its Reflection In The Kettle because the kettle is is is reflecting the image of the pot and so that when someone says well that's just the pot calling the kettle black well it's not saying that the kettle's just as the same fault as the pot it's saying the pot has no idea that the air that it sees and the Blackness it sees in the cattle is actually not in the kettle it's in itself and aren't we all aren't we kind of instinctively able to see the bad in somebody else or project the bat in somebody else's actually our own bad like that girl is such a gossip let me tell you what she does hey and it's like the girl may never say a thing which you've projected your own gossip onto her through on weakness and complexes and and this could be in all sorts of ways it just doesn't have to be you know a guy talking about a girl girl a girl talking about a girl this pot calling the kettle black it's behold in its own blackness in the kettle and that's why Jesus calls it hypocrisy can't remember who said it but it's it's true enough well I guess who said it might cause you pause but I don't know who said it but so there's probably no such thing as a conscious hypocrite I've heard some people get close but there's probably no such thing as a conscious hypocrite they're convinced now they've got a problem they've got a problem shouldn't you address yours first no they've got a problem and this is at that heart this is at the core of the blame game that we're very quickly ready to see something a perceived weakness in somebody else that they're we're not willing to consider in ourselves so notice how remarkable the scripture is in Psalms 19 verses 12 to 13. who can understand his heirs what a question who can understand his mistakes who can understand his faults who can see him the Bible says every man is right his own eyes and the ways a man are clean in his own eyes and there's this this kind of this really robust means of self-justifying and well you know if I did it I mean is it kind of like well the steps of the good man are ordered of the Lord and you know this is predestinated and you know and things happen and they're just always willing to justify it I mean could you just imagine you know eichmann's over there going well look what it accomplished guys right prophecies fulfilled and that's the way some people act is they look at the results and they see the outcome and they see that God made it work out and they're willing to justify well that's why God did this and that's why God did this because they're always quick to justify themselves so when this question is who can understand his heirs who's willing to own them who can recognize him who can own them cleanse thou me from Secret faults Purge me of the unrecognized mistakes that I'm so quick to blame others for or for which I am that I unconsciously excuse cleanse me from Secret faults the unrecognized thing unrecognized things that I'm actually to blame for that maybe I blame on other people or I I just instinctively excuse or that I'm just merely unconscious of what honesty what introspection as the question is asked who can understand his errors and then the psalmist immediately says Lord cleanse me then and he says keep back by servant also from presumptuous sins it speaks of how we'll be innocent of the great transgression and they'll not have dominion over me but a presumptuous sin is a sin against the checks of conscience hold me back from the sins that are against knowledge now I just want to open the door and just point into the room where cognitive dissonance lives and I know enough tonight to not go there because from that moment on you all would exercise it to the very end but this this this part of our brains like we don't cognitive dissonance speaks of how we don't like it when we get uncomfortable and we don't like it when we have when we think something is true and we're confronted with evidence that we might begin to recognize that controverts what we're the opinion we already hold and that's called dissonance and so what we do is we just reject anything that makes us feel uncomfortable and so this is I believe what presumptuous sins is kind of touching on is how there's this check against your conscience and if I could put it this way knowledge without action only increases our sense of guilt when you know something and don't act accordingly or when you know something and act against it it only increases our guilt so the presumptuous sins these are the things where I'm acting against knowledge now David the psalmist just said you know Lord who can know his heirs Purge me of my secret faults for these things that I'm not aware of that I do that maybe I unconsciously blame on somebody else or I'm unconsciously excusing the things that I've been able to justify without even a thought but Lord even those ones that I know I shouldn't do but I just find myself saying it doesn't matter and coming up with excuses for it and because it's knowledge without action or acting against knowledge increases our guilt because cognitive dissonance is such an uncomfortable feeling we're quick to shift the blame and excuse our conduct I'm going to read a statement from a book that I read years ago as fallible human beings all of us share the impulse to justify ourselves and avoid taking responsibility for any actions that turned out to be harmful immoral or stupid I don't know why I said stupid so aggressively I think it's the the drywall dust my lisp is in 100 full active mode too they if you could think about that how we all share the impulse to justify ourselves and avoid taking responsibility when something is harmful immoral or just wrong or strong-headed or wrong and and the statement that's made in this book is how do you get a moral man to lose his moral compass and I'm kind of rephrasing it it says just let him make one mistake and self-justification will do the rest isn't that shocking that if you want to see someone lose their integrity lose their testimony find themselves falling in in Scandal all it takes for a good man to lose his way is one mistake in self-justification he says most of us will never be in the position to make decisions affecting lives and deaths of millions of people but whether the consequences of our mistakes are trivial or tragic listen to this on a small scale or a national canvas most of us find it difficult if not impossible this is why presidents can't own it but this is also why children stay far away from accepting it it's impossible difficult if not impossible to say I was wrong I made a terrible mistake the higher the stakes emotional so the higher the stakes would be emotional Financial moral the greater the difficulty the higher the stakes in other words when accountability is the most necessary when someone needs to answer we need to figure this out we've got an issue here someone is to blame something's amiss the higher the stakes the harder it is to say I'm sorry I was wrong I made a terrible mistake it says it goes further than that most people when directly confronted by evidence that they're wrong do not change their point of view or course of action but justify even more tenaciously just think of the tens of millions of people today when they found out that fox settled the defamation suit the Dominion filed against them and admitted to the tune of almost a billion dollars that they lied about the election lines think of how many people begin to engage in cognitive distancing now I know the truth they'll justify even more tenaciously even irrefutable evidence is rarely enough to pierce catch this phrase because I'm coming back to it the mental armor of self-justification this is why we act in the blame game the Bible told us in Matthew chapter 7 the Instinct of human nature it offers us some sort of solution with this attitude of who could understand his heirs we can't understand our heirs our prayer ought to be Lord cleanse me from all these secret faults where I I I am to blame but I don't know it I am to blame but I excuse it and Lord even worse cleanse me Purge me keep me from these presumptuous sins when I act against my knowledge because all I'm going to do is start justifying why I did and it creates a mental armor if I could continue in this it's human nature I think what this is drawing on it's human nature to take credit for success right that's why when you read something about your the meaning of your name or how they say now it's just not what your name means does it have hard D's in it or does it have a sound or does it have a sound and it all has meaning right so when we read it and like oh oh I don't agree with that but like you read a little bit further but I agree with that it's the same person it's the same theology it's the same idea we're just it's human nature to take credit for Success you know it's a tribute the success of something to our efforts but just as strongly we explain away our failures self-justification takes credit for the good actions but makes excuses for the bad actions and so this is the fourth I mean the second problem with the blame game usually when we blame someone we blame the person who's not there and so we often implicate the innocent or the voiceless the ones who don't have a voice the ones that don't have a say the one that can't say anything when we excuse ourselves and let me say this with absolutely if you are 100 to blame and you blame somebody else the innocent are blamed if you shift the blame to somebody who maybe is partially being but you're fully to blame and maybe we do it to someone who's not there right whenever we're in school and we have a group assignment it's the person who didn't show up who tanked the group Michael I sure wish Teddy was here because he blew it right and you're quick to blame someone who's not there the Dutch have a proverb the absent always Bears the blame because it's just human nature and so when we are in a position where we ought to be accountable for our actions and we shift the blame and we deflect it oftentimes we're doing it to the weaker which Adam could have definitely be characterized as saying hey he pointed his finger at his wife but is she not the one that was deceived is she not the one that should have had his empathy is he is she not the one that he could have said you know what this woman that you gave me I had the responsibility over her I made a terrible mistake I'm sorry but through our Shifting the blame and the blame game it's often the absent the voiceless or the weak or the innocent that get the blame but let me say this I should say this about Christians that as Christians and as a people of Integrity we ought to take more share of the blame and much less share of the credit that if something is done well and there's credit to be given for it as a Christian let somebody else share the credit unless somebody else have the credit and if something's wrong we ought to as Christians take more share of the blame than we are willing to take care of the credit and let me just say that this this is the kind of Mark that fathers could have in their home this is the kind of Mark that we could have for the brothers here there's so many uh Brothers here that excel in leadership and have very weighty important positions within their their Industries let me say if you don't already put this in practice a great leader shares more of the blame and much less of the credit brother random in the sermon my new ministry he says you don't have to be rich and mighty in this world I was going to use this at the very end I just felt compelled to put it right here in what should have been the end based upon time but he says so you don't have to be rich and mighty in this world to be great in the sight of God you only have to be humble in your heart God calls that greatness remember he says a great man is somebody who makes you feel great he says he that's great he that's great enough to Humble himself that's a great person that'll take the blame for everything what would we call that person let's just be honest let's just say that a group of us got together and we vandalized the fellowship hall and after we were done you know everyone gets called on the carpet and we're like hey who vandalized the fellowship Paul and a few of us Brothers and Chase brother Chase not even there he goes I'll take responsibility for it I mean that's maybe not advisable as your lawyer but I mean it almost doesn't even magical but I believe he's speaking within reason a great person who has responsibility he'll take the blame that'll humble himself he says that's greatness is somebody who's not afraid to shoulder the blame somebody's not afraid to say you know what I'll take responsibility for it that's my fault no I'll own it it's okay let's not get bogged down in proportional liability let's not get try to figure out who's responsible for it let's just figure out what was wrong what happened you know what I'll take ownership of that let me take it from here let's go forward let's fix this I remember one time at the very beginning of the church something came up and I mentioned something to brother Mike and it was just something we had to address and his response was adapt and overcome and you know he he didn't have time to try to figure out who's wrong how we should handle it or you know how it could have been handled it was we see the need let's just adapt and let's overcome in the moment that we're in I think maybe too often we're you know we want to hot wash and download instead of just addressing a problem and going forward I know it may be politically incorrect to quote Dilbert but I believe this is from it was either from I'm not yeah I don't know if it's from Mr Adams you saw what I did there but it says the job isn't done until you've blamed someone for the parts that went wrong that's where we live jobs not complete until you found someone to blame for the parts that aren't perfect for all the hiccups for the delay we got it done but we didn't get it on time and it's Teddy's fault we didn't get it on time and so the third problem with the blame game is it keeps us in bondage to weakness I think this may be just one of the most important parts and and I think we're still doing good on time if I could finish in seven minutes but the problem with the blame game is it keeps us in bondage to this to self-defeat we're defeating ourselves when we choose to play the blame game when we put a quarter in the arcade to play the game the blame game it's we're admit we're it's a it's a self-defeating move and it keeps us in bondage to weakness this is something I found as I studied the subject the blame game is often played by those who have a victim mentality and I believe that some could be characterized as this but we can momentarily in certain instances though it may not be our character there's times when we feel so overwhelmed or we feel so attacked we feel that something's so wrong that we kind of take on the Persona and the feelings and we consider ourselves the victim I'm the aggrieved I'm the victim I'm the one that's harmed and for someone to carry a victim mentality be characterized as that somebody whose thought process and their thinking is characterized by blaming everyone and everything else for what's happening to you in other words these unfortunate events that have happened I'm the victim and it's kind of a way of saying I didn't cause this they're just out to get me I didn't do this this is a conspiracy I'm not responsible this is just how my life works and I know that I could spend a lot more time on this mindset of the victim mentality and how that when we blame others we're we're yielding where's that when we blame somebody saying that person had the power that person had the control I didn't I'd love to spend more time on this but I want you to catch that when we blame somebody else and we're willing to let them be fully answered before it we're saying it was outside of my power do you know what notice what you've just done you've just forfeited your Liberty you've just forfeited your power you forfeited whatever right you had to not participate said no I'm in I am subject to that whim I'm subject to that person whatever their actions are I'm drawn just got like a tractor beam I'm just drawn into it and I had to do it and let me just say this problem with the blame game it keeps us in that bondage of mental weakness it keeps us in that self-defeating cycle we're blaming everyone and everyone else but when we blame we're basically taking more power and giving it to somebody else more power and giving it to somebody else let me say this you cannot overcome you cannot address the problems in your life if you insist on being the victim and always blame somebody else Leo Tolstoy I know I'm probably not saying that right since it's Russian but he said a bad mood is often the reason for blaming others but very often can you catch this his brother Leo has to say this very often blaming others causes bad feelings in US the more we blame others the worse we feel think about what's going on inside of our spirits and how strong these mechanisms are in our hearts talk about a segment of character disorder that when you think about how someone has done something and we have this victim mentality maybe we're in a bad mood so we blame somebody else but he's saying very often it's blaming others that causes the bad feeling so Something's Happened and when you as soon as you attribute by I hope you can catch this as soon as you attribute the blame your sense of offense grows greater and you think it's because you've measured what they've done appropriately like I can't believe they did that to me ow that is disgusting I can't believe they did it you should be a sh oh my you are fully oh my goodness the worst we feel we don't realize that we're doing it to ourselves we've only begun to feel worse and worse and worse because we're putting the blame on somebody else and our conscience is saying you know better you know better but what we're doing is we're trying to pass that ugliness on to somebody else and we don't even realize that the reason why we feel bad is not because of the initial offense but because of all of our efforts to place the blame on somebody else and not accept responsibility ourselves it's self-defeating because we're overtly relinquishing power and self-control to somebody else or maybe not self-control just control to others and by blaming others to some degree and I'm careful I say by some degree we're admitting on some level we're powerless Proverbs chapter 28 verse 13 He that covereth his sin shall not prosper he that makes excuses for it he that justifies them himself shall not Prosper shall not Advance shall not make progress shall not be profitable in other words if you cover a sin it corrupts you if you cover sin it weakens you you can't Advance you can't grow it has a defiling corrupting nature to it he that coareth his sins whoever is in the mode of blaming excusing self-justify he's not going to advance and now notice the Bible says but whosoever who's so confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy I draw from this scripture the claim that blame is one of the most destructive forces in relationships and one of the most destructive forces in our families whether you want to talk about home or work or any kind of relationship or church blame is one of the most destructive corrupting defiling forces there are you know it could be said that some marriages crumble because of Acts of infidelity some marriages crumble in moments or instances of violence and there's and it's obvious and there's things that are done and we can attribute the crumbling of that marriage too uh some distinct uh unfaithfulness or some harm or some damage that's done but you know that most marriages slowly dissolve and an escalating of pattern escalating pattern of blame and self-justification this is this is where and you say oh my you know why why are you talking about the Neighbors in the apartment next door it was super relevant to this point I think it's important for all of us to think about what corrupts our relationships and how marriages of people that we love and even people who claim to believe the message and people who who claim to love each other how do they get to the place where they have contempt how do they get to the place where they're no longer willing to work together you can see that it's often just this snowballing of blame because they've been able to at some point put the blame on this person and maybe they act defensively and maybe they're not owning it maybe it's their fault but if you've been able to somehow attribute a hundred percent of the blame to somebody else or use the fact that they have some blame and they're not willing to own it to not own your own then it creates this pattern of self-justification for the ones you know and for the ones you're willing to be blamed for and blame for everything else and without noticing it I think this happens in so many relationships you're free to Amen to the extent that you agree and don't feel like you're getting called out on it but when we start with that Blame Game and even in the context of relationships we don't even notice that we become entrenched this is how people get polarized through cognitive dissonance through blame through self-justification we get entrenched in polarized positions and one feels this way and the other one feels that way and they're both in but it's his fault and they say no but it's her fault and they're stuck in it what got him there it's the blame game and that's why it's called mental armor because the Bible said who's so confesseth and forsake of them shall have mercy that mental armor blame hardens our hearts that's what it does every time you blame it's an injury every time you blame you get harder your conscience gets harder your conscience gets harder but listen when the Bible says confession it softens it when we take responsibility for our own actions we feel better I challenge you to try it maybe try it maybe the most innocence of context that the next time your child does something where you're absolutely convinced they're 100 to blame say I'm sorry it's my fault let's fix it and you'll find yourself in a position where you'll probably feel a lot better because blame only hardens our hearts whereas confession softens it in Colossians chapter 3 verse 13. the Bible says for bearing one another and forgiving one another If any man have a quarrel against any even as Christ forgave you so also do ye I encourage you to go back and read this scripture spend some time pondering it but it's saying be gentle be even tempered be self-controlled and if any man have a quarrel and all right you're trying to get technical brother it said man brother Aaron is talking about the men he's talking about us believers If any man have a quarrel against any the word is blame if anybody blames somebody else if anybody has a complaint to get someone else if anyone finds fault in somebody else forgive them this is what the Bible's telling us to do it's not saying that if you blame someone file a complaint if you blame someone you know you need to place the blame it's actually saying you know what Let It Go forgive them don't get caught up in the blame game because the fourth problem with the blame game nobody wins there's never a winner in the blame game and it always comes with the price the Bible's saying we have to forbear one another forgive one another we have to be gentle we ought to be even tempered and if any man blames somebody else if anyone have a complaint with somebody what you ought to do if you have this instinct to blame if you recognize the blame recognize it and pay in placing blame it comes with the price and you may think it's just a quarter in the arcade you may think oh this game is free this is free where I can play it as much as I want no it always costs to play the blame game and the cost is high because even when blame is Justified even when you feel that person is to blame and you absolutely know it I know those brothers are the one that vandalized the fellowship Paul I know they're the ones that did it they need to answer for it it carries negative consequences and if I could put it this way just so you could understand the blame game there are no winners there are no resolutions the game can the only way that you can end the game is to quit it it's a game over I won't play the blame game anymore because it just escalates it spirals it goes out of control and if I could say this about the blame game the reason why I say it comes with the price and it carries negative consequences it is the exact opposite of problem solving right we spend so much energy trying to figure out who's at fault we have we put so much effort trying to place the blame whereas instead we ought to Jesus says forgive and look for a solution forgive it if there's pieces that need to be picked up let's pick them up forgiven if there's something broken let's fix it let's not shame somebody and Shake somebody and begrudge somebody and you'd look at the other scriptures that are being used in this context it's encouraging us let's listen when something's been done and it's wrong the opposite to problem solving is trying to place the blame and figure out who's liable who's at fault the best thing to do is to forgive and fix the Bible says forgiving one another in other words some of the translations say be quick to forgive why because Christ forgave us also when we were guilty right when he could have put the blame entirely upon us because he was guilty what did he do were the guilty ones and he said I'll take it he shouldered our blame he accepted responsibility for our fault and he forgave us even there when he's down on the cross he doesn't say you crucified me you put me up here he said forgive them Father for they don't know what they do so if I could say this even when the fault is clear even when the blame can really be placed upon somebody we ought to have a deeper empathy for the offender we have to be more moved to forgiveness yes blame is available the blame card is on the table the blame game is always available for you to step up to it but you know what you could do instead of blame if any one of you have a blame against somebody else he's saying be quick to forgive don't enter into the blame game so when we have an opportunity to blame we can be empathetic I know this is the lengthy quote but I feel we're doing awesome on time I mean let me just say this in terms of being empathetic towards those that make mistakes in Galatians 6 1 I think we even have the scripture there it says ye who are spiritual when you find one taken in a fault when you find someone who's a blunt to blame you heard spiritual restore such a one within a spirit of weakness considering your own selves what does that speak of empathy when someone makes a mistake are you above them have you never made one I mean it was a question I asked once somebody one time I said have you ever made a mistake when doing this and and and I'd kind of impeached him a little bit I kind of boxed them in and when I asked if they'd ever made a mistake they wanted to say they never made a mistake so you know what they said this is where I kind of paused on a conscious hypocrite they said yes because if I say no it'll come across as arrogant so they admitted to making mistakes just because they if they it said that they hadn't because they thought they hadn't they know they would sound horrible and that's where it's like where's the empathy with someone is in that place where they never do anything wrong they've never made a mistake then how do you think they view everybody else who does and so where do we get as people when we look at a young person who's making a mistake well you've got an individual that falls and we immediately just judge him and castigate them and say all sorts of nasty things about them what about yourself who would need be without the grace of God we should throw our we should acknowledge that the Bible say who confesseth and forsake it shall be shown Mercy why don't we just say I am what I am by the grace of God and but for the grace of God their goeth I and then I've somehow found myself in his bed of mercy and they're renewed every morning and he's kept me and he's provided for me and if it listen if it wasn't for the grace of God we'd all we would all be wrecked so we ought to have that instinct to be empathetic as opposed to blaming forgive considering ourselves putting ourselves in their shoes and saying you know what if it was me I'd want to be forgiven if it was me I'd want to be understood surely that person didn't mean to do that surely they weren't this way I could even go so far as saying this is a lot of times people do things because they're just they're just clueless not because they're mean they're just clueless maybe that's a harsh word to use they're just insensitive they're not overtly mean they're not doing it because I really don't like that guy I'm going to do this they just don't realize what they're doing is mean anyone in that case they're having a lot of Grace and being able to establish boundaries and ways to address that would be what that person needs instead of mistreating and bullying thing and talking bad about them and but being empathetic they don't realize it we got to help them realize it some way but you know even the person who is intentionally means something's done Something's Happened to them and that's why they are the way they are and without empathy even if you can't be empathetic at least without sympathy saying something happened to them we just perpetuate the problem brother Branham said in the sermon the baptism of the Holy Spirit he's making a comment about how he'd come back from traveling when you came back there was a little issue in the church he says when we come in we found the church kind of in a little upset here and there this is kind of a neat story isn't it and some of the members had began to kind of get a little lukewarm pull away holding little enmities against each other and so forth like that and I went around from one to the other until we got us all straightened up he said now it's all right and there's nothing wrong and there was nothing wrong with any of the members they're everyone fine men and women but what happened something got in there something mixed things up got a little lukewarm had a little entities or whatever said if they could just realize this is the part I know it maybe seems just a little bit maybe a little bit off subject or maybe just in a little bit different vein but I want to take this from this if any man have blame forgive he says if they could just realize that that's the devil that gets between the people that's exactly right it's not the people if you can let a brother see that then he won't hold enmity against the other fellow he'll feel bad he'll feel like well I feel sorry for my brother see he did do wrong why it wasn't the brother it was the devil that did that so the brother did wrong he's like Adam he's in the transgression she's like the woman she's in the transgression he's like King he's in the transgression there's there's a portion of blame there's someone to be at fault but he says you know it's the devil that did that you say well this guy did a certain certain thing your brother didn't do that your sister didn't do that that was the devil that got into them and that did that so don't blame the brother the sister blamed the devil that's the one who caused it I shared this I wrestled with whether or not I ought to share it just because I feel like it kind of takes a little bit different light on the whole subject but I want you to just recognize that we do have something else we can do when the blame game is offered to us we can forgive and then if we feel really really pressed to be able to put the blame on somebody why don't we just drill down a little bit deeper and say if the devil that does it and put the blame on the devil they say well yeah I mean maybe I mean the serpent was responsible and Adam was responsible and the woman was responsible and we could recognize all the responsibility but just place the blame squarely on who we can blame so that we can have some empathy and if not empathy some sympathy for those who make mistakes and are at fault ah the blame game I hope we can say game over to it the Bible says who can understand his heirs and then ask cleanse me cleanse me for my secret faults that's the attitude I want you to have I if we could with the slide there just in in in your view who can understand his heirs cleanse thou me from my self-justification cleanse me from my cognitive dissonance keep it far from me cleanse me from this always blaming others doesn't make you a bad person it's helping you understand what you do have responsibility over there's people that gonna they are to blame they did make the mistakes they did do things to you they are responsible but Lord what am I responsible for what are our are my heirs I believe this is the attitude that we ought to have what is my share what could have I done better this happens a lot in in counseling that generally people come to you with a problem they have with somebody else and and what they're wanting to hear from you is all your opinions on how bad that person is in what we can do together to fix them and I've had this happen in all the the all the years I've counseled for whatever reason God always put it in my mind that when someone comes to me with the problem and the problems with somebody else I I'm not counseling somebody else I'm counseling the person that came to me and my instinct has always been well what can we do to help you to overcome this and you'll be surprised how many times it's like me I've got to do something about this you mean you're not you're not gonna go talk to him wait what do you person doesn't even go to our church they're not even a believer you want me to call and say I don't know if you heard but I'm a message pastor and you are wrong I'm so sorry and you start to counsel the person you say well you know what you need to show a lot of Grace you need to show a lot of patience have you said or done anything that provoked this did you do something to put yourself in a position where they didn't trust you well how dare you to actually try to find some secret fault in me we should be asking ourselves what is my fault that should be a way that we should approach problems together is I've got this problem what can I do better I have a problem with somebody else what have I done wrong there's a preacher I can't remember just exactly what Aries from Henry Ward Beecher I don't know why we do all three of those but it's just Henry Ward Beecher every time I see him referred to it get his middle name ward in there but he was asked One Time by a young preacher you know how can I keep my congregation from falling asleep and I didn't find find that because I was searching for Solutions it says young preacher I'm 48 years old how can I keep the congregation wide awake and attentive while I'm preaching and so Henry Ward Beecher replied that he always had a man who watched for sleepers so like a deacon and he kind of looked out in the church right and he'd walk around and he'd try to find somebody who was sleeping and if you ever found somebody I got a lot of Grace for kids on for kids for children that eat free on Wednesday nights but it goes around and he said he'd find somebody that was sleeping and he'd given him instructions as soon as he saw anyone that started to nod started the dolls or started to fall asleep he had one instruction to run to the pulpit and wake up the preacher and that was the instructions and what was hid reward beecher's self-awareness or what was his his conviction I'll take responsibility for the ones that are sleeping don't Rouse them up they probably have their reasons much better than my own and they they put them to sleep and what I loved about that that's you could put that slide back up there but John game over I love it game over young preacher comes to Henry Ward Beecher how could we keep the congregation from falling asleep when I'm preaching let's figure this out and let's find out all the things that make them sleep and let's find out what they're doing the night before and you know whether what energy drink are they using because some work better than others and let's do vitamin B pills just nothing if I said you know what Young preacher don't put them to sleep that was game over to the blame game it didn't even start and I say let's quit it anybody here playing it you know you know in the Nintendo days when the game wasn't going the way you liked it you hit the reset button right you just hit the reset button that was it you could start all over I don't know how the gaming systems work these days who knows it's probably one of these things where you can't get rid of it but it's there again but I I just suggest turning off the game console turning it off just get rid of it let the devil have it back just not worth playing you've been trying to win it trying to win it trying to win it and you've never won yet you thought you did but you only felt worse because no one wins the blame game and I say let's just quit it stop playing it if we started stop and do as the Bible says in Revelations 3 19 as many as I love I rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and repent this must be our zeal I remember the the phrase my wife will share it with me 20 something years ago I just remember I think might have been when brother John had preached something her her dad on how it expresses the Zeal of the age that if God's asking them to do something I remember at the time maybe in my theological mind I'm thinking I don't know maybe the Zeal the age is the son of man what do you think right like you just you get in your mind loftier ideals but this is the this is what he asked him to be zealous for to repent and this must still be our zeal that we're taught to be quick to repent just as quick as we are to forgive so be willing to ask ourselves even in the face of when we've been harmed and when we've been hurt and maybe when our blame on somebody else is Justified to just simply ask ourselves what could have I done to do better and you might actually find yourself instead of blaming someone you might actually find yourself apologizing to someone and say you know what I want to apologize I put you in a tough spot I want to apologize I should have done this I should have done that and in with the apology the person's like oh no no no no no no that was my fault just think about how practical this is that you're willing to own it you're willing to accept it you've got down on your knees before God In Prayer you've confessed and forsaken you've softened your heart and you haven't hid yourself behind the mental armor of justification and now you begin to feel and you begin to get over those barriers enough to say I'm sorry I didn't mean to do that and the other person's like oh I accept your apology but really it was my fault what you don't know is I did this and put you in that situation and at that point if you really weren't playing the blame game you don't go I knew it you just say hey it's okay let's go forward let's go forward game over let's end the blame game I trust it's spoken to your heart in a very relevant and deep way again I encourage you to listen to this again I don't think I've ever told a church to do it but I encourage you to listen it again if you can stomach it and if someone in your family hasn't heard it find a nice way right say I learned a lot I'm sorry I've made mistakes and if you want to know why my heart's changed listen to this service right instead of saying I heard something tonight and you need to listen to it like of all services you miss you missed the one on the blame game right no let's not do that but I think it's important for us as a church I want this to be a part of our character as a church I want this to be part of the way that we handle differences with one another I want this to be a part of how we handle our relationships because as a church we're growing and we're not just growing because we're knocking out walls we're tearing down barriers we're tearing down barriers and we're growing closer together and as we do we need to understand one another and we need to be able to not engage in these these instinctive things that are harmful to ourselves and hurtful to other people and I want us as a church to have it in our hearts that the blame game is not an option but solving problems is and we will work through things we'll make things right and we'll figure out a way to achieve success instead of trying to figure out a way to shame somebody and blame somebody will you will you agree with me that game over the end of the blame game as a church that we will and I'll promise this to you as a pastor I'll take responsibility I'll hold myself accountable to you I willingly voluntarily offer it to you willing to be accountable and let's not have a blame game in this assembly and if we could do it as a church maybe it'll be a good example for you and your families and I know it'll make a difference in your life I love you thank you so much for your attentiveness tonight your patience it's been worth it could we stand together
