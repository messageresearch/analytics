TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Ezekiel CH 28:1 it says moreover the word of the Lord came unto me saying son of man take up lamentation upon the king of Tyrus and we realize that this is actually um spoken also speaks of Lucifer and Satan so he says thus sayith the Lord God thou seest up the sum full of wisdom and perfect in Beauty thou Hast been in Eden the Garden of God every precious stone was thy covering the Sardis topaz and the diamond the Burl the Onyx and the Jasper the sapphire the emerald and the carbuncle and gold the workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou was created Thou Art the anointed cherub that coverthe thee so thou was upon the holy mountain of God thou Hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire thou was perfect in thy ways from the day that thou was created till iniquity was found in thee by the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst of thee with violence and thou has sinned therefore I'll cast thee as profane out of the Mountain of God and I will destroy thee Oh covering cherub from the midst of the stones of fire th heart was lifted up because of thy Beauty thou H has corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness and I will cast thee to the ground I will lay thee before kings that they may behold thee thou Hast defiled the sanctuaries by the multitude of thine iniquities by the iniquity of thy traffic therefore will I bring forth a fire fire from the midst of thee it shall devour thee and I'll bring thee to ashes upon the Earth in the sight of all them that behold thee and they that Know Thee among the people shall be astonished at thee Thou shalt be a terror and never shalt thou be anymore amen you may be seated we've been uh speaking on the subject of in the beginning and we're wanting to continue in that subject you notice how a robust it gets whenever I give the title that's by Design it's a feature not a flaw but we've been ministering on in the beginning and I want to take just a step further continue on the same subject examining the same scripture Genesis 1:1 in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth and I want just to maybe take a step further because we're going to start focusing more on the creation itself and uh and picking up on where we were last time but look at God created in the beginning God created and as we were looking at that um just want to express a few things in the beginning just to uh lay a foundation of what we were speaking on last Sunday when it says God created this is now an expression of God himself and as he created it was by Divine wisdom and divine understanding so when God created he had a purpose in doing it so it was purpose-based he had a a focus and a drive that he had when he began to create and it so it's thought- driven there's something behind it that was causing God to act and when God created as we read in the creation in Genesis chapter 1 and Genesis chapter 2 this is the act of God establishing things and establishing Destiny determining destination and so we looked at as Elohim the architect the one who existed by himself who had these thoughts within himself and he had a plan he had a blueprint he had something that he was wanting to accomplish something that he was wanting to achieve we might call it a masterpiece an artist but he had these thoughts within himself and he wanted to bring those thoughts into expression and he does that by creation and we were looking specifically how that God's thoughts are different than our thoughts we say well I think I want to run a marathon well I could think that all day long I could think that for the rest of my life I probably never will run a marathon but if God has a thought it's not just something fleeting it's not just something like a fancy that he's having at the moment but his thoughts are real and they have an eternal quality to them he's not like those of us who draw something up on a piece of paper and say oh one day I'd like to do this God's thoughts are real and they are Eternal and brother bradam said if you can see this you can see many things speaking about the thoughts of God and how they are real and they are Eternal he says if you can see this you can see many things and in that vein and in that channel of him establishing that God's thoughts have substance they have reality and there's something that of of weight and significance he says the BR Pride was already in his mind he says yes she was she was existing in his thoughts so in the moment that God began to create he is already existing we he already has these thoughts of us we exist in his mind as thoughts that he's pondering that he's thinking about and the Bible says in genes Jeremiah CH 10:12 speaking of the creation and God he hath made the Earth by his power he hath established the World by his wisdom and hath stretched out the heavens by his discretion so the Earth was made by his power it was established by his wisdom he stretched out the stars and the heavens by his discretion so creation is an expression of God's discretion creation is an expression of God's wisdom creation is an expression of God's power and it was made by his wisdom it was made by his power we look at the heavens why are the heavens established the way that they are it was God's discretion it wasn't by uh circumstance it wasn't by God merely saying well we're just going to create a gravitational pool and just where everything settles that's the way it's going to be but God had an intent and he had a purpose in the way that he laid things out and even man has seen the pattern in the stars and seen the symbolisms in the Stars which was God's first Bible so he's made the Earth by his power he's established the World by his wisdom and then brother brandham says God made the Earth he made it for a purpose to take a church out of it a bride so when God made the Earth in the beginning when God created he had thoughts those thoughts are real they are Eternal and at the very center of those thoughts and at the very center of his heart was the bride she was already in his mind already in his heart so when he made the Earth he made it for the purpose of getting a bride out of it now to me to have that understanding changes everything about creation that it wasn't God conducting an experiment it wasn't God saying what I'll do is I'll just create a massive Humanity give everyone free moral agency we'll just kind of see how this shakes out in the end but rather God fornew all things God had a purpose God had an intent and he made the Earth to get a bride out of it so if God made the Earth for something he's going to get what he wants you say that about God God gets what he wants and he and brother branam writes the heart purpose the Eternal purpose of God was to take a bride of his own choosing so these are things that God this intent he had in the beginning this purpose that God had in the beginning his heart purpose the very Central purpose of God is very at his very essence his eternal purpose was to take a bride of his own choosing he wanted to have a people like unto himself that that he would call a bride that he could have fellowship with and and and expressing it in terms of bride it's it's to he wants relationship he wants communion he wants to have this continuity with one and that's what God wanted in the beginning he wanted to have someone that he could have fellowship with and and the the reason why we just keep visiting this subject each time and we're looking at here in the this subject of in the beginning and as we establish things here the objective is not just historical and not just informative that we could have more data that we can uh load into our our scriptural database but rather the objective is to see ourselves is to look into the Bible as a mirror and to see ourselves and the Beautiful uh the beautiful time and season that we're living in is we have a message that is placing the bride in her ordained position not just merely traveling through a stations are traveling through time and and traveling through a particular prophecy but we've arrived at a time where the bride is being placed in ordained position so God what he wanted in the beginning God is achieving now in the end I we want that to be very personal and it should be very personal to you now this is a little still a little bit of review but it starts to touch on the subject uh that I've I've been pondering uh very heavy in my heart over this past two weeks and we we begin to touch on it last week brother brandham says the very creator that created the Earth for a purpose so we know that God created the Earth for a purpose the purpose he created it for is to get a bride out of it he says Satan defiled it so you have God the Creator Satan the defiler God created the Earth for a purpose and then Satan now seeing God's creation he actually defiles that creation and that's what that Satan's purpose is to obscure God's purpose Satan's agenda is to make God's will cloudy to to make it hard to understand make it kind of make it complicated and Satan hates Revelation we're taught that he hates Revelation and he hates the revelation of the mystery of God so there's things that Satan despises things that Satan hates and you see that here brother and says God created the heavens and the Earth he created it for a purpose and then Satan's Satan is acting to defile that creation so Satan hates the revelation of the mystery of God and it says this and this this scripture is twofold now to kind of create a link to to go further in 2 Corinthians chapter 4:4 says and whom the God of this world which is Satan hath blinded the minds of them which believe not so this is Satan's objective his goal is to Blind the minds of the people he's the God of this evil age he has been building his own Eden so he says he blinds their minds lest the light of the Glorious gospel of Christ who is the image of God should shine unto them so the kingdom of Satan which is dark darkness and death opposes the Light of Christ it opposes Revelation it opposes understanding and that's what Satan is still doing today this is he's characterized as this one who wants to Blind the minds of the people so that they cannot see the light of the Glorious gospel of Christ Satan's always trying to defile God's program always fighting against God's perfect will and now what I want to take out of this is how that we can see that Christ is in the image of God so and and that may seem oh brother Aaron you're really breaking new ground I I know that I'm not but we just want you to think about that that Christ is the image of God now it says in 1 Corinthians chapter 1 verse 24 but unto them which are called This is the gospel that Paul preaches he preaches Christ to them that are called both Jews and Greeks Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God so Paul preaches the Glorious gospel of Christ and Christ who is in the image of God he is also here called the power of God God and the wisdom of God so in the beginning God created the heavens and the earth when we read that in the beginning was the word john11 we see Christ so God created we see Christ creates because he says he created the Earth by his power he established the World by his wisdom so Christ is the power of God Christ is the wisdom of God so we see God creating we have to see Christ and now this now let's join this statement in 2 Corinthians chapter 4 Christ is the image of God so Christ is the power and wisdom of God and he's also in the image of God and if you want to say those things are expressed in the same thing certainly it's expressing the same thing Christ is the power of God Christ is the image of God so he's the image of his power he's the image of his wisdom but Christ is in the image of God now in Genesis 1:27 it says so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them so Christ is the power and wisdom of God it is by Christ that all things exist he created by Christ because he established the World by his wisdom he created the Earth by his power so this is Christ there in the beginning and Christ is the power and wisdom of God and he's also in the image of God and we know the image of God is male and female because it says he created man in His image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them now this isn't One Creation another creation and a third creation he created him in his image and that image held that image contained male and female his brother Brandon when he's teaching in marriage and divorce and he he's talking about the woman and her position and even how Satan has been her designer a and the place that a woman has come to today he says God has male and female now you could look out and you could see something that is the wrong kind of expression an ungodly per expression of something he say just because you see the perversion doesn't mean there's not a genuine he says God does have male and female so in God there was an expression of Christ and in Christ there is an expression of of Bride and bridegroom if we could put it that way in Ephesians chapter 3: 9 to10 we're just kind of laying these principles down um piece by piece just to kind of get get to a spot to go further today now Paul again as he's already expressed to the Corinthians uh he's preaching the gospel and his desire and he as he preaches the gospels to make all men see what is the Fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God who created All Things by Jesus Christ this just this really kind of summarizes and sums up some of these things were saying at the outset that God created All Things by Christ the power and wisdom of God Christ who is in the image of God and this was and he creates as he creates he's expressing something within himself and Paul says I want to preach a word that brings us all into the fellowship the mystery that's been hid in God since the time he began to create that God as he began to create had a hidden purpose he had a he had something he was wanting to achieve goes I want to preach a gospel that brings us into Fellowship of the mystery that has been hid in uh from uh since the beginning of the world hid in God and then he continues to the intent that now or for the purpose that now God in the beginning created All Things by Jesus Christ when he created in the beginning there was a mystery that was hid in him but now I want to preach a gospel to the intent that now under the principalities and powers in Heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God that's a that's a a sentence that would be a lot of fun to diagram so your homeschooling moms maybe you could do that with your third graders tomorrow have them diagram this sentence but this is how one translation renders it so that now through the church the fullness of the wisdom of God might be made known to rulers and authorities in Heavenly places so they want they want the Paul is saying I want the wisdom of God to be made known I want the full wisdom of God the the full manifestation of God's wisdom the fullness of God's power I want it to be made known but not in the heavens and not through Jesus Christ but rather through the church if we can all come into the Fellowship of the mystery so that now the fullness of the wisdom of God may be made known to rulers and authorities through God's body so the purpose now is not that wisdom and power would exist in the heavenlies it's not pointing back historically to wisdom and power that existed in Jesus Christ but by the word of God the full wisdom of God might be known to rulers and authorities well who are those spiritual wickedness in high places that the power of God be be be would be made known through the church manifesting the mystery so the wisdom and power of God is in the in the body of Christ the wisdom and power of God is in his church it's in his people now to to see how uh maybe the ultimate the the ultimate Triumph of this in Genesis 3:1 15 he speaking now a curse to The Serpent and as this curse Goes Forth uh and and and and concludes with the cursing of the earth and the cursing of man and the woman uh brother bam teaches us that that closes the beginning now once the curse has gone forward uh and Mankind is ushered out of this Eden condition then that ends the beginning and that the Fallen creation goes forward from there so as God speaks to the serpent he says I'll put enity between thee and the woman and between thy seed the seed of the serpent between thy seed and her seed if it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel so when when they read this we realize that this is a prophecy of Christ that this prophesies the Redeemer it's such a beautiful a beautiful statement we read it's a curse to one but yet in it it prophesies of a redeemer it's prophesying that the seed of the woman would come and that it would bruise the head of the serpent now the Hebrew there that is used I'm G try to get this to work well there we go let me go back um the Hebrew word that's used here this is the Hebrew that word is it would be in our English he she or it and so when it's translated here it's translated to it now we understand that this word would speak of Christ but there's many different translations that not only render it uh take it out of the it but they also translate it to she and that that it's it's it's suggested in the meaning I will put enity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed and it not instead of it rendering it it says she shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel so the the word here he she or it it could be a prophecy of he which is Christ but it's also a prophecy of she which is the bride Paul in in or habac chapter 2 it says the vision is yet for an appointed time at the end it shall speak it will not t so it's referred to as an but then Paul in Hebrews chapter 10 referring to the same scripture says he will not t so the he the it is no longer just an it it's now a he the vision is not an it it is a he and so here we could read well yes it's he shall bruise thy head but there's a time when he becomes a she and so there it's not just uh speaking of him but it's speaking of her and it's not just speaking of Mary because Mary was a type but it speaks of the mystery of God at the end time where it says in Romans chapter 16:20 and the God of Peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly so Paul connect catches this it's not he shall bruise thy Hill but also she shall or shall bruise his head she shall bruise thy head because it's under the feet of the body of Christ under she under her feet under the bride's feet will Satan be crushed shortly so when we read in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth Christ is the power and wisdom of God Christ is the image of God that image is male and female the bride is the power and wisdom of God don't don't make God some far off God that you're trying to to reach and trying to contact you have Affinity with him you have a connection with him brother Bram says in fact in her the bride is summed up and manifested the Eternal wisdom and purpose of God so when you is summed up it's the summation it's the completeness in you is summed up and manif ested the Eternal wisdom and purpose of God my what what beautiful thoughts that he has towards us now now I'm going to have a I want to take some time to go through a number of statements that when we say it it might just be as simple as just okay we'll put that there we'll put that there and these are just things that will be kind of laying out um before you now follow if you could in this statement here brother B says God had a purpose and a mystery so God had a hidden purpose he had a hidden Mystery and that's what I want to speak on to the church this morning the hidden Mystery of God that he had in his mind before the world ever began so when he preaches Christ is the mystery God revealed he's talking about the God having a purpose God having a hidden Mystery that he had in his mind before the world ever began and he says and how that it's unfolded itself right down to the present hour that we're living in then you will understand clearly you'll see what I believe what is being done so if you can catch what is the mystery of God that's unfolded to the present hour he says then I think you can see clearly what is being done what is unfolding what is happening now he says in a couple paragraphs later the entire Bible is an expression of one goal that God had one purpose he wanted to achieve in the entire Bible brother BR is distilling the entire Bible down to one purpose is a hidden Mystery a hidden purpose that God had in his mind before the world ever began he says it's unfolded to where we're living now and he says the entire Bible is an expression of this one thing that God wanted to achieve and then he says all the acts of the Believers in the Bible have been in type and expressing what God God's Great goal is so now every example in the Bible should be viewed as an expression or a type of what God is ultimately wanting to achieve and now in the last day he has revealed it and shows it and God's help well you'll see it right here this morning what the Lord has had in his mind all along and has expressed it so this is this is the theme of Christ as the mystery God revealed the hidden purpose of God that he was that was in himself in the beginning this hidden Mystery that was in his mind that's unfolded itself to the present day that the Bible is an expression of this one goal this one thing he wanted to achieve that all the lives and act of the Believers throughout time and history is just expressing what his great goal is and then in this last days God reveals it that's quite a statement that that's that's uh that's really uh really really heavy stuff now I I can just distill this down to this brother BR in Christ is the mystery God revealed says there's a three-fold purpose that God had a three-fold purpose of for Christ and he said his first purpose was to manifest himself in Christ to manifest himself perfectly in Christ in the language he uses to describe that first purpose is is groom or Adam it's Christ this is the bridegroom this is the second Adam or the last Adam he types it to Adam this is the first purpose that God would be made manifest in Christ and then the second purpose is the bride pre have preeminence in the bride that would be referred to as the woman or the or the church that he desires to have preeminence in his bride so the first purpose was for God to be expressed in Christ the second purpose was to have preeminence or to be expressed in his body which is his bride and then the third purpose was to be restored back to the Garden of Eden so that's what brother Bram was talking about he had a purpose he had a hidden Mystery these are the three folds to it you have husband you have wife you have a Garden of Eden you have groom you have bride you have this Garden of Eden and he calls it a condition or a position so he says this that the three-fold purpose of God God's great mystery is revealed so the in these three different things he's saying they've been revealed I'm laying them out there to you so you understand the first purpose the second purpose the third purpose the three-fold purpose of God's great mystery is revealed God manifested in Christ Christ manifested in the church in order to redeem the Lost Eve back to the original condition in the Garden of Eden so it's a restoration back to the original condition in the Garden of Eden so there's things about that condition that God wants to restores back to he says to restore to the kingdom to its rightly position so it's condition its position we should think of condition first and position first before we think of location we think Garden of Eden Garden of Eden we're thinking well we're going to go back by the river Euphrates or it's it's somewhere in the Middle East and we start thinking of a local we think of traveling we think of a specific coordinates but rather we want to think position and condition first before we think of a location and so here's a few statements that brother bradam makes to to emphasize this again about this threefold purpose he says and now the Christ in the church is just being made known the whole thing is the revelation of God to take Eve back to her right position again with her husband so Christ who the first fold purpose is now being made known in his church the second purpose and the whole thing is a revelation to take the woman back to her right position again again with her husband he's connected them all together in paragraph 431 he says he brings forth a brid tree which will be the Tree of Life restored back to him as husband and wife in the Garden of Eden now that's a that's a beautiful statement he brings forth a brid tree well what would the bride tree be it's the Tree of Life restored back to him as husband and wife in the Garden of Eden the tree of life is husband and wife in the Garden of Eden the bride tree brings back the Tree of Life husband and wife in the Garden of Eden beautiful poetry and then he says in paragraph 438 the three-fold purpose of God manifested in Adam and Eve so in when brother bram's talking about this purpose or a hidden Mystery that God had in himself in the beginning we're I'm just using these phrases throughout that sermon to see how brother Bram is identifying Christ the bride in this position that they that the man and the woman had in the Garden of Eden and he says the three-fold purpose of God manifested in Adam and Eve in other words God expressed his three-fold purpose when he placed the man and the woman in a perfect Eden now it wasn't the summation it wasn't the completion it wasn't the fullness of it but it was an expression of it the mystery of God the three-fold purpose of God the mystery of God was hid in Adam and Eve the manifestation of Adam and the woman in the Garden of Eden I trust that you're just kind of following me bit by bit here so now he makes this statement predestinated and we are predestinated he says there's the mystery he before Christ or anything else was over the Earth you see his great mystery that he chose the bride now this is what's Central to it and I don't mean this in any disrespectful way there is a way that you could you could um place all the emphasis on Christ but if you leave you out what good has it done you say well we just want to give all the glory to Jesus absolutely absolutely give all praise is due to him and he alone is worthy and no other man can receive worship and and so there's no there's no attempt on my part to take Christ down a few notches or put him in his place but rather if you know who he is it's necessary for you to understand who you are and that's how teaching that perverts the godhead at the end of the day does a disservice to the believer because you lose your fellowship and Oneness with Christ and so he says this great mystery is not just Christ and God always wanted to have a son and he got a son and we're all just kind of Spectators to this beautiful Oneness and we're Spectators to this beautiful Harmony between God and his son but rather his great mystery was that he chose a bride Amen brother Bram says God loved fatherhood and he said in order to become a father he had to become the son he loved fatherhood in order to become a father he had to become the son of man now we see that expressed in relationship between God wanted to be a father so he had to become a son but God wanted to be a husband amen and in order for God to be a husband he has to become a wife so he said God always wanted to have a wife God always wanted to have a wife well then he has to become so he had to become something in order to have it so Central to God's purpose Central to God's desire in order to have a wife he had to become a husband so he had this great mystery he had he chose the bride knowing Eve would fall from disbelieving the word knowing that she would fall now this is where the the the these the two pieces start to come together for the direction that I'm wanting to emphasize he had this great mystery in his heart he chose a bride and he chose the woman knowing that Eve would fall from disbelieving the word knowing that she would fall but he would choose a bride that would not fall so stop bragging right it's his choice predestin ated it's not because we're good enough or because we read well and we can understand Parables but rather it's his grace so he he put Eve upon the basis knowing that she would disbelieve the word and fall but he would choose a bride that would not fall that would hold to that word regardless of what all the rest of the world had to say about it they would hold to that word they are predestinated to stand there the adoption of children by Jesus Christ predestinated the church to that great glorious stand so this adoption is not in her Genesis or her beginning or in her birth but it's in the climax it's in the finishing it's in the end where he says she's predestinated to that great glorious stand so God in the beginning chose a bride and and this was his choosing and he chose her knowing that the woman would fall by disbelieving the word so God in the beginning created with the express purpose of having a wife one like unto him and this was a hidden mystery hidden purpose in his heart so Genesis 2 verse 8 ver 18 and I may skip around a little bit In this passage says the Lord God said it is not good that man should be alone I will make him a help meat for him God created man in His image and in the image of the man was male and female so when God looked upon Adam he saw his own image and that's why God can make this great declaration it is not good for man to be alone because God did not initiate creation to produce a likeness of himself on Earth alone but rather so that he ultimately would never be alone again he desired to have a bride of his own choosing a people like unto himself that he could fellowship with so when Adam is placed upon Earth and he's God upon Earth and he rules all creation God sees the likeness of himself in Adam so that he can bring out a f further mystery says it's not good that man should be alone because man being in the image of God held the mystery that there was another part of Adam to be expressed so it says in verse 22 and the rib which the Lord God had taken from man made he a woman and brought her unto the man so God said I will make a help meat for him I will take out a second self one complimentary to him one equal but opposite and remember in the beginning the woman was co-equal with the man is in God's origal creation the woman was not made subservient she was not made to rule over him but she was co-equal with Adam as a help meate one complimentary to his purpose so he took the rib from man and made a woman and brought her unto the man and it says and Adam said this is now bone of my bones and Flesh of My Flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man this is the first time that Adam speaks the first time that anyone else is saying anything other than God and it says Adam when he speaks the first thing he speaks of the first thing that he shares the first thing that he says that we have recorded is he speaks of his of the woman this is bone of my bones Flesh of My Flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man so the very first words of this image of God that we have recorded is about the woman and that mirror is the very first thought that God had when he began to create and said let there be light and what have we found when he said let there be light he wasn't just speaking of a of a natural light but he actually speaks of you because now ye are light you are a city set on a hill you are a candle that has been lit and so when he says when God said let there be light the very first thing he spoke of not only represented natural light but it spoke of his body spoke of his people and Adam the first time he speaks this is he sees the woman he speaks this is now bone of my bones and Flesh of My Flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man so Adam can't say well the first time I saw the woman I was speechless no he he immediately began to give a speech and so brother Brandon when he refers to these scriptures he says he is showing portraying here the bride so God is actually portraying something as he said Every Act of the Believers has been an expression of this one purpose that God is wanting to achieve it has been a type so now in Adam God taking the woman out of Adam he was portraying pre foreshadowing or prefiguring the bride God was even though this portrayed her there's still a mysterious element that remains to it God was hiding the full mystery because she's only a prefigure we can't say the woman is now the bride that God wanted to achieve we can just say to Adam now in type she is what God is going to achieve now we can see by these scriptures that the woman comes a different way than Adam did God says I let us make man in our image and he creates man in the image of God but now we're looking at foreshadowing and and a prefigure of the ultimate purpose of God because a three-fold purpose of God he says to manifest himself in Christ well that wasn't in Adam right should I start all over let me go back to Christ as Min God revealed I let me I forgot to turn on the class participation light there we go all right now you know you're allowed to talk when I ask questions but there's when brother B show us the three-fold purpose of Christ it begins with he's emphasizing not the relationship to Adam but he uses Adam as a type so God has manifested himself in his son Jesus Christ so even then in the beginning Adam is just a prefigure Adam is just a type so Adam was not Christ Adam was not the tree of life he was a type so when the woman comes out of Adam God is just expressing and portraying something and in first Timothy 2: 12- 14 he says but I suffer not a woman to teach nor ass Ser authority over the man but to be in silence for Adam was first formed then Eve and Adam was not deceived but the woman being deceived was in the transgression now we could put a lot of blame on the woman and we could be very very harsh and cruel toward towards the woman which we later know to be Eve or she's called Eve but God made it this way we've already read he says he knew that Eve would fall from disbelieving the word knowing that she would fall but he chose a bride that would not fall so then we could conclude that God made it that way that as he's wanting to express something and portray something he has Adam who is a prefigure of Christ who he's in the image of God and he's an expression now for our benefit then he takes the woman out of Adam the way that God brought them forth put her in a place where she could be tempted and would fall and the Bible says she was deceived and therefore in the transgression Adam was not deceived but knowingly transgressed now now this is a this is a lengthy statement and I I want to read it as we've cherry-picked a little bit from this already in the first few parts brother BR says let us go back to the beginning in the original creation as we know it today God made everything in pairs male and female there were two chickens rooster and hen there were two cattle the cow and the bull and right down the line but when it came to man there was only one they were not a pair now this is Brother Braham just showing us uh how when it came to Adam something different took place he says Adam had been had been made in the image of God he was a Son of God as a Son of God he could not be tempted and fall that would be impossible so God took a byproduct of man to cause the fall woman never stepped fresh from the hand of God as a true product of God she was produced from man and when God caused her to be brought forth from man she was vastly different from the other females he had created now this is all for a purpose instead of creating this category oh woman bad woman nasty no he's just we're walking through the difference in creation so that God's attributes could be expressed so she was able to be seduced no other female in creation can be immoral but the human female may be touched at almost any time and that weakness in her allowed Satan to seduce her by the way of The Serpent and has brought the woman to a very peculiar position before God and His word now it's this the fall and and Satan's attack on her brings the woman to A peculiar position now it's through the tempting and the fall that she's brought to A peculiar position because when she comes out of Adam she's bone of his bone flesh of his flesh to say that that would be evil to say that it would be sinful to say that in that expression it was a transgression would be say that Adam was also a transgression or he had it in him but the way that she was brought forth was so was done so that Satan could tempt her and then this is the peculiar position before God in his word and just follow it and notice how God this peculiar position has a real dark side we could say but a real positive side she is the type of all things vulgar foul and loome loome on the one hand and on the other hand she is the type of all things clean and beautiful as a whole and holy as the receptical of the spirit and blessings of God so instead of always maybe defaulting to the negative side she has a peculiar position because on one hand she could be used for great harm and for darkness and perversion and she's the type of things that are vulgar but she's also a type of things clean this is a peculiar position so he says on the other hand she is called the who is drunk with the wine of her fornications on the other she's called the bride of Christ on one hand she's called mystery Babylon the Abomination before God and on the other hand she is called New Jerusalem our mother one hand and the other on one hand and the other on one hand mystery Babylon on the other hand the New Jerusalem on one hand she's called a a on the other hand she's called the bride of Christ well you couldn't get more opposite and this is the peculiar position of the woman so on the other hand she is so foul and wicked and lewd that she's summarily cast into the Lake of Fire as the only place fit for her and on the other hand she's exalted to Heaven sharing the very Throne of God as the only place befitting such a queen notice how he's describing her she is Mount Zion she is the city of God she's the habitation of God she is the New Jerusalem but then the but then there's also mystery Babylon that's called the woman that's these terms are used of her she can say on one hand she's foul on the other hand she's blessed on one hand she's cursed on other hand she's glorious and you see there's two different sides to this and that's why he says she's brought to a very peculiar position before God and his word so there's a way that you could begin to describe the woman and you could describe all the negative attributes of how woman could be unfaithful and how a woman in the beginning caused the fall and and the place that the woman is today and and how Satan uses her and and the effect that she has in the lives that she lives and you could use her as a type of all Humanity in the fall of it and brother Brandon when he preaches marriage and divorce there's a lot of things that he says that can be very very heavy and very very hard to read would we would we agree on that and then he says I'm not I'm talking of the immoral now so he stops to say listen I'm I'm bringing this out but I'm just identifying an immoral woman I'm not generalizing women and saying that women are generally bad therefore we would need to Gally generally treat them bad there there's nothing in the word of God that gives a man a right to treat a woman wrong I challenge anybody to show me anywhere in the word of God where you have a right to treat a woman wrong and so when brother Bram is talking about the immorality of the woman he's wanting us to recognize prophecies being fulfilled he's want us to recognize certain attributes and characteristics of the age that we're living in and he stops says I'm not talking about all women he says I'm not I'm talking about the immoral now not you sisters he says we'll give you your place right place in a few minutes in the word of God here it was in God's place plan from the beginning so as he's describing an immoral woman he says now there's another place for a woman he says that's where I want to take you in the word of God and show you your right place in the word of God he says it was in God's plan from the beginning so in the beginning when God created he had a plan and though when though as he unfolded in creation and the woman came forth and then we see we're introduced to the woman the next thing we know she's being tempted and she falls that's not the place that God had originally envisioned the woman to be in the beginning he had a place for her he says it was in God's plan from the beginning and then when he preaches invisible union he says because she was cast over in that side because the woman played the uh played the part in that she did in the fall because she was tempted by Satan because the woman played that this one peculiar side where she's the type of all things foul because she played the part of the Harlot because she she played the part of mystery Babylon because she was cast over on that side he says she has also been given a sacred charge from God for Redemption she's got characters that she must not defile on one hand she played that part but because she played that part because she was cast in that role because she was played uh played that part she's also been given the woman has been given a sacred charge from God for Redemption in other words she's used in the fall should be used in the Redemption she was used by Satan to bring forth death she was used by Satan to bring forth disease she was used by Satan to destroy this Eden and to bring corruption to Earth and because she was used in the fall God says I am going to use her in Redemption I'll put enity between thy seed and her seed and I will cause her to crush your head she's been given a sacred charge for for Redemption let me I'm going go through some things very quickly here we read from power of transformation the one that was preached in Prescot uh October 31st 1965 he says it was God the Great Master of all intelligence that had in his mind what he wanted to do so then it's going to skip a little bit he says now 6,000 years God take to make this and we see in Genesis 1 we see God had an objective that he wanted to bring to pass so he's the master of all intelligence and he had in his mind what he wanted to do he had an objective of what he wanted to bring to pass and he he describes Creation in Genesis 1 then he says in paragraph 64 and God is going to have a church now this parallel I want you to catch this parallel he's talking about in the beginning God had master of all intelligence had an objective that he wanted to bring to pass and it's not just merely to have a creation but it's to have a bride so he says and God's going to have a church I don't care how many Dark Ages we go through or whatever more he's going to have a church without spot or wrinkle whether we're a part of it or not because he has already said it's going to happen it's going to be there in the same way that God said let there be light and there was light he's saying God said he's going to have a church it will be there so then a few paragraphs later now then all after creation God could rest because all God's word seeds that he had spoke had been brought of its kind the Earth come over there was light there was sunshine when he let let the sunshine now why did he make the sunshine so he's just describing creation God laid the seeds out the sun came out seeds begin to make manifest why did he make the sunshine he had it in his mind that if the sun don't shine the flower wouldn't grow then he speaks it into existence whatever it is he makes everything to meet its purpose whatever it is so describing the creation in the beginning the seed being brought to life by the Light by the spoken word of God because he does it for a purpose he said the same thing is about having a church here in the last days he's going to have a bride so as he points to things in the beginning he keeps bringing it back to things here in the end and then several paragraphs later God spoke it he said let there be let there be and there would be an eating let there be beautiful flowers let there be my son in my own image stand over there in the Garden of Eden and let his bride stand by his side so in power of transformation he's going to the beginning God's power to create how God's creating a story how God's expressing something the creation and he says don't you see God's going to have a bride God's going to have a church don't you see it expressed in Adam in the Garden of Eden and his bride standing by his side so he says that's what god did did for that's what God did for Adam and Eve he created this Garden of Eden he spoke it it was in his mind and when he says it then it has to happen it's in his mind God wants to accomplish it when he speaks it it has to happen this is Brother bah bringing us the master of all intelligence what he had in his mind he wanted to do he begins to express it in creation Now notice this statement here now he describes it in this way because this is paragraph 93 we went to 55 60 71 72 84 88 now paragraph 93 there was Adam and Eve Walking In the Garden of Eden every seed bringing forth it never could do anything else it never could do anything else because God said let it be that way it had to be that way then then he stops oh how I'd like to stop here just a minute to say see there is where we're facing yet the completion of that word why is he taking time to show us the Great Master of all intelligence what he had in his mind the objective that he had what he's wanting to bring to pass how it's a mirror of what's taking place in this end time he says that's what we're finishing we're finishing what God started in the beginning his great mystery Secret that he had in the center of his will in the center of heart is being achieved in this time and so God had a mystery that would began to unfold in the beginning he's preaching power of transformation The Great Master of all intelligence had this mystery that began to unfold and he said and he says this is what we're facing today the completion of that word because where God begins his work Satan's right there trying to pervert it so he makes this statement when I go home this time I'm preaching on the subject the trail of the serpent the beast at the beginning and the Beast at the end ENT tril him right through the Bible and show how he heads up and you'll get all that on Telephone you see if the Lord permits us to do it and now just watch how cunning that fellow is as I read that you'll get that on the telephone I realize there's maybe a segment of our audience that doesn't know what that is and it became it became apparent to me that whenever I maybe I have a a Bluetooth ear uh piece on and I'm on the phone with the client and my kids will come in the room and I'll go I mean if you're you're over 40 you know what this means right and I don't know if my kids are like hang loose I mean what are we talking about here kind of does Dad you need a Q-tip what do you what do you need because I'm like and they're like so I don't know if I need to go you know so they know that I'm on the phone but brother Bram is saying I want to preach this sermon to show you how cunning uh so you could see the trail of the serpent this is the first place I believe he ever mentions this when he's preaching power of transformation in October 31st 1965 says when I get home I want to preach the trail of The Serpent and his subtitle is the beast at the beginning and the Beast at the end and then he says now watch just how cunning that fellow is now he's already preaching the trail of the serpent in power of transformation because he's wanting you to see the beast at the beginning and the Beast at the end and he's going to Great Lengths to show you what happened at the beginning and what happens at the end and in power of transformation he's showing us that there's two different powers in the beginning there's the power to create and there's a power to deform so God in the beginning created but Satan in the beginning deforms and he says I want you to see the Beast at the beginning and the Beast at the end through the trail of The Serpent and when we ended last time we talked about the bride at the beginning and the bride at the end through the trail of Christ because it's not just enough to see Satan's plan but see how Satan's plan was to try to thwart God's plan and how you are at the heart of God's plan so there's two different powers in the beginning you have the power to create the power to deform brother Bram says God is the Fountain of all Grace and power and of all wisdom is in God so therefore knowing that he is the only Creator there is there is no other Creator but God Satan cannot create it all he only perverts what's been created but God is the only Creator says this in God's power to transform God is the only Creator Satan is a deformer or perverter then he says now after all of that was set in order God felt sure now that it would all be all right then came in the enemy and I'm going to call this fell with not power to create but he had power to deform not transform to deform anything deform is to take it from its original state than something that's gone wrong with it so God is the only Creator Satan is a deformer you have a Creator you have a deformer Satan cannot create if you want to make if if we can even say that Satan is equal to God in every respect except he cannot create but Satan is unable to create at all he does not have the power to create and and and this is a I remember uh many many years ago uh sharing this this story I guess it's told maybe as a joke but how that man kind had Advanced so much so I'm tipping you off that this is not a true story in case the the way the story unfolds you don't like you're like really this happened brother Aon where did you read this but how mankind because of his achievements with science they'd come to the place where they you know what we can we can uh replicate things and we could take DNA and we can clone and we're we've s we're sending out uh spaceships and uh traveling through the universe and my we're doing so much we think we've got this so let's go talk to God and say God we've Advanced to the point scientifically where we feel like we can handle ourselves and so they nominated a scientist to go talk to God and that scientist goes with hat and hand very humbly and he goes to God and says God we have made such tremendous advancements in science in knowledge and understanding of human condition and and the world and the universe uh we felt that perhaps we had achieved the place uh scientifically where we could just govern ourselves and manage our own Affairs and God said that's fine I'll let you do that but first let's have a man-making competition and whoever wins the man-making competition will be allowed if you win I'll let you take care of yourselves and the scientists readily agreed he's like oh um absolutely we can do that and the and the scientist said and God said but we're going to have to do it like we did in the beginning we have to make man from dirt and the scientists like perfect that's fine we can do that we can take dirt and we can make man just like you did God and so God said fair enough and the scientists went off and the scientists got together they began to grab their dirt and get their dirt together and God said wait a minute hold on get your own dirt that that ends the argument right God Alone is a Creator Satan cannot create he can deform dirt he can do a lot of stuff with go the materials that God has given him but Satan is not a Creator in the beginning God created and when God was creating with an Express purpose Satan was not far behind and so we're just wanting to advance a little bit further in the story now Satan with not a power to create but a power to deform if you just read Genesis chapter 1 Genesis chapter 2 it is not good for man to be alone I'll make a help me and then Adam begins to express as is bone of my bones Flesh of My Flesh woman steps forth from man this for this cause shall man leave his father and mother and we have this beautiful beautiful story that's unfolding and then the very next chapter you want to read about this man and this woman right under commandment everything perfect everything beautiful brother says every seed bringing forth of its kind oh nothing else could happen in this beautiful perfect inst say that's what we're facing the completion of that word why are we facing the completion of it Genesis CH 3 Genesis 3:1 now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field the beast at the beginning and the Beast at the end the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made and he said unto the woman yeay hath God said ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden so it's asked as a question did God say you can't eat of every tree in the garden I I just have a question asked don't don't be offended at all I just want to know are you allowed to eat of every tree in the Gard so now the woman comes forth now the serpent the the very next thing we read about is this serpent now animated and motivated by this by Satan begins to speak and he has a question are you allowed to eat of every tree of the garden so what's the first point of attack for Satan Satan cannot create he can only deform and he immediately went to the woman didn't go to Adam he immediately goes to the woman and she's because she's a type and and if I could say this if you could just allow your minds just to ponder this Satan saw something reflected in heaven so Satan would have seen something unfold in heaven and there might have even been an expression and I realize I'm speculating here so just give me some uh uh some Liberty here just to ponder uh not that we want to play Devil's Advocate but just kind of get inside Satan's head a little bit I can't do it at all I don't even know what that would be like so this isn't typ casting but Satan then in heaven because he was there and we're going to read that again in a in a moment he would have seen something in heaven maybe even something not yet expressed and maybe he would have seen some not necessarily A discontinuity or something out of place but he would have seen something unfolding in heaven and then he sees the very same thing reflected upon Earth because he's there in heaven he an anointed cherub that covers he's even expressed as being covering this Mercy Seat as it was one that's there over the throne so now there's an expression in heaven and Satan can see this in heaven now God begins to create and as he's creating Satan's observing this creation and he hears God give a commandment to a man that was made both male and female and it says be fruitful multiply and replenish the Earth so he would have heard Genesis 1 128 and then he would have witness Genesis 2:22 and 23 and now as he sees this unfold he doesn't attack the man his choice is the woman and it's not guesswork he didn't choose her because she was the weaker vessel that's because of the Fall he didn't choose her because he thought well Adam's away he's real busy right now the woman just happens to be sitting around on Instagram no he chose her for a reason it was not guesswork but it matched his desire in what he was trying to achieve he could not create he could only deform Satan could not look at Genesis 1 and Genesis 2 and say I want to try that too and say Let There Be he wanted to achieve something he wanted to have something for himself so it's his ambition that drove him to the woman because of what she represented in Ezekiel chapter 28 verses I just I I'll just start with verse 12 of man take up lamentation upon the king of Tyrus and say unto him thus sayith the Lord God thou seest up the sum full of wisdom and perfect in Beauty now this is not God's characterization of the the son of the king of Tyrus which is liken to Lucifer which is a likeness of Satan and he's speaking to Satan in the language that's used here God's not saying that you're the sum of wisdom and you're perfect in Beauty thou SST up the sun you draw your own likeness it is liled to see all over again or in the beginning thou draw thine own likeness thou form a portrait of thyself you've represented yourself as the Perfection of wisdom and Beauty so who is it he try who is he trying to be like Christ who is he trying to be like his bride in her is summed up the wisdom and power of God but he establishes himself full of wisdom and perfect and beauty and it says that thou Hast been verse 13 thou Hast been in the garden in Eden the Garden of God so Satan now this anointed cherub that coverthe of wisdom and Beauty who drew his own likeness in Beauty he has been in Eden the Garden of God and when we see him in Eden the Garden of God he comes to the woman and begins to talk to the woman and he has a question the devil has a question he's trying to uncover the secret and he's going to the woman to see if she holds it because Satan wanted equality with God he desired the place of Christ and if I could say this he despised the bride's position he wanted equality he wanted to be like Christ and he despised the bride's position because now the bride is the one that dethrones him he had a jealousy that was eating him up how come when God created in the beginning he didn't want a son like me how come God in the beginning just didn't want to be worshiped like an angels but God in his mind desired to have a bride so even the expression of son is incomplete without daughter the expression of husband is incomplete without wife God wanted to have Christ and a bride himself becoming a family but Satan wanted equality with God for thou has said in thine heart Isaiah 1413 and 14 I will Ascend into heaven I will exalt my throne above the stars of God I will sit also upon the Mount of the congregation in the sides of the north I will Ascend above the heights of the clouds I will be like the most high he wanted to be in the heavens he wanted his throne to be exalted above the stars of God the Sons and Daughters of God this is his ambition the Bible says th H has been in Eden the Garden of God because he wanted to sit upon the Mount of the congregation he's in the Garden of Eden because he wants to sit in the sides of the north Satan has an ambition now I'm going to go slowly through these words in this in this uh I say slowly it may not be slow to some slower slowish I will sit also upon the Mount of the congregation the word there congregation it's a sacred appointed place it's a sacred place I want to sit upon the Mount of the congregation it's actually rendered tent of meeting in other trans other places in the Bible it's the same word that's used in Genesis 18:4 when he says I will visit Sarah at an appointed time according to the time of life at a time of conception I will visit her and she will conceive and she will have a son so it's Sarah's appointed time a time of conception he says I want to sit on the Mount of the congregation I want to sit in a sacred appointed place he says in the sides of the north now the sides of the north it's not geographically it's not location it's not that you know we all want the north facing backyard Satan wasn't like us is it a North facing backyard what does that even mean but he it's a figurative phrase which alludes to what Satan is looking for in Eden thou Hast been in the garden of God thou Hast been in Eden the Garden of God God you said I want to sit upon the Mount of the congregation in the sides of the north sides there in the Hebrews thigh and it's Yar it comes from Yar which is a reference to the loins or the seat of procreative power so it says Thou Hast been in Eden the Garden of God and you had this ambition to sit in the sides of the north he's describing figure to the a place of procreative power in the sides of the north North that speaks of a hidden treasure or Secret place and in the Bible it's symbolic of reproduction and procreation so Satan being unable to create his own son him being unable to create his own wife him being unable to replicate himself Satan was in the garden Desiring to not create but to deform how would he do this by sitting in the Mount of the congregation by him having access to the sides of the north that's why Satan is there in the beginning God in the beginning created in the beginning God created and now Satan is right there to deform but then Satan in his ambition and his desire and this uh sealing up himself coming to Eden the Garden of God God used his own ambition against him because Satan's right there oh this is the Eden this is it how come he hadn't tempted Adam yet he's watching when the woman comes forth he goes now that's something different male female male female male female all of a sudden Adam comes forth now he sees a mirror image of God on Earth and then when he brings the woman out of the man a mystery about God's unfolded and Satan wants to attack her but brother Rand we already read it he knew Eve would fall by disbelieving the word so he actually places a trap for Satan that he had planned that God had a plan all along so here he says he writes this in if a church age book when he writing about the Ephesian age we start with the fact that there are two trees in the midst of the garden the tree of life was Jesus the other trees is definitely Satan because of what came forth from the fruit of that tree now then we know that both of these trees had a relationship to man or they would have never been placed there some orientation some significance uh some a placement to man they must have had a part in The Sovereign plan and purpose of God in the relationship to Mankind and to himself or we could never impute omniscience unto God that is all true so far is it not now the word most definitely sets forth that before the foundation of the Earth the purpose of God was to share his eternal life with man now just catch it in your minds how he's saying that the tree of life was Christ and that Satan also represents another tree so there's two trees in the midst of the garden the Tree of Life Satan represents this other tree he says they're there for a purpose that God according to his Sovereign plan placed them there in relationship to man and then he says this God being a savior it was necessary that he predestinate a man who would require salvation in order to give himself reason and purpose of being so why do you have the Tree of Life and then Satan represented there also because God had to predestinate a man who would require salvation why because he needed a reason to exist he existed but without reason he existed but without purpose so God had to have a man who would fall in order to give himself reason and purpose of being and so God himself could not tempt man so God had to create evil and bring forth a woman so that there would be an allegory there would be a story there would be a representation so that we thousands of years later could look back and read and see that God had planned it all along nothing is out of CHA cater him being a savior it was in him part of his attributes but without a man to save he could never express it so he had to predestinate a man that would require salvation to give him reason and purpose of being so he says thus what God worked out here in the garden was his predestinated plan and when Satan had brought about that which was necessary to the purpose of God then man could not get to the Tree of Life In The Garden certainly not it wasn't time it's time I'm not talking about time to close about I'm talking about this when God what when God's plan was worked out in the beginning when Satan had brought about that which was necessary to the purpose of God we see this image of the man's way to the tree of life is closed off he says it wasn't time man's access to the tree of life is closed off it wasn't time for man to come he's saying it wasn't time in God's plan so there was no upset in the Garden of Eden I I I I hate to use this uh this example but I mean God hustled Satan right you pull sharks know exactly what I'm talking about he pretended like he wasn't looking he didn't know what he was doing and Satan's like you know sneaks in over there and causes the fall and he thinks man I got him but God's plan unfolds because what does Adam do it Adam then in the moment he portrays Christ he doesn't put her away he doesn't divorce her he doesn't count his ribs say how many women did you have in me no he immediately acted to redeem her to restore her so everything's working according to plan God says the image is being reflected what I had in my mind is unfolding beautifully Adam did what I thought he would do in response to what I knew the woman would do nothing is out of CHA there is no chaos in Satan oh yeah we got him oh we got him but now a curse comes I mean s say well I didn't anticipate that what's going to happen next okay there's going to be a son born to the woman that's going to crush my head so what's the next thing he does he murders the son born to the woman because he was there in the beginning to pervert God's program he was there to stop God's program and brother brandham is showing us that this was according to God's predestinated plan that the woman would be used in the fall but then notice this Christ is the mystery God revealed he brings forth the brid tree in this end time when this Revelation is made known he brings forth the bride tree which will be the Tree of Life restored back to him as husband and wife in the Garden of Eden this is what God had in his plan all along he was saving it for the end time it wasn't all all the pieces weren't put on the board in the beginning and everything was laid out and then God just said all right I want to see what Satan's next move is he didn't even let Satan see all the pieces s was only working with what he saw God saw the beginning from the end and then Paul writes this in 1 Corinthians chap 2: 6 to8 because he wanted Satan to fall into this trap David writes about it the pit that they've dug for me they fall into the midst there other themselves oh the the wicked is snared in the works of his own hands 1 Corinthians 268 how be it we speak wisdom of God among them that are perfect yet not the wisdom of this world nor of the princes of this world that come to not but we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery even the hidden wisdom which God ordained before the world unto our Glory the hidden wisdom of God that was in him before the foundation of the world ordained unto us he says which none of the princes of this world knew for had they known it they would have not have crucified the Lord Of Glory they knew there was something to it or they wouldn't have done it but had they known the purpose behind it they knew this was was the son of God that was to come into this world but if they knew he was to come as a lamb and a sacrifice they would have never sacrificed him they knew this woman had some significance in the beginning that's why he met her to defile her but if he knew what God was doing in the beginning he never would have done it amen and oh I just was rejoicing in this over this past week God let Satan do make all his moves he made all his moves over and over 6,000 years and Satan made his last move he was out of moves and then he stepped forward and took the book and loosed it just the moment where Satan thought there's no one worthy there's no one can do it I've achieved my bride I've got Leo de right where I want it it was then when Satan had made his last move God still had one more praise the Lord not here he says now all right let's just uh take a few more statements here from Christ as a mystery God revealed he says I'm talking about the headship of Christ notice being personally identified by the original headship we have the answer to the devil's question we have the answer to the devil's question he Christ is risen and has paid the price and raising up the body the devil can't stand it you now you can't just look at well the price being paid he can't stand you can't just say well the Risen Christ is what he can't stand raising up the body he can't stand it that's the reason these ecumenical kingdoms are setting up that's the reason they're all coming into what they're doing now the devil that's the reason he's howling the way he is his wickedness has been his scheme has been uncovered by the Risen resurrected Christ in the headship over his body he says you think I'm beside myself I'm not we've got the devil's answer not me that liveth but Christ the word living in me it's not my idea it's his power not my idea it's his word he promised it here it is it's time the Tree of Life restored back to him husband and wife to together again he goes we he said it would be here and here it is we got his answer we got the answer to the devil's question we have the answer to the devil's question we got the devil's answer we
