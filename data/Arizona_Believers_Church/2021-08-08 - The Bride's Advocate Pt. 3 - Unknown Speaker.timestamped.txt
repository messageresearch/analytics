[0:00] first john chapter 2 verses 1 and 2
[0:03] my little children these things write i
[0:06] unto you that you sin not
[0:08] and if any man's sin and that's kind of
[0:11] just those phrasings they're very very
[0:13] heavy
[0:14] uh he the word is to bring us to a place
[0:17] of of righteous living that we abstain
[0:19] from and avoid these things but he's
[0:22] knowing the human condition he says if
[0:23] any man sin and he's drawing from what
[0:26] jesus taught about the comforter if any
[0:28] men sin we have an advocate that is the
[0:30] same word used that john uses when he
[0:33] writes of the comforter that jesus said
[0:35] he would send we have an advocate with
[0:37] the father jesus christ the righteous
[0:40] and he is the perpetuation that word
[0:42] there
[0:43] is translated mercy seat he is the
[0:45] perpetuation for our sins and not for
[0:48] ours only but also for the sins of the
[0:51] whole
[0:52] world and then hebrews chapter 9
[0:55] i wanted to read the first five verses
[0:57] here because i'd like to make reference
[0:59] to it
[1:00] at a particular point and so i wanted
[1:02] these images to be fresh in your mind
[1:05] as john excuse me as paul is writing
[1:08] here
[1:09] and
[1:10] he's really um
[1:12] it's one of those things if you do have
[1:14] time just to read it it's not it's not
[1:16] really a long book but you can kind of
[1:18] read through and just find
[1:20] how paul is making this example of jesus
[1:22] christ as a high priest the parallel
[1:24] between
[1:25] this new and living way in the new
[1:26] covenant and the old covenant which
[1:28] israel was under and now this new
[1:30] covenant that's not just exclusive to
[1:32] israel but god invites even the gentiles
[1:34] to come and be a part of and he's using
[1:37] the images of
[1:39] israel's faith and his images of their
[1:41] worship in trying to show that whatever
[1:44] you feel you have within the old law
[1:45] we've got something better in the new
[1:47] and he so he's drawing this parallel and
[1:49] painting this picture
[1:50] and so he comes to this place of the
[1:53] sanctuaries and and there's these images
[1:56] that they would be very very familiar
[1:58] with
[1:59] and
[2:00] i'll just maybe make reference i find
[2:01] myself just getting lost in the book of
[2:03] hebrews now but he's just
[2:05] referred to jeremiah chapter 33
[2:07] and said the promise is i'll write my
[2:09] laws within your heart and that i'm
[2:12] going to write it within your hearts
[2:13] it's not going to be tables of stone but
[2:14] in your hearts and he says this is the
[2:16] covenant a new covenant he says in verse
[2:18] 13 of chapter 8.
[2:20] then verily hebrews 9 1 then verily the
[2:23] first covenant had also ordinances of
[2:25] divine service and a worldly sanctuary
[2:28] for there was a tabernacle made the
[2:30] first wherein was the candlestick and
[2:32] the table and the show bread which is
[2:34] called the sanctuary and after the
[2:36] second veil the tabernacle which is
[2:38] called the holiest of all which had the
[2:41] golden sensor and the ark of the
[2:43] covenant overlaid round about with gold
[2:46] wherein was the golden pot that had
[2:48] manna and aaron's rod that butted and
[2:50] the tables of the covenant that was the
[2:52] law of the tablets that moses had
[2:54] written
[2:56] had written the law upon and over it the
[2:59] cherubims
[3:01] of glory shadowing the mercy seat of
[3:03] which we cannot now speak particularly
[3:06] over it the cherubims of the glory
[3:08] shadowing the mercy seat of which we
[3:10] cannot speak now speak particularly amen
[3:14] may be seated
[3:21] in the
[3:22] as i begin
[3:23] there's going to be a lot of themes that
[3:25] will seem to be repetitive
[3:27] in terms of the um
[3:29] the subject matter of the last couple
[3:31] services
[3:32] and even maybe overlapping quite a bit
[3:35] with the subject we were on last time on
[3:38] jesus being a perpetuation in which he
[3:40] was a sacrifice
[3:41] one time for all so that he is not
[3:44] continually offered or sacrificed year
[3:46] after year but it was the service that
[3:48] he performed once and when he did so he
[3:50] did it once and for all
[3:53] and we're drawing from
[3:55] first john chapter one verses one and
[3:56] two where it says we have an advocate
[3:58] and he takes this advocate and he
[4:00] connects it with the perpetuation and
[4:02] then we're going to want to take a
[4:03] little bit further on this this mercy
[4:06] seat this perpetuation
[4:08] so just a few statements at the outset
[4:10] that's kind of summary from the first
[4:11] couple services on this the advocate is
[4:14] an inner witness
[4:16] so the advocate we don't view the
[4:17] advocate as being a third person
[4:20] who's going to make an appearance for us
[4:21] in court but rather he's an inside
[4:23] witness in the language that brother
[4:25] branham uses and the way that we're
[4:26] encouraged to understand and recognize
[4:29] the role of the advocate is he is a
[4:31] supporter he is an encourager he is a
[4:33] teacher he is a guide he is a friend
[4:36] and so jesus uses the phrase i will send
[4:39] you the comforters the same greek word
[4:41] that john uses
[4:42] in 1st john chapter 2 our advocate
[4:45] and last time we were just ending on how
[4:47] that our advocate is the difference
[4:49] maker
[4:50] that's got the difference maker for the
[4:52] the believer the difference maker for
[4:53] the christian what makes them different
[4:55] than anybody else in the world is this
[4:57] advocate this comforter that they have
[4:59] on the inside and really don't have
[5:01] anything else that we could brag about
[5:03] except his graves and so he said he's
[5:05] the difference maker and then we
[5:07] recognize in ephesians how he used paul
[5:10] paul is writing and saying he's the
[5:11] equalizer such that the jews can't say
[5:13] oh well we're better because we have
[5:15] this history and we have this tradition
[5:16] and we have the law and you gentiles
[5:19] didn't have god he's saying he broke
[5:20] down the middle wall of partition
[5:22] between us and he's made us all one both
[5:24] jew and gentile and so this comforter
[5:27] this holy spirit is an equalizer it's a
[5:29] harmonizer of different parts and it's
[5:31] it's what allows us to get along with
[5:33] one another and to
[5:34] come together as a body of christ
[5:37] and so our advocate
[5:39] is given to us to maintain our harmony
[5:42] with god
[5:43] because us being that three-part being
[5:45] we have a soul we have a spirit we have
[5:46] a body it's our soul that is sealed by
[5:48] the holy ghost and then we still have a
[5:50] body that can get sick we have a mind
[5:52] that can be subject to doubts and even
[5:54] disputing within ourselves so god gives
[5:57] us the holy spirit to maintain this
[5:59] continuity with god in this unbroken
[6:02] harmony with god so that we as
[6:04] christians who love them are assured
[6:06] that he loves us regardless that he's
[6:07] with us that he's going to help us and
[6:09] we're going to make it
[6:10] and so
[6:12] we do not need this advocate and i
[6:14] realize i'm maybe going really fast
[6:16] because i have a finish line that i'd
[6:18] want to get to and i'm very excited to
[6:20] get there
[6:21] we we do not have need this advocate
[6:24] because of an adversarial process that
[6:26] we're in debt and we need uh we need
[6:28] someone to represent us we have a a
[6:30] claim against us and we need a defense
[6:32] attorney the advocate is not given to us
[6:34] because of an adversarial process or
[6:36] because god is angry with us
[6:38] and we need somebody to kind of go talk
[6:40] to dad for us or we need someone to
[6:42] plead our cause
[6:43] and though you can use that in the way
[6:45] of
[6:46] an
[6:46] analogy or a type to help us to
[6:48] understand maybe the role that uh that
[6:51] christ plays or sometimes the way that
[6:52] we approach god but if we only view the
[6:55] advocate as somebody who's trying to cop
[6:57] a plea deal for us we're never fully
[6:59] going to appreciate what the advocate is
[7:00] to us and so jesus christ the righteous
[7:04] is our advocate with god
[7:07] and not within the context of an
[7:09] adversarial process and john says he's
[7:11] not only our advocate with god but he's
[7:13] also our atonement
[7:16] and this this is something that when he
[7:17] when he points to that he is brought
[7:20] into he's he's painting this beautiful
[7:21] picture of what we have this promise we
[7:24] have in jesus christ
[7:25] now i want to use a slide and then
[7:27] another scripture to kind of help
[7:29] summarize a lot of these themes about
[7:31] the advocate and the scriptural
[7:33] principles regarding the nature and
[7:35] characteristic of our advocates so
[7:37] here's a slide that has
[7:39] um several scriptures in it that is
[7:41] going and there i'm using summary
[7:43] language now to you as we look at this
[7:45] so that we're not having to read each
[7:47] one of these scriptures but in john
[7:49] chapter 14 verses 16 and 17 he says the
[7:51] comforter of the spirit of truth he
[7:54] abides and dwells in us forever so jesus
[7:57] is calling the comforter which is our
[7:59] advocate he's also given the
[8:01] characteristic of the spirit of truth
[8:03] and he abides with us and he dwells with
[8:05] us dwells in us forever so this is the
[8:08] characteristic of our advocate then in
[8:10] verse 26 he says that this comforter the
[8:13] advocate is going to teach us all things
[8:15] isn't that wonderful
[8:17] inside teacher he's the teacher he's
[8:18] going to teach us all things and then
[8:20] after he has taught us all things in
[8:23] this great he's going to bring all
[8:25] things to our remembrance
[8:26] and so a lot of times we've learned and
[8:28] we've been taught we just need the
[8:30] ability to recall
[8:32] and the holy spirit's going to do that
[8:33] for us and so it's really it's really
[8:35] just complete
[8:37] and full what he does for us then in
[8:39] john chapter 15
[8:41] verses 26 and 27 this comforter from the
[8:44] inside now
[8:46] this inside witness testifies to us of
[8:48] jesus christ
[8:50] so it's there to constantly keep fresh
[8:52] within us the witness of jesus christ
[8:54] and then by testifying to us on the
[8:56] inside of jesus christ then we become
[9:00] witnesses of jesus christ we can make
[9:02] witness and it makes us witnesses of him
[9:05] and it's not just hearsay because he's
[9:07] inside of us testifying and witnessing
[9:09] and then we can witness of those things
[9:11] he shares with us in romans chapter 8
[9:13] verse 26 it says that this spirit help
[9:16] us helps us in our infirmities so the
[9:18] comforter this advocate helps us in our
[9:20] weaknesses where we're weak we've been
[9:23] given an inside teacher an inside
[9:25] strength a spirit on the inside of the
[9:27] inside that's there to help us
[9:30] to to to encourage us to move us along
[9:33] and and it also makes intercession for
[9:36] us he's on the inside of us but it's
[9:38] giving us groanings and how we ought to
[9:40] pray and lord i don't know what to do
[9:42] and as you begin to pray this man on the
[9:44] inside of the man begins to groan things
[9:47] and say things and speak things and
[9:49] you've experienced it before and and
[9:51] you've had situations where you just
[9:52] didn't know what to do or what to say
[9:54] but you found yourself just saying god i
[9:56] need your help and you opened your mouth
[9:57] and the right thing was said to somebody
[9:59] or the right thing comes forward in
[10:01] prayer for your family and you're
[10:02] realize that's the holy spirit on the
[10:05] inside
[10:06] witnessing and speaking
[10:08] now let's look at john chapter 16 verses
[10:11] 13 to 15. and i don't believe that i had
[10:13] used this as yet in in the fullness so i
[10:16] wanted to put this before you and then
[10:18] just highlight these certain
[10:20] characteristics
[10:21] jesus says how be it when he the
[10:23] comforter the advocate the spirit of
[10:24] truth is come he will guide you into all
[10:27] truth for he shall not speak of himself
[10:30] but whatsoever he shall hear that shall
[10:32] he speak and he will show you things to
[10:35] come so there's actually this even a
[10:36] prophetic office and a gift and a
[10:38] dispensation of the comforter he shall
[10:41] glorify me for he shall receive of mine
[10:44] and shall show it unto you all things
[10:46] that the father hath are mine therefore
[10:49] said i that he shall take of mine and
[10:52] shall show it unto you so just look at
[10:54] these little things that he's saying
[10:56] about the spirit of truth and
[10:59] where he is he works within you and then
[11:01] he's going to use you to testify so it's
[11:02] a really
[11:03] very deep um
[11:05] very deep things that jesus is speaking
[11:07] about but it guides in all truth it
[11:09] reveals things to come it glorifies it
[11:12] receives
[11:13] it reveals jesus christ glorifies jesus
[11:16] christ it receives jesus christ jesus
[11:18] christ it reveals jesus christ this is
[11:20] what we have on the inside of us and
[11:22] this paul writes in 1st corinthians
[11:24] chapter 2 this is what gives us the
[11:26] ability to know god this is what gives
[11:28] us ability to know the things of god and
[11:30] to search the deep things of god because
[11:32] there's somebody on the inside of the
[11:34] inside that guides us into all truth
[11:36] actually can reveal to us things that
[11:38] god has preserved or waiting for us for
[11:41] those that love him the spirit inside of
[11:43] us is going to glorify jesus christ it's
[11:45] going to be able to receive jesus christ
[11:47] it's going to be able to reveal jesus
[11:49] christ this is what the advocate does
[11:51] this is what you possess by the baptism
[11:53] of the holy ghost
[11:55] now as we look at these different
[11:57] functions as we could say are these
[11:58] characteristics the nature and
[12:00] characteristics of our advocate
[12:02] these these functions are not legal
[12:04] functions
[12:06] they're not with they're not functions
[12:07] that take place within a court of
[12:08] justice or they're they're not just
[12:10] functions that take place within a legal
[12:12] process or an adversarial process and
[12:14] it's not just in investigative functions
[12:17] to where it's just kind of in there
[12:18] exposing things to you and condemning
[12:20] you and convicting you
[12:22] and kind of the way that we feel
[12:24] sometimes the advocate is is he's the
[12:25] advocate on one hand is telling you all
[12:27] the things you're doing wrong and at one
[12:28] time it's telling you everything you're
[12:29] doing wrong and then at the same time
[12:31] saying hold on don't punish them just
[12:32] yet
[12:33] and there's times you get into a sticky
[12:35] situation you find yourself in trouble
[12:37] and someone wants to be the one to help
[12:39] and you come to find out later they're
[12:40] the ones getting you in trouble
[12:42] and they're playing both sides
[12:44] and they're telling you whatever you do
[12:45] you shouldn't apologize right now
[12:46] because they're really angry at you just
[12:48] give it some time and then they go to
[12:49] the other part and say i don't know why
[12:50] they're not apologizing that should tell
[12:52] you all you need to know why you
[12:54] shouldn't have anything to do with them
[12:55] because they're not apologizing
[12:57] and and we kind of have this mind that
[12:58] someone can kind of play this
[12:59] intermediary and in doing so you know on
[13:01] one hand they're telling you you're
[13:02] doing wrong on the other hand they're
[13:03] trying to tell you know trying to
[13:05] apologize for you on the other hand
[13:07] that's not just what these functions
[13:09] represent
[13:10] and so what i want you to kind of think
[13:12] about he's a guide he's a
[13:14] he's a teacher he's a reminder he's a
[13:16] revealer he's a glorifier all these
[13:18] different things about the advocate
[13:21] our advocate and this is the phrase that
[13:23] i would like just to amplify for our
[13:24] time together today our advocate is a
[13:27] mediator in our hearts
[13:30] so where he's moving and where he's
[13:32] functioning where he's acting
[13:34] is he intercedes within us
[13:37] and as he intercedes as a supporter of
[13:39] us mentally
[13:41] he intercedes as a supporter of us
[13:42] emotionally he's interceding as a
[13:45] supporter of us spiritually
[13:47] and so our soul is sealed and we realize
[13:49] that brother branham teaches us and this
[13:50] is so evident and clear in future home
[13:53] of the heavenly bridegroom and the
[13:54] earthly bride that the soul is sealed
[13:57] already in an eighth day condition
[14:00] and so if god chose if god chooses to
[14:02] seal you then it doesn't matter how many
[14:04] cancers you have doesn't matter how
[14:06] uh quick your life is cut short does it
[14:09] matter how many mind battles you have
[14:10] the soul is sealed you're guaranteed a
[14:12] resurrection
[14:13] it's already in an eighth day condition
[14:15] and nothing more can be added to it to
[14:17] make it any more perfect but think of
[14:19] how beautiful and caring and kind god is
[14:22] he doesn't just seal your soul off and
[14:24] then allow us to live in sickness and
[14:26] depravity and mental struggles and
[14:28] battles and being torn and dragged
[14:30] around and the devil say well if i can't
[14:32] have your soul i'll just declare world
[14:33] war three on your spirit and your body
[14:35] and and we be subject to all the
[14:36] elements that satan wants to bombard us
[14:38] with god says hold on i seal your soul
[14:41] and the seal is actually to become an
[14:43] advocate for your spirit
[14:45] and the seal is actually going to be an
[14:46] advocate for your body and it's going to
[14:48] stand there interceding that when you're
[14:50] sick remember by his stripes you're
[14:52] already healed then whenever you have
[14:53] lies bombarding says hold on wait a
[14:55] minute let me just have say here those
[14:57] are just lies of the enemy and lives of
[14:59] the devil he's actually there on the
[15:01] inside
[15:02] interceding and mediating on your behalf
[15:05] in your soul
[15:08] think about it your advocate is your
[15:10] faith instigator
[15:12] he's your faith activator
[15:14] so you so he's there on the inside of
[15:16] the inside and he's not like whoo we're
[15:18] sealed this is great
[15:20] the job is done but now his role is to
[15:23] activate your faith
[15:25] activate a different thought process
[15:27] activate a different vision so he
[15:28] instigates and he inspires
[15:31] and by looking at it from this
[15:33] perspective
[15:34] i hope that it gives you a deeper
[15:36] understanding of christ
[15:38] that we're not just viewing him as as
[15:41] the son of god who died for our sins and
[15:43] the price has been paid
[15:45] and and even as i had a conversation one
[15:47] time
[15:48] i was very striking that it would take
[15:50] place but i was talking to somebody who
[15:53] was
[15:54] intent on committing adultery
[15:57] and i told them what the consequences
[15:59] were scripturally according to the word
[16:00] of god if they committed adultery and
[16:02] they said but isn't that what the cross
[16:03] is for
[16:08] it's a get out of jail free card did you
[16:09] get out of hell card it's a get out of
[16:11] adultery card no sorry it doesn't work
[16:12] that way
[16:14] and so there's a way that the world even
[16:16] even nominal christianity preaches
[16:17] christ that well god created the world
[16:20] and all of a sudden chaos intervened and
[16:22] man sinned by eating an apricot and and
[16:25] now everything's in chaos and god's like
[16:27] how can we figure this out now that
[16:28] there's chaos well i'll just kill my son
[16:31] and then anybody who believes in him is
[16:33] going to receive eternal life and it's
[16:35] kind of like this arbitrary thing that
[16:36] kind of unfolded and god had a way to
[16:39] try to figure this out it's so much
[16:40] deeper than that it's so much richer and
[16:43] i'm wanting to understand more fully
[16:44] what this atonement was how christ what
[16:47] he is to you
[16:48] and in doing so i trust that it'll
[16:50] broaden our relationship with our
[16:52] advocate
[16:53] not just someone we go to when we're in
[16:54] trouble hoping that he can find us find
[16:56] a way out of our sins but rather there's
[16:58] a deeper relationship that we ought to
[17:00] have with our advocate
[17:01] that our advocate is not involved just
[17:03] merely involved in a a conversation it's
[17:06] a conversation between christ and god
[17:08] and we're not a part of it
[17:10] boy i made a horrible mistake i sure
[17:11] hope my advocate is there covering my
[17:13] tracks with god that's not how it works
[17:16] now as we said we said before our
[17:18] advocate and john joins our advocate
[17:21] with our atonement because he says he is
[17:22] our advocate he is our perpetuation but
[17:25] then there's also this role in that our
[17:27] advocate is what joins us to the
[17:29] atonement in that we stand before god
[17:32] justified forever
[17:34] so if we're justified forever before god
[17:36] i just even begin to think well if we
[17:39] are justified forever
[17:41] then
[17:42] christ doesn't necessarily need to be
[17:44] there constantly making excuses for us
[17:46] and justifying us
[17:48] he is justified by a sacrifice we are
[17:50] justified once
[17:51] right we are justified
[17:53] and so we realize he that he had
[17:55] justified he's already glorified so
[17:57] there's some eternal
[17:59] representation of you as being complete
[18:03] this is this is the promise that the
[18:04] bride has entered into or the elect of
[18:06] god as they are sealed
[18:08] so
[18:09] we realize and these are some of the
[18:10] things that i want to explore in being
[18:12] our atonement
[18:15] christ has become our mediator
[18:17] he's become our reconciler reconciling
[18:20] us to god he becomes our intercessor and
[18:22] i want us to fully understand this from
[18:24] the message of the hour
[18:26] in hebrews chapter 2 verse 17
[18:30] he says wherefore in all things it
[18:31] behooved him to be made like unto his
[18:34] brethren
[18:35] that he might be a merciful and faithful
[18:37] high priest in things pertaining to god
[18:40] to make reconciliation for the sins of
[18:42] the people
[18:43] now this is uh in hebrews chapter two
[18:46] you could start in chapter one and just
[18:48] see this beautiful picture that paul is
[18:50] laying out
[18:51] and when paul says that he has been he's
[18:54] a he's been made akin to you so he can
[18:57] be a merciful and faithful high priest
[19:00] he this this automatically to a jew
[19:02] means something to a hebrew this would
[19:03] mean something and they would think of
[19:05] aaron the original high priest and his
[19:07] function and his order
[19:09] and when he uses the phrase to make
[19:11] reconciliation for the sins of the
[19:13] people he's alluding specifically to
[19:15] leviticus 16 at least in one place you
[19:17] can go and read where he's alluding to
[19:19] that particular office of the high
[19:22] priest who would make this offering on
[19:24] the day of atonement and the word that
[19:26] would be used for hebrew is reconciling
[19:29] the sins of israel so when he uses
[19:31] refers to christ as a high priest
[19:34] reconciling our sin the sins of the
[19:36] people then that meant something to
[19:38] hebrew he said okay we know that this
[19:41] high priest went into the temple and
[19:43] made this sacrifice to reconcile israel
[19:46] with god and he said now this is the
[19:47] role in the office that christ has he is
[19:50] a faithful and merciful high priest to
[19:52] make reconciliation
[19:54] just as this day of atonement year after
[19:56] year represented for the hebrews now
[19:58] he's saying this has been an offering
[20:00] now that christ has made for us
[20:02] so he continues in hebrews chapter 3
[20:04] verse 1.
[20:05] wherefore holy brethren partakers of the
[20:08] heavenly calling
[20:09] and it's think of that how he's bringing
[20:12] us into this brotherhood and a heavenly
[20:15] calling
[20:17] considered the apostle and high priest
[20:19] of our profession christ jesus and he
[20:22] and from here on he just really in
[20:23] earnest begins to compare old new old
[20:26] new old new old temple new temple old
[20:28] sanctuary new sanctuary because the
[20:30] objection of the hebrew could be like
[20:32] well where's our priest then
[20:34] where's our sanctuary
[20:36] where's the sacrifice where's all the
[20:38] elements of our worship like god
[20:40] established this
[20:42] why would god abandon this
[20:44] and paul is saying oh no he didn't
[20:46] abandon it he perfected it
[20:49] and he's saying oh you believe in a
[20:50] tabernacle here's one you believe in a
[20:52] sanctuary here's one you believe in a
[20:53] high priest here's one and so he's
[20:55] basically showing him everything you
[20:57] believed in seed form in shadow form is
[20:59] now in substance form
[21:00] and and he's just saying now consider
[21:02] then the apostle and high priest of our
[21:04] profession christ jesus
[21:07] so christ jesus the righteous
[21:11] is our advocate is our perpetuation
[21:14] it's a there's such great depth to this
[21:16] ministry the apostle and high priest he
[21:19] says of our profession
[21:21] now i'm being very deliberate in coming
[21:23] to this particular instance because when
[21:25] we think of an advocate oh if i confess
[21:27] my sins then we have an advocate and if
[21:29] i confess my sins i have an advocacy i'm
[21:31] so sorry i didn't mean to do that okay
[21:32] i'll go tell god you're sorry you didn't
[21:34] mean to do that
[21:35] and i'm wanting us to understand this
[21:36] completely differently
[21:38] and but not change anything that we
[21:40] already believe
[21:41] not changing any role that he already
[21:43] fulfills not changing any revelation
[21:44] that we already have this is not
[21:46] changing anything
[21:48] and so and maybe for some it may change
[21:50] it but in terms of the truths that we
[21:51] receive this is not changing or adding
[21:53] two
[21:54] and i don't know if that makes you
[21:55] nervous like well if he has to give the
[21:57] disclaimer where in the world is he
[21:58] going
[21:59] so
[22:00] strike that rewind do whatever we need
[22:02] to do strike it from the record brother
[22:03] wes could you go back and strike that
[22:05] redact that read that back to me again
[22:08] what i mean is don't get nervous this is
[22:11] what we all believe
[22:13] but to some of us it's just good verses
[22:15] in the bible
[22:17] and maybe we just accepted oh yeah he
[22:19] died for my sins
[22:20] oh yeah he's my advocate no it's so much
[22:22] more beautiful than just oh yeah
[22:24] so much more to this the apostle and
[22:26] high priest of our profession so this
[22:28] profession this confession he is the
[22:30] high priest of our confession in our
[22:32] profession and romans chapter 10 verses
[22:35] 9 and 10 notice this and this is very
[22:37] this is the areas where i want us to
[22:38] unders acknowledge this is what we
[22:40] believe this is what we understand that
[22:42] if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the
[22:44] lord jesus and shalt believe in thine
[22:46] heart that god hath raised him from the
[22:48] dead thou shalt be saved so
[22:50] we can make this profession this
[22:52] confession with our mouth because we
[22:54] have a believing heart we believe first
[22:55] in the heart in other words if you say
[22:57] something in your mouth but don't
[22:58] believe it from your heart it doesn't
[23:00] engage romans 10.
[23:02] and so you have to confess with your
[23:04] mouth and you can keep reading how can
[23:06] you believe on him whom you have not
[23:07] heard so there's a beautiful beautiful
[23:10] drama that unfolds in this that god has
[23:11] got to send somebody who preaches the
[23:14] word of god that you hear and in hearing
[23:16] you believe on him and believing you
[23:17] make confession and you're saved so he
[23:19] says if you confess with your mouth and
[23:21] believe from your heart you shall be
[23:24] thou shalt be saved verse 10 for with
[23:26] the heart man believeth unto
[23:27] righteousness and with the mouth
[23:29] confession is made unto salvation
[23:32] so this is the necessary repentance unto
[23:35] the new birth
[23:36] that when you hear the word of god and
[23:38] you believe the word of god and you make
[23:40] a confession that it it leads one to
[23:43] repentance and in repenting one is
[23:45] baptized in the name of jesus christ and
[23:47] the the seal of your faith the seal of
[23:49] your believing
[23:50] is the new birth is the baptism of the
[23:52] holy ghost and so these are things that
[23:54] are necessary to have eternal life
[23:57] the repentance the sorrow for sin and
[24:00] the confession he says if thou shalt
[24:02] confess with thy mouth and believe from
[24:04] my heart then you enter into
[24:06] relationship with god as a forgiven
[24:08] sinner
[24:09] saints are made from sinners right from
[24:11] losers not from winners and so you
[24:13] recognize yourself a sinner you confess
[24:15] your sins now you're made a christian
[24:17] now you're made alive in jesus christ
[24:18] that that's impossible without the
[24:20] atonement
[24:21] that's impossible without the high
[24:23] priest of your profession
[24:25] now john writes this and we read it a
[24:27] couple sundays ago first john 1 9 if we
[24:29] confess our sins
[24:31] he is faithful and just to forgive us
[24:33] our sins and to cleanse us from all
[24:35] unrighteousness
[24:37] and he says this in the context that
[24:38] somebody says well i have no sin he says
[24:40] anybody who says he has not sinned is a
[24:42] liar
[24:44] and makes god a liar
[24:46] because they're saying well i don't need
[24:47] a perpetuation i don't need sacrifice
[24:50] what do i need an atonement for and so
[24:52] he's saying if we confess our sins he's
[24:54] faithful and just to forgive us of our
[24:56] sins and to cleanse us from all
[24:57] unrighteousness this is the image of the
[25:00] atonement
[25:02] he's drawing from the image of the
[25:03] atonement in the old testament the very
[25:05] language that's being used here
[25:07] confessing and being cleansed from
[25:09] unrighteousness and if we confess our
[25:11] sins he will cleanse us from all
[25:12] unrighteousness he's using a language
[25:14] that was associated with the atonement
[25:17] in the old testament
[25:18] and so now
[25:21] the image of the new in the new
[25:22] testament if we just say the new
[25:23] testament terms of the books that we're
[25:25] reading in the new testament
[25:27] he's saying that this is a sacrifice
[25:29] that's offered once for all for
[25:31] salvation
[25:33] so when we are sinners and we confess
[25:34] our sins and we repent and we are
[25:37] baptized with the seal of god the
[25:38] baptism of the holy ghost then we are
[25:40] saved once and for all can't be sealed
[25:42] and unsealed right
[25:44] so in in looking at this we understand
[25:47] the role of christ
[25:49] as the sacrifice
[25:51] for salvation of the elect
[25:54] we we we can never we can never lose
[25:57] sight of that there's it's impossible
[25:59] for you to go so deep into the
[26:00] revelation of the seven thunders to
[26:02] where somehow the sacrifice of christ
[26:04] means nothing anymore like well aren't
[26:05] we beyond that no no no no no no no
[26:07] we're built on this this is the
[26:09] foundation of it this is what we believe
[26:11] and so we and i'm given i'm
[26:13] acknowledging that we understand the
[26:15] role of jesus christ as the atonement
[26:18] and the sacrifice for our salvation
[26:21] and that in order to be saved there is
[26:23] this acknowledgement and recognition of
[26:25] christ as the atonement for our sins
[26:28] now notice how
[26:30] paul begins to continue this in hebrews
[26:32] chapter 4
[26:33] verses 14 to 16. see and then that we
[26:36] have a great high priest that is passed
[26:38] into the heavens
[26:39] jesus says the son of god let us hold
[26:42] fast our profession he's the apostle and
[26:44] high priest of our profession now he's
[26:46] saying this great high priest notice
[26:48] where he is now that is passed into the
[26:50] heavens jesus the son of god let us hold
[26:53] fast our profession
[26:56] this is what upholds us now notice what
[26:58] this ministry is and let me just say it
[27:00] at the outset his purpose is to
[27:03] strengthen us his purpose is to
[27:04] encourage us
[27:07] this is not a confessional booth
[27:08] relationship
[27:10] or if i could just make it to the the
[27:12] mass if i could just make it to the
[27:14] church and make my confession and go in
[27:15] and it's been the father these are my
[27:17] sins it's been six weeks since my last
[27:18] confession
[27:20] this is not how that it works and so he
[27:22] said let us hold fast our profession
[27:24] now to encourage us in our holding fast
[27:27] he says for we have not a high priest
[27:29] which cannot be touched with the feeling
[27:31] of our infirmities
[27:32] like this is the high priest that we
[27:34] have
[27:35] but was in all points tempted like as we
[27:37] are yet without sin
[27:39] let us therefore come boldly unto the
[27:42] throne of grace that we may obtain mercy
[27:45] and find grace to help in time of need
[27:48] so we have this profession holding fast
[27:51] our profession and since we made
[27:52] confession with our mouth and belief
[27:54] from our heart we are saved and because
[27:56] we made confession we are cleansed from
[27:58] all unrighteousness now in order for our
[28:00] testimony to be made secure we have a
[28:03] high priest who has got entered into
[28:06] heaven who is not just like i don't know
[28:08] what they're going through
[28:10] i mean beats me i don't know what
[28:11] they're talking about he can be touched
[28:13] with the feeling of our infirmities so
[28:15] he says because of that because of this
[28:17] we can be honest and come before the
[28:18] throne of grace to obtain mercy find
[28:21] grace to help so it's access to mercy
[28:24] we who have been is sealed by the
[28:26] baptist holy ghost we have access to
[28:27] mercy we have access to grace
[28:31] so this is this is the image
[28:34] that i that i see being painted by paul
[28:36] in these scriptures
[28:38] he's now a high priest
[28:40] by interceding against any accusation
[28:44] he's now a high priest and brother
[28:45] branham even makes reference to that how
[28:47] we have this accuser and he's always
[28:48] accusing but there the blood's still
[28:49] there and the blood's still there and
[28:51] the world accusing us
[28:53] he is the high priest now let's think
[28:54] about it in this dimension he's the ia
[28:56] high priest by interceding against our
[28:59] accusing heart
[29:00] our natural minds our weaknesses our
[29:02] difficulties our infirmities our
[29:04] doubtings our disputings and everything
[29:06] else that would come against us and
[29:07] fight against us and so he's there as a
[29:09] high priest interceding within us
[29:12] assuring us of our forgiveness
[29:15] now i know we have we have christians
[29:17] here that are just
[29:18] just such perfect christians that they
[29:20] they never have any doubts at all
[29:23] and as a matter of fact they felt that
[29:24] the baptismal holy ghost was just the
[29:25] vindication
[29:26] that they deserved
[29:28] for all the wonderful things they
[29:29] believed and all the wonderful things
[29:30] they had done for all the years but we
[29:33] we many of us and we're acknowledging
[29:35] you today but for most of us
[29:38] we're so glad to have one on the inside
[29:40] that reminds us over and over again that
[29:43] your sins and iniquities will remember
[29:45] no more
[29:48] and so he's a high priest within us
[29:51] not by reapplying the blood every time
[29:53] and not by making another sacrifice
[29:56] and so then paul wants to substantiate
[29:58] that it's not the old covenant it's a
[30:00] new covenant
[30:02] so these are the images he begins to
[30:04] paint in this new covenant we have a new
[30:06] covenant
[30:07] and he says in hebrews chapter 7 verse
[30:09] 22
[30:10] by so much was jesus made a surety of a
[30:14] better testament and what i want to look
[30:15] at is how jesus was made a surety of a
[30:19] better testament
[30:21] and if it feels like maybe we're just
[30:22] kind of on a journey right now i am i'm
[30:24] just kind of walking you through some of
[30:25] these things
[30:27] jesus was made a surety surety means a
[30:29] sponsor
[30:30] a surety means it's under good security
[30:32] he was made a surety a guarantee if he's
[30:34] made a surety it means he's a bondsman
[30:37] so when it says that jesus was made a
[30:39] surety of a better testament he is the
[30:42] full assurance of the covenant
[30:45] jesus christ became a surety jesus
[30:47] christ became a pledge for all the elect
[30:50] and we realized he says because he was
[30:52] made a pledge he he brings newness of
[30:54] life and not only through this
[30:57] let me say it this way not only was he
[30:59] the atonement forever consecrating us
[31:01] this entrance into this new covenant but
[31:04] now he's not only the access to it he's
[31:07] the full assurance of it
[31:10] so it's not just well he died for our
[31:12] sins so you have this access to grace so
[31:15] that we feel like well i'll take
[31:16] advantage of that and then there's all
[31:17] sorts of clauses that say well if you
[31:19] mess up though you lose your right to it
[31:21] kind of like our insurance policies like
[31:23] oh that would be great i'd love to
[31:24] insure my home against floods and then
[31:26] you read the fine print and it says as
[31:28] long as it's not water like well what
[31:30] kind of flood was it going to be
[31:32] and so that's not the kind of so he's
[31:34] basically saying look no i guarantee it
[31:36] not only are your sins forgiven but i am
[31:39] the guarantee and the pledge that they
[31:42] can never be brought up again i'm the
[31:44] barrier i'm the voice i'm the security
[31:46] i'm the pledge that it would that i will
[31:49] fulfill my promise so not only does he
[31:51] give us access to newness of life he's
[31:53] the sureness of it the security of it
[31:55] and the guarantee of it forever
[31:58] giving us and granting it to us
[32:00] so our advocate is the security
[32:04] of the fulfillment of the new covenant
[32:07] as he says he has made a surety of a
[32:08] better testament our advocate is the
[32:10] security of the fulfillment of a better
[32:12] covenant
[32:13] a better promise that was made to us
[32:16] so it's not just i would say a warranty
[32:18] but it's the guarantee
[32:21] it's an absolute guarantee and he and as
[32:23] we mentioned before how
[32:25] that when when he redeemed us and he got
[32:26] us out of the pawn shop he didn't ask
[32:28] for a receipt
[32:30] he didn't need a proof of purge just
[32:31] like he gave that to us so that we would
[32:33] know who our owner is
[32:34] but he knows who he knows who his his
[32:36] are he knows exactly who belongs to him
[32:40] and so
[32:41] in this he's given us this guarantee
[32:45] and the guarantee is absolute and it's
[32:48] not even a replacement guarantee
[32:50] he's saying i guarantee it'll never wear
[32:52] out
[32:54] i guarantee it'll never wane it'll never
[32:56] lose its power it'll never lose its
[32:59] effectiveness it'll never run out it'll
[33:01] never be void it can never be canceled
[33:04] i'm giving you an eternal guarantee that
[33:06] if you have entered into fellowship with
[33:08] christ through the seal of god then it
[33:10] i'm guarantee permanent forever
[33:15] and jesus christ then is this he is the
[33:17] guarantee
[33:19] so christ our advocate becomes the
[33:21] assurance of our liberty in christ he is
[33:23] our assurance of peace he is our
[33:25] assurance of happiness he is our
[33:26] assurance of joy he is our security of
[33:29] everlasting peace this is what he is to
[33:31] us
[33:33] this is what it ought to mean to us when
[33:34] we say that we have received him that he
[33:37] indwells inside of us that he's going to
[33:39] give us another comforter when you have
[33:41] that comforter that's your guarantee of
[33:43] every promise in the book
[33:47] and so he is made assured you have a
[33:49] better testament
[33:51] now there's some translations and
[33:52] there's even some that commentators that
[33:55] say that the word surety
[33:57] could just as easily be replaced with
[33:59] mediator he's made a mediator
[34:02] and so we know that jesus christ is a
[34:04] mediator and i want to look at this in
[34:05] the scripture
[34:06] our advocate is our mediator mediator
[34:09] means one who comes between two parties
[34:12] to remove any differences
[34:15] so where we have a mediator it's like
[34:17] one has a claim another one has a claim
[34:18] that's contrary they're both asking for
[34:21] something or want something that's
[34:22] different and so a mediator comes in and
[34:25] works out a resolution or a compromise
[34:27] and this is just in the natural sense
[34:29] that takes two parties who have a
[34:30] difference and then the mediator removes
[34:32] any differences
[34:34] brings them together
[34:36] and to some mutual agreement that's what
[34:38] we would think of a mediator well i've
[34:40] got to go to mediation this is what we
[34:42] would see the role of a mediator in
[34:43] natural parlance so in the scripture a
[34:46] meteor is one who intervenes to make
[34:48] peace
[34:49] a mediator is one who intervenes to
[34:51] restore a relationship that's been
[34:53] broken
[34:54] or mediators one that comes and confirms
[34:56] a promise that's been made between two
[34:58] parties
[34:59] so he's one that confirms a covenant and
[35:01] a mediator is when it says this is the
[35:03] promise you made this is the promise
[35:04] they agreed to and it's made firm and
[35:06] it's made established and it brings the
[35:08] parties back together in a mutual
[35:09] understanding
[35:11] and so in the book of job in chapter 9
[35:13] verses 32 to 33 these are just some
[35:15] scriptural images of the role that
[35:17] christ plays
[35:18] talk about god how god is not a man for
[35:20] he is not a man as i am that i should
[35:22] answer him
[35:24] and we should come together in judgment
[35:26] so job just making these these
[35:28] observations in jobs are so profound to
[35:31] say well
[35:33] god is not like me
[35:35] and how can i and god how can he answer
[35:38] my pleading
[35:39] and you're going to get serve a subpoena
[35:41] on god
[35:42] i'm calling you to testify and give
[35:44] witness or you're we this is
[35:46] court-ordered mediation
[35:47] god you get down here in the court of
[35:49] human opinion and we're going to sit
[35:51] down and wrestle this out
[35:54] and he's acknowledging well that just
[35:55] seems ridiculous that that i as a man
[35:57] i'm going to be able to subpoena god or
[35:58] force him to mediation and to come to
[36:00] agreement and come to some accord
[36:02] because he says verse 33 neither is
[36:04] there any days man that on the day the
[36:06] day of judgment the day of the day of
[36:08] reckoning that any days man betwixt us
[36:11] there's not any days man between us
[36:13] betwixt us that might lay his hand upon
[36:15] us both
[36:16] beautiful image
[36:18] there's here's god here's man and he's
[36:20] saying i have no right to tell god can
[36:23] you come to the bargaining table so that
[36:25] we can work this out and he said then
[36:27] there's and there's nobody that can come
[36:29] and intervene
[36:30] and take me as this lowly finite
[36:32] creature and this infinite god and put
[36:35] his hands on us both and bring us
[36:37] together
[36:39] connect the two of us in a day of
[36:40] disagreement where is the one that can
[36:42] join us together oh thank god through
[36:45] jesus christ he has he became our days
[36:49] man between this finite sinful creature
[36:52] and this perfect sinless god christ came
[36:54] as the daysmen between sinful man and a
[36:57] sinless god and laid his hands on us
[37:00] both and brought us together in judgment
[37:02] and removed our differences
[37:06] and so a days man between us paul says
[37:09] in galatians 3 20. now a mediator is not
[37:11] a mediator of one but god is one
[37:14] mediator coming from mesos which means
[37:16] in between a meteor is in between
[37:18] so god is one
[37:20] so god you know god doesn't you don't
[37:23] have a mediator within god and dividing
[37:25] god he said in order for there to be a
[37:27] mediator
[37:28] there has to be one that comes between
[37:30] so god
[37:32] is one so this mediator then is betwixt
[37:34] god and the people
[37:37] so paul amplifies it first timothy
[37:39] chapter two verses five to six for there
[37:41] is one god and one mediator between god
[37:44] and men
[37:45] the man christ jesus
[37:48] who gave himself a ransom for all to be
[37:50] testified in due time once again he gave
[37:53] himself a ransom
[37:56] he paid the price
[37:57] he's given as a payment he's given as
[38:00] the reconciliation the price of his
[38:02] blood is what satisfied and now having
[38:05] paid the price and now that he's our
[38:07] atonement as the one who atoned he
[38:10] stands there as a mediator and and this
[38:13] is what paul is saying here
[38:15] nobody has access to god except through
[38:17] jesus christ
[38:19] so there's only one way of salvation
[38:24] free to free to amen today
[38:27] and i'm not saying it because i just
[38:28] realized it this weekend if that puts
[38:30] you at ease saying
[38:31] thank god brother aaron's finally coming
[38:32] to recognize there's only one name under
[38:34] heaven whereby men can be saved
[38:35] and that's great we can all maybe
[38:37] rejoice in that but no we're just we're
[38:38] stating the obvious but to recognize
[38:41] what's being said here
[38:43] because there's a way scriptures can be
[38:44] twisted and maybe watered down and
[38:47] confused there's a there's one god and
[38:50] there's one mediated between god and men
[38:52] that is the man christ jesus only one
[38:55] became the days man
[38:57] only one became the sacrifice
[39:00] only one bridge the gap
[39:03] oh
[39:04] it relieves us the burden of thinking
[39:07] that we've somehow
[39:08] have to sacrifice in order to make a way
[39:11] for man to be saved no the price has
[39:13] been paid we just we can become the
[39:15] testifiers and the witnesses and the
[39:17] bear of that life
[39:19] so there has been one sacrifice for all
[39:22] and he in his sacrifice became the media
[39:24] between god and men so there's only one
[39:26] way to be brought together with god and
[39:28] judgment and that's through the ransom
[39:30] and through the price that was paid
[39:32] through jesus christ one mediator
[39:34] between god and man
[39:35] christ jesus
[39:37] we do not have the ability to make a
[39:39] side deal with god and bypass the
[39:42] agreement that was made in christ
[39:46] and it says this about this one mediator
[39:48] in hebrews chapter 8 verse 6. so we kind
[39:50] of skipping through
[39:52] hebrews the book of hebrews to see these
[39:54] different points but now have he
[39:56] obtained a more excellent ministry not
[39:58] just this ministry of these priests who
[39:59] die and one has to follow after him but
[40:02] now we have a priest who has made
[40:04] after after the power of an endless life
[40:07] now he hath obtained a better a more
[40:09] excellent ministry by how much also
[40:12] he is the mediator of a better covenant
[40:14] he has made a surety of a better
[40:16] testament next chapter the media of a
[40:18] better covenant which was established
[40:20] upon better promises oh this life is
[40:22] just better
[40:24] it's just better
[40:27] and we ought to believe that with all
[40:28] our hearts that what we have received is
[40:30] what was better
[40:32] that this is better than religion this
[40:34] is better than theology this is better
[40:36] than mythology this is better than uh
[40:38] good ways to live and how to be decent
[40:40] this is better this is better this is
[40:42] better
[40:44] there's no religion out there there's no
[40:46] discipline there's no approach to life
[40:49] that's better than the christian one
[40:51] that there's there's there's no better
[40:53] way to live than the one that's laid out
[40:54] in the word of god you say oh well this
[40:56] one is kind there's no more greater
[40:58] kindness than that found in the
[40:59] scripture oh well this one's forgiving
[41:01] there's no greater forgiveness than that
[41:02] which is found in the scripture oh
[41:04] there's there's peace in this there's no
[41:05] greater peace than this listen the
[41:07] accord the harmony the respect the
[41:09] integrity the lack of malice the lack of
[41:11] jealousy living decently and treating
[41:13] others right there's no better way to do
[41:16] that than in the word that's been
[41:17] provided
[41:19] especially in the word that's been
[41:20] restored to us in this hour this is the
[41:22] way to live
[41:24] oh what about what about judaism this is
[41:27] better what about hinduism this is
[41:29] better what about just living a decent
[41:31] life and doing good unto all men this is
[41:33] better
[41:35] because this teaches us how to do it
[41:37] and he's a mediator of a better covenant
[41:41] these were heavy words for the hebrews
[41:44] but it was better and he's a mediator of
[41:46] a better covenant established on better
[41:48] promises
[41:49] hebrews chapter 9 verses 14 to 15
[41:52] how much more shout out the blood of
[41:54] bulls and goats and a blood of these
[41:56] sacrifices which were shadows and types
[41:58] he's saying how much more shall the
[41:59] blood of christ
[42:02] who through the eternal spirit offered
[42:04] himself without spot to god now remember
[42:06] how much weight this language would have
[42:09] with the hebrew
[42:11] how much more shall the blood of christ
[42:13] purge your conscience
[42:16] from dead works to serve the living god
[42:20] this is the promise of the blood
[42:23] this is the promise of the baptism the
[42:24] holy ghost to purge your conscience from
[42:27] dead works to serve the living god
[42:30] and because
[42:31] by his sacrifice in us receiving his
[42:34] life
[42:36] we are to be purged from
[42:38] dead works and the thought of and the
[42:40] desire
[42:41] so much in that and i think we even
[42:43] looked at that some in this
[42:44] what we're preaching on pure joy he says
[42:47] for this cause
[42:48] he is the mediator of the new testament
[42:52] that by means of death for the
[42:53] redemption of the transgressions that
[42:55] were under the first testament they
[42:56] which are called might receive the
[42:59] promise of eternal inheritance
[43:02] this is it's made secure
[43:05] it's made firm any any
[43:07] any activity you had under your old
[43:09] covenant which somehow guaranteed the
[43:12] offer that his sins have been atoned for
[43:14] for that year we have something better
[43:17] we have a mediator this new testament
[43:19] this new covenant for the redemption of
[43:21] transgressions that were under the first
[43:22] whatever was atoned from the first we
[43:24] have a meteor of this for so that they
[43:26] which are called might receive the
[43:28] promise of what an eternal inheritance
[43:33] so he wants us to be assured of so we
[43:36] have a mediator who's there to
[43:38] permanently to always and to continually
[43:41] assure us that this is an eternal
[43:43] promise
[43:45] that god didn't say here you go brother
[43:47] laura you can have it and then walk away
[43:48] but give that back i can't believe you
[43:50] did that
[43:52] right which is something that us i think
[43:53] sometimes maybe as parents what we do is
[43:55] we're giving our kids things just so
[43:57] that we can have the pleasure of taking
[43:58] them away
[43:59] when they prove that they they haven't
[44:01] earned it
[44:02] and maybe we just need to be a little
[44:03] bit more proactive
[44:05] and think through it all right i'm
[44:07] looking in the mirror this morning
[44:09] while we still have morning
[44:11] that's something we're always we're
[44:12] snatching things away we give it take it
[44:13] away give it take it away god doesn't do
[44:15] that
[44:17] god doesn't take it away it's a promise
[44:19] of eternal inheritance
[44:21] so let's drop back to hebrews chapter 7
[44:22] when we read from verse 22 to verse 28.
[44:25] so you see this full picture that he's
[44:26] drawing here
[44:28] how jesus was made of surety by so much
[44:30] was jesus made a surety of a better
[44:32] testament now let's just try to follow
[44:34] this as we read
[44:35] and let it uh
[44:37] quick and some of these other things
[44:38] we've been reading and they truly were
[44:40] many there were truly
[44:42] and they truly were many priests because
[44:44] they were not suffered to continue by
[44:46] reason to death so you had one you had
[44:48] another one you had another one you had
[44:49] another one but this man
[44:52] the man christ jesus
[44:54] the one mediator between god and man
[44:57] because he continueth forever
[44:59] this is beautiful
[45:01] half an unchangeable priesthood
[45:04] wherefore he is able to save them to the
[45:07] uttermost
[45:09] that come unto god by him
[45:12] he is able to say them to the uttermost
[45:14] that come unto god by him we can only
[45:16] come to god by him and he's able to save
[45:19] us completely totally fully to the
[45:20] uttermost
[45:22] seeing he ever liveth to make it to make
[45:25] intercession for them
[45:26] he continues to live
[45:28] he continually intercedes for such a
[45:31] high priest became us who is holy
[45:33] harmless undefiled separate from sinners
[45:36] made higher than the heavens who needeth
[45:38] not daily as though high priests offer
[45:40] up sacrifice first for his own sins and
[45:42] then for the peoples
[45:44] for he for this he did once when he
[45:47] offered up himself
[45:51] looking at the old way looking at the
[45:53] new way the old priest would actually
[45:54] have to offer up a sacrifice for himself
[45:58] and and have to be purged and purified
[46:01] and sanctified consecrated before these
[46:02] things should even happen but he says
[46:04] christ he did it once when he offered up
[46:06] himself he reconciled our sins
[46:09] he our sins were atoned for so he said
[46:12] now he as the sacrifice is the high
[46:14] priest and he's there ever living
[46:16] unchangeable
[46:18] harmless undefiled
[46:20] made higher than the heavens to make
[46:21] intercession for us verse 20 for the law
[46:24] maketh men high priests which have
[46:25] infirmity but the word of the oath which
[46:27] was since the law maketh the son who is
[46:30] consecrated forevermore
[46:34] notice how paul is comparing old
[46:36] covenant old promise old worship old
[46:39] offering old high priest old tabernacle
[46:42] old atonement mercy seat and new
[46:46] new high priest new tabernacle new
[46:48] throne new altar all these things he's
[46:50] pointing out he's wanting to compare and
[46:52] contrast the old covenant with the new
[46:54] covenant the old one was only revived by
[46:56] the law
[46:57] because there was no way for a high
[46:58] priest to live forever so they had to
[47:00] have a law that had an order of
[47:01] secession with this one it's a power of
[47:04] an endless life so you don't need a law
[47:05] to replace the high priest he ever
[47:06] liveth
[47:08] and he ever lives to make intercession
[47:10] for us
[47:12] so with the few moments that we have
[47:14] left
[47:16] here
[47:18] i want to expand this now this is really
[47:20] just foundational to this point but i
[47:22] feel like very quickly we can just come
[47:24] to this uh climactic conclusion that i
[47:27] have today
[47:28] i want to expand the image that paul is
[47:30] creating
[47:32] of a high priest or amplify this picture
[47:35] that paul is putting together of our
[47:37] advocate
[47:39] so
[47:40] let me first acknowledge again we grasp
[47:43] the concept and i trust that you
[47:44] understand this and i'm looking at
[47:45] people who are beneficiaries of this and
[47:48] understand this very deeply
[47:49] we grasp the concept of the bloody lamb
[47:52] before the father for the forgiveness of
[47:54] our sins that we have this image and
[47:58] oftentimes have to be very careful not
[48:00] to try to make things too literal
[48:03] because even in using a bloody lamb
[48:05] we're using figurative speech about
[48:07] jesus christ because he's literally not
[48:08] a lamb
[48:10] this was a this was he became a man for
[48:12] our sake so we have this image of christ
[48:14] the perpetuation the sacrifice of bloody
[48:16] lamb that his role in shedding his blood
[48:19] and this the offering of his body we
[48:21] have him in this image correctly this
[48:23] image of him playing this role for the
[48:25] forgiveness of our sins before the
[48:27] father
[48:30] now let's let's just zoom out a little
[48:32] bit
[48:33] or maybe kind of step around this
[48:35] picture that paul is painting
[48:37] and look around a little bit because
[48:38] sometimes we can get so focused in on
[48:40] this particular aspect
[48:41] that i i just want to hopefully kind of
[48:43] take a step back to catch more of the
[48:45] scene that paul is alluding to in the
[48:47] book of hebrews
[48:49] and especially as we read here as we're
[48:51] reading in chapter 9 he's describing all
[48:54] these elements of the worldly tabernacle
[48:56] and you have the sanctuary and then you
[48:58] have the holy of holies and within there
[49:00] you have the ark of the covenant and
[49:02] inside the ark of the covenant was
[49:04] aaron's law that he had written or the
[49:06] moses law that he had written in and all
[49:08] these different elements he's trying to
[49:09] describe this but in doing so he's
[49:12] painting a picture for us to understand
[49:15] what we have
[49:17] and in leviticus chapter 16
[49:19] all right we're not going to read it but
[49:21] make reference to it the high priest
[49:23] entered into the holy of holies
[49:25] sprinkled blood upon the mercy seat
[49:28] and the mercy seat was the lid
[49:30] or or the covering of the ark of the
[49:33] covenant
[49:35] so it's called the ark of the covenant
[49:36] the ark of god's promise and it had the
[49:38] manna which symbolized the the his
[49:40] promise that he made to them in the
[49:41] wilderness and the manna never ran out
[49:43] it had the the rod that of aaron that
[49:45] budded that vindicated uh who the
[49:48] ministry was and he had the i had the
[49:50] law the word that moses wrote
[49:53] it's all it's all being placed in there
[49:55] he it's all within the ark of the
[49:57] covenant and it's between cherubims and
[49:59] so here these cherubims are
[50:02] everything's inlaid with gold and
[50:03] overlaid with gold and you have this
[50:05] seat and the high priest would come in
[50:06] and take the blood of this this these
[50:08] offerings and he would sprinkle it upon
[50:11] the lid the covering and because he was
[50:13] doing upon the covering they called it a
[50:15] mercy seat
[50:17] now i know when we say mercy seat we're
[50:18] picturing a literal chair in heaven
[50:21] it says this seat reserved for mercy
[50:23] and like so someone has to be sitting
[50:25] there right in order for the seat to be
[50:27] occupied but these are just it's called
[50:29] a mercy seat because it was a place
[50:32] where atonement was made
[50:34] and where there was witness given that
[50:36] sins had been atoned for
[50:39] and now notice paul is pointing to this
[50:42] very distinct image in their minds
[50:44] deuteronomy chapter 31 verses 24 to 26
[50:47] and it came to pass when moses had made
[50:49] an end of writing the words of this law
[50:51] in a book so now moses writes the
[50:53] message the message has been given it's
[50:55] the word has come forth until they were
[50:57] finished so it's complete it's good that
[50:59] moses commanded the priests the levites
[51:02] which bear the ark of the covenant of
[51:03] the lord that was their responsibility
[51:05] you just couldn't put on any any
[51:06] person's shoulders it had to be carried
[51:08] by these levites which bear the ark of
[51:10] the covenant lord saying take this book
[51:12] of the law
[51:14] and put it in the side or inside the
[51:18] of the ark of the covenant of the lord
[51:20] your god so the ark of the covenant of
[51:22] the lord your god the that which held
[51:25] the the the evidence and the uh and the
[51:28] things pertaining to the promises the
[51:30] ark of god's promise the ark of god's
[51:32] covenant the lord your god that it may
[51:34] be there notice for a witness against
[51:37] thee
[51:38] now we could continue to read it because
[51:40] he says because look you guys are going
[51:41] to forget this and you can go back to
[51:43] this and you need to be reminded of all
[51:45] the things you've forsaken
[51:46] so
[51:47] i'm so glad we've got the mirror of this
[51:50] but he says he put it inside the ark of
[51:52] the covenant that it may be there so the
[51:54] words had to be there under the old
[51:57] covenant as a witness against them
[52:01] and this is all the image that they saw
[52:04] in the shadow in the worldly tabernacle
[52:07] but so then think of the beautiful
[52:08] picture that paul is painting to
[52:11] contrast the old image
[52:14] because he says in hebrews 12 24 and to
[52:17] jesus the mediator of the new covenant
[52:20] and to the blood of sprinkling
[52:22] that speaketh better things than that of
[52:25] abel
[52:26] it's better promises a better covenant
[52:29] the ark of the covenant held the law
[52:32] that would witness against them
[52:35] but now he's drawing all the same images
[52:38] up again and he's painting a picture but
[52:41] now as he paints it it's a mirror image
[52:43] of what there was there before but that
[52:45] being worldly this one is heavenly that
[52:48] one being temporary this one is
[52:49] permanent that one having limits this
[52:51] one is limitless that one being
[52:54] being atoned for and being mediated and
[52:56] being conducted by sinful men this is
[52:59] what told for by the sinless son of god
[53:02] and mediated by jesus christ the
[53:04] righteous not only the atonement but now
[53:08] the advocate of it
[53:12] the media of a new covenant
[53:14] to the blood of the sprinkling it's the
[53:16] same images now that you see okay in
[53:19] behind badger skin in the holy of holies
[53:22] upon this ark of the covenant of the
[53:23] lord the god which in it contains the
[53:25] word of god when it had been finished
[53:27] it's in there and now all these
[53:29] different elements are there and now the
[53:30] high priest is going to sprinkle blood
[53:32] upon the covering of that and in doing
[53:34] so it becomes a place where god
[53:36] indicates mercy
[53:41] and now paul is using the same image
[53:43] for us
[53:46] who's
[53:47] has never seen a high priest after the
[53:49] image of aaron
[53:51] with bells on his garments
[53:54] walking in and everyone is gathered
[53:56] around the outside of the tabernacle and
[53:59] as it's described in the scripture you
[54:00] have the different tribes that were
[54:01] there to guard even the entry into the
[54:03] sanctuary and all these different courts
[54:05] to the time and everyone's outside
[54:06] wondering
[54:08] is god going to receive it
[54:10] it's going to be a cloud appear upon the
[54:12] mercy seat
[54:13] and when that cloud when he appears and
[54:15] the cloud revealing his
[54:18] himself that he's vindicated it that
[54:20] he's confirmed it that it's been
[54:22] accepted everyone's waiting for it to
[54:24] happen
[54:24] but now he does it in a he's
[54:27] he's saying this is better hebrews 10 16
[54:30] this is the covenant remember that you
[54:32] have the holy ghost
[54:34] and i realize now i should maybe
[54:35] shouldn't have cut this so short but
[54:37] in this particular reading he says he's
[54:38] given us the holy ghost and the holy
[54:40] ghost is given to us as a witness and
[54:42] what is the holy ghost witness of this
[54:44] is the covenant that i will make with
[54:45] them after those days saith the lord i
[54:48] will put my laws into their hearts and
[54:50] in their minds will i write them
[54:53] do you realize the image he's just
[54:54] painted at one time when moses was
[54:57] finished with the word they took it and
[54:59] put it inside the ark of the covenant
[55:01] and it was there inside a physical ark
[55:03] of the covenant of the lord to be a
[55:05] witness against them but now he's got a
[55:08] better covenant and a better promise and
[55:10] now it's going to witness and testify
[55:12] that i'm not going to put it in an ark
[55:15] somewhere that one man has access to but
[55:18] i'm going to put it in your very heart
[55:21] and the very next verses and your sins
[55:23] and your iniquities will i remember no
[55:25] more against you so it's not a witness
[55:28] against you it's a witness for you
[55:33] so the tables of the covenant are not
[55:34] stone
[55:36] and it's not a scroll
[55:38] but he's put his word into our hearts
[55:41] verse 19 hebrews 10 having therefore
[55:43] brother in boldness to read to verse 22
[55:45] boldness to enter into the holiest by
[55:47] the blood of jesus
[55:49] we
[55:51] we're not sending somebody else
[55:52] we have boldness to enter into the
[55:54] holiest always this is completely
[55:56] foreign concept to a hebrew what will we
[55:58] do what
[56:00] only one man can do it but no now this
[56:03] is the better promise the better
[56:04] covenant we can enter into the holiest
[56:06] by the blood of jesus now this should
[56:08] change your whole
[56:09] perception and what you've been viewing
[56:11] and what you've been thinking by a new
[56:13] and living way which you have
[56:14] consecrated for us through the veil that
[56:17] is to say his flesh through his flesh
[56:20] he's consecrated a new and living way
[56:22] and having a high priest over the house
[56:24] of god let us draw near with the true
[56:27] heart and full assurance of faith again
[56:29] the image having our hearts sprinkled
[56:31] from an evil conscience and our bodies
[56:33] washed with pure water we now have been
[56:36] consecrated just the same as the high
[56:39] priest would have been in order to have
[56:41] the right to enter behind the veil into
[56:44] the holiest of holies
[56:48] the old covenant and the old sacrifices
[56:51] he's saying have been abolished
[56:53] abolished maybe it's a heavy word for
[56:55] the hebrews
[56:56] finally fulfilled
[57:00] and he says the new covenant is a new
[57:01] way
[57:02] he said by his blood
[57:04] by his blood we can enter into the
[57:06] holiness holiest his presence
[57:09] the place where he said he would commune
[57:12] the place where he would identify
[57:13] himself
[57:14] where the shekinah glory came down
[57:17] and he's saying
[57:18] and though they may have seen this
[57:19] pillar fire come and in this this
[57:22] confirmation be given as a sign that
[57:24] what that a shekinah glory was dwelling
[57:26] there
[57:28] behind that he had he accepted the
[57:29] sacrifice that the sins had been atoned
[57:31] for
[57:32] can you see this picture that's being
[57:33] painted
[57:35] the place of mediation
[57:39] in the old testament was behind badger
[57:40] skins
[57:42] that was under the old covenant
[57:45] and all the worshipers stood on the
[57:46] outside
[57:48] waiting
[57:49] to know whether or not he'd been
[57:50] confirmed so in that they relied upon
[57:53] this priesthood as paul is developing it
[57:55] and they're separated from it
[57:57] but under this new covenant this better
[58:00] covenant with better promises you aren't
[58:02] separated
[58:04] can you see the new picture
[58:06] i'm going to try to wrap this up here so
[58:09] shake yourself wake up
[58:11] the high priest
[58:13] is on the inside
[58:17] we are
[58:18] together with him
[58:21] this is the picture he's trying it all
[58:23] together because he says he has
[58:24] abolished this he has abolished this
[58:26] partition he's made he's through the
[58:28] veil of his flesh
[58:30] he's removed the barrier
[58:33] as to why no man could ever enter that
[58:35] place
[58:36] so because that's what his flesh the
[58:38] sacrifice of his flesh was to remove
[58:41] that hindrance there was he was hid
[58:43] behind badger skins he had to go in the
[58:44] high priest a very particular way a very
[58:46] deliberate way to go in otherwise he'd
[58:48] be dead and he had to offer this
[58:49] atonement he's saying that christ
[58:51] entered in and through the veil of his
[58:53] flesh atoned for it and he became the
[58:55] media of a better covenant and now
[58:57] through that offering we're invited to
[58:59] enter in
[59:01] so then even the very picture that's
[59:03] dramatized here in matthew chapter 15
[59:06] verses 37 and 38 and he's hanging there
[59:08] on the cross the sacrifice the
[59:10] perpetuation jesus cried with a loud
[59:12] voice and gave up the ghost
[59:14] and the veil of the temple was rent and
[59:17] twain from the top to the bottom
[59:19] why because that veil was torn apart
[59:22] saying there's no more shekinah glory
[59:24] there's no more blood that's no longer
[59:26] the meeting place and there on the cross
[59:29] was a new place of mercy it was back on
[59:33] wheels as it were again and they had to
[59:35] move the ark of the covenant the mercy
[59:37] seat was always in motion and now once
[59:40] again it showed that mercy had moved it
[59:42] was hanging on a cross for there for men
[59:45] to see and he tore the veil of the old
[59:48] covenant because the veil of his flesh
[59:50] was breaking away the veil from you
[59:55] the shekinah glory
[59:58] was on a different arc
[1:00:00] this kind of glory that was on the ark
[1:00:02] of the covenant lord god in the old
[1:00:04] covenant was now settled on another
[1:00:05] tabernacle christ
[1:00:09] in hebrews the book of hebrews begins
[1:00:11] with this verse earlier i was wanting to
[1:00:13] go to it and read it i didn't i had
[1:00:15] forgotten it was here who being the
[1:00:17] brightness of his glory and the
[1:00:18] expressed image of his person
[1:00:20] and upholding all things by the word of
[1:00:22] his power when he had by himself purged
[1:00:25] our sins sat down on the right hand of
[1:00:28] the majesty on i
[1:00:32] i i i i want to be very very deliberate
[1:00:35] now
[1:00:36] try to focus with me i know this is a
[1:00:38] lot i know i go fast
[1:00:41] but i think you can handle it
[1:00:42] someone told me one time it's like
[1:00:43] trying to drink water out of a fire
[1:00:44] hydrant but
[1:00:47] maybe you're losing your teeth right now
[1:00:50] but
[1:00:51] he's bringing this to this image now
[1:00:53] that we have painted and christ and his
[1:00:54] role in what he's doing when he had made
[1:00:56] the atonement himself he sat down on the
[1:00:59] right hand of the majesty on high
[1:01:01] and brother bannon makes this statement
[1:01:03] over and over again and i'm kind of
[1:01:04] combining the phrase but i'm using it so
[1:01:06] you can find it especially even after
[1:01:08] the seals is where i was focusing to see
[1:01:10] the continuity through the entire
[1:01:11] message but he makes the statement jesus
[1:01:13] christ is seated
[1:01:15] at the right hand of god right hand of
[1:01:17] the majesty on high ready to intercede
[1:01:19] on your confession and he makes that
[1:01:20] statement how many you're familiar with
[1:01:21] that statement over and over again he
[1:01:23] makes it quite a bit when he's talking
[1:01:24] about interceding on your confession he
[1:01:26] identifies him as this scripture says on
[1:01:29] the right hand of the majesty on high
[1:01:32] there to make intercession
[1:01:35] ephesians 1 20
[1:01:37] which he wrought in christ
[1:01:39] when he raised him from the dead and set
[1:01:41] him at his own right hand in heavenly
[1:01:44] places
[1:01:45] so we again remember our traditional
[1:01:47] image of christ not that is incorrect
[1:01:48] but christ there as the bloody lamb
[1:01:52] interceding for us as a perpetuation for
[1:01:54] our sins we who are sinners he's there
[1:01:56] before the father to atone for our sins
[1:01:59] but now
[1:02:01] once you have accepted that
[1:02:03] and you've identified yourself put your
[1:02:06] hands upon the the sacrifice as it were
[1:02:10] and then he becomes the days been
[1:02:11] between you and god there has now been a
[1:02:14] satisfaction made and paul is saying
[1:02:17] because of this sacrifice and through
[1:02:19] the baptism of the holy ghost you have
[1:02:22] now entered into and you have been
[1:02:23] purged from your old sins and you have
[1:02:25] now entered into fellowship with him
[1:02:28] and he was there seated at the right
[1:02:30] hand of majesty on high but now in
[1:02:32] ephesians 2 46 but god who is rich in
[1:02:35] mercy for his great love where if he
[1:02:37] loved us even when we were dead in sins
[1:02:40] hath quickened us together with christ
[1:02:42] by grace you are saved
[1:02:44] and hath raised us up together
[1:02:48] and made us sit together in heavenly
[1:02:51] places in christ jesus
[1:02:53] and before your mind even goes there
[1:02:56] he's not talking about this banquet room
[1:02:58] in the hilton garden inn or some church
[1:03:00] with four walls he's not talking about a
[1:03:02] sanctuary he's not talking about a
[1:03:04] physical structure he's not talking
[1:03:06] about a church he's talking about a
[1:03:08] hidden life in christ he's talking a
[1:03:10] place that our souls have entered into
[1:03:13] where we are dwelling daily with him
[1:03:17] we use the phrase sometimes all we get
[1:03:18] together we're seated in heavenly places
[1:03:20] in christ jesus thinking that somehow
[1:03:22] when we leave we're taking stairs down
[1:03:24] you didn't take an elevator to get in
[1:03:26] here
[1:03:27] you didn't take an escalator you didn't
[1:03:28] take a uh you haven't been put in one of
[1:03:30] those little tubes at the bank
[1:03:32] and here we are heavenly places in
[1:03:34] christ jesus and we all kind of loathe
[1:03:36] the bobsled right down when we leave
[1:03:37] church no you by the baptism being
[1:03:40] quickened from your sins
[1:03:41] have been raised up and whether you feel
[1:03:43] like it tomorrow morning when you wake
[1:03:45] up or whatever it is you just you just
[1:03:47] ask the advocate to make it more real to
[1:03:49] you heavenly places baby that's where
[1:03:51] i'm that's where i'm at that's where i'm
[1:03:53] living that's where my soul has been
[1:03:55] lifted up to and therefore if my soul
[1:03:58] has been lifted up to a realm of
[1:03:59] heavenly places let my soul lift up my
[1:04:02] spirit let my soul lift up my body see
[1:04:05] i'm letting go in my spirit i'm letting
[1:04:07] go in my body why because i'm seated
[1:04:09] where at the right hand of the majesty
[1:04:13] i'm not down here in a worldly
[1:04:14] tabernacle i'm not stuck here in a
[1:04:16] hilton garden inn but i am raised up
[1:04:18] seated in heavenly places in christ
[1:04:20] jesus not in the sanctuary on the
[1:04:22] outside hoping that something good is
[1:04:24] happening behind badger skins but now
[1:04:26] he's behind my skin
[1:04:29] now i'm raised up to the right hand of
[1:04:31] the majesty on high to where the
[1:04:33] intercession of the advocacy isn't a
[1:04:35] one-way conversation of the advocate and
[1:04:37] god but i'm there and he's encouraging
[1:04:40] me
[1:04:42] this is what where this is the image
[1:04:44] that should be painted to us
[1:04:47] we are seated together with christ in
[1:04:49] heavenly places
[1:04:51] where at the right hand of majesty the
[1:04:53] majesty
[1:04:54] and there
[1:04:56] in that place
[1:04:58] we're with our advocate
[1:05:01] brother man makes this statement i'm
[1:05:02] going to read from
[1:05:03] revelations chapter 4 part 2
[1:05:05] where he speaks on the 24 elders
[1:05:07] revelations chapter 4 part 3 where he's
[1:05:09] speaking of the throne of mercy
[1:05:11] and i'll try to just do this quickly
[1:05:13] first he was in the heavens above and
[1:05:15] shining in the stars
[1:05:16] second he was on earth shining through
[1:05:18] the shekinah glory and that's the
[1:05:19] earthly tabernacle
[1:05:23] next he come and was made flesh and
[1:05:25] dwelt among us still wearing his
[1:05:26] patience
[1:05:28] then so earthly tabernacle
[1:05:32] in the wilderness the the
[1:05:33] worldly sanctuary then the tabernacle of
[1:05:36] christ
[1:05:37] then he redeemed man by his blood
[1:05:39] came into his church in the form of the
[1:05:41] holy ghost
[1:05:43] and the point he's making is about
[1:05:44] blasphemy and things he says speak
[1:05:46] against that
[1:05:47] it's a finished thing done speak against
[1:05:50] what again
[1:05:51] the holy ghost in his church
[1:05:55] let's just be careful what we say
[1:05:58] and he says
[1:05:59] now
[1:06:00] you see
[1:06:01] you see where the shaking come
[1:06:04] we're at a time they don't realize
[1:06:06] people can't comprehend what it means
[1:06:08] the now the first throne was in heaven
[1:06:10] judgment seat the second throne was in
[1:06:12] christ the third throne is in man
[1:06:18] did you catch that first in heaven then
[1:06:20] in christ then in man
[1:06:22] so a week later he says this in
[1:06:24] revelation chapter four part three from
[1:06:26] number this is where he's preaching the
[1:06:27] revelation of jesus christ it's from
[1:06:29] this that we get uh
[1:06:31] great tremendous most of the substance
[1:06:33] from the the church age book
[1:06:35] the mercy seats in the heart
[1:06:39] now that we're just looking at an aspect
[1:06:40] of it
[1:06:41] but it's one i think we must accept the
[1:06:44] seed where the shining forth of his
[1:06:45] glory in all of his children the
[1:06:48] shekinah glory and the human heart
[1:06:51] so now notice the connection you have
[1:06:52] with this
[1:06:53] heavenly places look it's not somewhere
[1:06:56] beyond the veil somewhere
[1:06:59] and it's got to pierce through it's even
[1:07:00] behind the veil of your flesh
[1:07:03] it was one time behind badger skins now
[1:07:04] it dwells behind human skin
[1:07:07] so the mercy seat is in the heart he
[1:07:09] says that's paragraph 308 now paragraph
[1:07:11] 326
[1:07:12] and he's going through the guards and
[1:07:14] those four guards
[1:07:15] those guards that stood there guarding
[1:07:17] the the tabernacle in the old testament
[1:07:19] nothing touched that mercy seat without
[1:07:21] the approach
[1:07:22] and the only thing that could approach
[1:07:24] it was through the blood
[1:07:25] aaron went in there once a year with the
[1:07:27] blood now you see it now watch each head
[1:07:29] of the three tribes guarding the mercy
[1:07:31] seat the mercy seat of the old testament
[1:07:33] now have you got that down everybody now
[1:07:35] here's a brand new one brother listen to
[1:07:38] this then we'll go remember that was the
[1:07:40] guards of the old testament how many has
[1:07:42] ever read it in the bible you know it's
[1:07:43] right see that's the guards of the old
[1:07:46] testament
[1:07:48] now we're living in another age glory oh
[1:07:51] i love this age
[1:07:53] why because it's better
[1:07:54] better promises better covenant
[1:07:56] now god has a mercy seat today to be
[1:07:59] guarded
[1:08:00] where is the mercy seat found in the
[1:08:03] heart of man
[1:08:05] where did it come to the heart of man at
[1:08:07] the day of pentecost when the holy ghost
[1:08:09] which is god
[1:08:10] come into human hearts
[1:08:12] how is it we can have this image how is
[1:08:14] it that brother branham could make this
[1:08:16] connection because all the images all
[1:08:19] the symbols and all the elements are
[1:08:21] there
[1:08:23] and it's exactly part of the connection
[1:08:25] that paul is trying to make so that we
[1:08:27] don't become these people that are just
[1:08:29] believing in an imaginary sanctuary
[1:08:31] somewhere in eternity but that we
[1:08:33] realize it's made real right within our
[1:08:36] own lives whether you want to call it a
[1:08:37] microcosm or just another shadow we can
[1:08:40] say that he has a tone for it and
[1:08:42] through that atonement i know that i've
[1:08:45] entered into something real i know my
[1:08:49] sins are forgiven i know that i've been
[1:08:51] changed from the old man that i used to
[1:08:53] be and now i'm communing now i'm living
[1:08:56] in the presence of the king now my soul
[1:08:58] has been filled and my soul has become a
[1:09:01] place of mercy
[1:09:05] how how in the world could a human heart
[1:09:07] be a mercy seed
[1:09:09] all the elements are there
[1:09:12] he's coming to human hearts
[1:09:14] what is the holy ghost he's the advocate
[1:09:17] what is he the perpetuation
[1:09:19] where is he in the seat of your heart
[1:09:22] and what is he doing even today right
[1:09:23] now telling you don't fear
[1:09:26] don't worry it doesn't matter how dark
[1:09:28] it gets
[1:09:29] i'm here as a witness that you're
[1:09:31] already connected to something beyond
[1:09:33] this
[1:09:34] and i'm going to take you out of here
[1:09:36] not even death can destroy this
[1:09:39] where is your advocate
[1:09:41] in your heart
[1:09:44] by the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:09:48] he's behind your skins now
[1:09:51] christ made surety of a better testament
[1:09:54] is now dwelling in your hearts as that
[1:09:55] security as that pledge as the mediator
[1:09:58] of god's promise
[1:10:00] free scriptures to end it invite the
[1:10:02] musicians if you want to come to your
[1:10:04] places
[1:10:06] he is a surety
[1:10:08] what is the holy ghost
[1:10:09] in the heart of man brother man looks at
[1:10:11] it from one type as the mercy seat
[1:10:14] second corinthians chapter 1 verse 22
[1:10:15] who hath sealed us and given the earnest
[1:10:18] of the spirit in our hearts
[1:10:21] what what is that god hasn't put you on
[1:10:23] layaway
[1:10:24] right i mean let's not oh well i sure
[1:10:26] hope he gets another paycheck
[1:10:29] case get all these other worldly things
[1:10:31] out of your mind he gave you the holy
[1:10:33] spirit so that you would know
[1:10:36] it's guaranteed
[1:10:38] it's a done deal the earnest is given as
[1:10:41] a pledge of what he's saying the earnest
[1:10:44] of the spirit of hearts what is it for
[1:10:45] it's it's the evidence of full
[1:10:47] redemption
[1:10:50] it's the completion it's the evidence of
[1:10:52] the perfection ephesians 1 13 and 14
[1:10:54] sealed with that holy spirit of promise
[1:10:57] which is the earnest of the inheritance
[1:10:59] until the redemption of the purchased
[1:11:00] possession he gave it to us now why did
[1:11:03] he give it to you now because he had a
[1:11:05] plan of redemption that was going to run
[1:11:07] its course and for some of us we thought
[1:11:09] for sure we wouldn't have gone past 1965
[1:11:11] maybe we didn't think we'd get out of
[1:11:13] the 60s then we thought sure for sure it
[1:11:15] would be 77 then we thought maybe it was
[1:11:17] 84 then we thought it was the year 2000
[1:11:19] and here we are in 2021 and we haven't
[1:11:22] been worse off why because he gave us
[1:11:25] the spirit as the guarantee that no
[1:11:28] matter how long this would continue how
[1:11:30] long this would go on your redemption is
[1:11:33] secure it is complete and if you have to
[1:11:36] go by way of a grave that is no discount
[1:11:39] against you that is no mark against you
[1:11:42] that is no evidence of the lack of faith
[1:11:44] but the earnest you were given is the
[1:11:46] guarantee you'll come up in the
[1:11:48] resurrection and you'll have a glorified
[1:11:50] body one day
[1:11:54] it is given to us
[1:11:57] it is given to us
[1:12:00] as the earnest
[1:12:01] oh do you see why we must be born again
[1:12:04] you see why we need this blessed
[1:12:06] assurance why we need to be connected to
[1:12:07] it why we need to be feeding it while we
[1:12:09] have to know about it
[1:12:12] because it's our advocate
[1:12:14] and he's our earnest
[1:12:17] so paul says in second corinthians
[1:12:18] chapter 5 verses 4 to 5
[1:12:20] if i had included goku good i'd included
[1:12:22] that one
[1:12:24] for we that are in this tabernacle
[1:12:26] do groan
[1:12:28] oh so we are a tabernacle
[1:12:30] and we have a sanctuary
[1:12:33] and we have a holy of holies
[1:12:35] and in there
[1:12:36] is christ
[1:12:39] and we that are in this tabernacle do
[1:12:41] groan
[1:12:42] and the holy spirit our advocate is
[1:12:44] groaning within us
[1:12:46] things that we don't know what to say
[1:12:47] things we don't know to ask remember
[1:12:49] they're in romans 8
[1:12:50] it's giving there
[1:12:51] we that are in this tabernacle do groan
[1:12:53] being burdened not that we should be
[1:12:55] unclothed but clothed upon
[1:12:57] that mortality might be swallowed up of
[1:12:59] life
[1:13:01] now he
[1:13:02] that hath wrought
[1:13:04] us for the self thing same thing is god
[1:13:08] who also hath given a unto us
[1:13:11] the earnest
[1:13:13] of the spirit
[1:13:15] not the earnest that will receive the
[1:13:16] spirit but the spirit as an earnest
[1:13:20] of what
[1:13:22] the redemption of the purchased
[1:13:23] possession
[1:13:24] completely purchased in the atonement
[1:13:28] but standing for things that are so much
[1:13:29] better than just a good life here on
[1:13:31] earth
[1:13:32] but that mortality might be swallowed up
[1:13:34] in life
[1:13:37] so the earnest on the inside of you is a
[1:13:39] witness
[1:13:40] that mortality can be swallowed up with
[1:13:42] life
[1:13:43] that's what the advocate we that are in
[1:13:44] this tabernacle do groan i'm so glad
[1:13:47] that in this tabernacle there's a high
[1:13:48] priest
[1:13:50] and there's one there advocating for me
[1:13:53] in the throne of my heart
[1:13:55] reminding me
[1:13:57] teaching me
[1:13:58] leading me in guiding me
[1:14:01] let me say this morning if you don't
[1:14:02] know him
[1:14:03] accept him
[1:14:05] if you haven't repented of your sins
[1:14:06] repent of your sins if you haven't been
[1:14:08] baptized in christian baptism which is
[1:14:10] in the name of the lord jesus christ in
[1:14:11] order to be sealed with that holy spirit
[1:14:13] of promise then i implore you don't miss
[1:14:17] that it's the peace you crave
[1:14:20] it's the liberty you crave
[1:14:21] it's the joy you crave
[1:14:24] and for those of us who have felt this
[1:14:26] blessed earnest let's not forget what it
[1:14:29] stands for
[1:14:30] not be reaching out there for something
[1:14:32] oh if this could change if that could
[1:14:33] change if i could have this if i could
[1:14:35] have that if this could be mended if
[1:14:36] this could be broken if this could take
[1:14:38] place if that could take place no just
[1:14:40] come right back to the advocate today
[1:14:43] and say i know that you're with me
[1:14:45] and with you
[1:14:46] i'm willing to go
[1:14:48] all the way let's stand
[1:14:55] i trust you can see the image of the
[1:14:56] sanctuary
[1:14:59] the tabernacle the sanctuary
[1:15:01] the outer court the inner court the holy
[1:15:02] of holies there's different elements
[1:15:04] that we could have
[1:15:05] laid out or even diagrammed to you i
[1:15:07] hope that you can see yourself today
[1:15:10] and where this mediator is
[1:15:13] not somewhere
[1:15:15] in a sanctuary in israel
[1:15:18] not even somewhere merely in heaven and
[1:15:20] we're here on earth
[1:15:21] but it's a spiritual place
[1:15:24] that is it's a spiritual communion and
[1:15:26] it even has representation right down
[1:15:29] inside of the inside of the inside
[1:15:31] let's bow our heads today
[1:15:37] [Music]
[1:15:40] our heavenly father
[1:15:44] we thank you for your presence that has
[1:15:46] been with us today and
[1:15:48] i personally thank you lord for the
[1:15:50] diligence of the people
[1:15:52] as they persevere and
[1:15:55] maybe strain to catch every word
[1:15:58] [Music]
[1:15:59] and i'm thankful father that you stand
[1:16:02] between us
[1:16:04] between speaker
[1:16:06] and here
[1:16:08] and in us in speaker and here
[1:16:12] to rightly divide the word of truth and
[1:16:14] place it just in that right spot that a
[1:16:15] believer needs
[1:16:17] lord i do not believe that today we
[1:16:19] labor to force
[1:16:21] an object into a place that it does not
[1:16:23] belong
[1:16:25] but the word preached you just take it
[1:16:28] and it finds sanctuary it finds rest it
[1:16:30] settles
[1:16:31] where it needs to
[1:16:33] and i ask today lord that as when this
[1:16:35] many people gather together there's
[1:16:37] needs that vary so much
[1:16:40] lord i know there's need for the the
[1:16:41] baptism of the holy ghost we know
[1:16:43] there's need for greater sanctification
[1:16:45] there's need for restoration and healing
[1:16:49] i pray lord that we could be pointed now
[1:16:53] with clouds rolling away and things
[1:16:55] pushed aside and see you today
[1:16:59] and receive you today for all that we
[1:17:01] need
[1:17:02] and i ask that you bless your people
[1:17:04] give them strength and encourage them
[1:17:05] today
[1:17:08] father as we've lifted up these things
[1:17:10] may we not be quick to leave them
[1:17:13] but may we find in is searching our
[1:17:15] hearts lord find the right thing to
[1:17:17] reinforce to fellowship on with one
[1:17:19] another and our spouse or our children
[1:17:21] or our brothers and sisters later lord
[1:17:23] that we could rehearse the right things
[1:17:26] and the correct things to one another
[1:17:27] that we're not so
[1:17:28] quick to leave this sanctuary
[1:17:32] and lose connection with that holy of
[1:17:34] holies that's
[1:17:35] represented deep down on the inside of
[1:17:37] us by the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:17:40] and lord as we've made invitation to any
[1:17:42] who be lost to receive you may they
[1:17:44] receive you now
[1:17:45] may they accept you
[1:17:47] if they don't know how to
[1:17:50] may the holy spirit just begin to open
[1:17:52] up their eyes of understanding
[1:17:54] that they begin in repentance
[1:17:56] that the scriptures teach that with the
[1:17:58] mouth confession is made from a
[1:18:00] believing heart
[1:18:03] and that
[1:18:04] once we've repented of our sins we are
[1:18:07] baptized because we know our sins are
[1:18:09] forgiven
[1:18:11] and they've been purged
[1:18:13] and lord we can
[1:18:15] receive the seal of god
[1:18:17] the earnest
[1:18:20] lord if i could be a little bit more
[1:18:21] personal right now it
[1:18:25] that seal was for us
[1:18:28] to seal my faith with an earnest
[1:18:32] is my source of courage strength
[1:18:35] leadership
[1:18:37] safety
[1:18:38] peace
[1:18:40] all the remaining days of a saved life
[1:18:44] may we draw every benefit of the
[1:18:46] atonement lord
[1:18:48] may we leave none behind
[1:18:50] shake us out of traditions shake us out
[1:18:52] of theology's lord that restraint shakes
[1:18:55] lord
[1:18:56] from any any
[1:18:58] images and any ideas and any thoughts
[1:19:00] that hold us back
[1:19:02] from walking fully in the promise made
[1:19:04] available to us today
[1:19:06] bless your people may they be loosed may
[1:19:08] they be free
[1:19:09] may they thoroughly enjoy the
[1:19:11] relationship with their advocate i ask
[1:19:13] this in the name of lord jesus christ
