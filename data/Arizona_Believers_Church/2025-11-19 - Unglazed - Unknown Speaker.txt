TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Proverbs 26, start with verse 20. I'd like to read to the end of the chapter, verse 28. Where no wood is, there the fire goeth out. So where there is no tail bearer, the strife see ceaseth. What a amazing statement. As coals are to the burning coals and wood to fire, so is a contentious man to kindle strife. The words of a tail bearer are his wounds, and they go down in the innermost parts of the belly. Burning lips and a wicked heart are like a posturard covered with silver draws. He that hateth assembbleth with his lips, and layeth up deceit within him. When he speaketh fair, believe him not, for there are seven abominations in his heart, whose hatred is covered by deceit. His wickedness shall be showed before the whole congregation. Who so digth a pit shall fall therein, and he that rolleth a stone, it'll return upon him. A lying tongue hateth those that are afflicted by it, and a flattering mouth workketh ruin. by what uh incredible words that we've read. Trust that in this there's something that speaks to you. You can take your seats. We ministered on Sunday on unwaxed and we looked at uh we're looking at pottery and ceramics as an example just to dig into these certain principles in the word of God. Tonight I'm going to use a phrase unglazed. I say phrase, it's just a term. It's a word unglazed. So there's a lot we'd like to express in this. trust we can just jump into it this evening and uh knowing that the chill that we feel is not from air conditioners but from the cooling of the weather here in the valley but unglazed is my title uh to kind of capture some things from Sunday as we had to leave a few things out we'll just review for a few moments Isaiah chapter 64:8 says but now oh Lord thou art our father and in this idea of him him being the progenitor him being the creator it says we are the clay and thou art, our potter, and we all are the work of thy hand. So God likens himself in other places as being a potter and Israel being the clay. Here we make this confession. We are but clay in the hands of the master who can make of us as he will, who can form us and fashion us in whatever shape he would desire us to be in. And God is not an artist who's just merely making something to display his handiwork, but he wants it to be used and utilized. And so God is the potter. We are the clay and we are the work of his hand. A potter is an artist who works with ceramics or makes objects out of clay. And God is likening himself to that. He uses the example himself in the scripture. We read some of those on Sunday. And that's is this is how he's describing his work in us as we are but clay that can be formed by him. And we know according to the scripture that God has fashioned us and formed us so that he can dwell inside of us. You are the temple of the Lord. So God forms the clay that you might be the dwelling place of God's spirit. That's the building up of the stature of a perfect man. And it was in this vein that we were using this example of being unwaxed and it was touching on the subject of sincerity. So in Philippians 1:es 9 to1 11 it says in this I pray that your love may abound yet more and more in all in knowledge and in all judgment. So this is the growth. This is the growing the waxing that ye may approve things that are excellent. So we have to be the light which reproves that which judges that ye may be sincere and without offense till the day of Christ. So if we are likened unto vessels that are sincere and without offense, now the vessel is filled. Verse 11, being filled with the fruits of righteousness which are by Jesus Christ unto the glory and praise of God. This is according to even this chapter. This is the work that he's begun in us that he's just and faithful to finish. He's just and faithful to accomplish and to perfect this work. And he says that ye may be inwardly sincere. The sincerity has to do with the depths of heart. inwardly sincere and outwardly without offense or unoffensive. That's that we use the phrase unwaxed and smooth. Unoffensive means smooth. And so in the sense that you are going to be a vessel, you're not waxed and patched up and there's no superficial veneer that is placed upon you. And so being unwaxed, but being a chosen vessel made by God, you can be filled up. You can be uh uh filled with the fruits of righteousness. 1 Corinthians 5 7 and 8. Purge out therefore the old leavenven that you may be a new lump as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our Passover is sacrificed for us. So unleavened, unwaxed, unglazed, all these undoings in our lives. Therefore, let us keep the feast not with old leaven, neither with the leavenven of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. This leaven of malice and wickedness speaks to inward insincerity, outward offensiveness. Says, "But we ought to keep the feast with the bread of sincerity and truth. We must be sincere, but we must be sincere with truth." Because if you're sincere and you don't have truth, you are sincerely wrong. And if you just have truth without sincerity, you can handle the truth in righteousness. You can have the wrong motive and objective. So it must be the spirit and truth. It must be sincere with truth. One of the statements that we didn't have time to read on Sunday was from the sermon trying to do God a service without it being his will at the businessman's breakfast in November of 1965. He says, "You can think you're doing God a service. And if you're going out of God's way of doing it, you're going to keep messing it up on and on. So you may believe that you're doing God a service, but if it's not according to his will, you're just going to keep messing it up because you've got to do it his way. Oh church of the living God, please forgive my Irish way and my sense of humor, but in the sincerity and sacredness of my heart, you assemblies of God, you oneness, Presbyterian, Methodist, whatever you are, flee for your life. Remember, get out from there. Now, that don't mean draw out from church. That means draw out from denominationalism. So there's a there's a way then that we look at this. He says you got to leave denominations but don't leave church. Sometimes people have taken it too far to leave church. He says you must go to church but don't don't join any organization. Jesus went with all the organizations but he never joined one of them. Neither did he side with any of them. No indeed but he was among them. There's where the lights got to be scattered. A lot of what we've been looking at and reflecting his beauty and these different sermons we've preached over the last few weeks have been about light and you being light and this brightness of his beauty, this radiance without these filters, these glasses that warp the light. He says this is where the light's got to be scattered and you stay right where you are scattering the light. That's what God's using you for. &gt;&gt; So you are to be a vessel of light. Right? &gt;&gt; He says, "Hungry-hearted people, let them know that Jesus Christ is real, just the same as he was yesterday, he is today and will be forever." He says, "It is possible a man or woman with all sincerity trying their best to do God a service and stirred it in the wrong way." So, here's the possibility that one could be just as sincere as they possibly can be and they're trying to do right, but they're stirred in the wrong way. He says with the genuine anointing of the Holy Spirit upon them, but stirred it contrary to God's plan for the age and chaos the whole thing. &gt;&gt; Chaos the whole thing by not coming God's provided way to do it. And I think we can see this example today. A lot of sincere people are stirred a and trying to do God a a service and they're sincere about it, but it's not according to God's way of doing. He says particularly the plan for this age and what does it cause? a lot of confusion, a lot of chaos and a and a lot of diffusion of the light. &gt;&gt; So, he's saying that we must be sincere, but it's not just sincerity alone. I was wanting to read that Sunday just to back up those many different statements we were looking at that we must be it to be sincere or unwaxed as we were saying is that it must also be to truth. Sincerity and truth. That's how you have genuine faith. A sincere faith is when it's rooted in the word of God. Now, on the subject this evening on unglazed, I'm wanting to pick up on a lot of these similar themes of light and pottery and these different arts that we can look at to draw from them truth to make them more easily grasped for us as Christians. And I'm using it as a reference to pottery to say unglazed. I'm using it as a reference to pottery that has not been glazed. And the definition of glaze is to fit with glass. I want you to think of this phrase. It's important to fit with glass or to make shine. So when something is glazed, it's fitted with glass and this is very uh literal in our modern techniques with glazing and uh it is also makes it's made to shine to make shine. Now some of you folks may know that the phrase glaze is now uh is used to speak of uh over complimenting something. That's exaggerated or excessive praise where somebody is just passing on the old glorious Caleb Williams and there you say well they're this glazing on Caleb Williams. he's the greatest quarterback ever to walk the grid iron. And so you say, "Well, that's just glazing because you say, well, clearly he's not the greatest quarterback ever. He may have the greatest uh nails painted in in quarterback history. I don't know." But there's that's just when somebody the oh this guy's this and it's over excessive and it's a little bit too much. They call that glazing. Why? Because it's more than it should be. And now in the sense of pottery, potters use glaze to cover vessels with a shiny or glossy substance. Uh we might say to gloss over something or to glaze over. It's to cover something up with uh some substance that makes it shine, makes it pop. And it's done to improve the appearance of the clay. It's done to make it look attractive. It's cosmetic. It's artistic. And there's even we could say glaze over. But then there's also a phrase you've probably heard of before and it's to gloss over. Anybody ever heard that phrase? We're not talking about lips, but we're talking about glossing over something. But it means to minimize something or to omit something. Oh, I glossed over that. I glazed over that. And it's to apply. If you gloss over something, you're applying a varnish to make something appear smooth. &gt;&gt; May not be smooth, but you want it to look like it's smooth. &gt;&gt; And so it's to make something attractive or acceptable by deception. That's what maybe glossing over something. you give it this superficial treatment. It's like, wow, man. We were having a conversation about this. They kind of glossed over the fact uh that they that they're a convicted felon and and and want to buy a gun. You say, "Well, that that was very important." And they just kind of gloss over it. So, it's the idea of obscuring or concealing or diminishing the importance of something to glaze over it, to gloss over it. You trying to hide it, trying to cover up or diminish its importance. Now, we can gloss over an error. Glaze over an error. Something can be a lie. You kind of glaze over it. you minimize how important it is. You kind of disregard the fact that it's a lie. But you can also glaze over the truth &gt;&gt; in the sense that you try to cover it up and you make it something it's not or omit it. And so when we use the phrase at this point I want to look at from the standpoint unglazed is to not be artificially smooth. the hypocrisy we were looking at on Sunday, but to be sincere and and not covering it up with religion, with our attempts to appear righteous or or our attempts to make ourselves acceptable to God or if we could use it in the sense of to make shine or to fit with glass. It's we don't want to use a false light. &gt;&gt; We don't want to just use smoke and mirrors. We don't want to try to put off errors and use a false light. And this is I think we're hopefully when we we hitting this and turning to Acts chapter 23:3, I want to make this point with the these scriptures we have coming up that sin at its worst is glazed to appear beautiful and obtractive. &gt;&gt; We may say sin at its worst is when you look at it and SAY THAT'S HORRIBLE, THAT'S AWFUL, THAT'S DEBAUCHERY, THAT'S PERVERSION, that's filth, that's disgusting. But no, sin at its worst is when it's glazed to appear beautiful, &gt;&gt; when it's made smooth, when it's made attractive, when it when that happens, sin is is are the it's the attributes of unbelief and it's made to it kind of glosses over the misery of it, &gt;&gt; glosses over the death that lays inside of it. in Acts chapter 23:3. And for time's sake, we're just not going to build around this story where Paul gets pretty upset because he's struck in the face. And then said Paul unto him, God shall smite thee, thou whited wall. He's not talking about tires. Thou whited wall forsidest thou to judge me after the law, and commandest me to be smitten contrary to the law. What was he calling him out for? Being a hypocrite. And he calls them a wided wall. I don't know if you've ever heard anybody call somebody a wided wall as a way of criticizing them or calling them out, but he says they're a wided wall. Wided wall means to cover over. To be wided means to cover over with lime. To plaster over means to whitewash. &gt;&gt; And what happens when you whitewash something? You're covering it with in a way to wash it to appear clean. But you've only covered it up. It's not actually scrubbed clean or or or whittleled down to its its base basis and and rendered pure, but it's JUST KIND OF PLASTERED OVER. It's been given something to cover up. It says YOU'RE A WIDED WALL. YOU'RE BEING HYPOCRITICAL. You want to appear righteous and pious. You want to appear to have some sort of authority and and judge me according to the law, but then you act contrary to the law. So the term whited wall and he especially to a Jew is one who is a hypocrite. A wided wall is one who conceals malice under this outward uh uh uh piety, this outward religion. That's exactly what's happening in Acts 23. Jesus says it in chapter 23 of Matthew verse 27. Woe unto you scribes and Pharisees hypocrites. For ye are like unto whited supplicers, whitewashed, plastered over, rendered brilliant, identifiable, you could see it, which indeed appear beautiful outward. And notice I think this is just a beautiful picture of what is meant behind this wided wall and what is kind of being addressed in terms of these things that are very very superficial. You appear beautiful outwardly but are within full of dead men's bones and all uncleanness. Now this is a very real uh example within the law. What the Jews would do is they would whitewash the tombs so that they were identifiable so that you could see them because to touch them could RENDER SOMEBODY DEFILED AND THEY wouldn't be able to perform service or enter to the temple. There was this washing that they would have to go through. So they wanted to make it obvious to stay away. &gt;&gt; So this is a concept that would have been very useful. Whitewash it, paint it white, plaster it, put the lime wash over it. What make it conspicuous so that when someone sees it, they would avoid it. But he's saying you have become yourselves whitewashed to be appear beautiful but inside &gt;&gt; you're full of death. &gt;&gt; Brother Brand makes a number of statements on this order many many different places in the message where he's talking about this this light the false light this glamour that can be expressed. He says sin is so enticing. He says it is glamour and it's got a very appetizing appeal. It is so innocent. And we may think, "Wow, man. I tell you what, a prostitution doesn't seem very appealing, and drug addictions don't seem appealing, and you know, smoking crack isn't appealing, and doing heroin isn't appealing, and robbing somebody, and killing somebody. There's a lot of things we might say is not very appealing." But those are the things that h have haven't been glazed over. &gt;&gt; Those are the things that kind of we haven't whitewashed. &gt;&gt; We read in Proverbs 26 23, we're talking about a slothful man in these verses. and then one that begins to lie and to meddle and just how the tongue is such an unruly member which can kindleth a small matter and make it great. A lot of great scriptural principles being addressed. But he begins to talk about one who lies with his mouth, speaks fair, but he has abominations in his heart. He stirth uh hatred with his lips uh and he does it with deceit. It says burning lips and a wicked heart are like a postured covered with silver draws. I almost named my sermon today flaming lips. Burning lips and a wicked heart are like a posturard covered with silver draws. Postured here is pottery which is broken might often be appear as if it's something that is a fragment of pottery but what is to me when I studied this and looked at it it's not so much just a fragment or a piece but pottery which is otherwise unusable that is covered with silver dross. You know what that is? a glaze. It's something that's broken, covered up with a glaze so that you don't see its cracks. &gt;&gt; It's a dishonest use of glaze. &gt;&gt; We said that potters use glaze to cover vessels in in a glossy substance to make it appear beautiful and cosmetically appealing. But now this is the use of it not just to catch the eye, but to actually cover some deformity. And it's saying that burning lips and a wicked heart is like a broken pottery vessel that's been glazed over with silver dross or glazed so that you don't see the cracks. This is a fervent speech. Burning lips is a fervent speech. Passionate speech. Oh, I love you. Oh, isn't that wonderful? ISN'T THAT GREAT? I believe this. I BELIEVE THAT. SOME KIND OF CONFESSION. THEY DRAW NIGH WITH me to their lips, but their hearts are far from me. It's fervent speech which deceptively covers dishonesty or evil in their heart. &gt;&gt; And now the scriptur is likening to somebody who isn't sincere in the depths of their heart but maybe outwardly pious. He's saying you're like a clay vessel that is actually broken &gt;&gt; and inside is death but we dress it up &gt;&gt; with lies. We dress it up with our mouth with a glaze. This may seem to be lowhanging fruit, no pun intended, but in Genesis chapter 3, when you read the temptation of the woman by by Satan through the serpent, the woman says, "You will if you partake of this fruit, you will die." And Satan begins to lie. Says, "You surely shall not die. You surely shall surely not die. For God knows the day that you eat thereof." This is verses 4 to6. Then your eyes shall be open and you shall be as gods. What's he doing? We know the result is death. &gt;&gt; But what is he doing now? He's glazing death over. &gt;&gt; He's actually glazing it over with a lie. And he can't say, "Well, you're not going to die immediately. It'll take some time." &gt;&gt; He said, "No, you'll become his gods. You'll know good and evil." And when Wilman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree desired to make one wise, what happened? Eve started glazing over the food. &gt;&gt; IT WAS TO EAT IT, YOU DIE. BUT NOW SHE'S GIVING THIS unsubstantiated praise to it. Oh my, isn't this good? And that's exactly what she did. She went to Adam and was glazing over the forbidden fruit so much. Adam ptook himself. AND SO WHAT HAPPENED is Satan in the beginning, the original sin is about taking a lie and dressing it up. &gt;&gt; He caused Eve to desire this forbidden fruit. This is this is at the very root of how Satan works. If you eat it, you die. Oh no, let's just gloss over it. Let's glaze over it a little bit. And brother Bradam talks about how human instinctively and spiritually, he talks about how that we're uh we we we we go for what glitters. &gt;&gt; Maybe in our modern language, we would say that we're wired for glitter. But he uses this phrase a few times, but not all that glitters is gold. &gt;&gt; That's a common expression, a common phrase. Not all that glitters is gold. He talks about how that he's uh been a little bit of a prospector. He's seen fool's gold that shines brighter than real gold. That's right. &gt;&gt; And so there's something that can appear, as he said, very innocent, very pleasing, very attractive, have an appetizing appeal to sin, but that sin as it's glazed. Listen, how many how many kids here just order a plain cake donut? Huh? How how many of you do it? Be honest. No, you don't want you just don't want a a a donut. You want it glazed, right? True. &gt;&gt; You you you wanted to have some that's the attraction. An unglazed cake donut. That's a waste of time. &gt;&gt; It's a happy meal without a toy and a fruit cup instead of fries. And so this is we're kind of wired that way. We it wants to be attractive. We want to be pleasing. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandon said that's WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH our world today is too much sin is called innocent fun. &gt;&gt; Why? Because there's a lot of things that we have patched up and covered over the consequences. We've rephrased things in a way and we've looked at consequences and we've kind of shuffled things around and we begin to glaze over the tombs and begin to glaze over the death. We begin to glaze over the consequences so much to where now we begin to make sin look appealing just as Satan was able to do it in Genesis 3. In Hebrews 11 24- 27 says by faith Moses when he was come to years refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter. It may not seem to be uh much. We say well he wasn't the son of Pharaoh's daughter. But he said I I don't want to be identified with it. I don't want the benefits and the privileges that come with it. I don't want the path to the throne that I may get because of this. But by faith when he was come of years he refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter. And he chose he refused and chose or refused and choosed verse 25 choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season. Brother Bam talking about Lot. He says Lot when he looked down in those wellwatered plains he saw the sins of Sodom and he looked at was like oh well YOU KNOW I COULD STILL KEEP my testimony. Oh this won't matter. He says how easy it is and how pleasing sin looks to be and how innocent it looks to be. way to paint the picture to where it's not as bad as it looks. But here, Moses chooses affliction over pleasure. &gt;&gt; I love the way that it's expressed here. He doesn't say he ch he chose the riches of Christ. He chose affliction over pleasure, esteeming the reproach of Christ. Again, it's not riches again. It's the reproach greater riches than the treasures in Egypt. Amen. &gt;&gt; So he chose affliction over pleasures and reproach over treasures. &gt;&gt; For he had respect under the recompense of the reward. By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king. For he endured as seeing him who is invisible. If I could put it this way, Moses was able to look beyond the reproach of Christ, able to look beyond the affliction of God's people and see the greater beauty in it. &gt;&gt; Right? He must have seen in Israel what God saw a vessel of honor. He must have seen in Christ what God saw something worthy to be chosen. And when he was able to look at it that way, say, "Well, I have I have reproach and I have suffering and I have treasures and pleasures and I'm going to choose this." IT'S BECAUSE HE SAW A GREATER VALUE AND WORTH ON THE OTHER SIDE of that. PASS ALL THE DIFFICULTIES, PASS ALL THE SUFFERING, then all the the temporary pleasures &gt;&gt; that sin would offer him. &gt;&gt; It actually allowed him to unglaze sin. &gt;&gt; The pleasures of sin for a season. Sin for is is pleasant for a while, right? Kind of like what's going to happen this coming, not this, not tomorrow, but next week. It's going TO BE A LIFETIME on the lips and months on the hips if we're lucky. or maybe a life a moment on the lips and a lifetime on the hips is what they say. AND THAT'S WHY IT'S JUST FOR A MOMENT. FOR A moment when they say it's it's it's sweet in your mouth. What's the scripture say? It's sweet in my mouth but bigger in my belly. It's my translation. And so there's something about this temporary enjoyment that comes with permanent consequences. He says, "You know what? I've taken all the varnish off his sin. It's &gt;&gt; been unglazed before my eyes. And so I I'm willing to choose Christ. &gt;&gt; You ever heard the phrase, I think it's even made into a song, it's easier to sell a lie than to give the truth away. &gt;&gt; Yeah. It's just the reality anymore. &gt;&gt; It's easier to sell a lie, to make truth off a lie, make money off a lie, than it is to give the truth away. &gt;&gt; That's right. And I think it's because truth in reality, people, it's hard to see the beauty in it. But if I could encourage you this way, truth doesn't need to be dressed up. &gt;&gt; I think that's where we we we wrestle a lot of times and say, "Well, how can we dress it up? How how can we, you know, how how can we try to clean up the message so it so it it doesn't look so controversial?" Well, I'm not going to try that &gt;&gt; because when they do that with the Bible, they get so far away from God. &gt;&gt; And so I I I'm not responsible for trying to clean things up. &gt;&gt; Clean the record up. Explain this. Explain that. I I I I don't want to do that. What I want for myself personally is to know that I'm walking by faith. &gt;&gt; That that's what means the most to me. That's how I'm able to to receive from God. It's how I'm blessed BY HIS PRESENCE. IT'S HOW I OVERCOME difficult situations. IT'S WHAT MADE ME FREE FROM the law of sin or death is the personal REVELATION OF JESUS CHRIST. NOT CLEANING UP MY PAST, not explaining all my mistakes and figuring everything out and how it all works together for good. Truth does not need to be dressed up. &gt;&gt; As a matter of fact, in order to see Christ, we have to take all the denominational glaze away. &gt;&gt; All the theological, it has to be unglazed to see the true beauty of Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; I've been just trying to study and prepare my heart for some of the things that uh maybe even in the Christmas season and just to wrap up the thought we've been on this year. And what I keep coming back to is just how beautiful Christ is. That there there is an image of beauty that we should be beholding that we should be looking at. We should see it in Christ. And he doesn't need makeup. He doesn't need dress up. He doesn't need explanation. We he needs revelation &gt;&gt; to see him as he is &gt;&gt; in his true glory. and glow because that's what Christ does is he radiates, he glows. Whereas Hollywood glitters, humankind is attracted to the glitz. Just human instinct to to want something to glitter. That's why things are advertised with neon signs, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; With there there's certain colors that pop. There's certain uh you know there's a science behind branding. Why? They want to draw your attention. So, we've looked at for a few moments on this subject of unglazed in the sense of uh something being humanly or even deceptively glossed over. Well, you take something maybe has a flaw or a defect or take something that is actually death, but then you glaze it over with a shiny substance like, "Oo, I want to drink that, but inside is death, &gt;&gt; poison." We looked at it in that sense. But on the other hand, there's actually a practical use for glaze. And and I venture here for all the ceramacist here who might be like, "Well, that's you're giving glaze a bad name." And so, we're going to redeem glaze. But there's a practical use for it. Earth and wear or clay vessels remain slightly porous even after firing. And so if you were to take a vessel and want to store liquids in it, those liquids in that clay container would percolate slowly to the outside or be absorbed into the clay and render the vessel perhaps unusable for anything else or completely ineffective in the sense THAT I PUT WATER IN IT AND now it's all gone. I put I put oil in it but now it's all been absorbed into the clay. So you would glaze that vessel. There would be this application in the very beginning. the techniques. I was reading and studying on these techniques going back hundreds and hundreds, thousands of years. Really just a a fascinating stuff. Anybody want to have a breakout session? Maybe meet for coffee for a few hours. We can talk glazes. And there is so many different techniques and how the Chinese started doing this. And even on these certain islands, they found certain applications. They're all trying to solve this problem. I MADE THIS WONDERFUL VESSEL to hold this liquid, BUT IT REMAINED POROUS AFTER I FIRED IT. AND THEY TRIED TO COME UP WITH A way to seal it so it wouldn't leak out. One of the techniques that seemed to stick and that became the most effective was this application of finely ground glass powder suspended in water. And you you'd apply that to a to a a vessel that had already been fired. I think they call it bisque firing now. Makes me kind of hungry. Lobster bisque, right? And there's a there's a bisque firing that you do and then there's a subsequent glazing and then you fire it at hotter temperatures for longer, I think. And what would HAPPEN WHEN FIRED AGAIN, THAT GLAZE, that glass that was applied would melt and form this fused glass layer. And they say it would seal the clay pores so that whatever was in it wouldn't get out &gt;&gt; and other things couldn't get in. It was sealed. So there's a human glazing there. There is a there's a a veneer. There's something we could try to do to fix something up. But then in another sense, there's a a WAY THAT GOD HAS FOR HIS OWN EARTH AND VESSELS. HE HE HE FORMS YOU AS CLAY. You're coming to this world AS VESSELS OF CLAY. BUT GOD HAS A PROCESS TO BRING YOU TO A PLACE WHERE YOU CAN BE A VESSEL FILLED WITH GOODNESS. &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; In religion, THEY HAVE A BROKEN VESSEL THAT THEY TRY TO FIX AND THEY TRY TO USE ALL THESE HUMAN IDEAS TO CREATE RELIGION, BUT something's lacking on the inside. And worse yet, something's still there on the inside that still eventually leaks out. Whereas with God's process, he wants to seal you. &gt;&gt; As Ephesians chapter 4:30 says, "And grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby you are sealed into the day of redemption." The Holy Spirit is part of God's glazing process that SEALS YOU UP. GOD IS THE POTTER WHO forms you. The glazes, fires his own work to seal in the goodness of God &gt;&gt; in the soul to seal that soul up. It's why many people can have experiences with God, but until you're born again by the baptism of the Holy Ghost, your experience can just leak out. &gt;&gt; Can keep leaking out. Things can leak in. Things get out eventually if you're just pretending you're going to have a meltdown or a breakdown. If God is gracious to you, &gt;&gt; could any of any of you testify that there was a time in your life when you seemed like you were doing pretty good as a Christian, pretty good as a believer, and then God I think a CS Lewis said it, he said, "God knew that what I had was a house of cards. &gt;&gt; It was I that didn't know it." SO GOD ALLOWS IT TO COME CRASHING DOWN SO YOU CAN GET THE real stuff. &gt;&gt; AND SO IF GOD'S GRACIOUS TO US, he it's exposed. Otherwise, we just continue on as hypocrites. &gt;&gt; So, there is this glazing that can take place. So, you can look at it this way. Say, well, my subject is unglazed. I don't want to be glazed by the world, but I don't want to be left unglazed where God seals in this vessel. &gt;&gt; So, remember these two uh these two definitions we use for glaze to fit with glass. There's this image of this glass, this solidifying. It's actually glassed over. That's what glaze is or to make shine. In second Corinthians chapter 3:18, notice he says, "But we all with open face beholden as in a glass the glory of the Lord or changes the same image from glory to glory, even as by the spirit of the Lord." Jesus Christ who is in the image of God the stature of a perfect man that when we behold and when we look at him we can say there's true beauty he who the father hath sealed and there on Mount Transfiguration his face did shine as the sun there was this glorious radiance he's rendered ILLUSTRIOUS HERE HE'S SHINING HIS GLORY SAYS AND WE ALL BEHOLDING HIM AS IN A GLASS THERE THAT'S THE TRUE GLORY OF God just as there to to glaze SOMETHING'S FIT WITH GLASS. WE'RE NOT JUST LOOKING into a mirror to see ourselves a as unfinished and see ourselves as raw human beings, but we're actually looking INTO GOD'S GLORY AND WE SAY, "THIS IS WHAT I CAN BECOME." &gt;&gt; In Matthew 5:16, let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven. Glorify [snorts] there means to render, illustrious, to make, to shine, to radiate. How do they do it? By your light. Your light is the glory of God. In John 17:es 1-6, these words spake Jesus and lifted up his eyes to heaven and said, "Father, the hour has come. Glorify thy son that thy son also may glorify thee. Render me ILLUSTRIOUS THAT I MAY SHINE in your great glory." I'm just using these um using these uh these terms of of pottery. This is God now glory says, "I have glorified IT AND I WILL GLORIFY it again." This is this process of making him to shine &gt;&gt; as thou has given him power over all flesh that he should give eternal life to as many as thou has given him. So now there's this power of giving and this is life eternal that they may know thee the only true God and Jesus Christ whom thou has sent. I have glorified thee on the earth. I finished the work which thou gavest me to do. And now, oh father, glorify thou me with thine own self, with the glory which I had with thee before the world was. This is such a beautiful template for what God wants to do in you. You are the temple of the Holy Ghost. Glorify me with your own self. That this light that shines in this end time isn't shining on you, but it shall be risen in you. &gt;&gt; I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world. They thine they were and thou gavest them me and they have kept thy word. Glorify them. He says I have manifested thy name unto them. Name is character. It's its identity. Its presence the light of one's countenance. Beholding that manifestation even for us we say beholding him as in a glass to make to shine. This is what Christ said he's done. Therefore, for us, as we behold God's manifested glory, we're changed. It makes us glorious. Where do we find his glory? It's in his word. &gt;&gt; Well, in the printed pages, it's in the revelation of it. &gt;&gt; It's in the fulfilling of it. And &gt;&gt; so I'd like to I'm I'm going to Lord willing and close here in just a few moments. But I want to come back to where we were Sunday when we were looking at that uh vision that brother Brandham had of that the black mamba that snake which represents sin and death as he tells the story in the sermon paradox. Somehow he came through this narrow highway and and as he's traveling he since there was people were you know something was causing fear and everyone was afraid and scared to death and they were afraid of this giant mamba snake that he said was certain death if it struck you instant death if it bites you and he was going after a brother he says in one place and he says that how that it started to come after brother Brandon but then something was holding it off and then it went after a friend and he said just then the serpent turned to me when I said that and looked at me again and the voice came from above and said you've been given power and he says you know stop that don't don't he's kind of responding to this threat to his friend you've been given power to bind him &gt;&gt; the worst or any so [snorts] it's kind of like this the head this is the top and brother Bam's response well what must I do and again I love the humility of brother Bradam to not just um make this assumption oh well and you know I'll just head plug headlong into it. Well, the truth is is I can bind him. But then you have to have this sincerity to it. He goes, "What must I do?" He said, "There's one thing you must do. You must be more sincere. You must be more sincere." Recall just a few moments ago, we talked about how glazing is like this sealing process. It's a process where it's something is sealed in. Something that you desire to be in there, but also if you're going to seal something in, there's this binding of things keeping things out. Keep things in there. keep things out. &gt;&gt; And here, brother Bam is told, "You've been given power to bind him." Think of it as it represents sin. Death is the consequence of sin. If sin has been dealt with, there is no consequence of death. That's the glory of the cross. &gt;&gt; That sin having been defeated and the price paid. Therefore, there is this revelation to recognize I don't have to die for that sin. So, brother Brandham is told, "There's only one thing you must do. You must be more sincere." And he said, 'I said, 'Well, God forgive me for my uncincerity. Like how he said that uncincerity fits with the nomenclature we've been using. And let me have sincerity. &gt;&gt; And I raised up my hands to him again. There was this great something come over me, just lifted me up. SEEMED LIKE MY WHOLE BODY WAS CHARGED WITH SOMETHING. &gt;&gt; And I looked at the serpent and when he started towards me and he couldn't do it yet. And I said, "Satan, in the name of G the Lord Jesus Christ, I bind you." And the serpent, a blue smoke flew out of him. And he curled up and made that sign like an S, capital S backwards, an and sign amperand. He says it means bind this one or anything below him cuz he was the worst. BLUE SMOKE FELL OUT OF HIM AND HIS TAIL CHOKED HIS OWN SELF TO DEATH around his head and he made this backward s an sign like like a conjunction choked at death and the brother was free. That's quite that's in this vision that's quite a circumstance. He said I bind you in the name of Jesus Christ. There's this power of binding. When he does this there's this kind of this puff this smoke this powder kind of represents the life leaving it and it curls up. It kind of chokes itself and it's twisted around to it looks like that and sign the amperand. He says, "I WENT OVER AND MASHED ON IT." I said, "Now I've got to find out about this because it's a vision." And I hit on the thing and it it turned like looked like a handle on a glass handle on a picture just made it solid crystal. Think of that. Took something living and then when he he spoke to it and he actually caused it to turn to glass. And I said, "Think of that. How quick the blue smoke was life and everything that left it, all the elements, and it turned to glass." There's been a transformation process. &gt;&gt; We're now through the application of the word, through the binding power, this thing that was flesh and moving and had the power to take away life. It is now the life has left it. Those elements have been transformed and it's been turned into glass. He says like crystal. Just then a voice came against says, "You can unbind him also." I said, 'Then, Satan, that I might know, I unbind you.' And when he did, he started coming to life again, wiggling. I'm not going to try to get too bogged down in this, but think of this. He had power to bind in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. But he didn't have to invoke the name to unbind it. &gt;&gt; Because which one of you are going to say, "In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, I want an addiction to those things which I have conquered and overcome. Come back again and cause me to stumble and fall." None of you is going to do it. or none of you. If you're from Missouri, you're not going to do it. Why? You wouldn't invoke the name to do it. But yet in your lips, you have power to resurrect dead natures. &gt;&gt; You have the ABILITY TO SUBJECT YOURSELVES to things that you have absolute power over being a sealed son or daughter of God. So that I might know I unbind you. When it did, he started coming to life again wiggling. I SAID, I BIND YOU BACK IN THE NAME OF Jesus Christ. Let me say this. If you have inadvertently loosed anything in your life that ought not to be loosed in the NAME OF JESUS CHRIST, BIND IT RIGHT BACK AGAIN. &gt;&gt; If you've opened it up through confession, YOU'VE OPENED IT THROUGH ignorance or or negligence or rebellion in the name OF LORD JESUS CHRIST, BIND THAT BACK UP AGAIN. BRING IT UNDER THE BLOOD. &gt;&gt; Don't allow any of these things to exist. Says, I bind you back in the name of Jesus Christ. And when it did, the smoke flew out of him again and he choked himself right back again and turned to crystal. I'm not I'm not pushing it too much. I don't often do this, so you could just let me do it on a Wednesday night with so few here. He glazed them. &gt;&gt; That's exactly what he did. He turned them into glass. &gt;&gt; Said it looked like glass. It looked like crystal. And as he did, he says when he did that, the voice said, "Now you must be more sincere than what you are to do this." What did it take? Sincerity. Sincerity. We have the truth, but we need it with sincerity. &gt;&gt; I need to be I need to be sealed with the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; I need that. I I need God's work in my life to be be rendered sure by the baptism of the Holy Ghost. I don't need religion. I don't need pretense. I don't need politics. I don't need the eagle belt buckle and the Stson hat and and the replica briefcase. I don't need I don't need any of those things. &gt;&gt; I need a genuine experience with Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; That's what I need. And I need sincerity with this message. Brother said, "Don't bring no smut on it." And I don't I don't want the the smut of uh the the the politics and the pretense and the human polishing to try to make it pretty. It's pretty on its own. &gt;&gt; It's beautiful just the way that God intends it to be. &gt;&gt; And so, as brother Brandham is expressing here, this power, this great vision that he shares with us so that we could see an example ourselves here in the end time, there's going to be a translation. THERE'S GOT TO BE POWER over sin and death. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He gave power to bind it. And in doing so, it turned to glass. Revelations 15:es 2:3. John sees this remarkable scene and he says, "And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire." Had the image to me of that glazing process where something that has been fashioned and fitted with this powder of glass has now been mingled with fire to where it's glazed smooth. kind of speaks of a smooth sea, but there's something. It's a sea of glass mingled with fire. And them that had gotten the victory over the beast and over his image and over his mark and over the number of his name stand on the sea of glass having the harps of God. I want you to recognize this. The sea no longer retains the character it once had. &gt;&gt; They're not walking on water. What would have at one time been a sea has now been described as glass because it's been mingled with fire. It's been fit with glass. They have the harps of God. Again, God is an artist. He has his harps. He's a musician. And they sing the song of Moses, the servant of God, and the song of the lamb, saying, "Great and marvelous are thy works, Lord God Almighty. Just and true are thy ways, thou king of saints." The words that are meant here, what John saw as it were, a sea of glass, it's worthy of much more time than we're going to give it now as we close. But this sea was an emblem of sorrow and trouble. Scripturally, it was numbered among the the weaknesses or the deprivation of nature because of its terrible uh terribleness. Scripture and even allegorically, even in literature, it's tied to hunger and thirst and pain. Represents sorrow, WEARINESS, THE UNKNOWN, DARKNESS, THE DEPTHS. It represents death. And to think, as one writer put it, among the gains of heaven, it's recorded, there shall be no more sea. That that's one of the the the pluses to heaven. When he heaven is being described, there's no more sea. So the sea represents something terrible, something dark. Revelations 13 chapter 1, he says, "I stood upon the sand of the sea." So here he is on the sand. He beholds THE SEA AND SAW A BEAST RISE UP OUT OF THE SEA. &gt;&gt; SO IT IS ACTUALLY FROM THE SEA THAT THIS BEAST comes forth. It's &gt;&gt; from the SEA THAT THERE'S DEATH. THERE'S ALL TERRIBLE UNKNOWN THINGS. THERE'S SORROW. THERE'S PAIN. THERE'S HUNGER. THERE'S GREAT TREPIDATION. THERE'S THIS ENDLESSNESS DARKNESS TO IT. The beast rising up out of it. But now in Revelations 15, it says they stand on the sea. Why? It was the sea of glass mingled with fire. It had been permanently changed. He had gone through this process. We say a a an unglazed pot isn't finished yet. We can see that this sea now has has been abolished in Revelations. this the fire of God has completely transformed what would have been this dark water and now it's a sea of glass and now they're standing on it. What does it tell us? There's victory over that serpent. &gt;&gt; There's victory over unbelief. &gt;&gt; Victory over the beast, his image, his mark, &gt;&gt; the number of his name. &gt;&gt; There's power over all that. &gt;&gt; So today spiritually you as a believer, you stand on a sea of glass. That's right. &gt;&gt; You stand on the sea of glass mingled with fire. The soul sealed, Satan sealed out. &gt;&gt; THE SOUL BEING SEALED BY THAT POWER OF GOD, BY THAT SEALING OF THE HOLY GHOST HAS NOT ONLY SEALED INSIDE OF YOU ETERNAL LIFE, BUT IT KEEPS SATAN OUT. &gt;&gt; That's the beautiful IMAGE OF WHAT'S BEING EXPRESSED IN THE SEA OF GLASS. IT DOESN'T RETAIN ITS DEPTHS ANYMORE. &gt;&gt; IT'S NOW GLASS. IT'S THEY'RE NOT WALKING ON WATER. WHATEVER WAS THERE IS GONE. &gt;&gt; It it it exists NO LONGER. &gt;&gt; IT'S NEVER TO RISE AGAIN AND CAUSE TROUBLE. IT CAN NEVER RISE AND BE THE SPECTRE OF DEATH. IT CAN NEVER RISE AND BE THE SPECTRE OF PAIN. THAT IS WHAT'S MEANT WHEN YOU STAND UPON A SEA OF GLASS. THERE HAS BEEN A SOMETHING COME THAT HAS COMPLETELY REMOVED IT ALTO TOGETHER. &gt;&gt; And you as a believer, there's no there's no power of sin and death over you anymore. Amen. &gt;&gt; You stand on a sea of glass. You stand on a solid foundation. &gt;&gt; They stood on it having the harps of God. What a beautiful image. &gt;&gt; Musicians, if you could come to your instruments this evening. I want to present it to you in a number of different ways, but I don't want the glaze of burning lips. I don't want the glaze of vain worship, but my heart be far from God. I want the sincerity. I want to be unwaxed and I want to be unglazed. But then I also I don't want to just be shed of all my pretense and view myself as a broken sinner and think that I could somehow continue to exist in in this sinful state in perpetuity and claim the grace of God. I I've been thinking about it a lot this week and I maybe I probably perhaps I probably should have maybe kind of would have should have written it down. But there's something to be said about how one feels they I come to God and I can come to him with all my sin and all my brokenness. And then when they can retain certain things, it kind of tells you what they think it can tell you what they think it is. That somehow I have been able to be impacted by his presence, look into his word, be changed, make a confession, [music] but then there's all these other things I can continue to exist with, maybe make excuses for. Well, we're all sinners and we all make mistakes and we're always going to do this and there's all this all this ungodliness that what gets what glazed over. And it kind of tells you what they think of Christ &gt;&gt; there. There is no power over that. There is no power over that. There is no power over that. That one ain't doing that. That one ain't doing that. Ain't doing that. Right? There's all these things everyone's doing. Everyone's doing this. Everyone's doing that. THERE'S ALL THESE different things. SAY, WELL, THEY'RE JUST TELLING you what they think is in the word of God. But I believe that we should look at it in the sense of this. This is righteous. This is purity. This is holiness. If I don't see it in me, I believe it can come. &gt;&gt; I believe it can change me. &gt;&gt; So then I want to be genuine and sincere before God, honest about my mistakes and my failures, but I don't want to stay that way &gt;&gt; cuz that's not what I see in Christ. &gt;&gt; I was reading this some of these statements this past week. I just don't know how many we could continue to or how long we'll remain on this subject. I just had one more in in my heart for this Sunday using this process of forming the clay. And it's in the very beginning that a potter [music] will tell you this that if you're going to be using if it's not hand building, but you're going to be using a will, the most important thing you can do is get [music] get that lump right in the center. It's got to be centered. And so if you weren't wanting to come Sunday, you can just tell yourself you've heard the whole just [music] needs to be centered. There's so many different statements, brother. In the sermon identification, it says we want to be make this Bible our looking glass. [music] We want this Bible to be our looking glass and let ourselves be molded by his character. &gt;&gt; I want to see Christ as he is. &gt;&gt; Not how he's rendered in stained glass. NOT HOW HE'S PICTURED BY THE uh the Baroque artist of AGES GONE BY. NOT HOW HOFFMAN would represent him to be. Not not in the beauty of the artist, but I WANT TO SEE HIM AS GOD MADE HIM, AS GOD DESIRES HIM TO BE REVEALED IN HIS WORD, AS GOD HAS EXPRESSED HIM IN THESE LAST DAYS THROUGH THE PREACHING OF THE GOSPEL, THROUGH THE REVELATION OF JESUS CHRIST. I I JUST WANT TO SEE HIM FOR THE BIBLE TELLS ME THAT I SHALL BE LIKE HIM WHEN I SEE HIM AS he is. [music] But if I'm viewing him through a filter, I'm viewing him through prism, if I'm viewing him through a glass darkly, then there's retain some modifications. But I want to look into his glory. I want to look into the glaze. I WANT TO SEE HIM AS he really is &gt;&gt; and let myself be molded by his character &gt;&gt; and having his character, his mind, letting the mind that was in Christ be in us. this fellowship of brother Steven Bryant and he would on the the subject of artificial intelligence and and there's so many different interesting parallels to what the world's trying to do through artificial means and really what it means for the believer to have the mind of Christ to be able to make these calculations and these processes. He says that what was his mind to do? The mind that was in Christ. If we want the mind of Christ in us, he says, what was it to do? What was that mind? Always to stay with the father's word. &gt;&gt; No matter what looked glossy and what looked this way, it didn't make any difference to him. The father's word is what counted. &gt;&gt; Listen, you're kind of you're wired I say kind of. We're wired to the the neon, the flashy, the glamour. All right. If you if our church had a a a a a summer basketball league, right? Fall pickle ball. Write these down. These are great ideas. Coming fresh right now. These coming right here. Get the website going. Arizona believers court. All right. We could do mock trials. We can do pickle ball, basketball. If we had a lot of things to offer, man, we you could have a lot of people coming to like moths to a barn light, right? You hear they have softball. Oh, you hear they hear you all get season tickets to spring training games when you [music] come. There's a lot of ways that you could have cash prizes. People don't know it, but we always put a $100 bill underneath the seats on Wednesday nights. Maybe we do, maybe we don't. There's a way that people would come for those things. He says, "But no matter how glossy what it looked, it doesn't make any difference to him. The father's word is what counted. I trust at the end of the day that's your attraction. &gt;&gt; The word of God is what matters. Everywhere where he met the devil, he never used his power to defeat him, he used the word because that was him. Isn't it great to know that you have been given the word? You haven't been given the same life experience as Jesus Christ. You haven't been given the same birth that Jesus Christ was given. We can't claim all the experiences that he had, but we do have the very same word. And Jesus didn't use his peculiar birth. He didn't use his sinlessness. He used THE WORD TO EXERCISE POWER OVER THE GREATEST, therefore even the least. Says he never wrote a book when he was on earth. As far as we know, he never wrote. But one time that was in the sand. You know, they say that it's the sand that if you expose it to heat, [music] you get it hot enough, it turns to glass because of the silica, because the the particles that are already in it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Says he wrote in the sand, then erased it. says probably afterwards. Why didn't he write a word? Because he was the word. &gt;&gt; You don't have to aspire to some great achievement. Ah, I want to write a book. I want to write poetry. I want to paint a work. I want to do that. No, you don't need to do that. He lived the word. We don't need so many books when you become a written epistle of God. That's what God wants you to be. Images of him. That is what you're called to be. And our whole theme this entire year has been in my mind, well, what does he look like? I believe in my heart I could present any [music] one of you tonight as this is what Christ looks like. Brother Lucas, even 20 years ago when you wore I'm a pepper, right? And it was kind of like I'm a pepper, right? Stand in a t-shirt say that's what Christ looks like in 2001 or whatever it was cuz we got all sorts of IMAGES OF WHAT CHRIST WOULD LOOK LIKE. WHAT WOULD HE LOOK LIKE? What would he look like? He looks like what he looks like when he lives through you. And I want to yield my members to him that he can live through me because what I'm called to be is an epistle of God. I want to [music] be an image of him. And it's going to be this word manifested. Unglazed. I hope so from the world. But I hope that you haven't been untouched by the master's [music] hand. And to the extent that you need to be, trust me, he's willing. He's willing. If we could stand this evening and just [music] express our our love to him and our gratitude to him. Isn't God good to us? &gt;&gt; So kind. He's so gracious. When people ask me how our church is doing, I find myself saying over and over again, God has been so gracious to us. &gt;&gt; So as we worship tonight, just open up your heart to him. A and see yourself as a vessel that he wants to fill and that he wants to use for [music] his glory.
