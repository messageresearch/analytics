TRANSCRIPT
========================================
trust that the Lord will bless those things which we have read and be able to bring something out of it that's a benefit to all of us as you all know the home folk know we've been on the series on the house of the Lord there's a lot of ways that we could address this particular subject the house of the Lord was um when we was established as a Tabernacle in the wilderness we know it represented things it's even made after a pattern in heaven and those things that are in heaven God is wanting to manifest and declare on Earth we even know that eventually the king is going to be a union an eternal Union Between Heaven and Earth so there's a lot of things that are represented in the temple or the Tabernacle and then we come to the New Testament we recognize that the church is the house of God the body of Christ we are the Temple of the Lord and today I want to use the subject of the man of the home and we'll come to that here for in just a moment but Wednesday night we spoke on as for me in my house and we were wanting to make the point that the most important place that the word can be be expressed is in the family in the beginning God created a family not a church and he wasn't just creating a world he wasn't wanting just to create a beautiful garden but the image that he was wanting to express was himself and to do that he created a family and so we know that the family unit was God's first Masterpiece and so the greatest place that we could express the word is in the home and in our relationships one to another and there's a there's a lot of expansion to that if we look at the example of Jesus Christ in Luke Chapter 2 we find him as a 12-year-old boy and he's in the temple confounding the scribes and Pharisees and yet he's kind of separated from his family and his mom and dad as they called themselves uh sought him they finally find him in the temple and and the kind of the question is you know what have you done and you've you've left your father and mother we've been seeking you these many days and his response may seem to be somewhat smart alec but he says you know what do you mean you were looking for me I must be about my father's business I say oh well this is is uh this is what it means to be Christlike is to have this obstinate uh uh dedication to God even if it means it's disrespect to everyone else and there's a lot you might try to draw from that but in the very next verses it says in Luke 2: 51 and 52 he went down with them this is Jesus with Joseph and Mary and came to Nazareth and was subject unto them and the Bible says but his mother kept all these sayings in her heart so the Bible is uh whatever you'd want to draw from that interaction in the temple that day it's not to set forth some pattern where you can just be a rogue you can be on your own you could be a Maverick even Jesus who had a wisdom that could confound the scribes and Pharisees at 12 years old went back with his parents he went down with them to Nazareth and it says he was subject unto them that means he was arranged in an orderly fashion under father and mother the Bible even saying his mother kept all these says in our heart so though she wasn't his natural mother and we know that Jesus wasn't born of the woman in the way that he had her DNA or her genes were used to create him but yet he's arranged under her and her as uh his mother Joseph as his father aranged in an orderly fashion under Authority and that's how a home should be Christ is going to represent and express God's desire and God's pattern and it says in Jesus increased in wisdom and stature in favor with God and man why you say well maybe that's a big question why and it's worthy of a lot of discussion but we recognize that God says he's subject unto them under her father and mother and now his very next testimony is he increases his wisdom stature and favor with God and man so we could say that Arrangement was part of his increase in wisdom it was part of his increase in favor with God and man amen all right good okay just checking if the a manner was working you you I know you were just waiting for an even more profound point after that you said we'll save our amen for the next statement now it we read this in on Wednesday night does God ever change his mind and this is such an outstanding statement he's praying dear Lord Jesus we are assembled again in your name with great expectation for the outpouring of the quickening power of God now if we were to use that phrase and we were to ask what would this look like and what's the mo the greatest manifestation of the outpouring of the power of God that we could see uh in our midst or amongst the people there's a lot of things that we might want to look at visually there might be a lot of things we would expect to happen in a church service it may be dancing or shouting it could be people slain in the spirit uh maybe speaking in tongues or just uh uh some crying and just a release of our emotions it could even be a prayer line or an altar call there might be a lot of ways that the spirit can be outpoured but brother man makes an incredible statement here he says I want to have the outpouring of the quickening power of God which can happen in all those ways to bring us into recognition of our position in place and our responsibilities so this this is something that is as he's saying this now at the end of his ministry that last summer of his ministry and he's saiding I want uh we desire an outpour to the quickening power of God but not just for the moment in a church service but to bring us into a realization recognition of our position and place and our responsibilities and it's the place position and responsibilities of being a called people separated from the world and dedicated to God so we might know that we are a called people we might know that we are separated from the world and we may be dedicated to God but he's saying being those three things a called people separated from the world dedicated to God we need a revelation of our position we need to better understand our place and our responsibilities we've accepted that we're called people we accept that we're separated we accept and we are dedicated we're constantly seeking a greater dedication but he says we bring us into a recognition of our position and I would say that's a prayer that we ought to have for ourselves it ought be a prayer we have for our children it's a prayer that we have together as a church bring us to a revelation and recognition of our place and position that's right and I believe that we all have uh we have a post of Duty and we may use the the comment post of Duty more most frequently in settings like this and we say well I've got a post of Duty and so I want to be at church at my home church on Sunday morning and brother brandham gave a lot of respect and honor to that post of Duty when he would hold meetings in certain areas he'd have Sunday afternoon services so that people could be at the post of Duty in their morning or evening service and so we recognize it has something to do at times with the house of God but you also have a post of Duty as a man as a woman as a child in the word of God we all have post and we have a duty to home we have duties and responsibilities to one another we have a duty to keep order we have a duty to uh cultivate the right kind of Integrity so that we can produce character in our character can be produced in our lives so we need to honor we're this is just some review from Wednesday night we need to honor that post of Duty in the family and in the home and as we've been drawing from uh inspiration in Mark 3:25 and if a house be divided against itself that house cannot stand brother brandham said it's the order the character of the family that makes a house a home so a a house out of order is A House Divided so if you're your if your house is like the ice cream machine in McDonald's it's always out of order then you're A House Divided amen you're a Ronald McDonald House that a house out of order is A House Divided a house incorrectly rearranged I say rearranged because it can be incorrectly arranged a and and that's that's a disorder that God wants to bring order but I believe for most of us God orders our homes but then it can get rearranged a little bit too easily and sometimes we just get these fresh Inspirations I don't know if you like this still like this but I remember as a teenager especially uh there' just be these times you get this inspiration you completely rearrange your room and you'd spend all night to the early morning hours figuring out just the right place to put the bed and move everything around a a and it was always it was always nice to rearrange things it felt like you had a new room and sometimes I think we like to go to tinkering with God's Arrangement or we let the devil come in and rearrange our rooms and rearrange our homes and it's incorrectly rearranged and if that happens it's the wrong kind of order and our emphasis is That's A House Divided and you say well we're not fighting against each other and uh this isn't happening and we don't hate each other we're not cursing each other out and things like that but the house incorrectly arranged or rearranged if there's anybody that's out of their place that's A house divided against itself because pieces that ought to be working in harmony will be out of Harmony and be button against each other or overlapping in ways that they shouldn't I I think that that I think that that makes a lot of sense scripturally but I hope that makes sense to you literally now on the subject of and the title today the man of the home as brother Ram says it's important for us to come to a recognition of our position in place and our responsibilities as being called I could say that we to look at what it means to be a man in his place and how that there are certain roles and responsibilities that a man has to the family and now having said that there might be most of you that just kind of checks out you're like well I'm not I'm not a man today so I don't need to hear this and I would argue that it's applicable and relevant to all of us if you're a daughter in a family uh to understand better the roles and responsibilities of a man will help you in your role as a daughter and it'll help you to understand better what to look for when you when it's coming to that time of of marriage and maybe attraction you want to know what a real man looks like you want to know uh what God calls a man to be and so when we use that phrase man uh there might be a lot of things we think masculinity or manliness there might be a lot of images that we get in our minds but I believe the nominal Christian idea of masculinity is so far from the scriptural masculinity I think I've uh I've used uh preached on it before how it seems as if there's more people today want a Jesus that's like John Wayne instead of a Jesus that was who he was in the scripture and so there's a wrong kind of image we could have about Christ or what it means to be a man but what we want to understand is they the scriptural man the man Christ Jesus and so when we're using this phrase very deliberately the man of the home and I hope that that'll make more sense as we continue all right we ready to go to the next step amen okay good Esther chapter 1 as we already read in the first few verses and we read it just to kind of set the scene uh the King has ordered hos has ordered a uh a feast it's continued on for many many days he's a very powerful man he's having all the most important people in the Kingdom at this Feast he's been drinking a a and when he's married and having a good time this is where we're kind of joining here in verse 9 and also vasy the queen Made A Feast for the women in the Royal house which belonged to King araras and now Vash the word means beautiful and we'll touch on this maybe in a few moments that I want you to see her as a type of good brother talks about a beautiful woman representing Leo DEA and I want you to kind of see this type of Leo DEA which rejects Christ and so it says on the seventh day the King when he had been drinking and been making merry he ordered we'll go to verse 11 that they bring vashy the king queen before the king with the Crown Royal to show the people and the princess her beauty for she was fair to look on so you can kind of get the vibe a little bit the king's been partying for a long time it's just been him and his buddies they've been uh uh and maybe I think even in Jewish tradition they believe that there was an argument about who was had the most beautiful wife or which kingdom had the most beautiful women and he says I'm going to settle this right now I'm going to have my wife come forth and and you're going to see her beauty and you're going to know that she's the most beautiful so kind of in this not necessarily climactic but in this very uh seventh this of this Feast this particular time his heart is so merry he wants to bring his wife forward but it says in verse 12 but the queen Vash refused to come at the King's Command by his chamberlains therefore was the king very wroth and his anger burned in him so what we could see and just distill down in very general terms is the queen which is wife to the King has refused her husband's command in this moment that he desires her this moment that he wants to see her she said says no I'm going to hang out with the ladies in your house and it's important to recognize that this house is the King's house and it's a house that belonged to King araras and that this is uh would have been his home and his house and it would have been his right and she's there uh with the ladies having a party and he says it's I want you to come to the banquet I want you to come and make yourself uh known and she refuses that now if we're going to be honest with the text we could I think we could draw some conclusions that the king may have been a little bit irrational in that moment he has been drinking he's on a bender right I mean this guy's been drinking for a long time the Bible even tells us that the heart of the King was merry with wine let's just say he's drunk right he's feeling the he's fing the liquor a and he and maybe get a little bit boastful and he may have been a little irrational or not in control of his sensibilities and it might have been disrespectful for him him to ask for her to come is this a little bit too out of pocket for some people to kind of give this Heathen King a lookover you know I I I'll say this now well you know if you're getting in trouble you might as well just lean into it right you just well maybe I won't do that all right we'll save it for a whole another series a really long one give myself plenty of Runway give you plenty of rope to hang me that gets you thinking but let's let's just think about it the king's having a party with the fellow was and then he asked his wife to come and and this is quite a request and I wanting to at least suggest that the king in doing this isn't necessarily a sober husband this is getting real very fast right he's not he he may not even be asking something that's the best for the moment because of his drunkenness and because of the setting but the Queen's refusal to come was also disrespectful there might have been a lot of reasons for her to think well I don't want to go and I don't want to do this but it would it was unwise for her to refuse the King's Command and I want to suggest this that it would would not have been wrong for her as his wife to comply I know you're thinking maybe we don't normally get this deep into it 20 minutes in but we're there in Genesis 3:1 16 at the time of the ab banishment of the man and the woman from the garden and the Judgment upon the earth and the Serpent and the Sorrows to come upon the woman and the man says unto the woman he said God speaking I will greatly multiply thy sorrow in thy conception in sorrow Thou shalt bring forth children and now notice this phrase and thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee I'm glad that we're reading what God Said and knowing how the denominations work this these days they'll say well it's not in red right and they take exception to the fact that it's not in red but God says then thy desires shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee it's a very unique phrase to make this commandment to the woman that thy desire shall be to thy husband and part of its meaning and the emphasis is that you need to willingly yield to your husband's desire that as a woman that you are liable to be controlled by his will that's a scary proposition let's just all admit to it that any one of us man or woman if we were to be put into position where you are going to make yourself vulnerable enough to be led guided or submit to another person's will that's what God is saying about the woman he's saying thy desire shall be to thy husband in other words you are to be controlled by his desire and you must willingly yield to his will or his desire and he shall rule over thee which is in plain language have dominion have reign in lordship over thee in other words it means to rule means to have supreme authority so the man has to have supreme authority in the marital relationship now everybody getting nervous anybody getting nervous I look out and I see all family here even the visitors are family so we're we're good I I don't want to have a viral moment here so stick with me this is this content's not suitable for Tik Tok you need to get the whole thing this is not a YouTube short I am a short preacher but that just has something to do with my height now this is the divine order after the fall this is God saying in light of the fall in light of the things that are going to exist in the world that you're going to be coming forth in God had to arrange the man and the woman in a particular way we could go back into the original and say the woman was taken from his side they were co-equal they were Partners in a very beautiful arrangement but after the fall God says I I need to do something which is part of the Plan of Redemption I need something to be expressed in order to get it back to what it was before so he saying that we have in this life this arrangement to where your desire is to be to thy husband in other words you need to willingly yield and be liable and vulnerable to his desire to where if he has a desire that's different than yours that you're there's this possibility and this potential that you're going to need to yield to that desire and he will have supreme authority over you now now going back to vashy or vashy however you want to say it her refusal and in the Jewish tradition is they tell the story and they kind of have some crazy ideas about it I guess but and one of the things that they're uh that they have part of their tradition is that it wasn't um because of modesty that she refused to come and know she wasn't going oh you know I'm just a lady and I don't want to be seen with a bunch of drunk men and and and I don't want to do this as a matter of fact that there's some things that the Jews build into the lore of the story which clearly tells us that she wasn't being modest at all so she didn't refuse because of modesty and for her to have obeyed as the queen for her to have obeyed would not have marred her testimony if you look at the situation and here's a man that's drunk and here's a man that's calling for his wife and if she would have come nobody would said oh and clutching pearls and been so disappointed that this woman would obey her husband that the queen would come at the King's Command it would not have marred her testimony to obey her husband's command as a matter of fact it would have been in the very IM of Genesis 3:16 that in that moment she's yielding her own desire she's leaving her own party and she's obeying the King's Command now we could take some time to look at how that the leod dean church is depicted here because it rejects the king we see the spirit of the leodan age is exhibited in uh the queen and this is that's the spirit we all fight against that's the spirit that's on the age it's the image that raises up in in this age is this image of a woman this independent woman this leis this divorced woman of great power in the scripture or historically this is the representation in this queen who refuses the King's Command there is a representation of the spirit we all fight man or woman so think of that you're fighting in this end time a perverted Spirit brother brandham says and recognizing your day and its message he said he showed me this is in the preview of the Bride uh that gives in a few places there that summer he showed me a a church he showed me each church as they've come up out of the ages and we know that procession he says and oh how vul vulgar and the last one was this last day Church age which was led by a witch it's quite a statement now that as it comes to and you recall just how vulgar she was and how she was dancing and scantily clothed and it was this culmination of all these secession of Ages where brother bam sees this like this is the worst and then he has this kind of this Dawn on him is this what my ministry's produced is this what comes out of the Leo Dean Church age and then the voice says the bride shall come in preview again why because God's going to call a bride out of that out of that immodesty and and into a bride age but notice it's led by a witch but let's do the math it's led by a woman right and he saidwell how did how did he know she was a witch because it was a woman that was leading it wasn't because she had a was green skinned and you know and a hook nose and she was leading on a broom and brother Brown she's like oh it's a witch no just the fact that a woman was leading the church was all he needed to know to know that that woman was a witch this is good stuff I'm getting Goosebumps but I don't know if it's cuz my Spidey Sense tells me someone's going to throw something at me but this is something very profound when you think about brother brandham didn't have to see a black cat he didn't have to see a big cauldron with rat tails and snails or whatever stirring this Brew for him to go oh I think This Woman's a witch the fact that she was out of her place leading a church is all that we needed to know that it was a witch because she was a woman who was in the wrong office and we could do a little bit of Deep dive on witches I'll save it for October but there was a a an article in the New York Times a couple years ago and the title was the witch continues to enchant as a feminist symbol and if you do some more Scholastic research I even think that uh one of the mantras of some of the modern feminist movements was uh we are the daughters of those you tried to burn uh a and they kind of just calling we we're the the modern witches the daughters of those that you've tried to condemn in the past so this Witchcraft and these the the and the witches have become a symbol of feminism and feminist power and one article said the symbol of the witch has endured over centuries as a representation of female empowerment as The Outsider with uncanny power the witch represents a challenge to patriarchal narratives and that's a mouthful right witches versus the patriarchy the the glorious witch you know Ruth Bader Ginsburg right there's this H uh there's this image and this character of a woman in power who has this she's an outsider she's a Maverick I was trying to think yesterday and I didn't want to Google this I guess I could have asked h a co-pilot or chat GPT are there any witches in fiction that were ever married and I don't need answers but just off the top of your head you begin to realize that a lot of this is just my extensive knowledge in witches comes from Disney I don't know any that are married am I right does anybody can anybody so most commonly right witches are not married they're not mothers they're not you know they're not uh uh at stay atome right so this is the image of a witch and it represents a challenge to the patriarchy or to patriarchal narratives and that that's a pejorative that's a a negative term it's used as a the patriarchy is a term to refer to H misogyny or these chauvinist who want to bring women dis take away their power subjugate them to to Abus and things but the the phrase that's used even about feminism is it's it's a religion and even as its imagery in uh as these witchcraft it's a religion they say conceived in rebellion and that's there no wonder which would become the symbol because in Samuel he tells us that Rebellion is as a sin the sin of Witchcraft and so what does it mean to Rebel to fight against an established order right to Rebel is to go against a rule to Rebel is to go against the way something should be or or or or a government or authority and so witchcraft is the sin H H uh Rebellion is the sin of Witchcraft and again I know that in our minds we want to think about some sort of essential o oils and herbs and things like that and and how we might put together a tea to drink uh to get rid of our bunions but it's it's just a a rebellion against an order or a rule and that's what would make witchcraft I I know what you're thinking I thought we were going to talk about the man of the house not the The Witch of the castle or wherever where do witches live covens whatever they're called in the broom closet now now that we kind of have this picture here of the queen rebelling against the king if you'll if we'll skip to verse 17 the kind of the discussion amongst the chamberlains is whoa this isn't good because the word's going to get out we know that you've asked for her to come and she's refused and now this is wanting to get into this so we can understand the severity of this he says for this deed of the queen this is the the words that's coming to advise the king this deed of the queen shall come abroad unto all women so that they shall despise their husbands in their eyes when it shall be reported that King aerus commanded vashi the queen to be brought in before him but she came not to say that they shall despise their husbands in their eyes it means they'll look down at them with contempt right they will make light of their Authority they'll refuse to give the honor that's due all it would take is for the president's wife or the queen or someone in power somebody visible an influencer to do something in a way that shows that this is what a wife can do this is within her power and she can get away with it if we just want to use that phrase uh they are going to other women will see what the queen has done and because of her influences they will be in contempt of their husbands and they will not honor their husbands as they ought to and so this is an act of defiance against an established order in verse 18 they continue likewise shall the ladies of Persia and media say this day unto all the king's princes which have heard of the deed of the queen thus shall there arise too much contempt and wrath every that's not going to be good for all these homes right it's not GNA be good for a prince who thinks he's a prince to come home and have the his wife uh telling him what to do so this is she's looking down on him he's going to look down on her it's going to lead to a quarrel and a fight it's going to get nasty and whether you want to argue that the men are out of their place or it's the women that are out of their place we can at least accept that they recognized that if things got out of order it would get chaotic and there was a recognition of the corrupting nature of this type of example that if a woman could act against the order that God had established and we can look we'll look deeper in the scripture to see that this is this is scriptural that the woman being arranged in a particular way to the man that if she could buck up against that and she could resist that then it would have a domino effect and be corruptive to other people so it says in verse 19 if it pleased the king Let There Go a royal commandment from him and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the mes that it be not altered that Vash I come no more before King Aeros and let the King give her royal State unto another that is better than she well that's quite a statement and essentially it's saying that the king divorce her and marry again and when and then we might we could he we could argue that's pretty harsh it says and when the king's decree which he shall make shall be published throughout all his Empire for it is great all the wives shall give to their husbands honor both to great and and small so making no distinction whether you're a king whether you're a prince or whether you're nobody wives shall give their husband's honor both whether you're great or small honor is to be due and the saying pleased the king and the princes and the King did according to the word of micin for he sent letters un all the king's provinces and every Province according to the writing thereof and to every people after their language that every man should bear rule in his own house that it should be published according according to the language of every people this is the ultimate standard that vashy rejected this is the ultimate thing that she violated is to not be in harmony with her husband act against his desire to dishonor him to look down upon him to bring contempt and to conjure wrath and and now this is bringing it back to the Baseline this is what was in danger of being eroded that the women should give honor to their husbands whether they be great or small both the women or the man and that every man should bear rule this is the rule that was in danger of being eroded that every man should bear rule in his own house and the Jewish tradition and some of the uh History built around this and even I think Joseph Josephus makes reference to How It Was Written that the woman was to honor and to learn his language and his Customs a lot of things that are very striking in this but to Bear rule that means to be Prince to be Lord to be master we know brother bam often makes reference to the fact that Sarah called Abraham Lord as that's because he was her Lord so this this isn't a strange uh scriptural principle that the man would be Lord or Master the one whose commands are obeyed for him to be honored within the family and that he should bear rule in his own house it means that it would be the family is subject to him that he is the one that rules in the home so if he ask the wife to do something we're given the general rule if you ask the wife to do something that she would do it in Ephesians chap 5:22 so we could see that this is a scriptural principle and I would hope that you're taking this all on its face what the Bible is saying and and and knowing that you have a rich history in scripture in the message of the hour that I'm not going to I'm not trying to paint a picture which is um an abusive uh narrative or that is kind of the things that often happens where there's a dictator and the man doesn't matter what kind of man he is he's to rule and he only points to the rule for his authority instead of character and we're coming to this because we're talking about the man of the home but I think it's important to establish some of these things in scripture now in Ephesians 5:22 it says wives submit yourselves un your own husbands as unto the Lord they see the the the image there wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands so you there's you have your own husband as unto the Lord that's saying that there's a submission that you're going to do to your husband in the same way that you would submit to the Lord now that's quite a standard the husband here in the language that's being used it's the male head of the house the household of the family the one that has been given the that gives the family name he's the master submit unto your own husbands that husband is the master of the house we're looking at now the place and position of the man within a relationship within a family within the house he wives are to submit to voluntarily arrange themselves together with the husband in Harmony and continuity not to be divided not to have separate Ambitions and separate goals but to be arranged together brother Bram in the sermon adoption part three says do you know it's wrong mister for you to continue to smoke and act the way you do quite a question do you it's wrong for you not to be the husband of your house ah he's kind of putting he's putting smoking you a man smoking and physically defiling his body on par with an he to not be the husband of your house and he says your wife get a little temper spell and kick you out the door and you say yes bless your heart honey I'll I'll come right back right we joke all the time I'm going sleep on the couch or I'm in the dog house can't remember which brother it was that was telling me how that just in and uh since the Advent of television that most of the television shows uh always kind of characterize the husband as just being a buffoon a bumbling idiot right you know just a a guy who just works and comes home and drinks beer and the wife's the one that manages everything she's the one that's uh she's the mother and she's doing all the one doing all the hard work the one that's wise the one that's smart and and men are just right they just like tools and and alcohol and sports and uh some of your wives are probably thinking that's all they talk about anyways except for the alcohol maybe rubbing alcohol I don't know but there's a he says do you know what's wrong for you not to be the husband of your house your wife get a temper and she's he's saying and you're you just demure to her and she tells you what to do how can you be a tender at the house of God when you can't even control your own house drawn back on scripture how can a man have his place and position in the house of God when he doesn't even know his own place in his own house so the man can't say well you you need to listen to me you need to listen to me I'm a pastor and it's like that that doesn't work at home any Authority and any uh any testimony that the man would have as a as an officer whether it be Pastor all the way down you name it is going to be derived at how he carries himself privately in his public relationships and he doesn't point to the fact that he's a deacon to get away with murder in his private life he lives a clean life he lives subject to the Lord and He humbles himself he repents if he makes mistakes and has a testimony and that's what qualifies him for office am it's almost as if we kind of work it in opposite now to where if you have a if you're a deacon if you're a pastor if you're a trustee if you're in that that upper cross that Echelon that that that click you can get away with anything you want and you're absolved you're absolved from your adulteries you're absolved from your criminal Behavior absolved from your lack of character you're absolved from your wrath and your fornication you're absolved what because the office wipes the Slate clean when it should work exactly the opposite that someone is living a life and they have a test doesn't mean they're mistake free but they're living a life and they have a testimony and the Bible says proven and that's what you why you can trust them in the office and would you agree we've seen too much of it working the opposite amen amen how can you be a tender at the house of God when you can't even control your own house that's exactly right do you know sister that your husband is not only your husband but he is your ruler God said so do you know that your husband is not only your husband but he is your ruler now I know the thoughts just start rattling off and for those of you who are wives I I I'm not being a wife I can't really think like that but I can imagine that you begin to think about your spouse and your relationships and your unique circumstance and things like this it could cause your heart to race a little bit right cuz not everybody um is in relation some some are divorced some are in relationships where they're they're not on the same page doctrinally some don't have have unbelieving spouses and anytime you talk about this you're going to find people that are kind of outside the general order and the general rule and let's just agree it's challenging isn't it it's challenging but there's a truth that remains despite believer or unbeliever there's a role and we maybe we can get into it more later on the woman but we're wanting to look at the man of the house and we'll get there the man of the home we'll get to the man but we see how the man you're supposed to be the husband of the house you're to control your own house and so he says sister your husband is not just your husband a spouse someone who's you shared his last name now but he's your ruler verse 23 of Ephesians 5 for the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body so the head therefore as the church is subject unto Christ so let the wives be to their own husbands in everything this is what qualifies the character of the submission wives submit your husbands as unto the Lord in the same way that the church is subject unto Christ now we think of that and we say that's absolute submission that's total dependence that's absolute vulnerability what are you as a Christian without Christ what are you as the bride without a bridegroom what are we as the body of Christ The Church Without Our Savior without our husband Christ so that's that's quite a statement to make the the as the church is subject to Christ wives should be subject this is this voluntary attitude of yielding this act of honoring and respecting their husband says in everything says of Christ in Colossians 1:18 and he is the head of the body of the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead he's the head of the body that means the Supreme in anything the chief The prominent one of persons it means he's the master and the Lord he is the head of the body the church that in all things he might have the preeminence that's right this is what Christ is to the church he's the head he's the preeminent one he's the master he's the chief and as he is the head of the body to the church and all things he might have the preeminence so he's the preeminent one he's the supreme authority the image that Paul is drawing is that wives are to be submissive to their husband in the same way now is that what the Bible saying amen it's what the Bible is saying brother bradam in the sermon thirsting for Life says and you men that'll let your wife do that I believe he's talking about smoking in this particular instance and there's other uh other places where he's talking about letting the woman dress a certain way and act a certain way he says and you men that'll let your wife do that that show shows What You're Made Of made out of that shows what kind of man you are he says a man is the head of the family he's the head of the house this is what we're looking at as this head he is the head of the house as Christ is the head of the body he's the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church says he says but today the woman's the head of the house head of the factory head of the church and everything else because it's become a conglomeration of sin I like that phrase the conglomeration it's disorder it's chaos everything's turned upside down he says she's the head of the house he says the head of the factory the head of the church everything else because it's become a conglomeration of sin and it's happened listen it's happened no matter how much leadership in many churches can be misogynistic and abusive and see be M dominated and kind of give off this air of male superiority a lot of times with churches like that it's the women that are running it because it's a perverted Spirit some of the the the harshest some of the harshest Ministries can be dominated by a lesbian Spirit not a brute man but a lesbian spirit because it's a witch trying to abuse and control the woman the church W breakout session we need to talk about that right don't we that's getting some people's wheels are turning he says and Satan took eve and he's still using her in America as a woman's Nation again we're talking about the man of the home not the Le deing woman but we're seeing an image a spirit rising up and we see brother Bram saying the man ought to be the head of his home but the woman's wanting to take that place he should be the head of a church head of a factory but it says with this conglomeration of sin the woman has been thrust into a position she's in a role things are happening as a matter of fact they can trace back the Advent uh uh of some women empowerment and even the birth control and things like that to the woman being drawn into the the workforce as a result of War right and say oh well these wars and these forces that were taking place and these uh uh woes that are taking place and these seals being temporary open we're thinking oh it was all DEC create this but what did It ultimately do move the woman out of her position National Force forcing a woman into the workforce things happening and so Satan's ultimate objective wasn't to blow everything up with nuclear bombs but it was to get people out of their place and out of their position I say it was part of it in 1 Corinthians chap 11:3 says I would have you know that the head of every man is Christ and the head of the woman is the man and the head of Christ is God now that ought to just seal it right there to know that Christ's head is God so even with Christ there's headship there's order and it says the head of the woman is the man now speaking within the marital Arrangement the union of a man to a woman within the household he's saying the man is the physical provider he's the spirit spiritual provider and protector of his wife and his family that's what he's tasked with he's tasked with providing spiritually and physically he's task with protecting and looking out over this is the role of the man he's to do this he's to feed and to clothe he's to look uh protect there's a lot of things that the man is called to do he says the man is the head of the woman The Protector the lifegiver and it says in brother brand I'm writing this in the chapter six of the church age book it is the word that rules us not men that that hopefully it starts turning turning things a little bit the word rules us not men so it's got to be word now aen and keep that phrase in mind we're going to be coming back to a principle before we close now a man as a husband is head of the woman he rules her I know that's heavy language but the church is a woman too and her ruler is the word Jesus is the word if she rejects the word and takes any other headship she is an adulteress she would be that wit she'd be in Rebellion if she rejects the word and takes any other headship she's an adulterous so we see the queen rejecting the headship of her husband and and the husband putting her way in divorc now I know that's strong language but let's just look at it for what the principle teaches us now you name me at one church that hasn't given up the word for tradition and Creeds they are all adultes like mother like daughter so notice this the the characterization of rejecting the word rejecting headship rejecting rule Bram shown that the church is subject to Christ Christ is the word so we must be submissive to him in all things that's the ultimate that's the true then there's a type we take away from that to begin to understand what can be achieved and what ought to exist within the arrangement of the man to the woman the man is the head of the woman he says he rules her but let me say this this just isn't mere human hierarchy right because if you do that we could say oh well if the church is a woman the man is to be the head of the woman and brother Bram saying no it's the word we believe in the leadership of men but it's the leadership of Man by the word so that it's not the man leading but the spirit or the word so there's a there's an order that's being established it's just not hierarchy it's not patriarchy I I it's it's not just to establish the woman as submissive and the man is dominant that's not the case at all but it's just the proper order of things it's the critical Order of Things it's the way that God desires things to be arranged now I hope this isn't too much of a a step but I feel like I just need to point to this I I'm making good time I think I'm going to be able to finish today and and so if I need to stop early I will I'm not worried about uh opportunities to minister on this subject so if we need to stop we will but now let's just take a look very practical in the scripture 1 Corinthians chap 14: 34 and 35 this is this is looking at the order of things Paul says let your woman keep silence in the churches for it is not permitted unto them to speak be they are commanded to be under obedience as also saith the law now what would they be what is he referring to that there to be under obedience and he says this is what the law says so he's referring to something that I would say is greater than just the written law as given to Moses but the law of God where the woman is to be arranged with the man and her desires to be to her husband and he is to rule over her says so he says it's as if he anticipates the objection that well what if the woman doesn't understand what should she do if the preacher preaches and she doesn't understand shouldn't she ask for clarification shouldn't she speak shouldn't she try to get uh uh get better you know try to bring some things out he says and that they will learn anything let them ask their husbands at home for it a shame for a woman to speak in the church so he anticipates the objection well what if women don't understand he says ask your own husbands in particular at home now again I say this is that that general rule that general order this is the way that it ought to be this is the way that you would you should want it to be that the women are to be under obedience as saith the law they're to keep silent in the churches they're not permitted to speak but if they if they're to learn they're to ask their husbands at home now what would you think if a wife said I'm not going to ask my husband anything he's a spiritual idiot I mean what would you think about that my husband doesn't know anything I'm not going to ask him I'm more spiritual than him what what attitude is going to be conveyed when you hear that do you find yourself saying man that sister's so Godly I mean a young man's probably thinking if I hope I find me a Wicked Witch of the East when I get older I want a nose just like that where do you find these green skinned women there's nobody that wants that it doesn't speak well it may be the truth he could be a nitwit he may be a loser he may be unfaithful he may be there may be a lot of things but what does that say about a woman who can just so quickly throw her husband under the bus I know some guys just sleep under the bus it's like they just arrange themselves under it uh but there's a certain way that you can an attitude talking about an attitude and Paul is saying that a woman should keep silent in church and learn from her own husbands in particular I'm just saying what Paul said 1 Timothy 2: 11 12 and 13 let the woman learn in Silence with all subjection but I suffer not a woman to teach nor to usurp authority over the man but to be in silence for Adam was first form then Eve again this is just uh more parallel to First 1 Corinthians 14 let the woman learn in Silence with all subjection to be under obedience as saith the law uh that your desires to be to your husband he shall rule over you wives be submissive to your own husbands as unto the Lord and and so let wives be to their own husbands in everything subject this is the principles in the scripture now being applied even in the house of the Lord that a woman should learn in science with all subjection to their husbands it says let not a woman teach nor to usurp Authority over the man now that's a phrase that is so unique it means one who with his own hands kills another or himself one who usurps authority over the man it's one who either with their own hands kills somebody else or kills thems and that's exactly what a woman would do is she removes the head she kills herself it's one who acts on his own authority one who op uh operates absolute power to exercise dominion over one so when we say that a woman is not to teach we think well a woman shouldn't be behind the pulpit there's no such thing as women preachers in the Bible and the usurping authority of a man I know a lot of times we view that as the woman in the Pulpit teaching but it's actually any woman who's not in subjection a woman who is not under obedience as sayith the law it's a woman who's now ex exercising her own dominion over a domain that's not hers amen it's a woman who's taking the the one who with his own hands kills another that's to remove the lifegiving force who kills another or themselves so it's intruding in an office that's not theirs to usurp Authority is just to assume a position that you shouldn't assume because every place and position has roles and responsibilities and brother brand messes continues to address this in the thotran church age he says now a woman is not meant to have an iron disposition ition she is according to the Holy scripture to be submissive to the male this is with all subjection and the woman is to be ruled by the word the woman to keep silent to be under obedience there's a lot a lot of scriptures here as we're trying to read this wives submitting to your own husbands let your wives be subject to your husbands and everything you hear you know the scriptures we're reading these now brother Bram says according to the scripture she's to be submissive to the male this is commanded of her woman who's truly female all female will be of that disposition so there's this iron disposition which would be that Rebellion that sin of Witchcraft that resist headship or structure or order that resist being in her place that wants to take control or intrude in the office that wants to be the leader that wants to have the power that wants to dominate and and and have the Dominion that wants to usurp authority to exercise control in domains that are not hers he says a woman who is all female will be submissive not dominant well not will be soft and and not of an iron disposition but he says a very important phrase not a doormat no real male makes a female a doormat so let me say this sometimes things get hard because you stamp on them and ground that was otherwise soft can get very very hard if you trample on it long enough but a true woman she will want to be under Authority and not rule over the male for he is the head of the house this is a desire I believe that every daughter of God has she doesn't want to be in that position but sometimes a man's own Disobedience puts a woman in that position Abigail should have never been in the position she was in the scripture there's times even as brother Chris Kavanaugh was bringing out there's things sometimes you have to do in a moment and you you act and you pray you intercede you do something a and and you're not out of your place you're doing things that you have to do and sometimes men put women in positions to do things that they otherwise shouldn't be asked to do and having to do it will make their disposition hard because they're laboring under a strain and a burden that they shouldn't have to labor under but a woman should would want to be under Authority she she wants to yield to the head of the house if she breaks that image that God made for her she is perverted so the woman not being her place perverts the image of God she breaks that image if she usurps Authority if any of these scriptural images that we've expressed so far are not uh in in harmony with the her action she she's perverted she breaks the image then he says any male that lets the woman take authority has also broken that image and he is perverted so the responsibility it's not entirely upon the woman that there he lets the woman take the authority it's not that she threatens with the cast iron pan to take it just you in not assuming the Authority or doing what you ought to do she takes it because someone has to somebody has to say something so I don't want us to get this picture that it's just the woman wrestling for it fighting for it taking it stealing it doing all sorts of things uh sometimes it's it's picked up out of necessity and so a man who lets the woman or causes or forces a woman to break that image he breaks the image and he is also perverted that's right because for a woman to step into that role means it's a woman exercising Dominion so it's a dominating female and it can't have the right nature it can't have the right nature attached to it because it's in an office that her nature God divided male and female there's this the the the the nature of a man is to have the Dominion so he's the one that has the correct authority to have dominion so whenever and he can do it without dominating but as soon as the woman has Authority in Dominion it becomes dominating that's why that spirit that dominates is that female Spirit not a true masculine Spirit brother brah said being a dominating female is Antichrist think of that being a dominating female is Antichrist it's not even say a dominating male it shows that Spirit behind it he says dominating female do you know how do you know how to finish a dominating female is the greatest curse in the world a dominating female is the greatest curse in the world take the name of Jesus with Hallelujah now let me Sprint to a close since we're just all comfortable and so light now and just just enjoying church just loving the the bond of unity that we all have and just feeling closer to one another and a whimper Ephesians 523 it says for the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church hallu and he is the savior of the body my title today was the man of the home not the male of the house man's headship is defined by the headship of Christ over the church and the same way that a woman's submissiveness is qualified in the church is submissive or the body submissive to the Head Christ we say oh the woman needs to be submissive in all things the woman needs to do this as the church does to Christ now it turns it around it says but the man as a head needs to love like Christ needs to be a savior like Christ it qualifies his rule when he says he's the man of the house he needs to be a man like Christ when he rules the woman he needs to rule like Christ and so we've got a lot of images of what the woman needs to look like to submit like the church us to Christ but listen it starts with the head he's not asking the women to submit without first telling the men to rule the right way right he recognizes that this would be this would be uh the king and queen all over again you got a drunk man demanding his drunk wife to show up to a party and she's with the ladies and she doesn't want to come he's like bring her to me I want to see her she's like I'm not going over there right it's just going to be a fight I'm divorcing you go ahead right this is this is what you could expect in that scenario so he doesn't just say well you're the King live however you want I believe that if there was counsel to be given to the king it been like you know there's a way that you can respect your wife there's a time and a moment that's appropriate in other words there's a qualification of what that headship looks like the Bible says the head of every man is Christ so oh the woman the woman I'm the head of the woman I that's the way that it ought to be brothers okay good I like that nobody's afraid to say Amen that we we would want to say that I am the head of my wife therefore she looks to me as the head the supreme authority uh that in all things I as the husband might have the prence and I know it kind of makes some people get a little bit uncomfortable but we're looking at that's what the Bible's saying that it ought to be that the man is the head of the woman but it doesn't paint a partial picture that in that Arrangement if we do it this way and this hierarchy but let's just say the man is the head of the woman it's also saying that Christ is the head of the man if Christ isn't the head of the man it's not right it's a different order it's a different Arrangement that's what causes problems Christ needs to be the head of the man and all the sisters said amen the husband is the head of the wife but Christ ought to be the head of the husband if not he can't be a lifegiver if not he can't be a protector he can't be a provider he can't be a sanctifier because Christ it says about Christ example in Ephesians 5:29 that he did no man ever hated his own flesh but he nourisheth and cherisheth it even as the Lord the church so the Lord nourishes the church he cherishes the church he clothes he feeds he looks out after it as his own flesh so any man that demands headship or exercis his rule that is unlike Christ is perverting headship he's perverting the image as we read already that he says that not a doormat a woman is not called to be a doormat that means you're not called to try to put her under your feet or under your thumb cuz that's not what it means to be the head brother B says you're supposed to be the boss of the house you are the ruler the Bible said the man shall rule not a dictator now a floor matat he made him a helpmate a sweetheart that's the attitude remember it's the word that rules us not men amen so then I have to take this I have to take this understanding as a man that yes I'm called to be a ruler I'm called to be a husband I'm called to be one in Authority but I can't do it I can't do it in my own image I've got to be under the word because I need to be ruled by the word otherwise my rulership will be just human hierarchy and it'll be a man that's merely leading the woman and that's still not the image that God wants Amen in God's order if I could put this way supreme authority looks very differently than what it looks like in a worldly image and a worldly image in a cultures the male is the dominant one and he can dominate all he wants and he can say whatever he wants and get away whatever he wants and he's and he's just dominating but in the word where you see headship where you see a ruler you must see Christlike character because I want to say it this way I think this is where we we're going to be able to close in this a dominating female is a double perversion because a man shouldn't be dominating anyways right right so for a man to dominate a man to make it a doormat a man to exercise Dominion because bless God I'm the man and as brother Jason point out in the scripture that the Gentiles exercise Dominion through this hierarchy this ranking this Authority that's just that's just by by law and by rule but there's a certain way that God wants there to be Harmony and continuity and Arrangement uh and Order where the man is the leader and he's the head but it's to serve it's for the health of the body the health of the marriage the health of the family not for the health of the man and so we'll get into it more maybe in the future on this on this example of Christ but when you have a man that's dominating he's already perverting because if his in his Dominion he's dominating he's broken the order so for there to be a dominating female it's a double perversion but Christ headship as Christ even as Christ that must be our standard even as Christ and if you look at the example of Christ I want to we'll look at it in Greater detail I think next Sunday the Lord would allow us he's one that took responsibility to be a man you're not going to be selfish you're not going to act like a child you're it's not going to just be about you but there's going to be a looking outward and a realization that as the head I have the greatest responsibility as I close in John chapter 19: 4 and 5 it says pilate this is at the crucifixion of Christ at the time that he's crucified and he's being taken back and forth between rulers and tribunals pilate therefore went forth again and said unto them this is now what he says to the people behold I bring him forth to you that you may know that I find no fault in him why is there no fault because he's the truth says then came Jesus forth wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe and it's this phrase and pilate saith unto them behold the man what a statement could you can we let this just sink in as we close this Christ who is the head of every man Christ who is the head of the church Christ who is the head of the body the one that the body serves the one to whom the woman is submissive to the one to whom the church is uh uh subject to in all things in that image now the man who is going to be the head of the woman has to do it like this man the man amen behold the man the man who has taken responsibility for whose Sins not his own but ours the one who said even though come on I hope you can get this even though I'm not at fault I'll take responsibility maybe I'm not directly at fault but I'll take responsibility I'll say that it starts with me and it also ends with me and I'm not going to pass it up what a statement to say behold the man amen and that's why we could see brother bradam saying it we could understand this statement with when we make it that a man or a father or a husband who won't stand his position is a poor excuse for a man because a man isn't always Burly a man isn't always Gruff a man isn't always a hunter a man isn't always in the masculine image we like to make him out to be guns and things and War and and flags and those things no no no no a man is one who's Christlike because that's the man the image of Christ the nature of Christ and brother Bram says about Jesus Christ and how can I overcome in the presence of hell he defeated hell and overcome hell yes in the presence of the Grave he overcome the grave he says why and he's asking how how did he do it right Five Hour Energy little bit of oricle rain or whatever it is did he did he pop some pills did he get psyched up did he play his fight song his walk how did he do it it was it training was it rigor was he was he strong was he smarter did he did he uh read sunsuits The Art of War how did he do it brother man says all by the word and humility how is it that men are going to be not just a male in a house but the man of the home by taking submitting ourselves to the word letting Christ the word be our head by the word and humility being subject ourselves and not just being humble to the word but humble enough to serve of those you're called to be ahead to says Oh by the word and humility oh my there's the real man that's right there's the one to make your example this is the example for men this is the man of the home this is the man that we want to make our example if I can say that this is the measure of a man and I'm when I talk about the man of the home I'm talking to the men that are here you young men are men in training there's a way you ought to conduct yourself I trust that you have examples in the home of how a man treats a woman kind of respect that a man ought to have for other people and I hope that you're beginning to realize now at the I hope the greatest realization is for men to recognize just how important their office is because if a woman serves God as she serves you if you're the wrong kind of head you put her in a very difficult spot that's right because a woman is to be a certain way and she's to live a certain way and she's to submit and she has to have an attitude of willing to be subject to your will you better be sure your will is the right one if she's going to yield to you you want to do everything you can to make it easy on her to yield not a pushover but neither is she to be a doormat brother Bram says and is your life worthy worthy of the Gospel may you men that's got wives and let them be the boss of the house and lead you around May the god of heaven give you Grace to set your foot down and bring the woman back to her right mind again and realize that that's your place in Christ what's it going to take the grace I he says says put your foot down you know it's not go home and be like right you say woman things are changing around here right that's not what he means he says realize your place not a boss but you are the head of the house the analogy the image even the example of a boss confuses this the picture because a boss doesn't have liability or doesn't loyalty to the employee he has loyalty to the stakeholders he has loyalty to the bottom line and he'll manipulate and abuse employees for his own bonus to make himself look good a boss like how can we make budget fire all those people right how can we increase our profit line fire those people get rid of benefits do this do that all at the expense of the employees that's right so to be a boss is the wrong image amen but you are the head of the house the lifegiver the leader The Protector the man of the home not just the guy in the room I'm stopping right in the middle of this thought let's Stand Together
