[0:00] Matthew chapter 17:es 1 to8 just
[0:02] remember that in the prior verse Jesus
[0:05] has said there's some standing here who
[0:06] will not die until they see the son of
[0:08] man coming in his kingdom and then this
[0:10] is what they saw verse one and after six
[0:12] days Jesus taketh Peter James and John
[0:15] his brother and bringeth them up into a
[0:17] high mountain apart and was transfigured
[0:19] before them and his face did shine as
[0:21] the sun and his reignment was white as
[0:24] the light and behold there appeared unto
[0:25] them Moses and Elias which is Elijah
[0:28] talking with
[0:29] Then answered Peter and said, Jesus,
[0:31] Lord, it is good for us. Said unto
[0:33] Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be
[0:35] here. If thou wilt, let us make care
[0:37] three tabernacles, one for thee, and one
[0:39] for Moses, and one for Elias. I yet
[0:42] spake, behold, a bright cloud
[0:43] overshadowed them, and build a voice out
[0:45] of the cloud, which said, This is my
[0:47] beloved son, in whom I'm well pleased.
[0:49] Hear ye him. And when the disciples
[0:51] heard it, they fell on their face, and
[0:53] were so afraid. And Jesus came and
[0:56] touched them, and said, Arise, and be
[0:57] not afraid. When they lifted up their
[0:59] eyes, they saw no man save Jesus only.
[1:03] Wow. What an extraordinary uh vision.
[1:06] What a thing to see. You can be seated.
[1:10] I've given a title to my sermon today,
[1:12] brilliant beauty. Uh considered, you
[1:15] know, just different titles that we
[1:17] could give this, but as we've been on a
[1:18] particular subject all year, there's
[1:20] something about beauty and something
[1:22] that is attractive. And we're wanting to
[1:25] draw from here in verse two where it
[1:27] says his face did shine as the sun and
[1:29] there was this brilliance and there was
[1:31] this beauty that's being expressed. And
[1:33] though it's only expressed in just a few
[1:35] words about his face did shine as the
[1:36] sun and his reignment was white as the
[1:39] light, it's trying to convey something
[1:42] so striking to the eye. This this that
[1:45] it was engaging and it was very
[1:46] attractive. And I want to use this
[1:48] thought of a brilliant beauty drawing
[1:49] from um the characteristic of light.
[1:52] Now, if you'll turn to Luke 11:es
[1:56] 33 and 34, this will kind of catch up
[1:58] where we've been the last couple service
[2:00] services. It says, "No man, when he hath
[2:02] lighted a candle, putteth it in a secret
[2:04] place, neither under a bushel, which we
[2:06] know if it's in a secret place, the
[2:08] light isn't going to shine in any
[2:11] relevant manner." Or under a bushel,
[2:12] that's a filter, something that's going
[2:14] to diffuse the light or diminish its
[2:16] power. that they which come in but on a
[2:19] candlestick that they which come in may
[2:21] see the light. So this is this example
[2:24] of how light is going to be placed in
[2:26] certain ways that it might be effective.
[2:28] So we realize that light has power.
[2:30] Light has purpose. So he says the light
[2:33] of the body is the eye. Now this is
[2:35] speaking to you as a believer because
[2:36] you are the light of the world. A city
[2:39] set on a hill cannot be hid. A light is
[2:41] placed upon a candlestick not under a
[2:43] bushel that it might give light to all
[2:44] that are in the house. So the light of
[2:47] your body is the eye. Therefore, when
[2:49] thine eye is single, unmixed, pure, thy
[2:53] whole body is full of light. So there's
[2:56] this illumination inwardly. But when
[2:58] thine eye is evil, the body also is full
[3:01] of darkness. So that mixed
[3:03] double-mindedness, double tongedness,
[3:05] the uh the lack of singularity, the lack
[3:08] of the simplicity of Christ kind of
[3:10] divides us, divides our attention,
[3:12] divides our loyalties and therefore our
[3:15] body uh is darkness. He says full of
[3:18] darkness. So this light having power and
[3:20] purpose. Then Jesus talks about this
[3:23] internal light that we have and this
[3:25] internal light that we have must be
[3:27] expressed externally. Other words, we
[3:29] know we must give light. Where we left
[3:33] off last Sunday is right here at
[3:34] Philippians chapter 2. We didn't come to
[3:36] it, but we are now. Philippians chapter
[3:38] 2 verses 12 to 18. Now, just really draw
[3:42] into this uh uh this reading here
[3:46] because we were talking about uh I think
[3:48] maybe then it was mixed media and the
[3:50] mixing of things and this uh this lack
[3:53] of purity. He's going to use this word
[3:55] harmless which is unmixed. Wherefore, my
[3:57] beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not
[3:59] as in my presence only, but now much
[4:01] more in my absence. And so the the
[4:04] brother Eleaser ministered on this
[4:06] scripture here recently was very, very
[4:08] applicable. But now much more in my
[4:10] absence, work out your own salvation
[4:12] with fear and trembling. For it is God
[4:15] which workketh in you, both to will and
[4:17] to do of his good pleasure. Consider
[4:20] this. Just let this be something that
[4:22] you remind yourself of that God is in
[4:26] you both to desire, to will, to give
[4:28] uncction, and to do what pleases him.
[4:32] &gt;&gt; There's something really remarkable when
[4:34] you look at uh uh the scriptures, and
[4:36] I've been reading in the Psalms where it
[4:38] says, "In the Lord, I will praise him."
[4:40] And and there's a certain thought that's
[4:41] being expressed in that to where there's
[4:43] things that we're doing that aren't
[4:45] separate and apart from God that just
[4:47] make it this one perfect, complete
[4:49] whole. And I know that might be a
[4:51] fragment to you in terms of a thought,
[4:52] but I've just been thinking of these
[4:54] things and they're so powerful. God in
[4:56] us to will and to do of his good
[4:57] pleasure. So he says, "Do all things
[4:58] without murmurings and disputings that
[5:01] you may be blameless and harmless,
[5:03] unmixed."
[5:04] &gt;&gt; Blameless and harmless, the sons of God
[5:07] without rebuke in the midst of a crooked
[5:10] and perverse nation. And all the
[5:12] Americans said, "Amen." In the midst of
[5:15] a crooked and perverse nation. So, we
[5:17] realize we're called to allow this God
[5:21] that is in us to willing to do of his
[5:23] good pleasure. We're to have a certain
[5:24] attitude. No murmurings or disputings
[5:26] that we be blameless and homeless. Uh
[5:28] homeless harmless.
[5:31] I'm not prophesying. Never claimed to be
[5:32] a prophet
[5:34] in the midst of a crooked and perverse
[5:36] nation among whom ye shine as lights in
[5:40] the world. So now the God that is in us
[5:42] is wanting to be externally expressed.
[5:44] And it's said that we are to be lights
[5:48] &gt;&gt; in in darkness. The word to shine as
[5:51] lights in darkness. Holding forth the
[5:53] word of life that I may rejoice in the
[5:55] day of Christ that I have not Is that
[5:58] the name of your church, brother Ben?
[5:59] His word of life. Or did I I see what
[6:01] what symmetry here? What good things are
[6:04] happening? The holding forth the word of
[6:06] life that I may rejoice in the day of
[6:08] Christ that I have not run in vain
[6:10] neither labored in vain. Yay. And if I
[6:12] be offered upon the sacrifice and
[6:14] service of your faith, I joy and rejoice
[6:16] with you all. For the same cause also do
[6:17] ye joy, rejoice with me. There's the
[6:20] reward of the laboring and the servants
[6:23] work. But his desire that where is this
[6:26] rejoicing and joy going to come from?
[6:28] Seeing light expressed in the believer
[6:31] &gt;&gt; among whom you shine as lights in the
[6:34] world holding forth the word of life. So
[6:36] there's that. How do we shine forth into
[6:38] a dark world in this crooked and
[6:40] perverse nation? We do it by applying
[6:43] the word of God. By holding forth the
[6:45] word of life.
[6:47] &gt;&gt; And by holding forth this word of life.
[6:49] By applying it uh we become lightbears
[6:52] or luminaries.
[6:54] &gt;&gt; We become these these uh we express and
[6:58] declare light. And if I could say this,
[7:01] I may have mentioned it to some extent
[7:03] on on Sunday, but I was kind of tracking
[7:05] this last Sunday that the the faithful
[7:08] Christian will not be content without
[7:10] making an effort to express Christ.
[7:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[7:14] &gt;&gt; A genuine Christian is not going to find
[7:17] themselves satisfied or happy unless
[7:19] they have made some effort to display
[7:22] and express Christ.
[7:23] &gt;&gt; I hope by saying that some of you are
[7:25] like, "Ah, now there's the reason for my
[7:27] melancholy. I'm not making an effort.
[7:29] I'm not I'm not trying to apply myself
[7:32] holding forth. It doesn't say laying
[7:34] there homeless, right? It says harmless
[7:38] as a as a home for heaven. The word of
[7:40] God is in YOUR HEART. NOW, I want it to
[7:42] radiate. AND YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE
[7:44] truly satisfied UNLESS YOU MAKE SOME
[7:46] effort to directly reflect or express
[7:49] Christ.
[7:51] The word of life, holding forth the word
[7:53] of life, which is light. The Bible says
[7:55] in John 1:4, "In him was life." This is
[7:57] the word and the life was the light of
[8:00] men.
[8:01] &gt;&gt; Tells us there's life in the word and
[8:04] the life that is in the word is the word
[8:06] of life which we find not only in
[8:08] Philippians but in first John and
[8:10] different places. This word of life and
[8:12] this word of life is the light of men.
[8:17] &gt;&gt; It's this life of light. You could even
[8:19] go back to the beginning when God
[8:20] breathed uh breath into Adam. He became
[8:23] a living soul. He was filled with light.
[8:27] And this light that he had inside of
[8:28] him, this was the light of men. This is
[8:30] what lit humanity. This is what made him
[8:33] a living soul. In Psalms 36:9, for with
[8:37] thee is the fountain of life. In thy
[8:40] light shall we see light. Now, isn't
[8:43] that interesting? In thy light shall we
[8:46] see light.
[8:48] I mean, we could say in thy light we
[8:49] shall see light. But there's this in his
[8:53] light, we can see. We we have life and
[8:56] this light was the light of man. It was
[8:58] the true light. The fountain of wisdom
[9:01] and holiness and and happiness and man
[9:05] in his original state. That life was the
[9:07] light of man. And this light is the hope
[9:10] of humanity. It is our it is our
[9:13] strength. It is our power of all things
[9:15] that are truly beautiful and genuine.
[9:17] The word of life is light. It is beauty.
[9:20] It is power.
[9:22] Light. Even in the scripture it says in
[9:24] God's light we see light. It's a force
[9:26] of reason that understanding which is
[9:29] which is kindled in our minds to know
[9:32] God. The word of life is the light of
[9:35] man. It's by the word hearing of the
[9:36] word that we have faith in God. And it's
[9:38] that word of life that enlightens us. In
[9:40] thy light we shall see light. Life is
[9:43] understanding and and knowledge and
[9:46] power.
[9:47] So the question I am posing today is I
[9:50] often like maybe just to help myself
[9:51] along because the question is asked you
[9:53] know what's your point and and that's
[9:55] the question I ask myself often but is
[9:59] Christ beautiful in your eyes
[10:04] I is he beautiful in your eyes does this
[10:07] aura and charisma of Christ attract you
[10:12] &gt;&gt; this the Bible describes him in ways uh
[10:15] that we could say well those are just
[10:16] agit
[10:17] And that's just a description and that
[10:19] just says light and that just says white
[10:20] and that just says this. But it's it's
[10:22] using a language to describe something
[10:25] that we're not seeing
[10:27] &gt;&gt; with our natural eye.
[10:29] &gt;&gt; But in his light we see light. In him
[10:33] the word is life. And that life is the
[10:36] light of man so that we may see. And so,
[10:40] has there been an illumination of Christ
[10:43] in our souls that now he being this word
[10:46] of life to us, WE CAN HOLD HIM forth as
[10:50] light in a crooked and perverse
[10:52] generation?
[10:54] &gt;&gt; We were reading from George Mat's uh
[10:56] rest by the river devotional to you on
[10:59] Wednesday night and he was using the
[11:01] scriptures in Luke chapter 11 and he
[11:03] said, "You will imprint Christ upon my
[11:06] life when you have made him beautiful to
[11:08] my eye.
[11:10] that if Christ is going to be impressed,
[11:12] if he's going to be seen, if he's going
[11:14] to be expressed, then he must first be
[11:16] made beautiful to our eyes.
[11:19] &gt;&gt; And he was talking about what we admire
[11:21] and what we set forth as heroic and what
[11:23] we desire uh um to experience or to see.
[11:26] And he says, what is that picture of
[11:28] heroism which you have set before your
[11:30] inward eye? In other words, you have
[11:32] some external image of what a hero is.
[11:35] And if that hero is John Wayne, to use a
[11:38] relevant character, a timely character,
[11:40] or maybe let's update him a little bit.
[11:41] If that is Rambo, then you're going to
[11:44] look at that as a hero, then that's
[11:46] going to be what you aspire to be.
[11:49] That's what you're you're going to say,
[11:50] "This is what heroism looks like." He
[11:52] says, "What is that picture of heroism
[11:54] you've set before your inward eye?" He
[11:56] exclaims in effect, and he's talking
[11:58] about Jesus in Luke 11, it is no use to
[12:01] lay down rules of morality. That's that
[12:04] legalism. These are the rules. Follow
[12:06] it. What is your model of perfection?
[12:09] Your ideal of beauty,
[12:11] &gt;&gt; your standard of excellence.
[12:13] &gt;&gt; Think of it. If we if we just gave you
[12:16] all a list of rules, and I know some of
[12:17] you wish we would do that,
[12:20] &gt;&gt; just tell me what to eat, tell me what
[12:21] to wear, tell me where to go, tell me
[12:23] what to do, tell me what car to buy,
[12:24] where to get a job, where to go to
[12:25] church. Just tell me everything. And
[12:27] we'll just follow it like a list of
[12:28] rules. A and tell ourselves, as long as
[12:31] I'm doing this, I'm okay. But there's no
[12:33] use in laying down rules of morality.
[12:37] The question is what's your model of
[12:40] perfection?
[12:42] What what's your what's what do you
[12:44] consider beautiful? What's the standard
[12:46] of excellence that you're trying to
[12:47] achieve? He says everything depends on
[12:49] that.
[12:50] &gt;&gt; Ultimately, what you're going to
[12:51] express, what you're going to pursue,
[12:53] what you're going to do is going to fit
[12:54] somewhere within what you believe to be
[12:56] these models, these ideals, and these
[12:58] standards.
[13:00] Brother Bam in the sermon things that
[13:02] are to be as we're talk we're following
[13:04] up on this statement of is Christ
[13:06] beautiful in your eye and has what you
[13:08] see is it imprinted on you. He says
[13:10] you're nothing but the manifestation of
[13:12] the gene of life that was in God.
[13:14] &gt;&gt; So as a son of God you are the
[13:16] manifestation of the word of life. In
[13:19] him was life and the life was the light
[13:20] of men. Now you are light. You are
[13:22] holding forth the word of life. You are
[13:24] the attributes of God. He says now
[13:26] you're expressed after his word has come
[13:28] in you to light up this age. You are
[13:30] expressed to light up this age. Says
[13:33] what Paul is saying that you may in the
[13:35] midst of a crooked and perverse nation
[13:37] in the time you're living now.
[13:39] &gt;&gt; Listen, I we're not trying to build up
[13:41] an archive of social media post so that
[13:44] a hundred years from now they're going
[13:46] to look at the LIGHT BACK IN 2025 and
[13:49] say, "My, weren't they really good
[13:50] Christians over there off Wahala?"
[13:53] Right? They said, "Weren't they just
[13:55] brilliant Christians?" No, right now in
[13:56] the age that you're living in now,
[13:59] you're to shine forth to light up this
[14:01] age. You're expressing God's life in you
[14:03] because you're a son or daughter of God.
[14:04] You are now made, you're setting in this
[14:06] church because your duty is to express
[14:09] God.
[14:10] &gt;&gt; Your duty is to express God. It's God
[14:12] that workketh in you both to will and to
[14:15] do of his good pleasure that you might
[14:16] be holding forth the word of life in a
[14:19] crooked and perverse nation as lights in
[14:21] the world.
[14:23] Therefore, our duty is to express God to
[14:25] this nation, to this people, and to this
[14:27] neighborhood where you associate.
[14:29] &gt;&gt; So, you are to express God in your
[14:31] neighborhood.
[14:33] &gt;&gt; You want to be a good neighbor. You want
[14:34] to love thy neighbor even when their
[14:36] trees are encroaching on your yard. Even
[14:38] if they don't let you pick the lemons
[14:40] from their tree that's hanging over into
[14:42] your backyard, you're to love your
[14:44] neighbor.
[14:47] And if we are, we have a duty because
[14:50] there think of this power of light. If
[14:52] light is shining,
[14:54] then light in Ephesians it says light
[14:57] reproves.
[14:58] And so there's a there's a shining of
[15:00] light into our hearts that reproves us
[15:01] and corrects us. Then there's a
[15:02] reflection back out of the light which
[15:04] that light then it becomes a reproof.
[15:06] We're expressing Christ. We are holding
[15:08] forth a word of life and therefore it
[15:10] shines as lights in the world. And this
[15:12] light shining it means you have the
[15:14] power to shape.
[15:16] You have the power to to uh um highlight
[15:21] and you have a power to shape desire and
[15:23] admiration.
[15:25] &gt;&gt; What is the picture of heroism you set
[15:27] before your eye? What are you shedding
[15:28] light on? What is being illuminated? So
[15:31] there's an influence that we that we
[15:34] hold as Christians. So this is there's
[15:36] an expression that influences perception
[15:40] because that's what light's going to do.
[15:43] And as we read from that rest by the
[15:45] river, beware what ideal you suggest to
[15:48] the admiration of the child. So this is
[15:50] the responsibility. Our duty is to
[15:52] express Christ, express God to our
[15:55] neighbors. So then what we uh what we
[15:58] lift up and what we express as idilic
[16:01] idealic and what we express as something
[16:03] good, we suggest it to here the
[16:06] admiration of our children. When we make
[16:09] violence heroic, when we make abuse of
[16:11] power beautiful, we make selfishness
[16:13] desirable.
[16:15] &gt;&gt; There's things that we can uh express.
[16:17] And when we do so, you do it to the
[16:20] admiration of your child.
[16:22] &gt;&gt; When there's things that you give
[16:23] attention to, things you support, things
[16:25] you watch, things you listen to, things
[16:27] that you talk about, it it's suggested
[16:30] to the admiration of the child.
[16:32] &gt;&gt; Is that true?
[16:34] don't often ask you to agree with me or
[16:36] for give you AN OPPORTUNITY TO SAY NO
[16:37] IT'S NOT UH IS it so one I can't
[16:40] remember who it was one time did that I
[16:42] don't know if it was uh I don't know was
[16:46] it was it Ben was he the one that did it
[16:48] I can't remember where is he where did
[16:49] they go they're back there some there
[16:51] they are him that said it one time or
[16:53] was it was it one of your daughters that
[16:56] said nom just disagreed with me the
[16:59] little cookie bear it's she called me
[17:01] out on something one time
[17:04] But there is a an expression of light
[17:07] that's going to highlight something and
[17:08] we need to think what is it we're
[17:10] lifting up. What what is it we're making
[17:11] beautiful in someone else's eye?
[17:13] &gt;&gt; Right
[17:13] &gt;&gt; now you may recognize these things as
[17:16] being very familiar not just over the
[17:17] last few weeks but we're revisiting
[17:19] subjects from the very beginning of the
[17:21] year in the first few months of the
[17:22] year. 21st century Christ we looked at
[17:25] uh the sacred symmetry and we were
[17:27] looking at Christ being expressed today.
[17:29] And then when we we preached a sermon on
[17:32] ugliness and then from there we kind of
[17:33] got into a a whole section on some other
[17:36] things and it was God's word discerning
[17:40] God's word leading into areas that
[17:42] needed to be addressed and we see the
[17:44] supernatural hand of God and how he
[17:45] addressed certain things. But the
[17:47] question is what is it that we are
[17:48] making beautiful
[17:50] &gt;&gt; because there are ways and I'm just
[17:53] trying to think of a way to say this.
[17:54] There are ways that we can make Christ
[17:56] unnecessarily unattractive.
[18:00] And I say that because Christ in his
[18:02] truth is not really attractive to the
[18:05] world.
[18:06] &gt;&gt; The carnal mind is at enmity with God.
[18:08] If Christ represents God, then the
[18:11] carnal mind kind of instinctively
[18:13] repulses at Christ.
[18:15] &gt;&gt; And so the life which is humanity's
[18:18] light has been filtered so much,
[18:20] manipulated, and incorrectly perceived
[18:22] so that man in his fallen STATE DOES NOT
[18:25] SEE GOD as he is. Remember man in the
[18:28] garden who was perfect and knew
[18:30] everything or had a perfect knowledge, a
[18:32] perfect understanding of love of God. As
[18:34] soon as he sinned in THAT DEBASE STATE,
[18:36] HE RAN FROM GOD fearing him,
[18:39] &gt;&gt; wasn't drawn to that presence. HE DIDN'T
[18:41] PINE AFTER THAT PRESENCE. He didn't
[18:43] cling to him instinctively and say, "Oh
[18:45] my, WASH ME, MAKE ME WHOLE." THE IMAGE
[18:47] OF GOD HAD CHANGED.
[18:50] And as we've been speaking about mixed
[18:53] media and different things and poison, I
[18:56] almost brought my poison card that uh
[18:58] that someone gave me and and was going
[19:00] to show it and I had it in my coat
[19:02] pocket and I left it in a very safe
[19:03] place because I didn't want to lose my
[19:04] poison card. But there are there is a
[19:08] legalism that we could use to take away
[19:11] certain things, take away media, take
[19:14] away um certain privileges or certain
[19:16] things. We restrict uh people's freedoms
[19:20] or liberties and we do it with the wrong
[19:22] motive and objective
[19:24] and that makes Christ unnecessarily
[19:28] unattractive.
[19:31] When you read in the word of God that he
[19:33] wants us to be uh blameless and
[19:36] harmless, when we read that he wants us
[19:37] to walk circumspectfully with wisdom and
[19:40] not foolishness, and we see what the
[19:42] Bible in the New Testament requires of
[19:44] us, we're not even getting into the Old
[19:45] Testament. What the Bible requires of
[19:47] us, it's like it's a standard that if
[19:49] you're honest and you look, it says,
[19:50] "Well, I don't know if I really want to
[19:52] do that. That's not very attractive.
[19:55] That that's not appealing to me in my
[19:57] flesh." AND SO THERE'S WAYS that we
[19:58] could take the true word of God and then
[20:00] begin to utilize it legalistically or
[20:03] with the wrong motive and objective. And
[20:04] that leads to manipulation and it leads
[20:07] to a hypocrisy that makes Christ
[20:10] unnecessarily unattractive.
[20:13] &gt;&gt; In the Old Testament, we saw where God
[20:15] had called Israel to get rid of all the
[20:18] mediums, get rid of all the witches and
[20:20] the soothsayers and the necromancers and
[20:22] all these ones with spirits of
[20:24] divination. He said, "PUT THEM AWAY.
[20:25] They're an abomination to me. They're
[20:27] evil practices. They'll only cause you
[20:28] to sin. And it said in 1 Samuel that
[20:31] Saul had put away all those familiar
[20:33] spirits and the wizards out of the land,
[20:36] taking shots at the wizards, too. And
[20:39] then what does what does Saul do? He put
[20:41] them out. But what did he do? He went
[20:43] right back and visited them. Uhhuh.
[20:45] &gt;&gt; So when he visits the medium, he's he it
[20:47] shows that his original efforts to
[20:50] banish wizards and mediums was not
[20:53] word-based,
[20:55] &gt;&gt; but maybe politically based,
[20:57] &gt;&gt; maybe uh pretense,
[21:00] &gt;&gt; the the the the the person the the
[21:03] politics of appearances
[21:06] &gt;&gt; and therefore he could be hypocritical
[21:08] about it. AND WHAT WOULD THAT MAKE THE
[21:10] RULE? YOU GO BACK AND YOU LOOK AT THE
[21:11] WELL THE KING PUT AWAY ALL THESE things
[21:13] and then you see somebody that's
[21:15] hypocritical with it. It makes the word
[21:17] unattractive.
[21:21] &gt;&gt; And as we're still trying to take a step
[21:24] further in terms of u the mixing of
[21:28] things and being unmixed, we used the we
[21:30] were using the phrase last time that now
[21:32] because Saul had these mixed motives,
[21:35] his results were mixed. went to see a
[21:37] medium. He was mixing things. Now,
[21:41] Nehemiah chapter 13:es 1:3,
[21:45] I'm reading this because there's this
[21:47] response of the people to the word of
[21:49] God to be harmless or unmixed to to
[21:53] observe the word of God, to obey the
[21:54] word of God. It says, "On that day they
[21:56] read in the book of Moses in the
[21:57] audience of the people. And therein was
[22:00] found written that the Ammonite and the
[22:01] Moabitete should not come into the
[22:02] congregation of God forever because they
[22:04] met not the children of Israel with
[22:06] bread and with water, but hired Balam
[22:09] against them that he should curse them.
[22:11] How be it, our God turned the curse into
[22:13] a blessing." We understand the story of
[22:15] Balum. Now it came to pass when they
[22:18] heard the law that they separated from
[22:20] Israel all the mixed multitude.
[22:24] Now this phrase they separated from
[22:25] Israel all the mixed multitude had a
[22:27] very specific application as in the law
[22:30] the Ammonite and the Moabitete should
[22:31] not come into the congregation of God
[22:32] forever. But this response of the people
[22:36] upon hearing the word indicates that
[22:38] there was some deep conviction
[22:41] and clarity about what they're supposed
[22:43] to do. They didn't just hear the word
[22:45] and be like that was a good sermon.
[22:48] Really enjoyed that. and a and continued
[22:52] to live as they were. But they this
[22:54] response when IT CAME TO PASS WHEN THEY
[22:56] HEARD THE law they obeyed it and they
[22:59] separated according to what the law had
[23:01] asked them to do. And this what what is
[23:05] described as a collective decision when
[23:06] they heard the law they separated from
[23:08] Israel and all the mixed multitude. It
[23:10] was achieved through this individual
[23:12] understanding, some individual con uh
[23:14] conviction that began to uh have this
[23:17] collective momentum. Say this is what we
[23:20] must do according to the word of God. So
[23:22] we can say well the word of God was read
[23:24] and everybody heard the word and like
[23:25] okay well I guess we better get rid of
[23:26] the Moabites. But notice in Nehemiah
[23:29] chapter 8 verses 1 to3 and all the
[23:33] people gathered themselves together as
[23:34] one man into the street that was before
[23:36] the Watergate. That's the original
[23:39] Watergate. And they spake unto Ezra. I
[23:42] am not a crook. They spake unto Ezra the
[23:45] scribe to bring the book of the law of
[23:47] Moses which the Lord had commanded to
[23:49] Israel. So now they want the word to
[23:51] come forth. We want it to be read. And
[23:53] Ezra the priest brought the law before
[23:55] the congregation both of men and women
[23:57] and all that could hear with
[23:59] understanding. So I think this is a key
[24:01] part. So you as parents, as adults, as
[24:05] believers filled the Holy Ghost, you're
[24:06] the ones that can hear the word with
[24:08] understanding upon the first day of the
[24:10] seventh month. And he read therein
[24:11] before the street that was before the
[24:13] Watergate from the morning until midday.
[24:15] That's my goal today. Before the men and
[24:18] the women and those who could
[24:19] understand, and the ears of all the
[24:21] people were attentive unto the book of
[24:24] the law. So they didn't just hear a dry
[24:27] sermon. They just didn't hear it
[24:28] recited. and they just weren't showing
[24:29] up to do the homaly and to do the the
[24:32] mass and to do the the tradition and to
[24:34] play the tape or to DO THESE THINGS. IT
[24:36] WASN'T SOME SORT OF formal recitation of
[24:39] scripture. Just have a reader do it,
[24:41] just have this. But they came and as
[24:43] they heard the words, they believed that
[24:45] it was from God and it was giving them
[24:47] instruction and that it was to be for
[24:49] them a light.
[24:52] &gt;&gt; And hearing the word with understanding
[24:54] led the individual to conviction and
[24:57] then a decision. I'm hearing the word
[24:59] clearly. I understand that it's asking
[25:01] me to do this and therefore they did it.
[25:06] &gt;&gt; There is a brilliance that sheds light
[25:09] on the truth of the word.
[25:12] And this is what happened when the word
[25:13] was read. It was illuminated to them. It
[25:17] became light to them and they had to act
[25:19] upon it.
[25:21] This is where uh the Bible speaks of
[25:23] light has sprung up. But men didn't want
[25:25] to believe the light. They refused the
[25:26] light.
[25:29] And so there's this brilliance of the
[25:30] word of God that shines upon the word
[25:32] and we're like this is it. This is the
[25:34] truth. This is what we must do. There's
[25:36] a critical moment when in which you
[25:38] respond to that in Psalms 90 16 and 17.
[25:43] Let thy work appear unto thy servants
[25:45] and thy glory unto their children.
[25:48] Think of this phrase. God's glory is
[25:49] manifested to the children by the work
[25:51] that he shows their parents. Let the
[25:54] work thy work appear unto thy servants.
[25:56] So as God reveals himself to his
[25:58] servants, then the glory is expressed to
[26:01] the children both him to in you both to
[26:04] will and to do. It's the work of God in
[26:06] us. And let the beauty of the Lord our
[26:07] God be upon us. I think that's connected
[26:10] with the glory. The glory is going to be
[26:12] appear to our children. Let the beauty
[26:14] of the Lord our God be upon us that his
[26:16] glory may be seen by our children and
[26:18] establish thou the work of our hands
[26:19] upon us. Yay, the work of our hands
[26:21] establish thou it.
[26:24] The beauty of the Lord, his kindness,
[26:26] his pleasantness. That's what this
[26:27] beauty refers to. This delightfulness,
[26:29] his sweetness, even it means a
[26:31] loveliness. These are things that are
[26:33] attractive.
[26:35] These are things we say, well, is it
[26:36] sweet or sour?
[26:39] Is it good or is it bad? These are
[26:42] things that are kind, that are pleasant,
[26:43] that are sweet, that are lovely.
[26:45] And I realized and and I'm just taking a
[26:47] little bit of an aside, but this kind of
[26:49] became the the heart of my emphasis as I
[26:52] was studying it over the last week or
[26:53] so. And where we're maybe going to
[26:55] arrive at this point is how that beauty
[26:57] can be objective or could be argued to
[27:01] be objective like this as the
[27:03] philosophers argued that there was a
[27:06] beauty that an absolute beauty manifest
[27:09] in symmetry and proportion and order.
[27:12] But then you had some these
[27:15] stoics on the other hand who saw it
[27:17] maybe a little bit more broadly that
[27:18] there can be a beauty that is
[27:19] subjective. So it exists as a sum of the
[27:21] parts that you see beauty in the
[27:24] individual itself by how things are all
[27:27] proportioned or how things are worked
[27:28] together by some relationship or just in
[27:31] inward goodness. So they didn't look at
[27:34] there's different ways that you could
[27:35] look at say well there's a beauty that's
[27:37] inward or that is subjective or there's
[27:39] a subjective beauty but called symmetry
[27:40] and proportion and order and and for
[27:44] those of you who are familiar Confucious
[27:46] said everything has its beauty but not
[27:47] everyone sees it.
[27:50] very interesting cultural traditions and
[27:52] views of beauty
[27:54] in the Chinese culture. He says
[27:56] everything has a beauty but not everyone
[27:57] sees it. So it stands for the phrase
[28:00] that we might use beauty is in the eye
[28:02] of the beholder.
[28:04] &gt;&gt; That we we say well beauty is just in
[28:07] the eye of the one who's perceiving that
[28:09] judgments of beauty are subjective. What
[28:12] you think is beautiful somebody else may
[28:14] not find beautiful.
[28:16] what people find pleasing, somebody else
[28:18] might may not find pleasing. Reminds me
[28:20] of haunted houses. Some people want to
[28:22] go to a haunted house. I'm like, why
[28:24] would I want to voluntarily offer myself
[28:27] up to be scared? I I don't I don't
[28:30] understand that. So, yes, there's
[28:31] certain things. Beauty, we can say,
[28:32] well, maybe we say beauty is absolute,
[28:34] but obviously horror is subjective.
[28:38] But it subjects when there says beauty
[28:40] is in the eye of the beholder, it
[28:42] suggests beauty is determined by the
[28:44] observer's perception
[28:47] that it's rather than there being some
[28:49] sort of inherent quality that makes it
[28:51] beautiful, we all just have our own
[28:53] decisions and our own judgments of what
[28:55] is beautiful. Now, this is where things
[28:57] have turned because we can read in the
[28:59] word of God and we see things are set a
[29:01] certain way and we are wanting you to
[29:04] consider that the word of God is
[29:06] beautiful and but to the carnal mind
[29:08] it's not and that would mean it's
[29:10] subjective
[29:12] because God is objectively beautiful.
[29:15] &gt;&gt; The word is objectively perfect.
[29:18] &gt;&gt; There is a an objective truth. It's
[29:20] called the word of God.
[29:21] &gt;&gt; The word of God is the truth. No matter
[29:23] what you think about it, no matter what
[29:25] you've made it,
[29:26] &gt;&gt; no matter what others have made it,
[29:28] who've made it unnecessarily
[29:29] unattractive, it's still the truth.
[29:32] &gt;&gt; The ugly truth, as we may say.
[29:36] But man,
[29:38] there it's so there's a if it's
[29:40] subjective, that's well, it's your
[29:42] opinion and there's not some inherent
[29:43] quality of being beautiful and that's
[29:45] what people will do, right? To absolve
[29:48] themselves of obedience.
[29:50] &gt;&gt; Yeah. I don't think it's true. What have
[29:52] they they've made it subjective to their
[29:54] own rationality and understanding and it
[29:56] doesn't have this inherent quality of
[29:58] truth. It's to each his own. In Proverbs
[30:00] chapter 16 verse two, it says, "All the
[30:02] ways of man are clean in his own eyes,
[30:05] but the Lord weighth the spirit."
[30:08] There's 31 chapters in the book of
[30:10] Proverbs. Anybody play the game where
[30:11] your birth day is your chapter?
[30:16] Anybody? Anybody done that? Well, 16 is
[30:19] really rough.
[30:22] Okay. All right. I don't follow I don't
[30:24] subscribe to that. If I could find a
[30:27] metric that works for me, I'll espouse
[30:29] it. But chapter 16 is pretty hard. All
[30:33] the ways of man are clean in his own
[30:34] eyes, but the Lord weighth the spirits.
[30:36] What does it mean? Clean outwardly.
[30:39] &gt;&gt; In other words, NO MATTER HOW I arrive
[30:42] at the decision or the the the
[30:44] appearance or the conclusion, my motive,
[30:47] you know, it's all good. It's all clean.
[30:48] All the ways of man are clean, pure
[30:51] outwardly in his own eyes. So man has
[30:54] made his own beauty and his own purity
[30:56] and his own unmixingness
[31:00] clean subjectively.
[31:02] If it's clean in my eyes, it's that's
[31:04] what matters. But it says God judges
[31:06] motives, judges objectives. He judges
[31:09] the the support,
[31:11] &gt;&gt; the canvas. What is it on? What's your
[31:13] basis? The Lord weighth the spirits.
[31:17] the subjective truth where a person's
[31:19] individual perception or opinion uh uh
[31:21] uh is well this is how I've arrived at
[31:23] it this is this is what I believe this
[31:26] is how I feel but there is a question if
[31:29] the Lord's way in the spirits how was it
[31:30] informed
[31:33] &gt;&gt; you can say well THIS IS HOW I FEEL THIS
[31:35] IS HOW I SEE IT THIS IS MY CONVICTION
[31:37] THIS IS MY DECISION BUT GOD IS NOT ONLY
[31:40] CONCERNED ABOUT WHERE YOU ARRIVE HE'S
[31:42] WEIGHING HOW YOU GOT THERE
[31:44] &gt;&gt; YEAH THAT'S RIGHT
[31:45] &gt;&gt; WHAT WHAT INFLUENCED THIS? WHAT INFORMED
[31:49] your decisions? Oh, I think that's
[31:52] beautiful. Why do you THINK THAT'S
[31:54] BEAUTIFUL?
[31:56] &gt;&gt; I THINK THAT'S THE TRUTH. WHY DO YOU
[31:58] THINK THAT'S TRUTH? I THINK THAT'S A
[31:59] LIE. I DON'T THINK THAT'S TRUE. I THINK
[32:01] THAT'S WRONG. WHY?
[32:03] &gt;&gt; The Lord weighth the spirits. For
[32:06] Proverbs chapter 19 verse 21, these are
[32:08] the things that the Lord weighs. There
[32:09] are many devices in a man's hearts. In a
[32:12] man's heart. This is what God is
[32:13] weighing. His devices.
[32:15] You keep trying to make these cell
[32:17] phones lighter and lighter. God still
[32:18] knows the await the weight of it.
[32:21] There's many devices in man's heart,
[32:23] many judgments. That's what it means. A
[32:25] device is a value judgment, a way to
[32:27] judge. Nevertheless, the council Lord
[32:30] that shall stand. So subjective beauty
[32:34] is a matter of opinion.
[32:37] &gt;&gt; Objective beauty is a matter of truth,
[32:40] an absolute.
[32:41] And the Bible says there's many value
[32:44] judgments in your heart where you arrive
[32:46] at your conclusion or your opinion, but
[32:50] the counsel of the Lord that shall
[32:53] stand. In other words, his purpose, his
[32:56] advice, his opinion is actually the one
[32:59] that's true.
[33:01] &gt;&gt; So if you if you halt between two
[33:03] opinions, take God's.
[33:06] If you're wanting to get neutral, God
[33:08] has a will. I have a will. I'm just
[33:10] going to get neutral to it. Are you
[33:12] crazy?
[33:13] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[33:14] &gt;&gt; No. I don't want to be neutral. I'm sold
[33:16] out to his will.
[33:18] &gt;&gt; There's nothing in his will I'm afraid
[33:20] of. There's nothing outside of his will
[33:22] that I want.
[33:22] &gt;&gt; Right.
[33:23] &gt;&gt; That's how THAT'S HOW I SELL MYSELF OUT.
[33:25] I want his will. Now, there's times when
[33:26] I don't know what his will is. Could it
[33:28] be the left? Could it be the right? And
[33:29] I want to know. And therefore, I pray
[33:32] and I realize that God is kind to me. I
[33:34] was even thinking of it today. It it
[33:37] wasn't the Forest Frank song, but I was
[33:38] listening to another song this morning
[33:39] and and it one of the lines said, "I'VE
[33:41] GOT YOUR BACK." God responding to a
[33:44] believer's conundrum and what he's going
[33:45] through. I'VE GOT YOUR BACK. IN OTHER
[33:47] WORDS, PRAY. Be sincere. IF YOU MAKE THE
[33:50] WRONG DECISION, GOD'S GOT YOUR BACK.
[33:53] &gt;&gt; He literally is GOING TO SAY, "DON'T
[33:55] WORRY ABOUT IT. LET'S GET OUT OF THIS
[33:57] TOGETHER. THIS IS THE RIGHT WAY."
[34:00] &gt;&gt; SO THEREFORE, I'M NOT AFRAID OF SELLING
[34:02] OUT TO HIS WILL. But the one THING
[34:04] THAT'LL KEEP ME FROM IT IS MY OPINION
[34:06] AND MY judgments and my subjective uh uh
[34:10] values.
[34:13] &gt;&gt; So this is God's man's opinion versus
[34:16] God's opinion. And I want to take God's
[34:18] Benjamin Franklin and his uh I forgot
[34:23] what his uh pseudonym what he was
[34:24] writing his pin name was and his
[34:26] publication now but he wrote a little
[34:28] diddy back there in the 1700s. Beauty
[34:30] like supreme dominion is but supported
[34:32] by opinion.
[34:35] &gt;&gt; Therefore, there's a supreme dominion
[34:38] that's supported by opinion. Says it's
[34:39] just like beauty that it's only opinion.
[34:43] As they say, opinions are like noses.
[34:47] Mine are bigger than yours.
[34:51] So if there's a
[34:53] uh if things are if beauty is a matter
[34:56] of opinion
[34:58] &gt;&gt; THEN CONSIDER THE POWER that social
[35:00] media has over us.
[35:02] &gt;&gt; CONSIDER THE POWER and the influence
[35:05] that society has to influence our
[35:08] definition, our perception and our
[35:10] opinion of beauty
[35:12] &gt;&gt; in what we embrace as beautiful. there.
[35:16] This is the danger of the rhetoric when
[35:17] it comes to politics is the more often a
[35:20] lie is repeated, the more likely you are
[35:23] to believe it's true.
[35:24] &gt;&gt; Right?
[35:25] &gt;&gt; And so when we hear it repeated over and
[35:27] over AGAIN THAT CERTAIN LIFESTYLES OR
[35:30] CERTAIN uh things that are evil or
[35:32] beautiful that are we should have pride
[35:33] in that we should accept and we think
[35:35] are great then that presents an image of
[35:38] beauty that we then BEGIN TO SAY WELL
[35:40] THAT IS BEAUTIFUL. Uniqueness is what
[35:42] MAKES US BEAUTIFUL. VARIEDNESS IS WHAT
[35:44] MAKES US BEAUTIFUL. AND WHAT WE'RE
[35:45] ACTUALLY LOOKING AT IS A PALE horse
[35:48] &gt;&gt; with NO CLEAR IDENTITY WHATSOEVER. AND
[35:51] IT'S THE ANTICHRIST SWEEPING THROUGH
[35:53] POLITICS and religion and society. And
[35:56] because and THEN AS THAT VOICE BEGINS TO
[35:58] SHAPE PERCEPTION OF WHAT IS BEAUTIFUL,
[36:00] THEN THERE'S ANOTHER VOICE ON THE OTHER
[36:02] SIDE SAYING BURN THEM ALL AND WE HATE
[36:04] THEM AND PROTEST AND ABUSE AND DEFILE
[36:07] AND IT MAKES VIOLENCE HEROIC. AND BOTH
[36:09] OF THEM ARE THE WRONG IMAGE of beauty.
[36:13] A lot of these things that we read
[36:14] online, whether it be on on X or if it
[36:18] be on any of these social media
[36:20] platforms, you're reading people's
[36:22] unfiltered opinion.
[36:25] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[36:26] &gt;&gt; And you just you read it and you say,
[36:28] "Oh, well, I guess so and so is a piece
[36:30] of garbage.
[36:31] &gt;&gt; Oh, this. Oh, that." And and what you do
[36:34] is it immediately influences perception.
[36:36] Because if you were if you were a blank
[36:38] slate and you were just an empty canvas
[36:41] and somebody offers an opinion on
[36:44] Proposition 50, oh my goodness gracious.
[36:47] Yep. That's how I feel about it. You
[36:49] know, nothing else but what the person
[36:50] said. Amen.
[36:52] &gt;&gt; And there's all sorts of op-eds, opinion
[36:54] editorials, or even opinion pieces that
[36:57] are not just for the purpose of
[36:58] expressing opinion,
[37:02] &gt;&gt; but for the purpose of shaping opinion.
[37:05] For influencing opinion, as a means of
[37:07] swaying people to hold to that opinion
[37:10] or further strengthening those who
[37:11] already have it. This world's full of
[37:14] opinions,
[37:16] perceptions of beauty, subjective
[37:18] definitions of what is beautiful.
[37:20] And the world would look at Christ in
[37:22] his nakedness and recoil from it and say
[37:26] that's not beautiful.
[37:28] &gt;&gt; And if WE RECEIVE THE LIE, if we receive
[37:30] the influence, if we're not careful,
[37:32] then that begins to shape our perception
[37:33] of what is beautiful. And then we too
[37:36] have arrived at this subjective opinion
[37:38] of what is beautiful AND WHAT IS
[37:40] ATTRACTIVE IN CONTRADICTION TO what is
[37:42] objectively true. Uh-huh.
[37:44] &gt;&gt; In Isaiah 53:es 1:3, if this seems to be
[37:48] somewhat abstract, there is very
[37:50] concrete practical application of these
[37:52] things.
[37:54] &gt;&gt; ISAIAH 53:ES 1-3. WHO HATH BELIEVED OUR
[37:57] REPORT? AND TO whom is the arm of the
[37:58] Lord revealed?
[38:00] &gt;&gt; For he shall grow up before him as a
[38:02] tender plant, and as a root of the of of
[38:04] out of a dry ground. For he hath no form
[38:07] nor clumliness. This is saying he
[38:08] doesn't have any attractiveness,
[38:11] no form, proportion, symmetry.
[38:15] &gt;&gt; And when we shall see him,
[38:18] in whom is the light,
[38:20] &gt;&gt; in whom is the way, the truth, the life,
[38:22] in whom is the word of life made flesh,
[38:24] there is no beauty that we should desire
[38:25] him.
[38:27] Notice just how
[38:29] this prophecy
[38:34] is expressive not of the true nature of
[38:37] Christ but man's perception of him.
[38:40] He is despised and rejected of men. So
[38:43] this is this humanity, fallen man, the
[38:46] carnal nature, the carnal mind sees no
[38:48] desirable beauty in Christ. He's
[38:49] despised and rejected of men, a man of
[38:52] sorrows and acquainted with grief. And
[38:53] we hid, as it were, our faces from him.
[38:56] He was despised and we esteemed him not.
[38:59] Art not worth an estimation.
[39:03] &gt;&gt; That an at an auction it wouldn't sell.
[39:05] How much are you going to pay me to take
[39:06] it off your hands?
[39:08] &gt;&gt; If it was put on offer up, no one would
[39:10] want it. If it WAS ON FACEBOOK
[39:12] MARKETPLACE, SOMEBODY WOULD CHARGE YOU
[39:13] JUST FOR reading the listing.
[39:17] &gt;&gt; There's no beauty THAT WE WOULD WANT IT.
[39:20] &gt;&gt; THERE'S NO ATTRACTIVENESS THAT WE WOULD
[39:22] DESIRE TO PARTAKE IN IT, to be one with
[39:24] it, to be identified with it.
[39:26] This is man's base instincts in nature.
[39:30] THIS IS HIS INSTINCTIVE VALUE
[39:32] PROPOSITION that there is no beauty in
[39:34] Christ.
[39:36] &gt;&gt; David Hume writing at the similar time
[39:38] of Benjamin Franklin said, "Beauty is no
[39:40] quality in things themselves. It exists
[39:43] merely in the mind which contemplates
[39:45] them and each mind perceives a different
[39:47] beauty."
[39:49] Now, is that true? We may say, well,
[39:52] that's true when it comes to an
[39:55] individual's perception. They say
[39:56] perception is reality. That's a reality
[39:58] in certain context.
[40:01] And so he's saying, WELL, BEAUTY IS JUST
[40:02] HAS THERE'S no inherent beauty. It's
[40:04] just whether or not A PERSON THINKS
[40:06] ABOUT it and values it. BUT THEN LET'S
[40:09] APPLY that principle to Isaiah 53. There
[40:12] is no inherent beauty.
[40:15] There is nothing that is inherently
[40:17] pure. IT'S BASED UPON A PERSON'S
[40:20] CONTEMPLATION AND SUBSEQUENT PERCEPTION
[40:23] OR VALUE JUDGMENT of whether or not it's
[40:24] pure and beautiful.
[40:26] &gt;&gt; And let's apply it to Christ.
[40:28] And could we say that if you look AT
[40:30] CHRIST AND YOU JUDGE him sinful, is it
[40:34] true? If you look at the word AND SAY
[40:37] THAT IT'S WRONG, is that in fact make it
[40:39] true? Does that mean there's no inherent
[40:41] quality of truth in the word?
[40:45] &gt;&gt; Come on. The Bible said there was no
[40:47] beauty in him that we should desire him
[40:49] and we did not esteem him as valuable.
[40:51] But in Psalms 27:4 and we say Franklin
[40:54] and Hume and Confucious and these
[40:56] different ones say, "Well, beauty is in
[40:58] the eye of the beholder." Then what are
[40:59] you beholding?
[41:01] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[41:02] &gt;&gt; And when you behold him, what do you
[41:03] see? David said, "One thing have I
[41:05] desired of the Lord." Dear friend,
[41:06] Brother Steven Bryant just been God's
[41:08] been using his gift to write many songs
[41:10] as of late. And one of the songs he was
[41:13] writing is All My Days. and and and I
[41:15] just WANT TO SEEK AFTER you always.
[41:19] One thing have I DESIRED OF THE LORD.
[41:21] ONE THING AND if that one thing I will
[41:23] pursue that will I seek after. Later on
[41:26] in this chapter he says when you said
[41:28] seek my face it's your face I will seek.
[41:30] So he says one thing HAVE I DESIRED.
[41:32] IT'S THAT WHICH WILL MODERATE ALL
[41:34] DECISIONS. IT'S THAT WHICH WILL BECOME
[41:35] THE BOUNDARIES TO ALL VISIONS. IT IS
[41:38] THAT WHICH WILL BE MY GUIDE. ONE THING
[41:40] HAVE I DESIRE. THAT ONE THING WILL I
[41:42] SEEK AFTER THAT I MAY DWELL IN THE HOUSE
[41:44] OF THE LORD ALL THE DAYS OF MY LIFE. AND
[41:46] THEN NOTICE WHERE HE TAKES IT TO BEHOLD
[41:49] THE BEAUTY OF HIS L OF the Lord.
[41:52] &gt;&gt; And to inquire in his temple.
[41:54] &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, THERE IS AN INHERENT
[41:56] beauty in Christ. There is SOMETHING
[41:58] BEAUTIFUL ABOUT GOD THAT DAVID IS
[42:00] SAYING, I WANT TO SEE. DO YOU REALIZE
[42:03] THAT WE CAN CRAFT JUST BY THE BIBLE,
[42:05] WHICH WE BELIEVE THE INSPIRED word of
[42:06] God, and we could just take certain
[42:08] instances and and seemingly objectively
[42:11] PROVE THAT GOD is is homo like a maniac
[42:16] and he's mean and HE'S A NARCISSIST.
[42:18] KILL THEM ALL, WOMEN AND BABIES
[42:19] INCLUDED.
[42:21] &gt;&gt; RIGHT? If that was pulp pot, we'd say,
[42:23] you know, kill him.
[42:25] &gt;&gt; But it's God telling the Israelites and
[42:28] what is it? It's a way that you see God
[42:30] and you see him as harsh, unforgiving,
[42:33] brutal, bloodthirsty.
[42:36] &gt;&gt; And and that's what people may see in
[42:38] David, a man of war.
[42:40] &gt;&gt; A man who shed blood and adulterer,
[42:43] &gt;&gt; but David knew there was a true beauty
[42:45] in God.
[42:46] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[42:47] &gt;&gt; That you just didn't you didn't just see
[42:49] the works, you knew the ways. Amen.
[42:52] &gt;&gt; As God made his ways known unto Moses
[42:54] and his works unto the children of
[42:56] Israel, the children of Israel saw the
[42:58] results, but Moses knew his heart.
[43:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:01] &gt;&gt; He knew the motive and objective. He
[43:03] knew the evil behind the things that
[43:05] were being slain and removed. He knew
[43:06] the purpose OF GOD AND THE OBJECTIVE
[43:08] he's trying to to uh to present. He knew
[43:11] what God was ultimately trying to
[43:13] portray.
[43:15] And David says, "There is a beauty of
[43:17] the Lord."
[43:18] And if I could say this, just enter it
[43:20] into this last section of this sermon
[43:22] this morning.
[43:24] There is a beauty of Christ that we will
[43:26] only see when we behold his face.
[43:30] &gt;&gt; Just as Balum was shown the backside of
[43:32] Israel.
[43:35] &gt;&gt; Just as there's a a way that you could
[43:37] show something in a certain light. What
[43:38] do you say? Unfavorable light.
[43:42] It's that time of year, brothers.
[43:45] Family pictures.
[43:53] Just give me a moment.
[43:57] And what is most important when it comes
[43:59] to family pictures?
[44:01] Light
[44:02] and post-processing filters.
[44:07] &gt;&gt; Don't look at my search history. It's
[44:08] all about adding hair.
[44:12] I was told today that my beard is thin
[44:15] and wiry.
[44:17] and and uh now I got to get my beard
[44:21] trimmed for family pictures.
[44:26] But light is so important because
[44:28] something could be in the wrong light.
[44:29] You can have the best smiles, the best
[44:31] of clothes, carefully curated over
[44:33] months. And if you don't get your
[44:36] pictures at 4:26 p.m.
[44:40] with just the right exposure,
[44:43] the pictures are worthless.
[44:47] And so there is a certain beauty of
[44:49] Christ
[44:51] that can only be seen in his face.
[44:54] &gt;&gt; And that becomes better the more clear
[44:56] he becomes.
[44:58] &gt;&gt; And this is what we see in Matthew
[44:59] chapter 17. This may cause some people
[45:01] to relax a little bit because he's
[45:02] finally at his text. Hopefully this
[45:04] means the end, but it could mean the
[45:06] beginning.
[45:07] &gt;&gt; In Matthew chapter 17 says, "And after
[45:10] six days, Jesus taketh Peter, James, and
[45:12] John, and bringeth them up into a high
[45:14] mountain apart." This is where we're
[45:15] going to see the son of man coming in
[45:17] his kingdom, as it says in Mark, coming
[45:18] in his glory, his beauty.
[45:21] &gt;&gt; This is not the coming that many people
[45:23] are looking to WHEN HE COMES BACK TO
[45:25] EARTH WITH HIS BRIDE TO RULE AND REIGN
[45:27] in millennium. It's not maybe a
[45:28] denominational coming that's got him as
[45:30] a 900 foot Jesus in the cloud. But this
[45:32] is a coming in glory where he reveals
[45:34] himself
[45:35] &gt;&gt; and was transfigured BEFORE THEM. AND
[45:37] HIS FACE DID SHINE AS THE SUN and his
[45:39] raignment was white as the light. HIS
[45:42] FACE DID SHINE AS THE SUN. WE MIGHT JUST
[45:44] SUPERIMPOSE AN IMAGE OF A burning hot
[45:46] molten lava SUN. BUT IT'S NOT SOMETHING
[45:48] TO WHERE IT WAS NO LONGER HUMAN. But it
[45:50] means there was this brilliance or
[45:52] radiance about him,
[45:53] &gt;&gt; A TRANSCENDENT SPLENDOR, THIS UNRIVALED,
[45:56] UNPARALLELED GLORY, UNCONCEALED.
[46:00] He retained the fleshly image. He
[46:02] retained the image of a man. BUT THE
[46:04] BIBLE'S USING WHAT MIGHT SEEM TO BE
[46:06] HYPERBOLE. IT'S BEING DESCRIBED SO THAT
[46:08] YOU COULD SEE THERE'S THIS UNRIVALED
[46:10] BEAUTY that's emanating from him. Oh
[46:12] yeah.
[46:13] &gt;&gt; THAT THIS ONE THAT'S DESCRIBED IN ISAIAH
[46:15] 53, THERE'S NO BEAUTY. WE SHOULD DESIRE
[46:17] HIM. DESPISED AND REJECTED A MAN OF
[46:18] SORROWS ACQUAINTED TO GRIEF. WE HID OUR
[46:20] FACES from him as it were. WE ESTEEMED
[46:22] HIM NOT. THIS manifestation you couldn't
[46:24] take your eyes off of.
[46:26] &gt;&gt; COME ON.
[46:27] &gt;&gt; THIS brilliance was captivating.
[46:31] &gt;&gt; Something you'd be drawn to. I can't
[46:32] take my eyes off this.
[46:37] It was a revealing that was so arresting
[46:40] that the disciples
[46:42] should have just been in this stunned
[46:45] absolute silence.
[46:48] This beauty,
[46:50] breathtaking brilliance, a brilliant
[46:52] beauty.
[46:54] Verse three, and behold, there appeared
[46:55] unto them Moses and Elijah talking with
[46:58] him. Now, I want to suggest this. It's
[47:01] only a suggestion
[47:03] that his face shining as the sun
[47:07] and his arignment white as light. If we
[47:09] could somehow imagine that these words
[47:11] are being used to express the most
[47:12] brilliant beauty you've ever seen and
[47:15] then all of a sudden Moses and Elijah
[47:18] nestle up next to it.
[47:21] You might go, but then your eyes are
[47:23] coming right back to Christ. Reminds me
[47:25] of the time that I had a a friendship
[47:27] for a while with Julio Franco and a
[47:30] professional baseball player who's
[47:31] always my favorite player when I was a
[47:33] little kid, young teenager, and God just
[47:35] by way of my testimony allowed me to
[47:37] become friends with him. I had lunch
[47:38] with him one day and we had gone to
[47:40] lunch and he wanted to go to a bookstore
[47:42] to buy a gospel album that just come out
[47:44] and we walk into the bookstore together
[47:45] and he was in town playing and we walk
[47:47] in and there's this like 18 nyear-old
[47:49] kid sitting there and he sees Jula
[47:51] Franco goes Julio Franco and he looks
[47:54] over at me and he goes Julio Franco
[47:58] right? In other words, YOU JUST HAVE
[48:01] SOME GUY LIKE ME, RIGHT? I'M NOT 67. I'M
[48:04] 5'8 ON MY BEST DAY. AND SO HERE HE'S
[48:08] GOING, "OH MY GOODNESS, JULIO FRANCO,
[48:10] spare Julio Franco. AND HERE'S THE MOST
[48:13] BRILLIANT CHRIST YOU'VE EVER SEEN." And
[48:16] Moses and Elijah saddle up next to him.
[48:18] AND PETER SAYS UNTO JESUS, "LORD, IT IS
[48:21] GOOD FOR US TO BE HERE. If thou wilt,
[48:24] let us make here three tabernacles, one
[48:26] for thee, one for Moses, and one for
[48:27] Elias.
[48:30] To me, there is something that's now
[48:31] arresting about Peter's response.
[48:34] You have Moses the law. You have Elijah
[48:36] the prophets. But there stands the
[48:38] Messiah of which Moses and the prophets
[48:40] the law and the prophets testified of.
[48:43] &gt;&gt; And yes, this is a striking image of
[48:45] vindication. This is a striking image of
[48:47] even the resurrection wherein you have
[48:49] the living saints represented IN ELIJAH
[48:51] AND THE SLEEPING saints represented in
[48:52] Moses are going to be gathered together
[48:54] TO A GLORIFIED CHRIST. YES, THERE'S A
[48:56] LOT THAT'S BEING EXPRESSED HERE. BUT IN
[48:57] THIS VERY MOMENT, PETER'S INSPIRED BY
[48:59] WHAT HE SAW. AND HE WANTS TO BUILD three
[49:02] equal tabernacles,
[49:04] &gt;&gt; habitations,
[49:05] &gt;&gt; altars.
[49:07] If I can say this, trying just trying to
[49:10] make a point here. It's as if Peter was
[49:12] only seeing it skin deep.
[49:15] Here's that carnal value judgment and
[49:17] this knee-jerk reaction to fanaticism.
[49:19] This is that he looks AT IT AND HE'S NOT
[49:21] REALLY GETTING THE PICTURE HERE. MOSES
[49:24] AND ELIJAH ARE NOT THERE TO REPRESENT
[49:26] THE TRINITY. THEY'RE NOT THERE TO
[49:27] REPRESENT H THIS DIVIDING OF GOD INTO
[49:31] THESE OTHER ENTITIES, BUT THEY'RE THERE
[49:32] AS TESTIMONIES OF THE LAW AND THE
[49:34] PROPHETS THAT THIS IS THE MESSIAH.
[49:37] &gt;&gt; THAT THIS IS WHAT WE FORESHADOWED. THIS
[49:39] IS WHAT WE POINTED TO. AND SO WHEN PETER
[49:42] SPEAKS THIS, GOD'S IMMEDIATE RESPONSE
[49:43] WAS WHILE HE HAD SPAKE, BEHOLD, IF I CAN
[49:45] SAY THIS, Peter's opinion was these are
[49:47] all on equal footing. Uh-huh.
[49:50] &gt;&gt; While he yet spake, behold, a bright
[49:52] cloud overshadowed them. This is a
[49:54] symbol of God's presence. Brother
[49:56] Anthony, this is why I really enjoyed
[49:57] your special this morning. Sister
[49:59] Valerie, you're saying on his presence
[50:01] because this is what the light of the
[50:03] countenance means. This is what the face
[50:04] of the Lord means. This is what the
[50:05] tabernacle means. It means his presence.
[50:07] It's a symbol of God's presence. It's a
[50:09] token of his love, his grace, and his
[50:11] favor.
[50:12] &gt;&gt; A bright cloud overshadows. And behold,
[50:14] A VOICE OUT OF THE cloud
[50:17] and said, "This is my beloved son in
[50:19] whom I'm well pleased. Hear ye him."
[50:22] &gt;&gt; In other words, you may there may be
[50:24] Moses and Elijah, but he's given God's
[50:27] given his opinion now.
[50:30] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[50:30] &gt;&gt; and he's not disregarding Moses and he's
[50:32] not disregarding Elijah and he's not
[50:33] doing away with the law and doing away
[50:34] with the prophets, but he's saying in
[50:36] Christ they're made perfect.
[50:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[50:38] &gt;&gt; If you want to accept the law, accept
[50:40] them in Christ. If you want to accept
[50:41] the prophets, accept them in Christ.
[50:44] When the disciples heard it, they fell
[50:45] on their face and were so afraid. And
[50:46] Jesus came and touched them and said,
[50:48] "Arise and be not afraid." And notice
[50:49] what happens. And when they lifted up
[50:51] their eyes, they saw no man save Jesus
[50:54] only.
[50:56] &gt;&gt; In other words, there's something it
[50:58] expresses to us this
[51:01] how clear the gospel is,
[51:04] &gt;&gt; how clear it is when it's revealed to
[51:05] you.
[51:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:07] &gt;&gt; It's Jesus Christ. The word only.
[51:09] nothing else
[51:11] expresses this brightness of the gospel
[51:15] wherein there's oh well there's let us
[51:16] build three tabernacles
[51:18] it's to each his own however you want to
[51:21] serve God whatever you think like this
[51:23] inward beauty where it's like in
[51:25] everyone is an inward deity
[51:29] theqi we all have it right that's and we
[51:33] all have we could just and if we could
[51:35] just center ourselves on the inward
[51:37] divine
[51:39] Right? And we could all get centered.
[51:42] Then we can all begin to communicate one
[51:43] to another as this harmonious whole, one
[51:47] with nature, one with man. And like,
[51:50] okay, if that works for you, that's
[51:51] good. I'm going to go over here to
[51:53] Catholic mass. But we love you're you're
[51:55] just we're all part of the same thing.
[51:57] We all love one another, right? And
[52:00] there's this idea. It's like, well,
[52:01] okay, but the Bible says there's only
[52:03] one only one way to be saved. It's
[52:05] through Jesus Christ. Amen.
[52:10] &gt;&gt; That's what the Bible teaches that if
[52:11] you believe there's a multiplicity of
[52:12] ways it could happen, but then you don't
[52:14] believe the Bible.
[52:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.
[52:17] &gt;&gt; But now he's shining in the brightness
[52:19] of his glory, a bright cloud overshadows
[52:22] him and witnesses. It's in contrast to
[52:24] Exodus chapter 19 where God came in a
[52:26] thick cloud.
[52:28] It was dark IN THIS THICK CLOUD,
[52:31] &gt;&gt; BUT NOW IT'S A BRIGHT CLOUD. UNDER THE
[52:34] LAW, WHICH JUST TESTIFIED OF CHRIST, HE
[52:37] SPEAKS IN A DARK CLOUD. AND IT'S BECAUSE
[52:38] THIS FIRE THAT COMES UPON THE MOUNTAIN,
[52:40] BUT NOW IT'S A BRIGHT CLOUD THAT
[52:42] OVERSHADOWS THEM. AND A VOICE FROM THE
[52:44] CLOUD SAYING, "THIS IS MY SON IN WHOM I
[52:47] DWELL IN WHOM I'M REVEALED, THE ONE THAT
[52:50] WILL MAKE KNOWN TO YOU THE FATHER. IT'S
[52:51] THROUGH CHRIST THAT YOU COME TO KNOW ME,
[52:54] THE WAY, THE TRUTH, THE LIFE." AMEN.
[52:57] &gt;&gt; In Psalms 50:es 1 and 2, the mighty God,
[53:00] even the Lord, hath spoken and called
[53:01] the earth from the rising of the sun
[53:03] into the going down thereof. OUT OF
[53:05] ZION, NOTICE IT SAYS, "THE PERFECTION OF
[53:07] BEAUTY, GOD HATH SHINED."
[53:10] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[53:11] &gt;&gt; Here even IN ZION AT MOUNT
[53:13] TRANSFIGURATION, THE PERFECTION OF
[53:15] BEAUTY,
[53:17] GOD hath shined.
[53:19] &gt;&gt; The perfection completeness. It's the
[53:21] sum of all beauty.
[53:23] &gt;&gt; It is an objective beauty. It is
[53:24] completely beautiful in and out. YOU SAY
[53:26] IF IT'S BEAUTIFUL OUTWARDLY, THE WORD IS
[53:28] BEAUTIFUL OUTWARDLY. YOU SAY IT'S
[53:29] BEAUTIFUL INWARDLY, THE word is
[53:31] beautiful inwardly. IT IS BOTH THE
[53:32] SUBJECTIVE AND OBJECTIVE BEAUTY THAT
[53:34] CANNOT BE RIVALED.
[53:36] &gt;&gt; That you would reject to your own
[53:38] detriment and condemnation. Out of Zion,
[53:41] God shined. This is what's happening in
[53:43] Matthew chapter 17. God radiating,
[53:45] shining, and speaking.
[53:50] It is the brilliance
[53:54] of Christ. And if I could
[53:58] use this, there's several scriptures. I
[54:00] could probably do it in quick order.
[54:04] A person's face
[54:06] is it's enlightening.
[54:10] The Bible uses the phrase the light of
[54:12] my countenance, the brilliance of one's
[54:14] face. It's to to to even use one's face
[54:16] as a symbol of their identity. That's
[54:18] why when we we have passports or
[54:20] driver's license, it it doesn't show
[54:22] your nice kicks, right? Could you just
[54:25] imagine if we were all identified by our
[54:26] shoes?
[54:29] You go, you stand there, you're at the
[54:30] airport, you hand them your passport,
[54:32] and they look at the passport and look
[54:33] down at your shoes and you're like,
[54:34] "You're not wearing WHAT ARE THOSE?"
[54:37] RIGHT? OH, I FORGOT TO WEAR MY IDENTITY.
[54:40] NO, THEY LOOK AT YOUR FACE.
[54:42] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[54:43] &gt;&gt; It reveals your identity. When you see
[54:45] someone's face, it's their presence.
[54:49] &gt;&gt; And do you realize just how much then
[54:51] something can be misinterpreted? How
[54:53] much something could be misunderstood
[54:54] when you don't see their face?
[54:58] &gt;&gt; When when they try to do some uh dog and
[55:01] pony show or some smoke and mirrors AND
[55:03] THEY SAY, "SEE THAT? IT'S CHRIST. SEE,
[55:06] LOOK, it's Jesus."
[55:08] You'll know when you see his face.
[55:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[55:12] &gt;&gt; That's what declares one's presence.
[55:14] The face is also indicative of
[55:16] character. I had a brother, a dear
[55:18] friend of mine that told a story one
[55:20] time. There was always a sister. It was
[55:22] in Pentecostal church and she would
[55:24] always say at the END OF EVERY SERVICE,
[55:26] I SEE JESUS. I SEE JESUS. And one day in
[55:29] the afternoon, they had a kids event.
[55:30] Everybody had balloons and everything.
[55:32] And later on in that service day, the
[55:33] service is winding down and one of the
[55:35] kids had let go of a balloon and it
[55:37] began to work its way to the very top of
[55:39] the outside of the church where there
[55:40] were these windows at the very top. And
[55:42] she started saying, "I SEE JESUS. I SEE
[55:45] I REALLY DO [screaming] SEE HIM." And it
[55:47] was just a balloon.
[55:50] But when you see his face, it's his
[55:52] identity. It's his character. It's his
[55:54] presence. In Job 29:4, "If I laughed on
[55:56] them, they believed it not." Job's
[55:58] response to his persecutors, he says,
[55:59] "In the light of my countenance, they
[56:01] cast not down." What does he mean by the
[56:03] light of his countenance? His smile, his
[56:05] disposition, his attitude, his
[56:08] conviction, his belief.
[56:11] Confidence is revealed by one's face.
[56:14] What is it many times at law enforcement
[56:16] or border patrol? What are they looking
[56:17] for when they begin to ask you what
[56:19] seems to be these really innocuous
[56:20] questions like, "Hey, did you enjoy your
[56:22] time in Mexico?" And you're they're
[56:23] going,
[56:24] "Yes, [snorts]
[56:25] you had a great time." You know who'd
[56:28] you go see? Bob
[56:31] &gt;&gt; Aia. Hey, they're just they're looking
[56:33] at your facial expressions. They're
[56:36] measuring your body response. So what
[56:38] about the light of your countenance?
[56:40] &gt;&gt; Now, now this works two ways. One, do
[56:42] you see Christ in his beauty? But now
[56:44] what's seen on you?
[56:47] &gt;&gt; When people see Christ, does he look
[56:48] like this?
[56:51] &gt;&gt; Is that what they say? Christ just must
[56:53] be angry.
[56:56] &gt;&gt; Psalms 43:3, "For they got not the land
[56:58] in possession by their own sword." Think
[57:00] of how incredible this is. Neither did
[57:02] their own arm save them, but thy right
[57:05] hand and thine arm and the light of thy
[57:07] countenance.
[57:09] SO NOW IT'S JUST NOT MERELY A NICE
[57:11] SMILE, BUT THERE'S POWER IN HIS
[57:12] PRESENCE.
[57:14] &gt;&gt; THERE'S POWER IN HIS CHARACTER BY THE
[57:16] LIGHT OF HIS COUNTENANCE BECAUSE THOU
[57:17] HAS A FAVOR UNTO THEM.
[57:21] THERE'S POWER IN THE LIGHT OF GOD'S
[57:23] COUNTENANCE IN PSALMS 89:15. BLESSED IS
[57:25] THE people that know the joyful sound.
[57:27] THEY SHALL WALK, OH LORD, IN THE LIGHT
[57:28] OF THY COUNTENANCE. IN THE LIGHT OF HIS
[57:30] COUNTENANCE, THERE'S BLESSING. Proverbs
[57:32] chapter 16. Yes, that's my Proverbs
[57:34] verse 15. IN LIGHT OF THE KING'S
[57:35] COUNTENANCE, HIS LIFE AND HIS FAVOR IS
[57:37] AS A CLOUD OF A latter rain. This is
[57:39] what we see in Matthew chapter 17. This
[57:41] is what we see when he reveals himself
[57:43] in the this beautiful end TIME PROPHECY.
[57:46] IN THE LIGHT OF THE KING'S COUNTENANCE,
[57:47] his life.
[57:50] &gt;&gt; SOME MAY SEE JUDGMENT. SOME MAY SEE
[57:52] DEATH. BUT IN HIS EYES ARE FAVOR. AND
[57:55] HIS FAVORS AS THE CLOUD OF THE LATTER
[57:57] RAIN. WHAT DOES HE DECLARE? THE CAPSTONE
[57:58] OF GRACE. Grace
[58:02] &gt;&gt; when we look into his word, this word
[58:04] which has become a new book, he says,
[58:05] "You're looking at me face to face."
[58:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:08] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[58:09] &gt;&gt; We we're looking at that Christ who's
[58:12] looking to us to pardon us,
[58:15] not to judge us.
[58:18] In numbers 6:es 22- 26 this ironic
[58:22] blessing not ironic but ironic blessing
[58:24] and the Lord spake unto Moses saying
[58:25] speak unto Aaron and his son saying on
[58:28] this wise ye shall bless the children of
[58:30] Israel saying unto them the Lord bless
[58:32] thee and keep thee. The Lord make his
[58:35] face shine upon thee and be gracious
[58:37] unto thee. The Lord lift up his
[58:39] countenance upon thee and give thee
[58:41] peace. Notice how these dispositions of
[58:44] grace and peace come by his face,
[58:49] his presence
[58:51] from this light of his countenance,
[58:52] which is the brightness of his beauty.
[58:54] His face did shine as the sun, it's in
[58:57] his brilliant beauty, his unmistakable
[59:00] beauty.
[59:03] If to the children of Israel,
[59:06] it's by the light of his countenance
[59:07] that they were able to possess the land.
[59:10] It's by the light of his countenance
[59:11] that they were blessed people. It's by
[59:13] the light of the countenance that
[59:14] there's life and favor,
[59:16] grace, and peace. It says in 2
[59:18] Corinthians 3:18, and we'll pick up on
[59:20] this next week or maybe Wednesday, but
[59:22] we all with open face beholding as in a
[59:24] glass the glory of the Lord.
[59:27] &gt;&gt; But we all with clarity beholding as in
[59:31] a mirror the beauty of the Lord,
[59:34] &gt;&gt; are changed
[59:36] into the same image from glory to glory.
[59:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Even as by the spirit of the lord
[59:41] &gt;&gt; the beauty of the lord is
[59:42] revolutionizing
[59:44] the beauty of the lord is changing that
[59:46] when we see him partially we see him
[59:48] cryptically when we see him it through a
[59:50] dark glass when we don't see him clearly
[59:53] we can't be changed
[59:55] &gt;&gt; but as we see him more clearly the more
[59:57] we're changed in OTHER WORDS THE BEAUTY
[59:59] OF THE LORD IS LIFECH CHANGING
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; THE MORE THAT WE SEE HIS BEAUTY the more
[1:00:04] that we are changed
[1:00:06] 90 vers8 thou has set our iniquities
[1:00:08] before thee our secret sins in the light
[1:00:10] of thy countenance. I know this may seem
[1:00:11] to be an odd all of a sudden, how did we
[1:00:14] end up here?
[1:00:16] But I raise it to make this point.
[1:00:19] It's impossible to not be changed by his
[1:00:20] presence.
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:00:23] &gt;&gt; Impossible.
[1:00:25] Because when we stand before him, all
[1:00:28] things are made clear.
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; That's right. your calling, your
[1:00:32] predestination, your election,
[1:00:36] his grace for you, his love, his
[1:00:38] forgiveness. All these things are laid
[1:00:40] there to receive and to accept. But then
[1:00:42] also our sins and our iniquities to
[1:00:44] disavow.
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; And therefore, our response will
[1:00:48] determine whether we are changed for
[1:00:50] better or for worse.
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:00:53] &gt;&gt; In the beauty of the Lord and the
[1:00:54] revealing of his character, we see what
[1:00:57] we ought to be.
[1:00:59] &gt;&gt; With the spirit of the Lord, there is
[1:01:00] liberty. It's the verse that precedes
[1:01:01] this in 2 Corinthians CHAPTER 3. LIBERTY
[1:01:03] TO WHAT? BE WHATEVER we want. That's
[1:01:05] what people have interpreted it to mean.
[1:01:07] WHERE THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD, THERE'S
[1:01:08] LIBERTY. You do you. You do you. You do
[1:01:10] you. You do you. Scream, shout, dance,
[1:01:12] kick somebody over, yell, falsely
[1:01:15] prophesy, DO WHATEVER YOU WANT. To each
[1:01:17] his own. Where the spirit of the Lord
[1:01:18] is, there's liberty to do whatever you
[1:01:19] want. No, it means liberty to become
[1:01:20] like Christ.
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; Liberty to become the word.
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; And when we look into the word of God,
[1:01:27] we see what we ought to be. Yes.
[1:01:29] &gt;&gt; When the word has an ought, we see what
[1:01:31] we ought to be. And therefore, it also
[1:01:33] reproves what we are
[1:01:35] &gt;&gt; and what we cannot be.
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; And we'll either say yes to the word and
[1:01:40] trust that it's God in him both to will
[1:01:43] and to do
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; of his good pleasure.
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; Musicians, if you come, I'd like to read
[1:01:48] one final scripture in Psalms verse 4 to
[1:01:51] two. Excuse me. Psalms chapter 4:es 2-6.
[1:01:56] I read this because it's challenging. Oh
[1:01:59] ye sons of men, how long will you turn
[1:02:01] my glory into shame?
[1:02:04] The prayer is that the beauty of the
[1:02:06] Lord would be seen on us. The prophecy
[1:02:09] is that his glory will be seen on thee
[1:02:12] at the rising of the sun. How long will
[1:02:14] you love vanity and seek after leasing?
[1:02:18] Say love.
[1:02:20] But know that the Lord hath set apart
[1:02:22] him that is godly for himself. The Lord
[1:02:26] will hear when I call unto him.
[1:02:29] Stand in awe and sin not. Commune with
[1:02:32] your own heart upon your bed and be
[1:02:34] still say law. Offer the sacrifices of
[1:02:37] righteousness and put your trust in the
[1:02:39] Lord. There be many that say who will
[1:02:43] show us any good? What is beautiful?
[1:02:46] What is pure? What is truth? So the
[1:02:48] prayer is Lord lift thou up the light of
[1:02:51] thy countenance upon us.
[1:02:55] How is it that we can turn this shame
[1:02:57] into glory? Through his face.
[1:03:01] By seeking his will, seeking the Lord.
[1:03:05] And if I could say this as we close,
[1:03:06] seeking God's face is not an act of
[1:03:09] physical worship.
[1:03:11] Right? that this is how kind of what
[1:03:13] we've distilled it down to that seeking
[1:03:15] the Lord's face is what we do when the
[1:03:17] music is right and our hands are lifted
[1:03:20] and we're seeking him through this uh
[1:03:24] act of worship. But to seek his face is
[1:03:27] the pursuit of perfect beauty.
[1:03:30] To seek his face is to seek a
[1:03:32] life-changing experience.
[1:03:34] To seek his face is to allow the light
[1:03:36] of his beauty, this brilliant beauty to
[1:03:39] shine upon us that there our shame might
[1:03:41] be turned into glory.
[1:03:44] That we would no longer love vanity or
[1:03:47] seek after leasing. That we could be set
[1:03:49] apart distinct and different.
[1:03:53] It's an act of seeking God to find his
[1:03:55] presence, that brilliant beauty, to know
[1:03:58] his will and then yield to it.
[1:04:01] Not just to be in his presence and not
[1:04:03] be changed. Not to just be in his
[1:04:06] presence and feel raptured up for a
[1:04:07] moment, but to seek his face and through
[1:04:10] the revealing of his face, we know what
[1:04:12] his will is. And in that moment, we have
[1:04:13] a decision to yield to it.
[1:04:18] And when we truly see this,
[1:04:21] when you can see that this Christ,
[1:04:25] then we can say it's it really is the
[1:04:27] word only.
[1:04:28] It really is Jesus Christ only.
[1:04:33] And if we can come to that place where
[1:04:35] we're seeking his face for the purpose
[1:04:37] of knowing his will and yielding [music]
[1:04:38] to it and then the light of our
[1:04:40] countenance be not cast down, then we
[1:04:42] begin to reveal the nature, character,
[1:04:44] identity, and presence of Christ. Then
[1:04:46] others will see the brilliant beauty of
[1:04:48] Christ in you. Now, they may see what we
[1:04:51] know to be objectively a brilliant
[1:04:54] beauty and they may call it something
[1:04:55] else,
[1:04:57] but it's worth the risk.
[1:05:00] DO YOU KNOW WHY?
[1:05:02] BECAUSE somebody's going to see it and
[1:05:05] say, "I don't know what it is,
[1:05:09] but there's something about this."
[1:05:12] And it's going to be a draw. It's going
[1:05:14] to be the salt of the earth. It's going
[1:05:16] to be the light. So let your light
[1:05:19] shine.
[1:05:21] Don't be afraid to immanate the beauty
[1:05:22] of God. Don't try to change it to fit
[1:05:24] the taste of Leodysia. Because you know
[1:05:26] what? As soon as you try to fit their v
[1:05:28] vision of beauty, they're going to say,
[1:05:29] "You're oldfashioned anyways."
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; That is so yesterday. Nobody does that
[1:05:33] anymore. They're going like, "Oh, look
[1:05:35] at them trying to pull off that look.
[1:05:38] Look at them. They're just trying."
[1:05:40] You're never going to be able to pull
[1:05:42] off an authentic worldliness.
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; That's right. It's only when you're in
[1:05:47] the world that you're being a hypocrite
[1:05:49] because you are called to be a luminary,
[1:05:50] a lightbearer of Christ's word. AND
[1:05:53] THAT'S WHY YOU CAN'T FIT INTO THESE
[1:05:54] WORLDLY SOCIAL SYSTEMS. YOU'LL ONLY FIND
[1:05:57] YOUR PLACE IN YOUR AUTHENTIC SELF IN
[1:05:58] BEING A CHRISTIAN. AND THEREFORE, JUST
[1:06:00] BE THE CHRIST THAT YOU'RE CALLED TO BE.
[1:06:03] AND DON'T WORRY ABOUT WHAT THE CRITICS
[1:06:05] HAVE TO SAY. SOMEONE WILL SEE YOUR LIGHT
[1:06:07] AND SAY, "WHAT IS IT THAT LIT YOU,
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; BRO? Why are you so lit?
[1:06:16] Hey, THERE'S GOING TO BE SOMETHING THAT
[1:06:17] SAYS NOW THERE'S SOMETHING TO THIS AND
[1:06:20] THEY WON'T REAL may they may not realize
[1:06:22] it yet but they've seen the brilliant
[1:06:24] beauty of Christ and then Christ begins
[1:06:27] to be imprinted in their lives and they
[1:06:29] come to know him in that personal way
[1:06:31] which is necessary. God help us to not
[1:06:33] only see the brilliant beauty of Christ
[1:06:35] but to be
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; the brilliant beauty of Christ. Let's
[1:06:38] stand. Let's pray together. Our gracious
[1:06:40] heavenly father, Lord, there is so much
[1:06:44] more that could be said on this subject,
[1:06:46] but today as we leave it here through
[1:06:48] this [music] very lengthy service, I
[1:06:50] pray that there would be a theme that
[1:06:53] just unfolds from the scripture of
[1:06:55] seeking your face to know you.
[1:06:59] Not just in an act of physical worship,
[1:07:02] but in the sacrifice of righteousness,
[1:07:06] in the pursuit of perfect beauty.
[1:07:09] that Lord, I'm acknowledging my sins and
[1:07:11] my failures in your presence. For it is
[1:07:13] the light in the light of your
[1:07:14] countenance that I see my mistakes and
[1:07:16] my weaknesses. But Lord, you would not
[1:07:19] reveal a weakness unless your strength
[1:07:22] could be made strong.
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; Lord, you would not reveal sins or
[1:07:27] expose them. And they would not be come
[1:07:30] up before you in the light of your
[1:07:31] countenance if you were not willing to
[1:07:34] cast those sins behind your back.
[1:07:37] So therefore, Lord, we plead the blood.
[1:07:40] As we stand before you in your presence,
[1:07:42] scriptures become more clear
[1:07:46] that as in the light of your countenance
[1:07:48] did my sins come, but then you cast them
[1:07:51] behind your back.
[1:07:54] No longer accusing, no longer standing
[1:07:55] in the way. And Lord, with my sins being
[1:07:58] confessed and being repented of, Lord, I
[1:08:02] pray that I could see you in a more
[1:08:03] clear way,
[1:08:05] with more beauty,
[1:08:10] that in doing [music] so,
[1:08:16] I could be a light to my children.
[1:08:22] Lord, I don't want to make
[1:08:24] the message,
[1:08:27] smutty.
[1:08:29] I don't want to make it unclean or
[1:08:31] impure.
[1:08:33] I don't want to twist it and pervert it
[1:08:35] and make it into something that's
[1:08:36] worldly. It's watered down, that's
[1:08:38] powerless.
[1:08:41] And Lord, I don't want to make it
[1:08:42] unnecessarily unattractive. Because
[1:08:44] truly to the carnal mind, it's not
[1:08:46] beautiful.
[1:08:49] It's demanding.
[1:08:52] The word is demanding. It just doesn't
[1:08:54] merely ask for our hearts, but then it
[1:08:55] even gives the evidence of [music] a
[1:08:56] changed life as a litmus test.
[1:09:01] Paul in the New Testament teaching how
[1:09:02] that we ought to behave as husbands and
[1:09:04] wives, how we
[1:09:05] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:09:05] &gt;&gt; ought to behave and children in manner
[1:09:08] of giving, in manner of living, in a
[1:09:10] manner of dress and appearance and
[1:09:11] conversation.
[1:09:14] And Lord, the world calls it ugliness,
[1:09:17] but is a sacred symmetry of your word
[1:09:19] that you find beautiful.
[1:09:21] And whereas there's many devices in our
[1:09:23] hearts that come to opinions about
[1:09:24] beauty and in our eyes subjectively
[1:09:28] there may be a beauty we want to take
[1:09:29] the counsel of the Lord. Your opinion of
[1:09:31] what is beautiful, Lord, we'll take no
[1:09:32] matter what it may make us look like
[1:09:34] outwardly.
[1:09:37] I want your beauty to be seen on me.
[1:09:40] Lord, I pray today that you could work a
[1:09:43] miracle in our lives by changing
[1:09:47] our taste for certain things that we
[1:09:50] have found beautiful.
[1:09:52] That Lord, you would take away these
[1:09:55] idols that we have lifted up, that we
[1:09:57] have admired and esteemed as powerful,
[1:09:59] as heroic, as beautiful, and let us see
[1:10:02] the beauty of Christ.
[1:10:04] and no longer make vulgar heroic. No
[1:10:07] longer make selfishness desirable. No
[1:10:09] longer make violence beautiful,
[1:10:11] but Lord, we can make Christ the word
[1:10:15] desirable to our eyes.
[1:10:18] And when examined by that brilliant
[1:10:20] beauty, Lord, may we be changed by it to
[1:10:23] be reflectors of it. Luminaries,
[1:10:24] lightbearsers, bless your people, I
[1:10:27] pray. In the name of Lord Jesus Christ,
[1:10:29] we ask this. Amen.
