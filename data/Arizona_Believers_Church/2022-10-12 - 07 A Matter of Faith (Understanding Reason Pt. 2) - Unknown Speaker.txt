TRANSCRIPT
========================================
we continued on this subject a matter of Faith so that's been our subject this is the um seventh service on this and my uh title tonight is understanding reason this is part two on that so continue on the subject of a a matter of Faith as opposed to it being a matter of fact it's looking at things as a matter of faith and then um understanding reason and I think even that phrase there maybe a little bit of tension grabbing to say understanding reason and what we're looking at really is how that reason and understanding function alongside Faith because there's a way that we think about faith and it has no reason in it at all and it's correct to view it that way we think of Faith as a sick sense that's not relying on our minds or our thinking power but there is a way that we could think about reason that we make it something it's not and then we make enemies out of reason and faith and it'll actually put us as human beings in a hard spot because we have a mind that reasons we have thought processes we have intelligence and so I want to start with Ephesians chapter 1 we're going to read this as a a kind of backgrounding where we were last time and we're picking up where we had to leave off before in Ephesians chap 1: 17 and 18 it says the Lord the that the god this is Paul's prayer now that the god of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of Glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and Revelation so it's the spirit of wisdom and the spirit of Revelation it being that one spirit in the knowledge of him the eyes of your understanding being enlightened that you may know what is the hope of this call of his calling and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the Saint so Paul's prayer is uh certainly that they would have faith he rejoiced to hear of their faith we read in El elsewhere and that was the most prominent thing that's what gets you into the body of Christ that's what gives you this spirit is by faith but then now that we're filled with faith he prayed that that faith inside of us would enrich us through the spirit of wisdom and Revelation in the knowledge of Christ so it's not something separate you don't get born again say I got the Holy Ghost now I want to go get a doctorate in something and I want to get educated no but there's a way that we can grow in the spirit of wisdom and Revelation in the knowledge of Christ and if this happens it says the eyes of our understanding will be enlightened and being enlightened we will know this is kind of a the outcome of the process what is the hope of his calling and what the riches of the glor of his inheritance is in the Saints so there's there's things to understand there's things to unfold things to know and Paul's writing it to where wisdom Revelation knowledge and understanding are to give us to give us knowledge or so that we can know the hope we can know the riches so we have faith that we have them we because we have faith we have hope but now there's a deeper knowledge that we could have about these things that feeds our faith and encourages us and so whereas we and and we know that there is a wisdom of this world and there's a Godly wisdom there is a faith and there's a wisdom that is opposed to it and that's where brother R says wisdom versus faith that lean not to thine own understanding and we're not wanting to go in our own wisdom but there is a Godly understanding there is a Godly wisdom and so instead of kind of instigating a fight between faith and and reason we could or even faith and wisdom and faith and knowledge and faith and understanding we we need to look at it the right way to to uh not necessarily uh deescalate the conflict but maybe resolve the perceived conflict that faith has with reason and the way that we suggested that last time is instead of saying that reason is bad and faith alone is good but find out how that reason is subject to Faith In other words establish the order of dependency we and God is Not relying Upon Our wisdom God is Not relying upon our our Humanity God is Not relying upon us for for insight for wisdom and knowledge but our humanity and our reason is dependent entirely upon God and that's and so when we begin to establish dependency that my knowledge is a dependent upon God my wisdom is dependent upon God my understanding uh my thought process my rationality my logic all that we want to make subject to God because brother ROM tells us what happens when man lets loose of his faith in God and gives himself over to wisdom alone he can get from the Earth to the Moon he can send a telescope into the furthest reaches of space that's giving us some phenomenal images of what's out there but has no character within his heart does not have the humility to to uh even though he sees how big this universe is and creation is doesn't have humility to repent for his sins so when he lets go of his faith in God man can accomplish a lot but the order the dependency has been broken so the and it's the independency of wisdom and knowledge and understanding that causes the issue so we must stay in all our getting get understanding and and and we know wisdom is the principal thing and so we want to have that but not independent of God's word not independent of God because it's dependent upon God now the the scripture that we stopped at last time is in 1 Peter chapter 3:1 15 and and Peter writing this says but sanctify the Lord God in your hearts and be ready always so this is a Readiness that we ought to always have be ready always to give an answer and so this is suggesting that you never know when you're going to be asked but you need to be able to give an answer to give an answer to every man that askthe a reason of the hope that is in you and to do it with meekness and fear so we scripturally must always answer every time someone ask us what's the reason for her our hope and every time do it with meekness and fear it doesn't say say on occasion when you feel good but if anyone's ever inquiring and asking we ought to be in a place where we can answer what's the reason for your hope what's your expectation why do you have faith and why do you believe and why are you looking forward to a Rapture why do you believe in healing and why and ask us these things he says you sanctify God in your hearts and with meekness and fear be ready or with meekness and fear answer every man who ask you what is the reason of Hope now that word there reason it's a familiar word to us message Believers the word is logos and so it's we to be we have to when we are asked the logos of Our Hope which is the cause the basis the grounds for it it could be even used to to say what's the rationale for your hope and when logos is used in this way it speaks it's it speaks of the condition of the mind your mental state what are you thinking what is your rationale what is your basis what is your uh what is your your grounds or your cause for having hope brother bam tells us that logos is the thought or concept it's the reasoning that's what we're looking at it's the the thought or concept behind the speech uh I could right now I could say duck right and some people may look down Others May look around for a duck right but what You' so what you'd want to know is what was what was he thinking when he said duck what what was the thought what was the concept behind that and then my literal word carries the thought and and so that's what we understand about the word of God the word the logos are the thoughts of God expressed and so it's not just the verbalization that we want to catch in the Rama or the word but we want to know God's heart we want to know his mind we want to know what he was thinking and and what his his inspiration was behind it so it says when man asks you what's the reason of your hope then you begin to think what's my basis what's my cause why do I have hope and then do it in such a way to where you can say it with meekness and fear knowing that you stand on the absolute truth now reason is also if we just defined it by a dictionary it's explanation or justification for something a reason is that motive for acting your reason why did you do that it's your reason for thinking something acting a certain way it's the cause that explains something why is it this way and you're giving the reason the cause for something and reason is also the power of orderly thought the power of to think rationally to think logically when someone is well reasoned or someone is within reason or or we say maybe they're saying or they're in their right Minds it's speaking of someone who has the power of orderly thought things are fitting together and things make sense and that's also what we would refer to as reason now I'm not asking us now to put everything on reasons as long as I'm just thinking clearly no because God doesn't always line up with what we think is logical right God doesn't always do things that you know by our principles of what makes sense so it's a logic or logos that relates to a Godly wisdom and something on a higher order I I think we've touched on some of these things before but if none of us knew about the Bible but you found out that there was a judge who was having immediated dispute between two women who were claiming to be the mother of the same baby none of us would say oh grab a sword yeah totally just cut it in half and just tell the parents that's what you're going to do is just cut it in half and divide it to each one none of us would have said that right especially these days like let's just DNA test let's just go out and do it and solon's like save the lab guys time I'll solve this right now on the spot right because it was a higher wisdom doesn't seem to make much sense maybe but it was a higher wisdom it was on a different order it knew the heart of the mothers it it knew human behavior and human interaction so God's way is always the best way think we said last time that all truth is God's truth there's nothing true that can't wind itself some way back to God in his program and his will and so this reason when he says that we ought to be able to give an answer to every man that ask us a reason of Our Hope and that Paul is saying that our we might have the spirit of wisdom and Revelation and the knowledge of him that enlightens our eyes of understanding that we may know what is the hope of this calling so there's there's things that God wants to do within us to give us get us to this place where we can give an answer or literally give a reason says in Isaiah 1 verse 18 come now and let us reason together saith the Lord it continues and I think it's a very beautiful much more beautiful thought than I can um express it tonight in the time that we want to give this but he says though your sins be as Scarlet they shall be white as snow though they be red like crimson shall be his wool what a tremendous outcome from come let us reason together this is what he's asking come now and let us reason together in the Hebrew saying let's let's let's get together and let's weigh things out let let's consider come let us consider things together and even in a way that it's written come let us reason let's argue the case and the in the context of your sins though your sins be as Scarlet they can be white as snow though they be red like Crimson they shall be as rule let's carefully consider what is required to deal with sin let let's come and reason together it it's far different than just saying you know you you just need to do what I say but come let's talk about this come God actually calling for a conference God calling people to come together a a and and to to exercise uh this openness to hear what he has to say think about what he is saying I think this fits so well with what we were ministering on on Sunday that there's just a lot that's welding up within me hoping that we recognize how the word is trying to put us in the right mind and put us in the right frame of thinking even as we talked a lot about just being in a better mood the word is wanting to kind of put us in the right kind of mood not so that we can have an alternative to CBD or all these sorts of things that kind of could put us in in these moods but so that we could be in a condition to have relationship with God God's goal is not just to make us happy but to put us in relationship with him and so the the right mood is to put us in the frame of mind to allow the word to work effectively in our lives it's not just as maybe sometimes the gospel is just phrased as well this is just a way to live your best life now right as Dr Olstein would say you know we want to live our best life now I don't I don't think I have the teeth for it now in Acts chapter 17 verses 2 to5 and we're reading the the real meat of this is going to be in the first two verses and uh I'm realizing now I that I I failed to put a scripture in here and so if I if I if I get later in the sermon you just take I'm just going to put this puzzle piece out there and if I forget to put it in you'll have to put it in later so you hold the final piece to the puzzle tonight but Paul comes to a place when he's preaching and they've erected an altar to the unknown God and they were worshiping something that was unknown they could worship but there was something unknown hidden and that's contrary to the nature of God cuz yet he is a God that hides himself but part of that is he's a God that reveals himself and so if it's just a God that's a mystery then that's not our God because our God remains mysterious but has a desire to unfold himself and reveal himself and so Paul demonstrates that he didn't want the people just to worship an unknown God or to just take me at my word and and and kind of put the blinders on and do what I say but his prayer was that they would come to know Christ he he was so articulate and expressing this for himself personally and for the believer and here in Acts chapter 17 starting with verse two we'll read to verse 5 uh because we want to read about the the certain lewd fellows of A baser Sort and it says in verse two and Paul as his manner was went in unto them because this is his custom and three Sabbath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures so it wasn't just Paul according to tradition wasn't Paul in his wit or wisdom but he reason with them out of the scriptures and then this is this is a further uh amplification of how he reasoned opening and alleging that Christ must needs have suffered and risen again from the dead and that this Jesus whom I preach unto you is Christ this is what Paul believed this Jesus that I preach to you is Christ now he could have just said Jesus is Christ this Jesus I preached to he is the Messiah he is Christ but now he carried three different sabbaths opening the scriptures and and laying out opening and alleging arguing reasoning setting forth in a scriptural way the reasons why Christ was the Messiah now let's not mistake ourselves Paul could not logically argue it to the point to where all man could accept it to the satisfa to God's satisfaction because that takes Faith but yet he still wanted to commit himself to arguing from the scriptures in a way that would persuade man and even I believe it's a grippa oh Paul you almost persuaded me to be a Christian and Paul said I wish I did I wish I would have done it why because his words were to be persuasive the teaching was to be persuasive and he says very clearly he reasoned with them out of the scriptures opening alleging that Christ was the Messiah and he was to have suffered and to died upon a cross and rose again after three days he was reasoning with them not not in a worldly way but according to the word of God to open up their understanding to accept the truth of scripture and verse four and some of them believed and consorted with Paul and silus and of The Devout Greeks a great multitude and of the chief women not a few so through his reasoning with him and opening alleging it was bringing people to believe but the Jews which believed not so no matter how much he reasoned in the scripture they reasoned against him because of their prior Traditions they didn't want to open up to understand these things moved with Envy took unto them certain ude fellows of the baser sort and gathered a company and set all the city on an uproar and assaulted the house of Jason and sought to bring them out to the people what caused this Paul reasoning with them out of the scripture opening and alleging that Christ was to be crucified that he was to raise again on the third day and that Jesus was the Messiah he was the Christ I hope you can see I know that's just a few scriptures that actually use the word reason but I hope that you can see that on some level now you you give it you can give it the emphasis that God would want to place in your heart on some level we're using the power of reason when we when we're hearing the word of God to and we're wrestling with the things of God on some level we're using our minds initially right because that's what first deals with the words as they come the word come and someone say Jesus Christ died for your sins well your brain has to make sense of that sentence first and then there's the ability in your soul if you're not born again to either reject that thought or accept that thought and when you accept that thought and you and you re and you believe that you you come to a place of faith that if you walk in obedience to the scripture God will seal you with the baptism of the Holy Ghost repenting and being baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you're born again you could be born again by the word of God but first you in your mind you had to make sense of what you were hearing not figure it all out but it something had to resonate in your heart you had to be put in the right mind that's where brother bam emphasizes I know this may be some repetition from Sunday that you want to accept Christ when you're in your right mind amen well you still have the power of orderly thought now in the sermon Paradox this is the the the the businessman's breakfast on April 18th in 1964 he quotes from Mark 11: 22 Jesus said in St Mark 11:22 if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart but believe that you said what you said will come to pass you can have what you said now we believe that right Absol we've been through this scripture quite a bit this year we absolutely believe this and brother B says but you're hold on what do you mean he says but that takes motive and objective so now what brother Ram's doing is he believes this but he knows that when God speaks something there there's order in the word of God right and that this this just G take this and throw it off to the side and say this works out of context no it works within the character and nature of God brother B said that operates according to a law of faith and so he says but that takes motive and objective and I hope you're listening to this part here of course you got to have a reason for it you got to have a reason for what speaking into the mountain and say that it's moved this this isn't a game this isn't show and tell this isn't well you know we've got power to create a world and go live on it and I'll just prove it to you never going to happen happen that way says you've got to have a reason for what speaking to the mountain and asking it to be moved so there's power in the word of God to move a mountain and that power is going to operate according to your motive and objective first you find in the word of God if it's if it's true now I'm not going to just be able to exercise that regardless of what I'm thinking the word of God is true it's a seed it's powerful but I'm not I don't have access to use the word of God if my mind and my spirit aren't in harmony with the with the the intent of God's logos the thought behind what he said so brother Bram and the next this is but that takes motive and objective of course you got to have a reason for it now notice this you can't have faith unless you got some reason that's a heavy statement you cannot have faith unless you got some reason now this makes a lot of sense if you think about it yes sir you say you've got faith what's that oh Faith you know faith I no I don't know what faith is tell me what faith faith is is is when you be when you have faith or faith is when you believe believe what believe the word well what why do you believe the word because I have faith right and like yeah okay right there's a point where no there's more to Faith right there's absolutely more to Faith that you you talk to a Jew about what their faith was they'll tell you a lot of stuff right why because they have a basis for their faith they have a reason for their faith and he's saying you can't have faith unless you got some reason hey there's a check right there for all of us what is it you're believing in what is it you're believing for what is it that holds up your theology or what you're believing in and ask yourself what's my reason for it and what's the basis at the end of the day what's holding up my truth I think we've shared this before and if I'm starting to repeat myself pray for me but the the story of how in Europe when they begin to realize that maybe the Earth wasn't flat and one of the philosophers or the great scientists in the day this is hundreds of years ago this just didn't happen a couple weeks ago and and he was given a talk on how the world is not flat it is round and a woman objected she said sir I'll have you to know that the Earth is flat and it's held up upon the back of a giant tortoise and the philosopher wasn't going to argue the point but he just said ma'am could you please tell me what's holding up the turtle and she said sir it's Turtles all the way down and that's a lot of people's theology that is a lot of people's Faith it's Turtles all the way down but we as Believers have to have a reason for our faith and it better not be Turtles it's not just Turtles all the way down we have a place we can come back to doesn't mean everybody has to agree or everybody has to see what it is but we have a basis he says you cannot have faith unless you have a reason and now he amplifies this as I tried to say last night right some people's faith is in their textbook good some people's faith is in something else but depends on where your faith is I want to believe God's word what he says is true so there's our basis there's our reason then I've got to see whether it's his will or not then if it is his will I got to check out my motive my excuse me got to check out my objective to it and then my motive in doing it there's a lot to unpack there and we won't uh I think there's a lot to Fellowship on in that well what is what is objective I'll check out my objective to it and my motive in doing it if I do it because I say well I'm going over the mountain here there's a mountain before me there's a million people on that side perishing I got a 100 million over here I'm preaching to well if I can't get over around or under the mountain or nothing and yet Something in My heart keeps telling me go over the mountain go to them go to them and I can't get over it now Jesus said they shall move this mountain now the thing of it is first what if I say I never created that in there there something created that it's for good cause because why would I go to one a million when 100 million here are perishing on this side but it's something in my heart saying go over on that side right so he's thinking more deeply about this well I got an invitation to go I can't get this mountain out of the way I'm just going to have faith to believe this is going to happen now if you put yourself in a real world situation sometimes the things we believe for and that maybe we can even try to find a basis in the word for he wants me to prosper but then you start trying to nail down what's your motive and objective what's created that desire in you to do it and when it's just to get a good picture for Instagram things start falling apart right when it's just to outdo your neighbor because they have this or try to keep up with your family members what it is whatever it is you're believing God for can immediately Begin to Fall Apart because you because though you may be able to find something in the word to say that's your faith your motive and objective undermine what trying to accomplish and he that's just he's using an example for himself there's a million people over there perishing there's a 100 million people here so I could stay here why would I want to go to a million when I could preach to 100 million but something in my heart is creating this desire and he's saying that it wasn't you that put it there says he says that there's there's something that's uh that something that's in your heart and Jesus says you could say to this mountain be moved now let me just find where we were is that where I was but it says in your heart go over on the other side he says now the first thing I'll have to say well if I go over there this side can only pay me so much a month and over there they come on all of us right well this job here pays a lot more and this job here doesn't pay quite as much and he's looking at that if that is that what your barometer is right is that why you make the decision decisions you make I was fellowship with my wife this past week cuz to me one thought this keeps coming to me I hear so many stories and I think of the saying why sit there till you die good why do people do it why do people endure what they have knowing that God has more but they say well what this we got this and well that and well this and well that and what you've said is all this than that means more than pleasing God means more than the salvation of your children me means more than the word of God because you say I know it I know this would be better I know this would please the Lord or I want to do this but the weather but the job but this and but that and you might as well just say all that means more than what you just said you really want and what you think is right according to the will of God so this this is really applicable Beyond just a minister praying about where to go to and who to preach for and how big the offering is going to be yes sir he says see my motive is not right my objective is not right no well what if I say no I don't care about the money but when I get over there someday the ages to come they'll put up a great big monument and say brother brandom the great missionary then still my motive is not right I hope that you can make this applicable to us and how our pride can work sometimes and the reason why we want things to to work out and if we're honest with ourselves you say you know what I realize at the end of the day I want that to happen because I don't want to look bad in front of somebody else or or this will make me look better or this is what I've always wanted it really becomes a lot L of self-examination says then my motive is not right but when I say I don't care if they ever know who went over there he's just in my heart then I'll speak to that mountain it'll happen it's got to but you see your motive and your objective depends on who you are and what business right your motive and the objective depends on who you are and what business you need to think about who you are and what your business is and he says that's where the church misses it so far they get worked up now think of this tying into intellectual Faith they get worked up in an emotion and first thing you know in enthusiasm right enthusiasm inspiration emotion but they never check it with the word he says you don't stop to check it back here again check there for sure talking about the word then it's thus sayith the Lord see whether it's right so it kind of gives us the hierarchy check the word see if it's right check your motive and your objective like we're to check all these things we're to think about these things we're examine these things we're could look at the word of God it lines up with the word of God but why am I wanting to do this what's my purpose in doing this what what am I trying to accomplish and so he's giving us these great tools and he recognizes that it's easy for us to get worked up in Emotion worked up in enthusiasm and never stop to consider first is it his will second what's my reason in doing it what's my purpose reason and purpose in doing it so brother Bram takes motive and objective and he wraps it up into reason because he says you cannot have faith unless you got some reason and he says in order to understand reason we begin to think about motive and objective motive and objective establish our basis to think something our basis to act out something so as brother bam says it Faith suggests some reason you cannot have faith unless you've got some reason because even in this sense we realize and I think I'm kind of setting you up a little bit so stay real tight to this our thoughts and our reasons can be detrimental to our faith so you can't say thought doesn't matter reason doesn't matter it absolutely does because the wrong ones hinder our faith the wrong attitude towards the word of God will hinder the word of God being effective so we've got to give some thought to our reason to purpose to motive and objective now Luke Chapter 9: 57-62 uh that was that the first page was a lot of fun you all are really listening tonight I'm enjoying just go with through this word but I I I don't want to belabor this and I'm time may be getting away from me for a Wednesday but Luke 9: 57 to 62 and we'll read we'll amplify a little bit about halfway and it came to pass that as they went in the way and I'm going to use this to kind of I'm going to call back to everything we've just said in the first bit of the sermon and now this is a real world example of Jesus now identifying these principles that brother bram's teaching us says it came to pass that as they went in the way a certain man said unto him Lord I will follow thee withs soever thou goest now this is the man of his own accord his own volition I'll go anywhere you go I'm comes running to him I'll follow you because Jesus enters into another Village he just kind of had some of the Samaritans reject him he he he continues on and enters into another Village and as he comes a man saying I will follow you I'm going to be a follower I'll go wherever you go and Jesus's response is that that shocking response right instead of saying hey come on let's do this he says Foxes have holes and birds of the air have Nest but the son of man hath not where to lay his head if I can say it this way you say you want to follow me but think about why you you say you're willing to go with me wherever I go but you really need to think about what your motive is in your heart and what it is you're trying to accomplish because if you think you're going to get popular following me if you think you're always going to eat the best bread and the best fish following me if you all if you think you're going to be someone great in the in in an Earthly Kingdom if you follow me think again and so he's asking him about his motive his incentive for acting the reason that makes him want to do something the reason why he wants to follow What is prompting your action that's what's meant by Foxes have holes birds have Nest but I don't have a place to lay my head because you say you want to go with me everywhere I go but are you willing to go homeless that's right it's it's looking in his heart brother bam said as long as your motive is wrong no matter what your OB Ive is but your motive to that objective is wrong then it'll never work so if we were so listen I say this way therefore deeper thought is required right oh this is what I want to do I want to follow Jesus why I want to do this I want to do that you need to think more deeply about what it is you're asking because his objective think about Jesus's answer isn't like we can make this happen we can make this work come on he says something to cause pause something to cause the man to I want to do this I want to do this even in the same way that he dealt with the rich ruler what can I do to have eternal life keep you know keep the Commandments oh I've done it all since my youth Jesus knew exactly where to make it where it hurts well just go sell all you have and give to the poor and follow me right he's uncovering motive and willingness and what's really deep within someone's heart so this person we could say his objective was good right I I I want to follow Christ if someone said brother Aaron I'm willing to follow Christ I'm going to follow this message wherever it goes his his objective was good but his motive was wrong that's what I that's what I believe you say well where do you get that from well the way that Jesus responds to him and then the way that he brings these next few in these next two instances out or this conversation unfolds you realize Jesus is challenging people at the at at the basis of what their thought is when they want to do something he he's challenging this person in terms of you want to follow me wherever I go so he raises the terms and conditions you want this well this will be the consequences you want to do this these are the terms these are the conditions to cause the person to think more deeply about what they're wanting to do to see if they'll say yes Lord I'm willing I understand that I understand the implications I understand the consequences I realize I'll be persecuted I realize I may not have a place to lay my head but I know this is the truth and I'm willing to follow it so Jesus is uncovering the motive in his heart in verse 59 now Jesus says to another follow me so now he's bidding another disciple to come and but he said Lord suffer me first to go and bury my father so it's yes I will but first I need to take care of some things and Jesus's response is in verse 60 Let the dead bury their dead but go thou and preach the kingdom of God words he's he's bringing that division between things things pertaining to life things pertaining to death and again this is something ought have got the person's attention this is my excuse and he's said let the dead bury the dead but go thou and preach the kingdom of God what a what an incredible uh uh shocking statement follow me well let me first go bury my father and there's a lot that could be meant in that statement that I I need to tend to things first with my family and I can't do it now but I need to make sure my father's household is in order it's kind of like I will but not right now and that's a real challenge to young people sometimes who who say I know I should and I know I want to and I know I need to but not right now in verse 61 and another also said now seeming to be the prompt come follow me he says Lord I will follow thee again a very direct statement I will follow the but let me first go bid them farewell which are at home at my house and Jesus said unto him no man having put his hand to the plow and looking back is fit for the kingdom of God Jesus doesn't seem to be in a good mood In this passage right I mean and I know maybe I'm take I'm being a little bit humorous about it but it's like hey Jesus I'll go wherever you go I don't have a place to sleep is that what you want follow me no I need to bury my father I let the dead bury the dead you'd think he was being you know argumentative or Surly no he's being he's being perceptive none of this was said with clinched teeth none of this was said to be sarcastic well I don't know how he said it but he's making a good point if I could just say that he doesn't need to be in a bad mood he's making a good point to cause the person to think and when he says this no man having put his hand to the plow and looking back is fit for the kingdom Christ is bringing it right back to reason and purpose again yeah good he said what do you why do you want to follow me why would you say yes what think about what the what's taking place and what order of importance and how great an opportunity this is I'm not just another teacher traveling the Hillside and if you think that's what I am wait for the next Sideshow this message is just another way of viewing the Bible if brother man was just another charismatic charismatic Pentecostal preacher if you want to think this is just another flavor and God's bask and Robins were wrong and we got to realize this is the way the truth the life this is the word of God and you better have that kind of conviction and understanding if you're going to go forward in this because you can't just come like well we'll just see if this works no man having put his hand to the plow and looking back is fit for the kingdom he raises up the image of a farmer in order to correct what this person's about to do how well I'll follow you let me just go ahead and take care of some things at home and and I'd like to come back to this again in the future and bring some more stuff out of these verses but Jesus is basically saying well no man who's going to plow going to Ho a row and then look back while he's doing it is fit for the kingdom and what that ought to do is cause the person who says I'll follow you I just need to take care of some things then I'll come back to where I am should cause that person to think about what's in the mind of a farmer when he's plowing good because a farmer has a specific purpose he has a reason for plowing it's not that he just likes turning up dirt it's not he likes the smell stand you know walking behind some oxen right I I it's none of those things it's not just without thought it's not indiscriminant or without purpose without basis he has an objective he has a motive to that objective and as he does it he has a sense of purpose and he has a reason why are you out there getting stones out of that it's the dead of winter why are you doing this and why are you doing this why are you doing that he knows that he's got to take care of the ground and he's got to get it ready and then he's got to turn the dirt up he's got to plant the seed a farmer understands more than just well I get this is just the time of year to plow the ground no he has purpose he has Vision Peter says it in First Corinthians 9:10 he that plowe should plow in hope he that threshthesky partaker of his hope in other words your labor has purpose your labor has an objective a farmer when he's farming has a reason for farming he has a reason for plowing he has a reason for doing what he's doing and that's what keeps his mind on his objective and that's what keeps him going forward and that's what becomes his motivation and he says Don't Look Back maybe you don't understand what I'm asking you to do if you think you can just go do this and come back and do this he says maybe you need to think about this a little bit more purpose is that your intention your aim or your goal and Jesus is asking these disciples about their reason what what he's talking about the cost of discipleship he's talking about the price they need to pay the standard that that the the the very thing that God is asking him to do and he's saying what's your motive think about it what's your motive what's your objective what's your purpose what's your aim or your goal in what you're trying to do now we know that Faith does not reason or rationalize against the word now I'm coming to my closing thought here but Faith does not reason with the word of God it does not rationalize against the word because the word is our reason and if we don't understand the word we don't understand something in the word that we could say we we'd be better just saying I don't understand it instead of trying to explain it away now I'm not talking about man's interpretations of it not talking about your own intellectual placing of it but faith cannot reason against the word of God it's a sense that does not reason and then and and and brother Andrew this kind of reminds me of what we were talking about the other day there's things that we do know and it's upon the basis of what we know that we then use to examine and look at things as we go forward and if you have faith in the word of God then that becomes basis for discernment because a basis for expecting certain things well why are you expecting that because my faith sees by Revelation I see it in the word of God and I have faith that God's going to do it so it creates this expectation and then God has told me in his word that anybody who has had a revelation makes preparation for it so I'm acting and I'm doing things based upon what I know I'm not just out there throwing seed around hoping something comes up because a farmer doesn't do that so then we must take that word that we have faith and then examine our thinking our rationale our reasoning and that's part of what I'm talking about is understanding reason is we've got a B we got a reason for believing we have a Reason for Hope now let's think more deeply about it because we've got to approach the word Wide Awake you've got to approach it with understanding brother talks about in the seals I hope you're wide awake right that there's there there we've got to have understanding and purpose and the sermon of greater than Solomon is here brother R says your faith is unconscious and some of us are like I thought I that's exactly what I was thinking but your faith is unconscious and he says don't press now or jump so you got to recognize he's dealing with some uh you know someone's wanting to do something your faith is unconscious don't press now or jump you jump away from it it's right with you but John I thought I had that in there he says your faith is unconscious don't press now or jump you jump away from it it's right with you just relax self and believe just believe now have faith so faith is unconscious and he's saying we don't need to just press and get ourselves all emotionally worked up to have faith he says be reverent just have faith I think I think what happened there is someone be G gave an interpretation or there was some uh speaking a Word of Wisdom or something brother man says be reverent just have faith just believe sometimes your faith is unconscious you have it and you don't know it so that's where he's talking about faith is unconscious in the places he says this as he's not saying faith is unconscious in other words it's knocked out or it's sleeping but it's it's there deeper and you're not conscious of it you have it and instead of just quieting yourself down and relaxing and believing and making contact with your faith we try to press and jump get ourselves worked up thinking that's going to tell us we believe oh if I could just scream if I could if I could just cry if I could something happen he says no no no no no you're going to it's right there you'll jump away from it he says so you don't want to get emotionally worked up but you don't want to tranquilize yourself either he's not saying your faith is unconscious so why don't you get unconscious God's word doesn't work by osmosis he says in question and answers part three he says what's the use of jumping up and down shouting speaking in tongues if you don't know what it's all about you got to understand why you're there right that's that's good what's what's the use in jumping shouting speaking in tongues if you don't know what it's for why is it happening what's it all about if you don't understand it why it's why you're doing it what the results are he's saiding what's the point in even doing it now that's a great question do would just would we just speak in tongues just to speak in tongues jump and shout and dance just so we can say that we did because brother Braham said well that's what these Pentecostals don't want this is what the church doesn't want they don't want any of these tongue talking shouting dancing uh uh you know new newborn babes and since that's what the church doesn't want that's what we'll be and we just become tongue talking crying blabbering shouting dancing babes just to try to M meet some quote and invisible union he said well what's it all about why are we here well brother bam said that's what this church doesn't want and that's what Leo de has rejected is these these tongue talking shouting dancing Pentecostal babes that's what they' rejected and say okay fine what is that mean what do you here for what's it all about do we understand why it's here what it what it what it means brother bradam in the sermon presuming these are two long statements from the sermon presuming they're both at the same January 17th of 1962 if you could follow in this we're we're coming close now uh to a close we haven't been very long tonight so we're doing really good on time he says the human soul cries out for something it knows that there's something that brought it here they know that there's something that's beyond here they know that they come from out of the night and they go back into the night and they want to know where they come from and where they're going that's what's Driven all Pursuits of knowledge now if that hunger is in there you can never get it by bliding your mind if that hunger is in there to know you'll never get it by just blanking your mind I'm not going to think anymore I'm just going to stop thinking and then whatever comes into my mind right that's going to be where I'm from and that's where I'm going he said no you can't get it by bliding your mind you know I heard someone was in a meeting here some time ago someone said just let your mind go blank now just look right straight towards the skies let your mind go blank you'll get an experience and no doubt but what you do that's right you but you get an experience but what an experience right now this is the Temptation and I I might have fumbled that that hand off there but we have the one side where we're not wanting to get emotional we're not want to get too worked up and then and then we have all this caution against reason and I've tried to through the the better part of these last two Services just kind of talk point to the fact that there's some on some level there's a way that we can think about the word of God that pleases the Lord or that that that brings us to a place of accepting God's word like we're using our mental capacity we're using our thinking that if in a maybe in a better way of just saying that in the out come of our faith now that we have faith Paul wants our faith to increase in knowledge and wisdom and understanding and Revelation so we're using all these things to recognize that okay maybe I shouldn't just try to Dole my mind maybe I shouldn't just try to become that faith is being numb all right remember how we asked that question is this Faith or am I just numb because there a place where we get where we're not impacted and affected by anything it's because we're not thinking and we're not feeling it's not Faith we're just almost dead he says you can't get it by bliding your mind he says I was in a meeting where someone said just let your mind go blank so could you imagine that if that's how we tried at the end of the service if you need healing just let your mind go blank don't think about anything just open up your heart now don't think about anything he says what kind of experience are you going to get he says you see when you do that you just open your soul to Satan he will give you something that's true now you ready for this but I think a person coming to Christ should come with all the intelligence they got and quoting in their mind when you come to him every promise in the scripture keep your mind alert when you come to Christ is that not asking us to use our power of orderly thought and focus it on the Promises of God and not just bliding our mind and going blank and hoping that we can feel something he said because Satan will give you something to feel but if you're going to come to Christ come with all the intelligence you got thank God he just said all that you got right so that if we don't have a lot we just come with what we have come with whatever intelligence you got quoting in your mind the promises of the word of God keeping your mind alert don't let it go blank amen the devil will make you do anything see they'll give you a sensation he can do that too but you want an experience something that the Bible teaches something that's real amen and you're not going to come to it by bling your mind mind and open up your spirit to any kind of sensation and emotion it's only going to happen when you have your mind stayed on the word of God all the intelligence you God all your facult powers of reason and all your faculty of thought and all your rationale is now focused and being projected towards the promise of God towards the word of God and as that begins to build its momentum something might say well but I don't know about this it says but keep your eye on the promise God has an answer keep your eye on the promise as a way of focusing us he says you want an experience the something that's real and brother Bram says usually experience a company's faith and so that's what our faith ought to be doing is he say experien accompanies faith and he talks about primarily how that when One Believes In Jesus Christ and they're forgiven of their sins and it creates that bond in that relationship that experience gives them confidence and Trust to believe more am now in the same sermon presuming he said I heard someone was in a meeting here some time ago someone said just let your mind go blank let me just it let me just I want to come back to that last part he says keep your mind alert when you come to Christ that's it keep your mind alert when you come to Christ you got to keep your mind open you got to keep your mind alert you got to keep your thoughts on the word of God and the sermon works is Faith expressed he said that's the same way with preaching Divine Healing or anything else as you go along you begin to learn if you don't learn there's something wrong now I'm sharing this just to kind of bring this back into our series on Divine Healing it's the way with preaching Divine Healing or anything else as you go along you got to learn if you're not learning something's wrong says see you've got to learn and you've got to learn how to accept God and what it really means we allow it sometimes say well this guy doesn't have enough Faith this guy didn't do this and this there's a reason there for that there's a reason sometimes it's unconfessed sin I we put it all on faith right well he didn't have enough Faith this guy didn't have enough Faith this guy couldn't do this he couldn't do that because he didn't have enough Faith well let's think a little bit more deeply about that and he says there's a reason sometimes people's faith cannot operate he says sometimes it's unconfessed sin and and this is instructive to a you know to a minister and laying hands on the sick and believing they shall recover and he's saying maybe God put that sickness on them for a reason and you going to you want to do this and you want to try to do that you want to tr try to do all sorts of stuff to get that person healed he says but God has put the sickness on them for that reason and you try to pray it off of him he says God put it there for a reason you'll get yourself in trouble with God he said there's a reason for that there's a reason sometimes it's unconfessed sin that causes a person who wants to believe for their healing to start thinking about their spiritual condition listen to these few statements real quick he says you've got to come first sanely and soundly in God's provided way of approach to him right you see we just read you got to learn how to accept God and what it really means he says there's a you got to come sanely and soundly in God's provided way of approach he's praying in this one service he says father they've come sanely moving up not emotionally just come soberly using he's referring to sanity says I believe God's fixing to do something great but now we got to approach it sanely intelligently right in the word of God no that's what he's bringing us back to not bliding our minds not blanking ourselves off not cutting away our power to think but taking that thought and taking our thinking and putting it on the word of God and the sermon expectancy he says faith is not mythical something mentally worked up it's an absolutely fundamental result that happens in a person's heart when faith is appropriated then it's something in the person's heart but it can't be based on say well go touch a tree and you'll get well or pray to the post it's got to have a foundation it's got to have a reason he says here it is I want you to get it how much more Foundation can you place your faith on any level than the word of God what more could you put Faith in because it's not mythical something mentally worked up it's an absolute fundamental result in a person's heart and if we're not careful we can make what we believe and what we're looking for mythical to everybody else they don't understand it they don't understand it they don't understand you've made it mythical because you don't understand it it's a you it's mythical and Mystic to you because you're just saying well I believe it well what is it you believe it I mean I believe it I believe the message well what is the message right there's fellowship with somebody here recently and I said and I just asked them if they knew what their Pastor believed and they didn't know how long has he been pastor ping you're all wanting Clues I'm not going to tell you how long he's been pastoring he started pastoring in 2020 no it's like do you even know what your pastor believes and it's like well no how many years you heard him preach it's like well real long time are you thinking about what you're hearing right are you processing these things do you have a basis do you understand what the message taught it's not just bliding our minds and going blank and numbing ourselves but really grasping the real heart of the word of God the problem is brother says people don't dig down deep enough and get into the spirit of Revelation last statement in the sermon I have heard but now I see it I think this might just be a a beautiful place and just feeling I've delivered this burden on this thought about our understanding our reason last statement here says brother says but first you see your motive and objectives have to be right you have to have reasons for this God don't give you those things just because you ask God I want to be healed okay okay what why he's like wait I got to have a reason like I just want to borrow the car why do you want to borrow the car son you need to know that yeah I want to know that when are you going to bring it back what I got to bring it back at a certain time huh I'll just go get my own car there's a reason and it's so beautiful and you cannot ask in faith unless there's a real objective to that to be in the will of God right amen and I know we've heard this before but just hope it kind of can catch us a little bit more deeply today if you want to be well what do you want to be well for I mean what a what a statement what do you want to be well for see if you want to be healed what's the reason you want to be healed now I do not believe that brother bradam is taking this subject of healing and I hope that what I'm doing is not taking just the subject of the word of God and now everything has to become an analytical session we're going to analyze we're going to dissect we're try to figure this out and going to figure that out listen it's just causing us to realize that faith means more to us than just on a very shallow and surface way saying I believe I believe no there's more to it than that why because Devils believe and tremble and we believe without the trembling so it goes deeper for deeper for them than it does for us he says when you he says what what do you want to be healed for what's your reason it's just causes not to become overthinkers not to become analytical but to challenge ourselves do I have a reason do I have what's my motive what's my objective am I thinking about this because as we were emphasizing last Sunday I believe that if our soul is sealed and and we're sick that what we want the most important thing we want is the right attitude because the new body is coming and then if I can focus on having the right attitude the right temperament the right mood and the right Spirit the right kind of character the right kind of honesty and just and have God develop my character and put me in the right attitude then the right attitude will bring God's word to pass but you'll be amazed at what the right attitude will do in your attitude toward your sickness like you know what it's just cosmetic right or you know what I I can do this God will give me Grace and just even in Your Attitude Change towards it can relax you enough to find out wait a minute it's gone amen he says what's your reason what are you telling God what do you want to do with your life when you get healed you've got to have a motive and objective and they have to be right according to the will of God and then when the faith is revealed to you and by God his Sovereign Grace and God by his Sovereign Grace places that faith in there then it's over is that beautiful then it's over amen but you have to have a reason for this God bless you tonight I trust the Lord spoke to your heart am a lot to think about say well brother Aon you just raised a lot of questions well we're talking about understanding reason right we want to think about these things not as not to give us Faith but to understand our faith you've got faith use it we've got the word of God let's think about it let's consider it we we could begin to think about the word of God in so many different areas and say now if I took this process then if we believe that certain things have been revealed and we think certain scriptures have been fulfilled maybe we ought to ponder those things am maybe we want to consider these things and take them into our heart as Mary did and says and I'm going to keep these things and I'm going to think about them and think about what they're to produce and what does it look like and what if brother bam did accomplish this if the word of God has been fulfilled if this is what God's wanting to do we begin to think about it in such a way to where our lives that happens just exactly what Paul was wanting that we would have that Spirit of wisdom and of Revelation and the knowledge of him we can know what the hope of this calling is and what the riches are of The Inheritance that he's given to the Saints God bless you tonight let's Stand Together
