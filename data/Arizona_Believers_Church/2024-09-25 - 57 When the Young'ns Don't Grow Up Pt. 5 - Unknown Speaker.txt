TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I wanted to read those extra portions there um from verses 17 to 24 uh because he's talking about learning you have not so learned Christ you're different than uh the Gentiles and how they walk and if you have heard him and you are being taught by him then you ought to be putting off the things related to your former life which uh were fashioned and nurtured according to a natural nature and that comes by that corrupt birth of a a human being being born of a woman and be renewed in the spirit of your mind which reading on Sunday how we are to be our minds are to be transformed and by the renewing of our minds are being transformed from natural things and Earthly things to the mind of Christ and in doing that we're putting on a new man we're we're setting him forth and he's coming to preeminence and it's created by God in righteousness and true Holiness and so if you could just keep those things in mind as we continue tonight on the thought of when the youngans don't grow up and we know that God's will for us is perfection and that the purpose of the Holy Spirit and the word is to place the believer and so tonight I'm wanting to explore and I know that we've done this uh several times already uh but I want to explore the subject of adoption not just repeating principles that we've used before but more uh from the word of God from the message of the hour on the subject of adoption because I believe it's a very very critical uh uh part of the process of God especially in the time that we're living now brother Braham called this adoption time and it's that time he said in parable of the church this time where God is placing his church so if you look at Ephesians chap 4: 15 and 16 and uh trying to be uh just more relaxed tonight I asked someone in my family last Wednesday I said did it seem like the people were just kind of uptight at the start of the preaching and they they said no you were and so uh I apologize for killing the vibe last Wednesday night try not to do it tonight but you just pray for me in Ephesians chapter 4 verses 15 and 16 says but speaking the truth in love these are the gifts that God has given to men uh that are used in in the fivefold Ministries we might say they're to speak the truth in love that in speaking that we may grow up into Christ in all things which is the head it says even Christ so we're to grow grow up through the edification of the word of God from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth according to the effectual working and the measure of every part we see the human body in View and how that there's nutrients and there's nourishment to increase that cause the nature of the person to grow into those bounds of its DNA and all its potential and its physical development it's intellectual capacity it says making increase of the body unto the edifying of itself the building of itself it's its establishment in love so there's two critical things he says to speak the truth in love and that we're to edify ourselves in love I believe that we could take Ephesians 4 and narrow it down narrow one of the principles that's being uh established in this is that the purpose of the indwelling of the Holy Ghost by your birth at the time that you're sealed by the Holy Ghost is to cause you to grow that it's not the sense that well you've got the Holy Ghost you're born again you're done and you're finished and that the kind of the what you do then is just try to use your resources to support evangelism so that somebody else can be saved but there's a shaping there's a honing there's a perfecting that takes place in a believer's life once they've been born again and you'll find that it's so that we no longer remain children but that we grow up to maturity that you henceforth be no more children it says and that we wouldn't be tossed about and we wouldn't be instable that's the purpose of the Holy ghost and that's I say that to minister Grace to those whove receiv received the Holy Ghost and still find ah things have been a little Topsy Turvy things haven't always gone the way that I wanted them to well that's because you're still in a physical body and still have a very human spirit that Wars against the newness of life that's down inside your soul and you've got to learn to yield you've got to learn to feed that Holy Ghost experience you've got to learn to make difficult decisions to follow the principles of the word of God so that you can grow thereby you can you can make increase and so the purpose of the Holy Ghost is not to make you a babe in Christ only but to grow you from a babe to manhood and in Christ is the mystery of God excuse me Christ is revealed in his own word brother brandom we read this on Sunday and he's talking about how things have grown from the feet and on up through the body and that he come to the Pentecostal age which is the tongues then you have a prophet that comes and he introduces The Headstone and so the next is the int Ence there's nothing left but for he himself to step into that church and to manifest himself and he said he's governed the body all the way through through the church ages then in the then the complete body of Christ is revealed in the form of a bride that was taken out of his side like Adams was at the beginning so I want to take that image where we are to come out to the complete full maturity full manifestation brother Bram said the full word is to be born into manifestation again at the open of the word which is that third pull the full word is to be born into manifestation it's going to manifest he says in full measure the bride so the bride is this full measure she is to be this fullness the maturing the Capstone uh Union that takes place in this time and he says it's revealed in the bride and he gives us this example as the woman was taken out of Adam that's the image we're to see in this day and we mentioned this on Sunday and I'm using this kind of as our connection point to go further tonight Adam was made he was created a full grown adult he wasn't started out as a molecule or a tadpole and evoluted on up through thousands of years but he was made a man he was first spirit in every way that a man would have a Spirit uh then he is formed in a body and this body is a mature body and then when he takes the woman out of the man he doesn't take forth an embryo he doesn't take an infant or a toddler but he brings forth a full grown adult and they are placed in the garden they are commissioned with the Commandment and they are empowered they're they're not put there to try to figure it out they're not put there to learn and to grow they have been equipped they've been given everything they need all the resources are at their disposal they have power to speak and everything would obey and brother Bram uses a language to say Adam was the most perfect man there has ever been outside of Christ and he would have been the most perfect man there ever was before Christ and so this was a perfect man this was a mature man and so going back to Eden this Eden condition which we know is that third part of the three-fold purpose of Christ it points to it I like to say an adoption experience or an adoption condition or process that when it says the woman's going to come forth as the bride out of Christ in the same way that the woman came out of Adam it's not a baby it's not someone that's learning but someone that comes to that image and that expression of Bride and bridegroom United together with the responsibility the power the responsibility and the capacity the mind of Christ to know what he wants done with the word to fulfill God's word in its season and brother ROM says as Adam and the woman did not fulfill the plan of God Christ through his bride will fulfill all the plan of God even that 1,000 years and that honeymoon so we are to become come into that image of grown fullness manifestation maturity uh along with our bridegroom to fulfill the plan of God in Genesis 1 we'll read verses 26 to3 I read this fully aware that we read from Genesis chapters 1 2 and 3 quite a bit and it being the seed chapter it's always a seed book it's nice to go back and see these things in the beginning says God said let us make man in our image this is not an appearance but this is a quality it says after our likeness something internal this is some value system so let's make man in our image and let them have dominion there's your empowering we want to make man a Godlike we want to make him in the image of God and then give him full power full Authority full Reign full government over the fish of the sea over the foul of the air and over the cattle and over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth that's what God wants to do and just as God does in verse 27 so God created man in his own image and in the image of God created he him male and female created he them so there's this bringing together in that same Covenant that same image the man and the woman and God blessed them and God said send to them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the Earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the foul of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the Earth so now as he thought it and desired to do it and purpose to make man and give them Dominion he's now doing this this is the placing of man in his position as it'll say in Genesis chapter 2 that when he formed him out of the Dust of the earth he placed the man in the garden to till it so he's there not to learn to till it but to till it he's there not to learn the ways of the garden but to establish those ways because he has been equipped he's been empowered and he can do it he's not necessarily in a learning experience he's he he's he's manifesting he's he's stepped into his office and he says and God said behold I've given you every herb bearing seed which is upon the face of all the Earth and every tree in which is the fruit of the tree yielding seed to you it shall be for meat to every beast of the earth and to every fowl of the air and to everything that creepeth upon the Earth wherein there is life I have given every green herb for meat and it was so Adam upon Earth is God on Earth he is not in an invisible realm he's in this visible realm he has full Authority on Earth and he rules as God and he governs on Earth as God he has jurisdictional control he can control everything he is superior to everything that's on Earth God's not saying Adam if you'll do this you can become he's saying say this is you not if you'll do this then I'll stand behind your word if you'll do that I'll I'll make it so he's saying I've given you everything it's all yours he's handing it to him no strings attached uh in terms of how he can operate that only one condition not one prohibition and if he violated that prohibition he would lose it all and so brother R said God placed over this over this Eden over this creation to rule all his great creation here on Earth his son and his son's bride Adam and Eve they were placed there over all of it and one thing that I think is demonstrated in this scripture and I think to me is apparent in the way that it reads and I think it's something that God wants us to catch that God in the beginning created the Heaven and the earth goes to this process of creation and he makes man and he says let them you have dominion I've given you every herb I've given you every creature I've given you every tree and every fruit and he gives it to him and so God who is the creator of it and the original owner has has given it to Adam and that Adam has inherited God's work and God created it and then he gives it to man for man to operate as his very own right it's something that man then took power and possession over so Adam we could say mankind had a responsibility of furthering God's will be fruitful multiply and replenish the Earth God had a vision God had a plan and and God wasn't necessarily going to be the one active in there rolling up his sleeves doing the rest he wanted man and the woman to further God's will they would be like God on Earth bringing forth life establishing the word of God and the Very word son as we make reference to this quite a bit I believe the very word son as a son he is an heir of the father's creation he's the heir of the world he's the heir of Heaven and Earth he was the heir of the father's work and he's made to further God's Vision he is therefore the Builder of God's character he's the Builder the word son in Hebrews the builder of the family name doesn't mean he gets a puzzle with the family name in there he's got building blocks that's got an m and a c and a g and a E and A A and R and A why it's not the it's not that building but he he as he lives expresses what's behind the name and what the power the character the ownership the rights and all the inheritances so that's Adam on Earth as a fully placed son on earth now it being an image and a foreshadowing and God wanting to express something in it there are things that transpire in the garden that were necessary to fulfill God's plan and Satan is used as a tool in that process to further God's perfect will uh and God's plan so Genesis chapter three reveals that Adam loses his position of power his position of authority through the fall I want to point to this knowing that in saying it and I don't know that I guess I could say it's a paradox I don't think it contradicts it's just a paradox but he demonstrates that a son could lose his inheritance based upon Disobedience God gives it to him there is some qualification there is a condition and it's a conditional Covenant it's a it's all yours but don't do this because the day that you do it there's going to be a death and in doing so God had set it forth such that once Satan intervened and got in there Satan wouldn't be able to inherit anything Adam had but if any if Adam was dispossessed it would just go back to God Adam would no longer have possession of it so God had some restrictive covenants in there he had some things that Adam could do but if he didn't do this then it reverted back to the original owner which was God it didn't limit Adam's ability with what he had didn't make him any less of a son didn't make him any less of a of an author Authority but when Adam disobeys and he plays the part of a redeemer himself he loses that inheritance that God had given him and in Genesis 3:15 God promises a redeemer which is Christ and then even from that moment on as you begin to read in the Old Testament you should be looking for Redemption and the law the house of the Lord and all these different things that we could see Genesis 3:15 all foreshadowed Redemption a restoration of what was promised and given to Adam not that Adam himself has to be brought back up and go right to that same location and pick up where he left off but everything it represented everything that man lost everything that mankind was supposed to be Christ comes and demonstrates that everything Adam lost to the fall could be restored to mankind he controlled nature he multiplied creation there's all these things that Christ was doing as the second Adam to show this is a restoration of what had been lost so Redemption is one of those themes that you always look should be looking for in the word of God knowing that God wants to redeem he wants to restore he wants to bring back so he puts forth this picture in Genesis chapter 1 2 and he says this is all the seeds of everything I want to accomplish when man falls in Genesis 3 and the curse is brought in Genesis 4 there's this theme of or is begins to unfold in Genesis 4 and you see the Fallout you there's this theme of God wanting to restore or Redemption which is coming back and finishing God's plan in Leviticus 25: 23 and 24 speaking about the laws of redemption a and the land that has been given to Abraham and his seed they had a very specific inheritance in the promised land they had boundaries they had property they had all sorts of inheritances and there was ways that they could lose it by selling by going into bondage different things that could happen there's even ways where one could marry outside of Israel and that land be inherited by those who weren't Israelites and it was all in the word of God ways that it wouldn't be unfair necessarily to those that possessed it but eventually it was going to go back to the original owner and it speaks about how important an inheritance is to God and we look in the word of God and we find that an inheritance is so precious that if one despises it it's like the worst thing you could do to God Esau is called a profane person because of his attitude towards the inheritance so when God gave adam this great inheritance and he lost it God wants to Signal through the Old Testament to the believer just how important an inheritance is and just how much you should be willing to receive it all and not profane it and not lose it so the Bible says the land shall not be sold forever if someone owned a plot and had been in the family for all these generations and it was by law according to the will of God theirs and they sold it because they got themselves in trouble the word says it cannot be sold forever for the land is mine this is mine I've given it to you as an inheritance if somebody Mars your inheritance I have a process to strike off any Cloud on your title and I want to perfect this title I want to restore it I want to make it clean I want to kick off anybody else who might try to have some sort of claim or adverse possession to this title says for you are strangers and Souljers with me beautiful this land is mine it's not going to be sold forever and in all the land of your possession you shall Grant a Redemption for for the land he's demonstrating as Israel had right title and interest to the land in Israel imp perpetuity and they had absolute title and it was theirs and if something happened where they lost it God wanted the law to say there is going to be a law for the grant of redemption for anything that a individual is dispossessed of because it's mine I own it these are my rules and I want you to have it as an inherit as an heir and so put in the law put in this know that there's going to be Redemption for anything sold that's that should be the image we have even as Adam loses all right title interest and that book from that that title Deed from his hands it goes back to God not in the hands of Satan not in in Adam's keepsake box but he loses it and as soon as he loses it you know that book which was the title deed you know what it becomes the book of redemption because that needs to be redeemed it needs to come back into the hands of man it needs to come that place of full possession again and have full Authority and brother bam uses the language to say when Adam and the woman or Adam and Eve listened to the LIE of the devil the holy image of God left them their Fellowship was broken with God this has been a phrase that I I just personally I'll say I personally have keed in on and think it's very important for me to understand what happened when Adam lost his position and fail is the holy image that Adam was bearing he loses that Holy image image now he's still made in the image of God and after the likeness of God that still there are still these Shadows of Holiness and righteousness in Adam because he came direct from God the woman came direct from God and so as they would have children there would be some nature that they inherited there' be some righteousness it's in the genes it's in the seed and it's only through the mixing and the hybra that Humanity becomes degraded and inherently evil and that's why it's such a great trans transgression what they did and so Adam loses the holy image of God and his fellowship with God is broken and Brotherman says great channels became clogged he couldn't get back to where he was in his mind and in his spirit and you could say that once once innocence is lost it can't be regained and so this image again is not a look but it was his position that was lost this godlikeness this Godly image something is lost in that his Fellowship is impacted and if you look at the very details of it in Genesis chapter 3 Adam who was given everything to control in Genesis 3 saying you're gonna have to fight with it now so the holy image that he loses is the inheritance the power the title deed The Authority you're going to have to fight with nature you're going to have to fight with the ground it's not going to obey you like it once did so Adam made in the image of God loses that image Christ comes in the image of the father showing that that can be restored to Mankind and then it says in Romans 8: 29 for whom he did Forno he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren the image of his son the statue of a perfect man this pattern scripture says that there's a pattern there's works that we are to do the works that I do shall you do also Greater Works that we're to walk in his steps we're to follow in his example so this is Christ that we are to come in the image of and again it's that image of bearing the supernatural bearing the Heavenly the builder of the family name was Christ and now we too are to be conformed conformed means to be fashioned like Christ it's not the same word that's even used in uh be not conformed to this world because that speaks of something temporary something that's just an outline it's just a figure but here we're to be complete and durable not merely a form not merely an outline not something that is just external only where well it looks like it but it's it's just uh smoke mirrors it's just a form and when he says this in verse 29 of chapter 8 that we're to be conformed to the image of his son he's drawing from really everything he's been saying from verse one especially if you just look at that chapter and I would like to say that coming to this image of this perfect man is the final product of this adoption process if you look earlier in the chapter as we know the work of the Holy Ghost is to mature the believer he says in verse 18 this is uh leading up to verse 29 he says for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us this glory is the Perfection of character it's this it's this uprightness it's this manifestation of correct behavior and attit it's to be as one ought to be it's righteousness and he says I reckon that the things that we suffer now in life can never compare to the character that's being formed in us through suffering understand again according to the message of suffering is the process of character development so he's on this subject I reckon as sons of God uh the spirit beared witness with our spirit that we are the sons of God and we reckon that the sufferings of this present time uh um are worth the sufferings because it's producing a glory verse 19 this Glory which is going to be revealed now speaks to this desire of all creation for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God in the beginning God created the Heaven and Earth brought forth fruit yielding trees and Herb building bearing plants and animal life and he put man on Earth as a manifested Son of God to rule and Reign upon Earth it's yours I've given it to you man loses that so the very ones that were made for the man and they were to be ruled by the man they lost their ruler they lost the ones that they were made to serve the the the grass was to serve the mankind the animal life was to be subservient to mankind all the fruits of the field were were were to come forth and serve their purpose uh for mankind but now that it's lost it's the earnest expectation of Heaven and Earth the creature that God the creation that God created that in it somehow within Mother Nature creation itself it's longing and waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God for the creature was made subject to ity not willingly the creation didn't sin and it was made subject to vanity because of the fall of Man the decision of man and the woman but by reason of him who has subjected the same in hope so now they're still subject to this vanity but there's this hope of what Redemption because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption remember how the old man is made after this corruption and he he lust and it's at the former conversation of your natural birth and it it comes in sin shapen the wrong way but when you're born again by Incorruptible seed you can now put on the new man and it's this new man these new creatures in Christ that speak to the original intent of the original creation and it has been promised that creation itself shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption the corruption of Fallen flesh the corruption of Satan's plan the corruption of the hybrid nature into what a beautiful phrase the Glorious Liberty of the children of God that one day when it is ruled and Reign Again by these new creation the super race the super people Christ and his bride that that will be Liberty to no longer be in bondage to corruption but loosed into the liberty of children of God and all of creation is groaning for this for we know that the whole creation granth and travaileth in pain together until now for what the manifestation of the sons of God the Glorious Liberty of the children of God and not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit even We Grown are we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption we that have the spirit we that have been born a new by the baptism of the Holy Ghost are waiting for the adoption Paul did not teach that when he got the Holy Ghost he was a fully adopted Place son now if you want to use the analogy of one who's being a sinner and now made part of the family of God the analogy is fine but recognize that's limited use and even brother brandham uses the phrase of adopted children by Christ to refer to coming out of being just a gentile reprobate Heathen into the family of God but what he's writing now are those who actually possess the indwelling of the spirit are waiting for the adoption he says to it the Redemption of our body the body which came from what the earth the earth which man at one time was made ruler over and did not have to die so adoption is connected with Redemption it's a connected with this image of man and the woman ruling and re on Earth with full power and potential of God likeness and he says for we are saved by hope but hope that is seen is not hope so if Paul was hoping for adoption he wouldn't call it a hope if he saw it for what a man seeth why do he yet hope for it but if we hope for that we see not then do we with patience wait for it now suffering is the process of character development patience is the process of perfection we with patience wait for it let patience have her perfect work that you may be perfect and entire wanting nothing fully matur fully grown up so I reckon that the sufferings I reckon that the process of character development is worth it because it produces character in The Believer and we are waiting and groaning looking forward to full Redemption this adoption and the placing of the body of Christ and all and this is part of this image of the of the manifestation of the sons of God and so what's coming we have a hope being born again to this new hope we wait for this adoption we're looking forward to this Redemption of the body and this patience is the process of maturity and adoption is connected with the manifestation of sons it's pointing to the manifestation of sons and the suffering and the patience is pointing to when the seed presents itself the manifestation of sons the presenting of the fruit the presenting of the fullness the when the when the Harvest has come when the seed has presented itself when the fruit has presented itself maturity completion Perfection that's the manifestation of sons not the birth of sons not the sons coming forth not the manifestation of your election but rather the full potential of what God has looked for from the beginning in the sermon hear ye himym which the dozen or so times that brother Bon preached this it's on the subject of adoption says for when God brought us into his Kingdom by the baptism of the Holy Spirit and become a child of God that's what the baptism of the Holy Ghost is it is the new birth it is the sealing of the soul in the body of Christ it is the guarantee of the Resurrection it is the guarantee of your salvation it cannot be taken away from you says when you have when he's done this God sent us the best tutor that there was in all of Heaven the Holy Spirit and he says he is to nurture and to bring up and to raise and to teach the church brother we need Holy Spirit teaching and tutoring and all of us should say Amen to that there should not be any part of us that says well I'm comfortable with the fact that I've been saved I'm comfortable with the Revelation that I have the message of the hour I know that I'm sealed I know that I'm Justified I know that I'm going in the Rapture and uh and that settles it and have an attitude towards your inheritance of H but he says we need Holy Spirit teaching and tutoring we need to be nurtured to brought up to be raised and to be taught by the Holy G GES we need to Avail ourselves to those resources to those things that God wants to use in our lives for Redemption now in this Ephesians chapter 4 as we've been looking at this there is the speaking the truth and love that we may grow up into him in all things which is the head to the edifying of the body of itself in love this is a language that's connected with adoption to placing the teaching the the bringing out of all the potential of a child of God Ephesians 1: 3 4 5 and 6 it says blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ brother Brenham goes to Great Links to point out that he's writing this to the believer who has the Holy Ghost he's writing this to those who are already seated in Heavenly places in Christ in those who have already been guaranteed a place in the body of Christ or being taught and positionally placed by the holy spirit in that body not just merely entering into the promised land and Crossing Jordan like ah we've here we have arrived but growing and increasing and step by step taking full possession as you spread out and grow and increase so it says in verse four according as he hath chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him I'm going to stop there and and and put a period there because the b in in other some other translations and I'm just forgetting now if it's a Blu Letter Bible in some places they actually begin the next sentence with verse 5 in love having predestinated us under the adoption of children so as we are to the truth is to be spoken in love to cause us to grow up into Christ and as we grow up the body is making increase and edifying of itself in love this points back and I don't believe just because it's using in the same phrase and so I don't think you should just Google in love and everything that says in love you just kind of connect it together and AI rewrites a beetle song or something but there's some there's this thought of this in love this is the ultimate purpose this is what God's wanting to do this is the heart purpose of God and it says having predestinated us in love predestinated us destined us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself amen this adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself is not the taking of a seed that is not his own in Bur and giving them rights and authority and privileges in a family of God though you're a stranger but rather The Taking of a seed which has been born again and bringing to them a place of establishment and fixing them the predestination unto brother M said speaking of this that speaks to Destiny not your birth but Destiny the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will this is God's will to the praise of the glory of his Grace wherein he ha made us accepted in the Beloved we are accepted in him we are already seated in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus we are Heirs of God joint HS with Christ we are Sons and Daughters of God and as Sons and Daughters of God he has a perfect will for us he has a good pleasure for his children and so this adoption even in the word that's used it is the establishment and the fixing of children the the development of them the making them not in the bringing them forth but the making of them Jesus Christ was made perfect he was made he became the captain and so this is the placing of sons this is the placing of sons and daughters this is the placing of children and if that phrasing starts to get into maybe some controversial areas it's the growing up of children it is the maturing of children man makes this statement in adoption part two some people mentioned to me that they've been going through this on their own I think it's just beautiful symmetry when we in what God dealing with the CH the the body in God just leads the ministry to encourage you in that I know at one time I might have had the attitude and the idea that well wherever the pastor is preaching you need to get in there and I just believe that a pastor should yield himself enough to be where you need ministering to where you are and not everyone trying to catch up with the pastor so I trust that as we I yield myself I can minister to things that are relevant for you and you pray if you ever feel that I'm uh just beating a dead horse or repeating myself too much like brother Aaron this is just not where we're at this is not where we're at then you pray that God would direct me into those things that you need and don't beat yourself up saying well I guess I just need to feed in the field that Aaron's you know leading in said no no a a as a Shepherd I got to I got to meet your needs so you pray more for me don't beat yourselves up you know you know say what is Aaron right and get me where I need to be so brother says when the father in the Old Testament understood that his son was come of age and he says and had been seasoned out unto adoption now I'm just bringing these things to light entering them into the record as we go forward Lord willing for a few more services on the subject of adoption when he came of age when he grew up to a certain age he had been seasoned out unto adoption this isn't a a past adoption by birth he says they're born a child but they're a son and they're a son right then but they'll never be no more than just a child just an ordinary son until they mature and show what they are it's a presenting of yourself this is who I am this is what I've learned there's things that can be said about the natural development of a child even as we said that neuroplasticity that there's comes a point to where you can't teach a dog old dog new tricks is what they say you can't put new wine in Old bags and whether we're an old dog or an old bag there's something to be said about those who haven't grown and learned that they get so stayed in their ways they can't change and it doesn't mean they're not a son or daughter of God but they do lose something Saul was is was it's spoken in the word of God and we see in the message of the hour that Saul is given a place in Paradise but he loses an inheritance he he he takes the he loses the throne himself and he loses it to Jonathan and his whole family and so there's something man can be a son and daughter of God but they can lose something not trying to be very specific in terms of what you lose I'm like oh you well I don't get to walk on streets of gold and I won't be able to do this I won't I don't think it's necessarily important to try to figure out just exactly what tier you're at in God's Rewards program how do I log in how do I see where I'm at but am I a million Miler yet it's not necessary to try to how can I lock this in I need to use up my points before I lose them it's not that it's just the it's the understanding that there is a fullness there's 100% And there's a measure in you and you want to meet that measure you want to meet that measure and he says until they mature and show what they are this is is who I am the manifestation of sons he says then they're just a child they're just an ordinary son they don't inherit that's what his consistent teaching in this is is that they got to come at age and notice he says seasoned out into adoption and he uses a language they must mature and show what they are says in another place now this child was obedient and there came a certain day when this child became matured so its maturity is what's an issue it's not birth it's not works I I it's not external things it's not pretense it's not the Optics but it's maturity it's character it's thought process it's discipline it's obedience it's the evidence of the Holy Ghost when the child had become matur he'd listen to the tutor he's coming into the father's image chip off the old block you can't do that without the Holy Ghost you can't do that without the nature of the father so there is a disobedient son which is dispossessed which doesn't get his inheritance that brother bam says he needs adoption but he's not mature enough to be adopted but the son on the other hand when he changes the picture he is a son he has the Holy Ghost he believes every word he has every evidence of the Holy Ghost in his life and brother man says he matures out to a particular place that was the father's will it's what he intended all along and it's then that that child when he's seasoned out that they mature and they show what they are that he stands to receive what the father intended for him all along the fullness the fullness of The Inheritance I'm leaving some scriptures out in this and just a few principles and uh we maybe we'll pick up on it on Sunday but I want to read a very lengthy statement from the sermon you must be born again in it is New Year's Eve in 1961 excuse it's New Year's Day it's that morning New Year's Eve that morning in 1961 and he says shortcuts and he's referring to shortcuts it's a lengthy reading but we're going to um I think I'm ending on this let me just check before I missp speake that's a very it's a very lengthy statement there's a lot still to share yet in this but just listen and hold tight to this whole uh this large section of this sermon and you'll recognize some statements that that we've already made recently but I want I want this to be in your hearts I I want you to catch a hold of this because can be important as the Lord deals with your heart individually we come together collectively as a body then on Sunday when the whole house of God is full and maybe there's a lot of people here who haven't heard this it's in your heart it's in your understanding there's this respon the word of God that can say amen and we can create the right kind of atmosphere so the Holy Spirit can deal with Souls create the right kind of Atmosphere for births for correction and for these things he says shortcuts tonight they're out here today and they're going on and tomorrow they want to preach so he come up you know something happens tonight wo big brew HaHa and then tomorrow they're just you know they're ready to preach ready to Pastor he says Pentecostal people letting them do that too they want a shortcut to Heaven Hallelujah all I have to do is get down here and just don't think nothing of it at all and say hallelujah hallelujah I got Elijah's garment I'm going out tomorrow cast out Devils hallelujah hallelujah I got it praise God here I go he goes they want the shortcut to Heaven taking as much of the world as they can you can't take any of it there's no shortcuts you come the way of Calvary you come the way of the brass altar you come the way of the Brazen serpent you die you actually die oh God why can't I say it right you die literally die to yourselves die to the things of the world and are born a new amen no world the things of the world are dead so it's a it's a you die to yourself it's a a figurative death it's a dying to the things of the Lord you're born a new there's your new birth there's no shortcuts youve got to be born again and then he says again there's no shortcuts he's just continued on the same line they want to come right quick they don't want to grow and I believe that there is a a chronology to this where brother says so many people want a shortcut and they want to claim that they're Sons and Daughters of God because they had some kind of Hallelujah Hallelujah fit and he says NOP you got to come the same way you got to come through Calvary you got to be born again and then he repeats there's no shortcuts they want to come right quick they don't want to grow so I believe that this is even instruction this is instruction to those who have been born again that's not a microwave process he says they want to come right quick they don't want to grow we grow in the Lord it takes growth and experience you remember I referenced years ago brother Lonnie's revenge and it was this uh it was based upon my retelling of a testimony at a men's meeting where such beautiful instruction was going forth and I was taking just a a devotion I was like man just think if we could really put into practice what we've learned here just how much better the men's meeting can be in six months when we get there and brother Lonnie's Revenge was not brother Michael Jenkins but rather it was him getting up there and say yeah whatever that young buck was saying last night this is a marathon not a Sprint and in 6 months you're probably not going to be much further than where you are now and I'm kind of going okay well all right and uh and I got corrected right and I didn't huff and puff and quit and I went to every single men's meeting after that until there was just a little bit of a break and then I just came to the position where I felt like I didn't need him anymore no I'm just kidding they're always on our anniversary like this week I should be in Jackson Wyoming looking for church parcels and but just not just didn't work this year because of our schedules but still that's why I don't go to men's meetings really but that being said brother Lonnie's Revenge was which would make a great cover band for message music that's what the mistake was thinking we're going to be so much further down the road oh this is going to have it's a marathon it's long term takes growth and experience people are told out on the west coast now oh we got the immortal baptism we baptize you in water you turn right back to a young man right there a young woman yes sir you keep getting they got Elijah's garments they got manifested Sons what is that they got adopted Sons they got fully placed adopted Sons is what that means yes sir brother God's getting manifested Sons right now manifested tell them all about this tonight you're a sinner tomorrow you're a manifested sons of God tonight you could be a sinner tomorrow you could be a born- again Son of God but a fully adopted placed Son of God according to scripture 20 the teaching of the messenger of the hour he says nonsense where do you get that in the word babies are not born men they're born babies and grow to men Boys to Men might have made a good title for this brother brah then quotes from Ephesians chap 4: 11- 15 he's quoting through this he's saying grow up into what into him so he's taking Ephesians 4 it's at the heart the center of what he's teaching there are no shortcuts God has a pro a a process of being born again nurtured taught growing up maturing seasoned out and then he tells this story I remember the first sermon I preached I got there and I thought I did real well and all the old ladies sat around and they cried a little bit you know and said oh what a wonderful boy the old Pastor Dr Davis was an old lawyer I went down and he said I want to see you down at the house I said all right I walked in the next day you know all swelled out I said how'd I do Dr Davis he said the rottenest I ever heard I said what he said the worst I ever heard oh I said Brother Davis everybody was crying he said yes they cry at funerals they cry at births everything else he said what is it Billy you never quoted one bit of God's word you talked about some mother that done gone on or something like this and got everybody to crying what is it pulling on the emotions saying things that only identify with the Flesh and spirit of man but not a word that can identify with the germ seed in the soul of a person he says you got everybody crying he said you're not born again upon those things and sensations of this Earth you're born by the word oh he cut the wind out of me I'm glad he did Brother Bram said not jumping up and down hollering that isn't it it's the word that makes alive the words Quicken not experiences the word so now think that this is you must be born again this is dealing with no shortcuts he's dealing with the process of God to grow up into him when youngans babes toddlers adolescen teenagers in Christ grow up to their full po potential and they show what they really are they leave nothing they they they leave no promise unfulfilled that God the potential in their life so think evidence think proof think uh fruit because brother B's going to come to that and he continue on the story with Dr Davis he brother bram's words it's not jumping and down it's not hollering it's the word that makes alive he said I remember the first case I tried Billy I beat on the rail I said look at this poor woman look how she looked and her husbands mistreated her I cried a little and picked up my handkerchief and acted just like the rest of the lawyers I thought I'd go through the same emotion judge your honor why don't you give her back give her a divorce look at her she says her husband beat her back across the back he couldn't even see it underneath her clothes they beat her across the back why don't you give her the old judge just sat there and looked so just think of the theatrics first this young attorney he's up there and he's just uh boy and he's all emotional he says directly the old attorney s in Crossing this side had growed up so here's the Young attorney here's the grownup he said judge your honor how much more of this nonsense will your court stand just a lot of carrying on this is Brother bram's assessment now just a lot of carrying on that's the way too many people do too much carrying on without enough word behind it to back it up grow up oh he danced in the spirit last night brother br he's all right no that don't make him all right to me no sir he's got to grow up be proved tested growing up to him seasoned seasoned out into adoption is how the phrasing he uses he says that don't make him all right to me now that doesn't make dancing in spirit all wrong it just doesn't make the person all right and we know as the song goes Jesus is just all right with me but dancing may be all right but it doesn't make the person all right got we don't have one problem with dancing we don't have one problem being slain in the spirit we don't have a problem with these things that are in order and things are done and the holy spirit moves that's what the Holy Spirit can do it stimulates the believer it causes these things to happen but it doesn't make the believer all right he's got to grow up brother brandham said there got to be enough word behind it to back it up what are all of our meetings and all of our theatrics and all our body exercise in the producing of some fantastic if there's not enough rightly dividing of the word of God to back it up and caus the young to grow up got to grow up be proved tested growing up to him there's your Ephesians 4 seasoned then brother bam takes a very interesting path over the next several paragraphs and begins to talk about the history of the church and how Devils would present themselves to these uh these Messengers and the Devils attempts to deceive through this Supernatural he says oh that would have been a real hook to a Pentecostal in one telling says that would have been Pentecostal bait for sure why if you've got that kind of immature mindset you're gravitate to these external flashy things and you tell yourself yeah this is it right here he said that would have been a a a real test to an immature believer he said but these men of God they knew right where they stood they knew where the word was he says this about Satan how he comes in and just makes it so beautiful oh they spoke in tongues of the best people you ever seen don't you believe that are you listening be lyc he's actually I mean it's very interesting brother Brown would be teaching this to his church or to the church to say no be be a little cautious with that if somebody's emphasizing these fleshly things emphasizing the tongues and emphasizing certain emotions he says he's not saying speak against it be negative he says but kind of be leery just be cautious a little bit do you understand what he's saying there that we can't take that kind of emphasis and that kind of presentation and just buy it say be a little leer because then you want to watch where it leads Watch what it does in a person's life somebody says oh I danced I shouted we had a wonderful time it was a beautiful campas this that and the other you watch the person's life that's right and and and that's going to be the real proof of what they experienced and he says this is immediately he says don't you believe that be lary I hope the word's not boring you it's my new favorite quote he said I hope the word's not boring you you know how some Churches say be still and know that I am the Lord we should just have that as like the tagline above me and this is probably my my uh my friends are really going to love me saying that at least he's self-aware I hope the word's not boring you to me it was just it's beautiful poetry for him to just come right out and say yeah I know what you might want want is to be entertained I know what you might want is for me to just kind of pump you up a little bit and to produce the kind of atmosphere where we can let loose a little bit and feel really good about ourselves and nothing wrong with that but he acknowledges that maybe there's just a little bit of a bent in the people to where just good solid gospel teaching might bore them and when they want their ears itched they're not getting it he's like I hope the words not boring you and he says born born Christians grow into the stature of Christ as they live they're born again and their lives begin to shape like a baby takes form and begins to grow first you know here they are in the full stature amen there you are day after day year after year they stay the same now come back to the word if you abide in me yeah people year after year day after day if we're to try to just get our heads around what he's trying to say there's some people that always stay the same are they in the pattern are they growing but when we're born again our lives begin to take shape it forms and begins to grow to come to full stature they say I got born again Hallelujah I joined the I joined this I joined I don't know last year I believed in Jesus name now I backed it out backed out now I believe that I this and I believe that you had to be holy but just so and so said well just a tantrum right it's kind of those waves it's the tossing to and fro you watch certain things that aren't brightly divid in the word of truth there's always these extremes Bend all the way on this side this is what we believe now and then we go all the way this is what we believe now and it's just always this tossing to and fro brother says wanders tossed about with every wind of Doctrine children my words the wanderings tossed about he's quoting from Ephesians 4 they're children but we're to grow up to not be children anymore not I join this I join that I believe this I backed out I believe this I had to do this but so and so said and there's always quoting so and so right brother so and so brother so and so but it's it's not back to the word he says but be born to the spirit and grow into the stature of Christ growing into the stature of Christ through your life proves like if you're born to Prophet you'll remain that if you're born to chrisan You'll remain that if you abide in me and my words abide in you this grows you up into the stature of Christ not some young lawyer beating screaming crying telling you this that and the other and make a lot of emotions if we don't do I hope the word's not boring you we could do this not some young lawyer beating screaming crying telling you this that and the other make a lot of emotions not some kid in the swimming pool just splashing out a bunch of water right someone who knows how to make progress in the water but somebody who's grown into the stature of Christ through the years has been seasoned out and proven standing at the helm no other Rock he says on Christ the solid rock we stand on all the ground is sinking sand let denominations and Creeds come go and go let isms keep me humble Lord stay right with the word and move right on through the stream she guide us to the shore full statment now look if we see how it turns out here and you can't change after death so there's your character death isn't going to process a renewing of your mind it's just a change of Dwelling Place he say now you watch these people that come in gets all the sensations and things and runs out and tomorrow they're this way have you seen it hundreds of them and you see what happens and now what if them people died in that state death doesn't change it so oh Christians in closing this words let me say this so we'll just invite the musicians to come let us turn to him in his word With all sincerity come humbly like Christians to be born again of a spirit and when you're born again you are Vindicated a Christian by the fruits that you bear you are a Christian by your fruits that you bear by their fruits you shall know them that's a Vindication you might not know your ABCs but yet you can be a lady a Christian you might be hated of the world if you do it's because something you've done you should be but if you're hated for his sake that's different if all the things he says about the jumping up and down and the hollering and the sensations and speaking in tongues and the Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah the beating screaming crying making a lot of emotions he says let's just turn to him in his word With all sincerity be born again and then let your life vindicate it by the that it Bears the evidence of the Holy Ghost working in the believer's Life by maturing them out growing into the stature of Christ through the years being seasoned out proved you got to be proved tested growing up to him seasoned that's our journey that's our process you may look at your life tonight and say well I believe I was born again 26 years ago and I don't feel that I'm much further down the road now than I ever was before then I just say yeah about time you start growing I I'm not even I don't even feel like I need to beat you up and say you never got it the begin way say no just if you've got the Holy Ghost grow grow up yes start growing up get out of these cycles and these isms and things brother man continues just skipping a little bit he says when you're born again God vindicates you that's how God vindicates all his Nature by their fruits that's the way he vindicates his ministry all his servants are Vindicated the same way he vindicates nature it's not so much a the external expression of the fruits of the spirit but the fruit of the gift of the spirit the fruit of the spirit it's not so much uh an outward impersonation but an inward demonstration inward possession brother B teaches on that in a number of different places and so he says he vindicates it by Nature how do you know it's a peach tree how do you know is it scratch and sniff he says cuz it brings peaches how do you know it's an apple tree bearing apples how do you know it's a Christian Christian signs bear from it Christian Life comes out of it now remember when he says oh they spoke in tongues he says be Larry he says I hope the word's not boring you why because maybe it's going to take a little bit of pressing in to understand what he means when he can say Your Life Christian signs will bear from it and he's not necessarily saying laying hands on the sick and speaking in tongues and dancing and shouting he's speaking to a life of value of character Christ's life comes from it how do you know he's a teacher the word comes from how do you know he's a prophet the word comes through him Bears record Vindication it proves itself how does it become that when it dies and becomes one that's right when we die and become a new creature in Christ it gets us with our calling we stay with our calling the fruits of the spirit follow us when we are his servants when we're born again the fruits of Christ life follow us how do you know it's a peach tree I actually went back and was like wait a minute copy and past and right on top of each other no he says how do you know it's a peach tree it's got peaches how do you know he's a Christian he acts like Christ he walks like Christ he talks like Christ he lives like Christ above sin Victorious that's it's high standards he loves his wife like Christ loves the church high standards she reverence her her reverences her husband as the church does Christ high standards what does he do say see what I done Christ didn't do that soce the attitude the character the humility he gave all praise to the father that's right that's how you know it by their fruits you shall know them he says verily verely I say you except a man be born again he cannot even understand the kingdom of God I hope that paints a picture for you of what God means when he says we got to grow up and in my emphasis I acknowledge that even tonight there may be a lot of emphasis to say the screaming the shouting the dancing the hauling the speaking in tongues and all these things are are could be distractions or red herrings or things that we try to put way too much weight and emphasis on at the expense of our development our growth but I don't want I don't want my emphasis to be so one-sided or you to go too far with my emphasis to turn these things into a bad thing but I want you to understand it's part of our growth as a Christian it's part of our experience I'm glad that when I begin to serve the Lord there was so much there's Supernatural things happening and there was a lot of weeping a lot of crying there was more shouting there was more enthusiasm there was these things that took place early on in my development that are still with me today still a part of who I am I and and they've made me what I am and it it's given me perspective and it it helped establish me in faith to believe God and then to take them at his word and and and it was God just pouring out his love upon me getting my attention and I trust that as my faith has grown in my love has grown that I don't have to lean into that as much as I can just his word and sense his presence and surrender myself in ways to where he can truly use me and grow and develop in other areas that maybe I couldn't then and I was enjoying a certain season and experiencing different things and now what I want is I want to become more like Christ I want to walk with Christ I want to talk like Christ I want to live like Christ I want to be victorious over sin and so I trust that you can see that there is this pattern of these things working together and if you're a young person if you're young in spirit if you enjoy these certain things by way of Personality or or or or or nurture nature then those things are wonderful they're fine but what we emphasize and what we want to see is the word of God that it's not boring us but it's shaping us because in everything that we get let maybe could just say that it's fine to have a lot of carrying on but we need enough word behind it to back it up so that we can grow up amen God bless you tonight I'd like to pray with you so if you could stand
