[0:00] It is I want to define it out the out at
[0:03] the outset but if you could just conjure
[0:04] up this mind in your mind the image of a
[0:07] wilderness or something laid waste. I
[0:09] was even thinking of the prophecy uh in
[0:12] terms of whatever that may look like
[0:14] whether spiritually or literally of
[0:15] America just being burnt over and just
[0:18] laid waste and and the conditions the
[0:20] spiritual climate that we live in today
[0:22] in this wasteland that we find ourselves
[0:25] in. And I was originally going to call
[0:26] it living in a wasteland. But let's just
[0:29] look at this wasteland that we are uh
[0:32] surrounded by and that we're making our
[0:35] testimony in. Waste is something that is
[0:37] uncultivated. Empty or desolate. So I
[0:40] would look that look at that as
[0:42] something that is
[0:44] uh a vanity. It's empty. There's nothing
[0:47] to it. Unultivated or desolate. And land
[0:50] is just simply uh soil or ground,
[0:53] something that should or could uh
[0:56] inhabit something or something could be
[0:58] inhabited in it or something could dwell
[0:59] in it and flourish. And so a waste land
[1:02] is wasted soil, wasted opportunity,
[1:04] wasted ground. Some scriptural images
[1:06] just to get us going. In Psalms 107
[1:10] 33 and 34, it's speaking of the Lord. He
[1:12] turneth rivers into a wilderness and
[1:15] water springs into dry ground. that
[1:17] wilderness and dry ground. That speaks
[1:19] of a waste land, a fruitful land into
[1:22] barrenness, for the wickedness of them
[1:24] that dwell therein. Because of the
[1:26] wickedness of those that live in the
[1:28] land, the land will become wasted. It'll
[1:30] become barren, a wilderness, and full of
[1:32] dry ground. Baroness means it's not
[1:34] producing what it potentially could. In
[1:37] Isaiah 64:es 10 and 11, it says, "The
[1:40] holy cities are a wilderness. Zion is a
[1:43] wilderness. Jerusalem a desolation.
[1:45] They're wasted." Uh it's not that it's
[1:48] uh been paved over with concrete, but
[1:51] the ground has become barren. Our holy
[1:53] and our beautiful house where our
[1:55] fathers praise thee is burned up with
[1:58] fire and all our pleasant things are
[2:01] laid waste. This is the opposite of
[2:04] flourishing. This is the opposite of
[2:08] something growing or something being
[2:09] cultivated and cared after and tended
[2:11] to. And it's not even that it's just
[2:13] grown up with briars and weeds, but it's
[2:15] just become wasted and it's desolate
[2:19] and this wasteland. That's that's the
[2:21] scriptural image I want you to have as
[2:23] we look at this subject. Now, kind of
[2:25] give you some background of what why I'm
[2:27] going to go down this particular avenue.
[2:30] And I'll say this at the outset that
[2:32] I've been studying where brother
[2:33] Brandham is using the themes of music,
[2:36] the symphony, and how that the conductor
[2:39] has sheet music and we need to know our
[2:41] parts. And so I've really been inspired
[2:42] by that in the sense of the timing, the
[2:45] rhythm, and the beat. So those are the
[2:46] things I've been studying. This is kind
[2:48] of my uh my way to get there. When we
[2:51] were in Europe as a family, we had
[2:52] meetings in Germany. The meetings went
[2:54] wonderful. We were just blessed as a
[2:55] family to participate in them, and we
[2:57] appreciate your supporting going. But
[3:00] while we were there, we took some time
[3:01] afterwards to visit uh to do some
[3:04] vacation things and uh take Elliot on a
[3:07] shopping spree. And we visited a few
[3:09] museums while we were there. Uh, one was
[3:11] in just a very beautiful national park.
[3:13] It was very, it's kind of more remote.
[3:15] We went to the Van Go Museum, the
[3:16] Reichkes Museum, and we really, uh,
[3:18] those are some of the things that I
[3:20] enjoy. Our family enjoys it. Uh, it's a
[3:22] exceptional experience. We really,
[3:23] really love it. Uh, know that when you
[3:25] go to Amsterdam, a coffee shop is
[3:27] different there than what it would be
[3:29] here. And so there's some things that
[3:31] you avoid in Amsterdam and things that
[3:32] we don't necessarily go for. But we as
[3:35] we were visiting these museums,
[3:37] especially once we were in Amsterdam,
[3:39] and my family can attest to this, they
[3:40] were crowded, even seems some of the
[3:43] more famous museums in Europe are
[3:44] starting to become overcrowded. And it
[3:47] was hot, hotter than it is here to me.
[3:50] And uh so we felt I felt rushed. If it's
[3:53] crowded, if it's hot, if you're
[3:54] uncomfortable, if there's people around
[3:55] you and there's different pacing and
[3:57] everything, you kind of feel rushed even
[3:59] though you're standing there looking at
[4:01] something that some people will never
[4:03] have the opportunity to look at. You
[4:05] can't even really fathom in your mind
[4:07] that I'm looking at something that is
[4:09] known around the world that is valued at
[4:11] tens of millions of dollars if not more,
[4:13] hundreds of millions of dollars in some
[4:14] cases. And I realized having gone
[4:17] through the exercise and the sacrifice
[4:19] of visiting these museum and museums and
[4:22] spending a lot of time that nothing is
[4:24] really learned or gained just by seeing
[4:26] the art, right? No, I saw the vamir. I
[4:28] saw it. I saw the night watch. I I saw
[4:30] the Picasso. I I saw these different
[4:32] things. Nothing really happens but
[4:34] merely passing time. You look at it.
[4:37] Okay, I've now seen it in the flesh what
[4:39] I've seen in better detail on Google.
[4:42] Uh, I spent more time with it online. I
[4:45] spent more time in the museum going
[4:46] through their virtual tour than I could
[4:48] when I'm actually there. And I realized
[4:49] that this content cons consumption
[4:52] without some positive addition or or
[4:55] process was empty.
[4:57] That though I could say I did it, that
[5:00] that was kind of the real shallowess of
[5:02] our present existence is so many people
[5:04] have a bucket list just to say they
[5:07] checked it off. I think it was in
[5:09] Elizabeth's family. She told me one time
[5:11] she had a sibling that would write
[5:13] things down on the to-do list, things
[5:14] they had to do that day that were just
[5:17] really obvious, like open your eyes and
[5:20] and check it off, get out of bed, check
[5:22] it off, take a shower, check it off,
[5:23] brush your teeth, take and and there was
[5:25] things so you could look at the list
[5:26] later on, say, "Man, I did a hundred
[5:27] things on my list today." And and it was
[5:30] uh make a list, check items off, you
[5:33] know, and so you get you can get through
[5:34] that list pretty quickly. And so there's
[5:37] just something that was uh there's an
[5:40] emptiness to that if there's not some
[5:42] something added or there's something in
[5:44] a process that you engage in that's
[5:46] beneficial. So without learning without
[5:49] understanding or even to clear up a
[5:51] misunderstanding or see something in a
[5:53] way you haven't previously seen it or
[5:55] learn or even to be challenged by
[5:58] something. If we don't recognize the
[6:00] challenge, if we're not even in some
[6:01] ways being accosted by something, then
[6:03] it really is a waste of time.
[6:06] the things that we engage in. And so it
[6:09] demonstrated something to me about life
[6:12] and most importantly what God wants out
[6:14] of life for us that there's there's
[6:17] something to be gained. There's
[6:19] something to be learned. There's a
[6:20] process that we're engaged in and
[6:22] there's a way that God's wanting to use
[6:24] us and there's a lot of things that just
[6:26] distract us. Maybe I think distraction
[6:28] may be an easier word to use.
[6:32] This is a statement. Some of you I'm
[6:34] sure have read it. It's he writes it in
[6:35] an experiment in criticism by CS Lewis.
[6:38] A lot of you do that. You're scientists
[6:40] in this experiment in criticism. He says
[6:43] the first demand of any work of art
[6:45] makes upon us is surrender.
[6:51] Look, listen, receive. Get yourself out
[6:55] of the way. So this first demand that
[6:58] any work of art, now when I say a work
[7:00] of art, you may be thinking, oh,
[7:01] standing before that Picasso or looking
[7:03] at the night watch and you're thinking
[7:05] maybe the visual arts and things that
[7:07] would be painted or sculptures, but this
[7:09] would go with respect to any work of art
[7:11] and primarily I would say the word of
[7:13] God, which is his artwork, the Bible,
[7:16] his creation. The first demand of any
[7:19] work of art makes upon us is surrender.
[7:22] You have to stop. You have to yield. You
[7:24] have to look, listen, receive from it.
[7:27] He says, "Get yourself out of the way."
[7:29] That's one of those gifts that uh you
[7:31] have to have is the gift of getting
[7:32] yourself out of the way. He said,
[7:33] "There's no good asking first whether
[7:35] the work before you deserve such a
[7:37] surrender. For until you have
[7:39] surrendered, you cannot possibly find
[7:41] out." This is this is a challenge. This
[7:44] is a I'm wanting to challenge you today
[7:46] and cause you to pause a little bit that
[7:48] when you see things and experience
[7:50] things or you're debating whether or not
[7:52] you want to experience it or you found
[7:55] yourself in a situation where you're
[7:57] looking at something or experiencing
[7:59] something this the demand upon you to
[8:02] surrender to look to listen to get
[8:04] yourself out of the way. Now, not
[8:06] necessarily to the image or to the work
[8:09] of art so that it could infiltrate your
[8:11] thoughts and take over you. But the
[8:13] surrender is it's not to place yourself
[8:16] under the influence or power or control
[8:18] of the art, but rather the yielding of
[8:20] time to consider it to the yield
[8:23] yourself to to identify what can be
[8:25] learned, what can be gained, what can be
[8:27] taken away. How is it I'm challenged?
[8:30] There's a lot of times we learn and we
[8:32] learn things and it's not necessarily
[8:33] from the standpoint of h positive or
[8:37] good and I came away a better person
[8:38] because I I learned a better process to
[8:41] overcome but rather you learn that
[8:42] doesn't work. I learned where that comes
[8:45] from. I I I've learned something from
[8:47] that. So there's this
[8:50] this demand or now this challenge that
[8:53] we have got to be in this state of mind
[8:55] to where I want to learn from God. I
[8:57] want to grow. I want to make my way
[9:00] through my daily life realizing that God
[9:02] allows things to happen. He's working
[9:04] all things to the good. And so God can
[9:08] speak to me. He can use different
[9:09] things. I can use the Holy Spirit inside
[9:11] of me to learn and gain from things that
[9:13] I experience in a way that makes me a
[9:16] better Christian and influences others.
[9:18] Amen. So the the whole thought is
[9:20] there's a lot of things we can engage
[9:22] in, but if it doesn't if it if it
[9:24] remains shallow, it's a waste.
[9:28] A and and not that waste is bad. Uh
[9:31] there's a lot of nuclear facilities that
[9:33] uh produce nuclear waste. That's what
[9:35] they produce and the byproduct is
[9:36] energy. In Ephesians chapter 5 14 to 21,
[9:41] let's look at this now together. Let's
[9:44] read through this. I just want to read
[9:45] through it so we have it as our point
[9:49] something we could point to as this full
[9:51] thought. Of course, it's within a larger
[9:53] context of the letter to the church at
[9:55] Ephesus. Wherefore he saith, "Awake thou
[9:58] that sleepest, and arise from the dead,
[10:01] and Christ shall give thee light." We'll
[10:02] come back to this phrase, but he's
[10:04] obviously quoting God, or quoting the
[10:06] prophet. Awake thou that sleepest, and
[10:08] arise from the dead, and Christ shall
[10:10] give thee light. See then that you walk
[10:12] circumspectly, not as fools, that is
[10:15] wise, having been awakened. Notice these
[10:18] things. Awake those that sleep, arise
[10:20] from dead. Christ will give light. not
[10:22] as fools but as wise redeeming the time
[10:26] because the days are evil. Brother Elzer
[10:28] ministered on this uh recently. It was
[10:30] just fantastic. It really opened up my
[10:32] understanding. He says, "Wherefore be
[10:34] you not unwise, but understanding what
[10:36] the will of the Lord is." So again,
[10:38] there's those some of these same things.
[10:41] and be not drunk with wine, wherein is
[10:43] excess, but be filled with the spirit,
[10:46] speaking to yourselves in psalms and
[10:48] hymns and spiritual songs, singing and
[10:50] making melody in your heart to the Lord.
[10:54] That's a that's quite a phrase. This is
[10:56] part of the um the center of the things
[10:58] I've been looking at. Speaking to
[11:00] yourselves in psalms and hymns and
[11:01] spiritual songs, singing and making
[11:03] melody in your heart to the Lord. So,
[11:04] there's this this theme song that we as
[11:07] Christians, he says, to walk
[11:09] circumspectly. We've got a walk up song
[11:11] that's playing in our hearts and in our
[11:13] lives. So, giving thanks always for all
[11:15] things unto God and the Father in the
[11:17] name of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[11:18] submitting yourselves one to another in
[11:22] the fear of God. I would encourage you,
[11:25] even if we don't spend a lot of time
[11:27] going back through these verses in
[11:28] future services, I would encourage you
[11:30] to deeply study this and contemplate it.
[11:33] If visiting an art museum and looking at
[11:35] a piece of art, they say you should sit
[11:37] and and look at it and consider things
[11:39] for a certain period of time, this is
[11:41] something that would be worthy of our
[11:42] slowing down, pausing in our
[11:44] consideration with some deep
[11:46] contemplation of these scriptures
[11:48] because there's beautiful principles
[11:50] that have been woven together here. We
[11:52] have themes of awakening and
[11:54] enlightenment and walking and
[11:55] perfection, wisdom, revelation. They're
[11:57] all being woven together with singing
[11:59] and making melody and harmony.
[12:02] And through this, I want to begin to
[12:05] address the concept of time. Now you're
[12:07] the concept of time is even just
[12:10] chronology or these moments. But then
[12:12] also timing. How that we exist within
[12:15] time and how that we must master time.
[12:18] We must master timing. We know that
[12:20] God's will has to be in his in its
[12:22] season. And that there's things that we
[12:24] can know to do, but it's got to be the
[12:26] right time to do it. And there's a
[12:28] there's a way to do it. There's a
[12:30] rhythm. There's a harmony. There's a way
[12:32] that things coales and work together.
[12:35] And so, this is what I'm looking at.
[12:36] Time even the time that we live in or or
[12:39] timing the rhythm of things. And this is
[12:42] the scripture that's at the heart of it.
[12:44] Ephesians chapter 5:1 16. The very heart
[12:47] of this it is
[12:50] redeeming the time because the days are
[12:54] evil. This is a very poetical phrase I
[12:57] think and it means by time.
[13:00] It's not that we could go back and do it
[13:03] over again. So now having awoke been
[13:06] awakened the we can redeem time. We can
[13:09] buy time. In Daniel chapter 2:8, the
[13:12] king has asked his wise men uh to to
[13:15] interpret this dream for him. And
[13:17] they're like, "Well, tell us again, you
[13:19] know, what it was, and if you could just
[13:20] describe it for us, and uh give us all
[13:23] the details. We'll tell you what it
[13:24] means." And the king answered and said,
[13:25] "I know of certainty that you would gain
[13:27] the time because you see the thing is
[13:29] gone from me." In other words, they knew
[13:31] that he couldn't answer, but they kept
[13:34] asking questions so that they could gain
[13:36] the time. It means by time, prolong
[13:39] time. Have you any any of you ever used
[13:41] that expression before? I'm just buying
[13:43] time. I I'm just trying to get myself
[13:45] more time before something's demanded,
[13:47] before something's due, or before you
[13:49] make a decision. This original
[13:51] expression even here in the Hebrew, gain
[13:53] the time. It speaks of using your best
[13:55] efforts to free yourself from a
[13:57] dangerous situation to to put put off to
[14:01] stave off danger as much as possible or
[14:03] to free yourself from from some from
[14:05] some difficulty. So, it's a matter of
[14:09] think about this. It's a matter of
[14:10] making time your own,
[14:13] using it for your own advantage, using
[14:15] time for your purposes. In the same way
[14:18] that we will take money and misuse it,
[14:19] we do the same thing with time. I've
[14:22] told myself quite often over the last
[14:24] couple decades that God has given me
[14:26] enough money and enough time. I just
[14:29] mismanage both. That I'm never in need
[14:32] of more money. I'm never in need of more
[14:33] time. God's given it to me. If there's
[14:35] any want or lack, it's because I haven't
[14:37] handled it properly. And I say that not
[14:40] uh as a positive confession to believe
[14:42] that Lord you've provided enough time.
[14:44] You've provided me enough resources.
[14:46] Help me to be a better more faithful
[14:48] steward of those things so that I I can
[14:52] uh accumulate that or grow it as as some
[14:55] uh strategies towards building wealth.
[14:57] We wealth is that your income is your
[14:59] greatest asset. So you want to save, you
[15:01] want to be disciplined. And so I believe
[15:03] that God gives us enough income. He
[15:05] gives us enough resources. He's given us
[15:06] enough money and time. We want we want
[15:08] to manage it, make it our own and use it
[15:10] for our own purposes. Here's a few
[15:12] statements that I read as commentary on
[15:14] these verses or translations. Redeeming
[15:17] for yourselves, that is availing
[15:19] yourselves of the opportunity offered
[15:22] you of acting right and commanding the
[15:25] time as a master does his servant. You
[15:29] treat time as your servant.
[15:33] says, ' Watch the time and make it your
[15:34] own so as to control it. As merchants,
[15:37] look out for opportunities and
[15:38] accurately choose out the best goods.
[15:41] Serve not time, but command it and it
[15:43] shall do what you approve.
[15:46] There's one, since we've been quoting
[15:47] the classics, there's one Greek classic
[15:49] that writes Pendar that writes in the
[15:51] Pythia of how that he mastered time and
[15:53] he he took time and time followed him as
[15:56] a servant and was not a runaway slave.
[15:59] in ways we're often chasing time. It
[16:02] gets away from us. We can't quite uh uh
[16:05] we find ourselves servants to it or it
[16:07] gets it's no longer under our control.
[16:09] But it says time followed him as his
[16:11] servant. To redeem the time means to
[16:13] make wise and sacred use of your time
[16:15] such that it yields and tends to good
[16:18] something positive. And he gives us the
[16:21] reason for that. He doesn't say redeem
[16:22] the time because the price is high or
[16:25] the exchange rate is really good. But he
[16:26] says, "Redeem the time because times are
[16:29] full of annoyances and hardships and
[16:31] labors and wickedness. Redeem the time
[16:34] because the days are evil."
[16:37] In Ephesians 5:18, we're just skipping
[16:40] around in these this text here. He says,
[16:42] "And be not drunk with wine wherein is
[16:46] excess, but be filled with the spirit."
[16:49] He's identifying the wickedness of the
[16:52] time. He says, "Redeem the time.
[16:53] Understand what the will of the Lord
[16:55] is." And then his followup to because
[16:57] the days are evil are saying and it
[17:00] maybe it seems odd to saying be not
[17:01] drunk with wine where in his exes man
[17:03] those guys at Ephesus were sure we're
[17:05] hard drinkers. I remember I've I think
[17:07] I've told the story here before but when
[17:09] we were uh my mom one time when we were
[17:11] just kids she went to a garage sale and
[17:13] she found this giant beerstein. I mean
[17:15] it was just a really something you
[17:17] probably got in uh is it beerfest or
[17:19] whatever it is they celebrate there in
[17:20] Germany. It was really really big. And
[17:22] my mom picked it up and she's holding
[17:23] this giant beer mug and she looks over
[17:26] at the one host in the garage and says,
[17:28] "My husband's a big drinker." And she
[17:31] meant he drinks a lot of water. But to
[17:33] the person who saw her holding that
[17:34] stein is thinking, "Wow, okay. They must
[17:37] be really heavy drinkers over there at
[17:38] the McGuria household." But it's it's be
[17:41] not drunk with wine where in his excess
[17:43] is not necessarily identifying the wine
[17:45] bibbers or those that were given to
[17:47] alcohol, but it speaks to the wickedness
[17:49] of the age. to be filled with the
[17:51] spirit. So that that that identifies how
[17:54] that there's something else motivating
[17:55] and moving you that you're you're
[17:57] animated by and you're driven by a
[18:00] different need, a different law, a
[18:01] different influence. But he identifies
[18:03] the wickedness of the time. It's that
[18:05] wastefulness of inappropriate
[18:07] stimulation.
[18:09] And be not drunk with wine wherein is
[18:11] excess. When you've come to that place
[18:14] wherein is excess, it's wastefulness.
[18:17] That's what he begins to identify. So
[18:19] when he says be not drunk with wine,
[18:22] moderation, he says wherein there is
[18:24] excess. Moderation is not the answer to
[18:27] the excess in terms of him saying look
[18:30] you're drinking too much only do it on
[18:31] Monday, Wednesday, Friday. It wasn't in
[18:33] terms of limiting their use of or their
[18:35] involvement in but he's saying this
[18:39] identify those things
[18:41] wherein
[18:43] it doesn't yield positive benefits.
[18:47] So the solution to excess was not
[18:49] moderation but fruitfulness.
[18:52] The because he says and and walk in the
[18:54] spirit or be filled with the spirit so
[18:56] that and the fruits of the spirit are
[18:57] and he teaches those things. If we walk
[18:59] in the spirit we will not fulfill the
[19:01] deeds of the flesh. So there's a lot of
[19:03] tie into these other principles. The
[19:04] solution to this excess is fruitfulness
[19:07] value worth.
[19:10] This is the opposite of wasting time.
[19:13] when you waste time a and maybe you you
[19:16] use it in a manner to where it doesn't
[19:18] yield anything. It just passes or where
[19:21] you indulge in something and you have
[19:23] excess. That's the waste that comes from
[19:25] it.
[19:27] Philippians 4:5 says, "Let your
[19:29] moderation be known unto all men. The
[19:32] Lord is at hand." Combining this even
[19:35] within this context and where he uses a
[19:37] similar phrase to the Corinthians, it's
[19:39] speaking of judgment, discernment,
[19:41] righteousness, correctness. Let your
[19:43] moderation be known unto all men. This
[19:45] moderation isn't well he doesn't drink
[19:47] too much. He doesn't always eat his
[19:49] meals, but it means that you yield. It
[19:51] speaks of yieldingness. It's related to
[19:54] patience and self-control. So though it
[19:57] would have uh application to how much
[19:59] someone would indulge in something, but
[20:01] to let your moderation be known to all
[20:03] men, it means you're yielding.
[20:05] You're submitting.
[20:08] So Paul in identifying this e
[20:10] excessiveness of stimulation
[20:13] which is not which is counter to or
[20:16] counterproductive to being filled with
[20:18] the spirit he says in Ephesians 5 21
[20:20] submitting yourselves one to another in
[20:23] the fear of God.
[20:26] This is this is not to husbands this is
[20:28] to their wives or wives to their
[20:29] husbands. This is us submitting
[20:31] ourselves one to another. Submitting
[20:33] yourselves one to another in the fear of
[20:35] God. There's a yielding there. There's a
[20:39] consideration that's given. If Paul was
[20:41] to take this and extrapolate it further,
[20:43] you'd find that there's places where he
[20:44] says, "Though you may have certain
[20:46] rights, yield to your brother's
[20:48] sensitivities. Though you may be allowed
[20:50] to do certain things, there's a
[20:51] yielding. There's a submitting."
[20:54] And and it's done for the purpose that
[20:56] we would not be wasteful.
[20:59] in the beginning of this reading, verse
[21:01] 14, Ephesians chapter 5:14.
[21:04] I know I'm going very quickly today, but
[21:06] I I
[21:10] think the pace is fine.
[21:14] He says, "Wherefore," he saith,
[21:17] "Awake thou that sleepest,
[21:21] and arise from the dead, and Christ
[21:24] shall give thee light."
[21:28] terms here we could just drill down on.
[21:30] You could do a series on awakening. We
[21:32] could do a great deep study on what's
[21:34] sleeping, what it means to rise from the
[21:36] dead. Christ shall give thee light. But
[21:38] it's a spiritual resurrection that he's
[21:40] speaking of an awakening. And then
[21:43] light. So you're dead. There's this
[21:46] lifelessness.
[21:48] You're sleeping
[21:50] dead. Christ now gives you light. Light
[21:53] has a purpose. It has an effect. Light
[21:54] is for the purpose of flourishing or
[21:56] nourishment.
[21:58] He speaks. He says, "Wherefore, he
[22:00] saith," and he's quoting Isaiah 26:1 19.
[22:04] Now, if you could read this together,
[22:05] you'll find it very interesting. As Paul
[22:07] says, he says, "Awake thou that sleep,
[22:09] rise from the dead. Christ shall give
[22:10] thee light." When you look at the
[22:12] prophecy, thy dead men that men shall
[22:15] live
[22:17] together with my dead body shall they
[22:19] arise.
[22:20] Awake thou that sleepest, arise from the
[22:22] dead. He says, "Awake and sing,
[22:25] ye that dwell in dust, for thy dew is as
[22:28] the dew of herbs, and the earth shall
[22:30] cast out the dead."
[22:34] So the the imagery here is one that
[22:36] would be in the dirt or in the soil.
[22:38] They're dead. The dead shall live. My
[22:41] body shall arise. So awake and sing, ye
[22:43] that dwell in the dust, for you will
[22:45] grow like plants that are drenched with
[22:47] the morning dew.
[22:50] The light is shining. This dew is is
[22:52] sparkling. This dew is a symbol of
[22:54] fertility and life. The dew will soak
[22:57] the dust of the ground and cause growth
[22:59] to spring forth. The earth is going to
[23:01] yield fruitfulness. So when Paul says,
[23:04] "Awake thou that sleepest and arise from
[23:05] the dead, and Christ shall give thee
[23:07] light," he's speaking of a a a growing
[23:10] forth.
[23:11] Awake you that are sleeping. Where
[23:13] there's no life, there's no activity.
[23:15] Arise, and then there's going to be
[23:16] light that shines to give life, to
[23:18] promote virtue.
[23:21] And as it says, awake and sing. In
[23:24] Ephesians 5 19 and 20, he says, as he
[23:27] says, awake you that are sleeping.
[23:29] Christ will give you light. Speak to
[23:30] yourselves in psalms and hymns and
[23:32] spiritual songs. Singing and making
[23:34] melody in your heart to the Lord. He's
[23:36] continuing this theme of Isaiah 26.
[23:39] Speak to yourselves in psalms and hymns
[23:41] and spiritual songs. Singing and making
[23:42] melody in your heart to the Lord.
[23:44] There's a way that we're communicating
[23:46] externally, but more importantly,
[23:47] there's something that's happening
[23:48] internally, giving thanks always for all
[23:51] things unto God and the father in the
[23:53] name of our Lord Jesus Christ. This is
[23:55] mindfulness.
[23:57] There's some mindfulness here. There's
[23:58] some uh uh deliberation or even being
[24:01] deliberate in the terms of that you're
[24:03] saying, well, I'm speaking myself in
[24:04] psalms and hymns, spiritual songs,
[24:06] singing, making melody in my heart, and
[24:08] I'm giving thanks for all things. So
[24:10] there's a mindfulness with everything
[24:13] that even in the things that we'd say,
[24:14] "Man, I can't believe that happened.
[24:16] That was horrible. Lord, thank you for
[24:18] seeing me through it. Lord, thank you
[24:19] for the opportunity. Lord, I know that
[24:21] you're working all things for my good
[24:23] and this is horrible and this is a stain
[24:24] and this is a scar and I wish this
[24:26] wouldn't have happened, but Lord, I want
[24:28] to thank you that you you saw me through
[24:30] it. Lord, how how am I learning more of
[24:32] your heart?" Praise the Lord. So, it's a
[24:34] mindfulness as you go through this.
[24:37] There's more contemplation. Again, if
[24:39] you go through something and you learn
[24:40] nothing, in some ways it's a waste.
[24:44] And sometimes people say, "I don't know
[24:45] why I'm going through this all over
[24:46] again." And say, "Well, it means you
[24:48] have something to learn again." And they
[24:49] say, "Well, I didn't learn anything the
[24:50] first time." So, well, then you have
[24:51] something to learn.
[24:54] And that's the reason why God, if God
[24:56] puts you through it and you go through
[24:57] it again, he's given you an opportunity
[25:00] to learn again. And if you didn't learn
[25:02] the first time, you know why you're
[25:03] going through it again. There's
[25:04] something to gain from it. Otherwise, it
[25:06] is a waste. And God is not the author of
[25:09] waste.
[25:11] He's not a a nuclear plant. I don't know
[25:14] if you got my joke earlier, but nuclear
[25:16] facilities exist to produce energy and
[25:19] waste is the byproduct. I inverted it
[25:21] because I think it sounds funny
[25:25] to me and only me and those who work at
[25:28] nuclear waste facilities.
[25:31] In Psalms 107:es 35-38, you may recall
[25:34] that we read verses 33 and 34 at the
[25:36] outset. Says, "He turneth the wilderness
[25:39] into a standing water." Now we see the
[25:41] inverse. Whereas before the rivers ran
[25:44] dry and the ponds dried up and there was
[25:46] all the water springs were dry ground
[25:48] and there was barrenness. Now he says
[25:50] that he is able to turn the wilderness
[25:52] into standing water and dry ground into
[25:54] water springs. And there he maketh the
[25:57] hungry to dwell that they may prepare a
[26:00] city for habitation. There's provision.
[26:03] There's growth. And sew the fields and
[26:06] plant vineyards which may yield fruits
[26:08] of increase. The wasteland is now
[26:10] changing into a fruitful land. He
[26:12] blessed them also so that they are
[26:14] multiplied greatly and suffereth not
[26:16] their cattle to decrees.
[26:19] I believe that redeeming the time is
[26:21] understood in these principles. might be
[26:23] a lot of scriptures that we've just
[26:25] covered and it may be a wandering way
[26:26] through this. But when he says redeeming
[26:27] the time, gain the time, master it, use
[26:30] it for your own benefits, take control
[26:32] over it, and don't be drunk with wine
[26:34] where there is excess, where there's
[26:36] waste and things aren't fruitful,
[26:40] but awake and sing. Christ will give you
[26:42] light. As you walk through this and you
[26:43] see this at the very heart of redeeming
[26:45] the time is seen through these
[26:47] principles of a wilderness being turned
[26:49] into fruitfulness
[26:51] that there's something being watered.
[26:53] There's something being nourished. There
[26:56] are things that lull us to sleep.
[26:59] There's things that deaden our
[27:00] sensitivity.
[27:01] There's a way that once you're exposed
[27:03] to something enough, you become numb to
[27:05] it. See, even preservation, it preserves
[27:07] you.
[27:09] I think I may have quoted this recently,
[27:11] but John Trap, he was a a Puritan and a
[27:14] biblical writer in the 17th century. He
[27:16] said, 'Take heed also what book you
[27:18] read.
[27:20] For as water relisheth of the soul it
[27:22] runs through, so doth the soul of the
[27:24] authors that a man readth.
[27:28] And maybe it's in too much of a clumsy
[27:30] Puritan language, but did you get it?
[27:33] that when you read something that that
[27:35] you're being watered by the soul of that
[27:37] author.
[27:40] I I don't know that we can have the time
[27:42] to do the analytics on the souls of all
[27:44] the writers we're reading to find out
[27:46] what's in their soul, but it causes you
[27:49] to be challenged by and to think about
[27:53] that. The first thing that we're doing
[27:54] when we read something as as maybe we
[27:57] could say CS Lewis was challenging us to
[27:59] do is to stop to listen to get ourselves
[28:03] out of the way and perceive what is
[28:05] happening.
[28:09] And I'll try to maybe end on on
[28:13] uh end in a place where it's maybe a
[28:16] little bit more or give some more
[28:18] clarity to that.
[28:20] But it's not that you're always looking
[28:22] at something saying, "Was this of God or
[28:23] of the devil?" There's got to be there's
[28:26] something behind it. So instead of being
[28:28] mindless about it, be engaged.
[28:32] Be mindful. Be watching.
[28:36] Take heed to those things that you read.
[28:38] We could extend that to say, "Take heed
[28:40] to the things that you watch, the things
[28:41] that you hear. For as the rain will fall
[28:44] upon soil and it runs through it and it
[28:46] nourishes it, the soul of the authors,
[28:48] the soul of the writers, the ones that
[28:50] are producing the narrative, it runs
[28:52] through your spirit. When you read it,
[28:55] you see it or you hear it.
[28:58] And the question would be, what does it
[29:00] produce?
[29:02] I believe that waste is central to the
[29:04] meaning of these verses in Ephesians 5.
[29:07] This is how I came. I believe that the
[29:09] Lord led me to this title and this
[29:11] initial thought on this
[29:14] is that waste is at the heart of it
[29:17] because we're being challenged to make
[29:20] do use to maximize to master time. And
[29:24] so he's calling out this failure to use
[29:26] opportunities to grow.
[29:29] In Colossians 4:es 2-6 or he he's uses
[29:34] the same phrase in a different context.
[29:36] continue in prayer and watch in the same
[29:39] with thanksgiving. We're to pray
[29:41] continuously.
[29:43] The the the prayer shall continually be
[29:45] in our mouths. This is this is not uh a
[29:48] call to become monks who merely walk
[29:50] through life either not speaking or only
[29:52] quoting scripture, but this is to
[29:54] continue in prayer and watch in the same
[29:56] with thanksgiving. Look at how that
[29:58] speaks to speaking to yourselves in
[30:00] psalms, hymns, spiritual songs, singing,
[30:01] making melody in your heart, giving
[30:03] thanks always, continuing prayer,
[30:05] watching the same with thanksgiving. So
[30:07] there's a watching, there's a praying,
[30:09] there's a seeking and then catch this
[30:12] middle phrase here where where with all
[30:15] this is very specific also for praying
[30:18] also for us that God would open unto us
[30:21] a door of utterance to speak the mystery
[30:24] of Christ for which I am also in bonds
[30:26] very specific prayer for a very specific
[30:29] purpose purpose
[30:34] that God would give opportunity for the
[30:36] prophet to declare the mystery of
[30:38] Christ. The very thing that he is a
[30:40] prisoner to and the very thing that has
[30:42] made him a prisoner is declaring the
[30:44] mystery of God. But pray that God would
[30:46] give opportunity, open the door of
[30:48] utterance to proclaim and speak the
[30:50] mystery of Christ.
[30:52] That I may make it manifest as I ought
[30:55] to speak.
[30:58] That's the prayer that he wants them to
[31:00] pray for him. That's the image of what
[31:03] he desired to be cultivated in them that
[31:06] they could make it manifest. Amen. That
[31:09] they could utter it. They could declare
[31:10] it. So then he directs it to them. Walk
[31:13] in wisdom towards them that are without.
[31:16] Continue in prayer. Watching the same
[31:17] with thanksgiving. Now on the subject of
[31:19] declaring the mystery of Christ and
[31:21] making it manifest. Walk in wisdom
[31:23] towards them toward them that are
[31:25] without redeeming the time.
[31:29] as he said to the church at Ephesus,
[31:30] redeeming the time because the days are
[31:32] evil. Now to Colossians, walk in wisdom
[31:34] towards them that are without without
[31:36] wisdom outside the body, not believers,
[31:38] redeeming the time. Let your speech be
[31:42] always with grace. So it's not just his
[31:46] uttering the mystery of God, not just
[31:47] him speaking, but now also we ourselves.
[31:50] Let your speech be always with grace. As
[31:53] he wanted opportunity to speak the
[31:55] mystery of Christ, that it could be made
[31:56] manifest as he ought to speak. We
[31:58] ourselves are to speak. Let our speaking
[32:00] be with grace, seasoned with salt, that
[32:03] you may know how you ought to answer
[32:05] every man. Amen.
[32:09] Walk in wisdom towards them that are
[32:11] without. Redeeming the time, buying off
[32:13] the vanity and emptiness of the unwise,
[32:17] buying off, getting rid of the vanity of
[32:20] the mind. And if there's redemption,
[32:23] redemption implies preciousness.
[32:26] Redemption implies value.
[32:29] Maybe times when we go to redeem a
[32:31] coupon or use it and says, "Well, it's
[32:33] expired. It's worthless." If something
[32:35] can be redeemed, it speaks to its value,
[32:37] its preciousness. Redeem the time. It
[32:39] speaks of the valuess of time.
[32:43] That we likewise consider time, we could
[32:46] and can consider time to be a currency
[32:49] that we ought to save. We ought to
[32:50] preserve and spend wisely,
[32:54] making the very most of time and seizing
[32:56] it, buying it up as it were, and then
[32:58] using it to the best opportunity,
[33:00] avoiding waste.
[33:02] And he applies it also toward speaking
[33:04] because your words are also currency. I
[33:07] remember reading some books on the
[33:08] revolutionary writers and as I read
[33:10] through it might have been the book 1776
[33:12] and you're reading letter after letter
[33:14] and this is how they communicated so
[33:15] much of what was in their minds and
[33:17] their hearts is being written down. And
[33:19] my conclusion was these men viewed every
[33:22] single word they used as currency and
[33:24] they spent them wisely. It's not like we
[33:27] are today where we can when they limited
[33:28] us to 60 characters. Now we could just
[33:31] form a thread go on and on and on and on
[33:33] and on and on. There's no end to the
[33:36] things that people can spill out in
[33:38] blogs and vlogs and tweets and reals.
[33:41] It's just continuous. But yet there was
[33:42] a time when even the speech was
[33:45] precious.
[33:46] In Amos 5:13, it's talking about the
[33:49] wickedness of man and his hearts, even
[33:51] their their stubbornness. And it says,
[33:53] "Therefore, the prudent shall keep
[33:55] silence in that time, for it is an evil
[33:58] time."
[34:00] Paul says, "Redeeming the time as you
[34:03] walk wisely towards those who have not
[34:05] wisdom,
[34:06] as you are
[34:09] continuing in prayer, value time
[34:12] preciously
[34:15] and let your speech be seasoned with
[34:17] salt that you may know how to speak."
[34:18] And the Bible says, "The wise know when
[34:20] to keep their mouths shut." They're not
[34:22] going to waste their words with rhetoric
[34:24] and their reputation with extremes.
[34:25] They're not going to get caught up in
[34:27] vain causes. They're going to save that
[34:29] equity for worthy manners. I think it's
[34:32] a principle the boy cried wolf. The more
[34:34] often you complain and criticize. The
[34:36] moment when your complaint or your
[34:38] criticism is the most necessary, it will
[34:40] fall on dead ears.
[34:43] So therefore, our speech should be
[34:44] graceful, seasoned with salt so that
[34:47] it's what? Effective, it's useful, it's
[34:49] fruitful, it's beneficial.
[34:53] It's to be seasoned with salt is for the
[34:55] purpose of preservation. It was
[34:57] invigorating. It It was enhancing.
[35:00] In Luke 14 34-35,
[35:05] I love how Luke writes it, "Salt is
[35:07] good." And all the dietitians said, "Not
[35:10] so fast, buddy. Salt is good, but if the
[35:14] salt have lost its savor, wherewith
[35:17] shall it be seasoned?"
[35:20] Salt is good, but if it loses its
[35:23] goodness.
[35:24] Salt is good. It has a use. It's
[35:26] beneficial. But if it loses its
[35:28] effectiveness, then what what are you
[35:30] going to use to season? What benefit is
[35:32] it? How is it even itself going to be
[35:34] seasoned? If salt loses its savor, how
[35:37] is it redeemed?
[35:39] If it if it lo if salt having a certain
[35:42] power was stripped of that power, he's
[35:45] saying you can't give it back.
[35:48] It is neither fit for the land nor yet
[35:50] for the dungill,
[35:52] but men cast it out. He that hath ears
[35:55] to hear, let him hear. When the salt is
[35:59] no longer has its quality or character,
[36:01] it becomes worthless.
[36:04] There's no value to it. You can't inject
[36:06] value back into it. It's worthless. And
[36:08] he says, it's not good for anything.
[36:10] It's not fit for the land. It's not fit
[36:12] for the dungill.
[36:13] It's just going to add to the waste.
[36:18] So, it's just cast out, trotten
[36:21] underfoot, as it says, I believe in
[36:22] Matthew.
[36:25] Paul is using waste
[36:29] at the center of his admonishment
[36:31] to the church at Ephesians. Awake. Rise
[36:34] from the dead. Let the light of God
[36:36] shine upon you. And as it shines upon
[36:39] you, walk carefully, not as fools, but
[36:43] as wise.
[36:46] understanding what God wants done with
[36:49] his word. Redeeming the time because
[36:52] there's so much wastefulness.
[36:55] There's only so much opportunity given
[36:57] in every day. You cannot add to a day.
[37:00] You can't borrow from yesterday. You
[37:01] can't save for tomorrow. It comes and it
[37:03] goes. There's no getting it back. That's
[37:05] why salt once it's lost its
[37:07] effectiveness, there's no way to get it
[37:09] back.
[37:13] And I hope each one of you if you could
[37:15] just by bright eyes and smiles and amens
[37:17] and body posture and everything else put
[37:19] on your best behavior communicate to me
[37:21] that we're in just whoever is on the
[37:24] same page with me right now. I want to
[37:25] go forward
[37:27] and and very we're going to be done
[37:29] here. We're going to be done today. I
[37:31] just know it. I can feel it. We're going
[37:33] to be done.
[37:35] You're like, "What? That sounds
[37:36] forboding."
[37:39] The world we live in is that very title
[37:42] I gave my sermon, a wasteland.
[37:47] It has become so
[37:51] chaotic.
[37:54] And
[37:56] I think we could make the argument that
[37:58] in 1983, just to pull a random date,
[38:00] that it was probably just as wasteful
[38:03] and out of control and crazy.
[38:06] But now we just get to witness it in
[38:08] real time.
[38:10] It may be just that it's the same uh
[38:13] chaos but just more on a greater scale.
[38:16] I don't know. But it feels it gets
[38:18] darker and darker and more pervasive.
[38:21] And there's no there's no shelter
[38:24] anymore from this. We could spend a lot
[38:27] of time just pointing out that at one
[38:28] time a 100 years ago the church and
[38:31] religion and Christianity could have
[38:33] been a shelter from the chaos
[38:35] of modern evolution and modern times.
[38:38] But they kicked Christ out of the
[38:39] church. Now every single institution,
[38:41] whether it be education, religious or
[38:43] entertainment, society, all of it, I
[38:45] want to use this phrase. They're
[38:46] uncultivated.
[38:49] It's chaotic.
[38:51] So I use as an answer to waste. I want
[38:54] to use cultivation. There's something to
[38:57] be cultivated. As God puts it in the
[38:59] psalm that it becomes barren, it becomes
[39:01] fruitless. It becomes waste. It becomes
[39:02] desolate. But then he says, "Oh, no. I'm
[39:03] going to bring water in the wilderness,
[39:05] and dry ground is going to become water
[39:06] springs, and it's just not going to be
[39:08] wet. We're going to use it to plant
[39:09] vineyards and sew fields and yield
[39:11] fruits of increase, and the the the
[39:14] people themselves to multiply greatly,
[39:15] and their cattle not die off.
[39:18] It's making use.
[39:21] There's a way that even God identifies
[39:23] cultivation when he says, "I'm going to
[39:25] drive out your enemy from before you,
[39:27] and as you increase, you'll possess the
[39:28] land, and I won't let it be overrun and
[39:31] uncultivated to where it can be very
[39:34] verdant and green and have a lot of
[39:35] growth, but it's still yet a wasteland.
[39:38] It's wild. There's a lot of stuff.
[39:41] There's a lot of energy. There's a lot
[39:42] of movement, but yet it's chaotic. It's
[39:44] overgrown. It's not tilled. It's not
[39:46] cultivated."
[39:48] God placed man on the earth with this
[39:51] dominant characteristic to cultivate
[39:54] to till and to bring out all the
[39:57] potential of himself and the earth.
[39:59] Amen. To cultivate is to till prepare
[40:02] for crops to raise or produce. If you
[40:05] cultivate something to frequent, to
[40:07] practice, to respect means to tend to,
[40:10] to guard. If you cultivate, you improve
[40:12] by labor or study. You devote your
[40:14] attention to it.
[40:16] So to co to write that down with Ron
[40:20] Kakoff or whatever
[40:24] to cultivate
[40:26] it implies the improvement of nature.
[40:31] If we're to be cultivated ourselves or
[40:33] some improvement in our nature. It's the
[40:36] formation of character.
[40:38] To cultivate something it's something
[40:40] individual and it's something permanent.
[40:43] where if something is
[40:46] uh well and I I'll use I'll frame it in
[40:48] this respect that when there's a
[40:50] formation of character and improvement
[40:52] of nature then our character becomes
[40:54] values in action.
[40:57] Our character is not just merely what we
[40:59] think and what we feel and a and all of
[41:02] our opinions because really at the end
[41:03] of the day what I've recognized is a lot
[41:05] of pe people have a lot of hot sports
[41:07] opinions about everything.
[41:10] a lot of hot opinions about everything,
[41:12] but their actions are contrary to their
[41:15] rhetoric.
[41:17] So, it's just opinion. It's just shadow.
[41:19] It's just sound bites. It's the it's the
[41:21] reverberations of an echo chamber that
[41:23] have leaked out.
[41:26] But character is value and action,
[41:28] values in actions. The actions that we
[41:31] undertake reveal who we are.
[41:34] So, who we are determines our actions.
[41:38] And this uh may be just kind of like
[41:40] kicking open a door and you're like,
[41:42] man, we need to spend more time in here.
[41:43] You may run out real quick. This is
[41:45] different than personality.
[41:47] Your character is different from your
[41:49] personality. As I was studying on these
[41:52] very things, I found where there's uh
[41:55] there's a lot of research and academic
[41:58] uh writing on the kind of the
[42:00] development or the idea of personality.
[42:03] And there's many that attribute this
[42:04] concept of a personality as being a
[42:07] concept developed by psychology
[42:10] when it wanted to be a science and
[42:12] reject values
[42:15] that we want to have a personality that
[42:17] can be more fluid that can that it
[42:19] doesn't need to be uh we want to be a
[42:22] science. We want we want to be taken
[42:24] more seriously. So they had to reject
[42:26] values that could be very messy.
[42:28] And so they begin to swap value
[42:30] judgments or certain traits of honesty
[42:33] and loyalty and integrity and they
[42:36] swapped it for personality traits of
[42:38] self-esteem or being assertive.
[42:43] In the modern society that we live in
[42:45] today, brother Brandham constantly
[42:46] called out psychology. What what is what
[42:48] does psychology become? It swaps out
[42:52] it it removes the basis of the absolute.
[42:55] It takes away the authority of truth and
[42:58] it swaps it out for just a sound bite or
[42:59] a buzzword and it makes it very shallow
[43:01] to where well that's just their
[43:03] personality.
[43:04] That's just their personality. That's
[43:06] what they identify as or that's what
[43:08] they feel. That's how they want to be.
[43:09] And it gets away from values of honesty,
[43:12] integrity, loyalty.
[43:16] But and they swap out things that are
[43:19] have value
[43:21] for things that are you can't even pin
[43:23] down anymore.
[43:26] But despite modern society's fascination
[43:30] with psychology and personality,
[43:33] there's a thirst that's innate in man
[43:36] for truth.
[43:38] It's innate within them, a very deep
[43:42] hunger to know who they are, where they
[43:45] came from, who they are, where they're
[43:47] going. This ties into a lot of things
[43:48] we've been ministering on. And
[43:51] cultivation is the process that would
[43:53] supply that.
[43:56] The cultivation of one's mind and their
[43:58] character, their person.
[44:01] I'm not I'm not venturing into uh some
[44:03] other discipline or science. I'm
[44:06] specifically hearkening back to the
[44:08] principles of the scripture
[44:10] that there has to be a cultivation of
[44:12] our character,
[44:15] an improvement of our nature to identify
[44:18] fully who we are. Amen. To satisfy this
[44:22] innate desire in each one of us, this
[44:24] thirst and this hunger we have for
[44:25] truth. And if we're searching psychology
[44:27] and we're searching sciences to satisfy
[44:30] that, you'll have a lot that will take
[44:32] up your time and dominate your thought
[44:34] process and you'll get deeper and deeper
[44:36] into it to shut up the thirst you have
[44:39] to true to know truth.
[44:43] Some people become more extreme in those
[44:44] things because they more desperately
[44:46] want it.
[44:49] The Bible says in 2 Timothy chapter 3:7,
[44:52] before we read this, I'll say maybe
[44:54] phrase it in this sense, we're talking
[44:56] about learning. Cultivation is not the
[44:58] same as education in our modern sense.
[45:02] Because here in 2 Timothy 3:7, it says
[45:07] ever learning and never able to come to
[45:10] the knowledge of the truth.
[45:14] There's a lot of learning. There's maybe
[45:16] a lot that's uh rattling in the in the
[45:18] cage there. There's a lot of things that
[45:19] are being filled in. So, they're ever
[45:21] learning, but the learning never
[45:24] produces knowledge of truth. And we know
[45:26] that our liberty and our freedom and our
[45:28] deliverance and the un the unlocking of
[45:32] our potential is found in knowing truth
[45:35] and being made free.
[45:40] We can learn, we can be educated, but
[45:42] education and learning isn't always the
[45:44] same as coming to the knowledge of
[45:46] truth. Right? There was a time that I
[45:48] could say that our education was a means
[45:51] of shaping our nature, cultivating
[45:54] virtue and promoting moral character.
[45:56] That's why many of even our educational
[45:59] institutions were founded by churches
[46:02] because they viewed education as the
[46:04] process of cultivating our character,
[46:07] shaping our nature.
[46:10] But education has become mere learning.
[46:14] It's now has more to do with practical
[46:16] skills for economic progress and the
[46:18] shift happens when we become
[46:20] industrialized. So they wanted to shape
[46:21] education to fit the industrial
[46:24] revolution.
[46:26] There's a I could I could see where
[46:28] maybe some would say, "Well, brother
[46:29] Aaron, that that just seems to be more
[46:31] US history. That's more economics and
[46:33] society." But notice notice the shift
[46:37] from church age at the exact same time.
[46:42] You put you look at the history of the
[46:44] world. When you study the history of the
[46:45] world, don't forget that we have the
[46:46] history of the church. We have the
[46:49] benefit of the Bible to give us the lens
[46:51] through which we could begin to see
[46:52] what's shaping. Why did an island
[46:55] dominate and completely dominate the
[46:58] world and become a vast empire that
[47:00] spread the Bible in the English language
[47:03] around the world. The gospel followed in
[47:06] its path.
[47:08] God. There's a way that we can view over
[47:10] the top of it these things that take
[47:12] place God's program and what he's doing.
[47:15] So, his education changed to just uh
[47:19] trying to cultivate skill instead of
[47:22] character.
[47:24] They were no longer cultivating the
[47:26] intellect or the character or the moral
[47:29] development of a person.
[47:32] It was just learning.
[47:35] I hope this becomes somewhat of a a an
[47:38] affirmation for some and even a
[47:40] challenge to others that even when we're
[47:42] learning and we we're homeschooling or
[47:45] you're going to school that we have a
[47:47] burden and there's a lot of things I
[47:48] could show you to where uh whether it be
[47:51] certain institutions or even parents as
[47:53] a whole are beginning to wake up and
[47:54] realize that school no longer promotes
[47:57] virtue or character. They're no longer
[48:00] shaping honest hearts. They're no longer
[48:03] giving men to have hearts and have
[48:05] chest. As a matter of fact, they're
[48:06] telling them uh you don't need to know
[48:08] whether or not you are a man. There
[48:10] there's such a watering down now to
[48:12] where it's just practical skills and
[48:14] it's just life skills to where we in the
[48:17] absence of promotion of character. We've
[48:20] got to recognize that we have a duty as
[48:22] parents. We have a duty as adults to
[48:23] realize there's a there must be and
[48:25] there has to be this component in our
[48:27] home life and especially if you're
[48:29] homeschooling. We're not just trying to
[48:31] get through the videos so we can say
[48:33] they did their schoolwork, but we want
[48:35] to know that their hearts are being
[48:37] shaped
[48:39] to cultivate. We prepare.
[48:42] Something is cultivated. It's raised.
[48:44] It's developed. It's something's being
[48:46] produced to till, to labor, to tend. It
[48:48] is the opposite of waste.
[48:55] When you cultivate something, you're you
[48:57] prepare it to use it for a certain
[48:58] reason, whether it be gardening or
[48:59] crops. You acquire, you develop a
[49:01] quality, you develop, you cultivate the
[49:04] sentiment, you cultivate even it does
[49:05] speak to a skill, but it's not just
[49:07] learning.
[49:09] So, we'll take time maybe if the Lord
[49:10] would lead to look into scripture to
[49:12] find that in the building of the temple,
[49:15] the tabernacle, there were men with
[49:17] skill that God wanted to employ.
[49:21] In Proverbsap 10:16, it says, "The labor
[49:25] of the righteous tendeth to life,
[49:29] the fruit of the wicked to sin."
[49:32] The labor of the righteous tendeth. It's
[49:34] not just a tendency, but it actually
[49:36] tends, it promotes, it nourishes life.
[49:39] The wise labor, the labor of the
[49:41] righteous, this is walk circumspectly as
[49:44] wise, not as fools. those righteous who
[49:46] understand, who are discerning, who are
[49:48] mindful. I just kind of start jumbling,
[49:50] compacting all together these things we
[49:52] tried been trying to put before you in
[49:54] this picture. The labor of the wise
[49:56] promotes and produces the right results.
[50:00] Wisdom labors solely for the purpose of
[50:04] producing the right results. Right?
[50:08] It's about bringing forth good fruit
[50:10] because the fruit of the wicked promotes
[50:12] and tends to sin.
[50:14] Wicked labor nourishes the wrong things.
[50:18] The labor of the righteous tendeth to
[50:20] life.
[50:21] I'm not you I I I I trust that you don't
[50:24] think I'm using a language of rhetoric
[50:25] or or philosophy, but I believe the
[50:29] Bible teaches us
[50:31] to use critical thinking,
[50:34] to try the spirits, teaches us to have
[50:37] moral discernment,
[50:39] to to not just be narrow-minded, but
[50:41] even to have intellectual breath that we
[50:42] may know what is the height, the depth,
[50:45] a breadth,
[50:49] the labor, the righteous ious to walk
[50:51] wise to redeem the time enables us.
[50:54] There's a way that we're promoting
[50:55] virtue to enable us as individuals and
[50:58] and this is what cultivation should is
[51:02] of the by the word of God and by the
[51:03] Holy Spirit that indwells us and it's
[51:05] how we should ought to raise our
[51:06] children to where we're enabling
[51:08] individuals to engage mindfully
[51:12] meaningfully with the world.
[51:15] We got to know how to live in this
[51:17] wasteland.
[51:19] We need to be spiritual maggyvers who
[51:23] could turn a bunch of trash into
[51:25] something useful
[51:27] to where we're not just merely very
[51:30] external or shallow
[51:33] that there's some there's something
[51:34] deep, something heartfelt. We're not
[51:36] just concerned with the optics. We're
[51:37] not just concerned about learning a
[51:38] skill and making money. We'd be better
[51:40] off forming and shaping the hearts of
[51:43] our children a a and and and making sure
[51:46] that they have the right kind of
[51:48] character and having them sent out into
[51:50] the world as wolves than to make sure
[51:51] they got all the skills and all the
[51:53] education and all the degrees and all
[51:55] the scholarships they need so they can
[51:56] be successful. Right?
[52:01] I know that I used this statement some
[52:03] years ago here, but Oswald Chambers made
[52:06] the observation. And he says, "Most of
[52:07] us are not consistent spiritually
[52:10] because we're more concerned about being
[52:12] consistent externally."
[52:14] There's the facade.
[52:16] There's the shallowess.
[52:18] I'm sure most of you, if not all of you,
[52:20] have seen these representations in art
[52:23] where they take just garbage
[52:25] and they arrange it in such a way to
[52:27] where you look at it from the right
[52:28] perspective, it looks like a an image,
[52:32] but then as you go to the side, it's
[52:33] nothing but garbage. And you say, "Well,
[52:36] that seems to be a waste." Do you
[52:38] realize you could look at that as being
[52:40] an analogy of Leodysa?
[52:45] That what they present to you is a very
[52:47] articulate, plain and simple image.
[52:52] But if you change your vantage point
[52:54] like this is garbage.
[52:57] This is nothing but garbage.
[53:01] Because when we become only concerned
[53:02] about being consistent externally,
[53:05] then that's when we become inconsistent
[53:07] spiritually.
[53:09] Because our primary concern is matters
[53:11] of the heart.
[53:15] And brother Travis, I need you to be
[53:16] available for this.
[53:18] We've had limited discussions on this uh
[53:22] but he's kind of our resonant expert.
[53:24] But I want to use just in closing, use
[53:26] an element of storytelling,
[53:29] the art of storytelling to make a point
[53:32] about this wasteland,
[53:34] this wasteland you're living in, but
[53:36] need to find your way out of.
[53:41] And if I can put it this way, in the way
[53:43] that storytelling conveys meaning, in
[53:46] the way that storytelling is useful and
[53:48] has been preserved through generation
[53:50] after generation, uh because it conveys
[53:53] truth,
[53:56] our lives,
[53:58] we should recognize the same for our own
[54:00] lives in terms of something being
[54:03] shared.
[54:05] Paul, I believe, demonstrated in
[54:06] scripture where he took the stories of
[54:07] the classics and showed the moral truth
[54:10] to it. a component of truth.
[54:15] I can't remember the name of the author
[54:18] uh but it was written in terms of it uh
[54:21] I think it may be 19th century maybe
[54:24] 20th century but it says a great deal
[54:26] yes 20th century great deal of
[54:27] similarity between popular fiction
[54:30] there's a great deal of similarity
[54:31] between popular fiction and the religion
[54:33] of western people
[54:35] now listen popular culture
[54:41] popular fiction. This is literary
[54:44] devices and things that are written and
[54:46] religion of western people.
[54:48] Christianity. He says life according to
[54:52] that faith. Now this is a symmetry
[54:54] between fiction and faith is very like a
[54:58] serial story in a magazine.
[55:01] So serial story in a magazine would be a
[55:04] Netflix series, right? or a a series
[55:09] whether it be um
[55:12] uh the uh tool some written by Tolken or
[55:14] or some some derivative work to where
[55:16] there's something it just a series a
[55:20] story a serial story in a magazine life
[55:22] ends with the promise and then he says
[55:25] or menace to be continued in our next
[55:32] and that that's that's le oysia
[55:35] everything's to be continued
[55:37] It's this menace or promise. You'll find
[55:40] out in the next episode.
[55:43] And he's and this observation is what
[55:46] has worked in popular fiction has now
[55:48] become the mantra of even religion.
[55:51] Well, we'll know when we die.
[55:54] We'll we'll figure it all out in the
[55:55] afterlife to be continued in the next.
[56:00] And so in the way that storytelling
[56:02] ought to be conveying meaningful truth a
[56:05] and that it was useful because it it had
[56:08] it had meaning our lives should be fully
[56:12] committed that there should be something
[56:14] deliberate
[56:16] this commit to this deliberate process
[56:18] of cultivating virtue
[56:22] and storytelling is effective fascinates
[56:25] us. We're drawn to it. But Travis, this
[56:27] is your opportunity to amen. And you've
[56:28] been waiting for this for years now.
[56:30] Amen. There we go. He can amen that he's
[56:33] been waiting for it.
[56:36] But story is fascinates. There's a lot
[56:38] of different elements, but two of the
[56:39] most important elements are character
[56:41] and a plot.
[56:44] That in this this character who's
[56:47] central to the plot, they can't be
[56:49] separated.
[56:50] that the character from our vantage
[56:52] point we have to identify if you've read
[56:54] a book or you've watched a movie or
[56:55] series you always want to find who's the
[56:57] main character and so nowadays we have
[57:00] the main character syndrome where
[57:01] somebody shows up and they don't realize
[57:03] they're an NPC like hey you shouldn't be
[57:06] acting like you're the main character
[57:07] this is a bit part you immediately want
[57:09] to know who the main character is
[57:10] because you assume they can't kill them
[57:11] off they they can't be the antagonist
[57:14] they've got to be the hero and you see
[57:16] the arc and the and the hero's journey
[57:18] and all these different stories there's
[57:19] a character and there's a plot And
[57:21] what's central to that is the challenges
[57:23] and the decisions and how that person is
[57:26] changed through that process.
[57:31] Now
[57:32] man, I thought I was going to be short,
[57:34] but I will finish today.
[57:36] This was written by a professor of
[57:38] literature at Bethl College or at least
[57:39] at one time was in Minnesota and Daniel,
[57:42] his name is Daniel Taylor, and he writes
[57:44] this. I know this is a lengthy excerpt,
[57:46] but I couldn't figure out a way to
[57:48] present it. uh except just through this
[57:52] this lens of the way he says it.
[57:57] And again, I'm wanting us to realize
[57:59] we're in a wasteland and we want to
[58:00] redeem our time. We want to master time.
[58:04] How do we master time? How do we redeem
[58:05] time? How do we buy it? How do we use
[58:07] it?
[58:09] Only stories
[58:11] that recognize the inseparableness of
[58:13] plot and character matter to us in the
[58:15] long run. In other words, we want to
[58:18] identify with the person and the plot
[58:21] character. Now, I'm using this as a
[58:23] little bit of a play on words because
[58:24] what we're wanting to do is cultivate
[58:26] character.
[58:27] And so, I'm using this our character,
[58:30] but then using the story as a way of
[58:33] highlighting my point. Our stories that
[58:36] recognize the inseparableness of plot
[58:38] and character matter to us in the long
[58:39] run. What we call plot driven stories.
[58:42] Plot- driven, not character driven. So
[58:45] now there's the there's the play on
[58:46] words I'm wanting to use that if
[58:48] something's not characterdriven, it's
[58:50] just merely plot driven which focus on
[58:53] events rather than on characters
[58:54] choosing are always popular because
[58:57] they're always easy intellectually and
[58:59] emotionally. The reason why some of us
[59:02] love certain things is because we're
[59:04] never challenged by it. It's simply a
[59:06] plot. There's actually no choosing.
[59:08] There's no morality.
[59:10] They require little of us and we're lazy
[59:13] enough to appreciate that.
[59:16] But the habitual enjoyment of such
[59:18] stories is actually a form of
[59:20] prostitution.
[59:22] Offering monetary superficial pleasure
[59:24] without the cost of commitment or human
[59:27] interaction.
[59:37] Contemplate it. Think about it.
[59:41] I looked back and I thought I s saw a
[59:43] parent covering their child's ear, but
[59:44] they're just holding them because
[59:46] they're asleep. They're like,
[59:50] and then he continues, "The great sin of
[59:52] most of the stories of popular culture
[59:54] in film, television, novels, and the
[59:57] like, put whatever it is you want to put
[59:59] in there, is not that they're violent or
[1:00:02] obscene or godless,
[1:00:05] but that they waste our time.
[1:00:10] That changes everything. Now, I'm not
[1:00:12] just looking for the rating.
[1:00:15] We were in one place that we stayed when
[1:00:17] we were in Europe. It was not
[1:00:19] necessarily untasteful, but it was just
[1:00:20] kind of a line drawn and you could tell
[1:00:22] it was a figure of a woman. So, we put I
[1:00:24] put a a pillowcase over it. And Elliot
[1:00:26] walked in the room and he said, "You vid
[1:00:28] angelled the vid painting."
[1:00:30] And listen, there's only so much that
[1:00:32] gets filtered out. There's so many
[1:00:35] there's only so many bleeps where you
[1:00:36] know exactly what they're saying despite
[1:00:38] the bleep. The damage is done.
[1:00:40] And so we begin to therefore process the
[1:00:43] things we enjoy and the things we digest
[1:00:46] and the things we do from the standpoint
[1:00:48] of not whether or not it's violent,
[1:00:50] obscene, or godless, but is it just a
[1:00:53] waste of time?
[1:00:55] You say, "Well, you're just quoting some
[1:00:57] professor in Minnesota." Well, I agree
[1:00:59] with them. I'll just say that the great
[1:01:01] sin even as Paul identified it was
[1:01:04] waste.
[1:01:06] The evilness of the day, the wickedness
[1:01:08] of the day was waste.
[1:01:12] In second Timothy 4:es 3-4, for the time
[1:01:15] will come when they will not endure
[1:01:17] sound doctrine, but after their own lust
[1:01:20] shall they heap to themselves teachers
[1:01:22] having itching ears.
[1:01:24] I made the observation one time in my I
[1:01:26] thought well I think at one point church
[1:01:28] was entertainment.
[1:01:30] You work throughout the day and whenever
[1:01:31] the church bells rang like finally
[1:01:32] something different. Everybody ran to
[1:01:34] church and maybe it was some form of
[1:01:36] entertainment revival and visiting
[1:01:37] ministers hundreds of years ago that
[1:01:39] they gathered around that but it was
[1:01:41] wholesome virtuous entertainment. It
[1:01:44] wasn't a waste of time despite the
[1:01:45] singing and maybe the dancing and all
[1:01:47] the enjoyment and the eating. There was
[1:01:49] something being cultivated something
[1:01:50] virtuous in that. And now we're not just
[1:01:54] heaping to ourselves false teachers
[1:01:56] within the churches, though the churches
[1:01:57] themselves are guilty of this very
[1:01:59] thing. We are heaping to ourselves all
[1:02:01] sorts of writers, all sorts of content
[1:02:04] producers that itch our ears, and they
[1:02:06] shall turn away their ears from the
[1:02:08] church truth and shall be turned unto
[1:02:10] fables.
[1:02:14] What should be pointed out by this is
[1:02:16] the fables
[1:02:18] weren't so much fiction,
[1:02:20] but fiction without morality.
[1:02:23] fiction without truth. Do you realize
[1:02:26] there's fiction that within itself it
[1:02:27] can create its own framework of ethics
[1:02:30] that from it you can't necessarily
[1:02:32] extrapolate some virtue, some
[1:02:34] application to life. It is all
[1:02:37] entertainment. Now I'm now in saying
[1:02:39] this, I'm not saying anything that
[1:02:40] wastes your time is is sin and it's
[1:02:42] Lucifer and you're possessed with the
[1:02:43] devil. That's not what I'm saying. I'm
[1:02:45] just asking you to consider I'm wanting
[1:02:47] you to take a step back and start using
[1:02:50] s uh start using this lens to view
[1:02:52] things say wow there is a there is a
[1:02:54] need to cultivate
[1:02:57] and if all of our time is wasted in
[1:02:59] things that don't promote virtue that
[1:03:01] don't develop character we become
[1:03:02] virtuous
[1:03:04] we become more rubbish in the wasteland
[1:03:10] they heap to themselves teachers and
[1:03:12] they're turned to fables where there's
[1:03:14] no truth It's all immoral
[1:03:17] or amoral even trying to remove morality
[1:03:19] from it. Fables and some of those things
[1:03:22] that we Asop's fables and some of those
[1:03:23] things we enjoy and these old stories
[1:03:26] they shared a virtue.
[1:03:29] This story of this and this story of
[1:03:30] that and the three lions and the two
[1:03:32] donkeys or whatever it might be they
[1:03:34] taught us something about lying about
[1:03:35] honesty about discernment.
[1:03:38] even stories about the emperor's uh new
[1:03:40] clothes almost said new groove or that
[1:03:42] there's things we learned say hey
[1:03:44] there's something to be gained from this
[1:03:45] I can take even though it may have never
[1:03:47] existed it may have never happened but I
[1:03:49] can use contemplation I can be accosted
[1:03:53] by the image I can be challenged by the
[1:03:55] story and the narrative and ask myself
[1:03:56] where's virtue where's morality where's
[1:03:58] truth
[1:04:02] and this is part of the conclusion that
[1:04:04] I really want to drive home today
[1:04:06] brother Daniel Taylor says, "We
[1:04:08] foolishly settle for stories on the
[1:04:10] screen and on the stage which tickle us
[1:04:13] instead of demanding those which
[1:04:15] interrogate us."
[1:04:17] Likewise in our conversations and from
[1:04:19] our pulpits.
[1:04:21] Listen, church has become cliche.
[1:04:25] It's all it is.
[1:04:28] Settle for stories which tickle instead
[1:04:30] of those that challenge us and then our
[1:04:34] conversations become shallow. our
[1:04:36] churches become shallow. He says we use
[1:04:38] feeble stories to kill time when there
[1:04:41] are so many available that redeem the
[1:04:43] time.
[1:04:46] There are it's a challenge even within
[1:04:47] our own h household. What are things
[1:04:49] that we could promote? What are things
[1:04:51] we can allow that redeem the time
[1:04:54] instead of waste time? And it's not a
[1:04:57] matter of kick out all the books. That's
[1:04:58] what we might have said 300 years ago.
[1:05:01] a 100 years ago, burn all the magazines.
[1:05:04] And we said, kick out the television and
[1:05:06] now we're just all looking at our phones
[1:05:08] saying, you know, put a shotgun through
[1:05:09] it. It's like, well, how are we going to
[1:05:10] get a hold of how are we going to do
[1:05:12] this? How are we going to drive our cars
[1:05:13] now? We have to have a phone to drive a
[1:05:15] car.
[1:05:18] There's so many other things available
[1:05:20] to redeem the time.
[1:05:23] We must insist
[1:05:26] in a cynical age that there is such a
[1:05:29] thing as a good story.
[1:05:32] We should identify and prize the good
[1:05:34] stories from the past and we must
[1:05:37] fulfill our responsibility to tell new
[1:05:40] ones.
[1:05:43] As much as I would like to maybe just
[1:05:45] continue to amplify that and explore
[1:05:48] that
[1:05:49] we I believe that there are still good
[1:05:52] stories.
[1:05:54] We should identify and prize those good
[1:05:56] stories from the past. I was reading TS
[1:05:58] Elliott. He even wrote a a poem before
[1:06:02] his conversion to Christianity called
[1:06:03] Wasteland. And it's just it's chaotic.
[1:06:07] Uh but he's a very gifted, very talented
[1:06:09] writer in the in the dawn of the
[1:06:11] leodysian age. And he writes uh about uh
[1:06:14] the wasteland. But then he was asked one
[1:06:16] time he said that we should learn
[1:06:17] there's something to be gained from our
[1:06:19] past. And there was this response from
[1:06:20] these modernists, but we know more now.
[1:06:23] I want you to think about this even in
[1:06:25] our attitudes. We know more now. And
[1:06:26] there's a sense, well, we're more
[1:06:27] cultivated. We're more intellectual.
[1:06:29] We're more we're we're smarter now.
[1:06:31] We're not as biased. We're not as
[1:06:32] shallow. And there's this sense that we
[1:06:34] somehow evolved. But when you lose your
[1:06:36] connection with the virtue of the past,
[1:06:38] the character of the past, and they say,
[1:06:40] "Well, we know more now." But TS
[1:06:41] Elliott's response was, "But they're
[1:06:43] part of what you know."
[1:06:46] I'll say it this way. If you've embraced
[1:06:49] the message, if you've been taught these
[1:06:51] things and they become part of your
[1:06:53] character in your heart, to try to
[1:06:54] divorce it and act like you know more
[1:06:56] than it, there's a challenge to realize
[1:06:58] no, it's part of what you know. It's
[1:07:00] part of what's informed you. Amen. And
[1:07:04] so we should prize the virtue, the the
[1:07:06] the the promotion of virtue, the
[1:07:07] character, even the ideology that would
[1:07:09] look to promote virtue in the heart of a
[1:07:11] man from the past and then fulfill our
[1:07:13] responsibility not just to reverberate
[1:07:16] and echo the past, but to tell a new
[1:07:18] story
[1:07:19] that's virtuous, that's true.
[1:07:22] And I know that we can ex uh come away
[1:07:25] from things like this and say, "Well, I
[1:07:26] just need to develop a really strict and
[1:07:28] rigid system which can enforce what's
[1:07:30] right and what's wrong and filter out."
[1:07:33] So, there's a constant filtering process
[1:07:35] to where all we end up getting
[1:07:38] is those things that that are clean and
[1:07:41] neat and satisfying and that we know
[1:07:43] we're safe.
[1:07:44] But who wants safe?
[1:07:47] Do you realize that our body is ability
[1:07:50] to fight off diseases and infections is
[1:07:53] directly connected to its exposure to
[1:07:55] it?
[1:07:58] And that it would be much harder to try
[1:07:59] to live in a bubble where you never come
[1:08:01] across a germ than to know how to
[1:08:04] navigate your way through the germs
[1:08:07] and to be exposed to them and use your
[1:08:09] exposure to your strength.
[1:08:13] We could develop very strict rules on ah
[1:08:15] we're going to keep this out. We're
[1:08:16] going to do this, we're going to do
[1:08:17] that, and from now on, brother Aaron
[1:08:18] preached on redeeming the time and these
[1:08:19] things that are wasteful and a waste of
[1:08:21] our time. No more this or that.
[1:08:25] Or we could just simply
[1:08:27] concentrate on
[1:08:29] the external cosmetics.
[1:08:33] But what's most important is that we
[1:08:34] increase in wisdom and understanding
[1:08:38] that we're inspiring. inspire in
[1:08:40] inspiring. I'm Daniel Boone or
[1:08:42] something. All of a sudden, we're
[1:08:43] inspiring our hearts and our minds
[1:08:49] to form the right kind of character so
[1:08:51] that we can make the right kind of
[1:08:53] decisions of right and wrong. That we
[1:08:55] can go from better to best. That we're
[1:08:57] doing this ourselves as humans. We're
[1:09:00] doing this ourselves in our own lives
[1:09:01] where I'm wanting to take I want to be
[1:09:04] sure that I'm digesting things that
[1:09:06] promote virtue and that I'm wise enough
[1:09:09] to recognize when there's a binge that's
[1:09:11] taking place that it is solely for the
[1:09:14] purpose of wasting time. This is plot
[1:09:18] driven. This is entertainment driven.
[1:09:21] This is personality driven. This is this
[1:09:24] is mind driven.
[1:09:26] This is itchy ear driven driven. and
[1:09:29] recognize that a diet solely of that
[1:09:33] will turn you into a waste.
[1:09:36] Your spirituality, your wisdom, your
[1:09:38] discernment, your homes, you name it,
[1:09:39] it'll turn it into a wasteland.
[1:09:42] And therefore, what our mindset needs to
[1:09:44] be is not so much filtering out but
[1:09:47] adding in. It does to find a way to
[1:09:50] redeem that time, buy it, make use of
[1:09:52] it. Not just to simply choose those
[1:09:54] things that we can consume that simply
[1:09:56] waste our time and give us no additional
[1:09:58] benefit,
[1:10:00] but maybe even wrestle with and
[1:10:02] challenge ourselves with the things we
[1:10:03] consume
[1:10:05] so that we can promote virtue.
[1:10:09] If we can have the musicians come to
[1:10:11] their instruments.
[1:10:13] I want to just I want to end with this
[1:10:14] scripture because I think it just fits
[1:10:16] so beautifully in this. Arise, awake
[1:10:18] thou that sleepest and arise from the
[1:10:20] dead. Christ shall give thee light.
[1:10:22] Sing,
[1:10:24] rejoice,
[1:10:26] redeem the time, grow, rise up from the
[1:10:29] wasteland. He says, arise, shine, for
[1:10:31] thy light is come and the glory of the
[1:10:33] Lord is risen upon thee. For behold, the
[1:10:36] darkness shall cover the earth, and in
[1:10:38] gross darkness the people.
[1:10:43] In darkness there is either no life or
[1:10:46] very limited,
[1:10:49] narrow life,
[1:10:52] devoid of certain senses and abilities,
[1:10:56] restricted to whatever things could in a
[1:10:59] very meanial way nourish it. Where
[1:11:01] there's darkness, there's waste,
[1:11:04] unfruitfulness. But the Lord shall arise
[1:11:06] upon thee, and his glory shall be seen
[1:11:08] upon thee,
[1:11:10] and the Gentiles shall come to thy
[1:11:12] light,
[1:11:14] and kings to the brightness of thy
[1:11:16] rising.
[1:11:19] This spoken of the Messiah,
[1:11:22] spoken of Jesus Christ, is true of his
[1:11:24] wife today. You are his light.
[1:11:28] You are the one that's telling the new
[1:11:30] stories. Amen. You are the one that
[1:11:32] yourself, you are in your own life a
[1:11:34] character with its own plot. Plot is
[1:11:37] that what where does it where does it
[1:11:38] end up? What's the tension?
[1:11:41] And there might be a way that you could
[1:11:42] say, well, what's the plot? What's the
[1:11:44] synopsis here? What's the how does it
[1:11:46] end? Well, there's a lot of ways we
[1:11:47] could say, you know, you know where this
[1:11:50] is ending up. You look at yourself in
[1:11:52] that journey and realize I, as a person,
[1:11:54] I grow as I'm challenged and as I make
[1:11:56] decisions and when I've made the wrong
[1:11:59] one, I'm learning from it. And there's
[1:12:00] this development that takes place in my
[1:12:01] own story. So that one of the and this
[1:12:05] may be kind of I don't think I'm burying
[1:12:07] the lead here, but stories take time.
[1:12:10] That's why just looking at a painting,
[1:12:12] oh that that's that's nice. Doesn't do
[1:12:14] the trick. Took time to make that.
[1:12:18] There was a there was a journey. There
[1:12:20] was an inspiration. There's something
[1:12:21] being expressed and being told in that
[1:12:23] story. Stories take time. The story of
[1:12:26] your life is taking time.
[1:12:29] Therefore, I realize I want my life.
[1:12:31] Though you could take moments in my life
[1:12:33] and say, "Well, that's not a very good
[1:12:34] testimony or that." But where am I at in
[1:12:36] my journey? I know where it's going to
[1:12:38] end up.
[1:12:40] And I I want to I want my life to be
[1:12:44] something that's res rising up as a
[1:12:45] phoenix from this wasteland.
[1:12:48] And I want my light to gather.
[1:12:51] Want my light to shine. God, help us in
[1:12:54] this cynical age to find goodness, to
[1:12:56] promote the right things, and in this
[1:12:59] wasteland,
[1:13:00] be very careful what we're consuming.
[1:13:04] So, if there if there's no nothing to be
[1:13:06] learned from it, nothing to be gained
[1:13:08] from it, just know what it is and ask
[1:13:12] yourself, how does it make me feel after
[1:13:13] I eat it?
[1:13:15] Use some discernment. Let's stand
[1:13:17] together.
[1:13:22] God, help us in these things as we pray.
[1:13:25] Heavenly Father,
[1:13:27] Lord, there is a journey that we're on
[1:13:33] and in different stories that are told.
[1:13:35] There's a protagonist, an antagonist,
[1:13:38] there's a hero, there's a villain.
[1:13:43] And Lord, we are
[1:13:46] challenged to be careful who we make our
[1:13:50] heroes. Yes.
[1:13:52] [Music]
[1:13:55] Because in the end we could realize that
[1:13:58] their potential, their story,
[1:14:01] their testimony was a waste.
[1:14:04] That it never it never fulfilled
[1:14:08] what it ought to have.
[1:14:10] And Lord, we could just look at say,
[1:14:12] "Oh, what a what a pitiful waste. Can't
[1:14:14] believe I wasted all my time admiring
[1:14:16] that and looking at that." And instead
[1:14:18] of we ourselves being a victim of that
[1:14:19] fraud, could we ask ourselves,
[1:14:23] "What would you have me to learn, Lord?
[1:14:26] What is it I could take away from this
[1:14:30] diance,
[1:14:31] my own mistakes or my own wondering,
[1:14:34] Lord, where did they go wrong? Where
[1:14:35] have I gone wrong?" For Lord, I believe
[1:14:38] that there's never a bad time to just
[1:14:41] stop and ask, "What can I learn?" Yes.
[1:14:45] As the scripture asks us to submit
[1:14:46] ourselves one to another, I believe that
[1:14:48] we could constantly ask ourselves, "What
[1:14:50] can I learn from you? What can I learn
[1:14:52] from them? What can I learn in this
[1:14:53] situation?"
[1:14:56] It seems as if the longer we live, the
[1:14:58] less answers we have and the more
[1:15:00] questions we have.
[1:15:02] That we don't get it all figured out. We
[1:15:04] just become more dependent upon the one
[1:15:06] who knows all things.
[1:15:08] So Lord, I pray that
[1:15:13] you would give us grace to redeem the
[1:15:15] time, to buy the time, to gain the time,
[1:15:18] to make the proper use of our time.
[1:15:21] Amen. Lord, I know that we have leisure,
[1:15:24] we have recreation, and those may be in
[1:15:26] the forms of certain entertainments, and
[1:15:28] they they have a place
[1:15:31] even in a moral society. And when our
[1:15:34] country was dominated by Christianity,
[1:15:36] there was a there was a place for
[1:15:37] leisure and recreational activity.
[1:15:41] But Lord, those things only make sense
[1:15:45] in the light of labor, in the context of
[1:15:48] work.
[1:15:50] And if all of our our lives become
[1:15:52] dominated by leisure, by recreation, by
[1:15:54] entertainment, by content consumption,
[1:15:56] and we live our lives revolved around
[1:16:00] these wastes of time,
[1:16:03] something's wrong. We've become a
[1:16:05] servant to it.
[1:16:08] We've no we're no longer using and
[1:16:10] spending our time wisely.
[1:16:13] Lord, I want this sermon today to
[1:16:16] challenge
[1:16:17] all of us.
[1:16:20] For Lord, we have not come to church
[1:16:21] today for cliche. We have not come just
[1:16:24] to follow a plot-driven story, but we
[1:16:27] have character in mind. And unless
[1:16:30] there's a challenge and a choice,
[1:16:33] are we really cultivating our character?
[1:16:36] Bless us today. I pray as we're
[1:16:37] dismissed, go with us. be with uh
[1:16:41] brother Micah and Sister Maddie as they
[1:16:43] travel and enjoy some time away. The
[1:16:46] other families that are vacationing,
[1:16:47] we're just at that time of year where
[1:16:48] there's a lot of wisdom and getting out
[1:16:50] of here. But Lord, I pray that you bring
[1:16:52] them all back safely. Continue to help
[1:16:55] [Music]
[1:16:58] those that are sick and those that are
[1:16:59] hurting. Sister Esther on vacation in BC
[1:17:02] with Sister Sarah. Lord, may it be a
[1:17:04] time of renewal and healing.
[1:17:07] Lord, may sister Martin continue to
[1:17:08] heal. May there just be a a improvement
[1:17:14] day by day. We love you, Father. We
[1:17:16] commit ourselves to you. We do a
[1:17:18] re-evaluation today. We take to heart
[1:17:21] these things.
[1:17:23] Help us to understand this wasteland
[1:17:25] that we're in and our way through it. We
[1:17:27] love you. We ask this in the name of
[1:17:28] Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
