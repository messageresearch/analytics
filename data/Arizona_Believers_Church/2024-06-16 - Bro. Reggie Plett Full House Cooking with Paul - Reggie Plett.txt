TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I was thinking back brother Aaron had asked me to minister this morning on Father's Day and I thought didn't I Minister on Mother's Day and I thought no I didn't Minister on Mother's Day I I'd come up and I think I prayed I I think I opened the service in prayer on Mother's Day I just remember looking out and saying happy Mother's Day to the mothers on Mother's Day but I didn't I didn't Minister on Mother's Day in fact there was a target audience on Mother's Day if you all remember that target audience on Mother's day was the father's and I think that the Fathers as they got their scathing rebuke on on Mother's Day and and so many had written in complaints to the complaint department here at the church and they said we just can't wait for Mother's Day or for Father's Day we can't wait for Father's Day and I think brother Aaron thought and everybody was asking what's brother Aaron going to preach on Father's Day and brother Aaron had something real special in planned he said I'm not going to do it I'm going have brother rege do it and so as I went through each of your homes and I was looking on your calendars in your kitchens and I saw where all the money mothers had marked Father's Day and each one was holding their breath for this day this is Father's day and I didn't plan anything to for a scathing rebuke to all the mothers um instead this morning I'm going to be preaching on Full House cooking with Paul Corinthian home show it's a it's a mouthful it's a long title I I tried to condense it but this is the this is the most I had so many other so many other things to add to the title but I thought let's just stop there full house cooking with Paul Corinthian home show so I want to read you something for your homework for each of you that like to study the Bible and study the message of the hour for each of you your homework today or not today but whenever you'd like to to tackle this uh is the message Corinthians book of Correction so that's where I drew the inspiration for this sermon um was listening I'd listen to that to that tape Corinthians book of Correction and um been studying in Corinthians the book of Corinthians and just going through and and and um just examining my life just listening to Paul reading Paul listening to Paul well reading Paul and imagining I'm listening to them and so if you go home and you have time during the week those of you that go to work and you put your airpods in and you listen to these sermons uh Corinthians book of Corrections is a f fabulous sermon I would really highly recommend it I think it's very beautiful I think when it's all said and done and you listen to it and you take it in all of its light you'll be very blessed in it but in that sermon brother brandham starts off pretty early on and he says it's the only church talking about Corinthians the Corinthian Church it's the only church in all of the New Testament that seemingly that the leaders had such trouble with but Corinthians was always in trouble Paul when he come among them one had a tongue and one had a Psalm one had the feeling and a sensation and he was always having trouble with these Corinthians keeping them straight and I remember hearing this and I I I've heard this sermon many times and I remember hearing that and and and that sticking with me that brother brandom had said that the Corinthians they always were in trouble they they and and you can read it you can you can catch it when you're reading in in in the book of Corinthians you can catch it when you're reading it and I thought you know yeah and brother Brandon would would say you know we're we're living in a in a day of an another book of Ephesians and that Ephesians is the Joshua of the New Testament that Joshua's was just like Ephesians in the Old Testament Ephesians is that Josh Book of Joshua for the New Testament Church it's it's coming into the promised land and it's it's going through the promised land and looking at all of the uh of of the blessings that God has given the church so brother Brandon himself in this sermon right after that statement there he says you know they couldn't go deep the book of uh the Church of Corinthians they couldn't go into deep things like like the Ephesians or the Romans like the Ephesian or the Roman Church and so in my mind when you hear a statement like that you're always thinking well I want to be likened to the Ephesian Church church or I want to be likened unto the Roman Church I want to be known as being able to go into the deep things and and if somebody was to stop by our church and say y'all are just like the Church of Corinthians you you you may you maybe wouldn't invite him back and and if that picture comes across today y'all don't have to invite me back but I'm coming back now my title Full House cooking with Paul Corinthian home show uh for years when we were Landscaping uh and even doing the artificial grass how many here has ever been to um a home and garden show does everybody know what a home and garden show is so these home shows we we just call them home shows um but they're home and garden shows and we would always purchase a booth or multiple booths and they they you they sell you a space within a an arena and you as a company will set up a place within this Arena and there's many businesses represented in a home and garden show and theide idea is to improve their home or improve their Garden or improve their Landscaping of some sort the idea is that they can come to this show and there may be a a a company there that could help them they're they're looking for somebody to help them with something in their home um or or or their property or perhaps they can get some ideas they can draw some ideas from this home and garden show some draw some sort of inspiration for their homes and then uh many people are just looking for something to do on a weekend and so they'll go to a home and garden show cuz they're just wanting to kill time and so oh there's a home and garden show and so they'll stop into the Home and Garden Show and they'll Walk Through This Home and Garden Show and usually you come into this Arena and there's just a buzz there's there's people there's just this noise of people and and the the gates open and everybody begins to walk through the Home and Garden Show and there's booths on either either side as you're walking down and you you alternate aisles and you're walking down looking at each one and all the parents are looking for something for their home or for but they got to bring the children they got to bring the kids the kids got to come too um because it's just hey this is what we're going to do on this Saturday we're going to kill a Saturday and you're coming well the kids love it because they're looking for the booths that have the free candy they're looking for the booths that have got the miniature footballs or the miniature basketballs they're looking for the booth that's got the stress squeezers um that they can just fill the bag with just stuff they so they're just running to the booths and and and all the business professionals that are have paid money to set their Booth up they're trying to chase the children off as quick as they can so they don't eat all their candy before the weekend is up so they can offer it to the homeowners so that they'll hire them for years we signed up for Home and Garden shows as landscapers and the day or two days before the Home and Garden Show would start we would come in and then we would get a a slot that we could come and set our booth up now in our booth we would take meticulous time I mean uh the days hours just drawing off of payroll to set up a home show that you don't even know if you're going to make money on but it's worth the investment and so we would take landscape block that and and and we would take a and and drill a boulder and and and and create a water feature within our booth and we would design H A flower bed and we would fill it with flowers and Mulch and and we would put some artificial grass on the floor or a putting green so that all the men could could stop by our booth and they would putt on our green and hopefully they would order some artificial grass from us and and we would take all this time and we would we would look at our booth at the it's just beautiful this is just beautiful this this looks like something everybody would want in their yard and and and we're going to we're going to try to pull everybody into our booth and we want everybody signing up for a free estimate from us so that we can go and get work from them and for years we would do this and all these home shows that we would go to there'd be this one booth and it would just be lined with chairs like as like almost as many chairs are within this church just full of chairs and there'd be a a big portable uh like a a countertop on this and that there would be these loud speakers on the corners of that and I thought what is going on in that booth and and and and and while I'd be uh you know explaining to customers how it is that we do what we do and what we could do for them and for their yard and I'm thinking you know yes come to our booth for the Landscaping portion of this we want you in our booth we want to get you in our booth I can hear over the loudspeakers I can hear and I'm thinking why didn't I get a loudspeaker but I can hear the loudspeaker and I would look at all these empty chairs and then there'd be a signup sheet and then there wouldd be a a a booth that would say our first showing is at this time and then a couple hours later we're going to have another showing and then a couple hours later another showing and what was in that Booth but there was a man in a chef's hat and an apron and he would have himself this booth and he would and and the chairs would begin to fill up with people and and you had to you had to sign up early just so you could get a seat in this booth otherwise you're standing off to the side and watching or or move along you know you're going to get rushed along with the crowd and so you're wanting to seat at this Bo I'm think man why is it that people aren't lining up to come get a seat in my booth and I would see these people and they would fill this place up these chairs would just be full of people and there'd be a man in there and he' and he'd have this open bar and he would begin pulling out pots and pans and he and and he and he's talking in a microphone like ladies and gentlemen this is what it what sound like it's just muffled and I'm thinking it's a he has a terrible sound system and yet he's drawing a crowd and he begin and you'd say now for all of you that stick around today for all of you for all of you that don't fall asleep within this sermon essentially I mean essentially it's a a home show sermon for all of you that will stick around for the entire sermon at the end of this each of you is going to get yourself a free pairing knife that that's right a free pairing knife this knife is so sharp I'm going to show you it can cut Tomatoes like you've never seen tomatoes cut and this knife here it can just peel potatoes like you've never seen potatoes peeled and I don't know if you are each seeing this but if you'll stick around each of you we'll leave this place with a free pairing knife today if you'll just go ahead and stick around for the entire show I'm thinking pairing knives is what we're doing now and he'd say now you know I'm going to show you something and and and and while I'm pairing up this what we're going to do is you see this pan here this pan is a non-stick pan you've never seen a pan like this before in your life this pan here I'm going to get some butter in that pan I'm going to get that going and that pan there is going to be is going to be a lifechanger for all of you that like to cook this pan here is going to change your life nothing sticks to it cleaning is going to be so much easier but while I've got this pan going and it's simmering here and if y can smell that butter cooking and the potatoes that I've just shelv in that I'm going to get this pot this is a pot here this is not a pan this is a pot and in a pot we do something else and we're going to cook something else and I don't know I'm not a cook so you know if y'all are waiting for me to break something out I'm not going to but he's got these pots and these pans and and and really truly that's what he's selling he's selling he's selling pots and he's selling pans and or selling knives utensils that's what he's selling and I'm thinking there's no way people are coming here to buy pots and pans and and and knives I mean you can go you can go just about anywhere and get some pots and some pans and some paring not you can go online you get pot pan but it was it never failed just filled up with people every showing I'm thinking I've got a water feature like the thing the flowers the the fragrance the and they're just piling into this place and the thing that got to me was not the people that were going into the booth or coming out because only a few of them would leave with boxes of full of pans and pots but I would see people going into this booth with notepads with Note with notepads and and and and pin and I'm watching them as this presentation is going and I'm watching them scratch something down I'm watching them write something down and I'm thinking what what what are they watching what these this these are some of these are middle-aged people I'm seeing some middle-aged and and and maybe some older maybe our young people don't know what middle-aged is middle-aged is older than me by a long shot that I'm always chasing middle-aged and I'm thinking what are they writing in this notebook and they're leaving and they don't have pots and they don't have pans and they don't have knives but they've got a notebook with something written in this notebook and what I discovered after years of doing these home shows is that some of these people are signing up to come learn how to cook they're just looking for please give us a recipe to teach me how to cook a meal because you're going to find out at some point in life there are some people who cannot cook that never learned how to cook they never learned that there was somebody else who did that they didn't learn that and now they're at a place in their life where they're like I would like to learn how to cook a recipe and so they stop by this show and say just let me take the notes as to how to cook this recipe and then I've got one meal in my stash something that I can take home and so in my title as it's a full house cooking with Paul you get the Corinthian Home Show part of it but the cooking with Paul is because as Believers as as as as we read in this Bible and you'll read it in Corinthians you'll find Paul saying some of you think you're spiritual some claim to be prophets but he that thinks he's spiritual or or a prophet let him acknowledge the things that I write unto you are the things of God so Paul asserts a certain Authority right away that God speaks to Paul in a specific manner that Paul's not just uh Paul's not just anybody but that God speaks to Paul and has called Paul to something that is specific for Paul amen and and and and and the other disciples and apostles they they recognize that and they even Peter himself you'll find Peter saying hey you know you know Saul says some hard things but nevertheless they are the word of God the things that Paul says they're from God and so the reason that I say cooking with Paul is because as we imagine ourselves at a home show we're coming before God and we can't cook we're acknowledging I can't cook I'm helpless God I I want I want I want in but I need help and so as we are reading through our Bibles as we as Christians as we as some as people who who who are acknowledging that this is the Divine word of God that that men were inspired by the spirit of God to to write these things and that these aren't just words of encouragement that these are not just uh motiv good for a motivational speech that this is indeed God's thoughts pinned down and and and and and flavored with a a a a certain man's temperament and the inspiration that God can give men the way they're born the way they're made up God used certain men and he let them in their words it be his word but through their through their view he would let them pin these things or he would not let them but he would instruct them to write these things for us and for all believers and so we're recognizing that that we need guidance we need help that we're like showing up at a home show and we're saying we need help we need inspiration and who do we follow and we we are recognizing that that Paul who has written 2third of the New Testament is a key figure in helping us direct us toward Jesus Christ that we can we can read our New Testament and go wow Paul's got some some instructions in here that we need to follow that Paul is helping us and and and and no matter where you come from if you're a Greek if you're a Roman if you're a Jew if you're whatever your background is it seems that God is using Paul as an instrument to help each of us some of us like to lean towards the law some of us like Law and Order and we this is how we like it and Paul's going okay you need a balance and I'm going to help you if if you want that you go read Romans and Ro Romans I love Romans because Paul starts Romans with you know there's men who have have have left their affections for women for other men and women for women and and these are called Gentiles and they're Pagan they're awful and and the and the and the the converted Jew is going yeah Paul give it to him Paul he's like I've never even heard of such f is this and that's right Paul you tell those people those pagans yeah what do they know and Paul's like yeah and then and then you go that you go over to chapter two and he goes now now you that came out of the law you had the law and you couldn't keep that so you're as bad off or worse and the Gentiles are going ooh and then Chapter 3 of Romans you go chapter 3 and Paul's going so then we're all in the same boat so let's all start at Ground Zero here some of us like law and some of us like no law just hey I just hey I do as I feel and it's like yeah you need some balance and so either way Paul's going you need some balance and so we're we're acknowledging when we're reading uh Romans and Corinthians and Ephesians and that we're like okay hold just Buckle in buckle in okay so we're showing up now today at the Corinthian home show okay we're not in the Ephesian home show today we're at the Corinthian home show okay everybody on board all right we all showed up Corinthian home show here we go we need help we need help okay now in the church age book The sman Church age brother brandham says only one messenger for each age receives what the spirit has to say to that age and that one messenger is the messenger to the true church he speaks for God by Revelation to the churches both true and false we know that to be true yes so when he's speaking to the true church we're all saying amen and then when he's speaking to the false Church he's saying hey y'all want to be part of the true y'all better get in y'all better but he knows not all will so he's saying hey you know here's what what's going to happen but he speaks to both the message is then broadcast to all but though it is broadcast for all who come within range of the message everybody who can hear everybody that can can play a tape everybody that can hear the preaching of the Gospel they can all hear it but that message is received individually by only a certain qualified group in a certain way each individual of that group is one who has the ability to hear what the spirit is saying by way of the messenger amen so we read Paul and we're going that's the me that's God's messenger amen now there's times where we're saying it like amen like oh that hurt that hit me that got me you got me on that but we're saying amen so be it we're still saying so be it that God it hurts but God you know thy will be done not my will be done thy will be done those who here are not getting their own private Revelation that's right we're like but please I I pray God that I'm not nor is a group getting their Collective revelation right we're not all the you know right like you better everybody better say right on it's like come on this isn't a collective thing this is an individual walk with you and God but each person is hearing not just with their ear hearing and receiving what the messenger has already received from God woo praise God for that Paul alone had the full Revelation for his day as evidenced by his confrontation of the other apostles who admitted that Paul was the prophet Messenger to the Gentiles for that day in every age we have exactly the same pattern every Church age we see this we see this whether that's Paul irenius whether that's Martin Columba Luther Wesley we see God sent a messenger he stood out and and those that received that message they walked in that light called The Bride for that age in every age we have exactly the same pattern that is why the light comes through some god-given messenger in a certain area and then then from that messenger there spreads the light through the ministry of others who have been Faithfully taught oh praise God for that praise God that there are still men who are Faithfully taught by the way of that messenger but of course all those who go out don't always learn how necessary it is to speak only what the messenger has spoken we know that's just nature sorry we're not in the Sweet By and By yet we're still in the nasty now and now so in 1 Corinthians chapter 4 okay we're really emphasizing 1 Corinthians here today 1 Corinthians 4: 16 and 17 wherefore I beseech you be ye followers of me Paul says these exact words in chap 11 verse one Paul once again he he he he he repeats this be ye followers of me as I follow Christ so here he starts it in chapter 4 I beseech you be ye followers of me for this cause as your followers of me for this cause I've sent unto you Timothy timotheus who is my beloved Son and faithful in the Lord who shall bring you to a new revelation no shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in Christ as I teach everywhere in every church this is exactly what brother bandam just got finished saying that there is a messenger but from that messenger there are faithful men who are taught who have a call to say and spread the same message and that's how we hear of that's how we hear it a lot of times times you know you didn't go down to your local tape store and get yourself a tape and take it home sometimes it was somebody on a job site sometimes it was somebody at a coffee shop somewhere it was somebody so a friend of a friend you visited their home and then you heard about the word of God and you saw there was something different in their life and it drew your attention and you said what have they got I want that and then it all goes back to a source well let's go back to the source okay and and so here we all are and it's like why are you telling us we're all here now as we go through this cooking cooking slch Christian Life drama I want to real quickly go through the book of First Corinthians I wish that I could just grab a t ton of scriptures and we could just sit here and do this but in your own time go through the book of Corinthians if you download Alexander scorby on your audible it will take you an hour to listen to the whole book of First Corinthians so little subtitle here you are Christians now act like it or in cooking home show cooking terms you want to cook that's why you showed up with your notebook was not for the pots and the pans it was not for the night maybe you'll grab those maybe you'll buy them if they really impress you maybe you'll buy a box of pans and pots but really we've come here to learn how to cook and you've said in your heart I want to sign up because I want to cook and the reason that we've come into a building like this today is because something in our heart says I want to be a Christian the reason you you say Lord Jesus I Surrender my heart to you is because you want to be a Christian now just a little synopsis of this I just grabbed there's so much but in 1 Corinthians chapter 2 and: 12 it says now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God so remember in the beginning we said we read that quote brother brandom said the Corinthian Church was always having trouble Paul was always having trouble couldn't it was hard to keep them straight and we all said oh I'm not a Corinth I'm not like them I'm not like that that's not me I say I'm a young person and I'm going to be the greatest Christian that this world has ever seen I'm GNA change the world I'm GNA change the world when it comes to Christians ain't nobody's seen a Christian like I I'm a Christian and praise and and and and I'm not I'm not making light at that I like I think once you become a parent you're like yes child Let It Be You right like it's like they're like I dad I'm going to I can I'm going to run faster than you ever R and you're like please please do dad I'm going to be stronger than you ever work you're like please do please be stronger than me so you can start lifting the grill and everything in the groceries right like you're like I want my children to be better than I ever was okay but but but before you have children when you're young and you're single you're like you know you don't know anything about that you just know it's me it's it's me I'm going to be and it's like praise God I hope you are okay but Paul you know when we're when we're like really like all those Corinthians then you become then you live and once in a while you are looking at the stature of a perfect man and you're going Faith yes Faith got faith I you know got that one Faith virtue yeah knowledge Temperance godliness ah yeah brotherly kindness I think I got it I think I'm I'm right there I mean I'm right there at the Capstone and then all of a sudden somebody cuts you off in traffic and boop boop boop like you roll right down that pyramid and then and and by the time you're done with your screaming fit and traffic you're asking God do I even have faith like sure brotherly kindness is gone that one that one went right away but godliness oh that really okay virtue virtue being that that power to draw from that somebody can draw from you as that woman who touched the Garment of Jesus and it pulled virtue from him is having that kind of virtue and where is that where that's gone okay and you you're sitting there asking yourself in your closet or before your family am I even a Christian the day before on Sunday You're so quick it's so easy to tell the world we're the bride y'all over there your church ah but us and so before we start really pressing on the Corinthians we start realizing wait a second maybe this book of Corinthians was put in this Bible for me but Paul is acknowledging right off the bat Corinthians you're Christians amen you signed up God called you and God's done something in your life you are a Christian now let's act like it okay you came came here with your notepad to learn how to cook let's start cooking how about let's start and I get it you know the guys how can I I don't know if I can sit through the whole thing hearing a guy breathe like this okay but you can't cook let's get that straight I burn water I can Scorch a bowl of water I cannot not cook that's why I'm here amen God teach me how to be a Christian amen right so that's Paul he's starting the book of Corinthians some of you are saying I'm of Paul I'm of apus I'm of C he's like stop let's stop let's stop with that we're Christians na paans not apons we're Christians so let's start cooking so that takes you from chapters one to five of First Corinthians is you're Christians now let's start acting like it all right excuse me 1 to four now we go on to section number two a clean presentation or in cooking terms keep your workstation clean so this man who's up here and he's cutting up stuff to put to make in this dish okay he's teaching you he's saying hey this is going to be delicious we're going to add some onions some green onion is going to go into this that's going to give you a little bit of flavor and how about a little minced garlic huh that'll that'll be nice you're going to enjoy it I promise you're going to enjoy this we're going to cut up some garlic in this but this dish is not just onions and garlic we've got to have a protein today folks So today we're working with chicken so chicken let's get out the raw chicken and we put it on a cutting board and I'm cutting up the chicken you see this knife and you can even use your free pairing knife if you stick around and you don't fall asleep through the sermon you can use your pairing knife to cut up the chicken but we're cutting up the chicken we're going to put chicken in this dish but this is raw chicken and so we put the chicken here in the pan and we're going to add something but oh I just put raw chicken on that cutting board we don't want to put anything else on that before I clean it otherwise you might get sick and end up in a hospital this is like cooking 101 right and we're like scratching notes cuz I were like I didn't know that you know all the guys all the single Bachelors are like ah cut up raw chicken or raw whatever who cares it's all going into my belly and it's like no after you put cut raw chicken on the board you've got to clean that you'll get salmona so the chef 101 School says always keep your work area clean so we got to clean it you don't want a sick body you're learning how to cook here you don't want you don't want to be sick and you don't want to make anybody else sick who comes to visit you right you want them to enjoy your meal and then you can go to the next Ephesian home show and learn to cook a second meal from that Chef selling whatever he's selling right is everybody getting starting to get this picture we've got to keep this clean so let's let's let's go over in 1 Corinthians chapter 6 I'm just again I just grabbed one verse but it should give you a good idea chapter 6 and verse 11 it says and okay I'm going to start back at verse 9 know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God be not deceived neither fornicators nor idolators nor adulterers nor effeminate nor abusers of themselves with mankind nor thieves nor Covetous nor drunkards nor revilers nor extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of God and we're like yeah that's right go get them and Paul says and such were some of you but you are washed but you are Sanctified but you are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the spirit of our God he's still in the washing business he's still in the I don't care how long you've been cooking I don't care how long you've been doing it he's still in the cleaning business he can still wash you even though you've been walking this way a long way you say God I still I I messed up I feel filthy I accidentally let the raw chicken touch this that's okay God can purify he's got he's got meal uh that he can put in the to get the poison out of the pot he's got that meal and that meal is Christ and if you put that meal in that pot it'll pull the poison out and you could be clean and keep right on walking so Paul through this chapters 5 through 11 Paul is saying okay Corinthian Church you've decided you want to be Christians but y'all be dirty cooking nasty like what are you doing he says I I hear that there's somebody in your church who's living with his stepdad's wife or his dad's step you know your stepmom what and and it's it's like yeah we get it the world does those things but you're all calling yourselves Christians and you're doing that that's not what Christians do if you were to say well I'm not a Christian okay well then we wouldn't expect anything different from you I mean the world does some Wild Things awful sick disgusting things but as CHR as a somebody who says I claim the name of Christ over me I'm no longer my own I'm his and you're still doing that no no no no no no no Paul says I'm not even with you and I've already judged this situation so here's how we're going to clean that up here's how we're going to clean it Paul doesn't just say oh y'all are filthy I'm out of here figure out this I'm leaving this home show it's like no you no Paul says let's go through this why to keep the body clean okay so he he uh in in in chapter 6 when you get to verse 18 He says flee fornication every sin that a man doeth is without the body but he that committeth fornication sinth against his own body there's all kinds of things that you can do they don't affect you it affects somebody else but fornication Paul's saying you're it affects you you're heavily involved and not only just literally but the it affects the body of Christ when you are claiming not to be a part of Arizona Believers Church but the body of Christ and so Paul's saying let's keep it clean when you get over to chapter chapter nine at the end Paul says but I keep under my body and bring it into subjection lest that by any means when I have preached to others I myself should be a Castaway now that Castaway in my scull field is is which is disapproved but in another translation is also disqualified so Paul's saying there are things that within the ministry within being able to preach that you will disqualify a man from being able to do that and and so Paul's saying I have to keep myself under subjection so that I'm not dis not that I would lose my salvation but I'd be dis I'd be disqualified so Paul is walking us through in these chapters 5 through 11 Paul is walking us through Corinthian Church you can be clean keep this because it's not about you and it's not about your local church it's about the body of Christ it's about being part of that big body and we want to keep it clean so then we move on to the next section of cooking better than being gifted or in cooking terms because I love him now in 1 Corinthians chapter 12 I the reason I I put these verses 12 31-13 is because I don't know who split up the chapters when they split up the chapters in The Bible I'm not sure who did that but it I never like to just when I'm reading through uh 1 Corinthians chapter 12 I don't like to stop at 12:31 because it just seems to blend right into 13 it so perfectly and I'll and I'll show you what I mean cuz I'm going to read it for you it says uh in in in in chapter 31 a little bit higher um you know Paul's saying um there there's gifts tongues interpretations prophecy healing all these things that are within the body there's gifts that God has put within this big body of Christ he says but are all prophets do all speak with tongues do all interpret no no not all do and so Paul ends here and he says but covet earnestly the best gifts and yet show I you a more excellent way though I speak with the tongues of men and angels and have not charity I'm become a sounding brass or tinkling symbol and though I have the gift of Prophecy and understand all Mysteries and all knowledge and though I have all Faith so that I could remove mountains and have not charity I'm nothing and though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor and though I give my body to be burned and have not charity it profiteth me nothing so Paul when you take those two chapters and you put them together rather than just cutting off 12 and then new subject it's not it's not a new subject it's Paul's just continuing that subject that listen having being gifted is is great you know some of you then that would be like the guy at the show saying I don't even know why some of you all are here at here you know like you've got a gift of cooking you know you could do it but we're all acknowledging and saying I can't cook I tried it like can I mix things yeah and sometimes that's awful you know like you know I'm put some I'm put some chicken liers in my you know in my Frosted Flakes this morning you're like you're like I'm good at mixing food it's like no yeah you can mix but you don't okay so you're like but I'm really gifted at being able to mix it's like look as Christians we come into this body and we say God I don't know what I have to offer you but just take take it and use it how you would like I mean this is the life of Jesus right is is look I don't do anything until my father shows me you know and and and and then we see him in the garden overcoming saying not my will Lord thine be done and though he could have called 10,000 angels to pull him from that cross he didn't he didn't do it he subjected himself and so then we take that example we look into that example and we say you know but but suddenly somebody enters into this body of Christ and we go wow you can sing or wow like you you're sure good at organizing events or you're sure good at what whatever it is I'm I'm I'm simply throwing things out there and it's not like I sure it's like well God if that's what you would so desire to use so be it but if you never used it one thing's for sure I want to love you I want to be pleasing to you whether I use a gift or never use the gift I've never you know offered that opportunity God I love you and so the idea behind this I want to learn how to cook so that everybody can see my pairing knife skills that everybody is going to receive at the end of this sermon if you'll just stay awake it's not to so that you can show off your knife skills that you learned at the home show why did you come to learn how to cook because probably there's somebody in your mind perhaps that person is going home to somebody who said I'm tired of microwave dinners every night I'm tired of spending so much money going to the restaurant every meal and the person said you know what I love you and I want to learn how to cook so that I can be pleasing to you because there's somebody you love I want to learn how to do this because there's somebody that I'd love to help and in our case you know Paul here whether he's saying uh you know if I don't have charity for others or whether it's go charity toward God the idea is that having love it starts with God our love for God for sure but then it goes out so this chapters 12- 14 we see Paul really going over when you do something let the motive be for love let's let that be our motive finally in chapter 15 why what for the idea is forever full but in chapter 15 and verse 14 it says this and if Christ be not risen then is our preaching in vain and your faith is also vain Paul takes chapter 15 of 1 Corinthians and he says if if Jesus came to Earth and was was just a man it was not deity it was a man and he duped everybody he he fooled everyone and we're all following a lie then we're in trouble but Paul is saying Christ was not just a man not just a teacher this was God in flesh and not only did he die to fulfill that atonement for the the the for for our sins for our sickness but he rose again he rose again he's alive he didn't remain Dead He's Alive and he sent back that life within us within us so that the very life that was in Christ that very example of Christ will come right out of you it's not a oh I hope I can I hope I can I hope I can no no no no if that life is within you it manifest that's what brother brandom says a sheep does not manufacture wool it Bears wool and so when that life comes within you all of a sudden you start bearing fruit that you did on your own you could never bear that before you didn't know how to do so the the Paul is saying there is that not only did he die not only did he resurrect but he's coming back he you he's coming back for believers and that there's a place that he's prepared and that there 's a place we're all going to go to and that when this world is over there is a place where no more Sorrows no no more of this that's the thing that we're looking forward to that's the thing that drives a Believer forward is because we're we're we're not looking back and saying well that was nice and that was awesome and oh if I could have lived in the days it's no no no no no he's still alive now and there's something awaiting for us there's something that presses us forward cuz we know this thing ain't finished yet it's not over that one day that we're going to those that are alive and remain are going to be changed those that have died in Christ are going to be resurrected we're going to be together for all the rest of Eternity and that we're going to be in a place to where there's no more suffering there's no more sorrow there's no more hungering that will be forever full that forever we will be full of the of of peace and love and joy there'll be no more sin to tempt there'll be no more of that that day we're looking forward to that that you're not doing these things in vains Corinthians that I'm not asking you to Walk This Way that we're not talking about this is how to cook just because that there's a purpose for it there's a purpose for living this there is something that that that that that counts right now that it it matters in your life but yet it's going to matter for for not only for you for your children for your friends for your colleagues for those you come in contact with until we get out of here now as I'm listening to Corinthians book of Correction comes right down to the end and brother brandom he's he's saying now we're about to have some Revival meetings and so that's why I'm preaching this service and you'll hear him say this in many when when he's starting out a weekend of meetings because and he's asking you know how many would like a prayer line and you can just tell there must be just to all hands and he's going okay all right we're going to make sure then that we pray for the sick that we're going to make sure that there's a healing that there's a line and if God would would come and heal then we're going to believe that and and and of course people were very much drawn for the healing there I mean there's people that are pulling people right out of hospitals they don't know no nothing about the message they don't know nothing about brother Brandon they don't know about the Bible necessarily they're just in a bed that they may die but their family knows about this healing Revival and so they're bringing them to the meetings whether they know about it or not and so brother brandom many of times you'll hear him start these meetings and he says okay but before before I do uh preach for a a healing service let's start with the soul and make sure the soul is right first because if you get healed in this meeting you're going to get sick again if you live long enough you'll probably get sick again in your life good chance right so so then you're going to look back at these meetings and go well I was healed there and that's the Pinnacle it's like no no no no no but I'm saying let you're getting the cart before the horse let's deal with the soul first if the soul is taken care of whether you're healed or you're sick every day of the rest of your life it won't matter you've got eternity waiting right and so brother B says now we're going to have some re re that's why he's preaching this Corinthians book of Corrections cuz he's starting with okay let's start let's get this part right first and he gets to this part and it just hit me just a real oh right in the bullseye brother bam says and now just think of yourself fooling with the world and tangling with the world and get down on your knees say oh Lord Jesus I love you you it's a burning Judas hypocrite kiss that's right think of these things there's a Revival coming up now see oh you might have the wedding ring on that's right but you're not a wife oh you might be a woman you might be the lady of the house but you're not a wife if you act like that so I stopped there because brother brandom had juste previously said men imagine if you get home from work and your wife wraps her arm around you and says oh darling but you knew you somehow knew that she was unfaithful and with another man and then you got home and she came home and she said that to you how would you really feel about that and obviously the idea is for not not how would you how would the wife feel if the husband did the same thing the idea is as Believers if if we're if we say I'm a Christian and we're still fooling with the things of the world it's a burn and then we tell Jesus I love you Lord It's a burning Judas hypocrite kiss this is where the rubber meets the road and I think oh God I I want to be likened unto the Ephesians Romans but if I can't apply this what good would it do me to go into the deep things and all of that brother Bram goes right on he says without this this is just right paragraph right up paragraph So I didn't I didn't skip anything here I don't care if my wife couldn't never comb her hair or if she didn't wear a pretty dress or never there she'd be my sweetheart I admire her because her loyalty her virtue what she is that's what she is and by a Christian men and women that's what we are in the sight of God it's not because that we can go to the best church or we can dress best or we can get in this neighborhood or we can do this or we can ride in this or we can do this that that doesn't have one thing to do with it it's the virtue of our loyalty and our love to Christ and that's the birth that's the thing that comes and I just it's like I heard that on tape when I heard him say you may have the wedding ring on but that don't mean you're a wife and and and all it could think was me you know this I believe I believe I'm a part brother BR said if you if there's one that's going to make it you believe you're that one right so I I say oh God I I want to believe I'm that one that I that if there's if you've got a little bride I'm a part of that I'm a part of that bride but don't let me just go around flaunting I got the ring on I got the ring on if I'm acting in a way that's displeasing to him the whole reason that I want that name Christian and not PL because I want to be identified with Christ because I love him it's him that I love we can get us together we can like each other and we can even say I really love you but there could be some things where like yeah but that gets under my skin a little bit that's fine but I want to be a Christian if I get under your skin I still would want you to say you're my brother I I don't love you because because of your red hair I don't love you brother regge because of that it's it's because of you're a Christian yes I seek Christ and as Believers as as human beings that's that's what we want for everybody is is be a Christian I want you to be a Christian you the benefits I mean why even talk about the benefits but there are benefits and and this this being able to cook with Paul that that that we're not just like well Paul could well Paul could no it's to be able to cook with Paul it's like when Paul's going through this we're like amen yes yes amen that's true and and and I'm closing with this and that was that was the last of my notes so you know we're about to get out of here within an hour I said Corinthian homes show but not a home show Corinthian homes show they show the the talk all the you know well I've got G yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah that's great that's great but but your homes they show your home life it shows I mean put the suit on all you want put the whatever you want on Sunday you come here but your home life shows it will come out I heard a man I don't know if he claims to be a Christian or not he's a doctor he's psychologist and he's always talking about the Bible and he's always sharing things about the Bible and so everybody asks him are you a Christian or do you believe in God that's the question do you believe in God and he said you know I don't like that question I don't like being asked that question and they're like well please proceed explain because you're sure talking about the Bible a lot and and and a man ought to follow the the example of Christ and so on and so forth so do you believe in God he said I don't like the question I don't like to be asked that question they said why not he said because if a person really believed in God then their life would live out the expression that they believed it and he said I don't know if my life bears that out and I thought oh my so close right I mean just woo just like coming right to it and if if we all took this idea that you know are you a Christian say hey we're Christians in this church I say are you a Christian and you're like well yeah and I thought about that so much because I thought that's true that man who who who Who's who knows nothing about the light of this hour that man has said a a word that is truth that if I really did believe in God my life would Express that and so okay I take that expression I think oh well brother rej do you believe in God and so then you really start soul searching and you get into the word and you start reading in Corinthians and then go ahead jump on over into Ephesians Romans jump on over and Paul is taking us and saying come on look we're in this together I'm not if there's not like a ha like a gotcha moment Paul's not waiting for a gotcha moment like I as the messenger we're going to do this together and then at some point I'm going to catch you that's not what Paul's doing Paul's saying I'm a I'm a Christian are you a Christian say I'm a Christian let's go together so we're going together and and Paul's begins expressing you know God showed me this and you're like whoa he never showed me that and it's like yeah I know but look this building's not cut out of all the same shapes so don't don't worry about it you're a Christian I'm a Christian let's go together so we're going together and Paul and you start to learn not that well I don't know if I know that I don't know if I believe it's like that's all right let's keep going together we're Christians right right let's keep going together it's like well I don't know if I'm doing that okay that's okay that's okay as you're going God will reveal himself as you're walking I'm going to walk in the light as he is in the light we one step at a time can you know the man that came to brother Brandon and I don't know if I believe in faith and he goes well how are you getting home he goes what buy my Lantern he goes well where's your home he goes it's over there he goes how do you know that he's like how do you know you're going to get there he goes well I take the Lantern and as I'm walking I'm walk he's like exactly exactly we're taking the light of the word and we as as people who are saying God I can't cook help me help me learn how to cook cook he's saying walk with me and as I show you let's go together let's walk in this it's not dependent upon what you can do it's what he's doing through you it's what he is is pulling right out of you and it's so beautiful it's so wonderful our homes will sh it that's what I want as brother brother Aaron has been preaching on the house of the Lord I'm thinking the whole time God help me to apply this in my home with my children with my wife and then in this church and then in the community and so on and so forth as it goes out God let me be faithful in the little things so that when the great things come I'm still faithful yes l in those things let's cook with Paul or with brother Bram let's cook with each other let's cook cook with Peter let's cook let's let's cook with James let's cook with these men we we'll learn how to cook together as we're walking as Christians and it will show in our homes amen let's Stand Together
