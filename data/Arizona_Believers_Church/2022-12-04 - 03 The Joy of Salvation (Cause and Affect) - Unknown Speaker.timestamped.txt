[0:02] the this is uh part three in the on the
[0:05] subject of the joy of Salvation we're
[0:07] looking at subject of Joy subject of
[0:10] Salvation I'm wanting myself personally
[0:14] um have been looking at and studying and
[0:15] just waiting for the Lord to find the
[0:17] right place to drop it in there but some
[0:19] of the things that are relevant to us at
[0:20] the end time the bride's salvation the
[0:22] Salvation that's even promised at to the
[0:24] elect in the end and it has
[0:27] um a lot of emphasis on Christ coming
[0:29] and even these themes of Christmas so uh
[0:32] this season this time of year we want to
[0:33] put our focus on the things of Christ
[0:35] and really focus intently on even what
[0:38] his coming means to us so there's some
[0:40] of that connection there but today I'm
[0:42] going to take the title of cause and
[0:44] effect and not effect but cause and
[0:48] effect and we'll hopefully amplify a
[0:50] little bit of a word play there for you
[0:52] and I hope that it'll kind of have a
[0:54] some emphasis even in the same way that
[0:56] we dealt with first principle last
[0:59] Sunday and we first begin to establish
[1:01] in that first first principles and so
[1:03] that's where I'll start is just by
[1:04] reviewing a few things on first
[1:06] principles I've appreciated the feedback
[1:08] and fellowship on this subject it is
[1:10] very really a neat tool to use to begin
[1:12] to look at things and stimulate some
[1:15] thought a lot of truth that's contained
[1:16] in it and when we looked at first
[1:18] principles it's the primary cause of
[1:21] something or the basic elements of
[1:23] something and when we talk about first
[1:25] principles we were using it in a sense
[1:26] of really understanding the fundamentals
[1:28] of something or what makes something
[1:30] what it is when you think first
[1:32] principles this is what distinguishes it
[1:34] when you distill it all down and you get
[1:36] to the root of it this is what it is and
[1:37] you begin to build from there
[1:39] and Paul uses this in Hebrews chapter 5
[1:43] verse 12. it says for when the time you
[1:45] ought to be teachers you have need that
[1:47] one teach you again which be the first
[1:50] principles of the Oracles of God and
[1:51] there become such as have need of milk
[1:54] and not strong meat so that Paul is
[1:56] expressing disappointment uh these this
[1:58] is an observation that he has made about
[2:00] the people when they ought to themselves
[2:02] be teaching things because they
[2:04] understand the fundamentals they have a
[2:06] concept of the building blocks they know
[2:07] what these pieces are they know how they
[2:09] work they know how to use them and so
[2:11] when they ought to be the ones that are
[2:13] instructing they need to be taught again
[2:14] even the fundamentals and the
[2:17] foundational things and they need milk
[2:19] and they can't handle strong meat so
[2:21] it's speaking to maturity they're
[2:23] unskillful they haven't really grasped
[2:25] the things that they needed to grasp in
[2:27] order to go further and so this phrase
[2:30] first principles of the Oracles of God
[2:32] we could amplify Oracles of God but we
[2:34] can just even say that that's a
[2:36] summation of the word of God and even
[2:37] the fundamental elements of their their
[2:39] law that they held so closely to but the
[2:42] first principles of the beginning
[2:43] elements it's the first thing from which
[2:46] a series of things arises so you go back
[2:48] to the the primary cause of the the
[2:51] initiator the beginner so it's the first
[2:53] thing from which a series of things
[2:54] arise or it's the basic elements from
[2:57] which a hole is composed so you say oh
[3:00] well that's a that's a boat well what is
[3:02] it made out of is it a wooden boat
[3:04] what's at its core what are its basic
[3:06] elements and we could use even the
[3:08] example of the letters of the alphabet
[3:10] are the building blocks that form
[3:12] language and and that that produce
[3:14] speech and so that's what first
[3:16] principles are and Paul in Hebrews
[3:19] chapter 5 is saying because uh you don't
[3:21] know the first principles as you ought
[3:24] to you're being held back from being
[3:26] skillful with the word of God you're
[3:28] being held back in terms of better
[3:31] understanding the nature of God his will
[3:33] and his design and so it it is I believe
[3:37] he's directly saying that if they had
[3:39] the first principles down if they had
[3:41] them established if they really
[3:42] understood the first principles then
[3:44] they could understand the deeper things
[3:46] that when he begins to deal more with
[3:48] Christ after the order of Melchizedek he
[3:50] could say things and since they
[3:52] understood the first principles they'd
[3:53] be able to place it right like oh I I
[3:56] see more clearly now but without that
[3:58] Foundation you can get all weird with
[4:00] your types and your shadows and all
[4:02] excited about language and numbers and
[4:04] and things from the law and things from
[4:07] this he's saying this just isn't a show
[4:08] this isn't just to tickle your ears you
[4:11] really need to have the fundamentals
[4:12] down you have to have the basics down so
[4:14] that you can really understand these
[4:16] deeper things and grow and build into
[4:18] this stature and into this beautiful
[4:20] picture so he's saying if you could
[4:22] understand the first principles you
[4:24] could understand the deeper things of
[4:26] God
[4:27] and when we take this uh title The Joy
[4:30] of Salvation we could even present it
[4:31] this way do we understand the first
[4:33] principles of salvation
[4:35] now I said do you understand it I'm not
[4:37] implying you don't have it in terms of
[4:39] Salvation I'm not saying that uh you
[4:41] know we need to all check ourselves
[4:42] because we're all just a bunch of
[4:43] unregenerate uh not born again uh
[4:46] Pretenders here no it's not it at all
[4:48] but do you understand what you have
[4:50] do you understand what you possess is
[4:52] there do you even do you understand the
[4:54] first principles of joy is there a
[4:56] deeper understanding of when the Bible
[4:58] if if some of you have done this and I
[5:00] know sometimes some of you I kind of
[5:01] take the cue that if there's a
[5:03] particular subject we're ministering on
[5:04] you dive into it yourselves and my
[5:06] goodness you can't you can't hardly uh
[5:09] turn a page in the Bible without coming
[5:10] across joy and they're so so often
[5:13] mentioned in the bible so do we
[5:15] understand Joy do we understand these
[5:17] building blocks these first principles
[5:19] of Salvation and joy such that they're
[5:21] they're they they form the letters of a
[5:23] new language where we're speaking a new
[5:25] language to wear themselves they become
[5:27] the building blocks of of a whole of
[5:29] something that's being built up in us do
[5:31] we know how to use them and so that's
[5:33] that's uh kind of the the preface to to
[5:36] see what the things we're trying to be
[5:38] challenged with and I would say as we
[5:40] said before that we're looking at this
[5:42] together that together we're looking at
[5:43] a subject and we're wanting the word to
[5:45] speak to our hearts this is in no way me
[5:47] trying to take something to say see this
[5:49] see here uh in order to expose something
[5:52] but we're looking at something together
[5:53] in order to understand more
[5:56] now I've broken this up for myself just
[5:58] to be able to put some building blocks
[6:01] out there to the sermon and so I want to
[6:03] First Look at Joy we're going to examine
[6:05] Joy a little bit deeper today look look
[6:07] at Joy's just merely a human emotion so
[6:10] we have this understanding of what Joy
[6:11] is a happiness or pleasure and how that
[6:14] they can have a joy that's just merely
[6:16] human emotion and by that I mean it's
[6:18] it's merely instigated by human things
[6:20] human experiences human perception and
[6:23] and our senses and so joy as a noun is
[6:26] defined as a human emotion or feeling of
[6:28] great pleasure and happiness so when you
[6:30] have joy it's great pleasure happiness
[6:31] that's what Joy signifies I have joy
[6:34] great pleasure and happiness if you Joy
[6:36] as a verb it means to rejoice and so
[6:39] that's what when you think of rejoice
[6:40] and rejoicing in all the places that the
[6:42] Bible speaks of rejoicing it's connected
[6:46] with joy it's the expression of this
[6:48] great pleasure and this happiness and so
[6:51] Joy is a human emotion
[6:53] that's evoked by our feeling well by
[6:56] success or good fortune or even the
[6:58] anticipation of something good the
[7:01] prospect of something good or oh I'm
[7:02] excited about this or I have a lot of
[7:04] Joy because Christmas is coming coming
[7:06] whatever it might be these are all human
[7:08] emotions and we looked at this uh in
[7:11] great detail as a church in the past and
[7:14] um in my I I'm finding myself maybe
[7:18] drawn back to some subject to a minister
[7:20] and we subministered last year on a
[7:21] theme of pure joy there's a lot of
[7:23] things in there you could go back and
[7:24] revisit
[7:26] um I even feel that there should not be
[7:27] any fear on my part just to go back and
[7:29] completely re-preach some things that
[7:30] we've ministered the last couple years
[7:32] because we're almost an entirely
[7:34] different body as we've grown and it's
[7:37] not like we just preached from the Bible
[7:38] once and then put that up right so
[7:40] there's just so much to explore as long
[7:42] as it's the word and not my opinions
[7:44] it'll stay fresh my opinions will get
[7:46] stale real quick and what you what you
[7:48] want is the word it's always fresh
[7:51] and so is human emotions are these
[7:54] conscious experiences that we have
[7:55] characterized either by some you know
[7:58] there's got to be some mental activity
[7:59] there and it can be pleasure or
[8:01] displeasure so there's this range of
[8:03] emotions and there's this mental
[8:04] activity that uh you you you this
[8:07] conscious experience of Happiness a
[8:09] conscious experience of sadness those
[8:10] are all emotions and emotions are always
[8:13] present with us
[8:14] brother randomly lewds too I mean if it
[8:16] doesn't have emotions it's dead you know
[8:18] so there's there's got to be this
[8:19] emotional component to our existence we
[8:22] are creatures of emotion the creatures
[8:24] of passion we're creatures of sentiment
[8:26] and affections it it just it's just who
[8:28] we are and sometimes one of the biggest
[8:30] dangers we could make is saying so many
[8:33] nasty things about emotions uh um that
[8:36] we almost begin to think oh you know I
[8:38] don't want to feel it you know I don't
[8:40] want to be I don't want to have this I
[8:41] don't want to have that and we could
[8:43] really degrade emotions to the point to
[8:45] where we're stigmatized by them or we're
[8:48] we have a complex about them but really
[8:49] what we want is we want to have emotions
[8:52] but we want emotional Harmony where
[8:54] they're in line with the word of God
[8:55] subject to the things of God and at the
[8:58] end of the day ins you know in
[9:00] controlled by the spirit of God
[9:03] did you find a lot of the fruits of the
[9:04] spirit as we'll touch on these are
[9:06] manifested in the emotional Realm
[9:09] and so when it comes to Joy we can have
[9:12] these joyful experiences this feeling of
[9:15] great pleasure or happiness that uh or
[9:18] we could have experiences that give us
[9:20] that great pleasure and happiness and
[9:22] they can be temporal moments of
[9:24] Happiness moments of joy and so there's
[9:26] these an experience with some emotional
[9:29] Dynamic and it's Joy rejoice in
[9:31] happiness and when we say that it's in
[9:34] this joy as a human emotion it can be
[9:36] just connected with anything but in the
[9:38] Bible in second Thessalonians chapter 2
[9:40] verse 12 it speaks of those who have
[9:41] pleasures and pleasure and
[9:43] unrighteousness that means they enjoyed
[9:46] and had fun and derived great
[9:48] satisfaction from unrighteousness and so
[9:52] you could take from this that there was
[9:54] Joy just by definition just by making a
[9:56] word connection that this was joy in
[9:59] unrighteousness and that would be a
[10:01] human emotion but from the wrong thing
[10:03] the wrong kind of Joy because it is
[10:06] inspired by caused by the wrong thing
[10:09] Paul visits it again in the last days he
[10:11] said that there'll be lovers of
[10:13] Pleasures in second Timothy 3 4. it's
[10:16] that hedonistic way of living love
[10:17] lovers of Pleasures even the word there
[10:19] is Hedonism basically and it's that joy
[10:22] that comes from satisfying human desires
[10:24] by fulfilling the lust of the Flesh and
[10:27] where if someone is hedonistic they live
[10:29] their life uh wanting pursuing Joy toy
[10:32] itself in other words they're finding
[10:34] things that make them happy find them
[10:36] things that satisfy the flesh that
[10:39] um they have pleasure and pleasure
[10:41] so and I think as you can begin to think
[10:44] deeply about this that there that's that
[10:46] slippery slope so I want joy I want joy
[10:49] joy joy and then you make Joy the object
[10:51] so then there's this realm where Joy is
[10:53] the object and you're doing things just
[10:55] to experience Joy so Joy's the pursuit
[10:58] not even the product
[11:00] necessarily it is the pro it's what you
[11:04] are pursuing ultimately and that's the
[11:05] hedonistic way of living where they love
[11:08] the pleasures of the Flesh and that's
[11:09] what they wanted to be sensitized by and
[11:12] as we're looking at Joy is merely human
[11:14] emotion that is connected to or inspired
[11:17] by uh just natural things in Proverbs
[11:20] chapter 24 verse uh
[11:22] let me go I have verse 17 and 18. what
[11:27] what how does that work
[11:28] um I might have to just look so we know
[11:30] we're in the right place I there was
[11:31] another verse there I think it might
[11:32] just be uh verse 17 Proverbs 24 17 and
[11:36] those of you who flip through your
[11:37] Bibles and are already there
[11:39] yep verse 17. I had verse 18. well I
[11:42] guess I do have 18 on there too 17 and
[11:44] 18. and so it says Rejoice not when
[11:47] thine enemy falleth
[11:50] and let not thine heart be glad when he
[11:52] stumbleth we could just dismiss Church
[11:55] on this right here well you said that
[11:57] maybe a little bit too anxiously
[11:58] uh we could we could get so much just
[12:01] from thinking about this verse right now
[12:03] to where there's a principle that we
[12:04] could take and if we live by there's
[12:06] gonna be a lot of progress
[12:08] Rejoice not when thine enemy falleth
[12:10] that we may we need to allow that to
[12:12] have the most Broad and deep uh
[12:15] application in our hearts that we do not
[12:17] rejoice when our enemy fails and we do
[12:19] not let our hearts be glad when he
[12:21] stumbles what a temptation
[12:23] isn't it like us to be happy when our
[12:25] our Nemesis Falls and makes a mistake or
[12:28] somebody who said something bad about
[12:29] you get something bad said bad about
[12:31] them what is our first response oh right
[12:34] we like it we like it when somebody gets
[12:37] what's coming to them and it's saying
[12:39] that we ought not to be happy or rejoice
[12:41] and be gleeful when our enemy fails or
[12:44] when they stumble or be glad when they
[12:46] stumble and this next verse might just
[12:48] hits you right between the eyes lest the
[12:50] Lord see it and it displeased him and he
[12:52] turn away his wrath from him
[12:55] all right so if there's any if there's
[12:57] any part of you that says they're
[12:58] getting what's coming to them keep your
[13:00] mouth shut don't Rejoice don't do the
[13:02] praise hands right
[13:03] did you know that the um the Emoji or
[13:06] whatever it is we use for uh prayer is
[13:08] just a high five did you know that
[13:09] everybody's giving each other a high
[13:11] five you know my mom died high five
[13:13] right
[13:15] but I it's
[13:17] that's what it looks like
[13:20] but we want to resist the temptation to
[13:22] high five right and chest bump and and
[13:25] be like yeah yeah because you could in
[13:27] doing that rejoice in enjoying over the
[13:29] wrong thing caught over something that
[13:32] you think they ought to get because got
[13:34] to say wait a minute
[13:35] I'm not happy that you're deriving your
[13:38] pleasure from their judgment
[13:40] I'm not happy that that excites you
[13:42] their demise excites you so there's a
[13:45] there's a joy that is the resp that is a
[13:48] human response to Natural things things
[13:50] maybe even God's cousin if it's the
[13:52] judgments of God on an enemy but the
[13:53] Bible's cautioning us against those Joys
[13:55] pleasure and unrighteousness lovers of
[13:58] pleasures and that Hedonism and so in
[14:01] looking at these few verses and this
[14:03] thought as Joy is merely human emotion
[14:05] that's connected with natural things
[14:06] think in terms of what the joy is coming
[14:09] from
[14:10] in other words what what where's the
[14:12] what's causing the rejoicing or as my uh
[14:17] initial working title was just reasons
[14:19] like there's a reason for something I
[14:21] have a reason Give Me A Reason Tis the
[14:22] reason there's got to be there's some
[14:24] reason for it why does this exist
[14:26] there's got to be something that causes
[14:28] it and so there is a joy that is a human
[14:31] emotion that is connected to it just
[14:33] natural things we understand that now
[14:35] there is a joy and this is uh this is
[14:39] easily identifiable but there's a joy
[14:41] which is a human emotion but it has a
[14:43] connection to the supernatural in other
[14:45] words we have a joy it is a human
[14:47] emotion but if we traced uh what it's
[14:50] related to there's some correlation or
[14:52] causation we realize that it has
[14:54] something to do with Supernatural things
[14:55] in Galatians Chapter 5 Verse 22 Paul
[14:58] writes but the fruit of the spirit is
[15:00] Joy says it's love it's peace it's
[15:02] long-suffering gentleness goodness and
[15:04] Faith but the fruit of the spirit is
[15:06] also Joy so if it's the fruit if there's
[15:09] a fruit of so it's something the spirit
[15:12] produces or something that the that
[15:14] promotes it or causes it the you have
[15:16] the spirit and if it's effective if it
[15:18] does something joy as a result of it so
[15:21] there is a joy in that and this love joy
[15:23] peace long-suffering gentleness goodness
[15:24] these are all things that we would
[15:26] experience in the the realm of our human
[15:28] being our human emotions and so there's
[15:30] a joy that has a connection to the
[15:32] spirit the capital S spirit
[15:34] in Acts Chapter 13 Verse 52 and this is
[15:37] where if you just were doing a word
[15:40] search and printing out your notes for
[15:41] joy and using scripture Joy you just
[15:43] you'd keep the printer would keep
[15:44] printing because there's so many
[15:46] scriptures related to joy and peace and
[15:48] gladness and pleasure and rejoice and it
[15:50] says in Acts 13 and the disciples were
[15:52] filled with joy and with the Holy Ghost
[15:55] and so this filled with the Holy Ghost
[15:57] and then there's this joy and excitement
[15:59] that's coming with it and so this is
[16:02] that Joy which is a human emotion but it
[16:04] has some connection or basis in the
[16:06] Supernatural and then in Psalms 51 12
[16:10] it says that they this is a well this is
[16:12] a scripture that we used uh in the
[16:14] outset and so maybe instead of uh just
[16:18] continue along those lines maybe I'll
[16:19] just reset a little bit
[16:21] so there's a human emotion there's of
[16:23] Joy which is purely carnal then there's
[16:26] a human emotion of joy that has some
[16:28] connection to the Supernatural and David
[16:30] alludes to it in Psalm 61 12. he's
[16:32] alluding to This Joy of Salvation he
[16:35] says restore unto me the joy of thy
[16:36] salvation and uphold me with thy free
[16:38] spirit so there's a joy that comes from
[16:41] salvation
[16:42] there's a joy that comes from it but now
[16:44] I want and this might be
[16:47] a nuance and you say well that that
[16:49] seems very uh very fine very distinct
[16:53] but it makes a huge difference
[16:56] there's a joy that comes with salvation
[16:59] and brother Bantam touches on this and
[17:01] he starts to divide this difference
[17:02] where he's taking what Joy is and he
[17:04] separates it out and he says you got to
[17:06] look at it this way because there's
[17:07] these other things of looking at certain
[17:09] principles and you have to recognize
[17:10] their differences so in the sermon why
[17:12] he says we Rejoice that's the joy of God
[17:15] that's the joy of our Salvation it says
[17:17] David David never lost his salvation he
[17:20] said restore to me the joy of my
[17:22] salvation he had his salvation but he
[17:24] lost his Joy well we got plenty of joy
[17:27] we know that we have joy joy unspeakable
[17:30] and full of Glory got it now it's not
[17:33] that's not a slight he's just making a
[17:36] difference and sometimes that that uh
[17:39] when a difference is made that can
[17:40] bother us it says oh well if there's a
[17:42] difference and this happens well he's
[17:43] just making a difference doesn't mean
[17:44] one is uh that he's saying this is bad
[17:47] and this one's good he's just wanting us
[17:48] to understand the difference he says but
[17:49] now the thing the power of God is
[17:52] something greater than Joy
[17:55] power comes by settled faith we can have
[17:58] a lot of Joy but maybe wouldn't have no
[18:00] power there to heal at all
[18:02] right so there's joy there's enthusiasm
[18:04] there's excitement these human emotions
[18:06] says you can have that you got it he's
[18:08] not saying that's bad but he's saying
[18:09] that power is something deeper the power
[18:12] of God is something on the level to
[18:14] where it can heal it says but when we
[18:16] have the power of God then we've got the
[18:19] faith of God that moves up takes hold of
[18:21] God knows how to touch him and he's
[18:24] definitely looking at something very
[18:26] specific here to where you can have the
[18:29] experiences of Joy but not experiences
[18:31] power or there's a joy that God brings
[18:34] and the joy even Joy of salvation but
[18:36] yet there's something lacking in terms
[18:38] of a faith that's getting a hold of God
[18:40] and knows how to touch God
[18:42] so it and I think this distinction's
[18:45] important and I want to be very careful
[18:46] how I phrase it but there's there's
[18:48] something about God touching you and
[18:51] making you happy and then you being able
[18:53] to touch God and getting something from
[18:54] them
[18:55] and so he is being very specific and
[18:58] he's actually making a very precise
[18:59] application and the number of statements
[19:01] I'm going to read to you he's looking at
[19:03] something very precisely so sometimes
[19:05] you have to resist the urge to just uh
[19:07] take this statement and just try to
[19:09] apply it in a blanket way but he's being
[19:11] very precise
[19:12] and so this distinction is important
[19:15] because he's identifying joy as this
[19:18] emotional product it's wonderful it's
[19:20] desirable we want it we have it it's
[19:22] great it's not he's not putting a
[19:24] Scarlet Letter on Joy at all but he's
[19:26] saying there's a difference between the
[19:27] joy that comes from the Lord and the
[19:30] power that comes from the Lord or the
[19:31] power of God
[19:33] and as he uses this in a number of
[19:35] places as I've studied this and looked
[19:37] at in the message of the hour when he's
[19:39] making this distinction he's looking at
[19:41] a joy from the Lord that is temporal and
[19:44] that temporarily in its experience so
[19:46] it's temporal even in the things that
[19:47] Inspire it or temporal in the way that
[19:49] we experience it or the way that it's
[19:51] manifested the joy of the Lord moves or
[19:53] shouting there's praise there's
[19:54] rejoicing and he's saying but there's no
[19:56] power there because uh the joy is
[19:59] temporal it's fleeting it goes away when
[20:00] the human emotion subsides there's
[20:02] nothing lasting where is he saying that
[20:04] the power of God can make changes that
[20:06] are permanent
[20:08] and so there's a way that the spirit of
[20:10] God can move to enthuse people manifest
[20:14] itself in a way where people are
[20:16] emotionally enthused and enthusiastic
[20:18] and they can dance and they shout and
[20:20] they praise and they rejoice and they
[20:22] scream and it's a and it's and again
[20:24] it's the spirit of God that moves and
[20:25] causes people to shout to dance to
[20:28] praise to have excited utterances to
[20:30] rejoice and that's the spirit of God
[20:32] moving causing people to yes hallelujah
[20:35] praise the Lord and they're excited but
[20:37] I said that's one thing
[20:39] that's the joy of the Lord
[20:41] and even when it comes to that joy that
[20:43] accompanies salvation he's in that
[20:45] there's this expression there's this
[20:46] outpouring that comes uh from the saved
[20:49] he said David didn't lose his salvation
[20:51] he had kind of lost his praise
[20:53] and so there's a way that the spirit of
[20:55] God then can move in power
[20:58] to heal
[21:00] it can manifest itself in a way that
[21:02] brings Deliverance so there's a there's
[21:04] a a spirit of God moves and there's
[21:06] rejoicing spirit of God moves and
[21:07] there's healings and brother I'm saying
[21:09] there's a difference between that
[21:11] and the sermon God called men he says
[21:13] many people don't understand what
[21:14] anointing means he says they think it
[21:17] means to shout he said that's Joy
[21:20] power comes solemn and that's a it's a
[21:23] great uh it's a great a principle to
[21:26] really uh dive into and Ponder in the
[21:29] sense that there are things that can uh
[21:32] we think sometimes oh man he would they
[21:34] were so there's such an anointing and
[21:36] there was such an anointing there and we
[21:38] we apply the anointing to how excited
[21:40] somebody was and how much they sweat or
[21:42] how loud they were and those anointed
[21:44] prayers are the ones that when they lay
[21:45] hands on the person they almost fall
[21:47] down how hard they touch them and we're
[21:49] thinking that's annoying brother said no
[21:50] power is very somber very solemn
[21:54] uh when the power of God begins to move
[21:56] in meetings uh in brother Brands
[21:58] meetings many times there was a hush
[22:01] there's a Stillness
[22:02] um I had a very close a family very
[22:04] sister Della Shepherd brother Phillip uh
[22:06] she expressed how she uh has some family
[22:09] relation which if as you get to know
[22:11] brother Philip and sister Carol uh
[22:13] everybody in the message has no more
[22:15] than six degrees of separation from
[22:16] those two in terms of relation they know
[22:18] they're related to everybody in the
[22:20] message
[22:21] and uh and that's great that's wonderful
[22:24] and one of the degrees of separation
[22:26] from him is Sister Della Shepherd and
[22:28] she was called out in a meeting in Los
[22:30] Angeles where brother Bama said I see
[22:32] you sister begins to describe and she
[22:34] said that when she felt that presence
[22:38] she said it was so tremendous if I and
[22:40] if I remember remembering it correctly
[22:42] that part of you wanted just to burst
[22:45] and to run but it was so powerful you
[22:48] were just paralyzed
[22:50] that it was just it was something that
[22:51] just it just it brought you into under
[22:54] subjection and she was paralyzed and
[22:57] he's saying there's a joy that's
[22:58] shouting he says but that's not the
[22:59] anointing he's in power the anointed of
[23:02] power of song he said that's the joy of
[23:04] the Lord this is the power of the Lord
[23:05] healing making well and so again he is
[23:09] being very specific about the Dynamics
[23:12] in his meetings of what joy and shouting
[23:14] and rejoicing might be because a lot of
[23:16] people they might say that was largely
[23:17] absent from these meetings uh but yet
[23:20] there was the power of God present to
[23:22] heal and the power of God was present to
[23:23] make deliverances so he said there's a
[23:25] joy that happens there's an excitement
[23:26] that people can have but when the power
[23:28] of God is moving he's saying it can be
[23:30] very solemn
[23:31] but the power of the Lord brings healing
[23:33] and it makes well
[23:34] and so there's something I want us to
[23:36] learn from this uh together
[23:39] and as I use the word nuance there's a
[23:42] Nuance here that I think we need to
[23:44] catch and though it might be slight
[23:46] it makes a huge impact
[23:49] and the sermon believeth thou this
[23:52] and uh I hope you could just pay very
[23:55] close attention because I'm the subject
[23:58] matter
[23:59] um to me is uh very serious
[24:03] and I want us to be concentrating that
[24:05] we don't um that we you could just be
[24:07] following me very closely and the sermon
[24:09] believes without this brother Ram is
[24:10] talking about the land beyond the river
[24:12] there's a place there's an eternity
[24:14] there's a place to go there's a realm
[24:15] that we can live in uh one day we will
[24:18] go to live in forever and never leave
[24:19] and he says and one out of every ten
[24:22] thousand Christians knows no more about
[24:24] but just by faith to believe about it
[24:27] an interesting statement that one out of
[24:29] every 10 000 Christians know no more
[24:31] about it but just by faith to believe
[24:32] about it so there's a he's talking about
[24:34] there's a land beyond the river and some
[24:36] of us don't know anything more than just
[24:37] to believe in it
[24:38] but there's a place that a human being
[24:40] while yet here can be lifted up into
[24:41] that spot
[24:43] so there's a land beyond the river a lot
[24:44] of us just believe in it but then
[24:46] there's some people he says that get
[24:47] lifted up into that realm this place and
[24:49] he's relating to his own experiences of
[24:52] of
[24:53] highs and lows from inspiration and how
[24:57] hard it is to get inspired and come back
[24:58] down and he's actually given a testimony
[25:01] this is a 1951 he's given a testament
[25:02] about how healthy he is right now he
[25:04] says I've never weighed more than 130
[25:06] pounds he says right now I weigh 155 so
[25:08] I figured if I put on 25 pounds I got
[25:11] quotes to support it and um and brother
[25:13] Bram said hey I'm healthy this is great
[25:15] because this this up and down this
[25:17] inspiration highs and lows takes a toll
[25:19] and again I'm wanting us to catch
[25:21] something from this like if and this way
[25:23] I look at it that there's something that
[25:25] could be inspired from it that we're
[25:27] we're not changing the meaning of
[25:28] anything and brother bear may not
[25:29] specifically be trying to say this but
[25:31] if this is what he's saying and you use
[25:33] first principles you can say oh well
[25:35] look at this this is what falls out this
[25:37] is what made this description these are
[25:40] all components of what he's describing
[25:41] he says now it is not a rejoicing time
[25:45] like you just lift it up into Joy I've
[25:48] seen much joy not enough real Solid
[25:50] Faith to cure a toothache so he's seen
[25:52] the enthusiasm he's seen the excitement
[25:54] so when he talks about being lifted up
[25:56] into this realm of inspiration he's
[25:58] saying it's it's not just to rejoice and
[25:59] be lifted up in Joyce and I've seen much
[26:01] joy not enough real Solid Faith to cure
[26:03] toothache he said that's the joy of the
[26:05] Lord not the power of the Lord
[26:07] he says I want more joy of the Lord
[26:10] so that's what I desire and that's what
[26:11] you have need of
[26:13] so again he makes this distinction of
[26:15] the joy of the Lord and the power of God
[26:20] and this may again this might seem to be
[26:24] a real subtle to you
[26:25] but this is what stood out to me because
[26:27] then he immediately goes to the story of
[26:30] Stephen Foster just a few statements
[26:31] about him he's the father of American
[26:32] music he's as the way he's regarded just
[26:34] with some of the the ballots he wrote
[26:36] little songs that may be very familiar
[26:38] to you but he refers to Stephen Foster's
[26:42] cycle of inspiration where he'd write
[26:44] these songs and then uh this dependence
[26:47] upon alcohol and alcoholism and I know
[26:49] that his foundation disputes uh the fact
[26:52] that he was an alcoholic and disputes
[26:54] some of the the ways that people believe
[26:56] that he died but it's believed that he
[26:58] died by Suicide there's different
[26:59] accounts for it but
[27:01] it's true that he had these moments of
[27:03] great inspiration and then these moments
[27:06] of real down times and brother bam
[27:08] refers to Stephen fostering talks about
[27:09] how look at this guy because he's saying
[27:11] there's a land beyond the river there's
[27:12] inspiration there's Ebbs and flows and
[27:14] he says look what can happen someone
[27:15] could be real inspired and then have
[27:17] these deep depths and then he uses
[27:19] William calper as an example his poet
[27:21] him writer that
[27:24] has a remarkable testimony and brother
[27:27] Branham talks about his cycle of
[27:29] inspiration
[27:30] and the depression and how ultimately he
[27:32] took his own life
[27:33] and it's showing this conscience of how
[27:36] man some people can get inspired
[27:38] and and write and express things and
[27:42] poetry and songs and get lifted up and
[27:46] then when that's gone they crash and
[27:48] they find themselves depressed and
[27:50] brother bam says now as long as the
[27:51] inspiration was on them they were all
[27:53] right but when the inspiration leaves
[27:55] that's what hurts
[27:57] will you say Amen to that
[28:00] all right so he's talking about this
[28:01] production cycle
[28:03] that exists Within These these inspired
[28:05] writers and these gifted people to where
[28:07] there is this uh temporary effect of
[28:10] inspiration and then once the
[28:12] inspiration is gone there's this crash
[28:14] right I've just described all of you who
[28:17] use caffeine
[28:18] right caffeine gives you this
[28:21] and they say that there's a huge drop
[28:22] off right because when it's gone it just
[28:24] leaves you
[28:25] and it says deal with this buddy and
[28:27] here's a headache to boot right there's
[28:29] a crash that comes and so that's kind of
[28:32] what this inspiration does is that if
[28:33] you just have this you have this level
[28:35] here and all sudden oh wow I'm inspired
[28:37] but when the inspiration is gone you
[28:39] don't come back to this Baseline you
[28:41] just crash right through it and and it
[28:44] brings you lower and the brother I was
[28:45] looking at that he says as long as the
[28:47] inspiration was on them they were fine
[28:49] but when it left there was hurt
[28:51] so now I don't think this is a huge
[28:54] pivot but joy can be inspired
[28:57] and joy is inspired and there's this
[29:00] human emotion and we're enthused oh I'm
[29:02] happy I'm excited this is great this is
[29:04] wonderful but what happens when it
[29:05] leaves
[29:06] what happens when that human emotion
[29:09] whether it be the human emotion because
[29:10] you're happy because your enemies are
[29:11] getting it or it's the human emotion
[29:12] that you get when the spirit of God
[29:14] moves what happens when that leaves
[29:16] or the inspiration is gone are do you
[29:19] come back to a positive base level or is
[29:21] there a crash
[29:24] what happens when it's gone brother
[29:26] Brown I'm in that story he's telling he
[29:28] says I I desire your prayers for me that
[29:29] I will maintain the strength
[29:32] he wanted to maintain this level he
[29:34] wanted to he didn't want the highs and
[29:36] lows the real extremes and I think that
[29:38] that should be desirable sometimes oh I
[29:40] just want Mountain Top Mountain Top
[29:41] Mountain Top and sometimes what comes
[29:44] with the Mountaintop so the really
[29:45] really low valleys
[29:47] and and I'm using I want to be careful
[29:49] my description but I believe that what
[29:51] we should have as Christians is a real
[29:53] steady trajectory
[29:55] no I I don't want to be the guy who's
[29:57] always sprinting to the top right and
[29:59] then falling down to the bottom and and
[30:00] finally real high and then real low we
[30:03] went on a family hike one time and uh
[30:05] one of our children just ah like come on
[30:07] let's do this and it was in sand and it
[30:09] was really hard it was in in Utah and I
[30:12] was like this is going to be a really
[30:13] it's one of these slot canyons like this
[30:14] is going to take us forever but one of
[30:16] the children just felt good that day it
[30:17] was a real cold brisk day and they
[30:18] started running circles around us right
[30:20] like come on guys you guys don't know
[30:22] what you're doing come on get those
[30:23] knees up we can do this and it's like
[30:25] kind of making a making us feel bad
[30:27] because this was really hard and five
[30:29] minutes later they were sitting down the
[30:31] ground
[30:32] I can't go anymore just come back and
[30:35] get me later right and and steady gets
[30:37] the job done right just be real plotting
[30:40] just be real disciplined be real
[30:42] perseverant and so there's there's this
[30:44] maintaining strength where there's
[30:46] progress It's not hot high and crashing
[30:48] and holy then perverted and then you
[30:50] know excited and then depressed that's
[30:53] what he that's what this is a principle
[30:54] that he begins to identify the
[30:56] difference between the joy of the Lord
[30:57] and the power of the Lord
[30:59] and then in the India trip report when
[31:01] he's given this report at a breakfast he
[31:03] says brethren we had the church's bubble
[31:05] dance long enough
[31:08] and so this bubble dance it's excited
[31:10] everything's exciting is hallelujah
[31:12] you're shouting praise and he's talking
[31:14] about this bubble dancing it's and and I
[31:16] wouldn't say that he's trying to say oh
[31:17] that wasn't the spirit of God that was
[31:18] just the devil no the spirit of God
[31:19] moves people bubble dance they get happy
[31:21] they Bounce Around they're bubbling
[31:22] they're bubbling the bubbling he says
[31:23] but we got to get down to Something Real
[31:25] them things are all right
[31:28] and I would say nothing against that
[31:30] but if it's if it's at the sake of
[31:32] losing something else and not having
[31:34] what's real then I don't want the bubble
[31:36] dance
[31:37] he said then things are all right it's
[31:38] the joy of the Lord many times instead
[31:41] of the power of the Lord
[31:43] so you see how brother Bradham is taking
[31:44] this Joy this human sentiment this human
[31:47] emotion
[31:48] he's saying we can have it it's great
[31:50] and it's all right but it's different
[31:51] from Power
[31:53] and in making that distinction
[31:55] and we look at it that way I say oh well
[31:57] there's a joy that can leave me
[31:59] there's a joy that is an enthusiasm that
[32:01] comes and it's temporary he says but
[32:03] there's a power of God and he begins to
[32:05] make this distinction to me that shows
[32:07] me that there's a joy that is available
[32:09] to us that we can participate in that
[32:12] comes and goes and comes and goes but
[32:14] there's a power of God that we want to
[32:16] have
[32:17] and so brother Branham is looking at and
[32:19] I'm going to take this to our our title
[32:22] today but look at the first first look
[32:25] at a cause and effect relationship
[32:28] so cause and effect
[32:33] there we go I've got some slides coming
[32:36] up that I'm going to try to navigate
[32:36] myself personally so I have a
[32:39] um a clicker up here
[32:41] so there's a cause and effect
[32:43] relationship now I think you're all very
[32:46] familiar with this principle but if
[32:49] there's a cause and effect relationship
[32:50] it's establishing a relationship between
[32:52] actions so they're with there's an
[32:54] action and there's a resulting action
[32:56] and so first action second action and a
[32:59] cause and effect to saying is asking did
[33:01] the first action cause the second
[33:04] and if the first action caused the
[33:06] second action then the second action is
[33:08] called the effect
[33:09] effect by the first action so a cause is
[33:12] the source of effects and if the one
[33:15] thing you can learn today is the
[33:16] difference between effect and effect
[33:17] that's the least be something
[33:20] but a cause is the source of effects and
[33:23] so the effect is the result or the
[33:25] consequence of a Cause
[33:28] so the effect is a consequence itself of
[33:31] a Cause
[33:33] and now this principle of cause and
[33:35] effect in many ways is what we try to
[33:37] teach our children from the moment they
[33:38] can begin to understand us right is if
[33:40] you do this this happens this is the
[33:42] cause this the effect this is the cause
[33:43] this the effect and hoping that if we
[33:45] can teach them these fundamentals of
[33:47] cause and effect then they can kind of
[33:49] extrapolate from that and begin to
[33:51] deduce from that that with action comes
[33:54] reaction with action comes second action
[33:56] and there's things that they do that can
[33:58] cause this and if you can have an
[34:00] understanding I I if you can in life
[34:03] identify the cause of things not just
[34:06] the effect but identify the cause then
[34:08] it deepens our understanding of things
[34:11] all right and that's uh maybe in some
[34:13] ways that's how our children are just
[34:16] boiling it down that's what their lives
[34:18] consist of at a certain point is it's
[34:20] they see something happen and they're
[34:22] going okay what caused that what what
[34:24] makes this happen why is this the way
[34:26] that it is and learning not just seeing
[34:29] the effect but knowing why it is that
[34:31] way and the cause of it is very very
[34:33] important
[34:35] and so the cause is the reason why
[34:37] something happened and the effect is
[34:39] what happened
[34:40] is that simple enough to look at its
[34:42] cause is the reason causes the what
[34:45] makes something happen and the effect is
[34:47] what happened
[34:49] and again having an understanding of
[34:52] causality cause and effect can form this
[34:56] a real strong basis to understand new
[34:58] things different things why things are
[35:00] different you can see an effect and you
[35:02] can say oh well that's the same thing
[35:04] but when you go back and find the cause
[35:06] you're us it is different
[35:07] and there's a lot of times when uh and
[35:10] again I find myself just being drawn to
[35:11] examples with our children where they
[35:14] see the same effect and they're not
[35:15] giving consideration to the actual cause
[35:18] and how different it is many times in
[35:21] terms of what was what was causing it
[35:23] and what was producing it I think a lot
[35:26] of times it's the debate that we have
[35:28] anymore and everyone being politically
[35:29] correct is they they take art they take
[35:32] the product and they they take it out of
[35:34] the context or the cause of it and they
[35:37] view it in the wrong concept the wrong
[35:38] realm and they use it to Great
[35:40] destruction so this understanding cause
[35:43] and effect is even a mark of maturity
[35:47] now
[35:48] I want to use a very simple examples and
[35:51] I think maybe these are all easy ones
[35:53] that we all know so that you could see
[35:56] this element of cause and effect
[35:59] and I'm realizing now maybe my examples
[36:01] aren't exactly uh on the nose for this
[36:04] but
[36:06] you've all maybe you've heard the phrase
[36:07] before you're using it incorrectly right
[36:09] are you you're using it wrong you're
[36:11] like how am I using it wrong I saw a
[36:13] clip one time of somebody with a drill
[36:14] an elect an actual drill
[36:17] and with a drill bit on it and they were
[36:20] using a hammer at the back of it and it
[36:22] was like you might get the done but
[36:24] you're using it wrong
[36:25] and there's a lot of things that
[36:27] to where you use something
[36:30] and and it has some utility and it has
[36:32] some use but you're using it wrong
[36:34] and there are so many examples of this
[36:36] that I just immediately grabbed just
[36:38] like the lowest hanging fruit very very
[36:39] simple things I was like man I could
[36:40] just do a whole series on this and we
[36:42] could just have life hacks part 1200. of
[36:46] all the things that were like you're
[36:47] using it wrong that's not you know why
[36:49] this is there and why this is it's like
[36:50] this and we're like
[36:52] I never knew that that's amazing right
[36:53] it's with everything we could just bring
[36:55] everyday items that we have with us
[36:57] right now and we could probably
[36:58] demonstrate to that's not how you use it
[37:00] right
[37:01] and so this idea if you're doing it
[37:03] wrong you're using it incorrectly is
[37:06] something that I want us to think in
[37:08] terms of cause and effect because we
[37:10] might be thinking Action Reaction we're
[37:11] thinking about just punching somebody in
[37:12] a bloody nose but this comes down to
[37:15] design
[37:16] it comes down to utility it comes down
[37:18] to understanding why things are the way
[37:20] they are what their purpose is and how
[37:22] they're to be used so there's some
[37:24] intent behind it because if you just
[37:26] look at God as just trying to produce an
[37:28] effect then we think well any means by
[37:30] any means necessary right that oh well
[37:33] all that matters at the end is is this
[37:35] veneer or this example or this certain
[37:36] thing as all God wants a book of Acts
[37:39] let's just have a book of Acts it says
[37:41] well no you got to go back and
[37:42] understand cause and effect otherwise
[37:46] you could produce something very similar
[37:48] but vastly different
[37:50] and so I want to use these examples of
[37:52] everybody recognize Reynolds Wrap right
[37:56] but did you ever know what those little
[37:57] things on the side are for
[37:59] hey
[38:00] they're hardly ever used in our house
[38:03] but you push them in
[38:05] and it's going to keep the roll of foil
[38:07] in the box right so when you're tearing
[38:10] out pieces of foil is spilling out
[38:13] and then the kids just roll it back up
[38:15] thinking oh we'll just we'll just use it
[38:16] later we'll just iron it
[38:19] uh and but you know you do that it's the
[38:21] same with uh Saran Wrap right there's
[38:23] these little things that you can pinch
[38:24] on there and it holds it in there and
[38:26] this is something that has been on these
[38:28] boxes of render wrap since they invented
[38:30] it in the ancient medieval times or
[38:33] whenever they invented it
[38:34] but yet a lot of people don't use it
[38:36] it's like you've been using foil for
[38:39] years and it's worked just fine but you
[38:40] know what there's actually a utility
[38:41] built into it to make it easier
[38:44] everybody anybody ever eat a banana we
[38:46] didn't have any good ones I didn't want
[38:47] to bring a rotten banana up here
[38:49] but I'm telling you probably most of you
[38:52] peel a banana wrong
[38:54] how many people just grab a banana take
[38:56] the stem and right
[38:58] but the easiest way to peel a banana is
[39:01] to take the end and just pinch it it
[39:03] just peels down very beautifully and it
[39:05] looks like this when you're done
[39:06] I mean that's how the animals that eat
[39:09] the bananas do it right
[39:12] but we're the animals right
[39:14] and we just rip the stem off and it gets
[39:18] all mushy and everything falls apart but
[39:20] there's it's like baked into it itself
[39:22] it's a feature not a flaw you just get
[39:24] this is the way that you can peel the
[39:26] banana and it works out great
[39:29] and this is the one for all the sisters
[39:31] we know what this is right sisters
[39:34] generic motor oil I didn't want to
[39:37] offend anybody I was like what's gonna
[39:38] have I put Pennzoil up there and you can
[39:39] have a whole whatever crowd some
[39:42] brothers leave the church because I
[39:43] can't believe brother Aaron doesn't use
[39:45] this
[39:46] there's a story one time where brother
[39:48] Brandon was overheard saying that's the
[39:49] only oil I use it's the best oil there
[39:51] is and this brother went and got all the
[39:53] oil he had and confined and he put it in
[39:55] his car and was using it for a while and
[39:56] it ruined the brother's engine
[39:58] completely destroyed the brother's
[39:59] engine the brother was just really
[40:00] confused I mean brother Branham went to
[40:03] him he said brother brand am I I
[40:04] overheard you say this oil was the best
[40:06] motor oil you used and I put it in my
[40:08] car and I blew my engine it ruined my
[40:09] engine said oh brother I was talking
[40:11] about for my boots
[40:13] and so there's a lesson there
[40:19] he might have went and ruined a good
[40:20] pair of boots too after that but
[40:22] this is generic motor oil now do you
[40:24] know how to pour oil
[40:26] in your car when you need well yeah you
[40:28] go down to Quick Lube and you pay
[40:30] somebody 90 bucks to do it
[40:31] but this bottle has this design to it
[40:34] and one of the biggest Pains of pouring
[40:36] oil in your car you used to have a car
[40:38] that burnt so much oil always had a case
[40:39] of oil in my carbs Pennzoil for those
[40:41] who want to know no
[40:43] and it would guzzle it and so you'd
[40:45] always have to be pour and oil in and if
[40:47] you don't get a big enough funnel you
[40:48] get oil everywhere right because what
[40:50] does it do gold glug glug glug and it's
[40:51] like these guys don't know how to design
[40:52] an oil can because this is how you pour
[40:55] it out right take it and you pour it out
[40:57] like this but that's the wrong way to do
[40:59] it
[41:00] it's actually designed so you pour it
[41:02] this way and it has something to do with
[41:03] science
[41:04] right
[41:06] where this is the way things work this
[41:07] is the way fluid works and air pressure
[41:09] works that when you do it this way you
[41:10] don't get the glug glug glug and it's
[41:12] made that way where's my man's from
[41:13] Brother Judah when I need them right
[41:15] this is the way that you pour oil in
[41:17] your car and it says it right on the
[41:18] bottle
[41:22] it's there on all just look next time it
[41:25] shows you on it how to hold it
[41:28] and so this is what I'm talking about
[41:29] when I say you're using it wrong
[41:32] in some ways it's written right in it
[41:34] and we keep trying to use it but we
[41:37] haven't taken time to get back to how
[41:39] does God want us to use it what is it
[41:41] used for could there perhaps be some
[41:44] very those subtle just examples and
[41:47] leadership in the word of God and if we
[41:49] could just clue in oh I know what we
[41:51] need we need all in the car this is
[41:53] and get all everywhere or you slow down
[41:56] say I need oil how do I need to put it
[41:57] in there
[41:59] right we don't want to just bubble dance
[42:01] and be enthusiastic and have a lot of
[42:03] fun because we think that's what the
[42:04] Bible says we need to have joy joy joy
[42:06] joy joy but there's got to be a way
[42:08] where we understand what it's for
[42:13] more life hacks to come
[42:18] and so on the sermon the mark of the
[42:19] beast and the Seal of God part one
[42:21] brother Ben I was talking about
[42:22] fundamentalists he said who understand
[42:23] positionally who they are and they under
[42:24] they've been taught right they
[42:26] understand maybe the instructions
[42:27] they've got a lot of teaching and he
[42:29] talked and the Pentecostals and he's
[42:31] saying well the fundamentalists
[42:32] understand their position and the
[42:33] Pentecostals have a lot of faith and
[42:36] they have a lot of enthusiasm I mean
[42:37] there's things and there's a lot of
[42:38] manifestation and he is he is in a lot
[42:41] of ways looking at um appearance right
[42:43] fundamentals understand the word of God
[42:45] but they may be very stayed very
[42:47] reserved there's not a manifest a lot of
[42:48] manifestation their meetings and their
[42:49] church services whereas with the
[42:51] Pentecostals a lot of enthusiasm a lot
[42:52] of rejoicing a lot of healing a lot of
[42:54] power got faith he says they got faith
[42:55] they got faith but what they really need
[42:57] is that teaching to be positionally
[42:59] placed so they can kind of fuse together
[43:01] and they could actually really get
[43:02] something done and make progress
[43:04] and brother Brown was looking at that
[43:06] and he's saying this of the Pentecostals
[43:07] he's talking about all that energy all
[43:08] that power he says they blow it all out
[43:10] the whistle with screams and shouts and
[43:12] runs
[43:13] so there's something there there's some
[43:15] enthusiasm there's a move there's even a
[43:16] power he said there's something there
[43:18] but they're blowing it all out with
[43:19] screams shouts and runs he said they
[43:21] could ever bottle it down you'd see a
[43:23] church standing her feet in power and
[43:25] Glory
[43:26] if there's a way that could channel that
[43:28] energy if there's a way that could
[43:29] channel that power if there's a way that
[43:31] they could harness it there's a it's
[43:32] kind of wildfire it's glug blood glug
[43:34] they're getting oil in the engine but
[43:36] they're not being efficient with it it's
[43:38] not it's leaving too much smoke
[43:40] afterwards or whatever it might be or
[43:41] whatever example you want to use they're
[43:43] eating the banana but they're ruining
[43:44] half of it and they're getting it
[43:45] everywhere
[43:47] they're ruining this roll of foil right
[43:49] all the edges are crimped there's just
[43:50] some inefficiencies there if they they
[43:52] could just understand the way God has
[43:54] designed it if they could come back to
[43:56] First principles and be established and
[43:58] positionally placed then you don't need
[44:00] to take away any power any faith or
[44:02] enthusiasm but you use these first
[44:04] principles and you can build into this
[44:06] Perfection you can get to the climax of
[44:08] Mount Zion
[44:10] so we use the example of music and we
[44:12] use the example of cooking like there's
[44:13] a way that even at his wonderful
[44:15] Fellowship on it that even when it comes
[44:17] to music we said plane by ear has a has
[44:20] this uh there's a there's something that
[44:22] a downside too or if you can only play
[44:23] by ear it means you can't read music but
[44:25] you know a lot of people can read music
[44:27] but they haven't really even understood
[44:28] what they're reading to the place where
[44:31] now they can write it they can chart it
[44:33] they can understand it they could even
[44:34] find where things need to go and how to
[44:35] even improve on things and have the
[44:37] building blocks to do these things
[44:38] themselves that's what we're talking
[44:40] about even in this cause and effect
[44:42] which will come do that there's more to
[44:45] be understood about the very things that
[44:46] we have
[44:48] so they'll stand on his feet in glory
[44:49] there'd be a book of Acts wrote behind
[44:51] it they take it out in Joy instead of
[44:54] power and faith
[44:56] hold that there and believe it it's
[44:58] God's word stay right with it so the way
[44:59] that he's kind of expressing this is
[45:02] they take the inspiration or they take
[45:05] this the the enthusiasm and they take
[45:08] that energy and they're releasing it in
[45:10] this joyful expression and the emotions
[45:12] instead of being able to channel it and
[45:14] hold it to the word of God and project
[45:16] it to the word of God and watch it rise
[45:18] up in power
[45:19] watch it grow their faith and stay with
[45:21] the word of God
[45:24] now to we're going to be reading from
[45:26] Matthew chapter 21 when Christ is
[45:28] entering into Jerusalem or coming into
[45:31] draw nine to Jerusalem and come to
[45:33] Bethpage and he's as he's near there he
[45:36] recites this
[45:37] we read the story in those first five
[45:39] verses
[45:40] of Jesus saying go into a village and
[45:42] grab these things it says so that it
[45:43] would be written that would be fulfilled
[45:44] with the prophet
[45:46] now in Zechariah Chapter 9 verse 9 now
[45:48] I'm using this as an example of this
[45:50] cause and effect to take us to recognize
[45:53] this subtle difference that I think I
[45:55] want that I'm wanting to show you
[45:57] in Zechariah Chapter 9 verse 9 says
[45:59] Rejoice greatly o Daughter of Zion shout
[46:01] o daughter of Jerusalem Rejoice be
[46:04] joyful be enthusiastic pray shout
[46:07] Rejoice Behold thy King cometh unto thee
[46:10] he is just and having salvation
[46:13] lowly and riding upon an ass and upon a
[46:15] cult the fowl of an ass so there's this
[46:17] is what they're to be doing to rejoice
[46:19] and shouting because your King is Coming
[46:22] and he's just
[46:24] and has salvation
[46:26] like this is this is this
[46:28] characteristics I believe are are
[46:30] connected to the praise connected to the
[46:32] rejoicing
[46:33] and he's described in a prophetic way
[46:36] he's lowly he's humble he's riding on
[46:38] the ass upon the cult the fowl of an
[46:40] acid it's like well why would a king
[46:42] ride in that manner why would he come in
[46:44] this way this is the prophecy given by
[46:47] Zechariah this is how it's fulfilled in
[46:48] Matthew 21 verses 6 to 11. the disciples
[46:51] went and did as Jesus commanded and
[46:53] brought the ass and the cult and put on
[46:55] on them their clothes and they set him
[46:57] thereon so now this is his
[46:59] Royal entry
[47:02] and a very great multitude
[47:05] spread their garments in the way
[47:08] if I could even say this that they're
[47:10] acting under the inspiration
[47:12] of Prophecy
[47:14] like Zechariah wrote it it has to be
[47:16] fulfilled and Jesus even says hey if you
[47:18] don't praise the Rocks who cry out so
[47:20] that's the power behind the prophecy
[47:22] that it's got to be fulfilled and it's
[47:23] going to have an effect and so now I
[47:26] want you just to imagine the great
[47:27] multitude spreading their garments in
[47:29] the way others cut down branches from
[47:31] the trees and strawed them in a way and
[47:33] the multitudes that went before and that
[47:36] followed Christ saying under the
[47:38] inspiration of Prophecy right Hosanna to
[47:40] the son of David blessed is he that
[47:42] cometh in the name Lord hosanna in the
[47:45] highest
[47:46] and what has happened is they're
[47:47] rejoicing they're shouting they're
[47:50] praising as the prophecies being
[47:52] unfolded
[47:53] and these are the rejoicings and the
[47:55] Praises that are being going and then as
[47:57] he comes into Jerusalem all the city was
[48:00] moved
[48:01] everybody was stirred everybody is
[48:04] finding that they've got they had an
[48:06] opinion they had to take they removed it
[48:07] was it was an attraction and the
[48:09] question was who is this
[48:11] this who is this causing the stern the
[48:13] multitude said this is Jesus the prophet
[48:16] of Nazareth of Galilee
[48:18] so now in this story in this event
[48:23] they brother random uses the phrase in
[48:25] different instances when he's telling
[48:26] stories of Christ whether it be with
[48:28] Zach
[48:29] um Zacchaeus and different ones that
[48:30] there was noise that there was this
[48:32] Gathering there was this Aurora that
[48:33] followed him and here's this worship
[48:35] here's this enthusiasm this is an
[48:37] exuberance
[48:39] there's a joy as it says Rejoice greatly
[48:41] o daughter of joy and that's an
[48:42] expression of Joy there to be joyful
[48:45] there to praise and as they're shouting
[48:47] Hosanna to the son of David blessed is
[48:50] he that cometh the name Lord hosanna in
[48:53] the highest this is a triumphal entry
[48:54] this is scripture being fulfilled this
[48:57] is peoples the Bible says they're
[48:58] throwing their clothes in the way
[49:00] they're cutting down branches from the
[49:03] trees
[49:04] and they're shouting and praising
[49:08] but how many knew what was happening
[49:11] how many knew this was Zechariah 9 9.
[49:15] how many knew that this was their
[49:17] Messiah
[49:18] and this is what you think of cause and
[49:21] defect
[49:23] what was happening with this I'm asking
[49:26] what what was taking place
[49:28] what was transpiring
[49:31] and the question could be asked is even
[49:33] says who is this why are you guys all
[49:36] excited
[49:37] I could say why why were they enthused
[49:40] if you saw somebody tearing down a palm
[49:42] branch and somebody's tearing it down
[49:43] and throw it in the way and you say why
[49:45] did you do that
[49:46] oh well this is the the Prophet this is
[49:50] this is a teacher this is a wise manner
[49:52] said well this this is exciting it isn't
[49:55] this great this is a new like ever you
[49:57] want to get all these answers even as
[49:58] Jesus probed his disciples who do you
[50:00] say that I am
[50:01] well this person says this and this is
[50:03] what they all think but who do you say
[50:05] that I am what what's your understanding
[50:08] brother Berman the sermon who is Jesus
[50:09] he's dramatizing the story of Zacchaeus
[50:11] and he's talking about his entry into
[50:12] his City he says and they were singing
[50:14] all kinds of songs and glory to God at
[50:16] our highest and all these fine hymns
[50:18] they were singing and some screaming and
[50:20] shouting he says isn't it strange where
[50:22] Jesus is there's always a lot of noise
[50:26] so when Jesus comes there's noise
[50:28] where Jesus is there's enthusiasm where
[50:30] Jesus says there's excitement
[50:32] so that means that Jesus could be
[50:34] present and he can be near and there can
[50:36] be a lot of residual effects from that
[50:39] but do you know why he's there
[50:42] [Music]
[50:44] do you know what scripture is being
[50:46] fulfilled
[50:48] is there is there a reason for your
[50:51] excitement
[50:53] do you recognize the attraction
[50:56] program described it this way people
[50:58] fanatically screaming pulling off Palm
[51:01] leaves off the trees throwing their
[51:03] clothes in the road screaming
[51:06] this is what's transpiring
[51:08] but how many of them yelled crucify him
[51:13] how many of them were willing how many
[51:15] at the end of the day are gathered in
[51:16] the up room
[51:18] how many were willing to Bear the
[51:20] reproach how many actually recognized
[51:21] what was happening how many of it were
[51:24] really in their hearts knew they were
[51:26] giving praise and adoration not only to
[51:28] their Messiah but to the Lamb of God
[51:33] how many fully recognized it and
[51:35] appreciated it
[51:37] brother Branham even says this exact
[51:38] statement about them at the time few
[51:40] recognized him to be the anointed word
[51:42] of that day
[51:44] despite all the praise all the accolades
[51:47] all the shouting all the rejoicing few
[51:49] actually recognized him for who he was
[51:52] a few very recognized him in his day
[51:55] they didn't recognize their day and its
[51:58] message but they were responding to
[52:01] events transpiring around them
[52:04] with great joy and enthusiasm
[52:06] and the sermon unbelief does not hinder
[52:08] God
[52:10] says but now to the Church of the Living
[52:12] God all those that are in Christ I would
[52:14] like to make this little statement do
[52:17] you realize the hour
[52:19] I could I maybe would just uh
[52:22] maybe fruitless and
[52:25] not even you know a convenient
[52:27] rhetorical exercise but if it's the
[52:30] church of living God that are in Christ
[52:32] you know what gives why do we need to
[52:34] figure out what time it is right I'm in
[52:36] Christ I'm saved I got the Holy Ghost
[52:37] that's all that matters but he says do
[52:38] you realize the hour
[52:40] so there's so many people when you get
[52:41] amongst just men like that and people
[52:43] that from different churches they're not
[52:45] spiritual enough to catch the
[52:47] discernment of it
[52:48] they don't get it
[52:50] and then this is a very striking
[52:52] statement they like to laugh and praise
[52:54] the Lord and Shout in the joy of the
[52:57] Lord and that's fine
[52:59] he's talking about people who
[53:01] just men
[53:03] people in the Church of the Living God
[53:04] the Christians he says they like to
[53:06] laugh they enjoy the joy of the Lord
[53:07] they like to praise like to shout he
[53:09] said that's fine but to get down and
[53:12] find out where that comes from
[53:15] get down and realize what that means
[53:19] let that let that statement stay with us
[53:22] a little bit he's saying oh we have the
[53:24] joy of the Lord and we want that we want
[53:26] worship we want praise we want
[53:28] enthusiasm uh there's there's no law
[53:31] against a shouting and dancing and
[53:33] praising and and where it's in the word
[53:36] we embrace it and so those things are
[53:38] wonderful and I'm certainly one I hope
[53:40] in the way that I teach this it doesn't
[53:42] put a damper on anybody's enthusiasm but
[53:45] there's a there's a maturity that comes
[53:49] when when enthused and when it happened
[53:51] when rejoicing he's saying that we want
[53:53] to have enough spiritual discernment to
[53:55] look at it and find out where that comes
[53:58] from and what it means
[54:00] where is the joy coming from what does
[54:02] this joy mean what is it connected
[54:03] because he says everything's set in
[54:05] order God he's right on time
[54:09] everything's set in order in God he's
[54:11] right on time so God has an order God's
[54:13] moving God's doing something there may
[54:15] be in a way where we see the spirit of
[54:16] God's being poured out people are
[54:18] manifesting certain gifts the Praises
[54:20] and shoutings are happening so oh you
[54:21] see this revival is happening here
[54:23] people are shouting the gifts are being
[54:24] restored all this is happening what you
[54:26] ought to do is have enough spiritual
[54:28] discernment to catch what it means
[54:31] have enough spiritual discernment to
[54:33] find out where it comes from and what
[54:35] it's for
[54:36] you and in this brother Adam is that
[54:39] well this is this is for me
[54:42] I I don't often like to just put it in
[54:44] the way that it strikes me but
[54:47] if I could say this way there was too
[54:49] much emphasis on the effect
[54:52] says they love to laugh praise the Lord
[54:54] shout in the joy of the Lord but they
[54:55] don't get down to find out where it
[54:56] comes from get down to realize what it
[54:57] means they didn't understand the cause
[55:01] there's a lot of bubble dancing but it's
[55:02] like what causes that
[55:04] and as he talked about the Pentecostal
[55:06] he says you got a lot of energy you got
[55:08] a lot of enthusia you've got a lot of
[55:09] excitement you ever asked yourself what
[55:10] that's for
[55:12] you if you asked yourself what all that
[55:14] burning is to do and what God wants you
[55:16] to say oh well it's to make this whistle
[55:17] go no no no the whistle is a byproduct
[55:22] of the the energy that's being produced
[55:24] to get the wheels in motion
[55:26] and you don't want to let it all out in
[55:28] the whistle you want to harness it
[55:29] enough to where it gets the train going
[55:32] gets the makes progress
[55:35] and so
[55:39] this is the part to me that
[55:43] we were like were you just you're trying
[55:46] to be very spiritual because he says
[55:47] they don't get spiritual enough to catch
[55:49] the discernment of it uh who should I is
[55:51] it okay if I continue who should I ask
[55:53] okay all right thank you my eyes landed
[55:55] on just the right person
[55:57] I know it's right we've been right at an
[55:58] hour
[55:59] um so we're entering the after hour stay
[56:01] with me I could stop right here but I
[56:03] don't want to
[56:04] but so if you're looking at this
[56:07] laughing praising shouting the joy of
[56:09] the Lord
[56:11] I'm brother Brandon saying they don't
[56:12] get down to catch the discernment of it
[56:14] to find out where it comes from what it
[56:16] means
[56:17] it begs the question
[56:19] is that the right result
[56:22] that if brother I'm saying that we we in
[56:25] taking all these things together and
[56:27] this is where we're looking at it
[56:28] together I'm wanting you to be a
[56:30] spiritual make it a spiritual exercise
[56:32] for yourself not just wow brother Aaron
[56:34] just tell me what the conclusion is I
[56:35] want you to be examining it yourself I
[56:37] want you to be taking these statements
[56:38] that brother branham's making I want you
[56:40] to begin to process it using the holy
[56:42] ghost in your life to consider these
[56:44] things and and have the Holy Spirit
[56:45] place it place it just right
[56:48] if you could have all these different
[56:50] manifestations and brother man said this
[56:52] is great this is fine but there's
[56:54] something that's greater there's
[56:56] something that has more to do with faith
[56:58] it's going to get us down the road
[56:59] that's going to exercise harness the
[57:01] energy and power that God gives for a
[57:03] particular purpose and get us down the
[57:05] road is the way that maybe they're using
[57:07] it wrong
[57:09] and maybe they're getting the result but
[57:11] is it the actual full result that God
[57:13] wants them to have
[57:15] in other words is it the total complete
[57:17] result
[57:18] in Matthew chapter 5 verse 45 I'm going
[57:20] to try to run through this we've got a
[57:21] few more scriptures and we'll maybe just
[57:23] leave in the middle of a thought but
[57:24] that's going to be fine he says they may
[57:25] and he says that you may be the children
[57:27] of your father which is in heaven for he
[57:29] maketh his son to rise on the evil and
[57:31] the good I'm just focusing on these last
[57:32] two phrases that the sun rises both on
[57:34] the good and the evil
[57:36] it's it's just this it's this element of
[57:39] nature
[57:40] he says and sendeth Reign on the just
[57:42] and the unjust
[57:44] very powerful statement for us to
[57:48] realize that God does not discriminate
[57:51] in terms of blessings and outpourings
[57:54] and the Sunshine and the rain
[57:56] that he allows it to go forth he allows
[57:59] it to come out
[58:00] and
[58:02] this is cause and effect
[58:04] because the sun shines and the rain
[58:06] falls and what happens the seed grows
[58:09] and brother Branham says this so often
[58:11] I'm only pulling a couple statements
[58:12] from 1965.
[58:14] where he's in Eves this phrase both
[58:16] rejoice and both grow
[58:19] the just and the unjust and he uses the
[58:21] wheat and the cocklebur of the weed and
[58:24] the true seed he says they both Rejoice
[58:26] they both get happy
[58:27] they built praise they both Shout
[58:30] they're kind of slumped down and they're
[58:33] thirsty and the blessings begin to pour
[58:34] and fall out and he says they they
[58:36] praise and they shout both
[58:38] and they both grow and they both Rejoice
[58:40] by he says by the same water
[58:43] it says in the sermon things that are to
[58:45] be the weed and the wheat Stand Together
[58:47] Rejoice just as much his head is down oh
[58:50] here it is this is where I get it from
[58:52] it's starving for a drink and when a
[58:54] rain comes the cockleberg can shout just
[58:56] as loud as the wheat can
[58:59] so we don't just go by who shouts the
[59:02] ladders right
[59:03] because it says the the conquerable can
[59:06] shout just as loud as the week can and
[59:08] so then it's I mean let's just use some
[59:11] deductive reasoning that means the the
[59:12] week can shout too
[59:15] can I get a shout right I mean the week
[59:17] can shout too
[59:18] and sometimes we're so afraid to shout
[59:20] because we don't want to be the confused
[59:21] as the cocklebur but don't let a cockle
[59:23] bar out shout you
[59:27] and he makes a statement he says over
[59:28] and over and over and over and over
[59:29] again it comes back to this statement
[59:31] but by the fruit she shall know them
[59:33] now that's interesting
[59:35] because now we have the fruit of joy
[59:39] shouting enthusiasm rejoicing he's
[59:41] saying they both can have it and he says
[59:42] by your fruit shall know they'll like
[59:43] but but isn't that I mean isn't that
[59:46] isn't that is that not one of the fruits
[59:48] I need to go by I need to figure this
[59:49] out so it's a this is a good question
[59:51] isn't it it's a really good question
[59:54] in the seat of discrepancy he revisits
[59:56] the same way and there's so many
[59:57] statements of this I know you're
[59:58] familiar with the same Spirit can fall
[59:59] in a meeting and everybody rejoice in it
[1:00:02] Hypocrites Christians and all together
[1:00:03] exactly right but what is it by their
[1:00:06] fruits they are known
[1:00:07] that's the only way it can ever be known
[1:00:11] so when he says by their fruits you will
[1:00:14] know them
[1:00:15] by the effect
[1:00:18] by what is caused
[1:00:20] this is I know this is an interesting
[1:00:23] way of thinking by their fruits you
[1:00:24] shall know them
[1:00:26] so by the effect you'll know them
[1:00:29] but not just by the human emotion
[1:00:33] not just by the expression of joy not
[1:00:36] just that effect
[1:00:39] but a fruit that's connected
[1:00:41] to the real purpose of the cause
[1:00:45] that there's there has to be more than
[1:00:47] oh well shouting dancing praising this
[1:00:49] is how the original church was and this
[1:00:50] is what we want but what is the spirit
[1:00:53] to do what is it to produce why why has
[1:00:56] it been given not just on the day of
[1:00:59] Pentecost but in the day and hour we're
[1:01:00] living in now why have the things
[1:01:02] happened that have happened why is it
[1:01:05] that God sent a prophet why is it he
[1:01:07] preached the things that he preached why
[1:01:09] is the spirit of God moving today and if
[1:01:11] he's sending an energy he's sending a
[1:01:13] power he's sending inspiration don't we
[1:01:16] want it to be used to get the wills to
[1:01:18] turn to make the progress so we can get
[1:01:19] out of here and not make the mistake of
[1:01:21] blowing it out of the whistle and just
[1:01:23] bubble dancing
[1:01:25] and to do that it takes us to mature in
[1:01:27] the first principles to say this is why
[1:01:29] he's given it this is why we have it so
[1:01:31] he says by their fruit you will know
[1:01:33] them you'll know when there's a fruit
[1:01:35] that is produced that is connected with
[1:01:37] the real nature of the cause the purpose
[1:01:40] of the cause
[1:01:43] you know somebody has read the oil can
[1:01:45] right
[1:01:48] when they say hey will you hold this for
[1:01:50] me I don't want to get oil everywhere so
[1:01:51] here let me just pour it for you
[1:01:54] smooth right just
[1:01:57] and they do like those teas that they do
[1:01:59] in India right
[1:02:00] because they know how to pour it
[1:02:05] in Hebrews chapter 6 verses 7 and 8 this
[1:02:07] just repeats this for the Earth which
[1:02:09] drinketh in the rain that cometh offon
[1:02:11] it
[1:02:12] and the Earth drink and in Rain brings
[1:02:15] forth herbs meat for them by whom it is
[1:02:17] dressed
[1:02:18] receive a blessing from God
[1:02:21] so it's in that producing this one
[1:02:23] Brothers is by the fruits you'll know
[1:02:24] them so the rain falls on the just and
[1:02:28] the unjust God Let the Rain Fall it
[1:02:31] produces Joy on both but it's only going
[1:02:34] to produce the original seed on one
[1:02:39] and he says it bringeth forth herbs meet
[1:02:40] for them by whom it is dressed receiveth
[1:02:42] blessing from God but that which is
[1:02:44] beareth thorns and Briars is rejected
[1:02:46] and is nine to curse and whose end is to
[1:02:48] be burned but yet coming from the same
[1:02:49] Earth growing by the same principles of
[1:02:52] Light and Water germatite being
[1:02:54] germanized it's growing but it's only
[1:02:56] can manifest so much as a briar thorn in
[1:03:00] a thistles he says it's rejected to nine
[1:03:02] to cursing whose end is to be burned so
[1:03:04] if I could say it this way when Jesus
[1:03:06] the rain falls on the just and the
[1:03:08] unjust but the rain has a specific
[1:03:10] purpose
[1:03:12] and there can be General benefits that
[1:03:15] come from the rain falling but it has a
[1:03:18] specific purpose
[1:03:19] it if we go back to and again this is
[1:03:21] where maybe I wish I had better examples
[1:03:23] homework assignment you find a better
[1:03:25] example than the three I used for this
[1:03:27] you're using it wrong
[1:03:30] that yeah you're getting something from
[1:03:32] it and it works great but that's
[1:03:34] actually not a door stop you can use it
[1:03:36] this way you can use it that way it has
[1:03:38] this function it has that function and
[1:03:40] there's a way we need to recognize oh
[1:03:42] there's so much more to this and I don't
[1:03:44] want to just get this and that and have
[1:03:46] the bubble dance and the shouting the
[1:03:48] dancing but when you recognize what the
[1:03:50] rain is really for then it can actually
[1:03:52] bring forth The Original Seed it can
[1:03:54] actually bring forth the fruit that the
[1:03:56] rain is specifically targeting all
[1:03:59] foreigns will grow weeds Will shout
[1:04:01] cockerborough will dance but the rain is
[1:04:03] specifically for the Original Seed
[1:04:09] it's part of God's design
[1:04:12] it's part of God's cause and effect
[1:04:16] where you have the seed
[1:04:18] and you have the fruit
[1:04:20] and it becomes food and God has a cause
[1:04:22] and effect he doesn't want the his
[1:04:24] Reigns just not falling to make it muddy
[1:04:26] the rain's not falling just so that the
[1:04:28] the plants Rejoice is to come spring
[1:04:30] forth fruit
[1:04:33] in the sermon excuse me not in the
[1:04:35] sermon
[1:04:36] in the scripture there's several
[1:04:37] scriptures that I bypassed today maybe
[1:04:39] we picked them up on Wednesday night
[1:04:40] Paul is talking about you you talk about
[1:04:43] a joy in one another and God talks about
[1:04:45] rejoicing in you and joy is actually
[1:04:48] used in the New Testament in the sense
[1:04:49] of
[1:04:50] the cause or occasion for joy
[1:04:54] this is how even the beginning this is
[1:04:56] what I was studying it from last week
[1:04:57] the cause of Joy the occasion of joy
[1:04:59] so it's Joy not for the sake of joy
[1:05:03] but joy that's connected to a greater
[1:05:05] purpose
[1:05:06] in the same way that love and Ophelia
[1:05:08] love that's love that's just of the base
[1:05:10] sentiments and feelings and emotions but
[1:05:12] then there's agape love which is love of
[1:05:14] a higher intelligence
[1:05:15] they're talking about I love
[1:05:18] a joy that is
[1:05:21] rooted in the cause
[1:05:26] that that is that has its connection it
[1:05:29] understands cause and effect
[1:05:31] and because of that it's not just the
[1:05:33] product itself but it understands what
[1:05:35] it's a part of
[1:05:37] it in Luke chapter 10 verse 20 it says
[1:05:38] notwithstanding in this Rejoice not that
[1:05:40] the spirits are subject unto you he'd be
[1:05:43] given them power to cast out he says
[1:05:44] Rejoice not that the spirits are subject
[1:05:46] unto you but rather rejoice
[1:05:48] because your names are written in heaven
[1:05:50] go ahead there's another homework
[1:05:51] assignment just run that out and start
[1:05:53] thinking about that the rejoicing and
[1:05:55] the praise again here's a place where he
[1:05:56] says Rejoice not in other words if you
[1:05:59] got happy because demons were subject to
[1:06:01] you and you got happy because you could
[1:06:02] cast out spirits and you were getting
[1:06:03] happy because you could lay hands on the
[1:06:05] sick and they recover and that was the
[1:06:07] reason for your joy he's saying don't do
[1:06:10] it you've got a greater cause for Joy
[1:06:13] you've got a ray a greater reason for
[1:06:15] Joy because your names are written in
[1:06:17] heaven and that's the real core that he
[1:06:20] wants you to have your joy from
[1:06:23] because your names are written in heaven
[1:06:25] and in the book of Nehemiah chapter 8
[1:06:28] verse 10 we're just going to catch this
[1:06:29] last phrase of chapter verse 10 and
[1:06:33] maybe we'll amplify this greater in the
[1:06:34] next couple before this month is over
[1:06:36] then here he says then he said unto them
[1:06:38] go your way and this this might as well
[1:06:40] be my scripture for this holiday season
[1:06:42] eat the fat and drink the sweet
[1:06:48] and get me excited
[1:06:50] eat the fat and drink the sweet could
[1:06:52] anybody print that out on a nice
[1:06:54] hipster-looking Pinterest instagrammy
[1:06:57] thing so I can put it in my
[1:06:59] uh guest bathroom
[1:07:02] some nice pastels it says eat the fat
[1:07:05] and drink the sweet
[1:07:07] make a t-shirt
[1:07:10] and send portions into them for whom
[1:07:12] nothing is prepared the connections to
[1:07:14] this are so beautiful go back and read
[1:07:15] it we want to go into it deeper
[1:07:17] we're going to do it today and this felt
[1:07:18] led just to lay more detailed Foundation
[1:07:22] for this day is Holy unto our Lord
[1:07:25] neither be you sorry
[1:07:28] for the joy of the Lord is your strength
[1:07:33] I hope this phrase means something
[1:07:34] totally or means more not totally
[1:07:36] different but just like wow just a
[1:07:38] little bit more of an understanding the
[1:07:41] joy of the Lord is your strength
[1:07:44] so there this the joy of the Lord and
[1:07:46] even the joy of Salvation then
[1:07:49] are not just an emotional effect
[1:07:53] but it becomes cause and effect
[1:07:58] in other words where a fact is something
[1:08:00] that to have a fact it means to have an
[1:08:04] influence on uh to make a difference to
[1:08:08] so this is not just joy for the sake of
[1:08:11] Joy but this is Joy with the power
[1:08:12] itself
[1:08:14] this is joy that creates this domino in
[1:08:16] the Quantum of physics and there's a lot
[1:08:19] of theories now to where there's they're
[1:08:21] looking at it and and it's fun just to
[1:08:22] read how their heads are spinning and
[1:08:24] trying to figure it out but we say you
[1:08:25] have cause and effect but they say that
[1:08:27] there is they have this Theory when the
[1:08:29] effect actually becomes the cause
[1:08:31] and and as we talked about feedback
[1:08:33] loops in Christ my healer and that
[1:08:35] there's the negative feedback loops that
[1:08:37] can be very detrimental but there's a
[1:08:39] way where you get the Dynamo going right
[1:08:41] and that begins to spin and it's this
[1:08:44] omnipotence meeting and it creates this
[1:08:46] eternal energy that'll never stop
[1:08:47] perpetual motion
[1:08:49] because they're feeding off each other
[1:08:50] the right way here is a cause and effect
[1:08:53] Joy then
[1:08:56] becomes a cause when it's affected
[1:09:00] correctly
[1:09:02] that there's that when when the joy is
[1:09:05] the joy that God intends
[1:09:07] when the joy is the joy of the Lord when
[1:09:10] the joy is the joy of Salvation it's a
[1:09:13] joy that isn't just merely temporary
[1:09:15] but it's immutable from the cause it's
[1:09:18] it's indivisible from that which is
[1:09:21] spawned it and spurred it you can have
[1:09:22] the spirit of God moving a service and
[1:09:24] everyone ah and run themselves right out
[1:09:26] of the word of God but a joy that comes
[1:09:28] that you cannot Divide from the thing
[1:09:30] which caused it
[1:09:33] where I'm not just impersonating the
[1:09:35] fruits of the spirit I'm not just
[1:09:37] rejoicing because demons are subject to
[1:09:39] the name of Jesus but that I actually
[1:09:41] have my name joined together with his
[1:09:44] and it's an indivisible Union
[1:09:48] and this is the Revelation from which
[1:09:50] I'm stimulated where it's cause and
[1:09:52] effect
[1:09:54] that's Joy is more than just a human
[1:09:55] emotion
[1:09:59] the joy of the Lord then think of the
[1:10:00] joy of the Lord
[1:10:02] it's when your joy
[1:10:04] you rejoice in your pleasure
[1:10:06] is in the Lord
[1:10:09] see when he says the joy of the Lord is
[1:10:10] your strength is this is where you see
[1:10:12] if you could have just said this at
[1:10:13] about
[1:10:14] 10
[1:10:15] 10 40. like we we could have we really
[1:10:17] could have left
[1:10:19] but you have god let's say god pushing
[1:10:22] right
[1:10:24] God moving and joy
[1:10:27] right
[1:10:29] and there's this Joy that's not when
[1:10:31] when Nehemiah said oh don't be sorry
[1:10:33] feast and rejoice he's not saying This
[1:10:36] Joy you have is your strength he's
[1:10:38] saying the pleasure and joy you have in
[1:10:40] the Lord the one that's doing the
[1:10:41] pushing
[1:10:42] the one that's doing the inspiring the
[1:10:44] one that's doing the moving you join in
[1:10:46] him
[1:10:48] is your strength that's your strength
[1:10:51] when your joy is in him not when he's
[1:10:54] making you happy that's your strength
[1:10:55] but when your satisfaction your pleasure
[1:10:58] your joy your worth your value is in him
[1:11:01] not when you base your value on whether
[1:11:03] or not you danced you shouted you laid
[1:11:05] hands on the sick you manifested this
[1:11:06] and you manifested that but when my joy
[1:11:08] comes from him
[1:11:10] that's where there's real power
[1:11:12] that's when that's why we got to be
[1:11:14] careful not only not to rejoice when
[1:11:16] your enemies fall but be very careful
[1:11:18] that you don't zip your lip when the
[1:11:19] blessings are falling because when the
[1:11:21] blessings are fallen on others and this
[1:11:23] church is having a Revival and people
[1:11:24] are being healed and the gifts are
[1:11:26] manifested that's like my God that's
[1:11:28] what the spirit of God will do and you
[1:11:30] find your joy in him that's doing the
[1:11:32] moving not in the movement
[1:11:35] tearing down palm trees taking your
[1:11:38] clothes off but not being happy in the
[1:11:40] Messiah
[1:11:41] that's from whom my joy comes from
[1:11:44] the joy of the Lord is when your joy is
[1:11:46] in the Lord not just the joy he gives
[1:11:48] the joy of Salvation it's not the joy
[1:11:51] that's only caused by salvation but it
[1:11:53] is in Salvation
[1:11:56] it is in it
[1:11:58] that's where it is
[1:12:00] where I'm now no longer I've not taken a
[1:12:03] litmus test every day well are you happy
[1:12:05] are you excited little Melancholy today
[1:12:06] brother Aaron do you need to take your
[1:12:07] Boost Barone whatever you need to get
[1:12:08] this you take this you get on some
[1:12:10] uppers there you need some more caffeine
[1:12:11] how about a
[1:12:13] uh orange sickle rain or some whatever
[1:12:16] that flavor is that I thought was just a
[1:12:18] fun flavored drink one time at Luke's
[1:12:20] office
[1:12:23] I think I'm still working off of that
[1:12:24] and it's been months
[1:12:29] this is this is your joy
[1:12:31] I'm not basing it on all these Natural
[1:12:34] Things
[1:12:35] do you have salvation
[1:12:37] that's my joy
[1:12:39] that's my pleasure
[1:12:41] that's my excitement
[1:12:43] that's my enthusiasm not what it brings
[1:12:46] but it itself
[1:12:49] it's forever leaked to the cause
[1:12:53] where the fruit is pointing back to the
[1:12:55] seed
[1:12:57] not where all of a sudden ah yeah yeah
[1:12:59] yeah but Brother Band said spoken words
[1:13:01] The Original Seed it's not just yeah
[1:13:02] yeah yeah yeah but it's coming back what
[1:13:04] caused it
[1:13:05] why are we here what are the first
[1:13:07] principles
[1:13:08] Psalms 35 9 says and my soul shall be
[1:13:10] joyful in the Lord not my soul will be
[1:13:13] happy because the Lord made me happy but
[1:13:16] it will be joyful in the Lord you're
[1:13:18] finding your constant you're finding
[1:13:19] your absolute you're making this
[1:13:21] determination that he is my joy he is my
[1:13:24] happiness he is my pleasure not he gives
[1:13:27] me pleasure he makes me happy he is my
[1:13:30] happiness he is my joy he is my peace
[1:13:34] my soul shall be joyful Lord and it
[1:13:36] shall rejoice in his
[1:13:40] salvation
[1:13:43] what is our cause for joy
[1:13:46] Brothers if he'd come
[1:13:48] what is our
[1:13:51] what is our reason
[1:13:53] I even ask this what salvation are you
[1:13:55] rejoicing in
[1:13:59] a Stan
