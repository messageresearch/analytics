[0:00] revelations chapter 22
[0:02] verse 17
[0:04] and the spirit and the bride say come
[0:08] and let him that heareth say come
[0:11] let him that has a thirst come and
[0:14] whosoever will let him take the water of
[0:16] life freely very short verse so we'll
[0:19] read it again
[0:21] and the spirit and the bride say come so
[0:23] they're saying it together this is
[0:24] something
[0:25] that is not only the spirit is speaking
[0:27] but the bride is speaking also and let
[0:30] him that heareth and heareth what the
[0:32] spirit is speaking and what the bride is
[0:33] speaking let him say come
[0:36] let him that is a thirst come and
[0:37] whosoever will let him take the water of
[0:40] life freely god bless you you could take
[0:42] your seats
[0:44] i'm just going to jump right into it
[0:46] this mo this evening i'm continuing on
[0:49] the subject that we are ministering on
[0:51] sunday on the bride's advocacy
[0:54] we are looking specifically at our
[0:56] individual advocacy as members of the
[0:58] body of christ
[0:59] and we read a lengthy statement from the
[1:01] church age book where brother branham is
[1:02] talking about once again there is a
[1:04] people in the land who under their
[1:06] messenger will be the final voice to the
[1:08] final age
[1:10] and kind of the what we were tracking in
[1:12] brother branham's thought is how that in
[1:14] each age there were those who god used
[1:17] to speak on his behalf he used these
[1:19] messengers and that they spoke on god's
[1:22] behalf but then there's a point where
[1:24] they denominate and they take their own
[1:25] ideas and they base their their beliefs
[1:28] on the word of god it's not the word of
[1:29] god but it's beliefs that are based on
[1:31] the word of god and because they've
[1:34] moved away from the word as their true
[1:36] center their true north is their
[1:37] absolute then god can no longer use them
[1:39] as a mouthpiece because they only become
[1:42] advocates for what they believe for
[1:43] their church and adding members to their
[1:46] organization or those that will accept
[1:48] their interpretation of the scripture
[1:51] and so as that was the the that was the
[1:54] context for brother branham saying once
[1:56] again there'll be there's a people in
[1:58] the land who under their messenger are
[2:00] the final voice to the final age so we
[2:03] could say the bride or we could even say
[2:05] it using the scriptural terminology of
[2:07] the body of christ the body of christ is
[2:10] the final voice to the final age
[2:13] now if you're members of that then you
[2:15] have a voice you have a part in that you
[2:17] are you can't have everyone as members
[2:19] of the body of christ not having a voice
[2:21] but then the body have a voice there has
[2:23] to be an individual responsibility or
[2:26] manifestation of that voice within the
[2:29] body
[2:30] and really
[2:31] as i've pondered this it's really helped
[2:33] me to understand
[2:35] more vividly and much more richly maybe
[2:37] even a way that uh
[2:39] finally beginning to understand what it
[2:40] means to be the final voice because we
[2:42] say well the final voice is maybe just
[2:44] parodying what a prophet said or just
[2:45] repeating what a prophet said and we
[2:47] realized that really wouldn't tell the
[2:48] whole story that really wouldn't exhaust
[2:51] the ministry or exhaust what god means
[2:53] by the final voice and so we're looking
[2:55] at this and it's become very inspired to
[2:57] me that we are the final voice
[3:00] and just as brother branham said the
[3:02] church is no longer god's mouthpiece it
[3:04] says they are their own
[3:05] mouthpiece that means they speak for
[3:07] their own ideas their own uh desires
[3:10] their own ambitions their own goals i
[3:12] could say that we are god's mouthpiece
[3:15] the church is no longer god's mouthpiece
[3:17] but we are god's mouthpiece and
[3:19] therefore we have a responsibility to
[3:21] speak on behalf of the word
[3:24] because that's what a mouthpiece is they
[3:25] speak on behalf of someone else and so
[3:27] if the church is no longer god's
[3:29] mouthpiece then we have a responsibility
[3:31] to speak on behalf of the word and let
[3:34] me say this not only on behalf of the
[3:36] word but as the word
[3:38] we must be speaking and in mark chapter
[3:40] 16 verse 15 jesus said go ye and told
[3:43] the world and preach the gospel to every
[3:46] creature
[3:47] i believe we ought to ponder this phrase
[3:49] preach the gospel we know that not all
[3:51] of us will have pulpit ministries as a
[3:53] matter of fact the large majority almost
[3:54] all of us will not have a pulpit
[3:56] ministry but yet we could say that we
[3:58] are under this great commission to
[4:00] preach the gospel to every creature so
[4:03] we ought to ponder what it means to
[4:04] preach the gospel and ask ourselves how
[4:07] can i preach the gospel without
[4:09] necessarily sitting down taking a text
[4:11] and explaining something in the
[4:12] scripture or or taking quotes and
[4:15] different things and trying to share
[4:16] doctrine or share theology
[4:18] i can preach the gospel and then also in
[4:21] pondering that ask ourselves really
[4:23] begin to understand
[4:25] in a greater way the importance of
[4:27] preaching the gospel
[4:28] i had the scripture in my notes and i
[4:30] removed many things from my notes
[4:32] tonight but jesus said the gospel must
[4:34] be preached into all the world and then
[4:36] the end will come
[4:37] so really if we wanted to identify a
[4:39] very strict scriptural
[4:41] component of the end and the translation
[4:43] the change of our bodies and the meeting
[4:45] of the lord in the air this gospel has
[4:46] to be preached into all the world it has
[4:48] to go into all the world it has to be
[4:49] preached and then the end can come this
[4:52] change can come
[4:53] and so with the great commission as we
[4:56] take this scripture and we take derive
[4:58] this phrase from it this is the great
[5:00] commission and even the scriptures
[5:02] following a commission means there's
[5:03] been some authority entrusted to someone
[5:06] else so you may have you have might have
[5:08] an authority and if you commission
[5:10] somebody you convey that authority to
[5:12] somebody else or you entrust that
[5:13] authority to someone else so we have
[5:15] been commissioned there's been a
[5:17] delegated authority there's been a
[5:18] delegated power to you as a believer and
[5:21] we must fulfill this great commission
[5:24] are you with me so far
[5:26] i know i'm going a little fast but i'm
[5:27] excited tonight
[5:28] so i want to give the
[5:30] review again on advocacy we spoke on the
[5:33] bride's advocate now we've transitioned
[5:35] to the bride's advocacy and advocacy is
[5:39] the act of pleading for supporting or
[5:41] recommending something what's important
[5:44] to the act so it's active support to
[5:46] advocate for something means to argue
[5:48] for it to recommend it or to support it
[5:51] and we looked at how that advocacy is
[5:54] that combination of ad which is two and
[5:57] then vocacy vocacy however you want to
[5:59] say it vacancy is is to voice to say
[6:02] something so it's advocacy is to voice
[6:04] so it has something to do with the voice
[6:06] when the bible when we're taught that
[6:07] we're the final voice to the final age
[6:09] we're the final advocates for the truth
[6:11] we're the final advocates for we're the
[6:13] final way the final opportunity to hear
[6:16] truth and to be saved and so in the
[6:18] latin the word advocate comes from stems
[6:21] from advocare which means to call
[6:24] or to summon or to invite
[6:26] and we arrived at that sunday morning to
[6:28] identify that our advocacy isn't in the
[6:31] explanation of something or isn't in the
[6:34] in the defense or the apologetics of the
[6:36] message but it is actually
[6:38] enlarged
[6:40] in large part inviting people to come
[6:42] and to know christ to advocate is to
[6:44] invite to summon to call to someone so
[6:48] we identified in the scripture even here
[6:49] in revelations chapter 22 that our
[6:51] advocacy has come
[6:53] what are we inviting someone to come
[6:55] we're asking someone to come uh to this
[6:57] route and offspring of david this bright
[6:59] and morning star we're saying come to
[7:02] christ come to this fountain come
[7:04] inexhaustible supply of joy and life and
[7:07] rest and peace
[7:10] ministry of jesus christ the disciples
[7:12] said come and see
[7:14] it wasn't just in the explanation of it
[7:16] in the identifying the scriptures of it
[7:18] but ultimately no matter how much you
[7:20] could describe it know how much you how
[7:21] much you could explain it no matter how
[7:23] much you could tell somebody what it
[7:24] entails ultimately you want someone to
[7:26] come and experience it themselves
[7:29] we've all been somewhere and done
[7:30] something and experienced something
[7:33] where we tried to explain it and
[7:34] ultimately said you just got to see it
[7:36] for yourself
[7:37] you just need to partake of it yourself
[7:38] and that ultimately ought to be what we
[7:40] desire for every single person that we
[7:42] witness to is not so much accept what
[7:45] i'm saying to be truth but experience
[7:47] what i've experienced for yourself
[7:50] and that's what advocacy is we advocate
[7:52] we say come come and see on behalf of
[7:54] christ not our own interest
[7:57] we don't advocate so that we can say oh
[7:59] look i invited some of the church and we
[8:00] get a bible we get a star next to our
[8:02] name or are there something that we gain
[8:04] and benefit from it ourselves but we do
[8:05] it for the cause of christ
[8:09] advocacy is defined as public support
[8:11] for or recommendation of a particular
[8:14] cause or policy this would be more of a
[8:17] book definition of it public support for
[8:19] a policy public recommendation of a
[8:21] particular cause notice that it's public
[8:25] you cannot be an advocate and be silent
[8:28] you cannot be hidden you cannot be
[8:29] secret and be a supporter be an advocate
[8:31] advocacy requires active support
[8:34] advocate advocacy requires public
[8:36] support and so we realize that we have a
[8:38] deeply personal and intimate
[8:40] relationship with christ and that
[8:42] relationship is private
[8:44] that relationship is in secret and the
[8:46] things that he shares with us i was
[8:47] looking this week into the scripture how
[8:49] that jesus used this method of parables
[8:52] to the world but spoke plainly to the
[8:54] disciples
[8:55] and the parables themselves are meant to
[8:57] convey revelation but as the truth would
[9:00] be accepted or the parable would uh
[9:02] could dawn upon someone's heart christ
[9:04] then explained the parable
[9:07] to the disciples and that i recognize
[9:09] that is myself as the element of
[9:11] revelation there can be something public
[9:13] but then christ wants to reveal the
[9:15] meaning to that of that to you
[9:17] personally and privately so we have this
[9:20] private meeting this secret place and
[9:22] we're met with christ in that secret
[9:23] place and we commune with christ in that
[9:25] secret place and it's not a public show
[9:28] but the what begins to take place in
[9:30] that secret place and what transpires in
[9:32] our hearts there's an accounting of it
[9:34] there's an expression of it there's a
[9:36] testimony after afterwards when we're
[9:38] given an account in some way to express
[9:41] and to advocate for what took place in
[9:43] that secret place
[9:45] and so with this relationship with
[9:47] christ comes the responsibility to
[9:50] advocate publicly for christ
[9:53] this is a responsibility to advocate
[9:55] publicly for christ and i realize that
[9:57] the language i'm using may be
[10:00] it may not be familiar to us in the
[10:02] message the terminologies that i'm using
[10:06] but let's not maybe the semantics may be
[10:08] different but i hope you catch the real
[10:10] thought of what i'm trying to impress
[10:11] upon you that the final voice to the
[10:13] final age is something that's very
[10:15] precious and something very important
[10:17] and there is a public ministry that we
[10:20] share in as the bride of jesus christ
[10:23] now we'll step forward in this subject
[10:25] and look at first corinthians chapter 14
[10:26] verse 10.
[10:28] this scripture has a very important
[10:29] meaning and very particular meaning
[10:31] within the context of paul dealing with
[10:33] the gifts and the speaking in tongues
[10:35] and the interpretation thereof
[10:37] and he's
[10:38] acknowledging that if a barbarian or
[10:40] just a stranger would walk into a
[10:41] service and everyone was kind of
[10:42] speaking in different tongues it
[10:44] wouldn't convey anything to the here
[10:46] that would benefit them said actually to
[10:48] the world you would kind of seem to be
[10:49] crazy he said so i'd rather speak things
[10:51] plainly and clearly to the edifying of
[10:53] the body than to speak in a bunch of
[10:55] tongues and
[10:57] and i don't mean that in the slight but
[10:58] to speak in tongues and speak in an
[11:00] unknown language so it's kind of the
[11:01] context of what he's speaking about in
[11:03] terms of languages and the tongues and
[11:05] being interpreted but he says there are
[11:07] it may be so many kinds of voices in the
[11:11] world and none of them is without
[11:13] signification
[11:14] and this voice is it's um articulated
[11:17] speech it has to do with tongues or
[11:19] languages there are so many different
[11:21] languages in the world and none of them
[11:23] are without signification in that every
[11:26] language and in every language every
[11:28] word has a meaning
[11:30] and and that word has an idea attached
[11:32] to it so there's many different
[11:34] languages many different tongues many
[11:36] different ways of expressing thoughts
[11:37] and feelings and ideals in the world and
[11:40] all these languages have this distinct
[11:42] meaning they have a significance to its
[11:44] use
[11:45] and we understand that language and i'm
[11:47] just going to
[11:48] look at this very quickly move on from
[11:49] it maybe visit it again in the future
[11:51] language is expressive of culture
[11:55] is expressive of beliefs as a matter of
[11:57] fact i thought about it today that uh
[12:00] it was at one time i believe if you
[12:01] spoke english they probably would just
[12:03] assume you were a christian
[12:04] because of the uh the crusades of the of
[12:07] the christian church and the uh and the
[12:10] spread of the gospel through the united
[12:12] kingdom and even in america and there
[12:13] would be this assumption that if you
[12:14] spoke english you were probably a
[12:16] christian or to the greater uh the
[12:18] chances were that you were a christian
[12:20] so even language can be associated with
[12:21] beliefs and convictions in ideology and
[12:24] religion and that's what language would
[12:27] express it's connected with those things
[12:29] and as i've thought upon it there's
[12:31] certain words or phrases and a language
[12:33] that could be used that identify
[12:35] specific groups
[12:37] even to where with when it comes to um
[12:40] computer science and software
[12:42] engineering and programming and coding
[12:44] that there's languages that are used and
[12:46] to use a terminology and phrases and
[12:48] even sometimes cliches or or slang
[12:51] that's related to that industry anybody
[12:53] outside of it would have no no idea what
[12:54] you're talking about
[12:56] no clue whatsoever is being meant uh by
[12:58] that phrase but to someone who's in that
[13:00] group in that in that discipline it
[13:02] would have very distinct meaning to them
[13:05] and that's what paul is even referring
[13:07] to there's so many kinds of voices in
[13:09] the world and none of them are without
[13:11] signification so your voice has
[13:13] significance
[13:15] your voice ought to be clear not to have
[13:17] meaning not to be conveying something
[13:19] not that everyone would begin to
[13:21] uh agree with you let alone understand
[13:23] you there has to be there should be some
[13:24] meaning and thought behind what is being
[13:27] said
[13:28] and we can say that today there are so
[13:30] many voices
[13:32] and those voices have meaning they have
[13:34] intent they have a purpose behind them
[13:36] that there's so many voices in the world
[13:39] today that can cloud our thinking
[13:42] so many ideas and things that can just
[13:44] be dropped in they get dropped into our
[13:46] spirit and so it could kind of cloud our
[13:47] thinking we have to fight through all
[13:49] these different voices to really hear
[13:50] the voice of god or to anchor into what
[13:52] would be a rational thought or the
[13:54] wisdom of the scripture and these not
[13:56] only cloud our thinking but it
[13:58] influences our thinking
[14:00] and remember that we are
[14:02] as believers and i think it was sister
[14:04] judy dilling that expressed it this way
[14:06] after the service sunday morning that we
[14:07] are spiritual amphitheaters
[14:10] that the word is spoken to our hearts it
[14:12] resonates within our hearts and then we
[14:13] ought to sound out the word
[14:16] the word by revelation is imparted into
[14:18] our souls and it sounds out from our
[14:20] beings and from our our members comes
[14:22] this expression the echoing of the word
[14:24] of god we ought to be that
[14:26] we're going to be the final voice to the
[14:27] final legs the word
[14:29] spoken to our souls and then it's going
[14:31] to be reverberated out through our lives
[14:34] now brother bennett makes this statement
[14:36] in voice of god in the last days and i
[14:39] was curious i don't know if maybe would
[14:40] know brother ernie if you would know but
[14:42] brother branham at the beginning of this
[14:43] message refers to brother garcia and it
[14:46] was at a spanish church apostolic church
[14:48] or apostolic tabernacle
[14:50] in in phoenix is that the the believers
[14:52] the garcias so praise the lord it's
[14:54] wonderful i was just reading that today
[14:56] and there's several maybe 11 different
[14:58] services that brother man preaches at
[15:00] the beginning there
[15:02] of 63 all of them right here in arizona
[15:05] phoenix most of them in phoenix and also
[15:07] tucson and mesa and this is notice the
[15:10] the emphasis here and today one reason
[15:13] that the church is in the condition that
[15:14] it's in
[15:16] is because there's so many voices
[15:19] the the condition of the church and we
[15:21] could begin to just use our our mind of
[15:23] what brother random identified as the
[15:25] condition of the church he even says in
[15:27] one place they're just dead
[15:28] so many other voices to attract the
[15:30] church from the voice of god
[15:32] so voices have an attraction they have a
[15:35] a distracting power
[15:37] they have an attracting power they're
[15:38] going to point to they're going to
[15:39] emphasize so that's what advocacy is
[15:41] they say come and see
[15:43] kind of like a uh somebody who's you
[15:45] know we realize that
[15:47] maybe happens to us or we did it one
[15:49] time i don't know if they still exist i
[15:50] don't go to malls very often but you'd
[15:51] see some head and they'd have a
[15:53] clipboard and they're going to want to
[15:54] sell you something or somebody's in a
[15:56] kiosk and when you see that they're kind
[15:57] of praying what do they want to do get
[15:59] your attention
[16:00] you want to try this lotion you want to
[16:01] try this you want to try that so you get
[16:02] on the phone and you pretend you're on a
[16:03] phone call
[16:05] and because they're going to try to get
[16:06] you they're going to try to snare you
[16:07] kind of trap you and bring you in and so
[16:09] these voices are trying to draw you and
[16:11] get your attention and and sell you
[16:13] something
[16:13] he says until it's very doubtful
[16:16] so many voices attract the attention of
[16:18] the church from the voice of god so it's
[16:19] very doubtful that many would hear the
[16:20] voice of god though it spoke right in
[16:22] the midst
[16:23] this is how strong these contrary voices
[16:25] are that it would be such a competition
[16:27] to the voice of god that we'd be more
[16:29] tuned into all these other voices and
[16:31] miss the voice of god they perhaps
[16:33] wouldn't even understand it because it
[16:34] would be a foreign thing to them
[16:37] they have got themselves so much
[16:38] centered on the voices of the day
[16:41] tuned into centered kind of
[16:44] listening to the prevailing voices of
[16:45] the day the dominant voices of the day
[16:47] through social media through the news
[16:48] through entertainment through society
[16:50] through all the different channels we
[16:51] kind of tune into the voices of the day
[16:53] and god is speaking over here but we're
[16:55] so centered on these other voices that
[16:58] this loses its distinction
[17:03] paragraph 28 he says there is so many
[17:05] other voices and if god
[17:07] promised he would give us that give us
[17:09] the voice of god give us the voice of
[17:10] truth and if other voices are contrary
[17:13] to the voice of god then it must be the
[17:14] voice of our enemy
[17:16] to confuse us that we would not
[17:19] understand the voice of god when it
[17:20] spoke
[17:21] this is extremely informative to us we
[17:23] could anchor on this and just take this
[17:25] as a real true principle into our hearts
[17:27] is that there's a voice of god today
[17:29] wanting to speak to us there's a voice
[17:31] of the word wanting to speak to our soul
[17:33] and there's many voices that are trying
[17:35] to distract you from it
[17:36] remember the believer is attracted to
[17:38] the word and distracted to by the world
[17:41] so we look at that distinction you at
[17:44] your core at your root you're attracted
[17:45] to the word you're not attracted to the
[17:47] world you're distracted by the world so
[17:49] if the world seems to have some pull on
[17:51] you it's a distraction because your true
[17:53] attraction the main attraction your life
[17:54] is the word so he's saying this there
[17:56] there might it must be a voice of the
[17:58] enemy to confuse us
[18:00] there's voices trying to confuse you get
[18:02] you riled up get you stirred up get you
[18:04] anxious and upset and and riled up to do
[18:07] something and sign a petition and get
[18:09] behind this and get behind that and
[18:11] it'll take you away from the voice of
[18:13] god
[18:14] paragraph 31 there's so many voices in
[18:17] the earth today that it is absolutely a
[18:19] hard thing because it deadens the voice
[18:21] of the supernatural
[18:23] this is the impact of so many voices and
[18:25] the time we're living in now there is or
[18:28] thousands and thousands tens of
[18:30] thousands hundreds of thousands of miles
[18:32] for us to be influenced by voices
[18:35] if you want to look at it through um
[18:37] the you know a plethora of uh
[18:39] musicians and and bands and music
[18:43] or look at it in the tens of thousands
[18:45] of podcasts that are available or
[18:46] youtube channels or instagram
[18:49] influencers and all these other ways
[18:51] that we can be hear these voices that
[18:53] are conveying something images convey a
[18:55] voice movies convey a voice and
[18:57] advertisements and radio personalities
[19:00] and political parties and
[19:02] the news all these different things can
[19:04] we just kind of let our minds broaden a
[19:05] little bit to think about all these
[19:07] different channels of voices
[19:09] that exist in the world today and that
[19:11] what happens is it deadens the voice of
[19:14] the supernatural
[19:16] there are so many intellectual voices
[19:18] great voices of mighty men who are
[19:20] intellectual that in their intellectual
[19:22] conditions even shake the nations
[19:25] they just not overnight people they're
[19:27] just not overnight people but they shake
[19:28] nations bring great organizations
[19:30] together great campaigns flowery and
[19:33] there's no doubt a very um
[19:35] a direct messaging there and he's
[19:37] identifying certain things but really
[19:39] these kind of dynamics exist today in
[19:41] the world today
[19:42] and a person would be a bit confused
[19:45] it's enough to confuse them of how that
[19:46] these things go on and prosper
[19:49] movements that prosper works that seem
[19:51] to be very
[19:52] successful and plentiful and uh uh very
[19:56] flowery very demonstrative he said these
[19:58] things may seem very confusing because
[20:00] they have a voice and they have a
[20:01] success that follows it he says and
[20:03] there's voices that raise up and do
[20:05] these things and it causes the voice of
[20:07] god to be placed way back somewhere the
[20:10] true voice of god
[20:12] so all these things kind of take the
[20:13] forefront they dominate they get the
[20:15] attention they get the news they get the
[20:16] light
[20:17] the squeaky wheel gets the grease as
[20:19] they say and so everyone's attention is
[20:20] drawn to those that are the loudest and
[20:22] those that are complaining and those
[20:24] that are advocating for certain things
[20:25] and
[20:26] and these issues get the forefront and
[20:28] they get our attention and then we're
[20:29] we're compelled as it were to take a
[20:31] side
[20:32] and these things cause the voice of god
[20:35] to be placed way back somewhere the true
[20:37] voice of god to lose its preeminence in
[20:40] our lives
[20:43] but jesus says in john chapter 10 verses
[20:45] 3 to 5
[20:46] to him speaking of the shepherd to him
[20:48] the porter openeth
[20:50] and he is the shepherd and so this
[20:51] speaks of the shepherd and the sheep
[20:52] hear his voice not the porter but the
[20:54] shepherd's voice they sheep hear his
[20:56] voice and he calleth his own sheep by
[20:59] name and leadeth them out
[21:00] so there's the voice of the shepherd
[21:02] that's going to identify call you and
[21:04] then the lead you out and there's going
[21:06] to be competing voices of the enemy to
[21:08] confuse you on the voice of the shepherd
[21:11] to confuse you to deaden to dull to
[21:13] cause it to go away back in the
[21:15] background to where there's so many
[21:16] voices speaking so many voices speaking
[21:19] and you're not in tune to it to where it
[21:20] dens it and it's drowned out by the
[21:22] noise they ever noticed how apparent
[21:24] many times could be in a situation where
[21:26] a lot of people are screaming or
[21:27] shouting a lot of commotion and chaos is
[21:29] going on but then just the cry of their
[21:30] child gets their attention
[21:32] how did you notice hey there's just
[21:34] something about that sound
[21:36] and there's things that you can be tuned
[21:37] into and a lot of things can be loud and
[21:39] chaotic and a lot of noise but you
[21:41] recognize a voice and you're real tuned
[21:43] into its cadence and it's it's tenor and
[21:45] it's sound and so you immediately click
[21:47] oh i know that voice so and so is in the
[21:49] service today by the way that they're
[21:50] singing or so and so said this i know
[21:52] exactly who that is and you know it by
[21:54] repetition
[21:56] you know by familiarity it has a sound
[21:58] to it it's distinct and you can't be
[22:00] fooled on it and this is what the world
[22:02] wants to do is to cause you maybe can't
[22:04] make them be quiet
[22:06] the voices aren't going to
[22:08] stop speaking but you can become so
[22:10] tuned into the voice of god that no
[22:12] matter how much they amplify their
[22:14] volume and their rhetoric and how loud
[22:16] it gets you're still tuned to the voice
[22:17] of god
[22:19] and he can lead you out
[22:21] verse 4 and when he putteth forth his
[22:22] own sheep he goeth before them and the
[22:25] sheep follow him what is what is that is
[22:28] the characteristic that christ
[22:29] identifies that causes the sheep to
[22:32] follow for they know his voice
[22:34] you follow by the voice
[22:36] that's what they're tuned into that's
[22:37] what they're following it's a it's a
[22:39] it's a guidance it's the leadership by
[22:41] the voice
[22:42] and a stranger will they not follow
[22:45] so they follow the shepherd by virtue of
[22:47] his voice not just the figure moving in
[22:50] a particular direction but it must be
[22:52] the voice
[22:53] and knowing the voice tuned into the
[22:55] voice they then follow that leadership
[22:57] and a stranger will they not follow but
[22:59] they will flee from him
[23:01] but again what is the characteristic of
[23:03] the sheep that caused them to follow
[23:05] christ and to not follow a stranger to
[23:07] do only what christ says to do and to
[23:09] flee from a stranger for they know not
[23:11] the voice of strangers
[23:14] think about that this essential
[23:16] characteristic of sheep is can follow
[23:18] the true shepherd because they know his
[23:20] voice but if there's a strange voice
[23:22] that begins to try to lead they flee
[23:24] from it because they recognize that does
[23:26] not harmonize with the voice of christ
[23:29] so i would ask what voices are we
[23:31] hearing
[23:33] and in hearing voices do we recognize a
[23:35] stranger's voice
[23:37] and and our and what voice then that
[23:39] we're listening to are we echoing
[23:43] is what are we sounding out what voices
[23:45] are we listening to and being tuned into
[23:47] those voices confused by voices
[23:49] detracted by voices uh all these
[23:52] different ways that brother madam talks
[23:53] about these voices if we somehow get
[23:55] these rattling around in our mind do
[23:58] does do we become an echo of those
[24:00] voices or are we tuned into the voice of
[24:02] the shepherd and sounding out the voice
[24:04] of christ
[24:07] i know this will get all of y'all's
[24:08] attention today
[24:11] but how many have seen and not just yet
[24:12] there on this one brother john i'll cue
[24:14] it up in here a moment have driven
[24:16] around and seen the we believe signs
[24:18] in people's yards anybody see them
[24:20] okay
[24:21] are just a few well maybe we all need to
[24:23] go to san diego
[24:26] but there's these we believe signs that
[24:28] are people are popping up in all sorts
[24:31] front yards you know in front of
[24:32] businesses in different places
[24:35] and it's these it says in this house we
[24:37] believe or we believe and they give a
[24:40] list of things that they believe and
[24:41] it's to show public support for a
[24:43] certain ethos a certain way of thinking
[24:45] a certain ideology a certain belief in
[24:47] certain lifestyles as i say we believe
[24:49] and then they kind of give this position
[24:51] statement of the things that they
[24:53] believe
[24:54] and having this in someone's front yard
[24:55] they're wanting to convey that those of
[24:57] us in this house stand for these
[25:00] principles
[25:01] and they might just be these one-liners
[25:03] but it conveys something and so this is
[25:05] one of the signs i think that's the most
[25:06] prevalent if you want to pull that one
[25:08] up there
[25:09] and it says in this house we believe
[25:12] black lives matter
[25:14] women's rights are human rights
[25:16] no human is illegal
[25:18] science is real
[25:20] love is
[25:21] kindness is everything is anybody do you
[25:24] remember seeing these now that we've
[25:25] shown you the graphic or you see maybe
[25:27] the bumper stickers
[25:30] um
[25:32] and you've seen it now as you look at
[25:33] this and don't get nervous or maybe you
[25:36] should
[25:38] i don't know maybe i don't want to
[25:40] sucker punch you but just open up your
[25:42] heart to receive from the lord
[25:45] we we we look at these ideals and
[25:47] immediately immediately we catch we get
[25:50] the point that there's political
[25:52] messaging that's taking place here
[25:54] as we read these things we recognize
[25:56] that there's a meaning to each one that
[25:58] these things have been there's there's
[26:00] ascribed meaning and ideology and
[26:02] motives and objectives and movements
[26:04] behind these things to our you know five
[26:06] years ago or 20 however long it would
[26:07] have been 10 years ago if we said if
[26:10] someone asked us does an
[26:11] african-american life matter oh yeah of
[26:13] course it does
[26:15] but this phrase takes on different
[26:16] meaning it takes on different weight and
[26:19] and uh and we as you continue women's
[26:21] rights are human rights and some of the
[26:23] signs maybe say feminism is for everyone
[26:25] and we realize that this is this is
[26:27] conveying a movement an ideology a
[26:29] thought process uh no human is illegal
[26:32] we recognize that what this is this is
[26:33] an opinion on immigration
[26:38] science is real this probably would be
[26:39] the most recent addition to it i don't
[26:42] know maybe it was a climate change
[26:43] platform it might need more now but love
[26:45] is love kindness is everything
[26:47] and when we look at this what have we
[26:49] all done we recognize these as liberal
[26:51] mantras right right that these things
[26:53] echo a liberal sentiment
[26:55] liberal political messaging or social
[26:57] messaging and these different things and
[26:59] some of you are not going to ask you to
[27:00] raise your hands or shout too loud uh
[27:03] some of these phrases might actually
[27:04] offend some of us
[27:07] nobody wanted to
[27:08] [Music]
[27:10] got that right brother aaron
[27:13] it'll offend us why it's not the phrase
[27:15] in itself it's everything that we
[27:17] associate with it
[27:19] and so this would be this would be a we
[27:21] believe sign in someone's front yard but
[27:23] there's also another sign out there
[27:26] and it is
[27:27] the next one we believe
[27:30] and i couldn't find any anybody's yard
[27:32] to take a picture of this in so it says
[27:34] we believe god created man and woman
[27:38] now what
[27:39] now notice the notice what's being said
[27:40] here man and woman love is sacrificial
[27:43] god created science not a few or some
[27:46] but all lives matter and unborn life is
[27:49] still a life helping the immigrant
[27:51] judging character not skin color
[27:54] respecting the law and the flag
[27:57] so this is this is another
[28:00] set of we believes
[28:02] but i want to ask you do you recognize
[28:04] the political message messaging in this
[28:05] just as much as you did the other yeah
[28:08] like we might read this read through
[28:09] this and record well yeah we know god
[28:10] created a man and a woman and we know
[28:12] that love is sacrificial and and god
[28:14] created science and after all scientists
[28:16] are just breaking into god's laboratory
[28:18] and we believe that life is precious and
[28:20] an unborn life is still alive and
[28:21] helping them judging character not skin
[28:23] color respecting the law and the flag
[28:25] maybe we lose a little bit of the
[28:26] christianity there
[28:28] and the flag but there's something
[28:29] that's being messaged here where we
[28:31] ought to be able to recognize these also
[28:34] are associated with conservative ideals
[28:37] and that there's republican or
[28:38] conservative political messaging that's
[28:40] taking place and really this yard sign
[28:43] is a rebuttal to the other one
[28:45] it's almost as if somebody walked out
[28:47] and was like
[28:49] honey did you see that got in their yard
[28:51] over there
[28:52] you're good on etsy find me one that can
[28:55] counter point that
[28:57] and they actually went out and had a
[28:58] rebuttal there's a point for point
[29:00] rebuttal
[29:01] in this yard sign versus the other
[29:04] so one one identifies one particular
[29:06] thought process platform and the other
[29:08] one represents the other platform
[29:11] and as we read this one we believe in
[29:13] god and god created science and unborn
[29:15] life is still alive and we realize that
[29:17] that would be
[29:18] the issue of abortion and
[29:21] and judging character not skin color
[29:23] might relate to affirmative action and
[29:25] respecting the law and then and the flag
[29:27] like you shouldn't kneel when the
[29:28] national anthem is played and all these
[29:30] different things they have this
[29:31] messaging this conservative ideology and
[29:35] some of them we may look at and say they
[29:36] appear and i'm using my language very
[29:38] carefully they appear to be based on the
[29:41] word
[29:43] right
[29:44] so it might very quickly kind of get our
[29:47] attention
[29:48] and then we feel like well if i had to
[29:50] take a side as a christian
[29:53] i would have to put this yard sign in my
[29:55] yard
[29:56] all right i'm like if you were forced
[29:58] you have to pick a sign you have to pick
[29:59] a sign you would maybe pick that sign
[30:02] but really we need to be very careful
[30:05] because there are a lot of things that
[30:07] appear to be based on the word but they
[30:09] do it in order to disguise strange
[30:11] voices
[30:12] to disguise strange voices as a familiar
[30:15] voice
[30:17] there is a there was a deliberate
[30:19] attempt
[30:20] there is a and continues to be a very
[30:22] deliberate attempt in politics to phrase
[30:25] things in such a way that it kind of
[30:27] scratches your your evangelical itch
[30:31] and to get your rancor up as a christian
[30:33] in order to motivate you and inspire you
[30:36] to advocate for political causes and
[30:39] platforms and then we think oh my this
[30:41] is i'm as a christian this is a
[30:43] challenge to my faith this is an affront
[30:45] to god it's like slow down a minute take
[30:48] a deep breath
[30:50] if we got that
[30:52] if we could just be i'm starting to get
[30:54] riled up my righteous indignation
[30:56] to think about we can get so riled up
[30:59] i'm really starting to lose it now and
[31:01] advocate for things because we feel that
[31:04] our faith is being challenged and that
[31:05] god is being affronted and we never we
[31:08] we would never do that about other
[31:09] things
[31:11] we've nev we haven't done that about
[31:13] other other things that are much more
[31:15] clear in the scripture much more
[31:16] precious to the heart of jesus christ
[31:18] and that's when you ought to take a step
[31:19] back and realize that there's voices
[31:21] that are strange voices that try to
[31:24] sound like the voice of the shepherd but
[31:26] in fact they're not
[31:29] this is my inspiration and the bride's
[31:31] advocacy i trust you're just really
[31:32] listening
[31:33] some of you might be thinking well at
[31:35] least you made it a year brother aaron
[31:37] took took you a year and you just
[31:40] dropped the bomb and
[31:44] but i would say when we begin arizona
[31:47] believers church
[31:48] the the the
[31:50] acronym abc
[31:52] i see some of these things are abc
[31:54] things
[31:55] and we never really studied that enough
[31:57] to really do the algebra but we try to
[31:58] talk algebra we tried to talk real
[32:01] spiritual and real deep and the truth is
[32:04] we were just putting our ankles in the
[32:05] kiddie pool
[32:08] this is where we begin to wade into deep
[32:09] waters when we come back to the
[32:11] foundation of christ
[32:13] the principles that the word advocates
[32:14] for
[32:15] it says in second corinthians chapter 11
[32:17] verses 13 to 15. notice this for such
[32:20] are false apostles deceitful workers
[32:22] transforming themselves into the
[32:24] apostles of christ they're going to
[32:26] speak on behalf of christ they're going
[32:28] to say that they're championing the
[32:31] things of christ and the things of god
[32:33] he says in no marvel for satan himself
[32:35] is transformed into an angel of light so
[32:37] there are those false apostles and
[32:39] deceitful workers that are going to use
[32:41] a language that seems to be akin to the
[32:43] language and principles of christ but
[32:45] they're doing it to deceive you
[32:48] strange voices meant to confuse and
[32:50] attract you away from the voice of god
[32:52] and cause them to deaden the voice of
[32:55] the supernatural to cause confusion and
[32:58] paul continues therefore it is no great
[33:00] thing that if satan is transformed into
[33:02] an angel of life if his ministers also
[33:04] be transformed as ministers of
[33:06] righteousness
[33:09] advocate witnesses proponents of the
[33:12] protagonist of righteousness and they
[33:14] appear to be advocating for in
[33:16] soliciting uh um
[33:19] righteous causes and eliciting your
[33:21] response and asking you to support it
[33:23] and getting you to sign up behind it and
[33:25] to really uh become a voice for it and
[33:28] throw your weight behind it but they can
[33:30] be angels
[33:31] transformed as ministers of
[33:32] righteousness as satan trans himself
[33:35] transforms himself into an angel of
[33:36] light
[33:39] i'd say
[33:43] that's an intriguing picture that's
[33:45] being painted
[33:49] i trust that you're staying with me
[33:50] tonight walking through this so this is
[33:53] my challenge i'd love to spend a lot
[33:55] more just on that we may do so in the
[33:58] future services just take those points
[34:00] we've just made right there and continue
[34:01] to amplify them with scripture and
[34:03] quotation
[34:04] over and over and over again because
[34:07] this subject runs very very there's a
[34:09] lot of quantity to this and a lot of
[34:10] depth to it in the word of god
[34:12] but my challenge is
[34:14] to first to ask ourselves what are we
[34:16] advocating for
[34:18] if we're the final voice to the final
[34:20] age what are we giving voice to
[34:23] what are we sounding out if we're
[34:25] amphitheaters what are we saying is it a
[34:26] carnal amphitheater are we sounding out
[34:28] merely carnal things or is there a
[34:30] spiritual amplification of the truth of
[34:32] the
[34:32] word it says in john 10 27 my sheep hear
[34:36] my voice and i know them and they
[34:39] follow me
[34:42] we are only sheep to christ
[34:46] right if we're going to be accused of
[34:48] being sheep the only shepherd that we
[34:50] are sheep to is christ
[34:52] it is his voice word that is our compass
[34:54] it is his voice word that is our guide
[34:57] and it's only in following the shepherd
[34:59] my sheep hear my voice and i know them
[35:01] and they follow me that's the only way
[35:03] that the gospel can truly be preached
[35:07] you cannot be on your own it cannot be
[35:09] your own inspiration it cannot be your
[35:11] own ambition it cannot be your own goals
[35:13] the great commission will only be
[35:14] fulfilled in heeding the voice of christ
[35:17] in following him
[35:19] that's how the great commission is
[35:20] fulfilled so he says my sheep hear my
[35:22] voice
[35:24] and
[35:25] i'm going to make a quick change here
[35:26] now this is my this is my link up my
[35:28] sheep hear my voice and they follow me
[35:32] now i want to allude to the fact that
[35:34] christ had a very public ministry
[35:36] had a and there was things he wasn't
[35:38] doing things in the corners we read
[35:39] before these things were done open not
[35:41] in secret not done in a corner so in a
[35:43] very public ministry and he's telling
[35:44] the disciples follow me
[35:46] and paul says in first corinthians
[35:48] chapter 11 verse 1 be ye followers of me
[35:51] even as i also am of christ
[35:54] so paul is saying that he was following
[35:56] christ and in following christ he set
[35:59] such an example that you could also
[36:01] follow him
[36:02] the that he was so faithful to the cause
[36:05] of christ and so faithful to christ in
[36:07] christ uh christ the revelation of
[36:10] christ and the theology and doctrine of
[36:12] christ that paul can say i faithfully
[36:13] followed christ so that if you follow my
[36:16] example you will also follow christ
[36:20] and i'm realizing now that i had i cut
[36:22] out first corinthians chapter 10 and i
[36:24] was wanting to read several verses at
[36:25] the end of first corinthians chapter 10
[36:27] because there's things that he's making
[36:28] statements he's making at the end of
[36:30] that chapter which he then concludes
[36:32] with
[36:33] uh be you followers of me as i also am
[36:36] of christ
[36:37] and maybe i'll just i'll just read one
[36:39] verse very quickly
[36:41] so that you can understand where i'm
[36:42] coming from in this
[36:45] as he says
[36:48] in verse
[36:50] first corinthians chapter 10 verse 33
[36:51] and i took all these took a page of
[36:53] notes out tonight so that we would uh we
[36:56] wouldn't be here more than a couple
[36:57] hours
[36:58] it says
[36:59] even as i please all men in all things
[37:02] not seeking my own prophet but the
[37:04] prophet of many that they may be saved
[37:06] wow be you followers of me all even also
[37:09] as i am of christ i notice that
[37:11] connection there
[37:13] he's expressing his
[37:15] his conviction the way his abiding
[37:17] principle in his life and he says that
[37:20] be followers of me even also as i am of
[37:22] christ
[37:23] now that what he's tracking here in
[37:24] first corinthians chapter 10
[37:26] verses 23 to 33 to all to the glory of
[37:29] god and he's saying follow me as i
[37:30] follow christ
[37:32] he is following in the example of christ
[37:34] by doing this and he touches on it also
[37:36] in chapter 9. and i have these verses
[37:38] available for you on the slide verse 19
[37:41] to 23 first corinthians chapter 9 verses
[37:44] 19 to 23 for though i be free from all
[37:47] men yet have i made myself servant unto
[37:50] all that i might gain the more
[37:53] ponder this very deeply paul is able to
[37:55] acknowledge that he is a servant to all
[37:57] but yet still a prisoner to christ
[38:00] a servant of christ that i may gain the
[38:02] more this is his it's very important to
[38:05] catch all the words that he's referring
[38:06] to here i may i become a servant to all
[38:09] with this purpose that i might gain the
[38:10] more and under the jews i became as a
[38:13] jew then i might gain the jews to them
[38:16] that are under the law as under the law
[38:18] then i might gain them that are under
[38:20] the law notice what he's saying then
[38:22] when he says that i might gain he said
[38:24] that i might we could previously that i
[38:25] might win them to christ
[38:28] to a jew i become a jew
[38:30] so that they can be one to christ to
[38:32] those that are under the law
[38:33] i also
[38:35] invite you act as though i am under the
[38:37] law but not that i just fit in i'm not a
[38:40] confrontationalist i don't like arguing
[38:42] he's saying that i might gain them win
[38:44] them to christ those that are under the
[38:45] law
[38:46] to them that are without law
[38:48] i
[38:50] also
[38:51] act as without law
[38:53] notice this tremendous parenthetical
[38:55] phrase here to help us understand what
[38:57] he means being not without law of god
[39:00] but under the law to christ
[39:02] he still could do these things catch
[39:04] this because this is my whole point this
[39:06] evening
[39:07] and it's very easy to unload it at this
[39:08] point paul is saying that i can be
[39:10] something to the jews i can be something
[39:12] to those under the law to those that are
[39:13] without the law but still remain under
[39:15] the law of christ
[39:18] that i might gain them that are without
[39:21] law
[39:23] to the weak become i as weak
[39:26] that i might gain the weak
[39:29] i am made all things to all men that i
[39:32] might by all means save some
[39:37] notice how tremendous this is i believe
[39:39] this is paul
[39:40] reflecting how he thought he's that
[39:43] reflecting how they he followed the
[39:45] example of christ
[39:47] he is emulating and walking in the steps
[39:49] of the shepherd my sheep know my voice
[39:51] and another they will not follow paul is
[39:53] following the voice of jesus christ in
[39:55] living and acting this way he's not
[39:57] deviating from the principles of christ
[39:58] he's actually following in the
[40:00] principles of christ to have this kind
[40:01] of thought process
[40:03] being very very careful verse 23 in this
[40:06] i do for the gospel sake that i might be
[40:09] partaker thereof with you
[40:11] so the reason why he was doing it was
[40:13] not to gain followers not to build a
[40:14] church not to have a name for himself
[40:16] not get get up a bunch of offerings or
[40:18] get a lot of followers on instagram or
[40:20] have have a lot of youtube subscribers
[40:22] have a big congregation he said i do all
[40:25] these things not to just be a chameleon
[40:27] and wishy-washy and not have a platform
[40:29] so that everyone just thinks i'm fine
[40:31] and when in rome do as the romans kind
[40:33] of theology said i do this for the
[40:35] gospel's sake
[40:37] are you following what paul is saying
[40:40] i am made all things to all men that i
[40:42] might by all means save some
[40:46] i have assumed every shape and form yet
[40:48] in doing so i've maintained faithless to
[40:50] the word of god and the nature of christ
[40:52] i've assumed different forms in certain
[40:54] settings and certain stations and i've
[40:56] taken on different shapes and had
[40:57] different conversations and attitudes
[40:59] and obey did certain things in the
[41:01] presence of certain people but all while
[41:03] doing it i remain faithful to the word
[41:05] of god and i've remained in the nature
[41:06] of christ
[41:08] one translation says i've given up my
[41:10] own will my own way my own comfort my
[41:12] own pleasure and my own prophet that i
[41:14] might save the souls of all
[41:18] knowledge paul was adapting
[41:20] wasn't very rigid and unbending and
[41:22] legalistic he was accommodating
[41:25] but this adapting and accommodation and
[41:27] this is my caution to you to adapt and
[41:29] to accommodate requires the goal he
[41:31] pursued
[41:32] can't leave from here so well i'm just
[41:34] going to accommodate and i'm just going
[41:35] to acquiesce and i'm going to adapt and
[41:37] i'm just going to fit in in every
[41:39] situation if you do it without the goal
[41:41] he had then it will not be a combination
[41:43] it'll be compromised
[41:46] because without compromise he
[41:48] accommodated he adapted because of the
[41:49] cut the goal he pursued and that was the
[41:51] salvation of the lost so he could not
[41:54] modify his position he could not change
[41:56] his state he couldn't be as without the
[41:58] law and or be as under the law or be as
[42:00] a jew or be as weak and then muddy and
[42:02] confuse the gospel of christ and then
[42:04] win them to it
[42:07] wait we can't go get we can't go get
[42:09] high
[42:11] and witness to everybody like hey man
[42:13] i'm just talking with you just because i
[42:14] want you to know about the love of jesus
[42:17] and the one the first thing you try to
[42:18] do is rip the bong out of their hand and
[42:20] smash it and say you shouldn't be
[42:21] getting high like man only found out
[42:23] about this when we were smoking
[42:26] and like now you're gonna try to take it
[42:27] away from me like well yeah i just did
[42:29] that and i might win you
[42:31] there's a there's a contradiction there
[42:34] there's there's a conflict in messaging
[42:35] there's something that's not lining up
[42:39] and so this is
[42:40] this is paul's uh
[42:43] unction
[42:45] it was not to get money it was not to
[42:47] gain influence it was not even to save
[42:48] his own life but to save the life of
[42:50] others
[42:52] and in doing so it really increased his
[42:54] labor
[42:56] it increased his discomfort
[42:59] he was not acting
[43:00] to make his life easier to avoid
[43:02] discomfort he's actually increasing his
[43:04] labor and making his life more
[43:05] uncomfortable
[43:07] but why was he doing it that he his
[43:08] gospel could be effective
[43:10] he says for the gospel sake in order to
[43:14] success to the utmost of his ability
[43:18] the for the gospel's sake i'm going to
[43:20] act a certain way for the gospel sake
[43:21] i'm going to do certain things for the
[43:22] gospel sake with that always in view and
[43:25] that before me that the gospel might be
[43:27] effective upon the sinner that the sick
[43:29] might be impacted by the word of god
[43:30] that the loss might be impacted by the
[43:32] word of god i'm going to find myself
[43:34] motivated by that in harmony with the
[43:36] character of christ that others might be
[43:38] impacted by this word that i've received
[43:41] and notice how he says that the gain of
[43:43] even some
[43:46] is worth the expenditure of all means
[43:49] he doesn't say that as we read it that
[43:52] i am made all things to all men that i
[43:54] might by all means save all people
[43:57] he just made by every effort by every
[43:59] means possible the expenditure and
[44:01] expense of all things and all means was
[44:04] worth it just to gain
[44:06] some wasn't made worth it if it was all
[44:09] but just some
[44:12] and he conformed himself
[44:14] to the feelings of others
[44:16] to he conformed himself to even the
[44:19] thoughts and convictions of different
[44:20] classes in order just to win some
[44:24] he knew he couldn't win them all but he
[44:26] wanted to win some
[44:28] i was going to i was going to go to
[44:30] first corinthians chapter 10
[44:33] and it go through that but i i'm going
[44:36] to hold i want to pick up on this
[44:37] thought right where we are now sunday
[44:39] morning
[44:40] and so the all of you who are here that
[44:42] will be back sunday morning
[44:44] you know you could kind of look at
[44:45] everybody else like
[44:47] are you getting this
[44:50] because i just want to pick right up in
[44:52] this
[44:55] i want to read this from the living
[44:56] bible the verses i just read verses 19
[44:58] to 23 from the living bible i don't have
[45:00] a slide for i don't think i have any
[45:01] more slides because i wanted you just to
[45:02] focus on these things the remainder of
[45:04] the service
[45:06] listen can you listen just for a few
[45:07] more moments it's 8 17 i walked up here
[45:10] at 8 25 it hasn't been an hour believers
[45:12] live for the after hour we're not even
[45:14] there yet
[45:16] he says when i am with the jews i see
[45:18] him as one of them so that they will
[45:19] listen to the gospel and i can win them
[45:21] to christ
[45:23] when i'm with gentiles who follow jewish
[45:25] customs and ceremonies i don't argue
[45:27] even though i don't agree
[45:29] because i want to help them
[45:31] when with the heathen i agree with them
[45:33] as much as i can except of course that i
[45:35] must also do what is right as a
[45:36] christian
[45:40] hey if you believe it just amen even
[45:42] more heartily
[45:44] and so then on sunday if somebody else
[45:46] doesn't amen we can go
[45:48] uh-huh
[45:49] all right listen he says i see him as
[45:51] one of the jews so they'll listen to the
[45:53] gospel and i can win them
[45:55] when i'm with the gentiles who still
[45:57] obey the law or who are under the law i
[45:58] don't argue with them
[46:00] i don't nitpick
[46:02] i don't pick a fight
[46:05] i don't challenge them to get into where
[46:07] we're head butting he goes i don't argue
[46:09] even though i don't agree because i want
[46:11] to help him
[46:12] he wants to keep that opportunity open
[46:14] doesn't want to alienate doesn't want to
[46:15] offend with the heathen i will agree as
[46:17] much as i possibly can except i will not
[46:20] do wrong by the word
[46:22] i'll agree as much as i can to the point
[46:24] to where i is right as a christian and
[46:27] don't think paul was soft and he didn't
[46:29] want confrontation paul rebuked peter
[46:30] when it was necessary
[46:32] to his face paul made sure we knew
[46:37] and so by agreeing notice as he agrees
[46:40] with the heathen so by agreeing i can
[46:42] win their confidence and help them too
[46:46] you really realize there's things that
[46:47] we can take issue with an exception with
[46:49] that will completely change our ability
[46:51] to impact the unbeliever and impart the
[46:54] gospel to them because we've took it
[46:56] aside we've taken a position and we've
[46:58] kind of muddied the waters of the gospel
[47:00] and muddy the waters of the truth that
[47:01] we hold and so they can't receive from
[47:04] us because they've just imagined the
[47:06] yard sign we have in front of our house
[47:08] even if it's not there
[47:14] when i am with those whose consciences
[47:16] bother them easily i don't act as though
[47:18] i know it all
[47:19] and don't say that they are foolish the
[47:22] result is that they are willing to let
[47:23] me help them
[47:25] because i don't belittle them and i
[47:26] don't make them feel foolish and though
[47:28] they may be offended very easily i don't
[47:30] act as if i know it all i don't make
[47:32] them feel fruitless or shamed or silly
[47:34] for feeling that way and the result is
[47:36] that they're willing to let me help them
[47:40] yes whatever person is like
[47:42] i try to find common ground with him
[47:45] so that he will let me tell him about
[47:47] christ and let christ save him
[47:50] that beautiful
[47:52] is it not does it not remind you of how
[47:54] brother branham taught us to witness
[47:57] if they like fish and talk to him about
[47:59] fishing
[48:00] and if you're like me that's all you
[48:01] ever wanted to talk about and you gotta
[48:03] remind us wait a minute we're fishers of
[48:05] men it sounds really disjointed because
[48:06] you've been talking about bass for 20
[48:08] minutes
[48:10] but he says just kind of catch their
[48:11] spirit find what interests them show an
[48:13] interest
[48:16] it's very noticeable when someone takes
[48:18] interest in you
[48:20] what they did and all what they think
[48:22] and what how their family is and this
[48:24] and they get competitive and what they
[48:25] said the borderline personality disorder
[48:28] is when people just can't rejoice in
[48:29] what other people are saying it's like
[48:31] well well
[48:32] i ran five miles this morning it's like
[48:34] well i did six and a half
[48:37] it's like well i've never ran a mile in
[48:39] my life i you know that i mean look at
[48:40] me i would i haven't i haven't the only
[48:42] thing i run do is the dinner table and
[48:45] they but they can't rejoice with you
[48:46] right they're just like they want to get
[48:48] competitive with it paul is describing a
[48:51] nature in a character
[48:54] that makes us that makes us salty
[48:57] this is the salt of the earth
[48:59] this is the light of the world this is
[49:02] the the example of the great shepherd
[49:05] this is the example of the chief
[49:06] shepherd this is what paul was talking
[49:08] about when he says follow me as i follow
[49:10] christ it was in these very specific
[49:12] characteristics
[49:15] i realize it's very important to take
[49:17] the whole
[49:18] uh what paul was talking about how all
[49:20] things are lawful but maybe not
[49:22] expedient and he deals with a lot of
[49:24] different things in this but i believe
[49:25] that we're well taught to where we can
[49:27] understand these things he's saying that
[49:28] i do this to get the gospel to them
[49:32] i find common ground with him so that he
[49:33] will let me help him about christ and
[49:36] let christ save them he says i do this
[49:39] for the gospel sake i do this to get the
[49:41] gospel to them and also for the blessing
[49:43] i myself receive when i see them come to
[49:45] christ
[49:48] this is powerful
[49:50] especially when you realize he continues
[49:52] it in chapter 10
[49:54] and he says but the prophet of why i do
[49:56] this
[49:58] is not seeking my own profit but the
[50:00] profit of many
[50:02] that they may
[50:04] be
[50:04] saved
[50:06] this is advocacy
[50:09] let me close with this
[50:11] the final voice
[50:13] is not our opinion
[50:17] it's not our personal preferences based
[50:20] on the word
[50:23] the final voice is the word
[50:26] it is the word in action
[50:28] if advocacy is public support it is
[50:30] active support
[50:31] the advocacy to voice the final voice is
[50:34] going to be the word and action a life
[50:36] lived by the word is the expressed
[50:38] and it's our public words and our public
[50:41] actions that become our voice
[50:45] it's what we express it's what we convey
[50:47] through all sorts of outlets and
[50:48] channels it's what we express openly in
[50:50] personal interactions it's what we post
[50:52] and express in social media channels
[50:54] it's the things we follow the things we
[50:56] support the things we subscribe to the
[50:58] things that we placard bumper sticker on
[51:00] our cars for what we vocalize what we
[51:02] tell others about what we forward what
[51:03] we text what we screenshot all these
[51:05] things are you hearing me
[51:07] all of it forms a persona all it forms a
[51:09] belief system all of it is shaping and
[51:12] writing on your yard sign saying in this
[51:15] person i believe and you're becoming a
[51:18] voice
[51:20] and it forms our public ministry it
[51:22] forms our advocacy
[51:25] paul said be ye followers of me even as
[51:27] i also am of christ
[51:30] and if you notice in this scripture
[51:31] there was a self-denial of paul paul had
[51:33] a self-denial paul had a moderation of
[51:35] opinion that sought one objective the
[51:38] promotion of the gospel
[51:40] and you talk about just a very a
[51:43] tremendous thing that when we can
[51:44] evaluate what we say and what we do and
[51:47] how we feel and and these things that
[51:50] though we might have personal opinions
[51:51] and convictions we say that i will not
[51:53] act in a manner that does not promote
[51:54] the gospel as a whole then that becomes
[51:56] something that can be a very good check
[51:58] to us
[52:00] as i've been studying i thought i was
[52:01] going to preach on it tonight and the
[52:02] lord has just kind of closed that door
[52:04] i've tried three three different times
[52:05] to preach on it but i've been studying
[52:07] the true identification the five
[52:09] definite identifications of the true
[52:11] church of the living god
[52:14] and and as i've been studying it and
[52:16] it's become so real to me how brother
[52:18] man identifies the true church
[52:21] and if there's a true church
[52:23] then no church should ever act
[52:26] advocate promote preach say or do
[52:29] anything that would harm the health of
[52:31] the true church
[52:34] you cannot act as a church
[52:37] that's preaching the word and preaching
[52:39] the truth but in what you're doing hurt
[52:42] or offend the true church
[52:44] i'm not opening the door lord i'm just
[52:46] saying what i wanted to preach
[52:49] but we have to also have this kind of
[52:50] conviction to our in our own personal
[52:53] lives
[52:54] that as the final voice to the final age
[52:56] i must act and live and conduct myself
[52:59] and treat others and respond to certain
[53:02] situations and carry myself in such a
[53:04] way that it promotes the gospel and is
[53:07] best for the welfare of others
[53:10] well what welfare not their personal
[53:11] sensitivities but the fact that they be
[53:13] saved
[53:15] we think that we when we think of it the
[53:17] wrong way and we leave this part out the
[53:19] promotion of the gospel that others
[53:20] might be saved and we think well we have
[53:22] to just be sensitive to these
[53:23] thin-skinned liberals and we just have
[53:25] to be
[53:26] sensitive to these people we just have
[53:27] to bow down to this and compromise to
[53:29] that and i will not compromise and i
[53:31] will not be sheep and i will not do this
[53:33] and i will not do that and there's a way
[53:34] that everything gets phrased to where we
[53:36] we we feel like well i've got to stand
[53:38] up and have a backbone you're missing
[53:40] the point we don't we're not quiet so
[53:43] that somebody else feels better about
[53:44] their position but we do what we do
[53:46] because we desire to see their soul
[53:48] saved
[53:50] and that will that'll
[53:51] that'll move us and motivate us in the
[53:54] shut your mouth ministry but it'll also
[53:57] motivate you and move you to speak when
[53:58] you want to speak
[54:01] because if we're not speaking they'll
[54:02] never hear
[54:05] and if we're speaking the wrong things
[54:06] it'll never make sense to them
[54:11] paul and this what he's expressing here
[54:15] giving up my own will my own comforts my
[54:16] own pleasures my own prophet that i
[54:18] might save the souls of all
[54:20] he did not do anything criminal
[54:23] did not do anything sinful did not do
[54:24] anything anti-word and he never acted
[54:26] against his conscience
[54:29] paul talked about his conscience we
[54:30] talked about the difference between
[54:31] being conscious in his conscience
[54:35] what we tried to identify even then was
[54:37] that our conscience
[54:38] should be informed by the word
[54:41] and dictated moved by the spirit
[54:44] that's how our conscience should be
[54:46] clean so that when we when we act that
[54:48] when we're offending our conscience our
[54:50] conscience says you shouldn't say this
[54:51] or you should say this or you shouldn't
[54:53] do that or you should do this uh that
[54:55] there's there's a word principle the
[54:57] word has
[54:58] left its imprint i'm acting according to
[55:00] the spirit i'm feeling motivated i'm
[55:02] feeling moved to do this and so paul did
[55:04] not act sinful contrary to the word nor
[55:06] did he offend his own conscience in what
[55:08] he said he did or what he said or did
[55:11] so he could actually in these things
[55:13] that we're reading
[55:14] act as one of the jews
[55:17] not argue with the gentiles who kept
[55:19] judaic religion
[55:21] became weak to the weak
[55:23] to the heathen as much as he could he
[55:25] agreed with them
[55:27] he did all these things and didn't
[55:28] offend the gospel
[55:30] but actually promoted it
[55:34] i've been thinking about the phrase the
[55:35] cause of christ the cause of christ the
[55:37] cause of christ
[55:39] the cause of christ is our justification
[55:41] it is our rationale for everything we
[55:43] say and do
[55:45] could we not say that
[55:47] the cause of christ is the reason why we
[55:50] conduct ourselves the way that we do
[55:52] you say the cause of christ well let me
[55:54] say it this way because of christ
[55:57] as christian because of christ
[55:59] that if we were not to be cured or to be
[56:01] short with somebody if they say well why
[56:02] do you do what you do you can say
[56:04] because of christ
[56:06] why do you take that position not
[56:08] because we're set for the defense of the
[56:09] message and we've got to be we've got to
[56:11] get strong with it we got to be fervent
[56:12] we got to be apologetic we got to defend
[56:14] every position we've got to chop the
[56:16] heads off of all these serpent seeds and
[56:17] we get real vitriol and or angry and
[56:20] real uh you know just just
[56:23] angst that we can get about things no we
[56:24] don't need to be that way we are the way
[56:26] we are because of christ
[56:28] for the cause of christ
[56:32] revelation chapter 22 verse 17 that was
[56:34] our text and the spirit and the bride
[56:36] say come
[56:39] notice how it immediately has an impact
[56:41] let him that heareth say come
[56:44] you say come
[56:46] and somebody hears it
[56:48] and now they're saying come
[56:50] what does that mean they're now one with
[56:51] the spirit
[56:53] so the spirit and the bride are now
[56:55] saying come so when you speak what the
[56:57] spirit says it'll have the impact on
[56:59] someone
[57:01] to come to the fountain
[57:03] and to speak
[57:05] and let him that is a third come
[57:08] and whosoever let him take the water of
[57:10] life
[57:10] freely our voice must harmonize with the
[57:13] voice of the spirit that says come
[57:17] because we are we're you are a source of
[57:19] living water
[57:22] as sister elizabeth saying if you're not
[57:24] drinking from the fountain how are the
[57:26] thirsty going to drink from you
[57:29] what kind of cistern are we
[57:32] what kind of fountain are we kind of
[57:33] pool what kind of glass of refreshment
[57:35] what are we serving what are we giving
[57:36] voice to
[57:38] we ought to be a source of living water
[57:43] invite our musicians to come this
[57:44] evening
[57:46] as they come if we can have every head
[57:47] bowed
[57:51] brother
[57:52] branham makes this statement as he's
[57:55] praying
[57:57] it's in the
[57:58] within a much larger passage of prayer
[58:01] that i thought would be very
[58:03] profound for us to hear
[58:06] but i just wanted to end with this
[58:10] may that still small voice attract the
[58:12] people tonight
[58:16] to real sanctified life
[58:18] a life that'll stand by their god
[58:21] that will stand by their church
[58:23] that will stand by their pastor
[58:25] that'll stand by the cause of christ
[58:29] that'll hold up a banner that'll live
[58:31] act dress go and associate
[58:34] and live in the environment
[58:36] that will be so salty
[58:39] that'll cause others to thirst to be
[58:41] like them
[58:43] this is the challenge to be the right
[58:44] kind of advocates
[58:47] still small voice even though it's
[58:48] sounding out from your life
[58:51] you see a real sanctified life and in
[58:53] that life you stand for god you stand
[58:55] for your church you stand by your pastor
[58:56] but you're standing by the cause of
[58:58] christ
[58:59] you're holding up a banner that'll live
[59:01] act dress go and associate and live in
[59:03] the environment
[59:05] that'll be so salty
[59:07] that'll cause others to thirst to be
[59:09] like them
[59:18] our heads bowed i invite you
[59:23] to be that fountain
[59:26] i invite you
[59:28] to reconsecrate yourself to the cause of
[59:30] christ
[59:32] to read these scriptures maybe a little
[59:34] bit differently than you've read them
[59:35] before maybe have them just revive to
[59:37] you and refresh to you by revelation to
[59:39] recognize that there's this fervency
[59:41] there's this legalism there's this
[59:43] righteous indignation there's this
[59:45] passion and this zeal that can be very
[59:47] very misguided
[59:51] when the love of christ is not behind
[59:53] all of it
[59:54] if you have a need in this area tonight
[59:56] and be very specific if you've
[59:57] challenged yourself what have i
[59:58] advocated for what voice am i echoing
[1:00:01] from my the amphitheater of my life what
[1:00:03] is it that gets the most air time if you
[1:00:06] feel the conviction of the spirit
[1:00:07] tonight you'd want to re-tune your epi
[1:00:12] your spiritual amphitheater you'd want
[1:00:14] to become that voice more tuned more in
[1:00:16] tune with the voice of christ and you
[1:00:18] need prayer invite you to stand tonight
[1:00:20] [Music]
[1:00:23] just asking if you'd want to stand and
[1:00:24] say lord i want
[1:00:26] [Music]
[1:00:36] pondering it now thinking about it
[1:00:41] god bless you all who've stood i think
[1:00:43] it's
[1:00:44] nearly everyone
[1:00:46] let's bow our heads in prayer
[1:00:49] our gracious heavenly father
[1:00:53] as we stand in your divine presence this
[1:00:55] evening we have been convicted by your
[1:00:56] word
[1:00:58] we've heard the your voice sounding out
[1:01:01] through the scripture
[1:01:03] that
[1:01:05] there's many voices in the land today
[1:01:07] that would deaden the voice of the
[1:01:08] supernatural that would confuse us on
[1:01:11] what the voice of god is
[1:01:12] [Music]
[1:01:14] that there's actual
[1:01:16] voices that pretend to be
[1:01:18] based
[1:01:20] on truth so as to confuse us that it is
[1:01:22] the truth
[1:01:24] it causes us to
[1:01:26] become an ardent supporter and advocate
[1:01:29] for certain things
[1:01:30] thinking that it's in defense of our
[1:01:31] faith or
[1:01:33] thinking that it's inspired by gospel
[1:01:35] truth but lord i believe as believers we
[1:01:37] must be very clear when we speak
[1:01:40] we must be very confident that what
[1:01:42] we're
[1:01:43] supporting and what we're espousing
[1:01:46] is scriptural
[1:01:48] if we're going to allege it so
[1:01:51] father tonight as everyone has stood i
[1:01:53] believe
[1:01:54] in support and their hearts opened up
[1:01:56] and asked that they could be this voice
[1:01:58] the final voice to be more tuned to your
[1:02:00] holy spirit to be able to echo back more
[1:02:03] clearly the things that relate to your
[1:02:05] word and to be better advocates for the
[1:02:06] cause of christ i pray that you would
[1:02:08] help us
[1:02:10] help us lord
[1:02:13] help us to be
[1:02:16] your advocates lord
[1:02:19] help us to do it for the promotion of
[1:02:20] the gospel for the gospel sake as paul
[1:02:22] said but then also that some might be
[1:02:25] saved
[1:02:27] what a beautiful barrier to him to
[1:02:29] entering into folly or foolishness or
[1:02:31] nonsense that he said that i can be all
[1:02:33] things to all men as long as i keep the
[1:02:35] goal in mind that they be saved
[1:02:39] may this become an ambition of ours lord
[1:02:42] is this end time truth and the great
[1:02:44] revelations that have been brought to us
[1:02:46] through the open of the word can be
[1:02:48] lived out in our flesh and sounded out
[1:02:50] through our members
[1:02:52] and it would catch the thirsty
[1:02:54] may we say with the spirit come
[1:02:57] [Music]
[1:02:58] come home come to the fountain
[1:03:01] i pray that you strengthen us tonight
[1:03:04] give us breath lord in our lungs give us
[1:03:06] relief from things that oppress us
[1:03:08] we ask this in the name of the lord
[1:03:10] jesus christ
[1:03:11] amen
