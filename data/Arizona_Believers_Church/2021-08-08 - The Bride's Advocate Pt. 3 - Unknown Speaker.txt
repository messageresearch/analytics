TRANSCRIPT
========================================
first john chapter 2 verses 1 and 2 my little children these things write i unto you that you sin not and if any man's sin and that's kind of just those phrasings they're very very heavy uh he the word is to bring us to a place of of righteous living that we abstain from and avoid these things but he's knowing the human condition he says if any man sin and he's drawing from what jesus taught about the comforter if any men sin we have an advocate that is the same word used that john uses when he writes of the comforter that jesus said he would send we have an advocate with the father jesus christ the righteous and he is the perpetuation that word there is translated mercy seat he is the perpetuation for our sins and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world and then hebrews chapter 9 i wanted to read the first five verses here because i'd like to make reference to it at a particular point and so i wanted these images to be fresh in your mind as john excuse me as paul is writing here and he's really um it's one of those things if you do have time just to read it it's not it's not really a long book but you can kind of read through and just find how paul is making this example of jesus christ as a high priest the parallel between this new and living way in the new covenant and the old covenant which israel was under and now this new covenant that's not just exclusive to israel but god invites even the gentiles to come and be a part of and he's using the images of israel's faith and his images of their worship in trying to show that whatever you feel you have within the old law we've got something better in the new and he so he's drawing this parallel and painting this picture and so he comes to this place of the sanctuaries and and there's these images that they would be very very familiar with and i'll just maybe make reference i find myself just getting lost in the book of hebrews now but he's just referred to jeremiah chapter 33 and said the promise is i'll write my laws within your heart and that i'm going to write it within your hearts it's not going to be tables of stone but in your hearts and he says this is the covenant a new covenant he says in verse 13 of chapter 8. then verily hebrews 9 1 then verily the first covenant had also ordinances of divine service and a worldly sanctuary for there was a tabernacle made the first wherein was the candlestick and the table and the show bread which is called the sanctuary and after the second veil the tabernacle which is called the holiest of all which had the golden sensor and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold wherein was the golden pot that had manna and aaron's rod that butted and the tables of the covenant that was the law of the tablets that moses had written had written the law upon and over it the cherubims of glory shadowing the mercy seat of which we cannot now speak particularly over it the cherubims of the glory shadowing the mercy seat of which we cannot speak now speak particularly amen may be seated in the as i begin there's going to be a lot of themes that will seem to be repetitive in terms of the um the subject matter of the last couple services and even maybe overlapping quite a bit with the subject we were on last time on jesus being a perpetuation in which he was a sacrifice one time for all so that he is not continually offered or sacrificed year after year but it was the service that he performed once and when he did so he did it once and for all and we're drawing from first john chapter one verses one and two where it says we have an advocate and he takes this advocate and he connects it with the perpetuation and then we're going to want to take a little bit further on this this mercy seat this perpetuation so just a few statements at the outset that's kind of summary from the first couple services on this the advocate is an inner witness so the advocate we don't view the advocate as being a third person who's going to make an appearance for us in court but rather he's an inside witness in the language that brother branham uses and the way that we're encouraged to understand and recognize the role of the advocate is he is a supporter he is an encourager he is a teacher he is a guide he is a friend and so jesus uses the phrase i will send you the comforters the same greek word that john uses in 1st john chapter 2 our advocate and last time we were just ending on how that our advocate is the difference maker that's got the difference maker for the the believer the difference maker for the christian what makes them different than anybody else in the world is this advocate this comforter that they have on the inside and really don't have anything else that we could brag about except his graves and so he said he's the difference maker and then we recognize in ephesians how he used paul paul is writing and saying he's the equalizer such that the jews can't say oh well we're better because we have this history and we have this tradition and we have the law and you gentiles didn't have god he's saying he broke down the middle wall of partition between us and he's made us all one both jew and gentile and so this comforter this holy spirit is an equalizer it's a harmonizer of different parts and it's it's what allows us to get along with one another and to come together as a body of christ and so our advocate is given to us to maintain our harmony with god because us being that three-part being we have a soul we have a spirit we have a body it's our soul that is sealed by the holy ghost and then we still have a body that can get sick we have a mind that can be subject to doubts and even disputing within ourselves so god gives us the holy spirit to maintain this continuity with god in this unbroken harmony with god so that we as christians who love them are assured that he loves us regardless that he's with us that he's going to help us and we're going to make it and so we do not need this advocate and i realize i'm maybe going really fast because i have a finish line that i'd want to get to and i'm very excited to get there we we do not have need this advocate because of an adversarial process that we're in debt and we need uh we need someone to represent us we have a a claim against us and we need a defense attorney the advocate is not given to us because of an adversarial process or because god is angry with us and we need somebody to kind of go talk to dad for us or we need someone to plead our cause and though you can use that in the way of an analogy or a type to help us to understand maybe the role that uh that christ plays or sometimes the way that we approach god but if we only view the advocate as somebody who's trying to cop a plea deal for us we're never fully going to appreciate what the advocate is to us and so jesus christ the righteous is our advocate with god and not within the context of an adversarial process and john says he's not only our advocate with god but he's also our atonement and this this is something that when he when he points to that he is brought into he's he's painting this beautiful picture of what we have this promise we have in jesus christ now i want to use a slide and then another scripture to kind of help summarize a lot of these themes about the advocate and the scriptural principles regarding the nature and characteristic of our advocates so here's a slide that has um several scriptures in it that is going and there i'm using summary language now to you as we look at this so that we're not having to read each one of these scriptures but in john chapter 14 verses 16 and 17 he says the comforter of the spirit of truth he abides and dwells in us forever so jesus is calling the comforter which is our advocate he's also given the characteristic of the spirit of truth and he abides with us and he dwells with us dwells in us forever so this is the characteristic of our advocate then in verse 26 he says that this comforter the advocate is going to teach us all things isn't that wonderful inside teacher he's the teacher he's going to teach us all things and then after he has taught us all things in this great he's going to bring all things to our remembrance and so a lot of times we've learned and we've been taught we just need the ability to recall and the holy spirit's going to do that for us and so it's really it's really just complete and full what he does for us then in john chapter 15 verses 26 and 27 this comforter from the inside now this inside witness testifies to us of jesus christ so it's there to constantly keep fresh within us the witness of jesus christ and then by testifying to us on the inside of jesus christ then we become witnesses of jesus christ we can make witness and it makes us witnesses of him and it's not just hearsay because he's inside of us testifying and witnessing and then we can witness of those things he shares with us in romans chapter 8 verse 26 it says that this spirit help us helps us in our infirmities so the comforter this advocate helps us in our weaknesses where we're weak we've been given an inside teacher an inside strength a spirit on the inside of the inside that's there to help us to to to encourage us to move us along and and it also makes intercession for us he's on the inside of us but it's giving us groanings and how we ought to pray and lord i don't know what to do and as you begin to pray this man on the inside of the man begins to groan things and say things and speak things and you've experienced it before and and you've had situations where you just didn't know what to do or what to say but you found yourself just saying god i need your help and you opened your mouth and the right thing was said to somebody or the right thing comes forward in prayer for your family and you're realize that's the holy spirit on the inside witnessing and speaking now let's look at john chapter 16 verses 13 to 15. and i don't believe that i had used this as yet in in the fullness so i wanted to put this before you and then just highlight these certain characteristics jesus says how be it when he the comforter the advocate the spirit of truth is come he will guide you into all truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come so there's actually this even a prophetic office and a gift and a dispensation of the comforter he shall glorify me for he shall receive of mine and shall show it unto you all things that the father hath are mine therefore said i that he shall take of mine and shall show it unto you so just look at these little things that he's saying about the spirit of truth and where he is he works within you and then he's going to use you to testify so it's a really very deep um very deep things that jesus is speaking about but it guides in all truth it reveals things to come it glorifies it receives it reveals jesus christ glorifies jesus christ it receives jesus christ jesus christ it reveals jesus christ this is what we have on the inside of us and this paul writes in 1st corinthians chapter 2 this is what gives us the ability to know god this is what gives us ability to know the things of god and to search the deep things of god because there's somebody on the inside of the inside that guides us into all truth actually can reveal to us things that god has preserved or waiting for us for those that love him the spirit inside of us is going to glorify jesus christ it's going to be able to receive jesus christ it's going to be able to reveal jesus christ this is what the advocate does this is what you possess by the baptism of the holy ghost now as we look at these different functions as we could say are these characteristics the nature and characteristics of our advocate these these functions are not legal functions they're not with they're not functions that take place within a court of justice or they're they're not just functions that take place within a legal process or an adversarial process and it's not just in investigative functions to where it's just kind of in there exposing things to you and condemning you and convicting you and kind of the way that we feel sometimes the advocate is is he's the advocate on one hand is telling you all the things you're doing wrong and at one time it's telling you everything you're doing wrong and then at the same time saying hold on don't punish them just yet and there's times you get into a sticky situation you find yourself in trouble and someone wants to be the one to help and you come to find out later they're the ones getting you in trouble and they're playing both sides and they're telling you whatever you do you shouldn't apologize right now because they're really angry at you just give it some time and then they go to the other part and say i don't know why they're not apologizing that should tell you all you need to know why you shouldn't have anything to do with them because they're not apologizing and and we kind of have this mind that someone can kind of play this intermediary and in doing so you know on one hand they're telling you you're doing wrong on the other hand they're trying to tell you know trying to apologize for you on the other hand that's not just what these functions represent and so what i want you to kind of think about he's a guide he's a he's a teacher he's a reminder he's a revealer he's a glorifier all these different things about the advocate our advocate and this is the phrase that i would like just to amplify for our time together today our advocate is a mediator in our hearts so where he's moving and where he's functioning where he's acting is he intercedes within us and as he intercedes as a supporter of us mentally he intercedes as a supporter of us emotionally he's interceding as a supporter of us spiritually and so our soul is sealed and we realize that brother branham teaches us and this is so evident and clear in future home of the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly bride that the soul is sealed already in an eighth day condition and so if god chose if god chooses to seal you then it doesn't matter how many cancers you have doesn't matter how uh quick your life is cut short does it matter how many mind battles you have the soul is sealed you're guaranteed a resurrection it's already in an eighth day condition and nothing more can be added to it to make it any more perfect but think of how beautiful and caring and kind god is he doesn't just seal your soul off and then allow us to live in sickness and depravity and mental struggles and battles and being torn and dragged around and the devil say well if i can't have your soul i'll just declare world war three on your spirit and your body and and we be subject to all the elements that satan wants to bombard us with god says hold on i seal your soul and the seal is actually to become an advocate for your spirit and the seal is actually going to be an advocate for your body and it's going to stand there interceding that when you're sick remember by his stripes you're already healed then whenever you have lies bombarding says hold on wait a minute let me just have say here those are just lies of the enemy and lives of the devil he's actually there on the inside interceding and mediating on your behalf in your soul think about it your advocate is your faith instigator he's your faith activator so you so he's there on the inside of the inside and he's not like whoo we're sealed this is great the job is done but now his role is to activate your faith activate a different thought process activate a different vision so he instigates and he inspires and by looking at it from this perspective i hope that it gives you a deeper understanding of christ that we're not just viewing him as as the son of god who died for our sins and the price has been paid and and even as i had a conversation one time i was very striking that it would take place but i was talking to somebody who was intent on committing adultery and i told them what the consequences were scripturally according to the word of god if they committed adultery and they said but isn't that what the cross is for it's a get out of jail free card did you get out of hell card it's a get out of adultery card no sorry it doesn't work that way and so there's a way that the world even even nominal christianity preaches christ that well god created the world and all of a sudden chaos intervened and man sinned by eating an apricot and and now everything's in chaos and god's like how can we figure this out now that there's chaos well i'll just kill my son and then anybody who believes in him is going to receive eternal life and it's kind of like this arbitrary thing that kind of unfolded and god had a way to try to figure this out it's so much deeper than that it's so much richer and i'm wanting to understand more fully what this atonement was how christ what he is to you and in doing so i trust that it'll broaden our relationship with our advocate not just someone we go to when we're in trouble hoping that he can find us find a way out of our sins but rather there's a deeper relationship that we ought to have with our advocate that our advocate is not involved just merely involved in a a conversation it's a conversation between christ and god and we're not a part of it boy i made a horrible mistake i sure hope my advocate is there covering my tracks with god that's not how it works now as we said we said before our advocate and john joins our advocate with our atonement because he says he is our advocate he is our perpetuation but then there's also this role in that our advocate is what joins us to the atonement in that we stand before god justified forever so if we're justified forever before god i just even begin to think well if we are justified forever then christ doesn't necessarily need to be there constantly making excuses for us and justifying us he is justified by a sacrifice we are justified once right we are justified and so we realize he that he had justified he's already glorified so there's some eternal representation of you as being complete this is this is the promise that the bride has entered into or the elect of god as they are sealed so we realize and these are some of the things that i want to explore in being our atonement christ has become our mediator he's become our reconciler reconciling us to god he becomes our intercessor and i want us to fully understand this from the message of the hour in hebrews chapter 2 verse 17 he says wherefore in all things it behooved him to be made like unto his brethren that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to god to make reconciliation for the sins of the people now this is uh in hebrews chapter two you could start in chapter one and just see this beautiful picture that paul is laying out and when paul says that he has been he's a he's been made akin to you so he can be a merciful and faithful high priest he this this automatically to a jew means something to a hebrew this would mean something and they would think of aaron the original high priest and his function and his order and when he uses the phrase to make reconciliation for the sins of the people he's alluding specifically to leviticus 16 at least in one place you can go and read where he's alluding to that particular office of the high priest who would make this offering on the day of atonement and the word that would be used for hebrew is reconciling the sins of israel so when he uses refers to christ as a high priest reconciling our sin the sins of the people then that meant something to hebrew he said okay we know that this high priest went into the temple and made this sacrifice to reconcile israel with god and he said now this is the role in the office that christ has he is a faithful and merciful high priest to make reconciliation just as this day of atonement year after year represented for the hebrews now he's saying this has been an offering now that christ has made for us so he continues in hebrews chapter 3 verse 1. wherefore holy brethren partakers of the heavenly calling and it's think of that how he's bringing us into this brotherhood and a heavenly calling considered the apostle and high priest of our profession christ jesus and he and from here on he just really in earnest begins to compare old new old new old new old temple new temple old sanctuary new sanctuary because the objection of the hebrew could be like well where's our priest then where's our sanctuary where's the sacrifice where's all the elements of our worship like god established this why would god abandon this and paul is saying oh no he didn't abandon it he perfected it and he's saying oh you believe in a tabernacle here's one you believe in a sanctuary here's one you believe in a high priest here's one and so he's basically showing him everything you believed in seed form in shadow form is now in substance form and and he's just saying now consider then the apostle and high priest of our profession christ jesus so christ jesus the righteous is our advocate is our perpetuation it's a there's such great depth to this ministry the apostle and high priest he says of our profession now i'm being very deliberate in coming to this particular instance because when we think of an advocate oh if i confess my sins then we have an advocate and if i confess my sins i have an advocacy i'm so sorry i didn't mean to do that okay i'll go tell god you're sorry you didn't mean to do that and i'm wanting us to understand this completely differently and but not change anything that we already believe not changing any role that he already fulfills not changing any revelation that we already have this is not changing anything and so and maybe for some it may change it but in terms of the truths that we receive this is not changing or adding two and i don't know if that makes you nervous like well if he has to give the disclaimer where in the world is he going so strike that rewind do whatever we need to do strike it from the record brother wes could you go back and strike that redact that read that back to me again what i mean is don't get nervous this is what we all believe but to some of us it's just good verses in the bible and maybe we just accepted oh yeah he died for my sins oh yeah he's my advocate no it's so much more beautiful than just oh yeah so much more to this the apostle and high priest of our profession so this profession this confession he is the high priest of our confession in our profession and romans chapter 10 verses 9 and 10 notice this and this is very this is the areas where i want us to unders acknowledge this is what we believe this is what we understand that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the lord jesus and shalt believe in thine heart that god hath raised him from the dead thou shalt be saved so we can make this profession this confession with our mouth because we have a believing heart we believe first in the heart in other words if you say something in your mouth but don't believe it from your heart it doesn't engage romans 10. and so you have to confess with your mouth and you can keep reading how can you believe on him whom you have not heard so there's a beautiful beautiful drama that unfolds in this that god has got to send somebody who preaches the word of god that you hear and in hearing you believe on him and believing you make confession and you're saved so he says if you confess with your mouth and believe from your heart you shall be thou shalt be saved verse 10 for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation so this is the necessary repentance unto the new birth that when you hear the word of god and you believe the word of god and you make a confession that it it leads one to repentance and in repenting one is baptized in the name of jesus christ and the the seal of your faith the seal of your believing is the new birth is the baptism of the holy ghost and so these are things that are necessary to have eternal life the repentance the sorrow for sin and the confession he says if thou shalt confess with thy mouth and believe from my heart then you enter into relationship with god as a forgiven sinner saints are made from sinners right from losers not from winners and so you recognize yourself a sinner you confess your sins now you're made a christian now you're made alive in jesus christ that that's impossible without the atonement that's impossible without the high priest of your profession now john writes this and we read it a couple sundays ago first john 1 9 if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness and he says this in the context that somebody says well i have no sin he says anybody who says he has not sinned is a liar and makes god a liar because they're saying well i don't need a perpetuation i don't need sacrifice what do i need an atonement for and so he's saying if we confess our sins he's faithful and just to forgive us of our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness this is the image of the atonement he's drawing from the image of the atonement in the old testament the very language that's being used here confessing and being cleansed from unrighteousness and if we confess our sins he will cleanse us from all unrighteousness he's using a language that was associated with the atonement in the old testament and so now the image of the new in the new testament if we just say the new testament terms of the books that we're reading in the new testament he's saying that this is a sacrifice that's offered once for all for salvation so when we are sinners and we confess our sins and we repent and we are baptized with the seal of god the baptism of the holy ghost then we are saved once and for all can't be sealed and unsealed right so in in looking at this we understand the role of christ as the sacrifice for salvation of the elect we we we can never we can never lose sight of that there's it's impossible for you to go so deep into the revelation of the seven thunders to where somehow the sacrifice of christ means nothing anymore like well aren't we beyond that no no no no no no no we're built on this this is the foundation of it this is what we believe and so we and i'm given i'm acknowledging that we understand the role of jesus christ as the atonement and the sacrifice for our salvation and that in order to be saved there is this acknowledgement and recognition of christ as the atonement for our sins now notice how paul begins to continue this in hebrews chapter 4 verses 14 to 16. see and then that we have a great high priest that is passed into the heavens jesus says the son of god let us hold fast our profession he's the apostle and high priest of our profession now he's saying this great high priest notice where he is now that is passed into the heavens jesus the son of god let us hold fast our profession this is what upholds us now notice what this ministry is and let me just say it at the outset his purpose is to strengthen us his purpose is to encourage us this is not a confessional booth relationship or if i could just make it to the the mass if i could just make it to the church and make my confession and go in and it's been the father these are my sins it's been six weeks since my last confession this is not how that it works and so he said let us hold fast our profession now to encourage us in our holding fast he says for we have not a high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities like this is the high priest that we have but was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need so we have this profession holding fast our profession and since we made confession with our mouth and belief from our heart we are saved and because we made confession we are cleansed from all unrighteousness now in order for our testimony to be made secure we have a high priest who has got entered into heaven who is not just like i don't know what they're going through i mean beats me i don't know what they're talking about he can be touched with the feeling of our infirmities so he says because of that because of this we can be honest and come before the throne of grace to obtain mercy find grace to help so it's access to mercy we who have been is sealed by the baptist holy ghost we have access to mercy we have access to grace so this is this is the image that i that i see being painted by paul in these scriptures he's now a high priest by interceding against any accusation he's now a high priest and brother branham even makes reference to that how we have this accuser and he's always accusing but there the blood's still there and the blood's still there and the world accusing us he is the high priest now let's think about it in this dimension he's the ia high priest by interceding against our accusing heart our natural minds our weaknesses our difficulties our infirmities our doubtings our disputings and everything else that would come against us and fight against us and so he's there as a high priest interceding within us assuring us of our forgiveness now i know we have we have christians here that are just just such perfect christians that they they never have any doubts at all and as a matter of fact they felt that the baptismal holy ghost was just the vindication that they deserved for all the wonderful things they believed and all the wonderful things they had done for all the years but we we many of us and we're acknowledging you today but for most of us we're so glad to have one on the inside that reminds us over and over again that your sins and iniquities will remember no more and so he's a high priest within us not by reapplying the blood every time and not by making another sacrifice and so then paul wants to substantiate that it's not the old covenant it's a new covenant so these are the images he begins to paint in this new covenant we have a new covenant and he says in hebrews chapter 7 verse 22 by so much was jesus made a surety of a better testament and what i want to look at is how jesus was made a surety of a better testament and if it feels like maybe we're just kind of on a journey right now i am i'm just kind of walking you through some of these things jesus was made a surety surety means a sponsor a surety means it's under good security he was made a surety a guarantee if he's made a surety it means he's a bondsman so when it says that jesus was made a surety of a better testament he is the full assurance of the covenant jesus christ became a surety jesus christ became a pledge for all the elect and we realized he says because he was made a pledge he he brings newness of life and not only through this let me say it this way not only was he the atonement forever consecrating us this entrance into this new covenant but now he's not only the access to it he's the full assurance of it so it's not just well he died for our sins so you have this access to grace so that we feel like well i'll take advantage of that and then there's all sorts of clauses that say well if you mess up though you lose your right to it kind of like our insurance policies like oh that would be great i'd love to insure my home against floods and then you read the fine print and it says as long as it's not water like well what kind of flood was it going to be and so that's not the kind of so he's basically saying look no i guarantee it not only are your sins forgiven but i am the guarantee and the pledge that they can never be brought up again i'm the barrier i'm the voice i'm the security i'm the pledge that it would that i will fulfill my promise so not only does he give us access to newness of life he's the sureness of it the security of it and the guarantee of it forever giving us and granting it to us so our advocate is the security of the fulfillment of the new covenant as he says he has made a surety of a better testament our advocate is the security of the fulfillment of a better covenant a better promise that was made to us so it's not just i would say a warranty but it's the guarantee it's an absolute guarantee and he and as we mentioned before how that when when he redeemed us and he got us out of the pawn shop he didn't ask for a receipt he didn't need a proof of purge just like he gave that to us so that we would know who our owner is but he knows who he knows who his his are he knows exactly who belongs to him and so in this he's given us this guarantee and the guarantee is absolute and it's not even a replacement guarantee he's saying i guarantee it'll never wear out i guarantee it'll never wane it'll never lose its power it'll never lose its effectiveness it'll never run out it'll never be void it can never be canceled i'm giving you an eternal guarantee that if you have entered into fellowship with christ through the seal of god then it i'm guarantee permanent forever and jesus christ then is this he is the guarantee so christ our advocate becomes the assurance of our liberty in christ he is our assurance of peace he is our assurance of happiness he is our assurance of joy he is our security of everlasting peace this is what he is to us this is what it ought to mean to us when we say that we have received him that he indwells inside of us that he's going to give us another comforter when you have that comforter that's your guarantee of every promise in the book and so he is made assured you have a better testament now there's some translations and there's even some that commentators that say that the word surety could just as easily be replaced with mediator he's made a mediator and so we know that jesus christ is a mediator and i want to look at this in the scripture our advocate is our mediator mediator means one who comes between two parties to remove any differences so where we have a mediator it's like one has a claim another one has a claim that's contrary they're both asking for something or want something that's different and so a mediator comes in and works out a resolution or a compromise and this is just in the natural sense that takes two parties who have a difference and then the mediator removes any differences brings them together and to some mutual agreement that's what we would think of a mediator well i've got to go to mediation this is what we would see the role of a mediator in natural parlance so in the scripture a meteor is one who intervenes to make peace a mediator is one who intervenes to restore a relationship that's been broken or mediators one that comes and confirms a promise that's been made between two parties so he's one that confirms a covenant and a mediator is when it says this is the promise you made this is the promise they agreed to and it's made firm and it's made established and it brings the parties back together in a mutual understanding and so in the book of job in chapter 9 verses 32 to 33 these are just some scriptural images of the role that christ plays talk about god how god is not a man for he is not a man as i am that i should answer him and we should come together in judgment so job just making these these observations in jobs are so profound to say well god is not like me and how can i and god how can he answer my pleading and you're going to get serve a subpoena on god i'm calling you to testify and give witness or you're we this is court-ordered mediation god you get down here in the court of human opinion and we're going to sit down and wrestle this out and he's acknowledging well that just seems ridiculous that that i as a man i'm going to be able to subpoena god or force him to mediation and to come to agreement and come to some accord because he says verse 33 neither is there any days man that on the day the day of judgment the day of the day of reckoning that any days man betwixt us there's not any days man between us betwixt us that might lay his hand upon us both beautiful image there's here's god here's man and he's saying i have no right to tell god can you come to the bargaining table so that we can work this out and he said then there's and there's nobody that can come and intervene and take me as this lowly finite creature and this infinite god and put his hands on us both and bring us together connect the two of us in a day of disagreement where is the one that can join us together oh thank god through jesus christ he has he became our days man between this finite sinful creature and this perfect sinless god christ came as the daysmen between sinful man and a sinless god and laid his hands on us both and brought us together in judgment and removed our differences and so a days man between us paul says in galatians 3 20. now a mediator is not a mediator of one but god is one mediator coming from mesos which means in between a meteor is in between so god is one so god you know god doesn't you don't have a mediator within god and dividing god he said in order for there to be a mediator there has to be one that comes between so god is one so this mediator then is betwixt god and the people so paul amplifies it first timothy chapter two verses five to six for there is one god and one mediator between god and men the man christ jesus who gave himself a ransom for all to be testified in due time once again he gave himself a ransom he paid the price he's given as a payment he's given as the reconciliation the price of his blood is what satisfied and now having paid the price and now that he's our atonement as the one who atoned he stands there as a mediator and and this is what paul is saying here nobody has access to god except through jesus christ so there's only one way of salvation free to free to amen today and i'm not saying it because i just realized it this weekend if that puts you at ease saying thank god brother aaron's finally coming to recognize there's only one name under heaven whereby men can be saved and that's great we can all maybe rejoice in that but no we're just we're stating the obvious but to recognize what's being said here because there's a way scriptures can be twisted and maybe watered down and confused there's a there's one god and there's one mediated between god and men that is the man christ jesus only one became the days man only one became the sacrifice only one bridge the gap oh it relieves us the burden of thinking that we've somehow have to sacrifice in order to make a way for man to be saved no the price has been paid we just we can become the testifiers and the witnesses and the bear of that life so there has been one sacrifice for all and he in his sacrifice became the media between god and men so there's only one way to be brought together with god and judgment and that's through the ransom and through the price that was paid through jesus christ one mediator between god and man christ jesus we do not have the ability to make a side deal with god and bypass the agreement that was made in christ and it says this about this one mediator in hebrews chapter 8 verse 6. so we kind of skipping through hebrews the book of hebrews to see these different points but now have he obtained a more excellent ministry not just this ministry of these priests who die and one has to follow after him but now we have a priest who has made after after the power of an endless life now he hath obtained a better a more excellent ministry by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant he has made a surety of a better testament next chapter the media of a better covenant which was established upon better promises oh this life is just better it's just better and we ought to believe that with all our hearts that what we have received is what was better that this is better than religion this is better than theology this is better than mythology this is better than uh good ways to live and how to be decent this is better this is better this is better there's no religion out there there's no discipline there's no approach to life that's better than the christian one that there's there's there's no better way to live than the one that's laid out in the word of god you say oh well this one is kind there's no more greater kindness than that found in the scripture oh well this one's forgiving there's no greater forgiveness than that which is found in the scripture oh there's there's peace in this there's no greater peace than this listen the accord the harmony the respect the integrity the lack of malice the lack of jealousy living decently and treating others right there's no better way to do that than in the word that's been provided especially in the word that's been restored to us in this hour this is the way to live oh what about what about judaism this is better what about hinduism this is better what about just living a decent life and doing good unto all men this is better because this teaches us how to do it and he's a mediator of a better covenant these were heavy words for the hebrews but it was better and he's a mediator of a better covenant established on better promises hebrews chapter 9 verses 14 to 15 how much more shout out the blood of bulls and goats and a blood of these sacrifices which were shadows and types he's saying how much more shall the blood of christ who through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to god now remember how much weight this language would have with the hebrew how much more shall the blood of christ purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living god this is the promise of the blood this is the promise of the baptism the holy ghost to purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living god and because by his sacrifice in us receiving his life we are to be purged from dead works and the thought of and the desire so much in that and i think we even looked at that some in this what we're preaching on pure joy he says for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament that by means of death for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance this is it's made secure it's made firm any any any activity you had under your old covenant which somehow guaranteed the offer that his sins have been atoned for for that year we have something better we have a mediator this new testament this new covenant for the redemption of transgressions that were under the first whatever was atoned from the first we have a meteor of this for so that they which are called might receive the promise of what an eternal inheritance so he wants us to be assured of so we have a mediator who's there to permanently to always and to continually assure us that this is an eternal promise that god didn't say here you go brother laura you can have it and then walk away but give that back i can't believe you did that right which is something that us i think sometimes maybe as parents what we do is we're giving our kids things just so that we can have the pleasure of taking them away when they prove that they they haven't earned it and maybe we just need to be a little bit more proactive and think through it all right i'm looking in the mirror this morning while we still have morning that's something we're always we're snatching things away we give it take it away give it take it away god doesn't do that god doesn't take it away it's a promise of eternal inheritance so let's drop back to hebrews chapter 7 when we read from verse 22 to verse 28. so you see this full picture that he's drawing here how jesus was made of surety by so much was jesus made a surety of a better testament now let's just try to follow this as we read and let it uh quick and some of these other things we've been reading and they truly were many there were truly and they truly were many priests because they were not suffered to continue by reason to death so you had one you had another one you had another one you had another one but this man the man christ jesus the one mediator between god and man because he continueth forever this is beautiful half an unchangeable priesthood wherefore he is able to save them to the uttermost that come unto god by him he is able to say them to the uttermost that come unto god by him we can only come to god by him and he's able to save us completely totally fully to the uttermost seeing he ever liveth to make it to make intercession for them he continues to live he continually intercedes for such a high priest became us who is holy harmless undefiled separate from sinners made higher than the heavens who needeth not daily as though high priests offer up sacrifice first for his own sins and then for the peoples for he for this he did once when he offered up himself looking at the old way looking at the new way the old priest would actually have to offer up a sacrifice for himself and and have to be purged and purified and sanctified consecrated before these things should even happen but he says christ he did it once when he offered up himself he reconciled our sins he our sins were atoned for so he said now he as the sacrifice is the high priest and he's there ever living unchangeable harmless undefiled made higher than the heavens to make intercession for us verse 20 for the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity but the word of the oath which was since the law maketh the son who is consecrated forevermore notice how paul is comparing old covenant old promise old worship old offering old high priest old tabernacle old atonement mercy seat and new new high priest new tabernacle new throne new altar all these things he's pointing out he's wanting to compare and contrast the old covenant with the new covenant the old one was only revived by the law because there was no way for a high priest to live forever so they had to have a law that had an order of secession with this one it's a power of an endless life so you don't need a law to replace the high priest he ever liveth and he ever lives to make intercession for us so with the few moments that we have left here i want to expand this now this is really just foundational to this point but i feel like very quickly we can just come to this uh climactic conclusion that i have today i want to expand the image that paul is creating of a high priest or amplify this picture that paul is putting together of our advocate so let me first acknowledge again we grasp the concept and i trust that you understand this and i'm looking at people who are beneficiaries of this and understand this very deeply we grasp the concept of the bloody lamb before the father for the forgiveness of our sins that we have this image and oftentimes have to be very careful not to try to make things too literal because even in using a bloody lamb we're using figurative speech about jesus christ because he's literally not a lamb this was a this was he became a man for our sake so we have this image of christ the perpetuation the sacrifice of bloody lamb that his role in shedding his blood and this the offering of his body we have him in this image correctly this image of him playing this role for the forgiveness of our sins before the father now let's let's just zoom out a little bit or maybe kind of step around this picture that paul is painting and look around a little bit because sometimes we can get so focused in on this particular aspect that i i just want to hopefully kind of take a step back to catch more of the scene that paul is alluding to in the book of hebrews and especially as we read here as we're reading in chapter 9 he's describing all these elements of the worldly tabernacle and you have the sanctuary and then you have the holy of holies and within there you have the ark of the covenant and inside the ark of the covenant was aaron's law that he had written or the moses law that he had written in and all these different elements he's trying to describe this but in doing so he's painting a picture for us to understand what we have and in leviticus chapter 16 all right we're not going to read it but make reference to it the high priest entered into the holy of holies sprinkled blood upon the mercy seat and the mercy seat was the lid or or the covering of the ark of the covenant so it's called the ark of the covenant the ark of god's promise and it had the manna which symbolized the the his promise that he made to them in the wilderness and the manna never ran out it had the the rod that of aaron that budded that vindicated uh who the ministry was and he had the i had the law the word that moses wrote it's all it's all being placed in there he it's all within the ark of the covenant and it's between cherubims and so here these cherubims are everything's inlaid with gold and overlaid with gold and you have this seat and the high priest would come in and take the blood of this this these offerings and he would sprinkle it upon the lid the covering and because he was doing upon the covering they called it a mercy seat now i know when we say mercy seat we're picturing a literal chair in heaven it says this seat reserved for mercy and like so someone has to be sitting there right in order for the seat to be occupied but these are just it's called a mercy seat because it was a place where atonement was made and where there was witness given that sins had been atoned for and now notice paul is pointing to this very distinct image in their minds deuteronomy chapter 31 verses 24 to 26 and it came to pass when moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book so now moses writes the message the message has been given it's the word has come forth until they were finished so it's complete it's good that moses commanded the priests the levites which bear the ark of the covenant of the lord that was their responsibility you just couldn't put on any any person's shoulders it had to be carried by these levites which bear the ark of the covenant lord saying take this book of the law and put it in the side or inside the of the ark of the covenant of the lord your god so the ark of the covenant of the lord your god the that which held the the the evidence and the uh and the things pertaining to the promises the ark of god's promise the ark of god's covenant the lord your god that it may be there notice for a witness against thee now we could continue to read it because he says because look you guys are going to forget this and you can go back to this and you need to be reminded of all the things you've forsaken so i'm so glad we've got the mirror of this but he says he put it inside the ark of the covenant that it may be there so the words had to be there under the old covenant as a witness against them and this is all the image that they saw in the shadow in the worldly tabernacle but so then think of the beautiful picture that paul is painting to contrast the old image because he says in hebrews 12 24 and to jesus the mediator of the new covenant and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of abel it's better promises a better covenant the ark of the covenant held the law that would witness against them but now he's drawing all the same images up again and he's painting a picture but now as he paints it it's a mirror image of what there was there before but that being worldly this one is heavenly that one being temporary this one is permanent that one having limits this one is limitless that one being being atoned for and being mediated and being conducted by sinful men this is what told for by the sinless son of god and mediated by jesus christ the righteous not only the atonement but now the advocate of it the media of a new covenant to the blood of the sprinkling it's the same images now that you see okay in behind badger skin in the holy of holies upon this ark of the covenant of the lord the god which in it contains the word of god when it had been finished it's in there and now all these different elements are there and now the high priest is going to sprinkle blood upon the covering of that and in doing so it becomes a place where god indicates mercy and now paul is using the same image for us who's has never seen a high priest after the image of aaron with bells on his garments walking in and everyone is gathered around the outside of the tabernacle and as it's described in the scripture you have the different tribes that were there to guard even the entry into the sanctuary and all these different courts to the time and everyone's outside wondering is god going to receive it it's going to be a cloud appear upon the mercy seat and when that cloud when he appears and the cloud revealing his himself that he's vindicated it that he's confirmed it that it's been accepted everyone's waiting for it to happen but now he does it in a he's he's saying this is better hebrews 10 16 this is the covenant remember that you have the holy ghost and i realize now i should maybe shouldn't have cut this so short but in this particular reading he says he's given us the holy ghost and the holy ghost is given to us as a witness and what is the holy ghost witness of this is the covenant that i will make with them after those days saith the lord i will put my laws into their hearts and in their minds will i write them do you realize the image he's just painted at one time when moses was finished with the word they took it and put it inside the ark of the covenant and it was there inside a physical ark of the covenant of the lord to be a witness against them but now he's got a better covenant and a better promise and now it's going to witness and testify that i'm not going to put it in an ark somewhere that one man has access to but i'm going to put it in your very heart and the very next verses and your sins and your iniquities will i remember no more against you so it's not a witness against you it's a witness for you so the tables of the covenant are not stone and it's not a scroll but he's put his word into our hearts verse 19 hebrews 10 having therefore brother in boldness to read to verse 22 boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of jesus we we're not sending somebody else we have boldness to enter into the holiest always this is completely foreign concept to a hebrew what will we do what only one man can do it but no now this is the better promise the better covenant we can enter into the holiest by the blood of jesus now this should change your whole perception and what you've been viewing and what you've been thinking by a new and living way which you have consecrated for us through the veil that is to say his flesh through his flesh he's consecrated a new and living way and having a high priest over the house of god let us draw near with the true heart and full assurance of faith again the image having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water we now have been consecrated just the same as the high priest would have been in order to have the right to enter behind the veil into the holiest of holies the old covenant and the old sacrifices he's saying have been abolished abolished maybe it's a heavy word for the hebrews finally fulfilled and he says the new covenant is a new way he said by his blood by his blood we can enter into the holiness holiest his presence the place where he said he would commune the place where he would identify himself where the shekinah glory came down and he's saying and though they may have seen this pillar fire come and in this this confirmation be given as a sign that what that a shekinah glory was dwelling there behind that he had he accepted the sacrifice that the sins had been atoned for can you see this picture that's being painted the place of mediation in the old testament was behind badger skins that was under the old covenant and all the worshipers stood on the outside waiting to know whether or not he'd been confirmed so in that they relied upon this priesthood as paul is developing it and they're separated from it but under this new covenant this better covenant with better promises you aren't separated can you see the new picture i'm going to try to wrap this up here so shake yourself wake up the high priest is on the inside we are together with him this is the picture he's trying it all together because he says he has abolished this he has abolished this partition he's made he's through the veil of his flesh he's removed the barrier as to why no man could ever enter that place so because that's what his flesh the sacrifice of his flesh was to remove that hindrance there was he was hid behind badger skins he had to go in the high priest a very particular way a very deliberate way to go in otherwise he'd be dead and he had to offer this atonement he's saying that christ entered in and through the veil of his flesh atoned for it and he became the media of a better covenant and now through that offering we're invited to enter in so then even the very picture that's dramatized here in matthew chapter 15 verses 37 and 38 and he's hanging there on the cross the sacrifice the perpetuation jesus cried with a loud voice and gave up the ghost and the veil of the temple was rent and twain from the top to the bottom why because that veil was torn apart saying there's no more shekinah glory there's no more blood that's no longer the meeting place and there on the cross was a new place of mercy it was back on wheels as it were again and they had to move the ark of the covenant the mercy seat was always in motion and now once again it showed that mercy had moved it was hanging on a cross for there for men to see and he tore the veil of the old covenant because the veil of his flesh was breaking away the veil from you the shekinah glory was on a different arc this kind of glory that was on the ark of the covenant lord god in the old covenant was now settled on another tabernacle christ in hebrews the book of hebrews begins with this verse earlier i was wanting to go to it and read it i didn't i had forgotten it was here who being the brightness of his glory and the expressed image of his person and upholding all things by the word of his power when he had by himself purged our sins sat down on the right hand of the majesty on i i i i i want to be very very deliberate now try to focus with me i know this is a lot i know i go fast but i think you can handle it someone told me one time it's like trying to drink water out of a fire hydrant but maybe you're losing your teeth right now but he's bringing this to this image now that we have painted and christ and his role in what he's doing when he had made the atonement himself he sat down on the right hand of the majesty on high and brother bannon makes this statement over and over again and i'm kind of combining the phrase but i'm using it so you can find it especially even after the seals is where i was focusing to see the continuity through the entire message but he makes the statement jesus christ is seated at the right hand of god right hand of the majesty on high ready to intercede on your confession and he makes that statement how many you're familiar with that statement over and over again he makes it quite a bit when he's talking about interceding on your confession he identifies him as this scripture says on the right hand of the majesty on high there to make intercession ephesians 1 20 which he wrought in christ when he raised him from the dead and set him at his own right hand in heavenly places so we again remember our traditional image of christ not that is incorrect but christ there as the bloody lamb interceding for us as a perpetuation for our sins we who are sinners he's there before the father to atone for our sins but now once you have accepted that and you've identified yourself put your hands upon the the sacrifice as it were and then he becomes the days been between you and god there has now been a satisfaction made and paul is saying because of this sacrifice and through the baptism of the holy ghost you have now entered into and you have been purged from your old sins and you have now entered into fellowship with him and he was there seated at the right hand of majesty on high but now in ephesians 2 46 but god who is rich in mercy for his great love where if he loved us even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with christ by grace you are saved and hath raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in christ jesus and before your mind even goes there he's not talking about this banquet room in the hilton garden inn or some church with four walls he's not talking about a sanctuary he's not talking about a physical structure he's not talking about a church he's talking about a hidden life in christ he's talking a place that our souls have entered into where we are dwelling daily with him we use the phrase sometimes all we get together we're seated in heavenly places in christ jesus thinking that somehow when we leave we're taking stairs down you didn't take an elevator to get in here you didn't take an escalator you didn't take a uh you haven't been put in one of those little tubes at the bank and here we are heavenly places in christ jesus and we all kind of loathe the bobsled right down when we leave church no you by the baptism being quickened from your sins have been raised up and whether you feel like it tomorrow morning when you wake up or whatever it is you just you just ask the advocate to make it more real to you heavenly places baby that's where i'm that's where i'm at that's where i'm living that's where my soul has been lifted up to and therefore if my soul has been lifted up to a realm of heavenly places let my soul lift up my spirit let my soul lift up my body see i'm letting go in my spirit i'm letting go in my body why because i'm seated where at the right hand of the majesty i'm not down here in a worldly tabernacle i'm not stuck here in a hilton garden inn but i am raised up seated in heavenly places in christ jesus not in the sanctuary on the outside hoping that something good is happening behind badger skins but now he's behind my skin now i'm raised up to the right hand of the majesty on high to where the intercession of the advocacy isn't a one-way conversation of the advocate and god but i'm there and he's encouraging me this is what where this is the image that should be painted to us we are seated together with christ in heavenly places where at the right hand of majesty the majesty and there in that place we're with our advocate brother man makes this statement i'm going to read from revelations chapter 4 part 2 where he speaks on the 24 elders revelations chapter 4 part 3 where he's speaking of the throne of mercy and i'll try to just do this quickly first he was in the heavens above and shining in the stars second he was on earth shining through the shekinah glory and that's the earthly tabernacle next he come and was made flesh and dwelt among us still wearing his patience then so earthly tabernacle in the wilderness the the worldly sanctuary then the tabernacle of christ then he redeemed man by his blood came into his church in the form of the holy ghost and the point he's making is about blasphemy and things he says speak against that it's a finished thing done speak against what again the holy ghost in his church let's just be careful what we say and he says now you see you see where the shaking come we're at a time they don't realize people can't comprehend what it means the now the first throne was in heaven judgment seat the second throne was in christ the third throne is in man did you catch that first in heaven then in christ then in man so a week later he says this in revelation chapter four part three from number this is where he's preaching the revelation of jesus christ it's from this that we get uh great tremendous most of the substance from the the church age book the mercy seats in the heart now that we're just looking at an aspect of it but it's one i think we must accept the seed where the shining forth of his glory in all of his children the shekinah glory and the human heart so now notice the connection you have with this heavenly places look it's not somewhere beyond the veil somewhere and it's got to pierce through it's even behind the veil of your flesh it was one time behind badger skins now it dwells behind human skin so the mercy seat is in the heart he says that's paragraph 308 now paragraph 326 and he's going through the guards and those four guards those guards that stood there guarding the the tabernacle in the old testament nothing touched that mercy seat without the approach and the only thing that could approach it was through the blood aaron went in there once a year with the blood now you see it now watch each head of the three tribes guarding the mercy seat the mercy seat of the old testament now have you got that down everybody now here's a brand new one brother listen to this then we'll go remember that was the guards of the old testament how many has ever read it in the bible you know it's right see that's the guards of the old testament now we're living in another age glory oh i love this age why because it's better better promises better covenant now god has a mercy seat today to be guarded where is the mercy seat found in the heart of man where did it come to the heart of man at the day of pentecost when the holy ghost which is god come into human hearts how is it we can have this image how is it that brother branham could make this connection because all the images all the symbols and all the elements are there and it's exactly part of the connection that paul is trying to make so that we don't become these people that are just believing in an imaginary sanctuary somewhere in eternity but that we realize it's made real right within our own lives whether you want to call it a microcosm or just another shadow we can say that he has a tone for it and through that atonement i know that i've entered into something real i know my sins are forgiven i know that i've been changed from the old man that i used to be and now i'm communing now i'm living in the presence of the king now my soul has been filled and my soul has become a place of mercy how how in the world could a human heart be a mercy seed all the elements are there he's coming to human hearts what is the holy ghost he's the advocate what is he the perpetuation where is he in the seat of your heart and what is he doing even today right now telling you don't fear don't worry it doesn't matter how dark it gets i'm here as a witness that you're already connected to something beyond this and i'm going to take you out of here not even death can destroy this where is your advocate in your heart by the baptism of the holy ghost he's behind your skins now christ made surety of a better testament is now dwelling in your hearts as that security as that pledge as the mediator of god's promise free scriptures to end it invite the musicians if you want to come to your places he is a surety what is the holy ghost in the heart of man brother man looks at it from one type as the mercy seat second corinthians chapter 1 verse 22 who hath sealed us and given the earnest of the spirit in our hearts what what is that god hasn't put you on layaway right i mean let's not oh well i sure hope he gets another paycheck case get all these other worldly things out of your mind he gave you the holy spirit so that you would know it's guaranteed it's a done deal the earnest is given as a pledge of what he's saying the earnest of the spirit of hearts what is it for it's it's the evidence of full redemption it's the completion it's the evidence of the perfection ephesians 1 13 and 14 sealed with that holy spirit of promise which is the earnest of the inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession he gave it to us now why did he give it to you now because he had a plan of redemption that was going to run its course and for some of us we thought for sure we wouldn't have gone past 1965 maybe we didn't think we'd get out of the 60s then we thought sure for sure it would be 77 then we thought maybe it was 84 then we thought it was the year 2000 and here we are in 2021 and we haven't been worse off why because he gave us the spirit as the guarantee that no matter how long this would continue how long this would go on your redemption is secure it is complete and if you have to go by way of a grave that is no discount against you that is no mark against you that is no evidence of the lack of faith but the earnest you were given is the guarantee you'll come up in the resurrection and you'll have a glorified body one day it is given to us it is given to us as the earnest oh do you see why we must be born again you see why we need this blessed assurance why we need to be connected to it why we need to be feeding it while we have to know about it because it's our advocate and he's our earnest so paul says in second corinthians chapter 5 verses 4 to 5 if i had included goku good i'd included that one for we that are in this tabernacle do groan oh so we are a tabernacle and we have a sanctuary and we have a holy of holies and in there is christ and we that are in this tabernacle do groan and the holy spirit our advocate is groaning within us things that we don't know what to say things we don't know to ask remember they're in romans 8 it's giving there we that are in this tabernacle do groan being burdened not that we should be unclothed but clothed upon that mortality might be swallowed up of life now he that hath wrought us for the self thing same thing is god who also hath given a unto us the earnest of the spirit not the earnest that will receive the spirit but the spirit as an earnest of what the redemption of the purchased possession completely purchased in the atonement but standing for things that are so much better than just a good life here on earth but that mortality might be swallowed up in life so the earnest on the inside of you is a witness that mortality can be swallowed up with life that's what the advocate we that are in this tabernacle do groan i'm so glad that in this tabernacle there's a high priest and there's one there advocating for me in the throne of my heart reminding me teaching me leading me in guiding me let me say this morning if you don't know him accept him if you haven't repented of your sins repent of your sins if you haven't been baptized in christian baptism which is in the name of the lord jesus christ in order to be sealed with that holy spirit of promise then i implore you don't miss that it's the peace you crave it's the liberty you crave it's the joy you crave and for those of us who have felt this blessed earnest let's not forget what it stands for not be reaching out there for something oh if this could change if that could change if i could have this if i could have that if this could be mended if this could be broken if this could take place if that could take place no just come right back to the advocate today and say i know that you're with me and with you i'm willing to go all the way let's stand i trust you can see the image of the sanctuary the tabernacle the sanctuary the outer court the inner court the holy of holies there's different elements that we could have laid out or even diagrammed to you i hope that you can see yourself today and where this mediator is not somewhere in a sanctuary in israel not even somewhere merely in heaven and we're here on earth but it's a spiritual place that is it's a spiritual communion and it even has representation right down inside of the inside of the inside let's bow our heads today [Music] our heavenly father we thank you for your presence that has been with us today and i personally thank you lord for the diligence of the people as they persevere and maybe strain to catch every word [Music] and i'm thankful father that you stand between us between speaker and here and in us in speaker and here to rightly divide the word of truth and place it just in that right spot that a believer needs lord i do not believe that today we labor to force an object into a place that it does not belong but the word preached you just take it and it finds sanctuary it finds rest it settles where it needs to and i ask today lord that as when this many people gather together there's needs that vary so much lord i know there's need for the the baptism of the holy ghost we know there's need for greater sanctification there's need for restoration and healing i pray lord that we could be pointed now with clouds rolling away and things pushed aside and see you today and receive you today for all that we need and i ask that you bless your people give them strength and encourage them today father as we've lifted up these things may we not be quick to leave them but may we find in is searching our hearts lord find the right thing to reinforce to fellowship on with one another and our spouse or our children or our brothers and sisters later lord that we could rehearse the right things and the correct things to one another that we're not so quick to leave this sanctuary and lose connection with that holy of holies that's represented deep down on the inside of us by the baptism of the holy ghost and lord as we've made invitation to any who be lost to receive you may they receive you now may they accept you if they don't know how to may the holy spirit just begin to open up their eyes of understanding that they begin in repentance that the scriptures teach that with the mouth confession is made from a believing heart and that once we've repented of our sins we are baptized because we know our sins are forgiven and they've been purged and lord we can receive the seal of god the earnest lord if i could be a little bit more personal right now it that seal was for us to seal my faith with an earnest is my source of courage strength leadership safety peace all the remaining days of a saved life may we draw every benefit of the atonement lord may we leave none behind shake us out of traditions shake us out of theology's lord that restraint shakes lord from any any images and any ideas and any thoughts that hold us back from walking fully in the promise made available to us today bless your people may they be loosed may they be free may they thoroughly enjoy the relationship with their advocate i ask this in the name of lord jesus christ amen amen blessed be the name of the lord praise the lord
