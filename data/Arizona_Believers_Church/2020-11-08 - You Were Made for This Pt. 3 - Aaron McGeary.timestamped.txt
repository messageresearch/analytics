[0:00] um just make reference to something that
[0:03] has been uh I think on a lot of our
[0:06] hearts there's been a lot of a
[0:08] statements shared amongst ourselves over
[0:10] the last week or so and I think it uh it
[0:14] didn't really come into view until this
[0:16] past week after the election um that the
[0:19] state number of statements that brother
[0:21] Brandon makes regarding a woman rise to
[0:24] power great woman he gives us prophecy
[0:26] in 1933 one of the different visions
[0:28] that he had in prophecies that he made
[0:30] and there's a lot of focus uh oftentimes
[0:33] on how this is going to be interpreted
[0:35] and a lot of statements are shared so
[0:37] what I wanted to do just for a few
[0:38] moments here at the outset um is to
[0:41] share some of the the rest of the
[0:44] statements or a few things not to put my
[0:46] own interpretation on it but rather just
[0:48] to zero in on even how brother brandham
[0:50] felt this prophecy was being fulfilled
[0:53] and and I have several statements here
[0:55] that just in themselves we could spend
[0:57] the morning uh teaching on them but I'm
[0:59] just going to try to
[1:01] uh point to some key phrases when he's
[1:04] uh preaching the message life in 1957 he
[1:07] refers to that Vision he says remember
[1:09] 1933 I saw that come in a vision a great
[1:12] powerful woman will take over the whole
[1:14] nation someday and then he talks about
[1:17] how it's a woman's Nation America he
[1:19] says women will take over women will
[1:21] take over and the doctrine of the
[1:23] Catholic Church which I've always said
[1:26] would take over the United States it's
[1:27] absolutely almost there right now
[1:29] worship of a woman Mary which is a
[1:32] goddess then which is contrary to the
[1:34] Bible then he says uh in condemnation by
[1:38] representation in
[1:40] 1960 I seen a great woman rise up in the
[1:43] United States well-dressed beautiful but
[1:45] cruel in heart she'll either guide or
[1:47] lead this nation to ruination I got in
[1:49] parenthesis perhaps Catholic Church then
[1:53] also that same year and from that time
[1:56] he says in 1933 referring to the vision
[1:58] again this is a woman Nation it's number
[2:01] 13 it appears in 13th chapter of
[2:03] Revelation so he's just laying those
[2:05] things out he says she'll either be
[2:06] president vice president or it'll be the
[2:09] Catholic Church as a woman I've seen her
[2:12] a great woman then when he's preaching
[2:15] the revelation of Jesus Christ which is
[2:17] the uh Church age book he says but there
[2:19] will be a powerful woman now remember
[2:22] this is on tape two a powerful woman
[2:24] great woman she'll either be president
[2:26] or it'll be a woman representing the
[2:28] Catholic Church which I think it is
[2:32] which take over here someday and she'll
[2:34] rule this country and then he talks
[2:36] about how the number 13 the United
[2:38] States of America number 13313
[2:40] everything is woman woman woman woman
[2:42] woman right on down she takes over all
[2:44] the offices she's taken over Hollywood
[2:46] she's taking over the Nations over the
[2:47] offices he says she took over everything
[2:50] there is equal right with men cusses
[2:52] like a man drinks like a man he says and
[2:54] just bait for the Catholic church for
[2:56] the wor worship of a woman do you see a
[2:59] thing them and how brother brandom
[3:01] approached this prophecy of a woman
[3:03] coming into Power he says now this is
[3:06] how it was written in the church age
[3:08] book the same statement he says then in
[3:10] the sixth Vision There Rose America in
[3:12] America the most beautiful but cruel
[3:14] woman she held the people in her
[3:16] complete power I believed that this was
[3:19] the rise of the Roman Catholic Church
[3:22] though I knew it could possibly be a
[3:23] vision of some woman rising in great
[3:25] power in America so he's he believed it
[3:28] would be the rise of the Roman Catholic
[3:30] Church then he says in Jehovah Gyra 1961
[3:33] I said I seen some great powerful woman
[3:36] rise in the United States and he again
[3:38] he goes through the same Revelations
[3:39] chapter 13 the number 13 He says and I
[3:42] see a great woman rise up beautiful to
[3:44] look at but cruel Wicked heart and that
[3:47] will be a church and she's on her road
[3:51] now excuse me for a moment
[3:58] [Music]
[4:04] now I can really really get as loud as I
[4:08] want notice how he says and that will be
[4:11] a church very definitive this great
[4:14] woman coming into Power then in Jezebel
[4:16] religion just a week later he says
[4:18] remember Jezebel calls herself a
[4:20] prophetess and then he says they'll come
[4:22] a worship of a woman in the United
[4:24] States that will be Mary I seen it 1933
[4:29] and he refers to again to the vision so
[4:30] it's the worship of a woman the worship
[4:32] of Mary which he's connecting with the
[4:35] Roman Catholic church and then also he
[4:39] connects these things with the World
[4:40] Council of churches in an ecumenical
[4:42] movement and so these things are all the
[4:44] ways that he tied these things together
[4:46] and then in the message once more this
[4:48] is in November of
[4:51] 1963 he says the Council of churches
[4:53] putting themselves together and uniting
[4:55] in Fellowship around Rome he says exact
[4:59] what the Bible said it would do
[5:02] 1933 the Holy Spirit came one morning
[5:05] and told me seven things that would take
[5:07] place before this nation was destroyed
[5:09] one of them is that so notice how he
[5:12] places it he says one of them is that
[5:15] it's on Old Paper there at the church
[5:17] many has looked at it goes through a few
[5:19] of those visions and he says and how
[5:20] that they would permit women to vote and
[5:22] doing so they would elect the wrong
[5:24] president and in this would be a woman
[5:26] standup that would govern the United
[5:28] States not actually a woman but a church
[5:32] and so he says it it was it wasn't more
[5:34] than just it wasn't just one time in
[5:36] 1957 he says well to my opinion I think
[5:38] it's the Roman Catholic church and then
[5:40] left it alone but he multiple times he
[5:43] makes reference to this prophecy and he
[5:46] he's pointing out very definitively that
[5:49] it is fulfilled at least in one way that
[5:53] it was the Roman Catholic church and I
[5:55] believe that there can be women rising
[5:57] to power literally rising to power and
[5:59] it's symbolic of of that that the real
[6:03] power that's governing things and and
[6:06] what the thrust of it is and how it's a
[6:07] religious thing it's a religious spirit
[6:10] and it's the uh and it's uh even going
[6:12] to take head in the Antichrist after the
[6:14] Rapture but I wanted just to read those
[6:16] to you um share those with you so that
[6:18] you get the full context uh because we
[6:21] all know uh if you're around the message
[6:24] for very long you hear these visions and
[6:25] you hear that brother brandham said
[6:27] there'd be a woman president and that
[6:29] really is just kind of a a snippet of
[6:31] what he actually said he said a lot of
[6:33] things in relation to it and he most
[6:36] often and especially after the seals are
[6:37] open he's pointing more to this
[6:39] spiritual side of This Woman This
[6:42] worship of Mary worship of a woman the
[6:44] Roman Catholic Church it being joined
[6:46] ecumenically with the World Council of
[6:49] churches and he's always pointing back
[6:51] to this Vision that it was the church
[6:53] not just a woman so with the election of
[6:56] a new president uh president-elect Joe
[6:59] Biden
[7:00] and his vice president uh Harris uh Vice
[7:03] president-elect Harris there's maybe
[7:05] some speculation could this be the
[7:07] Fulfillment now I can't say that brother
[7:09] brandham didn't see this woman but I do
[7:13] know that he already has pointed us to
[7:15] the church and the rise of that woman as
[7:17] being a fulfillment of it and in that
[7:20] way I'm more intrigued that Joe Biden is
[7:22] only the second Catholic president ever
[7:24] elected to the United States since John
[7:27] F Kennedy so to me that's maybe more
[7:29] compelling than the woman aspect but you
[7:31] can definitely see in the message and
[7:33] know this is one of the known
[7:35] knowns right this is one of the knowns
[7:37] that we can look to and say brother
[7:39] brandom already told us that this is
[7:41] part of it um even when it comes to the
[7:44] foolish virgin going to buy oil he
[7:45] already told us that was happening in
[7:47] his ministry look at them now those
[7:49] denominations seeking it now so there's
[7:52] certain things that we can say this part
[7:54] has been fulfilled if there's another
[7:56] part to it then let God interpret it by
[7:58] bringing it to pass so just wanted to
[7:59] share those with you a few of them not
[8:02] trying to put my own interpretation on
[8:03] it but just share the full scope of how
[8:05] that brother brandham we know that
[8:07] brother Brandon pointed to the rise of
[8:09] the woman in power being a church the
[8:12] worship of Mary which is represented by
[8:14] Roman Catholicism which is the mother
[8:16] and then all the episcopalians the
[8:18] Protestants all of them joined together
[8:20] anyways so it's a lot more subtle than
[8:22] maybe we think it is so I just wanted to
[8:24] share that with you trust that it was uh
[8:26] those things would be helpful if you
[8:28] like to have those statements I can
[8:29] provide them for you if we could just
[8:31] stand again I'd like to take uh a read
[8:34] from Luke chap
[8:36] 22: 31-34 thank you musicians we can do
[8:40] it in plural this morning which is nice
[8:42] I apologize for making you sit there a
[8:44] little bit longer
[9:01] Luke chapter
[9:03] 22:
[9:06] 31-34 and the Lord said Simon Simon
[9:09] behold Satan hath desired to have you
[9:11] that he may sift you as wheat but I have
[9:14] prayed for thee that thy faith fail not
[9:17] and when thou art converted strengthen
[9:19] thy Brethren and he said unto him Lord
[9:21] I'm ready to go with thee both into
[9:23] prison and to death had a lot of zeal uh
[9:27] was really convinced of uh what you know
[9:29] the conviction his backbone he really
[9:31] thought he had it he says and he said I
[9:33] tell thee Peter the shall not Crow
[9:36] this day before that thou shalt Thrice
[9:38] deny that thou knowest me amen we desire
[9:42] God bless the reading of his word you
[9:44] can have your
[9:46] seats we're continuing on the subject of
[9:49] you were made for this this is actually
[9:52] turned into a little bit more than I
[9:54] thought it would be because there's just
[9:56] so much uh depth to this and as we've
[9:59] already um looked at uh in the last
[10:03] couple Services we were really focusing
[10:06] on the tension and the concern regarding
[10:08] the social climate the political climate
[10:11] even the economic climate in relation to
[10:14] the present election and how there was a
[10:17] lot of even a lot of fear amongst uh
[10:19] Believers but fear amongst uh Americans
[10:21] in general the whole world watching
[10:23] what's going to transpire on Election
[10:25] night what are the events that are going
[10:26] to unfold and we can take courage
[10:29] knowing that it's God's word that's
[10:31] going to be accomplished and that
[10:33] regardless of uh what our speculations
[10:36] might be and even regardless of what our
[10:37] fears are God's word is going to be
[10:40] accomplished he's going to bring his
[10:41] word to pass so we can rest knowing that
[10:44] he has set things in motion he allows
[10:46] things to come to pass and so we don't
[10:48] try to get so much invested um in
[10:51] personalities and even outcomes because
[10:53] when we do that um we can actually
[10:55] weaken our faith because we're trying to
[10:58] project confidence in Faith towards
[11:00] something that God hasn't said nor will
[11:02] it come to pass and so really it's just
[11:04] to hope so and we're left disappointed
[11:07] uh my dad said something one time he
[11:09] said many things at one time that I have
[11:11] appreciated and I enjoyed but one thing
[11:13] that has stayed with me for uh over 20
[11:15] years now is he said faith is not
[11:18] necessarily holding on to a particular
[11:20] outcome we say well it just has to be
[11:22] this way it just has to be that way and
[11:23] that's faith that could just be your hes
[11:25] so your your your will what you want and
[11:27] you hold on to particular outcome and
[11:29] when that doesn't happen what does it
[11:30] become a judgment of or an indictment of
[11:32] your faith because you've presumed and
[11:34] you ventured without Authority and as we
[11:37] were looking at that we're looking at
[11:38] how that things that are uncertain are
[11:40] just that they're not certain and that
[11:42] we have to resist the urge to take these
[11:44] uncertainties and then join them with
[11:47] prophecies and and doing so create a
[11:49] monster that is hybrid that is our the
[11:51] uncertainties with our interpretation of
[11:53] Prophecy and then that doesn't really
[11:55] bring Faith it brings fear and that
[11:57] weakens our confidence even more and we
[11:59] were just looking at those different
[12:01] things and then the third thing if I'm
[12:03] just going by memory here was that if
[12:05] there's been a prophecy take it all into
[12:07] consideration if there's a prophecy of
[12:09] Doom where where's the where's the uh
[12:12] the prophecy of departure where's the
[12:14] depart the prophecy of Deliverance
[12:16] that's attached with it because God
[12:18] gives warning before he gives judgment
[12:21] and the warning isn't merely I'm going
[12:22] to smack you in the face so you might as
[12:24] well just get ready for it it's if you
[12:26] don't I'm going to' so the warning
[12:30] carries with it a way of Escape or a
[12:32] solution or a remedy and so those are
[12:35] some of the uh things that we've been
[12:36] sharing how that in this season and in
[12:38] this time of uncertainty and volatility
[12:41] within economies within our own jobs and
[12:43] social things we need to be connected to
[12:45] the things that we know are certain and
[12:47] resist the urge of creating hybrids in
[12:49] our conscience and in our theology our
[12:51] belief system that promote fear and not
[12:54] faith and as we're reading here in Luke
[12:56] chapter 22 and so we'll just jump right
[12:59] into this uh is where we're reading in
[13:01] our text Jesus says Satan hath desired
[13:04] to have you that he may sift you as
[13:07] wheat this is the agitation of his faith
[13:09] that it might be overthrown because
[13:11] Jesus then kind of amplifies what the
[13:14] sifting was related to he says but I
[13:16] have prayed for thee isn't that
[13:17] wonderful and he's prayed for you too he
[13:21] prayed for not only these but th these
[13:23] but them that th also given me and he
[13:25] prayed that you would be one with him as
[13:27] even as he was one with the father so he
[13:29] has prayed for us he says I've prayed
[13:31] for them or for thee that thy faith fail
[13:34] not so that's the focus of Satan's
[13:37] sifting is kind of the weakening of his
[13:39] faith the agitation of his faith to
[13:41] failure and when thou art converted
[13:43] strengthen thy Brethren I I love how
[13:46] that it's not and if it's when so he had
[13:50] this confidence in the election of Peter
[13:52] he knew all that thou has given me is
[13:54] thine except for one he even said he
[13:56] said that's the one that'll betray me so
[13:58] he knew that Peter was not that one he
[14:01] knew that Peter was one that was given
[14:03] to him and couldn't be separated from
[14:04] him so he says when thou art converted
[14:06] strength in thy Brethren and Peter
[14:09] remarks Lord I'm ready to go with thee
[14:10] both into prison and to death so he was
[14:13] certain that he could do uh he could
[14:18] follow Jesus even into prison if it
[14:20] meant that I'm willing to die for you
[14:21] I'm willing to be in prison for you I'm
[14:23] so certain in this faith that I have for
[14:24] you that I'm willing to suffer all sorts
[14:26] of persecution even unto death and he
[14:28] said tell thee Peter the shall not
[14:30] Crow this day before that thou shalt
[14:32] Thrice deny that thou knowest me so it
[14:36] says I know you are drawn The Sword and
[14:38] you're all ready to go to fight for me
[14:39] you're ready to go to prison you're
[14:41] ready to be murdered for my sake but at
[14:43] this point you'll actually deny me three
[14:46] times before the crows and it says
[14:49] it this way in John Chapter
[14:52] 13 it says it uh he says it in verses 36
[14:56] and 37 Simon Peter said unto him Lord
[14:59] wheither goest thou Jesus answered him
[15:02] whether I go thou c not follow me now
[15:05] but thou shal follow me shalt follow me
[15:07] afterwards now this speaks directly as
[15:09] it says Peter said unto him well and
[15:11] there's another place where Jesus is
[15:13] speaking to him and they knew that he
[15:15] said this foreshadowing the death that
[15:17] Peter would have so he knew that now
[15:20] Peter couldn't be a
[15:22] martyr in the condition that he was in
[15:24] then he couldn't be a martyr but he was
[15:25] saying but you will be able to follow me
[15:27] afterwards right now you can't do so but
[15:29] later you on you will be and Peter said
[15:31] unto him Lord why can I not follow thee
[15:33] now I will lay down my life for thy sake
[15:38] now we understand the story or know the
[15:40] story how that Peter that very day that
[15:43] very morning uh was challenged whether
[15:46] or not he was identified with Jesus and
[15:49] in each time these three different
[15:51] instances his defense be got more
[15:53] agitated and more agitated to the point
[15:55] it's the Bible says he swore he he was
[15:58] like I don't know this man so he's
[16:01] brought to the place three times where
[16:02] he denies Christ and then even denies
[16:05] his deity and his origin from God says I
[16:07] don't know this man and that fulfills
[16:10] what Jesus said would would happen
[16:12] because in that state the fear of
[16:15] persecution or even the fear of death
[16:17] caused Peter to deny Christ when Under
[16:19] Pressure so right there when the word
[16:22] was being crucified right there when he
[16:23] was being put on trial Peter could not
[16:26] stand the pressure but after his
[16:28] conversion all fear is gone and he
[16:30] stands up before the people and he says
[16:32] you've crucified Jesus Christ you men
[16:36] have blood on your hands he was the the
[16:38] Son of God and he refers to prophecy and
[16:40] he's telling them what's happened and
[16:42] all the fear has gone from Peter to the
[16:44] point to where Peter in his as Jesus
[16:46] even prophesied he was willing to lay
[16:49] down his life for the gospel and the
[16:52] tradition is that Peter requested to be
[16:54] hung upside down because he didn't feel
[16:56] he was even worthy to be crucified in
[16:59] the same manner that Christ was but it
[17:01] was fear that caused this in Peter and
[17:03] in First Peter chapter 5: 8 and N he
[17:07] wrote be sober be vigilant because your
[17:09] adversary the devil as a Roy and lion
[17:12] walketh about seeking whom he may
[17:16] devour who resist steadfast in the faith
[17:19] knowing the same afflictions are
[17:21] accomplished in your brethren that are
[17:23] in the world so Peter could speak
[17:25] personally saying I know Satan has
[17:27] desired to sift me like wait I know how
[17:30] he tries to agitate I know how you can
[17:32] be under pressure I know he could say I
[17:34] even know what it's like to walk with
[17:36] Christ and then be brought to a place to
[17:37] where you would even deny him he says
[17:40] because your adversary The Devil Makes
[17:42] due use of every opportunity every
[17:44] breath he's seeking to devour you he
[17:47] says resist him steadfast in the faith
[17:50] knowing that he's doing this to
[17:52] everybody he's doing this to all the
[17:54] Brethren so if you're undergoing
[17:56] something and you're facing a difficulty
[17:58] you're even in a crisis of Faith you're
[18:00] it's not unique to you Believers around
[18:03] the world for thousands of years have
[18:05] suffered the same trial of their faith
[18:08] they they have suffered the same
[18:10] questioning the same examining the same
[18:12] testing the same proving and so he says
[18:14] these things are accomplished in your
[18:16] brethren that are in the world I if with
[18:19] that in view here's Jesus acknowledging
[18:21] and even telling Peter Satan has desired
[18:24] to sift you like weak and in Peter's
[18:27] experience he's saying that the devil
[18:28] will make due use of every opportunity
[18:30] to do exactly that agitate you to the
[18:33] place where your faith is overthrown
[18:35] that's his objective and that's his goal
[18:38] now Jesus was not expressing to Peter
[18:41] that he had an adversary that was going
[18:43] to seek make take advantage of every
[18:46] opportunity could to destroy him in
[18:47] order for Peter to
[18:49] be scared looking over his shoulder
[18:52] peeking around corners waiting for the
[18:54] devil to show up but he told him to give
[18:56] him courage he says I've prayed for for
[18:58] you that your faith fail not and when
[19:00] thou are strengthen when you are
[19:01] converted strengthen thy Brethren so for
[19:03] us Prophecies of hardship are even a
[19:07] even a prophecy of death is never meant
[19:09] to cause fear or
[19:11] weakness if if the Lord prophesied that
[19:14] you were to die it would not be to cause
[19:16] you cause fear or weakness but actually
[19:18] to give you boldness to face it so
[19:21] there's no prophecy of difficulty
[19:24] there's no prophecy of trial or hardship
[19:26] that should come upon the body of Christ
[19:28] that should ever cause us to worry or to
[19:31] fear or start tra trying to make
[19:34] man-made things to get through it or or
[19:37] or put things in place and procedures in
[19:39] place and safety net say well if there's
[19:41] going to be this happening there's going
[19:42] to be that happening and then begin to
[19:44] act out of fear just stay steady stand
[19:47] still and watch God come on the
[19:50] scene in the message anointed ones at
[19:52] the end time brother brandham says an
[19:56] eagle is a special built bird
[19:59] there's nothing like him on the earth if
[20:02] a buzzer try to follow him or any other
[20:04] bird he'd disintegrate his folies would
[20:06] be made manifest sure enough now there
[20:09] might be a lot of focus on the Buzzard
[20:11] and his Foles being made manifest but so
[20:14] this is the maybe the negative take the
[20:15] opposite this applies to the eagle and
[20:18] opposite because an eagle is a special
[20:20] built bird he says he's talking about
[20:22] the Buzzard he would blow up he'd
[20:24] disintegrate which means the eagle
[20:26] won't he says his body isn't put to
[20:28] together with the structure to hold him
[20:30] up there which means the Eagles is right
[20:33] when he gets in them great spheres up
[20:34] yonder he wasn't made ordained
[20:37] predestinated born an eagle he'll bust
[20:39] to Pieces but the made Eagle can soar in
[20:43] those spheres in a place of pressure he
[20:46] says the feathers would fly out of his
[20:48] wings but not for the eagle and he'd
[20:49] fall to the Earth but not for the eagle
[20:51] sure he can't follow the eagle in height
[20:53] if he tries his folly will be made
[20:55] manifest that means the eagle under
[20:58] pressure pressure at these high heights
[21:00] and however you want to phrase this and
[21:02] not getting bogged down in the science
[21:03] of which bird can fly the highest he's
[21:05] merely using something in the natural to
[21:07] try to type something that is for sure a
[21:09] truth in the spiritual that the believer
[21:11] is made for pressures that everyone else
[21:13] isn't made for that the believer can
[21:16] experience things go through things
[21:17] endure things hardships afflictions
[21:19] persecutions and not fall apart not lose
[21:22] their feathers not crumble not
[21:23] disintegrate not because of the
[21:25] profession that comes out of their mouth
[21:27] but a character that God has placed in
[21:30] them from the beginning he's made you
[21:32] that way he's made you that you could
[21:34] endure these things he's made you that
[21:36] you could go through this so it's not
[21:38] there's no fear of
[21:39] failure those there's no fear of folly
[21:43] but the pressure reveals your true
[21:45] character the higher it goes the longer
[21:47] it goes the harder it gets the more
[21:49] pressure there is it's revealing your
[21:51] true character so that's why I'm
[21:53] focusing on this you were made for this
[21:56] and that there's nothing we ought to
[21:58] fear because God's word has already
[22:00] spoken something very certain and that's
[22:02] what we focus on not the uncertainties
[22:04] but the things that are very certain and
[22:06] now trying to and and I I think I've
[22:10] been maybe spending too much time
[22:11] reviewing and that's why we don't get as
[22:14] far as we would like to get and I want
[22:16] to pick up where we were on Wednesday
[22:18] night on how brother Brandon made
[22:20] statements about a squeeze or
[22:22] persecution and he did not prophesy
[22:24] these things to cause
[22:26] Despair and to cause us to speculate and
[22:29] to worry and to fear and to guess could
[22:31] it be this could it be this is how how
[22:34] cruel is the vice president elect
[22:36] because if if Vice pres if
[22:37] president-elect Biden doesn't live very
[22:40] long because he seems so frail then
[22:42] who's gonna is this woman G to become
[22:43] president and is that going to be 10 um
[22:46] uh perhaps 12 years you know depending
[22:49] on what the rules are I don't know I'm a
[22:50] lawyer and I don't know you know how how
[22:52] many years can she run if she assumes
[22:54] the presidency because a resignation or
[22:57] something by the president and she could
[22:59] be elected to two more terms after she
[23:00] serves out Joe Biden and you're thinking
[23:02] could this be 12 years of Terror could
[23:05] this be 12 years of of what brother
[23:07] Brandon prophesied we don't know but we
[23:10] do know he did say certain things that
[23:12] we can be absolutely certain of and so
[23:15] he didn't say these things so that we
[23:16] would speculate guess and in our own
[23:18] guesses once we speculate say sure looks
[23:20] like it could
[23:21] be we don't do that we say I do know
[23:24] that what he said carried with it a
[23:27] promise and that regardless of the
[23:29] interpretation regardless of the
[23:30] Fulfillment the prophecy also points to
[23:33] a promise that he will perfect and he
[23:34] will provide and he will protect in the
[23:36] midst of the Fulfillment of the prophecy
[23:39] and so he shared these things and we're
[23:40] going to look at them again in the
[23:42] message Look Away to Jesus I apologize
[23:45] for not keeping up with this in the
[23:47] message Look Away to Jesus and these
[23:49] State statements that we're going to
[23:50] rehearse to you
[23:51] again the focus what he when he shares
[23:54] these things he shares them as a
[23:56] foundational point for his sermon so it
[23:58] wasn't the conclusion it was the
[24:01] foundation so it wasn't in the end
[24:03] there's going to be great trouble coming
[24:05] so watch the third pull then and then
[24:06] we're kind of like okay well let me know
[24:08] when the Trouble Comes because man once
[24:11] that trouble gets here I better watch
[24:12] the third pull then but until then we
[24:15] wait for the trouble and we almost take
[24:17] it as this was the conclusion of the
[24:19] matter so what we do just in physical in
[24:22] a physical sense we say all right then
[24:24] I'm going to look for The Squeeze so
[24:26] we're always looking for the pers ution
[24:29] and so here's the third pull over here
[24:31] but we're looking because whenever
[24:33] whenever the squeeze come whenever that
[24:36] comes I need to look over there so as
[24:39] soon as I think I see it and then all of
[24:40] a sudden there's a pandemic right and
[24:42] all the churches are getting shut down
[24:44] what does everybody do is this it huh
[24:47] and then everything kind of relaxes a
[24:48] little bit eases up everybody goes back
[24:50] to work and it's like okay maybe that
[24:51] wasn't it that wasn't it and what's
[24:53] happened is we're more squeez
[24:55] Lookers and persecution searchers than
[24:58] doing what we ought to do because he
[25:00] said this is a foundational point to the
[25:01] sermon Look Away to
[25:04] Jesus forget about those things they're
[25:07] going to come regardless if it's
[25:08] prophecy it's going to happen and you
[25:10] can't stop
[25:11] it no matter if we left right now and we
[25:14] went and prayed for the next 72 hours
[25:16] fasted and prayed in front of the
[25:17] elections Commission in Phoenix that the
[25:20] ballots would change miraculously that's
[25:22] not going to change
[25:24] prophecy God has spoken it's going to
[25:26] come to pass so the focus should be on
[25:28] the word that keeps us and protects Us
[25:31] in the persecution or the pressure that
[25:33] is to come whatever it may be instead of
[25:35] waiting for it to come and then in that
[25:37] moment of trial and tribulation like
[25:39] this is it this is the time hurry up
[25:40] real quick where's the third pull where
[25:42] is it he said we know what it is and
[25:45] what it does it's thoroughly identified
[25:46] it's been properly Vindicated what is
[25:49] it that's not the time to get into it I
[25:53] if you feel a little relief right now if
[25:54] you feel well things are looking okay
[25:56] and we had an election and we're getting
[25:57] through it and and yeah it might be
[25:59] harder on business and taxes might be
[26:01] different and there might be more of
[26:02] this there might be more of that but you
[26:04] know what we've been through democratic
[26:05] presidents before we've been through
[26:07] when the whole Congress was controlled
[26:09] by uh the Democrats we can make it we're
[26:11] going to be able to make
[26:13] it right I mean we could just look back
[26:16] on history and say we haven't it didn't
[26:17] fall to pieces even in the 60s when
[26:19] Kennedy himself which seemed to embody
[26:21] these very things that brother was
[26:22] talking it still
[26:23] continued and then when Bill Clinton who
[26:26] was a beatnick thought now this is
[26:28] fulfilling all the prophecy and all the
[26:30] quotes are being trotted out this is
[26:31] another Kennedy this is another Kennedy
[26:33] this is another we made it and what did
[26:35] we get we got a George
[26:38] Bush God bless
[26:41] him and and so there's all we have to be
[26:44] careful that we don't get caught in this
[26:46] mindset that's going to be a particular
[26:48] way prophecy is going to be fil
[26:49] fulfilled no matter what our our our
[26:51] focus is on the word because if it's not
[26:54] we get relaxed in a time like
[26:55] this we have to be we have to aim
[26:58] fellowship with brother Burley Williams
[27:00] it reminds me there's I I hear from a
[27:02] different Pastor every week from around
[27:03] the world that wants to greet you and uh
[27:06] and so there's a a pastor brother
[27:07] Andreas Bal in Switzerland who wanted to
[27:10] greet you and brother Tim dods wanted to
[27:12] greet you brother Bley Williams wanted
[27:13] to greet you that's just in like the
[27:14] past week so there's a lot of people
[27:15] that praying for you A lot of people
[27:17] excited about what God is doing and and
[27:20] I don't even know why I started sharing
[27:23] that but our Focus has got to be on the
[27:27] word that's right
[27:28] not the other things that are taking
[27:29] place it was brother bur that shared
[27:31] that you have to be aimed at and St and
[27:34] stay focused or you get relaxed you got
[27:37] to be a you got to keep your aim and if
[27:39] we if our aim's not on the word then we
[27:40] start looking at things say well the
[27:41] pressure is kind of easing up a little
[27:43] bit then you're then you you get relaxed
[27:46] and that's gives the devil the room to
[27:48] work so even if this morning we focus on
[27:51] a lot of statements that relate to
[27:54] pressure persecution squeeze it's not to
[27:57] take your eyes off the off the word to
[27:59] that in itself but to put it in the
[28:02] context that brother brand was sharing
[28:03] these things about a squeeze a tighten
[28:06] of persecution in the context of the
[28:08] third poll so we can only understand it
[28:10] as we look at the word because the
[28:13] persecution The Squeeze these tightening
[28:15] that's to come it's actually not just in
[28:16] the context of the third pole but it's
[28:18] an opposition against it so the devil
[28:21] can win if we're merely distracted from
[28:23] it so we got to be focused on the word
[28:26] now brother bradam says these statements
[28:27] and now now I I want to go quickly
[28:30] through this he says the third pole has
[28:32] now been
[28:33] Vindicated he says now it will not be
[28:36] used in a great way until this Council
[28:37] begins to tighten up and when it does
[28:39] when that does and then it's a fragment
[28:41] he says the Pentecostal and so forth can
[28:43] almost impersonate anything could be
[28:45] done so the tightening seems to relate
[28:48] to some
[28:50] impersonation some some expression some
[28:52] manifestation something so close he says
[28:55] but when that time comes when the
[28:57] squeeze comes down so now the squeeze is
[28:59] act he's relating The Squeeze to a
[29:01] Pentecostal
[29:03] impersonation isn't that interesting so
[29:05] if you if you can put it in that in that
[29:07] in that in those categories when the
[29:09] squeeze comes down then you'll see what
[29:10] you've seen temporarily be manifested in
[29:13] the fullness of its power now we
[29:16] identified in several places how the
[29:18] third pool is rapturing Faith it's the
[29:21] open of the word to give the bride
[29:22] rapturing faith in those few places we
[29:24] saw that continuity and that theme that
[29:26] the third pool is not some date in a
[29:28] future calendar that brother bam is
[29:30] identified and he looks at his plan and
[29:32] goes oh there it is third pull is on
[29:33] that day that that's not a future event
[29:36] but rather it's the word which is
[29:38] present the revelation of Jesus Christ
[29:40] brother brandham brought this word
[29:42] revealed this message to us we're still
[29:44] connected to it tied to it and this is
[29:46] the word that's feeding us and we're
[29:47] feeding on the message and we're still
[29:49] listening to those sermons and it's
[29:50] revealing to us Jesus Christ and the
[29:53] fullness of the power of this message is
[29:55] to be changed in our atom
[29:58] to go to meet the Lord in the air so he
[30:01] says you've got you've had the word you
[30:02] know what to look for and how to stand
[30:05] and he says talking about the pulls he
[30:07] says I think if you'll think real
[30:08] closely You Are Spiritual as the Bible
[30:11] said here's to him that has wisdom the
[30:12] third pull is properly identified we
[30:16] know where it is the third pole is here
[30:19] and then he says I'm not he wasn't to
[30:21] explain it but he says this will be the
[30:22] thing in my opinion that'll start the
[30:24] rapturing faith for the going away so
[30:28] it's thoroughly identified it's properly
[30:30] Vindicated it's here and it's for
[30:32] rapturing Faith it's for the the
[30:34] rapturing of the Bride so he's saying
[30:36] when that Council begins to tighten up
[30:38] when the squeeze comes down and this is
[30:40] really the only place that the squeeze
[30:42] is mentioned in specifically in relation
[30:44] to the third pool but we hear the
[30:46] squeeze mentioned a lot don't we when
[30:49] the squeeze comes when the squeeze comes
[30:50] and I remember as a young Minister I
[30:52] thought man am I going to have enough
[30:53] paper to print out all the quotes where
[30:56] brother M talks about the squeeze in
[30:57] relation to the third point I realized I
[30:59] could write this by hand you know it's
[31:01] just a just a one little statement where
[31:03] he refers to it but he also talks about
[31:05] tightening in these things so he says
[31:08] wait he says that wait till the time
[31:10] comes and he talks about the time coming
[31:12] then he says this there's coming A Time
[31:14] In This Nation where this nation is
[31:15] going to exercise all the power that the
[31:17] Beast had which was Pagan Rome then it
[31:20] become papal Rome this nation will do
[31:23] that Revelations 13 explains it he talks
[31:26] about how the lamb comes up speaks like
[31:28] a dragon he says don't you see Roman
[31:30] denomination a marked Protestant
[31:32] denomination an image under the beast
[31:34] making a power that'll force all
[31:36] Protestants like a union you'll have to
[31:38] be in this Council of churches you won't
[31:40] be able to have Fellowship well it's
[31:41] practically that way now and what do we
[31:43] see happen in brother bram's Ministry
[31:44] every door was closed to him if that
[31:47] hadn't been for the Full Gospel
[31:48] businessman's uh breakfast and
[31:50] conventions every door would have been
[31:52] closed to him that's why he was so
[31:54] grateful to brother Perry for starting a
[31:56] church in Tucson he said I couldn't do
[31:58] it he says i'm' so glad you
[32:00] did why because it was there was all the
[32:03] doors were closing it was the very
[32:05] fulfillment of these things they're
[32:06] putting them out putting them out after
[32:07] he preached these things even said when
[32:09] he's preaching the seals when I say this
[32:11] thousands T thousands of my friends are
[32:12] going to leave me over what the revealed
[32:14] word over what the third pull of his
[32:17] ministry it was those things that caused
[32:19] him to go away he says it's practically
[32:21] that way now you can't go to church and
[32:23] pre preach unless you have a fellowship
[32:24] card or some identification do you
[32:27] believe this doctor do you believe that
[32:28] doctor how do you see it and you and you
[32:30] now in persons like ourselves we're
[32:32] going to be cut out of that all together
[32:34] that's exactly because they won't be
[32:36] able to do it it's tightening they won't
[32:37] be able to force you into that Union so
[32:39] you'll be left out of that economy
[32:41] you'll be left out not a literal economy
[32:43] is as far as markets and buying and
[32:45] selling but rather even a spiritual
[32:48] economy or Fellowship you're left out of
[32:50] that they won't be able to push you into
[32:51] it it's tightening and when that time
[32:53] comes and the Press comes to a place
[32:56] where you're pressed out then then watch
[32:58] what I'm fixing to tell you in a few
[33:00] minutes watch the third pull then and
[33:03] what he began to tell them in the next
[33:04] few minutes was Look Away to Jesus so he
[33:06] says watch the third pool then it'll be
[33:09] absolutely to the total loss but it'll
[33:10] be for the bride and the church so the
[33:13] third pull is to the totally lost to the
[33:15] church and to the bride there's
[33:17] something in what's revealed in the open
[33:19] of the word that speaks to the totally
[33:21] lost that speaks to the church that
[33:23] speaks to the bride we know the totally
[33:25] lost will partake in the second death we
[33:28] know the church will have to go through
[33:29] tribulation and face white Throne
[33:31] judgment but the bride is raptured
[33:33] before
[33:35] tribulation and so he's connecting the
[33:37] tightening the persecution and the
[33:39] squeeze to the spirit of Rome he said
[33:42] Pagan Rome now papal Rome and when he
[33:44] does that he's identifying a particular
[33:48] spirit that persecutes and crucifies the
[33:52] revealed word so this is going to be in
[33:55] the name of Christianity it's going to
[33:56] be in the name of of unity wherein the
[33:59] word is crucified and the word is
[34:04] persecuted now this in the the summer of
[34:08] 64 brother brandham preaches a series of
[34:11] sermons if you take it from I think it's
[34:13] the trial that he preaches in Topeka you
[34:14] take from that sermon and it may be the
[34:17] Mighty God unveiled and listen all the
[34:18] way through question and answers and
[34:20] just and follow through with it
[34:22] listening to each one you hear brother
[34:24] brandham laying things out and
[34:25] expressing things in such depth and such
[34:27] deep detail that you realize there has
[34:29] been something that is crystallized in
[34:32] brother bram's Revelation where he's so
[34:34] focused on revealing Jesus Christ he's
[34:37] so focused on introducing the bride to
[34:39] the revealed word her mate which is what
[34:41] he refers to in this message Feast of
[34:43] the trumpets and things have become so
[34:45] clear that he's even more clear now on
[34:48] what kind of persecution and squeeze and
[34:51] tightening they'll be on the bride and I
[34:53] think I'll try to do it Wednesday night
[34:56] just seeding this in here for maybe
[34:57] Wednesday night if the Lord would lead
[34:59] looking at the things that brother
[35:01] brandham was identifying in 1963 that
[35:04] were causing him to see a physical
[35:06] persecution coming to the church but
[35:08] then how it transitions we realize there
[35:10] is a physical persecution coming to the
[35:12] church by the totally lost but the bride
[35:15] she is being pressed now Tried by the
[35:18] word tested proved now by the word but
[35:20] before it comes to the place that the
[35:23] Beast would exercise power over her to
[35:25] harm her to take her life or to to take
[35:28] things away from her she goes in a
[35:30] Rapture and so the message speaks to the
[35:32] trumpets and he's referring to
[35:33] Revelations chapter 9 verses 14- 16 he
[35:38] says he says this it was spiritual
[35:40] horses now those the 200 million demons
[35:44] that were loosed he says there spiritual
[35:46] horses spiritual Devils Chargers that
[35:49] have been bound in the Euphrates all
[35:50] these years Supernatural Devils what was
[35:53] it the old Roman empire being revived
[35:56] the persecution of the Jews now the Jews
[36:00] relate to the promise physically they
[36:02] are given a physical Promised Land the
[36:04] Gentile bride has a spiritual promised
[36:06] land they receive a physical Messiah we
[36:10] receive a spiritual Messiah they
[36:12] received a physical circumcision we
[36:14] receive a spiritual circumcision we see
[36:16] these these parallels uh these opposites
[36:19] so he says they this Roman Empire was
[36:21] revived in persecution of the Jews they
[36:23] were bound there 200,000 Devils of
[36:25] persecution now and notice what happens
[36:28] under the Sixth trumpet they were turned
[36:29] loose on the Jews the persecution of the
[36:32] Jews Supernatural Devils nearly 2,000
[36:35] years then Loos by Stalin Hitler upon
[36:37] the Jews you say well that isn't Rome
[36:39] it's the same
[36:41] spirit and and why he says they done the
[36:43] same thing they did to Christians in the
[36:45] old Pagan Rome what was the martyrdom of
[36:47] the church he says now watch natural
[36:50] Israel and the spiritual church now as
[36:53] we separate it here turned loose on the
[36:55] Jews so he wants you to se separate
[36:57] between natural Israel and the spiritual
[37:00] church how there was something naturally
[37:02] loosed upon the Jews but the spiritual
[37:04] church is going to is suffer this
[37:06] somewhat differently so there is
[37:08] skipping that was paragraph 160 now this
[37:10] is 182 now the ecclesiastical realm has
[37:13] been opened from the natural Revival of
[37:15] the old Pagan Rome and he says went
[37:17] forth on the Jews which was always been
[37:19] their enemy The Lion the teeth and
[37:20] everything it stomped down broke out the
[37:22] people Roman Rome has always been God's
[37:24] enemy and we can see that represented in
[37:26] the Gospels how it was the Romans who
[37:29] were ruling and reigning there in Judea
[37:30] which brought the final uh crucifixion
[37:33] of Jesus Christ he says and it turned
[37:35] loose In The Same Spirit by the
[37:36] dictators of the world because the
[37:38] religious system was still holding now
[37:41] it's been
[37:42] loosed says what has it done so it was I
[37:46] want to point this out it was loosed in
[37:49] the dictators of the world because the
[37:51] religious system was holding because
[37:53] says now it's been loosed so it's not
[37:56] through the dictators of the world it's
[37:57] not through natural government it's not
[37:58] going to be physical remember the
[38:00] statement that it's the power of God
[38:01] that puts the bride put puts the bride
[38:04] in her position and takes her in the
[38:05] Rapture not National Force so he says
[38:09] this now what has it done in the
[38:11] cunningness as he said it came in like
[38:15] flatteries he's bringing the Protestant
[38:17] ecumenical council of the world churches
[38:19] the spirit of the Antichrist upon both
[38:21] of them bringing them to the slaughter
[38:24] just like they did the other in the hour
[38:26] to call the bride so while this
[38:29] Gathering is happening which is going to
[38:30] be a gathering to a Slaughter it's in
[38:33] the hour there's a calling of the Bride
[38:35] says you say the church has to go
[38:37] through the persecution for the
[38:38] Perfection of
[38:40] it sorry I I'm I'm skipping a little bit
[38:42] here so let me just get my
[38:44] place it's in and that hour to call the
[38:47] bride loosed in the ecclesiastical
[38:49] Church spirit so it's loosed 200 million
[38:52] demons are now loosed not through the
[38:54] dictators of the world and governments
[38:56] specifically but it's loosed in a church
[38:58] Spirit an ecclesiastical Church Spirit
[39:01] loosed upon what not upon the
[39:03] denominations upon the bride meaning its
[39:08] focus or its attack just as dictators
[39:11] Focus their attack on the Jews now this
[39:14] ecumenical Spirit through denominations
[39:16] through a church spirit is focusing its
[39:18] attack on the bride but here you'll get
[39:21] the bride will not go through that
[39:24] time what time the Gathering to together
[39:27] for a
[39:28] Slaughter so he says the Bible says not
[39:31] the church will but not the bride can't
[39:34] you see ministers can't you see that
[39:36] Brethren you say the church has to go
[39:38] through the persecution for the
[39:39] Perfection of it the blood of Jesus
[39:41] Christ perfects the bride a man who
[39:43] would choose his wife don't put her
[39:45] through a lot of
[39:47] punishment she's already found Grace
[39:49] he's already found Grace with her she's
[39:51] found Grace with him he's engaged to her
[39:54] and if there's anything he will keep her
[39:57] from every place to turn her hand words
[40:00] if there was anything that would keep
[40:01] that Union from happening he'll he'll
[40:04] step in he'll intervene to be sure that
[40:06] the union takes place his grace is so
[40:08] great upon them and so will it be upon
[40:10] the bride and so is it upon the bride we
[40:13] unworthy creatures deserving of hell but
[40:14] his grace holds us through it now
[40:18] brother bradam is specifically
[40:19] identifying 200 million demons loosed in
[40:22] an ecclesiastical spiritual realm
[40:24] through denominations against the elect
[40:27] against the word against the bride which
[40:29] will culminate after the bride's gone in
[40:32] in the mark of the beast and not being
[40:34] able to buy or sell even though brother
[40:36] mam says that's the the take the mark of
[40:38] the beast in the head would be to
[40:40] believe their Doctrine and the hand
[40:41] would be to support it so I'm always a
[40:43] little leery when someone forwards me
[40:45] something says look at this microchip
[40:46] technology could it be the mark of the
[40:48] beast I said I'm just going to go with a
[40:50] known known what brother brandham said
[40:52] it was in the forehead to believe the
[40:54] doctor in the hand to support it and so
[40:56] it's not a literal Mark in that sense
[40:58] then it's spiritual but yet it's going
[41:01] to have enough power to bring seduce
[41:03] everybody and cause them to behave a
[41:04] certain way act a certain way and we
[41:06] don't know what the exact interpretation
[41:08] will be when it's brought to pass but we
[41:09] do know when that time comes when that
[41:12] Antichrist is going to assume full
[41:14] control upon the Earth the bride which
[41:16] has been keeping him from doing that
[41:17] will be gone amen because only he will
[41:20] uh hold back until she is taken out of
[41:23] the way and so he's he's showing that
[41:28] the bride before it comes to a place of
[41:31] physical persecution before it comes to
[41:33] a place wherein the church is going to
[41:36] be challenged and pressed and they have
[41:38] to give their lives and shed their blood
[41:39] the bride is already gone because the
[41:42] bride will not go through tribulation
[41:45] saying his grace is so great upon her
[41:47] her favor is towards her that he'll do
[41:49] everything he can to take her in a
[41:51] Rapture before it comes to that place CU
[41:54] she doesn't need that for her
[41:56] Perfection we individually go through
[41:58] suffering go through difficulties
[42:00] hardships to perfect our character but
[42:02] when it comes to our our perfection in
[42:05] the word it's by this bleeding bloody
[42:07] word it's by the word of God that the
[42:09] bride is made perfect and we're the
[42:11] bride does not need to go through
[42:13] purging or tribulation to come out on
[42:15] the other end perfect she's already
[42:16] perfect in his eyes if I could just say
[42:19] this maybe as a personal conviction that
[42:22] really what's holding it away is for us
[42:23] to realize that we are perfect tell the
[42:27] the full realization that we're we're
[42:29] sinless and being sinless death has no
[42:31] hold over us and and this is where I
[42:33] think this transition it just comes up
[42:35] in my heart and this is what originally
[42:38] caused me to go down this pathway is if
[42:40] we won't fear death we won't fear
[42:46] anything so it is a spiritual
[42:48] persecution that brother bram's
[42:50] identifying in the cunningness in the
[42:52] flatteries and it's specifically related
[42:54] to an attack against the truth so it's a
[42:57] spiritual persecution that targets the
[42:58] bride not physical or material
[43:01] suffering does that mean a bride member
[43:04] doesn't suffer physically no it doesn't
[43:06] mean that does it mean that they won't
[43:07] suffer materially that doesn't mean that
[43:09] there's message churches that are shut
[43:11] down there's message ministers cast into
[43:12] prison but as far as that being the
[43:14] Fulfillment of these prophecies no many
[43:17] are the afflictions of the righteous all
[43:19] that will live Godly in Christ Jesus
[43:21] shall suffer persecution we realize
[43:23] churches can be closed and things can
[43:25] happen in economics and tax laws and and
[43:27] and and even just persecution within a
[43:29] community that can cause hardships and
[43:31] difficulties and bodies to be restricted
[43:33] and and things could happen there
[43:36] there's any number of things that could
[43:37] happen we don't know specifically what
[43:40] tomorrow holds but we know who holds
[43:42] tomorrow and we know what he has said
[43:44] about certain things and we know before
[43:46] it gets to a certain point we've got to
[43:48] be
[43:49] gone and so my focus isn't trying to
[43:51] test just how far this can go my focus
[43:53] is looking at Jesus I want to get out of
[43:55] here
[43:57] and so these prophecies and this
[43:59] spiritual persecution is going to be
[44:00] just that it's going to be cunnings and
[44:02] flatteries and these are the Hallmarks
[44:05] of that religious system that brother
[44:06] bandam says will be so close as the
[44:08] Pentecostals and so forth can almost
[44:10] imperson anything when the squeeze comes
[44:13] down so think about
[44:15] that it's a it's this he identifies
[44:18] these characteristics even in
[44:20] Revelations 13 this the way that this
[44:22] thing will represent itself it's going
[44:24] to be so close to the truth right
[44:27] now forgive me especially since I think
[44:30] the election has been decided no offense
[44:32] to anybody who's wanting them to stop
[44:34] counting some places keep counting in
[44:37] others but Donald Trump president Trump
[44:40] was not close you know at all in my
[44:43] opinion as far as someone who's going to
[44:44] be so close would deceive the elect
[44:47] uh I mean I I'm not going to be reading
[44:51] from two Corinthians today and so uh
[44:54] what's your favorite verse in the Bible
[44:55] Bible which Bible so I I don't think
[44:57] that the the so close isn't going to be
[44:59] a political realm the so close isn't
[45:02] going to be in an e economic realm with
[45:05] economies and politics the so close has
[45:07] got to be something that presents itself
[45:09] spiritually pleasing appealing to the
[45:12] flesh something that would get so close
[45:15] that the bride would think well this has
[45:17] got to be this is could this be is this
[45:21] it and in Matthew chap 24: 24 it says
[45:24] for there shall arise false Christ and
[45:27] false prophets and show great signs and
[45:29] wonders in so much that if it were
[45:33] possible they shall deceive the very
[45:35] elect
[45:39] right you you you better rest in the
[45:42] grace of
[45:43] God because the fact that you can't be
[45:45] deceived is because he's made it
[45:47] impossible that's the only reason why
[45:49] you can't be deceived is it's an
[45:51] impossibility by God's design and by
[45:53] God's choosing but if you could Ponder
[45:56] just how close a false Christ a false
[45:59] prophet and what signs and wonders and
[46:01] gifts and things would be manifest that
[46:04] the elect could be deceived but for it
[46:08] being impossible for her to be deceived
[46:10] how close would that have to
[46:12] be and brother bam says this in the
[46:14] message Discerning the body of the Lord
[46:17] he says the last plague that hit Egypt
[46:19] was
[46:22] death that last plague that hits the
[46:24] church is spiritual death
[46:27] I believe that this will hold true now
[46:30] that as we are by God's grace going to
[46:33] emerge from this uh covid-19 through
[46:36] whatever discipline that takes
[46:38] personally or whatever measures that
[46:39] need to be put into place I just believe
[46:41] by God's grace I'm praying that it's
[46:43] something that will get Beyond we won't
[46:44] have to see any more people die from
[46:46] this but if there is another plague that
[46:48] comes upon the whole world just remember
[46:52] the only plague that falls upon the
[46:55] entire world that the bride is exempt
[46:58] from is the spiritual plague of
[47:02] death when it comes to the message and
[47:04] what brother bam taught he did not teach
[47:06] us that there's going to be a time when
[47:08] all the brid is upon Earth and her tests
[47:11] are coming back negative and everyone
[47:13] else is coming back positive the only
[47:15] test that we pass that no one else
[47:17] passes is the word test and so he says
[47:21] here the last plague what that hits the
[47:24] church is spiritual death what we need
[47:26] is a spiritual Awakening A Spiritual
[47:28] Awakening to
[47:31] discernment why because this last plague
[47:33] that hits the church is like the squeeze
[47:35] of a python brother B describes in the
[47:38] church age book that kills out the
[47:40] spirituality of the church says it's
[47:43] like the false Vine that winds itself
[47:45] around it what does it do it chokes out
[47:47] the life so when you see a vine vines
[47:49] can be growing up and if you you don't
[47:51] know which one is which you don't know
[47:54] is this the true is this the false when
[47:56] it it comes to that python wrapping
[47:58] itself around and squeezing the life out
[48:00] of it it's something that presents
[48:01] itself in a subtle seducing way he says
[48:04] the last plague that hits the church is
[48:07] spiritual death and that we need an
[48:09] Awakening to spiritual discernment so
[48:12] that's what we need a spiritual
[48:14] discernment to recognize the squeeze of
[48:15] a python not the squeeze of politics and
[48:18] governments and economies listen if
[48:20] you're going through a financial squeeze
[48:22] be honest with how financially
[48:24] responsible you are and don't blame your
[48:27] financial problems on the squeeze now
[48:30] brother brandham said no be real with
[48:32] yourself am I being responsible at least
[48:35] have this conviction that God has given
[48:37] you enough time in the day and enough
[48:39] money in the bank it's just a matter of
[48:41] using both
[48:42] wisely and if I could be use it more
[48:44] wisely then I can have enough instead of
[48:47] just blank just taking a quote well
[48:49] brother Ram said you and using these SE
[48:52] an excuse no financial difficulty and a
[48:54] financial squeeze isn't the way that
[48:56] this is going to be challenging to the
[48:58] believer it's the spiritual python that
[49:01] squeezes up the spirituality and life of
[49:02] the
[49:03] believer so in unveiling of God brother
[49:05] bam says this he says you remember the
[49:09] last plague in Egypt was Death Before
[49:11] The Exodus the last plague on the earth
[49:13] is spiritual Death Before The
[49:16] Exodus then they'll be cremated and
[49:19] turned back into dust and the righteous
[49:20] will walk out upon their ashes but the
[49:22] last thing is spiritual death rejecting
[49:26] the word
[49:28] so we could say for certainty that death
[49:29] and plagues and judgment and tribulation
[49:31] are coming but upon the bride the
[49:34] promises not one
[49:36] drop right not one drop Noah was safe in
[49:39] the ark before one drop fell so the
[49:42] bride is secure She is safe from any
[49:45] prophecy of judgment that's to come upon
[49:47] the church she's safe from any prophecy
[49:49] of Calamity or destruction that's going
[49:51] to come upon the whole earth and that
[49:53] and that and it's going to cause loss of
[49:54] life and this great massive scale I'm
[49:56] I'm not talking about plagues I'm
[49:57] talking about the judgments of God not
[49:59] talking about just diseases the
[50:00] judgments of God coming upon the Earth
[50:02] the bride is gone before that happens
[50:05] but the last thing that challenges the
[50:07] whole world while we're still here that
[50:09] we need spiritual discernment to
[50:11] recognize and to catch is spiritual
[50:15] [Music]
[50:16] death and so as brother brandham laid it
[50:18] out in Feast of the trumpets the
[50:21] pressure upon the elect is not the same
[50:22] as it was on the
[50:24] Jews and even it's not the same as it
[50:26] was upon the early church his brother
[50:28] said this is the Revival of old Pagan
[50:30] Rome or the papal Rome that crucified
[50:32] the Christians and destroyed the
[50:33] Christians and even Pagan r that
[50:35] crucified Christ it's revived in the
[50:37] persecution of the Christian and and
[50:40] it's revived in the H persecution of the
[50:43] Jews the persecution on the Jews in the
[50:45] early church the persecution on the Jews
[50:47] in this last century and the persecution
[50:49] on the early church is not the same as
[50:51] it is upon the bride so you had the
[50:54] martyrs in the early church that was
[50:56] something that they endured by prophecy
[50:58] that the word said would happen it's the
[51:00] same Spirit but a different
[51:02] manifestation of the
[51:03] persecution and you can see this by
[51:06] identifying the protection that God
[51:08] sends the church in the time of the
[51:11] persecution so so what I'm what I'm
[51:13] setting forth right now is that the
[51:15] spirits that bring persecution it
[51:18] manifested in the early church on the
[51:20] Jews to where they were martyred The
[51:22] Same Spirit manifested itself in the
[51:24] early church as in martyrdom to where
[51:26] the the spirit that was against the
[51:29] church produced a loss of life on when
[51:33] they were challenged according to what
[51:34] they believe the disciples the apostles
[51:36] being martyred for the cause of Christ
[51:38] and the early church being martyred for
[51:40] the cause of Christ and the spirit that
[51:42] God gives in that time speaks to the
[51:45] kind of persecution that's coming upon
[51:47] the body because we'll notice this in
[51:50] scripture God anointed them to go
[51:52] through this now in Revelations chap 4:
[51:55] 6 and 7
[51:57] says and Before the Throne there was a
[51:58] sea of glass like into Crystal and in
[52:01] the midst of the throne and round about
[52:02] The Throne were four beasts full of eyes
[52:04] for before full of eyes before and
[52:07] behind and the first Beast was like a
[52:10] lion and the second beast like a calf
[52:13] and the third Beast had a face as a man
[52:15] and the fourth Beast was like a you got
[52:18] to say it the way he says it a flying
[52:21] eagle not just an eagle a flying eagle I
[52:25] think that's important
[52:27] important I think it's really important
[52:28] to recognize that the this last Beast is
[52:32] a flying eagle not an Earthbound Eagle
[52:35] not not an eagle with its wings clipped
[52:37] not an eagle changed to a a h changed to
[52:40] a a pen that keeps it upon the Earth but
[52:42] a flying
[52:43] eagle so this is uh it's remember the
[52:46] eagle is made for
[52:48] pressure can fly into Realms that nobody
[52:50] else can follow so now this is the scene
[52:53] Before the Throne now brother Bram
[52:55] connects these things together
[52:57] and if I'm assuming too much by not
[52:59] taking more time to teach on this I know
[53:01] God will just lead me in that channel to
[53:03] be more patient to lay these things out
[53:04] to you as a church but in Revelations
[53:07] chap 6: 3 and 4 says and when he had
[53:10] opened the second seal and we and we
[53:12] were going to maybe read through all of
[53:14] them how that when the seal was opened
[53:15] there was a beast and when he had opened
[53:16] the second seal I heard the second beast
[53:18] say come and see and there went out
[53:20] another horse that was red and power was
[53:23] given to him that sat there on to take
[53:25] peace from the Earth and that they
[53:27] should kill one another and there was
[53:29] given unto him a great
[53:31] sword now in the first seal when the
[53:34] white horse rider went out riding that
[53:36] was not Jesus Christ that was the
[53:40] Antichrist and the Beast that was there
[53:43] before the throne in the form of a lion
[53:45] or in the spirit of a lion was a spirit
[53:47] that God raised up in that time to meet
[53:50] The Challenge from that white horse
[53:53] rider so now under the second seal
[53:57] he is showing this this now that under
[53:59] the second seal he said I heard the
[54:02] second be say come and see and it's the
[54:04] ox anointing that comes and combats the
[54:07] red horse so now it's in this fourth
[54:09] Church age where the church goes into
[54:11] the ground in martydom where which
[54:13] finally dies out goes into the ground BR
[54:15] brah says in one place he says the
[54:16] denominations are the
[54:18] dirt that's a remarkable statement he
[54:21] says there's your dirt maybe even the
[54:22] way he phrases it but it's it's this
[54:24] when this seal is opened now
[54:27] here's the red horse rider going out but
[54:29] it's the spirit the Bible says a calf
[54:31] but it's an ox anointing now to meet the
[54:34] intensity of this Antichrist Spirit
[54:36] that's coming against the church in that
[54:38] age and brother Braham says in God's
[54:39] chosen place of worship the next beats
[54:42] was an ox which is a beast of burden a
[54:45] sacrifice in the days of the Roman
[54:47] Church the Roman Cathedral the church
[54:49] died out
[54:50] sacrificed so I want to identify this
[54:53] that when the church was had when the
[54:55] Antichrist Spirit had evolve from the
[54:57] White Horse to the red horse and now
[54:59] it's manifesting itself in the trying to
[55:02] Snuff out the church and the church
[55:04] actually dies and goes into the ground
[55:05] into this martyrdom brother saying there
[55:07] was a spirit a beast of burden a
[55:09] sacrifice on the church to do just that
[55:14] to shed their blood to give their lives
[55:16] as Martyrs this was an anointing that
[55:18] came upon the church so the the the the
[55:20] the church at that time had the spirit
[55:22] of an ox to be a
[55:24] martyr a calf if you even want to say a
[55:26] calf that would be taken to the
[55:28] slaughter they were anointed to be
[55:30] martyrs now watch in Romans chapter
[55:33] excuse me Revelations chapter 6 veres 7
[55:35] and 8 and when he had opened the fourth
[55:37] seal I heard the voice of the fourth
[55:39] Beast say come and see so now the Seal's
[55:42] open a beast says come and see and I
[55:44] looked and behold a Pale Horse and his
[55:47] name that sat on him was death and Hell
[55:50] Followed With Him and power was given
[55:53] unto them over the fourth part of the
[55:54] earth to kill with the sword and with
[55:56] hunger and with death and with the Beast
[55:59] of the earth so now when this seal is
[56:02] opened which is bringing us to the time
[56:04] of the leodan church age is bringing us
[56:06] to this very time and season that we're
[56:07] living in at the very close of this age
[56:09] even as we see some of these things come
[56:11] into perfect manifestation after the
[56:13] bride is gone brother Bram says in the
[56:15] fourth seal three powers United together
[56:18] all mixed up in a color
[56:21] pale death spoke in a whole thing Pol
[56:24] political and religious and demon powers
[56:27] mixed together so this is how it all
[56:30] gets mixed together politics religion
[56:33] and demon powers State and church United
[56:37] again political and religious but with
[56:39] the Demonic power behind it he says
[56:41] politics he's the king of politics Satan
[56:45] is
[56:47] amen I I said it Wednesday night and I
[56:49] don't know how many how many caught it
[56:51] but I said it's a shame that politics
[56:52] has become so
[56:54] political he's the king of politics
[56:56] itics it's always been political it's
[56:58] always been that way and so he's showing
[57:00] that the demon powers of Revelations
[57:03] chap 6 now come to a place where they're
[57:06] going to work they're going to manifest
[57:08] in a political religious and demonic
[57:11] power they're going to come to the head
[57:13] in the pale horse rider so now follow
[57:16] this because now we're in as we think
[57:17] this is the season we're living in this
[57:19] is the time that we're living in the
[57:20] demon powers are going to work
[57:22] spiritually again remember brother Ram
[57:23] said spiritually against the bride until
[57:25] this time
[57:27] because it's moving in an ecclesiastical
[57:29] realm in in the religious realm so these
[57:31] demon powers are working now in a
[57:33] religious realm demon powers in a
[57:34] religious L realm but one day it's going
[57:36] to unite together in political church
[57:38] and state United back
[57:40] together and so the pale horse rider
[57:43] rides out against the church but there's
[57:46] an eagle anointing upon the true
[57:49] bride and what kind of Eagle was it a
[57:52] flying eagle it wasn't a moping Eagle
[57:55] was wasn't a crawling Eagle it wasn't a
[57:57] scared Eagle it was a flying eagle so
[58:01] the pale horse rider is going to ride
[58:03] out upon the church it's going to take
[58:04] its full ride in that tribulation the P
[58:06] Horus Rider is going to have effect upon
[58:08] all those that are left upon the face of
[58:10] the Earth to kill with the sword with
[58:11] Hunger with death and the Beast of the
[58:13] Earth but there's an anointing of a
[58:14] flying eagle that comes and so it shows
[58:18] that as God gave the spirit of an ox in
[58:20] the day of the red horse rider because
[58:22] they were going to have to yield to that
[58:24] sword to die in this time he doesn't
[58:27] send the anointing of an ox he sends the
[58:29] anointing of a flying
[58:32] eagle why because you don't need to
[58:34] endure it and go through it until the
[58:37] very end when it takes its head in the
[58:38] image of the beast but rather you're
[58:40] gone in the Rapture before it comes to
[58:42] that
[58:43] time there shall arise false chres to sh
[58:47] in signs and wonders such Charisma and
[58:48] such magnitude to the point would
[58:50] deceive the elect of possible but now
[58:52] what does it say in Matthew CH 24:28 for
[58:55] wheresoever the marus says there will
[58:57] the Eagles be gathered together what
[59:00] kind of eagles flying
[59:03] Eagles gathered around the revealed word
[59:05] of the son of man in this hour right now
[59:07] right isn't that where we're gathered
[59:10] right now feeding on unfailing body word
[59:12] of the son of man knowing that what
[59:14] we're feeding on is going to actually
[59:16] cause a body to materialize and then
[59:18] where are these Flying Eagles going to
[59:19] go to a meeting in the
[59:21] air where we'll all have the same body
[59:24] gathered together to Christ in his
[59:26] glorified body because where the Eagles
[59:29] are right where that body is the Eagles
[59:33] are gathered together we're flying
[59:35] Eagles so it is the
[59:37] church that that is that faces the
[59:41] death that is under the the death under
[59:44] that pale horse rider but the bride is
[59:47] raptured under an eagle
[59:49] anointing so let's just settle this in
[59:52] our hearts the bride is not under a
[59:54] prophecy of death
[59:57] right we could at least settle that
[59:58] she's not under a prophecy of death she
[1:00:00] has the eagle
[1:00:02] anointing she is Anointed as an
[1:00:04] astronaut the bride age is the astronaut
[1:00:06] age to Fly Above denominations to Fly
[1:00:09] Above the Pentecostal age which is the
[1:00:11] Leo Dean age once you've heard the word
[1:00:14] of God for this hour you're raptured up
[1:00:15] quickly spiritually now right so you're
[1:00:19] not even in tune to what's going on here
[1:00:22] the our our sole consideration and
[1:00:24] concern right now for Leo
[1:00:26] is to get every seed out of it that is
[1:00:30] ordained to come out of it so the door
[1:00:32] has not closed I don't believe it's
[1:00:33] sealed off and I I believe in a bright
[1:00:35] age very very fervently very very
[1:00:37] passionately because brother Brandon
[1:00:39] believed in it but I'm not closing the
[1:00:40] door on leod DEA because I believe
[1:00:42] there's still souls to save in this
[1:00:43] Valley there's still family members that
[1:00:45] are going to come and be baptized you're
[1:00:46] going to see Transformations and changes
[1:00:49] in a very Supernatural way I'm believing
[1:00:51] for it why because we're looking now
[1:00:53] into Leo de seed and saying Lord show me
[1:00:55] that seed direct me to that last Soul
[1:00:57] because that one's got to be Qui quickly
[1:00:59] raptured out of Leota for the entire
[1:01:00] body to be caught up to meet the Lord in
[1:01:02] the air that's our conviction that's our
[1:01:05] belief so we're in another age and so
[1:01:08] the promise of our age is not a
[1:01:10] grave we're not we're not saddled with
[1:01:13] this anointing of an ox that's going to
[1:01:16] drive us to a grave but the prevailing
[1:01:18] promise I may have mentioned this a
[1:01:19] couple service ago the prevailing
[1:01:21] prophecy and the overarching theme of
[1:01:23] this message is life
[1:01:26] the very theme of this message is is
[1:01:29] provision
[1:01:31] protection if we were Anointed with the
[1:01:33] ox anointing and that was the spirit
[1:01:35] upon our age then it would be
[1:01:37] responsible for me to tell you you were
[1:01:39] made to die for this you were made to
[1:01:42] lay down your life you were made and
[1:01:44] that would be the
[1:01:45] emphasis that's that that is exactly how
[1:01:47] I would challenge you say look this is
[1:01:49] what we're coming to this is what's
[1:01:50] prophesied can't you see it's being
[1:01:52] accomplished this is what we're called
[1:01:53] to but we have not heard a voice that
[1:01:55] said remain in her until death but we've
[1:01:58] heard a voice that says come out of
[1:02:01] her brother bham said and there is a man
[1:02:04] here who could turn on the light that
[1:02:05] very morning before he preached Look
[1:02:07] Away to Jesus he says when the
[1:02:08] persecution comes don't get scared when
[1:02:11] the spiritual persecution comes when
[1:02:13] that last plague of spiritual death
[1:02:14] begins to knock on your door and try to
[1:02:16] get you to back down from the open of
[1:02:18] the word try to get you to back down
[1:02:19] from a real genuine faith in the promise
[1:02:21] of this hour don't get scared when the
[1:02:24] persecution comes he said don't get
[1:02:26] scared there is a
[1:02:28] light he said he would catch his people
[1:02:32] away before it ever turns into the
[1:02:34] physical persecution of the Pale
[1:02:36] Horse there's a man here who's going to
[1:02:39] take his bride away why he he'll turn
[1:02:42] he'll do everything he can brother Bram
[1:02:44] said if there's anything that'll keep
[1:02:45] him from turning her hand he's going to
[1:02:48] keep her from
[1:02:49] it because his grace is so great upon
[1:02:52] her now
[1:02:57] I I'm starting with this this worst case
[1:03:00] scenario
[1:03:03] death believing that if we could look at
[1:03:06] death and say you have no power over me
[1:03:09] that anything that would
[1:03:10] follow also doesn't have power over
[1:03:13] you what's the what is what is the
[1:03:16] greatest fear with
[1:03:20] covid-19 besides all the weight I've
[1:03:22] gained I caught a revelation of what the
[1:03:24] 19 was in covid-19
[1:03:26] it's at least 19
[1:03:29] pounds but the fear of it is
[1:03:31] death if it really was everyone can get
[1:03:34] it and they'll just be fine in the end
[1:03:35] then nobody would be scared the polit
[1:03:38] politicians wouldn't be scared the
[1:03:39] doctors the scientists everyone there
[1:03:41] would be no there would be no fear there
[1:03:43] would be no pandemic so to speak in the
[1:03:44] sense of panic it' be like well this is
[1:03:47] just this is just like allergies or just
[1:03:49] like sneezing it's just something that
[1:03:51] happens it's going to come and go but
[1:03:53] this is it can be so deadly right and so
[1:03:57] harmful to certain segments of the
[1:03:58] population that's the real re uh the
[1:04:01] real fear and then when you're told
[1:04:03] there's a marathon runner 45 years old I
[1:04:05] read it as a lawyer I I have different
[1:04:08] uh you know I'm not trying to drop that
[1:04:09] I'm a lawyer every time it just happens
[1:04:11] I'm going to try not to ever say that
[1:04:12] again as a lawyer I
[1:04:17] promise with my hands in my own
[1:04:20] pocket the I I received a bulletin that
[1:04:24] said that a a lawyer 45 5 years old
[1:04:26] healthy ran marathons never sick a day
[1:04:28] in his life succumbed to it and died now
[1:04:31] what does that do it creates the fear
[1:04:33] I'm a 45 year old I've been sick though
[1:04:36] is that what makes me different I've
[1:04:37] been sick so I won't die because I've
[1:04:39] been sick before and it creates a fear
[1:04:41] what it's the death that makes it
[1:04:44] fearful it it's the what's going to
[1:04:46] happen to my family and what's what is
[1:04:48] it's that Spectre it's that cloud so if
[1:04:50] you can get rid of the fear of death
[1:04:52] then you're not going to fear anything
[1:04:54] that Bluffs you with death right they
[1:04:56] said I could kill you like anything
[1:04:58] worse than that can you separate my soul
[1:05:00] from
[1:05:01] Christ can you can you leave my body in
[1:05:05] the grave but then also cast my soul to
[1:05:07] hell if you can't then I'm not afraid of
[1:05:09] you there's only one I fear and that's
[1:05:11] God and brother Bram said in the god
[1:05:13] making his promise and that's the
[1:05:14] greatest th thing that put fear over man
[1:05:17] was
[1:05:18] death so the thing that put the greatest
[1:05:21] fear over man is death he said the
[1:05:22] greatest enemy that man ever had was
[1:05:24] death to all men he called it the
[1:05:26] greatest dread and the greatest fear so
[1:05:29] what's man's greatest fear death what's
[1:05:31] man's greatest dread death what's the
[1:05:33] greatest enemy death the greatest thing
[1:05:35] that put fear over man was
[1:05:37] death so if you can be uh uh Fearless
[1:05:41] against the
[1:05:43] worst if we could take in in in what
[1:05:46] we're emphasizing now to you is that
[1:05:48] whatever lays ahead you should not fear
[1:05:51] even death because he's made a promise
[1:05:54] then that can give you certainty that if
[1:05:56] he's promised that I won't die then that
[1:05:58] means I'm going to have to eat
[1:06:00] eventually right or not have to eat
[1:06:03] anymore but still live because he's
[1:06:07] hasn't I'm not afraid of death this is
[1:06:09] his promise he's made to me and in the
[1:06:11] message Paradox brother Bram has that
[1:06:14] vision and I call it the Black Mamba
[1:06:16] vision and what is it he says about it
[1:06:18] if you're bit by it it's certain
[1:06:21] death and he said everyone was afraid of
[1:06:24] it and he said he saw it going after his
[1:06:27] brothers and they're just dancing away
[1:06:28] from everyone was scared to death of
[1:06:30] this black mama and it's represented
[1:06:32] death but he said he was 2third of the
[1:06:34] way right so we're coming to that third
[1:06:37] pull and when you come to the third
[1:06:40] pull it's this vision of this black mama
[1:06:42] this Black Mama's there in this third
[1:06:44] part that's where it comes in he says
[1:06:47] everyone's scared to death but as this
[1:06:50] Vision comes forward as it as a vision
[1:06:52] unfolds he finds that he's got power to
[1:06:55] B it everyone's scared to death what he
[1:06:58] do he bound it and he turned to that and
[1:07:00] sign he said and then he loosed it and
[1:07:02] this is what the voice says and the
[1:07:03] voice came from above me and said you've
[1:07:05] been given power to bind him the worst
[1:07:09] or
[1:07:11] any so in this third poll when we come
[1:07:14] to
[1:07:15] this this is the time under this word of
[1:07:18] God you're given power to bind
[1:07:21] death the worst and therefore since it's
[1:07:25] the worst you have power to bind
[1:07:28] any and these are the things that are
[1:07:30] made manifest in the temporary
[1:07:31] manifestations of the third pole you see
[1:07:33] that every phase of life there's power
[1:07:36] over
[1:07:38] it that there's a certain character
[1:07:40] there's a certain activity there's a
[1:07:41] certain uh confidence there's a certain
[1:07:43] provision and it's not so that we would
[1:07:45] be waiting for everything to line up
[1:07:47] like brother brandham would in a vision
[1:07:48] but to recognize we're walking now in a
[1:07:50] time in a season in a promise where we
[1:07:52] have provision in the word of God for
[1:07:54] everything
[1:07:56] and that we've been given power to bind
[1:07:57] death this vision of the Black Mamba
[1:07:59] two-thirds of the way to Jordan was
[1:08:01] something that was given to brother
[1:08:02] Brown to show that the power of this
[1:08:04] revealed word that was coming into the
[1:08:06] church that would be revealed in the
[1:08:08] church gives her power over the worst
[1:08:10] and therefore having power of the
[1:08:11] greatest she has power over the
[1:08:14] least we have power over it and if I
[1:08:17] could say it this way at the very least
[1:08:19] Saints it has no power over
[1:08:21] you where is its
[1:08:23] sting where is its Victory it has none
[1:08:27] so brother badam says as he says you've
[1:08:29] been given power to bind him the worst
[1:08:30] or any now let's just all admit it all
[1:08:32] of us would have said I didn't know that
[1:08:34] thanks and we would have walked away but
[1:08:36] brother BR says well God what must I
[1:08:39] do think about that the kind of humility
[1:08:43] to say then if I've given been given
[1:08:45] power then I have some responsibility
[1:08:48] then and he says what must I do and he
[1:08:50] said there's one thing you must do you
[1:08:52] must be more sincere
[1:08:55] this speaks to
[1:08:57] discernment you must be more sincere how
[1:09:00] are you going to bind death if you don't
[1:09:02] recognize it these are my words now this
[1:09:04] is me just impressing this upon your
[1:09:06] heart how are you going to bind
[1:09:07] something if you don't recognize it you
[1:09:09] just pet them
[1:09:11] python you just pet the Black
[1:09:14] Mamba because you don't have the
[1:09:16] discernment to recognize it that's why
[1:09:18] we need an Awakening to spiritual
[1:09:19] discernment he said there's one thing
[1:09:20] you must do be more sincere I want to be
[1:09:22] more
[1:09:23] sincere in the message Christian versus
[1:09:25] idolatry says the denominational church
[1:09:27] will just move right on into denom into
[1:09:31] domination and go on the way it goes
[1:09:33] he's talking about a battle conflict is
[1:09:34] coming he says the denominational church
[1:09:36] is going to move into domination or even
[1:09:38] denominations they're going to join the
[1:09:39] World Council churches it's just going
[1:09:41] to go on it's going to be forced into
[1:09:42] it's going to be driven into it he says
[1:09:43] but the real I mean the real True
[1:09:45] Believer is coming to that Battlefield
[1:09:48] what Battlefield is it you better be ver
[1:09:50] Versed and know what you're doing or you
[1:09:52] could take an evil spirit so easy and
[1:09:54] not know it
[1:09:55] if it's contrary to this word don't
[1:09:57] believe it stay with that word what word
[1:10:00] the message of the
[1:10:03] hour listen I think times people talk
[1:10:06] about reading between the lines and they
[1:10:07] literally mean I'm inventing things in
[1:10:09] the white
[1:10:11] space but to read between the lines is
[1:10:13] to catch the Revelation in the black
[1:10:15] what's being said I'm catching the
[1:10:18] revelation of what's being said reading
[1:10:19] between the lines isn't utilizing the
[1:10:21] white space between it to put your own
[1:10:23] interpretation and I believe this
[1:10:24] message is is complete it's perfect it's
[1:10:27] delivered to us the revelation of Jesus
[1:10:29] Christ to introduce us to our mate and
[1:10:31] it's enough to get us out of here if
[1:10:33] you'll just be more sincere with it and
[1:10:35] stay with it and not let all the
[1:10:37] fanaticism and all the other movements
[1:10:38] and all the other ideas and all the
[1:10:40] politics and any kind of persecution
[1:10:42] move us from that
[1:10:43] word listen there's never been a greater
[1:10:46] time to preach this message than right
[1:10:48] now why because I look out upon people
[1:10:50] who are battle scarred you're veterans
[1:10:52] there's been moves come through and push
[1:10:54] you moves come through and try you and
[1:10:56] especially with I see the young fam
[1:10:58] staying true to this message you've
[1:10:59] endured separation you've endured
[1:11:01] conflict you've endured H H uh just the
[1:11:03] the Venom and the animosity and the
[1:11:05] vitual and the hatred to try to convince
[1:11:07] you to walk away from this but you're
[1:11:08] still sitting here today you're still
[1:11:11] standing in Jesus Christ and there's
[1:11:12] never been a greater people to preach to
[1:11:14] than you right now never been a greater
[1:11:17] privilege people are hungry for the word
[1:11:20] of God not to be beat over the head with
[1:11:21] it you bunch of make
[1:11:23] Believers I don't come to church to get
[1:11:26] beat over the head I come come to church
[1:11:27] to have someone who knows how to handle
[1:11:29] a sharp sword and I say I'm going to
[1:11:30] yield myself so you can be a surgeon I'm
[1:11:33] going to yield myself so you can just
[1:11:35] delicately cut away all these things in
[1:11:37] these day of small things refine my
[1:11:39] faith bring me up with the Positive
[1:11:41] gospel not always bruting me beating me
[1:11:43] up like a bully with the club why
[1:11:45] because you're here you deserve the best
[1:11:48] you deserve a positive gospel we deserve
[1:11:52] we need to then stay with the message
[1:11:55] because the real true believers come to
[1:11:57] the battlefield that's where a fight's
[1:11:58] going to take place where this last
[1:12:00] plague is Fallen upon all the Earth and
[1:12:02] people are going into spiritual death
[1:12:04] you're coming to a battlefield and you
[1:12:05] better know what you're doing he says
[1:12:07] you better be well versed better be
[1:12:09] versed he says and know what you're
[1:12:15] doing I recommend that you listen we
[1:12:19] used to use a phrase for all your young
[1:12:20] people we call them
[1:12:22] tapes and that's not more than one of
[1:12:25] Scotch tape in a in a
[1:12:28] drawer I don't think there'd be the
[1:12:30] proper plural of
[1:12:31] that but we say listen to the
[1:12:34] tapes do you realize in that phone you
[1:12:38] have right now in your purse or your
[1:12:39] pocket you can have all
[1:12:42] 1,200 and listen not even on the local
[1:12:45] drive but in the cloud
[1:12:49] glory and you can listen to them
[1:12:51] whenever you
[1:12:52] want I think we ought to be listening to
[1:12:55] them
[1:12:55] amen I think we ought to be feeding on
[1:12:57] it we ought to be versed so that when
[1:12:59] someone sends us a quote and and we read
[1:13:02] it and we're thinking oh my I didn't
[1:13:04] know that you immediately say oh but
[1:13:06] keep reading you know what he says next
[1:13:08] that's the real meat of that that's the
[1:13:10] real perspective to that like oh yeah he
[1:13:12] did say that he did say that he didn't
[1:13:15] know about the third pool yeah I
[1:13:16] remember souls in prison now he did yeah
[1:13:17] that's right he was a lot of questions
[1:13:19] that's true but Have you listened to
[1:13:20] look away to
[1:13:21] Jesus you're well versed you know it you
[1:13:25] know what he said not just what
[1:13:27] somebody's saying about
[1:13:28] it but you know also what he
[1:13:34] said in the message how can I
[1:13:37] overcome I put my watch up here so I
[1:13:39] would watch
[1:13:40] it but I've looked away to
[1:13:44] Jesus all right this is long all right
[1:13:47] here we go let's go fast in the message
[1:13:50] how can I overcome I want you to see
[1:13:52] where this fear of death
[1:13:55] it's gone but the razor focus on what
[1:13:57] kind of persecution this is is going to
[1:13:59] be Amplified because there is a
[1:14:01] persecution that comes upon the
[1:14:04] bride and it's so
[1:14:07] close in the message how can I overcome
[1:14:09] he says we see this age that we're
[1:14:10] living in it's one of the grandest ages
[1:14:13] of all ages this leot Dean Church age is
[1:14:15] the grandest of all Church ages because
[1:14:17] it's the ending of time and the blending
[1:14:18] of Eternity and it is the greatest
[1:14:21] sinful age it's more sin in this age
[1:14:24] than there's ever been and the powers of
[1:14:27] Satan are many times harder to fight
[1:14:29] against than it was in any
[1:14:31] age back now listen because he says see
[1:14:33] here back there in the early ages a
[1:14:36] Christian could for his profession of in
[1:14:39] a church of belonging to Christ could be
[1:14:41] beheaded for it he could be killed and
[1:14:43] put out of his misery and go to meet God
[1:14:46] quickly he's phrasing it in a way that
[1:14:49] there was a time that if you believed
[1:14:51] God you went to meet him very quickly
[1:14:54] you put out of your misery it it was
[1:14:56] such a challenge of faith it was so uh
[1:15:00] Stark of a contrast where you you
[1:15:02] believed in Christ then you were
[1:15:03] crucified you were killed you were
[1:15:05] murdered so where was the test in that
[1:15:07] do you believe Jesus Christ yep off with
[1:15:10] your head it wasn't well now Jesus was
[1:15:15] actually it was different so he says
[1:15:19] this but now the enemy has come in in
[1:15:22] the name of the church and it's so
[1:15:25] deceiving this is the great age of
[1:15:27] deception so he's actually contrasting
[1:15:30] physical persecution unto death behind
[1:15:33] between the real temptation of this hour
[1:15:36] which is a deceitful deception the enemy
[1:15:39] comes in in the name of the church so
[1:15:41] deceiving in this great age of deception
[1:15:43] this great sinful age where the power of
[1:15:45] Satan are many more times harder to
[1:15:48] fight against not because it's death
[1:15:51] which would seem to be the worst thing
[1:15:52] to overcome but now it's so subtle it's
[1:15:55] spiritual
[1:15:57] death so he's he's he's he's brought
[1:16:00] this dichotomy the early church faced
[1:16:02] physical death by the spirit of this
[1:16:04] Antichrist but now in the end time it's
[1:16:07] worse he worse the subtlety of
[1:16:12] it because if you're spiritually dead
[1:16:14] what are you going to do die it's only
[1:16:16] those that are spiritually alive all
[1:16:18] those with eternal life go in the
[1:16:20] Rapture or the resurrection simultaneous
[1:16:23] Resurrection right
[1:16:25] I didn't get a lot of amens on
[1:16:27] that if you believe that you can say
[1:16:30] Amen to that if you don't I don't want
[1:16:31] you to say Amen but it might be a little
[1:16:34] bit of a litmus test what part five will
[1:16:36] be if you have eternal life you're
[1:16:38] coming up you're going in the Rapture so
[1:16:41] it's those who are spiritually dead that
[1:16:43] are going to
[1:16:44] die and so there's this brother Ram
[1:16:47] showing then that this great
[1:16:48] deceptionist last age is worse because
[1:16:52] it's not in your face do you believe the
[1:16:55] message or you're going to
[1:16:58] die so in Satan's Eden he says this let
[1:17:01] us look now to this great sinful day
[1:17:04] that we're now living in I don't believe
[1:17:06] there ever was a day that I've ever read
[1:17:07] in history there's been greater days of
[1:17:10] persecution with the children of God was
[1:17:12] put to death on every hand but to see
[1:17:15] the deceitfulness of the enemy we've
[1:17:18] never had a day like this we're living
[1:17:20] now now living it's the most cunning
[1:17:22] deceitful day and this is how this
[1:17:25] Spirit comes in flatteries this
[1:17:27] cunningness and when I see that it
[1:17:29] brings this that the Christian has to be
[1:17:31] more on his toe today than he ever was
[1:17:34] in any age you got to get on your
[1:17:37] toe more now than any other age in the
[1:17:40] days of marom maybe you could be flat
[1:17:43] footed right because it was so the the
[1:17:47] the the distinction was in such a way to
[1:17:49] so such a
[1:17:50] contrast denounce Christ deny CH Christ
[1:17:54] deny him just let you know walk away
[1:17:56] from this I'm giving you an opportunity
[1:17:58] right now to deny him and If you deny
[1:17:59] him I'll let you keep your life it's
[1:18:01] like no I can't do it it's too late the
[1:18:03] Revelation is already too clear and if
[1:18:06] somebody would take a gun to your head
[1:18:07] and put a gun to your head and say do
[1:18:08] you believe this do you believe that you
[1:18:10] could just say well yes I do and if
[1:18:11] that's the price I've got to pay then I
[1:18:12] got to pay but now it's a lot more
[1:18:14] subtle now there's political pressure
[1:18:17] that if you don't believe exactly the
[1:18:19] same way they can cut you out of
[1:18:21] Fellowship that that you you you're not
[1:18:24] invited you're not part there's a way
[1:18:25] that you feel ostracized and alienated
[1:18:27] because you don't believe a certain way
[1:18:29] and then there's political pressure put
[1:18:30] on because people can use the pulpit as
[1:18:31] a bully
[1:18:33] pulpit and sermons are preached and
[1:18:35] things are said and things are done and
[1:18:37] attacks are launched and phrased are
[1:18:39] used and it it takes a takes place in a
[1:18:41] totally different realm now where
[1:18:43] there's
[1:18:44] pressure to relent there's pressure to
[1:18:47] let go so you have to be more on your
[1:18:49] toe today now back in the days of
[1:18:53] persecution of Rome to the church the
[1:18:54] Christian make a mistake he went into
[1:18:56] the arena and was fed to Lions or
[1:18:57] something like that when they found him
[1:18:59] being a Christian for his testimony but
[1:19:00] his soul was saved because he's purely
[1:19:02] unadulterated believer in God and gladly
[1:19:04] sealed his testimony with his blood as
[1:19:06] the veins let loose or holes in his body
[1:19:08] and the blood bled out he would scream
[1:19:09] with real loyal Faith say receive my
[1:19:12] spirit Lord Jesus he's just described
[1:19:15] that anointing of an ox this anointed
[1:19:17] that could come upon a Believer now
[1:19:18] brother brandham actually says a number
[1:19:20] of places that the bride would be
[1:19:21] willing to give her life for this
[1:19:24] absolutely absolutely she would
[1:19:26] be but he says but
[1:19:30] now because that's not what you have to
[1:19:32] face if fact could put it this way
[1:19:34] martyrdom would be too
[1:19:36] easy isn't that what he says earlier I
[1:19:38] mean he could just be killed and go meet
[1:19:39] God quickly and his misery be over but
[1:19:41] he says but now the cunningness of the
[1:19:43] devil now makes the people believe that
[1:19:45] they are Christians when they're not
[1:19:48] there's the thing it's a more cunning
[1:19:50] day than when you had to seal your life
[1:19:53] away with your your
[1:19:56] testimony it's more cunning now than it
[1:19:59] was when you had to seal your life away
[1:20:00] with your testimony the devil has set
[1:20:02] every cunning trap he can he's a
[1:20:07] deceiver so this is the pressure we
[1:20:10] face not a pressure that's going to
[1:20:12] culminate in a sacrifice of our physical
[1:20:14] lives not a pressure that we Face where
[1:20:16] we have to we're going to have to lay
[1:20:18] down our lives or at least be faced with
[1:20:20] that where all of a sudden Mass men come
[1:20:22] in with AK-47s before they're outlaw and
[1:20:25] they tell us you better believe this
[1:20:26] message or you're going to die and we
[1:20:28] all say we believe it and they go to
[1:20:29] shoot us and their guns jam up and they
[1:20:31] panic and they flee and they say they
[1:20:33] saw angels surrounding us we're not all
[1:20:35] prophesied to have to go through
[1:20:37] that that's not what we're waiting for
[1:20:39] the cattle cars to round us up and take
[1:20:41] us to Alaska that's not what we're
[1:20:44] facing the squeeze and the
[1:20:48] persecution is going to bring pressure
[1:20:49] from close so
[1:20:52] close the python has got to get close
[1:20:55] enough to choke
[1:20:57] you and so the persecution of the Bride
[1:20:59] is because of her spiritual revelation
[1:21:01] of the word we're taught it's the false
[1:21:04] Vine that persecutes the elect the false
[1:21:07] Vine impersonates the True
[1:21:10] Vine in Galatians 4:
[1:21:15] 28-31 he says now we Brethren as Isaac
[1:21:18] was are the children of promise but as
[1:21:21] then he that was born after the flesh
[1:21:23] persecuted him that was born after the
[1:21:25] spirit so it is now so the carnal
[1:21:29] believer persecutes the real spiritual
[1:21:31] believer this is a principle that he
[1:21:33] goes back to the Old Testament he brings
[1:21:35] it here in the Genesis of the church and
[1:21:37] now we can see it even in the end that
[1:21:39] the carnal one that is born carnally
[1:21:42] after the flesh always persecutes the
[1:21:44] one who's born after the word
[1:21:47] nevertheless what sayith the scripture
[1:21:48] cast out the Bond woman and her son for
[1:21:50] the son of the Bond woman shall not be
[1:21:52] Heir with the son of the free woman so
[1:21:54] then we are not children of the Bond
[1:21:56] woman but of the free the seed is not
[1:21:59] air with the Shu but the Shu it'll
[1:22:03] persecute seed all day long why because
[1:22:06] that it looks so
[1:22:10] close but he says that those that are
[1:22:12] after The Flesh will persecute this is
[1:22:14] the pattern those that are close the
[1:22:16] Bond woman those of the Bond woman those
[1:22:18] who were after the flesh birthed even in
[1:22:20] the Revival as a twin but after the
[1:22:23] flesh persecute the word
[1:22:26] born and it's the twin of this message
[1:22:28] and this may be a mouthful and I'm just
[1:22:30] going to move on from it the twin of
[1:22:32] this message persecutes the bride
[1:22:34] because of her
[1:22:36] Revelation that's the truth it's because
[1:22:39] of her Revelation that the twin of this
[1:22:42] message persecutes her because that's
[1:22:44] what happened in the
[1:22:45] beginning the first set of twins Abel
[1:22:48] was persecuted by Cain because of his
[1:22:52] Revelation it was when God had respect
[1:22:55] unto Abel's
[1:23:00] sacrifice it was when he knew that she
[1:23:03] that he had Revelation that he was wroth
[1:23:06] and the same spirit is identified with
[1:23:08] that twin today where the Revelation is
[1:23:12] he hates
[1:23:14] it so now we have to be thinking in more
[1:23:17] specific terms about what persecution
[1:23:18] would be other than this General
[1:23:21] persecution of do you are you a
[1:23:24] Christian
[1:23:26] listen some of the people that we vilify
[1:23:28] and and again I'm talking about the
[1:23:29] elephant and donkey in the room the
[1:23:31] politics the election some of the
[1:23:33] Democrats that we vilify the most are
[1:23:35] better Christians than the Republicans
[1:23:37] that we uh admire the most when it comes
[1:23:41] to Christian being decent actually going
[1:23:43] to church and doing things that you
[1:23:44] would normally do as a Christian that we
[1:23:46] would the the Democrats and even some of
[1:23:48] the more social Democrats that you would
[1:23:50] say Well they're the they're just
[1:23:51] socialist whatever they're they're they
[1:23:53] are they are faithful to to their
[1:23:54] religious faith of
[1:23:56] Christianity they're they're strong
[1:23:58] adherence to it they they believe in it
[1:24:01] they they they they they they attend
[1:24:03] church and they they have their churches
[1:24:04] that they go to they support them and
[1:24:06] the the pressure the persecution of the
[1:24:08] politics of it that's going to really
[1:24:10] come and nail us down is it going to be
[1:24:12] in a political realm it's a political
[1:24:14] spiritual
[1:24:18] realm watch the third pull because the
[1:24:22] persecution of the squeeze is an attempt
[1:24:23] to keep you from it notice the language
[1:24:26] brother brand uses he says don't you let
[1:24:28] somebody squeeze something into you
[1:24:30] that's not thus sayeth the Lord what's
[1:24:33] the squeeze trying to do squeeze
[1:24:34] something into you that's not thus
[1:24:35] sayith the
[1:24:36] Lord when that squeeze comes to squeeze
[1:24:39] something into you that's someone's
[1:24:41] opinion private interpretation don't let
[1:24:44] them do it don't let them squeeze
[1:24:45] something into you that's not thus
[1:24:46] sayith the Lord in the message in time
[1:24:49] evangelism this brings us around to the
[1:24:52] uh our text in the beginning Peter had a
[1:24:54] sword he pulled that sword and was going
[1:24:56] to cut the high priest ear off and
[1:24:57] things like that he did it but when it
[1:24:59] come to real Christian Courage he didn't
[1:25:02] have it he backed up and denied him is
[1:25:04] that right he could cut the high priest
[1:25:06] ear off with his sword sure he knowed
[1:25:09] how to handle it but when it come to the
[1:25:11] squeeze and the time to stand on the
[1:25:14] word of God he didn't have the courage
[1:25:17] and even denied he knew
[1:25:19] Jesus that's where it is today
[1:25:25] not in a Physical
[1:25:26] Realm we've got to be willing to draw a
[1:25:29] sword if you reading that passage it's
[1:25:31] really interesting uh they they they
[1:25:34] they say we have two swords you know
[1:25:35] they tell Jesus we have two swords is
[1:25:36] that enough he goes it's
[1:25:38] sufficient it's really interesting he
[1:25:40] told him I told you before you know not
[1:25:41] to take anything but this time take a
[1:25:43] sword take a script take these things
[1:25:44] with you but this sword that we wield is
[1:25:47] not a physical sword it's this the king
[1:25:51] sword and he says that's where it is
[1:25:53] today the squeeze and a time to stand on
[1:25:56] the word of God do you have courage to
[1:25:58] stand on the word of God we got courage
[1:26:01] to build buildings and put millions of
[1:26:02] dollars in them we got courage to put
[1:26:04] pipe organs and plush seats and
[1:26:06] everything and go out and proelite from
[1:26:07] place to place and make the methodists
[1:26:09] come Baptist and so forth and back and
[1:26:11] forth like that but when it comes to
[1:26:12] Christian Courage to accept the word and
[1:26:15] the message of God and stand there on it
[1:26:17] we are
[1:26:19] few there's where the squeeze
[1:26:22] is do you have the courage courage to
[1:26:24] stand on the message of God the courage
[1:26:27] to stand on thus sayith the Lord when
[1:26:30] the squeeze came it was pressure to
[1:26:33] squeeze into you something that's not
[1:26:35] this thus sayith the Lord squeeze came
[1:26:37] to get you to renounce to to let loose
[1:26:39] of your
[1:26:46] faith all right I've run out of time
[1:26:48] again so we're going to skip
[1:26:58] there is no
[1:27:02] promise of no
[1:27:04] suffering or there's there's not a
[1:27:07] promise of no
[1:27:09] suffering we're going to suffer there's
[1:27:12] hardships there's difficulties there's
[1:27:14] persecution there's Affliction there's
[1:27:15] things that we may go through but you're
[1:27:17] made for
[1:27:19] this what's going to be the source of
[1:27:21] our courage in a time like this the word
[1:27:23] of God
[1:27:26] what are we looking to the word what are
[1:27:28] we looking away from all all the towers
[1:27:31] that are being
[1:27:32] built on the other side of the
[1:27:35] Jordan you've entered into your Promised
[1:27:38] Land your job is to place every devil
[1:27:40] under your feet your job is footsteps as
[1:27:43] possession let them build what they want
[1:27:45] on the wrong side of Jordan let them
[1:27:47] erect their altar so high you could see
[1:27:49] them let them build out things so great
[1:27:51] so tremendous let them uh try to
[1:27:52] intimidate bully you all they want stay
[1:27:54] focused on the task at
[1:28:00] hand I was going to share some things
[1:28:02] with
[1:28:03] you we just we'll save it for another
[1:28:06] time but brother said there should
[1:28:07] nothing bother us nothing worry us we
[1:28:11] are
[1:28:12] his there should nothing bother us
[1:28:15] nothing worry us we are his but notice
[1:28:19] what he says here in the church age book
[1:28:20] chapter two they were safe in his care
[1:28:24] for nothing could pluck them out of his
[1:28:26] hand and neither could anything separate
[1:28:28] them from the love of God let it be
[1:28:30] sickness Peril nakedness famine sword
[1:28:32] life or death they were truly yielded to
[1:28:34] him and kept by his omnipotence they
[1:28:38] were not concerned about the persecution
[1:28:41] that came their
[1:28:43] way pain and derision was not was but
[1:28:46] caused to give glory to God that they
[1:28:48] were counted worthy to suffer for him
[1:28:51] this ought to be our attitude and were
[1:28:54] so focused on his care so focused on his
[1:28:58] word so yielded to him and kept by his
[1:29:00] all his power that we're not concerned
[1:29:03] about the persecution that came our
[1:29:05] comes our way we're not concerned about
[1:29:07] what the future may hold regardless of
[1:29:08] the coming persecution regardless of the
[1:29:10] test there's no reason to fear I'm
[1:29:12] actually going to be so focused to him
[1:29:13] on him so yielded to him that I'm not
[1:29:16] going to be paying attention to it am I
[1:29:19] could come out on the other side and be
[1:29:20] like oh that's what that was I didn't
[1:29:22] realize that I passed a test didn't even
[1:29:24] know I was taking it why you're so
[1:29:27] focused on the path that he has for
[1:29:29] you and the end time pressure cannot
[1:29:32] defeat you Peter even says the trial of
[1:29:35] your faith is more precious than gold
[1:29:37] your individual faith will be
[1:29:40] tried but the trying of it is the
[1:29:42] purging of it the trying of it is the
[1:29:45] purifying of
[1:29:47] it this the end time pressure the end
[1:29:50] time conditions the persecution whatever
[1:29:52] it may be even as I'm emphasizing how
[1:29:54] brother B talked about this python would
[1:29:56] come and this this subtle spirit and
[1:29:58] this persecution would come up as a twin
[1:30:00] within even the message and it would try
[1:30:02] to choke out the life in you and it
[1:30:04] would persecute you and try to alienate
[1:30:06] you and separate you you don't have to
[1:30:08] fear the worst or
[1:30:10] any because you're made for this end
[1:30:12] time pressure it can't defeat you it can
[1:30:15] only perfect
[1:30:17] you because Eagles are built for it
[1:30:20] you've been anointed as a flying eagle
[1:30:25] I've been pondering this over the last
[1:30:26] couple weeks about a
[1:30:28] diamond it's the only gem that's made up
[1:30:31] of a single element
[1:30:35] carbon and it takes very very specific
[1:30:39] conditions for
[1:30:42] carbon which you know it's abundant in
[1:30:45] Coal
[1:30:47] right not very valuable seemingly trying
[1:30:51] to get away from it now right clean
[1:30:53] energy
[1:30:55] but it's certain conditions within a
[1:30:57] very specific depth
[1:31:00] range that's
[1:31:02] required to that forces the carbon to
[1:31:06] crystallize into a
[1:31:09] diamond has to be
[1:31:11] carbon it has to be at a specific depth
[1:31:14] in the
[1:31:15] earth and at that place there's certain
[1:31:18] temperatures and certain pressure that
[1:31:21] comes to bear on carbon
[1:31:24] and it forces it to
[1:31:27] crystallize forces it to become a
[1:31:30] diamond it's high pressure high
[1:31:32] temperature over 800,000 pounds per
[1:31:35] square inch of pressure and over 2,000
[1:31:38] degrees
[1:31:39] Fahrenheit someone has to know where to
[1:31:41] place that carbon at the right place in
[1:31:44] the
[1:31:45] earth and exert the right pressure and
[1:31:47] right temperature to force it to
[1:31:49] crystallize into a diamond and listen
[1:31:52] your diamonds
[1:31:55] I could use a cucumber analogy you're
[1:31:59] pickles you're not just carbon you've
[1:32:01] been forced forced to crystallize into a
[1:32:04] diamond there's nothing that can defeat
[1:32:07] you there's nothing that can destroy
[1:32:10] you there's nothing that you should be
[1:32:12] worried about you're made for this time
[1:32:14] you're made for this
[1:32:16] season and now I I like to end with this
[1:32:19] statement the musicians if they would
[1:32:21] come
[1:32:24] Church age book chapter 4 be Faith be
[1:32:27] thou faithful unto death he does not say
[1:32:30] be faithful until death but unto death
[1:32:33] you may have to seal your testimony with
[1:32:35] your blood thousands J Millions have
[1:32:37] died during all the ages they died in
[1:32:39] the faith like Antipas the faithful
[1:32:42] martyr they held not their lives dear
[1:32:44] unto
[1:32:45] death I want you to catch this often we
[1:32:48] think that it would be almost impossible
[1:32:50] to be a martyr
[1:32:54] but dare to recall that the faith we
[1:32:56] daily use to Triumph in Christ Jesus is
[1:32:59] the same faith that upholds the polycarp
[1:33:01] and all Martyrs and then I love this
[1:33:04] statement the Supreme faith will give
[1:33:06] Supreme Grace for the Supreme hour he
[1:33:10] says blessed be God
[1:33:12] forever the Supreme faith will give
[1:33:15] Supreme Grace for the Supreme hour
[1:33:18] whatever's to come his Supreme Grace is
[1:33:23] is going to be evident with us because
[1:33:25] he's given us the Supreme faith for the
[1:33:27] Supreme
[1:33:28] hour whatever's coming whatever we're
[1:33:30] facing whatever's uncertain I don't know
[1:33:32] what's happened in the news since
[1:33:34] yesterday we don't know what might
[1:33:36] happened and with politicians and
[1:33:38] governments and there's always a threat
[1:33:40] that states could succeed secede from a
[1:33:42] union and there's all sorts of well this
[1:33:44] could happen and that could happen and
[1:33:46] martial law and they could stack the
[1:33:47] Supreme Court we're not worried about
[1:33:50] it I'm not worried about the Avenues
[1:33:52] through which the persecution can come I
[1:33:55] acknowledge that persecution can come I
[1:33:57] acknowledge that all that live Godly in
[1:33:59] Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution I
[1:34:01] acknowledge that many are the
[1:34:02] afflictions of the righteous I
[1:34:03] acknowledge that brother bandam said
[1:34:05] things that could cause fear to the
[1:34:06] carnal believer about church doors being
[1:34:08] closed and being chased and hunted and
[1:34:10] persecuted but I'm going to look away to
[1:34:13] Jesus and I'm going to stand here
[1:34:15] solidly believing that the Supreme faith
[1:34:17] will give Supreme Grace for the Supreme
[1:34:20] hour and that this faith I have is is
[1:34:23] equal to it's just like the same faith
[1:34:26] that polycarp had the same faith that
[1:34:28] antios had the same faith that led to
[1:34:30] the place to where they can lay down
[1:34:32] their lives is the same faith I'm
[1:34:33] carrying
[1:34:35] today so I need not worry about pressure
[1:34:37] that may come politically socially
[1:34:40] economically but I promise to look out
[1:34:42] after you pray for you we do this as
[1:34:44] Believers as members of this body of
[1:34:46] Christ we we look to one another and I
[1:34:48] say I'll be praying for you in your
[1:34:50] difficulty I'll be uplifting you in
[1:34:52] prayer if you need a job let's pray to
[1:34:53] together let's see the channels that I
[1:34:55] might have if you need food come join
[1:34:57] with mine if you need toilet paper I've
[1:34:59] stockpiled back in March we'll take care
[1:35:01] of each
[1:35:02] other we're not afraid of what's to come
[1:35:06] we won't fear what man can do to us we
[1:35:08] won't fear what pandemics can do we
[1:35:10] won't fear plagues coming upon the Earth
[1:35:11] we won't fear
[1:35:15] Politics the Supreme faith will give
[1:35:19] Supreme Grace for the Supreme
[1:35:22] hour but you know what won't Supreme
[1:35:29] speculation if I told you right now it's
[1:35:31] coming Saints you better get ready for
[1:35:33] it shortly after the inauguration every
[1:35:35] message church will be closed tax laws
[1:35:38] will be changed they'll shut us down
[1:35:39] before we get out of 2021 I'm telling
[1:35:41] you right now you might as well get
[1:35:42] ready for it we're all going to be
[1:35:44] without churches we're going to be
[1:35:45] meeting in our homes and if I told you
[1:35:47] that as
[1:35:49] speculation just presuming certainly
[1:35:52] speaking outside of what brother
[1:35:54] brandham
[1:35:55] said if that's not thus sayeth the Lord
[1:35:58] it will only produce fear and carnal
[1:36:02] preparation for something that's never
[1:36:03] coming we mentioned before baptizing
[1:36:05] into 1977 how many are still eating from
[1:36:08] the stockpile of
[1:36:10] 2000 right when the clock hits
[1:36:14] midnight and December 31st 1999 the
[1:36:17] whole world economy is going to fall
[1:36:19] apart and you're going to be glad I've
[1:36:20] got all those rice bags in the basement
[1:36:25] because people built up something very
[1:36:31] large we don't need to do that we can
[1:36:34] focus on the word of God Supreme faith
[1:36:38] will give Supreme Grace for the Supreme
[1:36:40] hour let's stand to our feet
[1:36:43] [Music]
