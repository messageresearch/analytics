TRANSCRIPT
========================================
our title today under our family tree is a place called home so we'll just jump right into this do some review for a few moments and then pick up on those concepts of our family tree on family and tree and these concepts that are being combined so as we look at this in verse 33 like if you just to read it again with me and then ponder some of the things that we've covered already if you have if you take notes you might be able to just flip back and kind of parse over some of those things and we'll highlight some portions but abraham planted we know in planting this is something that god did uh it is something it was a tillage of soil even in some translations so it's something that adam was to do so it's the image of god in the image of adam it is a type of christ who said he would build his church and even in this tree that is built it is a type of christ and even the tree is a type of his church and so abraham planted the grove in some places it says abraham planted a tamarisk tree or abraham planted a tree in beersheba and it was there in this grove that he called upon the name of the lord and it uses this phrase it's the first time that it's used in the scripture the everlasting god so it speaks to his eternal quality and a god forever to abraham and when we read in genesis chapter 1 21 we saw where abraham plants this grove after the promised sun came doesn't plant it this instance and this instance of planting this tree comes into existence once the promised family comes into expression son to sarah sun by abraham and so this there was a fulfillment of a vision but also there was this forward-looking part on abraham's in abraham's actions where he had a vision where he's planting a family tree for himself for his wife and for his son and then all those that would come after him any of the ones that would come after isaac there would be this place that they could worship a place where his family would honor god worship the bible says the everlasting god and we identified how in plant in a tree it wasn't selfish not immediately to satisfy the flesh or self-serving unless abraham unless there was nurseries in those days that had the equipment that we do today where you could buy a 55 000 tree and have it transplanted and have a nice mature tree in your front yard wouldn't that be nice if that was within reach right uh elliot and i have had an ongoing debate as to whether or not there's any trees in phoenix i don't know if it is uh one of those conspiracy theories like there is there are no birds or birds aren't real but sometimes you wish for a tree well abraham planted a tree and knew that it would take a long time for this to grow if it was a fruit tree though many don't believe it was it would take years for it to fruit so something that was forward-looking something that had a vision and i was really moved by how the hebrews treat this scripture and the hebrew it's a abraham planted a shell and to a hebrew it was a place of hospitality and this is what they teach and their their synagogues this is what the the rabbis teach this is what their theologians hold in their tradition orally and in written that it was a place of feeding and drinking and supplying where you would give things to the travelers and to guests and to family that would come and they even look at the name michelle and it's actually an acronym for feeding drinking and accompanying and giving possessions and giving service to people and they don't just say that it was a place where he's standing under a tree like this saying jesus jesus jesus and that's how he called upon the name of the lord but rather he invoked the name of the everlasting god by the acts that he performed under the tree and in this grove and this garden that he built this place of worship that he would invite travelers that were passing through and say you look weary you look tired come and soldier in here for a little bit and and dwell with me for the night or come in for the day and he would uh he would minister to them and when he would done it had done it they would have wanted to thank him and they would have said oh you're a wonderful man and and praise be to you and he'd say no these things have not come by my hand but they've come by the everlasting god and and he would be able to witness and to testify of the things that god had done for him i imagine i mean abraham had a testimony he had a testimony unfolding there was think there were stories he could tell i was i was i dwelled in babylon and i left with my family and i traveled here and i traveled there and then to begin to tell a story about and god spoke to me appeared to me in a vision and god told me to do this and god told me to do that and they may all be thinking yeah we've heard of deities we've heard of gods but this is something that was real uh that he could begin to go through his life and tell these testimonies and so it was a place where he could testify it was a place where he could serve and and so the jews hold it as it was a shell was a place where god was manifested by how he served others it was a place where he could point others to god and we looked at the different places in scripture where abraham and even his seed after him returned back to this very place to offer sacrifice um to worship to serve god and it was a place not only where they worship but they found rest it's a place where they were fed as elijah fled to the beersheba left his servant there and went into the wilderness of beersheba and he was fed by god he was strengthened and then god spoke to his children there gave them visions appeared to them ministered to elijah there and so this is a special place and we're using abraham's grove as a type of our family tree that family tree is the one that's kind of maybe lined up next to you in the chairs you're sitting in today and it's also type of this family tree which we're a part of as a church and so we want you to see different layers of application in your life now two concepts merged together i mentioned this just a moment ago how two concepts merged together in the thought of our family tree and so this phrase family tree there's two different concepts that we could amplify one is a relationship and the other one is fellowship and so in that there's connection and there's communion so there's relationship connection there's fellowship and communion those are two different things family embodies the relationship and the connection and then the tree is a place of fellowship or communion now this is a subject that i would like to expand i thought i would maybe expand it a little bit more today but i just want to introduce it a family is a group consisting a group of people consisting of parents and children we kind of be the modern definition a group of people a group of parents and children living together in a household there's different legal rules for household and dependence or living under the same roof or depending on one another but that's what we would how we would define a family today been reading a number of articles and scholarship on what family is and how to define family and it's very interesting anymore how they want like to define a family but it would be parents and children living together together in a house and maybe another definition a group of individuals living under one roof and under one head and this is uh this is how we refer to a family and then there's also a definition of a group of people united by certain convictions and or a common affiliation and so that's another way of looking at a family and i believe that the the believers they they have a connection which is real in the same sense you have parents and children together in one household uh they also fit the definition of those who have a common conviction and they have a certain affiliation that connects them together but it's important to recognize that the true body of christ really transcends anything natural and we're only using natural things to somehow get our minds around what the body of christ is but the body of christ is a family as paul says in ephesians chapter 3 verses 14 to 15 referring to jesus christ in verse 14 of hope of whom the whole family in heaven and in earth is named and so the body of christ is referred to as a family in the in the new testament the word family is patria it's also uh translated to lineage or kindred but this is the way that it describes family and this is perfect i think for for us believers it's lineage running back to the same progenitor the same father the same source the same ancestry and it's all those who in a given people lay claim to a common origin so it also maybe would refer to a race or tribe so if you're in a family if you have a common origin you're in a family if you have a common father you have a common common ancestry and a common progenitor so in the natural this is so that's why israel is such a beautiful type because they are a people that their religion and their conviction their belief was associated with who they were in their flesh like their their actual dna determined that they were israelites they were jews and they had a religion they had a god of their father and so the way that they would relate to one another in the natural is a type of how we are spiritually related to christ in a very real way in a very real way it says in luke chapter 2 verse 4 this kind of captures that thought it's talking about joseph i don't know if i provided this one but it says and joseph also went up from galilee out of the city of nazareth into judea under the city of david which is called bethlehem and it says because he was of the house and lineage of david so he was of the family of david he had descended from david so that's why he went to bethlehem because he was of the house of david or the lineage of david he was in david's family now we know that this in israel would relate to grandparents great grandparents and they would say we're of our father abraham because they descended linearly from him they are the lineage of abraham but i believe it was brother manuel and and i trust that we had that prayer request in to pray for him he's ministering in tucson today uh really enjoyed wednesday night service he mentioned wednesday night that god doesn't have grandchildren and he described a unique way that he had a relationship with god through his mom and so it's it's god does not have that kind of relationship so we are all uh descended from god we are his children and and as it says in galatians chapter 6 verse 10 the household of faith do good especially to them who are of the household of the lineage of the pro of the progeny of god the household of faith and a household means it belongs to a family and we speak of a household there's intimate relationships there's blood connections uh it's called kindred and so when we say family that's what we're looking at we're looking at relationship when we talk about family we're talking about connection that we would look at one another and we do not have connection because we have the same membership in arizona believer's church but we have connection because we are part of the family of god and we have a connection to one another because we have the same father and christ is our head and so that's what the true church is that's who you are a part of then we we have that becomes our model our example and how we'd like to participate and interact with one another in this household because all being children of god we've gathered here so then we ought to conduct ourselves in the house of god how that we would conduct ourselves in the family of god because god's family is a picture of what our family ought to be as heads of our own homes and then also what our church ought to be and i believe that in our and our families at home and wherever you may be and whatever your arrangement might be as far as family we should strive to reflect god's order of the family however god has arranged and how he's placed it it's remarkable and i might find myself veering out a little bit here it's remarkable how much of our duty as christians is expressed in the terms of our relationships to other people and taking your place as a man taking your place as a woman taking your place as children and all the different things that we would do in some way it relates to our position and relationship to other people and so we should strive to find that our place in our lives but then also to reflect christ and god's order in these different relationships so that's the concept of family when i talk about family these are some of the things we're talking about this household of faith the family of god now i want to touch on very quickly the concept of fellowship because we say our family we're a family but then there's a tree and that could be in the sense that we all descend from christ or we're all re we're all related to god so you could see that as a lineage i don't know how that runs like this for a very very long time and there's no grandchildren so it's just those two levels god and then everybody else uh and it's kind of the sparks the interesting theological discussions about what the wedding supper table is going to look like and the seating arrangement that's always fun and fruitless but it is it is fun just to ponder it and think about it and not saying it is but could it be a table so long or so high or a spiral so we all see a big round table right so we're all facing each other you got perfect eyesight right so it's gonna be like they're right there see it could be fun so uh this idea um so that's our we have our family then we as a tree we're looking at this concept of fellowship when we talk about a tree and this is uh i believe fellowship and communion is embodied in the idea at least this is how i'm reading it in the scripture this is how it strikes me the different places that i read about uh um the the symbolism and the type of a tree but the idea and image of a tree is express the idea of connection and fellowship a grove would be a place that you would come to a garden uh would be a place that you would spend time in i still remember very very vividly sister elizabeth can attest to this it's almost as if we could walk through each pace that when we were received into brother harold and sister ernestine beckett's home in cape town uh that they greeted us and they and they showed love to us and then uh sister ernestine took elizabeth into one room and brother beckett took me in another and they washed our feet it was it was remarkable i still to this day can just be moved with the motion and pondered and then having washed our feet and prayed for us they they they got us maybe something to drink and then he walked us out into a garden it was a grove and we sat underneath the greenery and everything and and a beautiful place and i did he have some music playing i think there might i don't know if there's maybe i'm just hearing it maybe my wife was singing to me but he just sat us down he says why don't you two just spend some time together and rest a little bit in this grove or this garden and it went away and he left us there to fellowship and commune with one another and then he came back a little bit later just began to speak to us then he began to prophesy to us tell us what to expect things that were going to happen sure enough it happened exactly like he said it would but it was a wonderful time and it happened there under these trees in this arbor and this grove because that's what is expressed about a garden and trees hold a rich symbolism in the bible the whole symbolism in literature even in humanity there's a lot of ways that trees are expressed in other religions and again this is not just me doing a search on trees and repeating tree trees trees trees trees all over again and then telling you that it's 777 inches to that tree out there and getting us all excited but rather it's just to really look deep into what god is meaning in a particular scripture because abraham's tree the tamarisk tree abraham's grove represented a gathering place for fellowship if you say no brother and that's not what it meant that's not what it was it was just an altar it was just a single tree i'm not going to argue with you we're using it as a type a type of community and hospitality was a place where relationships could be formed maybe someone entered in as a stranger but then they they left a brother they left a friend it was a place where connections could be formed our relationships could be formed there's a place where you can cultivate common conviction and ambition and aspiration that you come together you have a common goal you have common ideals and you could gather under that tree and you can inspire one another you can encourage one another and that's what our tree ought to be as christians we have a common ambition which is christ and we're out there on our own on our own as our own families and out there doing things on our own but then when we gather back here on the sunday mornings and wednesday night we have to realize that this is a wonderful opportunity to communicate to one another and to cultivate common uh ambition and and what we're trying to do and encourage one another i was fellowshipping with brother samuel brother ellie and it was just heartbreaking to think of some of the situations that are taking place in families and in churches and how that seems so often and this wasn't their expression it was mine how so often families seem to be completely on their own in church but completely on their own trying to raise their children and say well it's the family that's got the duty and the responsibility to do it it's their fault that the children backslide and it's their fault if they don't hold the standard in the home and i believe that we could all say amen but it's the church's responsibility to support them in that endeavor and if the parents aren't getting support if they're not being taught wisdom if they're not being shown things and encouraged and things and sometimes even being told hey you know what that's just normal it's just a phase every parent has children that do that there's no reason to be embarrassed or just that kind of encouragement support i'll be praying for you looking out after you that's what that's what we ought to be doing for one another our testimony as a family sister elizabeth and our children is that there have been people in our lives that have uh made a difference people in the body of christ that have made a difference in our life uh and and made it that impacted us and then we're being given an opportunity now to impact the children of those very people that made an impact in our lives and then we see those children that we impacted having an impact on our children and that's the way the family ought to work that's the way the church ought to work and it's those fellowship that communion and it says in verse 34 i just want to compliment everyone on creating such a wonderful atmosphere by the michael tremendous job the musicians just such a a pleasing atmosphere here today to minister the word and i don't know that this would necessarily be a warning maybe this would just be like uh just get everyone really really excited uh since we're not having wednesday service i'm kind of combining combining services today and so i'm not really combining services but i really want to get all most that we can't out of this but verse 34 and abraham so adjourned in the philistines land many days souljarn it's a word actually that i think i never really looked up and researched it but it was just kind of a word that to me meant something and that kind of soldier and to me kind of meant traveling but it actually is kind of the the opposite to soldiering is to take your abode and and he dwelled and inhabited and so there was a there's a it means to continue and actually the word comes from holds the root meaning and it means to seek hospitality with and so when the bible says when he planted a grove and then you realize well maybe the jews weren't off on a limb when they said it was hospitality they're using a very word of hospitality he built a grove and then sought hospitality with the philistines many days in other words it was by the means of this grove he invoked the name of god it was a place of hospitality and when he evolved there he dwelt he inhabited it he continued there and he sought hospitality in this place of the philistines in the land of promise but it was the philistines land the land of the philistines many days so he was not just there temporarily he did not get a hotel hotel room and stream service that night but he put up his tent he built a a grove he had a place of worship and he remained there many days now in hebrews chapter 11 verses 8 to 10 i want to use the several verses in hebrews chapter 11 just to kind of look on the this other side of abraham's vision and desire by faith abraham when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance inheritance in the greek is property received is something that's given as a possession so when you receive something by inheritance you typically receive it from a family member family home or family land just passed down and so he was called to go to a place which he would receive for an inheritance it's a family inheritance it's a place that he would receive as inherited as an inheritance as a gift from one uh in his family so this is what he's seeking is an inherited home an inherited land obeyed and he went out not knowing whether he went by faith he sojourned in the land of promise he remained he abided he sought hospitality in the land of promise as in a strange country dwelling in tabernacles with isaac and jacob the heirs with him of the same promise so now notice he is by faith he dwelled in tabernacles with isaac and jacob by faith he lived in tents with his family soul journey these are kindreds who were heirs of this eternal home this as it says that heirs of the same promise for he looked for a city which have foundations whose builder and maker is god what was it the future home the eternal home remember in the series and i know you remember exactly the date the title and everything i said on in the supreme faith of abraham and how that he was looking for the thing that god was revealing to him is i will be a god to thee forever i'm going to give you an inheritance forever i am the everlasting god and at some point abraham could have had this kind of faith to say wait a minute you mean forever it's like so then that means what happens to death and god would have been like you're on to something i don't know how his conversations went but i've had a lot of people tell me stories how they have conversations with god and i can't find that anywhere in the bible where god talks to people the way they say he does and so this is an eternal home that he was seeking for but yet even though he had an eternal home it says by faith he dwelled in tabernacles it's still by faith that he continued remained and abided it's still by faith that he's he's by faith he has a vision of home by faith he sees something eternal but then he has faith to build him a place he has a place of faith that causes him to settle and it says in verse 13 about these forefathers these all died in faith not having received thee promises but having seen them afar off and were persuaded of them and embraced them and confessed notice this phrase that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth just an immigrant i'm just one that's passing through i have no permanent possession in this land i'm a stranger in a pilgrim i've come from i've left my homeland i've left where my roots are i left where i thought i would be forever and i'm in this place that's strange i have no family connections i have no legacy here i only have a promised future i have nothing to show as far as a title deed or anything but here i am on a promise he says but i'm a stranger and a pilgrim on earth remember that phrase i want to carry it through and so abraham's vision of a future home it was permanent fixed a city that hath foundations this image this is what i want you to catch by faith he sought an inherited place but then by faith he he built dwelling places when he souljourned so it gave him this vision of a future home gave him an image for his earthly dwelling what what he saw his future home to be it gave him a goal and a vision and ambition to pattern himself after that i don't want to just live here loose and indifferent and and live sad and beaten down and unhealthy and kind of take that as my lot in life and then like but one day i'm going to be happy i'm going to be sin free and i'm going to be healthy and then just kind of undergo here until you get there but rather use the vision of the future home and say then that i can pattern what that life will be there i want this life to begin to express and manifest those things it's even what this baptism of the holy ghost is a down payment of and the guarantee of is the blessedness of eternity and perfection and so abraham had that vision of a future home and he could pattern his present home after it and perhaps inspired by it inspired by that vision of eternity he built a grove to serve the purpose of the eternal everlasting one i want you to catch this though a stranger and a pilgrim on earth he built a home even though he was scattered even though he was uh even though he was seemingly didn't couldn't say whether or not he would be here permanently and he didn't lay a foundation and he was always renting and always in a place of tents that could be wrapped up and taken away and move on he's still where he was he built a home even though he was scattered he could soldier i remember father abraham provides an example and so we see this pattern happen when the church begins the body of christ in first peter chapter one verse one it says peter an apostle of jesus christ to the stranger scattered throughout pontus galatia cappadocia asia and bethennia so he's writing this letter to the strangers remember how that the bible paul called abraham and his seed after him strangers and pilgrims now peter is referring to the strangers scattered throughout pontus galatia cappadocia asia and bethennia the word strangers scattered throughout in one translation is soldiers of the dispersion there might be a good band name uh soul journalers of the dispersion and the soul genres of the dispersion the despoor the scattering about looking for a heavenly jerusalem pilgrims and strangers looking for heavenly jerusalem as their home just as abraham had a vision and he went out and he abode and he dwelt and he worshipped god now the christian church is being scattered abroad and they don't go out to galatia or pontus or cappadocia or bethennia and asia being a portion of that asia minor the present-day turkey on the furthermost west part there wasn't it wasn't that they oh well this is where we're forever going to be and this is my lot in life and this is my permanent abode and this is my fixed dwelling they went where god sent them they went where god was placing them and in doing it they realized that one day they have an inheritance in the eternal have any of you ever debated um just uh after you got done talking about the the table at the wedding supper i've debated about what you're going to get in the millennium you've talked about that and sister elizabeth i just believe that because we've come to phoenix and spend out our days here that god's going to give us leelanau peninsula in michigan in the millennium and i don't know if it works that way but it's fun to talk about it i think maybe just fruitless but uh there's an idea that i i'm not looking at whatever takes place here in the 75 to 100 something years that we have on earth that this is going to be the sum and substance and i take my character and i leave a legacy and there's not going to be anything to show for it there's an eternal home that we're going to and so do we have that first map i don't know if that's next and then maybe track the notes in there so we can see this i don't know if you'll be able to see it very well and i kind of apologize for including incongruent maps that i'm using i like to use things that would be um look a little bit better but i found i was spending maybe too much time trying to find a map that i found some that could kind of help i want you to listen to what i'm saying but if you want your eyes to kind of glance at this map and look at this to see the different places that paul mentions in the north there pontus and bethenia galatia in the middle asia to uh to the west cappadocia to the east and and and peter excuse me is describing strangers scattered throughout this area soul journals of the dispersion and it's scattered it means it's driven out of their own land and and moved or driven uh driven out by persecution and being driven out by persecution and circumstance they were seeking a place of refuge in a place of safety and there's a reason why they went and it says in acts chapter 8 verse 1 and saul was consenting unto his death and kind of jumping into the the the middle of this it says and at that time this is the part i want you to see and at that time there was a great persecution against the church which was at jerusalem and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of judea and samaria except the apostles and so there is a persecution of the church at jerusalem and then what happens is all the believers that had gathered at jerusalem they begin to be persecuted and so they start to scatter a little bit this is what the bible's showing us the scattering because we see the example of abraham traveling down you can actually attract it on this map you can see where abraham began and would have come down and entered into the promised land even going down into egypt and coming back up it's showing that now in the birth of the christian church starting there at jerusalem all these believers because of persecution are scattered through these other regions but the apostles stay so believers are being scattered now in first peter chapter 2 verse 11 and you can again just continue to ponder this map dearly beloved i beseech you as strangers and pilgrims abstain from fleshly lust which war against the soul now you can go to these verses here but john and we'll come back to these maps dearly beloved i beseech you as strangers and pilgrims abstained from fleshly lust which war against the soul so again he's beseeching them as pilgrims and strangers dispersed among the world scattered abroad this is how paul refers to the believer in that day in that time strangers and pilgrims dispersed abroad scattered about because of persecution paul acting against the church scatters them abroad that the regions of judea and samaria and now i want you to catch that we're still pilgrims and strangers and there's many many many scriptures and quotes we can use on this and the sermon once more lord brother abraham says lord god may our eyes come open to the fact that he is still the messiah and may we embrace him tonight for we have confessed that we are pilgrims and strangers of this world it says it many many different times although peter was referring to people who were literally of a dysphoria within the christian church and literally christians scattered abroad as it says from judea and sumeria and all all the areas round about and peter even saying they're in cappadocia and they're in asia and bethenny and galatia he says you being strangers and pilgrims and that's true then and it's true today that we are pilgrims and strangers of this world he says this is not our home this is not our land we are a different acting people because we are born from above born again from above and this is i want to continue reading this because it holds such a critical part to what we're saying this morning and we who hold this promise in our heart may we see the promise that jesus made to his church that we would see just prior to his coming as we see the days of noah returning eating drinking marrying given in marriage and the morals of the land then he said as it was in the days of sodom to the gentiles before the fire fell that god came down and was manifested in flesh by knowing the secrets of the hearts of the people and he promised the same thing to return it kind of brings abraham into this image of pilgrims and strangers and god's visitation and so we are pilgrims and strangers like the first church was and we are like abraham we're dwelling even in uh temporal bodies temporary bodies we are dwelling in temporary houses we we do it looking for an eternal body we do it looking for an eternal mansion a place to live an eternal inheritance and it ought to be a comfort to us that when we see the signs of economic downturn when we see the reality of losing things that we hold dear or our 401k is kind of just going to nosedive and everything we save up for is dwindling away and our all the those um alt coins that we thought we'd be able to retire on uh this august are worth nothing there should be some consolation uh that you can always repent and not make the same mistake again and that we have an eternal inheritance it ought to be a consolation to us is it not paul that told us that if we were only living this life christians are the most miserable people and it's amazing how some christians just live the most miserable lives and it's a shame when we want everyone else to be miserable i think sometimes this is just really impressed upon my heart over the last couple days how sometimes we see people that that whether it be family members they fellowship with us they lived with us they went to church with us they confessed the same things we did and they backslide and they go off and it looks like they're living their best life i mean like they are what hipsters aspire to be and we we want to say we want to say oh you're miserable you're not happy you must be totally miserable what if they're totally happy what if what if they are finally free and living their best life because remember this is by election and if someone who doesn't have the seed of god with the with the the the perversions that exist and the manipulations and the tortures that people use the bible to inflict upon other people they are miserable because they've never experienced the grace of god they only experience the legalism of man and man legally is trying to make them seed when they're not that produces people who are crazy who are depressed who are manic who who can't find peace except they experience the love of god from those who actually have it and they get away from toxic cultures and toxic environments like no i really am happy you know what i find in my heart thinking i'm glad they are i want them to be free from depression i want them to be free from affliction i want them to be free from sorrow i want them to be free from from anxiety and if they can have that god bless them and if they're elect they're coming right back to what they left and the only way they're going to want to come to it is if we're salty enough and christ-like enough and have a door open enough that's a place where they could come to find him and so we are like abraham looking for something eternal and as abraham planted a grove in the wilderness of beersheba in the land of the philistines god will provide for us a place this is where i get my thought and the title came from god will because i i i was there's ways you look at it well the tree represents christ the tree represents the church well abraham represents adam or he represents god and you're thinking man you can just type anything any way you want well yeah you're free to do whatever you want i guess but i i see the truth and i catch the principle in god's word and then the types can be used and emerged because at the end of the day you say well maybe that's not a good type the truth remains the truth remains and what i began to real when i the way i looked at it is i couldn't put myself i could put myself in the place of abraham but then i put myself in the place of abraham's seed in what abraham did for isaac and what he was doing for jacob and what he was doing for his seed and i saw abraham acting as god implanting a grove for a place for his son to worship planting a grove for all the other those who would come to know him a place that they could gather to have common fellowship so just as we are strangers and pilgrims and abraham a stranger pilgrim planted a place in the land of philistines he's promised to provide for you a place that you can call home now we can look at these maps again consider the elect scattered throughout pontus galatia cappadocia asia and bethennia god's sheep were scattered for different reasons spread out all over asia minor and even further abroad and it's some of the references you find in scripture and some of the the convictions and beliefs based upon that the furthest reaches that maybe some of the apostles went it's it's a marvel it's a marvel to something to marvel at when you consider just how far the gospel was spreading then and to look at this and we know that the the when the holy spirit fell on the day of pentecost when i want to come to that and the church began to grow from there paul accounts of this in acts chapter 18 verses 1 to 3. we believe luke writing and after these things paul departed from athens and came to court again i just want you to ponder the map as you listen to these places and found a certain jew named aquila born in pontus lately come from italy with his wife priscilla so here's a man who was born in pontus which would be at the north of asia minor but then he immigrated and moved to italy but then the bible says because he says lately he come from italy but then it says because that claudius had commanded all jews to depart from rome so here's someone born in one place moves to another place and now he is departed and he finds himself in in another region and it paul just happens to come to him and paul comes to them come in corinth and came to them and because he was of the same craft paul being a tent maker he aboled with them and wrought for by their occupation they were tit-makers and i guess it blessed me to see this in that abraham would have constructed a tent and raised a tent as pilgrims and strangers and here's paul making tents making dwelling places making tabernacles together with aquila began in pontus move to rome now moved to corinth god moves his people for different reasons but when they were in corinth paul had a place to come and abide god had a provided a place even for paul and then later in the same chapter speaking of apollos who was born in alexandria and then came to ephesus it says and they be he began to speak boldly in the synagogue whom when aquila and priscilla had heard they took him unto them and so they take him into their home and expounded unto him the way of god more perfectly this is the one born in pontus living in italy now migrating back in first corinthians chapter 16 verse 19 now i'm just going through some of these verses we've used before but kind of look at this where everyone's spreading and recognize this common thing scattered throughout but notice what's happening paul says the churches of asia salute you aquila and priscilla salute you much in the lord with the church that is in their house so it's churches of asia we say asia again you notice it's on it would be uh it wouldn't be all of asia that we would refer to today as a continent but this this one part on the western coast colossians chapter 4 verse 15 salute the brethren which are in laodicea and nymphus and the church which is in his house in galatians it speaks about the churches of galatia and paul writes to philemon in verse 2. the church in the house together with his brothers in acts chapter 14 verse 23 and when they had ordained them elders in every church so there's churches of asia there's churches throughout these different areas and they had to ordain pastors in every church paul wasn't going around setting up live streams in acts chapter 15 verse 41 and he went through syria and cilicia confirming the churches so again now this is in syria and and celestia in acts chapter 16 verse 5 and so were the churches established in the faith and increased in number daily in ii corinthians chapter eight verse one see if you can find it on the map it says moreover brethren we do we do you to wit of the grace of god bestowed on the churches of macedonia if god called amanda macedonia don't you think they're just wouldn't he just call them to the whole church a whole place in macedonia it should only be one church in macedonia but there was churches of macedonia revelations chapter 1 verse 11 saying i am alpha and omega here christ speaking the first and last and what thou seest write in a book and send it unto thee seven churches which are in asia there were seven literal churches in ephesus smyrna pergamus thytira sardis philadelphia and laodicea wasn't just one mega church wasn't just one pastor but they all served the true church and as you look at this and pondered this why would god establish churches in these places why would we read through and find that there was churches in pontus galatians cappadocia asia bethennia uh in corinth and in ephesus and in laodicea and syria and cilician macedonia and phytaira and sardis philadelphia pergamos smyrna all these places why would there be churches in all these different places there's ways that we could track the paul's travels and find there's a lot of other places you can see where churches were being established why would all these places have a church and then god ordained an elder in that church because it's where god was placed as elect that's where the elect went so god was establishing a place for the elect to where they would not be on their own they would not be alone but there would be a place a grove where they could worship you see where all this began in acts chapter 2 verses 4 to 12 this is very beautiful and they were all filled the holy ghost this is the day of pentecost they were 112 120 gathered in the upper room and began to speak with other tongues as a spirit gave them utterance and there were dwelling at jerusalem jews devout men out of every nation under heaven now when his this was noised abroad the multitude came together and were confounded because that every man heard them speak in his own language and they were all amazed and marveled saying one to another behold are not all these which speak galileans and how here we every man in our own tongue wherein we were born so they were born elsewhere but now we're in jerusalem and some say they living there they dwelled there some others saying they're visiting at the time of the passover and i could certainly say it would be true that they may be devout men jews living as the bible says proselytes to the faith or jews themselves who had lived there and migrated there and then others who may have come for the passover but now in this one place they're hearing the word of god preach they're hearing this remarkable move of god and it says we hear every man in our own wherein we were born parthians and needs and elamites and the dwellers in mesopotamia and in judea and cappadocia in pontus in asia phrygia and pamphlea in egypt in the parts of libya about cyrene and strangers of rome jews and proselytes cretes and arabians we do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of god think of all these places and they were all amazed and were doubt saying one another what meaneth this so they all came to one place and began to see god fulfill his word hear a gospel here jesus christ preached and then what happens from here if you look at this this is what we just read from this one place they hear the word of god and then it says the the the believers were scattered abroad throughout the regions of judea and whether they had come for the passover and heard the truth and then left or they were dwelling there when they were persecuted they all went back to the places they lived before and all of a sudden from one epicenter you could see where it starts in jerusalem and they go back to egypt and libya in crete and rome and they spread out each one of these believers branching off and this is how the faith was propagated like seeds from a tree and the winds of persecution and winds of change and winds of leadership and god calling people either back home or to other places to seek safety this is how the faith was established and spread and dispersed the the elect heard the word where they were but when they were placed by god and sent out the word went with them and when they found themselves in galatia in pontus and all these other places god there would plant a grove where the elect could gather around the word god dispersed the elect but he always provided a home a place that could speak about and lift up and reflect their future home now in jeremiah chapter 23 verses 1 to 6 i'm going to read through this and i want you just to catch the image of god's promise to you jeremiah chapter 23 verses 1 to 6. and again there's much that we could expound on this but in this image of scattering peter said they're scattered abroad luke ryden scattered abroad everyone scattered but where they ended up god provided a place it says well be unto the pastors that destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture saith the lord therefore thus saith the lord god of israel against the pastors that feed my people you have scattered my flock and driven them away and have not visited them behold i will visit upon you the evil of your doing saith the lord and i will gather the remnant of my flock out of all countries whether i have driven them and i will bring them again to their folds and they shall be fruitful and increase what a beautiful callback to the garden of eden and i will set up shepherds over them which shall feed them and they shall fear no more nor be dismayed neither shall they be lacking saith the lord what beautiful language what a beautiful promise to us and how often some of us have looked to this scriptures god's promise to me as a believer that he promised he would feed me he promised he would care for me he promised he would give me substance that he would feed the word to me this is a promise that he gave me and then it it blends into a prophecy of christ behold the days come said lord that i will raise unto david who was a shepherd a righteous branch remember this image of a family tree coming out of david christ is that branch christ is that tree and the king shall reign and prosper david was a shepherd who became a king christ is the image of this tree as a shepherd as a king and shall execute judgment and justice in the earth and in his days judas shall be saved and israel shall dwell safely and this is his name whereby he shall be called the lord our righteousness the tree the tree of righteousness christ is the branch christ is the shepherd christ is the king and this prophecy prophecy is connected to what god is going to do when he takes scattered sheep and brings them to their fold where they'll be fruitful and increase and be fed and fear no more don't be dismayed nor be lacking it's going to be where they raises up a shepherd and provides a branch and provides a place of shelter and safety i will gather my flock in our spiritual sense the elect and bring them to their folds they will have a home flock here is a reference to pastoral sheep and and all animals within a breed are related strictly speaking and according to the law in leviticus 19 19 thou shalt not let thy cattle gender with diverse kind the image is not just some hodgepodge of a of different species mixed together in a whole you know different things and you got a cow you got an ox you've got a goat you've got a giraffe you've got a rhino just all kind of gathering along no it would have been a this homogenous herd of sheep and then and and the purity they would gender them together of their kind they would be the same seed the same family that's what's seen in this flock that are scattered about these sheep that are driven out and i'm going to bring them back to it's his flock so they're of his seed and i'm gonna bring them to their folds it's a place of abode a habitation notice the language of the scripture it says it's gonna be a safe place to dwell a place of rest and provision under his branches under his care place to be cared for just read what it says here in this scripture it's a place to be cared for a place to be fruitful place to increase a place to be washed to fear i'm going to bring them back and in their fold they're going to be washed to fear and it says neither shall they be dismayed this is a very beautiful uh promise because it says it's going to be a place of healing they're healed of their dismay which is a brokenness neither shall they be lacking under this righteous branch under this righteous tree there will be a place of safety security justice judgment it's a place reflecting home where the king is and let me say this i'm making a turn and i feel that i'm i'm rounding second on my way to home in an inside the park home run that this is what our house is ought to be for our families today this is these scriptures are speaking of what as a shepherd in the home as a pastor home as a father in a home this is my this is my image a place of home a place called home brother brandman question and answers part four we'll amplify this more in the future make your home nice make your home a place where your daughter or son will not be ashamed to bring their company before their father and mother and into their house make homes so happy that they'll be pleased in their home to stay there this is what home want to be we say a place called home i was going to take time today to expound upon how there's a difference between a house and a home a vast difference between a house and a home this can just be a house it can just be a gathering place where people come they hear word priests and they just leave and they feel no connection they feel no benefit they're not getting all the things they ought to and people can treat this as a house but you won't get the benefits until it's made a home and you treat it like a home and so this is what we ought to aspire to have in our homes as as parents make your home a nice place a happy place and that's what this church ought to be for believers today a place called home brother braham says in a message uncertain sound but in the church house he's talking about how he preached a meeting in five nights and some uh in some sort of conventional arena he says he likes to be in a church but in the church house i believe the angels of god encamp around because of saints gathering there it's a noted place for god where he comes and meets with his people that's what this is that's what the sanctuary is that's what we're doing on sundays and i want our children to hear this that when we say we're going to church we're not just coming to church to see brother lucas we're coming to church because this is where god meets us we're coming to church because he meets us here he says it's a place where he comes and meets with his people it's always seemed kindly good to me to be in church i like it better it's on my in a church place and instead of an arena so you can be a and he says it seems like at home i know it's just a fragment but i wonder if he was going to say family it seems like at home you know it's where we just fellowship together and have things in common that's what church ought to be church ought to have the feelings of home the sentiments of home the restoration of the bride tree brother graham's praying before he preaches a message on the bride tree the restoration of the bride tree he says bless this little church help me lord as i go to bring the message to other people and may we together like one person one family stick together and pray together and live together in holy unity of the holy spirit until jesus receives us into his kingdom for we ask in his name and for his glory amen that's what church ought to be a place where we together like one person and one family stick together pray together live together in holy unity of the holy spirit that's what church ought to be just as these believers were scattered throughout all all over that region in that area they were not just left alone there was a place where god planted a church there was a place where god ordained elders there was a place that they could gather with those other precious saints and have things in common and lift up the word of god and lift up a common ambition read the letters of paul together hear the word of god preach it was a place that god provided for them and i believe that today there must be a place on earth that can promote the highest of heaven there must be a place where christ is lifted up there's many different quotes and if you're familiar with uh with them then you could just say you could say amen when i strike that cord but home life is broken home life isn't uh uh uncertain the security of the home is broken and i put it my the words i'm using now the the family tree has been cut down it's been completely torn apart to where we all live such separate lives even to where it's striking and don't amen too loud because then you might think you're talking about the neighbors in the department next door but there's families believing families that come to church husbands and wives that live completely separate lives than with each other because this one does their thing this one does their thing and it's just like they convene at night when they go to bed but in the morning they're going right back apart again and then the children themselves they are broken up they do this they do that they do this they do that there's no family time together there's no family meal time there's no family unity there's no family involvement everyone has their own little things that they're doing and you don't even have to go into another room to do it you can all just sit at the same table and do it now because everybody has a screen and it's uh the whole concept of family time family togetherness it's been rejected the world doesn't value it like it once did and this is in the image of the fall and you know i'm realizing now i may have bit off a little bit more than i could chew and i i don't know okay well you can stay um but i'm just starting to i'm starting to wonder just where we're at as far as time because i really really want to um emphasize something here because there's in the something in the image of the fall that that has is climaxing in the day that the time that we're living in now in genesis chapter 4 verses 16 and 17 after cain is uh punished it says and cain went out from the presence of the lord isn't that remarkable you say the presence of the lord was in this a particular place it was towards the presence of the lord there was something very special about this area that they were in even though there were severance guarding the way that you couldn't get to the tree of life that it still denoted something about god something to keep god in your conscience and so when he went out from the presence of the lord god's speaking to him and he leaves him and and i realized now in cutting some of the things out that i did last night we know that the presence of god is declared by the voice of god and and so it was where the voice where the voice of god is lifted up that's where his presence is declared so he's fleeing from that and it says he dwelt in the land of nod this is just aimless no ambition on the east of eden and cain knew his wife and she conceived and bare enoch and now notice this contrast and he builded a city and called the name of the city after the name of his son enoch now think of how vastly different this is of abraham who after his son is born he planted a grove and called on the name of the lord but now cain has a son and immediately he builds a city not planting a grove but he builds a city and he calls the name of the city after his son enoch and a city was a place at the time you didn't need a city there was no reason to have a city there was no need to have civilization and all these other things but a city was a place that was guarded by watch you put up walls you built things strategically so you could be on watch and he built it because of fear he built it because of terror and you know what struck me and i never quite looked at it this way cain built the city to protect himself from people like himself the only reason why you need the only reason why kane needed to build a city is in case there was other canes out there you don't have to worry about adam you didn't have to worry about his mom you'd have to worry about all these other it was cain had to protect himself from cain but through his fear and his paranoia civilization he began to read what the the artificers and the workings and what they began to do and musical instruments all these things this is cain's idea civilization protection entertainment always he begins to build it toward climaxes in genesis 6 11 12 the earth also was corrupted before god and the earth was filled with violence and god looked upon the earth and behold it was corrupt and all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth all begins with cain being ushered out having a son enoch and then he's afraid of all these other uh siblings and all this other family in the world he says we better build a city and he builds a city he doesn't call upon the name of the lord he doesn't begin to honor god what does he do he calls it names it after his son it's a legacy to man it's a legacy to himself it's all born out of ambition and fear needed to protect himself and then we see the conclusion of that kind of thought process and the intermingling for the whole earth is corrupt the earth is filled with violence and all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth except for one man noah and that's exactly the condition of the world today the climax of satan's seeds that he was sowing in genesis 4. as the bible says in luke chapter 17 verses 26 to 32 it says as it was in the days of noah so shall it be in the days of the son of man they did eat they drank now again i'd like to point out and this has been done a brazilian times let's just do it one more time they ate they drank they married wives they were given in marriage well let's just try to pick that apart and figure out what's wrong with that but it's it's what's denoted in the days of noah until the day that noah entered in the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all we're right back again in the days of noah likewise also as it was in the days of lot it's interesting he points out the days of lot both times of judgment but in this case he leaves out abraham but he's bringing us to that time because there's a mystery contained in here they did eat they drank they bought they sold they planted they build it i don't know if anybody built today or planted today but maybe some of us have eaten or drank something maybe you've bought maybe you've sold thanks to craigslist or ebay but in the same day that lot went out of sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all think of how god christ is choosing to characterize the daily activities of man in this time of judgment and here verse 30 even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed so what's going to happen when the son of man is getting revealed people are going to be eating drinking sleeping waking working planting buying buildings selling doing all sorts of stuff marrying all that's going to take place just people living and living aimlessly like cain was building civilizations doing what would happen in genesis chapter 6 all these things are going to be happened but then god is going to reveal himself so as it was in the days of lot so then we have the image of sodom and the days of lot but there's another type to that there's another scene where it says even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed and then prophesying and the nearness of this i think is very important prophesying the days of the siege of jerusalem it says in that day he which shall be upon the house top and his stuff in the house let him not come down to take it away take what the stuff in the house he that is in the field let him likewise not return back he is now brought up in that prophecy he's raised something about the working the planking the building the selling the marion and all those things that becomes the distraction he says remember lot's wife because when she left sodom there was something that remained there that kept her heart that kept her attention in all these labors of planting building drinking buying selling there's something that was missing there's something about what they're doing and these days that's connected to the heart of cain who went out from the presence of the lord and built the city not to honor god not as a place to worship god but a place to honor himself and to preserve his legacy after him so christ says in that day if you're on the housetop don't go down and i like i was just and his stuff that's what this all that's that's all we have is just stuff in our houses what is it you have that that really really nice expensive comforter you bought it's just stuff our whole house is just one big junk drawer at least my garage is it's just stuff and i challenge you this week to get rid of 100 items and you'll find just how much you love stuff why would he say this it's not the stuff the possessions in the house we ought to be concerned with he that is in the field in his labor all worried about his job what are you worried about your job for is that more important is that what has the preeminence is that what drives you is that what motivates you it's not those things we ought to be concerned about christ is bringing this up and these things of planting buying buildings selling all these things and then he uses this image and the day that the son of man is revealed and he kind of inserts this prophecy the siege of titus and then he brings it right back remembers lot's wife he's wanted us to consider what motivates us what drives us what has the premise what has greater value does the promise or does the pleasure does his presence or is it your position our purpose is greater than possessions brother braham says in flashing red light are the signs of his coming he says the red lights are flashing and the time is at hand as it was in the days of noah see they took the legitimate thing and perverted it they took eating and they took drinking they put building and they put all these other things and perverted so there's a perversion they perverted it wasn't just the act of eating that's all fast it wasn't just the active drinking let's all die of dehydration no it's in the perverting of it and i love how he says this jesus expects us to build a home he expects us to build a home and remember as men we're homebuilders as sisters your homemakers we have a responsibility not to literally go out and buy a plot of land and build a house but to whatever where we live where we reside to turn that dwelling into a home to make this church which is a gathering place make it a home week jesus expects us to build but just look what has taken place in that look at what church has become today christianity today christianity is a mean to the world they laugh at it they tr they troll the christians of today he says eating he expects us to eat that's right look well look what's taking place in that he goes on continues on with the drinking that there's things that we have to do there's things of necessity but look how it gets perverted so he finishes that chapter luke 17 verse 37 as he's saying there's going to be going to be those taken and they're like where where where wheresoever the body is feather will the eagles be gathered together not gathered around stuff not gathered around jobs not gathered around eating planting buying selling not gathering around all those things but gathered around the word because that's where eagles gather it's prophesied that there is a gathering place for his elect there's a place of provision there's a place of rest there's a place of shelter that's what's the image in jeremiah 23 in the flock that was once scattered is then going to be all brought scattered it's amazing when you look at sheep that if sheep they're such a remarkable animal that it's it's necessary that they have someone that could shorn them and shave them or that can get to a point to where their wool grows so much it can lead to their death they can't see they can't eat they it'll actually kill them unless they have someone looking out over them and watching over them so these ones that are scattered they're not supposed to be on their own they're not supposed to be out here they're not supposed to be out there he says i'm going to bring them to folds places of habitation where they can dwell safely they can dwell peaceably and they can receive justice what is that know what their value and know their worth so many times we take justice in the sense of legalism your skirts are too short your hills are too high all of you are making us look bad in the way that you live in the way that you dress no justice is letting the people see who they really are that's what justice is it's not a measuring stick or a closed line or beating people up it's to justices to treat them as they ought to be treated and to show them who they are in the word of god gathering place for the elect rest and shelter so just as cain in genesis chapter 4 went out from the presence of the lord running away from god running away from the voice of god and build as a son and builds a city and names the city after his sons like i don't want to have anything to do with the presence of god in genesis chapter 4 verses 25 and 26 and add them to his wife again and she bear a son and called his name seth for god said she hath appointed me for god said she hath appointed me another seed instead of abel whom cain slew and to seth to him also there was born a son so now remember the image of abraham first but now cain the contrast and now look again what's in seth he has a son named born and he names them enos then began men to call upon the name of the lord such a difference and that's what we see in genesis chapter 21 the birth of a son and invoking the name of jehovah and the everlasting god the eternal god then again men men here are the sons of adam and the bible says then men begin to call upon the name of the lord it means the sons of god sought god together and as i pondered this last week i i i i thought how how did this happen was it just instinct was it just innate in them it was just something that you know seth has a son and then enos comes out and he just wants to serve god but when you look at the family you would see that adam had instilled in his son seth and likewise he wanted to be expressed even to enos a sense of the divine a sense of his presence that is not said of adam it is not said of seth it is not said of his seed that they fled from the presence of the lord it was a place where adam wanted to keep the voice of god fresh the remembrance of god fresh the promise though how no matter how much his channels had been clogged something and adam wanted to keep the testimony alive of what god had the promise that god had made and so they invoked the name of god together and when the bible says they called they called upon the name lord in one translation i think even to the hebrew it says they called they were called by the name of the lord in other words they called themselves by the name of the lord they called themselves the sons of god that's why you find later when the sons of god saw the daughters of men because in this moment there's a contrast there's a distinction cain has run off into his folly the way of cain has a son builds a city names it after his son but now by teaching now by inspiration now by conviction now even after after the similitude of their brother abel after the image of adam seth has a son and they began not just to call upon the name lord but they identified themselves not as sons of men but as sons of god and that is what we begin to declare to for ourselves we are not just men and women but we are sons and daughters of god and adam instilling this in his family and his family beginning to reflect i this a topic for a minister's meeting back east the topic is i don't know if you got it uh brother reggie but it's uh was able born righteous so i text one of the brothers out there and says now it's getting fun and what happens in genesis chapter 21 it says abraham planted a grove in beersheba you're like brother aaron you're still reading it we've all memorized it abraham planted a grove in beersheba and called there on the name of the lord the everlasting god i'm closing and i want you to ponder this very deeply to realize that this one scripture is so inspiring we've only looked at it for these last two services but it inspired the first two and you look at this abraham planted the grove in beersheba there was so much that led to this moment that's built into this action and there's so much that it foreshadowed he planted a tree planted a grove a garden remember all these things that we've expressed but it was a place as i mentioned earlier that he could testify what god had done for him there he called on the name lord the everlasting god it's just exactly what seth and enos did the lineage of adam they called themselves the sons of god abraham would call himself the son of god a servant of the most high it was a place that abraham testified of the son of man who visited him and the god who gave him a promise and the god who had most recently fulfilled it is that right in genesis 21 and where was it now i'm just i'm going to read from genesis chapter 18 and then i have um three more quotes in a scripture i'm not going to tell you how long they are but after this genesis chapter 18 verses 1 to 8 and follow this with me because this is part of the inspiration to his grove in genesis chapter 18 verses 1 to 8 and the lord appeared unto abram appeared unto him in the plains of mamrie and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day we can all relate to that and the tent door imagine this tent would have been built in a place that would have provided some shade probably north facing and he lift up his eyes and looked and lo three men stood by him when he saw them he ran to meet them from the tent door and bowed himself toward the ground so he's left as he sees them coming and traveling he leaves this place where he's abiding he leaves this place where he was just standing and he runs to them and by revelation he doesn't just acknowledge the three but he acknowledges the one he says my lord if now i have found faith in thy sight pass not away i pray thee from thy servant he is calling him lord he is acknowledging that this is god this is not this is some this is the image of god this is a one in the person of god he reverences him lord if i found favor pass not from thy servant and watch what his instinct is let a little water i pray you be fetched and wash your feet and rest yourselves under the tree i wanted to wash your feet set them under the tree he says and i will fetch a morsel of bread and comfort you your hearts after that you shall pass on what a beautiful image and and i like to i was looking at this in the continuity of abraham's life after he had returned from the battle who was it melchizedek that meets them and serves them bread and wine and abraham's revelation is growing and service is growing and and his ministry is growing he's learning how to serve and he he gets this example so now he's able to return what he has received and the bread and the wine and the nourishment and the ministry after the battle in genesis 14 now he says lord let me fetch some water to wash your feet rest under the tree and i will fetch a morsel of bread and comfort ye your hearts after that ye shall pass on for therefore ye come to your servant and they said so do as thou has said so they he met him and he says come under the tree where was the tree it was where that tent was by the tent door they could gather under that tree it was gonna be a place where he washed their feet fed them bread and abraham hastened to the tendon to sarah and said make ready quickly three measures of fine meal knead it and make cakes upon the earth and abraham ran into the herd and fetched a calf tender and good and gave it unto a young man five stars and he hasted to dress it and he took butter and milk and the calf which he had dressed and set it before them and he stood by them under the tree and they did eat what a beautiful saying these men coming upon him in the heat of the day must have been a hot day and he comes and his instinct is to minister to them let me wash your feet let me get you some bread let me get you some water let me get you some milk let me get you some a calf let's let's take bread and butter and let's eat and dress it and you sit here under the tree and rest and he stood there with him under the tree a resting place a place of feeding a place where his home was right there under that shade tree and brother branham in the modern events made clear by prophecy i found dozens of places where brother bran just brought this the tree the tree under the tree and this instance of the revealing of the son of man he said one day under the shade tree while they were sitting and resting god came down in the form of a man and to catch the full picture and i believe i just like how this summarizes it so it can help us to close here in the message this day this scripture is fulfilled now abraham did not go down in sodom he and his group he had a big group with them enough to fight off a dozen kings in their army so he had a big group with them and he was setting out there under an oak tree one day when everything was going wrong for him nobody had anything to do with him but he was still holding on to that promise there was a place where he sat with his group his family under that tree despised rejected persecuted maybe not fitting in with the crowd like lot was but he says watch now closely before we close while he was sitting there down come three men walking to him two of them went down into sodom and preached the gospel to them to come out to lot but one stayed with abraham notice and he's expanding the story beyond where they went down and the lord remained with him under that tree to reveal himself and further unfold the revelation and promise to another tree says notice one that stayed with abraham was god himself where did he come to he came to that home he came to that place and it was there under that shade tree where god spoke to him and confirmed the promise and said i will return unto you according to the time of life and sarah shall have a son it was in that place under that tree that god spoke to him and confirmed the promise and so once god fulfilled that promise in genesis chapter 21 this is what abraham's tree represents in verse 33 this is what it represents it's in the image of the place that god met him in the door the tent door underneath that tree it's a place where god met him and it was a place of service and feet washing and feeding and i say may this church be a tree where god can come to it may this church be a tree where god could come and reveal himself to abraham's seed in the contrast to what was going on in sodom may this be a place that's not characterized by eating and drinking and buying and selling and planting and building may not be a place that's just busy with the things of life busy with carnal things busy with carnal pursuits busy with just opportunities i think i mentioned it the other day and it's really the sad reality i think some people just look at it as a church as an opportunity to pull off another mlm right just more people to practice their wares on and sell things too and get things out of the people and that's not what family is for that's not what the church is for it's not just a place for us to find find people who can do our bidding it's not just a place we say oh i'm glad we got a church i need to move no those are all the things that how a family functions in its and its growth and it's a development it's not just a place for eating and drinking buying and selling planting and building as things are in the world but it's a place where the voice of god is stronger than the voice of politics it's a place where the voice of god is stronger than the voice of hollywood it's a place where the voice of god is speaking therefore it's a place where we come not running from the presence of the lord but a place where the presence of god is guaranteed brother i said it's noted for god it's a place where the son of man is being revealed a place to feed on his unfailing word musicians please come in ephesians chapter 2 verse 6. paul's speaking about us he says he's raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in christ jesus that's it that's what we're doing now raised us up together made us sit together where abraham was that day under that tree he had a view of the well-watered plains of sodom he had a view of where those angels were going down but he had this place just a little bit higher a little bit off apart with god himself he's raised us to sit to raise us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in christ jesus the sermon i am the resurrection and the life i said that's what this church ought to be now i want to close with this this quote will be this is the sermon for wednesday night he said there's righteous people walking in the light of the lord he's talking about the the family the simeon and the those that he was revealing himself to he says that's the kind of home god can get into righteous people walking in the light that's the kind of home that god can get into now if you're serving all kinds of parties and beer and everything in your house god will never visit you there that's right but if you've got a home that's cleaned up and living for god with prayer and the bible open and a few tear stains on it god can visit you that's right because you've opened up a channel that he can come to that's the word of god you can open up a channel how by making it a place that god can come to imagine that abraham planted a grove and often looked to the horizon for another visitation of elohim had it had a place there before the well-watered plains of sodom in the heat of the day just sitting there as brother bradham said nobody will have anything to do with me everything's going wrong but he's sitting there saying but i know who holds tomorrow i know the promise he made sarah god made the promise wrestling with things pondering things but that day under that tree he looked up and the lord was coming and there under that tree in the heat of the day bread was served feet were washed meat was eaten and god spoke to him and confirmed his promise and i could just see abraham after this son is born he planted a tamask tree and he planted a grove and he he had a place reserved there and it was a reminder it was a reminder of that place where god met him it was in that place he could testify of the one who came and spoke to him of the one who came and prophesied to him that's what this church is it's a well it's an oasis it's a place you can call home that's what your houses need to be the place that can be called home our heavenly father lord in our hearts we see so much truth we hear so much word and there's a longing to live it [Music] there's an image in the scripture that seems historical it seems allegorical that seems in shadows and types and lord as i preach it i realize to some it may seem to be pointing backwards but lord may there be a quickening right now that it just comes into focus for present day just in this moment lord there can be husbands that recognize a pathway to make this applicable wives who can see avenues to support that vision to not try to be the leader to not be the one that's pushing or the one that's pulling but just a way that they could support hold up their end of the labor now lord where there's homes that are broken or where there's maybe a difference of standard may you lord visit that home lord today visit this family as we've gathered this place this is a place where the atmosphere can be right and it's a noted place for god and we gather as a family there may be disharmony and disunity in our houses and our residences beyond these walls but if we can make this place a home then it can be a spot where you come and they feed their feet are washed they're nourished by the butter and the milk and the bread and the calf and it gives them courage to go home and do things right pray lord that you strengthen your families today lord you know in my own home there's such a a preciousness with my children such a beautiful vision that i share with my wife there's challenges lord and i know challenges are opportunities for victory challenges are opportunities to stay take steps higher but there's moments that break our hearts lord there's moments where we we trust we can only trust you lord for the outcome but i do not want to take my hands off lord from working from laboring from serving from sanctifying i could turn that house into a home lord with the way things are in economics and the future days unfold from weeks into years and decades it could be a time when not many would be able to own their own house but lord wherever we are maybe we make it a home this church now just renting lord but we don't want to look down on this facility lord we want to make it a home make it a place where you can come to so i pray that you bless us today thank you for your presence amongst us in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen
