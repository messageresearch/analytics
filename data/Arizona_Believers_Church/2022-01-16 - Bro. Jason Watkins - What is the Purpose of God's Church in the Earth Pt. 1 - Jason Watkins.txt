TRANSCRIPT
========================================
wow what a beautiful group of people god bless you happy to uh see all of you here today and uh captain john good to see you mitch good to see you god bless you all the different ones some faces i'm familiar with some not but amen we all have common father amen praise the lord brother beckett says we're brothers of a different mother but we all have the same father amen so i'm happy happy in the lord today we want to just invite you into the scriptures this morning to isaiah chapter 60 and we're going to just start with a familiar verse because the lord is going to put me through some gymnastics today and we're going to jump to quite a bit in the scripture i'm going to do it quickly we don't want to get bogged down in in a bible study i love bible study but and i have a a weakness to get to go down that and just keep going but i want to be able to deliver the burden that's on my heart today i'm grateful for the wonderful hospitality brother aaron and sister elizabeth and their children they are as dear to us as mortals can be my wife and i have loved them for a long time amen i've tried to get their kids to come live with me they won't but i almost had them when they were really young and uh eliza and jack especially but then the older boys were already too attached to mom and dad but i had a chance with when they were tiny and i couldn't get it done and now it's too late i asked eliza last night no staying with daddy amen so but the hospitality has been wonderful i did have to walk to church today but the hospitality has still been very very good amen so god bless you brother luke good to see you brother luke is a friend of my sons and i uh you know years ago i used to hear the wild exploits of brother luke hey man my boy's just you know he was like almost like a superhero to them so [Laughter] amen so we're happy to be here and brother mike and sister jennifer and all the all the my um they they're they're like family to me so i i i didn't release them you know with i mean it was a lot of care and a lot of thought and you know i for me to take a family uh with uh brother john sister nicole the different ones the children and and to to be willing as a pastor who had pastored them for a long time some they had lived there a little bit then some it was remote and so so to do uh to really feel in my heart that i had a complete freedom to hand them into the care of another shepherd i tell you when brother aaron decided to come here and follow the leadership of thus saith the lord and start a church i said i said brother mike here you go this is perfect my heart's in it a thousand and one percent i couldn't think of a family better and so i would tell you something friends your pastor is loved near and far around the world and i know that i've been around the world his ministry is greatly coveted so hang on to him because the world would like to have him amen so praise the lord we're happy in the lord today i just think all things are wonderful especially you know when the lord does it it just turns out beautiful amen the enemy can fight it but you know i tell my church all the time he ain't nobody you know he don't he don't run nothing but his mouth you know he has no say in your life you're not subject to him we don't live by the mercies of lucifer we live by the mercies of christ amen anything he can do he has to get permission from from the lord so amen we don't sweat him we fight him amen i'm gonna fight him until i'm taken from the earth i want my last testimony to be that god's word was true and satan was a liar straight up liar amen the bible in the in the greek new testament where where it talks about how that he's the father of lies and that you know when he when he speaketh a lie from the greek diaglot he actually speaks his native language it's his native tongue a lie is his native tongue and so um live from the beginning so we we're thankful in the lord today and you be praying for me we've got two services so i don't have to try to get it all out today i won't weary you amen we won't because i don't want you to get oversaturated and lose uh the main point i'm taking a title today the purpose of god's church in the earth now that's slightly different brother aaron from what i gave you i've already corrected that with captain john so if it's if it can be changed to the purpose of god's church in the earth amen isaiah chapter 60. well you're not going to find isaiah 60 in revelation 9. amen oh i just want i probably just gave you a clue where we're headed amen we're not going to turn to revelation 9 but i'm going to make reference to it and we're going to just try to hit some bible study points because i want to focus you today on a specific thought and we're going to just keep whittling our way till we get to that specific thought i i you know i i don't want you to get the wrong idea that uh that i'm not here to preach to everyone i am but i'm i'm actually in my heart if i just be honest with you for me i i really want the young people especially the teenagers in that senior uh age group to really try to comprehend and get your mind excuse my voice this morning get your mind wrapped around the things that god is doing in the hour that we live not just the day but the very hour this is happening in real time and things are happening quickly and uh i'm going to tell you something friends catastrophic cataclysmic judgments and change are coming to the world they're they're they're racing to meet us and the only way out is up and so we want to be aware of satan's devices and so i sometimes people think teenagers can't comprehend the deeper things of god you'd be wrong their minds are in that learning gear and they get it a lot quicker and faster than you think they will and besides it's uh you know you get you get young people enthused and full of fire and zeal you'll you'll light a whole church on fire amen they'll go crazy with it and the old people next thing you know they'll be jumping in with zeal and so uh we're we're hoping to inspire their hearts today because uh are they have more of a mission today than they might realize and it is my hope that we can bring that kind of clear today arise shine isaiah chapter 60 verse 1 very familiar to us arise shine for thy light is coming someday i need to read that again arise shine for thy light has come and the glory of the lord is risen upon thee so that's a right now scripture right for behold the darkness shall cover the earth and gross darkness the people but the lord shall arise upon thee and his glory shall be seen upon thee and the gentiles shall come to thy light and the kings and kings to the brightness of thy rising now i want you to drop down and look at verse 11 therefore thy gates shall be opened continually they shall not be shut day nor night that men may bring them to thee the forces of the gentiles and that their kings may be brought for the nation and the kingdom that will not serve thee shall perish yea those nations shall be utterly wasted the glory of lebanon shall come unto thee the fir tree the pine tree the box together to beautify the place of my sanctuary and i will make the place of my feet glorious verse 18 violence shall no more be heard in thy land wasting nor destruction within thy borders but thou shalt call thy walls salvation and thy gates praise the sun shall be no more the light by day neither for brightness shall the moon give light unto thee but the lord shall be unto thee and everlasting light and thy glory thy and thy god thy glory the sun shall no more go down neither shall the moon withdraw itself for the lord shall be thine everlasting light and the days of the morning shall be ended thy people also shall be all righteous they shall inherit the land forever the branch of my planting the work of my hands that i may be glorified a little one shall become a thousand and a small one a strong nation i the lord will hasten it in his time let's pray father we thank you for your word now we commit this reading and this ministry and the audience the speaker and hearers into your hands in jesus name amen god bless you can be seated all right praise the lord now we have taken the the latter part of isaiah 60 which of course is referencing you know a millennial world and from there we are we'll find ourselves in a new heavens and a new earth and the bible gives us such wonderful promises about that kingdom we know that the millennium uh is the uh the time of the honeymoon of the bride we realize the plan of redemption for god's family whose names are on the book of life of the lamb uh are now redeemed and we realize that you know the old testament bride the new testament bride moses and elijah the 144 000 they're all there together with us and uh we realize at the end of a thousand years then uh there's a the the the great white throne judgment and we we break from there into the new heavens and the new earth again i'm trying not to get bogged down into too much of that but but we found that before that wonderful reality can come you before you could get down to verse 11 or verse 18 or verse 22 you had to start at verse 1. there had to be something first to get us there you get me so today this may sound kind of strange but i'm i'm gonna try to have you thinking in reverse today so we're gonna rather a lot of times we start with where we are now where we're trying to get to but where we're going to get to is already set in the mind of god and the the issue has never been where am i going the question has always been where did i come from and so where i'm going is going to be according to the plan of god and so so we we know where we're headed we know that there's going to be a new heavens and a new earth we know that of the increase of the kingdom of the son of david there shall be no end of the increase of it there shall be no end now brother branham will tie that right to the hidden manna whereas we there was an application of that hidden manna in the church ages in history but brother branham talks about how that there's a future application uh how that some that that here we get a little taste of it and we think it's so good but someday he and that word will become what we never dreamed possible that it will be the the unfolding of the mystery of christ in the eternal ages to come science thinks today that they they they say definitively they can't find the borders of of of of of the universe and uh and they even think the universe is probably uh ever expanding to which i've always said good because a never-ending increase of the kingdom of christ is going to need an ever-expanding universe and so you realize friends that this is the real secret to the mystery of god that it's and this is why the trinitarians miss it this is why the oneness misses that's why the two dismiss it it's because they don't understand that it's god in an unfolding expression and so he's always unfolding himself expressing and it so happens now that he's at the stage of expression where there's a he he came and walked the shores of galilee and that was a that was the fullness of the word and a body walking the shores of galilee now god was never intending to stay bottled up in that one body the whole purpose was expanding into a family because that was god's design was to have a family god didn't just create a family as brother lonnie used to teach us so faithfully god became a family and so that's why the trinitarians miss it they they don't get that that whole thing is expression they think that every time there's a a different expression it's a different person and it's not it's just the same person he fills all time space in eternity he is omnipresent by his omniscience because he's all-knowing he's not like the wind he is a being he lives in a house but you understand that he's more than just some mythical something he's actually a very real person and that's why brother branham would say in paradox the person of god became a man and so so so you know when when you when you start to look at it in this in this way you see him now coming he said i'll send the promise of the father upon you because that's part of the plan and now god is going to be able to divide himself into the church and now the expression is going to become a many-membered body where the fullness of the godhead is once again contained but now in the earth but now it's in a many-membered body and that's why brother brannon would say now we have come to the end where we have a complete restoration of that a condition of the alpha church we're back to the abstract deed we're back to the full token we're back to the full word we're back to the mighty god unveiled amen it's all unsealed now god had to seal it up with seven seals because the church fell away they never could come to the change of the body the apostles died off the church began to backslide instead of christ being able to come and take a bride he has to sit back down in the eternities intercede on ignorance seal up the word in seven seals but he promised at the end time i'm going to unseal it the mighty god is going to be revealed and there's going to be a people who will take it eat it and become it and brother branham would say so now it's again we're back to the fullness of the godhead now it's in a many-membered body that brother braddon would actually say you aren't this is a direct quote you're part of god's godhead that's a that's what we call in the south a humdinger that's hard to get your mind around see and and so so a lot of times people they they get tripped up because they think of it in the wrong direction they see jesus as a human and they try to figure out going from that direction starting with the son how is he the father so how are they the same person and i would just say to you today flip it to its correct order because he wasn't a human first he was a spirit first then from there he became a pillar of fire it wasn't a different god same god amen so so rather than say how is the son the father look at it and realize that the father became a human not how is the human god but how is god now a human hallelujah he spoke to a virgin and and hovered over her and brought forth egg and seed and built a body and brother brandon said god crawled into that blood cell and began to push out arms and push out legs yes he was a hundred percent a human being yes he was a hundred percent god almighty that's what makes him a paradox because that's quite impossible but yet it is though it can't be but it is but it can't be but it is though it can't be but it actually is that's the paradox that's the beauty of it and that same god is now so young people what is the message all about why do i come here to this church with my parents why have i heard all my life god sent a prophet that's why because it's god restoring his promise and coming back to the church to restore the token to restore the abstract to take her finally now because this bride has actually got to go beyond the position the alpha church went you've got to go all the way to a body change you've got to actually be changed globally in a moment in a twinkling of an eye and that's never happened globally for god's family so so we're we're going somewhere your purpose your your life has a purpose and so you want to get with that purpose see that's how god that it's it's not like god is you know some twisted up being to say oh if you just kind of do everything i ask you to do i'ma hold a carrot out in front of you and if you just do everything i ask you to do i'm gonna i'm gonna bless you i'm gonna help you and if you mess up no no but if you're really a good boy that's not that's the whole wrong thinking of god you understand god had a purpose founded in love and he has a family and he wants to express himself and he's got a whole world for you to live in this life has never been about this life it's always about the next one coming this life is a proving grounds a training field and and we're we're we're here to to to become the children the royal family of almighty god and the heavens and the worlds to come what a privilege we have i'll get to my notes eventually so so we're we're looking then as i said i want you to look in reverse now because i've already cut to the chase and i've read you what the millennium is going to be like i've already read you because but prior you know you start you go we're going to the new heavens and the new earth of which there's no end and it's a constant expanding of his expression prior to that you have a millennium well between millen between millennium and that you've got the great white throne judgment where every man gets a fair trial every man and so i i i had a cousin who lost a husband some years ago he's only 30 years old don't think youth protects you he walked across the shop floor and fell down dead dead for hit the ground had a widowmaker heart attack at 30. and they weren't they didn't go to church you know they they really didn't and now she knows my cousin knows wow this doesn't bode well because and so she asked my dad because she knew that our family had always presented christ and she said uncle ed she said what about my husband tell me give me some and here's my dad knowing the man you know what what can you say in that moment there's almost no right word to say and my dad gave her the best answer i've ever heard he said teresa honey he said i can promise you this according to the bible he'll get a fair trial and an impartial god will judge him and we'll look in his heart and we'll make a decision and you know something that was okay for her she she took she said okay i can i can take that because she knew that that it would be it would be up to a god who god doesn't wake up in a bad mood thank god thank god we do he doesn't get up on the wrong side of the bed okay and so he he's oh that's i remember brother aaron came to our church one of the last times and so it's never left me i've still got the notes to the sermon and he just took a whole sermon to show definitively constantly definitively no way to get around it after he got finished that all of god's words are true and all of his ways are just all of them you cannot impugn him in any way all of his ways are just and all of his words are true and so that suffice she was content to hear that that every man will get a fair trial and so so we realize then that prior to that is a millennium prior to the millennium is right now there's a tribulation prior to the tribulation there's a bride in the earth amen see she's going to go up before the tribulation but right now the tribulation hasn't set in uh and it's in its full measure under the vials because the bride is still here and so so now we're now we're backing up in scripture we're coming all the way back up to isaiah 61. arise shine thy light has come here's the condition of the world that that group is going to live in darkness will cover the earth and gross darkness will cover the people but there's going to be a work happen there's going to be something take place now prior you say okay well what what what was the what caused isaiah 60 verse 1 to come true and that is found in chapter 59 all right now if we look at chapter 59 and i feel like i'm getting ahead of myself but i'm just having to follow the leadership of the lord because i've got material everywhere and i decided to do it on purpose this way let him lead me at the moment but if you look at chapter 59 behold the lord's hand is not shortened that it cannot save neither his ear heavy that it cannot hear now i promise you what we're about to re read you're going to have so many mental images of the day and hour that you live in everything we're reading here because remember this what you're reading in chapter 59 and this is an important point chapter 59 is showing you the condition of the world when isaiah chapter 60 comes on the scene you get that so isaiah 60 comes on the scene because of what's happening in chapter 59. now look at it together we're not going to read it all behold the the lord's hand is not shortened that it cannot save neither his ear heavy that it cannot hear watch this now but your iniquities have separated between you and god you and your god and your sins have hid his face from you that he will not hear verse 4 none calleth for justice brother branham was talking about that in 1950 he said there's no justice anymore it's all gone see none calleth for justice nor any pleadeth for truth they trust in vanity and speak lies they conceive mischief and bring forth iniquity if that's not the age i live in i don't know it that's that you're reading today's headlines and you're reading it in prophecy thousands of years ago because remember remember you say oh well yeah but this was israel at that time of course but remember for us it correlates to isaiah 60. now we believe we're in isaiah 60. arise shine my light has come do you believe that and it is the rising of the sun do we believe that so we're we're now placing ourselves in the historical timeline that isaiah 60s now so what so now when you're reading isaiah 59 just realize you're reading about what brought forth isaiah 60. there was none calling for justice verse 7 their feet run to evil and they make haste to shed innocent blood my goodness their thoughts i i'm sure i'm not unique i'm sure you're getting mental images of the headlines we see every day their feet run to evil and they make haste to shed innocent blood their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity wasting and destruction or in their past don't forget this had to be because jesus prophesied as it was in the days of noah and men's minds were evil continually all over the world see and so so we realize now you're seeing this come to pass verse 10 now look at look at this at this reference to the condition in sodom we grope for the walls like the blind exactly what happened in the days of lot remember that the the two angels uh which i i i i i hope i'm not gonna get in trouble this is just brother jason i know i know some i know some people say and of course brother branham did and we believe that those two angels that went down there were a type of of uh oral roberts and a billy graham a mod brother and says the modern day version the modern day version of those men it wasn't billy graham and oral roberts in there but the modern day version of them would have been billy graham and oral roberts because that's exactly what they did they blinded the the world to think all i got to do is make a decision all i got to do is have an emotion under oral roberts all i got to do is see the supernatural like oral roberts could do all i got to do is have make a decision a mental decision for christ like billy graham taught and the whole world fell for that now i'm saying those men didn't find their place in christ but i'm simply saying their message has blinded the world to believing to an easy and easy believism that all you have to do is make a mental decision and you're born again all you got to do is have a sensation or be able to demonstrate some supernatural power i'm here to tell you the life of christ is far more than that far more than that friends it's a it's a reality it's a revelation of of almighty god made personal to you how what does that even mean it means that that i have recognized who i am that i'm part of him it's a revelation of him personally to me i see myself in the revelation not just a mental understanding of who he was but who i am and the position i've been brought into in christ that's what the new birth does that's when you realize intrinsically your life is not your own you're not just taught that it becomes your nature see so so we realize now we we grope for the walls like the blind and the point i was going to make is that you have to be careful on the types because you've got to make it fit the book of revelation a lot of people thought that well as soon as billy graham and oral roberts went off the scene then the fire had to fall and they've been gone for years and the fire hasn't fell and that's because to get that portion of the type you have to go to to revelation 11 and you have to see that that's moses and elijah being killed and 144 thousand being martyred and and and the foolish virgin are all martyred revelation 11 15 because then the second woe is over and the third woe cometh quickly that's the tribulation why is that possible because there's now no more god's family in the earth they've all been taken from the earth and there's no more blood and there's no more family and now the tribulation can come in that easy it makes sense to you so so so don't don't get tripped up and think oh well i guess i guess it was all oh nonsense it's not you just have to place it correctly so we grope for the wall verse 10 like the blind and we grope as if we had no eyes we stumble at noonday is in the night and are in desolate places as dead men go to verse 13 in transgressing now watch these next uh four verses real close verse 13 in transgressing and lying against the lord my do we see that today that's really don't read ahead of me but that's really where i'm the real burden on my heart is that somebody's got to contend with the lie that's being told about god the lie that's being told that this is what god is like this is how you please him this is how you get born again and there's a big lie the greatest existential threat to humanity is not north korea or china or russia it's denominationalism that is the greatest existential threat that humanity faces that's the big lie because denominationalism leads you to the mark of the beast and in the mark of the beast you don't come back from that there's no recovering from that amen so in transgressing and lying against the lord and departing from our god speaking oppression and revolt conceiving and uttering from the heart words of falsehood and judgment is look at this judgment is turned away backward and justice standeth afar off for truth is fallen in the street and equity cannot enter yea truth faileth and he that departeth from evil maketh himself a prey and the lord saw it and it displeased him that there was no judgment now you're coming to isaiah 60. now god's starting to get involved watch and he saw that there was no man and wondered that there was no intercessor see therefore his arm brought salvation unto him and his righteousness it sustained him see this is the time where the church goes into total darkness the church is no longer his voice remember that she becomes her own voice she kicks christ out amen remember that the sun remember under the trumpets the sun doesn't shine the stars the moon and and brother branham shows us in in revelation teaching on revelation that that that now they kicked christ out and the moon the church is no longer giving off his light and the stars sons of god sit in churches but their lives are no different from the rest of the world amen and so so you realize this is what's happening god sees there's no more justice the church has kicked me out there's nobody to declare the truth anymore and so god begins to say i gotta go do something about this now watch and and he saw that there was no man and wondered that there was no intercessor see they they they don't even have access now they've they've brother branham said the church cannot go in the rapture in its condition and as if that wasn't bad enough it gets worse he said and it can't get any better you can't get worse than that you can't go in a rapture like you are you can't improve why because you kept christ out the only one who could make you better and so he says there he saw there was no man and wondered that there was no intercessor see now all access to the token is being lost in the earth therefore his arm brought salvation to him why would he do that because he had already promised himself a bride hallelujah and if the church wouldn't be that then he would send a prophet and draw a people out of the church that's what you're a part of here today it's not just i come to a church my parents make me come here i've heard about elijah probably no friends this is far bigger than that this is prophecy unfolding in real time happening around you and his righteousness has sustained him for he put on righteousness that breastplate and a helmet of salvation upon his head he put on the garments of vengeance for clothing and was clad with zeal as a cloak see now watch the tribulation's getting ready to come verse 18 according to their deeds accordingly he will repay uh fury to his adversaries recompense to his enemies to the isle to the islands he will repay recompense so shall they fear the name of the lord from the west and his glory from the rising of the sun now watch verse isaiah 60 just a verse or two away this is what's happening there's a glory coming from the west at the rising of the sun when the enemy shall come in like a flood the spirit of the lord shall lift a standard against him and the redeemer shall come to zion see and unto them that turn from transgression in jacob saith the lord now that's the same as isaiah 4 and brother branham picks that up i i have the quotes but i'm not going to take the time to read it today but when you go back to isaiah 4 you find zion and the jews so brother branham said zion is always the bride and and then it's jerusalem includes the jews so now it's his gentile bride and when the gentile bread leaves the earth the eagle anointing lifts flies east picks up two prophets goes to the 144 thousand amen and then and then in revelation 11 after 14 they they kill them they lie in the streets but on the third day they're resurrected and they're all brought up you see them again you see them in in revelation 15 standing you see those standing with the song of moses the the 144 thousand you see those standing with the song of the lamb that's the unwise virgin who don't get to go into the millennium say well why are they both in the same verse why why did the 144 thousand get to go up but the but the foolish virgin don't because the 144 000 received this same message they received this same ego anointing they received this same token they received this same new birth this very message that you're rejoicing over today they're going to rejoice over it friends the foolish virgin missed the millennium because they rejected the message which was a bleeding word to cleanse their sins they had a testimony of christ but they refused the bleeding word but because you're the the word is what washes us clean it is the word that brings perfect faith amen it's the word that's helped to all your flesh amen so faith comes by hearing in the word so you want rapturing faith three people you want rapturing faith how would you get it without a rapturing word because faith comes by hearing the word see so so so you find then that brother branham says it's not so here's the same thing in isaiah 59 you've got zion the bride and you've that turn from transgression and jacob so now you've got again the same picture that brother branham deals with i might i might give you the reference to the quote i have it in my notes but this is the this is the backdrop of isaiah 60. the world has gone into this condition and it didn't happen accidentally you see when when you okay i'm just gonna try to jump i i'm i'm not really i'm a little bit in my notes that reference is the future home if you want that the future home of the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly bride brother branham talks about isaiah 4 verse 5 and in that day seven women shall take a hold of one man you're familiar with that saying we'll eat our own bread where on apparel let us be called by thy name take away our reproach and brother branham said that's the end time see isaiah 4 is the end time we're living now marriage divorce prostitution whatever see it's interesting brother dale smith was telling me but then i were talking about this how brother dale did a study to show that the divorce rates in the united states stayed at less than one percent for for a hundred for more than a hundred years they started tracking it in the 1800s and started bringing it forward and it stayed at like 0.0746 and then right after the turn of the century it kind of went to zero point one four nine two still less than one percent and by the time it got to world war two and there's where brother branham picks that up brother man says by the time it got to world war two it went vertical it was straight up and brother brown talks about how that that so much percentage of the boys who went to fight got dear john letters within the first six months and do you know when it peaked do you know when marriage and divorce do you know when divorce peaked in the united states 1977 it reached its zenith and then it started to decline you know why because they stopped getting married they just didn't get married so the so the divorce rate started falling because people are just living together now and and and now the the whole destruction of the nuclear family is even being desecrated i mean the the whole world is in sick insanity it's in the sickness of the mind that isaiah 59 tells you they're like blind men walking around and there's no justice there's no intercessor the church has kicked christ out and god looked upon that and said but i've got a bride i've got a heaven i've got a family i got names on the book and so he clothed himself hallelujah he took on zeal and put on a cloak of righteousness and he said i will come down and what has happened from the rising of the sun the glory will come from the west and arise shine bride thy light has come this is going to lead you to the millennium and the millennium will lead you to the new heavens and the new earth this is the reality that we're facing now now you can see that if when you when you i love studying i love preaching the book of revelation because that's really the bride's book it is truly makes for fantastic bible study and so i've i've been actually in a in a bible study where where it's a call-in goes all over the country to the west coast up into canada and everywhere different places people are catching it myself and a team of other brothers we've been doing a verse by verse study on the entire book of revelation be releasing it soon uh in in a in a uh in a study guide not here to sell that does not for sale at all but but we're just studying it and it is the bride's book because i mean it's you don't even find paul quoting from it because paul is already gone john comes back john's last one to die so he comes back from the island and you don't even find commentators commenting on the book of revelation until you get into the early writings of the nicean fathers and irenaeus starts commenting and different ones start commenting on it but but it's a it's a book for the bride of the last day because it's going to it's it's going to give her you know uh a synopsis and even a a breakdown of of everything that's happened that's why brother branham would say you know the the the after the first three chapters it's a revelation of jesus christ it's god working down in the seven lampstands getting a bride through seven church ages and at the end of chapter three the bride goes up and the gospel goes to israel and you don't see the bride again until revelation 19 and that's 100 accurate from from from after chapter three the whole book is to israel and and so you say wait a minute what what about chapter five and brother brandon preached that in the breach in chapter 10 and that's the mighty angel and there's revelation 10 7 and a bride eating the book and and what about all of that of course see there's where brother branham said that's that little interval that's what the theologians are missing they can look at the book and go the bride leaves in chapter three now the book is to israel and what they're what they're missing they're missing that little interval of time that god would come down between the sixth and seventh seal and sixth and seventh trumpet and he would send down elijah into the earth and redeem a bride call her out of a church a church called out of a church and that's what they don't see and that's why brother branham said chapter five he's showing you he took the bride up in chapter three now chapter five and chapter four by extension because they're the same event he's showing how he pulled it off oh my the mighty god moved among us at the end time and what did he do we see chapter 5 open up and the scene opens up in heaven and a strong angel is there and john is representing the bride and he cries out whose word they let him take the book and john is weeping until a theophany says to him don't weep john it's all good jesus is one and there's a message to come and you're part of a great movement and then john said oh i was rejoicing and everybody heard me screaming and shouting that's why we rejoice and scream and shout because we realize our names were on that book and we see ourselves perfected we see ourselves when when you when you when you you look into revelation 8 1 and you see that silence in heaven so what's what's happening in the seventh seal is god revealing the mighty god unveiled catches a prophet if you go back and you distract you and it's not hard it's not complicated you know to to to teenagers i would say listen oh it is it's mostly history when you look at the ages you're seeing a lot of history and the prophet just placed it all and and you see the history say what's the value of that one value is to show you history wasn't an accident the monarchs and kings of the world thought they were making decisions they don't know they were just puppets they were just following god already prophesied what would happen in their history before they were ever born thousands of years before they came on the earth and did and did that what we now call history jesus prophesied of it in his earthly ministry and and and so you find the seals overlaid because each of those historical ages had an anointing from a seal that came upon it and we all know it's elementary to us that white horse rider and a red horse rider and a black horse rider and a pale horse rider coming at the end and there's a lion and there's an ox and there's a man and there's an eagle and each one the the the lion rises up to meet the white horse and the the the ox rises up to meet the red horse and the man the wisdom of man rises up to meet the black the black horse and then the pale horse is a conglomeration of all three and the eagle anointing is a conglomeration of all those previous it's all of the lion and all of the ox and all of the man and and now it has a special anointing on this hour to do what has never been done to god's family that's where we are see and the trumpets are just the same thing for israel just tracking them through history that's why brother branham didn't take a lot of time on he said it's just to israel it's not even to us but we were involved in the history of it part of those trumpets is world war one world war ii a lot of gentiles died in world war one and world war ii so you understand all it is is a weaving of history and it hits flawlessly flawlessly you go back and look at it and and remember the that the trumpets and the vials you say oh goodness it's really going to complicate it no it doesn't all it is is the trumpets are partial judgment and working in history that's why it would say this trumpet sounded this angel sounded this trumpet and a third of this died and a third of this a third just means temporary now that's what brother branham taught us in the seals said that a messenger caught it ran with it people gathered and then then the rejection god took his messenger home dropped a temporary judgment on the earth moved to the next stage sent another star gathered a messenger took a message people gathered around it got a rejection took him home temporary judgment moved to the next age easy right it's not hard it's not hard to just keep it all straight and and so so you've got temporary judgments that's why when it that's why brother brandon would show us when it come under okay you you just take let's just start maybe with the with the third with the third uh trumpet these are historical acts on israel god dealing with israel but they're in the earth so a lot of times gentiles get caught up in it and you see a star fall from heaven his name is wormwood and there's a temporary judgment a third of this and a third of that and then it goes to the fourth trumpet and then this begins to happen and then it comes to the fifth trumpet and all of these things all they are is history they were prophecy until they were history and so that's what happened like on sunset mountain it became a setting of history a setting of prophecy see and that's what happened and you you you have a you have a fifth angel sounding and now another star falls from heaven but this time brother branham ties that star back to isaiah that how art thou fallen from heaven o lucifer's son of the morning so now he's falling down to get a key to the bottomless pit and open the bottomless pit brother branham says that's satan so you find that that in history in our recent history that right around the turn of the century you find this star falling satan is now given some extra power to come down and unlock a bottomless pit and release things into the world that have been held oh my friends this stuff didn't happen accidentally and and now now you've you you've got sin running through the world under the fourth trumpet and under the fifth trumpet and sin is getting worse and that's why what we read in isaiah when the enemy comes in like a flood god raises the standard and so if god is going to allow that fifth trumpet to drop down around the turn of the century then he's also going to have some brothers on azusa street in california and he's going to bring a revival of the pentecostal church because the enemy is gaining power god's got to give his bride power oh my friends these things you can't make it up it's not accidents i'm trying to tell you young people the history that you read about in the books god purposed it all and you're here now and prophecy is unfolding in real time and you're in it you're in the big middle of it it's happening around you don't don't be asleep at the switch it's happening rapidly judgment's rising to meet us the only way up is the only way out is up see sure he comes under the fifth trumpet and what is he gonna do you're you're you're gonna find this key to the bottomless pit now this is right at the time of the first woes because he prophesies there's three woes coming woe to the earth you think it's bad now wait till these three woes start and the world war one's gonna come just after the opening of the century just after the fourth third and fourth trumpet sounds fifth trumpet sounds bottomless pit is open what does it do what does it do it it releases a power in the earth and what do you find happening you suddenly you find a crazy man in austria and he's gonna assassinate ferdinand and that's gonna that's gonna be the catalyst to kick off world war one that was demon powers got released starting to torment the earth and and you notice you notice how that the the scorpions came out and they had a king over them whose name was apollyon remember that so this is clearly the devil and you find that they had you know teeth like lions and breastplates and and brother branham said they had hair the bible says they had hair long hair like women and brother brown says that was to torment the women who had cut theirs off and the hair bob women first began to bob their hair around 1912. you think that's an accident that's the key to the bottomless pit spinner the key the pit's been unloosed and demon powers like scorpions and what's happening what's happening right after there war one and why is it why is it tormenting the women who bob their hair because they're gonna suffer the loss of sons and husbands and it's going to go into the first woe makes sense it makes sense it's not hard to follow and and and then the first woe comes and then right after that the first one was passed and two more woes come the bible says and then what happens the sixth trumpet comes and strikes euphrates and releases 200 million demons and what do they do go after hitler and eichmann because the first wall only took israel and drove them out got him out from under the ottoman empire but they just piled up in central europe and started taking over there but god had to get them home because his word had promised him a promised land and moses and elijah weren't coming to europe they were coming to palestine and so under the sixth trumpet he releases the euphrates demons and they go after hitler and eichmann stalin all them and a persecution of the jews to drive him out of europe back into the homeland oh hallelujah friends and now between that sixth trumpet and the seventh trumpet which reveals christ to the jews there was an interval of time that elijah the prophet had to come on the scene hallelujah you think that's an accident when the fifth trumpet is sounding and the and the pentecostal revival is breaking and the demon powers are being released from the bottomless pit and it's happening in europe and world war one is coming god has a little boy under a tree and he's speaking to him don't ever drink or smoke or defile your body when you get older i gotta work for you to do oh this is prophecy friends it's unfolding it's happening we're we're part of that today because that bride goes home and she's gone chapter 10 takes her see and so we we find then that he's going to turn to moses and elijah now can i get to my notes now that was all just background i just need 15 minutes okay we'll hit a pause button we'll pick it up this afternoon so so we find then that where we're establishing in our hearts that life as we've known it has been driven by prophecy there it's not been driven by politics see it's not being driven by the devil he's a puppet god is allowing him god oh god gave him the key to the bottomless pit to unlock it amen because it's all happening in perfect synchronous harmony you can track it you can see prophecy overlaying with history and it hits to right to a t and so so we find then that that this all correlates with history under the trumpets and the seals the seals are mainly dealing it is only dealing with the gentiles and but it but of course the jews are here in the world it's going to affect them too and the trumpets are dealing with the jews but of course the gentiles are here and so we're caught up in world war one world war ii see and so the second woe actually goes all the way through uh the end of uh revelation 11 14. the bible says the second was ended he said wait a minute i thought the shooting war well world war ii was the second woe that world war ii was a consequence of the second woe it was a byproduct of it it was it was an effect the shooting were stopped i mean you say we wait a minute we had v-day i told my church i reminded him i said i saw the picture of the of the marine kissing the nurse in times square we had v-day in japan and and i thought the shooting war stopped sure it did but remember the second woe carries on all the way to the death of the prophets to the death of moses and elijah because men who fought in iwo jima men who crossed the rhine in germany were just a few years later fighting in korean peninsula see remember brother branham told his church he said now he said how many in here back in the day how many of you old timers he said you remember back in the day when i told you these visions in the early 1930s and he says you know how many old-timers remember i told you if you ever see mussolini head go to ethiopia you'll know there'll be no more peace from that point until jesus comes in the millennium and the world since that time since those woes have begun to break out because jesus said there would be nation rise against nation but this was now going to be global this was going to be world war and and and you don't find any peace those world war ii soldiers are fighting in korea and then their sons are fighting in vietnam and then their sons are invading grenada and panama and their sons are fighting in kosovo and their sons are fighting in the gulf war and then their sons are fighting in afghanistan you understand that there's children born in the united states now who have never known america not at war you see there is no peace till jesus comes the woes have already started and the second woe finally runs itself out when the prophets are taken and it says now the third woe cometh quickly why because all of god's family's gone and the armageddon can now set in on the earth oh you don't want to be here friends you don't want to be here during that time you're here today to escape that hallelujah i'm glad we got a word that gives us the ability to escape it and so so so we we come now to to this to this terminology and hence my title the purpose of god's church in the earth paul only refers to one church as the church of god and that's the church of corinth he calls them paul called to be an apostle of jesus christ through the will of god and so socialness our brother unto the church of god which is at corinth now he there's references to the church of god you know paul said i persecuted the church of god and you know he makes loose references but all the other churches he would say unto the saints which be here unto the called and chosen unto under these unto these i right unto thee but only here in corinth maybe and i'm and i'm not here to get to i've been preaching a little series on at home not here to get into the trenches of that today but you know i think that one of the things that that is relevant that we should talk about today is that you know corinth was a troubled troubled group had a terribly conflicted relationship with the truth and with purity there's secret sin going on and even the church is winking at it you see you don't ever want to be a part of a church like that that winks at ungodliness we are called to be sons and daughters of god amen amen and so so we we find that paul felt by them like they were his children even says that that they're like children to him and he loved them he loved the church of corinth and he spent a lot of time trying to help them with their human frailties and weaknesses we all got them don't we but they seem to have needed reminder of who they were and i think that that's a lesson to us that that i think we need to constantly be reminded who you are you're not just a group meeting in a hotel conference room you're the church of god now not the denominational name all they did was take a name onto a building and that became a blasphemous name actually became a name of blasphemy but the church of god is not a name on a building because paul begins to uh we we can observe here in verses one and two of first corinthians one that he says to them that are sanctified in christ called to be saints so there's our first two clues who's he talking to what is the church of god supposed to be a collection of people just or is it those who are who are called to be the church of god who are sanctified in jesus and called in and being called the church of god they're called to be saints see and so so now now we come to this important point because this is a big point that there is there is a great misunderstanding in the minds of the christian world here in the modern day as to what is implied when we use the term the church of god there is there's there's only one qualified voice in the earth that can speak authoritatively only one qualified voice in the earth to interpret what this phrase means the church of god and that's not true because it's the last day and william branham came and we're the bride that's always been true that's always been true from the first voice to the first age of fallen man which was abel in the book of genesis and immediately cain is rejecting his message from the first voice to the first age to the final voice to the final age there's only that voice which is the family of god only the family of god from abel in genesis to the bride going home in revelation there's only one authoritative voice to interpret what is the church of god see it's always been true outside i want to make a couple of statements outside of the voice of god's family down through history outside of god's voice down through history all other voices all along the way to now and there have been plenty of them amen balaam rose up with a voice cora rose up with a voice amen there's been all cain rose up with a voice there's been all kinds of voices rising up trying to interpret god to the world but we find out that outside of god's representative family sent to the earth in time all other voices are laced with varying degrees of greater and lesser degrees of manmade ideology and now here here's here's a point to be made it's all been crafted and very carefully sculpted by god so so that by the time we reach the final junction of the fall that's where we are we're at the final junction the next move is millennium the final junction of the fall of of god's family and living in a world man's 6 000 year train of living in a fallen condition is over and god's about to recycle and transition us into the millennium and that the curse will be lifted from the earth and we'll inherit new glorified bodies i'm here to tell you the history of fallen man is coming to an end we read it in isaiah 60 he's going to do away with all of that stuff righteousness will rule the world and so the last day bride have the full measure of the word and the word only and that is to say that she has no man-made contaminants nothing mingled of man-made ideology are mingled in the message of the hour she's been given now thus saith the lord zion the bride as brother branham said zion is always the bride zion would have thus saith the lord or she would keep still in other words we don't teach anything but the revealed word we we if we're not teaching the revealed word we have nothing to say amen amen so that we neither teach nor do we live by the contaminated standards of the world we don't live by that because their understanding of what it means to be a christian is contaminated we don't follow that we are the real version see so it is the primary purpose then of the light we hold to shine that light to a dying world in the midst of the darkest history of humankind now we've come from isaiah 59 and we're in isaiah 60 and we've got the promise of a millennium coming and a new world coming and god's going to wrap the whole thing up but right here and right now we're in between what has been and what is coming and our greatest purpose for being here is arise shine because the glory shall come from the west at the rising of the sun because god saw that there was no man no intercessor that the church had kicked him out they'd cut themselves off from being born again and so he come down oh my god christ comes descending in revelation 10 to do what to bring an open book to us what is the open book it's christ it's not a mysteries and symbols and the interpretation it's not doctrine the message isn't doctrine the message is in books and tapes and quotes the message is the person and the books and tapes and quotes are just the vehicle it's a person of christ that we're eating upon and you are you're becoming what you eat we're being changed from glory to glory from glory to glory it's changing us see and so the church then is a fellowship of saints in the earth who who collectively share this common purpose to be representatives of god's kingdom in heaven that's you say why did brother aaron start a church this is why why are we gathering here now oh we got a nice place to go no this is why here's why you're gathering here's why you gather it all here's why the burden came on a man's heart here's why you you start to gather what is a church the church is a fellowship of saints in the earth who collectively share a common purpose what's our common purpose to be representatives in the earth to be representatives of god's kingdom in heaven that's why we're here that's what the church is hallelujah our are we so so this puts us now as sons and daughters of the king this puts us now i mean listen friends our our life isn't some some new blockbuster movie where they got some new superhero our life is not some marvel comic book of the latest superhero there are superheroes in the world but they're the sons and daughters of god who are impervious to demon power who have authority over sin the world the devil and the flesh that's what the word has brought to us in this hour our off-world headquarters isn't some it's real but it's not on some distant star it's in another dimension right among us oh our deployment is real friends it's prophecy unfolding in real time all around us you don't want to lose sight of that it has a very defined and determinate end game this thing is being driven with precision there are no accidents coveted wasn't an accident this church being here is not an accident you sitting here today is not an accident you're there there's literally an anointing brother branham said when a seal is open there's a there's a message bound inside the seal and he said when the seal is broken the message is dropped into the earth and he said then down comes an anointing falls upon that word to make it live and mechanics become dynamics how many want to be that today see and so you happen to be living young people i i've stood up here and used up most of my time just to qualify you for where you are just to show you where you are in history to show you what has been what is and what will be and there's a lot more we can say we just barely scratched the surface of it see but but but it's uh you're you're you're living during the time you are the generation upon whom the ends of the world have come as i said earlier you happen to be living during the ending the ending time of mankind's 6 000 year journey in a fallen condition all the history you read about and all the books have all been to get to here can you get your mind around that all the history and all the books that you've ever read was all a purpose-driven history controlled by prophecy to get to now you have arrived there's a people of the book whose lives came from god whose lives are purposed by god living out a plan from god he's coming to zion and so i would say to you today wake up zion thy king approaches wake up zion thy king approaches why is he coming he's coming to finish this he's not stuck in isaiah 60 verse 1. he's coming to the end of isaiah 60. he's coming to finish this hallelujah you were elected before the foundation of the world to be dropped right in the big middle of it all brother branham made this statement in the church age book he said i wonder if we are sufficiently impressed with the word in our midst you see friends there are millions of people in the world today because of the blindness of the sodom messengers there's millions of people who take the name of christian but they're coming up short of redemption their their even their only chance to even get in heaven will be to go through a tribulation give their life and be judged at a judgment bar that's even only chance they've got because when you when you say the church of god now this word is theos in the greek church of god i'm i'm really closing i'm on my last page the this church of god this theos you need to understand a little bit of the background of this usage of theos to the new testament church because originally this same term theos was used by all the heathen nations but it was it was indicating their gods which we know to be false gods there has only ever been one true god you understand that so so this was the purpose of israel if you'll notice god dropped israel down right in the middle of heathenism every nation around them was heathen coming from the flood they had all turned heathen and god put israel pink right in a little track of land and set david up on the throne to do what to be a beacon of who the true god is you philistines you you you canaanites you've been worshipping i know you've been using this name god but you've been worshipping of false gods there's only one god and we're here to demonstrate now that's where israel failed their whole purpose was to be that lighthouse dropped in the middle to show the world who god really was and what he really required and now we've come full circle at the end time friends why are you here in when why would god leave you here in a time of darkness that covers the whole earth and men's minds in gross darkness why because it's a repeat he's bro he's brought a rise shine shine shine thy light has come now shine i've deposited you in the middle of a dark world who thinks they understand what christianity means who thinks they understand who god is they think they understand what is the requirement from christ after when they have heard about his death burial and resurrection they have a misunderstanding they're going to miss the rapture they're going to end up in a tribulation many of them are going to end up in matthew 25 and he'll say depart from me you workers of iniquity and they're going to say but we went to church and we built orbiting jesus and we did all these things in your name and he's going to say but you did it and iniquity it doesn't count how are they going to know if you're not shining the light the whole world has a grievous misunderstanding of what it means our lives here friends are to be guiding examples to guide others from the heathenism and misunderstanding of what the true living god is and what the true word is this is why today i said i really wanted to speak to the young people because listen friends it's up to you to make clear who the true god is what he's really like not the misunderstanding the world has but you're here to demonstrate his true characteristics families and homes and marriages and teenagers old people young people male female our whole life if you've got a if you've got a godly home you know what the purpose of that godly home to show all the people with ungodly homes what a real godly home is you've got a godly church to show the rest of the ungodly churches what a real godly church is you've got teenagers filled with the holy ghost to show the teenagers of the world who are stripping themselves off and doing every kind of vulgar thing and and going to the funerals of their movie stars and their basketball stars and saying i'm sure he's looking down i'm sure she's looking down i'm sorry she's not he's not they're looking up screaming you know why you know why they say that at their funerals because that's what they believe they have a complete misunderstanding of what righteousness requires and there's no way for them to know it unless the body of christ and the earth declares it and that's the challenge of the hour to correct the false narrative the world is fed from modern christian pulpits this false narrative about what god is to set the record straight of what it means to be a christian not in word only but in power and in demonstration of the holy ghost pause stand stand god bless you let's have our musicians come by there and you get ready to come back and we're just going to hit a pause button we'll carry on this afternoon by the will of the lord i don't fully know what second part two holds but i know who holds it and i i i've i've got some things that are on my heart but it'll be up to if god wants it delivered or not he's he i come with plenty of notes you never run out of something to say and i've got a burden on my heart something i really would like to bring so will you pray for me amen we'd like to carry on four day do you feel challenged today friends you understand my my goal today was just to lay some basic fundamentals just some basics to to show you wow i didn't just end up here i'm not just going through life trying to figure it out your whole life is determinant your whole life has a purpose i don't care what's happened to you everything that's happened to you has been under the control of god you say oh you know the bad the good the bad the ugly whatever listen friends brother branham said jesus christ is in every verse of the bible now i used to puzzle over that because i would and brother adam said if you can't read him in every verse of the bible you missed him go back read it again and i would i'd be fine when i was reading about opening the red sea sure it was all no problem when elisha floated an axe head on water and made it swim to him and they think they've got the force they don't know nothing about the force elisha working the force thousands of years ago float an axe head and make it swim [Music] i had no problem reading christ in that but then i came to the sin i came to david's horrible thing i came to the to the failures of god's great servants and the failures of god's people the failures of samson how do i how do i read christ in that the failure of judah goes into a city takes a prostitute doesn't know it's his daughter-in-law comes back ready to burn she she reveals and judah at least he was man enough to own it he said you know she's been more righteous than me how do you read christ into that and i was studying that one day and i said lord you never did any of those things and the lord just spoke back to me and said yes but you did and i took your sin i became guilty so you could become innocent and brother branham said he who knew no sin became sin and i want to tell you something you might can't read jesus and the failures of those people but i can read me you can read you and christ took that sin and brother branham said god judged him as a sinner and sent him to hell you know why so you'd never have to go teenager that's why god sent him to hell so you would never have to go there amen let's bow our heads father we thank you for your word today and i feel satisfied in my spirit lord that you've said what you wanted to say and i'm happy to stand here today feeling that contentment i'm always checking always looking within lord when i come to the end of a sermon and i feel that contentment and that peace now i can close i think though the arrow of deliverance has found its mark in the hearts of men and women here today because they can they can see you more clearly they can see how just how involved you've been and in seeing you more clearly they see themselves when christ was unsealed the bride was unsealed that's that's the mystery that the the christian church is missing that's why they that's why the trinitarian doctrine is so short-sighted that's why the oneness doctrine is so short-sighted they miss the body of christ being part of that godhead they missed the expression of his divine mate his eternal mate that he that were that was purposed in christ before the world began we've seen you in seeing you we've seen us we've seen you moving and now we realize we need to be moving we see you've been in control all along and nothing has your control and we can't understand all of our lives we can't understand our failures and our sins we can't understand the things that have happened to us sometimes we wrecked our own selves sometimes others wrecked us but regardless of that lord you never lost sight of us you never had you never lost control you always had your hand you always had angels following you stalked us until
