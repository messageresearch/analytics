TRANSCRIPT
========================================
so um last or on Sunday we were speaking on um uh power or authority without character it's satanic and it's a quote that brother brandham uh it's a really good quote it's one of those things that I've learned that I need to use in my daily life it's not something so far away something so deep that I can't just put it in my back pocket but I can apply it in my daily life every single day that that um God has has placed the bride a Christian a child of God with an authority with a position and Jesus said even before the disciples were even born again he said you are the light of the world so that's a great position this you're not just the light of your own family you're not the light of a little tiny group you are the light of the world so that is something that God has placed in us and and we see that that um The Authority without the character backing it up it becomes satanic and we see that with Satan how how he saw the image of God he saw the likeness or to be like God it was it was a skewed way of looking at it he said I want to be like God and he wanted everything he wanted the authority he wanted the position he wanted the greatness and the glory without having the character of God with within himself and I begin to think about um of what is the goal of of a Christian development the growth of a Christian because that's what we're uh aspiring to be is to be like God to be more like him and and um and we we grow every single day and why is there that necessity of development or or where does it lead us to and and we see that if we're not careful what we do with this development process that brother brandham has laid out for us and the word has laid out for us what we do is that that becomes degrees or or steps to our Salvation right so so different degrees of if you don't do this or if you do this and you do this then you can attain your salvation but but the word clearly tells us when you are saved you are saved when you received the Holy Spirit you are in the body already you have already been glorified when you have been Justified so so there there you have been saved but but a lot of times what we try to do you know in our human mind we've seen it many times is we'll take those development stages and say well hey if you don't have this you're not saved or if you're not here you haven't ascended to a higher degree of salvation but but it when you are saved then there is a development process that's what it is it's it's when we're saved now God can mold us into that perfect image of God and and we see that in Genesis 1 126 where where this is the the ultimate here this is what we're trying to be what we're trying to every single day live up to it says and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and he also says which this is very important he says and let them have dominion over the fish um over the fish of the sea over the fowl of the air over the cattle and over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth so God's last and his greatest creation was man and women in His image that that was the the ultimate he had 6,000 years or 6 days however you want to see it that way but in the end his ultimate was I need a creature that can behold my very image my very likeness and whenever he reached that ultimate see that is our goal Brothers our goal is to be like him to be like God to have his image to be in his likeness and whenever that had been achieved in in the Garden of Eden the Bible says that he rested that means that it's done he has reached what what he wanted from the creature and there is no creation no thing that has been created that has been made into the image of God no Beast no animal we don't see anything that was made to Bear God's image the image of God it's it's not physical if I could say it this way it's not this might sound wrong but it's not Supernatural or it's not Angelic it it's invisible you there there is no substance to it so so how is Man created in the image of God when it's it's beyond our sense of of of visibility and matter and touch and tangibility how is it he created something that that we cannot see it's beyond that what what makes or what a person does I is is they they try to make a mental picture of this uh image of God and it's hard you can't mentally picture it and and and what what we see a lot of times is is we see oh well we are the image of God and what happens is we almost reverse it and we say God is in the image of man now right and say oh we are the image of God and and we look at the suits and we look at how our churches are and we look at denominations and we look at at certain doctrines and we see now this is the image of God and what we're doing is we're making the image of man God so we're reversing it when the image of God wasn't this because in the second chapter it shows that he formed Man Out of the Dust of the earth that that when man was formed in the dust of the earth he was in the image of beasts he was in the image of the earth earthy so whatever this image was we can't we can't duplicate it amen I believe that's what Satan tried to do I honestly believe that's what Satan tried to do and in Romans 1:23 it's showing how men corrupted that image it says and changed the glory of The Incorruptible God into image made like unto corrup corruptible man and birds and four-footed Beast and creeping things what was it they were making Idols they created their own own form of God and say this is our God whether it was a a thought a religion a Doctrine or a person we could make people into the image of God and it's not it's not saying well this person is has the image or is the image of God but we begin to put that God is in that image of that man power what is this image of God um in in the Hebrew it's imod day man has been created with the capacity to reflect and to mirror the character of God that is his image no other creature can do that let us create man in our image what was it I'm going to have him bear my nature amen bear my character something that nothing else could do and in Hebrews 13 um the the scripture that we we read it says that Jesus he was the brightness of his glory the expressed image of his person now the word the Greek word here only shows up once in this in the Bible here the expressed image and that is the word character that is the Greek word character and it means a Graver or a tool or even a person an engraving something that is stamped or a stamping process um they they it says that when uh Greek Artisans they carved classical figures out of block blocks of marble they used a series of sculpting tools one of these was known as a character this tool was was used to Chisel into the marble and stamp the sculptor's name or distinctive Mark into the finished product so that is where character comes from and it says that gradually however the word broadened in its meaning and itcl it not only included the tool used but the tooling process from beginning to end so it it that the character is what molds the image the word came to represent a formation process by which the marble was shaped by the Creator and ultimately marked and stamped by his hands as the word evolved Through the Ages the word character began to refer as an a distinctive Mark token or feature then in early 16th century the word came to describe a person's distinguishing qualities and and now we know like what character and what how people use the word character but but it was it was a a a marble chiseled to create an image brother brandham he says in the the message the Masterpiece he says and then in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was hewed out and reflected what the word was in the beginning him the word reflected in the mass Masterpiece in his own likeness God back um back again in his own likeness the word form being reflected in the image of a man the Masterpiece so when God created Adam and Eve or when God created man in his likeness he created His Image which was his character that's what it was and brother brandham when he starts that message Masterpiece he talks about the image of God that's the first thing he begins to talk about after he reads these scriptures he says how he began to create his Masterpiece in the image of God in his own image that is the image of God now on the other hand where the scripture says that that Satan he was made perfect now there is no other scripture that shows a creature that was made perfect you can't see it of course you you we can look into it Jesus was perfect but he was not a created being but here the Bible says that you were created perfect but in his perer Perfection or his beauty that was that it was an outward appearance and that outward Perfection or that outward Beauty it caused him to want to be like God it wanted him to to uh uphold an authority uphold something but his Beauty his Perfection was wanted him to be like God but when man and women they are created in the image of God the Bible says we weren't created perfect but the Bible says we were created like him and and this this image it's not a Perfection of outward Beauty like Lucifer but when he created us it was something inwardly that our flesh it could never attain our flesh it can never aspire to those things it has to be a supernatural work of God this character we we we want to be like God and we want to have his character but we need a supernatural experience him he was always partly and almost but we are like him we are in the image of him now now I I like how God does these things he says let us make man in our own image now we know that brother Bram he says that was his character that was his qualities and and right after that after he created them in the image then he said let them have dominion and this showing that your character is your qualification for your Dominion amen so first before you have leadership before there is the power or that that Authority the character has to take place so he said let them have the image of me my character now they can have the power or that Authority good so we see that in in uh in Genesis 1 127 there brother Bram he says in the Masterpiece he says now before I go into this so they had this Dominion then he rested and here he's showing how the Masterpiece fell he says while he was resting and trusting to his Masterpiece his enemy come in and found and found this Great Masterpiece and he by deceit he crawls under the garden walls and then he marred this beautiful Masterpiece he marred it so that it fell Satan he gave Eve a false conception of what to be like God is he gave even though she was already like God maybe he had an outward appearance he had a a thought of what he wanted as God and he be to project to her he be to project and he said this is the way you be like God even though her her character even her image was already like God and he and she was deceived because of it and when she accepted it she conceived and she birthed the seed now you you got you have to understand these people were in the image of God brother bradam says that Masterpiece was marred we know what happened she birthed a seed that had satanic Char characteristics and that's where the image of God it became marred the Masterpiece fell now we have all these the the characteristics of of being murderers and haters and and all of these evil things that uh in reality we find in ourselves those one of those things that need to be be chiseled out of us every single day now we see it in the human race brother brandham he says this in the exposition of the seven Church ages the Ephesian Church age and he lays it out perfectly here he says but God has revealed or reserved to himself that right he's talking about indwelling in man Satan cannot do that God Alone appeared in human flesh Satan could not do that he does not have creative Powers the only way for uh for Satan to accomplish what he wanted was to enter into the serpent in Eden even as the evil um as even as he entered by evil spirits into the swine of GAD God does not enter into animals but Satan can and will to accomplish his ends he could have not had a child directly by Eve as as God did by Mary so he entered into the serpent he beguiled Eve he seduced her by by her um seduced her and by her did San have a child vicariously Cain bore the full spiritual characteristics of Satan an animalistic censal fleshly characteristic of the serpent no wonder the holy spirit said that Cain was of that Wicked one he was now something that that stood out to me he had the spiritual characteristics of Satan and then he had the fleshly characteristics the animalistic characteristics of the serpent and and we see that that Adam and Eve were kicked out of the the Garden of Eden well that's where eternal life sat at that's where God's full presence was that and and he separated them brother bandam said that he he formed a Chasm between them he separated them and he said that that if he ever if anybody ever entered into that place they would have eternal life now I don't understand why brother brandham said it that way but but I know it's because that they didn't have the characteristics to hold eternal life anymore they they they could not re that's why they tried to make the Tower of babbles they tried to make all of these things we tried to make religions and all of that to get back to God but we're trying to get to a position that we don't have the nature to hold so God kicked him out Brothers we solely we are the only ones that were made for that Holiness but when it escapes us we suffer deprivation a deep rooted sense of lostness and restlessness because we are out of sync with the nature we were created to bear that that's the The Thirst that you see in the world that's why people want to go and worship gods and and all of these things why they're out of sync with the nature that they were created to Bear now God's values his word that used to liberate his word that used to allow them to do whatever they wanted to do in the Garden of Eden now it arrests now now it puts into prison whenever they they created the law which was God's word which was God's values which was what showed God's righteousness and his judgment now whenever they tried to receive it it Arrested them it took them into judgment God's own character because I I remember telling you guys on Sunday that his word is his values so now he tried to give his values to his children and all it did was condemn their sin it condemned the flesh it arrested them and put them to jail and it could not save them in Romans 8 8 uh verses 3 and 4 it says for what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh what was it it was weak through the flesh because our our body our character did not match with his values so no matter how much we try no matter how much we try to conform into the image of God we're always going to create denominations we're always going to create a a form of godliness we're always going to think okay this is to be like God and we're going to arrest people we're going to put people down why because we're using it without the freedom of the spirit without his character right so here A Commentary it said in that it was weak through flesh there is no constant impediment in the way of the success of the law that it had to be carried out by human agents so this had to be carried out but it was beset by our human human uh human Frailty a Frailty naturally consequent upon that physical organization with with which man is endowed Temptation and sin have their roots in the physical part of a human nature and and they were too strong for the purely moral influence of the law the law was limited in the operations by them and failed to overcome them so God's word that's his values that's that's his character that shows who he is these are the principles and ideas of his character and w a w unable to fulfill or to fully follow God's law because the lack of character or nature that embodies God's values in other words humans are imperfect were Pro or prone to to fail and adhere completely to God's standards due to the inherent flaws such as sinfulness and moral imperfections so there is no no way that we can sink up to God anymore there was no way for us to to go to God and and uh actually they couldn't even see God anymore they they couldn't even see his image anymore why we were so imperfection we were so in imperfect here in brother uh in Masterpiece brother Bram says all the prophets had flaws all the ones uh was was a all the ones was a portion but here at last coming up through that finally comes the Masterpiece the perfect one no fault in him at all so perfect reflected of the Builder himself his own image was reflected in his work God and Christ were one in so much that he put his own Spirit into him and then even the image and the Builder became one if you continue to read Romans 3 it says God sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh so the image that brother bram's talking about it wasn't a physical image it wasn't something that was glorious that we were going to see but it was the fullness of the characteristics of God and finally he came to take us out of the hole take us out of the the the prison that Satan put us in how did he do it by his own characteristics he said there must be something to save this creation and nothing could save it because the highest species of the creation has had fallen and every everything under it fell with it because it fell there's only one thing left that did not fall and that was God the heavens so something of the heavens had to come down and redeem his creation because there was nothing here that could create it and God's Own love for the World created um for the World created the character expressed in Christ let me let me refra let me say that again God's Own love for the World created the character expressed in Christ he was God's character he was God's expressed image in him was God God in Christ revealing himself to the world and no one could love ever no one no love could ever be greater than that love such a person would come that he did in order to redeem what was lost if we continue it says that Jesus it says that God sending his own son in the likeness of the sinful flesh and sin condemned in sin condemned sin in the flesh that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit now I I think about it and I believe that the the fullness of God was with Adam and Eve the fullness was of because they were holy so so God didn't have to truly Veil himself the way he did in the Old Testament and even the way he does now but brother Brenham says that that God could not fully reveal himself through Adam and Eve he could not fully Express his attributes so no matter what form or whatever God showed himself because we know that God is an invisible Spirit he's just not this thing floating around it's something that is outside our of our realm of thinking yeah so and whatever form he showed Adam and Eve it was greater than what was in the Old Testament yet he did not reveal himself fully because as what brother bham said in in the unveiling of God he says that the veiling of God or the hiding of God reveals himself so whenever God would hide himself in a certain form he would reveal himself in a certain characteristic whenever he he uh came down to Adam I mean to Abraham when Abram was about to sacrifice his son he goes and he reveals himself there and what does he call himself I am Jehovah Gyra what was it a characteristic and he revealed himself he revealed himself to Moses as a pillar of fire and he says I am that I am so you would see little tiny glimpse of the image of God and that wasn't physical images but he was showing his characteristics there was one time where Moses he said Lord let me just see you you know you get to a relationship with God you get so close to God that you just say Lord I just want to see you Moses got so close to God his relationship to where he said Lord I I just want to see your face and God says okay he says but you're not going to see my face because no one has ever looked upon me and lived you will die at seeing my reflection seeing who I am my image so as he begin to pass he saw the back of a man but what's amazing is whenever he begin to walk by he begin to declare his attributes he declared how graceful he was how great his word was because that is his characteristics that is his image so he couldn't fully Express himself to Adam and Eve and as as the fall came this is what amazing about about us is is when there's Falls in our lives when there's problems when there's things um um setbacks that's when character comes out that's when character is expressed and and whenever the world seemed like it was completely lost there was no way for it to be redeemed character begin to flourish with God that's how God shows his character the more stressful the situation the more trials character blossoms and that's why under suffering under problems under things character is molded that's where character is its best see that's why sometimes whenever we're going through something we have to look within ourselves and say Lord am I displaying God's character whenever we're going through something and and and we begin to to become wild man we say whoa something's not right if I can't take this little tribulation if I when that beating comes brother Bram says it's it's only the beating of the maker right cuz we're we're we're it's a trial of faith that is more precious than gold so it is us we are that gold and the more he beats the more he he tests us the more we look like him man that's that's easy to say Amen but it's hard to live there it's hard to live in our flesh but the spirit's going to lift you up every single time the spirit is going to allow you to change change and mold into those things so that you can overcome and whenever God sees you he sees his own image his own reflection why because your character was a victory over your trials your tribulations and God shows us that through the act of recondition what did it cause him to do caused them the Bible says to be formed into the very image of sinful flesh to look like us to go through what we went through so that he can understand our faults so that he could be projected his very image so his character it it it would produce a body his character produced the body of Jesus Christ and that's what I love about God because you look at at Jesus and you see the fullness of God you see the full fullness of his character you want to know how God acts how what would Jesus do what would God do look at Jesus look at what he did everything that he did projected the very heart of God and I I love what brother brandham he always or he would say this and it would just stuck in be stuck in my mind he'd say I would think that God was angry with me but Jesus loved me then he realized that Jesus was the very heart of of God now now God he puts himself in a vulnerable situation I don't I don't know about any of us but to put your heart out in the line knowing it's going to be crushed knowing that it's going to be despised taking all of all of the walls away and putting it out there that's what God did he took the very heart of himself and and he showed his love because he brother Bram says it it's God's three-fold purpose he what what is he trying to do he had to make himself vulnerable he had to manifest himself first so that he could dwell in US brother Bram says he says God veiled in a form of a man he says this in unveiling of God he says he hid himself from their view they could only see a man but those predes inated seed seeing God one saw a man the other one saw God see and it was God veiled in a human being making both of them right but your faith is what you don't see man I like that I like that sometimes it's hard to see behind the flesh sometimes we we see somebody coming up and we know their past and we be like no not this guy oh not not this girl not knowing that God he placed a seed in there man what an amazing thing and whenever the Pharisees saw Jesus Christ it wasn't to their liking they they created by the law this whole concept of what God should be and you know what I believe they got that from Satan because even brother brandham says that Satan he couldn't believe that that was the son of God he said how could he allow people to spit on him how could he allow him to put up with those things not God not the one that I saw see brother Adam said that he thought God dwelt in Beauty and when maybe when he would see God he would see the glory of God but he didn't know the virtue that that you have to hold in order to hold that position and whenever that virtue came down and he showed himself completely am I pray that I I could do that I pray that I can be like God man that's a bold statement I want to be like God and how to be like Jesus to have Christ in me see our flesh we cannot fulfill God's word no matter how much we try we can come to church we can read the Bible and all it's going to do it's going to arrest us yeah it's going to form a religion it's going to create a Tower of Babel we're going to create a concept of what God should be or God maybe God is this why because it's our fleshly character trying to grasp the values of God trying to grasp his thoughts and and his what he wants for us but in in Hebrews it tells us in in four it says that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in US sin was condemned by his flesh so that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but walk after the spirit Brothers I realize this is not a command we're not commanded to follow the law you as young people you know me as a young person that's what I try to do I grab this word and I arrested My Flesh trying to fulfill the law without the spirit but but Paul is giving us a fact and not a command that Jesus he did this so that the spirit within us might be able to fulfill God's values and his desires what is it our character our nature sinking up with his once more so that even in our flesh we're not walking in our flesh no more but we're walking after the spirit and we're following the word not because we have to but because it's our nature now amen it's a character it's a character change and there's no way we could do it only by the Holy Spirit that's what I like about God is that he's not going to give us a religion he's not going to give us his word he's going to give us the power to overcome everything that we need and once the trials and the tribulations come it's all right you can trust in his word you can trust in his values knowing that his values are now yours and whenever Trials come up you can be just like Jesus and trust in him and give him all the honor and the glory let us stand to our feet I had small little U message but for me this this is something that God has been working with me every single day knowing that our flesh it's it's of this Earth it's fleshly it's Earthly but if we allow the Holy Spirit to live in our lives if we allow the word to be born in within us because like Moses his mom brother Bram says her character was great it was a great character but it could never match up to the character of God and no matter how much how good we were raised no matter what life we've lived no matter what things that molded our fleshly character it will never amount to the word of God we'll never be able to live up to it but if we allow the Holy Spirit to come in and you allow Jesus Christ the one that is here today the one that that has revealed the word has revealed this word through our Prophet he's here today so that we could take in that word and we don't see it and we're like oh my goodness this is too much you know I I don't know about you guys but sometimes you see the message you're like whoa allow the Holy Spirit to come in and those things that are so great become as as brother uh Aaron was preaching it becomes simplified you begin to live it in your daily lives every single day it becomes a a a lifestyle instead of a religion that's something that I want in my life I want a lifestyle I I I don't want to be part of anything else but Jesus Christ and if that's the goal if God um if that's something that you want to be in the image of God he's here he's here so that you can accept it let us bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord we're just so thankful father for your grace and your mercy Lord Lord if it wasn't for you I who knows where we would be at father maybe we'd still be here but but our hearts would be far away Lord but father by your grace you have bestowed the greatest thing which was your word Quicken to us father so that we don't just receive words father but Lord we receive your Holy Spirit and it can change us father it can change our very actions our very thoughts every single thing that that tries to hold us back from more of you Lord Jesus father I ask Lord that each and every person you just touch them Lord whatever they need father if they need more of you Lord I ask father that you give them more of you father you have given us that promise Lord You Have Not held it back from us you didn't create certain things that we have to do in order to receive it you said believe believe and receive it Lord and I just ask father that you raise up the faith of each and every person that we receive more and more of you father that we can reflect your image father to our families to our children to our co-workers Lord that every time we see your word we become more like you father we thank you Jesus we ask that you bless these people father in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen amen God bless you God be with you
