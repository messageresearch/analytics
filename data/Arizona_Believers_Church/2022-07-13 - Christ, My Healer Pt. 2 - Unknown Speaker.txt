TRANSCRIPT
========================================
and appreciate your feedback on these things but we're looking at about divine healing and i said last time and maybe the thrust of the last service i'll just say a few things to capture last service uh we just were mentioning how the whole goal and approach in this subject is to place our faith in such a way that it can continue to grow we have faith but we want it to become perfect faith and we mention that we also want christ to become more personal i wouldn't say personal because i believe he's personal to all of you but even more personal and we took time last wednesday to lay a foundation on the the power of preaching and the power of teaching the word of god and to kind of give the context for taking time to examine a specific subject and look at it in the message of the hour and support it with scripture and some people may think well that's just it is just teaching or it's just looking at doctrine and i believe that there's power in doctrine there's protection in doctrine and we're teaching we feel impressed to teach on divine healing because satan's agenda is to cause confusion with respect to any promise of god and divine healing is in the atonement it's part of our inheritance it's our possession and so with his agenda to confuse the promises of god i believe that uh when we speak on the promises of god they need to be clear and anywhere that the devil's trying to erode our faith or attack our faith uh what i i'll be emphasizing tonight is i believe it's the minister's job to come in and support the believer and to give them the resources they need to fight against the devil when he's trying to attack their faith and first corinthians chapter 14 and i can say even what i just mentioned there is my thesis for tonight in first corinthians chapter 14 verse 10 paul says there are it may be so many kinds of voices in the world and none of them is without signification and so we know there's a lot of voices there's a voice of politics there's a voice of hollywood we've seen the different statements brother branham said about the voices within the church and paul was saying there's many voices in the world articulated speech things tongues or languages but we could say voices be in statements or movements or positions or ideas and when he says none of them are without signification he's saying that all voices have behind it a motive and objective that nobody's just screaming into the abyss no one's just doing it to enjoy their echo but there's some intent behind it and so there's a meaning there's an idea there's an intention attached to all these voices so when they say something it's not just for the sake of knowledge is to motivate you to respond to it or cause you to think a certain way or to defile your faith or to cause you to worry or to be afraid and so all these voices are in the world have an intent behind it as we mentioned last time brother brahm said there's so many angles so many different angles till no one hardly knows what to do i think that's the time we're living in so many different angles until no one hardly knows what to do we looked at in galatians chapter 5 last time we'll come back to it but i want to look at galatians chapter 3 verses 1 to 5. and we made reference to this but i want to look at this a little bit because what paul is doing here has inspired me in taking this subject on divine healing and all that that would entail and he says oh foolish galatians who hath bewitched you that you should not obey the truth before whose eyes jesus christ had hath been evidently set forth crucified among you so paul is very confident that christ had been manifested before them by the preaching of the gospel and that their eyes had seen had been set forth they had seen the crucified christ so now he's saying in their present state they're foolish galatians because they've been bewitched and it mean to be bewitched one has spoke ill of someone if you've been bewitched there's been some sort of slander something's altered you and it means to bring evil through feigned praise or through some sort of good feigned goodness so they've been bewitched and if we were to look into the the the context of this we'd see in the different ways that paul is writing that the galatians are being led away from faith the principle of faith into legalism by as he refers to it later persuasions and so they were established on christ christ had been evidently set forth as crucified among them their eyes had seen it and their eyes having seen it paul is saying he's been slandered and you've been changed someone's feigned goodness or praise and bewitched you to where now you're no longer relying upon faith in christ who you see by revelation who you see by faith but now other persuasions have caused you to resort to legalism and you'll find that he's looking at and identifying that they're working in the flesh and so this is what i want you to recognize something had kind of been supplanted very subtly because they've been bewitched so it's not like they're paul's writing oh great paul's writing this who cares no they perhaps thought that they still were in the truth very ardent faithful and aligned with the truth and something was subtly supplanted and it was causing them to work after the flesh to be perfected because paul continues verse 2. this only what i learned of you received ye the spirit by the works of the law or by the hearing of faith how did you receive the spirit was it by works of the flesh was it according to the law was it legalism was it something carnal or was it by the hearing of faith and remember the hearing of faith speaks it speaks about hearing the word of god and that bringing forth faith and he says it again are ye so foolish having begun in the spirit are you now made perfect by the flesh so now think about what's been replaced faith in jesus christ has been supplanted and now it's the flesh that has the preeminence emotions and feeling sensations legalism all sorts of things that you can put in there he says have you suffered so many things in vain if it be yet in vain he therefore that minister to you the spirit and worketh miracles among you doeth he it by the works of the law or by the hearing of faith what a what a broad thing to say or a very profound thing to say he that ministers to you by the spirit and works miracles among you so there's the ministering by the spirit the vindication of that fallen behind it he says is that by the law is that by legalism is that by faith or is it by the hearing of faith how does the preaching of the word and the subsequent manifestation work he's wanting him to think about it how do you think this happens how is it that you were saved how is it that your lives are changed how is it you found yourselves walking walking in truth and walking in in the light was it was it by the law what was it by and he said no it was by the spirit of god by the hearing of faith so what does what is even the preaching of the word and the subsequent working of miracles among you what does it point to what's the purpose of all of it what is it vindicating does it vindicate the law does it vindicate the flesh and so paul was directly addressing something that was stumbling the believer he uses the language if you want to turn to galatians chapter 5 something that was hindering them hindering their faith and in galatians chapter 5 verses 7 to 9 he says you did run well so he started out well why because they started out in the spirit he says you begin in the spirit but now they're wanting to perfect themselves by their flesh he says you did run well who did hinder you that you should not obey the the truth this persuasion that uh this persuasion is this something taught something said to cause the mind to switch this persuasion cometh not of him that calleth you a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump so all head b is just a little bit and so paul is identifying leaven that worked against their faith something an agent that was acting against their faith and as we look at these scriptures and we could pon we could ponder and ponder and ponder the whole uh the whole book in galatians and realize that there is the gospel which is by faith that is being switched to more carnal legalism fleshly things and and paul is looking at how that has transpired and how that has happened says it's eroding the foundation of the gospel because it's by the hearing of faith and and it's it's it's eroding their experience because now instead of building on the foundation of the hearing of faith now they're trying to make themselves perfect by the flesh they're no longer within the foundation anymore and so everything they build from that point on is certain to fail so you have to be built on this foundation which is the hearing of faith and paul is saying i want you to recognize that you're no longer in the the mode of the of the plan of god to hear hear the word of god and it builds your faith and that's how you're made perfect and so paul this is just an example of paul identifying a a spirit at work against the believer some other persuasion which was hindering them and as i mentioned last time we're taking the time to do that so that our faith is placed right and that our belief even i can put this way that we believe in divine healing and we will expect divine healing because it's in the word of god and that's why our faith is placed and not according to anything else there's some statements we like to come to where brother branham is recognizing that sometimes we're waiting for special time or special gifts or special hands or special services for divine healing and that happens because our faith starts to tend to particular circumstances instead of the word of god we referred to what would be called anecdotal faith last time where god does something for somebody and then their testimony we fixate on the circumstances and we think oh well that's how it has to happen for me instead of coming to the foundation of the hearing of faith being the reason why they were healed or the reason why god intervened for them and so in those sermons broken cisterns and the subject broken cisterns if you recognize what that sermon is about it's brother branham identifying the stagnant broken cisterns that are the denominations and so as a prophet here in early 1965 he's having to point something out in the similar way that paul was doing it to the galatians and follow me in this he says when in reading the scripture this morning which all scripture is given by inspiration and we come to the house of lord for correction and for understanding is that what we come for correction and understanding and sometime that we see the any little thing in the way so now he's saying once we see something in the way something hindering and he uses this a military example like this military man a while ago was speaking to us and saying that some certain things that perhaps maybe in some other country has a certain missile or something on that idea and we've got to find something to counteract that in a military strategy now very possible as a cuban missile crisis or something and so there's these uh communists have missiles or they're they're building up their res their military resources and they're planning an attack and he's saying is from a military standpoint you've got to recognize how your enemy is equipped you got to recognize what they're trying to do maybe a certain missile and then you've got to find something as a strategy to counteract what your enemy is doing and and if you could just let your mind let that kind of develop very quickly in your mind because brother brown is going to draw on that and says well the same thing goes into a church military strategy missiles counter defense systems well he's saying the same thing goes into a church to a parish where a man is preaching or if he's an evangelist in the field when he sees uprisings in something that's just starting going it's infancy or whatever it is you want to you want to catch it in its infancy but just some uprising some movement whether it's just starting out or whatever it is he's saying that when he sees this if that man if he's a servant of god and we're going to focus on the the duty and the responsibility of a servant of god it's his duty if that man is a servant of god to block that thing so far from the people's minds that they'll keep away from it in the same way that an enemy to the united states could be could have some missile system so you come up with a defense system some strategy to block that thing away he says if a minister or man of god sees something going on out there some uprising some movement then he has a duty to block that thing from the people's minds that they'll keep away from it and it's not by it's not by preaching against so much as it is preaching for the best way the best way to be to be against the devil's to be pro-christ the best way to be anti-something is to be for something we we're we don't want to just be anti-anti-lies and anti-this and anti-that we just want to be for truth and that be our emphasis and so he says we don't want that to happen for us to get into places like that and and in this subject matter and what i'm doing in laying this foundation on the the the power of doctrine the importance of teaching and preaching i and as i mentioned before brother talk about we need to let loose of our faith and i believe it was last wednesday when he's we read the statement says there's nothing wrong with your faith it's just a matter of it being placed right and so we're approaching this subject so that our faith can be unhindered placed correctly and if i say undistracted there's so many voices going on in the world and so many missiles aimed at the believer and if we get our eyes on the missiles and we get our eyes on the on the uh all the other strategies and all the lies and all the counter arguments and all the counter cultures and everything that's taking place and and that's when our faith gets distracted and we need to put our faith in the word of god and remember we can emphasize divine healing and we want to see that principle of the word of god working within the church working within believers lives but what it stands for is a new body that's what it's an earnest of it's an earnest of the body change so we if we if we don't have enough faith for a toothache right we don't have enough faith for divine healing uh then we need to we need to be challenged on on whether or not our faith is actually maturing and growing to have faith to change our bodies now if you look at first corinthians chapter 14 verses one to six and and i'll actually jump from uh verse two to another place in corinthians and we'll come back to this the yeah and if you'll just kind of stay real close to what i'm trying to express here because there's a lot in it to where i don't want to get caught up in too much of what paul is addressing um specifically and its applications and because there's so much a breadth to this but i want to just look at a principle and it's just neat how it kind of flows and there's a lot of touch points to what we're wanting to touch on says follow after charity and desire desire spiritual gifts but rather that ye may prophesy for he that speaketh an unknown tongue speak in an unknown tongue speaketh not unto men but unto god and so if in reading that you you want to be very careful what kind of attitude you have towards speaking in tongues if there's one thing that keeps coming back to me as i minister on these things is attitude seems to be the number one thing that we're wanting washed and that by orienting by having the right kind of position to it speaks of attitude towards something it's your orientation to it and so you want to have the right kind of attitude because you hear it saying a man speaks in unknown tongues and he speaks unto god and so you could speak against something and you're speaking against someone's language as they speak to god he says for no man understandeth him how it be it in the spirit he speaketh mysteries who's he speaking to though god so paul is looking at a genuine utterance of tongues and in prayer through worship that a a son of daughter of god or really anyone who the spirit can fall upon can begin to do and can begin to utter and now he says that you would rather may prophesy now prophesy can refer to foretelling future events it can even mean to predict but it also means to speak by divine revelation and it means prophesies to utter or to declare a thing which can only be known by revelation so if you're going to prophesy you don't prophesy your own opinions that's why if someone prophesies and it doesn't come to pass uh then then that's a there's a lying spirit because to prophesy is to put words in god's mouth and so if you're if you're just predicting or guessing prognosticating trying to say who's going to win the world series or something uh then you know god hasn't told you that and so if you that's not prophesying we may joke around a little bit about saying prophesying and prophesying and predicting but to to actually prophesy would be to if you're foretelling a future event is saying god has told me such and such is going to happen and you're foretelling something but then there's also another way it can be used that doesn't relate so much to prediction but rather speaking something that god has made known to someone paul touches on it in chapter 12 verses 1 to 3. now concerning spiritual gifts brethren i would not have you ignorant ye know that you were gentiles carried away under those these dumb idols even as you were led wherefore i give you to understand that no man speaketh by the spirit of god no man speaking by the spirit of god called jesus accursed and that no man can say that jesus is the lord but by the holy ghost so christ can only really be declared by revelation and that revelation cannot contradict the word so no man prophesying or speaking by the spirit of god would say jesus is accursed and so and no man can actually declare that jesus is the lord except by revelation of the spirit or do it by the holy ghost and brother branham uses this verse to say that it you can't just be saying what your mama said you can't just be saying what your daddy said you can't just be saying what the preacher said you've got to say yourself that jesus is lord by revelation otherwise you're just saying what somebody else said now just drawing pointing back to our title christ my healer this foundation for this subject i'm wanting to establish again the the basis for teaching and the the importance of preaching that but catch how that in doing that because i think they can almost stand on its own but looking at it in the context of divine healing it's establishing a basis for divine healing that there's a way that god makes his promise there's a way that god will bring it to pass and it's being touched on just in these things so if you could stay focused here we're going to come back to verse 3 of chapter 14. he says for he that prophesieth speaketh unto men to edification and exhortation and comfort so there's a speaking in tongues that one can do to god and it's in mysteries it's unknown to other men and it's part of a person's worship to god but he's talking about prophesying and there's a prophesying which is declaring what has been made known by revelation and watch he that prophesies speaks unto men to edify exhort and comfort so our benefit our strength any kind of building up by is done by communicating things that are known by revelation he that prophesies speaks to speaking to men to edify exhort and comfort so there's something divinely given and when that is expressed that's what builds up the person he that prophesied speaketh unto men to edification which is to build up promoting growth exhortation which is to encourage comfort which is to persuade but then also to calm and so it's a settling when someone is edified exhorted and comforted then they're stabilized they're plays they can grow so he that prophesieth speaketh unto men to edification and exhortation and comfort he that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself so there's some sort of uh encouragement that takes place when the person speaks and talks but he that prophesieth edifieth the church and i would he all spake with tongues but rather that he prophesied for greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues except he interpret that the church may receive edifying we know this has direct application to the gift of speaking in tongues and a gift of interpretation and how that can operate in the nine spiritual gifts in the church that one can speak in tongues and another prophesy and paul is saying that speaking in tongues you can even say here he's saying that one is good or one is great but it's greater to prophesy in other words have something spoken that everyone could receive and understand now let's look at verse 6 though because this is something where paul is this has application in a much broader sense than just the gifts manifested on a person who speaks in tongues and interprets now brethren if i come unto you speaking with tongues what shall i profit you except i shall speak to you either by revelation or by knowledge or by prophesying or by doctrine now what he's what he's touching on relates to more than just the gifts falling in a service that would anyone would be subject to and that someone could speak but it's relating to his office as a prophet and it's even applicable to what brother brown calls a new testament prophet which would be a minister or a preacher and of the revelation and knowledge and prophesying and doctrine there's a continuity and connection under these among these four different methods of speaking you could see that even how revelation it unveils god's mysteries and so revelation is something that discloses uh uh discloses something of uh on the way of prophesied revelation is disclosed to person then you prophesize disclosure of that revelation i have a revelation then one begins to prophesy what is divinely expressed and then as it speaks of knowledge and doctrine that could be those could be connected and that doctrine is connected to a gift to teach what is known or teach knowledge the teaching of teaching of what someone understands and there's a lot in this uh there's a lot in these words revelation knowledge prophesying doctrine there's a lot in that but let me just say revelation needs to be preached mysteries need to be preached they need to be understood they don't need to be made more mysterious but they need to be faithfully taught in the manner which the prophet taught them so that we could receive them in the same way that he received them by divine revelation and so knowledge needs to be preached and revelation needs to be preached and we need to have understanding as brotherhood says we come to church not just for correction but for understanding and teaching as we mentioned last time teaching settles us it's what settles us and establishes our faith and here is paul says that one if i unless i speak by revelation and something divinely inspired or by knowledge or by prophesying or by doctrine teaching is the setting forth of doctrine and brotherhood makes a statement in one place he says in any man that has not a doctrine has not a ministry so if you try to strip ministry and say you can't have doctrine you can't teach doctrine uh then a man doesn't have a ministry in first corinthians chapter 12 verse 8 it says for to one is given by the spirit the word of wisdom and to another the word of knowledge by the same spirit so there's a word of wisdom that one can have because the spirit gives them the word of wisdom and another can have the word of knowledge by the same spirit now the word knowledge there believing one place is actually translated to science in the bible in the new testament and there's something that struck me and i want to be able to share this i'm very careful maybe just to share my personal the way it struck me personally but in this the spirit has given a word of knowledge so there are observations that can be made that the spirit quickens an understanding of that you see some it's observable conduct there's something taking place someone can be given the sp by the spirit a word of wisdom another the word of knowledge and so this word of knowledge has a lot of a lot of meaning behind it brother ram says that a man a pastor a man in a parish somewhere he says in a church where man is preaching or evangelist he says when he sees some uprising in something that's just starting and going in other words he observes something and when he observes it then he has some sort of duty to respond correctly in a way that blocks it from the people's minds and now this is the part that i would say for you just to consider a little bit it happens so often when the word is preached that something's exposed in our lives and we know nobody the preacher didn't know that at all like that was supernatural and sometimes the joke is that you know brother aaron has a bug in our home and or and there's different things that are said like this was just exactly what we were talking about this is exactly what we needed and that's the word discerning needs in your heart and needs in your life and don't we all love it when that happens and that's that that's the kind of the best way it takes place now there's times in our lives also that we have come into a church service and and uh the man standing behind the sacred desk is just hitting at something and punching at something that everybody knows he knows and he's trying to make a point anybody's ever experienced that before and hopefully not recently but there's something happening and you're sitting there going well that's just i just called him yesterday and asked him for advice and i remember one time i was i was privy to a situation where somebody somebody had called and asked for advice and i kind of escalated it to this other person who knew better and then that person who i thought knew better just decided to take it immediately to the pulpit another person came to me and said do you think they knew and i said you should probably just go ask them right that way i didn't have to i didn't have to get mixed up in it and it generally doesn't make someone feel good when their issue is broadcast over the pulpit and so i want to acknowledge that there is a level of unfaithfulness that a man of god can engage in when he has not fully surrendered to the will of god and finds the right way to address a need without harming inappropriately god's sheep or making the issue broader amongst amongst all the people so i'm saying that just to just identify that i understand that there's a way that knowledge can be abused but what i would like to also point out is let's not use that abuse to shield ourselves from ever letting knowledge be effective against us or for us for our benefit because we could paint it in a picture in such a way as well as long as we let the preacher know before he preaches he's duty-bound and obligated not to preach against it otherwise he's being carnal and i'm just going to say right now if i see it and god can anoint me to help you in it i'm not going to be afraid to speak it in love i'm not going to be afraid to touch on things and people say oh well he must be talking about this or he must be talking about that i'm not saying i'm not that i necessarily would be doing that but don't build up a complex in our minds where the man of god can't use knowledge quickened by the spirit to address needs in our lives don't you want him to do that because what you may not realize there may be a lot of things in our lives that are obvious to other people and all it takes is someone who's just got their eyes open to say oh my they need help they need wisdom and the spirit of god can move upon someone to use a word of knowledge to help you in your need and it's no less supernatural if they already knew about it ahead of time as long as it's the word that's doing it amen i've seen a lot of situations where people profess to have a word of knowledge and it's because they were told ahead of time but they say well the lord showed me and i'm like well you don't have to call me lord you can call me brother aaron so a servant of god brother says when he sees uprisings he has a responsibility catch this to observe and then study it out he has a responsibility to be observant a minister is not just locking himself in the room the whole time and just asking for some sort of random inspiration but he is to have some sort of contact and communication to listen and to hear and as you fellowship one with another as i fellowship with you there's things that are communicated and it's in that fellowship that things are inspired because you realize oh this is where they're coming from this is what they're feeling and a minister has a responsibility to observe and study it out in the word and the sermon the impersonation of christianity and i'll apologize as i read this if it's disjointed in the slides because i i was i messed up in my copy and pasted where i had brother branham saying something four or five different times in the same same passage and i went back i think i got it fixed but if it doesn't quite match up that was on me and the message the impersonation of christianity i hope this uh you can catch this and god likened the prophet to the eagle that would go up in the makeup of a prophet he is a seer that in the spirit climbs beyond the emotion of the church a brother shared with me a quote last week uh where it says where you see a church with a lot of emotions and the dancing and shouting praises usually there's a lot of backbiting and bitterness because it's emotions and he says he goes beyond the rhythm of the music he goes beyond the clapping of the hands he goes beyond the joy among the saints he goes beyond all that god brings them up into a realm alone alone then he opens his eyes and he lets him look around and see things that is to come this is brother i'm describing what happens to a prophet he's looking at ezekiel he says then he brings them back down among the members of the body to foretell them of what is in the making so god had took ezekiel high far up let him see around about 2 600 years think of it at least talk about what god did with ezekiel now watch this description a prophet is also a gift of knowledge a knowledge is like an attorney i hope everybody's listening knowledge is like an attorney who studies the books and when you go to hire an attorney to plead your case he's only taking what he knows do you recognize what brother branham has done profit equals attorney attorney equals profit i'm joking he's using a prophet has a gift of knowledge but he's looking at from a natural perspective a a prophet has a gift of knowledge well what how brother branham well you take an attorney who studies the law studies the books understands your case takes the the law which is the black and white and the letter of it then looks at your specific facts and he tries to find the precedent he tries to find the principles he tries to find all the different elements of your case and what's gonna what's going to help you and he has to go by what he knows you don't want an attorney who's just guessing it's like do you think i have a good case i'm not even sure what your case is but let's just go in there by inspiration and see what happens all right i went to law school got the degree we're just gonna wing it he says go about taking what he knows and you're you are paying oh you're paying you're paying for what he knows to present your case before the judge so it's based upon his knowledge his expertise what he understands and now a gift of knowledge in the bible is prophecy and recognize what he's referred to there's something already given and already established that the attorney goes to and uses to understand and apply to your life for your benefit and your situation he says that a gift of knowledge in the bible is prophecy which goes up and finds out these things that are to come and brings them back down but they must compare with the bible with the book if they're out of the book then they're not received because the judge judges by the book so you recognize the parallel that that there's a word that is given and the prophet can go into that but is whenever he comes back and he begins to prophesy it better line up with the book you see it so it must be on the word then the word of god has spoken before the foundation of the world it isn't god speaks and says something to the prophet at that time it is that the prophet catches what god has already said wow caught up to hear what god has already said it's already echoing in heaven for the word was before the foundation of the world god spoke the world and it's lame the word and it's laying way out stretched out in time and the prophet goes up and sees the time coming so it's only a gift of knowledge that he brings down and puts it on the paper i i i got more quotes on lawyers so if you'll just stay with me there's actually one where he says uh should i even say it because i know just give ammunition to somebody never mind that was kind of coaxing them out now you've identified them but there's a word that god had in his mind that is drawn out through time and he says the prophets went up and caught that and that's what you're reading this is the law book this is the precedent this is these are our case studies this is where we can go in and we have certain precedents that are established in our court system and someone when you write your brief out you can say well this is well-established law and this was decided by this circuit this was decided by that this was decided by the supreme court and in this case they looked at this and this is what they decided and it's applicable to this that's what we're looking at in the bible is god's precedent to say that he did this and he did that this is what he thinks and this is where he acts so as the prophet went up into another realm and caught the word and put it on paper now we as believers and even other men of god go right back to the source material and study it out so it can be made applicable to your situation there's a uh this is this is lawyerly advice you can time me i just i charge by increments of the an hour so if it's just 30 seconds you're going to get billed at an hour but when the answer you may want to know this the answer to the question can i sue is always yes always brother aaron can i suit yeah absolutely that's always the answer but the question is whether or not you would prevail on the merits why do i have a case and what's the likelihood that we would succeed or what are the weaknesses in my case or what are what are the defenses that someone may have if we sued them and so there's a lot more that goes into it and one thing you'll find if you try to figure out the law you may read the law say oh well that's just black and white it says if a person does this with malice a fourth thought takes another person's life by this by that that's murder in the first degree like that is so so black and white that's so easy then take a fact scenario and look at it and you're like okay that's where we get the gray from the law seems to be very clear but the way that one would apply it to their life can be hard it can be difficult and so what you you want you'd want to understand how it how it applies how has it been applied how has how has god honored that word how has it been used so i can fully understand it and so as brother branham uses this example knowledge is like an attorney a prophet is a gift of knowledge and a knowledge is like an attorney this is how god's servants operate they're driven to the word for the believer's benefit it's a burden i just i'll just testify personally it's a drive it's a burden there's there's certain things i will never be confused with the athletes that get up at four o'clock in the morning drink some egg yolk and then go run 15 miles come back and eat you know take some whey protein and and are just constantly working out you'll never confuse me for that those people are driven to do that but i will say this in the same way that i'm driven to the word of god i can match any elite athlete because it's a drive that is that cannot be quenched it cannot be satisfied and i recognize it as something being beyond myself it's something supernatural and you literally all of you are literally pulling me into the word of god and i must be here and i must be sensitive and i must be hearing these things and i must understand the message and i've got to be sure i'm directly under the headship of the messenger of the hour i can't vary i can't make a mistake because souls are resting on this it's a drive and it's a burden you'll find that paul in second timothy chapter 2 verse 15 he says he says this to to to timothy and ii timothy chapter 2 verse 15 study to show thyselves approved unto god a workman that needeth not to be ashamed rightly dividing the word of truth paul knew he'd be departing and in departing he knew there needed to be faithful men that could take what he was taught take what he taught and then rightly divide it so he tells them study to show thyself approved it's something that a man of god ought to do brother adam does say it in a few places that we all should study the word of god study it out he says study to show thyselves approved a workman that needeth not to be ashamed rightly dividing the word of truth in chapter four verse two preach the word be instant in season and out of season reprove rebuke exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine recognize all these different elements he's as we read to the young people here recently let no man despise thy youth he tells them neglect not the gift that is in thee but meditate upon these things give thyself holy to them that thy profiting may appear to all take heed unto thyself and unto the doctrine continue in them for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself and them that hear thee if you will study to show yourself approved rightly divide the word of truth preach the word be instant in season out of season reprove rebuke absorb with all long suffering give yourself holy to the things that you have heard give yourself holy to the message of the hour give yourself and take heed to yourself and teach it correctly continuing it then you'll be saved and others will be saved that hear thee this is groundwork for this the subject christ my healer trying to focus your attention to the word the basis for faith in the sermon the mark of the beast bibram says now all of the old all of the old the types the shadows christ in the shadow of the lamb god in the beginning knowing all things nothing has ever been predicted or put in the scripture but god already spoke it before the foundation of the world there's your idea of the word spoken drawn out prophets just come up and catch it he says the whole plan of god was laid out you believe it saint john the first chapter about the seventh verse and it says in the beginning was the word it'd be the first verse the word was with god and the word was god then what this bible it was is god before the foundation of the world the only reason it is written in here is prophets receiving from god for knowledge of his predestinated plan of the ages a lawyer studies the books to find out all the knowledge that he knows how to find out so he can give it to his client oh that's the way the prophets are the teachers are they study the word i just like how he's putting lawyers just right in the same breath as prophets and teachers i don't know why i'm just enjoying that he said that's the way the prophets are the teachers are they study the word first the prophet goes to god and the word comes down and he wrote it in the bible and now that was god's four ordained plan the prophet saw and he wrote it in the word so that the people following would be warned of situations and things to come so it's written it's here it's in the word of god now by inspiration that word was spoken by god by inspirations the prophets brought it and by inspiration we have to receive it it's not a material it's not a natural thing it's not the carnal mind listen the man in his carnal conditions can never understand it no way at all it is impossible for the spiritual things to be carnal mind for the spiritual things to the carnal mind is foolish it says the scripture and vice versa now we must be spiritual minded the word in the mind of god spoken before the foundational world laid out prophets go up and catch it bring it down that's given us the bible that's what the message of the hour is it's the mind of god opened up to us we've received his word and then we the people following are warned by that we receive something from it now in the same in the same channel recognize how brother branham addresses this in that day on calvary for i'm sure at this late hour that we're living we're seeking every importance of god that we can know and this time we're living and this is what we ought to be doing seeking every importance of god that we can know and all that we can find out and we're here to learn of it to see what it is for us and what god has done for us and see what his promise what he's promised to do for us you could just write that down as your expectation for every church service i'm coming to find out what's important to god i want to find out what we're here to learn what he ha what it is for us what god has done for us what he's promised to do for us and that's what we come to church for now that's what we come to church for what do we come to church for we're seeking important things from god for us to know and we want to we want all that we can find out we're here to learn of it to see what it is for us what god has done for us and see what he's promised for us that's what you're here for that's why you come to church and then brother branham in the next statement continue on that's what he's promised that's what we come to church for and that's why the preacher preaches why does the preacher preach because you're coming to hear important things of god you're coming to find out what his promises are for us today you're coming to to know all about it and what it is for us and and we want to learn of it and we want to know about it that's why he studies and meditates in the scripture and seeks for inspiration why because he's a public servant he is because he is a public servant to god's people and he's trying to find something that god would have to say to his people something that would help them that's what we come to church for is to have something that will help us there's probably not a worse feeling when you leave church than to feel like something was taken away from you when service is over i came with faith and i'm leaving with a little a little less i came with joy and i'm leaving with the little ass i came with heartache and now it's compounded and that's the worst kind of feeling when you come to church and because when you come to church you're coming to to find out what you need trying to find something that god would have to say to his people that would help them now he says it might be to condemn them in their sins but would be a help to raise them up and that they might forsake their sins and then raise up to serve the lord and ministered ministers should seek these things ministers should seek these things as a man would recognize little uprisings and things he'd want to he'd want to have the the wisdom of god to look into the word of god and find the things that will help the people that's why it and it's uh and i'm i i'm not necessarily thinking i'm not thinking of anything specific i'm just saying we've seen this pattern in our lives whether it be economic cycles and things start happening where the economy starts to fail a little bit and you're going to find seeky first the kingdom of god and the righteous are not forsaken and you're not going to be begging bread and there's a word that kind of comes along to match the present trial and stress that we're experiencing in the world whenever there's a global pandemic then there's a lot of ministry about divine healing and the protection and the promises of god why that's a minister of god reading the room seeing the things that are taking place where the sheep are at going through it himself finding comfort in the word of god and so a minister to seek the things that are relevant to the people could you imagine if if i was up here preaching about this dispute in kazakhstan you know in a village out there somewhere there's a raging debate among some people there and we're trying to figure it all out like what does that have to do with me brother aaron how am i going to benefit from it no just stick with me it's really interesting if you want that get find a podcast there's a there's a lot of stuff out there if you want to find out about all these irrelevant things that have nothing to do with our faith and are getting out of here but when we come to church we want to hear things relevant to where we're at so that we don't always stay here we want to leave fashion with my wife on different situations and we were talking about something in particular and i expressed it this way i don't want to go back to the way things were because the way things were got us where we are things need to change and that's sometimes what we need to hear at church is not just getting back and normalizing certain things we get back in the same routine and we feel like we're doing better but take a step back oh things might have seemed great but that cycle got you right back where you are now and you don't want to start another one the way things were got you where you are and sometimes what you need is to change what you're doing you need a complete change and a revolutionizing of where you're at your thought process and your experiences and what you're viewing and what you're feeding on because you don't want to repeat the cycles and that's why we come to church is not to ride the roller coaster and to go on the marigold go around and do it as a church where we're constantly in a cycle of the same old things the same script right the same move he played over and over and over again but we need something fresh from god that meets us where we're at takes us a step higher and that's what a minister does he seeks these things he says this is the burden of ministry this is the burden for men of god this is what the men of god in this church not just myself but the other ministers here this is how they feel and the sermon how can i overcome brother brown says now as we study this i love that it's not can i overcome i love a question that already assumes the positive a lot of ways we ask questions that it's uh that really the answer already has to accept a negative assumption so one of the trickiest questions that someone could ever ask somebody is have you stopped beating your wife yet because what it assumes you want to say no and it's like wait you haven't stopped no yes so you have stopped no and right because there's some negative assumption built into it and so brother braham is not saying why you can't overcome why can't you overcome you're saying how can i overcome it as soon as you can but it's a how says now as we study this my purpose of this is just not to come here to fellowship with you people which i love to do that but if i had a chance to do that i would come to your home and shake your hand and talk with you and sit down eat dinner with you and sit down under the shade tree and talk and fellowship a while that's your that's your family tree your home that you can invite someone into a fellowship under the shade tree but when we come here we are here for one specific purpose this is the house of correction this is the throne this is the throne of god and judgment goes forth from the house of god and here is where we come together gather in love with one another as only christians can love but in here we're under leadership of the holy spirit the holy ghost is among us and we're here to take reckoning among us to see where our short places are our shortcoming and how we can catch from where we should be over to where we ought to be now where we are and where we ought to be that's why we come come on catch our short places our shortcomings where we ought to be where we are and where we ought to be and that's what we study ministers study those places for their people when they see the people the lack then they begin on that how when they see it when they observe it when they recognize it and it goes back to the point i made earlier that it's not that the minister is in his study and he's studying he's like i've got a perfect congregation everything's perfect there's no problems at all we're a breath away from the rapture and all of a sudden it's like boom oh my goodness there's trouble i never saw this before right it's that's not the way that it works but he sees things and uh let me just acknowledge are you some of you may be thinking brand do you think we don't believe in divine healing what have we been doing no it's not that at all but there's things that i want to be direct on there's things that we need to preach and there's things that we need to not confront but address to loose our faith and i may not have to get specific but just by preaching the word it can do it that's what we study ministers study those places when they see the people the lack that they begin on that now i almost there's a part of me that would like to be able to go back and preach last wednesday in this and just methodically go back through all these little pieces because these are just foundational points when we begin to preach on divine healing that's it's specific for a reason for a purpose and there's things that the devil is going to try to do to confuse us there's things he's done to try to confuse us there's a little leaven that kind of gets sewn into our understanding about things and it just becomes the little hang-up just a small little hang-up something that's keeping us from walking fully in the promises of god there's ways that we think we're doing the right thing but we're actually hindering our faith by doing it and so we want our faith to be free in psalms 107 verse 20. i'm going to close with this scripture and i have a couple more statements just to share with you but we're closing here he sent his word this is this is the beginning for the next part maybe next wednesday night he sent his word and healed them and delivered them from their destructions that word is he sent his commandment he sent his blessing i think wesley when he commented on this he said he's sent his blessing he sent his word his command he was just speaking now hear me this is this is i'm stepping into the next these first two services have been very general but now this is the foundation this is the real core and foundation the basis for faith the basis of believing in divine healing the power to heal our soul to heal our spirits and heal our body lays within god's word because salvation of the soul that's deliverance of the soul from sin that's a healing the healing of the soul even the healing of our spirits and the healing of our body the divine healing of soul uh spirit and body lays within the word of god our perfection as paul chastised the galatians does not come by legalism or the works of the flesh but it comes by the hearing of faith and faith is grown by hearing the word of god faith comes by hearing the word and it grows by hearing the word and brother brahm says and what it takes to overcome all unbelief he says our faith he says now the initial and original way to receive any redemptive blessing is by hearing the word of god because faith cometh by hearing and hearing the word of god like the ministers preach when we when we go when you think about everything we've mentioned tonight how that's what a man does in his church where he's preaching he sees uprisings he thinks starting he sees whatever it is if he's a servant of god he wants to block things from the people's minds so they'll keep away from it we start going down that line of how that by knowledge he goes into the word of god and brings things out in the word of god and he studies things out in the word of god to bring to the people things that are already in the word of god he studies he rightly divides the word of truth he preaches the word he studies the books to find all the knowledge he digs into the message he studies the word and he brings it with inspiration you receive it by inspiration he studies and meditates the scripture that's why he preaches as he seeks these things and that's why he studies those places when they see the people where they lack they begin on that why because the preaching of the word of god is what god uses to meet your need that's what he uses faith cometh by hearing hearing of the word of god like the ministers preach so the initial in original way remember this the initial and original way to receive any redemptive blessing is by hearing the word of god the original way is to hear the word of god the initial way to receive any redemptive blessing is by hearing the word of god then what we want to hear is the word of god it's not we don't come to church to say ben robinson tell me a tale right we're not here to hear tales we're here to hear the word of god hearing the word of god is the initial and the original way to receive any redemptive blessing because faith comes by hearing hearing the word of god like the ministers preach we'll bring it out in other scriptures and other places in the message of the hour but i have one last statement musicians if you could prepare you could come as you're ready i don't have this for you in the slides i just want to read it to you as we close you could you could think on these things it's in the sermon i perceive that thou art a prophet just focus your faith still yet now as we close for no matter how much i would pray for you if you yourself didn't have the faith that wouldn't do any good it takes your faith and no matter how much i preach to you and how well i brought the gospel to you if you yourself it's your own personal faith in christ that saves you he says is that right i couldn't save you no matter how bad i'd want to i've got brothers that's not saved and i've tried my best and persuaded and cried and begged and tried to stand in the breach for them but they've got to have their own faith in god many of you christian people here have brothers and sisters and mothers and fathers and children and everything unsaved is that right he says raise your hand well you can't save them you can't do what christ has already done amen christ has saved them now the only thing they have to do is accept that salvation god's free gift remember in this sycamore salvation and divine healing are preached and he says now you couldn't heal them no other man could heal them [Music] they have to accept their healing is god's free gift to them he was wounded for our transgressions with his stripes we were healed then see there's nothing at all that you can do towards salvation or divine healing it's the individual's faith in christ that's that's that's solely where it rests it says it's your faith that saves you personal faith in christ your personal faith in christ that heals you and he says now to bring up this faith in christ how how are we going to have enough faith to be saved how are we going to have enough faith to be healed if it takes my own personal faith in god how am i ever going to have it to bring it up to build it up to cultivate it he says there are ministers he says that's the most important thing of the day as a good god-sent preacher i admire them and their gift is far beyond anything could be done in anything else is a preacher a man who knows how to rightly divide the word of god i know we might all be really really impressed with how well patrick mahomes can read a cover too and the safety's over the top and know how to audible out in the past run option i know we're all mesmerized by that but it's got nothing on a man of god who can rightly divide the word of truth he said it's a gift far beyond anything it could be done in anything else there's no amount of triple doubles quadruple quadruples or whatever could never come to the gift that is expressed when a man of god takes the word of god and rightly divides it it's the most wonderful gift in the world it's the most wonderful gift in the world it's the most wonderful gift in the world is to be a minister which was a new testament modern-day prophet a preacher prophesy means to foretell or to tell some personal thing in other words if you read the bible and start to tell then that's a preacher but prophesies to testify foretell he says all right now but catch this he says now and the spirit of christ is prophecy now in this church that we're living in today and the times that there are a minister can go forth and explain to you about salvation you accept it you'd be saved now the only thing that minister could do to save you would be explain it to you i know that maybe catches up on um some controversial language because we don't want to just explain something but it is in the teaching and setting it forth he says a minister can explain set forth rightly divide the word of truth and the thing that gonna save you is he's gonna explain to you now the only way a man could do to get you healed [Music] is to explain it out of the bible so perfectly that you would see it and believe it and accept your healing and be healed is that right that's the only way through preaching so how is our faith for our children how are they ever going to be saved when they hear the word of god preached and don't discount the sermons you can preach in your own home your own devotions you don't lift up the word of god in taking the things that you hear in the house of god and imparting them in the way that your children and our loved ones are going to be saved it's when the word of god is preached and they receive it and the same goes for divine healing [Music] not just explained in a carnal way but ministered in a way that rightly divides it brings clarity to it so perfectly that you see it believe it and accept it and then you're healed he says it's through preaching that's how that we're going to be healed is through the word of god because he sent his word and healed him god bless you let's stand together
