[0:00] and appreciate your feedback on these
[0:01] things but we're looking at about divine
[0:04] healing and i said last time and maybe
[0:06] the thrust of the last service i'll just
[0:08] say a few things to capture last service
[0:10] uh we just were mentioning how the whole
[0:12] goal and approach in this subject is to
[0:14] place our faith in such a way that it
[0:17] can continue to grow we have faith but
[0:18] we want it to become perfect faith and
[0:20] we mention that we also want christ to
[0:22] become more personal i wouldn't say
[0:25] personal because i believe he's personal
[0:26] to all of you but even more personal
[0:29] and we took time last wednesday to lay a
[0:31] foundation on the the power of preaching
[0:33] and the power of teaching the word of
[0:36] god
[0:36] and to kind of give
[0:38] the context for taking time to examine a
[0:41] specific subject and look at it in the
[0:43] message of the hour and support it with
[0:44] scripture
[0:45] and some people may think well that's
[0:47] just
[0:48] it is just teaching or it's just looking
[0:50] at doctrine and i believe that there's
[0:52] power in doctrine there's protection in
[0:54] doctrine and we're teaching we feel
[0:57] impressed to teach on divine healing
[0:59] because satan's agenda is to cause
[1:02] confusion with respect to any promise of
[1:03] god
[1:04] and divine healing is in the atonement
[1:07] it's part of our inheritance it's our
[1:09] possession and so with his agenda to
[1:11] confuse the promises of god i believe
[1:14] that uh when we speak on the promises of
[1:16] god they need to be clear
[1:18] and anywhere that the devil's trying to
[1:19] erode our faith or attack our faith uh
[1:22] what i i'll be emphasizing tonight is i
[1:24] believe it's the minister's job to come
[1:26] in and support the believer and to give
[1:30] them the resources they need to fight
[1:31] against the devil when he's trying to
[1:33] attack their faith
[1:35] and first corinthians chapter 14 and i
[1:37] can say even what i just mentioned there
[1:38] is my thesis for tonight
[1:40] in first corinthians chapter 14 verse 10
[1:44] paul says there are it may be so many
[1:46] kinds of voices in the world and none of
[1:48] them is without signification and so we
[1:51] know there's a lot of voices there's a
[1:52] voice of politics there's a voice of
[1:54] hollywood we've seen the different
[1:55] statements brother branham said about
[1:57] the voices within the church
[1:59] and paul was saying there's many voices
[2:01] in the world articulated speech things
[2:03] tongues or languages but we could say
[2:06] voices be in statements or movements or
[2:08] positions or ideas and when he says none
[2:10] of them are without signification he's
[2:13] saying that all voices have behind it a
[2:15] motive and objective
[2:17] that nobody's just screaming into the
[2:18] abyss no one's just doing it to enjoy
[2:20] their echo but there's some intent
[2:23] behind it and so there's a meaning
[2:25] there's an idea there's an intention
[2:28] attached to all these voices so when
[2:30] they say something it's not just for the
[2:32] sake of knowledge is to motivate you to
[2:35] respond to it or cause you to think a
[2:37] certain way or to defile your faith or
[2:39] to cause you to worry or to be afraid
[2:42] and so all these voices are in the world
[2:44] have an intent behind it as we mentioned
[2:47] last time brother brahm said there's so
[2:48] many angles so many different angles
[2:50] till no one hardly knows what to do
[2:53] i think that's the time we're living in
[2:54] so many different angles until no one
[2:56] hardly knows what to do
[2:59] we looked at in galatians chapter 5 last
[3:01] time we'll come back to it but i want to
[3:03] look at galatians chapter 3
[3:06] verses 1 to 5.
[3:08] and we made reference to this but i want
[3:10] to look at this a little bit because
[3:11] what paul is doing here
[3:14] has inspired me in taking this subject
[3:17] on divine healing
[3:18] and all that that would entail
[3:20] and he says oh foolish galatians who
[3:23] hath bewitched you that you should not
[3:25] obey the truth before whose eyes jesus
[3:28] christ had hath been evidently set forth
[3:31] crucified among you so paul is very
[3:32] confident
[3:34] that christ had been manifested before
[3:37] them by the preaching of the gospel and
[3:39] that their eyes had seen had been set
[3:41] forth they had seen the crucified christ
[3:44] so now he's saying in their present
[3:46] state they're foolish galatians because
[3:48] they've been bewitched
[3:50] and it mean to be bewitched one has
[3:52] spoke ill of someone if you've been
[3:54] bewitched there's been some sort of
[3:56] slander something's altered you and it
[3:59] means to bring evil through feigned
[4:01] praise or through some sort of good
[4:03] feigned goodness so they've been
[4:05] bewitched and if we were to look into
[4:08] the the
[4:09] the context of this we'd see in the
[4:12] different ways that paul is writing that
[4:13] the galatians are being led away from
[4:15] faith the principle of faith
[4:17] into legalism by as he refers to it
[4:19] later persuasions
[4:21] and so they were established on christ
[4:24] christ had been evidently set forth as
[4:26] crucified among them their eyes had seen
[4:29] it and their eyes having seen it paul is
[4:31] saying he's been slandered and you've
[4:33] been changed someone's feigned goodness
[4:35] or praise and bewitched you to where now
[4:38] you're no longer relying upon faith in
[4:41] christ
[4:42] who you see by revelation who you see by
[4:44] faith but now other persuasions have
[4:47] caused you to resort to legalism
[4:50] and you'll find that he's looking at and
[4:52] identifying
[4:53] that they're working in the flesh and so
[4:56] this is what i want you to recognize
[4:57] something had kind of been supplanted
[4:59] very subtly
[5:01] because they've been bewitched so it's
[5:02] not like they're paul's writing oh great
[5:04] paul's writing this who cares no they
[5:06] perhaps thought that they still were in
[5:08] the truth very ardent faithful and
[5:11] aligned with the truth and something was
[5:13] subtly supplanted and it was causing
[5:15] them to work after the flesh to be
[5:17] perfected because paul continues verse
[5:20] 2. this only what i learned of you
[5:22] received ye the spirit by the works of
[5:24] the law or by the hearing of faith how
[5:27] did you receive the spirit was it by
[5:28] works of the flesh was it according to
[5:30] the law was it legalism
[5:32] was it something carnal or was it by the
[5:34] hearing of faith and remember the
[5:36] hearing of faith speaks it speaks about
[5:38] hearing the word of god and that
[5:40] bringing forth faith and he says it
[5:41] again are ye so foolish
[5:44] having begun in the spirit are you now
[5:46] made perfect by the flesh so now think
[5:49] about what's been replaced faith in
[5:50] jesus christ has been supplanted and now
[5:53] it's the flesh that has the preeminence
[5:55] emotions and feeling sensations legalism
[5:58] all sorts of things that you can put in
[6:00] there he says have you suffered so many
[6:02] things in vain
[6:03] if it be yet in vain he therefore that
[6:06] minister to you the spirit
[6:08] and worketh miracles among you doeth he
[6:11] it by the works of the law or by the
[6:13] hearing of faith
[6:15] what a what a
[6:17] broad thing to say or a very profound
[6:20] thing to say he that ministers to you by
[6:22] the spirit and works miracles among you
[6:24] so there's the ministering by the spirit
[6:26] the vindication of that fallen behind it
[6:28] he says is that by the law
[6:30] is that by legalism is that by faith or
[6:32] is it by the hearing of faith
[6:35] how does the preaching of the word and
[6:37] the subsequent manifestation work he's
[6:38] wanting him to think about it how do you
[6:40] think this happens
[6:41] how is it that you were saved how is it
[6:43] that your lives are changed how is it
[6:45] you found yourselves walking walking in
[6:47] truth and walking in in the light was it
[6:49] was it by the law
[6:51] what was it by and he said no it was by
[6:53] the spirit of god by the hearing of
[6:55] faith
[6:57] so what does what is even the preaching
[6:59] of the word and the subsequent working
[7:01] of miracles among you what does it point
[7:03] to
[7:04] what's the purpose of all of it what is
[7:05] it vindicating does it vindicate the law
[7:07] does it vindicate the flesh
[7:09] and so paul was directly addressing
[7:12] something
[7:13] that was stumbling the believer he uses
[7:15] the language if you want to turn to
[7:16] galatians chapter 5 something that was
[7:18] hindering them hindering their faith
[7:21] and in galatians chapter 5 verses 7 to 9
[7:23] he says you did run well so he started
[7:25] out well why because they started out in
[7:27] the spirit
[7:28] he says you begin in the spirit but now
[7:29] they're wanting to perfect themselves by
[7:31] their flesh he says you did run well who
[7:33] did hinder you that you should not obey
[7:36] the the truth
[7:37] this persuasion
[7:39] that
[7:40] uh this persuasion is this something
[7:43] taught something said to
[7:45] cause the mind to switch this persuasion
[7:48] cometh not of him that calleth you
[7:50] a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump
[7:52] so all head b is just a little bit
[7:55] and so
[7:56] paul is identifying leaven that worked
[7:59] against their faith something an agent
[8:01] that was acting against their faith
[8:03] and as we look at these scriptures and
[8:05] we could pon we could ponder and ponder
[8:07] and ponder the whole uh the whole book
[8:09] in galatians and realize that there is
[8:12] the gospel which is by faith that is
[8:14] being switched to more carnal legalism
[8:18] fleshly things and and paul is
[8:21] looking at how that has transpired and
[8:23] how that has happened says it's eroding
[8:25] the foundation of the gospel because
[8:26] it's by the hearing of faith
[8:28] and and it's it's it's eroding their
[8:30] experience because now instead of
[8:32] building on the foundation of the
[8:34] hearing of faith now they're trying to
[8:36] make themselves perfect by the flesh
[8:37] they're no longer within the foundation
[8:39] anymore
[8:40] and so everything they build from that
[8:42] point on is certain to fail so you have
[8:44] to be built on this foundation which is
[8:46] the hearing of faith and paul is saying
[8:49] i want you to recognize
[8:50] that you're no longer in the the mode of
[8:53] the of the plan of god to hear hear the
[8:56] word of god and it builds your faith and
[8:58] that's how you're made perfect
[9:01] and so paul this is just an example of
[9:03] paul identifying a
[9:05] a spirit at work against the believer
[9:08] some other persuasion which was
[9:10] hindering them and as i mentioned last
[9:12] time we're taking the time to do that so
[9:14] that our faith is placed right and that
[9:16] our belief even i can put this way that
[9:18] we believe in divine healing and we will
[9:20] expect divine healing because it's in
[9:22] the word of god and that's why our faith
[9:24] is placed
[9:26] and not according to anything else
[9:28] there's some statements we like to come
[9:29] to where brother branham is recognizing
[9:31] that sometimes we're waiting for special
[9:33] time or special gifts or special hands
[9:36] or special services for divine healing
[9:38] and that happens because our faith
[9:40] starts to tend to particular
[9:42] circumstances instead of the word of god
[9:45] we referred to what would be called
[9:47] anecdotal faith last time where god does
[9:49] something for somebody and then their
[9:51] testimony we fixate on the circumstances
[9:55] and we think oh well that's how it has
[9:56] to happen for me instead of coming to
[9:58] the foundation of the hearing of faith
[10:00] being the reason why they were healed or
[10:02] the reason why god intervened for them
[10:05] and so in those sermons broken cisterns
[10:09] and the subject broken cisterns
[10:12] if you
[10:13] recognize what that sermon is about
[10:16] it's brother branham identifying the
[10:18] stagnant broken cisterns that are the
[10:20] denominations
[10:22] and so as a prophet here in early 1965
[10:26] he's having to point something out in
[10:28] the similar way
[10:29] that paul was doing it to the galatians
[10:32] and
[10:33] follow me in this he says when in
[10:34] reading the scripture this morning which
[10:36] all scripture is given by inspiration
[10:38] and we come to the house of lord for
[10:40] correction and for understanding is that
[10:42] what we come for correction and
[10:44] understanding and sometime that we see
[10:47] the any little thing in the way so now
[10:50] he's saying once we see something in the
[10:51] way something hindering and he uses this
[10:54] a military example like this military
[10:56] man a while ago
[10:57] was speaking to us and saying that some
[11:00] certain things that perhaps maybe in
[11:02] some other country has a certain missile
[11:04] or something on that idea and we've got
[11:06] to find something to counteract that in
[11:08] a military strategy
[11:10] now very possible as a cuban missile
[11:12] crisis or something and so there's these
[11:14] uh communists have
[11:16] missiles or they're they're building up
[11:18] their res their military resources and
[11:20] they're planning an attack and he's
[11:22] saying is from a military standpoint
[11:24] you've got to recognize how your enemy
[11:27] is equipped you got to recognize what
[11:29] they're trying to do maybe a certain
[11:31] missile and then you've got to find
[11:33] something as a strategy to counteract
[11:36] what your enemy is doing
[11:39] and and if you could just let your mind
[11:41] let that kind of develop very quickly in
[11:43] your mind because brother brown is going
[11:44] to draw on that and says well the same
[11:46] thing goes into a church
[11:48] military strategy
[11:50] missiles counter defense systems well
[11:52] he's saying the same thing goes into a
[11:54] church to a parish where a man is
[11:56] preaching or if he's an evangelist in
[11:57] the field
[11:58] when he sees uprisings in something
[12:01] that's just starting going it's infancy
[12:04] or whatever it is you want to you want
[12:06] to catch it in its infancy but just some
[12:08] uprising some movement whether it's just
[12:11] starting out or whatever it is he's
[12:12] saying that when he sees this if that
[12:15] man if he's a servant of god and we're
[12:17] going to focus on the the duty and the
[12:20] responsibility of a servant of god it's
[12:22] his duty if that man is a servant of god
[12:25] to block that thing so far from the
[12:28] people's minds that they'll keep away
[12:30] from it
[12:32] in the same way that an enemy to the
[12:34] united states could be could have some
[12:36] missile system so you come up with a
[12:37] defense system some strategy to block
[12:40] that thing away he says if a minister or
[12:41] man of god sees something going on
[12:45] out there some uprising some movement
[12:47] then he has a duty
[12:49] to block that thing from the people's
[12:51] minds that they'll keep away from it
[12:54] and it's not by
[12:56] it's not by preaching against so much as
[12:59] it is preaching for
[13:01] the best way the best way to be to be
[13:04] against the devil's to be pro-christ
[13:07] the best way to be anti-something is to
[13:09] be for something we we're we don't want
[13:12] to just be
[13:13] anti-anti-lies and anti-this and
[13:15] anti-that we just want to be for truth
[13:17] and that be our emphasis and so he says
[13:19] we don't want that to happen for us to
[13:21] get into places like that
[13:24] and and in this subject matter and what
[13:27] i'm doing in laying this foundation
[13:29] on the the the power of doctrine the
[13:32] importance of teaching and preaching
[13:34] i and as i mentioned before brother talk
[13:37] about we need to let loose of our faith
[13:39] and i believe it was last wednesday when
[13:41] he's we read the statement says there's
[13:42] nothing wrong with your faith
[13:44] it's just a matter of it being placed
[13:45] right and so we're approaching this
[13:46] subject so that our faith can be
[13:48] unhindered placed correctly
[13:51] and if i say undistracted
[13:53] there's so many voices going on in the
[13:54] world
[13:55] and so many missiles aimed at the
[13:57] believer and if we get our eyes on the
[13:59] missiles and we get our eyes on the on
[14:01] the uh all the other strategies and all
[14:03] the lies and all the counter arguments
[14:05] and all the counter cultures and
[14:06] everything that's taking place and and
[14:08] that's when our faith gets distracted
[14:10] and we need to put our faith in the word
[14:12] of god
[14:13] and remember we can emphasize divine
[14:15] healing and we want to see that
[14:17] principle of the word of god working
[14:18] within the church working within
[14:20] believers lives but what it stands for
[14:23] is a new body
[14:25] that's what it's an earnest of it's an
[14:26] earnest of the body change so
[14:28] we if we if we don't have enough faith
[14:30] for a toothache
[14:32] right we don't have enough faith for
[14:33] divine healing uh then we need to we
[14:36] need to be challenged on on whether or
[14:38] not our faith is actually maturing and
[14:39] growing to have faith to change our
[14:41] bodies
[14:44] now if you look at first corinthians
[14:45] chapter 14
[14:47] verses one to six
[14:50] and and i'll actually jump from
[14:52] uh verse two to another place in
[14:55] corinthians and we'll come back to this
[14:59] the
[15:00] yeah and if you'll just kind of stay
[15:03] real close to what i'm trying to express
[15:05] here because there's a lot in it to
[15:06] where i don't want to get caught up in
[15:08] too much of what paul is addressing
[15:11] um specifically and its applications and
[15:14] because there's so much a breadth to
[15:15] this
[15:16] but i want to just look at a principle
[15:18] and it's just neat how it kind of flows
[15:20] and there's a lot of touch points to
[15:21] what we're wanting to touch on says
[15:23] follow after charity and desire desire
[15:25] spiritual gifts but rather that ye may
[15:27] prophesy
[15:29] for he that speaketh an unknown tongue
[15:31] speak in an unknown tongue speaketh not
[15:33] unto men but unto god
[15:35] and so if in reading that you you want
[15:38] to be very careful what kind of attitude
[15:40] you have towards speaking in tongues
[15:43] if there's one thing that keeps coming
[15:44] back to me as i minister on these things
[15:46] is attitude seems to be
[15:48] the number one thing that we're wanting
[15:50] washed and that by orienting by having
[15:53] the right kind of position to it speaks
[15:54] of attitude towards something it's your
[15:56] orientation to it and so you want to
[15:58] have the right kind of attitude because
[16:00] you hear it saying a man speaks in
[16:02] unknown tongues and he speaks unto god
[16:04] and so you could speak against something
[16:06] and you're speaking against someone's
[16:08] language as they speak to god he says
[16:09] for no man understandeth him how it be
[16:11] it in the spirit he speaketh mysteries
[16:14] who's he speaking to though god so paul
[16:16] is looking at a genuine utterance of
[16:18] tongues and in prayer through worship
[16:21] that a a son of daughter of god or
[16:23] really anyone who the spirit can fall
[16:25] upon can begin to do and can begin to
[16:26] utter
[16:28] and now he says that you would rather
[16:30] may prophesy now prophesy can refer to
[16:33] foretelling future events it can even
[16:35] mean to predict
[16:36] but it also means to speak by divine
[16:39] revelation
[16:40] and it means prophesies to utter or to
[16:43] declare a thing which can only be known
[16:45] by revelation so if you're going to
[16:47] prophesy you don't prophesy your own
[16:49] opinions
[16:51] that's why if someone prophesies and it
[16:52] doesn't come to pass
[16:54] uh then then that's a there's a lying
[16:57] spirit because to prophesy is to put
[16:59] words in god's mouth
[17:01] and so if you're if you're just
[17:03] predicting or guessing prognosticating
[17:05] trying to say who's going to win the
[17:06] world series or something uh then you
[17:08] know god hasn't told you that
[17:10] and so if you that's not prophesying we
[17:13] may joke around a little bit about
[17:14] saying prophesying and prophesying and
[17:16] predicting
[17:17] but to to actually prophesy would be to
[17:21] if you're foretelling a future event is
[17:23] saying god has told me such and such is
[17:25] going to happen and you're foretelling
[17:27] something but then there's also another
[17:29] way it can be used that doesn't relate
[17:31] so much to prediction but rather
[17:33] speaking something that god has made
[17:35] known to someone
[17:37] paul touches on it in chapter 12 verses
[17:39] 1 to 3. now concerning spiritual gifts
[17:41] brethren i would not have you ignorant
[17:44] ye know that you were gentiles carried
[17:46] away under those these dumb idols even
[17:48] as you were led wherefore i give you to
[17:50] understand that no man speaketh by the
[17:53] spirit of god no man speaking by the
[17:55] spirit of god called jesus accursed and
[17:58] that no man can say that jesus is the
[18:00] lord but by the holy ghost
[18:02] so christ can only really be declared by
[18:05] revelation
[18:06] and that revelation cannot contradict
[18:09] the word so no man prophesying or
[18:11] speaking by the spirit of god would say
[18:13] jesus is accursed
[18:15] and so and no man can actually declare
[18:17] that jesus is the lord except by
[18:20] revelation of the spirit or do it by the
[18:23] holy ghost and brother branham uses this
[18:25] verse to say that it you can't just be
[18:27] saying what your mama said you can't
[18:28] just be saying what your daddy said you
[18:30] can't just be saying what the preacher
[18:31] said you've got to say yourself that
[18:34] jesus is lord by revelation otherwise
[18:37] you're just saying what somebody else
[18:38] said
[18:40] now
[18:41] just drawing pointing back to our title
[18:43] christ my healer this foundation for
[18:45] this subject
[18:46] i'm wanting to establish again the
[18:49] the basis for teaching
[18:51] and the the importance of preaching
[18:55] that but catch how that in doing that
[18:58] because i think they can almost stand on
[18:59] its own but looking at it in the context
[19:01] of divine healing it's establishing a
[19:03] basis for divine healing
[19:05] that there's a way that god makes his
[19:07] promise there's a way that god will
[19:09] bring it to pass
[19:10] and it's being touched on just in these
[19:12] things so if you could stay focused here
[19:14] we're going to come back to verse 3 of
[19:15] chapter 14.
[19:17] he says for he that prophesieth speaketh
[19:20] unto men to edification and exhortation
[19:23] and comfort so there's a speaking in
[19:25] tongues that one can do to god and it's
[19:27] in mysteries it's unknown to other men
[19:29] and it's part of a person's worship to
[19:31] god but he's talking about prophesying
[19:34] and there's a prophesying which is
[19:35] declaring what has been made known by
[19:37] revelation
[19:38] and watch he that prophesies speaks unto
[19:41] men to edify exhort and comfort
[19:44] so our benefit our strength any kind of
[19:46] building up by
[19:48] is done by communicating things that are
[19:50] known by revelation
[19:54] he that prophesies speaks to speaking to
[19:56] men to edify exhort and comfort so
[19:59] there's something divinely given and
[20:00] when that is expressed that's what
[20:02] builds up the person
[20:04] he that prophesied speaketh unto men to
[20:06] edification which is to build up
[20:08] promoting growth exhortation which is to
[20:10] encourage comfort which is to persuade
[20:12] but then also to calm
[20:15] and so it's a settling
[20:17] when someone is edified exhorted and
[20:19] comforted then they're stabilized
[20:22] they're plays they can grow so he that
[20:24] prophesieth speaketh unto men to
[20:26] edification and exhortation and comfort
[20:28] he that speaketh in an unknown tongue
[20:30] edifieth himself
[20:32] so there's some sort of uh encouragement
[20:34] that takes place when the person speaks
[20:36] and talks but he that prophesieth
[20:38] edifieth the church and i would he all
[20:41] spake with tongues but rather that he
[20:43] prophesied for greater is he that
[20:45] prophesieth than he that speaketh with
[20:47] tongues except he interpret that the
[20:50] church may receive edifying
[20:52] we know this has direct application to
[20:55] the gift of speaking in tongues and a
[20:56] gift of interpretation and how that can
[20:58] operate in the nine spiritual gifts in
[21:00] the church that one can speak in tongues
[21:02] and another prophesy and paul is saying
[21:04] that speaking in tongues
[21:06] you can even say here he's saying that
[21:07] one is good or one is great but it's
[21:09] greater to prophesy in other words have
[21:11] something
[21:12] spoken that everyone could receive and
[21:14] understand
[21:16] now
[21:17] let's look at verse 6 though
[21:19] because this is something where paul is
[21:22] this has application in a much broader
[21:24] sense than just the gifts manifested on
[21:26] a person who speaks in tongues and
[21:27] interprets now brethren if i come unto
[21:29] you speaking with tongues what shall i
[21:31] profit you
[21:33] except i shall speak to you either by
[21:35] revelation or by knowledge or by
[21:37] prophesying or by doctrine
[21:40] now what he's what he's touching on
[21:42] relates to more than just the gifts
[21:44] falling in a service that would anyone
[21:46] would be subject to and that someone
[21:48] could speak but it's relating to his
[21:49] office as a prophet and it's even
[21:51] applicable to what brother brown calls a
[21:53] new testament prophet which would be a
[21:54] minister or a preacher
[21:56] and of the revelation and knowledge and
[21:59] prophesying and doctrine there's a
[22:00] continuity and connection under these
[22:02] among these four different methods of
[22:04] speaking
[22:05] you could see that even how revelation
[22:08] it unveils god's mysteries and so
[22:10] revelation is something that discloses
[22:13] uh uh discloses something
[22:15] of uh on the way of prophesied
[22:17] revelation is disclosed to person then
[22:20] you prophesize disclosure of that
[22:21] revelation
[22:22] i have a revelation then one begins to
[22:24] prophesy what is divinely expressed and
[22:26] then as it speaks of knowledge and
[22:28] doctrine that could be those could be
[22:30] connected and that doctrine is connected
[22:32] to a gift to teach what is known or
[22:35] teach knowledge
[22:36] the teaching of teaching of what someone
[22:38] understands and there's a lot in this uh
[22:43] there's a lot in these words revelation
[22:44] knowledge prophesying doctrine there's a
[22:46] lot in that but let me just say
[22:48] revelation needs to be preached
[22:50] mysteries need to be preached
[22:52] they need to be understood they don't
[22:54] need to be made more mysterious but they
[22:55] need to be faithfully taught in the
[22:57] manner which the prophet taught them so
[22:59] that we could receive them in the same
[23:00] way that he received them by divine
[23:02] revelation and so knowledge needs to be
[23:04] preached and revelation needs to be
[23:06] preached and we need to have
[23:07] understanding as brotherhood says we
[23:08] come to church not just for correction
[23:10] but for understanding
[23:13] and teaching as we mentioned last time
[23:16] teaching settles us
[23:18] it's what settles us and establishes our
[23:19] faith
[23:20] and here is paul says that one if i
[23:23] unless i speak by revelation
[23:26] and something divinely inspired or by
[23:28] knowledge or by prophesying or by
[23:29] doctrine
[23:30] teaching is the setting forth of
[23:32] doctrine
[23:34] and brotherhood makes a statement in one
[23:35] place he says in any man that has not a
[23:37] doctrine has not a ministry
[23:40] so if you try to strip ministry and say
[23:42] you can't have doctrine you can't teach
[23:44] doctrine uh then a man doesn't have a
[23:46] ministry
[23:48] in first corinthians chapter 12 verse 8
[23:50] it says for to one is given by the
[23:52] spirit the word of wisdom
[23:54] and to another the word of knowledge by
[23:56] the same spirit
[23:58] so there's a word of wisdom that one can
[24:00] have because the spirit gives them the
[24:02] word of wisdom and another can have the
[24:05] word of knowledge by the same spirit
[24:09] now the word knowledge there believing
[24:11] one place is actually translated to
[24:13] science in the bible in the new
[24:15] testament
[24:17] and
[24:18] there's something that struck me and i
[24:20] want to be able to share this i'm very
[24:21] careful maybe just to share my personal
[24:23] the way it struck me personally
[24:25] but in this the spirit
[24:28] has given a word of knowledge
[24:30] so there are observations that can be
[24:32] made that the spirit quickens
[24:35] an understanding of
[24:36] that you see some it's observable
[24:38] conduct there's something taking place
[24:40] someone can be given the sp by the
[24:42] spirit a word of wisdom another the word
[24:43] of knowledge and so this word of
[24:45] knowledge has a lot of a lot of meaning
[24:47] behind it brother ram says that a man a
[24:49] pastor a man in a parish somewhere he
[24:52] says in a church where man is preaching
[24:54] or evangelist he says when he sees some
[24:56] uprising in something that's just
[24:58] starting and going in other words he
[25:00] observes something
[25:02] and when he observes it then he has some
[25:04] sort of duty to respond correctly in a
[25:07] way that blocks it from the people's
[25:09] minds
[25:10] and now this is the part that i would
[25:11] say
[25:12] for you just to consider a little bit
[25:15] it happens so often when the word is
[25:17] preached
[25:19] that something's exposed in our lives
[25:21] and we know nobody the preacher didn't
[25:23] know that at all like that was
[25:25] supernatural and sometimes the joke is
[25:28] that you know brother aaron has a bug in
[25:29] our home
[25:30] and or and there's different things that
[25:32] are said like this was just exactly what
[25:34] we were talking about this is exactly
[25:35] what we needed and that's the word
[25:37] discerning needs in your heart and needs
[25:40] in your life and don't we all love it
[25:42] when that happens
[25:44] and that's that that's the kind of the
[25:46] best way it takes place now there's
[25:48] times in our lives also that we have
[25:50] come into a church service
[25:52] and and uh the man standing behind the
[25:55] sacred desk
[25:57] is just hitting at something and
[25:59] punching at something that everybody
[26:01] knows he knows
[26:03] and he's trying to make a point
[26:05] anybody's ever experienced that before
[26:08] and hopefully not recently
[26:12] but there's something happening
[26:15] and you're sitting there going well
[26:16] that's just
[26:17] i just called him yesterday and asked
[26:19] him for advice
[26:21] and i remember one time
[26:23] i was i was privy to a situation where
[26:25] somebody somebody had called and asked
[26:27] for advice and i kind of escalated it to
[26:29] this other person who knew better and
[26:30] then that person who i thought knew
[26:31] better just decided to take it
[26:33] immediately to the pulpit another person
[26:34] came to me and said do you think they
[26:36] knew and i said you should probably just
[26:37] go ask them
[26:39] right that way i didn't have to i didn't
[26:40] have to get mixed up in it and it
[26:43] generally doesn't make someone feel good
[26:45] when their issue is broadcast over the
[26:47] pulpit
[26:48] and so i want to acknowledge that there
[26:50] is a level of unfaithfulness that a man
[26:52] of god can engage in when he has not
[26:55] fully surrendered to the will of god
[26:57] and finds the right way to address a
[27:00] need without harming
[27:03] inappropriately god's sheep or making
[27:05] the issue broader amongst amongst all
[27:07] the people so i'm saying that just to
[27:09] just identify that i understand that
[27:12] there's a way that knowledge can be
[27:14] abused
[27:16] but what i would like to also point out
[27:19] is let's not use that abuse to shield
[27:23] ourselves from ever letting knowledge be
[27:26] effective against us or for us for our
[27:28] benefit
[27:30] because we could paint it in a picture
[27:31] in such a way as well as long as we let
[27:33] the preacher know before he preaches
[27:34] he's duty-bound and obligated not to
[27:36] preach against it otherwise he's being
[27:38] carnal and i'm just going to say right
[27:40] now if i see it and god can anoint me to
[27:42] help you in it i'm not going to be
[27:44] afraid to speak it in love
[27:46] i'm not going to be afraid to touch on
[27:48] things and people say oh well he must be
[27:50] talking about this or he must be talking
[27:51] about that
[27:52] i'm not saying i'm not that i
[27:54] necessarily would be doing that but
[27:56] don't build up a complex in our minds
[27:58] where the man of god can't use knowledge
[28:01] quickened by the spirit to address needs
[28:03] in our lives
[28:04] don't you want him to do that
[28:06] because what you may not realize there
[28:08] may be a lot of things in our lives that
[28:09] are obvious to other people and all it
[28:12] takes is someone who's just got their
[28:13] eyes open to say oh my they need help
[28:15] they need wisdom and the spirit of god
[28:17] can move upon someone to use a word of
[28:20] knowledge to help you in your need and
[28:22] it's no less supernatural if they
[28:25] already knew about it ahead of time
[28:28] as long as it's the word that's doing it
[28:31] amen
[28:32] i've seen a lot of situations where
[28:34] people profess to have a word of
[28:35] knowledge
[28:36] and it's because they were told ahead of
[28:38] time but they say well the lord showed
[28:40] me and i'm like well you don't have to
[28:42] call me lord you can call me brother
[28:43] aaron
[28:48] so a servant of god brother says when he
[28:50] sees uprisings he has a responsibility
[28:53] catch this to observe
[28:55] and then study it out
[28:57] he has a responsibility to be observant
[28:59] a minister is not just locking himself
[29:02] in the room the whole time and just
[29:03] asking for some sort of random
[29:05] inspiration but he is to have some sort
[29:07] of contact and communication to listen
[29:10] and to hear and as you fellowship one
[29:13] with another as i fellowship with you
[29:14] there's things that are communicated and
[29:16] it's in that fellowship that things are
[29:17] inspired because you realize oh this is
[29:19] where they're coming from this is what
[29:20] they're feeling and a minister has a
[29:22] responsibility to observe and study it
[29:25] out in the word
[29:27] and the sermon the impersonation of
[29:29] christianity
[29:30] and i'll apologize as i read this if
[29:32] it's disjointed in the slides because i
[29:35] i was i messed up in my copy and pasted
[29:38] where i had brother branham saying
[29:39] something four or five different times
[29:40] in the same same passage and i went back
[29:42] i think i got it fixed but if it doesn't
[29:44] quite match up that was on me
[29:46] and the message the impersonation of
[29:48] christianity i hope this uh you can
[29:50] catch this and god likened the prophet
[29:52] to the eagle that would go up in the
[29:53] makeup of a prophet he is a seer
[29:58] that in the spirit climbs beyond the
[30:01] emotion of the church
[30:04] a brother shared with me a quote last
[30:06] week uh where it says where you see a
[30:08] church with a lot of emotions and the
[30:10] dancing and shouting praises usually
[30:11] there's a lot of backbiting and
[30:12] bitterness
[30:14] because it's emotions
[30:17] and he says he goes beyond the rhythm of
[30:19] the music he goes beyond the clapping of
[30:21] the hands he goes beyond the joy among
[30:23] the saints he goes beyond all that
[30:26] god brings them up into a realm alone
[30:28] alone
[30:29] then he opens his eyes
[30:31] and he lets him look around and see
[30:33] things that is to come this is brother
[30:35] i'm describing what happens to a prophet
[30:36] he's looking at ezekiel he says then he
[30:39] brings them back down among the members
[30:40] of the body to foretell them of what is
[30:43] in the making so god had took ezekiel
[30:46] high far up let him see around about 2
[30:48] 600 years think of it
[30:50] at least talk about what god did with
[30:51] ezekiel now watch this description a
[30:54] prophet is also a gift of knowledge
[30:57] a knowledge is like an attorney
[31:02] i hope everybody's listening
[31:07] knowledge is like an attorney who
[31:09] studies the books
[31:10] and when you go to hire an attorney to
[31:12] plead your case he's only taking what he
[31:15] knows
[31:16] do you recognize what brother branham
[31:18] has done
[31:19] profit equals attorney
[31:22] attorney equals profit
[31:24] i'm joking
[31:26] he's using a prophet has a gift of
[31:28] knowledge but he's looking at from a
[31:29] natural perspective
[31:30] a a prophet has a gift of knowledge well
[31:32] what how brother branham well you take
[31:34] an attorney who studies the law studies
[31:37] the books understands your case takes
[31:39] the the law which is the black and white
[31:42] and the letter of it then looks at your
[31:43] specific facts and he tries to find the
[31:46] precedent he tries to find the
[31:47] principles he tries to find all the
[31:49] different elements of your case and
[31:52] what's gonna what's going to help you
[31:54] and he has to go by what he knows
[31:58] you don't want an attorney who's just
[31:59] guessing
[32:01] it's like
[32:02] do you think i have a good case
[32:04] i'm not even sure what your case is but
[32:06] let's just go in there by inspiration
[32:07] and see what happens
[32:09] all right i went to law school got the
[32:10] degree we're just gonna wing it he says
[32:13] go about taking what he knows and you're
[32:15] you are paying
[32:17] oh you're paying you're paying for what
[32:19] he knows to present your case before the
[32:21] judge
[32:22] so it's based upon his knowledge his
[32:24] expertise
[32:25] what he understands and now a gift of
[32:27] knowledge in the bible is prophecy and
[32:29] recognize
[32:30] what he's referred to there's something
[32:32] already given and already established
[32:34] that the attorney goes to and uses to
[32:36] understand and apply to your life for
[32:39] your benefit and your situation he says
[32:41] that a gift of knowledge in the bible is
[32:43] prophecy which goes up and finds out
[32:45] these things that are to come and brings
[32:47] them back down but they must compare
[32:50] with the bible with the book
[32:52] if they're out of the book then they're
[32:53] not received because the judge judges by
[32:56] the book
[32:57] so you recognize the parallel that that
[32:59] there's a word that is given and the
[33:01] prophet can go into that but is whenever
[33:04] he comes back and he begins to prophesy
[33:06] it better line up with the book
[33:09] you see it so it must be on the word
[33:11] then the word of god has spoken before
[33:13] the foundation of the world
[33:15] it isn't god speaks and says something
[33:17] to the prophet at that time
[33:19] it is that the prophet catches what god
[33:22] has already said wow
[33:24] caught up to hear what god has already
[33:26] said it's already echoing in heaven for
[33:28] the word was before the foundation of
[33:30] the world god spoke the world and it's
[33:32] lame
[33:33] the word and it's laying way out
[33:34] stretched out in time and the prophet
[33:36] goes up and sees the time coming so it's
[33:39] only a gift of knowledge that he brings
[33:41] down and puts it on the paper
[33:45] i i
[33:46] i got more quotes on lawyers so if
[33:47] you'll just stay with me
[33:50] there's actually one where he says
[33:53] uh should i even say it because i know
[33:54] just give ammunition to somebody
[33:59] never mind
[34:03] that was kind of coaxing them out now
[34:04] you've identified them
[34:07] but there's a word that god had in his
[34:09] mind that is drawn out through time
[34:12] and he says the prophets went up and
[34:14] caught that
[34:15] and that's what you're reading
[34:18] this is the law book this is the
[34:20] precedent this is these are our case
[34:22] studies this is where we can go in and
[34:25] we have certain precedents that are
[34:26] established in our court system and
[34:28] someone when you write your brief out
[34:30] you can say well this is
[34:31] well-established law and this was
[34:32] decided by this circuit this was decided
[34:34] by that this was decided by the supreme
[34:36] court and in this case they looked at
[34:38] this and this is what they decided and
[34:39] it's applicable to this that's what
[34:40] we're looking at in the bible is god's
[34:42] precedent to say that he did this and he
[34:45] did that this is what he thinks and this
[34:46] is where he acts so as the prophet went
[34:48] up into another realm and caught the
[34:50] word and put it on paper now we as
[34:52] believers and even other men of god go
[34:54] right back to the source material and
[34:57] study it out
[34:59] so it can be made applicable to your
[35:01] situation
[35:04] there's a uh this is this is lawyerly
[35:06] advice
[35:07] you can time me i just i charge by
[35:09] increments of the an hour so if it's
[35:11] just 30 seconds you're going to get
[35:12] billed at an hour
[35:14] but when the answer you may want to know
[35:16] this the answer to the question can i
[35:18] sue is always yes
[35:23] always
[35:24] brother aaron can i suit yeah absolutely
[35:27] that's always the answer but the
[35:29] question is whether or not you would
[35:30] prevail
[35:31] on the merits why
[35:32] do i have a case and what's the
[35:34] likelihood that we would succeed or what
[35:36] are the weaknesses in my case or what
[35:38] are what are the defenses that someone
[35:39] may have
[35:40] if we sued them and so there's a lot
[35:42] more that goes into it and one thing
[35:43] you'll find if you try to figure out the
[35:45] law
[35:46] you may read the law say oh well that's
[35:48] just black and white it says if a person
[35:50] does this with malice a fourth thought
[35:52] takes another person's life by this by
[35:53] that that's murder in the first degree
[35:55] like that is so so black and white
[35:57] that's so easy then take a fact scenario
[35:59] and look at it and you're like
[36:01] okay
[36:02] that's where we get the gray from
[36:05] the law seems to be very clear but the
[36:07] way that one would apply it to their
[36:08] life can be hard
[36:10] it can be difficult and so what you you
[36:13] want you'd want to understand how it
[36:15] how it applies
[36:17] how has it been applied how has how has
[36:19] god honored that word how has it been
[36:20] used so i can fully understand it
[36:23] and so as brother branham uses this
[36:25] example knowledge is like an attorney a
[36:27] prophet is a gift of knowledge and a
[36:28] knowledge is like an attorney this is
[36:30] how god's servants operate
[36:33] they're driven to the word
[36:36] for the believer's benefit
[36:39] it's a burden i just i'll just testify
[36:41] personally it's a drive it's a burden
[36:43] there's there's certain things i will
[36:45] never be confused with the athletes that
[36:47] get up at four o'clock in the morning
[36:48] drink some egg yolk and then go run 15
[36:50] miles come back and eat you know take
[36:52] some whey protein and and are just
[36:54] constantly working out you'll never
[36:56] confuse me for that those people are
[36:58] driven to do that but i will say this in
[37:01] the same way that i'm driven to the word
[37:03] of god i can match any elite athlete
[37:06] because it's a drive that is that cannot
[37:08] be quenched it cannot be satisfied and i
[37:11] recognize it as something being beyond
[37:13] myself it's something supernatural and
[37:15] you literally all of you are literally
[37:17] pulling me into the word of god and i
[37:20] must be here and i must be sensitive and
[37:22] i must be hearing these things and i
[37:24] must understand the message and i've got
[37:25] to be sure i'm directly under the
[37:27] headship of the messenger of the hour i
[37:29] can't vary i can't make a mistake
[37:30] because souls are resting on this
[37:33] it's a drive and it's a burden you'll
[37:36] find that paul in second timothy chapter
[37:39] 2 verse 15
[37:42] he says he says this to
[37:45] to
[37:46] to timothy
[37:48] and
[37:50] ii timothy chapter 2 verse 15 study to
[37:52] show thyselves approved unto god
[37:55] a workman
[37:57] that needeth not to be ashamed rightly
[37:59] dividing the word of truth
[38:01] paul knew he'd be departing
[38:04] and in departing he knew there needed to
[38:07] be faithful men that could take what he
[38:09] was taught take what he taught and then
[38:11] rightly divide it
[38:13] so he tells them study to show thyself
[38:14] approved
[38:15] it's something that a man of god ought
[38:17] to do brother adam does say it in a few
[38:18] places that we all should study the word
[38:21] of god study it out he says
[38:23] study to show thyselves approved a
[38:25] workman that needeth not to be ashamed
[38:27] rightly dividing the word of truth in
[38:30] chapter four verse two preach the word
[38:32] be instant in season and out of season
[38:34] reprove rebuke exhort with all
[38:37] longsuffering and doctrine
[38:40] recognize all these different elements
[38:43] he's as we read to the young people here
[38:44] recently let no man despise thy youth
[38:48] he tells them neglect not the gift that
[38:50] is in thee
[38:52] but meditate upon these things give
[38:54] thyself holy to them that thy profiting
[38:58] may appear to all take heed unto thyself
[39:01] and unto the doctrine continue in them
[39:03] for in doing this thou shalt both save
[39:06] thyself and them that hear thee
[39:09] if you will study to show yourself
[39:11] approved rightly divide the word of
[39:12] truth preach the word be instant in
[39:14] season out of season reprove rebuke
[39:15] absorb with all long suffering give
[39:17] yourself holy to the things that you
[39:19] have heard give yourself holy to the
[39:21] message of the hour give yourself and
[39:22] take heed to yourself and teach it
[39:25] correctly continuing it then you'll be
[39:28] saved and others will be saved that hear
[39:30] thee
[39:33] this is groundwork for this the subject
[39:35] christ my healer
[39:37] trying to focus your attention to the
[39:39] word
[39:41] the basis for faith
[39:47] in the sermon the mark of the beast
[39:51] bibram says now all of the old
[39:54] all of the old the types the shadows
[39:56] christ in the shadow of the lamb
[39:58] god in the beginning knowing all things
[40:00] nothing has ever been predicted or put
[40:02] in the scripture but god already spoke
[40:03] it before the foundation of the world
[40:05] there's your idea of the word spoken
[40:06] drawn out prophets just come up and
[40:08] catch it he says the whole plan of god
[40:11] was laid out
[40:12] you believe it saint john the first
[40:14] chapter about the seventh verse and it
[40:15] says in the beginning was the word it'd
[40:16] be the first verse the word was with god
[40:18] and the word was god then what this
[40:20] bible it was is god before the
[40:23] foundation of the world
[40:25] the only reason it is written in here is
[40:28] prophets receiving from god for
[40:30] knowledge of his predestinated plan of
[40:31] the ages
[40:33] a lawyer studies the books to find out
[40:36] all the knowledge that he knows how to
[40:38] find out so he can give it to his client
[40:42] oh that's the way the prophets are the
[40:44] teachers are they study the word
[40:49] i just like how he's putting lawyers
[40:50] just right in the same breath
[40:52] as prophets and teachers i don't know
[40:54] why i'm just enjoying that
[40:56] he said that's the way the prophets are
[40:57] the teachers are they study the word
[41:00] first the prophet goes to god and the
[41:02] word comes down and he wrote it in the
[41:03] bible and now that was god's four
[41:06] ordained plan the prophet saw and he
[41:08] wrote it in the word
[41:10] so that the people following would be
[41:13] warned of situations and things to come
[41:17] so it's written it's here it's in the
[41:18] word of god
[41:20] now by inspiration that word was spoken
[41:22] by god by inspirations the prophets
[41:24] brought it
[41:25] and by inspiration we have to receive it
[41:29] it's not a material it's not a natural
[41:31] thing it's not the carnal mind listen
[41:33] the man in his carnal conditions can
[41:35] never understand it no way at all it is
[41:37] impossible for the spiritual things to
[41:40] be carnal mind for the spiritual things
[41:42] to the carnal mind is foolish
[41:44] it says the scripture and vice versa now
[41:46] we must be spiritual minded
[41:53] the word in the mind of god
[41:56] spoken before the foundational world
[41:57] laid out prophets go up and catch it
[41:59] bring it down that's given us the bible
[42:02] that's what the message of the hour is
[42:03] it's the mind of god opened up to us
[42:06] we've received his word
[42:08] and then we the people following are
[42:10] warned by that
[42:12] we receive something from it
[42:16] now in the same in the same channel
[42:18] recognize how brother branham addresses
[42:20] this in that day on calvary
[42:23] for i'm sure at this late hour that
[42:25] we're living we're seeking every
[42:27] importance of god that we can know
[42:30] and this time we're living and this is
[42:31] what we ought to be doing seeking every
[42:33] importance of god that we can know and
[42:35] all that we can find out and we're here
[42:37] to learn of it
[42:38] to see what it is for us and what god
[42:40] has done for us and see what his promise
[42:43] what he's promised to do for us
[42:45] you could just write that down as your
[42:46] expectation for every church service
[42:49] i'm coming to find out what's important
[42:50] to god i want to find out what we're
[42:52] here to learn what he ha what it is for
[42:54] us what god has done for us what he's
[42:56] promised to do for us and that's what we
[42:59] come to church for
[43:01] now that's what we come to church for
[43:03] what do we come to church for we're
[43:04] seeking important things from god for us
[43:07] to know
[43:08] and we want to we want all that we can
[43:10] find out we're here to learn of it to
[43:11] see what it is for us what god has done
[43:13] for us and see what he's promised for us
[43:15] that's what you're here for
[43:18] that's why you come to church and then
[43:19] brother branham in the next statement
[43:21] continue on that's what he's promised
[43:23] that's what we come to church for and
[43:24] that's why the preacher preaches
[43:27] why does the preacher preach because
[43:28] you're coming to hear important things
[43:30] of god you're coming to find out what
[43:32] his promises are for us today you're
[43:33] coming to to know all about it and what
[43:36] it is for us and and we want to learn of
[43:38] it and we want to know about it that's
[43:40] why he studies and meditates in the
[43:42] scripture and seeks for inspiration
[43:46] why because he's a public servant he is
[43:49] because he is a public servant to god's
[43:51] people
[43:52] and he's trying to find something that
[43:55] god would have to say to his people
[43:57] something that would help them
[44:01] that's what we come to church for is to
[44:02] have something that will help us
[44:04] there's probably not a worse feeling
[44:06] when you leave church than to feel like
[44:08] something was taken away from you
[44:10] when service is over
[44:11] i came with faith and i'm leaving with a
[44:13] little a little less i came with joy and
[44:15] i'm leaving with the little ass i came
[44:16] with heartache and now it's compounded
[44:18] and that's the worst kind of feeling
[44:20] when you come to church
[44:22] and because when you come to church
[44:23] you're coming to to find out what you
[44:27] need trying to find something that god
[44:28] would have to say to his people that
[44:30] would help them now he says it might be
[44:32] to condemn them in their sins
[44:34] but would be a help to raise them up
[44:37] and that they might forsake their sins
[44:39] and then raise up to serve the lord and
[44:41] ministered ministers should seek these
[44:44] things
[44:47] ministers should seek these things
[44:49] as a man would recognize
[44:52] little uprisings and things he'd want to
[44:54] he'd want to have the
[44:56] the wisdom of god to look into the word
[44:58] of god and find the things that will
[44:59] help the people
[45:02] that's why it and it's
[45:04] uh and i'm i i'm not necessarily
[45:06] thinking i'm not thinking of anything
[45:07] specific i'm just saying we've seen this
[45:09] pattern in our lives whether it be
[45:11] economic cycles
[45:13] and things start happening where the
[45:15] economy starts to fail a little bit and
[45:16] you're going to find seeky first the
[45:18] kingdom of god and the righteous are not
[45:20] forsaken and you're not going to be
[45:21] begging bread and there's a word that
[45:23] kind of comes along to match the present
[45:25] trial and stress that we're experiencing
[45:26] in the world whenever there's a global
[45:28] pandemic
[45:29] then there's a lot of ministry about
[45:31] divine healing and the protection and
[45:32] the promises of god why that's a
[45:34] minister of god reading the room seeing
[45:36] the things that are taking place where
[45:38] the sheep are at going through it
[45:39] himself finding comfort in the word of
[45:41] god and so a minister to seek the things
[45:43] that are relevant to the people
[45:47] could you imagine if if i was up here
[45:50] preaching about this dispute in
[45:51] kazakhstan
[45:53] you know in a village out there
[45:54] somewhere there's a raging debate among
[45:56] some people there and we're trying to
[45:57] figure it all out like what does that
[45:59] have to do with me brother aaron
[46:01] how am i going to benefit from it no
[46:02] just stick with me it's really
[46:03] interesting if you want that get find a
[46:05] podcast
[46:08] there's a there's a lot of stuff out
[46:09] there if you want to find out about all
[46:11] these irrelevant things that have
[46:12] nothing to do with our faith and are
[46:13] getting out of here but when we come to
[46:15] church we want to hear things relevant
[46:17] to where we're at so that we don't
[46:19] always stay here
[46:21] we want to leave
[46:24] fashion with my wife on different
[46:25] situations and
[46:27] we were talking about something in
[46:28] particular
[46:29] and i expressed it this way i don't want
[46:32] to go back to the way things were
[46:33] because the way things were got us where
[46:35] we are things need to change
[46:37] and that's sometimes what we need to
[46:39] hear at church is not just getting back
[46:40] and normalizing certain things we get
[46:42] back in the same routine and we feel
[46:44] like we're doing better but take a step
[46:46] back oh things might have seemed great
[46:48] but that cycle got you right back where
[46:50] you are now and you don't want to start
[46:52] another one the way things were got you
[46:54] where you are and sometimes what you
[46:56] need is to change what you're doing
[46:59] you need a complete change and a
[47:00] revolutionizing of where you're at your
[47:03] thought process and your experiences and
[47:04] what you're viewing and what you're
[47:06] feeding on because you don't want to
[47:07] repeat the cycles and that's why we come
[47:10] to church is not to ride the roller
[47:12] coaster and to go on the marigold go
[47:14] around and do it as a church where we're
[47:16] constantly in a cycle of the same old
[47:18] things the same script right the same
[47:21] move he played over and over and over
[47:24] again but we need something fresh from
[47:26] god that meets us where we're at takes
[47:28] us a step higher
[47:32] and that's what a minister does he seeks
[47:33] these things
[47:35] he says
[47:36] this is the burden of ministry
[47:38] this is the burden for men of god this
[47:40] is what the men of god in this church
[47:43] not just myself but the other ministers
[47:45] here this is how they feel
[47:47] and the sermon how can i overcome
[47:50] brother brown says now as we study this
[47:52] i love that it's not can i overcome
[47:58] i love a question
[48:00] that already assumes
[48:01] the positive
[48:04] a lot of ways we ask questions that it's
[48:06] uh that really the answer already
[48:10] has to accept a negative assumption
[48:13] so one of the trickiest questions that
[48:14] someone could ever ask somebody is have
[48:15] you stopped beating your wife yet
[48:19] because what it assumes you want to say
[48:21] no and it's like wait you haven't
[48:23] stopped
[48:24] no yes so you have stopped
[48:27] no
[48:28] and right because there's some negative
[48:30] assumption built into it
[48:32] and so brother braham is not saying why
[48:34] you can't overcome
[48:35] why can't you overcome you're saying how
[48:37] can i overcome it as soon as you can
[48:39] but it's a how
[48:41] says now as we study this my purpose of
[48:43] this is just not to come here to
[48:45] fellowship with you people which i love
[48:47] to do that
[48:48] but if i had a chance to do that i would
[48:50] come to your home and shake your hand
[48:51] and talk with you and sit down
[48:53] eat dinner with you and sit down under
[48:56] the shade tree and talk and fellowship a
[48:59] while that's your that's your family
[49:00] tree your home that you can invite
[49:02] someone into a fellowship under the
[49:04] shade tree but when we come here we are
[49:07] here for one specific
[49:09] purpose
[49:12] this is the house of correction
[49:14] this is the throne
[49:16] this is the throne of god and judgment
[49:18] goes forth from the house of god and
[49:20] here is where we come together gather in
[49:22] love with one another as only christians
[49:24] can love but in here we're under
[49:26] leadership of the holy spirit the holy
[49:29] ghost is among us and we're here to take
[49:32] reckoning among us to see where our
[49:35] short places are our shortcoming and how
[49:37] we can catch from where we should be
[49:40] over to where we ought to be now
[49:43] where we are and where we ought to be
[49:45] that's why we come
[49:48] come on
[49:51] catch our short places our shortcomings
[49:56] where we ought to be
[49:59] where we are and where we ought to be
[50:03] and that's what we study
[50:06] ministers study those places for their
[50:09] people
[50:10] when they see the people the lack then
[50:12] they begin on that
[50:15] how when they see it
[50:17] when they observe it when they recognize
[50:20] it
[50:21] and it goes back to the point i made
[50:23] earlier that it's not that the minister
[50:25] is in his study and he's studying he's
[50:27] like i've got a perfect congregation
[50:30] everything's perfect there's no problems
[50:31] at all we're a breath away from the
[50:33] rapture and all of a sudden it's like
[50:35] boom oh my goodness there's trouble
[50:38] i never saw this before right
[50:42] it's that's not the way that it works
[50:44] but he sees things
[50:47] and
[50:48] uh let me just acknowledge are you some
[50:50] of you may be thinking brand do you
[50:51] think we don't believe in divine healing
[50:54] what have we been doing no it's not that
[50:56] at all
[50:57] but there's things
[50:59] that i want to be direct on there's
[51:00] things that we need to preach
[51:02] and there's things that we need to
[51:04] not confront but address to loose our
[51:07] faith
[51:09] and i may not have to get specific but
[51:11] just by preaching the word it can do it
[51:15] that's what we study ministers study
[51:17] those places when they see the people
[51:18] the lack that they begin on that
[51:23] now
[51:24] i almost there's a part of me that would
[51:26] like to be able to go back and preach
[51:27] last wednesday in this and just
[51:29] methodically go back through all these
[51:30] little pieces because these are just
[51:32] foundational points
[51:34] when we begin to preach on divine
[51:36] healing that's it's specific for a
[51:39] reason for a purpose
[51:42] and there's things that the devil is
[51:43] going to try to do to confuse us
[51:45] there's things he's done to try to
[51:47] confuse us there's a little leaven that
[51:49] kind of gets sewn into our understanding
[51:51] about things and it just becomes the
[51:52] little hang-up
[51:54] just a small little hang-up something
[51:55] that's keeping us from walking fully in
[51:57] the promises of god there's ways that we
[51:59] think we're doing the right thing but
[52:01] we're actually hindering our faith by
[52:02] doing it
[52:05] and so we want our faith to be free
[52:07] in psalms 107 verse 20. i'm going to
[52:10] close with this scripture
[52:13] and i have a couple more statements just
[52:14] to share with you but we're closing here
[52:17] he sent his word
[52:19] this is this is the beginning for the
[52:20] next part maybe next wednesday night he
[52:22] sent his word and healed them
[52:25] and delivered them from their
[52:26] destructions that word is he sent his
[52:28] commandment he sent his blessing i think
[52:30] wesley when he commented on this
[52:32] he said he's sent his blessing
[52:35] he sent his word his command he was just
[52:36] speaking
[52:39] now hear me this is this is i'm stepping
[52:41] into the next
[52:42] these first two services
[52:45] have been very general
[52:48] but now this is the foundation this is
[52:49] the real core and foundation the basis
[52:51] for faith the basis of believing in
[52:53] divine healing
[52:55] the power to heal our soul
[52:58] to heal our spirits and heal our body
[53:00] lays within god's word
[53:02] because salvation of the soul that's
[53:04] deliverance of the soul from sin that's
[53:05] a healing the healing of the soul even
[53:07] the healing of our spirits and the
[53:08] healing of our body the divine healing
[53:09] of soul uh spirit and body lays within
[53:12] the word of god
[53:14] our perfection as paul chastised the
[53:16] galatians does not come by legalism or
[53:19] the works of the flesh but it comes by
[53:20] the hearing of faith and faith is grown
[53:23] by hearing the word of god
[53:26] faith comes by hearing the word and it
[53:28] grows by hearing the word
[53:30] and brother brahm says and what it takes
[53:32] to overcome all unbelief he says our
[53:33] faith he says now the initial and
[53:36] original way to receive any redemptive
[53:39] blessing is by hearing the word of god
[53:42] because faith cometh by hearing and
[53:45] hearing the word of god like the
[53:47] ministers preach
[53:50] when we when we go when you think about
[53:51] everything we've mentioned tonight how
[53:53] that's what a man does in his church
[53:55] where he's preaching he sees uprisings
[53:57] he thinks starting he sees whatever it
[53:58] is if he's a servant of god he wants to
[54:00] block things from the people's minds so
[54:02] they'll keep away from it
[54:04] we start going down that line of how
[54:06] that by knowledge he goes into the word
[54:08] of god and brings things out in the word
[54:09] of god and he studies things out in the
[54:11] word of god to bring to the people
[54:13] things that are already in the word of
[54:14] god he studies he rightly divides the
[54:16] word of truth he preaches the word he
[54:18] studies the books to find all the
[54:19] knowledge he digs into the message he
[54:21] studies the word and he brings it with
[54:23] inspiration you receive it by
[54:25] inspiration he studies and meditates the
[54:26] scripture that's why he preaches as he
[54:29] seeks these things and that's why he
[54:31] studies those places when they see the
[54:33] people where they lack they begin on
[54:34] that why because the preaching of the
[54:36] word of god is what god uses to meet
[54:39] your need
[54:41] that's what he uses faith cometh by
[54:43] hearing hearing of the word of god like
[54:45] the ministers preach so the initial in
[54:47] original way remember this the initial
[54:50] and original way to receive any
[54:52] redemptive blessing is by hearing the
[54:55] word of god the original way is to hear
[54:58] the word of god the initial way to
[55:00] receive any redemptive blessing is by
[55:03] hearing the word of god
[55:06] then what we want to hear is the word of
[55:09] god
[55:10] it's not we don't come to church to say
[55:12] ben robinson tell me a tale
[55:14] right we're not here to hear tales we're
[55:15] here to hear the word of god hearing the
[55:18] word of god is the initial and the
[55:20] original way to receive any redemptive
[55:23] blessing because faith comes by hearing
[55:25] hearing the word of god like the
[55:27] ministers preach
[55:29] we'll bring it out in other scriptures
[55:30] and other places in the message of the
[55:32] hour but i have one last statement
[55:34] musicians if you could prepare you could
[55:35] come as you're ready
[55:37] i don't have this for you in the slides
[55:40] i just want to read it to you as we
[55:41] close you could you could think on these
[55:43] things
[55:44] it's in the sermon i perceive that thou
[55:46] art a prophet
[55:48] just
[55:48] focus your faith still yet now as we
[55:51] close for no matter how much i would
[55:53] pray for you
[55:55] if you yourself didn't have the faith
[55:56] that wouldn't do any good
[56:03] it takes your faith
[56:06] and no matter how much i preach to you
[56:08] and how well i brought the gospel to you
[56:09] if you yourself it's your own personal
[56:12] faith in christ that saves
[56:14] you he says is that right
[56:17] i couldn't save you no matter how bad
[56:19] i'd want to
[56:20] i've got brothers that's not saved and
[56:22] i've tried my best and persuaded and
[56:23] cried and begged and tried to stand in
[56:25] the breach for them but they've got to
[56:27] have their own faith in god
[56:30] many of you christian people here have
[56:31] brothers and sisters and mothers and
[56:33] fathers and children and everything
[56:34] unsaved is that right he says raise your
[56:36] hand
[56:36] well you can't save them
[56:38] you can't do what christ has already
[56:41] done amen christ has saved them now the
[56:44] only thing they have to do is accept
[56:46] that salvation god's free gift
[56:50] remember in this sycamore salvation and
[56:53] divine healing are preached
[56:55] and he says now you couldn't heal them
[56:58] no other man could heal them
[57:00] [Music]
[57:01] they have to accept
[57:03] their healing is god's free gift to them
[57:06] he was wounded for our transgressions
[57:08] with his stripes we were healed
[57:09] then see there's nothing at all that you
[57:11] can do towards salvation or divine
[57:13] healing it's the individual's faith in
[57:15] christ
[57:17] that's
[57:18] that's that's solely where it rests
[57:22] it says it's your faith that saves you
[57:25] personal faith in christ
[57:27] your personal faith in christ that heals
[57:30] you and he says now
[57:32] to bring up this faith in christ
[57:35] how
[57:36] how are we going to have enough faith to
[57:38] be saved how are we going to have enough
[57:39] faith to be healed if it takes my own
[57:40] personal faith in god how am i ever
[57:42] going to have it to bring it up to build
[57:44] it up to cultivate it he says there are
[57:46] ministers
[57:47] he says that's the most important thing
[57:49] of the day as a good god-sent preacher
[57:52] i admire them and their gift is far
[57:55] beyond anything could be done in
[57:57] anything else is a preacher a man who
[57:59] knows how to rightly divide the word of
[58:01] god
[58:02] i know we might all be really really
[58:04] impressed with how well patrick mahomes
[58:05] can read a cover too and the safety's
[58:07] over the top and know how to audible out
[58:09] in the past run option i know we're all
[58:11] mesmerized by that but it's got nothing
[58:13] on a man of god who can rightly divide
[58:15] the word of truth he said it's a gift
[58:16] far beyond anything it could be done in
[58:18] anything else there's no amount of
[58:20] triple doubles quadruple quadruples or
[58:22] whatever could never come to the gift
[58:24] that is expressed when a man of god
[58:26] takes the word of god and rightly
[58:28] divides it
[58:29] it's the most wonderful gift in the
[58:31] world
[58:33] it's the most wonderful gift
[58:36] in the world
[58:38] it's the most wonderful gift in the
[58:39] world is to be a minister
[58:41] which was a new testament modern-day
[58:43] prophet a preacher
[58:45] prophesy means to foretell or to tell
[58:47] some personal thing in other words if
[58:49] you read the bible and start to tell
[58:50] then that's a preacher but prophesies to
[58:53] testify foretell he says all right now
[58:55] but catch this he says now and the
[58:57] spirit of christ is prophecy
[58:59] now in this church that we're living in
[59:01] today and the times that there are a
[59:04] minister can go forth and explain to you
[59:06] about salvation you accept it you'd be
[59:08] saved
[59:09] now the only thing that minister could
[59:11] do to save you would be explain it to
[59:13] you
[59:14] i know that maybe catches up on um
[59:17] some
[59:18] controversial language because we don't
[59:20] want to just explain something
[59:22] but it is in the teaching and setting it
[59:24] forth he says a minister can explain set
[59:27] forth rightly divide the word of truth
[59:28] and the thing that gonna save you is
[59:30] he's gonna explain to you now the only
[59:31] way a man could do to get you healed
[59:33] [Music]
[59:35] is to explain it out of the bible so
[59:37] perfectly that you would see it and
[59:39] believe it and accept your healing and
[59:41] be healed is that right that's the only
[59:43] way through preaching
[59:46] so how is our faith for our children how
[59:48] are they ever going to be saved when
[59:50] they hear the word of god preached and
[59:53] don't discount the sermons you can
[59:55] preach in your own home your own
[59:56] devotions you don't lift up the word of
[59:57] god in taking the things that you hear
[59:59] in the house of god and imparting them
[1:00:01] in the way that your children and our
[1:00:03] loved ones are going to be saved it's
[1:00:05] when the word of god is preached and
[1:00:07] they receive it
[1:00:09] and the same goes for divine healing
[1:00:11] [Music]
[1:00:13] not just explained in a carnal way but
[1:00:15] ministered in a way that rightly divides
[1:00:17] it brings clarity to it so perfectly
[1:00:19] that you see it believe it and accept it
[1:00:21] and then you're healed he says it's
[1:00:23] through preaching
[1:00:26] that's how that we're going to be healed
[1:00:28] is through the word of god because he
[1:00:30] sent his word
[1:00:32] and healed him
[1:00:33] god bless you let's stand together
