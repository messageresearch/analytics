[0:01] First Corinthians 15 47-49 it says
[0:05] the first man is of the earth earthy
[0:08] the second man is the Lord From Heaven
[0:13] as is the earthy such are they also that
[0:17] are earthy as is as is the Heavenly such
[0:21] are they that are also heavenly
[0:25] and as we have borne the image of the
[0:27] earthy
[0:28] so so today we bear that image of the
[0:32] earthy I think we could all testify of
[0:35] that with our getting old
[0:38] um tempers rise sometimes we get
[0:40] frustrated we get tired it's just normal
[0:43] human life things we bear the image of
[0:46] the earthy
[0:47] but we shall also bear the image of the
[0:51] heavenly
[0:52] and my message today is reflecting the
[0:55] heavenly
[0:56] so let us bow our heads
[0:59] Heavenly Father
[1:01] Lord
[1:03] first of all we just want to give you
[1:05] the things like always Lord
[1:07] thank you for everything that you have
[1:09] done for us and allowing us to be here
[1:12] whether
[1:13] either one of us whoever had a rough day
[1:17] had a good day we just thank you that
[1:19] you brought us through Lord Jesus and
[1:21] now we're in your presence and we just
[1:24] ask that you take control of this
[1:25] service father Lord we ask that you take
[1:28] the preeminence and allow your word to
[1:30] flow out that it may strengthen the
[1:32] believer and and help those that need
[1:34] encouragement father we thank you Jesus
[1:37] we give it all to your hands
[1:39] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we
[1:41] pray amen and amen
[1:43] you may be seated
[1:45] so it says that we have borne the image
[1:47] of the earthy but we will bear the image
[1:52] of the Heavenly and we notice in
[1:55] Genesis 1 26 how it says let us make man
[1:59] in our image we realize that a man has a
[2:03] dual
[2:05] something some two things are happening
[2:08] in a man
[2:09] he is he's bearing the image of the
[2:11] earthy which is our flesh which is the
[2:13] ground but when God created a man he
[2:16] created the spirit man first right and
[2:19] so he created that man and he said let
[2:21] him be in my image let him be in my
[2:24] likeness so when he says let him be in
[2:27] my image he's saying let him look like
[2:29] me
[2:30] let him reflect like me let him hit my
[2:33] son look like Dad right
[2:35] but then on Earth he Bears the image of
[2:38] the earthy which we can all like I said
[2:42] testify that's where our weakness comes
[2:44] from comes from that's where our our
[2:47] problems come from that's where all
[2:49] these things come from because we're
[2:50] tied to the Earth and God that's the way
[2:53] God made it
[2:54] God made it that way because God his
[2:57] purpose is to use man for Dominion he
[3:01] he's using man so that he could work on
[3:03] Earth through man
[3:05] because when God said let us create man
[3:07] in our image and in our likeness let us
[3:10] create them
[3:11] he said let them also have dominion
[3:15] he didn't say let me have dominion
[3:17] see brother Branham said that he was the
[3:19] god of the universe but man is the god
[3:22] of the Earth
[3:23] so so he gave this Spirit man the the
[3:27] opportunity the authority to rule over
[3:31] the Earth
[3:32] each and every man he gave him that
[3:35] opportunity that Authority but he gave
[3:38] it to the spirit man
[3:40] where the Earth is earthy
[3:43] the Earth is is full of calcium uh like
[3:46] brother Benham says potash atoms and all
[3:49] these things that's how the Earth is
[3:51] created
[3:53] so in order for man to have dominion on
[3:57] the earth he had to in Genesis 2 create
[4:00] the man out of the Earth
[4:02] so that the man could be in fellowship
[4:05] with God and he could be in contact with
[4:08] God yet he could go and he could touch
[4:11] the ground
[4:12] he could be that image or that
[4:15] representation of God to the ground to
[4:18] the Earth
[4:19] and that's the way God made men so that
[4:22] they could be that reflection of God to
[4:25] the Earth
[4:28] and we know that it's a very simple
[4:31] story we've heard it many times we know
[4:33] that Satan
[4:35] had his way
[4:37] Satan had his way and he he took the
[4:40] fellowship away from man and God to
[4:43] where what happened was the spirit and
[4:46] the flesh were separated
[4:49] so so the only way man what I realized
[4:52] in Genesis 1 26 is the only way man can
[4:55] have dominion is that he needs the
[4:58] spirit of God
[4:59] because he didn't tell the flesh man to
[5:01] have dominion
[5:03] he told the spirit have dominion
[5:06] that that he told that Spirit man you
[5:09] are going to rule you are going to have
[5:11] multiplication it's going to be you
[5:14] but whenever man sin whenever Satan uh
[5:17] put on put a breach between them
[5:21] he separated the man from the spirit
[5:24] so now you have this man without the
[5:27] spirit of God and and God that's the way
[5:30] he deals with man man is the vehicle of
[5:34] God
[5:35] man brother Branham said in the message
[5:38] Shalom he said you only have never seen
[5:40] me before
[5:41] I've never seen you you only see what's
[5:44] representing me
[5:46] and this this body right here
[5:48] but he says you've never seen me because
[5:50] we are a spirit the real you is not the
[5:54] the person struggling out there
[5:57] the real you is not the one that's
[5:59] having ups and downs and all of that the
[6:01] real you is settled in that Shekinah
[6:04] Glory no matter if the spirit sometimes
[6:07] is weak
[6:08] sometimes we have good days and we have
[6:11] bad days
[6:12] brother Branham says that we are a
[6:14] Triune being or he said that we are like
[6:16] the temple
[6:17] to where you have the outer courts the
[6:20] holies and then the holy of holies
[6:22] and the outer courts you're always going
[6:24] to have rain shine good days and bad
[6:26] days that's this this guy right here
[6:30] that's this flesh
[6:31] sometimes your emotions are going to go
[6:33] up and sometimes your emotions are going
[6:35] to go down that's your spirit
[6:37] that's that's the inner man but then
[6:40] there is the inside of the inside that
[6:43] will never fail
[6:45] it'll never fall because that that's
[6:48] where the real you is at
[6:50] that is the spirit man God says you're
[6:53] going to have the Dominion
[6:55] you're going to have that but but
[6:57] whenever they sinned God took away his
[7:00] Spirit from them
[7:02] to where they became brother Brown says
[7:04] man are animalistic now
[7:07] man it's a dog eat dog world now to
[7:11] where where people uh fight there's Wars
[7:14] and people kill and people hate and
[7:16] there's just so much going on and that's
[7:20] what happened but it's sadly that's
[7:22] normal to us now right we see that in
[7:24] the news we see that everywhere that's
[7:26] just how life is but that's not the way
[7:29] God intended it to be
[7:30] it's just sin separated and man began to
[7:35] be governed by the flesh
[7:38] and they tried to dominate or have
[7:40] dominion with the flesh
[7:43] and and then you see towers of Babel go
[7:46] up then you see these great kingdoms go
[7:49] up because they are being governed by
[7:52] their flesh or if you like to say by
[7:53] another spirit
[7:55] because the Bible says that we are
[7:57] temples of the Holy Ghost the Bible says
[8:00] that we are Earthen vessels holding
[8:03] treasure in our heart
[8:05] so so we are vessels not meant to be
[8:08] empty we're meant to be filled
[8:11] we're meant to to have a spirit guiding
[8:14] us every step of the way
[8:17] and and for for the bride that has
[8:20] reconnected to God reconnected with her
[8:23] husband she's governed by that spirit
[8:27] she's governed by the Holy Spirit
[8:28] wherever she goes that she's she's
[8:31] having dominion over the Earth again
[8:34] that was God's intended purpose
[8:37] and and that's we were just made that
[8:39] way our flesh was made that way
[8:42] um
[8:43] I I found this amazing
[8:46] study that um that of course we're all
[8:50] made up of atoms and and um
[8:54] and we have and in that atom the way
[8:57] it's formed is is there's a nucleus in
[9:00] in the middle right now I'm not gonna
[9:02] act like I know everything okay I'm just
[9:05] reading off of this if you ask me
[9:07] questions about this oh man I don't know
[9:09] well we're gonna have to Google it or
[9:11] something but atoms the way they're
[9:14] built is by a nucleus
[9:16] and around that nucleus there's
[9:18] electrons orbiting the nucleus okay and
[9:23] um the nucleus is about a hundred times
[9:26] smaller than the orbit of the electrons
[9:30] okay so if you imagine the nucleus as
[9:33] the head of a pin or or a pin head
[9:36] whatever you want to call it
[9:39] um the electrons orbit would be as far
[9:43] as a football field
[9:45] so so that's how much space from the
[9:48] nucleus to the uh the electron there is
[9:51] and this is just an atom okay but the
[9:54] the nucleus is so small and it's so far
[9:59] away from the electron that if you had a
[10:02] little Pinhead put it in between or
[10:04] inside of a football field it would be
[10:06] the space of a football field
[10:09] so it's got a lot of space
[10:11] okay
[10:13] the difference of atoms
[10:16] um the difference that makes atoms
[10:18] they're mostly empty space
[10:22] okay now atoms everything is made up of
[10:25] atoms okay you see this this is made up
[10:29] of atoms you see me I'm made up of atoms
[10:32] nobody can say this this isn't really
[10:35] real
[10:36] this isn't really here
[10:38] because you could see it I could touch
[10:40] it you could hear it
[10:42] but it's made up of these atoms that are
[10:45] mostly empty
[10:46] they're empty space okay and um
[10:50] it says that
[10:52] that in fact that there are about
[10:54] quintillion times more empty space than
[10:58] actual stuff in atoms
[11:01] that's how empty an atom is
[11:03] I started to realize that I realized how
[11:06] empty an atom is and how empty we are I
[11:09] say man we are meant to be dwelt in
[11:13] we are meant to be uh vessels of
[11:17] something and then I started to realize
[11:19] that a man is made up of of soul body
[11:23] and spirit
[11:24] you have two-thirds already that is
[11:27] Spirit
[11:28] so you're mostly made up of spirit your
[11:31] spirit and your soul
[11:33] and and then you have your body
[11:35] so so what governs or what what has no
[11:38] Dominion or what has the the preeminence
[11:41] is the spirit
[11:43] your body your body is just the fruits
[11:46] of what's inside right so so when when
[11:50] we feel when our body doesn't feel so
[11:52] good remember that's not you
[11:55] remember when things are are going on
[11:57] there's times of Life whatever is going
[12:00] on remember that's not you the real you
[12:04] has been bought with the price
[12:06] the real you has been tooken out of God
[12:10] that's the real you
[12:12] this body is going to fall it's going to
[12:15] get back up it's gonna hurt the spirit
[12:17] is going to be happy it's going to be
[12:19] sad but the real you is the peace of God
[12:23] inside of you and I realize that
[12:25] everything is empty space that makes me
[12:28] realize that there is a greater reality
[12:30] out there also
[12:32] that that that if somebody told me now
[12:35] this isn't really real or this isn't
[12:38] really there they would be more right
[12:40] than I would be
[12:41] just because of the empty space in the
[12:43] atoms and all all I'm feeling is
[12:47] electrical charges
[12:49] and and and that's what I'm feeling but
[12:52] in reality this is more empty than it's
[12:55] physical
[12:56] and that there is a greater reality
[13:00] outside
[13:02] of our dimension of thinking our
[13:06] dimension of the world our our
[13:07] everything our seat tastes feel smelling
[13:10] here
[13:11] so
[13:13] so of course the the devil he
[13:16] he separated man from God simple
[13:19] we know this story man brother Branham
[13:22] says they became Wanderers
[13:25] they became and what happened is is at
[13:28] like Abraham he began to find or try to
[13:32] look for a city
[13:33] whose Builder and maker was God
[13:36] he was trying to find back that image or
[13:39] that heaven
[13:41] he was trying to find back what he lost
[13:44] in the beginning and and and when the
[13:48] natural man the man that wasn't uh
[13:50] called by God when he was separated from
[13:52] his creator what he began to do was
[13:55] create idols
[13:57] because he was trying to find images to
[14:01] reflect a god
[14:02] they were trying to find something that
[14:05] would reflect something that they knew
[14:07] was there brother Branham says when the
[14:09] pilgrims came to to America they found
[14:12] that the Native Americans they were
[14:14] worshiped worshiping the sun god
[14:17] because they knew that that for some
[14:20] reason maybe that represented all of of
[14:23] creation
[14:24] the Creator so they would begin to
[14:27] worship the creation they would build up
[14:29] caps and they would do all these things
[14:31] so that they could say oh this is the
[14:34] image of God
[14:35] but in the reality man and women were
[14:39] meant to be the image of God
[14:42] we were supposed to be the likeness of
[14:45] God
[14:46] but they lost that and they tried to
[14:48] find God
[14:50] they tried to find an image of God a
[14:53] representation on Earth that reflected
[14:55] heaven
[14:57] but they couldn't find it anywhere so
[14:59] they started to build all these things
[15:03] and and even
[15:05] when God gave
[15:07] the forefathers when he gave the
[15:10] children of Israel the word it was still
[15:13] brother brown or the Bible says it was a
[15:16] shadow
[15:17] so it was the law but it was still a
[15:20] shadow or a shadow of of a reality out
[15:23] there
[15:24] it was a reflection of something else
[15:28] so even then they they had something
[15:31] that was quite not it
[15:33] and then they could not grasp it the way
[15:36] they wanted to grasp it because
[15:39] it was just a shadow
[15:41] but even though man and God were
[15:44] separated God was still there
[15:48] the Bible says that that God when he
[15:51] spoke or what brother Brandon said when
[15:53] he spoke the logos came out
[15:56] and when the logos came out that was the
[15:58] word
[15:59] that was the theophany or that was the
[16:02] spirit of God that was Christ
[16:05] and that that word cannot return to him
[16:09] void it did not return to him
[16:11] it began to work on the earth and it
[16:13] began to hide it himself in types
[16:16] Shadows it would hide itself in people
[16:21] you see Moses standing in the breach for
[16:23] his people
[16:25] what was he doing he was reflecting the
[16:28] image of Christ
[16:29] whenever God says I'm going to destroy
[16:32] all of Sodom and Gomorrah Abraham begin
[16:35] to intervene for the people
[16:37] what was it it was a shadow of an image
[16:41] it was a shadow of God and there was God
[16:45] hiding himself
[16:47] there was the logos there hiding himself
[16:49] creating images
[16:51] to show the people that there was a
[16:54] greater thing that was going to come
[16:57] brother Branham says the perfect image
[17:01] was Jesus Christ
[17:04] he was the god man and he finally came
[17:07] and it was God and morphe brother
[17:09] Branham says it was changed from the
[17:12] supernatural to the Natural or and he
[17:15] says he had or here in the Masterpiece
[17:18] he says the Perfect Image the God man
[17:20] God in morphe had changed from the
[17:23] supernatural to the vision
[17:25] and the vision was projected into the
[17:29] image
[17:30] and the image was smitten so that
[17:33] Supernatural could taste the feeling of
[17:36] death
[17:37] that's amazing
[17:39] that's amazing to where where the
[17:42] reflection
[17:43] whatever reflects Heaven whenever God
[17:46] uses man then you are his hands
[17:51] when he when you breathe air when you
[17:53] smell the flowers it's him
[17:56] when you cry when you cry for somebody
[17:59] it's him intervening for somebody
[18:02] and when Jesus came down he was that
[18:05] Perfect Image
[18:06] to where God says this image is going to
[18:09] die
[18:10] and Supernatural is going to be able to
[18:13] taste death
[18:16] that was God in his Tabernacle
[18:19] brother Branham says in things that are
[18:21] to be he says now now remember but these
[18:24] things are only temporal gifts in type
[18:28] we know that Moses in a building in the
[18:30] Tabernacle in the wilderness or
[18:32] preparing it he said he made all things
[18:35] in the order of what he saw in heaven
[18:40] see so the earthy things Earthly things
[18:43] only express the Eternal Things Are
[18:48] so everything on Earth
[18:50] brother random says that that everything
[18:53] on Earth reflects heaven
[18:56] the trees they reflect brother Brown
[18:58] says reflect the Tree of Life
[19:01] when you see the rock it was the rock
[19:03] smitten
[19:05] when you see everything on Earth
[19:07] reflects heavenly
[19:09] and he said if this Earth that we live
[19:12] in today being so great
[19:14] and we love it and we love to live and
[19:17] breathe air and see Flowers and Things
[19:19] if that if this is here is the
[19:23] expression of one that's dying is only
[19:27] expression of one that's eternal
[19:30] and when you see a tree struggling
[19:31] pulling trying to live that means
[19:34] there's a tree somewhere that doesn't
[19:37] have to do that
[19:39] so so we see that that Moses when he
[19:43] created the Tabernacle it reflected
[19:45] everything that was in heaven
[19:47] so so what I love about that is anything
[19:50] they did
[19:52] any purpose that was made in the
[19:55] Tabernacle where where um
[19:57] lamb was slain where there had to be a
[20:01] sacrifice
[20:02] that sacrifice was representing
[20:05] something in heaven
[20:07] and it allowed them to be covered by
[20:11] that sacrifice because whatever was
[20:14] being done on that place was being done
[20:16] in heaven the Bible says whatever you
[20:20] loose on Earth is loosed in heaven
[20:21] whatever you bind on Earth is bound in
[20:23] heaven
[20:25] also Jesus prayed Let It Be or he says
[20:28] thy will be done on Earth as it is in
[20:30] heaven
[20:31] so everything that is on Earth and and
[20:34] everything that happened in that
[20:36] Tabernacle was happening in heaven
[20:39] it was a reflection
[20:42] but when Jesus died
[20:44] he was that Perfect Image
[20:47] yes brother Branham says that he was a
[20:49] diamond
[20:50] he was a diamond that was tooken out of
[20:52] the Earth
[20:53] he was it's the same thing that was Adam
[20:56] that second Adam had to do the same
[20:59] thing
[21:00] he he had the full spirit of God
[21:03] yet he had to come from the dirt
[21:06] and then brother Branham says that
[21:08] heaven and earth embraced them
[21:11] so there had to be an embracing once
[21:14] more
[21:15] and brother Branham typed him to a
[21:17] diamond
[21:18] that that diamond was tooken out of that
[21:20] ground
[21:21] and when that diamond that diamond began
[21:24] to be cut
[21:26] and what happens when a diamond is cut
[21:28] it begins to reflect pictures we begin
[21:32] to reflect colors
[21:35] and so every time that diamond was cut
[21:37] the colors started to come out
[21:40] brother Branham says that the seven
[21:42] spirits
[21:44] of God was in heaven he was holding the
[21:47] Seven Stars in his hand
[21:50] and he said those Seven Stars reflected
[21:53] the seven Messengers there were seven
[21:55] spirits there were seven Church ages
[21:58] and so there was they were there in the
[22:01] seven Church ages and whenever the great
[22:03] big diamond began to be cut
[22:06] it began to produce the bride
[22:09] there will begin to be a reflection the
[22:11] Eternal Light began to shoot right
[22:13] through him and as he cried out in in
[22:16] Calvary
[22:17] he began to shoot out those seven colors
[22:21] which was the Bride of Jesus Christ
[22:24] and that bride she is the reflection of
[22:28] Jesus Christ
[22:30] so every beating and every bruise that
[22:33] diamond took the bride was being formed
[22:37] and in Revelations 5 if you want to take
[22:40] it it's that's where it says that the
[22:42] throne preceding Lightnings and
[22:43] thunderings and voices
[22:45] there were seven lamps of burning fire
[22:48] Before the Throne which were the seven
[22:50] spirits of God
[22:52] brother Branham says in Revelations
[22:54] chapter 4 the part three he says where's
[22:57] the Holy Spirit
[22:59] here at the throne shining out in every
[23:03] in each age
[23:04] this church age is reflecting back this
[23:08] way the voices voices of God Jesus
[23:11] Christ the same yesterday today and
[23:13] forever see seven there was voices seven
[23:17] lamps on fire seven spirits which are
[23:19] the seven spirits of God the seven
[23:22] Church ages begin to reflect
[23:24] and and of course we see that on Earth
[23:28] that Jesus died but In Heaven There was
[23:31] that reflection going on in heaven
[23:33] that's why when John he saw the line of
[23:37] Judah what was it it was the lamb slain
[23:40] and that Lamb slain that Lamb slain was
[23:43] holding the spirits
[23:45] of God so everything that was in heaven
[23:48] now is reflecting to the bride
[23:50] and we're reflecting everything that is
[23:53] in heaven
[23:54] now um
[23:58] there's this there's a study now here's
[24:00] another
[24:03] um thing that is above my pay range but
[24:05] I'm gonna talk about it because I
[24:07] understand that everything
[24:10] that is true science has to reflect the
[24:13] word
[24:14] not something that tries to contradict
[24:16] the word true science
[24:19] true mathematics will always reflect God
[24:23] and I started to think about quantum
[24:26] physics
[24:27] and quantum physics is a type that helps
[24:30] us understand the very small building
[24:32] blocks of our world like atoms particles
[24:35] and even tinier than atoms and it
[24:38] introduces some strange ideas
[24:41] so there's an A A Thing Called quantum
[24:44] entanglement
[24:46] where they begin to to realize well I'm
[24:49] just gonna
[24:50] I'm gonna simplify it for me okay
[24:53] but it's he it says think of two gloves
[24:56] okay you put one in one box and the
[25:00] other one far away in another box and
[25:03] whatever you do
[25:04] to one glove instantly affects the other
[25:09] no matter how far apart they are
[25:12] the and and the particles can become
[25:15] linked in a similar mysterious way
[25:18] so these particles that are tinier than
[25:21] atoms that you that see there's there's
[25:24] a point
[25:26] in in in smallness if you'd like to say
[25:29] where you can cut in half and cut in
[25:31] half and cut in half but there's a point
[25:33] where you can't cut in half anymore and
[25:35] it becomes it's it's it loses its
[25:38] locality
[25:40] and so what happens is is there begins
[25:43] to be two particles or two things that
[25:45] begin to mimic one another
[25:48] and this great thought of that that the
[25:52] scientists have found now you see the
[25:54] movies
[25:55] trying to replicate it right you see all
[25:58] these Multiverse movies and all of that
[26:00] where one person's living a life here
[26:03] and then they're living another life
[26:04] over here and all they're they're doing
[26:06] is is they're mimicking what science has
[26:09] found
[26:11] that that that there is the scientists
[26:15] are saying maybe there's an alternate
[26:17] reality
[26:18] there's another use somewhere
[26:21] and what they think is there's another
[26:23] you in another reality
[26:26] doing something else living another life
[26:29] and maybe they're they're doing
[26:31] something that made it they made a
[26:34] different decision than you made in the
[26:35] past
[26:36] so they're living another life
[26:39] and you're over here living your life
[26:40] and the scientists are realizing hey
[26:43] this looks very plausible
[26:46] because of how these two particles
[26:49] they're acting in sync
[26:52] but what what I understand is that these
[26:55] particles they're acting in sync they're
[26:58] not living other lives
[27:00] and brother Branham he says this
[27:03] he says what what you are as I said in
[27:05] the beginning
[27:06] what you are somewhere else is what you
[27:10] reflect here
[27:11] see scientists are saying you're living
[27:13] another life but brother Branham says is
[27:15] whatever you are over there you're
[27:18] reflecting it here
[27:20] so we're reflecting something else
[27:23] we're a reflection and we're not we're
[27:25] not living separate lives but we're
[27:27] reflecting he says what you are what's
[27:29] your Celestial Celestial or terrestrial
[27:32] body is up yonder
[27:35] what your Celestial body is somewhere
[27:38] else is what you're reflecting back here
[27:42] he says the in in prisoner he says the
[27:45] physical has to die
[27:47] but if you are reflecting by your mortal
[27:49] life the light of heaven then you're
[27:52] reflecting
[27:53] eternal life God
[27:56] so so no matter what we're gonna have to
[27:58] die
[27:59] because we were made from the dust and
[28:02] the dust was cursed
[28:04] God cursed the snake God of course it
[28:07] wasn't a snake we're not going to go
[28:08] into that right now but God cursed the
[28:10] serpent
[28:12] God cursed Eve
[28:14] but we're like God didn't curse Adam
[28:17] he did the worst thing
[28:20] God cursed the ground
[28:22] and we are all made of the ground
[28:25] that was the greatest cursor when he
[28:27] said curse it be the ground all of Earth
[28:31] fell
[28:33] and we are part of that curse down
[28:36] we are part of those calciums we are
[28:38] getting old we're getting tired
[28:41] what we're living in a curse
[28:43] and our mortal body has to die but
[28:46] whenever you receive that eternal life
[28:49] in you you begin to he says reflect the
[28:53] Heavenly reflect or that you're
[28:55] reflecting eternal life you're
[28:57] reflecting God now
[29:00] okay
[29:02] he says
[29:04] then then he says something else that
[29:06] really caught my attention here
[29:09] he says
[29:10] when you die you can no more go to that
[29:13] lie because that's what you've reflected
[29:16] if you are of the Dark World you reflect
[29:20] that
[29:21] you can do
[29:24] um go no other way but to reflect
[29:26] Darkness see so we are in a reflection
[29:30] so we see that as sure as the Holy
[29:32] Spirit reflects light and life so does
[29:35] death and dark Death reflect Darkness so
[29:38] so no matter what the world those that
[29:41] reflect or that reject the word they're
[29:44] reflecting something else
[29:46] the the bride she's reflecting something
[29:50] else in heaven
[29:51] he says eternal life God
[29:54] you're reflecting another reality
[29:57] that's why that brother that we're
[29:59] living in a shadow if you want to call
[30:02] it we're living in a hologram
[30:04] why because atoms they're more empty
[30:07] than full
[30:09] so so and and the Bible says that the
[30:12] things that are seen were created from
[30:14] the things that were unseen
[30:17] brother Brown says the Unseen
[30:19] Supernatural he says
[30:21] so there's a greater reality out there
[30:25] greater
[30:27] so we see each other and we think this
[30:29] is all it this is life this is reality
[30:31] but there is a greater reality that
[30:33] created
[30:35] this hologram
[30:37] this this thing that we think is a
[30:39] physical life that we think oh man this
[30:42] is everything no
[30:44] that's why for the bride you start
[30:47] thinking of worldly Ambitions and it's
[30:49] good to to
[30:52] you know to love what you do and all
[30:54] these things but the bride realizes
[30:56] there's a greater reality out there
[31:00] and and not not that we're just supposed
[31:02] to leave
[31:04] but we're supposed to reflect it
[31:07] in this this life that we think is is uh
[31:12] is so real we're supposed to reflect the
[31:15] real reality because he says have
[31:17] dominion
[31:19] multiply
[31:21] and and when Jesus died that's what he
[31:23] did
[31:24] he says unless the corn of wheat fall or
[31:29] uh in the ground
[31:31] it has to fall so that it can multiply
[31:35] and that's all we're doing we're
[31:37] multipliers
[31:38] that that's what brother Branham says
[31:40] that that we are a womb
[31:43] and when the spirit of God comes then we
[31:46] multiply that's that's all a human being
[31:48] is is a multiplier
[31:51] so we're reflecting something greater
[31:54] and and those that are in the world
[31:58] in another place they're reflecting
[32:00] something else brother Branham talked
[32:01] about one time he was in JCPenney and he
[32:04] started walking and he sees an image
[32:07] that scared him
[32:09] he saw two Hispanic women with with uh
[32:13] makeup all over that wasn't the scary
[32:16] part where she says sometimes it you
[32:19] know it would scare him but that wasn't
[32:21] the scary part
[32:22] the scary part is it brought him back to
[32:25] when he was a child
[32:27] and whenever he went to hell
[32:30] he saw those same women
[32:32] now you're talking about years and years
[32:35] and years after
[32:37] he sees those same women in the JCPenney
[32:40] mall but when he was a kid he sees them
[32:43] and he sees those great green things
[32:46] under their eyes he said that wasn't
[32:48] makeup he says those were cankers and
[32:51] sores
[32:52] but now in their life they put it on
[32:55] because they they want to look pretty
[32:58] not knowing they're reflecting
[33:01] what he saw over there in the Dark World
[33:04] right
[33:05] so so there's a reflection going on here
[33:09] and our life is just bearing the fruits
[33:13] bearing the fruits of what's out there
[33:16] that's why I praise God because Jesus
[33:19] Christ died for specific people
[33:23] he died for the whole world but there
[33:25] was only one person that was going to be
[33:28] able to bear that image
[33:30] of Jesus Christ and that was the Bride
[33:33] of Jesus Christ
[33:34] and the amazing thing is that call is
[33:36] for anybody
[33:39] but there's just a few that are going to
[33:41] answer that call
[33:43] brother Brown says he in in who is this
[33:46] Melchizedek he says you bypass the
[33:48] theophany and became flesh man
[33:51] so we bypass that Heavenly bearing that
[33:54] heavenly
[33:55] to be tempted by sin and then if this
[33:58] Earthly Tabernacle the shadow this
[34:01] reflection be dissolved we have already
[34:05] we have one already waiting
[34:07] we have not yet the bodies but look see
[34:12] this body receives the spirit of God The
[34:15] Immortal Life inside of you and it
[34:16] throws this body subjection to God
[34:20] so when you receive the Holy Ghost what
[34:22] happens maybe we begin we were burying
[34:26] the the fruit or the the image of the
[34:29] earthy we were going out to the world we
[34:32] were doing all these things but whenever
[34:34] you receive the spirit of God it throws
[34:36] this body into subjection
[34:39] see our bodies are Vehicles is God's
[34:43] license on Earth
[34:45] the way God moves is through you
[34:49] the way God if he needs to touch
[34:51] somebody it's through you
[34:54] one of the greatest
[34:56] things that brother Branham said I think
[34:57] it was a spoken word is in the Original
[34:59] Seed he said that that
[35:02] Paul he saw the pillar of Fire
[35:05] now imagine that
[35:07] we're privileged to have a picture of it
[35:11] now now for me I started to think how
[35:14] amazing that is because we see a picture
[35:16] and that's amazing but once you start
[35:18] getting into really that picture that
[35:22] picture is From Another Dimension
[35:25] that picture is is from a greater
[35:28] reality
[35:29] and he he was able to show himself for a
[35:33] second
[35:34] but then here see Paul sees that Pillar
[35:37] of Fire
[35:38] and that pillar he said who are you Lord
[35:43] and of course he said I'm Jesus
[35:46] I'm the one that you've been persecuting
[35:50] now this is Jesus Christ himself
[35:55] imagine that
[35:57] face to face with Paul
[35:59] I say praise God
[36:01] Paul
[36:03] man that man was something else
[36:05] where God himself in the pillar of fire
[36:08] would say hey I got a message for you
[36:10] man
[36:11] I gotta talk to you
[36:13] yeah I died I rose up again but I'm
[36:16] gonna come back
[36:17] and I'm gonna talk to you in the form
[36:19] that I want to talk to you in
[36:21] there was a reason why he he talked to
[36:24] him that way because Paul knew the
[36:26] pillar of Fire
[36:28] Paul recognized it he knew that was the
[36:31] angel of the Covenant he knew that was
[36:33] God leading the children out of Egypt
[36:36] so when he saw him automatically the
[36:39] scriptures begin to come and that
[36:41] revelation
[36:42] hit and he said Lord
[36:44] who are you he said I'm Jesus the one
[36:47] who you persecute
[36:49] now Jesus could have gave him everything
[36:52] that he needed right there
[36:54] because it was Jesus he is the source of
[36:57] life he is everything and Paul he needed
[37:00] some stuff first he needed to be healed
[37:03] he needed to be prayed for
[37:05] he needed the Holy Ghost
[37:07] he needed a lot of things
[37:11] he needed a conversion in his life
[37:13] because he he wanted to destroy the
[37:15] Christians
[37:18] he could have got that from the source
[37:20] itself
[37:22] but God uses bodies
[37:26] God uses you and I
[37:29] so God could have said here this is
[37:31] everything you need and also here you're
[37:33] you're healed no he said go to a man
[37:36] named ananias
[37:38] go to that man and he will lay his hands
[37:41] on you and you'll receive everything
[37:44] that you need
[37:45] brother Branham also recounts the story
[37:47] of of the eunuch and Philip
[37:50] how brother Branham says that Philip had
[37:52] been with the with all the doctors the
[37:55] DDS and the pH whatever he's been with
[37:59] all of them
[38:01] that means that he was given theology he
[38:04] was given all the the knowledge that he
[38:06] needed yet he lacked the revelation
[38:10] he needed something else and and the
[38:13] Bible says brother Branham says in the
[38:15] spoken word he says that an angel led
[38:18] him to go there
[38:19] brother said he couldn't use that angel
[38:21] though
[38:23] because the the The Germ has to come
[38:26] from the body
[38:27] that eternal life has to come through
[38:30] you and I
[38:32] so he could have used an angel could
[38:34] have spoke to him but he needed a
[38:36] reflection on Earth uh to have dominion
[38:39] once more
[38:40] to be Kings and Priests
[38:43] over the Earth
[38:45] so then he used this man and there even
[38:49] though he already talked to people those
[38:51] people didn't have the germ
[38:53] he already talked to the the DDS and
[38:56] whatever brother Branham said
[38:58] all these these these men but they
[39:00] didn't have that germ of life to give to
[39:03] the eunuch
[39:05] until
[39:07] Philip came
[39:09] so we are that reflection
[39:12] you have that Earnest of your
[39:14] Resurrection right now
[39:17] you you have an Earnest you have a
[39:19] reflection of what you already are in
[39:21] heaven
[39:23] brother Branham says that that that that
[39:26] when this body be dissolved we already
[39:29] have one waiting he says you have the
[39:31] earnest of your Resurrection
[39:34] you have an Earnest of your theophany
[39:36] brothers
[39:38] that means there's another use somewhere
[39:40] else
[39:42] think about it
[39:44] it's another you
[39:46] and that you is perfect
[39:50] that you is in the Throne of God right
[39:53] now
[39:55] and whenever we're stoop shouldered and
[39:57] we're kicking ourselves where that you
[39:59] is perfect in the image of God
[40:02] that that's why I love
[40:05] that the Bible says there is no
[40:07] condemnation
[40:09] for those that are in Christ Jesus
[40:11] there is you cannot impute sin to them
[40:14] no more
[40:16] see there's a difference between a great
[40:17] sin or this sin the sin and sins
[40:22] brother we we fall we sin we do
[40:25] something wrong and man we just know how
[40:27] to beat ourselves up and send ourselves
[40:30] right back to hell
[40:31] we know how to do that no nobody else
[40:33] has to do that we'll send ourselves
[40:35] right back into condemnation
[40:38] oh man I'm unworthy oh man I I'm nothing
[40:42] but God isn't looking at your flesh
[40:46] brother Brown says you're you're not
[40:48] you've never seen me in your life
[40:51] I remember whenever Samuel was supposed
[40:53] to uh find another king
[40:57] Samuel said okay let's look for another
[40:59] big guy
[41:00] let's look for another great warrior
[41:02] let's what was he doing he was looking
[41:04] at the flesh man
[41:06] he was looking at the body and God says
[41:09] hey just give you a little secret I look
[41:11] at the heart
[41:13] I look at what's inside a person
[41:17] and that's what God is looking at today
[41:20] and and so whenever we fall whenever we
[41:23] do all those things remember God isn't
[41:25] looking at the image bearing the Earth
[41:28] he's looking at the heavenly
[41:30] he's looking at the perfection
[41:33] amen
[41:36] so brother Branham he says
[41:40] so the earthy only expresses what the
[41:44] Eternal Things Are
[41:46] he says and if this Earth that we live
[41:49] in today be so great
[41:51] okay I already read this
[41:54] let's see
[41:58] amen this this study man it made me so
[42:01] happy
[42:03] you know because sometimes you you you
[42:06] see yourself in the mirror and you see
[42:08] that reflection you say oh my goodness
[42:11] but then you realize that God he he paid
[42:15] that price before the foundation of the
[42:16] world
[42:17] the lamb was slain before the foundation
[42:19] of the world and you were there praising
[42:21] the Lord
[42:22] God says who where were you job
[42:25] why were they worshiping why were they
[42:27] praising the Lord the lamb was slain
[42:30] that that image or the that bearing that
[42:33] image of heavenly were was already there
[42:36] okay
[42:37] so so we are just living a shadow of
[42:41] life
[42:42] now now I I don't have much left but
[42:46] we're just living that shadow and the
[42:48] bride she is living the shadow of Christ
[42:53] and brother Branham he said that
[42:55] whenever Christ died the spirit went
[42:58] down and preached to the souls that were
[43:00] in prison
[43:01] and that body stayed there on the Earth
[43:06] but he said whenever that the spirit
[43:08] began to go up the body began to rise to
[43:11] meet it he says he says this in Christ
[43:13] is the mystery of God revealed he
[43:15] preaches a lot about the head coming
[43:17] back to the body
[43:19] and he said that the body was there and
[43:22] and the spirit was the type or was the
[43:24] head he said and the spirit was coming
[43:27] back to the body and he said that was a
[43:29] type of the seven Church ages the bride
[43:32] in the seven churches coming back to the
[43:35] Head
[43:36] and that in every Church Age We they
[43:39] were just looking at a far shadow
[43:42] the body would begin to rise up from the
[43:45] feet
[43:46] and and there was a far Shadow and
[43:48] whenever you see a shadow from afar
[43:50] you'll start seeing almost three shadows
[43:53] it's blurry you don't know what it is
[43:55] and that's what was going on the word
[43:58] wasn't revealed fully
[44:01] but as as the ages went on the word
[44:04] unfolded a little bit more and you saw a
[44:07] little bit of the image
[44:09] and then the word was unfolded a little
[44:11] bit more and you saw more of that image
[44:15] the word was completely unfolded to our
[44:18] day that we're not living in a partial
[44:20] realization anymore brother Brown says
[44:22] we're not living in a time where where
[44:26] it's a reformer age or all these things
[44:28] we're living in the full revelation of
[44:31] God
[44:32] brother Branham he says he says you take
[44:36] a shade farther away from the shade the

[44:50] justification under Luther
[44:52] sanctification under Wesley and the
[44:55] baptism of the Holy Ghost under
[44:57] Pentecost and here today in the last day

[48:33] Lord
[48:34] I just asked father that you
[48:37] give us that Revelation father
[48:40] I know it's there
[48:42] but whenever we're going through our
[48:45] hardest times Lord
[48:47] that's when that Revelation needs to
[48:49] sink in father
[48:51] whenever maybe when somebody doesn't
[48:54] feel like they're Worthy
[48:56] that you may show them
[48:58] Lord that that
[49:00] you are with them Father
[49:03] that you are reflecting your life
[49:05] through them
[49:07] and that no matter how battered and how
[49:10] scarred our lives and bodies and spirit
[49:13] is
[49:14] we're reflecting something that is
[49:16] perfect that can never fall
[49:18] that can never fall out of Grace that
[49:20] can never
[49:22] sin their way away from God
[49:25] Lord I ask that you just be with each
[49:27] and every person
