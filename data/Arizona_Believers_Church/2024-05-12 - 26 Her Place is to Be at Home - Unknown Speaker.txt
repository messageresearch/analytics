TRANSCRIPT
========================================
before we continue in the subject of the house of the Lord and before we give you our title for today I'd like just to call back to uh title the last two services on a mortgaged home and I just wanted to take a moment to ask where are all my friends because only one person reached out to me and said hey did you spell mortgage wrong and uh and I wrote back and I said hey you know what you're the one true friend I have in the whole church he said not it wasn't even me that saw it was my wife and she had asked and so I thought I had one friend and it's just uh you know someone who was really concerned about my spelling skills so I'm sure if we dug deep we could find a type for a mort aged home uh or a mort aged home and U Mort I think comes from Moors which speaks of death or Blackness so maybe it's a black age home I don't know I don't know and I'm not trying to be super spiritual but people are like that so maybe someone somehow will find a really really deep deep meaning in my inability to spell on this title slide you'll be comforted to know that in my notes and even online it's spelled correctly I think but I'm just wondering where are all my friends at when I could not only just do it one time but twice and this brother said just in case you have a part three I wanted you to know that you don't know how to spell and they're not here today so maybe I ran them off no they're actually with with family so today my title is her place is to be at home and for whatever reason my beautiful font that I had I need to check this I don't think my fonts are coming through correctly and that's a real shame um I can't get anything right on the title slides we might just need to scratch this but her place is to be at home obviously this being a Mother's Day message you can already read into this but I'm going to ask you to not jump to any conclusions uh the title is done this way maybe as clickbait maybe for people to think in terms of wow that's pretty direct I did preach a couple few sermon one time called putting a woman in her place and uh for a lot of people they might have started going yeah but it wasn't exactly what they were expecting so I would say the same thing today uh don't jump to conclusions uh there is a target audience in this and it's not just mothers now if you'll just turn to Titus Chapter 2 veres 3 to 5 we'll we'll jump here in verse three and start into this subject the aged women likewise that they be in Behavior as becometh Holiness not false accusers not given too much wine teachers of good things so these are characteristics that and it's it's the highlights of certain characteristics that ought to be in a Christian woman and in this way it says aged women and so whether or not you want to affix a particular uh age to that or get a particular image but it's saying that women of a certain age women that are married women that are older have lived had some experience that they should be behave in a manner which is holy it shouldn't be false accusers not given to much wine and teachers of good things these are characteristics of a Godly woman and then it says that they may teach the young women so this is the reason why your lives are an example and you want to be living something and experiencing something not just telling somebody to do something that you yourself cannot do but it says to teach the young women to be sober to love their husbands to love their children now these would be things that the aged women themselves have already done or know or haven't experienced but they're to teach the young women to be sober to love their husbands to love their children there's some assumption that these young women are to be married and that the desire of God is that they would have children to be discreet chased keepers at home good obedient to their own husbands that the word of God be not blasphemed if you just recognize that last phrase there's all these things that are being elicited and encouraged in the aged women and the young women and at the end of the day these are things that would be overt or that could be seen things that are manifested in uh in character and in conduct and it says that these things do these things so that we don't blaspheme the word of God is not blasphemed and I want to just I want to focus on one phrase we could amplify a lot of these other terms and we we may find some other places just to highlight some of these things but it says that they are to be keepers at home in one place it is uh you know the word is Guardians of the house and so I think one of the alternative names for the Cleveland Indians was the the Cleveland housekeepers but it's keepers at home is Guardians of the house it literally means workers at home and this is a very specific phrase that Paul is saying that the aged women ought to teach the young women to be workers at home and one thing I want to be able to highlight in this first portion of this sermon is that God the scripture shows that God has appointed a duty uh at home that should fulfill a wife and a mother's uh heart and mind that there's things that the aged women have done and they found fulfillment in it and then these aged women or teach the young women that these are things that you ought to do and to be and it's not just in terms of the rules of religion but it's something that God has appointed and made a woman to be that will fulfill a wife's mind and heart John Wesley in commenting on this particular phrase keepers at home he says keepers at home whenever they are not called out by works of necessity piety and mercy and Wesley zeros in on the reality that there is a general commission to women a general calling that they're to be keepers at home but then there's times when necessity may call them out there's times when righteousness may call them out there's times when when mercy may call them out and so so you can't create this rule that says that a woman at no time can work uh if there if there's a needs that need to be met if there's certain if there's sickness if there's debt there may be ways uh things that intervene of necessity piety and mercy to where they have to work but that doesn't change their place there may be many different reasons why a a wife and a mother at that may be called into the workforce or to labor outside the home or to do things outside the home not necessarily working to earn an income but their place is at home and if a man can't work and the and the wife can then those are situations where uh the wife many times wants to and needs to but we know that if it was just to kind of Chase some ambition or just to have some of her own spending money and things like that in other words if her motive and objective is for herself and it's selfish then that puts her in Dangerous Ground uh that maybe she shouldn't be doing because again uh her place from in the scripture she's to be a keeper at home this biblical calling is built upon the foundational principles of bringing forth the woman in Genesis 2: 18 these are the founding principles for the bringing forth of the woman and the Lord said it is not good that the man should be alone I will make him a help meat for him in this act it completes the man it's quite extraordinary too because she was in him but then in the process of manifesting her it completes her him it is the completion of the man and doing this it's a help meet it's a co-laborer it's someone that fits his purpose and together and helps him fulfill his purpose so man is no longer just viewed as an entity that's fine on his own it's not good that man should be alone he needs to have a help meet so man is not complete until he's married and then after that he's finished and so there's this completion that takes place with the woman being by his side in a in a in a positive way in a fulfilling way so as strong as men may think they are as smart as men may think they are he has the need within himself for a wife he absolutely needs it for things where he is weak and for areas where he needs support and that is what the woman is to represent something that completes the man that is fit for his purpose and not that she alone would meet his needs but that he also would meet her needs but specifically as the scriptures uh bring for a woman and the context of it in Genesis chapter 2 and as Paul is touching on here as he writes to Titus God's purpose for the woman is related to the man and the bringing forth of children she is to be there for the purpose of helping the man fulfill that purpose but then it's also her purpose so Paul writes to Timothy in 1 Timothy chapter 3 excuse me 1 Timothy chap 5: 13 to 14 and and he's speaking about even widowed women a a and the dangers of a woman without a husband and he says with all they learn to be idle wandering about from house to house and not only idle but tattlers also and Busy Bodies speaking things which they ought not these are things that become a Temptation or that is easy to slip into when a woman is not in her calling or her place and she's not busy with the things that God has made her to be she'll find herself tempted to do these things either be Idol or to be a busy body a tattletail uh uh um spreading rumors and those things things that they ought not to do and again it fits with what an aged woman should be doing she shouldn't be going from house to house spreading lies or speaking about rumors or spilling the tea but rather she should be teaching the younger and she should be do behaving herself in the right way you can see kind of a kinship between Titus Chapter 2 and even these verses in Timothy and then he says I will therefore that the younger women marry bear children guide the house give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully so again it's a real similar trajectory that Paul is saying about the women that a teach the women to marry and to have children this is what is kind this is what a woman is made for this is in her she's made this way and Les it kind of touches on some sensitivities for some it's this is biology this is the way God has made them there's things a woman can do and a woman is fit to do that a man cannot do and so she is to marry bear children guide the house and again this phrase give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully remember it says that the word of God be not blasphemed it's in the same way so it says to guide the house it it means to rule the house and this is the woman's due place to rule the house means she has some Authority she has some uh uh she is gifted tasked with a certain uh um qualifications to do this to if she's to guide the house then God will equip her to guide the house it doesn't mean that she rules over the man or that she's a ruler and that she's a dictator but she has an active duty in the house it is the glory of the woman to continue at home and to not go abroad is one of the sayings of the Scripture it is more fulfilling to work at home than to go about from house to house more fulfilling to labor at home and to teach the young women that it is to be a busy body it is more fulfilling to be to guide the house and to be a keeper at home than it is to be Idol and again it speaks of the reproach because life and conduct are the true test of religion a person's life a person's conduct are the true test of Doctrine and so this as Paul is saying in Titus and even in Timothy and we could find other places where he expresses the same the gospel should not not make women bad wives or unfit mothers the message should not make women unfit wives or unfit mothers and by the same token it shouldn't make men unfit husbands and unfit fathers the word of God being blasphemed and the the adversary speaking reproachfully is all in the certain expectations or certain decency and integrity and Accord and love and treatment that one should have to another and if the gospel was making women obstinate and stubborn and if the gospel was making men absent then they'd be like why would we want the gospel why would a Jew or a Greek or anyone for that matter want to adopt a doctrine that made put anyone else down or shame somebody else or deprive them of their god-given rights but yet the Bible is showing the glory of the woman and her Duty God's appointed duty to the woman that should bring her fulfillment I'm trying to go through this very quickly as again this title is her place is to be at home but it is not to be uh it it it would I don't want you jump into conclusions in proverbs 7: 10 to2 and behold there met him a woman with the attire of a harlot it tells us that dress signals something and that's why it's important the manner in which we all dress she was dressed in the attire of a harlot and subtle of heart she is loud and stubborn her feet abide not in her house now she is without now in the streets and Li in weight at every corner there's a lot to this context in terms of how a man is taken and enticed and and and even some of the analogies to wisdom and foolishness that are being expressed here but this woman he says is loud clamoring she Wars she rages she's animated by desire and passion and stubborn it means defiant and the word stubborn is used even in Hosea 4:16 it's used of Israel that Israel slide back as a backsliding heer it's Israel is stubborn as a stubborn heer in other words it speaks of something that's uh unruly a a and Untamed that will not bear the Yoke oh she's not doing what she should be doing she's not she's Idol in the things that she should be doing she's busy in other things that she should not be doing and it says her feet abideth not in her house she's the opposite of one that stays at home and manages it she's the opposite of one that guides the home she's the opposite of one that keeps it home in other words maybe she's always Restless she's in the streets looking for opportunity looking for enticement she's looking beyond the home for her meaning she's looking beyond the home for purpose she's looking beyond the house to stay busy to stay occupied and have some sense of purpose and meaning but God made the woman a particular way and her place is to be at home maybe if I was preaching this in the ' 80s we'd have a little bit more amens I don't know but and I and I'll acknowledge it this biblical truth is controversial that it is either in some people's eyes and maybe trying to be nice it's outdated and that these things don't work anymore and that's just kind of an old traditional theology that developed at one time but all I've done at this point is just read to you scriptures and and even if you tried to say context this that and the other it's pretty plain to me that Paul is at least targeting an audience that he believes the women should be taught to be keepers at home that there are some group of women somewhere that he believes should be taught to marry bear children and to guide the Home and these are there to be workers at home Guardians of the home rulers of the home this is something that Paul is saying is fit for the woman and so to some it may be outdated to others it just might be outright oppressive and so we acknowledge that to some Ah that's kind of that's old fashion it doesn't really fit anymore and we realize that to others they may say now this is this is op Rive this is abusive and this is tyrannical and this is very dangerous and very toxic but I'd like to point this out as we begin to hopefully move into more of our subject this biblical truth although we could say a woman is to be a keeper at home and that the women is to marry and bear children and there's a way that we could begin to isolate these phrases and come up with some really good you know things that a woman should do or be this biblical truth should not be separated from the context of larger truth in other words you can't distill these things down to this is what God made women to be and they must be this in separate from the entire context of the Gospel that somehow we're going to ask women to be this and do this without the grace of Jesus Christ that is offered through through salvation that is offered through the shed blood and and separate it from all the context of scripture to where it just becomes a means to subjugate women or a rule of a rule of life that we entice women or encourage women to live by so that they can feel like they have some purpose and meaning if you miss the cross if you miss salvation if you miss the indwelling of the Holy Spirit it is subjugation it is oppressive I will say it this way as kind of my my maybe my thesis statement or my transitioning her place is to be at home but she is not to be the Builder of it she's a keeper not a builder she's a guide not not a not a builder and a wife cannot find her place if we say well the wife's her place is at home the mother's place is at home the woman's place is at home she cannot find her place unless that place has been prepared and provided and she's welcomed into it you don't just tell a woman to find her place you prepare it you provide it and you welcome her to it 1 Timothy 5:8 it says but if any provide not for his own house shall find that before he begins to deal with the aged women and the younger he deals first with the man and he says if any provide not for his own house especially for those of his own house or for his own and especially for those of his own house he ha denied the faith and his worse than an Infidel right these are very strong words if he does not provide for himself or even those of his own house he's denied the faith and is worse than an Infidel it is the role of the man to provide the place for the women for the wife and for the daughters it is not the role of the woman to merely find that Genesis 2:22 it says in the rib which the Lord God had taken from man made he a woman and brought her unto the man notice how that God when he brought her forth he brought the woman to the man and he brought her out to a place that had already been prepared beforehand he didn't uh he didn't create the garden and then tell the woman to go set it up he didn't have the woman come first to get everything ready so that when Adam came home or came into the garden it would all be ready the garden was a place that a man the man belonged it was a place that he had already been laboring in to make fit for the woman that when she would come forth she would feel that she belonged he brought her unto the man it was a place where the man was it was a place that the man had provided and if a man does not provide for his own house if it is not prepared if it is not established correctly he has denied the faith why because the word of God does not destroy a man's natural duties righten the word of God God will not diminish a man's natural duties it perfects them in other words if there's some natural Duty that a man has to a woman whether he's a Muslim or whether he's a Jew or whether he's an atheist it doesn't matter if there's something that is expected of a man who's in relationship to a woman or man to women in general the gospel does not change that or diminish it it perfects what's expected of a man I would say the same for the woman but again our target audience today is not even the mom's in John 14: 2 to3 it says in My Father's House Jesus speaking says there are many mansions if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you and if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am there you may be also I would say that these words are a model for man and his home that Christ says I'm going to prepare a place for you and once that place is prepared I will come again and receive you and we see the image of maybe a man who promises to marry and then he comes back at a particular time to marry his wife and we've seen so so it's a place that he's prepared where she's welcome it's a place where the bride is going to be invited into that has been prepared beforehand so this this speaks to us as men is Christ being the bridegroom that this place must be made made and it must be kept for her if I could say this we're the keepers of the home first and if men are not active in providing the place it forces Independence instead of instead of us just always uh looking at it from the standpoint of wellow the man was perfect it's got to be the woman's fault let's think of it this way if the man is not providing the place the protection the provision uh uh the position it for forces Independence I'm not suggesting in every situation a woman who's rebellious or stubborn or fails or does something wrong that the man has not done his part absolutely I'm certainly not expressing that but I am expressing the principle that when man is in relationship to a woman the man does not do his part in providing the place and keeping the place it forces Independence God brought the woman to a man not a child he brought the woman to a man not a monster he brought the woman to a man not a boy he brought the woman to a man not a brute and the man upon seeing the woman in verse 23 of Genesis 2 said this is now bone of my bones and Flesh of My Flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man what we could gather from this is that Adam had an understanding of her that he had the right view of her that there was maybe some empathy there was some connection there was some knowledge that he had of her where he said I I can understand you I can be sympathetic I can be empathetic I I am identified with you and then she's forever linked to the Man by be calling woman because she came from man and so now when Adam looks at her and says bone of my bones and Flesh of My Flesh he's re assuming responsibility over her perhaps in a greater way than he did before when she would have been in him hidden and maybe unknown completely but now he's making an unselfish commitment and forever linking himself to her brother bam in the sermon a man running from the presence of the Lord said if I was a young man looking for a wife to be married and here stood a girl that met every qualification that I thought would took make a woman why morally she was a queen lovely fine personality real Christian everything that I could think of to make me a good wife no matter how much I say she's perfect she's exactly right she isn't mine till I accept her and the responsibility of her being my wife wife so when a man takes a woman he accepts her this is now bone of my bones Flesh of My Flesh he should work to understand her he should desire to know her and to have be sympathetic and to relate to her as Adam did when a man takes full responsibility is what brother man said he's got to take responsibility not just accept her but take the responsibility of her being his wife and when a man doesn't take full respons responsibility it robs the woman of her sense of belonging I think deeply about that in the sense that if a woman marries a man and she be she takes on his name she leaves her family she goes to live with the man but if he doesn't take full responsibility in failing to take full responsibility even if it's not even acknowledged or noted it will give her some sense of not fitting in when he doesn't accept her and take full responsibility whether she could put her finger on it or not she's not going to feel like she fits and it'll Rob her of the the her need to feel as if she belongs and has a place in Ephesians chap 5: 28 and 29 it says so ought men to love their wives as their own bodies he that loveth his wife loveth himself for no man ever yet hated his own flesh but nourisheth and cherisheth it even as the Lord the church these words are very deep the selfish husband who lives only unto himself creates a toxic house that robs his wife of a home I think it's very clear when I say don't jump to conclusions there's a target audience and all the brothers are like well I can't wait till Father's Day then and the wies are like honey we're going to be out of town that weekend I have an appointment to go get my haircut on a Sunday and rearrange my sock drawer that afternoon that's think of this this description identifies someone who is not willing to make a selfless commitment though they're married in an arrangement a relationship when he lives to himself he creates an atmosphere that robs the woman of a home even if he's given her a house because he should nourish which means to bring up to maturity to nurture so there's even something about her love and her gifts and her ability that a man is to cultivate and to nurture to cherish it means to warm or to keep warm but it means to Foster with tender care some merely read this as a mandate to clothe and to feed but it means much more to that it means to make her feel a part of you to nurture her and to cherish her to where she feels that she is improving and growing and that this has been a benefit to her that it's been better for her that she's fostered with tender care and it's not that you just pity her and all this poor little thing I've got to take care of her the rest to my life but there's some connection and Affinity there and a responsibility that a man has taken that I must nourish a and nurture her and her gifts and provide her the tools and resources necessary for her to come into her Perfection for her to be the woman that she's called to be and I must cherish her to love her to adore her and to Foster her with tender care it makes her feel a part of you as brother Bram says you're supposed to be the boss of the house he says this to the man you're the ruler the Bible said the man shall rule he says not a dictator not a floor matat he made you a help meet a sweetheart to be Christlike is to not be harsh to be Christlike is to not be intolerant but to be giving to be sacrificial to be preserving to be washing these are the very things that it says a man ought to do to his wife he is Christlike not harsh he's Christlike not intolerant he's Christlike being forgiving being giving sacrificing washing as the scripture says in hoseah chapter 2 verses 19 and 20 what a statement that the Lord is making to Israel I will betro thee unto me forever I'll marry Thee I will betroll thee unto me in righteousness and in judgment and in loving kindness and in mercies I will even betro thee unto me in faithfulness Thou shalt know the Lord this is Christ this is God's marriage covenant it is in truth in honesty and in sincerity and and it has mature deliberation as he says I will betroll thee in righteousness in truth and in judgment this honesty and in loving kindness the utmost affection Tender Love and then it says and in Mercies in other words not by Merit not because the wife earns it but it's the duty that I owe her it says I will love her I will marry her in loving kindness and in mercies it doesn't it specifically means that the righteousness the judgment and the loving kindness must always exist even at times when you feel that she doesn't deserve it even at times where it seems as if she hasn't earned it it is not by Merit It Is by Duty I will marry you forever in righteousness judgment and loving kindness and I will betroll thee unto me in faithfulness I will be faithful to these things these are things that we could say are the marriage covenant these principles of the scripture that we have read to this point we could put into category of the ideal uh proposition the real standard of the scripture but Paul touches on something that's quite remarkable in Romans chap 1: 26- 28 for this cause gave God gave them up to vile affections because they would not retain God in their knowledge and because they would not look to him because they did not seek him God gave them up to vile affections reads this in a way that you maybe can expand a little bit just beyond maybe homosexuality and things but you gave them up to vile affections for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature so there is a nature of the woman that when we are given over to vile affections we change the natural use which is against their nature other the woman is no longer doing what she ought to do she's no longer feeling even what she's naturally called to do it says and likewise also the men leaving the natural use use of the woman so there is some uh connection between the man leaving the woman's natural use and the woman no longer in the woman changing her natural use it says burned in their lust one toward another men with men working that which is unseemly and receiving in themselves that recompense of their error which was meat and even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge God gave them over to a reprobate mind to do th things which are not convenient I want you to at least Focus on vile affections against Natural use things which are unseemly and this reprobate mind and things that are not convenient when they left God's word it led mankind to do things which degraded themselves and the other by leaving the word of God by losing sight of God it led them to vile affections to leave their natural use and if there's no uh respect for God in his word then the very found founds of mutual respect erode if if a woman will not respect God it erodes the foundations of self-respect and respect for man if a man will not regard God it erods the foundations of mutual respect to Mankind and to one another and so because God was not acknowledge it they lost the very foundation of the decency of humanity you're just left with that serpent nature you're just left with the dog eat dog world you're left with the cane idea of you got to get yours and you got to mind yourself you got to protect yourself maybe I can ask it this way what do misogyny and feminism have in common sounds like a joke I know it does but it's not no respect for women that's what misogyny and feminism have in common is the lack of respect for women and as Paul relates these things here these vile affections and women changing their natural use which is against their nature and a men leaving the natural use of the woman notice how his sins is now predicated upon this uh uh not expecting and this the natural use of a woman he gives himself over to vile affections a and God then allows them that their sin begat sin in their sin God allowed sin it's such a a powerful thing that God gave them up and because of their sin it begat more sin whereas righteousness begats righteousness transgression be begats transgression they say it this way the rise of feminism and chauvinism we're not independent of each other or in vacuum we touched on this before when I ministered on a Mother's Day a few years ago I you read quoted from this book and I I know I've made this statement before but feminism offers a solution to women who are feeling out of place now I know I like to think of it that uh we' the men have been perfect the patriarchy is blameless and that men have always done everything perfect but the devil again is talking to the woman and he's spreading lies and she's getting getting all these crazy ideas in her heads and she's all emotional and she lives in a run room house in her head and we have all these reasons why it happens it always happened at the right time of the month right and it's everything's going crazy and it's all the woman's fault and that's what gave rise to feminism but they weren't independent of each other this the rise of feminism it offers to a woman an opportunity to to be heard to be seen to feel a part of something it offers something to a woman that's feeling out of place and so in this book that's challenging the idea of a woman's purpose that the woman woman's purpose can only be fulfilled by being a wife and a mother or housewife and a mother they write this the problem lay buried unspoken for many years in the minds of American women and I think the way they the language they're using is so dead on it was a strange stirring and a sense of dissatisfaction a yearning that women suffered in the middle of the 20th century in the United States each Suburban wife struggled with it alone as she made the bed Sho for groceries matched slip cover material ate peanut butter sandwiches with her children chauffeured Cub Scouts and brownies laid beside her husband at night she was afraid to ask even of herself the silent question is this all it's a pretty good observation I think it's a little bit overs simplistic in some way to say that uh All American women were having the same thought as they laid in bed at night but clearly they're touching on something where the woman is married with Children and she's making bed she she's domesticated she's shopping for groceries she's eating lunch with her children she's driving them to uh uh you know extracurricular activities and she's with her husband at night but then she's like is this all is this all to life wake up take care of the kids you know do all these domestic things is this oh and and maybe it was a a valid question but the the question suggests that something's missing right and so this woman I I think if I remember correctly it was woman writing this otherwise it' just be really bizarre that this man got into the heads of the women into the in the 20th century but we can no longer ignore that voice with wi within women that says I want something more than my husband and my children and my home I that's striking I want something more than my husband and my children and my home and I say they were they were right they were absolutely right she was longing for something more because she wasn't receiving all that she was due she didn't just want the husband and the children in the house all those things optically are great all those things seem to meet the semantics of what a marriage ought to be but it doesn't fulfill what the woman needs otherwise in some ways we could say God's done all he has for us just by giving us a church and song service and preaching and then when we leave it's like we've had we've had some semblance of relationship with him but there is something here that a woman saying I've got the husband I've got the children I've got the house I've got a lot of stuff to do but my heart still feels empty my mind's not completely full and it is indeed because something was lacking and that's not all she needed and therefore for the woman in clearly where she wanted something more than just the physical husband and something more than just the lital children in something more than just a physical house she wanted and needed something more the alternative to Independence then for her is I could either go out on my own and find what I'm looking for and find some sense of belonging and satisfy this emptiness this struggle that I'm going by alone this emptiness I feel the alternative to going out and trying to satisfy that is submission to hardness bitterness and hate that makes the woman feel all alone with her husband her children in her own house if I could say it this way the less the man was Christ in the house the more the women begin to feel less at home it wasn't that men were Godly and upstanding and doing everything right no this is this is identifying that husbandry was broken fatherhood was broken and that as things begin to break down they begin to exploit this longing and this need within a woman's heart to be to do something to be satisfied in heart and mind and the men thinking well I bought her a house and I've done this and I've given her children I've done this and she's busy she's got all these things to do do thinking that somehow that deao gives the woman what she needs missed out on this element that she was made to feel as if she belonged and she was a part of something and that you were in it together as this statement the wife struggled with it alone to me was one of the key factors that in all her cub scout trips and all her peanut butter sandwiches and all her grocery shopping and everything she was doing she felt like she had no support and was doing it on her own I'll say this it's one thing for a woman to refuse to take her place it's one thing for a woman to refuse her place and to be independent to to Buck what the scripture says a woman ought to do but let me just say it's also another thing if the place isn't provided it's one thing for a woman to look at her position or place and reject it and say I don't want it it's another thing if that place isn't provided her place isn't just a house a house that may be unwelcoming and cruel demanding a house that is not peaceful and restful and quiet is no home especially for the woman and I know there's an idea sometimes and it's not necessarily a nasty one but it certainly is a stubborn when I say nasty it's it's not because uh even as some of the you cartoons to the year say it's not because we pay I pay you less because you're a woman I pay you less because I'm a man right it's kind of this idea that man has somehow premeditated uh you know treating the women differently and so it's not that it's it's rooted in some nastiness but there's this stubborn idea that all domestic Duty and responsibility is solely the woman's I'll work I'll earn a paycheck you your job is to take care of the kids discipline the kids your job is to do everything in the home and Men Who leave all domestic Duty and responsibility to the H to of a house turn that house into a job site for the wife when a wife or a mother feel all alone or feels like she's alone that place cannot be called a home if I can put it this way when man is called away from True manhood that's what puts a woman out of a home now I know there's a again I'm not I'm not dis uh discounting or disregarding an idea where a woman can be obstinate a woman could be out of her place she could be stubborn and she can be laugh and and these different things that we could highlight in the scripture where a woman is clearly out of her place and she's exhibiting a spirit of Le DEA or however else we'd like to characterize it but if a man is being called away from his place in manhood that will put the woman out of the house puts her out of a home and not being at home will cause her to do things it sometimes forces that Independence brother Bram in the sermon thirsting for Life says now if a man is if a man is sick and his wife can't work and or he can't work I mean I don't blame his wife's got to make a living that's right but if she goes out working to have a little extra money you better keep away from that scallywag Bunch that she's working with out there I think it just highlights that you better be certain in these situations where there's some departure from the general principle and God gives a Grace and it's not legalistic that that the your reasons for working have been well prayed through and thought out and it's not just opportunity and it's not just uh you know income alone but it's like if we do this it'll take care of this or we have this need uh maybe sometimes that medical needs arise in a family medical bills come up and the kids need braces and there's no way they're going to get braces unless there's extra income and these things are of necessity so there's times when necessity piety and mercy will call a woman uh outside the home to labor and to work and if if it's not the right thing brother Bam's identifying that's when there's trouble he says her place is home that's it here she's supposed to be at home that's it and he says and Mister you might call yourself ever so good but if you've got lodges and other things I I can't remember how recently we read this but you might feel like you're a pretty good message believer but if you have lodges clubs Recreation things that you belong to things that you're committed to and things that you enjoy and other things that call you away from her at night you ought to be ashamed of yourself there's this expectation that a man would leave the house to go to labor and I know that those things have changed and and as over the last 5 to 10 years those things changed quite a bit where more working from home was done and then covid almost proved just how many workforces could be uh at home and there was now a transfer of overhead to the individuals who work at home and so now the corporations don't have to pay rent any more and they don't have to have Donuts in the break room and things like that so they're just they've got our nose to the grindstone don't they now he's say he's saying that there's obviously a man is called Away by duty to work and that would give some separation from family and if you feel like I'm just taking too much Liberty with this uh that may be your defense mechanism but plainly he's saying that a man is out working all day or maybe he's in his office at home all day and he's got things he needs to do as a man but then when his work commitments over he finds all these other things that keeps him away from his family he's saying wow something's wrong you should be ashamed right God gave you a home to cherish and comfort and things like that now I believe it means he gave you a home for you to cherish he gave you a home to comfort not a place to work and then you can leave and go do your fun things at night while you leave the woman on the job site the rest of the day that's he he's not just there's not this division of Duty where you're the wife and I'll work and I'll recreate and you'll just do all the things that has to be done at home dishes and laundry and everything else no you're a partner in it and I've waited until my kids are doing laundry and washes dishes to preach this waited till There's No More Diapers to change to preach this you know how old these notes are it's we're Partners in it he says it's gave you a home to cherish and comfort things like that I want to emphasize it this way a home for you as a man to cherish it for you as a man to comfort it and that home is to be what cherishes you and comforts you not the stuff out there the home and he says it's a shame to see the way a man do does their wife it's a shame to see the way man does their wives and wives do men the Womanhood and fatherhood of the nation is tore to Pieces divorce courts piled up Jesus said would be that way this ties into our Mortage home as it was in the days of Noah they were Maring and given in marriage until the day that Noah entered into the ark that that day when the son of man is revealed is characterized by the eating and drinking the buying and selling the planting and building brother B said it's a sin and a disgrace to enter into marriage to plant to harvest to build to sell to buy and to do all that and then the main things be missing the togetherness the belonging the the commitment to one another the mutual respect I'm putting the onus on the man today in 1 Peter chapter 3: 1 7 to 11 711 where are they anymore likewise ye husbands dwell with them according to knowledge giving honor unto the wife as under the weaker vessel and as being HS together of the grace of Life I'll read through this and then go back through some of these words that your prayers be not hindered hindered think of that this you ought to do otherwise you will suffer personally the way you treat your wife will indicate how clear your channel is with the Lord in prayer finally be ye all of One mind having compassion one of another he has not left the duty of a husband to the wife but yet we could all enter into Fellowship of having compassion one of the other love is Brethren be pitiful be courteous not rendering evil for evil or railing for railing contr eyes blessing knowing that you are there unto called that you should inherit a blessing for he that will love life and see good days this is really good I know we say ha happy wife happy life if mama ain't happy ain't nobody happy if a man is talking in the wilderness and his wife can't hear him is he still wrong right those different questions that we all we all pose at times but this is the real secret for he that will love life and see good days this is the secret to the happiness let him refrain his tongue from evil and his lips that speak that they speak no guile let him asso evil that's not cashew it's isue evil and do good let him seek peace and ensue it this men is the recipe you must learn this is one thing you better be cooking amen this is the recipe for a woman to fill up to make a woman feel at home you may pick up on my play of words there in my title now this is how you can make a woman feel at home dwell with your wives according to knowledge give your wives no excuse for being unkind give your wives no excuse for being unfaithful that's right according to knowledge giving honor show respect and care you're a protector you're a supporter because of your strength you demonstrate this honor this respect and care be compassionate considered is what he's asking sympathetic feeling for her bear ing her burdens I know as men we often think well she doesn't know what it's like to work and she doesn't know what it's like to be faced with lust and she doesn't know what it's like to be she doesn't know what it's like and we always want them to be sympathetic you start first by putting yourselfself in her shoes and what she must feel with the things that you do because you're the stronger vessel be tender-hearted and friendly minded is what it's telling us of a humble mind cultivate the relationship ship you take the initiative to cultivate the relationship not rendering evil for evil in other words do nothing but good even when bad is done to you that if if the woman does evil to the man the man is not justified in returning it the man is under a mandate to not return evil when evil is done but always do good not railing for railing in other words returning in kind I think this one is so dead on I had some notes on this recently when we're ministering on the home life a a and being responsive and not just rebuttal and re giving back railing for railing in other words returning to kind giving back what you've been given I think it's our knee-jerk reaction it's our Instinct that if someone goes we just go right we just mirror it you got to break that that when it's escalated on one side we don't escalate it on the other but we find ways to disengage the escalation and deescalate and solve it says refrain thy tongue from evil men refrain your tongue from lying and dishonesty deceit and being doubled tongue and says and not speaking guile withhold the words that tear down that hurt and destroy asso evil and do good and seek peace avoid evil do good and seek peace even if it seems hard to do pursue good do right and join yourself to peace at whatever whatever means is necessary this is a recipe for a home this is a recipe for a really good happy Mother's Day sermon and some brothers are like I didn't know it was Mother's Day I'm in big trouble I'm in big trouble over there on open table trying to find reservations they're booked there's no more seats brother bam says and God has provided a way I I doing really good on time here so I think we'll we'll end at a decent time we won't preach long enough to empty out the restaurants I apologize but because this is very direct and I feel that I could speak manto man to the men here today and I don't think they'll resent me in it I do think that a man always runs the risk uh of hurting a woman when he preach on preaches on things that are expected of a woman because again he's up there as a man who doesn't he doesn't have the heart of a woman there's situations he doesn't know so a man always have has to be careful a minister and men have have to be very very careful when they wield the word that they don't turn it into a stick a codo that they beat women with and it's real easy to do even if you don't mean it uh just even you know just try to comb a girl's hair right it's a brush you're just trying to get the knots out well if you don't use it correctly there can be a lot of owls and stop and that hurts you're like I'm just trying to comb your hair and and so if that's what you're trying to do you got to be very very careful and so I'm being more direct to the men because I believe that's a safe place to be and I do think that it's within our power as men to make mothers happy it's not just in our power to make them mothers but to make them to we have what they need and we have the resources so that women aren't laying in bed at night wondering what he's thinking or asking the question is this all but there's some there's some fulfillment that has come with all the demands on their time and Men I'd say you can feel the same way where you work and you labor and you strive and you do all this stuff and you feel like you're just doing it on your own it's when there's a disconnect and you're not in harmony you're not together you're not on the same page and you haven't you haven't at least men and women both striven to to uh strove striven strived to do these things that's something you say this there's got I want something more than just a wife and kids in a house I want something more more than just a husband and children and a house and the more isn't in abandoning them or leaving your calling the more is in coming to your place and as men we can't just demand we can't just say well you just need to find your place you need to get happy with the way I do things but we have to labor in making yes in building that home for the woman brother bam says it takes a real man to admit he's wrong how many men are wrong feel will admit you're wrong how many men will admit they're wrong today well I even got a side eye there like I never claimed to be a man it takes a real man to admit he's wrong when he's wrong we'll admit it I got plenty of hopes for that person when a woman that's wrong and will admit it I got plenty of hopes for her but when they're wrong and won't admit it and the scripture he uses is so amazing he that hides sin or covers sin shall not Prosper he that confesses his sin shall leave Mercy shall have mercy and if you're wrong and know it raise up your hand and say pray for me brother brandham he says God bless you brother another just before prayer this closing this sermon down God bless you lady yes God bless you over here and you lady God Bless you that's real courage to do that now what did I tell you a while ago when I first started when you see a car coming down the road 90 M an hour get out of its way that's right when you see the first twist in anything like that get away from it stay away from it that's the ground you should not be on Satan will present something to you that'll wreck your soul and send you to Hell stay away from it shun the very appearance of evil that's right be a man be a woman these are very direct words I think you can amplify these things for yourself and how that when you see a Twist get away from it Satan will try to get you away from something and it wreck your soul and he says I'm going to take up for the women a minute he said that's unusual isn't isn't it but but they say oh the woman caused it oh it was the woman's fault if she hadn't gotten out of her place well the man wouldn't have got out of his that's true we'll say that's right she gets out of her place a man can't be bad bad L there's a bad woman but remember there can't be a bad woman without being a bad man that's right and then what's remarkable is where if we if we borrow the first way that there cannot be a bad man without there being a bad woman and so we somehow put the blame on the woman for the man being bad he's saying in this analysis the woman only remains bad if the man's bad if he chooses to be bad stay bad and so there is and then also I think conversely can say a woman is bad because a man is bad that's right and you who claim to be a Son of God where's your principles if the woman ain't out of her place aren't you a Son of God aren't you the one that's higher stronger vessel and God says she's weaker than if she's weaker then show yourself a man of God I it's this idea that okay if she's if she's bad if she's done something wrong if she's trying to twist yourself away if she's not in her place he says why don't you be a man of God tell her sister you're wrong that's right I've done it and other Christians have done it and you'll always do it as long as you're a Christian but show yourself a Son of God you're a Son of God says you have more power over yourself than the woman does you have more power over yourself than the woman does if she's weaker recognize her to be weaker understand her mistakes and things like that and try to correct her say sister we're Christians you shouldn't do that be a real man be a Son of God and watch the women there's where the great fall begin at the beginning it was Satan with Eve that's what brought the whole downfall of the human race is through that and if you're a Son of God be strong be a real man if you're not that way stay at the altar till you become that and he says and shun the very appearance of evil somehow I believe regardless of who started it it ends with us that there's a burden of responsibility on us if we even take the analogy of the script of the message of the hour where brother B said a woman started it and she ends it but she only ends it because her bridegroom brings her to the place to do it the man from a position of strength is the one who can get beneath the person that's wrong and brother Bram is not telling us to Lord over them point out their mistakes but as the man who's higher and stronger and her being weaker this is a this is a call to get beneath her and to lift her up and to not go lower to debase yourself if she's wrong then we should stand strong show ourselves as men we've got more power over ourself than the woman does she's weaker we recognize her we understand her mistakes we try to understand her we try to empathize with her we try to have some sort of connection and we do what we can to get beneath her her and lift her up to wash her and to edify her my closing scripture reading is in Titus if you go back to the very beginning of where we read Titus Chapter 2 veres 1 and two we started with verse three the aged women likewise to teach the younger women also but it starts with speak thou the things which become a sound Doctrine and hear these things that the Aged men be sober grave temperate sound in faith in charity and patience in other words the man first the man is addressed first to be sober which is to be vigilant to be watching over your conduct and your conversation to be grave it means to be dignified in behavior and speech and dress there's some levity of life and words and appearance that's why men just aren't to dress any way they want they just don't have a a free run on whatever they want to how they want to look or how they want to act or how they want to talk that the men are to be sober grave temperate I mean self-restrained they're to be discreet not becoming uh monstrous or [Applause] flamboyant cica the younger a philosopher said a young man addicted to a life of luxury transgresses an old man thus addicted runs mad it's Madness it's Insanity for a an aged man to not be sober grave temperate sound in faith charity and impatience despite the Aging of the the body and the mind be sound in faith and charity and patience be sober grave temperate sound and faith and charity and patience these are things that are exhorted of aged men comes to verse six young men likewise exhort to be sober minded and all things showing thyself a pattern of Good Works IND Doctrine showing uncorrupt this gravity sincerity notice the Symmetry to what an aged man is to do sound speech that cannot be condemned that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed having no evil thing to say of you EX servants to be obedient under their own masters and please them well in all things not answering again not purloining but showing all good Fidelity I wonder the ways that we as spouses perin and show a lack of fidelity that they may Adorn the doctrine our god of God our savior in all things notice how conduct reflects on your Doctrine your religion your faith for the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men teaching us that denying ungodliness and worldly lust we should live soberly righteously and godly in this present world looking for that blessed hope and the Glorious appearing of the great God and our Savior Jesus Christ who gave himself for us this is that husbandry gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity and purifying unto himself The Peculiar people who are now zealous of good works again in the same way that he exhorted the Elder to be sober grave tempered sound in faith and charity and patience he's now exhorting the same in the men who are young sober minded speaks of self-restraint overcoming the desire to indulge self not self-serving not just merely chasing your own passions your own desires and doing the things that make you feel good and coming up with excuses for it but be sober minded be characterized by Good Works a pattern of good work speaks of habit living the example that you would expect from others especially your own family sound and speech is wholesome speech in private that pure graceful edifying tongue not foolish talking denying worldly lust living soberly righteously and godly rejecting whatever is contrary to the fear and love of God living soberly is that the whole temperament of a person not the Folly of ignorance not the disorderly passions not just doing what you want to do but you live sober not inflamed not driven zealous of Good Works doing and promoting good amen let me say this as I close this is character and it's this type of character that'll build an atmosphere that makes a woman feel at home men are to lift their wives up not put them down and Paul said that we are to dwell with our wives according to honor Peter rather according to knowledge giving honor as unto a week weaker vessel being heirs together so there's this this uh full picture that he's expressing that your prayers be not hindered I said Brothers the way you treat your wife and children is determining your spiritual success our spiritual SE success our relationship with God our closeness to the Lord depends upon these things a woman is not put in her place by demanding it by telling her to do it she is not placed by force but let me say this she will willingly move into her position when the word is expressed because her place is to be at home her place we can or places in the home no her place her sense of belonging her f her happiness is to be at home would you tell someone to make themselves at home you're you're speaking that there should be some safety a relaxing a letting down of guard trust a an understanding a support and so her place is to be at home I'm not talking about getting in the kitchen and doing the dishes I'm talking about a man who has the kind of character that creates the kind of place where when she's there she can be at home brother the brothers if they could come to their instruments and the sermon recognizing your day and its message brother says Israel's back in her Promised Land she don't know how she got back there she was just automatically put back there National Force put her in her place now I'm going to say something National Force put Israel and her Homeland National Force will put the church and the World Council churches said look it's National Force external forces that's going to put Israel in their Homeland the church and the World Council churches he says but the power of God will put the people in The Bride it's not force it's power the world force is this way and the world forces that way but God forces upward the spirit of God which is the word of God my word is spirit and life will put the bride in her place because she'll recognize her position in the word then she's in Christ we put her in her place no National Force will do it no National Force did Drive Israel to the though Force did Drive Israel to her Homeland the national forces of the council churches will drive every organization into it but the power of God will raise the bride into Glory out of it let me say this on Mother's Day as men as men a man can draw the woman into her position by expressing Christ the expression of the character of Christ will welcome her home draw her out of her clamor draw her out of her Stu stubbornness that's the danger so much anymore when we just give into our natural inclinations is uh her stubbornness will breed our harshness and her unwillingness to to feel at home and to make home and those things only cause us to be become more obstinate and harsh and it just forces and forces and forces but let me say this to you today as men there's a recipe in the scripture of God in First Peter and Titus and Timothy there's recipes for us as men that we can begin to cook and I say let them cook let the Men start doing the things that they ought to do and it'll draw the woman into her position when the word is expressed brother B says the word will she'll recognize her position the word the word is spirit and life it puts the bride in her place when it's expressed by the man it'll make the woman feel feel at home and I say the man has the primary responsibility for building that home and for those those who are not married or those who have marriages that are separated if one even a man or woman finds themselves not in this traditional model you may know better than anybody just exactly what we're talking about just how hard it can be in the absence of certain things I'll say this a woman wants to be at home not merely in the kitchen she wants to know she belongs she has a place she has support and she's not alone let's give our wives and mothers the best gift we can give them and that's the gift of a home by being more understanding and [Music] sympathetic because her place is to be at home and I promise you husbands and children you're the ones that have the power to make her feel at home it's in your power will you accept the responsibility for it will men accept the responsibility for it are there any husbands here want to stand and say I'm going to I'm going to make a home I'm going to make my wife feel at home husbands who want to do that let's stand say I'm I want to make my wife to be at home
