TRANSCRIPT
========================================
let's turn our Bibles now Genesis chapter 3: 14- 21 so nice to see all of you out out in the house of the Lord today Genesis 3:14 and the Lord God said unto the serpent because thou Hast done this Thou Art cursed above all cattle and above every beast of the field upon thy belly shalt thou go and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life we saw even how this is connected with death and what the serpent had sown into Humanity and to mankind it's the serpent eating the Flesh and has a and the sin now has a right to this body and I will put enity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel under the woman he said I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception in sorrow Thou shalt bring forth children and thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee and unto Adam he said because thou Hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife and Hast eaten of the tree of which I commanded thee saying Thou shalt not eat of it cursed is the ground for thy sake in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life Thorns also and thistle shall it bring forth to thee and thou shalt eat the herb of the field in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread till thou return unto the ground for out of it was thou taken for dust Thou Art and unto dust shalt thou return and Adam called his wife's name Eve because she was the mother of all living unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins and clothe them amen you may be seated I'm just excited about the word of the Lord this morning and appreciate the atmosphere that you've been able to create just through your worship and your expectation continued on the subject of God created and it is I do have it was very uh special for me just to see how this kind of converged uh to this point we've been pondering um theme of seeing the new birth in the beginning and also uh uh just some of the elements with respect to Christ and his birth and we had kind of put some of those things aside but it just seemed like God just converged it to where I believe I'm able to preach a Christmas message to you today and a message that would focus and give honor to the birth of Christ but it's in this thought of in the beginning God created and as we've been looking at these first few chapters of the Bible and of the book of Genesis we've seen that God's purpose who he is and his character his nature and his very essence and even his reason to exist could not be satisfied or his purpose his will who he is could not be revealed without Redemption so when you read Genesis chapter 1 and you read Genesis chapter 2 Redemption is actually hidden Mystery because in everything that we read in Genesis chapter 1 and Genesis chapter 2 it's an evolution of perfection it's Perfection upon Perfection and Mankind is described is being in the garden naked but not ashamed and it's the Perfection of perfection it's it's it's Beauty it's Holiness it's perfect love there's no fear there's no death and so it'd be very hard to perceive redemption in that picture but yet that's the picture God's painting it's a mystery hidden there in Genesis chapter 1 and chapter 2 and as we've been looking at Genesis chapter 1 verse 28 how that God commanded the man and the woman to be fruitful multiply and replenish the Earth and subdue it and then they to have dominion over all things we saw that how Redemption would not allow Genesis 1:28 this need for God to be Redeemer would not allow Genesis 1 128 to be fulfilled without suffering that there had to be a loss of this command a loss of this blessing this is not something that man would have be e be able to grasp easily or just walk into and fulfill God's need to be a redeemer required that Genesis 1 128 not be fulfilled unless there was suffering and this was necessary to bring about God's purpose this was get to give God reason to exist and those are just some statements and elements we're bringing together here at the beginning just to kind of uh understand where we are in this track or this trajectory that we're on so when mankind Falls Genesis 1:28 this blessing this command uh this empowerment that's given to them in Genesis 1:20 is taken away from Mankind and we understand that no no mortal no human being had ever fulfilled this commandment or this blessing Genesis 1 128 is given to Adam and the woman but the man and the woman never fulfill any part of this command when it comes to be fruitful multiply replenish the Earth and subdue it this blessing is taken away from mankind but when God makes a promise he's going to keep it amen and I want to I want to just stay in this area maybe for several moments here at the beginning if God says he's going to do something then God's going to keep it and Genesis 1: 26-30 I read it as a covenant with creation that God is not just kind of throwing things out there in a list of house rules but this is a covenant that God's making with creation and and it has a if you will I will component to it as God made a conditional Covenant with Adam but rather what God says here in Genesis 1: 26-30 represents something that God is covenanting with creation and not saying that it's going to be lost forever but rather I have spoken this this is the way that I want it to be and it is going to be amen it's God's covenant with Creation in Isaiah chter 45: 23 he says I have sworn by myself the word is gone out of my mouth in righteousness and shall not return and and the the phraseology that you use there it's not going to be empty it's not going to be uh uh unsatisfied it's going to be satisfied the word has gone out of my mouth that which I have spoken is not going to come back and say well it didn't do what it was supposed to he says but my word goes out of my mouth it shall not return that unto me every knee shall bow and every tongue shall swear God's the only one that can say this that anything he says will not fall to the ground man is known to be a liar man will fail you man says things with great sincerity and can promise things and it not not come to pass despite his great efforts but there's something about the word that goes out of God's mouth and this is why we worship him because he's God we worship him because he's God I I we don't even worship him because he loves us that just makes the worship sweeter we worship him because he's God he's the one true God whatever he says is truth whatever he does is just that's why we worship him because he's God and the word that goes out of his mouth is not like the words of man but it's accompanied with Divine energy When God Says something that there's something behind it there's weight and substance to what he says so what he says when God makes a covenant with creation God's going to keep that Covenant the very next chapter in Isaiah chter 46: 10 to1 says God declaring the end from the beginning and from ancient times the things that are not yet done saying my counsel notice just how beautiful this is my counsel shall stand and I will do all my pleasure amen what he says will stand and it's sure it's firm and whatever he wants he gets I will do all my pleasure that this is what I want I'm going to get it I'm going to have what I want I'm going to get what I want calling a ravenous bird from the East the man that executeth my counsel from a far country yay I have spoken it I will also bring it to pass I have purposed it I will also do it notice how the scripture is standing for something that when God speaks something God says something will be it's going to happen regardless of how long it takes for it to happen it's going to happen it's the lesson we learned from the message the trial that brother Brandon preaches uh several times that when God makes a promise no matter how many years it takes God's going to bring it to pass that When God Says something you can Bank on it you can count on it you can trust it you can rest in it when God makes a promise Genesis 1: 26-30 even Genesis 12 is God's covenant with creation it is a promise that will not be left unsatisfied it will not return the word has gone out of his mouth my counsel shall stand I will do all my pleasure I've spoken it I will bring it to pass I've purposed it I will do it every word of God is a seed then that has an energy to it has a power to it that's sealed within it and that God has the power in his word to bring it to pass it's a principle that brother Bram uses in God's power of transformation or the power to transform or power of transformation he deals with how there's life and power within the seed to bring it to pass now this uh this quote is very lengthy and I I wanted to trim it but the more I tried to find a place to trim it the bigger it got so I just had to stop at some point but it's lengthy but I want to read it to you because it it'll help lay this foundation for where we're headed today and that's what God did for Adam and Eve he created this Garden of Eden he spoke it it was in his mind and when he says it then it has to happen he says bear that on mind now when he says it must happen nothing can hinder it nothing can keep it from happening there's nothing that can keep it from happening God said so that settles it God said it it's going to happen this is a promise this is something that encourages us he says now he had all this in his mind and he said let there be now that's Genesis 1 see Let There be this and let there be that let there be he was sowing seed Let It Be Here let it be here let it be here and he knew it was going to be that way because it cannot change now as we as we arrive to this spot notice he's saying when he says it it has to happen what he says it must happen nothing can hinder it nothing can keep it happening there's nothing to keep it from happening God said so that settles it it's going to happen this is something that when God speaks something it must come to pass it's going to be that way because it cannot changed now bring this into your heart and hold this at the center of what we're ministering today now that gives us Faith then and what he said here is going to be so let's let that seed fall into our hearts that we might be the bedding ground of that see it into our hearts and let us act out this place that he has placed Us in in the last days let the word come into the beding ground of your heart by faith believing that whatever God has spoken is going to come to pass we might as well say Let It Be Me amen God you said you're going to do it then do it in me let it happen to me be it unto me according to Thy word it gives us faith that whatever God has spoken we could just open up and say Lord you said there's going to be then let it be in me let us act out this place that he's placed Us in in the last days so now there's a an act that we're doing in our place in these last days he says see let the seed fall in uh let the seed fall into our hearts Lord let Thy word fall in my heart let there not be any unbelief amen now God had said all these things so he knew it would be and it did he brought forth of its kind now that he had transformed then all the seed into the living creature and the creation that it was supposed to be it came up just as he said it would he said Let It Be maybe hundreds and hundreds of years passed but here we find it a beautiful Eden the big birds flying then Birds didn't have to die and the wolf and the lamb were feeding together the leopard The Lion The Leopard and oxx there was no killing no death no sorrow and there was Adam and Eve Walking In the Garden of Eden every seed bringing forth it never could do nothing else why God said it that way it never could do nothing else because God said let let it be that way it had to be that way now this is where he stops he says oh how i' like to stop here just a minute to say now if you could have in your mind and really would want to start before paragraph 88 and just start at the very beginning of this message to track everything brother B's saying to this moment is this momentum building there's this picture that's being painted and brother br's described it so beautifully the leopard and the ox and the lion no killing no death sorrow Adam and the woman walking through the garden every spoken word of God bringing forth after its kind what a beautiful picture what a powerful scene everything is just uh laid out so wonderfully says oh I just want to stop and say this is where we are facing yet the completion of that word in other words this is where we're standing today he says let us act out this place that he's placed Us in in these last days the place that we've been put in in this last days is to fulfill all the promise and the potential that was represented in Adam and the woman all the Splendor all the glory all the the Majesty that was portrayed there in the beginning we know that something was interrupted but now here here we are today in our place acting out the final stages of what was represented in Genesis chapter 1 and chapter 2 this is what we are facing this is where we're standing today this is the place we are in today the completion or the Fulfillment of the original word that's exciting what a wonderful place to be now God said let there be and here it come up first perfectly just exactly now this tree can only bring forth that tree this tree can only bring forth this tree and Adam a Son of God can only bring forth a Son of God it's everything after its kind and so God could say well I'll just rest now he had a system and a way of doing things let it be just and that's the way it was everything at seed bringeth forth of its kind now when everything looked pretty and everything come to pass just what God had said now here comes that slime dirty deceiver now that's what I'm trying to warn you all about here and you know that this is the theme to power of transformation uh God's power to transform is the deformer god transforms by the power that's within the seed Satan can interrupt the transformation and cause a de defect or a a a disconformity to the original design and this is the theme to what he's preaching in this sermon but he says this dirty slimy deceiver this is what I'm trying to warn you about when you see God's seed begin to to take hold to grow watch out for that fellow coming in just as slick as he can be quote scripture just just to who wouldn't have it see watch him because he's a deceiver I'm going to call it instead of a conformer being conformed he's a deformer deforming the things that's been conformed he is a deformer and he a deformer or perverter or corruptor of the Original Seed in the program now I love what he says here because this is instructive to us especially as a church that's just beginning and we see the the hand of God in it we recognize the supernatural now you see here like in your group this morning you got a program you got a vision we have that right now watch for that corruptor oh he'll be Sly and slick as he can be you see but keep your vision boy see keep holding to that when God has given you a place when God gives you a vision when God has a program or a purpose and you begin to line up with it you begin to kind of catch the move of God catch the will of God for you expect Satan to come around and try to bump you off that track expect the deformer to come and try to pervert the trajectory and get you a little bit off center and get you away from things but we got a program we got a vision watch the slly Slick slimy deceiver corruptor come in but you've got to keep your vision keep holding to that say we also find out when he come in he deformed that seed and he corrupted that seed by getting into the bedding grounds which was e and corrupting that seed with corruptible seed before it could get there to corrupt that beautiful Garden of Eden and it that I know that's kind of a fragment there he says we're Heaven the only thing that that is is just the restoration so Satan comes and interrupts and corrupts things this beautiful Garden of Eden is interrupted and then he refers to Heaven he says Heaven is just a restoration that we have to change our mindset of what the future heaven is going to be we think Heaven oh we think of H uh some kind of h a dimension in the sky that's got clouds and streets of gold and pearly gates and we try to just imagine what it's going to be but it's going to be here amen new heavens and new earth that's what it's going to be for all eternity it's not in another dimension out there but there's a a just a seiling and a fusion of all dimensions and God is is going to be expressed throughout all eternity he says Heaven is just the restoration of the restoration of what in the beginning that's right the very plan and purpose of God he goes he goes where are we now now notice how he comes back to this Heaven is just a restoration where are we now we're on our road back to the original beginning of the creation of God where are we now what are we facing today back to the original beginning of the creation of God back to the Garden of Eden again husband and wife without any sin or anything to live eternally praise the Lord I love how brother brandham takes us in the in where we're going it's taking us back it's Redemption think all the future oh heaven but yet this this uh this eternity this Loop is coming back to where it left right we're on our road back to the original beginning of the creation of God that's the original we're going back to back to the Garden of Eden again husband and woman husband and wife without any sin or anything to live eternally why God spoke it it's going to come to pass he's going to keep his Covenant with creation in Isaiah chap 55: 10-13 if you'll just can follow these verses with me says for as the rain cometh down and the snow from heaven and returneth not thither but WTH the Earth and maketh it to bring forth and Bud that it may give seed to the S and bread to the eater he says so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth so he the verse 10 is wanting to condition our minds and open up our minds by understanding even natural things to be able to relate to the word of God for as the rain cometh down and the snow from heaven so this precipitation that would come from the sky and returneth not thither in other words it comes down and then it just doesn't go right back up again in its same state but WTH the Earth it's not just uh comes down for no reason goes back up he says it comes down for reason it Waters the the Earth and in watering the Earth it makes to bring forth and Bud what the seeds that are in the earth for what purpose and know each thing just builds to the next that it may give seed the Earth may give seed to the SE through the process of uh of this plant coming to seed the seed can then be used again to be sewn and bread to the eater so it comes to seed and then the seed is used to sew again but also to make bread for the eater so he says as the rain falls Waters the Earth in watering the Earth it brings forth a plant which brings forth seed that seed is used again to perpetuate the cycle but then also used to make bread it's a germ to make bread for the eater he's wanting us to have this picture in our mind in this uh this process in our minds of sewing growing and harvesting when it comes to the word of God so when God speaks something we say God says Let There Be and we think boom there's got to be but it can happen that way if you ever catch the Revelation that you're healed you you could start looking for it immediately because it can happen just like that brother Bram even says the new birth can happen justification sanctification the very seal of God which is the new birth can happen all at one time amen but then there but there can also be a process to it God says it's going to be you might as well expect that it's going to happen but Ram said whenever God says something the predestined just make they're under Supernatural expectation and they make preparation for for it they say well it's uh you're making preparation Abraham you're going to have a son he starts making preparation maybe the first few years they kind of humor them then after five people like then after 10 20 right but you can count on it whatever God says is going to happen so this phrase this this image that the prophet is trying to draw what God is trying to get us to understand in this is that when God says something it's a seed but there's a season for the sewing there's a season for the wa the germination and the watering and the and the energizing of that seed and the development of that plant to where it's going to come to seed and then it's going to be harvested and then used for its particular purpose whether it be sewn again or turned into bread God wants us to think of his word in that way in terms of season development and a process of time but remember no matter how long the seasons no matter how long the process no matter how uncertain it may seem God's word will be fulfilled this is how he wants us to think before we read verse 11 so shall my word be that goeth forth from out of my mouth you can count on it it's going to go forth and when my word Goes Forth it falls like grain when my word Goes Forth it's like a seed in the ground think in terms of seasons and development it shall not return unto me void when I say something it's not going to come back empty but it shall accomplish that which I please and it shall prosper in the thing where to I sent it well I want to be a thing if he says brother man says this this is a there's a place let us act out this place that he's placed Us in in the last days this is where we're facing yet the completion of that word we're on a road back to the original beginning of the creation back to the Garden of Eden again husband and wife without any sin or anything to live Eternal eternally he says in the message God's power to transform he says that it's what I believe he says as long as it would have stayed in God's Great economy every word in its place as long as that creation would have existed there'd be no death as long as it stayed like that God's Great economy and he's looking at this perfect picture with no death he says it's where I believe that we're headed back to we're going back to that spot that place that seventh morning God looked upon it all and said it's good I'm pleased with it yeah I'm glad I did it that's what we're coming back to that's the place we're coming to we're on a road back to that then I want to be the thing wherein it sent that's what we are I I guess I could even say it's not that I want that is what you are contrary to my desire contrary to what I want I I want you to catch this as a personal revelation that this is what I am today I am the thing where into to God has sent this promise it will come forth oh it looks pretty dark I know doesn't man are you sure that can really happen you sure that's going to work you sure this is going to come to pass like it ought to it's going to happen every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God will not return void it shall accomplish that which I please it shall prosper in the thing where to i s it there is intent behind his word there's a design there's a purpose behind what God says God has a distinct intention when giving his word he actually has a distinct audience in mind when he gets it gives it and he's looking at you the recipients the beding ground of it that place that he's placed Us in in these last days just say God let the seed fall into hearts and he says it will prosper I'm the God of all creation my word when I speak it is going to prosper now follow this as we look at this Isaiah chapter 55: 10 to13 this is a prophecy now when he says for as the rain cometh down and snow and it returns not thither but it bring for brings forth Bud gives seed to the so bread to the eater we could actually go back and look in Genesis 1 and Genesis 2 and see these very elements now that's really no big profound mystery because that's when God created everything but think of the process even where God is giving the command to man that he may eat of the herb that he may eat of the these certain plants in the field and that this is the process that God in the very beginning is saying that there's going to be seed sown there's going to be things that bud you're going to have a right to them to eat them he's describing creation and then with that seeing in mind he says whatever I say is going to come to pass my word is like this it goes Goes Forth out of my mouth it will will not return void it will accomplish that with I please it'll Prosper the thing where unto i s it what he actually speaking of this is actually a prophecy what he says here is a prophecy of the Redemption of everything God created you say well is it really EX exactly that well I can at least say this it applies because he's saying I what I say will come to pass and God has prophesying the Redemption of all of creation what God spoke in the beginning will be perfected I seed these seeds in Genesis 1 they're not going to return into me void they're not going to get corrupted they're not going to be defiled they're not going to lay dormant forever I will see the fruit of every original spoken word seed so the very language that we're following here and catch the connection to Creation catch connection to the fall because Isaiah 5510 to13 is prophesying the Redemption of the original wow the completion of the original notice how we follow this language rain falling upon the Earth seed coming forth to be swn again to become bread to the eater my word is like that it will not return to be void it will accomplish it will prosper verse 12 for ye shall go out with joy and led forth with peace how this is this is a climax right this is a culmination it says ye shall go out with joy that means this is how it's finishing you go go out with a bang that means you finished with the flurry you did or if you go out with a whimper this going out speaks of a climax this going out speaks of Triumph it's I I if you're going to go out with joy if you're going to go out with peace this is something where you're being ushered forth in a climactic moment in a climax of something and the Very length Ang that's used of joy and peace ought to already begin to uh conjure up in our mind Joy to the World Peace on Earth why this is the very blessing that comes with the Messiah joy and peace and Isaiah chapter 9: 6 to7 now I I wanted to read this here I had it placed in another spot but the Lord just draw me back to this for you shall go out with joy and be led forth with peace this is the promise of the Redeemer and the Messiah For unto us a child is born unto us a son has given now I want you to keep this hold this in mind I may be getting this a little bit of out of order but now they're wanting you to think a child is going to be born a son is going to be given now that's not peculiar here in Isaiah chapter nine to the passage of time many sons have been born but this is a language though that's to make a connection this is a language to get man thinking in a particular way every man is born of a woman children have been born sons have been born but now this prophecy y of a son being born a son being given a child born but it's a son given and then it says and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name Shall be Called wonderful counselor wonderful counselor the Mighty God the Everlasting father the prince of peace now this conjures up an image of Genesis 1 and two this speaks to even the silence that would have been between Genesis 2 and Genesis 3 why here's one with the government upon it shoulders the Dominion not just of a natural people but it's of the world a child is given a child is born a son is given the government The Authority the power he's wonderful counselor Mighty God Everlasting father the Prince of Peace why peace is going to reain upon all the Earth it's from this prophecy that the Jews believed that the Messiah would be a natural man of a natural Kingdom that even under his Rule and Reign all Gentiles all reprobates all Humanity would come to his light in the entire world would exist in peace in natural lands the Prince of Peace of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end so this is going out this is something that's ushered in and it never leaves it's the climax culmination government and peace shall have no end upon the throne of David and upon his kingdom to order it and to establish it and with judgment and with Justice from henceforth forever the Zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this the Divine energy which has spoken it you could take Isaiah 9 6-7 you could take it count on it it's going to happen why the Zeal of the lord of the hosts his power his energy the transforming power within the seed will perform this that's what he's saying in Isaiah 55 I will accomplish whatever I say whatever do the Zeal of the Lord will perform this for ye shall go out with joy and be led forth with peace notice the connection with creation the mountains and the hills shall Break Forth before you singing into singing and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands what's happening creation is rejoicing at this right a picture of trees breaking forth H into clapping and mountains uh breaking forth and singing and the hills skipping think of this picture that's being expressed that creation is going to be satisfied amen all of creation is rejoicing as we've been reading in Romans chapter 8 through a few services verse 22 for we know that the whole creation granth and travaileth in pain together until now waiting for this explosion how many Of You' have ever gone up to the preacher after he's preached his heart out on a Sunday morning and you said men brother I almost shouted I almost jumped out of my seat I you know I almost started dancing you almost right you just and something just caused you to compose yourself this is how creation has been from the very moment that man fell at that precipice as it was at this spot groaning and travailing something bubbling forth in it something longing something Desiring something wanting to see Longing To See and not in a hope so but in a know so that one day I have been made subject by the fall of Adam to vanity but not without hope as the scripture says I have been made subject in hope that one day I know all of creation knows as if it's been in designed in Mother Nature within herself within her Springs within her mind within her patterns it is sown within her every cycle every season every Dawn every setting of the Sun every passing of the Comet every conjunction of planets it's all testifying in hope that one day it's going to be delivered into the Glorious Liberty of the manifestation of the sons of God and that the whole world's been in birth pains why because it was made pregnant with expectation of a blessing of a power of a government of a kingdom of a Perfection and I can't help but think and I know we've probably all done it before we think about what we're taught in this word and in this message about creation about our association with it about the power that we have through the word of God and the Dominion we given man was made as the God over Earth and we go hunting and we think God bring that big buck and we want to draw in some kind of power some kind of association with creation we're fishing I want to catch a lunker right brother Preston I want to catch a I want to catch a double diit bass Lord I I'm a son of God here I am and we long for this and and we think in those terms but creation doesn't long to be gigged by your arrow so it can be put on the wall and you could have backstrap fajitas it longed for something different and so the image that comes into my mind when I begin to think about creation groan and longing is when we see the manifestation of the third pole when brother Bam's there in Colorado we immediately begin to identify oh yes he said spoke to the storm that's the spoken word upon creation but the manifestation of that doesn't stop there God says would you walk with me this is the full reality of the word of God would you walk with me and he begins to walk says there I am in virgin Timber Untouched by man back to what it would have been in the beginning he says in every motion all of a sudden I was young again there's his wife walking together with him and what happens creation's drawn to him he says he has his gun there he notice the pitter patter the tears falling on dry leaves and creation is all of a sudden drawn why because in this manifestation there must have been a birth pain creation must have been having a contraction at that very moment again to sense what is this what is happening there in Colorado on this Mountaintop do I see the deer drawn to it do I see a Son of God in his position again oh Hallelujah why creation is groaning the hills Want to Break Forth in the singing the trees want to clap their hands why it's been made pregnant with hope contining now verse 13 notice the connection When God says I say something it's going to happen notice the connection says instead of the thorn shall come up the fur tree and instead of the Brier shall come up the Myrtle tree and it shall be the the Lord for a name for an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off what is he referring to he says the Zeal of the Lord will perform this because this is going to be increase of his government of Peace there shall be no end now when it speaks to the throne of David well finally finally we're going to have a Kingdom of Israel that'll never be overthrown no what you see in Israel is just the repeat of what you saw in the garden a kingdom fall and so Israel's just in this cycle of Revival and death Revival and death and we can say well this is a prophecy that Israel will be restored to its glory and it'll never diminish but it's actually God saying creation all of creation will be redeemed and it'll never end and he says this it'll be for an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off why the very first cutting off is in Genesis 3 that's when what looked like a an eternal uh something that would never be that that's when there's a something that drops down out of it it seemes interrupted God's prophesying of redemption and as he speaks of it the Thor instead of a thorn and a fur tree instead of a Brier the Myrtle tree it's a prophecy of the curse on creation being lifted because God deals with the Thorns he deals with the Briars he deals with the joy he deals with happiness he deals with fear it's all being addressed here in Isaiah 55 Genesis chapter 3 now as we come to this in our text I think it's just a good spot right here in the middle of our sermon today Genesis chapter 3 now because this is where we're going to draw from this language we'll pick up in verse 15 if you want to turn there it not only brings the curse but it's the first prophecy of Christmas I I I probably would desire amen's or at least a wow or interesting or as some people go okay you know they're like uhhuh where are you going with this it's the first prophecy of Christmas I guess the the word Christ Christmas is um sometimes we associate it with Catholicism a Christ Mass but you know What Christmas Means the very word means the sending of Christ Christmas is it's not a mass of Christ we think of a gathering and and the Eucharist in the ca Catholic service but the word Christ Mass the very word means the sending of Christ the sending forth of Christ and so if God's word first Goes Forth as a SE Genesis 3 holds not just the curse but the very first mention of sending Christ it's the very first prophecy that we can identify that there is going to be Redemption right that yes man has fallen by virtue of The Serpent and the interaction of the woman and it's it's sucked in Adam and all these things have happened and transpired and then we see as we begin to read this here in just a moment we can see that well God's speaking to address this there must be a restoration coming in Redemption so Genesis 3 is not only a curse but it's actually a prophecy of peace on Earth it's a prophecy of Joy it's a prophecy of a son being given the Prince of Peace the Mighty God the very image that Adam held the hope of there's going to come one that will fulfill everything that Adam couldn't or at least didn't Genesis chter 3 let's read verses 15 we'll read all the way to 21 may get a little a little bit out of order but let's read together speaking to the serpent and I'll put enity between thee and the woman hatred animosity a fight and between thy seed and her seed no more would these two be able to uh H uh uh interact as it had between thy seed and the seed of the woman the phrase phrasing used there is very rich to suggest son Offspring between thy seed and her son it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise and then the scripture showing it his heal this is a prophecy of a son coming forth right and we we we've mentioned this before we could be we can be absolutely certain of it because the word of God declares it and then we see that Satan immediately acts in response to it in the next chapter by what killing the son of Adam why because he's like a son's going to be given and he's gonna he's going to interrupt try to interrupt my program he's going to try to stop me he's going to try to crush my head my thought my intent my purpose my design what I've tried to sew into mankind this is going to be dealt with this is going to be addressed so he's looking for the heal of the man that's going to crush him and it's so this is the prophecy of a son being given this is the prophecy of Christ right Genesis 3 3:15 it's the first prophecy of Christmas there's going to be a sun given that's right he's going to be born and he's going to deal with the curse but now as it begins to continue notice the the uh um the if I I want to give this backdrop to verse 15 but I love how God prophesies this first because it says this in verse 16 and under the woman he said I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception in sorrow Thou shalt bring forth children and thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee a double Covenant that's now been introduced and in the courage that comes upon the woman I want you to catch the key here the phrasing to conceive and bring forth I'm going to greatly multiply or multiply I'm going to multiply greatly multiply thy sorrow in thy conception or the sorrow of conception in sorrow Thou shalt bring forth children so now this this is not associated with pleasure but this is something that's a pain this is a distress I will greatly multiply your grief your suffering and pregnancy and the Pains of childbearing with spasms of distress you shall bring forth children any amens amen I didn't expect a loud one from a brother but the reality of this every woman who's brought forth a child knows it from the very conception there's things that begin to take place within a woman's body that are distressful from the nausea the fainting the weakness the changing of the body God is saying that now child conception and bearing and caring and development and and then delivery is going to be associated with sorrow and you're going to conceive and it's going to be a pain and it's going to be through sorrow and distress that you're going to bring forth the process of conceiving and bringing forth a child from conception to birth is going to be marked by pain suffering and distress I you could very well say that in the beginning God said be fruitful multiply but now her multiplying is going to be associated with pain in suffering and distress and the curse of the woman is in conception and delivery conception and delivery I'll greatly multiply thy conception and thou shalt bring forth so keep that in mind is the Bible said unto us a child is born a son is given now this very image the woman is cursed in conception and bringing forth now verse 17 and under Adam he said because thou has hearkened under the voice of thy wife and Hast eaten of the tree of which I commanded thee saying Thou shalt not eat of it now notice the point of the curse cursed is the ground for thy sake now there's sorrow but of a different sort and sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life now notice the connection with Isaiah chapter 55 the rain comes down Waters the Earth the the herb grows the seed grows the wheat grows comes to Bud the so the the one that has sowed Harvest to takes some seed he SWS it again he makes bread for the eater and he's saying in sorry you're going to eat bread all the days of the life he says thorn s also and thistles shall it bring forth unto thee what did the Bible say in Isaiah 55 and the point I'm trying to drive home by using that scripture is if God spoke it it will come to pass it will accomplish what he pleases he says these thorns and these thistles are going to be replaced with the fur tree and with a myrtle tree it's God now catch the connection with Isaiah 55 that when Isaiah 55 is spoken God is saying what I said would happen in the beginning is going to be fulfilled it will be accomplished he says what I've spoken will come to pass and he addresses the very curse upon mankind because Genesis 3:15 to 21 is speaking of sorrow and conception and birth and thorns and thistles and thou shalt eat the herb of the field in the sweat of thy face Thou shalt eat bread till thy return into the ground for out of it was thou taken for dust Thou Art and unto dust shalt thou return what is God prophesying the cycle of life and death Adam you came from the earth because of the Fall you're going to go right back to the Earth it's going to be a process whereby every man is going to be uh subdued by the Earth think about it that you came he came forth this body came forth from the earth and as he was given power to subdue it now that's taken away it's as if mankind ultimately succumbs back to the Earth even though he's eating substance from the earth ultimately it can't keep him alive forever he succumbs to it and it's prophesying this cycle of Life Death Life Death the subduing under the Flesh of the flesh back to dust and so as the woman was cursed in conception in childbirth now through Adam and then by virtue of through Adam all of humanity creation is cursed the woman the the serpent is cursed and here he singularly takes upon a curse and he's transformed to crawl upon his belly and there's enity put up up between seeds and he's characterized in a particular way and he suffers this curse then the woman individually is cursed now Adam he says for thy sake I'm going to curse the Earth Adam came from the earth and now the whole earth holds a stain and think about it you know how in school uh when we used to go to school that somebody would do something and and the teacher would make the point or maybe we don't have to talk about school you say within the family well because so and so did this the rest of you are going to suffer and maybe it's not put in those words but well we would have had punch and cookies today for recess but Johnny wanted to act up today so we're all just going to lay our heads down for 30 minutes and it's like one guy we all suffer come on think about what happened to the Earth we say Adam fell well listen Adam fell no question but when Adam lost his position all of Earth lost its position Earth is like perfect I'm perfect I'm awesome and he's bragging about his Adam and he's bragging about it all all he can do and he's you see Adam you see how he is is this great see how he named all of us in this great creation is just bursting at the same and then Adam makes a mistake and it's like what what happened and it's like well it's not just Adam you're getting it buddy like what did we do we didn't doing anything this wasn't even a real tree it was a serpent that did it then it was Adam and we didn't do anything but they're punished all of creation lost its position when Adam fell that's why it's important for us men to be in our position amen because if you're out of position the rest is out of position and he brings it to this when we see this it lost its position when its ruler fell there's a stain upon Earth all of Humanity's curs says the ground is cursed for thy sake and then the whole cycle of life and death is is within the Earth by virtue of man's fall now looking again at verse 15 as I said a moment ago this is the first prophecy of Christmas why because it's the first Prophecy of the coming or the sending of the Messiah Christ and it's not God it's not just God in the sense of him being a supernatural spirit that would somehow uh his voice would kind of Thunder out over creation as it was on Mount Si or he would do things in in an unseen way and he would kind of in an invisible way remedy things and move things and correct things and everybody just like oh everything's back to normal but it prophesies of God becoming flesh so that he becomes a Kinsman to the one that he's redeeming now when you think of the law of the goel and the kinsman redeemer and what we see of how the rules of redemption and the laws of redemption that are placed within Israel and how a Kinsman and a near Kinsman had rights of redemption we could say that that was given as a type of what was to come but it's actually the it was actually the type following the prophecy of the Kinsman we we could already look to scripture and see that God was going to use a near Kinsman a son was going to be given a son of a a seed of a woman was going to come forth and he was going to be a kinsman redeemer and this is where the law of redemption first is introduced when the Messiah is spoken of in Genesis 3:15 and so this is the part that I I just love to keep emphasizing this before the woman's cursed before the Earth is cursed before they're driven out before they're completely banished before they lose all consciousness of what e the Eden was the Garden of Eden was God prophesies Redemption amen the seed of the Messiah is lifted up the prophecy of sending Christ is first mentioned before the curse and God foreshadowed in Genesis 3 what this Redeemer would be he foreshadowed that Christmas was would bring forth a lamb it and what and we could we can look back hindsight is 2020 don't Flinch when we say 2020 but we look back and we can see now it was an innocent child laying in a Manger that came born of a woman just think of how vulnerable even that child is in the womb and here this child comes forth and here is the Redeemer of all the world innocent and God foreshadows this in Genesis 3:21 unto Adam also and to his wife the Lord God did the Lord God make coats of skin and clothe them what happened God took an innocent lamb as you could as we would read it just as it might seem to unfold chronologically this way you could see all the creation is in this state of holding its breath because now fears entered into creation mankind is acting acting in a way that's completely uncharacteristic of man first sewing fig leaves together and all these things all the excitement commotion everything that would be happening in creation everything's being upset and creation as it is is holding its breath and the serpent is cursed you're going to crawl upon your belly you're going to eat dust all the days of your life and I'm going to put imity between thy seed and the woman's son and he's going to crush your head but you'll bruise his heel and creation is still holding its breath and then the Earth is cursed so there's there's a sense of oh oh we're being brought into bondage we're being made subject to vanity and all the creation is holding its breath as each one these these things are being ushered forth but then all of a sudden God speaks to Adam and gives him a revelation and Adam goes forward to the very lamb that he would have named grabs him by the neck the innocent lamb and now the lamb begins to bleat and there's so many different statements brother Bron makes about this where he just a few statements where now with sudden this lamb begins to speak a language Adam doesn't understand and Adam has to take this lamb and what take its life slay it and shed its blood and then take the skins of this innocent lamb and this lamb is being taken what have I done what did I do I was not complicit I was not a player I was not used I I have done nothing I'm innocent but now it begins to bleach and speak a language that Adam doesn't understand but what is the language of the language of the innocent dying that mankind could be redeemed and he slays the lamb an innocent lamb sheds its blood to cover guilty mankind what is it foreshadow an innocent sinless infant in a Manger that's a that's a phrase I believe it's even a course to a song he was a baby born to die now we can say about all men that it's a put under men once to die and after that the judgment and that all of us are born with a clock ticking inside of us that one day we'd go to a grave but this baby was born for the purpose of dying we Comfort ourselves in knowing that once our purpose is finished we cannot be taken until that time that once we have satisfied God's purpose so that we have some ultimate purpose we have a design we have a something that God wants want us to do and once it's been satisfied Satan doesn't have a right to us but now think of the purpose of this child his purpose was to die and God foreshadows it in Genesis 3:21 and then the very prophecy of a messiah Isaiah 536 I I I found this scripture just to be uh it just kind of turned over for me this past week all we like sheep have gone astray now notice even the characteristic how it's connected with this lamb in the beginning who would have been slain We Know by teaching of the word of God slain and dressed with over mankind he says we've turned everyone to his own way and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all and how does it describe us it's very interesting like sheep we've gone astray so our very backslid and our iniquity and our failure is characterized as a Wandering sheep but yet it's a lamb that God needs to redeem us why did he have to come as an innocent lamb to redeem sheep that have gone astray we're Redeemed by that innocent lamb and notice what it says in Genesis 3:20 I I I I'm I try might pick up the pace a little bit here because now we got we have to associate ourselves with this particular part Genesis 3 chapter 20 and God called his wife's name Eve because she was the mother of all living the the mother of all living is sign ifies this it's not that she brought forth every single child that exist in the Earth today but it was true then that she would she was the first to bring forth life and she was the mother of those that were born not that Adam was the father of all living but she was the mother of all living so it's that all living are represented in that conception and that bringing forth as the curse was placed upon the woman versus prior in thy conception is going to be sorrow and bringing forth is going to be sorrow all living now she's the mother of all living all living have come from that curse and so now we come to Genesis chter 4: 1 to two and consider the contrast now to the birth of Christ Christmas is a recognition the celebration of or ought to be the celebration of the birth of Jesus Christ and a baby born an innocent baby born the the the bringing forth of life now let's go to the first birth is in Genesis 4 contrasting with the birth of Christ and Adam knew Eve his wife and she conceived and bear these are the very elements of Genesis three's curse she conceived and be can and said I have gotten a man from the Lord why it's almost her trying to connect the prophecy of gen Genesis 3:15 to this son I have been given a son I've been given a seed I've gotten a man from the Lord we know that all life comes from God and she again Bears she conceived and now bear again so there's one conception she Bears two sons and she bear his brother Abel and Abel was a keeper of sheep and Cain was a tiller of the ground it should point be it should stand out to us that God these these things that are mentioned here in Genesis 4 are now answering back to the fall answering back to the very curse because Abel comes forth and what does he do by Revelation he's given the position to be a keeper of sheep and this aligns this son of Adam with the Revelation that the Redeemer is going to be a sacrificial lamb because it was the blood of the lamb in the garden that covered Adam and Eve as they were banished from the garden now Abel then is connected with Redemption he's connected with innocence he's connected with the sacrifice though the Sheep lost its life it was sinless it was innocent and it shed its blood but now Cain becomes a tiller of the ground and we can see that this connects back to the curse where now Cain is associated with the ground which is cursed and he's going to bring an offering from the ground which is cursed but Abel's going to bring a revelation to as a sacrifice of a lamb and what's being described here in Genesis 41-2 she conceived and bear Cain and she bear Abel this answers to Genesis 3:16 it is the actual coming to pass how that you're going to conceive and you're going to bring forth children she conceived and bear can it's an answer to Genesis 3:16 she conceived she became pregnant she was with child she Bears she brought forth she travailed now all of humanity comes forth through this curse with this stain let me go quickly through job and Psalm and Isaiah job says man that is born of a woman is of a few days and full of trouble he cometh forth like a flower and is cut down he fleeth also as a shadow and thought what is it man's life is but a vapor it just vanishes away he's born he grows he's strong and all of a sudden he dies and it's just maybe hundreds of years at one time now just decades and dust thou open Thine Eyes Upon such a one let mean he cometh forth like a flower and is cut down he fleeth also as a shadow and conth not and Dost thou open Thine Eyes Upon such a one and bringest me into judgment with thee he says who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean not one amen what is he referring to man man how can you take an unclean humanity and bring forth clean Humanity next chapter job 15:14 what is man that he should be clean and he which is born of a woman that he should be righteous job has a revelation of how a man born of a woman is Fallen comes through a channel that is cursed job 25 how then can man be justified with God how can he be clean that is born of a woman EES the mother of all living it puts a stain upon all that are born because they're not born according to Genesis 1:20 they're born according to a fall behold I was shapen in iniquity Psalm 515 and in sin did my mother conceive me it answers to Genesis 3:16 a man born of a woman shapen in iniquity in sin I was conceived Isaiah 64:6 but we are all as an unclean thing and our all our righteousness are as filthy rags and we all do Fade as a leaf and our iniquities like the wind have taken us away these are all real encouraging scriptures right we're all why that speaks of us well sometimes it's this is what we can at least amen yeah this is something that ought to be very real to all of us let me say if this has not began to Dawn upon you how could you ever really repent full ownership acknowledgement accepting responsibility the subsequent response of evidence of remorse and guilt in repenting and Desiring to be changed brother BR says in spoken words of the Original Seed every man no matter whether he's a pope priest Bishop whatever is he dies because he's a hybrid every man is a hybrid every man does that mean you yes you every man every woman right there can be this I I call it an arrogance or or or the a misplaced righteousness where because we were taught the original sin the subsequent uh fallout of the original sin and serpent seed and because we take with serpent seed there's a seed of discrepancy and that serpent seed cannot humble itself to the word of God we have this little template that we use that we just impose upon people and go oh they're serpent seed as if you're not cuz think about it what was the serpent seed hybrid right but we use this oh you're pure bread from the serpent I'm pure bread from Adam hold on wait a minute every man is born a hybrid now it seems heavy we can talk about it later and walk through it in in a way that may qualify it for you in a way that you could be at peace with it but this flesh is hybrid just like can's and brother Brandon says that's exactly he was born between Satan and Eve every man every woman they may call it whatever you want it was Satan Eve the original word had nothing to do with it the original word was life he hybrid it and it brought death this body right here Bears within it the stain of the fall and it is hybrid but thank God for a promise that it will be subdued and we will be changed in our atoms amen and that there is a glorified body awaiting the elect but every man born of a woman is born between The Serpent and the woman born by the ambition of Satan he is hybrid and being hybrid there's death swn into this flesh right but what God has spoken must come to pass he will not be disappointed he will remember his Covenant with creation brother Bram said and seeed not air with the shock the kingdom of God which is in the Earth today can never be set up justly on a permiss of will oh this Thrills me and this just means I'm going to have to go longer he says the kingdom of God which is in the Earth today can never be set up justly on a permissive will it's got to come back to his perfect will the kingdom of God which is on Earth today cannot come back to its right position cannot come back to the original design until it leaves the permissive and comes back to the perfect has to so of the son to whose kingdom would be know no end and the increase of it would never falter or fail as we keep in mind she's the mother of all living and a man born of the woman is born with this stain and this fall Isaiah 7:14 therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son now what's remarkable about that well you can say every child that's ever been born has been conceived and that it has been born of a woman but the language is purposeful a virgin shall conceive so we've got to immediately begin to think this is something that's happening differently but it uses the language to conceive and bear conceive and bring forth and it goes right back to Genesis 315 and 16 I'm going to give a woman a seed and he's going to crush your head and then he says to the woman in sorrow you'll conceive in sorrow you'll bear and now it says Behold a virgin shall conceive a son bear a son and shall call his name Emmanuel in the Hebrew we read is God With Us or with us is God this is different this is different in Matthew 1:23 Behold a virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth it's the same language of Genesis 3 the same language of Isaiah shall be with child shall bring forth the son and they shall call his name Emanuel and then the writer interprets it which being interpreted is God god with us this prophecy is directly connected with the curse this prophecy is directly connected with Genesis 4:1 because we see the elements of a woman can being promised that she would have received seed and bring forth a son now Isaiah 7 is saying oh virgin shall conceive and bring forth a son Matthew 1:23 is saying a woman shall be with child bring forth a son his name will be God with us Emmanuel this is a great promise and it's connected in of set against the curse and the Very things that happen in Genesis 4:1 where a woman conceived and bear but it's not just in that that it runs up against it it's an answer to the fall because this is the language that's used Behold a virgin shall conceive it's one of you it's one of you to take begin to catch now this is going to be different though of a woman God's going to bypass the original sin and the and the innocence of the woman that brings it forth brings us back to the innocence of the Garden of Eden brings us back to Redemption as we read before from spoken words in the Original Seed how brother B said that the woman would have eventually brought forth that child she would have brought forth that child she would have finally done it did not God tell her multiply and replenish the Earth this is a promise oncoming thing this was something for her she never fulfills it but yet she becomes the mother of all living but not to bring forth this child she couldn't anymore so if you look at Matthew chapter 1 the Bible says the book of the generation of Jesus Christ and he began to read Abraham begat Isaac Isaac begat Jacob Jacob begat Judas and his brother Judas at FES and and it begins to go through each one and it describes 15 different begats AG gendering or bringing forth all according to Genesis 3:16 all according to Genesis 3:20 Eve the mother of all living conceived a particular way brought forth a son a particular way now Matthew chapter 1 through these first 16 verses begins to describe a beting a gendering a bring forth it would be conceive and bear conceive and Bear conceive and bear all the way to verse 16 Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary and then it recaptures the different Generations in verse 17 but then Verse 18 now the birth of Jesus Christ when it says the birth of Jesus Christ this Jesus Christ is the he of Genesis 3:15 I I know I've mentioned it a number of times and those who take very good notes could probably flip back and say he's been saying this since July but we're we're going to lay this in the foundation it's going to be here it's going to be a part of our understanding this Jesus Christ is the he of Genesis 3:15 now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise or after this manner and it's written this way to be a contrast to every other child that has come forth as the writer took pains to read through all these different generations and say 15 different times that a man begat a son a man begat the son it wants to stop and say wait a minute I know that Joseph was born from from uh from Jacob and he was the the husband of Mary but I want you to know what happens next is out of order of all these other ones the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise this is different when as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph before they came together she was found with child of the Holy ghost the Bible departs from the use of the word begat begat and uses a word that's only used twice and says the birth of Jesus the conjugation of this means the Genesis or the Nativity of Jesus was on this wise a man had a son a man had a son it even takes a place here where it says Rahab and Tamar and Ruth these ones receive seed and bear a son receive seed and bear a son but the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise before she knew Joseph the child born in her was not like every other son born in the earth after a natural man giving conception to a woman but this one is different it denotes something peculiar as it even says in Matthew 1:1 the book of the generation of Jesus Christ in other words he has a different origin story he's not another Adam he's the second Adam but not a junior not a grandson he's a different he's another creation alog together and brother Bram said about Genesis 120 here lays the word it's there here's the word the word that God spoke to multiply and replenish the Earth it couldn't find a place to land amen finally this word caught into the womb of a virgin finally finally why God said it it must come to pass in Luke 1:31 to35 and behold Thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth the son this is the very thing that God said to the woman would suffer and suffer with and go through behold Thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and shalt call his name Jesus he shall be great and he shall be called the son of the highest and the Lord God shall give unto him the Throne of his father David and he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever and of his kingdom there shall be no end unlike Adam whose kingdom ended this Adam this son will be the son of the highest in his kingdom shall know no end his glory shall know no bounds here's a woman conceiving just as Genesis 3:16 said would happen here's a woman bringing forth the son just as Genesis 3:15 would happen but this son's different shall be great the son of the highest then notice Mary's response The Logical conclusion Mary said to the angel how shall this be seeing I know not a man the angel answered s to her the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also that Holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called The Son of God it's come back full circle the original program of God the original plan of God it all comes back behold this virgin conceives and brings forth the son and a holy thing is born and who is he not a Son of God the Son of God the only begotten Son of God so he can become a Kinsman to all living and what was it I'm going to have to skip over a number of these quotes very very quickly here the Bible says he is the beginning of the creation of God I know I've been lengthy to this point and I don't know how much longer I I I can hold up as far as energy but Jesus Christ this babe conceived of this woman referred to in Luke 1 Matthew chapter 1 this Christ is the beginning of the creation of God Amen Revelations 3:14 brother Bram says when he preaches revelation of Jesus Christ and Le to seen age he's the beginning of the creation of God how could God be created if he's a spirit how could he be he's Eternal he never was created he never will be created because he's God at the beginning but he that is the beginning of the creation of God was Jesus Christ when he was made manifest when God lived in him he is God's creation so in the beginning God created and he had the substance own but God's going to create again and the next time he creates is not a creation but a creation of himself to exist within creation he says in Revelation chapter 4 part three he is the beginning of the creation of God God is eternal but when God was created when a little baby that was conceived in the womb of a mother a virgin and she began to develop these cells within her to bring forth this little baby that was the beginning of God's creation for God was made flesh and dwelt Among Us and became Emanuel God With Us the beginning of the creation of God isn't it wonderful to think that Jesus Christ was not the son of Mary was not the son of Joseph after the flesh but yet he is the very creation of God proving his word what did he come to do to redeem that part of the earth he was the beginning of the creation of God because God is not a creation only in Christ he is a creation and that's how you in Christ are a new creature amen praise the Lord only in Christ is he a creation because God is eternal and a spirit and the spirit is not created he was the beginning of the creation of God and God redeemed that body he also multiplied bread and fish the B virgin born son what was it to prove the word to prove that it's back to the original to prove that it's a Son of God the with dominion and power and control he was the beginning of the creation of God God in creation god with a little part of the creation here that God was living in himself he was the beginning of that creation of God from him begets many sons all right there got to be more he says note he also multiplied the fishes he is the word and the proof of that word and he begets many sons he's the first of that Creation Church age book he it was God created in the form of man now by his Spirit he's creating many sons un himself God the Creator creating himself a part of his creation this is the true revelation of God this was his purpose can you see in the beginning God created what was expressed what was manifested now in Christ it's God creating himself as a part of creation when in Jesus Christ am and now it continues with you this is the true revelation of God because it was his purpose to be and here you are you are the word and the proof of the word so could you understand John chap 3: 3-7 a little bit better not that you didn't understand it this well before but just in this context Jesus as Nicodemus comes to him you you must be from God to do these things you have to be from God verily verily I said to thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God to understand just how peculiar this phrase was to Nicodemus they they share his response how can a man be born when he's old can he enter the second time into his mother's womb and be born because that's all birth was that's all bringing forth was they didn't know any other way than to come forth from your mother's womb so he says except a man be born again the phrase is common to us because as Christians we think Born Again Born Again born again but just think of having never heard of a second birth not thinking of a spiritual birth and Jesus says um you got to be born again you have to become birth again the phrase would have invoked all these images and so Nicodemus says so I I got to go back into my mother's womb and come out again and Jesus says verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born of water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God then he says that which is born of the flesh is flesh that which is born of the spirit is Spirit Marvel not when I say unto thee ye must be born again why would we Marvel at it and in marveling we ought not distort it this is the most important teaching that Jesus gives here in John chapter 3 you must be born again nothing else is going to make any sense nothing else is going to last nothing else it's all going to be temporary you shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover great you get sick you get sick again but to be born again you pass from death into life amen shall not come into judgment to be born again is to be sealed by God into eternal life there there's no threat of punishment there's no threat of death so Jesus saying listen that which is born after the flesh is flesh it will die but if you are born again a second time says Born Again from above then you are spiritual so don't don't wrestle with it don't Marvel at it just do it you must be born again I'll catch this and I may stop short today uh in terms of not finishing this but at least I've made it to this statement here does God ever change his mind does God change his mind about his word now think of this it just was so beautiful how God locked this to opened this up to me but if the people won't walk in his perfect will he does have a permissive will he will let you walk in we're familiar with his teaching on this permissive will perfect will he permits it all right but he will make it work out for his glory in his perfect will now we think of incidences in our lives we think of different uh things that take place and listen let me challenge you God works it for the good and God will work it to his perfect but it's necessary for us to acknowledge when we have walked in per permissive and not always self-justified well it worked out didn't it all things work together for the good sons of God are led by the spirit of God and we use that to justify everything we say everything we do well I'm sorry it hurt you but I'm a Son of God so I must have said it for a reason or well you know it was a mistake but God allowed it no humility repentance acknowledgement but the principle is he won't if you don't walk imp perfect he permits permissive but he will make it work out for his perfect for his glory in his perfect will then he says just like in the beginning it was not God's perfect will for children to be born on Earth through sex no sir and I know there's a lot of statements and different things that's used in this we can we can at least accept that the way man came is not the way that God intended it no sir God created Man Out of the Dust of the earth breathed the breath of life into him and he became a living Soul he took from man a help meet and made a wife to him that was God's first and original will but when sin come in and did the thing that it did then he permitted now notice God's going back to the beginning for us to understand perfect and permissive God had a perfect first and original then sin comes in and God permits so it leaves the perfect and comes to permissive and he permits man to marry a wife legally and have children to her multiply and replen the Earth then if that's the way you're going to do it but you see it never was his perfect will so brother Bram says that God has a perfect will but man can leave the perfect will enter into permissive will but he will work it out for his glory in his perfect will so God has a perfect plan man falls into permissive but God will not leave Humanity within permissive God will work it back to perfect how he does it he's God I'm glad he's in charge of it so now God brother brandham in laying that pattern says let's go back to the beginning God had a perfect will man entered into permissive but God will work permissive back to his perfect so this is just so extending to me it's so beautiful Jesus says Marvel not that you must be born again to be born again is his perfect will but God allowed sin to come in and God then allows and permits your first birth but by virtue of your first birth you can be born again let's just think very simply today if you're never born you can never be born again so God had a perfect will man fell from perfect will he enters into permissive will but God will make it work out for his glory in his perfect will to be born again is his perfect will we come born of a woman man is of a few days in full of trouble he's how can it be clean how can it be clean how can it be clean the scripture says over and over and over again but God takes the first birth which he permitted and he leads us to a new birth God taking the permissive and leading it to his perfect says in Romans 8:29 for whom he did Forno he also did predestinate to be be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the first born among many Brethren according to Genesis 3:20 the mother of all living according to Genesis 3:16 a woman conceiv in sorrow and bring for or is it through Genesis 3:15 a son is going to be given that he might be the first born among many Brethren that if we acknowledge the birth of Christ we have to likewise acknowledge we must have one too to be born again from above puts us in affinity and relationship to God the same as Christ was to God he's predestinated as to it in future home brother says the Holy Blood that was created by God the blood of the life the creation of God Jesus was the beginning of the creation of God oh my you see it God made in creation he was Spirit the Bible say he's the beginning of the creation of God how did he begin in the womb of a woman he says which is what how then blind people can't see the serpent seed right here Eve was put here on Earth and before Satan ever touched her or anything God said multiply and replenish the Earth it's right but Satan comes in here if that was Adam's son then that Adam was a direct descent from God and you only take the nature of your parent he's trying to understand how Cain was what he was but he's teaching us another lesson because then he says and when you're born again you take the nature of your parent of Heaven you only take the nature of your parent Jesus was the beginning of the creation of God when you're born again you take the nature of your parent of Heaven and the word is the attribute of your parent and how can you deny it the word for denominations can't you people blind people see that's the seed of the serpent oh my Satan got there before Adam that was the seed but she received a seed the woman Mary what was it God himself he was the beginning of the creation of God I know that I've emphasized this before and the message lifts it up you bride are the climax the culmination the finishing of the creation of God himself if Christ was the beginning then you shall go forth he shall go out with joy you shall go out with peace this is the climax of The Kingdom amen yeah right here in a Courtyard by Marriot right has gathered together today in Phoenix a people that are very Climax and culmination of joy and peace and the kingdom of God the beginning of the creation of God I've been at an hour and a half brother BR says in spoken words The Original Seed I have two quotes two scriptures God in the beginning commissioned Adam and Eve to multiply and replenish the Earth that's how sex was given that's why it was but what caused the hybriding brings death now we know there's a lot that can be assumed in how brother Brandon phrases that from does God change his mind to this and the few years in between there's different ways that there could be an understanding but what God caused the hybriding but what caus the hybriding bring death we'll get to it this afternoon in the two wombs now in this God foresaw and predestinated a world of sons and daughters he predestinated them to be there Genesis 1 128 be fruitful multiply replenish the Earth fill it up I have in my mind my thoughts Sons and Daughters of God and because a hybriding disbelieve in God's word caused a hybriding God God puts it back God's put it right back again that you don't have to be hybrid anymore you can come right back to the original word and be a Son of God just like he was supposed to be at the beginning listen it's not just repenting it's not just being baptized in the name of Jesus Christ you have to know there's a promise to be born again by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and that takes you out of the being subject to a hybrid flesh and it put you back to a son or daughter of God that you were supposed to be in the beginning oh isn't it wonderful I can be a Genesis one son of God in Satan's Eden he said Christ couldn't help being what he was he was the son of God see if you're intended you see the word of God you believe it because why there's something new have you ever heard of a strain in a family a son kind of impersonates his father the mother the grandfather the grandmother that's strain in the family we all know about strain in the family especially Thanksgiving Christmas can be family strain but he's talking about a different strain kind of a line a DNA a characteristic you've heard of iten aren't you well that's the same thing from predestination you were supposed to be here in the right way at the beginning but being that you come the way you did you're subject to the fall perfect will permissive will but being that you're predestinated you hear the word and it brings you right back where you were predestinated and what makes you believe the word of God and turn down these other things it's because you were there's something in you it's a family strain it's seed that's been swn into this Earth something put there by God that backsliding and marriages and denying and difficulties and despondency and depression and cancer and sickness and backsliding in decades of wed in sin cannot snuff out the life in that seed why because God stood there in the beginning and he spoke a word about you you and he says it will come back to me the way I want it to be he spoke it there's something in you way back Yonder you was supposed you are made to live here forever you're made for that God put it right back to where you don't have to be hybrid anymore you were made to live here forever I know I've been thinking about it differently over the last few months about we saying going home and and going up yonder and and I realize one day this Earth is going to be new again that's right and we shall reign on the Earth right forever Luke Chapter 2: 8-14 just think of this Christmas night as the song calls it Oh Holy Night I believe it was Charles Wesley that wrote hark the herald angel sing glory to the newborn king peace on Earth and mercy mild God and sinners reconciled dozens of scriptures that he's painting in this picture in this song joyful all ye nations rise join the the Triumph of the Skies with Angelic hosts proclaimed Christ is born in Bethlehem and this third verse says hail the heaven born Prince of Peace hail the son of righteousness light and Life to all he brings risen with healing in his wings he's referred to Isaiah 9:6 Malachi 4:2 light and Life to all he brings John 1 John 8 Second Timothy risen with healing in his wings mild he lays his glory by Philippians 2 John 17 born that man no more shall die it's John 11 he says born that man no more may die why you were made to live here forever Born to Raise the sons of earth born to give them second birth this is what it ought to mean to us is a recognition that we are identified in his birth I'm represented by this coming of the Messiah and that night there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field keeping watch over their flock by night and lo the angel of the Lord Came Upon them and the glory of the Lord Shone round about them and they were so afraid why Shepherds do we know why it had to be Shepherds because it was was a lamb that was born and ever since the blood of Abel began to speak it's angels that appeared to his kind Abel a shepherd and ever since the blood of Abel brother Bram talk about that blood from Abel from every goat every heer was bathed in the earth up until the time of the crucifixion of Christ why did it have to be Shepherds to join with the voice of Abel the blood of Abel that spoke of a better Covenant that spoke of better things and here they are watching the sheep and the angel come to the shepherd says fear not I bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people with joy with peace Thou shalt go forth for unto you is Born This Day in the city of David a savior which is Christ the lord send Christ the Christmas and this shall be a sign unto you you shall find the Babe wrapped in swaddling clothes lying in a Manger this is the announcement we we we mail out baby announcements or we post them on Instagram however we do it nowadays we're even getting virtual Christmas cards now people don't even need to they stopped writing things on them and they would just kind of hand them out generically well now they don't even hand them out you just get it in WhatsApp here's our Christmas card I I appreciate them all whatever form digital or otherwise but this was an announcement of a birth and the angels Angel comes the angel Lord is announcing it and when it's spoken think of these words are now not it's not just falling upon Mary and Joseph it's not just the testimony of Mary it's not just to Elizabeth and John and these those that that are that are being brought into this understanding and a revelation is being given but now this is a declaration from Heaven unto you born this day in the city of David a savior which is Christ the lord and you will find him innocently wrapped in swaddling clothes lying in a Manger this is the language not of a poet not of a songwriter but this is the description of the heaven said that there's one laying in a place where there was no room for him he laid in a Manger wrapped in swallen clothes this is the savior of the world and as if immediately spontaneously if you could just imagine as the verse says and suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the Heavenly Host praising God and saying I imagine that never has the heavens been lit to this Glory before and all of a sudden the singular Angel is joined with a host of other Angels my I just imagine that there's one that represents Christ and once the announcement is made all of Heaven declares his righteousness as if a br coming forth to join with the pronouncement glory to God in the highest could you imagine the light that would have shown the power that's being expressed and on Earth peace and Good Will towards Men Let it not just have a Melody to it but let it become a revelation how distinct this pronouncement was it doesn't even make sense man did nothing to this point to Merit it Israel had not finally got their act together and everything was ready it's like well here it is it's time it's time for the Messiah to come in the darkest in the worst the most depraved go back and find that they had restored the temple in Nehemiah looks like things are getting right what's the Book of Malachi you've done it for the last time Israel I'm done with you I'm turning to the Gentiles it's over yeah yeah all these ups and downs you finally you finally had the temple back you open the Scrolls you realize what you did wrong they fell right back into bondage again there was nothing about the Earth that would speak of a Genesis chapter 2 Genesis chapter where God says you know what this looks so good it didn't look like the seventh morning and he says you know what creation is ready for its climax the Christmas tree is trimmed now let's place our star at the top no it's at its lowest it's at its bottom it's depress craved the children of God Israel are lost and in bondage everything's upset they're under bondage to foreign government once again and here's what the angel says here's what the heavens declare glory to God in the highest we can all join in that but then on Earth peace what did on Earth peace how did man bargain this how did they come to the table and get this Tre but God just says I am declaring my Covenant with creation on Earth peace and this Good Will to men man did not Merit this will Humanity was not deserving of but yet God says Let There Be Peace On Earth and good will my kindness towards Humanity I say today I receive it in the name of the Lord this peace this will I receive amen for you shall go out with joy be led forth with peace Redemption was Rising a new day was Dawning and brother Bram says this brother Micah brother LOL if you could come this morning brother Bram makes this statement God is fixing to make another creation he's creating mortal Earth and Mortal life Angels sing in heaven you could go that's in Genesis 1 when God's created mortal life on Earth angels are singing in heaven but here he's creating a new life eternal life from man and he's singing to his subjects through his angels on the earth not in heaven heaven had eternal life they sang to the heavens when the Mortal creation come in and hear the immortal creation is coming in so just how it answers to Genesis 1 when there's creation there there's a singing to the heavens when the Mortal creation came in and here the immortal creation is coming in and now they're singing to Earthly people the first time to Shepherds he had started a new creation what was it a creation of himself God was made flesh and dwelt Among Us the Bible said in the beginning of the creation of God God was created in human form in Jesus Christ his son God dwelt he built his Tabernacle of Flesh and Bones and lived in that Tabernacle God Emmanuel God With Us he built himself a house to live in it so he could reflect his word to his subjects through through [Music] that you know what God is when you see [Music] Christ you know what God is when you see Christ if you could close your eyes for a moment and just Ponder this scene as brother brandham describes it Genesis 1 and 2 when mortal creation came in he says Earth sang to heaven but on the day that Christ was born Heaven sinks to Earth why it's a new creation God created in human form he says you know what God is when you see [Music] Christ I implore you to seek Him it may be kind of a catchy phrase but they say wise men still seek Him seek Him Today seek his face during this time or this season because you know what God is when you see [Music] Christ with heads bowed there be anyone that would want to receive him today [Music] say Lord I convicted of sin I know I'm not where I need to be and I recognize today as a son or daughter born of a woman that I need to repent of my sins and I want to come to you Lord asking for forgiveness of sins repenting Lord not as I have in the past traditionally year because somebody else was but today Lord I come to you asking for forgiveness that I might be born again from above New Life Quicken inside of me that I might leave my past behind walk in newness of life and become like Christ a new Creature if anyone want to receive him today I invite you to stand say Lord here I am I'm coming to you humbly offering you my heart here today on Christmas Eve the eve of a Christmas week Lord Here I Am Lord I Surrender my heart to you I yield to you God bless you who stood let's stand to our feet together and let's [Music] pray my gracious heavenly father I pray for these that have stood Lord we stood together with them Lord you you know their convictions you know their uh their conscience father you know where they are in their walk with you I pray today you would receive them where they are if it be in the Forgiveness of sins and repentance and water baptism to be sealed into the body of Christ Lord I join my faith with theirs that as they stood that omnipotence met the son is being born today a daughter is being born today Lord if it be in Consecration and renew oh Lord we join together with their voices and today I give you my heart I give you my life I give you my time Lord I give you all that I Am Lord I acknowledge shortcomings I acknowledge an edginess because of weariness Lord through flesh and mind Lord are we recognize that it's easy for us to get caught into a pattern and a mold of doing things a particular way but Lord today my mind has been brought back to a promise that when you say something you're going to do it Lord I believe you said that I must be born again therefore Lord I know I will be born again Lord you said there will be a bride I know there is a bride Lord what you spoke in the beginning must come to pass and today Lord as we think of your birth of your son Jesus Christ I think of myself being birthed as a Son of God on that day Lord when I was born again from above my life has never been the same came before and Lord may we join shoulder toosh shoulder stand Toe to Toe Lord may we just face the enemy with the Revelation that we're called for this hold to the vision Lord I pray that we could see this beautiful picture of once what what was once perfect you permitted but you have provided a way that we could come back to the perfect will That's What Christmas Means to Me Lord it means New Birth it means Redemption it means restoration back to the beginning so I pray father you take our hearts and sooe them today take our minds and calm them take our spirits and settle them may we go out with joy and peace may we claim peace on Earth Good Will towards men heal our bodies which are broken Lord and our energy and our mind and all the different maladies that we have within our
