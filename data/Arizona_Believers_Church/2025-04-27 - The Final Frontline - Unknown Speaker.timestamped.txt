[0:00] 1 Corinthians chapter 2 verse 16. For
[0:03] who hath known the mind of the Lord that
[0:05] he may instruct him. This is not only
[0:07] that he can instruct God because we see
[0:09] that in the Old Testament, but it's also
[0:11] who can instruct the spiritual man. And
[0:13] so someone who does not have the mind of
[0:15] God is not qualified to instruct one who
[0:18] is spiritual. For who hath known the
[0:20] mind of the Lord that he may instruct
[0:21] him? But we have the mind of Christ.
[0:24] Believe that for yourself. We have the
[0:27] mind of Christ. You can be
[0:31] seated. A few weeks ago, we we had a
[0:34] youth meeting uh and I think it was I
[0:36] can't remember if it was last month and
[0:38] when it or when it was and we talked
[0:39] about uh the final front line. It's not
[0:42] this past youth meeting, but the one
[0:44] before that and we were talking about
[0:45] the battle that rages in heaven and that
[0:47] how it came down to earth and it's
[0:49] continuing now. And it was born from
[0:52] this thought that I'd been studying
[0:54] along these lines of services that we
[0:56] began with the art of seduction. And
[0:58] today we're going to take this thought
[0:59] the final front line. Front line could
[1:02] be uh battle line or the the war zone.
[1:06] Those are the phrases that we might use.
[1:08] Uh it's an area where uh com opposing
[1:10] forces and enemies meet on a
[1:12] battlefield. And that's where you
[1:13] actually engage in combat. So you can
[1:16] have enemy forces anywhere, but where
[1:18] the war actually the interaction, the
[1:20] fighting takes place is called a front
[1:22] line. It's that line of military action
[1:25] where these forces are now uh combating
[1:28] one another. And as you look at the
[1:30] definitions of war zone and battle and
[1:32] combat, uh I'm not a war veteran. I'm
[1:35] not wasn't former military, so I only
[1:37] speak by what I read. Uh it should
[1:40] conjure up images of violence. And so
[1:44] it's not a peaceful area. It's not an
[1:46] area where you're negotiating. It's an
[1:48] area where you're trying to overthrow
[1:50] and essentially kill your enemy uh that
[1:52] you might win the battle or ultimately
[1:55] the war. So that's our idea. I want to
[1:57] conjure up this idea of really uh fierce
[2:00] conflict and fighting. Now in 1
[2:02] Corinthians chapter 2 verse 16, if you
[2:06] can look at this, this is where we
[2:08] started. And it says, "For who hath
[2:11] known the mind of the Lord that he may
[2:14] instruct him, but we have the mind of
[2:18] Christ." I'm going to draw heavily from
[2:20] the greatest battle ever fought and some
[2:22] of these things were laying out here in
[2:23] the beginning, but we know that the mind
[2:26] is then the front line that they that's
[2:29] where the battle is taking place. It's
[2:31] where the enemies meet to test powers
[2:33] and they meet to test strength. So the
[2:35] we have the mind of Christ and that's a
[2:38] spiritual mind that comes from God. But
[2:41] then we have this human mind. So
[2:43] believers have the mind of Christ, but
[2:44] then we have this human spirit and this
[2:46] human mind and that's where the front
[2:49] line is. But we could take from this
[2:51] scripture to recognize and realize that
[2:53] as believers, we have the ability to
[2:57] know the mind of God, to know the will
[3:00] of God, to know what he wants done with
[3:02] the word. That's that's that inheritance
[3:04] we have as believers. In 2 Peter 3:18,
[3:08] it says, "But grow in grace and in the
[3:10] knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[3:12] Christ. To him be glory both now and
[3:15] forever. Amen." We are to grow in the
[3:18] knowledge, the intelligence of Jesus
[3:21] Christ. Now, it's important to know that
[3:24] this growing in Christ and uh learning
[3:27] more of Christ and increasing in wisdom
[3:29] and those things that we could pull from
[3:30] the scripture is not an education of
[3:33] Christ or about Christ where we learn
[3:36] we're learning Christ in an academic
[3:38] sense or we're gathering information
[3:41] into the the battle in the mind or to
[3:43] that mind but rather it is a
[3:46] transformation of the mind into his.
[3:50] It's not an artificial conception. This
[3:52] isn't humanly contrived, but this is a
[3:54] work of God where we're going to grow in
[3:56] the knowledge of God and grow in God's
[3:59] intelligence. And this is not just
[4:02] learning things academically or in the
[4:05] mind, but rather it's a
[4:07] transformation. In Ephesians 4 7 to 20,
[4:11] I think that I hope that this will help
[4:14] us to understand this a little bit
[4:15] better. verses 17 to 20 it says this I
[4:18] say therefore and testify in the Lord
[4:21] that you henceforth walk not as other
[4:24] Gentiles walk. So there's a way in a
[4:26] manner that Gentiles will walk and the
[4:29] Bible says Paul says in the vanity of
[4:32] their mind the vanity of the human
[4:34] spirit human thinking. And so to walk
[4:37] it's the way they conduct themselves the
[4:38] way they compute the way that they uh
[4:41] gather information the way that they
[4:42] respond. And this is the description of
[4:45] their mind having the understanding
[4:49] darkened, being alienated from the life
[4:51] of God through the ignorance that is in
[4:53] them because of the blindness of their
[4:55] heart. Now that's that's already a
[4:57] really really good burn on those
[4:59] Gentiles. He's really, you know,
[5:01] drilling down. The Gentiles are vain.
[5:04] Their understanding is darkened. They're
[5:05] alienated from the life of God through
[5:06] the ignorance that is in them because of
[5:08] the blindness of their heart. And he
[5:10] hasn't stopped. who being past feeling
[5:12] have given themselves over into
[5:14] lasciviousness to work all uncleanness
[5:16] with
[5:17] greediness. Now, it's at this this point
[5:21] where there's a lot of things that have
[5:23] been in my heart that I've been studying
[5:24] and I did it especially for young people
[5:27] in that the day and age that they're
[5:28] living in and the things that they have
[5:30] to combat and the things that they're
[5:31] digesting and the things that they're
[5:33] interacting with. Those tools though
[5:35] they have the same spirits behind them
[5:37] and they may have been more rudimentary
[5:39] rudimentary forms in the past the things
[5:42] that they're having to face and the
[5:43] tools that they have to use are vastly
[5:46] advanced from what we were using. Uh you
[5:49] could even find historically that books
[5:52] were a bad thing to some people. I find
[5:54] even historically that there was
[5:56] commentary ages and ages ago of how
[5:59] people were walking around with these
[6:00] tablets. I can't remember if they were
[6:01] zinc or what they were, but they would
[6:03] write things down on them and they'd
[6:04] keep these notes and and so there's
[6:07] always been something that might be a
[6:09] technology or some tool that we think
[6:12] can make our lives easier that could
[6:14] also uh have a downside to them,
[6:16] unintended consequences, so to speak.
[6:20] And one thing that stands out to me in
[6:22] this verse, I guess this is just where I
[6:24] want to drop this in, is it says Hubid
[6:26] past feeling, but yet they think and
[6:28] they do things and they operate in
[6:30] certain ways and they they walk in the
[6:32] vanity of their mind to feed the flesh,
[6:34] to dress themselves, to close
[6:36] themselves. And where we've advanced
[6:39] today, where I think even I was wanting
[6:41] to kind of lead the young people to this
[6:43] a few weeks ago, is the final front
[6:45] line. One of the one of the things
[6:46] they're going to have to fight the most
[6:48] is artificial
[6:50] intelligence. And you might think, "Wow,
[6:52] oh, brother Aaron's found his soap box."
[6:54] No. Uh, not going to do that. But AI or
[6:58] these large language
[7:00] models mimic the human brain and they're
[7:04] even able with the uh the deep AI to
[7:06] where they're getting to the point to
[7:07] where that it's built as a neural
[7:09] network that's operating and trying to
[7:12] function just as a human brain. So what
[7:14] they do is they teach it at to learn
[7:18] language and then model or mimic that
[7:21] language so that the whatever it is
[7:23] you're using uh is going to mimic a
[7:28] conversation or produce things just as a
[7:30] person would be able to do it. Now I
[7:33] think Wednesday night I am going I'm
[7:35] just going to uh announce it right now.
[7:37] We'll print flyers. We'll do a blast on
[7:39] social media, brother loyal, if you can
[7:40] help me with that. And we're going to
[7:41] preach faith or cake, Lord willing,
[7:43] Wednesday night. But it's in this idea
[7:46] that things can be artificial and
[7:49] impersonated a and it's all fake. It's
[7:51] no, it's not real. Has no feeling. And
[7:55] what they're trying to do is they're
[7:56] trying to achieve uh um achieve AI to
[7:58] the point to where it can actually
[7:59] experience as humans do where it has its
[8:02] own they call it stream. But then it
[8:04] says of the human mind and of the human
[8:07] experience. It says but you have not so
[8:10] learned Christ. I want you to think
[8:13] about that that there is the vanity of
[8:16] the mind and the way that the mind works
[8:17] and how the information can be fed into
[8:20] the mind and we can we can learn but yet
[8:23] as I think we'll come to here in a
[8:25] moment ever learning but never knowing
[8:27] truth that we have not so learned
[8:30] Christ.
[8:33] I really want you to think about this,
[8:36] brother Benam in the sermon leadership
[8:37] says, "Look how it's become now just an
[8:40] intellectual emotion." There's a lot of
[8:43] things sometimes that are said where
[8:44] maybe there you hammer on emotion or
[8:46] then that you get hammered on intellect
[8:48] and these different sides to it. They're
[8:49] both the same thing.
[8:52] Uh you're you're just seen in a loop. If
[8:54] you're if you're you know calling out
[8:56] emotionalism, you're calling out
[8:58] intellectualism. They're both the same
[9:00] thing. So he says it's become
[9:01] intellectual emotion, not a tender heart
[9:05] full of love and sweetness towards
[9:08] Christ.
[9:10] I've noted it here that this is what le
[9:11] oysia has become intellectual, emotional
[9:15] and it doesn't have this heart full of
[9:17] love and sweetness towards Christ.
[9:18] That's real feeling. This is something
[9:20] real. Don't you want that kind of heart?
[9:24] How are you going to face Christ with an
[9:26] intellectual conception of him? Right?
[9:29] You have got to accept eternal life. So,
[9:32] we have not learned Christ by intellect
[9:34] or emotion. It's not because we feel
[9:36] good that we know Christ is real. It's
[9:38] not because we have learned or heard of
[9:40] him uh uh from our mom or from somebody
[9:42] else that we know that is real. But it's
[9:44] by transformational experience. Amen.
[9:46] According to the word of God, real
[9:49] genuine new birth experience, the the
[9:51] experience of continual revelation of
[9:53] himself. Amen.
[9:56] 1 Chronicles chapter 28 verse 9 says,
[10:00] "And thou Solomon, my son, know thou the
[10:03] God of thy father." Now
[10:06] notice uh uh the way that this
[10:08] experience is to be described or as I'm
[10:12] trying to amplify here, you have not so
[10:15] learned Christ. In other words, you
[10:16] haven't learned Christ in that manner.
[10:18] You've learned him
[10:21] differently. and serve him with a
[10:23] perfect heart and with a willing
[10:27] mind. This is a this is for us. We
[10:29] should serve with a perfect mind and a
[10:31] willing heart. A perfect heart and a
[10:34] willing mind. For the Lord searchth all
[10:37] hearts and understandeth all the
[10:39] imaginations of the thoughts. Isn't that
[10:40] interesting how that it speaks
[10:43] of the mind of God in conjunction with
[10:48] the mind that you ought to have towards
[10:50] him.
[10:51] So then it says, "If thou seek him, he
[10:54] will be found of thee, but if thou
[10:56] forsake him, he will cast thee off
[10:58] forever." So we are to seek
[11:01] him. That word seek means to study, to
[11:04] investigate, uh to
[11:07] inquire. It has kind of this meaning of
[11:09] to seek with a request. I I begin to
[11:12] think that the word that we might use
[11:14] today is Google him or googling. We're
[11:16] googling. So whenever we go to pray, we
[11:18] can say I'm just going to be googling.
[11:20] And I think that if if you can kind of
[11:23] catch where I'm going with this, this is
[11:25] a very heartfelt uh I wanted to say
[11:28] perfect uh and the way I was looking as
[11:31] the perfect mind and the willing heart
[11:33] and that you're going you want to have
[11:34] this desire. You're you're understanding
[11:36] it's in a completely different way. So
[11:38] you're not just seeking information, but
[11:40] you're wanting to investigate the heart
[11:42] of God. You want to understand him and
[11:45] you want to know as he understands the
[11:47] imaginations of your heart. As Paul
[11:48] said, I want to apprehend him as he has
[11:50] apprehended me that there's this desire
[11:53] to where you want to prompt God's mind.
[11:57] You you want to seek something from him.
[11:59] You want to go to the source of all
[12:00] knowledge and all intelligence.
[12:03] Paul said it in 1 Corinthians chapter
[12:05] 2:2, "For I determined not to know
[12:07] anything among you, save Jesus Christ
[12:10] and him crucified.
[12:13] This
[12:14] is uh Paul saying that I'm resolved to
[12:18] teach nothing but
[12:20] Christ. I want to wave all other
[12:22] knowledge. He's even in one place he
[12:23] said I count it all but dong and preach
[12:26] only
[12:28] Christ and if I if I use things Paul was
[12:31] very good at uh bringing in uh pop
[12:33] culture references at that time and
[12:35] using them as a way to stimulate
[12:36] people's thinking but he wasn't pointing
[12:38] to the pop culture reference. He was
[12:40] wanting to use things to focus their
[12:42] mind to and lift up only Christ.
[12:46] He says of Christ in Romans 11:33, "Oh,
[12:49] the depth of the riches, both of wisdom
[12:51] and knowledge of God. How unsearchable
[12:54] are his judgments and his ways past
[12:56] finding out." Now, I think we've run
[12:58] into a little bit of a paradox because
[13:00] we are asked to search him, seek him, to
[13:04] inquire of him, to investigate him, to
[13:07] want to know his heart and his mind. And
[13:09] Paul says, "I'm determined to know
[13:10] nothing but Jesus Christ." But then it
[13:13] says, "The depths of his riches and the
[13:15] wisdom and knowledge of God are
[13:19] unsearchable." This is before they had
[13:21] web crawlers. And this is this is a time
[13:24] it's unsearchable. There's so much
[13:25] knowledge in the world today and we have
[13:27] no way of tapping it. It's uncarchable
[13:29] and his judgments and his ways past
[13:30] finding out. Unarchable it means it
[13:33] literally means cannot be searched out.
[13:35] is the negative of to search out
[13:39] diligently. So there's it kind of throws
[13:42] up this uh barrier all of a sudden or a
[13:44] firewall that says you can't search
[13:46] that. You can't look for that. You don't
[13:48] have the permissions necessary. But yet
[13:51] we're told to seek him and inquire of
[13:53] him.
[13:56] 1 Corinthians chapter 2 9 and
[14:00] 10. This is where I believe that it's uh
[14:06] will maybe quicken something here to see
[14:12] this 1 Corinthians chapter 2:es 9 and
[14:15] 10. that as it is written, I hath not
[14:17] seen nor ear heard, neither have entered
[14:20] into the heart of man the things which
[14:22] God hath prepared for them that love
[14:24] him. As we read all of 1 Corinthians
[14:26] chapter 2, I believe on Wednesday night,
[14:29] this tells us that in the mind, human
[14:31] mind, it cannot apprehend God. It's an
[14:33] enemy of God. It cannot go know God. And
[14:36] so I ear and heart have are not able to
[14:43] connect with or know the things of God.
[14:46] Verse 10. But so if we are in our human
[14:50] minds, eye, ear, and heart of the man
[14:53] are unable to inquire of God. His ways
[14:55] are past finding out. We can't reach out
[14:57] and get into the mind of God through
[14:59] those things. But God hath revealed them
[15:02] unto us by his spirit. For the spirit
[15:05] searchth all things, yay, the deep
[15:08] things of God.
[15:10] This is this is what the holy the nature
[15:13] of the Holy Spirit is to inquire of God
[15:16] is to look into the heart of God and the
[15:18] mind of God. For the spirit searches all
[15:21] things, yay, the deep things of God. How
[15:23] is it then that we are to seek after
[15:25] him? How is it that we're trying to gain
[15:26] access to his mind a and to his heart?
[15:29] It's not through the human mind, but
[15:31] it's through the mind of Christ that is
[15:32] inside of us that we're being implored
[15:35] to dig deeper into his heart to tap into
[15:37] that real heart of flesh.
[15:41] It's the deep in you seeking the deep.
[15:44] I've been amazed and just taking note of
[15:46] how many AI models or research groups or
[15:49] brands are connected with deep and even
[15:53] the pro the principle itself is deep is
[15:56] what they're calling it. It's a deep AI,
[15:59] deep seek, deep
[16:03] mind because there's this pattern in
[16:05] scripture that the spirit of God
[16:07] searches
[16:09] deeply. 1 Corinthians chapter 1 verse 5,
[16:13] that in everything you are enriched by
[16:14] him in all utterance and in all
[16:16] knowledge, richly furnished by Christ in
[16:19] the mind of Christ. That's what
[16:20] utterance is. That log go in the mind of
[16:23] Christ and his in all knowledge, his
[16:24] intelligence.
[16:26] I don't want to just know of him. I
[16:28] don't even I'm not just interested in uh
[16:31] uh knowing about his works. I want to
[16:33] know his heart. I I want to know why he
[16:36] does the things he does. I want to know
[16:37] what it is he's trying to accomplish.
[16:40] To have the mind of Christ to know what
[16:42] he wants done with the word goes beyond
[16:44] just having the mind of Christ to know
[16:46] what the word says, but know what he's
[16:48] trying to achieve by it.
[16:50] This is a vastly different intelligence.
[16:53] In Romans chapter 15:14, "And I myself
[16:56] also am persuaded of you, my brethren,
[16:58] that ye also are full of goodness,
[17:01] filled with all knowledge, able also to
[17:03] admonish one another." That being filled
[17:06] with goodness and filled with his
[17:08] knowledges and intelligence, it puts us
[17:09] in a place to where we can admonish one
[17:12] another. We are not solely existing
[17:14] within our human mind having this human
[17:16] experience. But since we have the mind
[17:18] of Christ, then we are spiritual and we
[17:20] can judge and we can instruct and we can
[17:23] admonish one another.
[17:25] I believe Ephesians chapter 3 17 to 19
[17:29] touch on it this way that Christ may
[17:30] dwell in your hearts by faith being
[17:33] rooted and grounded in love. This is
[17:35] this growth, this development, this
[17:37] maturing as he gets into in chapter four
[17:39] that we may be able to comprehend. This
[17:41] is conceive. No, with all saints, what
[17:44] is the breadth and the length and the
[17:46] depth and height? There it is. That's
[17:49] that uh you're not just playing 3D
[17:50] chess. You're playing 4D chess chess.
[17:53] You're this is this is the full uh the
[17:55] full thing. You want to have the the
[17:57] breadth, the length, the depth, and the
[17:58] height. This is everything in context
[18:01] and the proper scale and to know the
[18:04] love of Christ which passes knowledge.
[18:07] When he tells us that we're to seek him
[18:09] and to know him and that we're to be
[18:10] filled with all knowledge, the knowledge
[18:13] here he's talking about again is that
[18:14] human wisdom, the human understanding
[18:16] that ye might be filled with all the
[18:18] fullness of God.
[18:21] Seems to be sometimes maybe
[18:22] contradictory claims where I believe
[18:24] that you are full of goodness and filled
[18:26] with all knowledge, able to admonish one
[18:28] another. And yet there's this working
[18:30] out of that knowledge that passes human
[18:32] knowledge that we might be filled with
[18:33] all the fullness of God. What is in you
[18:36] by DNA? what is in you by code, what is
[18:38] in you by the mind of Christ and the
[18:40] grace of God that is in you through the
[18:42] new birth. There is this maturing and
[18:44] working out of those things. It's the
[18:46] maturing of the life of God and the body
[18:48] of Christ. It's the maturing of the life
[18:50] of God in the individual. Ephesians 4
[18:52] will tell us that we're to grow up into
[18:54] him into all things.
[18:57] God is wanting to produce mature
[18:59] believers, steadfast, solid. Amen. And
[19:03] we have to look at it in the context of
[19:05] the day and age that we're living in. So
[19:06] this might be a little bit of a pivot
[19:08] now. A little bit of a turn. God is
[19:10] doing those things in order to fulfill
[19:12] his purpose, his overarching purpose,
[19:15] his specific purpose in this hour and
[19:17] his purpose in you individually. It's
[19:20] the purpose of
[19:21] defeating the enemy. And in this age,
[19:24] it's defeating death.
[19:26] The last enemy which is in
[19:28] death, which is death. Ephesians chapter
[19:31] 6 verse 13. Wherefore take unto you the
[19:34] whole armor of God. This is that warfare
[19:38] context. That you may be able to
[19:39] withstand in the evil day. That means
[19:42] oppose
[19:43] fight. And having done all to stand.
[19:47] That means hold your ground.
[19:50] That we are to put on the whole armor of
[19:53] God. You can find the description of
[19:54] these things in Ephesians chapter 6.
[19:57] that with these things and these
[19:59] elements and tools of warfare which we
[20:01] know are not carnal but mighty through
[20:03] God, we are to oppose and to fight evil
[20:07] in the evil day, unbelief in the evil
[20:09] day, the day that we're now living, the
[20:11] most evil of all days. And having done
[20:13] all, we are to stand and to stand
[20:17] therefore prepared, ready to fight.
[20:20] Amen.
[20:22] God has given us the mind of Christ or
[20:24] the mind of Christ is so that we can
[20:27] understand his will to know his will and
[20:30] to accomplish
[20:32] it. As we were identifying Wednesday
[20:35] night that true intelligence is this
[20:37] prudence, this reasonleness, this the
[20:39] right thing in a given situation where
[20:42] when somebody does something and you go,
[20:43] "Well, that wasn't very smart." And if
[20:46] somebody did something and it worked,
[20:47] you say, "That was smart." What are you
[20:48] referring to? the ability in the moment
[20:51] to process the information that's being
[20:53] given to them and make a decision based
[20:55] upon what they're seeing that addresses
[20:58] what's happening. And when it's
[21:00] addressed appropriately, like that's
[21:01] that's that is intelligent.
[21:04] It's not a a blind squirrel just
[21:05] accidentally finding a nut even though
[21:07] he was trying to find one and he
[21:09] stumbles on it. But using this
[21:11] intelligence to accomplish the right
[21:13] response or the objective, right?
[21:16] As the Bible says that God's word will
[21:18] accomplish the thing wherein to it sent
[21:20] it as the rain falls and brings forth in
[21:23] this process the seed so that it can be
[21:24] used for meat and used for bread. The
[21:27] same with God's word. That's an
[21:29] intelligence. Brother Brandham was
[21:30] saying, in nature,
[21:33] and we're given this intelligence to
[21:35] fight,
[21:37] to war, a good
[21:39] warfare. In the sermon, the greatest
[21:41] battle ever fought, it says, so an army
[21:43] first is getting ready for battle.
[21:46] First, there's got to be a select some
[21:48] soldiers. So, if you're going to go to
[21:49] battle, you got to there's could be a
[21:51] draft, it could be a voluntary
[21:53] enrollment, but you need soldiers.
[21:56] You got to select
[21:57] soldiers. He says, "Then they've got to
[22:00] be dressed for
[22:02] fighting. They've got to be trained for
[22:05] fighting." I believe that the greatest
[22:08] battle that was ever fought is now ready
[22:09] to go in
[22:11] action. Now, let's just pause for a
[22:13] moment. You've got to be dressed and
[22:16] then you got to be trained for what?
[22:18] Fighting.
[22:20] We're not going to ComicCon,
[22:23] right? and and we want our social media
[22:25] page to look real good. We're going to
[22:27] war.
[22:29] Listen, these these outfits and this
[22:31] cosplay you see may look good, but
[22:35] completely nonfunctional, right? Right
[22:38] there. There's no I wish I knew the
[22:40] names of these people, but there's no
[22:42] real there's no Spider-Man cosplay
[22:45] that's going to be able to actually
[22:46] produce spiderw webs like real actual
[22:49] spiderw webs. and I I'm going to get
[22:52] somebody's going to forward me a tweet
[22:53] this afternoon and somebody's done it.
[22:55] I'm like, well, you know, okay, I'm
[22:56] wrong. Just say I'm wrong and say, see
[22:58] what the devil can do just like that. He
[23:01] knew I was going to say
[23:03] that. But it's all that's not real. But
[23:06] there this outfit of the believer is for
[23:08] very real conflict. Called it outfit,
[23:11] your your war gear. And then he says,
[23:14] this is key to catch. And I believe that
[23:16] the greatest battle that ever was fought
[23:17] is now ready to go in action. There's
[23:20] always been a battle that's raged.
[23:22] There's always been warfare. But now
[23:24] he's kind of put it in in the terms that
[23:26] there's going to be this greatest battle
[23:28] ever fought. And it's it hasn't been
[23:30] fought yet. So the war is building to
[23:33] this climax, to the greatest battle.
[23:35] Yes, there's always been a war, but now
[23:37] the greatest battle, this highest point
[23:39] of conflict, this high watermark, so to
[23:42] speak. I believe that God has been
[23:43] selecting his soldiers. I believe he's
[23:46] been dressing them, training them, and
[23:48] the battlefront is now set, getting
[23:51] ready to start.
[23:53] As he says this in 1962, he brings it to
[23:57] a point to where he's not saying
[23:58] nobody's fought before. He's not saying
[24:00] there's not a war that's raging, but
[24:01] there's coming some ultimate conflict
[24:04] that God has been dressing the believer
[24:06] for. He's been training them for. He
[24:08] says the battle front is now set. the
[24:11] the the they're they're now gathering on
[24:13] the front line. The forces are gathering
[24:16] on the front line and the war is getting
[24:18] ready to be triggered.
[24:20] So, think then of this final front
[24:22] line and why are we
[24:25] fighting? What are what are we what are
[24:28] we engaged in this conflict for? I
[24:31] imagine that if you look at most
[24:33] arguments within families and probably
[24:35] with anybody that the very thing that
[24:38] initiated the discussion is not what's
[24:40] being fought over anymore.
[24:42] And then when it comes time to try to
[24:44] really address the issue, you got to
[24:46] address the way that you tried to uh
[24:49] confront it. So we're never going to
[24:51] never going to fix the problem because
[24:52] the way that we try to fix the problem
[24:54] and you're always trying to fix the way
[24:56] that you try to fix the problem and the
[24:57] problem just stays unfixed.
[25:01] So you want to you want to know what are
[25:02] we what is this fight
[25:05] for? I witnessed some something recently
[25:08] in uh in the context of where someone
[25:11] was
[25:12] retained to make a very specific request
[25:16] or to accomplish a very specific
[25:18] objective. And when the
[25:21] overtures were were
[25:23] offered, they were uh kind of just
[25:26] disregarded and it delved into a debate
[25:29] and and an argument and a lot of
[25:31] conflict over everything else but the
[25:33] request.
[25:35] And it's the tactic of the enemy to do
[25:37] that when you are when even if you
[25:40] understand your objective and you know
[25:42] what you're fighting for, there's always
[25:43] going to be some sort of faint or some
[25:45] movement or some action to try to get
[25:47] you off your objective and to get you
[25:50] fighting all these other things and say,
[25:51] "Well, hold on. Wait a minute. It
[25:53] doesn't matter what interest I represent
[25:55] and why." Or it doesn't matter. This is
[25:57] the very specific thing. This is what's
[25:59] going we want to accomplish. This is
[26:01] what you're being asked to provide or
[26:02] asked to do. All this other stuff is
[26:04] immaterial.
[26:07] And I believe it's the devil sometimes
[26:09] that tries to broaden our view of
[26:10] certain things and put it in the view
[26:11] when God's wanting us to be very
[26:13] focused. The final front line is where
[26:16] we're coming to. It's where we
[26:18] are. I hope that this doesn't seem out
[26:21] of place, but I believe it's important
[26:22] to emphasize these things even to do so
[26:25] on a regular basis. When I say out of
[26:27] place, just maybe in the continuity of
[26:28] this sermon, but in Revelations 10:7,
[26:32] after this book which is now opened is
[26:35] coming back down to earth and the seven
[26:37] thunders have uttered their voices and
[26:39] John being about to write, he says,
[26:41] "Don't write it. It's going to be sealed
[26:43] up." But in the days of the voice of the
[26:46] seventh angel, when he shall begin to
[26:48] sound, I hath not seen nor ear heard,
[26:50] neither has entered into the heart of
[26:51] men the things which God prepared for
[26:52] them that love him. But God has revealed
[26:55] them to us by his spirit. It's a pattern
[26:57] of a mystery that is sealed up and that
[26:59] God will reveal that divine mystery. He
[27:02] will make it known. He will share it.
[27:04] And here it says the mystery of God
[27:05] should be finished as he has declared to
[27:07] his servants the
[27:08] prophets. We understand according to the
[27:11] word of God that a mystery revealed is a
[27:13] declaration of war.
[27:16] And here when we see the mystery of God
[27:19] is going to be finished. This mystery
[27:21] being revealed is it's a declaration of
[27:23] war. It's this it is a climaxing the
[27:27] greatest battle ever fought. There's
[27:30] some kind of become comes some finality.
[27:33] Think of it this way that in the fall in
[27:35] the beginning through unbelief which is
[27:38] sin entered and it caused death. And so
[27:41] what we have experienced through this
[27:43] the stream of humanity for these
[27:46] thousands of years is man's struggle
[27:48] with sin and death. But there's going to
[27:51] become the ultimate triumph over death.
[27:55] Sin having been vanquished through the
[27:56] work of Jesus Christ on the cross. There
[27:58] comes this ultimate triumph over death.
[28:01] And so this war that is raged in
[28:04] humanity and if you want to say from the
[28:06] Garden of Eden, it was it's going to be
[28:08] the results of that initial move by
[28:10] Satan is going to be overturned because
[28:12] unbelief is destroyed. And ultimately
[28:14] our revelation of that is going to
[28:16] accomplish our victory over death.
[28:20] So with this mystery being revealed,
[28:22] it's a declaration of war. In 1
[28:24] Corinthians chapter 14:8, it's a very
[28:27] broad p principle. We just want to share
[28:29] it with you here. He says, "For if the
[28:30] trumpet give an uncertain sound, who
[28:32] shall prepare himself for battle?"
[28:36] If the trumpet give an uncertain
[28:39] sound, who shall prepare himself to
[28:42] fight, to war? Who's going to know how
[28:44] to dress and who's being properly
[28:46] trained? How you going to know how to
[28:48] respond? Right. So in war, if the the
[28:52] signal that's being given is un is in
[28:54] disccernible, if you can't figure it
[28:57] out, if it if you're if you're if it's
[29:00] supposed to be dan dan dan but a field
[29:02] but a field but a field and you're
[29:03] hearing something else, guess what?
[29:05] You're not going to know what to do. Is
[29:06] that revelation? Should I go to bed?
[29:08] Should I wake up? What should I do?
[29:11] But the certain sound is the word of God
[29:12] giving us the battle plans. Amen. The
[29:15] certain sound that trumpet of God that
[29:17] that that's what's giving us what we
[29:19] need to know. If I could put it in the
[29:21] context of we being filled with the Holy
[29:23] Spirit as we have now we want the mind
[29:25] of Christ to be in us. Amen. This
[29:27] transformation by the renewing of our
[29:28] minds in the sermon power of
[29:30] transformation. Brother Bram says we are
[29:32] now ready for a battle. And he says this
[29:34] at the
[29:35] outset of preaching a sermon. I look no
[29:39] listen to how I say this. I have it um
[29:41] kind of summarized here. But as he's
[29:43] getting ready to preach the word, he
[29:45] says, "We are now ready for a battle.
[29:46] The trumpet is to sound." So through the
[29:49] preaching of the word, it's the sounding
[29:51] of a trumpet. And as that trumpet
[29:52] sounding, you know, there's a war on and
[29:54] now there's a move that needs to take
[29:55] place. So think even in this sense that
[29:58] yes there's things that are uh relevant
[30:00] as far as a trumpet to an age or even
[30:02] trumpets that uh uh speak of mysteries
[30:05] and things take transpiring but even now
[30:08] the word of God signaling to us what we
[30:10] ought to do and what we ought to know
[30:12] and how we ought to live and to act. And
[30:13] so he says now we're ready for warfare.
[30:15] The trumpet is to sound. And I love
[30:17] this. He says the hymns have been sung.
[30:20] Now comes the word.
[30:22] Singing and hymns and all that should
[30:24] never have the preeminence. One thing
[30:26] that this is maybe just me personally,
[30:28] maybe I've just got my feelings hurt
[30:30] when I've preached camps and I've
[30:32] preached maybe eight
[30:33] services in three days and Saturday
[30:36] night is the
[30:37] skit, right? And then and when it's all
[30:40] said and done, and maybe this just
[30:41] speaks to my ability to really mess up a
[30:43] youth meeting, but afterwards, that's
[30:45] what everyone's testifying about. You're
[30:46] like, well, you know, I was the side I
[30:49] opened. I opened for the youth group.
[30:53] It was just doing a bit just working
[30:55] some material for a while. But this
[30:58] after the singing he says now comes the
[31:01] word.
[31:03] So I would I would uh express that yes
[31:06] the singing the worship prepares our
[31:08] hearts and our minds. It's a way that we
[31:11] even will use to cleanse our wash our
[31:14] minds and get ourselves in into the
[31:16] frame of mind to what? Hear the trumpet
[31:18] sound to hear the word of God. It has
[31:20] its place.
[31:24] But those things are it's
[31:26] preparation. Pre- battle. The word is
[31:28] where the war takes place, where the
[31:30] fighting takes place.
[31:32] The singing and the worship and the
[31:33] hymns, they have their place. It's part
[31:35] of the part of our preparation. But the
[31:38] sword in my hand is not used to play a
[31:40] violin.
[31:43] Revelations 10:es 8-11. Now is the
[31:46] mystery of God's been finished. And the
[31:47] voice which I heard from heaven spake
[31:49] unto me again and said, "Go and take the
[31:51] little book which is open in the hand of
[31:52] the angel which standeth upon the sea
[31:54] and upon the earth." I know these are so
[31:55] familiar with you. And under the angel
[31:58] and I went unto the angel and said to
[32:00] him, "Give me the little book." He's
[32:02] doing what he was told according to the
[32:04] message. The voice from heaven said, "Go
[32:06] and ask for the book." And when he comes
[32:09] to the angel who has the book and he
[32:11] asks for it, notice he reveals things to
[32:14] him by his spirit. John at one time
[32:15] couldn't read. I have not seen nor heard
[32:18] it into the heart of the man the things
[32:19] which God has prepared for them that
[32:20] love him. But when that book was open,
[32:23] he could look into it. And now he's
[32:25] looking into it. Now he's told to go and
[32:27] take it. And now watch how the
[32:28] revelation just continues to unfold.
[32:30] More light. Take it and eat it up. So
[32:34] now this is a a a greater
[32:37] process of not of conceiving the word of
[32:41] God. Take it and eat it up and it shall
[32:43] make thy belly bitter but it shall be in
[32:46] thy mouth sweet as
[32:48] honey. He is to eat the book and in
[32:52] processing it there sweet in his mouth
[32:54] but bitter in his belly. The the phrase
[32:57] that's used there of a bitter belly is
[32:59] it will pierce the womb of the mind.
[33:02] A bitter belly is and where I'm drawing
[33:04] that from is the fact that belly in the
[33:07] Bible is even translated to womb. And
[33:09] the and just as one would uh take in
[33:12] nutrients and then this digestive
[33:14] process will take out of it nutrients
[33:17] and energy and life to feed the body and
[33:19] sustain the body and there's this uh
[33:21] reception of food and this processing of
[33:23] it to give the body its energy. Here it
[33:27] says that it will be the make your belly
[33:29] bitter. It will pierce your belly. Amen.
[33:33] It's this piercing of the womb of the
[33:37] mind as the Bible says that he will
[33:39] prophesy again. He says, "I ate it. It
[33:42] was sweet in my mouth and it pierced my
[33:44] belly." But he says with this piercing
[33:47] now you can prophesy again. The final
[33:51] front line is eating the
[33:53] book and processing this process of
[33:56] conceiving the word of God.
[33:59] Now in the
[34:01] beginning the fall is through
[34:04] eating conceiving. In the end the
[34:07] victory is through the
[34:11] same. The opening of the
[34:13] word was for a
[34:16] reason. The sermon things that are to
[34:18] be. Brother Brandham was talking about
[34:19] what heaven was like and what people
[34:20] experiences heaven and floating on
[34:22] clouds with harps and those things. He
[34:24] says, "But that was a conception they
[34:26] had before the fullness of the word come
[34:28] into existence." An idea, a thought.
[34:30] Where did it reside? In the mind. But
[34:33] then at the open of the seals, he says,
[34:36] before the word come into existence, the
[34:37] opening of the seals that's promised to
[34:39] us in this age that we then
[34:41] understand what's happened in your mind,
[34:44] you had a conception. But once the word
[34:46] opened up, you conceived the right
[34:48] thought. There's this idea I had in my
[34:51] mind about the resurrection. There's
[34:52] this idea I had in my mind about heaven,
[34:54] about the rapture. But when the word is
[34:56] opened up, I now receive the true seed.
[34:59] And and it's not so much intellectually,
[35:01] but as I open those channels up, it
[35:03] pierces me into my soul. And then I
[35:06] understand it opens up our
[35:07] understanding. The opening of the word
[35:09] was to produce a a a quickening power to
[35:13] change our thinking to bypass human
[35:16] reasoning, human conceptions,
[35:18] intellectual conceptions, emotional
[35:20] conceptions, and and and rightly divide
[35:22] the word of God to quicken power within
[35:25] ourselves.
[35:27] The time that we're living in today, as
[35:29] we can see this in just a few statements
[35:31] here from the sermon, Christ is revealed
[35:33] in his own word. He's and he's he's
[35:36] going through the process of church ages
[35:39] a and the development of the body and
[35:41] just using it as a type of where we are
[35:43] today. And now the next is himself to
[35:48] come. We know that the baptism of the
[35:51] Holy Ghost makes way for the Holy Ghost
[35:53] himself. He says it's seen prophetic. So
[35:56] now he's in this different uh realm. He
[35:58] says down through the age we started
[36:00] from the foundation from the first
[36:01] church when the seed went into the
[36:02] ground the complete seed. Then it come
[36:04] out through the feet Luther back out
[36:06] then in through Wesley then into the
[36:08] Pentecostals the tongues in the lips.
[36:11] Now it's in the eyes prophetic of
[36:13] Malachi and so forth and and it's just
[36:16] using the human body and as things work
[36:18] up and he says you have the lips which
[36:21] is Pentecost it's le oysia but then you
[36:23] have a prophet that comes in le oysia
[36:25] and he becomes the keystone in the
[36:28] blending of dispensations or ages and
[36:30] it's in the eyes prophetic he says and
[36:32] now there's nothing else left and what a
[36:35] lot of people want to do is say glory
[36:37] put a period on it stop the tape he says
[36:40] nothing else left for it to come but him
[36:44] himself to step into that because that's
[36:48] the last thing there is
[36:50] the next is the intelligence
[36:54] and we have no intelligence of our own
[36:56] it's his we have no sight of our own so
[36:59] the time that we're in at this this age
[37:03] this climax and this greatest battle
[37:04] ever fought is that we're not to use
[37:08] weapons in this warfare that are carnal
[37:11] or not fully developed and ready, but he
[37:14] we have to have intelligence.
[37:17] I know it's a an oxymoron in the
[37:22] military to have military
[37:24] intelligence is what they say is that
[37:26] military intelligence is an oxymoron.
[37:30] in light of God's
[37:31] intelligence that we are to brother
[37:34] talks about spies and how they try to
[37:35] counteract their enemy and so they have
[37:37] spies who get this intelligence and they
[37:39] get the intel and they go in and they
[37:41] find out oh this is what they're using
[37:43] then I want to build something to
[37:44] counteract that and warfare is knowing
[37:46] your enemy and warfare is knowing what
[37:48] they're able to accomplish and what
[37:50] they're able to do so he says for us the
[37:52] next is the intelligence that's the time
[37:55] we're living in now God's given us the
[37:57] intelligence himself
[37:59] Think of what an incredible evolution to
[38:01] this point. He says it again this way in
[38:03] the same sermon. You can't see with the
[38:05] lips though it speaks. That was the
[38:07] Pentecostal age. Notice the advancement
[38:09] of the life out of Leoa. But now it's in
[38:12] the eye time seeing. There isn't one
[38:14] faculty beyond the eye. Is that right?
[38:18] The next is the intelligence.
[38:20] Amen. You're talking about the sense.
[38:22] And you say there's nothing that moves
[38:23] or has a sense beyond the eye. You go,
[38:25] but what about my eyebrows? I can convey
[38:28] information using my eyebrows but we
[38:30] understand what he means here. The next
[38:32] is the intelligence he says which is
[38:35] Christ who controls the whole body.
[38:39] That's right. The intelligence that had
[38:41] come. The intelligence is Christ
[38:43] himself.
[38:47] In Philippians it says let this mind be
[38:49] in you which was also in
[38:52] Christ. Very specifically he's referring
[38:54] to their a particular way of seeing
[38:56] yourself and understand your
[38:58] relationship to God. But let's look at
[39:00] it in the sense that the sense that you
[39:02] have the mind of Christ. You are filled
[39:04] with goodness and full of the knowledge
[39:06] of God. So let it be in you. Let it
[39:08] exist. Let it come into being in you. In
[39:12] my flesh, I shall see God. Let him stand
[39:16] upon the earth and my two feet. Let my
[39:18] eyes be his eyes. Since these two eyes
[39:21] are useless in seeing God, let me yield
[39:23] my whole being to God so that these eyes
[39:25] can be his eyes. Amen.
[39:28] Let this mind be in you. In the sermon
[39:30] identification, brother V says, "Let the
[39:31] mind of Christ come into us." The Bible
[39:34] said, "Let the mind that was in Christ
[39:36] be in you." He says, "That changes our
[39:38] character." Isn't that beautiful? It's
[39:41] We say, "Wow, suffering changes our
[39:43] character." How many of us know people
[39:45] who've really, really suffered and
[39:47] they're still the same knuckleheads?
[39:50] My goodness, what are you going to have
[39:51] to go through in life to learn anything?
[39:53] So, it's not just suffering.
[39:56] that perfects our character. There has
[39:58] to be some quality that can be
[40:00] perfected.
[40:02] There's a lot of lumps of coal that go
[40:04] through the process, a lot of elements,
[40:05] a lot of dirt, a lot of things that can
[40:07] get pressurized, but they never turn
[40:09] into diamonds.
[40:11] And you have just the right kind. When
[40:13] you have this mind of Christ, if you'll
[40:14] let it be in you, then that's what can
[40:16] form and forge the right kind of
[40:18] character. It's the intelligence. It's
[40:20] the grace of God. Amen. Do you realize
[40:23] some of us lived our lives and we
[40:24] suffered and we were abused as children?
[40:27] We were uh rebellious as teenagers. We
[40:29] went full on in the world and lived
[40:31] lifestyles as adult young adults and we
[40:33] suffered and we suffered and we suffered
[40:35] and we suffered and we experienced all
[40:37] sorts of things and it was suffered and
[40:38] suffering and our our character and our
[40:40] integrity and our honesty and our
[40:42] decency never changed.
[40:45] Never changed. And then you get born
[40:46] again
[40:48] and very quickly you start maturing. and
[40:50] you start growing and then the suffering
[40:52] is translated into character. I can
[40:56] testify it can take a long
[40:57] time. I'm I'm almost in my 40s
[41:03] now. Seriously, why'd you guys laugh? I
[41:07] am I'm almost in my
[41:10] 40s,
[41:13] right? I'm I mean, I'm 50. You're almost
[41:17] almost in my 40s. I know it's taken me
[41:20] this long to really start healing,
[41:24] maturing.
[41:26] I'm I'm just testifying for other
[41:28] knuckleheads
[41:30] that you that it's in you. Let it be in
[41:33] you. Let it grow in you. It changes our
[41:36] character.
[41:39] The word opens to bring Christ the
[41:43] intelligence. And if I could say this,
[41:46] not that he was never in in the
[41:49] believer, not that the mind of Christ
[41:51] wasn't available, but this is a specific
[41:53] moment. It brings Christ to the front
[41:55] line.
[41:57] To engage Satan in the battle, not just
[42:00] in the mind, but for the mind.
[42:05] Satan has always fought this. He's
[42:07] always fought this word. The parables of
[42:09] the sewer, we see that Christ, the son
[42:11] of man, goes and he sws seed. that seed
[42:14] being sown, the wicked one's right there
[42:15] to sew his other seed behind it. That
[42:17] when the word goes forth, there's always
[42:19] the enemy right there trying real quick
[42:21] to catch it. Matthew chapter 13 verse
[42:23] 19, when anyone hearth the word of the
[42:25] kingdom, I'm just using this now as a uh
[42:28] an overview of how Satan works. When he
[42:32] hears the word of the kingdom and
[42:33] understandeth it not, notice how
[42:35] critical this understanding is. Then
[42:36] cometh the wicked one, and catcheth away
[42:39] that which was sown in his heart. This
[42:41] is he which receives seed by the
[42:43] wayside.
[42:45] Verse take from this. Satan is always
[42:47] opposing the word. That's the mark of
[42:50] the antichrist. It's anti-word. It's
[42:53] against the word by any means necessary
[42:55] to devalue, make ineffective, obscure,
[42:59] lie about the word, change the word. And
[43:02] when anyone hears the word and they do
[43:05] not it's
[43:06] not grasped or apprehended by the soul
[43:09] by the spirit which is in them then
[43:12] anything that remains as intellectual or
[43:14] emotional faith is subject to theft.
[43:20] Anything that is uh it's the lie of
[43:22] emotional faith. It's the failure of
[43:24] intellectual faith that can be
[43:26] manipulated.
[43:28] This is what they're finding out with
[43:29] these large language models. They can be
[43:31] manipulated
[43:32] and hallucinate.
[43:37] We didn't have have to look any further
[43:38] than organized religion to know that if
[43:41] you feed upon enough information and
[43:44] you're limited by human language, you're
[43:46] going to start hallucinating.
[43:48] Man, did not we have the most awesome
[43:50] anointing? All three of the godhead were
[43:52] in there. Hallucinations.
[43:58] Actsap
[44:01] 7:51. I know he's speaking to people.
[44:04] You stiff necked and uncircumcised in
[44:06] heart and
[44:07] ears. You do always resist the Holy
[44:10] Ghost as your fathers did. So do ye
[44:13] resist to advance, to oppose, to strive
[44:15] against. You war against the Holy Ghost.
[44:18] You fight against the Holy Ghost. Why?
[44:20] Because they're stiff necked,
[44:22] uncircumcised in their hearts, not being
[44:24] born again. The only tool they have is
[44:27] their mind and what it hallucinates.
[44:30] Their mind and what it imagines, their
[44:31] mind and what it feels and its in
[44:35] instinct if whether it be intellectual
[44:38] or manifest intellectually or
[44:40] emotionally, its instinct is to fight
[44:42] the word of God. So no matter how much
[44:45] it sounds right and it feels good if
[44:48] it's only the mind, it's used and it's
[44:52] susceptible to fighting and resisting
[44:54] the true word of God.
[44:56] 2 Timothy 3:7 says it this way. Ever
[44:59] learning and never able to come to the
[45:02] knowledge of the truth.
[45:05] Sitting on the outside
[45:07] observing things the creation's true.
[45:13] There's realities. True. There's things
[45:16] that we could say are real, but these
[45:18] people just exist in learning and
[45:21] gathering information, but they never
[45:22] know it in reality. They never know
[45:24] truth. That's so the knowledge of the
[45:26] truth. That's Alaththenos. It's
[45:28] reality. I want to quote brother Bobby
[45:31] Bobby Frost. Robert Frost is probably
[45:33] how you know him. But I think I have
[45:36] that right. I had to put Robert Frost on
[45:38] there so that you didn't try to go find
[45:39] the sermon the secret sits. Like, is
[45:42] this one of the new ones they've
[45:43] uncovered? Someone generated it using AI
[45:45] and it sounds just like Brother Brown.
[45:48] This is a This is the entire
[45:50] poem. The secret sits. We danced around
[45:53] in a ring and suppose, but the secret
[45:56] sits in the middle and
[45:58] knows. Capitalizes the secret. We dance
[46:02] around in a ring and
[46:04] suppose, but the secret, the mind of
[46:07] God, the heart of God sits in the middle
[46:09] and knows.
[46:11] If we don't have the Holy Ghost, if it's
[46:13] intellectual, emotional, we are si
[46:15] dancing,
[46:16] dancing around in a ring, and supposing,
[46:20] but it's in the mind of Christ in the
[46:22] heart of God that we know. Amen. We sit
[46:26] in the middle and know. We're not just
[46:28] observing reality. We're partaking in
[46:30] it. Right?
[46:32] Brother Brandham says in the sermon
[46:34] leadership, this is so you could see
[46:35] that Satan's always opposing the word,
[46:37] ever learning but never able to come to
[46:39] the knowledge of truth. Brother Brandham
[46:42] says, 'Oh God, please Lord, catch this
[46:44] day that we're living. Notice the time
[46:46] and the moment that we're living in. So
[46:48] he's describing Leo to see. Oh, it's so
[46:50] hard, Father. Satan has just done so
[46:53] much to the people. Their hearts have
[46:55] become stony. The hardness of our heart
[46:58] is because of the abuses, the lies, the
[47:00] the toxicity, the all these different
[47:02] things that we might want to use modern
[47:04] buzzwords for, but religion and Satan's
[47:06] lies and fanaticism and intellectualism
[47:08] and emotionalism have hardened our
[47:10] hearts. Your spirit speaks right out.
[47:13] Your word comes forward, vindicate. But
[47:15] the oldfashioned born again experience,
[47:17] he says it's become into a
[47:20] denominational intellectual conception.
[47:23] And people say, "Praise God. Hallelujah.
[47:25] Stop the tape. Yeah. He says, "A lot of
[47:28] music, a lot of shout, a lot of carrying
[47:31] on,
[47:33] glory. I want to shout and carry on."
[47:36] But, uh, I don't want to be guilty of an
[47:38] intellectual conception. Do you realize
[47:41] that intellectual conception makes you
[47:43] shout and dance and run around and a lot
[47:45] of carrying on, right? There has to be
[47:47] some there's some process that triggers
[47:49] that something that's working uh uh in
[47:52] the in the within the system of the
[47:53] human body, the human spirit and the
[47:55] human mind that produces those things.
[47:58] Right? When we looked it into the word
[48:00] of God, we found oh those things are
[48:01] human nature.
[48:03] It's a h a human response even to
[48:05] stimulus. So it's become
[48:08] denominational. A lot of music, a lot of
[48:10] shout, a lot of carrying on intellectual
[48:11] conception. Those are the things that
[48:12] Leodysia has become. And with this
[48:15] intellectual conception comes a lot of
[48:17] emotion. But he says, but really that
[48:19] heart of flesh, that spirit, that
[48:21] eternal life, it's become foreign to the
[48:23] church. The heart of flesh, the real
[48:26] feeling, what kind of feeling? The mind
[48:29] of
[48:30] Christ. That kind of sensitivity, that
[48:32] kind of
[48:34] knowing. There's going to be another
[48:36] book of Acts. It requires another
[48:38] attempt by Satan to war against the
[48:40] word.
[48:45] I I'm I want to press I want to press
[48:48] further in this. I I feel like I can't
[48:50] know if I'm I don't know if I'm at an
[48:51] hour or how close I am to this, but I
[48:53] still have some more to go. I think I
[48:54] can go through this very quickly, but
[48:56] this is real this is real meat right
[48:58] here. If there's going to be another
[48:59] book of Acts, which we believe there is
[49:01] one being written, then Satan has to be
[49:02] there opposing the work of God. It's the
[49:05] acts of the Holy Spirit. Now, we have
[49:08] the Holy Spirit himself. We have the
[49:09] intelligence. If he's here, Satan's
[49:11] going to oppose that.
[49:14] Acts 12:4 and Acts 6:7. I'll read both
[49:17] of them. But the word of God grew and
[49:20] multiplied. The word of God became
[49:22] greater. It multiplied. It increased. Be
[49:25] fruitful, multiply, and replenish the
[49:26] earth. Now, we see at the genesis of the
[49:28] Christian church, the word of God grew
[49:29] and multiplied. This is the book of
[49:32] Acts. Acts 6:7. And the word of God
[49:35] increased and the number of the
[49:36] disciples multiplied in Jerusalem
[49:37] greatly. And a great company of the
[49:39] priests were obedient to the faith. This
[49:42] is the book of Acts. This is the the
[49:44] acts of the Holy Ghost. It is the word
[49:46] growing producing obedience to truth.
[49:50] If you do not see the word growing and
[49:53] you do not see obedience to the truth,
[49:55] that is not another book of Acts.
[49:58] That is the same book of Acts that could
[50:01] be impersonated.
[50:03] It can be it could be acts of the Holy
[50:05] Spirit where God is going to heal
[50:07] because he promised himself to that
[50:09] people these things could happen. But
[50:10] the real heart of the book of acts is
[50:12] the Holy Spirit which is gives us
[50:14] understanding and wisdom that grows. If
[50:17] it's not the word growing and obedience
[50:19] being produced then it's not the full
[50:20] book of acts.
[50:22] And where the word of God is growing and
[50:24] increasing and it's producing obedience
[50:26] to the word of God, Satan is nearby to
[50:28] stop it. Notice in the book of Acts how
[50:31] he tries to do so. We're talking about
[50:32] the final front line. Acts 13 6 to10.
[50:37] And when they had gone through the aisle
[50:38] unto Pos, they found a certain sorcerer,
[50:41] a false prophet, a Jew, whose name was
[50:44] Bar Jesus.
[50:46] Interesting. Son of Jesus, son of
[50:49] Joshua, son of salvation, son of
[50:51] healing. They're signifying divine
[50:53] counsel.
[50:55] He's a sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew,
[51:00] and a name that would associate himself
[51:03] with Jehovah, which was with the deputy
[51:05] of the country, Sergius Paulus, a
[51:07] prudent man who called for Barnabas and
[51:09] Saul, and desired to hear the word of
[51:13] God. I love this because he doesn't
[51:16] desire a miracle. Doesn't desire him to
[51:19] prophesy over him. Isn't desiring that
[51:22] he would make him wealthy or rich. He
[51:23] wants to hear the word and where there's
[51:26] a hunger to hear the word of God, Satan
[51:29] is right there to try to make it hard.
[51:31] But Almus the sorcerer for so his name
[51:34] is his name by interpretation. Now this
[51:36] is the same false prophet Jew named Bar
[51:38] Jesus. He's Almus which is wise man.
[51:42] Notice the characterization this takes
[51:44] on as a prophet, a Jew. So one of the
[51:48] circumcision we could say today a
[51:50] believer or Christian but he's a
[51:52] sorcerer.
[51:54] He appears to have divine counsel
[51:56] appears to be a wise man is associated
[51:59] with h salvation and
[52:02] healing but he withtood them. I hope
[52:05] that you're reading this in the Bible or
[52:07] just noting it down so you could read
[52:08] these words for yourself. Withtood them
[52:11] seeking to turn away the deputy from the
[52:13] faith.
[52:16] And as he does
[52:17] so, I I I want you to read into
[52:21] this because as he was with Sergius
[52:24] Paulus, and I could imagine that if I
[52:28] I'm just uh I'm just imagining here, but
[52:32] I'm going to take it back to scripture
[52:34] so you can see where I'm coming from. If
[52:37] Almus or Jesus was with this deputy,
[52:40] let's say that they knew each other,
[52:41] their acquaintances may be friends, and
[52:46] Sergio says, "I really want to hear the
[52:49] word that Paul's
[52:51] preaching." And the Bible says that he
[52:55] was subtle. Almus was subtle. So then I
[52:58] imagine that he didn't say, "Paul, he's
[53:00] false prophet. Paul is ignorant. Paul is
[53:02] this." And immediately start to tear
[53:03] down Paul because Paul could not be
[53:05] accused of being ignorant.
[53:08] Paul could not be accused of, "Well,
[53:09] he's just some sort of ruffian out of
[53:11] Nazareth." No, Paul had a reputation.
[53:14] Yes.
[53:15] He wasn't a pushover. He might have
[53:17] said, "Well, yeah, we know Paul is
[53:18] wonderful." But we also and and this and
[53:21] he used some means that was subtle
[53:24] because the Bible says Paul who's also
[53:26] Saul who is also named called Paul
[53:28] filled with the Holy Ghost set his eyes
[53:30] on him and said, "Oh, full of all
[53:33] subtlety and all mischief."
[53:36] So he was using subtlety like the
[53:38] serpent in the beginning
[53:41] who doesn't come out and say God there
[53:43] is no God. Who told you you couldn't eat
[53:46] of the trees? There's no God that can
[53:48] tell you that these trees are here. They
[53:50] naturally occurred.
[53:52] You how long it took us to get here? Two
[53:54] billion years. Come on woman, eat.
[53:57] Enjoy it. It's the subtlety of the
[54:00] serpent. What is he doing through his
[54:01] subtle tries to prevent the deputy from
[54:03] receiving the word? And Paul says, "Full
[54:06] of all subtlety, all mischief, thou
[54:07] child of the devil, thou enemy of all
[54:10] righteousness, wilt thou not cease to
[54:13] pervert the right ways of the Lord."
[54:16] So instead of controverting the right
[54:18] ways of the Lord in that here's the
[54:20] right way of the Lord, he says, "No,
[54:21] let's serve Satan." It's a perversion.
[54:24] What is a lie? Truth perverted.
[54:27] There's a righteousness. And what
[54:29] becomes unrighteous is you just tweak or
[54:31] change truth a little bit.
[54:34] your
[54:35] subtlety. You always pervert the right
[54:37] ways of the Lord. This is Satan's
[54:38] agenda. We're on the final front line.
[54:41] Satan's emmo has never changed. He's
[54:43] going to try to pervert the right ways
[54:44] of the Lord. He's going to fight the
[54:46] word of God growing and multiplying.
[54:47] He's going to fight the word of God
[54:48] increasing. He's going to fight it
[54:50] producing obedience to truth.
[54:54] In 2 Timothy 3:8, as it says, ever
[54:56] learning and ever able to come to the
[54:57] knowledge of the truth. In verse eight,
[54:58] now as Janice and Jammers withtood
[54:59] Moses, so do these also resist the
[55:02] truth. Men of corrupt minds reprobate
[55:05] concerning the faith. And it was
[55:07] resistance by mimicking. Wow. Resistance
[55:11] by imitation. Yes. It's resistance by
[55:15] saying we got that plus
[55:18] he does that. We can do this. This is
[55:21] what the prophet did. This is what we
[55:22] can do. There's a lot of Jamis and
[55:24] Jambers today that are trying to stand
[55:26] on the platform that brother Brandham
[55:28] stood on and take his place and use
[55:30] gifts out of turn.
[55:33] But it's the spirit of Janice and
[55:34] Jambers that withstand the truth.
[55:40] Thou always pervert. He always perverts
[55:43] the right ways of the Lord. Acts chapter
[55:46] 16 to 18. I'm saying if God is writing
[55:49] another book of acts, you're going to
[55:51] see this characteristic of Satan as
[55:53] well. And it came to pass as we went to
[55:55] prayer, a certain damsel possessed with
[55:57] the spirit of divination met us which
[56:00] brought her masters much gained by
[56:03] sooththesane. She has a spirit of
[56:06] divination. She is a prophetist. She is
[56:09] a sorcerer. She's one that can divine
[56:11] and say things. And they were able to
[56:13] use this wicked spirit. Her handlers,
[56:16] her masters used her for profit, for
[56:19] gain. And notice what the spirit of
[56:22] dividation is able to do. The same
[56:25] damsel followed Paul glory and cried
[56:30] saying, "These men are the servants of
[56:31] the most high God, which show us unto
[56:33] the us the way of
[56:35] salvation." He William Brandham has thus
[56:37] sayeth the Lord. He's God's prophet.
[56:39] Follow him. This is the word for the
[56:41] day. This is right. this woman with this
[56:44] evil spirit was able to follow Paul and
[56:46] us and say the right thing it seems
[56:51] and she did this many
[56:57] days but Paul being grieved I mean you
[57:02] know what many of us today would have
[57:04] said can I get this could I could I just
[57:05] record a little Tik Tok a little
[57:07] testimonial from you I want to include
[57:09] this in my digital newsletter we'd had a
[57:11] YouTube short, we would have turned into
[57:13] a full feature film. We would have done
[57:15] a documentary on this damsel. I mean,
[57:17] you know how she's got it? She's figured
[57:18] it out. See how vindicated we are? But
[57:22] Paul was grieved by it. Turned and said
[57:25] to the spirit, "I command thee in the
[57:27] name of Jesus Christ to come out of
[57:28] her." And he came out of he came out the
[57:32] same hour and her handlers were mad
[57:34] because now they lost their cash cow.
[57:36] I'm not calling the woman a cow. I'm
[57:38] just saying she brought them money.
[57:41] it. This was the spirit of make believe
[57:45] opposing the word. How did it do it?
[57:48] Through a spirit of divination that
[57:50] seemed to be expressing truth.
[57:56] But the spirit of divination, that word
[57:58] is
[57:59] pythos. It's a reference to that Python
[58:01] serpent or dragon.
[58:03] And the serpent and the dragon had no
[58:05] problem paring truth, mimicking truth,
[58:09] saying
[58:11] truth, but she followed many
[58:14] days. Never repented, never received
[58:17] Christ, never was
[58:19] baptized. There's no doubt that they
[58:21] would have been teaching and preaching
[58:22] and she would have heard it, but it
[58:23] shows she followed many days without
[58:25] obedience. Paul wasn't quick to rebuke
[58:28] the spirit, but after many days, it was
[58:30] clear. It showed its colors. When it
[58:33] came to the word, it said no. But when
[58:35] it came to the theatrics of following
[58:38] and the movement, she was just fine with
[58:40] it.
[58:43] The final front
[58:44] line, the final front line is that
[58:47] climactic point where we overthrow all
[58:50] intellectual and emotional faith to
[58:52] fully possess the
[58:54] promise. Where we are today, Satan now
[58:56] fights the true believer, a revelation
[58:59] of the word in this time of a rapture.
[59:02] I see that you're getting weary, so I'm
[59:04] going to I'm going to keep pressing on.
[59:06] If you're pretending to be asleep to try
[59:08] to get me to stop, I mean, you're asleep
[59:09] already, so wake up so I can finish.
[59:15] Recall how we were ministering on those
[59:17] two and a half
[59:19] tribes that come right up to the
[59:21] borderline. They have a lot of cattle
[59:24] and God said, "Come in and obey me and
[59:27] I'll give you water for your cattle.
[59:28] You'll plenty of grass for your cattle."
[59:30] As they came up to the borderline, they
[59:32] saw what it would take to get what they
[59:34] needed naturally. And they said, "You
[59:37] know what? I see a shortcut.
[59:39] There's plenty of green grass here
[59:41] already, plenty of water. Let me stay in
[59:44] these well-watered plains on the wrong
[59:45] side of Jordan. And here I'll have
[59:47] everything I need
[59:49] for my cattle." That was in Numbers
[59:53] 32. And it was a resurrection of that
[59:56] spirit of their fathers in Numbers 14.
[59:59] In Numbers 14, they sent spies in and
[1:00:01] they came back and said everything God
[1:00:03] said was true. Well, what do you mean?
[1:00:04] It's the land flowing with milk and
[1:00:05] honey. Okay. And full of enemies. And
[1:00:08] instead of saying, "God said that. He
[1:00:10] knows. He told us he'd drive them out
[1:00:12] from before us." They said, "But you
[1:00:13] know what? Our intelligence, our spies
[1:00:15] believe that we're not able to take it."
[1:00:17] And they refused to enter the promised
[1:00:19] land. It resulted in another 40 years of
[1:00:20] wonder in the wilderness. And in Numbers
[1:00:23] 32, the prophet called out, Moses called
[1:00:26] out these two and a half tribes as a
[1:00:28] resurrection of that same rebellious
[1:00:29] spirit.
[1:00:31] And God went ahead and gave them what
[1:00:34] they asked for.
[1:00:37] And it says in Joshua chapter 22, and he
[1:00:39] said, "But you'll have to enter and
[1:00:40] fight." So now think of this. They enter
[1:00:42] in. They're in the promised land.
[1:00:43] They're shoulder-to-shoulder. They're
[1:00:44] fighting. They're waring, but their
[1:00:45] heart is still on the other side of
[1:00:47] Jordan. And there here Joshua is
[1:00:49] speaking. This is Joshua 22. So we're
[1:00:51] coming down to the end. He says, "And he
[1:00:52] spake unto them, saying, these two and a
[1:00:54] half tribes, return with much riches
[1:00:56] unto your tents, and with very much
[1:00:57] cattle, with silver, and with gold, and
[1:00:59] with brass, and with iron, and with very
[1:01:01] much reignment. Divide the spoil of your
[1:01:03] enemies with your brethren." They they
[1:01:05] have a lot to boast of. They have a lot
[1:01:07] that they've accomplished. And the
[1:01:08] children of Reuben, and the children of
[1:01:09] Gad, and the half tribe of Manasseh
[1:01:11] returned. Now, the language here is
[1:01:13] important. and departed from the
[1:01:15] children of Israel out of Shiloh, which
[1:01:17] is in the land of
[1:01:20] Canaan, to go to the country of Gilead,
[1:01:23] to the land of their possession, where
[1:01:26] they were possessed, wherever they were
[1:01:29] possessed.
[1:01:31] Huh? Is that what it is? Is that what I
[1:01:33] think it means? I don't know. They were
[1:01:36] possessed by the land.
[1:01:39] They were possessed by the the the
[1:01:40] attributes and the characteristics of
[1:01:42] the land. They didn't possess that land.
[1:01:44] It possessed them according to the word
[1:01:46] of the Lord by the hand of
[1:01:48] Moses. So God allowed Moses to grant to
[1:01:51] them special permission. Go ahead. You
[1:01:53] can have what you
[1:01:55] want. But they departed from the
[1:01:59] children of
[1:02:01] Israel. Notice that as soon as they
[1:02:04] separate themselves out, the whole of
[1:02:07] the children of Israel remains the same.
[1:02:08] But now they become the two and a half
[1:02:10] that's left. It doesn't say, "And the
[1:02:13] children of Israel expanded their
[1:02:14] borders west east of the Jordan." No,
[1:02:16] they've departed from them. So, there's
[1:02:18] a separation that's taking place. The
[1:02:22] the the sea, the real Jim seed is there
[1:02:24] in the promised land. And now this part
[1:02:26] pulls away. And they leave out of
[1:02:30] Shiloh. You know what that means, right?
[1:02:33] The place of rest.
[1:02:36] And they walk away from there from God's
[1:02:38] promises to Gilead which is a heap of
[1:02:42] stones dividing themselves from the
[1:02:44] children of Israel. Says in Canadan
[1:02:48] Canaan I didn't say Canadan I said
[1:02:51] Canaan from Canaan they separate
[1:02:54] themselves from the promised land from
[1:02:56] the children of that promised
[1:02:58] land and there they produce this is an
[1:03:02] artificial move artificial revival. They
[1:03:04] produced, I want to say, an artificial
[1:03:06] resurrection, a religious movement
[1:03:08] contrived by man.
[1:03:11] Verse
[1:03:12] 10. And when they came into the borders
[1:03:14] of the Jordan that are in the land of
[1:03:16] Canaan, so now they come to they're they
[1:03:20] cross over. They come to the border. As
[1:03:22] they cross over, they right there,
[1:03:23] closest point they can be, the children
[1:03:26] of Reuben and the children of Gad and
[1:03:27] the half tribe of Manasseh. Because
[1:03:29] notice they're not the children of
[1:03:30] Israel anymore.
[1:03:31] They're known by these three things.
[1:03:34] Built there an altar by
[1:03:37] Jordan. Phrases it this way, a great
[1:03:40] altar to see
[1:03:44] to. Some translations said they erected
[1:03:46] a great altar for
[1:03:49] display. They they built a great display
[1:03:53] for the reason to see to, for the reason
[1:03:56] to look to and to see. They built
[1:03:58] something great and grand and big right
[1:04:00] on the Jordan. Why did they do it right
[1:04:02] on the Jordan? So people on the other
[1:04:03] side could look and see it. They didn't
[1:04:06] go into the land that they were
[1:04:07] possessed by and possess the land and
[1:04:10] build a church or build an altar or do a
[1:04:11] movement or whatever it is they're going
[1:04:12] to do there far away. They wanted to get
[1:04:15] as close as they could because in their
[1:04:16] heart, no matter what they say later,
[1:04:18] what's really driving them at the end of
[1:04:19] the day is the pretense to posture to
[1:04:21] the people who wanted the promise, to
[1:04:24] the people willing to suffer by
[1:04:25] obedience.
[1:04:27] They intentionally built a place of
[1:04:29] worship and a place of sacrifice to get
[1:04:31] attention
[1:04:33] was done to provoke
[1:04:36] the construction of this altar. No
[1:04:39] matter what language they want to use
[1:04:41] and how they want to characterize it, no
[1:04:43] matter how this conflict was resolved,
[1:04:45] is a renouncement of God and his
[1:04:47] promise. They reject his rest. They
[1:04:50] reject his presence. They've separated
[1:04:53] themselves out from the children of
[1:04:54] Israel. They've separated themselves out
[1:04:56] from the promised land, Canaan. And the
[1:04:58] first thing they want to do is build a
[1:05:00] altar big enough so that people in the
[1:05:04] promised land see
[1:05:06] it. But it's a separation from God.
[1:05:08] Notice in Deuteronomy 12:es 10, 11, and
[1:05:11] 12, God speaking. But when you go over
[1:05:14] Jordan, that means you're in the land of
[1:05:16] Canaan. Indwell in the land which the
[1:05:18] Lord your God giveth you to inherit, for
[1:05:20] you to possess. And when he giveth you
[1:05:23] rest from all your enemies round about
[1:05:25] so that you dwell in safety. Notice the
[1:05:27] parallel to they they crossed Jordan,
[1:05:30] left Canaan, left
[1:05:32] Shiloh. You can't seeing the parallel
[1:05:34] here. The language that's used in Joshua
[1:05:36] 22 is trying to show us what they're
[1:05:38] leaving. Then there shall be a place
[1:05:41] which the Lord your God shall choose to
[1:05:43] cause his name to dwell. There thither.
[1:05:47] There. There. There. There. Thither
[1:05:49] shall you bring all that I command you.
[1:05:52] There is going to be the altar to
[1:05:54] worship. There is where you bring your
[1:05:56] burnt offerings. There is where you
[1:05:57] sacrifice. There is where you bring your
[1:05:59] tithes. There's where you bring your
[1:06:00] heave offering of your hand and all your
[1:06:02] choice vows which you vow unto the Lord.
[1:06:04] It got it needs to be there. That's the
[1:06:06] only place I'm going to put my main
[1:06:07] name. It's my chosen place of worship.
[1:06:09] It's the place that I dwell. So when
[1:06:12] they crossed over Jordan and built a
[1:06:13] church, built an altar and started
[1:06:15] sacrificing and started worshiping and
[1:06:17] started bringing tithes, it was a clear
[1:06:19] rebellion against the word that says you
[1:06:21] can't do that there. No matter how much
[1:06:23] it looks like the truth, it's got to be
[1:06:25] in the place that God put his name.
[1:06:29] And notice what it does to the children
[1:06:31] of Israel. Verses 11 and 12. And the
[1:06:33] children of Israel heard say and the
[1:06:36] children of Isra say, behold. So it was
[1:06:39] a quite a meeting if they heard
[1:06:41] it, heard about it. The fame is being
[1:06:45] spread. Behold, the children of I just
[1:06:47] love it. They're known by this unholy
[1:06:49] trinity. The children of Reuben, the
[1:06:51] children of Gaton, the half tribe of
[1:06:52] Manasseh. That's a mouthful. Israelites.
[1:06:54] And who are these other guys? Well, it's
[1:06:55] the children of Reuben, the children of
[1:06:56] G, the half tribe of
[1:06:58] Manasseh. They built an altar over
[1:07:00] against the land of Canaan. The language
[1:07:02] itself even suggests not just location,
[1:07:05] but intention over against the land of
[1:07:08] Canaan. in the borders of Jordan at the
[1:07:10] passage of the children of Israel. Think
[1:07:13] about that. The very place that there
[1:07:15] would have been a memorial of the
[1:07:17] promise to enter and to possess, they
[1:07:19] decided to get right up to the
[1:07:21] borderline and there create that.
[1:07:26] And when the children of Israel heard of
[1:07:27] it, the whole congregation of the
[1:07:28] children of Israel gather themselves
[1:07:30] together at Shiloh to go up to war
[1:07:34] against them.
[1:07:36] another provocation. But now not in the
[1:07:39] wilderness. This altar, this worship,
[1:07:42] this uh tumult, this
[1:07:47] loud clamor is stirring up
[1:07:51] strife. They built it for to see. They
[1:07:53] built it big enough to see. And so by
[1:07:55] raising up this movement against God,
[1:07:58] it's
[1:07:59] provoking those in the promised land to
[1:08:02] go to war with those who are without.
[1:08:09] I want to I want to say
[1:08:11] this. That's just what the devil wants.
[1:08:16] It's just what he
[1:08:18] wants. God's given you something to do.
[1:08:20] You go to do it. The devil starts asking
[1:08:22] a bunch of questions. You're like, "No,
[1:08:24] no. What did God want you to do?" Come
[1:08:25] on. Having this conversation recently
[1:08:28] with some brothers on how, you know, God
[1:08:30] one time told a young prophet to do
[1:08:32] something. And he said, "Whatever you
[1:08:34] do, don't stop. Don't stop to eat. Go
[1:08:36] speak. Come back. If you stop, you'll
[1:08:38] die." Pretty straightforward. In the
[1:08:42] meantime, God tells an older prophet to
[1:08:46] do what? Stop the young prophet and
[1:08:49] invite him to dinner.
[1:08:51] Okay. So then the old prophet stops the
[1:08:54] young prophet says, 'Oh no, the Lord
[1:08:55] told me, "Go to dinner." And he's a
[1:08:57] little impressionable, a little bit
[1:08:58] influenced. Says, "Okay, well, let me do
[1:08:59] it." And then he goes to dinner and the
[1:09:01] old prophet's like, "You shouldn't have
[1:09:02] done this. You're going to die." He's
[1:09:04] like, "But what do you mean?" God told
[1:09:07] him to do something. And I was fel say,
[1:09:08] "Hey, I don't know which one I am in
[1:09:09] this story, but I'm going to do what I'm
[1:09:12] called to do.
[1:09:14] I don't know if I'm the young one, but
[1:09:16] if I'm the young one, I'm going to go
[1:09:18] I'm going to do my thing. If I'm the
[1:09:19] only one, I'm going to invite I'm going
[1:09:20] to do I I've got to do what God asked me
[1:09:23] to do.
[1:09:25] There's a lesson to learn. Sometimes we
[1:09:26] just say, "Well, Jesus goes everywhere
[1:09:28] he's invited."
[1:09:30] Well, that's about Jesus, right? This is
[1:09:34] about
[1:09:35] you to go. Well, what if it was an old
[1:09:38] prophet inviting you away from God's
[1:09:40] will for you?
[1:09:43] So, then it continues in verse 16.
[1:09:47] This is the response of these children
[1:09:50] of Israel. And notice how they
[1:09:52] characterize what's being done. Thus
[1:09:54] sayith the whole congregation of the
[1:09:56] Lord, "What trespass is this that you
[1:09:58] have committed against the God of Israel
[1:10:00] to turn away this day from following the
[1:10:03] Lord? In that ye have builded you an
[1:10:06] altar that you might rebel this day
[1:10:07] against the Lord." over and over. It's
[1:10:10] rebellion cloaked in religion, in
[1:10:13] worship, platitudes, offerings,
[1:10:16] sacrifices.
[1:10:19] It's a trespass in turning away from
[1:10:21] following the Lord. Is the iniquity of
[1:10:23] Peor too little for us from which we are
[1:10:25] not cleansed until this day, although
[1:10:27] there was a plague in the congregation
[1:10:29] of the Lord. In other words, they're
[1:10:30] still putting back to the feast of Belor
[1:10:32] and the spirits that cause him to be
[1:10:33] seduced away from God. Is it not enough
[1:10:35] that we fell there, but that you and
[1:10:38] remember it's that spirit of Kades
[1:10:39] Barnea
[1:10:42] there. There's your there's your
[1:10:43] paradox. I don't know if I mentioned it
[1:10:44] here, but brother Brandham associates
[1:10:48] the spirit of Baal and Balum and the sin
[1:10:51] of Kades Barnea, even though it happened
[1:10:53] after Numbers 14, but where does it come
[1:10:56] up in Numbers
[1:10:58] 32? says, "But that ye must turn away
[1:11:01] from this day from following the Lord,
[1:11:03] and it will be, seeing ye rebel today
[1:11:05] against the Lord, that tomorrow he will
[1:11:07] be wroth with the whole congregation of
[1:11:09] Israel. Notwithstanding, if the land of
[1:11:11] your possession be unclean," listen to
[1:11:13] what he says. "If where you live is
[1:11:16] unclean, then pass you over into the
[1:11:19] land of the possession of the Lord,
[1:11:21] wherein the Lord's tabernacle dwelleth,
[1:11:23] and take possession among us." Oh,
[1:11:26] hallelujah. Notice how you might be
[1:11:28] enticed and drawn to go across. Well,
[1:11:31] we're all brothers. That's just
[1:11:32] fellowship and worship. They say, "But
[1:11:34] if where you're at's unclean, if you
[1:11:35] need to sanctify it, if you're needing
[1:11:37] to worship there, because where you are
[1:11:39] is unclean, come to where God has led
[1:11:40] us,
[1:11:43] where the tabernacle of the Lord dwells
[1:11:44] and take your possession among us. But
[1:11:46] rebel not against the Lord, nor rebel
[1:11:48] against us in building you an altar
[1:11:50] beside the altar of the Lord our God."
[1:11:52] It's only one place. Now they were
[1:11:55] trying to mimic it, pattern after it
[1:11:57] artificially. And it brings us to this.
[1:11:59] Did Achen not did not Achen the son of
[1:12:02] Zarah commit a trespass in the occursed
[1:12:04] thing?
[1:12:06] And wrath fell on all the congregation
[1:12:08] of
[1:12:09] Israel. Think of this. Think very deeply
[1:12:11] now. You with me? Where did it happen?
[1:12:13] Jericho. And where was the next battle?
[1:12:17] Ai.
[1:12:24] Not saying it is, but could it
[1:12:29] be? They perished
[1:12:31] alone in his
[1:12:35] iniquity. I close this with two
[1:12:37] quotations from the message of the hour
[1:12:39] and scripture in between. Very short
[1:12:41] here in proving his word. Now think with
[1:12:43] me. Concentrate. He says, "Don't you see
[1:12:45] in shadows? Stop here a minute. In the
[1:12:47] last days, there's got to be a place
[1:12:50] prepared for the word to be made be
[1:12:52] manifested.
[1:12:53] And we're now living by the evidence of
[1:12:55] the new land, the son of man.
[1:12:58] There is a place prepared for the word
[1:13:00] to be manifested. We have entered into
[1:13:03] the new land. And don't put it past
[1:13:05] Satan to try to produce an affront,
[1:13:08] right? to try to either expand the
[1:13:10] borders of that land, to expand the
[1:13:12] boundaries of that promised land, to go
[1:13:15] back to a glare of another age, to try
[1:13:17] to bring you further into something else
[1:13:19] that doesn't exist and stay. So stay in
[1:13:22] the word of God. It is the new land.
[1:13:25] We've been brought to this new land.
[1:13:29] So it it it
[1:13:31] type those things that we see in Numbers
[1:13:33] 32 and Joshua 22 is part of that final
[1:13:36] front line. try to provoke us to war.
[1:13:39] You've got an enemy to fight, right?
[1:13:42] He's going to use any means necessary,
[1:13:44] whether it be a damsel or a lemus. He's
[1:13:46] going to use any means necessary to
[1:13:48] resist and pervert the truth of God.
[1:13:50] Amen. But Isaiah 34 15-16 in a time when
[1:13:55] they're saying, "Lord, Christ is here.
[1:13:56] Christ is there. Christ is here. Christ
[1:13:58] is there." We are gathered to the word,
[1:14:01] the unfailing body word of the son of
[1:14:03] man, the new land where we've promised
[1:14:05] to the Gentiles. He says, "There shall
[1:14:07] be the great owl, make her nest, and lay
[1:14:09] and hatch and gather unto her shadow.
[1:14:11] Don't you see in the shadow, stop here a
[1:14:12] moment, a place prepared for the word to
[1:14:14] be made manifest. There shall the
[1:14:16] vultures also be gathered, everyone with
[1:14:18] her
[1:14:19] mate." On an interesting language here,
[1:14:21] he says, "Seek ye out the book of the
[1:14:24] Lord, and
[1:14:26] read." This is where you're seeking
[1:14:29] Christ, the mind of God. Seek out the
[1:14:31] open book. Read. And no one of these
[1:14:34] shall
[1:14:35] fail, but those that read what's read in
[1:14:38] the book, none shall want of her mate.
[1:14:40] Why? He reveals himself to you. Your
[1:14:43] mate is the revealed word. For my mouth
[1:14:45] it hath commanded it, and his spirit it
[1:14:47] hath gathered them.
[1:14:49] The word, the spirit is gathering you.
[1:14:51] The deep calls to a deep. It seeks you
[1:14:52] out. You've been called. You've been
[1:14:54] selected. Now the deep's responding. I
[1:14:56] want to know you more. Draw me deeper
[1:14:58] into relationship with you. Give me this
[1:15:01] heart of flesh that can feel you and
[1:15:03] know you. Amen.
[1:15:05] Seek ye out the book and read. Seek it
[1:15:09] out. Musicians, you welcome to come.
[1:15:13] Brother Andrew, if you could just be
[1:15:14] ready too as well, possibly to turn it
[1:15:16] over. He says, "Remember no other church
[1:15:18] age." This is a sermon masterpiece. I've
[1:15:20] been drawing this all these themes from
[1:15:21] these sermons Christ identified in his
[1:15:23] word and these different sermons that
[1:15:25] drew me into this concept of God is the
[1:15:27] ultimate creator. God, there's this
[1:15:29] mind, this intelligence. Remember, no
[1:15:31] other church was he put out of in the
[1:15:33] Bible of the seven church ages. How many
[1:15:36] remembers
[1:15:37] it? Seven church ages. And in the last
[1:15:40] one, he's out of the church.
[1:15:43] Listen, this is important. He passed
[1:15:45] through the church
[1:15:47] age. He passes through
[1:15:50] Leodysia to go on to make something
[1:15:55] else.
[1:15:58] the
[1:15:59] masterpiece. He passes through Leodysia
[1:16:02] to make something else. But this is it.
[1:16:05] There's nothing else. But the
[1:16:08] sculptor has got back to perfection
[1:16:11] again. The word
[1:16:14] do not go back.
[1:16:19] He has said I believe very explicitly
[1:16:22] Christ has been kicked out of Leodysia.
[1:16:24] He passed through Le Oysia to go on to
[1:16:28] make to bring forth the masterpiece
[1:16:32] again. So he says don't go back.
[1:16:37] Don't do
[1:16:38] it. Don't do it. Even if it's to be
[1:16:41] recognize that if you're ever feeling
[1:16:43] this uncction to do something, ask
[1:16:45] yourself, am I going backwards?
[1:16:48] Am I going in reverse?
[1:16:51] Am I am I being drawn off sides? Am I
[1:16:53] being called away?
[1:16:56] And in that moment
[1:16:57] whenever this movement popped up on the
[1:17:00] other side of Jordan right there on
[1:17:02] purpose, their instinct was to fight
[1:17:05] against it. Why? Because they saw it for
[1:17:08] what it was. Another feast of Bel
[1:17:11] Peor, another sin of
[1:17:13] Achen, another rebellion against
[1:17:15] Deuteronomy 12. They saw it for what it
[1:17:19] was.
[1:17:20] But where the perhaps the the weakness
[1:17:23] was is they wanted to fight against
[1:17:27] it. Ultimately there's no warfare or
[1:17:30] blood that
[1:17:33] shed. Cooler heads prevail. There's no
[1:17:36] civil
[1:17:38] war. But the children of Israel, seeing
[1:17:42] it for what it
[1:17:43] was, were almost provoked to
[1:17:46] fight. and they had their hands full in
[1:17:49] the land they were
[1:17:51] in. They didn't need to be running off
[1:17:53] to the wilderness to fight another
[1:17:55] battle. If it's of God, we don't want to
[1:17:58] fight against it. If it's not, it'll
[1:18:00] come to not. But as for me in my house,
[1:18:03] we will serve the Lord in the land that
[1:18:06] he has led us. It's one thing that we
[1:18:09] should be willing to support in any
[1:18:12] situation is the will of God in somebody
[1:18:15] else's life and in our own lives. If
[1:18:17] somebody tells you, "I believe I'm
[1:18:18] following the Lord. I'm being sincere. I
[1:18:19] believe this is good for me and my
[1:18:20] family. I believe this is what God wants
[1:18:22] me to do." Even if you can't quite see
[1:18:24] it in the word, there's one thing that
[1:18:25] we could get behind to say, "Well,
[1:18:27] brother, if you believe you're following
[1:18:28] the Lord, sister, if you believe you're
[1:18:29] obeying God, I can get behind that
[1:18:31] 100%."
[1:18:33] But I will not go back.
[1:18:36] I
[1:18:37] cannot turn back now. Let's stand
[1:18:42] together. Let's pray. Heavenly Father,
[1:18:47] today as
[1:18:49] we sitting here a week after the
[1:18:52] celebration of Resurrection Sunday,
[1:18:54] Easter
[1:18:57] Sunday, Lord, it was on that seventh
[1:19:02] day, I believe, you appeared to
[1:19:09] Thomas and you said, "Behold my hands
[1:19:14] and my
[1:19:16] side. And Lord, as much as we often
[1:19:19] think of the day you resurrected to
[1:19:21] ponder and consider how you constantly
[1:19:23] appeared to your disciples after the
[1:19:28] resurrection. And I believe it speaks to
[1:19:30] us in this day at the rising of the sun.
[1:19:32] Here you are once again making your
[1:19:34] presence known amongst your
[1:19:36] people. And just as you had a purpose at
[1:19:39] that day to solidify and anchor those
[1:19:41] Jews and the promise of the comforter
[1:19:44] that they would be in that upper room on
[1:19:46] that 50th day after after uh the feast
[1:19:50] of the Passover that they would be there
[1:19:53] the time of the
[1:19:55] Pentecost at that moment in that time is
[1:19:58] when you would seal up that age with
[1:20:01] their capstone with the the the the
[1:20:04] purpose and the thrust of that first
[1:20:07] coming for
[1:20:09] them. And here we said in this last
[1:20:11] days, the gentile bride, we've come to
[1:20:13] our upper room. We've come to our
[1:20:15] climax. It is that rapture. It is that
[1:20:17] change of our body. And here you are
[1:20:19] once again making your presence known to
[1:20:21] bring us to that place of
[1:20:24] climax and even a meeting in the air.
[1:20:27] And Lord, I believe the enemy fights us
[1:20:29] in this final front line to try to get
[1:20:31] us
[1:20:33] distracted, try to cause us to fight, to
[1:20:37] cleave to that sword. But Lord, we are
[1:20:38] taught that it's when the old
[1:20:40] Pentecostal fighters die that we'll
[1:20:43] fully possess and live in this peace of
[1:20:46] the promised
[1:20:47] land. Help us to stay focused on the
[1:20:50] goal. Help us to use some prudence and
[1:20:51] wisdom to apply these things
[1:20:53] practically because Lord, there is an
[1:20:55] enemy that has built very robust tools
[1:20:57] of distraction. There's the dopamine
[1:21:00] cycles. There's the anxiety of
[1:21:02] economics. There's the uh uh the
[1:21:04] pressure of politics. There's a lot of
[1:21:06] things, Lord, that motivate us. A lot of
[1:21:09] hierarchy of needs at work within us.
[1:21:11] But Lord, if we could just cast
[1:21:12] everything aside and say, "Lord, I need
[1:21:13] you above it all. I need you more than
[1:21:16] anything. I want you more than anything.
[1:21:20] Lord, to even be able to say that no
[1:21:21] matter what it is, my wife, my children,
[1:21:24] this church, my friends, my recreations,
[1:21:26] my hobbies, my enjoyments, my music, my
[1:21:28] job, my money, I'd forsake it all for
[1:21:32] you,
[1:21:33] Lord. Wouldn't want to hold on to any
[1:21:35] one of that if it meant losing
[1:21:37] you. So, I pray, Lord, my heart is right
[1:21:39] before you and everything else can be in
[1:21:42] its place to be the blessing that it
[1:21:44] ought to be.
[1:21:46] I pray that you bless your people who
[1:21:47] have been so faithful today to just sit
[1:21:50] for such a long period of time, Lord,
[1:21:51] and hear the word. Bless them, Father.
[1:21:54] I'm grateful for their patience and
[1:21:56] their
[1:21:57] attention. May
[1:21:59] you take this word out of the realm of
[1:22:01] the academic and may it grow in their
[1:22:03] understanding and knowledge of you and
[1:22:05] their souls. Let this mind be in us,
[1:22:08] Lord. We desire it to be in us so we
[1:22:09] seek your face, Lord. We have our own
[1:22:12] deep seek. It's the Holy Spirit in our
[1:22:14] heart searching things out. We have our
[1:22:16] own open AI. It's the open of the word,
[1:22:18] the real thing. Adoni's intelligence.
[1:22:21] Lord, help us, Jesus, to surrender
[1:22:23] ourselves to you. We can have this deep
[1:22:26] mind, Lord. This thinking that is of you
[1:22:29] searches all things. Yay. Deep things.
[1:22:31] Not so that we could be heady and
[1:22:32] high-minded and engage in political
[1:22:34] debate and discourse on theology, but so
[1:22:36] that we could have the intelligence to
[1:22:38] meet the enemy. You're bringing the word
[1:22:41] to the
[1:22:42] battlefront. You've brought the word to
[1:22:44] the front line. Here we are now meeting
[1:22:47] the enemy at his climax with the
[1:22:49] intelligence. The victory is won. It is
[1:22:52] assured. We yield to it now in the name
[1:22:54] of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
