TRANSCRIPT
========================================
but our our title tonight uh our subject tonight still the joy of Salvation And this is maybe going to be a little thought-provoking right off the start but my my uh title is the grinches and so I've got everyone's attention maybe this is another edition of kids eat free I don't know I didn't think of it that way but this is a series about salvation uh the joy that it produces and even touching on some of its connections to some Christmas themes of the Christmas time we do not believe that Jesus was born in the month of December uh you might just admire the fact that I'm using Christmas is still in November uh maybe that's just the at least it wasn't after July 4th like most people do these days but the uh we know Christ wasn't born in December but yet the the uh Christmas signifies and stands for Christ's coming to the Earth God's sending forth his son so a lot of themes connected to this that I want to tie back to Joy and the subject of the Grinch is we'll make abundantly clear to you tonight as we go forward so if the the use of the word Grinch stumbles you at all stick with me hopefully we'll give it some context to help you out so the joy of Salvation is the subject and we're just giving a title tonight called the grinches John chapter 16 verse 20. this is a great place to start to begin to to kind of launch into this thought more could be said on this scripture but I just want to kind of right over the top of it just to kind of introduce reintroduce some principles and touch on some things Jesus says very very I send you that ye shall weep and lament but the world shall rejoice that's a really odd statement he's describing the disciples as weeping but yet the world rejoicing and he then he comes right back to but your sorrow shall be turned into Joy so we may have moments of weeping moments of sorrow but sorrow shall be turned into joy and then he alludes to the pain of childbirth as being kind of like and unto what they're experiencing weeping and lamenting while the world is rejoicing but sorrow turned into Joy he says a woman when she is in travail hath sorrow because their hours come but as soon as she is delivered of the child she remembers no more the anguish for the joy that a man is Born Into the world let me just keep reading and ye now therefore have sorrow but I will see you again and your heart shall rejoice and your joy no man and taketh from you and in that day you shall ask me nothing verily verily I say unto you whatsoever ye shall ask the father in my name he will give it you hitherto have you asked me nothing in my name and ye shall ask and you shall receive that your joy may be full so again just looking at it as an overview he says you're weeping now you're Sorrowing the world is rejoicing but your sorrow will be turned into joy and he's going to use this example of a woman who is in her hour of travail knowing that that child is coming forth the pain that accompanies it and that terrible tremendous anguish that may be and even the trepidation the fear of how terrible it might be I'm not speaking from experience I can't but there's a pain that comes with childbirth there's a fear of the pain that comes and he alludes to that pain of childbirth quickly being forgotten as soon as the baby is born I'm sure that maybe mothers could testify to that and witness that there's this pain and even in the moment of that physical pain there's something about the child being born that causes the pain pain to dissipate and to disappear and you're not cognizant of it you're not thinking about it says oh for the joy that a man is Born Into the world and he eludes and even in saying this for the joy that a man is born in the world he's he's hearkening even to his own birth at the time that this child was born into the world because his birth is associated with joy and Luke Chapter 2 verses 10 and 11 it says and the angel said unto them speaking to the Shepherds fear not for behold I bring you good tidings of great joy and think of all the themes connected with the birth of Christ Joy is the consistent one which shall be to all people for unto you is Born This Day in the city of David a savior which is Christ the lord so he says that even as he speaks about even the scripture talk about the world being in travail and the world sorry in the world being in darkness and at the coming of the Messiah great light has sprung up and there's now this great joy that has come I bring you great Good Tidings of great joy Jesus is even alluding to his very coming using that language and then then he says that we should ask in his name and the point and the and the reference of that as he closes that as that your joy may be full he's pointing to a complete Joy the fullness of joy that he brings that only he can be or in total Joy so these are that just kind of shows that Joy is this main subject in this particular passage here as Christ speaks to him but my focus is on this he says your heart shall rejoice and that rejoice it means to be glad to Rejoice exceedingly the word is translated to Joy joyfully joyous joyful and joyfulness these are the words that's used it speaks of Joy ye shall rejoice you shall be joyful you shall cry out joyfully and he says and your joy no man taketh from you now when he says your joy no man take it from you he's clearly alluding to a stolen Joy he says you're Sorrowing now but joy will come your sorrow will be turned into joy and he says that this Joy you're going to have no man will be able to take away from you and I think we can gather from then by our own experience recognize that there's times of sorrow and stress wherein Joy has been lost there's times when oh I'm happy everything's great but something comes along and steals your joy and you thought where did my joy go where did my happiness go it's been stolen from you and Jesus is saying that there's going to be a time when your hearts will rejoice and the joy that you have no man will be able to steal from you no man will be able to take that Joy away from you so he's he is speaking of a joy that is permanent a joy that is inaccessible to a thief and so when we look at the idea of stolen Joy have you already made it there that's where that brings me to the grinches because the Grinch's steal things and Jesus says that the let no man he says your heart shall rejoice in your joy no man taketh from you Joy is something that can be stolen from you but we do not want our joy to be taken from us now the Grinch we've all heard of the Grinch before and you can think you can go to the next slide brother John if perhaps that'll work there the Grinch I think immediately all of us in our minds when even I use the phrase the grinches we associate it with Ted gazel's uh 1957 character from the the short story the book How The Grinch Stole Christmas and this is how we envision it this is even from the book itself and that's where our minds first go when we think of the Grinch I think that's appropriate because that's really how it entered into our language and even how the word is used today would be based upon this character Roderick Kipling however used the phrase grinching in the 1890s I believe it was it's in the lament of the the Border cattle thief and he speaks of a grinching a grind and a very grating noise something that would be bothersome something very harsh there's even references to the surname Grinch and fiction to describe characters who are harsh or severe going back as far as 1903 and you didn't know you were here for a literature lesson but you're getting one but this is this is a phrase though that we most often identify with Dr Seuss's character the Grinch even the Grinch may be remind us of Charles Dickens character Ebenezer Scrooge that Miser and the Christmas Carol from 1843 and so there's this there's this caricature of these personalities where they're they're mean they're all they're they're severe they're very very harsh and let me just give you a synopsis of the Grinch of Dr Seuss's Grinch and just generally he was hateful and ill-tempered but he especially hated Christmas and kind of the how many here have actually read the Grinch raise your hands are familiar with the Grinch all right so you'll you'll be able to catch the plot here very quickly but in the synopsis he hates Christmas so much that he tries to ruin Christmas for all of Whoville by stealing all their Christmas gifts and all the things related to it and he concocts this plan and by by Magic he's able to get all the all the gifts and all the trees and all the bells and whistles and everything that the who's used to celebrate Christmas and puts it back on top of that mountain I guess and he has stolen in his mind he has stolen Christmas from all the Whos and this is to his uh he is this makes him happy to make other people miserable and that's a characteristic of a Grinch and so he has now uh seemingly accomplished his great plan only to wake up on Christmas morning and hear the who's rejoicing and singing and happily celebrating Christmas and and he's like he's thinking wait how could they be celebrating Christmas when I've taken the gifts from him I took the tinsel I took the trees I took the turkeys I took all everything that they gather around for this tremendous day and he wakes up and he hears them still celebrating and they're happy to have hands to clasp and they're rejoicing that they have each other and Christmas means more to them than the gifts and he realizes Christmas means more than he thought and the The Story begins with him having a heart two sizes too small and then when he hears this rejoicing on Christmas Day by all the who's his heart grows three sizes he returns back down the mountain to give all the gifts back to the who's and they celebrate his feast and that's the story of the Grinch so in the story The Grinch is redeemed and and it's a it's a story of redemption and one whose character is changed but the way that we use the phrase today a Grinch and the next slide with John a Grinch is a grumpy person who spoils The Joy or the happiness or the pleasure of others that is the idea behind a grinch anybody use the word Grinch lately you will before the month of December is over I'm sure but it's somebody it's a grumpy person a grudging person a Stern a harsh person a unfund person just as the Grinch was uh just generally mean and ill-tempered a Grinch is one who spoils the joy of others a person who does not does not like other people celebrating or enjoying themselves a grinch does not rejoice when somebody else rejoices a Grinch is not happy when somebody else is happy a grinch as a matter of fact does not like it when other people are celebrating it does not like it when other people are having fun a grinch even by definition and I believe it maybe Cambridge or oxfords is a person whose mean-spirited and unfriendly that's what a Grinch is ever heard of a killjoy right it literally means a murder of Joy but a killjoy that's a grinch a killjoy is one who spoils the pleasures of others one who will Who is grudgingly about something and just out of their ill-temperedness refuses to participate in an activity and we're like oh don't be a kill Joy surely you could play exploding kittens or surely you can play Taco whatever it is it is you you know what huh yeah sure Taco goat cat cheese pizza whatever surely and someone who doesn't like I don't like doing puzzles I don't like doing board games I don't like doing this I don't like it we said they're a grits they're Killjoy and so this one who doesn't participate in an activity and it kind of brings everything down and sours everything and so this is what a Grinch is in our minds and this is what a Grinch is this is what I'm alluding to a grumpy person who tries to steal somebody else's Joy unhappy person who doesn't like it when people are celebrating and and is it bothers them when people are rejoicing and and I think the phrase is right I think I don't know if it's from the cartoon or something but the people are rejoicing and singing songs and the Grinch laments I think it's in one of the movies where he says oh it's joyful and triumphant right he hates that and when we talk about the grinches going a little bit too fast there brother John but it's all right the Grinch's we want to identify the grinches so we're doing is we're going to identify the grinches and I'm also going to say don't be a Grinch in other words don't let anybody steal your joy that's when we identify grinches we're identifying these things that try to steal your joy grinches still our joy and then you don't want to steal other people's Joy and so the Grinch is that still Joy we're going to look at a few grinches that still Joy but let's and we're thinking about this the Grinch is that still Joy David already alluded to one when we read Psalms 51 12 on Sunday he says restore unto me the joy of my salvation it was on his own sin his own Disobedience that stole his joy and he asked for it to be stored back to him why because it had been taken away from him and so when we say the grinches it's the grinches that steal your joy in John chapter 16 verses 23 and 24 he said in that day you shall ask me nothing verily verily I say unto you whatsoever shall ask the name ask the father in my name he will give it to you hitherto have you asked nothing in my name ask and you shall receive that your joy may be full I come back to this because Jesus is saying that if you ask I'll give it to you ask you shall receive and it's an asking of him and receiving of him he says that brings us the fullness of joy and so I start here because we need to know where our joy comes from we need to be sent or to recognize where do I find my true peace where do I find my Tranquility where is it I'm going to find my satisfaction and there's ways that we can testify that when we were in the world we try to find our satisfaction a lot of things whether it be Athletics whether it be in a hobby whether it be in the bottle whether it be in in women whether it be in this we tried to find our where we fit in we tried to find something that brings us this enduring peace and satisfaction and there's only one place we find it you're going to find it in God he said well that's not true of this person it's not true of that person well I can't speak for everyone else but for the elect they need to know that their true joy and their true happiness comes from God so we read on Sunday in the message the token brother Brown says God is your joy God is your strength I love this knowing the message knowing the truth that's our sufficiency think of that then everything is satisfied in knowing truth you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free it's kind of this liberating precept that that liberates me from sadness and despondency and Melancholy he's my all sufficiency everything I find is in him and in this truth in him all things I have need of is in him that's our strength My Help Cometh From The Lord my hope is in the Lord my expectation is in the Lord these are the things we want to emphasize you Christians Look to Him for your joy Look to Him for your strength look for him for your happiness he is my peace he is my joy he is my love he is my life there's one thing about Christmas and maybe I'm not necessarily riffing right now but it's one some of the things that have informed my heart as I've considered these things as is the promise of Christmas is so Grand and has gotten even more and more sparkly as we advance in technology and there's this huge promise for it and you could just simply relate it to the fact that I'm 47 years old and not seven but there's there's this emptiness that comes sometime around on the 25th in the afternoon right after everything's already been opening look this is it right I'm just looking forward to this for for a whole year and this is it it's over and there just seems to be something always lacking where no matter how great it is there's always this was there more is there another something hidden do you remember as a kid maybe going through all the paper and looking under the couch and shuffling under the nativity scene and hoping that maybe there's one last gift because even though you've got a lot of great things there always seems to be something it just that doesn't quite put you over the edge why because our there's the promise and the Allure of all the tinsel and all the lights and all the singing and all the gifts can never satisfy you like Christ can satisfy you our happiness comes from him he is our peace he is our Joys our love he's our life and in Psalm 62 5 it says my soul wait thou only upon God for my expectation is from him my hope is in him my expectation is from him in other words those things that I desire those things that I believe will bring me joy those things that I believe will satisfy those things that I believe will suffice come from him for he is my joy he is my strength he is my peace so there's a few Grinch I didn't number them I guess maybe I could have done it and we could do it maybe as we go along but of the grinches that still Joy hope is a Grinch when I say hope I'm talking about the the the wrong kind of expectation hope is a grinch it's one of the grinches that steals our Joy James chapter 1 verses 16 to 17 he says do not air my beloved Brethren every good gift and every perfect gift is from above and cometh down from the Father of Lights I don't know that James knew that gifts and lights would come together in the season of Christmas and would be so pronounced in such a festive time as this but it reminds us that every good gift and every perfect gift is from above and cometh down from the Father of Lights with whom is no variableness neither shadow of turning God is The Giver of good gifts we can give gifts to one another we can give what we would call good gifts we could even find that gifts are practical very useful and bring us joy there's joy and giving there's certainly joy in receiving but God is The Giver of the good gifts God is the source of our joy that even in our giving we should be we should recognize that I'm giving of what God has given to me I'm able to give because God has blessed me when we receive from others we should receive it as from the Lord and as a the goodness of God and something he's blessing us with so that at the end of the day all praise and glory goes to God from whom all good things come from every good gift and every perfect gift comes from the Father of Lights in whom there is no Darkness there is no ulterior motive there is no jealousy a dark jealousy or something hidden to our demise every good gift every perfect gift comes from above and so even if we revisit John chapter 16 verse 33 Jesus has given them of words of warning he's telling the word you're going to be sorry in the world is going to be rejoicing and he says a lot of difficult things in this passage but he says these things have I spoken unto you that in me you might have peace our peace ought not come from anything else but him even in light of the difficult things that he says he says I'm telling you things with the promise so that me alone you'll have peace not just merely hay in the future this is going to happen in the future that's going to happen he wants our peace to solely come from him these things have I spoken unto you that in me you might have peace he says in the world he shall have tribulation but be of good cheer I have overcome the world what's the source of our joy what's the source of our cheer it is from the Lord our expectation is from him be of good cheer my joy comes from the fact that he has overcome the world so my my thought was this is I looked at these scriptures it's when we're looking to the wrong things to give a satisfaction that we find ourselves disappointed we get our hopes up we get all excited we're anticipating something we all know this is going to satisfy I think we even mentioned it here recently now if I could just do this if I could just do that that's going to satisfy that's going to suffice that's going to the momentum is going to shift everything's gonna go in my favor and we kind of we go all in on these things and we kind of stake our happiness on it and we're expecting something from the world to tip the scales to bring us joy that's always going to let you down even if you get what you're wanting it's never going to bring you the happiness that you would want it to bring you ah well I was really hoping this would happen and sure enough it happens and guess what it's going to be empty to you I remember I had a friend in law school who was uh going through a very very difficult time with the grades and everything and I guess one of the statements they made to me is they said how come you don't sweat your grades and how come you're not worried about what the outcome is going to be and I I was just testifying of the goodness of God and I told him if I God wants me to have um the best job with six figure salary and at one of the best law firms when I graduate then I can have the worst grades in the class and I'm still going to get the job I said but if God doesn't want me to have that job I can have the best grade in the class and I'm not going to get that job I said so I've sold out and I've staked everything on him and I told this person I said this is just my just a testimony to give to support this what your expectation is from I said what you should I said what I've done is I've tied myself to an absolute and I chose the word of God and so my joy my happiness and my expectations connected with the word whatever the word stock price is at that's where my happiness is whether or not it's ever gonna is it ever gonna demise is it ever going to fail is it ever going to let me down no the Heaven and Earth shall pass away but the word will never pass away so I'm all in I'm invested in the word of God that determines my happiness so that's why I stake everything and I said that's what I've done I've sold out to the word of God I said I just recommend that you find yourself an absolute I said if it's your mom's cooking sell out to it and as long as that's good and as long as you're getting it be happy I said if it's the Dallas Mavericks sell out to it as long as they're winning as long as they're doing good you can be happy whatever it is find an absolute sell out to it and let that be your measure of joy that's when we begin to look to those other things as our source of contentment our source of satisfaction and we're hoping that's why I use this term hope we our hope hope is a grinch it's the greatest enemy that faith has in that sense hope is a Grinch why because it builds us up to expect these great things and I want this to happen I want this to happen and what happens even when it gives it to you you get it but it stole your joy because hope is a Grinch our expectations should be on the Lord and the Lord alone the next Grinch is we're identifying the Grinch's jealousy is a Grinch touching on these very briefly didn't want to be lengthy tonight because each one of these is worthy of a lot more attention in themselves but in Hebrews chapter 13 verse 5 remember jealousy is a Grinch if you didn't get that down that's number two Hebrews 13 Verse 5 let your conversation be without covetousness let it be without Envy in this deep-seated jealousy that connives and conspires and wants to have let your conversation let your life be without jealousy let it be without This Bitter Envy let it be without covetousness and we know what he's talking about because he says and be content with such things as you have for he hath said I will never leave thee nor forsake thee to me I believe this connects right back to Hope as a grinch we're putting our expectation in the right things he says don't live with jealousy be happy with you what you have because he said I will never leave thee no forsake thee because he has said I will never leave thee nor forsake Thee I can be content in whatever state I'm in because he said the never failing presence of Jesus Christ will be with you whether wherever you go therefore I can be content because I'm confident in his presence I'm confident in his provision I find my pleasure in the things of God and because he has said I'll never leave thee nor forsake Thee I can be content with whatever it is I have let your conversation be without jealousy or covetousness I think it's in times like this that we could find ourselves comparing whether it be how we celebrate Christmas or what we're going to get for Christmas or what we're going to do for Christmas or what is being presented as available for Christmas it's amazing how just saying one left one available or get it now sell ends after the repeated emails when they're they're just emailing you saying hey we only got three in stock you really should buy and I'm thinking why are they emailing me telling me they only got three in stock I mean if they only got three in stock they're going to sell right you really you know me huh you know I want that this is very personal all of a sudden you get this I just think it's great that J crew thought of me before everybody else when they were down to three you know three sweaters and and so there's just something where the world is trying to kind of get us into this mode of I I need this and I need that I got to have this and I got to have that and again if I could borrow from what we wanted to say on Sunday in no way would I want you to twist what I'm trying to say as me preaching against anything we're standing together looking at something and we're and we're observing it and we're wanting to encourage one and be sure our Spirits are right something about the Christmas season despite all the the the the the lightness of the bells that are ringing that come carries with it an edge in this maybe this unperceptible uh uh tension that begins to build it that the very tension of Carol of the Bells is building and building behind the scenes and we're no longer joyful and triumphant we're anxious and angry all because of the things are being presented to us and there is a sense of jealousy and there is this sense of I need to have that I need to have this and there could be a lot of tension that's related to it and I'm not shy at all just to go ahead and talk about it and share it with you because I believe it'll be a strength to us to just be sure we're properly centered during times like this so that we don't have the disappointments that come with the wrong attitude be without covetousness brother Brown said in the sermon door inside the door he says it's in a number of places he always tell my young couples like this that happiness does not consist of how much of the world's Goods you own our happiness is not tied to how much we get for Christmas can you say Amen all right there you go getting the kids say Amen happiness is not tied to the goods that we own the goods that we get the gifts that we receive he says but it's how contented how happy you are how contented you make yourself with the portion that's allotted to you what a remarkable image that's expressed in that where there was a happiness that was found in the simple things brother Branham found happiness and his young marriage with things that were just cobbled together and scraped by and there's a way that you can find happiness in being satisfied with what you have and what will steal your joy quicker than anything is looking at what other people have and coveting after it Envy will rob you of your joy and thus your contentment so we want to be satisfied with the portion that's lauded to us he said brother Aaron this is really really a smooth way of telling your children not to get their hopes up and to be happy with whatever they get for Christmas but that's not what I was thinking of but I may be quick to draw back to this if necessary the Bible says in first Timothy chapter 6 verses 6 7 and 8 but godliness with contentment is great gain we want to gain things we want to have things we ought to accumulate we want to have the 2.0 but godliness with contentment is what is the greatest gain it is great gain to have godliness it is a great gain not only to have goddess but to be content there with for we brought nothing into this world it is certain we can carry nothing out of it and having food and arraignment let us therewith be there with content wow I mean that's a heavy statement as long as you have clothes on and food to eat we should be happy does it matter if I don't have if I'm not wearing the Jordans if I don't have the Yeezys it doesn't matter if I what if I don't have this and what if I don't have that do you have food yes do you have clothes yes well there should be a contentment that comes with that so when we begin to keep our eyes on the other things and we get caught up in the upgrade cycle we get caught up in the latest and the greatest in what other people have those are the things that begin to close in around us and begin to suffocate out our joy why because we begin to Envy after what other people have but godliness with contentment is great gain the Bible says in Psalms 37 16 a little that a righteous man hath is better than the riches of many Wicked if a righteous man has just yet a little it's better than the riches of many Wicked so take the riches of many Wicked and it pales in comparison to the little that a righteous man has because a righteous man with a little fares better is in a better position is better off than the many Wicked who fare sumptuously and who have riches these are things that are instructive to us how that to look upon others and to lust after the things that other people have steals us of our joy and our contentment why because jealousy is a Grinch hope is a Grinch jealousy is a Grinch that's number one and two number three comparison is a Grinch maybe a companion to jealousy a lot that could be said on this I found myself kind of getting lost in this study on comparison there's a lot of things that relate to this they've identified that as humans we are wired to compare that we just instinctively compare that when we think of ourselves and whether or not we're fit We compare ourselves to someone we know that is fit when we think of of our cooking and how good do you cook we immediately compare ourselves to someone that we think Cooks better than us and that we're just wired that way instead of even just kind of being objective about your own abilities and your own worth and your own looks that we always will compare ourselves to somebody that we think is better and just in doing that it brings us down it's something that we do instinctively it's something that we do as human beings and we have to avoid the urge to compare ourselves to be happy with the things that God blesses us with to be content with the things that are allotted to us and to not make the mistake of comparing ourselves to others I believe the statement is of course there's a real Rich history and trying to pin it down but there's a lot of statements to the centuries about the things that still joy and one of the things that's attributed to Roosevelt and Mark Twain and a lot of different people but I think it only came into writing in the 1980s its comparison is a thief of joy then when you compare yourself you can be very happy with something like oh my I mean listen this has probably happened with the last seven to 72 hours you give your kids a slice of pie and they're happy until they see how big their siblings I Supply is right in comparison is the thief of Joy because they're like this is wait a minute yours is bigger than mine and they were perfectly happy with what they had until they learned that somebody had something different or bigger or better why because it's something that just immediately in comparing we it robs us it steals us up it steals our joy from us Romans chapter 12 Verses 4 to 6 for as we have many members in one body this may be a unique scripture to use but it says and all members have not the same office so we being many are one body in Christ and everyone members of one another having them gifts different according to the grace that is given to us whether prophecy let us prophesy according to the proportion of Faith Paul is going to continue but what he says is whatever you have be happy with it be who you are use what you have we have gifts different according to the grace that is given to us during this time of gift giving some of us may be able to give greater gifts than we're able to receive to uh we receive greater gifts than we're able to give and one thing that gets us in that dangerous trap is trying to keep up right don't you hate having to buy gifts for people come on if we have to stop the stream and not and not archive this just so you can let loose some amens tonight it's not fun when somebody buys you a really really nice gift and you feel compelled to match the dollar price right they made sure they make sure the price is still on there and they say yeah I couldn't find anything under 800 bucks but man that's the best one money can get and and they're sure that you get it early so that you can go out and try to figure out how you can match but having gifts different according to the grace that's given us we all have different measures there's going to be things that people can do that you will not be able to do there may be things that you can do that others can't do and in doing so we've got to recognize that God blesses us in different measures and having different gifts according to the grace that's given us let us just use our gifts and be ourselves and not compare ourselves if one is given a gift to do this not compare ourselves to another person who doesn't have that gift or someone who has this gift and I don't have the comparison is something that will tear us down and wound us severely Paul recognized this in the Corinthian Church in second Corinthians chapter 10 verse 12 it says for we dare not make ourselves of the number or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves he says but they measuring themselves by themselves and comparing themselves among themselves are not wise in other words it's unwise to compare it's unwise to find yourself receiving something and then saying well what did they get isn't this not the the weakness of Peter when he found himself wanting to know well what about this guy what about John what's going to happen with John what what does he get you've told me what my fortune is what is his fortune what does his future look like and Jesus said what is that to you if he tarries till I come what meaneth that to thee follow thou me in other words Peter don't worry about what everybody else is doing don't worry about what this church is doing don't worry about how many do this and how many do that as for you and your house serve the Lord as for what God has asked you to do do it Faithfully whatever your conviction is in light of God's word and whatever he's attached you and burdened you with by Revelation Faithfully servant and desire the same for everybody else that they would be faithful to their calling that they would stay in their place that they would do the things that God has asked them to do because if you do your job and I do my job and you do your job the job will get done but when we start comparing our workload to somebody else's workload somebody's calling to our own calling and we find ourselves comparing we're immediately carnal and the job's never going to get done let alone done right because comparison is a Grinch those are just a few but I wrestled with my title today whether it was going to be the grinches or don't be a Grinch and so there are a number of different grinches that steal our joy and so what we're doing is we're identifying those things that take our joy away you can say jealousy comparison the wrong kind of expectation but just taking a little bit of a turn here as we're going to be closing soon we might be trending towards Wednesday night sermons under an hour and the algorithm now I may be saying that a little bit premature so don't mean to let anybody down if you have the wrong expectation but I really I mean this and I'll just I'll just say it to myself Aaron don't be a Grinch and maybe we could just examine ourselves by it there are ways this is becoming more real to me and by my own failures there are ways that we can steal the joy out of our own home we don't need the Grits to come down from whatever Mountain it was above Whoville North Mountain or something is it Mount Crumpet I can't remember what it what armpit can't remember the name of the mountain but it comes down from the mountain he sneaks into everybody's homes and he steals Christmas tries to steal Christmas from him but you know what it's not the Grinch from without that we need to worry about sometimes it's the Grinch Within there are ways that we personally whether it be as fathers or just parents or even individuals within a home it is very easy for us to be the chief thieves of Joy within our homes as we could relate it even to this season I think that we are the primary caretakers over our joy and that even in identifying grinches if we could just not be a grinch ourselves we're well down the way of preserving our sanctity and pervert preserving our sanity during difficult times and these are just some general admonishments but we're using this theme of The Joy of Salvation tonight the grinches I was reminded earlier today in the the poem I don't know if it's called the visit from Santa Claus but we call it the twizz the Night Before Christmas and you remember how it begins Twas the Night Before Christmas a creature was stirring not even a mouse and then everyone's quiet everything's peaceful everybody is resting right it's just this this this calmness and then what was it out on the lawn arose such a clatter right there's these things that take place that disturb our Tranquility things ought to be calm and quiet and peaceful we should be living in times we can be contemplating the things of God and we want to steal away from all the static and all the noise and all the data and all the information it's the curse of the cell phone to where we're never separated from the noise of the world the world and so there's a I'm kind of identifying that moment that time when everything ought to be quiet there Rise is such a clatter this agitation is stirring and as we say to us you know maybe it's to the heads of the households and ones don't be a Grinch in Proverbs chapter 15 verse 27 it says he that is greedy of gained trouble with his own house greed like I said greed is a Grinch but here we are in control of this this idea we have we can be be possessors of this idea that greed will trouble our house he that is greedy for gain he that finds himself pursuing the accumulation of riches pursuing the having of things the spirit of greed is one of the primary characteristics of laodicea the fear of missing out the lust for things it grips laodicea and we must not allow ourselves to succumb to its pressures his brother brother Branham identifies them the pressure the great pressure of this age and I you know you say greed is a Grinch noise noisy distractions are grinches what did they do it that robs us of our peace robs us of our tranquility and so when we when I when I admonish it this way don't be a grinch if greedy Being Greedy of gained troubles the house it tells us that the things that we pursue can be the very things that begin to deprive us of joy the very things we pursue the very things we try to grasp the very things we try to have the very things that we think and I think this is instructive to parents because I know for me I have a weakness I want my children to be happy I want my children to have I I don't like it whenever any one of them are stressed out or anxious or crying it it does something to me where I'm immediately uh worried and what do we need to do and are they okay is everything going to be all right and you've got to be very careful because that can be such a pull on you that you want to give give give give but it'll never produce the returns that you want them to have sometimes we're better off saying no and suffering the interim knowing that in the long term it will promote the right kind of things they say to us let's not be grinches where we're distracted even ourselves we're noisy the Bible says in Psalms verse chapter 1 verses one to three blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly watch how this progresses first you're walking in the Council of the ungodly and then after you've spent some time in that way you begin to stand in the way of Sinners this is progression now that you've walked in their counsel now you stand in the way of Sinners and then ultimately you sit in the seat of the scornful you arrive at your throne where now you're the critic you're the Grinch you're the scorner you're the killjoy walk not on the Council of the ungodly nor stand in the way of Sinners nor sit in the seat of the scornful but the man who's blessed but his Delight blessed is the man whose Delight is in the law of the Lord I derive my joy my expectation my delight my pleasure is in the law Lord in his law in his law doth he meditate day and night meditate means is everybody ready to put a check mark it means to ponder to think deeply upon to concentrate or to focus your thought to give attention means to exclusively dedicate awareness that there ought to be a meditation upon the things of God day and night but the blinking neon signs of this world want to take our eyes off the things of God and we look at the the bright flashy things that exist within the world the world is is flashing I'm reminded of how they say that you know raccoons like to grab a hold of flashy things uh even to the point to where there's uh certain traps I think are fabricated to where it capitalizes on the fact that they will not less let loose their grip and it'll put them in a position that once they've reached for something it'll trigger and they even say even though I haven't been able to find maybe some documentation for that they will not let go of the flashy object right they will not do it because there's there's something they don't want to let go of that thing that is shining but what I've what I'm thinking of in terms of the disappointment of a raccoon as have you ever seen the video when they got the raccoon gets cotton candy and a raccoon likes to wash their food if there's water available they want to dip it in the water and so there's this video of a raccoon that gives a lot of this cotton candy it's like oh cotton candy this is great puts it in the water what happens it disappears and immediately the raccoon's like and that's how a lot of us are going to be with the things that we're all excited about it's going to disappear like that and all of a sudden like where'd it go it's disappeared it's gone there was no substance to it but if we Delight on the law of the Lord and in the law meditate day and night to give exclusive awareness too there's a great reward in that there's a replenishment of our joy and the sermon question and answers part two say sermon but it's uh that's when brother Brown is answering questions in 1964 August 23rd in the evening this statement here was the inspiration for this series someone gives a dream and he's talking about how this person is going in the dream but this is how he finishes the answer to the question because you're just all nervous you're all worked up he says and you let one member of the family get nervous this this is this statement that inspired the entire series to me so you know that one member of the family get nervous it goes to the next member and the next member and the first thing you're all fussing and going on can I get a witness all it takes is for one to fuss and then the next one fusses and the next one fusses and then you're all fussing and going on and I say let's not be a family full of grinches let one be the blocker say wait a minute hold on we're fussing what are we fussing over let's get back to First principles what are we fussing over let's get back to the rainbow trout it says and one member of the family gets kind of upset about something it upsets the other and the other and the other and the first thing you know the whole family is upset it's a ton right it's Santa that's who it is he says it's Satan that's who's doing it one member gets nervous the next one gets nervous the next one gets worse and we're all fussing then one member gets upset over something it upsets the other person upsets the other person and it's just the domino effect he says hey it's Satan he's the one that does this and could we have some Grace on one another that whenever we all get the fuss and we can all go wait a minute we know who it is it's not you it's not me it's Satan right and put the blame on him say hold on let's not let him get the victory in our home let's not let him get the victory out let's not let him sneak into our home and steal our joy don't let him sneak in our home and and take our our joy and leave with it fussing and take our joy and leave with his stressing in nervousness this is something I think we can be very conscious of that one member gets nervous and it can have the effect of making everyone else nervous one member can be uh upset and the next you know everybody get upset but if we can't have that kind of fortitude and discernment to say wait hold on let's stop it right here don't let it go any further it's not your fault it's the devil's fault let's invite Jesus Christ to come The Giver of our joy the placater of our anxiety let him come and let him have control he says then if one member of the family rejoices let the rest of them Rejoice with it is that is that not the Cure one's fussing another one's fussing and one's nervous the other one's nervous just start rejoicing Rejoice you know the right things he said when a family rejoices and let the rest of them Rejoice with it so every one of the family try to do that wouldn't it be beautiful that's what we all try to do as family members is rejoice I know it's very easy in this day and age maybe to be critical to point things out there's maybe just a culture of of calling things out and and there's a way that we can kind of nitpick and maybe that's the way siblings can be with one another but wouldn't it be great that even if as siblings and as young people and as children within the home and parents promoting this attitude that we're going to rejoice we're going to Rejoice with one another when we see one rejoice and we'll Rejoice with them and everyone in the family try to do that remember the Branham the next evening a week later he's asked about what kind of activities should children participate in and you know what kind of associate should you encourage them to have and he's saying hey you know make sure your children have Christian friends and he says make your home nice this is uh this is kind of comes with the idea of don't be a Grinch and this this this lays within the power of the parents make your home nice make your home a place where your daughter or son will not be ashamed to bring their company before their father and mother and into their house that's a I think that's the right kind of aspiration it's the right kind of thing to desire to have sometimes we can be so austere and we can be so severe and we can be so strict and we can claim to be so religious but what we've created is the wrong kind of hostile environment within our own homes for even our own children don't feel welcome there he says but we ought to be able to make our home so nice that it's a place that our sons and daughters would not be ashamed to bring their friends to he says make home so happy that they'll plea be pleased in their home to stay there that's the kind of home that we want to create not a a den of a grinch but a happy home a happy place a place that's inviting warm and welcoming a place of understanding a place of Grace he said that's the kind of home that we ought to create make your home a place where your children are not ashamed to invite their friends a place that your children are not afraid he says and not ashamed the place that they'll be happy to remain in to be pleased in their home to stay there it said it several months earlier almost a year earlier in the message influence he said if we made home more lovely children wouldn't want to run away right in in our Instinct just to blame the rebellious teenager they don't want to obey the word of God and we don't want they don't want to come under my thumb they don't want to subject themselves to Authority they don't want a headship and brother bear said hey you know what sometimes we made church more lovely they wouldn't run away if we made home more lovely children wouldn't want to run away he says make things more for them make it for the children where they feel welcome and nice and comfortable at home we're home they can't hardly wait till they get there and that's the way home should be I'm wanting to encourage this if you want to say oh is this the is this making things Merry and bright for the Christmas season uh absolutely make a conscious effort as parents to to uh to make your home nice to make your home Happy uh to create an atmosphere an environment Where Your Children Are comfortable because he says that's the way home should be home should be a happy place home should be a place where the children long to come back to there should be things that we're doing within our home that promote this continuity and this unity and and encourages our children encourages our youth he said this is what we ought to be these are the things that spoke to me in the idea of the grinches and we don't want to be one the kill Joy the grumpy person the person who's always trying to spoil somebody else's Joy I know a lot more could be set up on this angle but I want to close with a lengthy statement from Charles Spurgeon but let me just preface it with this your testimony before your children has the greatest impact if they see if they see a a father or a mother who are dedicated to a cause that brings them no joy they'll never want to be dedicated to that cause if they see that they're faithful to the detriment of their own peace and happiness then it does not it's not inviting to them to likewise dedicate themselves and it doesn't mean that our lives need to be without difficulty does not mean we need to live you know where we're all we're always wealthy and we always can do whatever we want always vacation always have that that's not it but it's your testimony and your attitude admits the trials that God and his wisdom allows to come to pass and when we can conduct ourselves with the true joy we can conduct ourselves with hey man that's awful I can't believe that happened but you know what things are going to work out everything's going to be fine and there's this real positive attitude the manner in which you carry yourself with the faith that you express with your mouth is going to have the utmost impact upon those who are observing you somebody is watching you somebody's watching the way you act we are God's Billboards we are his advertisements and the way that we carry ourselves the way that we talk the words that we use if we're critical then it speaks of Christ if we're encouraging then it speaks of Christ there's a way that we must conduct ourselves towards not always this negative cynicism yeah maybe we don't all want to just be a bunch of pollyanna's but we don't want to be the Eeyore's either and so there's something about the joy of salvation that has to be the Bedrock of our joy that when we when we look at that we know that's something that can never be taken away from us and this statement is meant so much to me I'm not sure if it comes from one of his devotionals it sounds it may be one of the morning evening Renditions that was done by his wife says do you believe I don't have this together for you so you just have to listen do you believe that your sins are forgiven and that Christ has made a full atonement for them this is something to be asked of each individual do you believe that your sins are forgiven that Christ is made a full atonement for them now that's something to think about right we talk about the joy of Salvation this is it what is salvation sins forgiven full atonement is made you are a possessor of God brother Branham said he says that you believe and he says then that then what a joyful Christian you ought to be I love the way that he characterizes it if your sins are forgiven and you're a possessor of eternal life if Christ has made a full atonement for your sins we could say that we are therefore Christians but he doesn't just say Christians he says what a joyful Christian you ought to be there is kind of a spin that's put on Christianity where there has to be the severity and that's austerity and the seriousness and the soberness that there was smiling and being happy and even to be jovial was somehow uh an indicative of sin and not worthy not the right kind of attitude that was meant for a Christian but I love how spurge is saying wait a minute if your sins are forgiven then joyous Christians we ought to be how you should live above the common trials and Troubles of the world since sin is Forgiven can it matter what happens to you now all right if sin is Forgiven does it matter whether or not you're able to celebrate Christmas does it matter if you're paying five bucks for what used to be a 98 cents 98 cents a pound or for a 10 pound bag of potatoes you say there's things that we focus our sights on and say yeah you know what things are changing but there's one thing that'll never change and that he's forgiven me how should you live above the common trials and Troubles of the world is this not what brother Batman modest us to do when he said how shall we prove our loved for him by conducting ourselves with joy in this in the midst of the trials that he and his wisdom allows to come to pass I know there's a way that sometimes we want to let everyone know that we're really really going through it and things are really really bad and things are really really rough but listen there has to be at some point rising up of this unspeakable joy that we have inside of us who that holds at the end of the day since sin is Forgiven can it matter what happens to you now this beautiful statement that he attributes to Luther Luther said Smite Lord Smite for my sin is Forgiven if thou Hast but forgiven me Smite as hard as thou wilt Spurgeon adds in a similar Spirit you may say sin sickness poverty losses crosses persecution what thou wilt thou Hast forgiven me and my soul is glad could we say that thou has forgiven me sin sickness poverty losses crosses persecution whatever you will thou Hast forgiven me and my soul is glad this is where I find my worth this is where I find my joy this is where there is that beam of light this is where I find that in the midst of all the darkness and all the depravity God has opened up a ray of light and I don't look on this I don't look on that but I look at this light that is shining even if it is from but for a crack my soul is gladdened he said Christian if Thou Art thus saved wilts Thou Art glad while Thou Art glad be grateful and loving cling to that cross which took thy sin away serve thou him who served thee why you're glad be grateful and loving our gratitude and our loving is what's going to is birth from our joy there's times maybe someone say you say thank you for something and and they're kind of quizzed about it well did you really like it are you really happy with it well you were just being kind right but true gratitude is rooted in some sense of satisfaction since the joy I was talking to my children this evening about the title of the sermon I said what do you think this would be about they said gratitude and certainly it is for when we have found joy when we are glad let's be grateful and loving cling to the cross then he continues since Thou Art thus forgiven freely for Christ's sake go and tell the uh to others the joyful news of pardoning Mercy be not contented with this unspeakable blessing for thyself alone but publish abroad the story of the Cross we ought to still be doing this be not just contented to this unspeakable blessing for ourselves but publish a broader story of the cross holy gladness and holy boldness will make you a good preacher and all the world will be a Pulpit for you to preach in not good holy gladness and holy boldness those are the that's the pulpit the whole world will be a Pulpit for you to preach in you don't need this Pulpit this goes to a very very small audience but your lives can turn the whole world into a Pulpit for you to preach holy boldness and holy gladness and then this is the sum the statement to me that I is stuck with me from the first moment I ever read it cheerful Holiness is the most forcible of sermons not just holiness cheerful Holiness not just austerity not just severity not just applying the token not just strictness not just discipline not just saying what the tapes say but cheerful Holiness is the most forcible of sermons cheerful Holiness is the most forceful of sermons but the Lord must give it to you and that's what we must desire that's something that we could ask for Lord give me cheerful holiness seek it this morning before you go into the world when it is the Lord's work in which we Rejoice we need not be afraid of being too glad I love it if it's in the things of God that you are rejoice and then Rejoice Evermore if it is in Christ that you are rejoicing then Rejoice Evermore when it is the things of God in which we Rejoice we need not be fearful of ever rejoicing too much we need not be afraid of being too glad I cannot be too happy about the happy things he's done for me I cannot be too proud or to boast too much in the things that he's done for me that is our true rejoicing as the statement has been made there's no amount of real gold that you can ever add to the gold you have to ever turn it to Fool's Gold and so there's no amount of boast in Christ that you ever boast too much there's no amount of faith that you can have in the word of God will ever turn in the wrong kind of Faith there's no kind of rejoicing in the truth of God where you could ever be too glad and let it be sad of these things as a nervous family member an upset family member are kind of the the uh the anti to the rejoicing family member the home that is unpleasant is the anti to the home that is happy and the children are pleased to be a mean home a grinch home are the kind of homes that the children would run away from but when we make things welcome nice and comfortable it's a place that they can't hardly hate to be there and that's the way home should be that's the cheerful holiness that's the joy for Christianity that's that rejoicing faith that is attractive and let that be us in this time let people see not just tinsel and gifts and a lot of cash in the Salvation Army bucket but may they see a kind of character in this time that flash of lightning in a dark time that declares that Christ is risen that publishes abroad the story of the cross and let it be immense in the midst of our own families and amongst one another this forcible sermon a cheerful holiness oh there are a lot of grinches but let's not be a one of them could we do that together don't be a grinch I was taking suggestions for sermon titles one of them was grinches get stitches that didn't make it was going to do just the Grinch but then I thought that may just be too on the nose but let's just remember the grinches this season and purpose in our hearts that we're not going to be one of them
