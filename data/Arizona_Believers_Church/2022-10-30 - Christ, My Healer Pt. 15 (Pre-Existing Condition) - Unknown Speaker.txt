TRANSCRIPT
========================================
unless I should be exalted above measure for the abundance of the revelations there was given to me a thorn in the flesh the messenger of Satan to Buffet me lest I should be exalted above measure for this thing I besought the Lord Thrice that it might depart from me and he said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness most gladly therefore well I rather Glory in my infirmities that the power of Christ May rest upon me amen God bless you you can be seated you could tell um from our title slide that we're continuing on the subject of Christ my healer my title today is pre-existing condition pre-existing condition we might hold off quite a bit before we get to amplifying that thought very quickly or tying it in but I'm sure you can already begin to make some connections are tie into that idea of pre-existing condition we're going to recap phobia just for a few moments here and um in the last service last Sunday when we ministered on phobia we addressed the power of fear and how that the power of fear can cause sickness it can be the fear itself which is causing the sickness or it can be fear that is actually keeping us from our healing of the sickness and there was a lot of a lot in there that I was actually feeling pulled maybe just to recap and go back over but I think we want it to be a part of what we're ministering on today but just don't want to take the time to go back over a number of those principles so I trust that you're able to make that connection and your heart as the Lord would be able to do that phobia is defined as an extreme or irrational fear of or an aversion to something so it's an extreme or irrational fear or something an extreme or irrational aversion to something or someone or some situation and by that definition alone a phobias contrary to the mental state and to the the emotional state that is promised to the believer because there's some things that even if you just fear a little bit according to the word of God it's irrational it doesn't fit with the rationale of the scripture there's some things that if you fear just even the slightest it's going to be excessive because you're asked and you're told not to fear so in some ways phobia stands against everything that God promises to the believer and one of our the themes we wanted to emphasize is feed your faith starve the phobia or feed your faith starve the fear and that that's a principle that you can apply to any promise of God any kind of situation anything you're facing that you want to always constantly continually be feeding your faith in conscious that there's a lot of things that will feed your phobia the word is the only thing that feeds your faith but there's a lot of things that will feed your phobia and it doesn't have to be that if you're afraid of spiders you read about how bad spiders are you could just be feeding on things that feed the Flesh and weaken your faith and get your mind on other things and that's always going to allow some sort of fear or phobia to thrive and Jesus even mentions it in Luke chapter 21 verse 26 how in the end times men's Hearts will literally be failing men will be expiring not because of an infectious disease but because of fear and so fear is such a tremendous uh debilitating agent upon a person and job even himself says in Job chapter 3 verse 25 for the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me and that which I was afraid of is come to me his fear was bringing it to him his his foreboding his anxiety has had the ability and the power to attract the things that he was afraid of and bring it bring it right to him and so that just emphasizes again just how powerful fear is it can actually cause a man's heart to fail it has power to bring to pass the very things that you are afraid of the thing which I greatly feared has come upon me that which he was afraid of has come unto me we touched on a few different things that I think um it could be relevant to very specifically to some people but also by way of analogy or type it's applicable to all of us but Munchausen Syndrome uh where or even hypochondria where this is fear of being sick or faking an illness and you think oh well they're just pretending to be sick or they're they're afraid of being sick those mental states can actually produce physical phenomena those mental states can actually produce symptoms and they can produce use uh present things in such a way to where even doctors can be examining someone with one of these syndromes or one of these sicknesses and they're going huh this is strange and we can measure this and we can see that and we see this and we see that but unable to ever get to the bottom of what was actually causing it and they realized sometimes it's the person's mental state how worried they are how worked up they are how fearful they are or how much they want to be sick can actually cause the body to be sick that's a powerful principle isn't it and I think it's important to maybe uh uncover that for us as Believers that the power of our thought process can be causing us to present certain symptoms and God is going to say just get in the right mind right and that's going to bring the heal in that you crave and we touched on in terms of the nocebo effect kind of the opposite or the evil twin of the placebo effect but it's a negative outcome because the person believes that harm will come perhaps that's exactly how the scientists would explain um job's luck and say well job was a real person and this did happen to job but we do not believe that God ever made this uh challenge to Satan we just believe that job because he dwelled on it because he thought about it it would be the nocebo effect and when it comes to medicine that if you believe that something is going to have a negative impact it actually does have a negative impact even if there was nothing but sugar in the pill and this is where science comes to this conclusion noceba comes from the Latin to harm that if someone expects that they'll have side effects that someone expects that they're going to get sick if someone begins to think that it's going to be bad or harmful then it actually comes it's a negative outcome because of that thought process now this ties in but this also allows us to take a step further second Timothy chapter 1 verse 7. and and I believe I meant to say this at the outset I believe I'm just coming very very near finishing up this series both on a matter of Faith which has been a kind of a support to this subject of Christ my healer and Lord willing next Sunday morning we can finish up on this uh this portion of the subject of Christ My Healer and it says in second Timothy chapter 1 verse 7 for God hath not given us the spirit of fear so we have not received the spirit of fear the Bible tells us that a bondage is a spirit of fear brings bondage and it brings uh uh you could just look at all these other ways it imprisons the per person he has not given us the spirit of fear but and we could say the spirit of power and of love and a sound mind so maybe there's many different ways that a negative Spirit can manifest itself and it can manifest itself in fear or there could be a spirit of fear and it's in that Dimension itself that it can manifest itself in many different ways but the spirit we've received is a spirit of power the spirit we've received is a spirit of love and of a sound mind that self-control it means for one to be in their right senses or have to have one senses restored to them in some places it's it's actually rendered or translated to being sober to have a sound mind you're sober fear fear then is we even take it from that and Paul is bringing this contrast fear put someone in the wrong State of Mind that we mentioned last time how it's intoxicating and that fear because it intoxicates you and influences you it changes your behavior it changes your perception it changes uh the mind and the body it works just like just like alcohol or a drug it's going to intoxicate you put you under the influence and if it was a crime we'd all be guilty right of driving under the influence of fear or going to church under the influence of fear whatever it might be there's a fear puts us in the wrong state of mind so Paul touches on the spirit of power love and a sound mind and and it may be I may not be able to touch on it today but this sound mind is it's one that's sober and it's it's stable and I want to just caution it's not one that's just languishing and kind of resigned that well I just kind of give in uh but it's a it's a it's a mind that's confident and trusting because the way that we can say well you want to be in a sound mind you want to be stable you want to be sober you want to be sane and then we can say well that means I've got to accept this and that means I've got to be this way but it just means to be confident and trusting a stable mind and a sound mind is centered upon Christ it acts prudently it acts uh soberly it acts in moderation it acts in a very balanced way within the parameters of the word of God sometimes we mistake Faith as being extreme and and so we think that the louder we can shout or the harder we can run or the greater the more passionate we could be in doing certain things that that demonstrates a greater Faith but sometimes it's actually demonstrating how unsound you are in your thought process and you're trying to convince yourself and so in a sound mind be insane and sober you can you can praise you can shout You Can Dance you can worship and you can also sit reverently and believe because you're in that balanced Mind of a Christian it acts prudently now Paul kind of throws out I take that back Paul also references power and love and I didn't want to just Breeze over this but he's been given us a spirit of power which drives away the cowardice it drives away the fear it's a spear of power so it has that confidence that it can stand up to anything and it's uh it's the power and and this power and this is uh it's power and the sobriety or the soberness the soundness because in a way you think about those two if someone's very sober we we typically would think that they're not really animated someone's sober they're maybe not somber but it's sober still they're they're not enthusiastic they're very even they're very level and then on their hand is power and soberness in some ways themselves kind of present uh these these different sides of things is that making sense power and soberness and maybe there's worldly's ways that we could describe it to help but the beautiful part is love ties them together giving you a spirit of power and a spirit of soberness but then love is what ties them together because he says I've given you a spirit of love it's a balancing factor between what can be between what can be two extremes of soberness and Power and love is what kind of binds them together and kind of holds them together it's the balancing between a power and enthusiasm and ability and the rationale and the and the soberness because you could be so sober you don't act right or you can be so powerful you don't know when not to act but love is what directs those those Powers it's what directs the power it's what directs the the soberness and so with the spirit of love it keeps you in that balance a lot there to chew on now if we are sick and this is I'm gonna this is where I'm starting this is where I'm going to end today if we are sick we do not need to fear anything I can actually just say we do not need to fear anything right but in Light of Christ my healer when we are sick there's nothing about the sickness or in the sickness that we need to fear he said well brother Aaron I'm worried well your worries can be justified in the sense of rational and that makes sense any kind of human being would be worried about that or I'm very anxious about this pain or I'm worried about this and we're that's fine but as we put it in this context of fear and worry in this foreboding and the doubting with if you're sick you have nothing to fear nothing in the sickness to fear nothing in the future to fear and nothing in the treatment or the process to fear whatever it is we have there's nothing to fear in seeking help there's nothing to fear in the future there's nothing to fear in the sickness we have to have this mindset as Believers no matter how tremendous it may be how hurtful it may be no matter what the outcome may be I cannot give myself over to a spirit of fear and my I tell you what it's so easy for me to say that I could keep saying it it's that easy and the more I say it the more you might want to come up here and put my your hand over my mouth say easy right so easy to say it very very difficult to live it so if that's the case then faith and this has been kind of my personal guiding thesis faith has to be at the center of our Behavior it has to be the guiding force of our actions if it's not Faith that's guiding our actions whether to do something or not to do something if it's not Faith then we can freeze and not do anything at all or we can fight even to our harm that if it's fear we might go oh I'm paralyzed I don't know what to do I can't do anything I'm not going to do anything I'm just going to believe oh is that fear talking or faith or you you're just I'm gonna do everything maybe it's even that power I'm going to do everything I'm gonna do this I'm gonna do that I'm going to do this I'm gonna do it but is it is it balanced by love is it balanced by that soberness and that's and that sobriety is it really faith that is functioning uh to bring a person to that place of confidence that what they're not doing or what they are doing is something from the Lord we read this on Wednesday night and keep coming Juniper she's right here there you go see we just have such a close family the sermon I Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and we touched on this Wednesday night and I'm wanting to pick back up where we were Wednesday night uh again this coming Wednesday but this is it just flows it just been flowing right through brother Brown says in this you see so much when you speak of bodily healing you see a lot when you talk about healing Divine Healing bodily healing healing of the body you see so much and he says there's the motives and objectives that people seem to be so confused and wrong many times now when brother bam talks about that he talks about it from the scientific standpoint the medical standpoint from from the doctor and then from the chiropractor and the osteopath and and then from the unbeliever and everyone has a take right everyone has a take it's like that saying everyone opinions are like noses right everybody has one and mine's just bigger than yours and and so it's it's it's when he talks about it it's kind of all of us even as Believers we can put in this state of well you know what about this and what about that the motives and objectives seem to be so confused and wrong many times and that goes for all of us very easy for even those of us who are looking at Divine Healing not being sick we can have a lot of motives and objectives or ideas and opinions that are confused and wrong we who are sick and desire and healing can have a lot of opinions and ideas and be confused and so wrong and then every in the people who are practicing medicine people who believe that it's a sin you have all these different ideas and people because can be so confused and wrong many times and I believe it's the word that gives us the balance and we want to continue as we I believe we tried to do last week is expose all the shadows and complexes that keep us from our healing and and what we're really looking at when we talked about phobia and what we're talking about today is the fear suspicion doubt even just to hesitate a little bit and and and hesitation's not wrong if it's if you're being checked by your faith and I know there's just a lot to it and just recognizing the will of God and how do we pray for the will of God what does the will of God look like there's a lot of things that we can challenge ourselves with not just when it relates to our healing but daily decisions and really I think it's so beautiful that we have that God has arranged it in such a way toward the end of the day you as an individual are going to find that your faith is going to grow through those challenges because it's not like you can uh you can take a test and then just kind of flip to the back and check the answers right and be like oh okay that's what it is that we we learn as we grow and we'll do things and we'll learn that wasn't faith and and we learn in that process so that at the end of the day it's not because we have the answers printed out necessarily but because we have that Faith deep down in this inside of our hearts and that becomes the anchor for everything that we think say and do and not Church rules and not just a pastor telling us what to do and and not even just because the message has so much from 47 to 65 but at the end of the day it's it's Faith that's the guiding force that keeps us in the will of God and so we have to look at fear suspicion doubt and all those things that try to hinder our faith now in the sermon what it takes to overcome all belief all unbelief and the answer is our faith so faith is what overcomes all unbelief listen to this principle I think this is such a beautiful principle and the the the the number of things that have been upon my heart I just I was really just waiting on the Lord just to figure out as we've gone through this there's some things that kind of drop to the side another thing that kind of drops the side and I find myself feeling that I'm very very near the end and maybe I have a collection of little principles that I think could be deposited into our heart that could help us and it just waited on the Lord just to put it together in a picture that could help all of us and so if there if some of you sense that some of these things seem to be maybe just a little subset if it helps you just take it if it doesn't seem to fit cohesively into the hole I'll take the blame for that it says what about when you submit yourself to the doctor when a doctor comes and he says he has some medicine for you and you take the medicine and you say now there's no there's no negativity that's implied in this submitting yourself to the doctor but now when they go to give you medicine this is where he begins to challenge our thought process he says will you submit yourself to the doctor and the doctor says here's some medicine and he's doing this to make a point about a spiritual point but he says this is your this is what you say now doctor sit down here and you tell me what's in what's all in this pill I want the mechanics of it what's all the analysis of this pill what kind of a medical formula have you got mixed up here for me how did you get this strychnine how did they do how was that made what did it come from and who found it and where did this glycerin come from and where did all this other stuff that goes into this formula come on right that's exactly what we do now right that's exactly what we do we're already Googling it before the doctor has a chance yeah what was that again how do you spell that well my chiropractor says right and immediately we want to know what lab it was produced in Wuhan right and we're we're already very very curious about who made it where it came from and and especially what you'll notice just bear with me here that when it's coming from a particular place you do all the research you want right but then when Dr Oz says it's boom there you go right there Rush Limbaugh said right just whatever said on this one you don't even you don't even dig any further I'm just saying right come on put your shoes back on don't don't throw anything at me but it's just the way that we think sometimes I believe he's identifying this process we have in the day and age that we're living and when data and information and Analysis is all at our fingertips we can satiate that itch to want to know more where did it come from what does it do how does it work and if you think I'm throwing off on anybody here but myself you're wrong because that's how I am I want to research it right and God we trust everyone else bring data thank you brother Carlin all right that's that's the way that's the way I am I want to research it I want it to make sense verify verify verify document document document these are some of the principles and rules that I use in my profession that I that I use when I approach something I want the data and I want to document and I want to verify it and I want to do it in triplicate and so that may sound really really good if I'm trying to research a a Securities problem for one of my clients but if I get like that with everything just think of how paralyzed and defeated we can be and that's why it takes a year and a half to dedicate a baby right that's why sometimes I'll shop for something for five years and by then I don't need anymore because you research you document you run the metrics on the reviews and and yeah it might it might help someone make a decision but there's a downside to this and this downside to being analytical and trying to figure out and what you're doing is now the doctor who's making the recommendation you take away the authority from him and you make yourself the sole judge and you make yourself the Arbiter and the one who's making the decisions and I'm not saying absolutely that you've got to defer all that trust to the doctor but notice that that state that you get in where this is the way you're talking and acting what's in the pill what are the mechanics of it where'd you get this from where'd you get that from where'd you get this from where'd you get that from and brother Bram says he writes in Greek which it looked like it I'm sure he says probably he don't even know what it is know it himself he just writes it out man we could use that on doctors he says all right that's what he's been told to do but the only thing you do you submit yourself to the doctor and take the pills that's all now I'm not trying to make any point by that this is just brother Rana making this observation notice he says and if you trust your doctor chances are it'll help you now there you go that's what I was wanting to lead to is it's I think you believe you could take from this not don't take from this that well you got to go to the doctor and submit yourself to the doctor that wouldn't be the point I'm trying to make but the point that he does make is that if you do go to the doctor and he prescribes something to you and you don't trust him it's probably not going to help you but if you do trust your doctor he says chances are it will help you so notice how what he's kind of identifying is that fear and that suspicion or I can say this way fear suspicion and that doubt is not going to help but what he does say if you trust that confidence that positive attitude he says chances are it will help you what what could we what could we attribute this to or let's just put it this way what would the world attribute it to the placebo effect Maybe that even within the within medicine in the treatment that a person's attitude towards the treatment matters the way a person is thinking that beneficial effect that is produced by a drug or treatment that cannot be attributed to any active agent in the drug they say oh well we don't know why this sugar pill worked it just must be because they believed that it would work not taking issue with the strychnine or the or the glycerin or the pill he's saying that if you trust your doctor he says chances are what he does prescribe you will help remember how Placebo means it's a medicine given to please the Latin meaning to please Placebo the Placer medicine given to please than to benefit it's medicine given to make the patient happy not necessarily do actually benefit the patient now the it can be used a lot in a negative from a negative standpoint oh well the placebo effect the placebo effect and I think that there's a way that it's used and again this has been this has been remarkably balancing for me because the way I think my personal opinions on things the word of God has just balanced me completely and it's been very liberating for me to realize that I can put I can burn my soapbox right I can put up all all my uh weapons that I have trained a lot of different things and realize that that when I use I can use the terminology well that's just a placebo effect there's nothing in that at all it's just a placebo effect well that's because that's how science and Academia and that's how the the doctors and the academics look at it to try to figure out and they can't at the time make any causal connection to what's being done and they go well hey maybe there's just something we don't know that's happening in the patient or in what we've given them and they say it's just one of these things that's attributed to the thought process but that in itself doesn't need to be something that there's no value in so what they're recognizing I'll read it to you this way from the academics experts have concluded that reacting to a placebo is not proof that a certain treatment doesn't work but rather that another non-pharmacological mechanism may be present right think of just how beautiful that is they're saying that well we we can't say this they say that the placebo effect shouldn't be viewed as a failure shouldn't be viewed that something's not working but they're realizing maybe something beyond the medicine something beyond the doctor something beyond the pill is it working a person's life and a person's attitude and it actually is having an impact in some circles this is how that they've looked at it with respect to medicine and there's so many studies on this it actually becomes a little bit dizzying and they call it maybe the lab coat effect or the white lab coat effect at one time when doctors actually wore those that just in presenting that it would give this patient this assurance that somebody who is an expert is going to help me fight this illness this mysterious pain something that's happening that I have somebody on my side somebody who's an advocate who's going to look at this for me from the outside and they're going to be able to tell me what to do and if anything they're going to be there for me right from a professional standpoint to kind of help me in what I'm going through and in a lot of the literature that you read about this and I hope that you don't feel like I'm just going down some Rabbit Trail this will all just kind of come together for you uh by the time we reach the end that they even surmise that at one time given the maladies that people faced and the different techniques and remedies that they had available that the most important thing a doctor gave a patient was that assurance that somebody cared one of the most important things that a doctor represented is that I'm interested in what you're going through and we're going to help you get to the bottom of it and we're going to be there for you and it provided some Solace as from an expert someone who knew who could give you some information and they would look at this way for a long time in some ways doctors hands were tied in terms of how they could treat diseases or certain injuries or certain situations and that was the most important function of the doctor was to be there for the patient someone who cares and shows concerns can help alleviate worry it's it's one that can help alleviate fear and they actually one of the things that I've come across and I think this would be very helpful helpful to recognize this that it's one of the things that alternative remedies have against traditional medicine now or modern medicine is in in cases where you're seeking out something from the the mill right is there people spend more time with you it's more personal right they're looking at things from a bigger picture and that gives you the assurance that they care gives you the feeling that they're Mindful and so this is something that science and the practice of medicine is recognizing on a number of levels and notice how brother Bradham catches on this and he he cares do you brother Branham says and he and I for time's sake I kind of cut this out and and I thought maybe it'd be really good to read but I didn't want maybe didn't want to spill into a debate but remember I'm saying milk used to be one of the most healthy things they could recommend you and now doctors are saying don't drink it right and he's saying this in 1963 and he says this causes sinuses and all sorts of problems and doctors saying don't drink it because it used to be part of a balanced diet but if we've learned anything it's always question what's recommended right like who said you had to spend a month's salary on an engagement ring De Beers right right not the Bears the diamond company right they're the ones that said to do it how can we get guys to Shell out you know a month salary on an engagement ring well let's just put it out there in The Ether and say this is the standard who said you had to eat this sugary cereal for breakfast Kellogg's right who said synthetic sugars are bad right the real sugar Growers and then brother Branham touches on that he says and but then he brother Brandon brings it to the weakness of the person and the hybrid and these weaknesses of inner breed are the foods that we are eating for life are weakening the body which causes cancer mental troubles and all kinds of diseases is said and upon the human body because it's weakness this is dead on this this exactly works today this is exactly what they're recognizing is causing a lot of problems and and the causation of it is more complex than well if you eat sugary foods but just a social economic factors there's a lot of things um that Target and and uh and are detrimental to people who are in certain economic sectors and the diet just it just Cascades and it gets worse and it gets worse and it gets worse and so brother branham's touching on something on such a deep level that the foods are weakening the body causing cancer mental troubles and all kinds of diseases scientific destroy themselves getting away from God's plan and as you recognize the way that brother Brandon is diagnosed in it you realize that the reason why science has gotten so advanced in treating diseases is they've gotten so advanced in causing them right like we've gotten so good at causing all these maladies we had to get really good at addressing them and he says and he said let let every seed bring forth of its kind see where we're at I could go on and on our time's getting away but notice what that's doing science has brought death sickness and destruction and I saw the other day I was talking to my good friend Dr Vale sitting here and that's that where there's an article that people getting killed by penicillin and I it was going to take time maybe to look it up and try to find it I figured it wouldn't be hard to kind of find that localized within that time period he says it really isn't the penicillin it's the filth that they let get in when they're manufacturing the penicillin now that's that's enlightening as to terms of what brother Branham was identifying or even what the article might have said that the penicillin itself is great but there's breakdowns in the manufacturing process that was causing the problem and that might have been what was actually in the penicillin not the penicillin itself but the article may have referenced and maybe there's some conjecture here so I apologize may have referenced that the sloppiness in the manufacturing process allowed certain things to get into the penicillin and that was what was causing people to die not the penicillin itself and then notice what brother Branham brings it to he says it's a money-making greed scheme could it be that in the manufacturing process people were cutting Corners to make a buck as opposed to doing it very strictly and very carefully so that the penicillin can be effective they thought oh just Mass produce it just do this and just do that and he says it's a money-making greed scheme doctors giving it some time sometimes who don't even know the formula of an aspirin and their father sends them away to get a specialist in something another and don't even know how to cure a tummy ache for a kid okay that's that's pretty hard it says but what have we got greed some pull or little something and this is where I think I think that's all very relevant just to kind of enter into our our conversation they don't have hardly any more of the old-fashioned Country Doctor that used to get down and talk to you and console you and do everything no no it's he's saying now when he's looking at it and as as brother Bam's making his observations as a man and he's looking at it as a minister as a man of God as a prophet he's looking at he's recognizing these things and he could see this continuity he's saying that if you trust your doctor chances are it'll help you and I'm saying that maybe it's hard these days to trust doctors because they don't behave they don't have the bedside manners they don't take the time you don't feel like you just feel like a number you just feel like a patient you just feel like well it's all about insurance it's all about money it's all about this but he is identifying something about that old fashioned Doctor Who would talk to you and console you and do everything something about that I wish I could remember the numbers I read a book one time and it was on it was on the medical profession itself and it was the data suggested that the difference for for a doctor and for you doctors here today you could take this as a bonus that for a doctor the difference between a malpractice suit and not having a malpractice suit was something like one and a half minutes on average more with your patient something very small but they found that doctors that tended to spend more time with their patients were less susceptible to malpractice lawsuits why because the per the patient itself not even that the care was right or wrong in either case malpractice or no malpractice but the patient felt that the doctor was careful caring and concerned and took his time for the patient right and that this put the patient at ease so even if the even if it didn't work out right they weren't suspicious and doubtful about the doctor but a doctor is just really quick not taking the time doing it too fast he's the one that made him susceptible to malpractice lawsuits because of the patient's attitude towards them remember I said they don't hardly have time anymore then he says they leave God right out of the picture because they went after their own way in order to get God on the picture they explained him Plumb away he says there we are that's the danger when you leave God out when you leave God out there's a lot that goes out the window in in a lot of ways there's a trying to find just the right way to say this and that this would be a generalization you take Faith out of the picture you take even moral absolutes out of the picture you take truth out of the picture you start removing these things that relate to God and His nature and his character away there is no altruism there there is there is no I just want to do what's right for you there it's very hard to find that as a generalization and so this brother Bam's identifying and I want you to recognize some of the elements that we struggle with right whether it be well what's in the pill who manufactured it what's in it what does it do what does it do and maybe that's a sense brother I'm saying there's a lack of trust there and if you submitted yourself to the doctor and trust him it'd do you some good but then on the other side there's this idea and just how bad science has gotten how it's become a money-making scheme and how how difficult things have gone but he says where's that doctor that would take his time with you and console you and just in this short statement brother Branham explains why there's a lot of sickness the hybriding of foods the things we're eating and the things we're shoving down our gullet and and how we're filling our pie hole right these all these things are causing the sicknesses cancer mental troubles and all these diseases and so he's explaining the sickness but I believe in some ways he's also wanting to caution us against misplacing our trust that not just wholesale salad selling out to what science wants to give us or wholesale selling out to what the medical industry wants to sell us but he's wanting us to be sure that we don't misplace our trust but he's dropping back even further saying that our minds the power of our minds the power of our emotions how we are made to feel is so important in this process and I believe at the end of the day what he's identifying is who else can you trust but God peek at the time real quick just to know exactly where we're at First Timothy chapter 5 verse 23 this is a very unique scripture not reading this to launch into a debate about drinking wine or whether or not alcohol is acceptable but notice this is I think this is a very familiar scripture and it is one that's often debated but with this as a kind of a foundation some of the things that brother Brown was bringing out about motives of the people and it causes Confusion And how that if you trust your doctor chances are it'll help you and that that doctor who'll take time for you and be interested in those things just how how much it helps the person uh in their attitude he says drink no longer water first Timothy 5 23 some of you might have this memorized drink no longer water but use a little wine for thy stomach's sake and thine often infirmities kind of worded in such a way that's unique drink no longer water um the critic I've come across critics of this who have said that you know what kind of crazy person was Paul to tell Timothy to do it no don't drink water anymore and drink only wine and like that's not what Paul's saying right drink no longer water but use a little wine for thy stomach's sake and thine often infirmities don't always drink only water that's what he's saying but when necessary mix a little wine with your water for your stomach's sake and die often infirmities now Paul is making an observation about Timothy you say oh well this is Paul giving me a prescription to drink wine oh this is Paul making an observation about Timothy and I want you to catch this part the attentiveness and the care that Paul is giving Timothy Paul is a messenger to the age he's a prophet he was one can we see that he was gifted and signs and wonders given power in gifts and miracles and power of God followed him and Paul very very Dynamic and even if you wanted to just relegate him to his Circle and the people he's following Timothy looked up to him Timothy was a son to him Paul now as a prophet as a teacher one who's discipling men to preach the gospel think about all the things he challenged Timothy to do to give attention to study to show myself approve and and he challenges them even on being abstaining from things that would influence the body and there were certain things that would have been very evident in culture and in the teachings that Timothy would have been told to abstain from alcohol to be sober to be temperate to be to be of a ready mind and all these things that Paul challenges Timothy to do and Paul is affirming through his letters he's telling him now notice the attitude of Paul he says to take mix a little wine in with your water to help your stomach if it's upset or whatever may be taking place and your other the other infirmities that you seem to have so often Timothy think about what Paul is doing in this instance do so to help your digestion and and to remove any malady any disorder any sickness which might accompany it one version actually renders it this way uh use a little wine for the pain of the liver and for and for thy Perpetual disease that's one of the ancient translations do it take it from the the dye Glock in the Greek and the Arabic it says take this for your the pain of the liver and for thy Perpetual disease because it says in for thine often infirmities or the weaknesses of your body that may be occasioned by his labor that may come up because of the ministry that may come from the stress of handling the word of God he's looking at Timothy and the things that life brings them and the results that it may be taking in place in his flesh and he looks at Timothy maybe with stomach problems and headaches and all these other maladies and things he's going through and Paul says take a little wine mix it with don't just drink water only but if you need to and your stomach's bother them you have these other ailments mix a little wine in it because it would have had some medicinal purpose and had certain properties that Paul would have attributed to being able to help him address whatever it was going on in his stomach and maybe help his body not to drink to intoxication but just a little bit to address these maoris in this flesh in other words take all proper means to raise the body above these infirmities do what you need to do Timothy in order to see that you're healthy for your calling and I would say that based upon this that God commands all believers to use necessary or reasonable means to maintain Health to use means to improve health because your health matters and and and I I took uh I took the first half of the sermon I did that you know that control X and then pasted it in another document uh it was just going to be to just highlight again God the creator of this body and I want to end on that maybe next Sunday is how that God has fashioned this body and it being his we have a we have a duty to take care of it and so God is commanding us as Believers to use do means to maintain Health to improve health and even to the point where we ought to be thinking about what we eat the Bible deals with it I don't mean to get down into it a whole other area but you realize that when God gave adam Commandments in the beginning everything that he had made That Grew From the ground he says eat everything's gonna be fine why it was natural it was organic truly certified organic and and God had made the body without sin without any perversion that the body would function perfectly in this Garden of Eden diet now there's something that say we need to go back to a Garden of Eden diet well it'd be great if we didn't have post-eaten bodies all right so in this after eating bodies then God actually gives Israel a pretty detailed diet right why because God knows the body and he's concerned about our health and he's concerned about how our body functions and operates and so he's actually telling them don't eat this don't eat this don't eat this don't eat this and now if science catches up to they realize wow those are all the things that are pretty nasty right the Bottom Feeders the ones that got a lot of things that they're just eating on and it doesn't matter and so it mattered enough to God to tell him even what to cook in what not to cook in what to wash with what to mix and God was very very detailed because God commands the Believers to be conscious of their health to use what what they can to maintain and improve the health so notice the care and concern that Paul is showing Timothy and what he recommends now maybe just as drop into a side here I want to read three statements in Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever brother Brown makes this statement and he's making it by recounting the conversation he had so if you read it in the sermon brother branham's actually saying I said and this is what he said God heals by medicine God heals by love God heals by understanding God heals by care God heals by prayer God heals by Miracles the whole thing God heals that's all all there is to it he is the Healer all the different ways that God heals medicine love understanding care prayer miracles it's from these statements that I believe I may have misquoted it here recently I said God heals by kind words and it was it was from this I apologize it just came to my mind yesterday as I was reading these again that I might have expressed it that way and and so I don't I'm not trying to make any kind of stretch here at all but just to correct it these are the things that brother bam said he kills by now if I make that if I make the extension that God heals by kind words I'm not explicitly quoting brother Branham but as we read this just notice the varied ways that God does heal and the message look brother says God heals by music God heals by love God heals by medicine God heals by prayer these are the ways that God heals God has many ways of healing pins on what type that you need God has many ways of healing and the way he's going to heal depends on what you need we've mention this a lot Christ demonstrated this in his own Ministry that he approached blindness one way one time another another time he approached the leper one way one time a leper another way another time why it depends on what you need but at the end of the day he's the one that gives it and he chooses even how he's going to send it right and if we're not careful we can get cabbage down so much on it's got to come one way it's got to come one way and God knows the way that you need it healing comes by many different ways it depends on what type you need he says sometimes notice how beautiful this is and let's not detach it from first Peter 5 23. Paul writing to Timothy and saying hey don't just always drink water I know you're strict I know you want to be circumspect I know you're cautioned against all these warnings in the scripture that would pertain to a young man that pertained to us as Believers and it's not given to us as priests it's not given to us as Kings Kings and Priests of God to drink alcohol to drink wine but just mixing in a little enough may help you Timothy Paul was showing that kind of care to Timothy so easy to read over that and not realize just what an impact that would make on Timothy that Paul even cared enough to mention it that Paul even noticed it and brother bear says sometimes a little love stretched out will just cure an old sore an old place that's been a grudge or something it'll heal right over Just a Little Love a Little care remember how large those things played in our actual physical sickness and not being healed and I'm sorry and I forgive those grudges and those things it says just a little love stretched out and that's where I drew that from as far as a kind word sometimes when you feel all down and as we call it a street expression down in the dumps just put on one of those tapes that music or record MP3 and go to playing it it's not even MP3 anymore it's just Apple music it's just what plays right it's there it's just it's in the cloud Glory it says first thing you know you're getting you're Pat in your foot or your hand and it's all over then you're right up and ready to go again it's I think what we called it uh when I was young is our walk-up song right he's like what gets you amped up you're like yeah let's do this this right maybe maybe some of you have that Anthem you start in the morning right I have the tiger whatever it is but you're you're all you're ready to go right you're all yeah I'm gonna face the day get my Keurig going my music going come on honey but brother Brahms he's touching on something to me that's very very beautiful the impact of music to a person's atmosphere and feeling that's why you gotta be very careful what you are listening to you're in the car we're just gonna get this guy out of the way you got gangster Christian rap playing what do you expect but it has an impact on your feelings and your emotions and your sensitivities and he's saying just notice the impact that music can have you're down in the dumps you're all sad and you're depressed and the right kind of music the right kind of music can just create that feeling that's why a Saul had David come and play because it could drive away Spirits it can drive away anxiety and fear and brother of Adam backing up says God heals by music now how can music heal all right there's a how how can music heal well let's just try to peek into the black box let's try to pull the curtain back just making an observation based upon what we already know I'm not saying this is the exact causation but if having the right mental attitude towards any promise of God being in the right state of mind being expected being confident being trusting can cause a person to be well or fear can cause disconcerting emotions and can present themselves to certain physical manifestations in music can Center a person's mind and drive away spirits and cause them to be more upbeat and more positive then that's where healing could come from you're up ready right up ready to go again in the sermon he cares do you care remember this is where brother Branham was talking about we don't even have a country doctors anymore that'll that'll take time sit down with you science has gotten into a big money-making greedy thing in the same sermon brother Brown drops back down to this or comes to this he says we believe that doctors help people I believe that God heals my medicine God heals by surgery you realize sometimes just how much we limit God when the doctor's like hey glad we caught it we can take care of it right now with surgery you never have to worry about it again 99.9 percent of the people that we catch at this stage it's gone completely and they talk this way too they have to throw that point one percent in because the lawyers but you know they kind of throw it in there hey look this is this is done and all we need to do is go and do a little outpatient surgery and you'll be fine and you all said no I believe God's going to heal me God's like that's exactly what you need that's that was the easiest way right and God's like okay well I'm just gonna have to work with them I'll just I'm gonna meet him in their need I'm gonna help him right because I'm not gonna I'm not gonna tell you need to fear God will get you where you need to be but God he says God heals my surgery you know I believe that we ought to have this testimony as Believers that no matter what process we go through to achieve our Wellness we give God the credit I'm going to end on this next Sunday on the power of praise and what we do before healing and after our healing and it's all tied up in one thing we might just be able to go straight into the picnic praise because this is something that we can even do so well I thought you had open heart surgeon they did this and they did that yeah God healed me that's perfect doctor says got a new heart right God healed me that's what we that's where we get the glory he says God heals my understanding God heals by love just a little love goes a long way let somebody be all upset and just show them you care for them this is what happens in a relationship this is what can happen within our relationships to one another within a family and and I know the tension that begins to build within families parents to children children even to your parents I know this doesn't make a lot of sense for me to address these young people on the front row but your parents go through a lot sometimes they get frustrated sometimes things build up and if you could just be patient and kind and caring and understanding and it may be they're just having a bad day it can change everything right yeah it could change everything and that's the way that we want to recognize ourselves as adults and his parents that hey we all go through things let's be understanding let's be caring just a little love goes a long way when someone's upset just show them you care for them that's definitely one thing I've noticed that when I look back maybe on my childhood or maybe that comes something that's very present in our very close family relationships in our family of six that there's times when ju what the child needs to know is that you do care even if you don't necessarily see it the same way but it matters you care let's work through this and to kind of de-escalate that's one of the principles to try to teach in our families to de-escalate big words in our family devotion Tech techniques of de-escalation God heals by understanding God heals by love God heals by prayer and the next slide God heals by prayer God heals by miracles God heals by his word God heals whatever Source it is God heals by it that's that that's that's covering a lot toward the end of the day I'm going to give God the glory God heals by his word so now we're just we're taking this we're kind of turning around the corner to close here and and we might even just we may not even finish finish today let's just ask ourselves this question I don't want to lean into it too far because I don't want us to fall over but Paul is Timothy's having stomach problems he has these other things that may have been manifesting itself with it may have been connected to the stomach problems whether it be headaches or some other some other symptoms or conditions just asking the question just to consider why didn't Paul appeal to Timothy to believe for a miracle in this opportunity and I know maybe there's no satisfactory answer to it perhaps was it why didn't he just write in first Timothy 5 23 he says Hey and for those headaches believe God because that certainly would have been appropriate right why didn't he even use his gift of Miracles Paul hit the supernatural had been demonstrated in Paul's life why wouldn't this be an opportunity for Paul just to say hey you know what next time I'm with you I'm going to pray for you I'm going to lay my hands on you and and do uh and and anoint you with oil there's there's ways that Paul could have addressed this that would have in our minds been the superior approach and certainly that more faith-based just take God in his word just belief for your healing but Paul doesn't do that and I believe what Paul is doing and maybe if I can't say that he's conscious of it what God presents to the scripture is this remarkable balance of the pain and suffering that Timothy is going through and and what would remedy it because this is very important to bring this up and I know that I may not be treating this with as much time as we ought to have but I believe we've been taught it so much that it's just very very easy for us to begin to kind of drill down that line and go down the line pull up a lot of scriptures and quotations to support this but Paul understood the balance that we have when it comes to pain and suffering because he knew Affliction brings Glory he knew there is even something to be gained by being uncomfortable he knew there was some no matter what all things worked together for the good so Paul knew that if God allows something that there's there's this wrong attitude to look at something that is hard that is difficult that is painful that might even be a physical malady it's it can be very detrimental to have the wrong attitude towards it towards like oh this is just the devil that's going to destroy me okay maybe it's the devil but it's going to keep you humble it's going to give you greater sensitivity it's going to make you more empathetic maybe it is but maybe God is going to use it because he said he would for good Romans 8 18. I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in US there's profit and affliction I've said it before I think it Bears repeating that every suffering is pregnant with Glory whenever you are suffering know that it can only for the believer deliver Glory that in the final outcome the final product if I'm going through a struggle a trial a challenge is just an opportunity to succeed a trial is an opportunity for victory no matter what it is you realize that this has got to be pregnant with Glory that no matter what we're going through a Believer can point and say see this see this there's good that can come out of it no matter what it is I know it may seem crazy to the world but it's God's promise and it's never failed that we could look at this and say there can be or there is there is a victory in this there's glory in this there's a benefit in this and don't think for a second that Paul is just sitting there worry free pain-free you know just the beautiful physical specimen you know just one of those guys you would just Envy eats whatever he wants it looks like that right that's not Paul Paul was Paul knew what it was like to suffer he knew what it meant to be afflicted he knew what it meant to feel down so his counsel is not empty our text said it this way second Corinthians 12 7 8 9 and lest I should be exalted above measure to the abundance of Revelations that was given to me a thorn in the flesh and notice a messenger of Satan to Buffet me so guess a messenger of Satan some sickness some malady I know maybe taking Liberty with the language but many surmise that Paul was actually talking about bad eyesight that there's something physically wrong with Paul Something In the Flesh uh persistent disease a chronic injury something wrong that Paul wanted to be healed of and he said it was a messenger of Satan and it says in verse 8 I know I'm skipping a little bit of the context how that Paul so humble right because of the abundance of Revelations I had to have this messenger of Satan to keep me humble but nonetheless he's identifying a sickness a problem and ailment some sort of injury something that is bringing him low and he says in verse 8 for this thing I besought the Lord Thrice that it might depart from me what was he asking for healing Deliverance a miracle I've lived with this I've suffered with this I I don't know how to handle this the pain the injury whatever it might have been uh what whatever since it was so it was important enough and debilitated enough to where now he asked God three times that he would be healed delivered depart from me this messenger saying this Thorn In My Flesh if I could just put it this way God heal me God heal me God heal me and he said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness so Paul's attitude changes most gladly therefore I rather glory in my infirmities that the power of Christ May rest upon me my grace is sufficient it's unfailing strength my grace is enough my grace is enough to remove any barrier my grace is enough to raise you up Beyond this my grace is enough to elevate my grace is sufficient in your sickness you see a detriment but my grace is sufficient to overcome every detriment so that even to the point to where you have absolute confidence that in the present of the persistent and chronic illness Grace is still sufficient it's not even necessary that we say oh well grace is sufficient to heal it if God never heals me his grace is sufficient if I never have better eyesight if I never have if I always live with a arthritis if I always have this if I always have that I still stand with this absolute fervent conviction that God's grace is sufficient that where I lack physically where I lack emotionally where I lack in all these areas of my life because of injury or trauma or abuse or chronic illness I still believe that in the face of it his grace is sufficient if I if I'm never healed if it never departs his grace is sufficient Paul understood now this is where it gets I just love the atmosphere you've you all have been able to create today now I want to be very careful on how I say this Paul understood the primary Paul understood the primary purpose of Miracles was to catch the unbeliever's attention and do condition or predispose the believer or the unbeliever to Faith now there's some that have taken that scriptural principle that we can identify in scripture and that's they take the leap then to days of Miracles are past that God used it to establish the faith once the faith is established we have no more use for it now it's you're too late for that devil right but think about this in terms of and we've dealt with this at the very beginning of the series we deal with it quite often to keep us always in the channel of growing right not the Cycles but growing Paul understood that God used miracles to cause the unbeliever to to believe to have faith so Timothy already being a believer Timothy this is a this is I've only spend a little bit of time on it but boy if you could just let God anchor this in your heart this could be the liberty for somebody this could be the healing for somebody Paul Timothy already being a Believer already having been birthed by the power of the Holy Ghost in his soul didn't need a miracle to believe are you thinking about this Paul Timothy in his condition could have remained sick all of his life Paul and his condition persistent debilitating condition and asked God to deliver him three times they they could have remained that way and they never needed a miracle to to believe in God never needed it never required wouldn't have needed it once the soul was sealed then they believed and God knew he was real trust in the Divine Providence of God and they weren't thirsty for a miracle in order to vindicate their position in Christ they weren't thirsty for a miracle so that God would prove that he loved them they were already settled in that and the Miracle wasn't necessary for them to have any greater faith in God but what was more necessary was the affliction think about the wisdom of God it was more necessary that they suffered the illness than to see the miracle because it was more profitable than the supernatural cure think about that God and His Providence recognizes these things and sees that you might be so so desperate for a miracle and you're you're driving yourself crazy to be healed and God wants you just to trust him and believe his grace is sufficient because sometimes the Affliction is more necessary for us than the miracle my so then can I talk about the pre-existing condition for a moment established once in all the foundation for our faith the foundation for all healing is God foundation for thy feeling is faith and we all realize I mean and thanks for thanks to Obamacare and that may have been the first time ever uttered over a Christian Pulpit without some sort of sarcasm but the Affordable Care Act before that it was maybe more prominent in our minds but a pre-existing condition is a health problem before you get insurance coverage right that's what a pre-existing kitten when I said it that's what everybody thought of like I guess we're getting our insurance lesson today right that's what we all think about so it could be cancer diabetes arthritis some something that has been previously uh there's different levels to this but previously diagnosed and treated or even pregnancy is a pre-existing condition and nowadays if you get um Insurance under the Affordable Care Act insurance companies cannot charge you more or refuse coverage because of a pre-existing condition or can't provide you less treatment can I get a witness right this is what we get under the the health care act today now there's grandfathered plans the individual plans they're grandfathered in in other words plans that you pay for because you're self-employed can I get a witness and those health insurance plans are very very expensive and they'll be like look the only thing that we will guarantee is the oxygen you breathe naturally right and anything else is a pre-existing condition and they can still deny coverage because of it so in the in the in terms of treatment in terms of coverage in terms of we got you we're a partner in this sickness we're partnering with you in this illness you're pregnant doesn't matter if it's a pre-existing condition doesn't matter we're here we'll step in we'll pay we'll get you the care you need that's what it means from the natural standpoint but you've got a pre-existing condition as a believer and that's your healing you've got a pre-existing condition to any sickness to any disease that's your faith this is something that in the midst of what Paul Timothy was going through in the midst of what Paul experienced their pre-existing condition of faith is What mattered that's what held sway that's what was the most important thing for them to remember is I am a believer and I'm not thirsty for a miracle to stay a Believer I am a believer Miracle or not I'm a Believer I trust God I've Got Confidence in God and it's from that state and from that position that I'm going to believe I've got a pre-existing condition that before the world was even formed in the mind of God the stripes were there the blood was shed there was a tongue why I was yet a sinner Christ died for me before I ever came into being her manifestation that he paid the price for me there's a pre-existing condition it's his promise it's something that supersedes let me borrow something from Brother Branham I'll use a little bit different we have health assurance I am the Lord that heals all thy diseases we have health Assurance it's a pre-existing condition that means there's nothing nothing future nothing past nothing present there's no family history there's no family future there's no current state there's a place where the believer gets where they're absolutely sure that his grace is sufficient Paul says who shall separate us from the love of Christ shall tribulation distress persecution famine nakedness Peril or sword come on Paul tell me he wants to cover everything and in a minute he's going to go ahead and cover it front back sideways up and down he makes sure it's all covered he's basically saying what's going to separate you from the love of Christ what's going to separate you from that anchor that makes powerful relevant power relevant what's going to separate from that anchor that makes a soberness relevant what's going to separate you from the love of Christ he says in verse 36 let's just all be honest for thy for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are counted as sheep for the slaughter that's what we have to endure that's what we go through many are the afflictions of the righteous but does that separate us from the love of God he says nay no no no no no in all these things tribulation distress persecution famine nakedness Peril and sword all these things we are more than conquerors we're not just survivors we're thriving we're not just getting by we're conquering we're more than conquerors through him that loved us for I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord but we ought to have the right the right attitude towards the things that we endure remember this no matter what you what sickness you have sickness is not a sentence check this is never a sickness is never something that's imposed upon you put on you as a sentence it is just a state we'll hold there and come back to it nothing shall separate us from the love of Christ nothing could you believe for all things believe all things are possible nothing shall be able to separate us your pre-existing condition don't ever remember it the love of God faith the blood that no matter what you're going through now there was something that pre-existed and there's something that will be and we're anchored in the sufficiency of Christ I hope God can help you today I know we covered a lot of ground I'm just going to stop we'll leave the rest for another time may the Lord help you I know there's real needs I'm not being dismissive at all I know there's real needs but I believe this is needful God help us you love them I know you do he loves you too could we stand together today
