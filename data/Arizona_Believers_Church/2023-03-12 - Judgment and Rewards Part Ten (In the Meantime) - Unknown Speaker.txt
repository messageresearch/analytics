TRANSCRIPT
========================================
this morning as I've already mentioned as we have here on this slide on judgment and rewards part 10. in the meantime this is a conclusion of a series that has been about crowns that are available to the believer to gain there's been a lot of things taken from the message of the hour to substantiate those rewards that are made available to his faithful Saints how that God is faithful to remember all your efforts to please him and all too little time is spent in laboring for these things and so we have these things very I hope very fresh in our minds on the the subject of what rewards are and the bride's judgment for those rewards there's no condemnation because you already have the gift there's no judgment for eternal life because you already have that by the baptism of the Holy Ghost but it's your life being examined in that sunlight if as kind of as by fire to determine your reward in second Corinthians chapter 5 verses 9 to 10 we're just going to lay some Foundation this morning on the general judgment for rewards it says wherefore we labor that whether present or absent we may be accepted of him he's saying saying that I labor so I can be pleasing I want to please him I want my efforts to be pleasing to him I want my work and my labor as a Son of God and as a minister whatever capacity God may use you in and that you're called to I wanted to please him and the pleasing is so relevant because it's not just a moment of satisfaction for God but he says for we must all appear before the bhima that word there's bema the Judgment seat of Christ it gives this image of a throne a raised place the Judgment seat of Christ that everyone may receive the things done in his body receive proportionally or receive something related to what he has done in his body in his flesh in his life according to that he have done whether it be good or bad so we know that one day the elect will be gathered together to Christ all the elect all the bride through all ages will be gathered together to Christ and there will be the giving of crowns the giving of rewards and those are the words that brother Branham uses and so this judgment day of Christ we talked about this is the Day of Reckoning where we're held accountable for our responsibility and we have to answer for what we did with what God gave us brother Branham saying in many different places one day I'll have to answer one day I'll have to answer one day I'll have to answer and we realize that couldn't be white Throne judgment because at White Throne he's not answering so there is a time where we answer back to God and this is that judgment seat of Christ Paul says it in Romans chapter 14 for we shall all stand before the Judgment seat of Christ and he says so that every one of us shall give account of himself to God he's going to answer of his Works to God the comforting thing is is it when the fire in that image and Paul uses the image of a fire we can be comforted in knowing that anything we did that was wrong or any mistakes we made any would pay or stubble works of the flesh are going to be burnt up so you're not going to have to answer for lies you're not going to have to explain bad conduct you're not gonna have to explain why you did this to that person why you did that to the person that's all covered by the blood what remains is what you did for Christ this lasting Legacy of the things that you did for him your characters we referred to character development that you take with you and there's so many different places in scripture a dozen or so scriptures we could have used over the last few weeks that we haven't used we're in Proverbs it says and he shall shall he not render to every man according to his Works will he not give according to man's works it says in Jeremiah that I search the heart I tried the Reigns The Lord does to give every man according to his ways and according to the fruit of his doings this is a principle that not only applies in this life in the law of the Harvest but it applies most perfectly even at the Judgment seat of Christ where we're going to get the good from all the good that we did because the scripture does speak of the Paradox where the wicked prosper and the righteous suffer and say well it doesn't seem like he's getting what his he deserves but we're going to get what we deserve one day in the recognition the praise and the honor and glory for all that we do for Christ and it says in Revelations chapter 22 verse 12 and behold I come quickly and my reward is with me as even the Lord said unto Abraham in Genesis chapter 15 I am thy shield and thy exceeding great reward there's a truth to this coming and this revealing of himself where he his reward is with them but then he is also our reward he is who we are first rewarded with and so there's a beautiful image of him being our reward because my reward is with me to give every man according as his work shall be that's even in the summation of it what what is your work what's the body of work that you're presenting and I have a reward for those for everyone that stands before me there'll be a war reward according to his work whatever it shall be and now if you'll turn your Bibles to first Thessalonians chapter 4 as we're going to be covering a lot of ground today the Judgment seat of Christ as it's referred to in Corinthians and Romans and these different places where we will not be ashamed before him at his coming it is after the change of our body or that first resurrection or the resurrection of the dead and the change of the living it's in that season after that change and before the Millennium that we have the wedding supper it's during that time that brother random refers to the giving of crowns it's during that time that were gathered to him it's in that day of the Lord in which we're our works are going to be examined and we see in first Thessalonians chapter 4 verses 16 to 17 for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first now we are taught that this is the order of this great Rapture that will take place in the last days this is the order of the Rapture that takes place in our day then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall ever we ever be with the Lord now we see just such significant scriptural events they don't all happen at one time but there is going to be a the Lord himself shall descend with the Shout with the voice and with the Trump the shout is the Lord's a shout of commanders the stimulating crime to gather the bride to himself it is the living bread of life bringing forth the bride and we know that the shout is a messenger with a message to gather God's bride together to Christ the word this is where it's transpiring this is what we're receiving today under the revealed word and under the revelation of Jesus Christ it is him Gathering that Gentile bride to himself making himself known in the fullness of his word and and these uh and when that happens we're gathered together at the climax of all these events is a change of our body to meet the Lord in the air and it's at that meeting in the air when the rewards come I want you to keep that in mind it's at that meeting there uh after that season or in that season in this process of the first resurrection that these rewards are going to come but it's this shout we know in Revelations 18 there's a voice that says come out of her my people that you being up partakers of her plagues so this message which calls us out is preserving Us in the end time for these great promises and it's also saving us from the judgments that are to come and in Matthew chapter 25 verse 6 it says at midnight as it gives the parable of the wise and foolish virgins it says and at midnight there was a cry made behold the bridegroom cometh go you out to meet him so this cry announces the bridegrooms coming this is that is stimulating cry it's an order or command uh specifically a stimulating crime that you signal for action it's the same word that's used and there shall be a shout given it's the message that's stimulating cry that gives a command for Action what is it behold the bridegroom cometh go you out to meet him that cometh speaks of a person's arrival that means to appear to come and to be and he shall arise and when he does you want to run out to meet him you want to meet him when he's risen when he's making his appearing and he says anybody to him cometh go you out to meet him and so the Midnight Cry is a command it's not just oh he's here or he's coming but it puts the bride into action to go out and to meet him which is to go out to depart to him and so if I could say this the message Reveals His descending when he realizing brother Brandon preaches the Rapture message Everything Changes where he's he's been very very definitive and it should clear things up from souls in prison to the preaching of the seals and all the things that he says that this is the things the very things he's been looking at that the Lord himself has descended with the book open revealing himself spiritually to his elect and so this coming or this revealing is for a union right it's for the the wedding to take place it's for the United which is not had not yet happened in Prior ages the union of the bridegroom to his bride and not just so we can say that we're married and got a ring but for for a translation let it draw the rest of them from the grave and we go in a Rapture so it's in the climax of The Rapture that we're going to be changed changed in a moment in in our atoms and then gather to the wedding supper in the sky as we use those terminologies and to the Judgment seat of Christ and if I could say this just to maybe give vent to some of the things I'm studying that there there has been such a dichotomy expressed Between Heaven and Earth to where Earth is the bad place it is where evil is and then all we're longing to do is to one day disassociate from Earth and just go live in heaven and to view the two is completely separate and you want to you want to avoid hell and you want to make it to Heaven and Earth is just that Proving Grounds to determine which place you go but we're going to come back to earth one day and so there's something to realize even our time here on Earth matters so much to God because it's a spoken word attribute of his original creation and in all our longing to go home what we don't realize is there's just going to be a temporary departure from here just to come right back to it even in a way that we can say this is home and there's just a process that it's entered into itself to put into the condition that it'll be for eternity and so we will go we will be gathered together to him to meet him in the air and we see even what the things that are going to unfold even to bring us back to that eighth day but my title is in the meantime that means that's when you're if I could say this way considering what has happened the the events that have transpired in our day whether we're looking at first Thessalonians 4 uh Luke 17 30. Revelations 10 1. we can see all these things that have happened today uh and what has happened and what will be in light of the fact that one day I am going to have to stand before the Judgment seat of Christ and I believe this theme has already been very very clear that in all the places that Paul is speaking about Behavior he refers to that you may be found unto praise honor and Glory that we not be ashamed before him at his appearing and that we can have boldness in that day of judgment there's all these things that he says to give character give a little bit of color and context our conduct here say oh well we all got the Holy Ghost we're all just kind of waiting and doing a bunch of pandemics and economic Cycles until the last Soul comes in and then we can all get out of here wrong Viewpoint right wrong Viewpoint there's uh there if in light of what has been and what will be especially beyond that change of our body how should we live what ought our vision to be to the phrase in the meantime means the time between two things or the time before something happens and so being sealed as we are and knowing one day that we'll have to answer to him as we will what do we do in the meantime how ought we to live in the meantime I'd like you to look again at Hebrews chapter 10 we're going to walk through verses 30 to 39 we'll be jumping in and out of it as we go hopefully we'll make a little bit better time but this is a scripture that speaks to this concept of judgment and Rewards and I believe provides us a framework to address the mean time for we know him that hath said Hebrews chapter 10 verses 30 to 39 so I've noted that we'll be going all the way to verse 39. we'll jump out of this a few times to refer to other scriptures for we know him that hath said Vengeance belongeth unto me I will recompense meaning I will repay I will re-render I will reward this is a character of God he says and again the Lord shall judge his people now Paul is bringing judgment and rewards into view and there is a Vengeance that's going to take place on the wicked there is a reward that we could say that they have but also God will recompense and reward his people and He will avenge his elect he will vindicate them he will judge them but Paul is bringing the idea and as we read this you'll see that it certainly uh unfolds this way he's saying that the Lord rewards and the Lord will judge and so he can even say the Lord is going to judge his people he judgeth among the gods he is there as an authority that's going to judge among his people to determine rewards so Paul is bringing rewards and judgment into view and then he in the next chapter Hebrews chapter 11 verses 24 to 26 by faith Moses when he was come to years and I'm using this to give um some more understanding to when he says I will recompense the Lord shall judge his people and He will reward he will recompense he's going to use in the next two chapters an example of how that things happened in this life and there there's a reward for it by faith Moses when he was come to years refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter choosing rather to suffer Affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season uh very uh weighty very heavy sentence there in verse 25 he would rather suffer in this life if it be just for a season not worrying about the pleasures that he could have achieved in this life so he's bringing himself under subjection to the will of God in verse 26 is what gives him this motivation esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt so just the reproach meant more to him than anything the world could offer him and and so what the world could offer he says look I'd rather be uh Associated and and be reproached with the people of God than to have everything you can give me and that's enough and it says for he had respect unto the recompense of the reward the price that he was paying pelled in comparison to what it would purchase the suffering with the with the reproaches of Christ where there was greater Treasures in it it had greater purchasing power for he had respect he appreciated he valued the recompense of the reward what he stood to gain the value of the reward his brother Matt says uh far too little time is spent laboring for the rewards of God we don't esteem it and respect it enough we don't value it enough and and this is coming back to Moses's attitude he's saying he knew the reward was coming so whatever he did in this life he considered it purchasing power and he considered it equity for the rewards that were to come and he and it's even to be said that man what I have to pay in light of what I get small price that's one way we ought to think about him then it says in Hebrews chapter 12 verse 2 looking unto Jesus the author and finisher the Perfecter the completer of our faith so there is a beginning and there ought to be a finishing who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross so it was what is after the cross that he was looking to he wasn't looking to the few days of fun that he had with the disciples um it wasn't just the meal that he had before he was put on trial then crucified it's what comes after the cross and he was able to endure the cross in light of what would come after the cross so he could despise the shame before the cross and suffer the cross because he knew he'd be sitting down at the right hand of the Throne of God so in both instances Paul is using Moses and now Jesus Christ to show that the reward that was to come inspired them that there was a promise of a reward that comforted them there was the promise of a reward that stirred him up that in the dark moments in the Deep trials Moses knew that there was a reward there was going to be a payoff that for Christ he knew this life it paled in comparison to the glory that he would not only have with the father but that would be shared with you and these things became inspiration I want you to be able to recognize when he says I will reward I will recompense when the Lord judges his people he amplifies that with Moses he amplifies it with Christ and so verse 31 as we come back to Hebrews chapter 10 verse 31. he says it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the Living God he is just sad that the Lord shall judge his people and so now as he kind of gives us this perspective he says and it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of a living God to fall under his displeasure to fall into the hands of living God means too it is a fearful thing to displease him it's not merely just carrying with it the uh the idea that oh you're going to be punished you're going to be judged but if we're going the Lord is a rewarder and we're going to be God is going to judge his people and it ought to be and it is a reverential thing that we would not displease him the Lord shall judge his people in other words Paul is saying this judgment is to be respected there should be a reverence for this time there is this that we ought to have this Consciousness that the Lord is a rewarder and he will judge his people and it and and it's a fearful thing to know that I could stand before him who's redeemed me who gives me this this blessed Holy Ghost who's done all these great things for me it's a fearful thing that I would fall into his hands and displease him so Paul Paul then as we go to verse 32 he both Comforts and encourages them with respect to the meantime in other words we're gonna God's Gonna judge his people and it's a fearful thing that we would displease him and so he's going to both Comfort them and encourage them with respect to the meantime because now if if they hadn't known before and say hey did you know even though you're filled the Holy Ghost you're gonna have to stand before Christ one day and he's going to examine you for reward and we might be like oh oh oops right and Paul says well but I don't want you to give up now and say man it's way too late in the game for me to even start trying I might as well just give up he he Comforts them about that moment and he's encouraging them he says but call to remember it's the former days in which after ye were illuminated or quickened after you came to the knowledge of this truth he endured a great fight of afflictions and what does he talk what is he wanting him to think about God will judge his people he will recompense if you've suffered he'll pay you and and going forward in the meantime be conscious of this but also remember these are things that you have done these are things that God has noticed these the fight of afflictions partly whilst you were made of gazing stock both by reproaches and afflictions and partly while she became Companions of them that were so used so you yourself suffered reproaches and afflictions or you ministered to those who were in some ways maybe that's the that's the cycle that we can always be on we're either helping somebody who's Afflicted or we're being Afflicted and maybe our afflictions ought to teach us how to deal with the afflicted and he says and for ye have compassion of me and my bonds and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods you gave of yourself you opened yourselves up you served you ministered not only have you endured the fight of afflictions and been made a gazing stock by reproaches and afflictions you were a commit companion to those who were fighting afflictions and became a gazing stock by reproaches and afflictions and he says and you had compassion to me in my situation and took joyfully the giving of yourself the giving of your resources and your assets the giving of your goods to support me and as they gave they were conscious of what knowing in yourselves that you have in heaven a better and an enduring substance this pertains to our inheritance this pertains to our reward which will come in the Hereafter these are the things that we stand to receive we're not waiting to get eternal life after the bodies change we're not waiting to get the Holy Ghost after the body changed but there are crowns to be gained there's rewards to be won and he's saying in heaven you have a better and an enduring substance you've spoiled your goods here for the cause of Christ but there's only something uh proportional being gathered laying up Treasures in Heaven that is a more enduring substance that rust cannot corrupt and the moth cannot destroy that no man can still that's been gathered into heaven and Paul is recognizing to them that any labor without a reward is bondage and that any labor without without enjoying the fruits of it is a burden or a strain that if we labor and do not enjoy the fruits the Bible is very clear that that's burdensome if we labor and we do not receive the rewards of it that's bondage God recognize it there's a there's a principle in human nature even in Ecclesiastes it's good for a man to to work and enjoy the fruits of his labor in other words it's bad for a man to work Time After Time After Time and not get to enjoy the fruits of his labor the very reward for the one that sows is the Harvest the sower uh has the reward of the fruit of the seed that he sows and so it's the fruit that's going to come up after this laborious process that is his reward I labor i i a plant I water I grow I I fight with the ground I do all these things to cultivate and his reward is to enjoy the fruits of his labor if not it's servitude right if there wasn't payment if there wasn't reward if there wasn't something given then it is merely bondage and a strain and Paul's recognizing that so verse 35 he says cast not away therefore your confidence which hath great recompense of reward it speaks of that word recompense of reward it's payment of wages due cast not away therefore your confidence which have great recompense of reward brother Brown says the recompense of God is too lightly esteemed Paul may very well be saying in such a way to say you don't esteem the recompense of God more enough that it recompense or those Eternal rewards of God are too lightly valued it's a fearful thing to fall into the hands of living God in other words you don't esteem the recompense of God enough you don't think enough about how awful it would be to displease them or how how much you ought to uh you want to present things to him that he's happy with if I could put it that way you just don't want to let them down there's so many different translations I read I want to read just from a couple other places this phrase cast not away therefore your confidence which hath great recompense of reward do not therefore fling away your Fearless confidence for it has a glorious and great reward notice the forward-looking future looking uh concept of whatever my confidence is in the days of My Flesh there's a great recompense for it what was for Moses there was for Christ in the living Bible do not let this happy trust that's that Fearless confidence this happy trust in the Lord die away no matter what happens remember your reward Paul is intentionally using a language to say that what you suffer here what you labor and hear what you do here we ought to never trivialize and keep your confidence up keep your commitment up your fortitude up do what you know you ought to do because God is a rewarder and that we ought to esteem it we ought to recognize it's a fearful thing to displease him and that the recompense of God is too lightly esteemed he's presenting that before us and he's saying then cash not therefore away your confidence which is your freedom it's not just necessarily A boldness or maybe a disposition that may be confused for arrogance but it's really speaking about a liberty to act and live as you ought cast not away therefore your Liberty cast not Therefore your your freedom to do as you ought I I don't be unrestrained in living for him that's where so it's you've been set free you've been liberated your sons and daughters of God you are not Bond servants you are not orphans trying to win God's favor you are not uh Beggars at the foot of the cross you are his children that he has this whole Plan of Redemption was for you they in everything that he's done we say oh and everything we see Christ well you only see a Christ because he wanted to have a bride you only see a Christ because he's a savior and he wanted to save somebody so if there's a Christ there has to be a redeemed that Christ redeems they said oh I see a redeemer in every verse I see a messiah in every verse if there was never a you the Christ means nothing the Redeemer means nothing and so this confidence is your freedom to live unrestrained for him to be at Liberty to please him to serve him with everything that is in US cast not there far away your freedom he's teaching us and elsewhere to to not use our freedom for the wrong things why because in this Liberty that we have in Christ why not use it for the good for and then verse 36 again I believe this is just emphasizing this all the more for you have need of patience that after you've done the will of God you might receive the promise it's not the Holy Ghost it's the promise of the reward the promise of recompense the things he uses Jesus and Moses as an example of the next chapter he's going to use uh the the the the faith and he's going to use this these examples that we can see in these uh and these in Moses and Jesus that the reward meant something to them so he says you have need of patience just like Moses said just like Christ had that you might receive the reward the recompense in James chapter 1 verses two to four my brother counted all joy notice how parallel this is to what Paul is teaching when you fall into diverse Temptations this could be used of the reproaches and the afflictions and if you say no that's Temptations and I've got a lot of them and I'm counting it all joy uh it assumes the resistance there too it says brother count it all joy when you fall into diverse Temptations knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh patience and remember it's that Faith which is more precious than gold and Peter said even the the faith is more precious than gold and the trying of it is more precious than gold it says but let patients have her perfect work that you may be perfect and entire wanting nothing I hope that the sermon on character development gives us a little bit more context this is a full age and it's even saying let it have its perfect work there's a yielding to this then that I can get in the way of it I can stunt the maturity and the growth of this word there's things I can do that can ask you the manifestation and the expression that there ought to be of this life that's inside of me I let it have its perfect work that you may be perfect an entire lacking nothing for completeness that means if there's a potential I mean it if there's something that I can earn as John said a full reward a full inheritance legal possession in other words let patience have the perfect work and if you yield and let patients have a perfect work in you then this process of character development this process of resisting temptation this process of suffering is working for you a greater weight of glory in that day that you receive your acknowledgment and your Commendation from the Lord let it have its perfect work that you may be perfect an entire one to nothing I'm going to leave nothing behind he have need of patience Paul is saying the Believers already illuminated It's Quickly quickened the soul has been sealed but he's saying there's more to labor for there's more to look for to gain in your life that yes as the Son of God I'm not born a fully mature man on the day that I received the Holy Ghost I'm I'm positionally placed in the body of Christ as a son yes but now I've got to grow to maturity and let patients have a perfect work for you have need of patience that after you've done the will of God that that doing the will of God then speaks to my life's ambition I know the will of God for me I want to I want to do the things that please him that you might receive the promise quickly I just want to reference I just allude to it I don't have the side here but in Matthew Chapter 13 where he gives the Jesus gives the parable of the sower and the word seed fell on different grounds different types of ground in different conditions and one is it's good seed and ground that otherwise would have been good ground but the ground the other things in the ground choked it and it didn't it did not bring forth fruit unto perfection but then Jesus refers to the good ground and in this good ground the word is sown and you find this in verse a then also in verse 13. and in that good ground is the word which is sowed and in that ground it brings forth what some 100 fold some 60-fold some 30-fold the ground the good ground with good seed brought forth to different measures and and you can find a great principle this in the Old Testament and what these measures would meant and so it speaks to varying degrees of fruitfulness it speaks to varying degrees of development and and the yield that one ought to bring same ground same word different yields we're all good ground and we're all feeding on good word then what I want to do is Avail myself to the process I'm just going to take Paul's word for it I have need of patience that after I've done the will of God I might receive the promise I'm going to take James word for it that I have need of patience to let patience do its perfect work that I may be perfect and entire wanting nothing that I should bring forth and all the young people said uh handy right bring forth a hundred fold that's what ought to happen is I want to bring forth the hundred yeah as they as the song was brother Philip you might know it a 99 and a half just won't do that's what I'm striving for trying to make a hundred that I wanted I want it all I don't want to leave anything behind it is it Pokemon where it's catch em all or something like that is that the phrase somebody has a bumper sticker or a tattoo of that uh did you want to have that kind of ambition and that mindset I want to get them all and then he says then bring us right bring us right back in to verses 30 to 31. the Lord will recompense the Lord will judge his people it's going to be a fearful thing to stand before the in the hands of the Living God so it kind of steps away and says but listen you're doing good look at all the things you've done keep it up don't Cast Away your confidence keep doing what you're doing you're doing the right things because what you need to do is to endure you need to be patient you need to be persevering so that you continue to do the will of God and receive the promises that I'm talking about and so he brings it right back into the rewards for yet a little while and he that shall come will come and will not Tarry a judgment time where Works will be examined a time when the Lord will judge his people and recompense Paul says in First Corinthians chapter 4 verse 5 therefore judge nothing before the time until the Lord come who will both bring to light the hidden things of darkness and will make manifest the councils of the heart and then shall every man have Praise of God this speaks of a time and examining time that we should judge nothing before it's times you should not look in a field uh if you're looking at any field we want to believe that it's good ground with good seed and that our objective even with our children and maybe objective in Ministry is to never question the quality of the ground and always preach good seed so you got good ground you got good seed and and therefore you'd have some sort of stewardship to see that the ground is free of those things that would choke out the life and keep it from bringing a hundredfold but don't judge it before it's time don't say oh you're just a bunch of 30 percenters you're lousy no good 30 percenters you're leaving 70 percent on the table I might as well just quit and go find somebody to bring forth a hundred no judge nothing before it's time but then the Lord's going to come and he's actually going to judge the hidden things the councils of the heart the motives and objectives and their things and the circumstances in a person's desire and you may be able to admiring your bushel but you could have done a lot more with what you had than what this person did over here you ever think about it the woman that gave two mites that says she gave all he says she gave more there's a lesson in perfect love in that he's going to manifest the councils of the heart and then shall every man have Praise of God I love that I take great comfort in knowing that he saved me by his grace and he's preserved me by the same and I will stand before him one day and he will praise me but I don't want to leave any Praises out to be founded to praise honor and Glory I want to have a lot of crowns that I can give them on that day when the saints crown him brother Branham brings this in because there's an end time application to this as the Dark councils of the hearts are being made manifest he says in the church age book do you know that he's revealing the heart secrets of men and women in the age in which we are living who else could reveal the secrets of the heart but the word himself and so this is a an aspect of judgment now and reward now the wigged one judgment the son of man Ministry there's judgment now but there's reward now I am thy Shield an exceeding great reward he says and he quotes from Hebrews chapter 4 there in that ellipses he's quoting from Hebrews chapter 4 verse 12 how the word of God is sharp and Powerful it is the word it is performing where unto it was sent for it the word is full of power it is the same spirit that was in Jesus the word that is present again in the church in this last age as a last sign trying to head the people off from judgment for they that reject him the word are now already come into judgment crucifying him afresh and so the word is judging us presently now and you are either accepting the word and going into this under the Specter of judgment crucified him afresh or you're being judged worthy of himself a great reward a bridegroom these things are taking place now for a little while this judge is going to begin a judgment as Paul is saying verse 38 now the just shall live by faith will just shall live by his faith is what the Old Testament says but if any man draw back think of this the context for ye of need of patience keep going keep going so that you can receive a full reward and he says now the just shall live by faith but if anybody any man draw back my soul shall have no pleasure in him if any man will shrink back retreat in other words lose confidence therefore displeases God he loses rewards wasting rewards because he says my soul shall have no pleasure in him but we are not of them who draw back unto Perdition but of them that believe to the saving of the Soul so the one that does not shrink back a retreat and displeases God that's the one that preserves his reward that's why he says we're not uh we don't draw back under Perdition that prediction means to be wasteful means to ruin or to suffer loss the loss of money is a word it's actually used for in another place so we we live by faith and we will not draw back because if we draw back that displeases the Lord so we are not like those who are going to stop short and be wasteful we are not those who are going to stop short and lose anything we cannot be sons of Perdition as was a Judas but we can be prediction be given to Perdition in that we waste available opportunities that we don't labor for the Eternal rewards that are made available to the faithful Saints to the saving of the soul that means they obtain the saving the obtaining of the purchase possession to receive one's property of the soul that which the soul merits the fact that I am a Son of God by the Seal of God has merited me an heir of God it has married me joint heirship with Jesus it is given putting me in line to receive a great inheritance and therefore I am one that believes and I follow faith and I live in quarterly that I might receive the fullness of the legal possession of what his duty Paul says where is the the Holy Ghost which is the earnest of our inheritance until the Redemption of the purchased possession under the praise of his glory that's what the saving of the Soul refers to but the just shall live by faith in Hebrews chapter 11 verse 6 but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him this is Paul revisiting that we have need of patience that we ought to not draw back that we should live by faith forward movement not drawing back to be wasteful but to believe and to the approach the full possession of the Soul for without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh the God must believe that he is and he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him if I could say this seek to please him this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased this announcement at the Jordan River this uh brother Branham takes that opens it up in whom I'm well pleased to dwell but now on Mount Transfiguration which is the same theme of hear ye him right Mount Transfiguration adoption in all those 19 different places that he preaches that sermon titled that way hear ye him he adopted his own son that day and it speaks again of his pleasure in his son and he is a rewarder of those that seek Him seek to please him rewarders of those who understand it's a fearful thing to fall in the hands of the Living God these are the things that's being represented in this scripture brother Brown says well before I go forward in this there's more to this verse than we realize I think I'm going to come back to it here in a moment there's a there's a beautiful mystery in each age presented here a principle of God and so we ought to have respect for the recompense we ought to have reverence for the reward that the reward that he has promised us you have need of patience that after you've done the will of God you might receive the promise that you might receive the payout and the payoff for for obeying God and brother Branham says each message to each age holds out an incentive to the believer encouraging him to be an overcomer and thereby rewarded of the Lord so every age everyone's recognizing this in every age there are rewards for those who have received the word for their day and have pursued Christ that have received the word for their day and through this patience constant steady heart have brought forth fruit unto Perfection there are rewards for those who've received the good seed the word into good ground and have brought forth 30 60 and 100 fold in every age the message now this is the part I want you to zero in on the message for each age in itself holds out an incentive as it says in Revelations 2 chapters 2 and 3 that there's a reward for the overcomer that means that for there must be there if there's a labor there's opposition there's difficulty there's labor overcoming labor opposition difficulty there's a fight I'm going to labor but if it's labor then there has to be a reward or it's bondage so in every age he gives a reward an incentive is the expectation of reward that motivates effort or inspires action in every age the message holds out an incentive or a reward to motivate effort and Inspire action every age has its own incentive it's not a repeat of the reward of the prior age but each message holds out an incentive and this is where I'm wanting to bring out just another aspect of rewards because in the meantime I think we ought to be we ought to acknowledge the incentive or incentives we ought to be recognizing in the meantime what I'm laboring for and so each message holds out an incentive that encourages us to overcome and when we overcome or rewarded in Matthew chapter 10 verse 41 we looked at these verses and how that Jesus in each instance recognizes that the the pure motive is not necessarily the reward but because it's due that if we do things because we're thinking well if I just do it I know God will bless me but we're not doing it because it's the will of God then there's a vacuum there's something missing you cannot take the Christ and the grace out of it and just try to achieve some form right but notice it says he that receiveth the prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward and he that receiveth the righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward here's the key to the meantime it can be very very specific here for the next several moments he that receiveth the prophet in the name of the Prophet shall receive a prophet's reward and when I first ministered all this a number of years ago God had inspired something to me and I was studying it studying and in my mind God kept bringing me back to this quote where brother Brown answers what this reward is and I and I read it and I'm like uh well my inspiration isn't tracking that and so that I felt like maybe this is a barrier to me or a boundary that maybe maybe this isn't the this isn't the real inspiration you have to check that sometimes to find out whether or not be of God and so there was I I just kept being drawn back to it drawn back to it and I felt very inspired to preach on the subject and so convinced the point where I was like I'm just going to go ahead and take this quote and I'm going to use this quote just to acknowledge it and say this is the truth this is exactly nothing changes here but bring this other principle out of the message and this is the quote that kept coming to my mind he that receiveth the prophet the name of the Prophet shall receive a prophet's reward and it says he that receiveth the righteous men in the name of righteous men shall receive a righteous man's reward but focusing on a prophet's reward brother Brown in August of 1964 is asked brother Brandon if you have time please explain Matthew 10 41 I would like to know what is a prophet's reward and I love it I'm just going to embellish it this way the person's thinking if you have time because this has got to be a really big answer right if you've got time maybe you can get that tent you've been wanting to get and do about 30 days on this because I would love to hear the answer and brother Brahm says a prophet's reward is to be a friend with a prophet done right that's it he just answers it and so that they want to know what a prophet's reward is is to be a friend of the Prophet that's a reward he's your friend very simple very straightforward but you'll recognize that as the brother about him answers this question this is a mouthful that when he says this because it's not just flippant but if you receive a prophet in the name of a prophet he's actually answers he's a friend he's actually bundled up a great mystery in this very simple act uh uh answer the reward of a prophet is to be a friend of a prophet and so in John chapter 15 verses 14 and 15 this is how the Lord began to deal with me you are my friends if ye do whatsoever I commend you henceforth I call you not servants for the servant knoweth not what his Lord doeth but I have called you friends for all things that I have heard of my father I have made known unto you so notice these two prongs to a scriptural friendship you're a friend if you do what you're commanded to do and if secret things are shared with you so these are the characteristics of a scriptural friendship you're obedient to what you're what's taught and you hear secret things you're obedient to the things that the prophet says and the prophet reveals to you Mysteries and so this is what a scriptural friendship is when brother Benham says oh when you receive a prophet in the name of a prophet you receive a prophet's reward to be his friend he wasn't just saying you can be his buddy you can be his pal you can go fishing you can go hunting you can Pat him on the back and say oh my my buddy you're such a good friend but he's saying that friendship speaks of something else brother Brown takes it says he said I call you my friends and a friend tells his friends all things this is what brother Branham is bringing out this a friend calls you I call you my friends and a friend tells his friends all things so if you receive a prophet in the name of the Prophet the benefit of that friendship is now he is sharing with you all things and you can receive what he says you're not suspicious you're not running him down you're not castigating this character you can receive from him says in James chapter 2 verse 23 and the scripture was fulfilled which saith Abraham believed God and it was imputed unto him for righteousness and he was called the friend of God this he was called Abraham was a friend of God because he believed him and God spoke to him God walked with him they did not say it of Moses that God spoke to Moses face to face as a man with his friend and so a reward for receiving a prophet is embodied in friendship and this kind of friendship scriptural friendship and aren't you glad for that because none of us could be his buddy we're actually to the point now where not many are even of the age where we could have been even if we had the opportunity if we are alive during his time we can't be his buddy we can't be efficient pal but we can be a scriptural friend we can still receive a prophet in the name of a prophet and receive the reward of friendship which then begets The Obedience to what he taught and the receiving of the Mysteries that he brought and so when you receive a prophet in the name of a prophet the prophet that we've received in this hour is that of the spirit of Elijah and Malachi chapter 4. and it tells us that a kalijah comes before the great and Dreadful day of the Lord before the Bible says the Wicked with the righteous walk out on the ashes of the wicked and so the ministry of Elijah is the the spirit of the prophet and I want to use the the ministry of Elijah to see the incentive that this message holds out to the believer today because each message holds out an incentive to the believer encouraging them to overcome now this message was more than just the rebuke to laodicea and the promise to the reward the overcome of laodicea there was a message that even followed that and so let's look at the ministry of Elijah in First Kings chapter 17. I'll read verses 12 to 16 but let me just set it up for a moment this is Elijah and the spirit that he has on him is going to be used five times in the scripture and and it's called the spirit of Elijah it's not the man but it's the anointing and the ministry the characteristics of his ministry that he had and there's a Great Famine in the land and after the brook has dried up he comes to Zarephath the Bible says that the Lord had commanded a widow and we where we pick this story up the Widow of Zarephath is getting ready to die along with her son and in verse 12 she said and Lord thy as the Lord thy God I liveth because he asked for a cake he asked for some meal and he says I have not a cake but a handful of meal in a barrel and he'd asked for water previously and a little oil in a cruise and behold I'm gathering two sticks that I may go in and dress it for me and my son that we may eat it and die so death is what's next Elijah said unto her fear not go and do as thou has said but make me there of a little cake first and bring it unto me and after make for them for thy son for thus saith the Lord God of Israel the barrel of milk shall not waste neither shall The Crucible oil fell until the day that the Lord sendeth rain upon the Earth and she went and did did she receive a prophet in the name of a prophet yes because she went and did it's not to have a roommate not to have a buddy not to have a companion she went and did according to the saying of Elijah and she and he and her house her son did eat many days and the Bible says in the barrel of meal wasted not neither did the crucified oil fail according to the word of the Lord which he spake by Elijah so it wasn't just Elijah it wasn't just a hungry man's request we're trying to get into a psychology well he's been down by a brook talking to Ravens for a long time and he's a little bit hungry and he's a little bit scatterbrained and he doesn't know this was the utterance of God this was an unreasonable demand this is now God speaking by Elijah fetch me some water she goes to do it make me a cake she says you know what I could get you some water but I only have enough meal and oil to make a cake for me and my son and they were going to die because death is what's next and he speaks a message to her he says listen you make me one first then you make one for you and your son and I promise you this is a promise if you do what I said you'll have all the oil needs you have all the meal you need sometimes we whine and complain about the word sometimes we want to complain about the anointing well are you doing what you're supposed to do because this message has unlimited meal in unlimited oil and she went and did what he said and it wasted not and it wasn't Elijah but it was by according to the word of the Lord which he spake by Elijah so even in this we can see of incentive to the believer because this is part of a prophet's reward provisioned during a time of famine this is the part of Elijah's reward that if you receive the spirit of Elijah he feeds you during a spiritual drought when you receive the message of Elijah when you receive him and you obey what he says and you follow his precepts then you are walking in a pattern where he's going to give you substance during a famine where it will not run dry it will not run out and so the word of God from Elijah is embodied in that meal in that oil and then her receiving it this is the other part I want you to catch she testified death is what's next and think about the whole picture what intervened a woman's going about her day and it's appointed unto her to die her and her son she knows it's certain and Elijah Elijah walks up with a message that if she receives bypasses death takes that certain death and pushes it away because she went and did what was she doing she wasn't just labing for herself she was laboring for the Lord because she provided for the servant first she was spoiling of her Goods for the servant of the Lord she was doing what Paul was saying in Hebrews chapter 10. you've spoiled your goods from my behalf you've given of yourself don't Cast Away your confidence because it has great recompense of reward and so she was laboring for the Lord and what did God do he rewarded her for that because she gave him the first place she didn't say well I'll tell you what I'll make one for me and if there's any left over I'll feed you she'd abandoned herself to the cause and was willing to suffer the consequence knowing that's a fearful thing to displease the Lord and so the reward God rewarded her by preserving her and her son but if you continue reading in verse 17 after this great intervention The Widow's son dies and you can imagine the test that this must have been to her faith and how that she would say oh well I you know we were just scrounging around in the world and we were just trying to find sticks and we had just a little bit of milk a little bit of oil and it was just a famine but you know the ministry of Elijah came and brought a message and it started to feed us and we fed many days and it was awesome and our whole family was serving God and everything was great and everything's wonderful then a test came and you could just imagine how her neighbors might have been sitting there on the fence saying yeah so what did Elijah do for you again tell me all these great stories like some good it did you because now your son's dead right she bragged about the prophet bragged about the message bragged about what he'd done for and now I'm sure her test her confidence is tested in Elijah and it's expressed in even her interactions but notice what happens in verse 22. and the Lord heard the voice of Elijah and the soul of the child came into him again and he revived despite the test despite the trial there was a reward for what she had done there was an incentive that Elijah was holding out to her that maybe wasn't apparent in the first feeding maybe it wasn't Apparent at first when he was sustainer during a time of drought in a time of famine but there was still yet another promise that when she suffered death within her family and the loss of her son that there was something that could be moved in this ministry of Elijah and he spoke and the soul of the child came into him again and this dead son was raised back to life I want you to recognize the the benefit that she received when in this moment in this instance was that death came and it was defeated the the prophet's reward is that death was knocking and it stayed away but now death makes it and death is overcome by it and there was a direct connection we ought not to miss this there was a direct connection between her efforts to serve Elijah and her efforts to to serve him with the meal in the oil there was a direct connection with her between her efforts to sustain the profit and the rewards that she was receiving a direct connection between her labor and her faith and the Reviving of her son amen this is the part of the spirit of Elijah remember the to receive a prophet name of prophets to receive a prophet's reward and second Kings chapter 4 verses 8 to 10. let's look at another example of the spirit of Elijah because Elijah wanted that exactly Elisha wanted that exact anointing on him represented by that double portion and it fell on a day that Elisha passed a shoonom so this is where was a great woman shunamite woman and she constrained him to eat bread and so it was that as often as he passed by he turned in thither to eat bread and she said unto her husband a catch just the labor and the care that she has for God's servants notice that whatever it was whatever unction she had to serve him she obeyed It Whatever inspiration she had to minister to this man she gave of her home she gives her resource she gives of her bread and remember Jesus said in so much that you've done it unto the least of these my brethren you've done it unto me so what she's doing is to the Lord and there was a reward even in a glass of water merits award notice what she's doing for the Elijah a lot this Elijah Ministry on Elisha and she said unto her husband verse 9 behold now I perceive that this is a holy man of God which passeth by us continually let us make a little chamber I pray thee on the wall and let us set for him there a bed and a table and a stool and a Candlestick and it shall be when he cometh to us that he shall turn in thither and he did this notice this labor and this care that this family began to give to Elisha Elisha being under this anointing the spirit of Elijah this is something that she had done to serve Elisha and in doing so serves God and this service is not going to go unnoticed all these efforts towards this uh this ministry is not going to go unnoticed if I can say it this way her efforts were registering in heaven her efforts were being noticed by a God who rewards by God who gives and we recognize in this story well let me just let me just continue to read let me just go back to this quote I think I have it there in Ma and and as I was reading this it's been a number of years some of you may heard me preach this to some degree elsewhere um but these when God kept bringing me back to this quote my inspiration was the Elijah's reward the prophet's reward in this end time what does it present to us and begin to see a pattern in Elijah's Ministry and I was thinking think of this pattern think this is the reward this is the reward of this day this is the incentive that god holds out to the believer inspiring him to press on and motivating him to press on and then I kept coming back to this quote well he's a friend he's a friend and then and I and I kept wrestling with it and the Holy Spirit kept telling me go back to it go back to it go back to it and I can't say well he's a friend he's a friend he's a friend and and more opened up well it means more to be a friend than just to be a buddy you you you become a servant you obey you render to him what is due uh you receive secret things so I begin to see friendship in a much deeper way but I was like no I see this pattern in the lives of a minute Elijah's Ministry this is this is the reward of Elijah this is the word of Elijah so I came back to this brother Branham if you have time please explain Matthew 10 41 God kept bringing me back to it over and over again I'm like I know I get it he's a friend can you please I'd like to know what is a prophet's reward please explain Matthew 10 41. I'd like to know what a prophet's reward is I know it's going to take a lot of time so do it when you've got time right prophets rewarders to be a friend with the prophet and if they want to know a prophet's reward is is to be a friend of a prophet that's reward he's your friend and then brother Brandon says like the shunamite woman it might come in handy sometime it did with her Watch God's servants brother Brandon wasn't just he says yeah you're right this would take a lot of time but let me just get it in real quick you receive a prophet in the name of a prophet you'll receive a prophet's reward that's to be a friend of a prophet and if you become a real friend of the Prophet you do what he says and you catch the Mysteries it's going to come in handy sometime and he says like the shunamite woman Hallelujah it might come in handy sometime and what happened for the shunami woman not only did she make a place for Elisha not only did she give them bread not only did she give them a bed not only did she show care to him but when her son died when he passed away she said I've got to go to this servant and in the Elisha said well I want this servant I don't have him but she said I don't want some other man I want to go to the prophet I want to I want to hear it from him and Elisha does what he comes to the home and he comes to this place wherein this he lived and this woman served and he received of their home and there laid this dead son in a family that had labored for him and he travails and what does he do he raises the Sun from the dead this dead son comes back to life this is the spirit of Elijah so when brother Brown says oh prophet's reward is to be a friend of a prophet he just lays out this great mystery he's pointing to the mystery of true friendship he's pointing to the potential of its reward he's pointing to the incentive the Friendship itself has its own reward this was the shunamites woman's reward for friendship with Elisha just like the Widow of zaraphat you catch what's happening the Widow is there a fact and I love how the women are being brought into the view in this because then it helps us to understand this speaks of me as the elect of God the the Bride of Jesus Christ death was knocking on the door by famine and by drought but Elijah came and and prevented death death came to the family and Elijah came and raised him from the dead now you have the same thing happen with the of my woman and it's the very image that brother Branham wants us to see when it comes to a prophet's reward with Elijah for this day referred to the scripture he said Remember the shoot of my woman come in handy sometime the spirit of Elijah on Elijah and Elisha holds the mystery of the message incentive in the new 10 in the Old Testament there's only three instances of the Dead being resurrected we've already read two of them to you Elijah in first king 17. twice by Elisha one here in Second Kings four and then another time by Elijah has any surprises twice by Elijah once by Elijah twice by Elisha second Kings chapter 13 the bones of Elijah Elisha are in a grave and some Israelites are trying to bury a man real quick and the enemy's coming and Elisha's bones are in there and in their haste they throw the dead man upon the bones of the prophet and he comes alive I want you to think about what it Matt what it means the spirit of Elijah what it represents what this ministry represents a dead man's bodies resurrected when it touches the bones of a dead Prophet why because God was wanting you to have respect for the reward he's one you have respect for the anointing and respect for the ministry of Elijah that there's something he wants to convey to us in the ministry of Elijah a spirit that he uses five times in every single instance he's one is to recognize the power and potential of it John who in the spirit of the Elijah came forward doing what introducing the truth and the life he came pointing to the resurrection and the life that's what Elijah's Ministry represents life and Resurrection [Music] we're pointing to the Elijah of our day would be the fourth but what happens with the fifth Revelations 11 11. Elijah is Resurrected so Elijah of Malachi 4 is associated with the reward of a resurrection in the rapture he's associated with power over death that's the prophet's reward he's your friend like the shunamite woman it might come in handy sometime you don't think the prophet was pointing to something the Elijah of Malachi 4 is associated with this reward this is what I'm wanting new to esteem as we close this series esteem the recompense of God there is a reward that's held out to us who believe the message there's a reward held up to us by the message this Shout it might come in handy sometimes a reward in the face of spiritual death a reward in this Faith at the face of spiritual famine a reward in the time of plagues of deception a reward in the time of literal death even Elijah's own life speaks to this in second Kings chapter 2 verse 11. it came to pass as they still went on Elisha is not going to take his eyes off Elijah and talk that behold there appeared a chariot of fire in the horses of fire imparted them both asunder and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven this was this is Elijah's literal reward to be swept away bypassing death in the first instance of the ministry of Elijah not only does he raise prevent death and raise the dead but he doesn't even die himself what is it that God's trying to the figure that he's trying to show to us brother Adam said the message Investments about Elijah after he got old and tired he was ready to go home he didn't even have to die his payoff come God just sent him down a chariot and some horses and packed him up into the heavens so even Elijah's own reward speaks to the message incentive he says his payoff come this is the payoff of Elijah Elijah is a partaker of the firstfruits of his own reward that he shall not taste death the layout of sin Church age brother man who preaches Elijah did not have to die he was translated and was taken up into heaven why why a type of the church at the end of this Elijah that will come a type of the Bride that's going to be called out by revelations 18 4. a type of the Bride that's going to be called out of the church at the end time the type of the Bride that's going to be raised up by the ministry of Elijah why did God preserve Elijah so that he would be a type of the Bride in the last days that comes under the anointing of Malachi 4. at the end of his time the church will go in the Rapture without going through the shadows of death it'll be the rapture in the meantime this is the reward that's extended to us this is the goal that we ought to keep in mind this is something that we ought to patiently pursue and put everything we we do in light of this great precious promise that is put before us the Bible says in Hebrews chapter 11 verses 5 to 6 we read verse 6 earlier and I said there's a great mystery in this there's so much more to this by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because God had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God this is Enoch's testimony and notice it's a testimony that he was translated before he died and his testimony was before he was translated he had a testimony that he pleased God this is the very thing that Paul said we ought to do we ought to make it our ambition that we would please him we should not want to displease him it's a fearful thing to displease him this is the image that he brings up after telling us what he did in Hebrews chapter 10 that Enoch walked with God and was not found as it says in Genesis 5 24 and Enoch walked with God and was not for God took him this is the mystery of Hebrews 11 6 because he says for listen to it I'm just getting too excited I guess but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh the God must believe that he is and that he's a rewarder of them that diligently seek him he's talking about a translation he's talking about a resurrection you've got to want it bad enough to seek it we begin to have a theme in our home and maybe this is put a little bit crudely and this was early on in its developmental stages Rapture a bust and we begin to have this burden and vision in our home that we we want to examine what we do by whether or not this is facilitating the body change for ourselves and for our children am I in a church that's given me the resources I need to possess every promise am I hearing a word that's going to lead me to a body change am I diligently seeking him because unless I have a faith that diligently seeks unless I have a hunger that I want every single promise unless I come under desperation and say God you promised elect right in this end time that she'd put every devil under her feet including death and until I get desperate to have the last funeral for an elect seed am I really going to see it and if I could say this just by way of supposing or conjecture I pray to God that he doesn't have to send pandemic after pandemic to weed out all the elect who aren't hungry enough for a rapture brother Brown said Enoch was translated from Death By God's transforming power why did God do that for a type of the rapturing church that's coming and he says yeah Elijah was the same why did God do it as a type for us that we could have this testimony that we please God we have this testimony that we believe he's a reward of them that diligently seek him so we seek him in his promises this is a secret too in the meantime that we ought to be pursuing the prize to ought to be some hunger and ambition and a heart to gain every Crown this I share this is this is the incentive that this message holds out to us that this is something that we realize the message wants us to take into consideration to live for the reward of this hour build around in the sermon excuse me chapter seven of the church age book says and they shall walk with me my wife was going to sing a song today that she wrote about walk with me and just we ran out of time he said this that is what God says he will bestow upon them for this upright that is part of their inheritance that he's reserved for them if they are willing to walk with him to the toils and snares of life and be an honor to him he was going to reward him this is the example of Elijah this is the example of Enoch he's going to reward him he is not forgetful of our labor of love God will always recompense us for our efforts to please him he always will and the sermon inspiration someday brother when the son refuses to shine when the moon goes down and the stars hide their face from the earth and the last sermons preached and the Bible's laying closed the church blowed into bits and the rocks are convolting and crying out I want to know him as the poet in the song said I see Adam Shake Eve and say Eve this is it honey Eve reaches over and shakes Abel and Abel shakes Seth Seth shakes Noah Noah shakes Abraham the time has come and notice he says know him in the power of his resurrection know that my inspiration that's been leading me and been clashed as a fanatic and whatever more it's brought me to the line it's brought me to the pain off place oh this is why Paul says you have need of patience then after you've done the will of God you might receive the promise don't give up little bride there's a prize for perseverance it's brought me to a pain off-place mothers you old gray-headed mothers and daddies here I say this to the veterans amongst us who persevere there's so many terms of the message so many ups and downs and church splits and revivals and meetings and interpretations but you've stayed faithful you've seen things come and go he says it's brought me to a pain all place and he says don't worry the inspiration that's LED you to Christ and you've come through many dangerous toils and snares don't worry some morning it'll pay off it'll pay off there's a reward that's coming that's why Paul says let no man beguile you out of your reward in a voluntary humility let no man cheat you from every incentive that this message holds out just as they rebuked the Galatians whose Bewitched you you become fools that you obey not the truth what are you saying you've got it in you to win you've got it in you to gain don't let anybody cheat you out of it Hebrews 12 1-3 wherefore sin that we are also confessed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside everywhere wait and the sin which does so easily beset us and let us run with patience Paul building on that Hebrews 10. in the meantime what ought we to do run our race with patients that is set before us Paul did so he says I finished my course and henceforth there's laid up for me a crown and what do we do we look unto Jesus the author and finish of our faith who for the joy that was set before endured the cross despising the shame and to sit down at the right hand of the Throne of God for consider him that endured such contradictions of Sinners against himself lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds consider Moses consider Jesus consider all these ones who endured with the prize and view think of the reward unless you get weary think of the reward unless you think it's not worth it think of the reward unless you think it's all in vain think of the reward what was the quote we read in the begin this year I'm looking forward now what I'm looking forward to now is what I'll do in this coming year towards the betterment of the Kingdom doing more all that I can do for the kingdom of God and the things that we tried to express to you this year and this first quarter of the year we've just been pretty much on one theme we know the will of God for us so let's do it let's be faithful in it let's let's in our home sanctify our home and gather our families and ourselves even as individuals around the world and let's have a life that's living for others I know that's God's will for me I know that's a work he wants to be under eight to undertaken and I don't want to stand before him on that day having not done the will of God and therefore not receiving a promise I don't want to be one that stands before him on that day and I disappoint him because I didn't know do what I knew I should do I want to assemble myself together as I have an opportunity I want to give of my resources in tithes and offerings I want to support missions I want to do the things I know that God wants me to do not just because solely that I ought to do it but I know that it pleases him unless I get weary and faint I know that it pleases him and if it pleases him he Rewards yeah we could have our brothers come to their instruments brother man says if you only look for today you'd be a miserable person look to the end out there and live for that out to the end you know if all you did is look today on a Sunday you wake up you go I guess I gotta go to church again pay my tithes and offerings support missions and sing a few songs and go home because that's when the church doors are open you know yes Christian's gonna be there right and that's that's what you're doing and it's all you focus on if you only look for today you'd be a miserable person you know what that may explain the misery people go through when they go to church because they're only looking at I guess today we need to be there they're going to notice if I'm not there but he says look out to the end to live for that when you can live out to look out to the end and live for that then you realize wait a minute today just about today is about tomorrow and tomorrow will be about the next and every single one of these are just stepping stones to the great promise and you know that there's a reward today you may not receive it today but there's a reward for doing what he asked us to do in the sermon in time evangelism if I could just use a few more of these a couple just a couple more quotes here brother man I'm in this sermon the end time evangelism he's referred to the woman that washed Jesus feet and Simon was sitting there scoffing at her mocking her and just how much she had to go through to get to that place where she was willing to be ridiculed and looked down upon she's so he's using this woman that washed Jesus feet but he's working off of also the type of Rebecca who watered the camels of Abraham servant he says here comes his brother remember uses calls him Elisa that he comes and he's going to get a bride for Isaac so Abraham is sent his servant to go find a bride and the message the messenger has this image this Vision that the one that comes and Waters my camels that's the one that's going to be the the bride to my servant son [Music] so Rebecca goes to draw water and she's going to go draw water for her family but something in her serves and gets water and gets this water Waters the camels and and so this is the type that brother Brown's drawing on he says all the way down now so he's now speaking of the woman that washed Jesus feet all the way down she had nothing at all but just a fear that she wasn't doing the right thing is there someone here that has a fear of that Maybe but it needed to be done but her reward come at the end and that reward he what was it went through all that to hear thy sins be forgiven oh think of all the things she had to suffer what she had to give up everything she had to overcome but that reward we said thy sins be forgiven thee so now he brings it on us you might hear me preach these messages you might see the Holy Spirit discern and do great things and perform Miracles you might pray and it would never come to pass go on your reward comes at the end wouldn't that be better then wouldn't it be better then you say yeah because that's what he says you think you realize so much sometimes what we want is the Vindication in this life I wanna I wanna pray till I speak in tongues I want to see the dead Rays when I lay my hands on them I want to have a I want to have a church service where everyone is excited and moving and shouting and dancing and praising so that I can have some sort of affirmation that I'm in it that everything's working everything's fine he says you know what none of those things may happen to you he says but your reward comes at the end he says go on your reward comes at the end wouldn't that be better anyways but he still doesn't exclude us from service he says do Jesus a service that's the end time message what's the end time message do Jesus a service he had a bride God's looking for character this is the character that Rebecca had when she came to the well she had the kind of character that the servant was looking for for her his master's son and he said that's the end time message to God a service demonstrate the character that's becoming of the Bride of Jesus Christ I'm doing a service knowing that through all your tears through all your giving through all your pouring out even if it would be in the image of crying upon the feet of Jesus and pouring the oil upon his feet and drying it with your hair and this messy scene that the world just wants to criticize and make fun of even if that be it just stay in service there's a reward that comes at the end and brother Brad him in the fifth seal picks up this image of Rebecca again he says remember when the servant of Abraham Eliezer when you come to get Rebecca there's a reason why we had two Rebecca Singh all right Rebecca when the servant of Abraham Eliezer when he came to get Rebecca she mounted up on her camel the very camel she watered very camel that she served the very thing that she gave attention to what was it that saved the shun of my woman's son the very Ministry she supported what was it that saved the Zarephath Widow and her son the very Ministry she supported think about the reward that they came down to he said Rebecca she mounted off her camel and it was the camel that she wanted he brings this beautiful image before us she rode the camel to meet her unseen bridegroom the very thing she watered was the very thing that took her to her future home and husband and it's the same thing today the very thing that the church is watering that is the seed the seed of the word it's the very word that becomes alive and Carries us to our unseen bridegroom I say it's worth it to water it's worth it to serve it's worth it to give my all I want a hundredfold this very thing that I'm watering it's carrying me to a meeting in the air though I've United with them now spiritually though there's an invisible Union though there's been an unfolding of the invisible God's objective all along is that one day it would be United in flesh and full visible manifestation the very thing that you're watering is this image of Rebecca is the very thing that's coming alive and carrying us to our unseen bridegroom I want to encourage you in the meantime there's going to be a day we're all going to have to answer and that in itself is fearful enough so in the meantime keep the incentives in view there's goals that we're labing for there's crowds that can be gained and we ought to press with everything that's in US brother Brown said there's a reward for Overcomers there's a reward for Overcomers he says press on Lily did Lily sing too I just have never felt more Vindicated in my life guys I mean come on I was going to use Esther as a type too and Michael the Archangel and Micah the prophet and being loyal Joshua it was a masterpiece and I've just run out of time [Music] press on Lily if it's in you lay aside the mud and everything else impressed towards the top this is the message telling us don't quit don't give up and and I know that this is maybe fearful ground to step on because for some they may say well brother Aaron if you give them if you give them room if you give them an answer they're going to take a yard and if you just don't nail it down tight you're not going to give them any room to uh to Mo you're going to give them too much to room to move and it's going to be to their detriment I I want to say don't Cast Away Your Liberty don't Cast Away your confidence I could preach you today it says from this point on you're gonna you're gonna prove whether or not you're a daughter of God from this day on you're going to prove whether or not you're going to be in eternity from this down you're going to prove whether or not you end up in Hell or end up in heaven I just want to change the tone just a little bit and say whatever you do don't waste the opportunities that you have the pressures of Life the disappointments the Fallen away the sin the abuse everything we go through can beat upon an individual to the point where they just don't they don't want to even go on anymore they don't want to go to church they don't want to persevere the wait has just been too much and the mod has just been too much the pond has just been too sticky the darkness has been just been too great but I say press on Lily press through all of it don't give up don't let it beat you into submission to lay out a church to no longer give your all to no longer use your gifts but say I know there's gold inside of me that God is trying to dig out I want to lay aside the mud I want to lay aside everything else I want to press up to the top where my full reward will come press on with everything that's in you I believe that we can do it because I know it's in you and I want to see you do it let's do it together in the meantime let's labor for these incentives let's do it together
