[0:00] if you could just do your best to uh
[0:02] stay focused this evening and and
[0:03] concentrate on the word of the Lord I
[0:05] think it'll be a blessing to you and and
[0:08] something that to encourage us my title
[0:10] is out of dust and I'm including in this
[0:14] title out of dust kind of this dot dot
[0:17] dot this ellipses to uh suggest that
[0:20] there's more to this subject and maybe
[0:22] we'll pick up on it in another service
[0:24] here soon but it is connected with God
[0:26] rebuilding uh the temple God restoring
[0:30] uh uh Egypt and God Redeeming the excuse
[0:33] me restoring Israel and God Redeeming
[0:36] the bride there's these elements of the
[0:37] body of Christ being rebuilt and the
[0:39] temple being restored and God redeeming
[0:42] Israel so those different uh elements
[0:44] we've been looking at in the word of God
[0:46] and so they fit in the house of God
[0:48] being built again and I want to take
[0:50] this tonight just as introductory on the
[0:52] subject uh out of dust now I want to use
[0:56] this definition of dust it would just be
[0:58] our book definition something you could
[1:00] find in Webster or the uh free
[1:02] dictionary online it's a fine uh dry
[1:04] particle or the Fine Dry particles of
[1:06] the earth and it's dust in that it's so
[1:09] light that it can be carried away by the
[1:11] wind uh tossed about Blown Away very
[1:13] easily and that's what we're referring
[1:15] to we talk about dust it's these fine
[1:17] particles very light can be uh uh just
[1:19] blown away in just a second and dust is
[1:22] used to symbolize mortal life it's the
[1:25] very Elementary substance of the human
[1:27] body in Genesis 2: s it says the Lord
[1:30] God formed man of the Dust of the ground
[1:33] and breathed into his nostrils the
[1:35] breath of life and Man became a living
[1:38] Soul so tells us that our physical
[1:40] bodies are made of dust we come from
[1:43] dust that word there dust in the Hebrew
[1:45] is dry loose Earth it speaks it's used
[1:48] of Ashes or debris it actually to say
[1:50] about dust it's just rubbish and in the
[1:53] emology of even our English word dust it
[1:55] comes from the old German and some of
[1:57] the European languages of mist or Vapor
[2:00] or smoke that's what dust even
[2:02] represents sometimes you'll see a a dust
[2:04] on the horizon and think it's smoke or
[2:06] you may see something it looks Misty or
[2:08] cloudy that's what dust is and the Bible
[2:11] says that man is made of the Dust of the
[2:14] ground just ashes just debris rubbish uh
[2:17] find particles that in themselves have
[2:19] no weight or no real substance and then
[2:22] when God is speaking uh to man it after
[2:25] the fall says in Genesis 3: 19 in the
[2:28] sweat of thy face sh thou eat bread till
[2:31] thou return unto the ground and it says
[2:33] for out of it was thou taken f for dust
[2:37] Thou Art and un dust shalt thou return
[2:40] God revisits this man should recognize
[2:42] that in his human body in his person uh
[2:45] he came from the ground he came from the
[2:47] the ashes of the earth he came from the
[2:49] debris he came from just rubbish we call
[2:51] it just dirt from the mud and it says
[2:54] that you're going to eat bread until you
[2:56] go right back into the ground again for
[2:58] Out of the Dust you came and and under
[3:00] the dust you will return it even revisit
[3:03] in Ecclesiastes 3:20 all go into one
[3:06] place all are of the dust and all turn
[3:10] to dust again that's thought we could
[3:13] say as the the church in Kansas sings
[3:15] All We Are is Dust in the Wind and and
[3:18] this dust represents the cycle of Life
[3:21] uh uh that we we come from dust and we
[3:23] live out these lives extraordinary lives
[3:25] just being dust just coming from the
[3:27] dirt coming from the ground and this as
[3:30] we return back to this all are dust and
[3:32] all turn to dust again this dust
[3:33] represents the cycle of life where we
[3:36] come from into life into being right
[3:39] back to death again and it and and it
[3:41] just quickly uh goes away just as if it
[3:44] were dust uh being blown away by the
[3:46] wind and James chapter 4:14 he even
[3:50] refers to this whereas you know not what
[3:52] shall be on the tomorrow for what is
[3:54] your life it is even a vapor that appear
[3:58] for a little time and then vanisheth
[4:00] away to say that life is like Vapor to
[4:03] hearken back to the fact that we're just
[4:05] dust particles that were made up of dust
[4:07] it's a it's that mist it's that Vapor
[4:09] it's just a smoke and that it it's here
[4:12] one day and it appears for a little
[4:13] while but then it just blows away it
[4:15] just vanishes away as if With the Wind
[4:18] then job says it in Job chapter 14
[4:21] verses 1 to2 man that is born of a woman
[4:24] is of a few days and full of trouble he
[4:28] cometh forth like a flower and is cut
[4:30] down he fleeth also as a shadow and
[4:33] continueth not just vaporizes someone
[4:36] can be here one day and then they're
[4:37] gone the next they're here and gone they
[4:40] they have substance they have form they
[4:42] have life they have uh they have an
[4:44] image you can relate to them you could
[4:46] talk to them you can interact with them
[4:47] but he's saying that uh soon enough
[4:49] they're here and then gone so he
[4:51] characterizes it in this ways James says
[4:53] it's just a vapor you appear a little
[4:55] time and then vanish he says a man born
[4:57] of a woman which we all are is of a a
[4:59] few days and full of
[5:02] trouble as I was looking at that word
[5:04] full of trouble it speaks of agitation
[5:06] or turmoil or trembling uh it's a raging
[5:09] and it gave me this picture of something
[5:11] just life just boils their life just
[5:13] boils it's full of trouble agitation
[5:15] turmoil raging uh it begins with birth
[5:18] it just heats up and heats up to the
[5:20] point to where it just begins to boil
[5:21] and boil and it boils long enough to
[5:23] where it just turns to mist and it
[5:25] vaporizes and think of it this way life
[5:27] is a pressure cooker
[5:30] and it just pressurizes till eventually
[5:32] it just goes away and as job said that
[5:35] man born of a woman his days are full of
[5:38] trouble and he's just a few days and
[5:40] it's like a flower that grows and it's
[5:42] cut down it's like a shadow that flees
[5:44] away that we no longer
[5:46] see it says in Job chapter 2: 7 and 8
[5:51] and we've already read some things we'll
[5:52] just refer back to it here in a moment
[5:53] it says so went Satan forth from the
[5:56] presence of the Lord and smokee job with
[5:59] sore Bo oils from the sole of his foot
[6:01] unto his crown now if you call in
[6:03] chapter one he said stretch forth your
[6:06] hand on his life but don't touch his
[6:07] body and since Job maintained his
[6:10] Integrity Satan says well you know I
[6:13] think I could get get him to do his
[6:14] worst if you'll just let me touch his
[6:16] body and God says all right go ahead but
[6:18] don't take his life so here he is full
[6:21] of these olers these boils from the sols
[6:23] of his feet to the crown of his head
[6:24] over his entire body and he took him
[6:26] apost her to scrape himself with all and
[6:29] he sat down among the ashes just takes
[6:34] this broken bits of clay and he begins
[6:36] to scrape himself and itch himself says
[6:39] he sits down among the ashes he's as we
[6:41] say an ash Heap there's job and in
[6:44] chapter one job loses his sons his
[6:46] daughters are implied in there his
[6:48] servants his sheep his cattle the camels
[6:51] and all these things are gone in a
[6:53] moment and he maintains his Integrity
[6:55] but now his health is gone and as he
[6:58] sits there on these ashes scraping these
[7:01] boils it symbolizes the cycle of man's
[7:04] life of birth and then this living which
[7:07] is characterized by trouble and for job
[7:09] it maybe it's just all condensed into
[7:11] one uh one thing but if you live long
[7:13] enough you're going to lose loved ones
[7:14] you live long enough you're going to
[7:15] lose possessions you live long enough
[7:17] you're going to experience these kind of
[7:18] troubles but job sitting on these ashes
[7:21] scraping these boils it symbolized
[7:23] almost the whole cycle of man's life
[7:25] from birth to trouble to now
[7:28] death Jo just dust of the earth sitting
[7:30] on an ash sheap that even the dust of
[7:32] the earth is connected with as in
[7:35] Genesis 18:27 Abraham answered and said
[7:38] behold now I've taken upon me to speak
[7:40] unto the Lord which in but dust in ashes
[7:44] this is what he says about himself he
[7:45] realizes I'm just dust and Ash that's
[7:48] all that man is in his body and in his
[7:50] person he's just dust and Ashes I I I've
[7:53] come from the dust I'm made of dust and
[7:55] Ashes and as job sat upon those ashes
[7:57] scraping his boils it was just him uh
[8:00] sitting there in what would appear to be
[8:02] the end of life dust upon the ashes
[8:06] waiting to die as he says in job chter
[8:09] 30: 19 Heath cast me into the
[8:12] m and I am become like dust in
[8:17] ashes as you read the depictions of it
[8:19] even as some authors have embellished it
[8:22] and and not in an untrue sense but just
[8:24] labor to try to paint this picture of
[8:26] what it really would have looked like
[8:28] upon these Ash
[8:30] and these broken pieces and this
[8:31] postured scraping on his boils he would
[8:33] have looked like a
[8:35] corpse he would have been Ashen and
[8:37] Grave uh bowing into the dust of the
[8:40] Earth this would be one that all would
[8:42] be waiting this great man who had
[8:44] everything is now
[8:47] dying and as we would consider job in
[8:50] that particular instance I I want to in
[8:53] some way say that we can all on some
[8:56] level begin to empath empathize with job
[8:59] that in this pressure cooker of Life uh
[9:02] we may often feel that we're being
[9:03] vaporized we feel beset we feel pressed
[9:06] in uh we feel our Humanity we may feel
[9:09] just like dust just how easy it is for
[9:11] us to be pushed around just how easy it
[9:13] is uh just to be on the verge of Ruin
[9:16] and things that we loved taking away
[9:17] from us or things that we enjoyed being
[9:19] missing and just how uh how fragile life
[9:23] can
[9:24] be and job experienced a lifetime of
[9:27] Sorrows and well beyond what anyone we
[9:29] would know personally could say that
[9:31] they experienced in such a short period
[9:33] of time but yet his life represents
[9:35] something about man man is born of a
[9:38] woman is just a few days and full of
[9:40] trouble and and and job's troubles would
[9:43] we can begin to relate to as a man and
[9:46] as a woman that the things that he
[9:48] experienced and the relationships and
[9:50] loss and failure of Health that this is
[9:52] this represents the pressure cooker of
[9:55] life and in the sermon letting off the
[9:58] pressure I was listening to the one that
[10:00] brother Brandon preached in I think it's
[10:02] January of 1963 in Phoenix and at the
[10:05] beginning he's talking about uh even
[10:07] really before he gets into his preaching
[10:09] he's talking about job he's talking
[10:10] about the funeral that he did for uh Mrs
[10:13] Ford and he's saying how that job began
[10:15] to recognize it's in Job chapter 14 that
[10:18] well what happens you see something grow
[10:20] and it dies and he does does it live
[10:22] again what about man when he dies will
[10:24] he live again but then look at nature
[10:26] look at the Sun and look at all these
[10:27] things and he's drawing from this
[10:29] example but in the sermon letting off
[10:31] the pressure in those several places he
[10:33] preaches it he's referring to these
[10:34] things he says we're living in a
[10:37] neurotic age nervous
[10:41] tension and everyone said that ain't
[10:43] nothing but the truth brother brandom
[10:45] we're living in a neurotic age nervous
[10:47] tension everyone is racing here and
[10:50] going there and going
[10:52] nowhere and it seems like in Phoenix
[10:54] there's some of the
[10:56] worst it's just that kind of age and I
[10:59] know this church would be plagued with
[11:01] it as everywhere is plagued with it
[11:04] Tabernacles plagued with it everywhere
[11:06] the whole world so let's not act all you
[11:08] know big right like Arizona Believers
[11:11] Church a no pressure
[11:14] here but no we feel it nervous tension
[11:17] he said it's a day of pressure hurry
[11:19] hurry hurry hurry hurry up and
[11:23] wait right you it's a we we you speed
[11:26] through lights and you make these turns
[11:27] and you always use wav to make sure you
[11:29] got a shortcut and you end up in the
[11:31] same spot the guy that you blew past
[11:32] several lights ago right we're just
[11:34] hurrying up hurrying in hurry hurry
[11:36] hurry hurry and wait Drive 90 mes an
[11:38] hour and then get home for supper and
[11:39] wait two hours till it gets ready he
[11:42] said that's right he said it's the time
[11:44] we're living it's he says it's a time
[11:46] this is what we're living in now I want
[11:47] you to kind of catch as we can relate to
[11:50] the road rage and and those things but
[11:52] now it gets more real because he says
[11:55] and in that rushing and speeding it gets
[11:57] you to a nervous tension so let's just
[12:00] look at life on the outside of the home
[12:02] that the the things that exist that's
[12:04] not our house we're not trying to turn
[12:06] this world into our home this world is
[12:07] not our home but as we make our way in
[12:09] the world out there there's tension
[12:12] there's pressure there's demands there's
[12:13] deadlines there's benchmarks there's
[12:15] quotas there's all sorts of things that
[12:17] begin to bombard us and and even that
[12:19] you look at certain things that's
[12:20] required to get into college you look at
[12:22] certain things you're going to need to
[12:23] buy a house you look at all these
[12:25] different things and we're constantly
[12:26] feeling pressure from so many different
[12:28] sides
[12:29] just even with things that we might
[12:31] enjoy and make life easier there's just
[12:33] a cycle an upcycle where you got to
[12:35] upgrade and you got to trade things in
[12:37] and you're always in this fix do I get
[12:39] the new iPhone do I get the latest and
[12:40] greatest and which one do we you know
[12:42] I'm always Under Pressure always under
[12:45] tension and now it he shows how terrible
[12:48] this is he says it's rushing and
[12:50] speeding gets you to a nervous tension
[12:52] the wife says something a little
[12:53] contrary you want to fly off
[12:56] temper so it's just a little little
[12:59] something that the wife says and you
[13:00] blow up but it's not what she said that
[13:03] built the tension it's just tension's
[13:06] been
[13:06] building husband say something you'll
[13:09] Pat your foot and tell him to get in the
[13:11] room we don't have no idea what he's
[13:13] talking about
[13:14] right well now husband I don't want no
[13:17] words with you get out of there wife oh
[13:20] I'm so nervous so this is quite a
[13:23] scene there's this tension is blowing up
[13:26] he says why what's the matter all this
[13:28] together this tension building up then
[13:30] the result of it is doing something
[13:33] wrong and I love this and acting out of
[13:36] place some of us might have a particular
[13:39] disposition and we might seem to be a
[13:40] little rough and short tempered but you
[13:41] know what it's just tension that's
[13:43] making you act out of place it's not who
[13:46] you are as a Son of God that's not what
[13:47] you're called to be that's not who you
[13:48] are as a daughter of God but the tension
[13:50] gets to us he says the results of the
[13:53] pressure is doing something wrong and
[13:55] acting out of order that's the result of
[13:58] the pressure I think you could probably
[13:59] see how a lot of this ties into some of
[14:01] the things we've been ministering on he
[14:02] said that's right now to make the poor
[14:05] that way act that way it'll make the
[14:07] middle class act that way it'll make the
[14:09] rich act that way come on rich
[14:12] people right it makes us it makes them
[14:15] all the poor the middle class the rich
[14:16] act that way it'll make the wrong act
[14:19] that way it'll make the pretty good act
[14:22] that way it'll make the good act that
[14:24] way ain't none of you got a right to be
[14:27] over there going right all of us and if
[14:30] you want to identify as the very good
[14:31] rich person fine you still get under
[14:34] pressure and act out of place he said
[14:37] because it's tension steam built up life
[14:41] just boils and it boils and steam begins
[14:44] to build up he says got to blow it out
[14:47] somewhere you don't if you don't you'll
[14:49] blow the boiler up now we find that it
[14:52] builds up and the day goes you talk to
[14:54] your boss if you're working oh so and so
[14:56] and if you speak to the kitty come in
[14:58] here Mama I'm right because you had some
[15:01] kind of back and forth with the
[15:03] boss there's certain things that if you
[15:05] interact with people all day long I'm
[15:06] sure that school teachers have this
[15:08] problem especially if they're in
[15:09] elementary school they're sitting there
[15:10] teaching kids all day long they come
[15:12] home they're going to teach the husband
[15:13] something right you're just in a mode
[15:15] you're just in that zone this is just
[15:16] the way you're deal with kids all day
[15:18] long you'll talk to an adult like a kid
[15:21] and so there's he's talking about this
[15:22] pressure building you have a
[15:23] disagreement with the boss so you come
[15:25] home and you're all upset with your kids
[15:27] he says there you are it builds up ooh
[15:30] my he says you feel like your head's
[15:33] going to come off he says I know this
[15:35] isn't a prophet just Discerning he said
[15:37] I'm with it every day so I know what it
[15:39] means it builds up he's felt pressure
[15:42] before remember the pressure of that
[15:44] lawyer those nasty lawyers putting
[15:46] pressure on them the phone calls to
[15:47] where he finally he kind of blew up and
[15:49] told his son to tell a lie and stepped
[15:51] out that's
[15:52] pressure it builds and it builds and it
[15:56] builds it's the life that we're living
[15:58] in
[16:00] I know it may seem like we're
[16:01] trivializing what job was going through
[16:03] but Satan said I want to put pressure on
[16:06] job and I bet I can get them to blow up
[16:09] if you'll just let me keep putting
[16:11] pressure on
[16:13] them and it says in 1 Peter chapter 5 as
[16:16] we're wanting this to relate to
[16:18] us we're going to read verses 6 to 11
[16:22] and so as you as you look at this if you
[16:23] could put that up there 1 Peter chap 5:
[16:27] 6-1 all we start with verse six it says
[16:29] humble yourselves therefore under the
[16:31] mighty hand of God that he may exalt you
[16:34] in due time so this is what we've got to
[16:36] do first we got to Humble
[16:38] ourselves we have to Humble ourselves in
[16:41] the in the face of God who's great we
[16:43] don't get ourselves lifted up and as we
[16:46] humble ourselves he says if you humble
[16:48] yourself he will lift you
[16:49] up casting all your care upon him for he
[16:53] carth for you he does care but his care
[16:57] isn't going to matter to until you care
[16:58] it's not going to make a difference
[16:59] until you care he cares do you care
[17:02] casting all your care upon him for he
[17:04] carth for you be sober be sober be
[17:08] vigilant because your adversary the
[17:10] devil as a roaring lion walketh about
[17:13] seeking whom he may
[17:16] devour job kind of pulls back the
[17:18] curtain on this now I know that as he
[17:20] discusses it with Jesus or God rather
[17:22] God's the one that mentions job uh but
[17:26] God Satan is walking about he he's
[17:27] roolling he's roaming about the Earth
[17:30] and he's doing it as an adversary your
[17:32] enemy and he isn't a roaring lion but
[17:35] he's as a roaring lion who's W making
[17:37] due use of every opportunity to destroy
[17:41] you to vaporize you to cause you to
[17:45] cease to
[17:46] be but it says cast all your cares on
[17:49] him for he cares for you these cares are
[17:52] those anxious thoughts about
[17:55] life take all these anxious thoughts
[17:57] about life
[17:59] cast him under the Lord and depend upon
[18:01] his Providence in all things that
[18:04] whatever it might be I know he's working
[18:05] all things for my
[18:07] good and as I cast all my cares on him
[18:11] it says be
[18:12] sober and this ties into the cares
[18:15] because these cares that are spoken of
[18:17] are the anxiety that is intoxicating to
[18:19] our
[18:20] spirits that because we are so consumed
[18:24] with it it drives us to do things it
[18:27] causes us to act it causes us to
[18:29] preserve it causes us to reach out it
[18:31] causes us to uh sometimes be paralyzed
[18:34] sometimes it causes us to run and it's
[18:36] exactly what brother bram's describing
[18:38] when he says we live in a neurotic age
[18:39] with nervous tension there's all this
[18:41] pressure building on us and it's the
[18:44] anxiety the pressure the building the
[18:46] building and as it builds it intoxicates
[18:49] us life is but a few days and full of
[18:52] agitation and rumbling and roiling and
[18:54] this extreme intoxication because of all
[18:57] the pressure pressures of our
[18:59] life and it says we've got to be sober
[19:03] in other words we need to be uh
[19:06] restrained recognizing that the the
[19:09] pressures from our adversary are to get
[19:11] us to act out of place to cause us to
[19:14] blow up to cause us to get into a spot
[19:17] where we're we're hurrying we're
[19:18] hurrying we're worrying we're acting up
[19:20] we're doing something wrong or acting
[19:22] out of place I hope you catch this
[19:23] picture that's being painted by these
[19:25] things so it's asking us to be
[19:28] restrained and sober yet Vigilant
[19:31] there's some Paradox in that if you say
[19:33] well I don't want to get worked up I
[19:34] don't want to be too nervous I don't
[19:35] don't want to be so worried about
[19:37] everything but yet we're to be vigilant
[19:39] sure sober restrained yet
[19:42] Vigilant looking
[19:45] watching brother bamman again in that
[19:47] same sermon said it's just becoming a
[19:49] neurotic age everybody's all built up
[19:52] haven't got no
[19:53] time people are always telling me I know
[19:56] you're so busy I know you're so busy and
[19:57] I'm like are they troll in me I'm not
[20:00] busy and but yet there's always
[20:02] something to do you haven't got no time
[20:05] and that builds up to a place that it
[20:07] breaks up things tension anxiety cares
[20:11] pressure building building it causes
[20:14] people to have hard feelings when they
[20:16] snap them off and say things you don't
[20:18] mean to
[20:19] say now everybody's guilty of
[20:23] it I'm guilty brother let's all clutch
[20:26] our message pearls
[20:29] he says I'm guilty what happening
[20:32] pressure building up we snap off and we
[20:34] say things we shouldn't say you're all
[20:37] guilty we do things under pressure that
[20:40] we wouldn't do
[20:42] otherwise so there's an excess pressure
[20:45] built up today pressure is what causes
[20:47] us to do things sometimes young people I
[20:49] say this for your grace uh uh parents
[20:51] all of us the reason why we do some of
[20:53] the things we do is because this
[20:56] pressure builds and we snap we're guilty
[20:58] of saying things we don't mean to say we
[21:00] do things under pressure we wouldn't
[21:01] normally
[21:02] do so we've got to be sober
[21:06] Vigilant he says before I go any
[21:10] further I might say this and I'm so glad
[21:12] he says this I believe it's the enemy
[21:15] coming down and press him I believe it's
[21:17] the
[21:18] devil just as it was with job where he
[21:21] says I I I'm I'm going to Target job and
[21:23] you've given me this permission I'm
[21:25] going to press job and I'm going to
[21:27] press him with the loss of uh his
[21:29] resources the loss of his children the
[21:31] loss of his health and I guarantee that
[21:33] if I press him enough I'm going to get
[21:34] him to
[21:35] snap and he's going to be guilty and
[21:38] brother brandham gives us this grace
[21:39] that some of us if we've been
[21:40] ill-tempered if we've been a little
[21:42] upset we've been a little bit uh Lusty
[21:44] or whatever it might be we got to
[21:45] recognize the world is working on us
[21:47] over
[21:48] time it's the devil with all this excess
[21:51] pressure building up brother man says I
[21:52] believe it's the devil and we know the
[21:54] coming of the Lord is at hand and the
[21:55] Bible says in the last days that the
[21:57] devil would would go about like a
[21:58] roaring lion so brother Bram brings us
[22:01] right to First Peter chapter 5 where the
[22:03] devil is pressing he's lurking he's
[22:06] trolling he's triggering he's doing all
[22:07] sorts of things to get us worked up he
[22:09] says if he could get you under pressure
[22:11] hurrying running over something you will
[22:14] make decisions that you wouldn't make if
[22:16] you sat down and think it over people
[22:19] sometimes are just always making
[22:21] decisions because the Press things
[22:23] happen they're feeling pressed they just
[22:24] kneejerk make a decision things press
[22:26] again they're in the habit of making a
[22:27] kneejerk decision and what we need to do
[22:29] sometimes when we feel impressed saying
[22:31] hold on I need to sober up first I don't
[22:33] want to make a decision in the time of
[22:35] this press in the time of this worry and
[22:37] this fear and I got to act quick to
[22:39] preserve myself I got to act quick to
[22:40] make these sure these things work out
[22:42] just slow down and start thinking it
[22:45] over so he said I think it's the devil
[22:48] the enemy coming down and pressing so as
[22:50] we're told to cast our cares upon the
[22:52] Lord to be sober and Vigilant he says we
[22:55] have this uh adversary walking about so
[22:57] verse 9 1 Peter chapter 5 continuing
[22:59] that 6 to 11:9 whom resist steadfast in
[23:03] the faith who's he talking about resist
[23:05] the devil knowing that the same
[23:06] afflictions are accomplished in your
[23:08] brethren that are in the world I know we
[23:10] like to think we're the only ones going
[23:12] through it we're the only ones that are
[23:13] facing it this econom is worse than
[23:14] others or this is hotter than others and
[23:16] this that he says but you we ought to
[23:18] recognize that we have no excuse to
[23:20] yield to it well no one knows what we're
[23:23] going through no one knows what we were
[23:24] having to experience and our our church
[23:26] has it different my family has it
[23:28] different if you knew my life if you
[23:29] knew what I went through if you knew my
[23:30] background he said you have no excuse to
[23:33] get drunk off of your Sorrows you have
[23:35] no excuse to get drunk and misled off of
[23:38] the pressure you have no excuse to be
[23:39] intoxicated with the cares of this life
[23:41] because every believer around the world
[23:43] is suffering the same
[23:45] afflictions so he's saying whom resists
[23:47] steadfast in the faith in other words
[23:49] don't give into the
[23:51] pressure don't indulge in what he's
[23:53] pushing you to
[23:54] do it's important to recognize that if
[23:57] you're having this Fellowship ship with
[23:58] some uh people as of late and uh one
[24:00] brother in particular just sharing some
[24:01] things in his life and it looked like
[24:03] maybe an opportunity is opening up and I
[24:05] said well it it sure looks that way just
[24:07] be sure it's not a
[24:08] trap right because sometimes we feel
[24:10] pressed to do something and we're kind
[24:13] of being nudge in a particular direction
[24:15] and it might just be pressure forcing
[24:21] us recognize what's happening in Job
[24:23] chapter
[24:24] 2 job is sitting there on the ashy keep
[24:28] scraping his
[24:29] boils clay upon clay ashes upon
[24:34] ashes there he is sitting in this
[24:37] dump and as his life just seems to be
[24:40] withering away and he has nothing left
[24:43] except his wife we could maybe speculate
[24:45] in that in verse n it says then said his
[24:48] wife unto him Dost thou still retain thy
[24:52] Integrity you're not going to blow up
[24:54] yet you're not going to say what we've
[24:57] all been thinking
[24:58] thinking you're you're not going to give
[25:00] up you're not going to walk away she
[25:02] says do you still want to be upright do
[25:04] you still want to be sober do you still
[25:06] want to have your integrity why don't
[25:08] you lose it she says curse God curse God
[25:11] and
[25:13] die and this is something to really take
[25:15] into consideration from the very first
[25:17] moment that that that joob recognized
[25:19] his children were partying and it began
[25:21] out of this parental concern I feel this
[25:24] pressure for them and this anxiety for
[25:26] them and he was offering these
[25:27] sacrifices each one for his children he
[25:30] was feeling the weight and the burden as
[25:32] a father he was being proactive
[25:34] sacrificing just by chance that maybe
[25:36] they displease the Lord and it pressure
[25:38] is building pressures building and then
[25:40] he hears he loses his cattle he loses
[25:42] his sheep he loses his camels he's
[25:44] losing servants now he loses his
[25:46] children and pressure had been building
[25:48] and now the climactic exclam exclamation
[25:52] of all that he's been enduring is his
[25:54] wife saying why don't you curse God and
[25:57] die yes now you want to know what's so
[25:59] amazing about this in job 2: 4 and 5
[26:04] Satan answered the Lord and said skin
[26:05] for skin yeah all that the man hath will
[26:08] he give for his
[26:09] life but put forth thine hand now and
[26:12] touch his bone and his flesh and he will
[26:15] curse thee to thy
[26:18] face this is a conversation that the
[26:20] devil's having behind closed
[26:23] doors and he says skin for skin if
[26:25] you'll just let me touch his flesh I can
[26:29] make him curse
[26:32] you and as job is sitting there scraping
[26:36] these boils his wife verbalizes the very
[26:40] plan that Satan had in the begin in
[26:41] other words offered to him and told him
[26:43] why don't you curse God it's built to
[26:46] the place where now he's being
[26:47] challenged why don't you curse God and
[26:49] job responds in verse 10 but he said her
[26:51] thou speakest as one of the foolish
[26:53] women speaketh what shall we receive
[26:56] good at the the hand of God and shall we
[26:59] not receive evil in all of this did not
[27:01] job sin with his
[27:04] lips he maintained his Integrity even
[27:08] when the his wife shouts out tells him
[27:11] what to do just Curse God she verbalizes
[27:13] the very plan of Satan from the
[27:15] beginning with all the pressure but he
[27:17] says wait why why would I do that now I
[27:20] bless him when things are going well and
[27:21] then when things are going to B going
[27:23] bad I'm going to turn my back on
[27:26] them
[27:28] wow what a
[27:31] challenge brother Bram has asked a
[27:33] question in 1964 this part two the first
[27:36] that first Sunday there where he does
[27:37] those
[27:38] backtack uh Sundays of question and
[27:40] answers this is the question brother
[27:42] Brandon what shall we do something has
[27:44] settled over me that I cannot break
[27:46] through last fall I dreamed I was lost
[27:49] in white sand it was getting dark I
[27:51] couldn't find my way this dream has
[27:53] stayed with me since last
[27:55] fall now I am as one groping in darkness
[27:59] my son Irvin and his wife were included
[28:01] in my dream now they are also in
[28:04] darkness we are in desperation I believe
[28:07] God will show you what is in our hearts
[28:09] now if we are wrong or sinning places
[28:12] tell us we want to be right that's quite
[28:14] a quite a quite a question I do it there
[28:17] in the italics and just a different
[28:19] color so you know that this is a
[28:20] question that brother br's
[28:22] asked if you could just just listen
[28:24] listen to this and let's Let It Be
[28:26] instructed to us let it encourage let
[28:28] this word encourage us tonight I don't
[28:30] know if we job is often used as an
[28:32] encouraging uh figure but leave it to me
[28:36] to think I'm preaching something
[28:37] encouraging tonight and just making you
[28:39] guys more
[28:40] depressed thanks brother Aaron that was
[28:42] a real shot in the
[28:43] arm he says I don't know the lady but I
[28:46] just feel if you're here lady that here
[28:48] is your trouble you've let something
[28:51] happen to you that's made you
[28:53] nervous because being in White Sands
[28:55] represents Purity and righteous
[28:58] and you're just letting Satan put one
[29:00] over on you your dream proved that
[29:02] there's nothing wrong you're only
[29:05] nervous and by doing this and thinking
[29:07] this you're making the rest of your
[29:08] family nervous stop doing it claim your
[29:11] god-given rights amen I hope you can
[29:14] really catch a hold of this now as
[29:16] Believers you and your homes whether it
[29:17] be the fathers or the mothers and
[29:19] whoever you might be sometimes there's
[29:21] this nervous tension this anxiety this
[29:23] pressure things are falling apart we
[29:25] need to we need to make a decision we
[29:27] got to do something I feel like I'm lost
[29:28] we're desperate it's not not what we
[29:30] wanted it to be or whatever it might be
[29:32] you're going through you're only nervous
[29:33] he says you're by doing this and doing
[29:35] that thinking this and you're making the
[29:37] rest of them nervous stop doing it claim
[29:39] your god-given
[29:40] rights your dream proves by the
[29:42] interpretation that you're in white sand
[29:45] everything's all right it's you yourself
[29:48] nervous now listen to what he says and
[29:50] you let one member of the family get
[29:52] nervous it goes to the next member and
[29:54] the next member and the first thing
[29:56] you're all fussing and going on this is
[29:59] how tension builds it starts maybe with
[30:01] the dad out in the workforce and he
[30:03] comes home and the mother's been feeling
[30:04] pressure all day homeschooling cleaning
[30:06] the house and it's pressure upon
[30:08] pressure then the pressure is on the
[30:09] kids and all this pressure gets passing
[30:11] around one member's nervous and fussing
[30:13] then the next one's nervous and fussing
[30:15] then everyone's fussing he says one
[30:17] member of the family gets kind of upset
[30:19] about something it upsets the other and
[30:21] the other and the other and the first
[30:22] thing you know the whole family's upset
[30:25] come on somebody it's true it
[30:29] happens everybody's upset he says it's
[30:34] Satan hey that's who it is it's Satan
[30:38] that's done it and we got say well it
[30:40] was it was you Elliott you did it no it
[30:42] was you jack no you Eliz it's you PR no
[30:45] it's not who dead trust me it's dead
[30:47] it's
[30:48] Satan Satan's the one that's done this
[30:51] he's there working with the young ones
[30:53] he's there working with the mom he's
[30:54] there working with the dad he's putting
[30:56] pressure on all of us and as we begin to
[30:58] feel that pressure we get nervous and we
[30:59] begin to look at things a certain way we
[31:01] begin to respond a certain way next
[31:03] thing the whole family's upset he says
[31:05] it's Satan he says then if one member of
[31:07] the family rejoices let the rest of them
[31:09] Rejoice with it so every one of the
[31:12] family try to do that that was an answer
[31:15] to this lady in your situation you feel
[31:17] desperate you feel lost you feel like
[31:18] maybe something's wrong you feel like
[31:20] you're in sin you're groping in darkness
[31:22] now your son and his wife are groping in
[31:24] darkness and it just starts to feed and
[31:26] it feeds and it feeds he says if you
[31:28] have a reason to Rejoice rejoice and he
[31:31] says let the rest of the family do it
[31:33] and I said that's what we ought to do as
[31:35] a as Believers and in your own family
[31:38] things may be tough things may be dark
[31:40] things may be difficult but if one of
[31:42] you finds a reason to Rejoice start
[31:44] rejoicing and let the rest of us join in
[31:47] they're
[31:49] rejoicing whatever it might be if it's
[31:51] good health a good grade if it's an
[31:53] opportunity say oh that's great boy
[31:55] that's great honey that's awesome and it
[31:58] may not be yours it may not be your
[32:00] opportunity but if one of us rejoices
[32:03] let us all Rejoice
[32:05] together good medicine
[32:07] brother it brings you out of that
[32:10] groping Darkness he says let everyone in
[32:13] the family try to do
[32:14] that and
[32:16] now in Job chapter 29:
[32:22] 18 joob makes this Proclamation then I
[32:25] said as shall die in my
[32:28] nest and I shall multiply my days as the
[32:34] sand it's kind of a peculiar
[32:38] phrase but what job is talking about is
[32:40] something that's working deep within his
[32:42] heart his attitude is beginning to shift
[32:44] he still has some more conversations to
[32:46] go and and it's that final Reckoning
[32:48] with God that really sums it all up but
[32:50] job has something turning in his heart
[32:53] he's now Beginning to Look Beyond a
[32:55] situation Beginning to Look be beyond
[32:57] what he's currently going through
[32:58] looking beyond the dust looking beyond
[33:00] the ashes CU in Job chapter 19 as
[33:03] brother B called this he had a preview
[33:05] of the Resurrection he saw the the
[33:07] coming to the Lord he says for I know
[33:09] job
[33:11] 1925-26 I know that my redeemer
[33:16] liveth and that he shall stand at the
[33:18] latter day upon the Earth what a
[33:21] revelation says that lightning bolt that
[33:23] zigzag that Revelation that comes to him
[33:25] and he sees this and so he's standing
[33:27] there in the midst of his difficulties
[33:28] and even his accusers and there's
[33:30] something this Revelation that he has
[33:32] and in the moment it's not that
[33:33] everything is fixed and everything's
[33:35] fine but yet it becomes something that
[33:36] he revisits and here he says I I'll die
[33:39] in my nest and my days shall be
[33:40] multiplied as the sand and this is
[33:42] coming after he knows his redeemer
[33:45] lives and in the end his redeemer is
[33:48] going to be standing on the earth and he
[33:50] sees himself with him because he says
[33:53] and though after my skin worms destroyed
[33:56] this body if this dust returns to dust
[33:59] if this ash goes back to ashes if this
[34:02] body vaporize yet in my flesh I shall
[34:05] see God let this dust return to dust
[34:08] from the ground I come and the ground I
[34:10] return let these ashes that sit on this
[34:12] ash Heap let them dematerialize and
[34:15] break up and be deconstructed back into
[34:17] what they came from but one day I will
[34:19] rematerialize one day I'll rise again
[34:22] one day my redeemer will bring me
[34:25] back Hallelujah
[34:28] Lord he says I'll die in my Nest but my
[34:30] days will be multiplied as the
[34:32] sand in 1 Peter 5 chapter 10 but God the
[34:36] god of GRA of all Grace who have called
[34:39] us into his eternal glory by Jesus
[34:41] Christ that means there's going to be
[34:42] Redemption there's going to be glory
[34:45] after that ye have suffered a while make
[34:47] you perfect establ strengthen settle you
[34:50] so to him be glory and Dominion forever
[34:52] and ever amen though we may be in a
[34:56] great fixed though we may be troubled on
[34:58] every side we're to cast our cares upon
[35:00] Him because these anxious cares have a
[35:03] way of intoxicating us making us make
[35:05] decisions we otherwise wouldn't make say
[35:06] things we otherwise wouldn't do and so
[35:08] we need to be sober and Vigilant knowing
[35:10] that we have an enemy that's pressing us
[35:13] and because he's pressing us we need to
[35:15] resist him knowing that others are going
[35:17] through the same trouble and as I resist
[35:19] him I know that the god of Grace who's
[35:22] has called me to eternal glory and after
[35:24] I have suffered after I have resisted
[35:27] after I've endured this punishment after
[35:29] I've endured this trial after I've
[35:31] maintained my Integrity he'll make me
[35:33] perfect he'll establish me he'll
[35:35] strengthen me he'll settle me to him be
[35:38] glory and Dominion forever and
[35:41] ever
[35:43] Hallelujah he says I shall die in my
[35:46] Nest brother John if we could get that
[35:47] verse 18 again just look at
[35:50] that job 29:18 then I said I shall die
[35:53] in my nest and I shall multiply my days
[35:56] as the the
[35:58] sand there's
[36:00] in now notice it says I shall die in my
[36:03] nest and it says I shall multiply my
[36:06] days as the sand it's translated in
[36:08] several different translations I shall
[36:10] multiply my days as the phoenix
[36:14] bird it's in Jewish tradition in the
[36:17] Jewish Bible the complete Jewish Bible I
[36:20] said I will die with my nest and I will
[36:22] live as long as a
[36:23] phoenix and our Jewish publication
[36:26] Society old Testament then I said I
[36:27] shall die with my nest and I shall
[36:29] multiply my days as the Phoenix even the
[36:31] wickcliff Bible and The Lex lexum
[36:33] English Bible and I thought I will pass
[36:36] away in my nest and like the Phoenix I
[36:38] shall multiply my days what is job
[36:41] alluding
[36:42] to says I'll die in my nest and this is
[36:45] where we can see that this I die in my
[36:47] nest and I shall multiply my days as the
[36:49] Phoenix that answers to the nest see how
[36:52] it makes sense I'll die in my nest and
[36:54] then we we talk about the Sands of the
[36:56] earth and even the word that's used
[36:57] there uh the language is being used he
[36:59] says I shall multiply multiply my days
[37:02] as the phoenix bird it's that parallel
[37:03] claw to my nest and we know the myth of
[37:06] the Phoenix I trust some of you do the
[37:09] Phoenix sprang in one particular one
[37:11] sprang from a nest of myrrh a nest of
[37:14] myrr before his death that he made a
[37:17] nest that he makes before he dies so
[37:19] it's this Nest says it makes a nest of
[37:21] CA and frankincense and other spices
[37:23] then sets it on fire burns itself in it
[37:25] then out of its es comes forth an egg
[37:27] which produces another
[37:30] Phoenix the phrase says the Phoenix
[37:32] Burns in the fire and is Born Again from
[37:34] its
[37:35] ashes and that's what job's pointing to
[37:38] after he's seen his redeemer live he
[37:41] says I I I I I'll die in my nest and
[37:45] this cocoon if you want to call it that
[37:47] in this shelter that I make before I die
[37:49] I'm going to die but I will come back
[37:52] again amen I will rise again job is
[37:54] referring to an emblem of Resurrection
[37:56] he's referring to an emblem of of
[37:58] redemption and we say oh well that's
[37:59] Greek mythology it's this mythology and
[38:01] it comes from the Egyptians it comes
[38:02] from this and how every 500 years this
[38:05] bird would come and it would be in the
[38:06] temple of the Sun and there's a lot of
[38:08] Mythology that surrounds it but this is
[38:09] job talking about it and he's alluding
[38:11] to something that has this emblem Al
[38:13] though it may die it's going to rise up
[38:15] again from its own ashes out of these
[38:18] ashes he's going to rise again and this
[38:20] is what I'm wanting to express to you
[38:21] tonight when I say out of dust no matter
[38:24] what it looks like for you no matter
[38:25] what you're going through how ruined
[38:26] things may be no matter how far gone it
[38:28] may seem God is the one that's able to
[38:31] redeem From Ashes to redeem out of dust
[38:34] to take Rubble to take broken down
[38:36] stones to take destroyed walls take take
[38:38] destroyed relationships destroyed
[38:40] families destroyed Health it doesn't
[38:42] matter how far gone it is you could be
[38:43] in a grave for three days and God is
[38:45] able to raise you up again it doesn't
[38:47] matter how long your body's been in the
[38:49] ground thousands of years God is able to
[38:52] raise it again From the Ashes amen
[38:55] that's right out of the these ashes I'll
[38:57] rise I will be
[39:00] restored though I cast me into the Meer
[39:04] though I'm like dust in ashes he knows
[39:07] how to bring me forth I will
[39:11] overcome and so Job chapter 42:
[39:16] 1-6 job answered the Lord and said this
[39:19] was after some pretty good talking
[39:22] to I know that thou can't do everything
[39:28] I know you can do
[39:30] it and that no thought can be withholden
[39:32] from thee who is he that hideth counsel
[39:35] without knowledge there have I uttered
[39:37] that I understood not things too
[39:40] wonderful for me which I knew not here I
[39:42] beseech thee and I will speak I will
[39:43] demand of thee and declare thou unto me
[39:47] I have heard of thee by hearing of the
[39:49] ear but now mine ey seeth thee amen and
[39:54] then he says in this moment where for I
[39:57] abhor myself and repent in dust and
[40:02] Ashes Abraham said that he came for it I
[40:04] am but like dust but dust and Ashes he
[40:08] says it in Chapter 30 job does I have
[40:10] become like dust and Ashes so now this
[40:13] incredible symbolism as ashes and
[40:15] renting of clothes and this solemness
[40:18] they would try to express even in their
[40:19] clothing this idea of repenting
[40:21] associated with the ashes he says I I
[40:25] repent in dust and Ashes I
[40:29] Repent right here I Repent in this I
[40:33] Repent in my my my fleshling my
[40:36] carnality and it's from the dust that
[40:38] God raised Jo job
[40:41] up in his humility he repented in his
[40:44] suffering he
[40:46] repented I think there's a lesson for us
[40:49] that job he maintain his Integrity we
[40:52] don't do as good right we don't
[40:55] necessarily Curse God
[40:56] but we got a lot of questions we have we
[40:59] have
[41:00] issues God we've got grievances
[41:04] right and and we we don't like the way
[41:06] things have gone and it's not what we
[41:08] signed up for and there's a lot of
[41:09] things sometimes that we begin to doubt
[41:10] and we begin to worry we begin to fear
[41:12] but but here's the answer just
[41:15] repent God I know you can do
[41:18] anything I know you can do anything why
[41:22] do I fear why do I fret why do I worry
[41:25] you've got my best in mine you're a
[41:27] Lover of My Soul you take good care of
[41:29] me all my days you've been good to me I
[41:31] I have nothing to fear I have nothing to
[41:33] worry about I I I've heard of the by
[41:34] hearing of the ear but Lord I have seen
[41:36] your goodness now I see you so Lord I I
[41:39] I I abore myself for doubting I hope
[41:42] abore myself for acting out under
[41:44] pressure I abore myself for losing my
[41:45] Integrity I abore for panicking in the
[41:48] moment and not
[41:50] trusting there's a song I've heard
[41:52] recently where someone's just lamenting
[41:53] I don't want to be here I don't want to
[41:54] be I'm look at the stars and and that's
[41:56] where I want to be and and I feel
[41:58] Restless I just want to move I just want
[42:00] to go I just want take me anywhere but
[42:02] where I am right now but then finally
[42:04] the prayer is you know Lord I want to be
[42:06] at a place where I'm not always just
[42:08] chasing an escape I'm not always just
[42:11] looking for a way out I want to be in a
[42:13] place where I can finally say don't take
[42:15] me
[42:16] anywhere I want to be
[42:18] here don't take me anywhere but here
[42:21] this is where I want to be this is where
[42:23] I want to stand this is where I want to
[42:25] grow this is where I want to serve this
[42:27] is where I want to be oh I I want to
[42:29] come to that place where I can say I I
[42:31] know I know God can do everything I know
[42:34] I want to look back and say I know my
[42:36] redeemer lives listen this is what the
[42:38] message did for us it made God real it
[42:41] made him alive it showed it wasn't
[42:43] tradition it wasn't a cult it wasn't
[42:44] theology it wasn't denomination just
[42:46] wasn't a better way to live it was a
[42:48] living God who's alive who's with his
[42:50] people who perform signs and wonders who
[42:53] can do everything he's a God who can can
[42:56] still do everything we got to come back
[42:59] to I know my redeemer
[43:02] lives and out of
[43:05] dust out of dust I can
[43:07] rise amen and it says in verse 10 of
[43:11] that chapter the Lord turned the
[43:12] Captivity of job when he prayed for his
[43:15] friends and also the lord gave job twice
[43:18] as much as he had before then he came
[43:21] there up unto him all his Brethren and
[43:24] all his sisters and all they had that
[43:27] had acquaintance been acquaintance of
[43:29] before of his before and did eat bread
[43:31] and with him in his house and they
[43:33] bemoaned him and comforted him over all
[43:36] the evil the Lord had brought upon him
[43:39] every man also gave him a piece of money
[43:41] and everyone an earring of
[43:42] gold so the Lord blessed the latter end
[43:45] of job more than his
[43:49] beginning for he had 14,000 sheep 6,000
[43:53] camels a th000 yoke of oxen and a
[43:56] thousand she asses he also had seven
[43:59] sons and three
[44:01] daughters joob in the end is made
[44:05] whole he had twice as much as he had
[44:07] before the Lord blessed the latter end
[44:10] of job more than his
[44:11] beginning why because he brought him he
[44:14] he was with them his
[44:16] Redeemer even in that moment if you see
[44:18] job there in Job chapter 2 scraping
[44:20] boils he's near death his wife says just
[44:23] go ahead do it it's been leading to this
[44:26] moment all along anyways go ahead just
[44:27] do it turn away curse him give him yield
[44:32] die spiritually die give up why why why
[44:36] you keep why you keep pressing why are
[44:38] you gonna stick through it why you gonna
[44:40] try to stand go ahead do
[44:43] it do it and in that moment he said no I
[44:48] won't I won't do it and so he's a lesson
[44:51] to us no matter what dust you're on no
[44:55] matter what as ashes you're surrounded
[44:56] by you can look around and say though it
[44:58] may be me that feels like I'm vaporizing
[45:02] out of these ashes I can
[45:04] rise right out from the very thing
[45:07] that's that's burning me and breaking me
[45:09] down and vaporizing me I know my
[45:11] redeemer lives and if I if I if I die if
[45:15] I go to dust God's obligated to
[45:17] reassemble me again he's he's obligated
[45:21] to Raise Me
[45:22] Up God has a
[45:24] plan he'll take you out of dust he'll
[45:28] take you out of the trouble he'll take
[45:29] you out of the anxiety he's made you a
[45:32] promise I could read you scripture after
[45:33] scripture after scripture he will
[45:35] restore amen yes sir he will do it am
[45:39] it's the promise of the Old Testament
[45:40] it's the very picture that's painted the
[45:41] entire Bible though it may be in Ruins
[45:44] God is a Rebuilder God is a restorer God
[45:46] is a redeemer look at every picture
[45:48] every example we have in the Bible it it
[45:51] begins in chaos and then there's order
[45:53] then it's a perfect Eden and then it's
[45:54] Fallen God is is always showing no
[45:56] matter what happens no matter how dark
[45:59] it gets I will restore I'll bring it
[46:02] back again look at the end of The Bible
[46:04] and how he brings it to this great
[46:05] greater glory in the end it's a message
[46:07] to me and my problems right now it's a
[46:10] message to me and my difficulties right
[46:12] now though I may feel dusty though I may
[46:14] feel dirty though my life may feel like
[46:17] it's in rubble and ruin God is a builder
[46:20] God is a restorer God will make this
[46:23] live
[46:24] again

[49:14] you he looks at your dust and he says I
[49:16] can do something with
[49:18] this I can use this for
[49:21] good brother brandham continues he says
[49:24] no matter what takes place Christ is our
[49:25] refuge I'm skipping just a little bit in
[49:27] the sermon and when we come to him we
[49:30] can let off the
[49:31] pressure you can quit
[49:34] worrying about well if I die what's
[49:36] going to happen to me what's going to
[49:38] happen to the wife what's going to
[49:39] happen to the husband what's going to
[49:40] happen to the children just come to
[49:42] Christ and let off the pressure all he
[49:47] gives us all things that's what job said
[49:50] I know that I can do everything he gives
[49:52] us all things all things are ours by
[49:54] Christ so just let the pressure off the
[49:57] only one way you can do it somebody
[49:59] might give you a million dollars it
[50:01] would build up pressure I want you to
[50:03] think about that sometimes we think oh
[50:05] just if they could give out another
[50:06] Corona virus bonus or whatever that was
[50:09] if if I could just win the lot if I
[50:10] could just get this if I could just cash
[50:11] out the stocks if Bitcoin would just go
[50:13] to $90,000 whatever it might be we think
[50:16] oh if it this would just work you know
[50:18] what let's be honest it only builds more
[50:20] pressure when we look for the world to
[50:23] relieve our pressure and we reach for it
[50:25] itre increases our pressure when we look
[50:26] to others to relieve our pressure and we
[50:28] get it it only increases our pressure
[50:30] there's no relief from pressure outside
[50:32] of Christ it's in him and him alone
[50:35] someone could give you a million dollars
[50:37] you oh that'll settle all my problems no
[50:39] it's going to make it
[50:40] [Music]
[50:42] worse you might join a church and it
[50:45] would still build up pressure hey if we
[50:48] thought that all we had to do is start a
[50:49] church in Phoenix right and then we we
[50:52] just all be pressure free what this has
[50:55] been an experiment to prove that's not
[50:57] true changing churches doesn't change
[51:01] pressure he says Comm because the
[51:03] Methodist will tell you they're right
[51:04] and the Baptist is wrong and the Baptist
[51:05] say they're wrong and you're right so it
[51:07] just builds up more pressure because you
[51:09] don't know where you're
[51:11] standing he says but if you ever come to
[51:14] Christ you can let off the
[51:17] pressure because it's all over
[51:19] then just settle it
[51:22] down just settle it down let's SLE
[51:25] something
[51:28] tonight he says it's God's provided
[51:30] place of
[51:32] safety where God said the name of the
[51:34] Lord is like a mighty tower is what his
[51:36] text was coming from in some of these
[51:38] sermons The Righteous run into it and
[51:40] they're
[51:41] safe you know what you know what it
[51:43] means to be safe you
[51:45] just you just let you you breathe
[51:48] again you ever been when you're under
[51:50] pressure what happens some sometimes you
[51:51] tense up you tighten up your jaw gets a
[51:53] little bit tighter your neck gets
[51:54] tighter your shoulder you don't even
[51:55] feel it but everything just tenses up
[51:57] you'll start holding your
[51:59] breath you won't breathe normally you
[52:02] just you hold your breath but when
[52:04] you're
[52:05] safe there's this relaxing you let go of
[52:09] the tension you let go of everything
[52:11] that's building I'm safe so it says in
[52:14] the time of sickness when sickness
[52:16] strikes and the doctor says there's
[52:17] nothing else I can do about it don't
[52:19] build up pressure let off the pressure
[52:23] call your pastor call him
[52:26] do it let him anoint you in oil and pray
[52:29] over you prayer of faith shall save the
[52:32] sick he comes right back to the word let
[52:34] off the pressure he is our refuge while

[52:58] pressure in depression in in economic
[53:01] woes and whatever it might be don't
[53:03] build pressure let off
[53:06] pressure cuz he can out of
[53:10] dust raise you
[53:13] up I I I felt
[53:16] so impressed to speak this
[53:19] tonight even if it would be an interrupt
[53:21] from what we've been ministering on to
[53:23] encourage you tonight on this night with
[53:24] those we're here to encourage you
[53:26] tonight that he's able to do
[53:30] anything and and the pressures we're
[53:32] experiencing the directions we're being
[53:33] pushed the way we're being pulled the
[53:35] way that we're fearing the way that
[53:36] we're being overwhelmed we need to stand
[53:38] still brother bam says stand still take
[53:42] a deep breath sit down and think it over
[53:45] not analyze not
[53:47] interpret but cast your cares on him and
[53:50] recognize that that enemy is pushing
[53:53] he's pushing he's pushing to try to get
[53:56] you not to curse God but to deny his
[53:58] will fight against his plan or his
[54:01] purpose despair for life but let's have
[54:03] the kind of confidence tonight that no
[54:05] matter what happens Satan you may push
[54:08] me and push me until I
[54:10] vaporize but God's obligated to raise me
[54:13] up and you've got a promise because you
[54:15] know what you're a special kind of
[54:17] dust the more pressure he turns on you
[54:21] the closer you get to being that diamond
[54:23] that's right that can only be form form
[54:25] Med through
[54:26] pressure and if we'll just trust him
[54:29] just trust
[54:31] him he can do all things amen we have
[54:35] our heads
[54:36] bowed I'd like to pray for you but I
[54:39] would want to encourage some response to
[54:41] the word
[54:42] [Music]
[54:46] tonight not to satisfi sat satisfy
[54:49] myself not to take a poll or show
[54:52] hands so I can feel that what I've
[54:54] preached is has been effective I don't
[54:57] need
[54:59] that I don't need it I I I know that
[55:01] I've obeyed the Lord in speaking this
[55:04] but I want you to respond to
[55:07] God it was CS Lewis that said in his
[55:10] deepest darkest struggles and trials he
[55:13] said it wasn't God performing some
[55:15] experiment on my
[55:17] life to test me to see what I was made
[55:20] of and I know I've read it number of
[55:23] times to you already so maybe some of
[55:25] you remember it he says I God wasn't
[55:27] testing me so he could know what I was
[55:29] made of he said he knew all
[55:32] along he said it was I who occupied the
[55:36] jury box and the witness stand it was I
[55:38] who was being exempt it was I who had to
[55:39] make the
[55:41] decision and so tonight if you
[55:45] could find some honesty before the
[55:48] Lord and in your dust and
[55:51] Ashes speak to him as Abraham said he
[55:54] was
[55:56] I will now speak unto the Lord me who am
[56:01] but dust and Ashes me who's been cast
[56:04] into the mire and become like dust and
[56:06] Ashes it'll be me who now repents in
[56:09] dust and Ashes and says Lord I know that
[56:13] you can do
[56:16] everything I know Lord that you can do
[56:18] everything and if God has spoken in
[56:20] particular to you tonight could you just
[56:22] open your heart to him and say Lord here
