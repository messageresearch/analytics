TRANSCRIPT
========================================
my title as you can see from this slide is ruined and it is drawn from this particular scripture and from a number of different scriptures that I've been reading over the past several weeks and how that there is an image of God and that image can be marred there is something that God has tried to accomplish that Satan is trying to destroy and there's a lot of different themes that you could pull through this and there's a lot of different ways that we could express it we have been using the subject of Art and there is a Concept in art where ruins can be romanticized and there can be something beautiful about it maybe something nostalgic or vintage but that's not what I'm referring to I'm not talking about something uh through the passage of time becoming Antiquated and desirable to see and and admire the beauty of the ruins but rather we're talking about something that has been destroyed it's derel it's been been abandoned and uh if we could just turn here to Proverbs chapter 24 and and start with verse 21 I'll just read our text again it says my son fear thou the Lord and the king I think that's a critical component and then it says and meddle not with them that are given to change and I want to look at that part uh here in a moment for their Calamity which is their distress or burden shall rise suddenly now it doesn't mean that as soon as they are as soon as they change or they're given to change immediately something happens but he's saying that there their burden their distress it's going to happen and when it happens it'll happen quickly and who knoweth the ruin of them both this ruin is a disaster or destruction that's where I'm getting my title ruined from something that has been uh destroyed something that has been torn down and this as it speaks of this burden and this ruin that would come it says meddle not with them that are given to change and that word their change times is interpreted as repeated or a second time but here the meaning is those who alter or those who uh disg even disguise themselves they have some other motive some other uh directive uh the scripture even speaks in a sense of a rebellion so those that are given to change they are altered they are disguised in First Kings 14:2 and jeroboam said to his wife arise I pray thee and disguise thyself that thou be not known to be the wife of Jobo that's that word change disguise yourself and uh act in a manner dress in a manner to where people don't know who you are be very inconspicuous and I was thinking of this and how would one dress in a way to disguise themselves to not be known to be job's wife and she may have laid aside garments that spoke of royalty she may have dressed in a way that presented herself as very poor maybe she even went so far as to try to address in a way where you couldn't tell that she was a woman at all but that's the word there go and change yourself so that you're not recognized in Genesis chapter 38 I'll I'll ju I'll I'll pause right here we have been ministering on uh Wednesday night we spoke on dress codes the last time we ministered on Sunday uh I can't remember what the title was then uh but it was we used Deuteronomy chapter 22 and we're showing the foundation as to why God says it's a those that wear the Garment of another the other gender opposite gender they are Abomination so I'm still continuing on that on that subject so we'll be coming to it here just in a moment and he so it says and it and it was told Tamar saying Behold thy father-in-law goeth up to Timnath to sheare his sheep and she put her uh she put her Widow garments off from her so she was dress in a way to signal to signify I'm a widow I'm grieving I've lost my husband so she's changed ing her apparel and covered her with a veil and wrapped herself and sat in an open place which is by the way to Timnath for she saw that Shayla was grown and she was not given unto him the wife so she was was married to a son of Judah and when he died she was she should have been granted according to the law she should have custom she should have been granted to marry the younger brother when he came of age so that the seat of her husband could continue and so she's using this game of deception and and you can go and read the whole story as to how she accomplished it and it says in verse 15 when Judas saw her he thought her to be a harlot because she had covered her face whereas at one time she was wearing garments to say that I am a woman that has lost my husband I'm wearing the garments of a widow and I'm grieving uh she now wore something to Signal the character that she wanted to assume she could wear a Widow's garments and expect her father-in-law to say hey would you come and come with me and let us go be together she had to dress in a way that would signify to one who saw her that this is the character that I have this is the character I'm trying to assume to accomplish this objective so she changed the way she looked the Bible is saying medal not with them that are given to change as one would disguise themselves or cause themselves to here in a way that they really aren't it says meddle not with them this word meddle uh to meddle not means to do not share with them or have fellowship with those that rebel against God as it says my son fear thou the Lord and the King it's not even if you can catch this it's not telling you not to be given to change you notice that it's assuming that that would already be established in your hearts to not be given to change so it says don't even meddle with them that are given to change we ourselves should not be rebellious against Authority we should not be rebellious against the Lord fear the lord and the king and those that do not fear the lord and those that would not fear Authority he says do not have fellowship with them or communion with them do not share with them now I realize that in using that language it could suggest that you you just ignore them you have nothing to do with them but you are not to be a partner with those who are given to change if there are those who are rebellious and those who are disguising themselves and those who do not fear the lord you do not want to be lumped in with them I think I saw some years ago one of these uh laugh thing there there's no I think it was in a doctor's office or something there's no there's no uh dialogue you just see the image and somebody's walking down a narrow alley and as they're walking all of a sudden a bunch of protesters come out behind them and then the police come out on the other side and they're kind of pranking the person who's walking along down the alley and they look guilty that they're leading this protest and the police are about to arrest everybody because they're in the mob and if I could say this it's one thing to be pranked it's another thing for you to join the mob or to be a part of something that is signaling that is protesting that is rebelling and the Bible says that we ought not to have fellowship or to be share with those who are given to change James 4: 4 it says ye adulterers and adulteresses this is a very important uh phrase adulterers and adulteresses know ye not that the Friendship of the world is enity with God it's remarkable that he is addressing an adulterer and reminds them that friendship of the world is enity with God there's some relationship between those who would actually commit adulter Y in a physical sense to Those who commit adultery in a spiritual sense that it's through the Friendship of the world and he says to be friends with the world is to be opposed or against God whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God when it says meddle not with them that are given to change there's some sort of connection and fellowship and identification or friendship with those that are given to change where you would be identified with them by the way that you look and your behavior and Bible says meddle not with them that are given to change and we could say it this way do not have friendship or communion or common this commonality with the with the world that's right 1 Thessalonians 5:22 abstain from all appearance of evil those things that you would see Son of God turn your head those things that you would uh display yourself you you ought not to do it and he's addressing adulterers those who are Unfaithful or derelict those who abandon their Duty fear thou the Lord and the word fear thou the Lord and the King fear Authority respect God and those who would not fear God or be faithful they would be the adulterers Unfaithful derelict in their Duty it's speaking of according the favor and if I can say this way according favor with the world or Conformity to the world is a declaration of war against God uses a very strong word enity it's not saying that God's kind of like that's a little sus he's saying no I hate that this is you're standing against me you're opposing me so according the favor of the world or Conformity with the world is standing against and opposing God James chapter 1: 27 says pure religion and undefiled before God and the father is this I love just how simple this is to visit the fatherless and widows and their Affliction and to keep himself unspotted from the world as we may not make it a practice of visiting the fatherless and the widows in their distress or in their need and as Society maybe has grown to a place to where the the the necessity of the local church or the Saints or even within our religion and our extended communities maybe that responsibility doesn't fall on us but I will say that this is an everyday duty of religion pure and undefiled before God is to keep ourselves unspotted from the world unspoiled or unstained Not blemished by the world in 1 John chap 2: 1516 and 17 and be a very uh just plotting through scripture today I was told Wednesday night that I set a record for the number of scriptures that I was you used in a service and I I didn't know there was a they were keeping track so now I kind feel compelled to break my PR I love not the world neither the things that are in the world it's very clear friendship of the world is enity with God those that will be a friend of the world is an enemy of God so love not the world neither the things that are in the world now in addressing subjects such as uh dress code and how a woman would dress and how a man would dress and you begin to identify things that relate to our appearance and it may seem to be somewhat restrictive and I think the way that a lot of us sometimes have either experienced this or utilized it it's been very kind of costic or judgy like did you see the length of that person's skirt or did you does their hair look trimmed and we're kind of always judging instead of examining ourselves and being Guided by the Holy Spirit as to what's taught in a way that we'd please the Lord or or those that we are uh joined with uh we kind of look at other people and we have our own measuring stick and so so I'm walking through this scripture so that you could see that there's a way and we'll show some others there's a way that there's truth that cannot be there is a truth that is unassailable though we deny it we we reject it at our own Peril and I believe it's a very clear truth in scripture in terms of the behavior of a man and a woman and the way that we ought to appear as Christians now there may be again some debate in there in terms of what you might think is modest and what you might think is Holy but I believe the word of God set some very clear parameters in that but regardless of what we would arrive at as this is how a woman should dress this is how a man should dress and if that was truth there's still a way that you can hold that truth the wrong way and use it as a weapon as as opposed to a resource love not the world neither the things that are in the world if any man love the world the love of the father is not in him for all that is in the world the big three the lust of the Flesh and the lust of the eyes and the pride of life this is what encapsulates all those negative influences in the world all those tendencies All Those passions all those displays it's either the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes or the pride of life it was what was in the beginning in the temptation of the woman it was what was in the garden in the Temptation Of Christ or in the wilderness and the Temptation Of Christ it's what we face today in Satan's Eden the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life and these things the scripture says are not of the father but is of the world and the world passeth away and the lust thereof but he that doeth the will of God abideth forever there's your passing away you're changing you're altering the the world will pass away the lust change if you study the uh parameters of what was beautiful and what's desirable you'll find that there's some sort of cycle over a period of time is this is what is attractive and this isn't and this is what's desirable and this isn't and it TRS in fashion and it tracks in all sorts of levels in all sorts of different ways it changes it's always variable but he that does the will of God will abide forever because the will of God never changes God has a perfect will God's word will never change Heaven and Earth will pass away but God's word will never fail and as it's asking us to love not the world we know that there's a difference between as we might say agape love and fio love and how that this love of God or Agape Love Is the Love of intelligence and reason that has a corresponding purpose so it has a higher intelligence that's the intelligence of God and it it it's attached with a purpose beautiful example John 3:16 for God so loved the world it doesn't say period the end and we we have this directive that God having loved the world he just loved it says God so loved the world that he gave so that love that God would have has a corresponding purpose because it's a love of higher intelligence not just like God had feelings uh for the world it had it was a love of higher intelligence and it had a corresponding purpose that having loved his own he loved him under the end and so he taught them and he he reached out to them there's things that he did to express that love whereas that human love or we might say Pho love filio Love Is the Love of just personal affection or liking and it has no intelligence behind it or no higher purpose even if it is required so there may be the need for in that situation the corresponding purpose but if you just have F love even though it might be required by that relationship it doesn't have one and I I I realize I'm losing a lot of time just by walking through this but I think it's very important to be part of the fabric of what we're going forward God never had fio love for the world fi love he didn't have that love for the sinful world because God hates or abominates the sinful world all that is in the world the lust of the eyes the lust of the Flesh and the pride of life God hates they are not of God so God doesn't love that and in that sense we're not asked to have the fan love for our enemies or to love our enemies with this F love but to love with the love of God is what we're asked to do it's not filo love as we could say it towards the enemy or towards the world but he asked us to have agape love the agape love that we're to have it's a love of the world which comprehends what is wrong it's a love of those who are sinning it's a love for things that that are are deformed or perverted it's a love which comprehends and knows it has the intelligence of what is wrong in order to sanctify it and to convert it or to change it amen that if something is in fact ruined or something has been in fact destroyed uh and and there might be some sort of abomination that we ought to have a love for the thing it that that had that understands its need we can say hate the hate the sin Love The Sinner absolutely it's very hard sometimes to separate the sin from The Sinner it's very difficult to see someone doing something with a particular attitude and not just kind of paint the whole person inside and out with that brush and say I don't like him at all right amen but we ought to have the kind of love which comprehends at the core what is wrong so that we would pray that God would change the situation we can love somebody who's deeply in error we can love somebody who's rebellious against the word of God and we would want to have the intelligence or the mind of God to pray that God would change them not just say ah who cares because God cares Jude 23 says and others Sav with fear this is incumbent upon us that we would have in some situation This Love This driving force that would pull them out of the fire and why is it that we would pull them out of the fire we hate even the Garment spotted by the flesh that we have we have this hate this DET detestation this abomination of the Garment spotted by the flesh spoiled by carnality this is how that we ought to be with that kind of love this kind of character and disposition we pull some from the fire saving them as it were because we hate just even if the Garment is spotted by the flesh the Bible says in Malachi 3:6 let me so give meddle not with them that are given to change these things that we're showing here the character of an unchanging God I am the Lord I change not Hebrews chapter 10: excuse me Hebrews chapter 1: 10 to 12 and thou Lord in the beginning Hast laid the foundation of the earth and the heavens are the works of thine hands they Shall Perish but thou remainest they all shall wax old as doth a garment and as a vesture shalt thou fold them up and they shall be changed we could see that about the worlds and the foundation thereof Heaven and Earth shall pass away but the word will never pass away We Know that heaven and Earth is going to be completely renewed and restored that which has been ruined will be restored they will be changed but thou God is never ruined Thou Art the same and thy years shall not fail even as we look at this as vestures will folded up and they're changed and rment will W wax old Fashions change Styles become outdated garments themselves will Decay but God never changes right really in one sense I believe brother Paul was telling me a story and they mentioning how that for him he realizes their Church isn't the cool church and I was like Hey neither are we we're kind of sister churches uh we're not the cool church either he said but he told his church but cool kids go to hell I was like whoa all right okay glad not to be a cool kid but there's a uh there's a way that we could say it to the Christian God's never out of style Christ Christianity the if our measurement of Christ and our understanding of Christ to something that we're constantly redefining so that he's relevant in a modern society then that's not Christ cuz he's never out of style though the Fashions May though the way that we dress may change through different periods and we might if we were Christians long ago we might all we would obviously look very very different seeing that Nike hadn't been invented yet and certain Styles and they didn't have these hybrid things like you know 97% cotton 3% spandex right it's like there's different things you could wear now that they didn't even know existed at the time so yes things would be different but Christ would still be in style to a believer in Romans 1: 18 I'm going to read to verse 32 I think I cut this short I might pick up on it later for the wrath of God is revealed from Heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who hold the truth in unrighteousness that given the truth seeing the truth having an opportunity to understand or hear the truth that our response to it falls short of what we ought to do mixing what we hear with faith embracing it as the truth and God is saying I it is AB mination to me for the truth to be held in unrighteousness my wrath is going to be revealed against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men meddle not with them that are given to change I believe this scripture begins to describe these circumstances because that which may be known of God is Manifest in them for God hath shown it unto them for the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen being understood by the things that are made even his eternal power and godhead so that they are without excuse because that when they knew God they glorified him not as God neither were thankful remember fear the lord meddle not with them that are given to change but became vain in their imaginations and their foolish heart was darkened professing themselves to be wise they became fools notice this in verse 23 and changed the glory of the uncorruptible god into an image made like to corruptible man this could be this is in the uh the fashion of worshiping an idol worshiping a man or as it says into birds and forf footed beast and creeping things that there was a deifying of those things which were clearly not God but created by God and that they looked for deity or the Divine or the Eternal or the supernatural in a man or in creation and not God and where this is identified the most is in that man begin to worship himself and began to see himself as wise and became Vain and shallow and empty in his imagination and through his Foolish Heart becoming dark and becoming he's lifted up in Pride to deify himself and to worship himself could be argued that even the worship of another man or a bird ultimately is self- serving wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lust of their own Hearts God AB they're abandoned to it they are derel about God so God abandons them and they begin to dishonor their own bodies between themselves who changed the truth of God into a lie and worshiped and served the creature more than the Creator who is blessed forever amen the wrath of God is revealed on these and we see in the scripture that Calamity shall rise suddenly to those or for those who alter God's glory those that ch change the order of God's program those that Mar the image of God when we defile I want to say it this way when we defile God's image we're ruined when we change the order that God desires us to be in it becomes this ruining it's this process of Decay and destruction we become that work of God that has been marred or been spoiled there something that God made to be beautiful even the Bible goes to Great Lengths to say that when a man had found a wife he had found a good thing and that the that marriage is Honorable before God and there's a beauty then in humanity there's a beauty in creation God is even saying here in Romans chapter 1 that creation testifies of the glory of God and there's a way then that that beauty becomes marred it becomes uh destroyed it becomes perverted and the the image of God is no longer available or is no longer seen by through our own works and though there is a a Divine spark or there's something in man something great in man and I've seen it in my heart to see that if there's any good in man we've got to give God the glory that any goodness is of God that it does not arise organically within man but we'd have to trace it back to something about God that still reverberates even in those who don't believe in God but they're decent and they're honest and they treat people with respect but when we defile the image of or we forsake the will of God we become ruined we're no longer reflecting the purpose of God in Deuteronomy chapter 22:5 I hope that Foundation helps us to go um to go deeper into this subject here in Deuteronomy chapter 22:5 the woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man neither shall a man put on a woman's garment I believe the scripture is very clear we know that this is in the context of the Old Testament in a list of other various laws but this one is qualified by saying for all that do so the person who would wear the Garment of the opposite gender is abomination unto the Lord thy God right we used uh deceptive form as the title when we first addressed this and to dress and to act like the opposite gender is a form of deception I think this helps us understand why the devil's trying to cause so much confusion where we live today where there's people can identify as something other than what is even possible and that there's more there's this multiplicity or sliding scale of genders and there's gender identities that different people can have and what just several years ago was a diagnosable mental illness they have now changed through political pressure and and trying to be more accomodating they' changed it to say no these aren't uh these aren't uh textbook uh mental illnesses these are just uh this isn't gender dysmorph this is just people this is the way that we are as humans and I it's incredibly fascinating just kind of throwing this out there we can discuss this maybe later in a breakout session but as soon as they remove all those classifications from the DSM what's happened all the other mental illnesses are on the rise we have more mental illness than we've ever had before even as they're trying to remove de designations more are cropping up so how long is it until they finally just say you know being crazy isn't crazy you know being depressed you you identify as Eeyore that's fine and they begin to just take these things out and it just everyone gets their their medication but it's a there is a these things for someone to I I guess I need to back out of that that going down that trail that I think this is one of the reasons why there's so much confusion because if if the devil can get us debating uh uh these political points we miss the point that there is a there's air in not being what God made you to be it's Abomination it's a disgusting thing to God by nature and design male and female are different we looked at that in the scripture and therefore being different by Nature man now being clothed by the direction of God it is necessary and it's proper to honor those differences in the way that we dress the Garment itself the scripture saying is not the Abomination but the person perverting their form is abomination now I'd like to spend maybe the remainder of our morning on uh kind of these two points that God and there's other ways that we could build this but I want you to see this very clearly in scripture some of it will be reviewed some of it will be further stepped for a man to dress like a woman or a woman to dress like a man it violates two different principles in the word of God the principle of a role of the individual the gender the role of sex or the headship and identification so it's that principle of roles the principle of relationship to one another and it's a principle of modesty or if I can say sexual attraction in 1 Peter chapter 3: 1 to five we'll just read to verse five I may have had six there but it says likewise ye wives be in subjection to your own husbands now this isn't a force subjection this subjection that is asked of the wife is one in which she voluntarily uh uh serves together with and subjects herself to her husband as the head it's not the same type of subjection that children are asked to give their parents children having no autonomy or no Free Will and even some cases the the no capacity whatsoever to to accomplish their own will uh they are asked to submit with great emphasis than the woman cuz the woman she is a woman she's an adult but she's asked to submit in an arrangement and an order to her husband that if any obey not the word they also May without the word be won by the conversation of the wives you see the clear intent that by having a healthy relationship with your unbelieving husband your submission to him your aiding your your help your togetherness your continuity will win them right while they behold your chased conversation coupled with fear who's adorning this woman who is in subject to her husband so this adornment is spoken of in context of her relationship and her role and her identification to her husband her adorning let it not be the outward adorning of platting the hair and of wearing of gold or putting on of apparel that should not be her Cosmos that should not be her world if she's a married woman and she spends all her time dolling herself up wouldn't be much of a Ministry or continuity or friendship or fellowship with the husband some maybe just pure logic we could give here the husband looks at his wife and he's like where are you going at 9:30 in the morning I'm just going to fries it's like dress like that and I guess anymore we don't think twice about it pretty soon all of us are going to be wearing yoga pants let it not be the outward adorning but let it be the hidden man of the heart so now it speaks to something within the woman's character in that which is not corruptible even the ornament the adorning the dress the fashion of a Meek and quiet Spirit which is in the sight of God of great price that which God values the opposite of abomination for after this manner in Old Time the holy women also who trusted in God first trusted in God not their husbands right guys we realize maybe we're not the most trustworthy character but trust in God God bless you brother for raising your hand I got someone who's a partner with me right there we we maybe our lives and our testimony do not speak of you could trust him at all times and maybe we get what we ask for but trusting in God you can Adorn yourself in your fashion in your dress the way that you do your hair the way that you present yourself the way that what things you wear being in in the context of your subjection to your own husband what's it showing that the reason why God would say it's Abomination to me for a woman to dress like her husband or to dress like a man it's because they are to they are set in relationship to their husband it's part of their togetherness it's part of their Oneness in Ezekiel chapter 16 verse3 use uh it's God is using the example of this kind of woman to show Israel what they're being very literally in their relationship to God and with other nations how weak is thine heart Peter is admonishing this believing woman that she be strengthened the inner man to where it is the hidden man of the heart which is a Meek and quiet spirit that that's her world that's what she's projecting that is what is at the Forefront so God says how weak is thine heart sayith the Lord God seeing thou doest all these things and you can go back and read the Litany of things that they were doing and they're described as the work of an imperious horish woman quite a mouthful another way of saying it would be a dominating Unfaithful female imperious means domineering it's the work these things are the work this unfaithfulness the work of a domineering a woman who is out of her place a woman who is now acting through Rule and through Authority through force and intimidation perhaps manipulation acting upon her own lust or for her own gain this dominating spirit that is horish and that's a very strong word but it means unfaithful to in their relationship ER in their vow these things that the scripture speaks of to say that a woman should dress a certain way and a man should dress a certain way has to do with what they are by nature and the way that they're positioned and ordered with the opposite gender and their relationships even in the relationship to their children therefore I could say that Christians ought to dress in a manner that complements their nature and their purpose and here we're seeing that's in relationship to their spouse now I just debated on just how much detail to get into here and um I'll cue this next slide up brother John once we get there just not sure where this will land but if we could just say uh the I saw a single panel comic one time where a a mailman was delivering a letter and it says it's addressed to the elephant in the room and there was an elephant in the room and so let's just mention the elephant pants trousers slacks the with respect to Western Society where we liveed to Western civilization and what we would call slacks or trousers or pants I'm not um getting into things in the Eastern Society but I'm only mentioning this for your edification to recognize how some of these principles relate when it comes to wearing pants it has become it became more socially acceptable for a woman to wear pants once they begin to enter the workforce prior to that it was not even a question and in 2018 we'll go ahead queue it up right here in 2018 there was an article now this is on me don't worry in 2018 there was an article I think an InStyle magazine I don't know some of you all get there get instu I don't but this was the headline of the magazine or this was one of the Articles did you know women could be arrested for wearing pants in public up until 1940 now of course all the witches would say that that's the patriarchy right and that's what we're trying to burn down that's what we're trying to destroy but the reality was that even some things were legislated and against the law for a woman not to wear pants even up to the 1940s thank you brother John that's just something for you to consider in the 1920s as I've been reading through some of these fashion uh these books on fashion and the histories of these things it the statement was made that after the first the Great War we call it the fir the world war first world war world one that after the destruction and Devastation of that time you had what was the Roaring 20s and and there was kind of a change in society and they said that himym lines Rose from the floor to the ankles and continue to rise from there on up and that you in the 20s you had uh if you want to kind of maybe you could read I think all of us probably had to read great G read The Great Gatsby if we went to public school and what's the image of that the flapper girl and they're actually trying to throw off a feminine look and and so uh the they wore uh real cylinder clothing and bulky boots that are untied and they cut their hair and they wore hats and there was somewhat of this boyish flapper look where they're rebelling against their femininity and that begins this process of changing the way the woman would dress to where it by the 1940s as that article detailed what was once scandalous became acceptable fashion for women at one time it was scandalous then as you evolve into the 60s and I know I'm jumping a couple decades each there there were these social and cultural factors that influenced fashion that paved the way for our what have become our modern societal Norms where now there's such a plurality of of representation and expression and what it what it was identified as is you had this particular look and role of a woman in the history of our nation from the 1700s and the 1800s and as women begin to enter the workforce in the early 1900s and as Society begin to change from agrarian to more uh uh City Life and Industrial life there was this throwing off of and rejecting of what they called These Old stuffy views and certainly if you saw the way that women dressed uh for social reasons and dressed with it even within the home you'd find that it would be really hard to be a good secretary in an office if you're wearing a dress that kind of poop out to here how big would the office need to be and so there was a change and apparel to adapt to their entering into the workforce and you'll find that what necessitated birth control was women working prior to that it wasn't NE the the glorification of it or the ne necessity of it or this this path for a woman to succeed corporately so to speak in order once that was open in order for her to be able to to go down that path she couldn't run the risk of being out for a while and that gave rise to birth control this is not a Christian proposition this is an academic fact and what began to rise is this individualism and self-expression where you could dress how you want act how you want you could pursue the things that you desired to pursue and it might come as a shock to you that on January 31st 2013 just 12 years ago my math may be off a little bit but just roughly 12 years ago it became legal finally in France for women to wear trousers it had been illegal all that time and the law specifically required for women to get permission from the police to in their words dress as a manow I I know sometime our relationship with the French is always changing not the Canadian not keka but the you know the France Frenchies right a relationship with them's always changing we want can to stay Canada but Quebec's always wanted to be Quebec so Trump could have the rest of them right but there's there is this their their own laws spoke that to wear pants was a garment that pertained to a man and if you were to wear it you had to have specific permission or you could get arrested this all connects back to how our manner of dress or our garments reflect our our nature and ought to reflect our calling and our relationship I could s spend more time on that part of the role that a man has as the reason why a man should uh be a certain way even in the way that he dresses and the way that he acts and it's out of respect for his wife and the same is a way that a woman ought to dress and act and it's out of respect for her husband we'll continue in this so that it doesn't leave anybody out in terms of of what the particulars may be of your marital status but in 1 Timothy 2: 9 and 10 it says in like manner also that women Adorn themselves in modest apparel that's a very straightforward matter of fact statement women should dress modestly we could debate what is modest we may even debate what is inm modest and we might just come to the conclusion as some Supreme Court justices have to say I know it when I see it but it is a fact that a woman is to dress modestly and not just modestly but to do it with shamefacedness and sobriety I'm sure we've all found ourselves in situation where someone may have been dressed for all intented purposes appropriate for the occasion and somewhat modest but we found that there was no shamefacedness or sobriety and that goes on to describe certain things that were also mentioned in Peter as far as braided hair or gold or pearls or costly array a woman should Adorn themselves in modest apparel and it is it's written to say and not with broaded hair not with gold or pearls or costly arrate there's a lot to consider there a lot to try to figure out just how that would look today but they ought to Adorn themselves with good works they ought to dress in a way that is a good work but adorned but with which becometh women professing godliness Adorn themselves with good works women should Adorn themselves dress cover themselves with modest well arranged seamly it's fitting of good appearance for something to be modest it's suited to the purpose for which they are dressed and for their character this is why I think when brother brandom has asked certain questions about you know is it okay for the kids to wear this and is it okay for a woman to wear this to go to bed and brother br's like why are you asking all these questions I want not to consider what is appropriate in terms of for the purpose and for the occasion one would dress themselves modestly somebody who lives by themselves and all alone may may be able to conduct themselves in a way that is modest for being all alone in your home but if you have children you might want to give more thought as to how you would dress at home so modesty has to do with a fitting appearance it's suited for your purpose but also your character the very purpose of clothing is to surround or cover the body that's what God gave them clothes for in the very beginning man and I don't know if I'll have time to get to this man in the beginning just used a loin cloth and consider themselves our nakedness is covered God said that's not what clothes ought to do clothing should surround and cover the body but with that the purpose that dress ought to cover the body dress can also disclose and discover the body you following me stick with me here and everybody who majored in fashion in college get behind me now clothing will cover the body but clothing can also be used to discover the body garments have a particular power to articulate the flesh there's a way that things could be worn in ways that garments could be structured to where it causes Allure or it draws attention I want to be one of those come on somebody preachers or amen preachers but I need a little help right now it's getting late on there is a way that we can choose to dress that draws attention and I'm not just speaking in terms of color and I'm not just talking about in terms of such uniqueness that we could maybe spend some time later and that there was a way that people dressed just so that they could express how rich they were there was a law I believe it was in France that b anybody but royalty from wearing boots or high heels and so that you could just by looking down no this guy is big stuff and there was a black market for you know shoes with hills then but this was this was a dress can be conspicuous conspicuous spending status symbols I've always wanted to own a very rare Supreme hoodie just so that by the chance that anyone's you know old enough yet now to know what that might be might be like whoa Is that real is that a legit one like I think so paid 20 bucks for it things that kind of catch the eye and a woman's apparel the Bible is saying here should not appeal to the lust of the eyes it's this is this is the world as we already read this this world the world is not to be lusted after by you that is not the the world that should not become your world nor are the things of the world what you should be Desiring and you do not want to be lusted after by the world so Paul is teaching that we ought to give care and he's saying this to the women to not dress and this is the phrase that I found from a a fashion writer a form of objectification in service of the male gaze you dress in a way where you can be objectified in order to serve a man looking at you this is how the Fashion World to describe the Advent and the rise of pants and other things that would expose shoulder or mid drift or form that these things were done as a form of objectification in service of the male gaze that it would cause one to look and to desire to get their attention for 1 Corinthians 6: 18 to2 it says flee fornication a lot of ways that we could and this these scriptures could be unpacked to Great length in them of themselves that hurtful scandalous behavior that is Unbecoming of a Christian this fornication here is an uncleanness of one's Spirit it speaks to a physical uh uh Indulgence and it can be a a feeling and a satisfying of one's lust either to satisfy lust or who also do it for their own gain someone just because someone's getting paid or just because someone's not getting paid doesn't mean they're not prostituting themselves that's what the scripture speaks of one who would do it to consume it to satisfy themselves or their own desires or they would actually have to do it for monetary gain every sin that a man doeth is without the body but he that committeth fornication sinth against his own body here's a specific sin that is a sin against yourself what know you not that your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you which you have of God and you are not your own that's right therefore this body as God gave great care and was very detailed as to how the temple was to be ornamented and be adorned and he was very particular about each phase I believe God has a special thought about how men and women ought to dress in the same way that the temple was looked after this body which is a temple ought to be clothed in a way that glorifies God's inner heart and desire your body is a temple of the Holy Ghost for you are bought with the price verse 20 therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit which are Gods there ought to be a glorification of God in our body it's these very principles that could speak to the to reasons why scripturally one wouldn't want to mark up their body with ink why one might not want to Mark or deform their body through piercings this isn't Clos line this isn't just lining up The Usual Suspects a and just railing against you you gaze with that earring in your ear well all right whatever that's maybe not the right way to address that is the very guy who rails the most against those things is the one who is in fact probably struggling with that and can't bring it back to a scriptural principle so they rail against the thing they can't overcome and the thing that they hate but there's a tremendous principle here for us to recognize that we are ought to glorify go with our bodies if there was something that was overtly uh signaling a lifestyle overtly signaling a a a a sexual proclivity I myself would want to avoid that uh I hope it's okay for me to say this but you know just being the dad that I was I didn't know what it meant uh but I was talking to a group of young people and I referenced you know Netflix and chill found out later what that meant I was like didn't mean to do that now I've done it again but the point is if you know something's wrong and you know that it might uh uh be taken the wrong way or give somebody reason to believe that you're into those things or you have that kind of Desire flee all appearance of evil glorify God with your body with the clothing you put on your body and don't let the dress you put on your body Discover it and disclose it in ways that don't glorify God in 1 Thessalonians 4: 1-8 furthermore then we beseech you Brethren and exhort you by the Lord Jesus that as you have received of us how you ought to walk and to please God so ye W would B abound more and more notice the the the the purpose of this this is agape love that there's a love with the corresponding purpose I'm not teaching you and exhorting you how to walk and to please God so that we could signal to everybody we're more righteous but that our lives would abound more and more that we would experience a greater deliverance from distress we would experience a greater Liberty from depression we would find ourselves set at Liberty to be able to discern difficulties in relationships with other people that we could properly raise our children that we would not have fear of debt that we would not have fear of Destruction and disease so that we can walk clean and pure in our lives Paul is teaching us and the word of God teaches us how to live so that we can not only please God but our Spirits be Freer and Freer little do some people know that the the rat race of fashion and kicking back against the clear scriptions in the word of God to not dress a certain way or act a certain way the very fact that they're fighting against it's the reason why they struggle with Suicidal Thoughts the reason why they struggle with eating disorders the reason why they struggle so much with being accepted is because they won't just accept the grace of God and walk with the desire to please him they and their Spirits would abound greater and greater and more and more for you know what Commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus so these are the Commandments he gave that they ought to walk in please God so that they could experience a greater Liberty and happiness and freedom and a greater success for this is the will of God even your sanctification that you should abstain from fornication this is the will of God that you should abstain from fornication not only does it please God but it keeps you Sanctified this fornication of this word has its roots in pornoo and that word in the scripture these the things that relate to lust and the satisfaction of it I believe it has a much broader application as we'll see that every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honor not in the lust of concupisent even as the Gentiles which know not God that no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any manner so speaking about how that your brother the other person is impacted by your lust how that you could defraud and take away and injure your brother and it speaks specifically what a man might do and lusting after his neighbor's wife or what a man might do by uh defiling himself with his brother's wife because that the Lord is the Avenger of all such as we also have forewarned you and testified speaking to fleeing fornication abstain from all appearance of evil I know I'm lumping a lot of things in but there's a direct connection to way that we can dress to discover our body and what it would cause another person to do to these very things of fleeing fornication just as Tamar dressed in a way to signal to Judah that she was available just in a way that she presented herself so that she could her character the character she's trying to assume she dressed in a way to get his attention for that for God hath not called us unto uncleanness but unto Holiness he therefore that despiseth despiseth not man but God he that despises the Commandment he that despises the word of God that says all that do so or Abomination the Commandment that says be uh uh to Adorn yourself in modest apparel to com to flee fornication all that despise that are not despising man I trust that today that as I go through these things with this great weight and burden in my heart and with great resistance from the enemy that what I'm sharing with you is reflective of God's heart and if you despise it you're not despising me if there's somebody in your past who has used these things to control you only ultimately abuse you and violate these very things and use these things as a means of sub subjugating people and covering themselves with their own loin claws if it doesn't matter it's not despising the man though they may use this to abuse you but you despise God when you reject his Commandments and it's not just God but God who's given us his Holy Spirit what a beautiful loop back in to say that he is not just your God and your lord who's lording over you but he's given you a Holy Spirit by with which you can stay clean Proverbs 6:23 to 26 the Bible even in Psalm says how can a young man stay pure and clean says take heat according to the word of God for the Commandment is a lamp and the law is light and reproofs of instruction are the way of life God's word this word that we're reading from today I believe the message of the hour is a lamp it is a light and it is a Repro for the way of life am to keep thee from the evil woman from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman and if I can say to keep you from being that too if you are a woman lust not after her beauty in thine heart neither let her take thy thee with her eyelids for by means of a horish woman a man is brought to a piece of bread and the adulteress will hunt for the precious Life the game is a foot there is this is the pressure we live in today this is Leo deia it's a woman's world it's a woman's age not a woman who's dressed right but a woman that has been stripped down and made bare of any sense of modesty or decency and the instruction is the Commandment is your light the word of God is your reprove it's for they are the way of life don't be drawn away from the by the evil woman don't let the flatter the tongue of a strange woman lust not after her beauty there's a true beauty that God has designed you to hunger for there is a thirst to be beautiful but there's also a perverse of that thirst that would cause you to pursue attention and even relationships to feel some sort of acceptance and to feel that you're valued brother BR said one word of God displaced spoils the whole picture it's all satan had to do in the beginning is just misplace one word in this beautiful uh scene this beautiful work of art became ruined in Proverbs 7: 6 to2 well let me stop I I I if I think if I go further I may just have to finish it all so it's 11:30 it's about the time I started should we take a vote all right you and me all right you help me out here I I will just obey the Lord and be very careful about our time here I know we're going to be coming back this afternoon we'll just get straight into communion and feet washing this this evening in Proverbs Chapter 7: 6-2 for at the wind window of thy house I looked through thy my casement the window of my house this is just the Observer I look through my casement that's a advertisement for casement windows and beheld among the simple ones I discerned among the youths a young man void of understanding these we could think of fleeing youthful lust where you're driven more by passion and desire and the satisfaction of of it other than rather than the wisdom that says there's a consequence for this I say this to all men there's a consequence for lust there's a consequence for your behavior there's a consequence for the images that you see and the things that you do and often times the consequences is far beyond yourself but the consequences to others you may never ever be able to outrun passing through the street near her Corner the young man and he went the way of her house right probably knew what he was doing just that way sometimes that we could Meander close enough to something so we could get a glimpse in the Twilight in the evening the black and dark night that's called incognito mode and behold there met him a woman with the attire of a harlot and subtle of heart she is loud and stubborn her feet abide not in her house why why does the scripture say that she has a place circumstances have thrust a woman out of her home there's a protection that God will give her out of her home as it's as it has need of God's Not So harsh to say well sorry sister you got to work you're just going to be abandoned and you're going to be eaten up by the world no he'll bless it he'll look out after it and you'll watch their testimony flourish even in the face of them having to work and to provide and take the place of a husband he's sick or or absentee but this is a woman who's loud and stubborn she's rebellious she's given to change her feet abide not in her house she's bantering about she's out talking she is without now in the streets and lith in weight at every corner and notice the Bible says that she's wearing the fit of a harlot the attire the dress of one who is a harlot whether it be in the form of the showy or Gody garments that would signal her availability or in the short and revealing clothing of the Romans to say this is H uh what the character I have this is what I've assumed and and and advertises that but in some way signifying this is what their character is the word even signifies clothing that's fit fitted to her body that's very neat and well-shaped in order to recommend her so modest apparel is going to be judged by these things when I say judged I'm saying this is how you ought to judge it I know I could say now to very sincere people and sincere hearted people at one of the Beauties in being able to minister the word of God to Believers is that if you preach the word of God they're going to believe it and you don't have to change it to suit the makeb believer CU if I change the word to suit the make believer he's going to make believe it and the unbeliever is going to not believe it but then I can cause a question in the believer's heart to be like well that that seems a little bit different and they're going to want to believe it with everything that's in them and so I could say right now you know what we've come up with the dress code this is what we expect and this is what we require I as the pastor of this church and sick and tired of you guys being on video and looking like a bunch of harlots and this is what we're going to start doing and you know what many of you would just do it as under the Lord out the goodness of your heart because it was told to you that's the way that it ought to be but no glory is given to the Lord and there's been no Victory so you've got to examine yourselves men and women yourselves husbands and wives together saying I don't want to be guilty of wearing things and dressing things and buying things for my children for my wife or putting things on or glorifying things that do not express modesty modesty is by definition this restraint by this sense of humility some propriety when somebody is modest uh rarely do you say of somebody who actually is very very handsome uh or you rarely do you say of somebody who's really ugly that they're modest right you say that about somebody who's really really good looking and said well they're very modest about it right they have no idea that they're so good-look if somebody was like that they're shy and ugly come on somebody right that's exactly what we would say but there's modesty this humility there's this moderate self-regard there's some people who are ugly who could really use a sense of modesty but some people think they're they're they're they're the thing and they'll dress and act in a way to be like don't I look goodness like cover yourself up there must be a moderate view of yourself you're not attention seeking you're not saying oh look at me look what I'm going to wear I and and I think this goes for men and women it goes for all of us sometimes my biggest decision on a Sunday morning is the Tie I wear because I'm like did I already wear that and I'm worried that somebody might be offended it's like he wore that twice this month and it's March second right you're afraid of that you're you think about it but maybe there needs to be this moderate self-regard there a less opinion of ourselves CS Lewis said perfect humility dispenses with modesty I thought that was wonderful and that it it sets aside personal Pride because you're taking in consideration other people this is exactly what it says in Thessalonians this exactly what the scripture is saying that I want to conduct myself in a certain regard out of respect for my brother I want to conduct myself in a certain regard out of respect for my brother's wife I want to act and behave in a manner whether it be through my conversation or a familiarity or the way that I might uh uh uh present myself in a way that is respectful I want to have this this modesty of spirit and even a perfect humility that's going Beyond pretense and I'm genuinely concerned about other people amen all right I'm gonna stop here musicians if you'd come we've got a lot more to get to later but I feel that we should just press pause here and I don't know how I'm going to get back into this on a Wednesday maybe next Sunday we could just just just spin it right back up but there is an attire there is a way that men and women can dress that displeases the Lord search the scriptures I know that when I was I was born into the message I was raised in it the things that I heard the things that I was taught maybe the things I could witness with my own eyes sometimes you look back and you see pictures and you see maybe Believers in the 60s dressed a certain way and we we we can be a Gass at the fact that their dress doesn't look like these are solid Believers this is maybe a wife of a prophet and these are real solid Believers and you think oh my goodness I would never dress like that now and in some ways it's because we came up with a rule to determine what was modest merely by the fact that skirts were long or whether or not it had a split or whether or not the the shape of the sleeves and there's a lot of ways that we kind of we we maybe it was our own desire as sheep to have some specific requirements that we knew we could meet the mark and we're pleasing the Lord and so it was really good maybe just to borrow a lot from UPC and and maybe borrow a lot from this and borrow lot from that and and we want to just give me structure give me the just tell me what to do and I'll do it and that leads itself to a lot of manipulation and abuse because if you kind of go outside that you can be ostracized you can be called a lot of different things and I believe that there's a standard in the word of God a standard in the message of the hour that relates to things that are very precise and very specific but if I could say this there's one thing you don't want to look like and that's the world and now I could be maybe more precise there's one thing that you don't want to do is to wear the attire of a woman that is not in subjection to God's word that there's a way that she can look a way that she could dress there's a way that men can look and dress to where we are given to change we're rebellious against the word of God we will dress in a way that mixes things and signals things and I found that when I inquired one time of why is sister so and so wearing this and this picture and this is just what I was told from a source or two that in that era in the 60s what was very common was for hippies to wear the really really long skirts and look a certain way and as that had become adopted and was very fashionable for a certain worldly movement there was even a desire amongst believing Christians to not be confused as a hippie and therefore the dress that they would wear that would be very modest and it would be a a a and it would be below the knee and it would cover themselves and it wouldn't look like the long flowing skirts maybe of more of a 80s or 90s look that we embraced as message Believers but it was modest it was acceptable but they were trying to avoid the world at all cost they did not want to be confused with the world and I believe today that when the world is going one way we as Believers ought to go the opposite way not because we're Android or we're inhuman or we're from Mars but because we have a citizenship that's from another kingdom and that we want to be living Our Lives now in a way that glorifies the kingdom of God and therefore we have to ask ourselves some very hard questions Brothers do these pants these lowrise skinny jeans give glory to God ask yourself the question you can come to me and try to use me like a magic eightball where's my brother here who called me that the other day just as a joke you could try to try to use it use me as that but all I could do is sit down with you and talk through it because you've got to follow God who's given you the Holy Spirit despise not man but you you're not despising man you're despising the Commandment of God who has given you the Holy Spirit to navigate these things I haven't even gotten halfway through this I don't think or maybe right around halfway through jack am I halfway through he always asked me to print out a copy of my notes for him so don't ever let anyone steal him now he he's got my notes the rest of the sermon is in his [Music] hands God who's given you the Holy Spirit if I can say it this way that even if you've been ruined he can restore you there's times in in in just through life or great paintings become damaged and destroyed anybody ever see the meme of the Church in Italy somewhere where the face of Christ was destroyed and some local woman just took it upon herself to touch it up and paint it again and it looked like a second graders art project well that's what would happen if we saw that we had marred the image of God and we wanted just to make ourselves up we would end up looking like Adam and the woman not doing a very good job but God's the one that made you and if you've been ruined he can restore you perfectly and that's who he want working in our lives as a God who could bring us back to principles of modesty amen God bless you let's stand we're just going to say a prayer and then dismiss you I know that we have lunch and things to get to I do encourage those who are able to come back for communion and feet washing uh this afternoon at 4:00 we're just going to try to go right into uh communion then feet washing these are uh it's a serious thing that we do together and we just want to honor it today let's bow our heads in a word of prayer our gracious Heavenly Father Lord as we stopped halfway into a thought I'm asking personally for your grace to give me a rest and peace to know that we've obeyed you that your word was sufficient today to cause deep reflection to consider consider the way that we're living and the way that we're dressing and the way that we're acting Lord I just feel this Liberty being with family and our home church and just our home people being with us and dear friends brother Andre Lord and his family that we could just have this Liberty to speak plainly about these things from scripture because they are incredibly crucially critically important in this day and age where the world has gone to such bare nakedness we could lull ourselves to sleep thinking that we have covered ourselves up only to learn later that we have discovered ourselves that through dress and conduct we were not pleasing you but actually signaling to the world we're with [Music] you Lord make us Billboards make us candles Lord a city set on a hill yes may we be thousands and hundreds even here in the valley of lived voices and become zigzags of lightning in a dark L de seean age let our light shine Lord Lord I pray for all present today I realize that we address a a vast audience of varying experiences and pasts but I trust Lord that we have the same goal no matter what our past is no matter what our present is we have the same goal to arrive at that place where we please you to perhaps come to that place of perfect humility where we dispense with modesty we dispense with pretense and we begin to moderate our Behavior we begin to act in moderation because we love others and Lord as the Bible says that we would rescue others from the fire hating that garment even hating the Garment spotted by the flesh Lord we want to have this kind of love for others that we would be willing to sanctify our appearance for the good of others for the good of others Lord maybe we could risk being perceived as oldfashioned maybe we could risk being perceived as homely maybe we could be risked as Perce being perceived as out of touch with fashion if it could become a revealer of your character and not a revealer of our nakedness I ask all this in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen
