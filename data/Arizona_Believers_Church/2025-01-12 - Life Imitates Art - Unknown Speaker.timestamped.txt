[0:00] John chapter 1 verses 1
[0:03] to5 in the beginning was the word and
[0:05] the Word was with God and the Word was
[0:08] God this has to be one of the most
[0:10] outstanding
[0:12] scriptures uh to go back to before
[0:16] creation even that's right because
[0:18] Genesis 1:1 starts with creation now
[0:20] this is going all the way back and
[0:22] before there was anything but Elohim by
[0:24] himself the same was in the beginning
[0:26] with God all things were made by him and
[0:29] without him was not anything made that
[0:31] was made in him was life and the life
[0:35] was the light of men and the light
[0:37] shineth in darkness and the Darkness
[0:39] comprehended it not amen may God just
[0:42] bless these words which we've read this
[0:44] morning from his scripture you may be
[0:53] seated the next verses uh begin to
[0:57] reference John a man's sent from God who
[1:00] came to bear witness of the light that
[1:03] through the light all men might believe
[1:05] and then John being the Forerunner and
[1:07] it
[1:08] describing uh him as the one that would
[1:12] give witness then it comes to the word
[1:13] made flesh in Jesus Christ as you would
[1:15] read through that and I think these are
[1:18] very uh these are scriptures that are
[1:20] worthy of our attention and I'd like to
[1:23] read a statement from brother Brandon
[1:25] when he gives his life story in 1950 and
[1:27] I'm just reading this kind of just to
[1:30] pull something through from Wednesday
[1:31] night for those of you who missed it he
[1:33] said I believe that when God woke Adam
[1:35] up to look at Eve she was the most
[1:37] beautiful thing that eyes had ever
[1:39] looked at and this is in all of creation
[1:42] and Adam having already named the
[1:44] animals and we were seeing how Adam and
[1:47] doing that that was a creative act there
[1:49] was something involved in seeing what
[1:51] God had formed and then being inspired
[1:54] to name it and in doing that there was
[1:56] some impression even he as an artist and
[1:58] as a creator as a God on Earth was
[2:01] creating and even giving character and
[2:03] certain things to that he was making an
[2:05] impression and now that he has seen
[2:07] every living thing when the woman steps
[2:10] forth he he looks at it and he knows
[2:13] there's nothing else more beautiful in
[2:14] all the world than this creature this
[2:16] one that is before him the most
[2:18] beautiful thing he ever looked at he
[2:20] says it goes to show that man even to
[2:22] this day the desire in man craves to
[2:26] look at a beautiful woman and so there
[2:28] is something in a man that he can when
[2:31] he sees a beautiful woman is an
[2:33] attraction to him it has a a draw and a
[2:35] power on him now we know it's in there
[2:37] that Satan has perverted that and has
[2:39] used it as a great detriment to men and
[2:42] women and he says why because that
[2:44] strain comes down through that time like
[2:46] that that was given Plum from the Garden
[2:49] of Eden God having established in
[2:52] Genesis chapter 1 the law of
[2:54] reproduction Let each seed bring forth
[2:55] of its kind I believe that you could
[2:57] look at here in Genesis and say that
[2:59] this was God's original Law of
[3:01] Attraction and how that in seeing this
[3:03] woman and how beautiful she was it
[3:05] inspired him to Proclaim bone of my bone
[3:08] Flesh of My Flesh she shall be called
[3:10] woman this creative act of naming her
[3:13] woman because Adam was created to create
[3:16] God having not been created but a
[3:18] Creator when he made Man In His Image
[3:21] this self-portrait he had given him a
[3:23] god likeness and a glory of God to where
[3:26] he could also likewise create and so
[3:29] that's the original image and then when
[3:31] Adam comes uh Falls and he loses that
[3:33] glory in Jesus Christ comes as the word
[3:36] made flesh he is uh showing that
[3:39] everything Adam lost in the fall can be
[3:42] restored back not just to one son but
[3:45] brother said to Mankind and so this is
[3:48] uh we I believe as the New Creations in
[3:50] Christ Jesus are likewise created to
[3:53] create now I want to use a phrase today
[3:56] as my title life imitates art and and
[4:00] you may be familiar with this statement
[4:03] I had done some studying on it where it
[4:05] originates and I think it I don't know
[4:07] if it's amongst creatives and I'm not a
[4:09] creative I'm just a poser I'm just on
[4:10] the outside listening and there's
[4:12] phrases and there's certain times these
[4:14] things are pointed out that life
[4:15] imitates art and so something happens
[4:17] and like that's exactly the way that
[4:19] this happened in this book or this movie
[4:22] or this portrayal and so there's this
[4:24] thought that life imitates art now in
[4:27] its origin where it came from it was
[4:28] suggesting that artistic Creations
[4:31] influence human behavior and people's
[4:34] perceptions and this is originally
[4:36] written in 1889 I found a place where
[4:39] Mark Twain actually gave h a similar
[4:42] speech and made some declarations to
[4:44] Harvard in 1891 believe he was kind of
[4:47] riffing on this original phrase that
[4:49] life imitates art and how art and those
[4:53] things that man produces through his
[4:55] creativity influences human behavior and
[4:57] how they see things and the way be came
[5:00] up was in the context of kind of an
[5:01] ongoing social debate about the uh decay
[5:04] of culture and how that Society was
[5:06] breaking down and urbanization and
[5:08] industrialization was changing the
[5:10] Victorian uh society and things were no
[5:13] longer as they were and where there was
[5:15] a lot of Pomp and Circumstance and a lot
[5:17] of politeness and a lot of social graces
[5:20] and observations if you've ever read uh
[5:23] a Jane Aus novel then you know there's a
[5:25] lot of weird formalities and the way
[5:27] people talked and the way people lived
[5:29] and things that would take place in
[5:30] those areas and now through
[5:32] industrialization and this urbanization
[5:34] a lot of things were being
[5:36] lost and part of the dispute was amongst
[5:39] different uh Styles or philosophies on
[5:41] Art in terms of Romanticism and
[5:44] portraying things in a way that was very
[5:45] romantic but then realism where it was
[5:47] like these are potato Farmers this is
[5:49] what they look like this is what they do
[5:51] and so there was just kind of a dispute
[5:52] between those of what's real art and
[5:54] what should art be and I'm just kind of
[5:57] pulling back the curtain this is how the
[5:59] sausage made I hope you don't mind mind
[6:01] this today but in studying these
[6:03] different periods and these artistic
[6:06] disciplines and and some of the uh
[6:09] attitude towards art and what it should
[6:11] do it struck me how that you could see a
[6:14] certain Beauty in uh whether it be a
[6:18] baroque or Romanticism or realism or
[6:20] impressionism and you can see that
[6:21] there's definitely creativity and beauty
[6:23] and then the if they begin to argue you
[6:25] can appreciate this side and you can
[6:27] appreciate that side and sometimes their
[6:29] approach in the very same subject
[6:30] wanting to accomplish the very same
[6:32] thing but they're wanting to do it very
[6:34] very different ways and they have
[6:35] different conclusions that they arrive
[6:37] to and I realize wow it is so important
[6:39] to have an
[6:41] absolute so important to say that
[6:43] whether I'm a romantic or whether I'm a
[6:45] realist or whether I'm an impressionist
[6:46] or whatever style I might be or whatever
[6:49] way there's got to be an absolute that
[6:51] everyone could come back to and say in
[6:52] the end this is what is actually truth
[6:55] and that I'm not just romanticizing a
[6:57] lie and I just don't want to give the
[6:59] impression of of falsehood but I I need
[7:01] to something at the end of the day needs
[7:03] to uphold what is really true and so no
[7:07] matter how much Beauty uh art can have
[7:11] no matter how much measure of Truth it
[7:13] can have it's only in God's word that we
[7:15] find full truth and genuine Beauty in in
[7:20] in the original is where we find it
[7:22] Satan cannot create and in that way when
[7:24] artists create they don't create the
[7:26] same way that God has they're using
[7:29] exist exting things and their creativity
[7:32] is either going to be a representation
[7:33] of something genuine or a perversion of
[7:37] something genuine and so only God's word
[7:40] holds full Beauty and Truth I'd read
[7:43] this statement many many years ago by
[7:44] Thomas Fuller was he wrote a book a
[7:46] piscus site of Palestine he wrote it in
[7:49] 1650 it's a rather uh very complete work
[7:52] about uh Israel and uh to say a pisca
[7:56] view he's saying this is how Moses view
[7:58] as he looked out over Palestine uh what
[8:01] are the borders and what's the geography
[8:03] and what is Israel what is belongs to it
[8:06] and he made this statement in this book
[8:07] he said next to God the word I love the
[8:10] word of God I thought that was I like
[8:13] that symmetry with John 1:1 next to God
[8:15] the word I love the word of God so he
[8:17] says God the word and then next to that
[8:20] I love the Bible I love the word I
[8:22] profess myself a pure leveler Desiring
[8:25] all human conceits though built on
[8:28] specious bottoms may be laid flat if
[8:31] opposing the written word now put that
[8:34] on a bumper sticker you you might need a
[8:37] a Suburban for enough space for that but
[8:40] that to me is worth uh contemplating
[8:44] that I love the word of God and I'm a
[8:46] I'm a pure leveler like John came to
[8:48] make the High Low Places High and the
[8:50] high places low and level things out he
[8:51] says I think any human idea or ambition
[8:54] or conceit though it might have he says
[8:56] specious bottoms that would be
[8:58] deceptively attractive foundations
[9:01] something that is superficially
[9:03] plausible but in reality not true so
[9:05] it's misleading in its appearance though
[9:07] it might have some beauty in its
[9:09] foundation it might have some Allure
[9:11] attraction its representation it should
[9:13] be leveled it should be taken apart and
[9:15] dismantled if it opposes the written
[9:18] word and I believe that that's the very
[9:20] sentiment that brother brandom expressed
[9:22] over and over again this truth that the
[9:24] Bible is our absolute and that his
[9:27] ministry in a large part was leveling
[9:29] out things that were human conceits and
[9:31] tradition building back up things that
[9:33] had been dug out and as we look at any
[9:35] of these things as we're just using uh
[9:38] maybe art as an example as we draw it
[9:40] from the message of the hour of the
[9:42] desire of God the premise of the hour
[9:44] that we're living in now we have to
[9:45] realize it it's all got to come back to
[9:47] the word of God no matter how beautiful
[9:49] or attractive it is and so it was this
[9:53] thought that struck me about the
[9:54] absolute and about the word of God and
[9:56] how that no matter how beautiful
[9:58] something can be
[9:59] if it doesn't if it is opposes the
[10:02] written word if it opposes the word then
[10:05] it should be dismantled it should be
[10:06] taken
[10:07] apart and so this statement of Life
[10:12] imitates art of this phrase it speaks of
[10:13] the influence of Art and that could be
[10:15] literature it could be movies books
[10:16] podcast videos uh any type of creation
[10:20] uh the creators the influencers so just
[10:23] it's might be more relevant today than
[10:25] ever before because all it takes is a
[10:27] certain influencer to do something and
[10:28] then everybody else is doing it and some
[10:31] of the most insane childish
[10:35] things uh maybe we should do a whole
[10:37] series on it's it's a prank bro right uh
[10:40] but there is
[10:42] um uh there is an influence by social
[10:46] media there's an influence in literature
[10:48] and podcast and books and all sorts of
[10:50] things on human
[10:52] expression and and how people begin to
[10:55] live lives and be disciplined and eat
[10:57] only raw liver and and drink only water
[11:00] uh based upon an influence an image
[11:02] something that's been portrayed to them
[11:05] and so the phrase life imitates art I
[11:07] think we can see this truth in it that
[11:09] it alludes to this powerful role that
[11:12] whether we want to say content creation
[11:13] or social media or just art plays in
[11:16] shaping Society culture and individuals
[11:19] people will model their actions and
[11:21] their behaviors and their attitudes
[11:22] based upon what they see in this created
[11:26] content and therefore art provides this
[11:29] framework by which people uh can
[11:32] interpret the world and engage in the
[11:34] world and so you use this as your
[11:36] Paradigm this is the lens through which
[11:37] I'm going to view things whatever this
[11:39] influencer says or whatever this
[11:41] personality says or whatever this uh uh
[11:44] ideology says and so through this art
[11:46] and through these representations we'll
[11:48] interpret the world and we'll interact
[11:49] and engage with it that way and it's
[11:52] true I think we could all agree to this
[11:53] that many times people individuals and
[11:56] maybe to a larger extent Society derive
[11:58] their inspiration from certain things
[12:01] that are created and I see I think we
[12:03] see this a lot with movies and so these
[12:06] works of arts and whether they be themes
[12:08] or scenarios or even visual
[12:09] representations this life imitate
[12:12] imitates art means that there's certain
[12:14] things that are portrayed in art that
[12:16] end up playing out in society and they
[12:20] say well that is just like this scenario
[12:22] and so it's like life now begins to
[12:24] impersonate and reflect art now this
[12:28] comes from
[12:30] a an observation an essay written by
[12:33] Oscar wild he is by no
[12:35] means
[12:37] uh this is may be one instance with I
[12:39] won't say brother Oscar but
[12:43] uh he wrote an observation he called the
[12:46] decay of
[12:47] lying and we might think yes like we're
[12:49] getting we're getting to the truth and
[12:51] he said life imitates art far more than
[12:54] art imitates life which I find striking
[12:57] because we would think that what art and
[13:00] the real purpose of art what it held in
[13:02] days gone by where we didn't have as
[13:03] much of the actual photographs and
[13:06] videos and things and the ability to
[13:07] travel like we do today you experience
[13:10] things through ART and so art was to be
[13:12] a representation of life in one sense
[13:14] but he says art uh imitates does not
[13:18] imitate life as much as life imitates
[13:20] art this results not merely from life's
[13:22] imitative Instinct we all have this IM
[13:25] instinct to imitate and I think that's
[13:26] true but from the fact that the self
[13:29] conscious aim of life is to find
[13:31] expression and I would agree with Oscar
[13:33] in this as well that we have this desire
[13:36] to express ourselves it's even this
[13:38] unconscious aim that want to find out
[13:40] who I am my identity I want to I want to
[13:41] have some kind of identity and he says
[13:43] art offers that offers beautiful forms
[13:45] through which that energy can be
[13:47] realized so I want to express myself you
[13:50] see a representation like I want to be a
[13:52] skater you know or you see this I want
[13:54] to be that there's a way that it
[13:55] influences us and shapes our Behavior so
[13:58] people express the things they are
[14:00] inspired
[14:01] by I hope you can really pick up what
[14:03] I'm laying down now in terms of the way
[14:06] we live our lives the way we dress the
[14:07] way we Act and the way the things that
[14:08] we support is we will express the things
[14:12] and we will portray the things we are
[14:14] inspired
[14:16] by and Oscar wild had two boys young
[14:19] boys at this time and he was used in the
[14:21] example of what he called silly boys who
[14:22] will read some sort of literature or
[14:24] some sort of fiction of Bandits or
[14:26] whatever and dress in a certain way and
[14:28] how they would uh act out what they had
[14:30] read in these adventure stories and at
[14:33] the end of the day it wasn't just
[14:34] observations of kids it was a really a
[14:36] critique of uh of adults but he came to
[14:39] this conclusion that the proper aim of
[14:41] art should be tell the telling of
[14:44] beautiful untrue
[14:47] things he's advocating for lying and
[14:49] he's saying that the reason
[14:52] why modern literature is decaying and
[14:55] the reason why modern literature and
[14:57] culture is in De flying and being
[14:59] corrupted is because the decaying of
[15:02] lying as an art was
[15:05] responsible it's it's a it it boggles my
[15:08] mind in the sense that he's saying uh
[15:10] that the reason why Society is in such
[15:12] Decay is because we're not lying good
[15:15] enough and he said if something cannot
[15:18] be done to check or at least to modify
[15:20] our monstrous worship of
[15:22] facts art will become sterile and Beauty
[15:25] will pass away from the land and this is
[15:27] wild
[15:32] there's a certain ring of truth to
[15:35] it yet there's something missing that's
[15:37] not quite right like we read it you're
[15:39] thinking yeah yeah but like how can we
[15:41] get back to true beauty through
[15:44] line and that's why I think you got to
[15:46] come back to an absolute to say well
[15:48] maybe we don't know what true beauty is
[15:50] unless we have a true measure of it
[15:52] unless we know what the original is and
[15:54] the way things are something that has
[15:57] true true Symmetry and not just Laing
[15:59] tricks on our minds because though it
[16:01] may be built on some attractive premise
[16:04] if it's a lie it should be dismantled if
[16:06] it's a lie it should not be uh believed
[16:09] and those who are trying wanting to put
[16:11] on a mask or those whose lifestyles are
[16:13] not acceptable according to the word of
[16:16] God surely they'd want to be able to
[16:17] build an art and create an art that
[16:20] would allow us to
[16:21] romanticize something that's not true so
[16:24] that we can live a lie and call it
[16:27] beautiful Jeremiah 23:
[16:31] 9-12 this scripture to me really hits on
[16:35] what Oscar wild was fantasizing about is
[16:38] this idea that art should lie and in
[16:42] line we should believe the lie be
[16:44] inspired by the lie and produce the LIE
[16:46] replicate the LIE live the
[16:49] LIE the prophet says my heart is broken
[16:51] because of the prophets my heart is
[16:54] broken my heart within me is broken
[16:56] because the prophets all my bones Shake
[16:59] I am like a drunken man and like a man
[17:01] whom my wine hath overcome so this this
[17:04] is a
[17:06] debilitating understanding because of
[17:08] the Lord and because of the words of his
[17:09] Holiness this is stimulation a
[17:11] revelation but there's a Brokenness that
[17:13] has come within it there's this
[17:14] heaviness that comes upon him he says
[17:16] this for the land is full of
[17:19] adulterers for because of swearing the
[17:21] land mourneth this swearing is a false
[17:24] oath because of
[17:26] lying the land Mourns
[17:29] because of lying the pleasant places of
[17:30] the Wilderness are dried up and their
[17:32] course is evil and their force is not
[17:35] right their course is their mode their
[17:38] style their
[17:39] life and then it says and I found that
[17:43] their uh force is not right their might
[17:46] or their influence their
[17:48] leadership this is where if we say life
[17:51] imitates art and we want the Art of
[17:55] Lying as if we can have a very rough a a
[17:58] robust and and uh strong form of this
[18:01] art where we can lie through our
[18:03] creation then life will imitate that and
[18:07] we'll have more beautiful things and the
[18:10] prophet is saying no because of
[18:12] ly because of the influence of the lies
[18:16] because of the influence of these false
[18:17] representation their mode their style
[18:20] their
[18:21] life think of this their course is evil
[18:24] their force is not right their influence
[18:27] these are the things that would shape
[18:28] Society the individual if art is
[18:31] influencing life he's saying the LIE is
[18:33] not producing a beautiful
[18:35] output he says for both prophet and
[18:37] priest are profane that means
[18:40] Godless a man that is devoid of God
[18:43] produces a vanity can only produce a
[18:45] deceptive Beauty something very shallow
[18:48] though it might have an attraction to it
[18:50] though it might appeal to some level on
[18:51] our in our flesh it say that they are
[18:54] profane and anybody who study art or
[18:57] anybody who's been Googling art as of
[18:58] late will find that there is a
[19:01] tremendous uh debate within art between
[19:03] the sacred and the profane he says yay
[19:06] in my house have I found their
[19:08] wickedness sayeth the Lord wherefore
[19:11] their way shall be unto them as a SL as
[19:13] slippery ways in the darkness they shall
[19:15] be driven on and fall therein for I will
[19:17] bring evil upon them even the year their
[19:19] visitation saith the Lord deceit and
[19:24] lies produced says a Barren landscape
[19:27] the pleasant places of the Wilderness
[19:28] are dry up because a style that was evil
[19:31] because of an influence that was not
[19:33] right devoid of Truth and they could not
[19:37] have true life because they were not
[19:39] bringing it from the genuine inspiration
[19:41] of the Lord uh they could not the
[19:43] landscape what was being produced what
[19:44] they were sewing and what was bringing
[19:46] forth was devoid of true life and it did
[19:48] not have any real Beauty I know that
[19:51] when we read this and we say well the
[19:52] wildernesses are dried up and and all
[19:55] it's dried up it's burnt over we might
[19:57] even say well the the that the prophet
[19:59] had a vision of the United States of
[20:01] America Burnt Over in nothing but
[20:04] Ash and we'd say that hasn't happen in a
[20:07] physical sense but with every day
[20:10] there's another ember in a spiritual
[20:12] sense of something that has been burned
[20:14] down and be reduced to ashes that in a
[20:17] in a worldly sense oh we've never been
[20:19] healthier we've never been more
[20:20] beautiful we've never been more powerful
[20:22] but in a spiritual sense we have never
[20:24] been more Barren and dried up there's
[20:26] never been a time of a greater famine
[20:28] for the word amen amen amen and there's
[20:31] no
[20:33] light I hope this isn't too much of a
[20:35] hard turn here but there's no light
[20:37] where they are and so in the absence of
[20:40] light they can use their
[20:42] imagination they can imagine beautiful
[20:45] things in the absence of light they can
[20:46] surmise that this is a great thing and
[20:48] this is wonderful and they can use the
[20:51] benefit of
[20:52] Darkness to convince themselves that all
[20:55] is well and everything's beautiful and
[20:57] this is a perfect Revelations 317
[21:01] description now in Genesis 1:
[21:05] 1:3 and still wanting to consider this
[21:07] phrase life imitates
[21:10] art
[21:12] as Oscar wild and his debate with the
[21:16] realist was proposing that since life is
[21:22] influenced by Art we should make art
[21:24] Beautiful by lying through lying let's
[21:27] not be so real
[21:29] let let's present things that people can
[21:30] romanticize about fantasize about and
[21:33] then portray and hopefully reshape
[21:36] society and in that way saying that the
[21:39] that which is created or that which
[21:41] comes forth should
[21:42] influence uh The Observer now in Genesis
[21:47] CH 1 veres 1
[21:49] to3 we've looked at this verse one quite
[21:51] a bit and uh we had set this up for
[21:55] Wednesday night but we've moved it to
[21:56] today in the beginning God created the
[21:58] Heaven and the Earth and the Earth was
[22:01] without form and void and darkness was
[22:04] upon the face of the deep and the spirit
[22:07] of God moved upon the face of the waters
[22:09] and God said let there be light and
[22:11] there was light God having created the
[22:15] Heaven and the Earth and brought it
[22:17] forth by his word and he stretched out
[22:19] things by his hand we see those things
[22:20] very uh specifically set forth in
[22:23] scripture now we get a a description of
[22:25] God's creation and the Earth was without
[22:27] form and and void and darkness was upon
[22:30] the face of the deep so there was a that
[22:33] word without form and void it speaks of
[22:35] a vanity it was a place of chaos one
[22:37] word Is A
[22:39] Wasteland and to be in Darkness Darkness
[22:42] upon the face of the deep it was obscure
[22:44] and hidden so from the as in terms of
[22:48] what could be beheld and what could be
[22:51] seen or processed by perception the
[22:53] Earth had no form it was a wasteland it
[22:55] was chaotic it was the darkness had obsc
[22:58] ured and hidden the the earth now we can
[23:03] say well that doesn't sound like
[23:04] something God would create but yet God
[23:06] in the first iteration of creation as
[23:08] it's described in terms of Heaven and
[23:10] Earth there's this vanity it's a
[23:12] wasteland it's obscure H shrouded in
[23:14] darkness and if I could say this the
[23:17] potential of that creation was
[23:20] hidden the the beauty of it was in
[23:23] darkness it's not perceptible it can't
[23:25] be seen but he says and the spirit of
[23:28] God moved upon the face of the waters
[23:30] where the darkness was the spirit of God
[23:33] moves and it speaks let there be light
[23:35] and there was light and what light did
[23:38] is light be to reveal the shape and the
[23:41] form and the order and the symmetry of
[23:43] God's creation that where there was
[23:46] Darkness where there's darkness by
[23:47] default there's chaos you could probably
[23:50] be led into a room with nothing in it I
[23:53] say probably I'm not insinuating that
[23:55] you will be but if you were led into a
[23:58] dark room room with nothing in it no
[23:59] windows no source of light and locked
[24:01] the door and sealed out all the light
[24:03] you would know beforehand there's
[24:05] nothing in here but as soon as you're
[24:06] shrouded into complete darkness you can
[24:08] begin to imagine anything you
[24:11] want and if you were led into a and and
[24:15] be
[24:16] uncomfortable I think some of the
[24:18] sensory deprivation things that are
[24:19] available nowadays they say some of the
[24:21] scariest things that you can be engaged
[24:23] in now imagine being thrust Into
[24:26] Darkness immediately without any
[24:27] knowledge beforehand of what
[24:30] exist and so where a formation appears
[24:33] to you to be something uh unfamiliar and
[24:36] you don't know what it is God when he
[24:37] originally created I think it's
[24:39] beautiful to put it in this point we
[24:41] having experienced creation if somebody
[24:43] says what is that over there you go well
[24:45] that's a mountain what is that over
[24:46] that's a tree and we could understand
[24:48] but having no knowledge beforehand what
[24:51] God had created in the darkness could
[24:53] have appeared to be very
[24:56] chaotic and I'm not Sugg sugesting that
[24:58] God in the beginning created everything
[25:00] as it was but we know the seeds are all
[25:02] laying
[25:03] there and it's light they begin to
[25:05] reveal God's
[25:07] creation and light is intrinsic in
[25:10] art if it wasn't I could be a fantastic
[25:14] artist right I can just paint a black
[25:17] panel but isn't that beautiful and it's
[25:21] amazing what goes for art these
[25:23] days Vincent Van go was writing to his
[25:25] brother Theo about and talking about a
[25:27] night scene a night effect and he was
[25:29] painting something at night and here he
[25:32] was painting at night and he said still
[25:34] a great deal of light falls on
[25:37] everything why because even at night
[25:39] there's some source of light and because
[25:42] of that light you can see things even at
[25:45] the very depths of the sea I was having
[25:47] an ongoing debate with one of the AI
[25:49] engines about light and and they kept
[25:53] saying that there's virtually no light
[25:55] in the deepest depths of the the scene
[25:56] it's like you're saying there's
[25:57] virtually none so does that mean there's
[25:59] some and they'd say by saying that I'm
[26:01] meaning that there's a very there's uh
[26:05] not really light and they keep saying it
[26:07] away it's like just tell me yes or no
[26:09] and the whole internet
[26:13] broke and even down in the very deepest
[26:17] depths of the sea there's light through
[26:19] bioluminescence and and though uh chat
[26:23] GP teeth may think that everything in
[26:25] light is absorbed they still hold open
[26:27] this window that
[26:28] probably some Vis invisible spectrums of
[26:32] light invisible to our eye that's down
[26:35] there in the depths and the darkest
[26:36] places that allows life to
[26:40] grow and so a great deal of light falls
[26:43] on
[26:44] everything in the beginning God created
[26:47] the light he said let there be light as
[26:49] the light begin to shine things begin to
[26:52] become clear the Bible says in Ephesians
[26:55] 5:13 but all things that are reproved
[26:57] are made man manifest By the
[27:00] Light something is proven Vindicated
[27:02] made sure convincing you turn on the
[27:04] light what is it that I see what is that
[27:06] what is that you look out your window as
[27:08] a child and you see something in the
[27:09] dark and you're not sure I think there's
[27:11] a really large Indian chief standing in
[27:13] the backyard mom turn on the light turn
[27:15] on the light I speak from
[27:17] experience and the light shines and it's
[27:20] a
[27:20] tree why because it makes manifest for
[27:23] whatsoever doth make manifest is
[27:25] light now if you are I know you're
[27:28] familiar with the sermons of Shalom and
[27:30] those different principles that brother
[27:31] bam is using and there's a man here who
[27:33] can turn on light that light brings
[27:37] Life Light brings
[27:40] Life Light brought to life the beauty of
[27:44] God's
[27:45] creation had God proceeded with creation
[27:48] without verse uh three here and he
[27:51] continues to create let's just uh
[27:54] suspend maybe our knowledge of the
[27:55] scripture and maybe the spiritual logic
[27:57] and just say well God created and he
[27:59] never brought forth light and everything
[28:01] came forth and you would have tremendous
[28:04] Beauty but it would be completely
[28:07] imperceptible the very first thing God
[28:09] had to bring forth was light because
[28:11] light brought to life creation the
[28:13] beauty of the art of God was only going
[28:15] to be discernible as light that he
[28:17] created by the spoken word would shine
[28:20] upon it brother B said let the light
[28:23] shine and the light will bring every
[28:25] word to its right position in its season
[28:29] it's The Shining of the light brother
[28:30] bam says without light there cannot be
[28:34] life it takes light to bring things to
[28:37] life let the light shine and the light
[28:39] will bring every word to its right
[28:41] position in its
[28:43] season in John chap 1 veres 1
[28:47] to5 as we read this in our text it says
[28:51] in the beginning was the
[28:53] word and the Word was with God and the
[28:56] Word was God the same was in the
[28:58] beginning with God so the word is God
[29:03] there's no way around this it's not two
[29:06] it's one the word is God the same was in
[29:08] the beginning with God all things were
[29:11] made by him the word god without him was
[29:13] not anything made that was made in him
[29:16] was life and the life was the light of
[29:20] men amen and then this phrase and this
[29:23] statement which holds true to Jesus
[29:25] Christ who comes upon the Earth is the
[29:27] word made flesh
[29:28] and the light shineth in darkness and
[29:31] the Darkness comprehended it
[29:33] not it's a this
[29:36] sentence is so heavy in its
[29:39] riches that just you know a casual
[29:42] observation doesn't do its justice but
[29:44] the light shineth in darkness there was
[29:46] darkness in the beginning the spirit of
[29:48] God began to move and God said let there
[29:51] be light and the Darkness could not
[29:53] overtake it the darkness could not seize
[29:56] it it could not withstand it
[29:58] it light was greater than Darkness you
[30:02] cannot achieve Darkness uh by throwing
[30:05] Darkness at light you need the absence
[30:08] of light to have Darkness so darkness is
[30:10] only Power existed in the absence of
[30:13] light and so when light shined in the
[30:15] Darkness Darkness could not obtain it
[30:17] could not overtake it could not seize
[30:19] it and it so Darkness shining uh where
[30:23] darkness is and the light shines it
[30:25] cannot comprehend it it cannot
[30:27] understand it can not perceive it is
[30:28] also part of the understand of the part
[30:30] of the meaning there but life is the
[30:36] light and the life was the light of men
[30:39] it is light that reveals God's Beauty it
[30:42] is life that is the light that reveals
[30:45] God's
[30:46] Beauty art as I've been using it to in
[30:49] the sense of painting and creation of
[30:52] that kind type of medium where it's
[30:53] maybe paint on canvas or watercolor
[30:56] through some sort of sketching we're
[30:57] using
[30:59] the that visual medium so far in terms
[31:01] of art but without color there is no
[31:07] art someone's going to challenge me on
[31:09] that I just know somebody just
[31:13] unfollowed but color is the interaction
[31:16] between light and
[31:18] matter and as light
[31:20] strikes something that's either absorbed
[31:24] transmitted or reflected and it's
[31:26] through those qualities that you you get
[31:28] these different uh a different
[31:30] perception of light perception of light
[31:32] is what gives us color from the as light
[31:34] strikes the surface of an object as it
[31:36] is either transmitted reflected or
[31:39] absorbed that's what gives you the sense
[31:40] of color and for different ones not that
[31:43] anyone here would be colorblind but
[31:45] those who are colorblind know that there
[31:46] can be colors but through the lack of
[31:48] perception where the cones are absent or
[31:50] whatever is not there it cannot discern
[31:52] a light doesn't mean the light's not
[31:53] shining doesn't mean the color is not
[31:55] true but the perception is inaccurate
[31:59] and so colors characterized by Hue and
[32:02] by value and by intensity whether not
[32:04] it's bright or dull or whether how light
[32:06] or dark it is or whether it's red green
[32:08] yellow or
[32:09] blue those are the and then you create
[32:12] your colors from those things colors as
[32:14] they're used together can complement one
[32:16] another they can harmonize or they can
[32:17] be distracting
[32:20] disconcordant but color cannot exist
[32:23] without
[32:25] light the absence of light is total
[32:29] darkness and where there is no
[32:33] light where there's no light source it
[32:35] is impossible to perceive
[32:40] colors color cannot exist without
[32:44] light without light everything would
[32:46] just appear black which black is
[32:48] essentially the absence of light in the
[32:51] visible
[32:53] spectrum so when God said let there be
[32:55] light is is the only way possible to see
[32:57] the beauty of his Creation in the
[33:00] beginning was the
[33:01] word and creation came by the word of
[33:05] God and as God is creating by the spoken
[33:07] word creation becomes his
[33:10] language he's expressing something in
[33:12] his creation there was a transformation
[33:15] of the spoken word which God create
[33:17] created by there was a transformation of
[33:19] his word into living things and it's for
[33:23] that reason that as God created by the
[33:25] spoken word we can actually look back
[33:27] and see that history has been his
[33:29] voice that throughout time as God had
[33:32] created and brought forth creation Now
[33:34] the things that have been are speaking
[33:36] for him the living things that have been
[33:38] have been his
[33:39] voice I'm not I'm not wanting to get
[33:41] away from this phrase the life was the
[33:43] light of men but I'm wanting you to
[33:45] think about how God in the beginning
[33:47] when he created in the beginning was the
[33:48] word and the word brought forth creation
[33:50] and he shined his light upon that and it
[33:53] became his voice it became his
[33:55] testimony and all of creation now speaks
[33:58] for God as an artist in Romans 1: 18-25
[34:04] for the wrath of God is revealed from
[34:05] Heaven against all ungodliness and
[34:08] unrighteousness of men these are the
[34:09] conceits of man that are not based upon
[34:12] truth but a lie he says who hold the
[34:14] truth in
[34:15] unrighteousness whether we appreciate
[34:17] the beauty of the lie or we are the
[34:19] creators of it he's saying that God's
[34:21] Wrath is going to be poured out upon
[34:23] those who perverted God's Beauty those
[34:25] that have perverted nature those that
[34:27] have perverted mankind those that have
[34:28] perverted the word because they hold
[34:30] things that are true but they've changed
[34:32] them into
[34:33] unrighteousness because that which may
[34:35] be known of God is Manifest in them for
[34:37] God has showed it unto them that's quite
[34:39] a statement God has already showed them
[34:42] certain things that which can be known
[34:45] of God has already been shown to them
[34:49] you following this what can be known of
[34:51] God in other words it's not that God has
[34:53] showed him his entirety but God has
[34:55] shown them things about himself for the
[34:58] invisible things of him from the
[35:00] creation of the world are clearly seen
[35:03] there are certain invisible things about
[35:05] God that have can be clearly seen in
[35:07] creation being understood by the things
[35:10] that are made invisible things of God
[35:12] are understood by the things that he
[35:14] made even his eternal power and
[35:17] godhead God's eternal power and his
[35:19] office as God his Singularity as God is
[35:23] revealed or made known in that which he
[35:25] created so the invisible God has a voice
[35:28] amen we can say that God's language was
[35:31] translated into substance and form God's
[35:34] word became life in creation so that
[35:38] they are without
[35:40] excuse Paul is saying you don't have to
[35:42] go any further than creation nothing
[35:44] else that would come from it but
[35:46] creation itself to know that there is a
[35:48] God that's why the one that says there
[35:51] is no God is a fool and that's like why
[35:53] they hide it behind their religion which
[35:55] is called science
[36:00] science well let me just say it this
[36:03] way I know I fellowship with this before
[36:05] on with with some people here in the
[36:07] church I don't know if I've ever
[36:08] mentioned it from the pulpit uh but I'm
[36:10] known for repeating myself quite
[36:13] frequently I'm known for repeating
[36:15] myself quite frequently and I'd made
[36:17] this this when it comes to Creation to
[36:21] those that
[36:22] deny creation and they have their
[36:26] Theory what they want you to do is
[36:29] just give them Faith just let me just
[36:33] have faith in one proposition just give
[36:35] me an exus and one unprovable
[36:38] proposition and I can prove to you
[36:39] everything
[36:41] else right just I can't prove to you how
[36:44] the world was created just accept by
[36:48] faith that this is how it
[36:50] happened so just excuse me on this and I
[36:54] can prove to you everything else it's a
[36:56] religion just like any anything
[37:00] else and they are without excuse by
[37:03] denying that creation itself reveals the
[37:06] eternal power and godhead of the one
[37:08] true Lord because that when they knew
[37:10] god well how do they know him by his
[37:13] creation they glorified him not as God
[37:16] neither were thankful but became vain in
[37:19] their imaginations and their foolish T
[37:21] was
[37:22] darkened if I could say this is where
[37:24] man being created to create you used his
[37:28] own imagination and his Foolish Heart to
[37:32] create things that were not true and did
[37:33] not glorify
[37:35] God professing themselves to be wise
[37:37] they became fools science Arts
[37:40] philosophies all those things that would
[37:42] not arrive back finally to the fact that
[37:45] there is one true God his word is true
[37:47] and even if they're wrestling I say
[37:49] there is a Divine creator of all things
[37:51] there must be one certain absolute we're
[37:53] trying to find him and and and reach him
[37:55] and know who he is and and even as they
[37:57] erected the altar to the unknown God
[37:59] Paul is saying you're foolish because
[38:01] God has made himself known through his
[38:03] word through
[38:05] creation but through their own
[38:08] vain uh creativity they didn't glorify
[38:11] God professing themselves to be wise
[38:13] they become fools and change the glory
[38:16] of the uncorruptible god into an image
[38:18] made like to corruptible men and to
[38:20] birds and to four-footed beast and
[38:22] creeping things this would be the
[38:24] worship of things other than God a
[38:26] portrayal and an expression of God as
[38:28] something other than who he actually
[38:32] was I know that there's more that I
[38:34] could could be said about this in terms
[38:36] of the centuries and the thousands of
[38:37] years of
[38:39] art that represent would give
[38:41] representation of gods or that they
[38:44] fashioned on the side of a wall or
[38:46] through stone or through uh uh wood and
[38:49] they worship that and notice how they go
[38:52] wherefore God also gave them up to
[38:54] uncleanness through the lust of their
[38:56] own Hearts to dishonor their own own
[38:57] bodies between
[38:59] themselves why is such filth and
[39:01] perversion so rampant because they
[39:04] change the truth of God into a lie verse
[39:07] 25 who changed the truth of God into a
[39:09] lie and worshiped and served the
[39:11] creature more than the Creator who is
[39:14] blessed forever
[39:15] amen if I could say this way creation
[39:18] was the light the original light that
[39:20] man rejects that if you reject the very
[39:23] premise that God created the heavens and
[39:25] the Earth the very evidence of God if
[39:27] you reject him there you can produce
[39:29] nothing but
[39:31] vanity no matter how sincere your uh
[39:34] your Ambitions may be and no matter how
[39:36] kind to humanity you may be if you
[39:38] reject the basis that God created the
[39:41] heavens and the earth that is the
[39:43] original light that man
[39:45] rejects certainly if you reject that you
[39:47] can't reject that Jesus Christ was the
[39:49] Son of God the son
[39:52] light they change the truth of God into
[39:55] a lie
[39:57] they the LIE produced a reality a vanity
[40:02] and go all the way back to the fall and
[40:03] a lie produced perversion It produced
[40:06] death and as Fallen mankind they worship
[40:09] that which is
[40:10] created by
[40:13] man more than God the Creator who
[40:15] created
[40:17] man the influences the images the
[40:20] opportunities the the
[40:24] titles they worship and serve the
[40:26] creature
[40:29] they they they they'll worship and serve
[40:30] the art produced by Fallen man more than
[40:33] they do God the Creator and now Paul is
[40:37] specifically making the point that they
[40:38] worship the Sun and the Moon and the
[40:40] four-footed Beast and they worship
[40:41] things that God
[40:43] created and therefore it leads to this
[40:46] lust and dishonoring their bodies
[40:48] between themselves it's why we've
[40:50] entered into such a gross perverted
[40:54] age but the life is the light of
[41:00] where this Darkness has allowed for the
[41:02] truth of God to be changed into a lie
[41:05] for ungodliness and unrighteousness to
[41:08] obscure and hide the
[41:09] truth to where thou the invisible things
[41:12] of God that should be made made known
[41:13] through creation are so watered down and
[41:15] obscure and so twisted and perverted
[41:17] that man gives themselves
[41:19] over to a corruptible
[41:23] image John chapter 9: 4 to5
[41:28] in the beginning was the
[41:30] word the word brought forth life and the
[41:35] life was the light of men the light
[41:37] shined in darkness and darkness cannot
[41:39] stop
[41:41] light where there's light there can be
[41:43] perceptible
[41:45] color think of that where there's any
[41:47] kind of
[41:49] light any kind of light it will reflect
[41:53] it will show if there's any color to be
[41:55] seen John chap 9: 4 and 5 he says I must
[41:59] work the works of him that sent me while
[42:02] it is
[42:03] day The Works of him works there could
[42:07] even refer to a work of art anything
[42:09] that's produced whether artistic or
[42:11] literary or otherwise I must work the
[42:13] works of him that sent me while it is
[42:15] day the night cometh when no man can
[42:18] work as long as I am in the world I am
[42:21] the light of the world to better
[42:25] understand this scripture and those who
[42:26] may be the third shift and those are
[42:28] like hey I can I can get work done at
[42:30] night let us just think that if you're
[42:31] trying to bring forth the image and see
[42:34] it in its beauty and its correctness
[42:36] there must be
[42:38] light families who do family pictures
[42:42] you can't just take pictures at any time
[42:44] of the day when it's most convenient the
[42:46] lighting has got to be just
[42:49] right oh there was a lot of men's voices
[42:52] there the sisters are afraid to shout I
[42:55] thought I was going to hear tongues to
[42:56] be honest with you
[42:57] right that we put so much effort into
[43:00] getting the lighting right oh the
[43:01] lighting's bad on this and this is you
[43:03] got to be facing this way and that's too
[43:04] harsh and that's too many shadows and
[43:07] listen Brothers it's true right if you
[43:10] want a good family picture uh as much as
[43:13] I'm praying and believing that AI will
[43:15] get there where you just have to feed in
[43:16] certain metrics right I just want to
[43:18] stand in front of a camera take my take
[43:20] my passport photo and produce a
[43:22] beautiful family picture in front of a
[43:23] Saro and get everybody in there how me
[43:26] some in really nice expensive clothes I
[43:30] never have to smile one time except for
[43:32] the first photo now that lighting is so
[43:36] important in producing an accurate
[43:37] reflection of what it really is and
[43:40] that's why when you see something with
[43:42] your eye and you're like wow that Moon
[43:43] is beautiful and you pull your phone out
[43:44] to take a picture
[43:47] like what did I just take a picture of
[43:49] why do I even
[43:51] bother because the lens is not able to
[43:54] absorb the light to take advantage of
[43:57] the light in order to replicate and
[44:00] produce what is
[44:02] there so is the work I must work the
[44:05] works of him that sent me while is day
[44:07] it's not just a matter of getting the
[44:09] job done it's a matter of getting it
[44:11] done right it's not a matter of saying
[44:13] it's finished but it's getting it
[44:14] finished correctly and accurately as
[44:16] long as I am in the world I am the light
[44:18] of the world there's nothing that can be
[44:21] done right without the
[44:23] light here we can see this beautiful
[44:25] representation of the artwork of God the
[44:27] creation of God and that light is
[44:29] intrinsic in art without light there's
[44:31] not
[44:32] color here he's saying I am the light of
[44:36] the
[44:37] world as long as I am in the world that
[44:40] is where God's light
[44:42] is he was in the world and that was the
[44:45] one true light at that time when Jesus
[44:48] Christ as a man is on Earth with the
[44:50] father dwelling in him and he's doing
[44:52] these many wonderful works and he's uh
[44:54] performing these signs and wonders there
[44:56] was light no nowhere else to be found
[44:58] anywhere else in him he was the light of
[45:02] the world God manifested in his son he
[45:06] was the visible expression of the
[45:07] invisible
[45:09] God and he was light because he
[45:11] manifested
[45:13] God you could say that the light of the
[45:15] world was
[45:16] creation then the light of the world is
[45:18] is then the one that God creates the Son
[45:20] of God God the way the truth the
[45:23] life Revelations 3:14 says and under the
[45:27] angel of the Church of the Le Deans
[45:28] right these things sayith the amen the
[45:30] faithful and true witness the beginning
[45:33] of the creation of God I believe there
[45:37] is a very deliberate specific reason why
[45:40] this designation of the beginning of the
[45:42] creation of God comes forth here to the
[45:45] Leo Dean Church age because it's when
[45:46] God's creation is going to be
[45:49] finished Jesus Christ was the beginning
[45:52] of the creation of God not in the
[45:54] beginning was the word but when the word
[45:57] word now is formed in the womb of Mary
[46:01] and that God thou brings forth a child
[46:03] which is in the form of man in the
[46:06] fashion of man but the blood is the
[46:08] blood of God the flesh though it can die
[46:11] was the it was deity that that body
[46:14] represented and the life that was in him
[46:16] the zoy life was the light of men God
[46:20] who was The Giver of Life was manifested
[46:23] in the
[46:23] flesh so God is identifying himself
[46:26] again in his
[46:28] creation and that creation is
[46:31] light the Bible says in Isaiah 53: 1 to3
[46:35] I feel necessary to share this because
[46:37] the concepts of beauty and what we find
[46:39] attractive we have different varieties
[46:41] amongst us I read it on Wednesday night
[46:43] I even felt maybe after I read it I like
[46:46] man I I feel like I maybe should take
[46:48] more time explaining what uh Pascal may
[46:50] be meant by this in terms we have these
[46:52] Tendencies to think something's
[46:55] beautiful and if we're if we have that
[46:58] bent and that's the way that our our
[47:00] Ting is our sound is then we think
[47:03] that's beautiful and you see something
[47:04] else like I don't know man I've been to
[47:06] the Grand Canyon just a big hole in the
[47:11] ground flip it upside down let me climb
[47:13] it that's Beauty right and that's what
[47:17] people would think like there's
[47:18] something that goes up that's beautiful
[47:20] and other people see something it's just
[47:21] the varieties and what one finds
[47:23] attractive the way it strikes them and
[47:25] so I realize there this debased
[47:28] perception of beauty that is merely
[47:32] carnal and some people just the certain
[47:35] foods they just absolutely love love it
[47:37] love it love it love love it and other
[47:38] people absolutely hate it and and there
[47:41] that's profane that's all it is it's
[47:42] profane it's God's not any more in a
[47:44] rolled burrito than he is in a a cabbage
[47:47] roll
[47:53] right but Isaiah 53: 1:3 who hath
[47:57] believed our report and to whom is the
[47:58] arm of the Lord revealed great
[48:01] questions Paul picks this up where who
[48:04] who's the one that sees it who's the one
[48:06] that caught the Revelation upon whom has
[48:08] the light shined for he shall grow up
[48:10] before him as a tender plant and as a
[48:13] root of a dry out of a dry ground so you
[48:15] think well that's there's some use there
[48:17] for
[48:19] sure there's there's there's something
[48:21] marvelous there's something beautiful a
[48:23] tender plant of root out of a dry ground
[48:25] he hath no form nor
[48:28] cless not quite without form and void
[48:32] but the form and the cless that man
[48:34] would want to see and a leader and a
[48:36] ruler and a beautiful person's not there
[48:37] and when we shall see
[48:39] him there is no beauty that we should
[48:42] desire
[48:43] him when man sees him in his flesh when
[48:48] man sees him in his stature when he sees
[48:50] him not necessarily for what he is but
[48:53] for how they are perceiving the light
[48:56] there is no
[48:58] Beauty the beauty there doesn't
[49:00] necessarily refer to something beautiful
[49:03] as it would may be even in the garden
[49:05] but it's just the appearance or the
[49:07] spectacle the thing seen there's nothing
[49:09] seen or the appearance of him doesn't
[49:12] cause us to desire
[49:13] him may say that there's no Beauty it
[49:16] means he was ugly and he was ferocious
[49:18] looking but rather his features didn't
[49:20] Stand Out is something to be
[49:23] desired I know the first question that
[49:25] all the sisters would ask is Jesus
[49:27] Christ or how tall are you right if he's
[49:30] not over six foot you don't want to have
[49:32] anything to do with
[49:35] him but there
[49:37] is it to me that kind of encapsulates
[49:40] that you would look at like nah you know
[49:42] it doesn't look like a leader much to
[49:43] me he is despised and rejected of men a
[49:47] Man of Sorrows and acquainted with grief
[49:48] he has no form or comeliness he has no
[49:51] attraction he has no appearance that
[49:52] he's desirable and then and we hid as it
[49:55] were our face from
[49:59] him it's you don't you don't gaze you
[50:03] turn away he was despised and we
[50:05] esteemed we could not appreciate we
[50:07] could not value him we esteemed him not
[50:09] this is Jesus Christ the beginning of
[50:11] the creation of God when he comes into
[50:14] the world God who has formed and
[50:17] fashioned man not Adam made over but a
[50:20] new
[50:21] creation a a a a a quickening a a
[50:25] quickening power
[50:27] not just a living being but one with
[50:29] power Beauty and Grandeur the very Heart
[50:31] Of God expressed God does it through
[50:33] such Simplicity that when you saw him
[50:35] you just turned
[50:37] away I would say that even in one sense
[50:39] it's not even that you shrieked in
[50:41] horror but you that's nothing
[50:43] special on a scale of 1 to 10 what would
[50:45] you rate Jesus I don't know four and a
[50:48] half no form no attraction the spectacle
[50:53] of him it was nothing that was St man
[50:55] did you see that guy preaching the other
[50:56] day
[50:58] he was he was this tall and he was
[51:01] dressed this way and he had such a way I
[51:03] mean there's some preachers I would
[51:04] listen to them just for their
[51:06] voice that's right hey just you could
[51:10] just if Charlie Brown's mom sounded like
[51:12] that right right right right you could
[51:14] just listen to it all day long I love
[51:16] the sound of
[51:17] that they say some of the greatest
[51:19] preachers in days gone by their voices
[51:21] were whiny they were fat and short and
[51:23] praise the
[51:25] Lord B
[51:27] but yet it was the word that was the
[51:32] attraction now I need to
[51:37] hurry in the sermon Jesus Christ the
[51:39] same yesterday today and
[51:41] forever brother Bram says in Hebrews 138
[51:44] the Bible said that Jesus Christ is the
[51:46] same yesterday today and
[51:48] forever he says do you believe that's
[51:52] inspired Lord willing maybe that one of
[51:55] the next Services coming up I want deal
[51:56] with inspiration do you believe that's
[51:59] inspired he says I believe that is the
[52:01] truth at the Judgment Day God will see
[52:04] that that is truth God will stand behind
[52:07] what he says to be
[52:10] truth this is one of rembrance
[52:13] portrayals of
[52:15] Christ This is a Rembrant head of
[52:18] Christ knowing what I know about the
[52:20] message of the hour and' say that
[52:22] there's a very
[52:24] striking picture being painted
[52:27] of what Christ may have looked like
[52:30] sorry to all the arens he didn't have
[52:31] blonde hair and blue
[52:34] eyes and now let's just wonder what type
[52:37] of person Jesus was now the ones in this
[52:40] slide they're all rembrance paintings I
[52:42] think there I found five of them I think
[52:44] they're all just strikingly beautiful he
[52:47] says now let's just wonder what type of
[52:49] person Jesus was now I'm showing you
[52:51] rbrand a a very gifted artist who is
[52:55] portraying through his gifts and his
[52:57] talents and through the use of color and
[52:59] this composition and everything he's
[53:01] trying to P portray an image of Christ
[53:04] and maybe just through even the the
[53:06] tilting of his head and the clasping of
[53:08] his hands h and maybe some sort of halo
[53:10] effect by the the shading behind his
[53:12] head he's trying to portray Jesus Christ
[53:15] maybe not in the sacred way maybe in a
[53:17] more profane way where it's like where
[53:19] where's the light and the angels and
[53:21] where's all the infant cherubs around
[53:23] them and all these Grandeur things no
[53:25] it's a very simple humble portrait of
[53:27] Christ so let's wonder what type of
[53:30] person Jesus was as we look at the
[53:32] picture and try to deduce what kind of
[53:33] person he was we're left to a man's
[53:35] impression of what Christ was what he
[53:38] looked like to determine what he is
[53:39] brother says now I know we have some
[53:41] theological ideas and some painters
[53:43] that's painted pictures listen to this
[53:46] please but let's not look at him in the
[53:48] picture form tonight cuz we might not
[53:55] knowall if that if if if that I would
[53:58] even go so far to say if that was
[54:00] actually a picture of
[54:02] him we could we could worship the
[54:04] picture instead of the one but let's
[54:08] look at him in his life his
[54:13] spirit I I I I really appreciate this
[54:16] one I think it's
[54:17] a all all again all these are by done by
[54:20] Rin but let's look at him in his spirit
[54:22] in his life his
[54:25] spirit think of this so Jesus when he
[54:28] comes back to Earth again in his body
[54:29] form it'll be way too late then for us
[54:31] to think anything about
[54:34] it this is staggering to me this is so
[54:39] it so opens up more to me the value of
[54:41] the message of the hour opens up more to
[54:43] me the value of Revelation the value of
[54:45] really knowing god through his word and
[54:47] through the the ways in which he wants
[54:49] to make himself known I could learn the
[54:53] picture enough to know that's exactly
[54:56] what Jesus looks
[54:58] like but if I saw that image in the
[55:01] flesh it'd be too late to know anything
[55:02] about him if that's all I gained in my
[55:05] knowledge of him is the the the artist
[55:08] perfect replication of what he might
[55:09] have looked like he says we need to know
[55:12] not in picture form but we need to know
[55:14] what type of person he was I want to
[55:17] know more about his life and his
[55:18] character because it's not the image
[55:21] that's light but the life was the light
[55:23] of men that's right if I if I actually
[55:27] see him in physical body form as we will
[55:29] when we meet him in the air it's too
[55:31] late then if I don't see him there and
[55:34] I'm waiting till he sets foot on Earth
[55:35] again and I haven't seen him then then
[55:37] it's too late then if I see him in body
[55:40] form before white Throne judg it's too
[55:41] late then that's right brother bam in
[55:45] the sermon Watchman what of the
[55:48] night speaking of Art and uh and and
[55:53] light and composition there's such a a a
[55:56] a great alignment there with this
[55:58] Watchman what of the night and I don't
[56:00] have this statement provided so I just
[56:02] try to read this quickly so we
[56:04] can uh make a little bit more progress
[56:07] what if man sit here with a long white
[56:09] robe on and hair hanging way down like
[56:11] this he might not have looked like
[56:15] that that's just what the artist painted
[56:18] a picture of he might look altogether
[56:21] different from
[56:23] that but what if he stood here and had
[56:25] nail prints in his hands Prince of scars
[56:27] in the forehead and sit here and said he
[56:29] was the Lord Jesus you know right quick
[56:31] I'd tell you he was
[56:34] wrong I think he says it kind of as a
[56:37] question when Jesus comes time shall be
[56:41] no more in that form in that kind of
[56:42] image it could not be the Lord Jesus but
[56:45] then if he's the same yesterday and T
[56:46] forever how could he be
[56:48] here in the form of the Holy Spirit
[56:51] where he Sanctified us to move into us
[56:53] and to perform his Works through us
[56:55] because
[56:57] that is his
[56:59] agents The Works that I do shall you do
[57:02] also now how would he declare himself
[57:05] then to know what was the same
[57:08] Jesus because he'd be able to do the
[57:10] same work that he did before he was
[57:13] crucified so now if an artist is known
[57:15] by his work and it's amazing how
[57:18] specialized people have become to where
[57:19] they could look at a painting and they
[57:21] could deduce by the work that that's not
[57:25] who the person is purporting the artist
[57:27] to be by the way that he worked so what
[57:30] was were his Works he says and that was
[57:33] you all ready you want to work the works
[57:35] of Christ The Works that I do shall you
[57:38] do also the work was he did what the
[57:41] father showed
[57:44] him he did what the father showed
[57:48] him Christ did what God told him to do
[57:52] those are the works that you've got to
[57:55] do I'm going to I'm going to keep
[57:57] plowing forward here in Ephesians 5:1 it
[57:59] says be therefore followers of God as
[58:01] dear
[58:06] children be therefore followers of God
[58:09] as dear
[58:12] children followers is that mes
[58:17] imitators be ye an imitator of God as
[58:21] dear children the act of intimidate
[58:25] intimidating well some of us are really
[58:27] have learned the art of that the act of
[58:30] imitating someone often stems from your
[58:33] admiration for
[58:34] it for that person this respect that you
[58:37] would have for somebody you you find out
[58:39] they like this and therefore you do the
[58:41] same thing this imitation as it were
[58:43] they say is imitation is the sincerest
[58:45] form of
[58:47] flattery
[58:49] a a cleric in the Church of England
[58:52] wrote
[58:53] that imitation is the sincerest
[58:57] of
[58:58] flattery it shows admiration and
[59:01] respect not not a uh
[59:05] satire not a
[59:07] parody but this is an imitation be
[59:10] therefore imitators of
[59:12] God as dear
[59:14] children that's why our children uh
[59:18] often times do the things that they do
[59:19] it's through the respect and admiration
[59:21] for you it's when they're not doing the
[59:23] things you do when maybe they're losing
[59:24] the respect but it's this sense of one
[59:27] who is a child who admires and looks up
[59:29] to somebody will then begin to replicate
[59:33] and imitate what they're seeing
[59:36] reflected Jesus said except you become
[59:38] as little children there's even
[59:40] something about every Artist as you
[59:42] begin to study them especially within
[59:44] the visual arts that there's something
[59:46] childlike about their imagination
[59:48] they've retained something in their
[59:50] innocence to where they're able to bring
[59:51] forth things in a creative way but as
[59:54] dear children not ones who are lacking
[59:56] Zoe life not ones who lack the skill to
[1:00:00] actually do it but be therefore
[1:00:02] imitators of God as his children as
[1:00:06] children of God imitate God as children
[1:00:10] of God therefore bring forth that image
[1:00:12] and expression of God let your life
[1:00:16] imitate
[1:00:18] him in this sense there is a truth that
[1:00:21] life imitates art that our lives ought
[1:00:24] to be this imit
[1:00:26] of God as his
[1:00:29] children that as he is a certain way as
[1:00:33] he makes himself known that's the way
[1:00:34] that I want to be as God desires a
[1:00:37] certain thing to be done as I see that
[1:00:40] as his son and you as his children as
[1:00:43] you see that you can begin to reflect it
[1:00:45] back out and it's not an impersonation
[1:00:47] through this imitation it's literally
[1:00:51] demonstration that's why you the the
[1:00:53] skill is there
[1:00:56] the life is
[1:00:58] there Jesus did what the father showed
[1:01:01] him and brother B says the harmony of
[1:01:03] the father and the son he says notice it
[1:01:06] Jesus never did anything until it was
[1:01:07] first showed him by the Father John 5:19
[1:01:10] this harmony is now to exist between the
[1:01:13] groom and his
[1:01:18] bride I just ask musicians to come I'm
[1:01:20] going to stop there I've been long
[1:01:22] enough I've got got halfway through
[1:01:27] but we'll stop there this harmony now
[1:01:29] exists between the groom and his
[1:01:36] bride so think if
[1:01:38] Christ is to be expressed in this
[1:01:41] hour if we were to be something
[1:01:43] beautiful that's come out of Christ this
[1:01:47] image this striking
[1:01:49] image then we'd want to know what he
[1:01:51] looks like
[1:01:56] the very word of
[1:01:57] God that he wrote in the Old
[1:02:02] Testament had came out in the flesh of
[1:02:05] Jesus
[1:02:07] Christ and once again this word of God
[1:02:10] which was
[1:02:11] written what God has been trying to say
[1:02:15] through the word has got to be seen in
[1:02:20] flesh think of that what God has been
[1:02:22] trying to say Through the Bible even to
[1:02:26] the message of the hour God wants that
[1:02:29] language to be
[1:02:31] transformed into
[1:02:34] flesh he wants it to be
[1:02:36] art how so that that that we would by
[1:02:40] that word our life would animate it that
[1:02:44] your life will animate the
[1:02:46] word this is where I wrestled with it
[1:02:49] when I God was originally dealing with
[1:02:51] me on these things that life imitates
[1:02:52] art well I don't know if I necessarily
[1:02:54] agree with the origin of that statement
[1:02:56] and I see the truth of it in a fallen
[1:02:58] society and I have a hard time maybe
[1:03:01] with the word imitate and and maybe it's
[1:03:03] life animates the word and and and twist
[1:03:06] it and contort it to where it fits maybe
[1:03:08] uh a more acceptable cliche that we
[1:03:10] might have as message Believers but the
[1:03:13] more that I looked at it says life the
[1:03:16] life was the light of men Therefore your
[1:03:20] life is the reflection of God's word
[1:03:24] amen you reflect the image of the
[1:03:29] Creator the life is the light of men
[1:03:32] without your life there is no Beauty to
[1:03:35] be
[1:03:37] seen without your life there's no Beauty
[1:03:39] to be seen
[1:03:41] anywhere that's right unless you shine
[1:03:44] light the only thing that can be seen is
[1:03:46] the worst of
[1:03:48] humanity but even when we let our shine
[1:03:50] there's things that can be seen and
[1:03:52] appreciated
[1:03:53] everywhere the more negative we are the
[1:03:56] more complaining we are the more D we
[1:03:57] are the more Unfaithful we are the more
[1:03:59] stubborn we are the less light there is
[1:04:02] in the world
[1:04:03] [Music]
[1:04:06] today it's his light shining on us in
[1:04:08] this hour the light of god good morning
[1:04:10] bride that will allow us to reflect the
[1:04:13] final
[1:04:15] Masterpiece the life your life is the
[1:04:18] light of
[1:04:19] men how else are they going to hear how
[1:04:21] else are they going to
[1:04:23] know I know that I'm being repetitious
[1:04:27] and I I thank you for your patience in
[1:04:29] it I thank you for your diligence
[1:04:32] through several these uh maybe several
[1:04:35] series or maybe the last four and a half
[1:04:36] years or whatever it's been I thank you
[1:04:38] for it even my own children are saying
[1:04:41] that was a good that good sermon Dad
[1:04:44] it's a lot of the same things it's
[1:04:49] good could it be that God is just laying
[1:04:51] a large and sturdy foundation for
[1:04:54] greater things
[1:04:56] I'm not trying to make an excuse for
[1:05:00] repetition but if if the same things are
[1:05:02] being emphasized over and over then God
[1:05:05] is paying very careful detail to this
[1:05:08] masterpiece he's paying attention not
[1:05:09] he's not going to gloss over anything
[1:05:11] for your sake I'm not trying to build a
[1:05:13] compendium or a library of sermon so
[1:05:16] that if if things would T in 200 years
[1:05:18] they would unearth uh the mp3s of this
[1:05:21] and be like who is this wise philosopher
[1:05:24] a Aon this guy right it's something
[1:05:28] else and and be so enamored with the
[1:05:32] composition a and the mannerisms and
[1:05:34] said this is a real this is a great body
[1:05:36] of work let us we need to uh we need to
[1:05:38] Archive this and make it available no no
[1:05:41] it's not about this
[1:05:43] art it's about the living thing it's
[1:05:47] about you who are beholding the beauty
[1:05:49] of the
[1:05:51] Lord who are seeing his image and are
[1:05:54] inspired once again
[1:05:56] to
[1:05:57] speak you're you're
[1:06:00] inspired uh to to live in a way that
[1:06:04] accurately reflects the heart of your
[1:06:07] Creator and I I wanted to and it just uh
[1:06:11] we have some things we'll get to on
[1:06:12] Wednesday night Lord will it but there's
[1:06:14] a variety that God's expressing in this
[1:06:16] room there's some religions that would
[1:06:18] have required for all of us to look a
[1:06:20] certain way this morning I don't mean
[1:06:22] holy or modest I mean wearing white
[1:06:27] pants white shirt a certain dress code
[1:06:31] the same in the ministry will all the
[1:06:33] ministry wears the same
[1:06:35] outfit right there's a certain way that
[1:06:37] they try to create this homogenization
[1:06:40] overall and remove all distinctions and
[1:06:42] differences and varieties for appearance
[1:06:45] sake supposing that that's
[1:06:47] godliness wanting to say that this is
[1:06:50] sacred this represents and and lifts up
[1:06:53] what is sacred and what is Holy but the
[1:06:56] reality is the greatest beauty that God
[1:06:58] has ever expressed was when deity was in
[1:07:01] the
[1:07:02] profane I'm not saying something
[1:07:04] perverted but I mean something common
[1:07:06] something normal when there was no
[1:07:08] sacredness and Holiness and Grandeur and
[1:07:10] beauty that we'd like oh my goodness do
[1:07:13] you see
[1:07:14] that but in a composition in a light in
[1:07:17] a frame and in a form that was every
[1:07:22] day that was different across the board
[1:07:26] that one could look one way one could
[1:07:28] look
[1:07:31] another one could enjoy one thing one
[1:07:33] can enjoy
[1:07:35] another through their different taste
[1:07:37] and their different passions and
[1:07:41] desires they
[1:07:43] [Music]
[1:07:45] harmonize and they represent the God who
[1:07:47] is a god of
[1:07:49] variety and they're able to be a chorus
[1:07:53] they're able to be a composition
[1:07:55] that I Pray by God's grace I pray that
[1:07:58] you all become whether individually or
[1:08:00] collectively as a group where however
[1:08:02] you may uh gather together and represent
[1:08:04] yourself through normal light I pray
[1:08:06] that your light would be
[1:08:08] shining for others to see and come to
[1:08:12] know the
[1:08:13] Christ that's being revealed in
[1:08:15] you let's stand and pray thank you for
[1:08:19] your patience even
[1:08:21] today thank you I I was
[1:08:23] long for the visitors I normally preach
[1:08:26] 42 minutes on the dot right is that
[1:08:28] about right maybe not try to be about an
[1:08:31] hour usually though I think I've been
[1:08:33] much longer but thank you for your
[1:08:35] patience today a lot of things to
[1:08:37] consider how does God want your life to
[1:08:40] represent his character amen so that
[1:08:43] you're not
[1:08:45] telling beautiful untrue things amen our
[1:08:49] gracious heavenly father today Lord as
[1:08:52] we close this service in prayer
[1:08:56] we do as we often do we ask that you'd
[1:08:58] Bless the people that have been here who
[1:09:00] have heard your word who've battled
[1:09:02] through complexes and fears and overcome
[1:09:05] insecurities maybe overcome a difficult
[1:09:07] morning a lack of rest whatever it might
[1:09:10] be
[1:09:11] Lord I never
[1:09:15] trivialize one's presence in your
[1:09:19] house some may say oh well they haven't
[1:09:22] been here in over a month but they're
[1:09:24] here amen
[1:09:26] and that pleases the
[1:09:29] Lord Lord we don't know what others have
[1:09:32] gone
[1:09:32] through we don't know what people are
[1:09:34] going
[1:09:37] through but Lord I
[1:09:39] believe that you've begun a good
[1:09:43] work and though right now from our
[1:09:45] vantage point it may seem to be a
[1:09:46] composition that's very
[1:09:48] chaotic may not be painting much of a
[1:09:51] beautiful picture but I say Lord let
[1:09:52] your light
[1:09:53] shine let it
[1:09:56] shine Lord that we might see the work
[1:10:00] that you're doing in their lives and
[1:10:03] glorify you
[1:10:04] Lord help us to be these accurate
[1:10:08] portrayals of who you
[1:10:10] are Lord as we were reading through
[1:10:13] those last statements Brother bradam
[1:10:14] begin to point out that there could be
[1:10:16] an
[1:10:17] artist's rendering of who you are and
[1:10:20] what you look
[1:10:22] like they could paint Jesus Christ and
[1:10:25] have a a particular
[1:10:27] image and he says but we want to know
[1:10:30] we'd have to know what kind of person
[1:10:31] you were not just what you look
[1:10:35] like and Lord just as rbrand painted
[1:10:38] those beautiful
[1:10:41] self-portraits I believe you the Creator
[1:10:44] is painting another
[1:10:46] Masterpiece sculpting it fashioning it
[1:10:48] by Your Word by your tender hand so that
[1:10:52] we can be not so much in in a
[1:10:56] homogeneous physical form all the men
[1:10:59] have shaved heads and no beards
[1:11:02] and khaki pants and two button polo
[1:11:07] shirt we all wear the same shoes and we
[1:11:10] all do the same things we all like the
[1:11:11] same things and eat the same food and
[1:11:13] all the sisters dress the same way and
[1:11:14] make the same foods and we just
[1:11:16] homogenize into some forced Unity Lord
[1:11:19] if we want that we should just join the
[1:11:20] World Council of
[1:11:23] churches the more we mix the more we
[1:11:25] mingle the more we borrow the more we
[1:11:27] fuse the more steampunk we get the more
[1:11:30] we all look
[1:11:31] alike to now the hipsters aren't
[1:11:33] different anymore
[1:11:36] Lord I pray that you could help us to be
[1:11:39] true to what you are
[1:11:43] painting bless us Lord I know I'm
[1:11:45] repeating myself over and over again but
[1:11:47] I pray that what you're doing is you're
[1:11:49] solidifying a foundation for great
[1:11:52] things I believe for our church for our
[1:11:55] families and for the individuals who
[1:11:57] Fellowship here you have great things in
[1:12:01] store for
[1:12:02] them bless us I pray as we commit all
[1:12:04] things to you and asking your blessing
[1:12:06] upon the people in the name of the Lord
[1:12:08] Jesus Christ
[1:12:10] amen amen praise the Lord God bless you
[1:12:14] Lord will will just pick up on these
[1:12:15] things we may we may just pick up on
[1:12:17] this next Sunday um if that's me if
[1:12:20] that's just how it might work out better
[1:12:22] just for those who come and are here we
[1:12:24] have a tremendously uh faithful and uh
[1:12:28] uh group that comes on Wednesday nights
[1:12:30] and those who aren't able to make it we
[1:12:32] uh we pray for you that you would be
[1:12:34] able to and those who don't even want to
[1:12:36] come at all we pray for you that you'll
[1:12:38] want to uh because I think our midweek
[1:12:41] service is a very special time very
[1:12:43] special Gathering it's usually just a
[1:12:45] really faithful core that's always here
[1:12:47] and so sometimes uh I don't like to
[1:12:49] necessarily finish a Sunday morning on a
[1:12:51] Wednesday night for the benefit of those
[1:12:53] who will be here next Sunday we might
[1:12:55] just finish some of these things but
[1:12:57] think about it how is God being imitated
[1:12:59] through me not God becoming a character
[1:13:02] of you but you
[1:13:04] becoming an imitator a rep a a not so
[1:13:08] much of a replication but a reflection
[1:13:10] of a genuine true life so that your life
[1:13:13] imitates God accurately God bless you
[1:13:17] you are dismissed as those who like to
[1:13:18] stay in worship you could do that at
[1:13:20] this
