[0:00] to many even my own family keeps asking
[0:02] me if we're ever going to explain this
[0:04] and we're just kind of leaving it at
[0:06] that but we want to i want to kind of do
[0:09] another installment
[0:11] in this and it may actually this
[0:13] installment may actually be kind of a
[0:15] spin up to a series
[0:16] and i want to
[0:19] start by reviewing i think it was the
[0:20] first service that we'd ministered on
[0:22] kids eat free i just want to review a
[0:23] few things just to kind of get them lay
[0:26] the foundation because i want to draw
[0:27] from some of this and in proverbs
[0:29] chapter 22 verse 6 i'll give you my
[0:31] title here in a little bit in proverbs
[0:33] chapter 22 verse 6 it says train up a
[0:35] child in the way he should go and when
[0:38] he is old he will not depart from it
[0:41] it's important to note that it's a way
[0:42] that he should go so there's a way that
[0:44] god wants each one of us to walk there's
[0:47] a path that each one of us must walk in
[0:49] and our path in life is going to be
[0:51] unique than others and then even the
[0:53] path and calling that we have in life is
[0:56] going to be different than that for our
[0:58] children but we we have a common desire
[1:00] to serve god we have a common desire to
[1:02] walk in his precepts but here it is a
[1:05] way that it's a way that he should go
[1:07] and it says when he's old he'll not
[1:08] depart from it so there's a great power
[1:11] in the way that you train up a child and
[1:13] we used this scripture to refer to how
[1:16] children are the glory of the family and
[1:18] that there's actually gold in them the
[1:20] hidden glory of the family i think we
[1:21] use the title digging for gold that we
[1:23] have this responsibility
[1:25] and as it says to train up a child in
[1:27] the way that he should go i think we use
[1:29] the scripture in ephesians be their
[1:30] followers of god be followers of god as
[1:33] dear children
[1:34] our children have our nature and i know
[1:37] that might make some of us cringe a
[1:38] little bit but it's just it's just the
[1:40] way that science works that when you
[1:42] have give birth to a child they're going
[1:43] to have your nature and so a child has
[1:46] his parents nature
[1:47] and they imitate without effort it's
[1:50] just programmed in them it's just part
[1:51] of their makeup and who they are and so
[1:53] as parents we're either going to promote
[1:55] the worst that's in them or cultivate
[1:58] something better and we know that we're
[2:00] even tasked with being the holy ghost to
[2:02] our children until they get the holy
[2:04] ghost so our desire our desire is
[2:06] parents and our number one job as
[2:08] parents isn't just to bring out the
[2:10] worst in them of what we've given them
[2:12] genetically or even to bring the best
[2:14] out of them in terms of what their
[2:15] talent might be but we want to cultivate
[2:17] something better for our children
[2:20] and parenthood as we know god was the
[2:21] original parent and that he's the source
[2:23] of all parenthood uh it we it has
[2:26] parenthood as the greatest power to
[2:28] influence children has the greatest
[2:30] power to shape the character of a child
[2:33] and if we didn't believe that i believe
[2:35] any parents here should just be very
[2:37] very worried
[2:38] and if we didn't believe that then i
[2:41] think it would i would understand why
[2:42] someone would not want to have a child
[2:44] because if you do not have the ability
[2:46] to shape and influence your child's
[2:48] character then the world just has them
[2:51] the society has them that the day has
[2:53] them but we have there's a way that god
[2:55] has ordained parenthood to shape and
[2:57] form the heart of a child i think
[2:59] brother reggie had kind of touched on
[3:01] some of these points and we may have
[3:03] even used this exact uh statement a
[3:05] couple weeks ago but says the word in
[3:07] the world has fallen apart
[3:09] he says the beautiful virtue that god
[3:10] gave a woman to be a mother has been
[3:12] marred and that's the backbone of the
[3:15] nation you break motherhood and you've
[3:17] broke the nation right then
[3:19] that's one thing that helps hold it
[3:21] together real genuine parenthood so why
[3:25] is society eroding why do we see the
[3:27] morals of the country broken why do we
[3:30] see
[3:31] just a
[3:32] swift current moving people into
[3:34] insanity it's because that that part
[3:36] that god had chosen to anchor the family
[3:39] to anchor children to put them on the
[3:41] right path that's been broken and so
[3:43] that's what holds it together is real
[3:44] genuine parenthood not just a mother but
[3:47] parenthood
[3:48] and i we may have used this one as well
[3:50] i think we did in the last one it's in
[3:52] the message elisha the prophet
[3:55] and this is kind of a this is a
[3:56] statement that's really in your face
[3:59] and um and i i guess maybe brother chris
[4:01] you and brother ed you might have stole
[4:02] all the amen so we might have to start
[4:05] depositing making some deposits on
[4:07] amends but he says how can you expect
[4:09] your children to go to sunday school and
[4:11] serve the lord when you yourself don't
[4:13] even go
[4:14] how can you expect your children to be
[4:16] something when you're nothing that's
[4:17] kind of a that's a hard statement but
[4:19] think of how he's saying this how can
[4:21] you expect your children to go
[4:23] when you don't go how can you expect a
[4:25] particular standard of your children
[4:27] when you don't hold that standard and i
[4:29] think we should maybe even let this
[4:31] strike home and kind of get us get us in
[4:33] our private uh uh private parts of our
[4:36] lives where there's things that we might
[4:38] say and do as parents that we would
[4:39] never allow our children to say and do
[4:42] and maybe it's good just to kind of give
[4:43] pause and ask ourselves would you ever
[4:45] want them to do that is there any
[4:47] context is there any any way that you
[4:49] would ever want your children to behave
[4:51] in a similar manner and it might even
[4:52] operate to challenge us in terms of the
[4:55] things that we give preeminence he says
[4:57] i didn't mean you wasn't nothing but i
[4:58] mean when you know that you make no
[5:00] profession and it kind of gives these
[5:02] questions how can you expect your
[5:04] children to be righteous when you're
[5:05] putting such an example before them
[5:08] might be very easy uh to chastise our
[5:11] children and get onto them and try to
[5:12] implore them to serve god and you should
[5:15] do better and you shouldn't do this and
[5:16] you shouldn't do that but then we can
[5:18] also ask ourselves uh am i holding
[5:20] myself to the same standard am i doing
[5:22] the the things that that could give them
[5:24] the proper reflection he says how can
[5:26] you do it you are the best example that
[5:28] they have
[5:30] they're going to look to you when they
[5:31] won't look for no one else because your
[5:34] nature is in them that's that's that's
[5:37] where the real influence comes from the
[5:39] people in the world uh they may share
[5:41] certain things in common them they may
[5:42] be classmates they may have different
[5:44] associations uh maybe
[5:46] extended families and connections but
[5:49] you have a special connection to your
[5:50] own children because your nature is in
[5:53] them and by nature they're going to look
[5:55] to you for an example and they're even
[5:57] wanting to
[5:58] they're they're they're wanting to look
[6:00] to you to give them clues and to
[6:02] give them direction and it's a
[6:03] remarkable how the child's mind works
[6:06] even from infancy as they begin to
[6:08] develop that they even found that the
[6:10] reason why and i don't know that they
[6:12] were able to actually ask and it was
[6:14] articulated but the reason why infants
[6:16] and newborns or babies will drop things
[6:19] over and over and over again is they're
[6:21] learning about gravity
[6:23] they're learning why things why don't
[6:25] they go when i drop it why doesn't it go
[6:26] up
[6:27] and then and then at the same time
[6:29] they're learning human nature and they
[6:31] see that how many times is this person
[6:33] gonna pick this up
[6:34] every time i drop it because you're
[6:36] being responsive to that and they're
[6:38] actually thinking they're conscious
[6:40] they're processing they're like
[6:42] when i let go of this it falls to the
[6:44] ground and immediately that person comes
[6:46] over picks it up gives it back to me and
[6:48] they're wanting to learn
[6:49] how many times does this happen
[6:52] because it's part it's in their nature
[6:54] to to be responsive
[6:55] to these things and they're learning so
[6:57] as we said last time in digging for gold
[6:59] or several times ago there's glory in
[7:01] our children they're the hidden glory of
[7:03] the family and there's gold in there and
[7:05] if i could put it this way it's our duty
[7:07] to aid the prospect of christ
[7:10] and to put our children to position for
[7:12] christ to bring out the seed of god in
[7:14] them and the best in them
[7:16] as we've read from come follow me says
[7:18] youth men and women for tomorrow if
[7:19] there is a tomorrow we must train them
[7:22] so do we train the youth the the men and
[7:25] women for tomorrow we must train them we
[7:28] feel that burden to train them like
[7:30] there will be a tomorrow
[7:32] and perhaps it is when we do that that
[7:34] there will be no tomorrow
[7:37] that when we can take this
[7:38] responsibility seriously and we train
[7:40] them as we ought to and feel that burden
[7:42] to really lean into it whereas there was
[7:44] a time in the message where they thought
[7:46] it was all going to end in 1977 so maybe
[7:49] there wasn't a lot of thought given to
[7:50] how you train your children there's even
[7:52] a thought today i've come across where
[7:54] people are going to wait in the future
[7:56] when brother branham will be able to
[7:57] save the souls of all their children so
[7:59] they're not really that concerned about
[8:01] where they are now they're looking to
[8:02] something in the future but as i listen
[8:04] to the tapes as i hear the word of god
[8:06] as i read i realize as a parent i have a
[8:08] duty to train them because they're going
[8:10] to be the uh the men and women of
[8:12] tomorrow
[8:14] now that kind of picks us that catches
[8:16] us up to speed on where we were last
[8:18] time and i think where we're wanting to
[8:19] go tonight will be
[8:21] um will rest really well on this
[8:25] and so the the title for my sermon
[8:27] tonight
[8:28] is
[8:29] the seven bad habits of highly
[8:31] ineffective parents
[8:34] i'll leave that up there in case you
[8:36] can't read it i'll just keep saying it
[8:37] but
[8:38] the seven bad habits of highly
[8:40] ineffective parents
[8:42] now
[8:43] um when i mentioned it to my wife she
[8:45] said i don't like that it's negative and
[8:47] i said well that's the whole point
[8:49] because i will just be honest with you i
[8:52] am not qualified to speak on the seven
[8:54] good habits or the seven habits of
[8:56] highly effective parents
[8:57] um but i can speak with uh
[9:01] uh you know an expertise on what doesn't
[9:03] work
[9:05] and so the seven bad habits of highly
[9:07] ineffective parents i am drawing this
[9:09] from the seven habits of highly
[9:11] effective people by stephen covey and
[9:14] you can show that brother john
[9:15] and i think uh the sold over 40 million
[9:19] copies it's been published in 40
[9:21] different languages a couple million
[9:22] audiobooks sold and it's probably one of
[9:24] the most uh this is the one of the
[9:26] best-selling non-fiction business books
[9:28] in history and so that's that's the
[9:30] connection is the seven bad habits of
[9:32] highly ineffective parents and we're
[9:34] kind of doing the inverse of the seven
[9:36] habits of highly effective people
[9:39] uh full disclosure i've never read the
[9:40] book
[9:41] so if if there's if there's any way that
[9:44] this somehow tracks whatever stephen had
[9:46] to say it's just all by coincidence
[9:49] because there's another book i read that
[9:50] this correlates to
[9:52] now
[9:53] here are here's a list i'll give you the
[9:54] list at the outset i've provided it all
[9:56] on one slide so that you could um you
[9:59] could jot these downs as you need to
[10:00] unless somebody provided it in bullet
[10:02] port format i wanted uh it just to be i
[10:06] might have actually have it timed there
[10:07] but i want you go ahead and just fast
[10:08] forward through all that so they're all
[10:10] up there i might i might have not
[10:11] removed the uh
[10:13] the action on that i just want you to
[10:15] see them all here because i'm not trying
[10:17] to hide anything
[10:18] and uh
[10:19] and i'll say that in this these seven
[10:22] bad habits of highly ineffective parents
[10:23] they're really applicable to any
[10:25] relationship in which two people are
[10:26] dependent on one another and so it's not
[10:28] just a parent to child but husband to
[10:30] wife anywhere there's mutual dependency
[10:33] there should never be codependency it
[10:35] should always be mutual dependency and
[10:37] so you could you could make this
[10:38] applicable in any really any given
[10:40] situation so maybe i could try to write
[10:42] a bestseller
[10:45] in response to or just kind of tracking
[10:47] his language
[10:48] and i will say also this is not doctrine
[10:51] in no way are we trying to establish
[10:52] some doctrinal paradigm uh this is not
[10:54] rigid these these things are not
[10:56] exclusive if you wanted to come up with
[10:58] 500 bad habits of highly ineffective
[11:00] parents i'd sign off on it
[11:02] if you wanted to narrow it down there's
[11:03] a lot of overlap so maybe you could do
[11:05] that but here they are number one to
[11:07] seven over emphasizing carnal things
[11:11] inconsistently instructing and
[11:13] correcting
[11:14] improperly judging
[11:16] inappropriately using voice
[11:19] wrongly disciplining and i have kind of
[11:21] tried to use some of these negative
[11:23] buzzwords
[11:24] not being an example or maybe say being
[11:26] a bad example but not being an example
[11:29] and withholding grace these are the
[11:31] seven bad habits of highly ineffective
[11:34] parents i'm sure you could look at this
[11:36] and say yeah i would say that if anyone
[11:38] is really proficient in these that's not
[11:40] really effective over emphasizing carnal
[11:43] things inconsistently instructing and
[11:45] correcting
[11:46] improperly judging inappropriately using
[11:49] voice wrongly disciplining not being an
[11:52] example and withholding grace now as you
[11:54] look at these what i'd like to do this
[11:57] evening
[11:58] and i meant to say this at the outset
[12:01] that um
[12:02] i was really straining just to try to
[12:04] find the mind of the lord for this
[12:06] service even leading up to it just
[12:08] wasn't sure which direction the lord
[12:09] would want me to go
[12:10] and there's been many different things
[12:12] just right there on the cusp i believe
[12:14] of being anointed to preach even though
[12:16] i've studied and find that there's
[12:17] tremendous inspiration there just maybe
[12:19] not quite ready um to minister on them
[12:22] and so i just really waiting on the lord
[12:24] and and and feeling a lot of inspiration
[12:26] in the word there's just maybe a lot
[12:28] that you could just come up and preach
[12:29] on but something kept resonating over
[12:32] and over in my mind over the last week
[12:33] or so that i just that
[12:35] my burden is something practical
[12:37] something practical something practical
[12:39] and to get into the practical things of
[12:42] the word of god to help us to encourage
[12:43] us we have a lot of needs in our lives
[12:47] we have a lot of needs and we want the
[12:48] word to meet those needs so i feel this
[12:50] burden to pull things out of the word of
[12:52] god that'll meet us right where we live
[12:54] and
[12:55] there was some things
[12:57] just the things that were ministered
[12:58] last week and on sunday and then brother
[13:01] reggie used the statement practical
[13:03] purpose and it just it just connected
[13:05] with the things i'd been studying on on
[13:06] purpose and different things and it
[13:08] really it really quickened to me some
[13:10] things uh it just brought some things
[13:12] together for me and i felt the door open
[13:14] up to minister on this
[13:16] and it this is a subject i administered
[13:18] on just a very very little bit a few
[13:20] years ago
[13:22] and never had the opportunity to fully
[13:23] develop it and really study it and i've
[13:25] been very reluctant
[13:27] uh since we began pastoring to to go
[13:30] back and just take from things i've
[13:31] preached before i've preached for over
[13:33] 20 years
[13:35] and preached i don't know how many
[13:36] sermons i've preached but i've just had
[13:37] this in my heart i haven't i have not
[13:40] wanted just to go back and pull
[13:41] something out that i'd preach before but
[13:43] just seek to find fresh inspiration time
[13:46] and time again and not just rehearse
[13:48] things that being said really if it's in
[13:50] the word of god there's so many
[13:51] wonderful things to preach and the
[13:53] longer we preach here you're going to
[13:54] find yourself you're going to find
[13:56] myself repeating myself
[13:58] because we just rehearse the word
[13:59] rehearse the word rehearse the word and
[14:01] so this is something that today the lord
[14:03] just kind of took whatever seal that was
[14:05] upon i don't want to preach things i've
[14:07] preached before uh at least not too much
[14:09] of it
[14:10] that just was ripped off that and i just
[14:12] felt this liberty
[14:14] to go into this subject tonight it's a
[14:15] little bit different maybe than how i'd
[14:17] prefaced it before but i'm really
[14:18] excited about going through these seven
[14:20] bad habits of highly ineffective parents
[14:23] now these each bad habit
[14:26] you can look at that again uh that slide
[14:27] again each bad habit has in my what i'd
[14:30] like to point out it has a correlation
[14:32] to
[14:33] uh a characteristic in the statue of a
[14:35] perfect man
[14:37] and when we say a correlation there is a
[14:40] there's a contrast so there's some
[14:42] connection but not necessarily in the
[14:44] same sense but one of these negative or
[14:47] bad habits when these seven bad habits
[14:50] is contrasted by or balanced out or uh
[14:53] you know the the other side of it the
[14:55] positive side to it can be found in the
[14:57] statue of a perfect man so if you look
[14:59] at verses five to seven
[15:02] and where we read in our text of the
[15:03] first chapter ii peter
[15:05] it says and beside this giving all
[15:07] diligence add to your faith virtue so
[15:08] there's faith add to that virtue
[15:11] and it is something that's being
[15:13] expressed to us and beside beside this
[15:15] it means therefore thus because of this
[15:18] uh give all diligence to add to your
[15:20] faith
[15:21] virtue into your virtue knowledge so you
[15:23] could even say add to your faith virtue
[15:25] and add to your virtue knowledge and to
[15:27] your knowledge add temperance and to
[15:29] temperance uh you add patience and to
[15:31] patience godliness into godliness really
[15:34] kindness and breadlike kindness charity
[15:36] and this is what brother branham draws
[15:39] from these virtues or these
[15:40] characteristics rather and he calls them
[15:42] the stature of a perfect man and we know
[15:45] that in that pyramid uh that he drew
[15:48] that expresses this and we may find
[15:50] ourselves going into more detail even
[15:52] maybe studying this sermon as a part of
[15:54] this series but a christian expresses
[15:56] these characteristics from faith all the
[15:58] way to charity these are things that are
[16:00] inherent in the life that we receive
[16:02] upon the new birth so when you're born
[16:04] again all these attributes are there now
[16:06] they're in the soul and so the way the
[16:09] language that peter is using is now that
[16:12] there's been this newness of life let
[16:14] there be some development cultivation of
[16:16] it that we can place these virtues where
[16:18] they ought to be they can be made
[16:20] manifest and expressed brother branham
[16:22] referring to this is there's the perfect
[16:24] man of god when he possesses these
[16:26] virtues so this possession is maybe uh
[16:29] related to a placing and a pro and an
[16:32] expression of them
[16:34] in the very beginning of the sermon of
[16:36] the statue of a perfect man brother says
[16:38] this morning we want to speak on the
[16:39] subject or teach rather if we can
[16:41] building the living tabernacle of the
[16:43] living god's dwelling place the perfect
[16:46] man
[16:47] the living tabernacle of the living god
[16:49] where he dwells now all these statements
[16:51] i'm using i'm taking from the statue of
[16:54] a perfect man i didn't provide
[16:56] um these these excerpts for you but
[16:58] they're all coming from the statue of a
[16:59] perfect man so notice that kind of other
[17:02] title building the living tabernacle
[17:04] of the living god's dwelling place the
[17:06] living tabernacle of the living god
[17:08] where he dwells so he can kind of get a
[17:10] full picture of the statue of a perfect
[17:12] man he's talking about building up this
[17:13] tabernacle where god dwells
[17:16] the the tabernacle the living tabernacle
[17:18] of the living god
[17:19] and he and this
[17:22] these descriptions in verses five to
[17:24] seven
[17:26] uh
[17:27] notice what the ver the verse prior to
[17:29] this verse four
[17:30] it says whereby are given unto us
[17:32] exceeding great and precious promises so
[17:35] there is a
[17:36] um there's a divine power that we want
[17:38] to that has been given to us and he says
[17:40] whereby are given unto us exceeding
[17:42] great and precious promises that by
[17:44] these by even by these promises is ii
[17:47] peter chapter 1 verse 4 that by these
[17:49] you might be partakers of the divine
[17:52] nature that means to enter into
[17:54] fellowship with it to have communion
[17:55] with it to be made a partner to just
[17:57] it's actually translated one place to
[17:59] distribute and i thought about that just
[18:01] think that we might be in fellowship and
[18:03] community become a partner with his
[18:05] divine nature but then i even thought to
[18:07] to distribute it
[18:09] not the not even that it would just be
[18:11] distributed to us by the new birth but
[18:13] then we become distributors of the
[18:15] divine nature we broadcast his divine
[18:18] nature and so that we might be partakers
[18:20] of the divine nature this is a very key
[18:22] scripture part of this having escaped
[18:24] the corruption that is in the world
[18:26] through lust now catch that because
[18:29] there's a way that people there's a way
[18:31] that we could read these this statue of
[18:32] a perfect man and walk away thinking oh
[18:35] my what i need to do is i need to get
[18:37] this and then i need to add this then i
[18:39] need to add this and we're going to work
[18:40] our way up to the seal of god and that's
[18:42] not the way this works you're not a
[18:44] peacock putting uh you're not a
[18:46] a black bird who says a crow putting in
[18:48] a black bird putting in peacock feathers
[18:50] you have the life
[18:53] you have that nature and so now it's
[18:54] it's a divine nature that needs to be
[18:56] expressed he says having escaped the
[18:58] corruption that is in the world through
[18:59] lust that's who he's talking to
[19:02] those who by the spirit have been saved
[19:05] and rescued out of sin and placed into
[19:07] the body of christ as a son or daughter
[19:09] of god
[19:10] so he says this in quoting this exact
[19:12] verse this is brother brahma's language
[19:14] about this verse it's to the church
[19:16] them who are in christ
[19:18] have been exalted above these things not
[19:20] he exalted himself but christ brought
[19:22] him up
[19:23] so this commandment to add to
[19:26] your faith and to add in these virtues
[19:29] he says that's not to the unborn again
[19:32] but it's to those who are in christ and
[19:34] have already been raised up
[19:37] into christ
[19:38] and then he says it again now that's the
[19:40] type of person that he's talking to
[19:41] those who are partakers of the divine
[19:43] nature and who have escaped escape the
[19:45] corruption that is in the world through
[19:47] lust that's the type of person that he's
[19:49] talking to the person that has escaped
[19:51] these things the corruption of the world
[19:54] so who's this targeting these stats
[19:56] these virtues it's targeting those who
[19:58] are in the body of christ
[20:00] and then he makes this statement now he
[20:02] has given us the outline here what to do
[20:05] know how to do it now as i said
[20:08] we are all trying to come closer to god
[20:11] he says he's given us an outline here
[20:13] he's given us an outline here of what to
[20:15] do and to know how to do it that's what
[20:17] the statue of a perfect man is it's an
[20:19] outline for those of us who are trying
[20:21] to get closer to god
[20:24] now and i know you're all very familiar
[20:26] with that sermon but i think that i
[20:27] wanted to give that as an outset kind of
[20:29] as a foundation
[20:30] to
[20:31] these this contrast between a a bad
[20:34] habit of a highly ineffective parent and
[20:37] then the statue of a perfect man now
[20:39] this is just going to be very simple
[20:41] and straightforward as we walk through
[20:43] this i'm just going to give you the
[20:45] uh the bad habit what it's contrasted by
[20:47] and then just read to you a little bit
[20:48] of an excerpt from the statue of a
[20:50] perfect man
[20:51] now the over emphasizing carnal things
[20:54] that was the first bad habit that we
[20:56] express this over emphasizing carnal
[20:58] things is contrasted by faith
[21:01] and that being that foundational point
[21:03] of the statue of a perfect man i have
[21:05] not provided maybe
[21:07] the pyramid working itself up we're just
[21:09] going to kind of look at this in these
[21:11] terminologies over emphasizing carnal
[21:14] things
[21:15] is contrasted by faith and i'll say this
[21:18] as parents we ought to be word focused
[21:21] this ought to be something that our
[21:22] children can readily identify in our
[21:24] natures ought to be something that's um
[21:26] instinct and even habit that the word
[21:29] has preeminence in our families in our
[21:31] home life and that our children
[21:33] recognize
[21:35] that church
[21:36] the word is more than school
[21:39] that the word is more than recreation
[21:41] the word is more that these things these
[21:43] things mean more and that we make
[21:45] decisions in light of that
[21:46] and that we actually would rather see
[21:48] our children excel in the things of god
[21:50] than in athletics and in school and all
[21:52] these other things knowing that if the
[21:54] word has parameters in their lives he is
[21:56] the x factor that'll allow them to excel
[21:59] when maybe the grades aren't very good
[22:01] or maybe the opportunities aren't
[22:02] presenting themselves but when they've
[22:03] honored the lord he brings honor to them
[22:06] and will look out after them i can i
[22:08] know even brother branham taught that
[22:10] when your children have a test the next
[22:12] morning to pray over it or they have a
[22:14] test that day pray
[22:16] with them over that test and i would
[22:18] have more confidence in that than i
[22:20] would um to lay out of a church for a
[22:22] couple weeks before finals because i
[22:24] want my children to do well on their
[22:26] exams
[22:28] and so brother man makes the statement
[22:29] in the statute of a perfect man he says
[22:31] now you're going to build a house
[22:33] and you pour the foundation say boy i
[22:34] got her he said you've got the
[22:36] foundation to build your house on now
[22:38] you got to build a house now there's
[22:40] where the big thing comes in this
[22:41] morning we're going to talk about now a
[22:43] house this foundation is first what is
[22:45] the foundation of christianity faith in
[22:48] the word of god
[22:49] that's your foundation then you begin to
[22:52] grow then you start you begin to add to
[22:54] this foundation so when we take
[22:57] an overemphasis of carnal things and
[22:59] contrast it by faith
[23:01] i believe that we should be making a
[23:03] conscious and deliberate effort to base
[23:05] our family on the right things
[23:08] and that we are placing our children
[23:10] upon a foundation of spiritual things
[23:13] and so in doing so we we should have
[23:16] we should demonstrate within our choices
[23:18] and our decisions to give to put
[23:21] emphasis on spiritual things and brother
[23:24] brother reggie mentioned it sunday
[23:26] morning
[23:26] and it had been part of my thought
[23:28] process that the the the activity of a
[23:31] family devotion
[23:32] is so important for instilling in our
[23:34] children this idea that the word of god
[23:37] matters
[23:38] and it gives you a context and i think i
[23:40] want to go into greater detail on these
[23:42] so i'm going to try to limit myself
[23:44] hopefully from expounding too much on it
[23:46] but just as you pull will expound on it
[23:49] but that there is a uh to have that kind
[23:52] of discipline is giving our children
[23:54] this this
[23:55] habit and this as we say could say
[23:57] routine and it's certainly not a
[23:58] negative one at all to where they're
[24:00] hearing the word of god they're relating
[24:02] to the word of god it has preeminence
[24:04] it's part of our language as a family
[24:05] it's something that we do together even
[24:07] the sacrifices made to come to church
[24:10] and some of you travel great distances
[24:12] and and make that effort that's teaching
[24:14] your children something and they're
[24:16] realizing this this is there's worth and
[24:19] value in this
[24:20] and and so this is what we're looking at
[24:22] in terms of uh uh the the contrast of
[24:25] over emphasizing carnal things what we
[24:28] want to do as parents is not to have so
[24:30] much of the world have preeminence but
[24:32] to really have that foundation of faith
[24:35] in the word of god
[24:37] the second part the second bad habit
[24:40] inconsistently
[24:42] instructing and correcting
[24:45] is contrasted by uh virtue
[24:48] did did my slide have those that those
[24:50] uh those animations in it
[24:53] oh my i didn't realize i had done it
[24:55] that way see i i just even
[24:56] subconsciously make it more complicated
[24:58] than it ought to be
[25:00] but
[25:01] that's what happens when you don't uh
[25:03] don't test it beforehand which i usually
[25:04] do but just didn't have the time to date
[25:09] so it's inconsistently instructing
[25:12] and correcting that's really a mouthful
[25:14] in that because uh it was very
[25:17] deliberate in the words that i chose
[25:19] because there's things that we do when
[25:20] we discipline our children that is
[25:22] instructive and then there's also things
[25:24] that are corrective and it's contrasted
[25:26] by virtue
[25:28] and if i could say this and i'm looking
[25:30] for a really really easy loud amen from
[25:33] the parents but it takes diligence to
[25:35] raise children
[25:37] it takes a lot of perseverance and a lot
[25:40] of energy and a lot of labor i remember
[25:42] one of the first what i thought was a
[25:43] revelation after we had elliott was this
[25:45] is how you grow old and die
[25:48] as you have a baby you never catch up on
[25:50] sleep and you just kind of eventually
[25:52] wither away
[25:53] over a period of decades and the the the
[25:56] the shedding point the tipping point was
[25:57] the birth of that child
[25:59] and uh i caught up on my sleep i think
[26:01] my wife eventually did too because i
[26:03] learned after a while he's not crying
[26:04] for me he's crying for mom
[26:07] he's gonna be okay i'm gonna be okay and
[26:09] i caught up on my sleep but then you
[26:11] realize that to raise children um
[26:13] there's a lot of there's a lot of effort
[26:15] that needs to be put in it especially at
[26:17] the outset
[26:19] and what i recognize in our own lives
[26:21] and then you see it happen in other
[26:22] families there's a lot of things that we
[26:24] can do to buy ourselves some time to get
[26:26] you know to not be pressured or to be
[26:28] bothered or to not have to deal with
[26:30] things and we just make decisions to
[26:31] kind of put off the immediate need to
[26:34] address something or to teach our
[26:36] children that they don't always have to
[26:38] be entertained or learn to sit still and
[26:40] be quiet and instead of just going
[26:42] through maybe days or weeks or months or
[26:44] several different instances where it may
[26:46] be difficult but you take the time to
[26:48] teach them what's right in that
[26:49] situation what we do sometimes is we
[26:51] just want to hand it off to something
[26:53] else because it's just easier
[26:55] it's just easier in the moment i don't i
[26:57] i'll just let them have this or let them
[26:59] do that because it just it's easier than
[27:01] just constantly saying no you need to
[27:02] sit still you need to be quiet you need
[27:03] to learn to be still you need to learn
[27:04] to this you need to learn to do that
[27:06] and brother branham and espousing on
[27:09] espousing on virtue
[27:11] he says virtue and before you can let it
[27:13] out you've got to have it first
[27:16] and so if we if we want our children to
[27:18] be learning and be virtuous then we have
[27:20] to have it to give he says you haven't
[27:22] got it it won't come out there's nothing
[27:23] for it to come out of what if someone
[27:25] tried to draw virtue out of us and the
[27:27] check would return insufficient funds
[27:30] that'd be weird if there was just a way
[27:31] that
[27:32] your your advice could bounce
[27:34] right
[27:36] i'm just while you know what really you
[27:37] should do in this situation is
[27:39] it just comes right back to you
[27:41] and like it didn't cash bro i'm sorry it
[27:44] it whatever you're giving me you don't
[27:46] really have the virtue to give and so
[27:47] you're saying if
[27:48] if you're the virtue the check would
[27:50] return insufficient funds no no none
[27:52] there to draw from check bounced
[27:54] somebody look at you as a christian and
[27:56] tomorrow you see out there carrying on
[27:57] like a sinner not much virtue can be
[27:59] drawn from that
[28:00] this is where you can see some of an
[28:02] overlap to where there's a lot that
[28:03] brother brandon uses in terms of example
[28:05] example she says there's no virtue to be
[28:07] drawn from doing one thing one day and
[28:09] doing something the next he says virtue
[28:11] must be in us
[28:13] virtue anyone knows what the word virtue
[28:15] means and we must have it if virtue went
[28:17] from us from him to heal the woman that
[28:19] was sick he's expecting the same virtue
[28:22] in his church
[28:23] do you hear that if virtue went from him
[28:25] to heal the sick woman he's expecting
[28:28] virtue to be in his church the same
[28:29] virtue therefore we are to be a touch
[28:32] point from virtue to come forth from us
[28:35] to others who need it and what a better
[28:36] place to start to be virtuous and to
[28:38] give virtue than in your home
[28:41] he says because he was our example and
[28:43] if he had virtue to give to the people
[28:45] he expects us to have virtue to give to
[28:47] the people
[28:48] and amazing
[28:50] he expects us to have virtue to give to
[28:52] the people this is not just a preacher
[28:53] on the platform
[28:55] and him
[28:56] uh
[28:57] you know having virtue to give and you
[28:59] pulling from the gift and him becoming
[29:01] completely drained because you pulled
[29:02] all this virtue out it's not just a
[29:04] virtue that would manifest itself in a
[29:05] gifted man but this is the virtue that
[29:07] ought to be in the sons and daughters of
[29:09] god for us to give
[29:10] and he says what is virtue virtue is
[29:12] strength
[29:13] power
[29:15] and this is where i connect it with
[29:16] being consistent being consistent with
[29:18] how we discipline being consistent with
[29:20] how we instruct being consistent with
[29:22] how we correct because in order to do
[29:23] that it takes fortitude uh this
[29:26] inconsistency really is a lack of
[29:28] perseverance
[29:29] of just maybe maybe you sigh a little
[29:31] bit maybe you take a deep breath but
[29:32] going
[29:33] i gotta stick this out
[29:35] i gotta stay with this i gotta stay on
[29:36] top of this and not just giving in now
[29:39] if my children are really listening
[29:40] today they know exactly what's taking
[29:42] this is exactly what's happening when
[29:44] i'm working or i'm studying and sister
[29:47] elizabeth goes to the grocery store or
[29:49] she's going to go run an errand and as
[29:50] soon as she leaves the kids know i'm
[29:52] there at my desk working so they know
[29:54] i'm kind of weak i'm distracted it's
[29:56] like dad can we eat all the rocky road
[29:58] ice cream like yeah just go
[30:01] hey
[30:01] you know that's their moment to ask the
[30:03] world because i'm going to give it to
[30:04] them because they're i'm not taking the
[30:06] time to slow down say wait a minute you
[30:08] want what
[30:10] why do you want it and and
[30:12] to work through the situation why
[30:14] because that takes some fortitude
[30:16] takes some perseverance again let me
[30:18] remind you i chose the seven bad habits
[30:20] of highly ineffective parents because i
[30:23] know these really well
[30:26] i know what does not work i'm not going
[30:27] to pretend to be an expert
[30:29] on what the the habits of a highly
[30:31] effective parent
[30:33] is
[30:35] so now in the next one improperly
[30:37] judging
[30:39] and properly judging is contrasted by
[30:41] knowledge if i could say this based upon
[30:44] the
[30:44] um
[30:46] based upon the things in the statue of a
[30:48] perfect man there is uh
[30:53] we we there we have to have
[30:56] and we want to be sensitive to this i'm
[30:57] just wanting to choose my words very
[30:58] carefully
[30:59] we need to be very sensitive this
[31:01] that whenever we're dealing with others
[31:04] dealing with people i mean this again
[31:05] this is applicable to not just
[31:07] relationships with our children
[31:09] but we need to properly discern what is
[31:12] edifying
[31:14] how can i approach this that would edify
[31:17] there's a lot of things that take place
[31:18] in our lives and we have a knee-jerk
[31:20] reaction and i'll say this that as
[31:21] christians many times our initial imp
[31:24] impression may be absolutely correct
[31:27] that that we we recognize immediately
[31:29] that something's not right but there has
[31:31] to be another layer to this discernment
[31:33] another layer to what's happening to
[31:34] where we can discern what the right way
[31:37] to judge something the right way to
[31:39] handle it the right way to go about
[31:41] dealing with the situation so that we
[31:43] promote our repentance we promote growth
[31:45] we promote correction
[31:47] and we're not just inflicting pain or
[31:50] consequence as the result of doing
[31:51] something wrong
[31:53] a lot of our base instincts as humans is
[31:55] just to cause pain or shame or hurt when
[31:58] someone does something wrong but we want
[32:00] to respond in such a way that it
[32:02] actually addresses the underlying issue
[32:04] and kind of promotes a resolution to it
[32:07] and this is when i say improperly
[32:08] judging it means there's no there's not
[32:10] that knowledge where we judge and
[32:12] according to the word of god where we
[32:14] can begin to recognize maybe motive and
[32:16] objective and begin to actually um
[32:20] address appropriately what's taking
[32:21] place
[32:22] in the sermon statue of perfect man
[32:24] brother evan says knowledge now that
[32:25] don't mean worldly knowledge because
[32:27] that's foolishness to god but knowledge
[32:30] to judge judge right from wrong
[32:33] if you begin just to look at this that
[32:35] we have faith as a parent we're rooted
[32:37] and grounded in faith and this faith
[32:39] then can give us this emphasis on the
[32:42] right things then having virtue it gives
[32:45] us this fortitude to give consistent uh
[32:47] correction to give consistent we have
[32:49] this diligence in raising our children
[32:52] and now with knowledge according to the
[32:54] word of god to judge by the word of god
[32:56] we can judge correctly even the hearts
[32:58] of our children
[33:01] if you i believe that you have the right
[33:02] as a parent today that if you're you're
[33:04] struggling with maybe some stubbornness
[33:06] you're struggling with with something
[33:08] taking place in your children you're not
[33:10] sure just quite how to address it i
[33:11] believe you can ask god to give you the
[33:13] discernment as to what the issue
[33:15] actually is instead of just maybe all
[33:18] the things that are presenting itself
[33:20] because there could be rebellion and
[33:21] stubbornness and emotions that we're
[33:23] you're dealing with and all you're doing
[33:24] is just
[33:25] you're just kind of hitting hitting it
[33:27] as it rises up and hitting it as it
[33:28] rises up but if god could give you the
[33:30] discernment to find out what's giving
[33:32] birth to those things and what's causing
[33:34] them to come up and you do that by
[33:36] knowledge by knowledge according to the
[33:37] word of god
[33:39] because we could deal with symptoms all
[33:40] day long but it's the word that's going
[33:42] to identify the cause
[33:44] he says how do you judge it
[33:45] if then if you've got christian
[33:47] knowledge with your virtue and faith you
[33:48] judge whether the word is right or wrong
[33:51] to judge judge right judge whether it's
[33:53] right or wrong to believe god's word
[33:54] these are things he's saying about
[33:55] knowledge to judge by the word judge by
[33:58] the word judged by the word
[34:00] knowledge not worldly knowledge but it's
[34:02] a heavenly knowledge and heavenly
[34:04] knowledge when god is the foundation of
[34:05] all knowledge and god is the word
[34:07] then if you've got heavenly knowledge
[34:09] you believe the word and notice this and
[34:12] you reason anything by the word
[34:16] you reason anything by the word this is
[34:18] a tool that we use now
[34:20] as as um well you could just see how the
[34:23] inverse you can kind of figure out maybe
[34:24] some highly effective habits of a good
[34:26] uh uh some habits of a highly effective
[34:28] parent you reason things by the word
[34:32] so it's going to give us that knowledge
[34:34] we need to judge and to judge our
[34:35] children's hearts
[34:40] judging by the word
[34:43] the next
[34:44] bad habit is inappropriately using voice
[34:47] this is just a real clumsy way maybe to
[34:49] say shouting
[34:51] but
[34:52] inappropriately using voice
[34:54] and i'm contrasting this by temperance
[34:58] and
[34:59] truly
[35:01] and i'm not i i don't want to be
[35:02] misunderstood
[35:05] i believe that there is a place for uh
[35:07] raising your voice
[35:09] and and there's times when you need to
[35:11] have a greater emphasis and the only way
[35:13] that you're going to be able to do that
[35:14] is maybe to achieve another volume but
[35:17] there is a yelling
[35:19] that can be very harmful
[35:21] and there are harsh words that are not
[35:23] simply not fruitful
[35:25] and so it's not merely yelling i guess
[35:27] you could whisper some of the things
[35:29] that parents say to their children it'd
[35:31] be just as harmful as if you yelled it
[35:33] and it can be shocking it can be
[35:35] shocking the words that people use
[35:37] towards their children
[35:39] and i've encountered this mostly in the
[35:40] world where you are actually just i
[35:42] think any of these instances i could
[35:44] think of would probably be in the world
[35:45] where somebody has just called their
[35:47] children stupid or said things very very
[35:50] harsh and in your mind you're thinking
[35:52] well if they're going to say that in
[35:53] public
[35:54] you know what are the kind of things
[35:55] that they're saying to this child and
[35:57] how is it how is the child then
[35:58] internalizing that
[36:00] and and i i was talking to some
[36:03] i can't remember where i was and maybe
[36:04] when some of my kids were there
[36:06] uh when this was set it was at the
[36:08] meetings this past weekend and one of
[36:10] the kids said said his name was face
[36:12] plant
[36:13] was that it was it was it faced plant
[36:15] who remember yeah it's face plant like
[36:16] face plant and his sister was named bug
[36:19] and uh his name was face plant and i'm
[36:21] like face plant well you must have
[36:23] earned that name right and he told the
[36:25] story how i'm always tripping and
[36:26] falling flat on my face so my parents
[36:28] call me face plant
[36:30] now the thought i have is he will
[36:32] probably do that the rest of his life
[36:34] just because he thinks that's what his
[36:35] nature is
[36:37] he's been given a label right he's the
[36:39] one that face plants and we can start
[36:41] giving labels to our kids oh they're the
[36:43] ones that love coconut cream pie and
[36:45] they're like i do
[36:47] right just because they asked for it one
[36:49] time because somebody else asked for it
[36:51] and then that one birthday when they're
[36:52] four years old they asked for coconut
[36:54] cream pie because that's just the only
[36:55] thing they could think of for the rest
[36:57] of their lives they get coconut cream
[36:58] pie and they're 32 years old saying yeah
[37:00] my favorite pie is coconut cream pie and
[37:02] then i realized no that was something
[37:04] random right
[37:06] because you were jr tippins or whatever
[37:08] and somebody there at the table ordered
[37:11] the uh or shonies maybe that may be a
[37:13] better reference you're at shoni's
[37:15] and somebody orders coconut cream pie
[37:17] and at four years old that just kind of
[37:18] sticks in your head and you order and
[37:20] now you're the coconut cream pie kid
[37:22] not because you love it but it was just
[37:24] something that you learned
[37:26] and so there's a um there's a way that
[37:29] we can talk to our children that imposes
[37:32] on them sentences
[37:33] they're going to live under that the
[37:34] rest of their lives there's a way that
[37:36] we inappropriately use our voice and use
[37:38] our language and use our tongues that
[37:39] are very very harmful and this is easily
[37:41] contrasted by temperance especially
[37:43] given what brother branham says about
[37:45] temperance
[37:46] he says this bible temperance holy
[37:48] spirit temperance that's just one of the
[37:50] lusts of the flesh but we're talking
[37:51] about holy spirit temperance
[37:54] that means how to control your tongue
[37:57] not be a tattler
[38:00] how to control your temper
[38:03] not fly off every time anybody speaks
[38:05] cross to you
[38:06] well now i think this is good for all of
[38:08] us
[38:10] this is good for parents because we
[38:11] could teach our children
[38:13] just by way that we use our voice to
[38:14] others we're teaching them how to talk
[38:16] that's how they learn language right
[38:18] that's how they've learned to talk in
[38:20] your home you you may have to teach them
[38:21] to read but you didn't really have to
[38:23] teach them that hard to talk they're
[38:24] just picking it up
[38:25] and that's why sometimes when kids say
[38:27] things and whole kids say they say they
[38:29] can say the the most interesting things
[38:32] right
[38:32] and they say it maybe just like an adult
[38:34] would
[38:35] and they have just a little bit of
[38:36] attitude they say something you say i
[38:38] know what it's like at home
[38:40] right i know exactly the way the parents
[38:42] talk to each other i know how things
[38:43] take place at home because they're
[38:45] mimicking language they're learning this
[38:46] so he says control your tongue don't be
[38:48] a tattler control your temper don't fly
[38:50] off when anytime someone speaks cross to
[38:52] you this is things that we have in
[38:54] practice and therefore this is a
[38:56] temperance we ought to have as
[38:57] christians and then this is uh this has
[39:00] been useful in parenting to where i'm
[39:02] not going to inappropriately use my
[39:04] tongue with my children
[39:06] he says old temperance how to answer in
[39:08] kindness when wrath is spoke to you
[39:11] how to answer in kindness to your
[39:12] children when rebellion spoke to you
[39:14] when disobedience has spoke to you when
[39:16] their attitudes are spoken to and they
[39:17] raise their voice when they stomp off
[39:18] when they slam the door when they won't
[39:20] listen when they get hard when they get
[39:22] rebel you see somebody say you bunch of
[39:23] holy rollers down there don't jump out
[39:25] and roll up your sleeves now
[39:27] not that now let's just think of how
[39:28] that could be applicable
[39:30] to
[39:31] situations in parenting i guess there is
[39:33] really nothing like an eight-year-old to
[39:35] make a parent act like an eight-year-old
[39:39] nothing like a teenager to make a grown
[39:40] man act like a teenager why because
[39:42] you're seating like are you serious you
[39:44] know you want to just kind of mirror
[39:45] right back at him but i don't know that
[39:47] you're helping the situation
[39:49] i'll never forget the first time i ever
[39:51] i was with elliot and i thought you know
[39:53] whenever they get hurt i didn't want him
[39:54] to you know continue to cry and so i
[39:57] think he'd run into something and i was
[39:59] like i said oh bad table bad shouldn't
[40:02] have done that i was gonna blame the
[40:02] table and he was just like yeah bad
[40:04] table wham
[40:06] and i was like yeah we'll just change
[40:07] that we'll just change that approach
[40:10] next thing you know there's a big hole
[40:11] in the windows like yeah i ran into the
[40:13] i ran into the door and i just i let it
[40:15] happen
[40:16] so
[40:19] you have to be temperate
[40:22] and not just roll up your sleeves at the
[40:24] wall if it hurts you
[40:26] he says but talk with godly love
[40:28] temperance kindness is that the way you
[40:30] want to be
[40:31] when you're riled upon rile not back he
[40:34] says let him be your example
[40:37] and this is applicable then in parenting
[40:38] where there are situations that might
[40:40] provoke us might kind of needle us a
[40:42] little bit might be able to kind of get
[40:43] this riled up but in the same way that
[40:45] we're trying to demonstrate to our
[40:46] children you should not have responded
[40:48] that way you shouldn't use that kind of
[40:50] language you shouldn't yell you
[40:51] shouldn't do this we're gonna we're
[40:53] gonna mirror that to our children by
[40:56] appropriately using language and voice
[40:58] and being very uh careful in the words
[41:00] that we use i think it's very easy maybe
[41:02] to get legalistic with it
[41:04] but maybe there's phrases that we
[41:06] instinctively use or things that we say
[41:08] immediately to our children that may not
[41:10] be helping the situation
[41:12] and we can begin to change our speech
[41:14] change our initial reaction this
[41:15] temperance this self-control the
[41:17] controlling of our tongues in the way
[41:19] that we speak to our children
[41:21] i will say that for myself one of the
[41:23] biggest regrets i have as a father is
[41:25] ever using a loud voice to correct
[41:29] and i wish i could have been much more
[41:31] circumspect in waiting and timely using
[41:33] it now i will say that at times i think
[41:35] preston may not hear as well as the
[41:36] others because you might have to use a
[41:38] little bit louder voice with him
[41:39] but a loud voice can be very very could
[41:42] undermine the very things you're saying
[41:43] because all they hear is your tone and
[41:44] your volume and not what you just said
[41:47] and so it's something to to ponder
[41:49] tremendously
[41:50] because it's a bad habit of a highly
[41:53] ineffective parent to inappropriately
[41:55] use voice
[41:58] the next one is
[42:00] wrongly disciplining
[42:03] and we're going to contrast this by
[42:05] patience
[42:07] wrongly disciplining
[42:09] contrasted by patience
[42:12] there's a again this is another mouthful
[42:14] but one of the most
[42:17] something that
[42:18] undermines our discipline
[42:20] is when we do it through pride
[42:23] it's a lot of instances where we find
[42:24] ourselves wanting to address something
[42:26] not because the conduct in itself was
[42:28] necessarily wrong but it's the way it
[42:30] made us look
[42:31] and and we can parent from the point of
[42:33] pride and we do that it really it really
[42:35] sews the wrong things into our children
[42:37] and so if we punish through pride we
[42:39] punish through frustration then what
[42:40] happens it breeds the same things in the
[42:42] hearts of our children
[42:44] even a man of god if he gets up to the
[42:46] pope and he preaches because he's
[42:47] jealous you're going to sow jealousy
[42:48] into the people if you preach because
[42:50] you're suspicious alone it's going to
[42:51] sow it into the people if you do it
[42:52] because you're frustrated and you're mad
[42:54] it's going to sow into the people
[42:56] and i've heard pastors testify of how
[42:59] there was just some darkness upon the
[43:00] people he's preaching the word preaching
[43:02] the word preaching he couldn't couldn't
[43:03] find any fault with the word that's
[43:04] being preached but there's just
[43:05] something in the people that god opened
[43:08] up their eyes to see there was some
[43:10] complex there was something underneath
[43:12] all of that driving it in unbeknownst to
[43:14] him the very
[43:15] even though it was the word that spirit
[43:17] was carrying on those words and the
[43:19] people were receiving it and they would
[43:21] have never figured out where it was
[43:22] coming from but it's just the way that
[43:24] if you're if you're frustrated if you're
[43:26] angry if you if your pride's been hurt
[43:28] then you parent or correct from that
[43:30] position you're going to inflict the
[43:32] same into your child
[43:35] frustration and anger and those things
[43:37] that you got to be very very careful and
[43:39] so this to when we disciplined the wrong
[43:41] way
[43:42] we can we can
[43:44] we could change that by having patience
[43:47] bill graham says in the statute of a
[43:48] perfect man he says and we should have
[43:50] patience with one another too
[43:52] we get so much impatient with one
[43:54] another's
[43:55] right and we do it with our children
[43:57] it says we think we got to be we think
[43:59] we got to be like moses moses had
[44:01] patience with the people
[44:02] he says we think we got to be like moses
[44:04] he says moses had patience with the
[44:06] people look that's what caused them to
[44:08] not go over
[44:09] and he said and listen very closely here
[44:11] we're um
[44:13] we just have a little bit more to go and
[44:15] we're going to close so
[44:17] i feel that i'm very near so if you
[44:18] could just kind of work up some
[44:20] uh work up some
[44:22] uh attention i'm it's it's 11 15 my
[44:25] body's time i am tired i don't think i
[44:27] went to bed
[44:28] on average i was going to bed at like 3
[44:30] o'clock in the morning if that kind of
[44:31] helps you
[44:32] well if i haven't if i have an excuse
[44:34] for tonight it's like remember aaron you
[44:35] just really weren't there well i got an
[44:36] excuse
[44:38] and i apologize profusely if you want
[44:40] maybe we won't have service tomorrow
[44:41] night tomorrow night i'll nap
[44:44] and i'll maybe come back and try to do
[44:45] this a little bit better
[44:48] he says he says and so focus how he says
[44:50] this because you could read into what
[44:52] he's saying like i've tried to get this
[44:54] message over at the tabernacle to see
[44:56] that each member of the tabernacle
[44:57] becomes this
[44:59] he wants them to become this status of a
[45:00] perfect man it's hard to do i've tried
[45:03] to have patience this is 33 years have
[45:06] patience women still bob their hair
[45:08] still just the same but just have
[45:10] patience
[45:11] just have patience wait have to
[45:13] if you ain't got it don't try to build
[45:15] on this down here have patience notice
[45:18] what he's saying that he's trying to
[45:19] teach something 33 years i've been
[45:21] trying to teach him been trying to teach
[45:22] him and what is he saying i just i have
[45:24] to have patience
[45:25] i can't give up
[45:27] i can't stop he says just wait i have to
[45:29] each time each one time when rebellion
[45:32] bunch of people had such impatience they
[45:34] caused moses to do something that was
[45:36] wrong
[45:37] but yet when it come to a showdown god
[45:39] got sick of their action he said
[45:41] separate yourself moses i'll kill the
[45:43] whole bunch of them and start anew and
[45:46] then notice it says he moses threw
[45:48] himself into the breach and said god
[45:49] don't do it
[45:51] and he says what patience with the
[45:53] people that were rebelling against him
[45:57] so it's actually moses that stood in the
[45:59] gap
[46:00] and moses didn't get frustrated moses
[46:02] said yeah you know what enough's enough
[46:04] it's about time you just tried decided
[46:06] to destroy all of them no he threw
[46:08] himself in the gap and brother brown's
[46:09] making this uh likening this to patience
[46:12] he was patient with the people that were
[46:14] rebelling
[46:15] so it's through his patience that he
[46:17] restrained from severe punishment
[46:21] this is demonstrative of the meekness
[46:22] that moses had because certainly in this
[46:24] instance he could have just took take a
[46:26] step back and said let him have it god
[46:28] go for it they deserve it even these
[46:29] people they're pressuring him and
[46:31] putting pressure on him he he dug down
[46:33] deep and acted in meekness because he
[46:36] was strained though he could have
[46:38] exercised allowed god to exercise the
[46:40] power though he could have added his
[46:41] voice and support to severe punishment
[46:43] through his meekness he said no no let's
[46:46] wait let's have patience and he stood in
[46:48] the gap
[46:49] and if we should have patience for one
[46:51] another then we ought to have patience
[46:53] for our children
[46:56] i was preaching at a minister's meeting
[46:58] one time
[46:59] and i may have mentioned this to you
[47:03] and the subject was the five definite
[47:05] identifications of the true church of
[47:07] the living god
[47:09] and just drawn it straight from the um
[47:12] straight from the message that brother
[47:14] brown taught now my i was asked to speak
[47:16] and i was told that i was going to go
[47:18] first and my overarching theme kind of
[47:20] my thesis was the local church is not
[47:23] the true church
[47:25] and so the five definite identifications
[47:27] of the true church apply to
[47:29] the true church but not necessarily the
[47:31] local church but as a local church our
[47:34] vision is to promote these five
[47:36] definitive identifications
[47:38] in
[47:39] the individual members of the true
[47:40] church or to serve that purpose of the
[47:42] true church well somehow the order got
[47:44] mixed up and the person that went before
[47:45] me their thesis was the exact opposite
[47:47] of mine
[47:48] and so i was a little bit nervous about
[47:50] how in the world am i going to do this
[47:51] and i thought you know what that's just
[47:52] what ministers meetings are for though
[47:54] is to say with all due respect i
[47:55] disagree with the first brothers
[47:58] but god gave grace and one of the uh one
[48:00] of the things that was really emphasized
[48:02] in the first part
[48:04] was how the sanctuary is the dwelling
[48:06] place of god and we ought to respect the
[48:09] sanctuary and
[48:10] and is very very forceful on how
[48:12] important the building was how important
[48:14] the sanctuary was and how important it
[48:16] was to show respect and all these people
[48:18] that show respect and now if that's true
[48:20] of this sanctuary
[48:23] what about you and i
[48:25] you are the dwelling place of god you
[48:27] are the town you are the temple of the
[48:29] holy ghost and so if we would show
[48:30] reverence and respect to this sanctuary
[48:32] oh be careful be careful don't want to
[48:34] upset that don't want to be
[48:35] disrespectful don't want to be
[48:36] disorderly if we would do that to this
[48:38] sanctuary what about how we treat one
[48:40] another
[48:41] and then by extension what about our
[48:43] children their hearts that if we want to
[48:45] raise them to be dwelling places of god
[48:48] then how respectful we ought to be of
[48:50] that vessel that body their spirit
[48:54] exercising patience
[48:57] in the way that we correct and
[48:58] discipline
[48:59] you know children are first learning
[49:02] to obey god as they obey their parents
[49:06] and you will either make it easy on them
[49:08] or you'll make it hard on them
[49:09] and truly maybe this will be another
[49:11] part of kids eat free when you recognize
[49:13] the judgment that comes upon a child for
[49:15] disrespect in their parents
[49:17] then it'll humble you as to how you want
[49:20] to be the kind of parent they can
[49:21] respect
[49:22] and to make their obedience easy
[49:27] and so that's wrongly disciplining not
[49:30] being an example
[49:31] we could say being a bad example but not
[49:33] being an example as we've already heard
[49:35] brother branham reference a few times
[49:37] contrasting this
[49:38] with godliness
[49:40] being a
[49:41] not being an example contrasted by god
[49:44] this is a very simple
[49:45] and straightforward one here this next
[49:47] one too we'll just kind of uh wrap him
[49:49] up very
[49:50] succinctly he says godliness means to be
[49:52] god like god and he says oh my and i say
[49:55] oh my myself
[49:57] gosh means to be like god
[49:59] he says but you know what godliness
[50:01] meant you've sang in the song to be like
[50:04] jesus
[50:05] to be like jesus on earth i long to be
[50:07] like him
[50:08] all through life's journey from earth to
[50:10] glory i only asked to be like kim he
[50:12] said that's godliness
[50:14] when he was smite on one side of the
[50:15] face he turned the other when he was
[50:17] spoken rough to he didn't speak he
[50:20] didn't rile back
[50:21] godly always looking for one thing i'll
[50:24] always do that which pleases the father
[50:26] yes sir always that's godliness
[50:30] jesus did now notice in this dynamic to
[50:32] me this is what gives us this image of
[50:34] how
[50:35] uh
[50:36] in effect a bad habit
[50:38] is to not be a good example or to be a
[50:41] bad example or not being an example
[50:43] because he says on earth i long to be
[50:46] like him and he says to be like god
[50:48] notice it's not necessarily just to be
[50:50] like jesus but to be like god who
[50:52] afforded jesus the positive example
[50:55] because he says i only do that which
[50:57] pleases the father so jesus did what the
[51:00] father demonstrated or what the father
[51:03] did what he saw the father doing what do
[51:05] you hear the father say he did so that's
[51:07] the way i want you to look at it as god
[51:09] as the ultimate parent was affording
[51:11] christ the example that he likewise
[51:13] followed in then we can view ourselves
[51:15] as standing in the stead of god to our
[51:17] children and in every situation i long
[51:20] to be the example
[51:22] for my children
[51:24] and the way that i talk to servers and
[51:26] the way that i talk to people at the
[51:28] front desk where i talk to people in the
[51:31] service industry the way i talk to
[51:33] people in the world the way that i
[51:35] respond the way that i act the way that
[51:36] i talk to people that cut me off in
[51:38] traffic the way i talk about people in
[51:40] church
[51:42] i mean wouldn't that be interesting if i
[51:44] came up here on a kid's eat free night
[51:45] and just grabbed one of these mics and
[51:47] just said i'm gonna call the children up
[51:48] and i have them come up and say now how
[51:49] does your mom feel about sister
[51:51] so-and-so
[51:53] right you know just just ask him
[51:55] are you getting nervous next wednesday
[51:57] night nobody's going to be here
[51:59] i'm like well we didn't know if it was
[52:00] going to be open mic night brother aaron
[52:03] but isn't that sobering to think
[52:06] that the things that we can so freely
[52:08] say
[52:09] and just what that can sow into the
[52:11] children the thoughts because they you
[52:12] may say something and it means something
[52:14] to you but in their minds they they
[52:16] struggle so difficult so difficult for
[52:18] them to get their heads around it
[52:19] because they're not thinking the same
[52:20] way you do
[52:22] i heard a story here recently of how
[52:25] a little girl told their parent
[52:29] told their friend at school i know who
[52:30] the tooth fairy is
[52:33] and it was like
[52:34] it's my dad
[52:37] and instead of the little girl kind of
[52:38] thinking that's your dad
[52:41] instead of kind of thinking logically
[52:42] that there is no tooth fairy this other
[52:44] girl went home and said mom
[52:46] i know who the tooth fairy is
[52:49] it's my friend's dad
[52:52] and went like her whole life at least
[52:54] for some period of time believing that
[52:55] the tooth fairy was her friend's dad
[52:58] and just kind of be in awe of this guy
[53:00] like wow this is amazing that's how kids
[53:02] can think sometimes like we make a
[53:04] comment and the kid lacks the car the
[53:06] bigger context their minds just work a
[53:08] little bit differently and so we want to
[53:11] and again this is where you can see a
[53:12] lot of overlap in these things we want
[53:14] to always demonstrate the right example
[53:18] a bad habit is being a bad example
[53:22] we can overcome that through godliness
[53:25] the seventh one and this is the the last
[53:28] bad habit of a highly ineffective parent
[53:31] i hope there's a
[53:32] a new paradigm to view the way that we
[53:34] act sometimes as parents but this is
[53:36] the seventh one withholding grace we're
[53:38] contrasting this with
[53:40] brotherly kindness
[53:43] to
[53:46] and i'm going to read a statement that
[53:47] kind of focuses this
[53:49] what i mean by withholding grace is that
[53:53] the way that we might treat someone
[53:56] and the way that we might deal with them
[53:58] can be so severe and so harsh
[54:01] and in doing so
[54:03] we're not seeing that this it connects
[54:05] so well with where i was going actually
[54:06] i think the anecdote i just used about
[54:08] the tooth fairy would have been more
[54:09] appropriate here but
[54:11] when we can exercise brotherly kindness
[54:13] we see things through their eyes
[54:17] we forget what it's like to be a kid
[54:20] it's easy for me at 47 years old to look
[54:22] at elliott at 14
[54:24] and use a 47 year old mind
[54:27] and not remember what it's like to be
[54:29] 14.
[54:31] and and we can do this on so many
[54:32] different levels and so what what i'm
[54:34] expressing in this in terms of brotherly
[54:36] kindness is the anecdote to withholding
[54:38] grace because what we need to do is show
[54:39] empathy
[54:42] and if we can't be empathetic at least
[54:43] be sympathetic
[54:45] but really all of us can relate that you
[54:47] know at one time we were there
[54:50] and brother branham says this brotherly
[54:52] kindness put yourself in his place on
[54:54] the matter
[54:55] i know that might be hard to kind of get
[54:57] your mind around what a five-year-old's
[54:59] thinking
[55:00] uh but at least you could at least you
[55:02] could look at it from this standpoint
[55:03] i'm looking at it as an adult i'm
[55:05] looking at it as a parent how is he
[55:07] looking at it as a child
[55:09] and therefore how can i approach them in
[55:11] such a way and show grace
[55:14] and again maybe exhibit that patient and
[55:16] say you know what
[55:17] it's apparent to me what the right ideal
[55:20] would be the right response would be in
[55:21] the situation the right way to do this
[55:23] but i'm going to have grace because it
[55:24] wouldn't be equally apparent to a
[55:26] five-year-old
[55:27] why because i'm putting myself in their
[55:29] shoes
[55:30] reminds me of that calvin and hobbes
[55:32] comic at one time where the there's
[55:34] multiple panels where calvin is just
[55:36] nailing uh nails into
[55:39] the end table coffee table and it's just
[55:41] so bam bam bam bam bam and the next
[55:43] frame of his mom running to him and then
[55:46] the the next to last frame it's calvin
[55:49] what in the world are you doing
[55:51] and then there's this kind of like maybe
[55:53] another panel where there's this kind of
[55:54] this little blink above his head like
[55:57] he looks up and says is that a trick
[55:58] question
[56:01] i'm obviously nailing nails into your
[56:03] coffee table
[56:05] and so you think the apparent is like
[56:08] what in the world are you doing and the
[56:09] kid's like painting the wall
[56:12] you know dumping the crisp the grease
[56:15] everywhere i'm repainting the garage you
[56:17] know there's
[56:18] they know exactly what they're doing and
[56:20] so you say what in the world are you
[56:21] doing they're kind of like i thought you
[56:22] were with it mom
[56:24] it's seeing things from their eyes
[56:26] seeing things from their perspective
[56:29] he says brotherly kindness now you see
[56:30] if a brother is all out of tune
[56:33] don't be impatient with him no be kind
[56:35] to him
[56:37] this is how you can exercise bradley
[56:38] kindness is when you try to see
[56:40] something where they're coming from how
[56:41] they see it
[56:43] maybe if you could relate to this
[56:45] but what i it's something i read i think
[56:48] we still do it i still do it rather
[56:50] where i can ask my kids to do something
[56:52] so put this over there and they're like
[56:53] what i like put this over there and
[56:55] they're like
[56:56] what you're like put this over there
[57:00] it's so ambiguous what this is and where
[57:02] there is
[57:03] because i know what this is and i would
[57:05] i know where there is but i've just
[57:07] interrupted them while they're nailing
[57:09] nails into the coffee table so they
[57:11] don't know what this is and where there
[57:12] is but if we just think if we keep
[57:14] repeating ourselves
[57:16] they'll get this
[57:18] and they'll get this and go there and so
[57:20] you need to put yourself in their shoes
[57:21] and if you were just awakened about a
[57:23] daydream
[57:24] a daydream about ponies
[57:26] and to put this over there you say slow
[57:29] down hold on i want you to take this box
[57:33] right here
[57:34] and go put it on the shelf in the pantry
[57:37] and then we maybe have a more educated
[57:39] discussion about which shelf and how
[57:41] high or where and is the box heavy but
[57:43] just this over there in an elevated
[57:45] level of volume probably isn't going to
[57:47] give clarity and that can change if you
[57:49] can hold have a little grace when they
[57:51] don't immediately understand
[57:53] what this is and where there is
[57:55] put yourself in his place on the matter
[57:57] put yourself in your children's shoes
[58:02] is this practical
[58:04] talking about practice again
[58:07] i like it
[58:10] in second peter chapter one now you're
[58:12] thinking i know how to count brother
[58:13] aaron
[58:16] a statue of a perfect man has eight
[58:18] characteristics
[58:19] isn't that right
[58:21] i like that eight bright age
[58:24] and
[58:26] you might be thinking well there's seven
[58:27] there's seven bad habits maybe there
[58:28] should be eight
[58:30] bad habits but this is my sermon so it's
[58:32] structured this way
[58:36] and again there's no word on this this
[58:38] is not a doctrine so i could have used
[58:39] three and a half if i wanted to
[58:42] but in second peter chapter one verse
[58:43] seven and it took godliness add add
[58:46] brotherly kindness and
[58:48] the eighth here and to breadth kindness
[58:50] charity
[58:52] i want you to view this one as let's not
[58:54] have let's not have a counterpart let's
[58:56] not have a correlation let's not have a
[58:58] contrast but let's have this be the cap
[59:01] let it have the capstone let it have no
[59:03] rival
[59:04] let it have no opposite
[59:07] and it says in first corinthians chapter
[59:08] 13 verse 13 and now abideth faith hope
[59:11] charity these three but the greatest of
[59:13] these is charity
[59:15] so there's something about charities the
[59:17] bible says that god is love god is
[59:20] charity it's something akin to god so
[59:22] when we look at this add to brotherly
[59:24] kindness charity we have faith it all
[59:26] begins in faith now it's ending in love
[59:28] there's a way that you can look at that
[59:29] that faith ends in perfect faith and
[59:32] faith is going to end in perfect love
[59:34] there's something that just all melds
[59:35] together and manifest there's certainly
[59:37] a very clear and distinct application
[59:40] dispensationally to the church ages in
[59:42] the open of the word of god and this
[59:44] capstone you find this in christ the
[59:46] mystery
[59:47] as it relates to me as a person
[59:50] wherein as a parent even wanting to add
[59:52] to
[59:53] finally this cap
[59:55] charity
[59:56] is
[59:58] i can say the most outstanding contrast
[1:00:00] to these seven bad habits it's the key
[1:00:04] you can almost say it this way that
[1:00:05] however there and i kind of got lost in
[1:00:06] the font that you used and from that
[1:00:08] point on i never really understood the
[1:00:10] service
[1:00:11] um i didn't get the correlation it
[1:00:13] didn't make sense to me um i think
[1:00:15] there's still people who ask me what
[1:00:17] invert always invert means
[1:00:19] uh and so there may be a way that those
[1:00:21] things just didn't click but i could say
[1:00:23] this this is the key that if you have
[1:00:24] love
[1:00:26] that's the key that's going to unlock
[1:00:29] i really want to emphasize this it's
[1:00:30] that love that unlocks so much and how
[1:00:33] that we deal with our children how we
[1:00:35] deal with one another it says in
[1:00:36] galatians chapter 5 verse 6 for in
[1:00:38] christ jesus christ neither circumcision
[1:00:40] availeth anything nor uncircumcision but
[1:00:43] faith which worketh by love
[1:00:46] our faith works by love we say oh i have
[1:00:49] faith i have faith but if faith is going
[1:00:51] to work it works effectively
[1:00:53] by love so this faith that we have even
[1:00:56] at the beginning and all these virtues
[1:00:57] we add there's something about this
[1:00:59] charity and this capstone that is
[1:01:01] radiating down through through us and
[1:01:04] it's causing our faith to work and our
[1:01:05] faith works by love
[1:01:08] this is how brother branham says that
[1:01:10] charity which is love that's the capping
[1:01:12] stone
[1:01:13] is the language he uses in the statute
[1:01:14] of a perfect man the headstone which is
[1:01:16] love for god is love now catch this
[1:01:19] statement and he controls
[1:01:21] and he is the strength
[1:01:23] of every one of these things
[1:01:27] look let's look at it not from this
[1:01:28] standpoint of well i got faith and if i
[1:01:31] could just figure out faith one day i
[1:01:32] can get virtue no think of this you're a
[1:01:34] son of god all these ver all these
[1:01:36] characteristics are in you
[1:01:39] and he controls
[1:01:41] and he's the strength of every one of
[1:01:43] these
[1:01:45] that that's that's my that's my comfort
[1:01:48] as a believer
[1:01:49] as a holy spirit-filled son of god my my
[1:01:52] comforter
[1:01:54] abides with me
[1:01:55] and and that's my that's my strength
[1:01:58] and then in this same sense now
[1:02:00] of using these characteristics to kind
[1:02:03] of bring a contrast to parental habits
[1:02:08] parental love is this is the strength
[1:02:11] that promotes the good habits
[1:02:14] if we were to say that emphasizing
[1:02:16] spiritual things consistently
[1:02:17] instructing and correcting properly
[1:02:19] judging
[1:02:20] using my voice
[1:02:22] appropriately disciplining the right way
[1:02:24] being a good example
[1:02:26] showing grace that it's parental love
[1:02:30] that promotes the good and changes the
[1:02:32] bad why will i do these things because i
[1:02:34] love my children
[1:02:37] why will i well why will i treat you
[1:02:38] with respect because i love you
[1:02:42] at the end of the day i would even say
[1:02:43] that at the very least we ought to treat
[1:02:46] everyone the right way because we fear
[1:02:48] god amen
[1:02:50] there's um i don't think i'm sharing too
[1:02:52] much here there's times when i thought
[1:02:54] man i should do that
[1:02:56] and it's not because i care about the
[1:02:58] person that i choose not to
[1:03:00] it's the fear of god that causes me not
[1:03:02] to act
[1:03:03] i think wait a minute i fear god too
[1:03:06] much
[1:03:06] than to misbehave i fear god too much to
[1:03:09] do something that's not right and so
[1:03:10] it's that love and that reverence even
[1:03:12] for god and it's love that we have for
[1:03:14] one another that'll restrain us and even
[1:03:17] motivate us restrain the negative
[1:03:19] conduct but then promote the right kind
[1:03:21] of conduct
[1:03:22] and if it's god that controls it's the
[1:03:24] love of god god is love he controls and
[1:03:26] is the strength of every one of these
[1:03:28] characteristics
[1:03:30] of all these things that we've expressed
[1:03:31] to you of this faith and virtue
[1:03:33] knowledge temperance patience godliness
[1:03:35] brother christ he is the strength of
[1:03:36] every one of these and it says in
[1:03:39] philippians 2 13 for it is god which
[1:03:41] worketh in you both to will and to do of
[1:03:45] his good pleasure
[1:03:47] this is what i could say to parents
[1:03:48] tonight who are filled with the holy
[1:03:50] ghost who want to honor the lord who are
[1:03:52] already making the sacrifice to have
[1:03:53] their children in church on a wednesday
[1:03:55] night it's 8 it's 8 30 on a wednesday
[1:03:57] night whatever time it's going to get
[1:03:58] the kids up in the morning is going to
[1:04:00] come quick it's going to come early but
[1:04:02] here you are what causes you to do that
[1:04:04] it's god that works in you both to will
[1:04:06] and to do of his good pleasure
[1:04:10] and i'll say this to the parents tonight
[1:04:11] and if you and those who are no longer
[1:04:13] raising children again this applies to
[1:04:15] any relationship that we could have
[1:04:17] you're willing to do it because you love
[1:04:20] and you're able to do it because you
[1:04:22] have faith
[1:04:24] it's god in you both to will and to do
[1:04:26] of his good pleasure we're willing say
[1:04:27] you could say i'm willing brother and
[1:04:29] i'm willing to do the right thing
[1:04:31] i'm willing i'm willing to begin to
[1:04:33] say and do these things be more
[1:04:35] effective in parenting or even address
[1:04:37] these seven bad habits i'm willing to do
[1:04:40] it because i love my children i love my
[1:04:42] wife i i love other people i want to do
[1:04:44] the right thing i'm willing because i
[1:04:46] love and i'll say you're able also
[1:04:49] because you have faith
[1:04:51] it's in you both to will and to do
[1:04:53] of his good pleasure
[1:04:56] let's pray our gracious heavenly father
[1:04:59] lord tonight as we have examined these
[1:05:02] things
[1:05:04] i know that it's
[1:05:06] it's a dryness maybe i'm not sure just
[1:05:09] exactly how to express it
[1:05:11] but you know better than i just what
[1:05:13] dynamic pull there was on these things
[1:05:16] just how easily i could have committed
[1:05:18] myself to expounding on any one of these
[1:05:20] into great detail
[1:05:22] because lord it was real
[1:05:24] it's applicable
[1:05:28] there's things that were expressed
[1:05:29] tonight that
[1:05:30] one person may be able to take and so
[1:05:34] precisely apply it to their life it is
[1:05:36] the exact key to unlock a situation that
[1:05:39] seemed close to them
[1:05:41] so i pray tonight lord that you would
[1:05:42] have a grace upon the people that have
[1:05:43] been faithful
[1:05:45] been have been attentive and listening
[1:05:47] lord they've been very focused may you
[1:05:48] have a grace on them
[1:05:51] and and
[1:05:52] strengthen them and encourage them lord
[1:05:55] as we're soon dismissed lord may these
[1:05:57] things not soon leave our thoughts but
[1:05:59] may we meditate upon them
[1:06:01] consider them
[1:06:02] their relevance lord
[1:06:04] i think of some of the
[1:06:06] those amongst us who have adult children
[1:06:08] they've already raised their children
[1:06:10] and
[1:06:10] they find themselves in a different
[1:06:12] stage of life
[1:06:14] lord i would that they would have a
[1:06:16] liberty to impart wisdom and to
[1:06:18] be good examples to those of us who are
[1:06:20] following in the footsteps and
[1:06:22] just to promote lord give me wisdom as a
[1:06:24] pastor to now as i feel in my heart
[1:06:26] we're entering into just another growth
[1:06:29] stage as a church just to be able to
[1:06:31] promote
[1:06:32] more of a family atmosphere among one
[1:06:35] another
[1:06:36] finding ways to help one another spend
[1:06:38] more time together
[1:06:40] lord i believe that these this approach
[1:06:42] these principles
[1:06:43] will be helpful to us in that lord if
[1:06:46] there be anyone here tonight that needs
[1:06:48] a touch from you that needs
[1:06:50] that really wants to reach out and grab
[1:06:52] a hold of this word that was preached
[1:06:54] tonight and say oh god help me may you
[1:06:56] hear their cry may you respond to their
[1:06:58] need
[1:06:59] may you have mercy on them oh god
