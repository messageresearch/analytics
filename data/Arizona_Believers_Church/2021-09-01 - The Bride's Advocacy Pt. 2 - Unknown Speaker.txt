TRANSCRIPT
========================================
revelations chapter 22 verse 17 and the spirit and the bride say come and let him that heareth say come let him that has a thirst come and whosoever will let him take the water of life freely very short verse so we'll read it again and the spirit and the bride say come so they're saying it together this is something that is not only the spirit is speaking but the bride is speaking also and let him that heareth and heareth what the spirit is speaking and what the bride is speaking let him say come let him that is a thirst come and whosoever will let him take the water of life freely god bless you you could take your seats i'm just going to jump right into it this mo this evening i'm continuing on the subject that we are ministering on sunday on the bride's advocacy we are looking specifically at our individual advocacy as members of the body of christ and we read a lengthy statement from the church age book where brother branham is talking about once again there is a people in the land who under their messenger will be the final voice to the final age and kind of the what we were tracking in brother branham's thought is how that in each age there were those who god used to speak on his behalf he used these messengers and that they spoke on god's behalf but then there's a point where they denominate and they take their own ideas and they base their their beliefs on the word of god it's not the word of god but it's beliefs that are based on the word of god and because they've moved away from the word as their true center their true north is their absolute then god can no longer use them as a mouthpiece because they only become advocates for what they believe for their church and adding members to their organization or those that will accept their interpretation of the scripture and so as that was the the that was the context for brother branham saying once again there'll be there's a people in the land who under their messenger are the final voice to the final age so we could say the bride or we could even say it using the scriptural terminology of the body of christ the body of christ is the final voice to the final age now if you're members of that then you have a voice you have a part in that you are you can't have everyone as members of the body of christ not having a voice but then the body have a voice there has to be an individual responsibility or manifestation of that voice within the body and really as i've pondered this it's really helped me to understand more vividly and much more richly maybe even a way that uh finally beginning to understand what it means to be the final voice because we say well the final voice is maybe just parodying what a prophet said or just repeating what a prophet said and we realized that really wouldn't tell the whole story that really wouldn't exhaust the ministry or exhaust what god means by the final voice and so we're looking at this and it's become very inspired to me that we are the final voice and just as brother branham said the church is no longer god's mouthpiece it says they are their own mouthpiece that means they speak for their own ideas their own uh desires their own ambitions their own goals i could say that we are god's mouthpiece the church is no longer god's mouthpiece but we are god's mouthpiece and therefore we have a responsibility to speak on behalf of the word because that's what a mouthpiece is they speak on behalf of someone else and so if the church is no longer god's mouthpiece then we have a responsibility to speak on behalf of the word and let me say this not only on behalf of the word but as the word we must be speaking and in mark chapter 16 verse 15 jesus said go ye and told the world and preach the gospel to every creature i believe we ought to ponder this phrase preach the gospel we know that not all of us will have pulpit ministries as a matter of fact the large majority almost all of us will not have a pulpit ministry but yet we could say that we are under this great commission to preach the gospel to every creature so we ought to ponder what it means to preach the gospel and ask ourselves how can i preach the gospel without necessarily sitting down taking a text and explaining something in the scripture or or taking quotes and different things and trying to share doctrine or share theology i can preach the gospel and then also in pondering that ask ourselves really begin to understand in a greater way the importance of preaching the gospel i had the scripture in my notes and i removed many things from my notes tonight but jesus said the gospel must be preached into all the world and then the end will come so really if we wanted to identify a very strict scriptural component of the end and the translation the change of our bodies and the meeting of the lord in the air this gospel has to be preached into all the world it has to go into all the world it has to be preached and then the end can come this change can come and so with the great commission as we take this scripture and we take derive this phrase from it this is the great commission and even the scriptures following a commission means there's been some authority entrusted to someone else so you may have you have might have an authority and if you commission somebody you convey that authority to somebody else or you entrust that authority to someone else so we have been commissioned there's been a delegated authority there's been a delegated power to you as a believer and we must fulfill this great commission are you with me so far i know i'm going a little fast but i'm excited tonight so i want to give the review again on advocacy we spoke on the bride's advocate now we've transitioned to the bride's advocacy and advocacy is the act of pleading for supporting or recommending something what's important to the act so it's active support to advocate for something means to argue for it to recommend it or to support it and we looked at how that advocacy is that combination of ad which is two and then vocacy vocacy however you want to say it vacancy is is to voice to say something so it's advocacy is to voice so it has something to do with the voice when the bible when we're taught that we're the final voice to the final age we're the final advocates for the truth we're the final advocates for we're the final way the final opportunity to hear truth and to be saved and so in the latin the word advocate comes from stems from advocare which means to call or to summon or to invite and we arrived at that sunday morning to identify that our advocacy isn't in the explanation of something or isn't in the in the defense or the apologetics of the message but it is actually enlarged in large part inviting people to come and to know christ to advocate is to invite to summon to call to someone so we identified in the scripture even here in revelations chapter 22 that our advocacy has come what are we inviting someone to come we're asking someone to come uh to this route and offspring of david this bright and morning star we're saying come to christ come to this fountain come inexhaustible supply of joy and life and rest and peace ministry of jesus christ the disciples said come and see it wasn't just in the explanation of it in the identifying the scriptures of it but ultimately no matter how much you could describe it know how much you how much you could explain it no matter how much you could tell somebody what it entails ultimately you want someone to come and experience it themselves we've all been somewhere and done something and experienced something where we tried to explain it and ultimately said you just got to see it for yourself you just need to partake of it yourself and that ultimately ought to be what we desire for every single person that we witness to is not so much accept what i'm saying to be truth but experience what i've experienced for yourself and that's what advocacy is we advocate we say come come and see on behalf of christ not our own interest we don't advocate so that we can say oh look i invited some of the church and we get a bible we get a star next to our name or are there something that we gain and benefit from it ourselves but we do it for the cause of christ advocacy is defined as public support for or recommendation of a particular cause or policy this would be more of a book definition of it public support for a policy public recommendation of a particular cause notice that it's public you cannot be an advocate and be silent you cannot be hidden you cannot be secret and be a supporter be an advocate advocacy requires active support advocate advocacy requires public support and so we realize that we have a deeply personal and intimate relationship with christ and that relationship is private that relationship is in secret and the things that he shares with us i was looking this week into the scripture how that jesus used this method of parables to the world but spoke plainly to the disciples and the parables themselves are meant to convey revelation but as the truth would be accepted or the parable would uh could dawn upon someone's heart christ then explained the parable to the disciples and that i recognize that is myself as the element of revelation there can be something public but then christ wants to reveal the meaning to that of that to you personally and privately so we have this private meeting this secret place and we're met with christ in that secret place and we commune with christ in that secret place and it's not a public show but the what begins to take place in that secret place and what transpires in our hearts there's an accounting of it there's an expression of it there's a testimony after afterwards when we're given an account in some way to express and to advocate for what took place in that secret place and so with this relationship with christ comes the responsibility to advocate publicly for christ this is a responsibility to advocate publicly for christ and i realize that the language i'm using may be it may not be familiar to us in the message the terminologies that i'm using but let's not maybe the semantics may be different but i hope you catch the real thought of what i'm trying to impress upon you that the final voice to the final age is something that's very precious and something very important and there is a public ministry that we share in as the bride of jesus christ now we'll step forward in this subject and look at first corinthians chapter 14 verse 10. this scripture has a very important meaning and very particular meaning within the context of paul dealing with the gifts and the speaking in tongues and the interpretation thereof and he's acknowledging that if a barbarian or just a stranger would walk into a service and everyone was kind of speaking in different tongues it wouldn't convey anything to the here that would benefit them said actually to the world you would kind of seem to be crazy he said so i'd rather speak things plainly and clearly to the edifying of the body than to speak in a bunch of tongues and and i don't mean that in the slight but to speak in tongues and speak in an unknown language so it's kind of the context of what he's speaking about in terms of languages and the tongues and being interpreted but he says there are it may be so many kinds of voices in the world and none of them is without signification and this voice is it's um articulated speech it has to do with tongues or languages there are so many different languages in the world and none of them are without signification in that every language and in every language every word has a meaning and and that word has an idea attached to it so there's many different languages many different tongues many different ways of expressing thoughts and feelings and ideals in the world and all these languages have this distinct meaning they have a significance to its use and we understand that language and i'm just going to look at this very quickly move on from it maybe visit it again in the future language is expressive of culture is expressive of beliefs as a matter of fact i thought about it today that uh it was at one time i believe if you spoke english they probably would just assume you were a christian because of the uh the crusades of the of the christian church and the uh and the spread of the gospel through the united kingdom and even in america and there would be this assumption that if you spoke english you were probably a christian or to the greater uh the chances were that you were a christian so even language can be associated with beliefs and convictions in ideology and religion and that's what language would express it's connected with those things and as i've thought upon it there's certain words or phrases and a language that could be used that identify specific groups even to where with when it comes to um computer science and software engineering and programming and coding that there's languages that are used and to use a terminology and phrases and even sometimes cliches or or slang that's related to that industry anybody outside of it would have no no idea what you're talking about no clue whatsoever is being meant uh by that phrase but to someone who's in that group in that in that discipline it would have very distinct meaning to them and that's what paul is even referring to there's so many kinds of voices in the world and none of them are without signification so your voice has significance your voice ought to be clear not to have meaning not to be conveying something not that everyone would begin to uh agree with you let alone understand you there has to be there should be some meaning and thought behind what is being said and we can say that today there are so many voices and those voices have meaning they have intent they have a purpose behind them that there's so many voices in the world today that can cloud our thinking so many ideas and things that can just be dropped in they get dropped into our spirit and so it could kind of cloud our thinking we have to fight through all these different voices to really hear the voice of god or to anchor into what would be a rational thought or the wisdom of the scripture and these not only cloud our thinking but it influences our thinking and remember that we are as believers and i think it was sister judy dilling that expressed it this way after the service sunday morning that we are spiritual amphitheaters that the word is spoken to our hearts it resonates within our hearts and then we ought to sound out the word the word by revelation is imparted into our souls and it sounds out from our beings and from our our members comes this expression the echoing of the word of god we ought to be that we're going to be the final voice to the final legs the word spoken to our souls and then it's going to be reverberated out through our lives now brother bennett makes this statement in voice of god in the last days and i was curious i don't know if maybe would know brother ernie if you would know but brother branham at the beginning of this message refers to brother garcia and it was at a spanish church apostolic church or apostolic tabernacle in in phoenix is that the the believers the garcias so praise the lord it's wonderful i was just reading that today and there's several maybe 11 different services that brother man preaches at the beginning there of 63 all of them right here in arizona phoenix most of them in phoenix and also tucson and mesa and this is notice the the emphasis here and today one reason that the church is in the condition that it's in is because there's so many voices the the condition of the church and we could begin to just use our our mind of what brother random identified as the condition of the church he even says in one place they're just dead so many other voices to attract the church from the voice of god so voices have an attraction they have a a distracting power they have an attracting power they're going to point to they're going to emphasize so that's what advocacy is they say come and see kind of like a uh somebody who's you know we realize that maybe happens to us or we did it one time i don't know if they still exist i don't go to malls very often but you'd see some head and they'd have a clipboard and they're going to want to sell you something or somebody's in a kiosk and when you see that they're kind of praying what do they want to do get your attention you want to try this lotion you want to try this you want to try that so you get on the phone and you pretend you're on a phone call and because they're going to try to get you they're going to try to snare you kind of trap you and bring you in and so these voices are trying to draw you and get your attention and and sell you something he says until it's very doubtful so many voices attract the attention of the church from the voice of god so it's very doubtful that many would hear the voice of god though it spoke right in the midst this is how strong these contrary voices are that it would be such a competition to the voice of god that we'd be more tuned into all these other voices and miss the voice of god they perhaps wouldn't even understand it because it would be a foreign thing to them they have got themselves so much centered on the voices of the day tuned into centered kind of listening to the prevailing voices of the day the dominant voices of the day through social media through the news through entertainment through society through all the different channels we kind of tune into the voices of the day and god is speaking over here but we're so centered on these other voices that this loses its distinction paragraph 28 he says there is so many other voices and if god promised he would give us that give us the voice of god give us the voice of truth and if other voices are contrary to the voice of god then it must be the voice of our enemy to confuse us that we would not understand the voice of god when it spoke this is extremely informative to us we could anchor on this and just take this as a real true principle into our hearts is that there's a voice of god today wanting to speak to us there's a voice of the word wanting to speak to our soul and there's many voices that are trying to distract you from it remember the believer is attracted to the word and distracted to by the world so we look at that distinction you at your core at your root you're attracted to the word you're not attracted to the world you're distracted by the world so if the world seems to have some pull on you it's a distraction because your true attraction the main attraction your life is the word so he's saying this there there might it must be a voice of the enemy to confuse us there's voices trying to confuse you get you riled up get you stirred up get you anxious and upset and and riled up to do something and sign a petition and get behind this and get behind that and it'll take you away from the voice of god paragraph 31 there's so many voices in the earth today that it is absolutely a hard thing because it deadens the voice of the supernatural this is the impact of so many voices and the time we're living in now there is or thousands and thousands tens of thousands hundreds of thousands of miles for us to be influenced by voices if you want to look at it through um the you know a plethora of uh musicians and and bands and music or look at it in the tens of thousands of podcasts that are available or youtube channels or instagram influencers and all these other ways that we can be hear these voices that are conveying something images convey a voice movies convey a voice and advertisements and radio personalities and political parties and the news all these different things can we just kind of let our minds broaden a little bit to think about all these different channels of voices that exist in the world today and that what happens is it deadens the voice of the supernatural there are so many intellectual voices great voices of mighty men who are intellectual that in their intellectual conditions even shake the nations they just not overnight people they're just not overnight people but they shake nations bring great organizations together great campaigns flowery and there's no doubt a very um a direct messaging there and he's identifying certain things but really these kind of dynamics exist today in the world today and a person would be a bit confused it's enough to confuse them of how that these things go on and prosper movements that prosper works that seem to be very successful and plentiful and uh uh very flowery very demonstrative he said these things may seem very confusing because they have a voice and they have a success that follows it he says and there's voices that raise up and do these things and it causes the voice of god to be placed way back somewhere the true voice of god so all these things kind of take the forefront they dominate they get the attention they get the news they get the light the squeaky wheel gets the grease as they say and so everyone's attention is drawn to those that are the loudest and those that are complaining and those that are advocating for certain things and and these issues get the forefront and they get our attention and then we're we're compelled as it were to take a side and these things cause the voice of god to be placed way back somewhere the true voice of god to lose its preeminence in our lives but jesus says in john chapter 10 verses 3 to 5 to him speaking of the shepherd to him the porter openeth and he is the shepherd and so this speaks of the shepherd and the sheep hear his voice not the porter but the shepherd's voice they sheep hear his voice and he calleth his own sheep by name and leadeth them out so there's the voice of the shepherd that's going to identify call you and then the lead you out and there's going to be competing voices of the enemy to confuse you on the voice of the shepherd to confuse you to deaden to dull to cause it to go away back in the background to where there's so many voices speaking so many voices speaking and you're not in tune to it to where it dens it and it's drowned out by the noise they ever noticed how apparent many times could be in a situation where a lot of people are screaming or shouting a lot of commotion and chaos is going on but then just the cry of their child gets their attention how did you notice hey there's just something about that sound and there's things that you can be tuned into and a lot of things can be loud and chaotic and a lot of noise but you recognize a voice and you're real tuned into its cadence and it's it's tenor and it's sound and so you immediately click oh i know that voice so and so is in the service today by the way that they're singing or so and so said this i know exactly who that is and you know it by repetition you know by familiarity it has a sound to it it's distinct and you can't be fooled on it and this is what the world wants to do is to cause you maybe can't make them be quiet the voices aren't going to stop speaking but you can become so tuned into the voice of god that no matter how much they amplify their volume and their rhetoric and how loud it gets you're still tuned to the voice of god and he can lead you out verse 4 and when he putteth forth his own sheep he goeth before them and the sheep follow him what is what is that is the characteristic that christ identifies that causes the sheep to follow for they know his voice you follow by the voice that's what they're tuned into that's what they're following it's a it's a it's a guidance it's the leadership by the voice and a stranger will they not follow so they follow the shepherd by virtue of his voice not just the figure moving in a particular direction but it must be the voice and knowing the voice tuned into the voice they then follow that leadership and a stranger will they not follow but they will flee from him but again what is the characteristic of the sheep that caused them to follow christ and to not follow a stranger to do only what christ says to do and to flee from a stranger for they know not the voice of strangers think about that this essential characteristic of sheep is can follow the true shepherd because they know his voice but if there's a strange voice that begins to try to lead they flee from it because they recognize that does not harmonize with the voice of christ so i would ask what voices are we hearing and in hearing voices do we recognize a stranger's voice and and our and what voice then that we're listening to are we echoing is what are we sounding out what voices are we listening to and being tuned into those voices confused by voices detracted by voices uh all these different ways that brother madam talks about these voices if we somehow get these rattling around in our mind do does do we become an echo of those voices or are we tuned into the voice of the shepherd and sounding out the voice of christ i know this will get all of y'all's attention today but how many have seen and not just yet there on this one brother john i'll cue it up in here a moment have driven around and seen the we believe signs in people's yards anybody see them okay are just a few well maybe we all need to go to san diego but there's these we believe signs that are people are popping up in all sorts front yards you know in front of businesses in different places and it's these it says in this house we believe or we believe and they give a list of things that they believe and it's to show public support for a certain ethos a certain way of thinking a certain ideology a certain belief in certain lifestyles as i say we believe and then they kind of give this position statement of the things that they believe and having this in someone's front yard they're wanting to convey that those of us in this house stand for these principles and they might just be these one-liners but it conveys something and so this is one of the signs i think that's the most prevalent if you want to pull that one up there and it says in this house we believe black lives matter women's rights are human rights no human is illegal science is real love is kindness is everything is anybody do you remember seeing these now that we've shown you the graphic or you see maybe the bumper stickers um and you've seen it now as you look at this and don't get nervous or maybe you should i don't know maybe i don't want to sucker punch you but just open up your heart to receive from the lord we we we look at these ideals and immediately immediately we catch we get the point that there's political messaging that's taking place here as we read these things we recognize that there's a meaning to each one that these things have been there's there's ascribed meaning and ideology and motives and objectives and movements behind these things to our you know five years ago or 20 however long it would have been 10 years ago if we said if someone asked us does an african-american life matter oh yeah of course it does but this phrase takes on different meaning it takes on different weight and and uh and we as you continue women's rights are human rights and some of the signs maybe say feminism is for everyone and we realize that this is this is conveying a movement an ideology a thought process uh no human is illegal we recognize that what this is this is an opinion on immigration science is real this probably would be the most recent addition to it i don't know maybe it was a climate change platform it might need more now but love is love kindness is everything and when we look at this what have we all done we recognize these as liberal mantras right right that these things echo a liberal sentiment liberal political messaging or social messaging and these different things and some of you are not going to ask you to raise your hands or shout too loud uh some of these phrases might actually offend some of us nobody wanted to [Music] got that right brother aaron it'll offend us why it's not the phrase in itself it's everything that we associate with it and so this would be this would be a we believe sign in someone's front yard but there's also another sign out there and it is the next one we believe and i couldn't find any anybody's yard to take a picture of this in so it says we believe god created man and woman now what now notice the notice what's being said here man and woman love is sacrificial god created science not a few or some but all lives matter and unborn life is still a life helping the immigrant judging character not skin color respecting the law and the flag so this is this is another set of we believes but i want to ask you do you recognize the political message messaging in this just as much as you did the other yeah like we might read this read through this and record well yeah we know god created a man and a woman and we know that love is sacrificial and and god created science and after all scientists are just breaking into god's laboratory and we believe that life is precious and an unborn life is still alive and helping them judging character not skin color respecting the law and the flag maybe we lose a little bit of the christianity there and the flag but there's something that's being messaged here where we ought to be able to recognize these also are associated with conservative ideals and that there's republican or conservative political messaging that's taking place and really this yard sign is a rebuttal to the other one it's almost as if somebody walked out and was like honey did you see that got in their yard over there you're good on etsy find me one that can counter point that and they actually went out and had a rebuttal there's a point for point rebuttal in this yard sign versus the other so one one identifies one particular thought process platform and the other one represents the other platform and as we read this one we believe in god and god created science and unborn life is still alive and we realize that that would be the issue of abortion and and judging character not skin color might relate to affirmative action and respecting the law and then and the flag like you shouldn't kneel when the national anthem is played and all these different things they have this messaging this conservative ideology and some of them we may look at and say they appear and i'm using my language very carefully they appear to be based on the word right so it might very quickly kind of get our attention and then we feel like well if i had to take a side as a christian i would have to put this yard sign in my yard all right i'm like if you were forced you have to pick a sign you have to pick a sign you would maybe pick that sign but really we need to be very careful because there are a lot of things that appear to be based on the word but they do it in order to disguise strange voices to disguise strange voices as a familiar voice there is a there was a deliberate attempt there is a and continues to be a very deliberate attempt in politics to phrase things in such a way that it kind of scratches your your evangelical itch and to get your rancor up as a christian in order to motivate you and inspire you to advocate for political causes and platforms and then we think oh my this is i'm as a christian this is a challenge to my faith this is an affront to god it's like slow down a minute take a deep breath if we got that if we could just be i'm starting to get riled up my righteous indignation to think about we can get so riled up i'm really starting to lose it now and advocate for things because we feel that our faith is being challenged and that god is being affronted and we never we we would never do that about other things we've nev we haven't done that about other other things that are much more clear in the scripture much more precious to the heart of jesus christ and that's when you ought to take a step back and realize that there's voices that are strange voices that try to sound like the voice of the shepherd but in fact they're not this is my inspiration and the bride's advocacy i trust you're just really listening some of you might be thinking well at least you made it a year brother aaron took took you a year and you just dropped the bomb and but i would say when we begin arizona believers church the the the acronym abc i see some of these things are abc things and we never really studied that enough to really do the algebra but we try to talk algebra we tried to talk real spiritual and real deep and the truth is we were just putting our ankles in the kiddie pool this is where we begin to wade into deep waters when we come back to the foundation of christ the principles that the word advocates for it says in second corinthians chapter 11 verses 13 to 15. notice this for such are false apostles deceitful workers transforming themselves into the apostles of christ they're going to speak on behalf of christ they're going to say that they're championing the things of christ and the things of god he says in no marvel for satan himself is transformed into an angel of light so there are those false apostles and deceitful workers that are going to use a language that seems to be akin to the language and principles of christ but they're doing it to deceive you strange voices meant to confuse and attract you away from the voice of god and cause them to deaden the voice of the supernatural to cause confusion and paul continues therefore it is no great thing that if satan is transformed into an angel of life if his ministers also be transformed as ministers of righteousness advocate witnesses proponents of the protagonist of righteousness and they appear to be advocating for in soliciting uh um righteous causes and eliciting your response and asking you to support it and getting you to sign up behind it and to really uh become a voice for it and throw your weight behind it but they can be angels transformed as ministers of righteousness as satan trans himself transforms himself into an angel of light i'd say that's an intriguing picture that's being painted i trust that you're staying with me tonight walking through this so this is my challenge i'd love to spend a lot more just on that we may do so in the future services just take those points we've just made right there and continue to amplify them with scripture and quotation over and over and over again because this subject runs very very there's a lot of quantity to this and a lot of depth to it in the word of god but my challenge is to first to ask ourselves what are we advocating for if we're the final voice to the final age what are we giving voice to what are we sounding out if we're amphitheaters what are we saying is it a carnal amphitheater are we sounding out merely carnal things or is there a spiritual amplification of the truth of the word it says in john 10 27 my sheep hear my voice and i know them and they follow me we are only sheep to christ right if we're going to be accused of being sheep the only shepherd that we are sheep to is christ it is his voice word that is our compass it is his voice word that is our guide and it's only in following the shepherd my sheep hear my voice and i know them and they follow me that's the only way that the gospel can truly be preached you cannot be on your own it cannot be your own inspiration it cannot be your own ambition it cannot be your own goals the great commission will only be fulfilled in heeding the voice of christ in following him that's how the great commission is fulfilled so he says my sheep hear my voice and i'm going to make a quick change here now this is my this is my link up my sheep hear my voice and they follow me now i want to allude to the fact that christ had a very public ministry had a and there was things he wasn't doing things in the corners we read before these things were done open not in secret not done in a corner so in a very public ministry and he's telling the disciples follow me and paul says in first corinthians chapter 11 verse 1 be ye followers of me even as i also am of christ so paul is saying that he was following christ and in following christ he set such an example that you could also follow him the that he was so faithful to the cause of christ and so faithful to christ in christ uh christ the revelation of christ and the theology and doctrine of christ that paul can say i faithfully followed christ so that if you follow my example you will also follow christ and i'm realizing now that i had i cut out first corinthians chapter 10 and i was wanting to read several verses at the end of first corinthians chapter 10 because there's things that he's making statements he's making at the end of that chapter which he then concludes with uh be you followers of me as i also am of christ and maybe i'll just i'll just read one verse very quickly so that you can understand where i'm coming from in this as he says in verse first corinthians chapter 10 verse 33 and i took all these took a page of notes out tonight so that we would uh we wouldn't be here more than a couple hours it says even as i please all men in all things not seeking my own prophet but the prophet of many that they may be saved wow be you followers of me all even also as i am of christ i notice that connection there he's expressing his his conviction the way his abiding principle in his life and he says that be followers of me even also as i am of christ now that what he's tracking here in first corinthians chapter 10 verses 23 to 33 to all to the glory of god and he's saying follow me as i follow christ he is following in the example of christ by doing this and he touches on it also in chapter 9. and i have these verses available for you on the slide verse 19 to 23 first corinthians chapter 9 verses 19 to 23 for though i be free from all men yet have i made myself servant unto all that i might gain the more ponder this very deeply paul is able to acknowledge that he is a servant to all but yet still a prisoner to christ a servant of christ that i may gain the more this is his it's very important to catch all the words that he's referring to here i may i become a servant to all with this purpose that i might gain the more and under the jews i became as a jew then i might gain the jews to them that are under the law as under the law then i might gain them that are under the law notice what he's saying then when he says that i might gain he said that i might we could previously that i might win them to christ to a jew i become a jew so that they can be one to christ to those that are under the law i also invite you act as though i am under the law but not that i just fit in i'm not a confrontationalist i don't like arguing he's saying that i might gain them win them to christ those that are under the law to them that are without law i also act as without law notice this tremendous parenthetical phrase here to help us understand what he means being not without law of god but under the law to christ he still could do these things catch this because this is my whole point this evening and it's very easy to unload it at this point paul is saying that i can be something to the jews i can be something to those under the law to those that are without the law but still remain under the law of christ that i might gain them that are without law to the weak become i as weak that i might gain the weak i am made all things to all men that i might by all means save some notice how tremendous this is i believe this is paul reflecting how he thought he's that reflecting how they he followed the example of christ he is emulating and walking in the steps of the shepherd my sheep know my voice and another they will not follow paul is following the voice of jesus christ in living and acting this way he's not deviating from the principles of christ he's actually following in the principles of christ to have this kind of thought process being very very careful verse 23 in this i do for the gospel sake that i might be partaker thereof with you so the reason why he was doing it was not to gain followers not to build a church not to have a name for himself not get get up a bunch of offerings or get a lot of followers on instagram or have have a lot of youtube subscribers have a big congregation he said i do all these things not to just be a chameleon and wishy-washy and not have a platform so that everyone just thinks i'm fine and when in rome do as the romans kind of theology said i do this for the gospel's sake are you following what paul is saying i am made all things to all men that i might by all means save some i have assumed every shape and form yet in doing so i've maintained faithless to the word of god and the nature of christ i've assumed different forms in certain settings and certain stations and i've taken on different shapes and had different conversations and attitudes and obey did certain things in the presence of certain people but all while doing it i remain faithful to the word of god and i've remained in the nature of christ one translation says i've given up my own will my own way my own comfort my own pleasure and my own prophet that i might save the souls of all knowledge paul was adapting wasn't very rigid and unbending and legalistic he was accommodating but this adapting and accommodation and this is my caution to you to adapt and to accommodate requires the goal he pursued can't leave from here so well i'm just going to accommodate and i'm just going to acquiesce and i'm going to adapt and i'm just going to fit in in every situation if you do it without the goal he had then it will not be a combination it'll be compromised because without compromise he accommodated he adapted because of the cut the goal he pursued and that was the salvation of the lost so he could not modify his position he could not change his state he couldn't be as without the law and or be as under the law or be as a jew or be as weak and then muddy and confuse the gospel of christ and then win them to it wait we can't go get we can't go get high and witness to everybody like hey man i'm just talking with you just because i want you to know about the love of jesus and the one the first thing you try to do is rip the bong out of their hand and smash it and say you shouldn't be getting high like man only found out about this when we were smoking and like now you're gonna try to take it away from me like well yeah i just did that and i might win you there's a there's a contradiction there there's there's a conflict in messaging there's something that's not lining up and so this is this is paul's uh unction it was not to get money it was not to gain influence it was not even to save his own life but to save the life of others and in doing so it really increased his labor it increased his discomfort he was not acting to make his life easier to avoid discomfort he's actually increasing his labor and making his life more uncomfortable but why was he doing it that he his gospel could be effective he says for the gospel sake in order to success to the utmost of his ability the for the gospel's sake i'm going to act a certain way for the gospel sake i'm going to do certain things for the gospel sake with that always in view and that before me that the gospel might be effective upon the sinner that the sick might be impacted by the word of god that the loss might be impacted by the word of god i'm going to find myself motivated by that in harmony with the character of christ that others might be impacted by this word that i've received and notice how he says that the gain of even some is worth the expenditure of all means he doesn't say that as we read it that i am made all things to all men that i might by all means save all people he just made by every effort by every means possible the expenditure and expense of all things and all means was worth it just to gain some wasn't made worth it if it was all but just some and he conformed himself to the feelings of others to he conformed himself to even the thoughts and convictions of different classes in order just to win some he knew he couldn't win them all but he wanted to win some i was going to i was going to go to first corinthians chapter 10 and it go through that but i i'm going to hold i want to pick up on this thought right where we are now sunday morning and so the all of you who are here that will be back sunday morning you know you could kind of look at everybody else like are you getting this because i just want to pick right up in this i want to read this from the living bible the verses i just read verses 19 to 23 from the living bible i don't have a slide for i don't think i have any more slides because i wanted you just to focus on these things the remainder of the service listen can you listen just for a few more moments it's 8 17 i walked up here at 8 25 it hasn't been an hour believers live for the after hour we're not even there yet he says when i am with the jews i see him as one of them so that they will listen to the gospel and i can win them to christ when i'm with gentiles who follow jewish customs and ceremonies i don't argue even though i don't agree because i want to help them when with the heathen i agree with them as much as i can except of course that i must also do what is right as a christian hey if you believe it just amen even more heartily and so then on sunday if somebody else doesn't amen we can go uh-huh all right listen he says i see him as one of the jews so they'll listen to the gospel and i can win them when i'm with the gentiles who still obey the law or who are under the law i don't argue with them i don't nitpick i don't pick a fight i don't challenge them to get into where we're head butting he goes i don't argue even though i don't agree because i want to help him he wants to keep that opportunity open doesn't want to alienate doesn't want to offend with the heathen i will agree as much as i possibly can except i will not do wrong by the word i'll agree as much as i can to the point to where i is right as a christian and don't think paul was soft and he didn't want confrontation paul rebuked peter when it was necessary to his face paul made sure we knew and so by agreeing notice as he agrees with the heathen so by agreeing i can win their confidence and help them too you really realize there's things that we can take issue with an exception with that will completely change our ability to impact the unbeliever and impart the gospel to them because we've took it aside we've taken a position and we've kind of muddied the waters of the gospel and muddy the waters of the truth that we hold and so they can't receive from us because they've just imagined the yard sign we have in front of our house even if it's not there when i am with those whose consciences bother them easily i don't act as though i know it all and don't say that they are foolish the result is that they are willing to let me help them because i don't belittle them and i don't make them feel foolish and though they may be offended very easily i don't act as if i know it all i don't make them feel fruitless or shamed or silly for feeling that way and the result is that they're willing to let me help them yes whatever person is like i try to find common ground with him so that he will let me tell him about christ and let christ save him that beautiful is it not does it not remind you of how brother branham taught us to witness if they like fish and talk to him about fishing and if you're like me that's all you ever wanted to talk about and you gotta remind us wait a minute we're fishers of men it sounds really disjointed because you've been talking about bass for 20 minutes but he says just kind of catch their spirit find what interests them show an interest it's very noticeable when someone takes interest in you what they did and all what they think and what how their family is and this and they get competitive and what they said the borderline personality disorder is when people just can't rejoice in what other people are saying it's like well well i ran five miles this morning it's like well i did six and a half it's like well i've never ran a mile in my life i you know that i mean look at me i would i haven't i haven't the only thing i run do is the dinner table and they but they can't rejoice with you right they're just like they want to get competitive with it paul is describing a nature in a character that makes us that makes us salty this is the salt of the earth this is the light of the world this is the the example of the great shepherd this is the example of the chief shepherd this is what paul was talking about when he says follow me as i follow christ it was in these very specific characteristics i realize it's very important to take the whole uh what paul was talking about how all things are lawful but maybe not expedient and he deals with a lot of different things in this but i believe that we're well taught to where we can understand these things he's saying that i do this to get the gospel to them i find common ground with him so that he will let me help him about christ and let christ save them he says i do this for the gospel sake i do this to get the gospel to them and also for the blessing i myself receive when i see them come to christ this is powerful especially when you realize he continues it in chapter 10 and he says but the prophet of why i do this is not seeking my own profit but the profit of many that they may be saved this is advocacy let me close with this the final voice is not our opinion it's not our personal preferences based on the word the final voice is the word it is the word in action if advocacy is public support it is active support the advocacy to voice the final voice is going to be the word and action a life lived by the word is the expressed and it's our public words and our public actions that become our voice it's what we express it's what we convey through all sorts of outlets and channels it's what we express openly in personal interactions it's what we post and express in social media channels it's the things we follow the things we support the things we subscribe to the things that we placard bumper sticker on our cars for what we vocalize what we tell others about what we forward what we text what we screenshot all these things are you hearing me all of it forms a persona all it forms a belief system all of it is shaping and writing on your yard sign saying in this person i believe and you're becoming a voice and it forms our public ministry it forms our advocacy paul said be ye followers of me even as i also am of christ and if you notice in this scripture there was a self-denial of paul paul had a self-denial paul had a moderation of opinion that sought one objective the promotion of the gospel and you talk about just a very a tremendous thing that when we can evaluate what we say and what we do and how we feel and and these things that though we might have personal opinions and convictions we say that i will not act in a manner that does not promote the gospel as a whole then that becomes something that can be a very good check to us as i've been studying i thought i was going to preach on it tonight and the lord has just kind of closed that door i've tried three three different times to preach on it but i've been studying the true identification the five definite identifications of the true church of the living god and and as i've been studying it and it's become so real to me how brother man identifies the true church and if there's a true church then no church should ever act advocate promote preach say or do anything that would harm the health of the true church you cannot act as a church that's preaching the word and preaching the truth but in what you're doing hurt or offend the true church i'm not opening the door lord i'm just saying what i wanted to preach but we have to also have this kind of conviction to our in our own personal lives that as the final voice to the final age i must act and live and conduct myself and treat others and respond to certain situations and carry myself in such a way that it promotes the gospel and is best for the welfare of others well what welfare not their personal sensitivities but the fact that they be saved we think that we when we think of it the wrong way and we leave this part out the promotion of the gospel that others might be saved and we think well we have to just be sensitive to these thin-skinned liberals and we just have to be sensitive to these people we just have to bow down to this and compromise to that and i will not compromise and i will not be sheep and i will not do this and i will not do that and there's a way that everything gets phrased to where we we we feel like well i've got to stand up and have a backbone you're missing the point we don't we're not quiet so that somebody else feels better about their position but we do what we do because we desire to see their soul saved and that will that'll that'll move us and motivate us in the shut your mouth ministry but it'll also motivate you and move you to speak when you want to speak because if we're not speaking they'll never hear and if we're speaking the wrong things it'll never make sense to them paul and this what he's expressing here giving up my own will my own comforts my own pleasures my own prophet that i might save the souls of all he did not do anything criminal did not do anything sinful did not do anything anti-word and he never acted against his conscience paul talked about his conscience we talked about the difference between being conscious in his conscience what we tried to identify even then was that our conscience should be informed by the word and dictated moved by the spirit that's how our conscience should be clean so that when we when we act that when we're offending our conscience our conscience says you shouldn't say this or you should say this or you shouldn't do that or you should do this uh that there's there's a word principle the word has left its imprint i'm acting according to the spirit i'm feeling motivated i'm feeling moved to do this and so paul did not act sinful contrary to the word nor did he offend his own conscience in what he said he did or what he said or did so he could actually in these things that we're reading act as one of the jews not argue with the gentiles who kept judaic religion became weak to the weak to the heathen as much as he could he agreed with them he did all these things and didn't offend the gospel but actually promoted it i've been thinking about the phrase the cause of christ the cause of christ the cause of christ the cause of christ is our justification it is our rationale for everything we say and do could we not say that the cause of christ is the reason why we conduct ourselves the way that we do you say the cause of christ well let me say it this way because of christ as christian because of christ that if we were not to be cured or to be short with somebody if they say well why do you do what you do you can say because of christ why do you take that position not because we're set for the defense of the message and we've got to be we've got to get strong with it we got to be fervent we got to be apologetic we got to defend every position we've got to chop the heads off of all these serpent seeds and we get real vitriol and or angry and real uh you know just just angst that we can get about things no we don't need to be that way we are the way we are because of christ for the cause of christ revelation chapter 22 verse 17 that was our text and the spirit and the bride say come notice how it immediately has an impact let him that heareth say come you say come and somebody hears it and now they're saying come what does that mean they're now one with the spirit so the spirit and the bride are now saying come so when you speak what the spirit says it'll have the impact on someone to come to the fountain and to speak and let him that is a third come and whosoever let him take the water of life freely our voice must harmonize with the voice of the spirit that says come because we are we're you are a source of living water as sister elizabeth saying if you're not drinking from the fountain how are the thirsty going to drink from you what kind of cistern are we what kind of fountain are we kind of pool what kind of glass of refreshment what are we serving what are we giving voice to we ought to be a source of living water invite our musicians to come this evening as they come if we can have every head bowed brother branham makes this statement as he's praying it's in the within a much larger passage of prayer that i thought would be very profound for us to hear but i just wanted to end with this may that still small voice attract the people tonight to real sanctified life a life that'll stand by their god that will stand by their church that will stand by their pastor that'll stand by the cause of christ that'll hold up a banner that'll live act dress go and associate and live in the environment that will be so salty that'll cause others to thirst to be like them this is the challenge to be the right kind of advocates still small voice even though it's sounding out from your life you see a real sanctified life and in that life you stand for god you stand for your church you stand by your pastor but you're standing by the cause of christ you're holding up a banner that'll live act dress go and associate and live in the environment that'll be so salty that'll cause others to thirst to be like them our heads bowed i invite you to be that fountain i invite you to reconsecrate yourself to the cause of christ to read these scriptures maybe a little bit differently than you've read them before maybe have them just revive to you and refresh to you by revelation to recognize that there's this fervency there's this legalism there's this righteous indignation there's this passion and this zeal that can be very very misguided when the love of christ is not behind all of it if you have a need in this area tonight and be very specific if you've challenged yourself what have i advocated for what voice am i echoing from my the amphitheater of my life what is it that gets the most air time if you feel the conviction of the spirit tonight you'd want to re-tune your epi your spiritual amphitheater you'd want to become that voice more tuned more in tune with the voice of christ and you need prayer invite you to stand tonight [Music] just asking if you'd want to stand and say lord i want [Music] pondering it now thinking about it god bless you all who've stood i think it's nearly everyone let's bow our heads in prayer our gracious heavenly father as we stand in your divine presence this evening we have been convicted by your word we've heard the your voice sounding out through the scripture that there's many voices in the land today that would deaden the voice of the supernatural that would confuse us on what the voice of god is [Music] that there's actual voices that pretend to be based on truth so as to confuse us that it is the truth it causes us to become an ardent supporter and advocate for certain things thinking that it's in defense of our faith or thinking that it's inspired by gospel truth but lord i believe as believers we must be very clear when we speak we must be very confident that what we're supporting and what we're espousing is scriptural if we're going to allege it so father tonight as everyone has stood i believe in support and their hearts opened up and asked that they could be this voice the final voice to be more tuned to your holy spirit to be able to echo back more clearly the things that relate to your word and to be better advocates for the cause of christ i pray that you would help us help us lord help us to be your advocates lord help us to do it for the promotion of the gospel for the gospel sake as paul said but then also that some might be saved what a beautiful barrier to him to entering into folly or foolishness or nonsense that he said that i can be all things to all men as long as i keep the goal in mind that they be saved may this become an ambition of ours lord is this end time truth and the great revelations that have been brought to us through the open of the word can be lived out in our flesh and sounded out through our members and it would catch the thirsty may we say with the spirit come [Music] come home come to the fountain i pray that you strengthen us tonight give us breath lord in our lungs give us relief from things that oppress us we ask this in the name of the lord jesus christ amen
