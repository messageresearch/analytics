[0:00] galatians chapter six we'll start with
[0:02] verse one we'll read to verse ten
[0:08] and i
[0:09] these are um
[0:12] verses i i found that i was just as i
[0:14] was finishing studying yesterday i was
[0:17] pondering on just the number of
[0:18] scriptures we were using today and how a
[0:20] lot of them seem to be very familiar
[0:23] and so it seems that maybe even as a
[0:24] church a young church we revisit a lot
[0:26] of similar themes over the last
[0:29] year almost year and a half
[0:31] and i trust that the
[0:33] the repetition is beneficial
[0:35] and in each repetition there's more that
[0:38] would come out and more that would stand
[0:39] out to us more to be revealed if god is
[0:42] going to continue to unfold himself
[0:44] through eternity then we should be
[0:46] having the experience in church that the
[0:48] word continues to unfold itself and
[0:50] we're not just rallying around a
[0:53] personal doctrine that we gravitated to
[0:56] 30 years ago but the word keeps getting
[0:57] richer and unfolding around us galatians
[1:01] chapter 6 verse 1 brethren if a man be
[1:03] overtaken in a fault ye which are
[1:05] spiritual restore such a one in the
[1:07] spirit of meekness considering thyself
[1:10] lest thou also be tempted
[1:12] bear ye one another's burdens and so
[1:14] fulfill the law of christ for if a man
[1:17] think himself to be something when he is
[1:19] nothing he deceiveth himself
[1:21] but let every man prove his own work and
[1:24] then shall he have rejoicing in himself
[1:26] alone and not in another for every man
[1:29] shall bear his own burden let him that
[1:31] is taught in the word communicate unto
[1:33] him that teacheth in all good things
[1:35] be not deceived
[1:37] god is not mocked for whatsoever man
[1:39] soweth that shall he also reap for he
[1:42] that sowed to his flesh shall of the
[1:43] flesh reap corruption but he that soweth
[1:45] to the spirit shall have the spirit reap
[1:47] life everlasting and let us not be weary
[1:50] in well doing for in due season we shall
[1:52] reap if we faint not
[1:54] as we have therefore opportunity let us
[1:56] do good unto all men
[1:58] especially unto them who are of the
[2:00] household of faith
[2:02] amen you can be seated
[2:06] going to continue on the subject of
[2:07] barriers and boundaries
[2:10] and i will take a little bit of time
[2:12] this morning to recap some of the
[2:14] principles of the last two services
[2:16] just so that we're all the same page as
[2:18] we take a step forward in this
[2:20] and uh i have a title it's kind of a
[2:23] subject i want to approach the pride
[2:26] paradox i think i mentioned it uh that
[2:29] on perfect pride and i'm gonna call the
[2:32] pride paradox and i believe if you can
[2:35] follow me and just be patient and try to
[2:38] listen very diligently to the things
[2:40] we're expressing
[2:41] you'll be able to catch something very
[2:43] personal for yourself i've been getting
[2:45] some feedback from the different
[2:46] services it's been very very encouraging
[2:49] and what i've realized as i'm
[2:51] ministering is i feel that i'm doing i'm
[2:53] approaching it in a sense that's just
[2:54] very surface but yet there's a very very
[2:57] deep layers
[2:58] to the things we're expressing and i
[2:59] don't feel that i'm doing it justice at
[3:01] all
[3:02] and as i minister on this subject i can
[3:04] see the principle running on many
[3:07] different tracks
[3:08] so that if whatever situation you are in
[3:10] your life you may be applying it more to
[3:12] some spiritual things and the unfolding
[3:13] of the word there might be other ways
[3:15] where you're applying it to personal
[3:17] relationships but there's just so many
[3:18] different ways these things are
[3:20] applicable and so i trust that you could
[3:22] just really believe today that god's
[3:24] going to speak to you in a way that's
[3:26] particular to what you're going through
[3:28] and what you need
[3:29] and maybe you could even have the kind
[3:30] of faith to believe that lord you even
[3:32] know better than myself what i need
[3:34] therefore you can open my eyes and even
[3:37] as maybe we could say surprise me
[3:40] with something that really anchors in my
[3:42] heart for what i have need of so we'll
[3:44] want to continue on barriers and
[3:45] boundaries and the pride paradox
[3:48] wednesday night we were talking about
[3:49] how god is boundless as a god that fills
[3:51] all time in space he's a god who can do
[3:53] whatever he wants brother braham taught
[3:55] us in the absolute that he is unlimited
[3:58] in his power
[3:59] and being the absolute he is free from
[4:01] restraint he cannot be contained
[4:04] he is a god that is all-powerful
[4:06] all-knowing
[4:08] uh all omnipresent through his
[4:10] omniscience and this is a god who cannot
[4:12] be restrained he cannot stop but yet
[4:15] what makes him so great is that he will
[4:17] he's willing to confine himself he's
[4:19] willing to restrain himself he's willing
[4:21] to hold himself to his own word
[4:24] i can make a promise to you and say i
[4:25] promise i'll do this and then tomorrow
[4:27] break it and he said well why did you
[4:29] break it because i can
[4:30] i can break it i can break it if i wanna
[4:32] you don't you can't force me to do that
[4:34] you can't you can't make me
[4:36] make me do something
[4:38] and uh and in that way
[4:40] a god is willing to be bound by his word
[4:43] he's different he's better he's better
[4:44] than us his ways are higher than ours
[4:46] his thoughts higher than ours so he's
[4:47] willing to be bound in revelations
[4:49] chapter 3 verse 20
[4:51] and hopefully i could just um
[4:53] enter right back in where we were
[4:55] revelations chapter 3 verse 20 says
[4:57] behold i here's christ a fugitive in his
[5:00] own church and kicked out of his own
[5:01] church i stand at the door and knock if
[5:04] any man hear my voice and open the door
[5:07] i will come into him and will sup with
[5:09] him and he with me
[5:11] as we pondered this picture is the
[5:13] all-knowing all-powerful god pushed out
[5:16] of his own church
[5:18] and as he stands at the door god is
[5:21] powerful enough to enter
[5:23] god could even in the absence of a
[5:25] latchet in the absence of a handle god
[5:27] could push his way in but he chose to
[5:29] knock
[5:30] brother bam told us that in this way as
[5:33] he stood there he was waiting for us to
[5:35] let him in
[5:36] waiting for you to open up so we must
[5:38] permit god we must allow god we must
[5:41] give him permission because he will not
[5:43] force himself
[5:45] he's there he wants to sup with you he
[5:46] wants to fellowship with you but he's
[5:48] not going to force himself upon you he's
[5:50] not going to kick the door open he's not
[5:51] going to barge himself in it's in that
[5:53] way that he is a gentleman he's
[5:55] respecting the fact that the door is
[5:56] closed he's respecting the fact that
[5:58] you're inside and that's your place but
[6:01] he's wanting you to come out of that
[6:02] place of safety or that place of comfort
[6:04] or what you've always known he's wanting
[6:06] you to open up the door so he could come
[6:08] into you and change your situation
[6:09] change your circumstance and he's
[6:11] demonstrating how that he has respect
[6:13] for boundaries
[6:15] and so the door is in that way a part of
[6:18] a boundary and here
[6:21] you're in a place you're closed off
[6:23] christ is on the outside he's been put
[6:25] over some line he's on the outside of
[6:27] the church and the door represents this
[6:30] appropriate place to request an entrance
[6:33] he's not peeking in the window he's not
[6:35] crawling through some other way he's at
[6:36] the door and he's there at that place
[6:39] i'm knocking because that's where he
[6:41] wants to come in
[6:43] and so that kind of teaches us about
[6:45] boundaries that a boundary
[6:46] sets up certain parameters the door is
[6:48] the place to enter
[6:50] and so god will not force himself past a
[6:52] boundary because god we've demonstrated
[6:55] in scripture that god sets boundaries
[6:56] but then god also respects boundaries
[7:00] and
[7:00] a boundary if there is a boundary it
[7:03] doesn't always mean that you cannot pass
[7:05] or you cannot enter in
[7:07] a boundary as this scripture shows us
[7:09] we'll have points of entry gate or a
[7:11] door some sort of entry point we're not
[7:14] uh we may have uh
[7:16] we may be in a situation where we're
[7:17] traveling internationally or there's a
[7:19] border well just because there's a
[7:20] border or there's a wall doesn't mean
[7:22] everyone is barred from entering but you
[7:24] have to come to the appropriate place to
[7:26] enter the port of entry and to provide
[7:29] documentation and then you can be
[7:30] allowed in it just it's an example of
[7:32] how there's boundaries there's border
[7:34] lines there can be walls there can be
[7:36] hedges these things that are set up but
[7:37] there's a place where you can enter
[7:40] and christ is the entry point into the
[7:42] boundless word of god
[7:44] christ is the only way in it's through
[7:46] christ that we have access to the father
[7:48] god may hide himself and god may limit
[7:51] himself and god may place himself into
[7:54] his word and hide himself in his word
[7:56] and hide himself in simplicity
[7:58] but there's a way that we can find him
[8:00] there's a way that we can see him
[8:01] there's a way that we can fellowship
[8:02] with him and it's through christ
[8:04] so god sets boundaries
[8:06] god respects boundaries but god gives us
[8:08] also a point of access and entry
[8:11] but satan on the other hand he sets
[8:13] barriers
[8:14] he cannot establish limits satan cannot
[8:17] create he can only pervert and so god
[8:19] having created the earth satan does not
[8:21] have the ability to establish the
[8:22] parameters of the earth in the breadth
[8:24] of the earth and the breadth of creation
[8:26] of the limits of creation what satan
[8:28] tries to do is pervert the expression of
[8:31] god's creation so he places barriers and
[8:33] obstacles and hindrances in the way
[8:36] a barrier is something that obstructs an
[8:38] entrance a boundary is something that
[8:40] marks the limits of something so they're
[8:42] two different things and so satan sets
[8:44] barriers to the word of god and he
[8:46] disrespects the boundaries of the word
[8:48] of god
[8:50] it says this those are the
[8:51] characteristics of satan to disrespect
[8:54] boundaries and to cast barriers in front
[8:57] of the the entrances and the accesses to
[9:00] the full limits of god's word
[9:02] i believe it was last sunday we were
[9:04] using genesis chapter 2 verses 16 to 17
[9:07] where god told
[9:08] a man that he was not to eat of the tree
[9:10] of knowledge of good and evil
[9:12] and this prohibition of eating the fruit
[9:14] of the tree of the knowledge of good and
[9:15] evil was not meant to limit adam's power
[9:19] he's given dominion the whole earth is
[9:20] his he's to rule he's to reign he's to
[9:23] have dominion he's to subdue he's to eat
[9:25] of all the fruits of the field and the
[9:26] herbs he's to have all the creation at
[9:28] his disposal but then god identifies the
[9:31] fruit of this particular tree in the
[9:32] midst of the garden and in doing so god
[9:35] wasn't scaling back adam's power but it
[9:38] was a boundary for god's protection or
[9:41] for adam's protection it was a boundary
[9:43] of protection
[9:44] of for god's creation he says this is
[9:46] what i want you to do these are all your
[9:48] powers but don't partake of this not
[9:51] because he was taking that out of away
[9:53] from his powers but he was saying this
[9:55] will limit your power
[9:57] i've given you everything but this is
[9:59] one way that you can lose it i've given
[10:00] you everything but this is one way that
[10:02] you can diminish it and so it was
[10:04] something to be respected it was
[10:05] something to be honored not to restrain
[10:08] adam but so that he would remain
[10:10] completely free
[10:11] and in genesis chapter 3 we see that
[10:13] satan through the
[10:15] the body of the serpent
[10:16] enticed the woman and enticed her beyond
[10:19] the boundary of god's protection in
[10:22] order to get to her
[10:23] in order to throw a barrier in the way
[10:25] of mankind fulfilling genesis 1 26 and a
[10:28] way of trying to limit the expression of
[10:31] god's creation
[10:32] and as we looked at that as god
[10:34] prohibited adam from partaking of the
[10:36] fruit that was a boundary of protection
[10:39] for the man and the woman but on the
[10:41] other side to satan that became a
[10:43] barrier to his agenda
[10:45] it became a barrier to him being able to
[10:48] pervert and him to have influence in him
[10:50] to have control so god's boundaries of
[10:54] protection for you are barriers to satan
[10:57] and what may be a boundary to you can be
[11:00] a barrier to somebody else and so that's
[11:02] it they can say we've been using the
[11:04] word paradox a lot but that may be one
[11:06] way that what god sets for you as a
[11:08] boundary to somebody else's well that's
[11:09] just a barrier i want to be who i want
[11:11] to be i want to do what i want
[11:13] but satan made the woman
[11:15] to see what was god's boundary of
[11:17] protection she saw it as a barrier
[11:20] and so when you see a barrier you try to
[11:22] get around it try to get over it try to
[11:24] figure out why it's there this is trying
[11:25] to keep me from something the barrier is
[11:27] placed there is trying to impede my
[11:29] progress so i'm going to push through it
[11:30] i'm going to jump over i'm a tunnel
[11:31] under it and so the woman saw something
[11:33] as a barrier so she went past it but
[11:36] what it was was actually a boundary
[11:38] and where we were ending
[11:41] on sunday
[11:43] i believe it was on sunday last sunday
[11:46] is satan wants us to see god's word as a
[11:49] barrier
[11:50] not that we would say oh that's god's
[11:52] word it's a barrier but to see something
[11:54] that is the word of god but yet begin to
[11:56] pervert it to where you say it no this
[11:58] is a barrier this is bondage this is
[11:59] limiting this is controlling so he wants
[12:01] to see the word of god and he wants to
[12:03] make it to look like bondage something
[12:05] that's limiting something that's a
[12:07] binding or restraining
[12:09] and we acknowledge that god's word has
[12:11] been perverted by man
[12:14] has been unrighteously used to bind
[12:16] people it has been used to abuse
[12:19] and has been used in ungodly ways
[12:22] that usually happens on a wednesday not
[12:24] a sunday so we're making progress the
[12:26] devils aren't stirred up early in the
[12:28] week
[12:30] but we know that the word has been used
[12:33] in ungodly ways
[12:35] if i need to i can switch it's fine i'll
[12:37] just switch to a handheld that'll
[12:39] restrain me
[12:40] this will be binding this will be
[12:41] limiting
[12:44] but i won't let it be a barrier to the
[12:46] word coming forward
[12:48] i'm not nervous if you are you need to
[12:50] relax
[12:51] this is not bothering me one bit
[12:53] uh it was the worst things that can
[12:55] happen when you're standing in front of
[12:56] a group of people
[12:58] and so we
[13:00] again we know that the word of god has
[13:02] been unrighteously used it has been used
[13:05] uh there's been bully pulpits there's
[13:08] been clubs that have been used quotes
[13:10] that are used uh the message of the hour
[13:12] used to restrain to bind
[13:14] and to marginalize people and to hinder
[13:17] and to limit
[13:18] but that is a misrepresentation of truth
[13:21] that's man taking truth and using it to
[13:24] bind people to himself for his own
[13:25] personality his own gain and there's a
[13:28] lot of cults of personalities that have
[13:30] risen up in the message but the true
[13:32] message is liberating
[13:34] the truth is freedom the truth that sets
[13:36] a person free or really brings them to
[13:38] themselves and so when we look at the
[13:41] word of god and we and i say this
[13:43] because there's this idea of living free
[13:46] and having rights and exercising uh who
[13:49] you are and just following what's in
[13:51] your heart and the freedoms and
[13:52] liberties that are espoused these days
[13:54] and how we want everyone to have rights
[13:56] and equal access to certain things
[13:58] and that's wonderful in a political
[14:00] sphere that may be wonderful in a social
[14:02] sphere but when it comes to the word of
[14:04] god we begin to look at it and say well
[14:06] the word of god says this that's a
[14:08] boundary it says this that's a boundary
[14:09] men ought to be this way that's a
[14:11] boundary marriage is this way that's a
[14:13] boundary women are this way that's a
[14:14] boundary but not in the sense of
[14:16] limiting you or restraining you
[14:19] boundaries are not for the purpose of
[14:21] being restrained or bound or limited but
[14:23] it's for the purpose of putting you in
[14:25] position to lose all the power that is
[14:28] within you
[14:29] it is it is important to recognize that
[14:31] if there's a boundary that's set by god
[14:33] it's not there to handcuff you it's
[14:35] there to take the handcuffs off
[14:38] it's there to put you in a position
[14:40] to thrive and so we have
[14:42] power over barriers by recognizing and
[14:46] respecting the boundaries of god's word
[14:49] we're going to have power over satan's
[14:51] barriers not by needling and meddling
[14:53] with his
[14:54] his barriers but by recognizing and
[14:57] respecting the boundaries of god's word
[14:59] and if i could put it this way that's
[15:01] finding your place
[15:02] that's where you're going to be able to
[15:04] overcome every barrier every obstacle
[15:06] every limiting thing is when you just
[15:08] find your place in the word of god
[15:10] and find your satisfaction being within
[15:12] the boundaries that he's established for
[15:14] you
[15:15] and we looked at matthew chapter 13 and
[15:17] how the those in the the country of
[15:19] jesus he said a prophet is not honor
[15:21] without honor saving his own home his
[15:23] own country
[15:24] and he was there in nazareth and the
[15:26] bible says he was unable to do many
[15:28] mighty work because of their unbelief
[15:30] and the nazarenes missed out on those
[15:33] midi mighty works because of the barrier
[15:36] of the flesh of christ the barriers of
[15:38] his family his family history the
[15:40] details about his birth and all those
[15:42] things hindered them and it was called a
[15:43] barrier of unbelief or because of their
[15:45] unbelief and so this is a this is a
[15:48] barrier to them experiencing the
[15:50] supernatural
[15:51] not because jesus all of a sudden walked
[15:53] into a situation he says well my hands
[15:55] are tight i can't do this it was
[15:57] respecting a boundary of god's word that
[15:59] he operates according to faith
[16:02] in the presence of unbelief it wasn't
[16:03] that he the unbelief is greater than god
[16:06] but it's something that god only
[16:08] operates by he operates by faith
[16:10] therefore he limited himself he he
[16:12] respects this boundary
[16:14] and so god had purposely hid himself in
[16:16] the simplicity of christ and here he is
[16:19] standing before him able to do many
[16:20] mighty works but they turned him away
[16:23] they turned away from him as the
[16:24] scripture says because of the flesh that
[16:26] was in front of him
[16:28] but then in john chapter one nathaniel
[16:30] believed christ just through a simple
[16:32] display of discernment through a simple
[16:34] display a small simple act of
[16:36] recognizing something in his life giving
[16:39] him some detail that was very personal
[16:41] and and he believed that you're the
[16:42] messiah
[16:44] and and in that in that moment jesus
[16:47] said because i said i saw you under the
[16:49] fig tree you believe and he says you'll
[16:50] see my greater works
[16:52] why because having this true faith
[16:54] ignited being able to get past the veil
[16:56] to believe this was the messiah he said
[16:58] you're going to see greater things next
[17:01] and the manifestation of god is not
[17:03] always in the fantastic way that we
[17:05] would like it to be as humans it's not
[17:07] always in the extravagant way that we
[17:09] think that it should be since it's
[17:11] divine it's god so the way god manifests
[17:14] himself is not always great in the way
[17:16] that our humans minds imagine it to be
[17:19] it happened in the first coming of
[17:21] christ when they were expecting a
[17:22] warrior king to liberate them from the
[17:24] oppression of the romans but yet it came
[17:26] in the simple carpenter the son of
[17:29] joseph the son of mary one that we know
[17:31] your brothers your sisters are yet with
[17:32] us
[17:33] but yet this is the messiah standing
[17:35] before him
[17:37] and in first kings chapter 19 is as
[17:39] elijah has fled from jezebel and he's
[17:41] hiding in a cave god said go hide
[17:44] yourself i'm going to pass by him and
[17:46] when the lord passed by there was a wind
[17:50] and he and there was an earthquake and
[17:51] there was a fire but god wasn't in any
[17:53] of them he was in the still
[17:56] small voice that gaunt weak he used the
[17:59] hebrew the gaunt weak whisper is where
[18:01] god was and that's what readied elijah
[18:04] that's what got him ready it was the
[18:06] glory of his voice word as brother
[18:08] branham said this is this is where his
[18:10] abiding presence was as something small
[18:12] something weak but that's what caught
[18:14] the prophet's attention that's what
[18:16] motivated him so i'm using that in this
[18:18] kind of throwing these things out there
[18:20] again for us to put him in our view this
[18:21] morning of how the human wants to see
[18:24] something great in order to see god but
[18:25] god hides himself in something simple
[18:28] but that becomes the access to god
[18:30] and if we're always looking for
[18:31] something big and flashy and something
[18:33] to sensitize the flesh then that's going
[18:35] to be a barrier to you entering within
[18:38] the boundaries where god is
[18:40] and to find the blessings that you need
[18:42] and the experience the grace that you
[18:43] need for the time that you're in
[18:45] and so a barrier to missing god's power
[18:48] is not recognizing the boundaries of his
[18:50] promise
[18:52] well i want this and i want that well
[18:54] where is he where's his promise what's
[18:55] his promise for today
[18:57] if you're praying and calling out for
[18:58] god to manifest himself in justification
[19:00] well he's already done that if you're
[19:02] praying and asking god to restore the
[19:04] gifts he's already done that
[19:06] and so there's a way that we could try
[19:07] to worship him by glares of past days
[19:10] and try to worship him in the shadows of
[19:12] other revivals and he but that's not
[19:14] going to bring you into his presence
[19:16] you've got to recognize where god is in
[19:18] his word the boundaries of his promise
[19:21] for the day that you're living in
[19:22] because that's where you're going to
[19:24] find them
[19:25] and so a barrier to
[19:27] not receiving blessings and receiving
[19:29] the benefits and recognizing christ
[19:31] is failing to recognize where god is
[19:33] hiding himself where he's manifesting
[19:35] self where and where his promises are
[19:38] and if i could say this true power is
[19:40] going to be found in the simplicity of
[19:41] the present truth
[19:43] that's where you're going to find true
[19:44] power you're going to find true power by
[19:46] just simply doing the part that he's
[19:48] called you to do
[19:50] it's not in the great big things it's
[19:51] not in the things that we would like it
[19:53] to be there's ways that we want god to
[19:54] vindicate us and to avenge us and
[19:56] wouldn't it be nice if god could just
[19:58] come down as a 900-foot jesus and start
[20:01] wrapping on the heads of all the people
[20:02] that have criticized us and
[20:04] and burning people's homes who who've
[20:06] done bad things to us and we could sit
[20:08] there and taunt them and laugh and
[20:10] and feel avenged but really when you
[20:12] think about it god's going to avenge you
[20:13] just by making you disappear
[20:16] and they're going to think oh yeah those
[20:17] cultist people finally got lost in the
[20:19] white mountains and they ran off and did
[20:20] this and they're just going to think you
[20:22] just disappeared or you were a victim of
[20:24] covet and that's how god's going to
[20:25] choose to avenge you
[20:27] and so sometimes the avenging
[20:30] and the the vindication
[20:32] and the vengeance that they were going
[20:34] to
[20:34] experience isn't always in the way that
[20:36] we would like it to be
[20:38] in the message humble thyself brother
[20:40] brahm says and god can only operate as
[20:42] we let him operate
[20:44] there's the permission
[20:45] there's the boundary
[20:47] you mean god can't just do whatever he
[20:48] wants to whenever he wants well he can
[20:50] but he won't
[20:52] because he's waiting he's waiting for us
[20:54] to let him to give him permission to
[20:56] allow him as paul said this will we do
[20:58] if god will permit that means god has to
[21:01] allow god has to grant something we
[21:03] can't just do it unless god allows it
[21:05] but then also on the other hand there's
[21:06] things that god is waiting for us to do
[21:09] for us to do our part he says you know
[21:11] people want power and really they don't
[21:13] know what power is
[21:15] they don't really know what goes with it
[21:18] the way up is down always there's your
[21:20] paradox if you want power see how humble
[21:23] you can get
[21:24] just get away from your worldly thinking
[21:26] and humble yourself before god
[21:29] and then you've got more power
[21:31] than the man that runs all over the
[21:33] building and makes a big lot of noise
[21:36] let's be honest with ourselves that's
[21:38] contrary
[21:39] to our our immediate way of thinking
[21:41] that what makes a powerful preacher is
[21:44] how loud his voice is and and the
[21:46] anointing is based upon the amount of
[21:48] sweat that's dripping off the end of his
[21:49] tie
[21:50] and a lot of times it's volume and it's
[21:52] charisma and it's it's the it's the
[21:54] exercising of the body he says but get
[21:57] yourself humble before god humble your
[21:59] thinking then you have more power than a
[22:00] man that can run all over the building
[22:02] and make a lot of noise
[22:03] this is changing our view of things
[22:05] changing the way we think about what
[22:06] makes something dynamic what makes
[22:07] something powerful because you've been
[22:09] able to conquer yourself and commit
[22:11] yourself to christ you see to humble
[22:14] yourself before him that's really power
[22:17] he says you show me a church that's
[22:18] humble real humble not an arrogancy a
[22:21] church just a sweet humble church i'll
[22:24] show you a church that has the favor and
[22:26] power of god in it
[22:28] not an arrogant church not a boastful
[22:30] church not a a boisterous church but a
[22:32] church that's just humble he says real
[22:34] humble sweet humble church that's a
[22:36] church that has favor and power the
[22:38] power of god in it so there might be a
[22:41] way that we want to see an expression of
[22:43] god that kind of gets in our face and is
[22:45] real bold and real brash
[22:47] and maybe obvious to us but it says god
[22:49] is dwelling in the sweetness this
[22:51] meekness and this humility and that's a
[22:53] church that god favors and that's where
[22:55] you'll find the power of god
[22:58] i don't want to have a church for myself
[23:00] personally i wouldn't want to go to a
[23:01] church that just makes me tired after
[23:03] i've been in service because i've
[23:05] exercised so much
[23:07] i want to have a church that even though
[23:09] it might seem to be very even
[23:12] and everyone very reserved and just
[23:13] sweet and humble but it gives me power
[23:15] to overcome on tuesday gives me power to
[23:18] wake up on a monday morning and despite
[23:20] melancholy and a cloud of depression
[23:22] around me you say you know what god is
[23:24] with me we can do this we can handle
[23:25] this and not be like oh well i wish i
[23:28] was in church again i want something
[23:29] that i can feed on that's going to
[23:31] strengthen me he says that's where a
[23:33] church that is humble not arrogant
[23:35] humble sweet that's the church that has
[23:37] the favor and power of god and he said
[23:39] that's right that's the thing that takes
[23:41] humility humbling ourselves before god
[23:44] letting god just work through us
[23:47] so here's again a letting allowing
[23:49] giving god permission letting god just
[23:50] work through us don't have to make a lot
[23:52] of noise and all the quiet people said
[23:55] oh you said amen you're supposed to nod
[23:57] your head
[23:58] all the introverts are like
[24:01] we like that that's good but now you're
[24:04] coming out see
[24:06] the power of god is already working
[24:09] you don't have to make a lot of noise
[24:12] and don't we measure ourselves sometimes
[24:14] by the person always praises and the one
[24:15] that always worships the one that always
[24:17] seems to be so unrestrained and we start
[24:19] comparing ourselves i wish i could shout
[24:21] like that sister well you don't have to
[24:24] what you really want is to be humble and
[24:26] you want to have the power
[24:27] not just the letting out of the steam
[24:29] that's one of the things brother bam
[24:30] identified where there's always this
[24:32] outburst and the the church is just
[24:34] blowing off its steam and it's not
[24:36] channeling it to really get themselves
[24:38] down the tracks
[24:40] now if you'll turn in your bibles to
[24:42] romans chapter 12 verses 1 to 6.
[24:46] in romans chapter 12 verses 1 to 6 i
[24:48] want to read through this
[24:50] and hopefully be able to identify
[24:54] some things as we read through it but
[24:55] i'm wanting just to introduce it into
[24:58] the record because there's such a such
[25:00] powerful things contained in this and
[25:02] this has been real part of my
[25:03] inspiration on this subject says i
[25:04] beseech you therefore brethren by the
[25:06] mercies of god
[25:07] that ye present your bodies
[25:10] this is something you're presenting this
[25:11] is consent you're presenting it this is
[25:14] something that you god is acknowledging
[25:16] that you it is in your power and your
[25:18] control now to offer yourself to be
[25:20] willing to give yourself present your
[25:22] body is a living sacrifice holy
[25:24] acceptable unto god which is your
[25:26] reasonable service and be not conformed
[25:29] to this world the world wants to conform
[25:31] us and mold us into a temporary image it
[25:34] wants to force us into something and
[25:37] restrict us into what if i could say
[25:39] boundaries of the word or the world and
[25:41] it wants to bind us and control us what
[25:44] we're doing is we're allowing barriers
[25:45] to force us into a particular expression
[25:49] it's good for us to take a step back and
[25:51] realize that through the availability of
[25:52] data and information and being connected
[25:54] to people and hearing their anecdotal
[25:56] stories and this information and that
[25:58] experience that more and more things are
[26:00] becoming a problem in people's lives not
[26:03] because it's part of their nature and
[26:05] not because it's part of who they are
[26:07] but they're being informed by other
[26:09] things and it's influencing them to want
[26:12] to be things and to express themselves
[26:14] in certain ways and these things would
[26:16] not be so had the information not been
[26:18] spread
[26:20] and when we recognize that there is a
[26:22] conforming of the world but yet there is
[26:25] also a transforming by the word
[26:28] but be transformed by the renewing of
[26:30] your mind that ye may prove now think
[26:33] about that that ye may prove what is
[26:35] that good and acceptable and perfect
[26:38] will of god so you're going to prove
[26:40] this this is something that you are a
[26:41] part of for i say
[26:44] through the grace given unto me to every
[26:47] man that is among you this is what he
[26:48] says not to think of himself more highly
[26:51] than he ought to think
[26:53] so you're to present your bodies as a
[26:54] living sacrifice holy and acceptable
[26:56] under god it's your reasonable service
[26:58] you're to be transformed not conformed
[27:00] your minds to be renewed you're going to
[27:02] prove what is the perfect will of god
[27:03] but don't think of yourself more highly
[27:06] than you ought to think
[27:08] but to think soberly
[27:10] according as god hath dealt to every man
[27:13] the measure of faith now do you catch
[27:15] what he just said
[27:16] don't think of yourself more than you
[27:18] ought to but think of yourself up to the
[27:20] measure that you ought to
[27:23] think soberly according as god hath
[27:25] dealt to every man the measure of faith
[27:27] for as we have many members in one body
[27:29] and all members have not the same office
[27:31] so we being many are one body in christ
[27:34] and everyone remembers one of another
[27:37] and then this is what we used in talking
[27:39] about practice having then gifts
[27:40] different according to the grace that is
[27:42] given to us what does he say use them
[27:44] be exercising wait on them in other
[27:46] words be active in them be using them
[27:48] and therefore we have gifts differing
[27:51] according to the grace according to what
[27:53] the the great the measure that god had
[27:55] dealt to every man
[27:58] so i want you again just to look at
[28:00] these verses
[28:01] don't think of yourself more than you
[28:02] ought to
[28:04] but think of yourself according to the
[28:06] measure of faith that god has dealt you
[28:09] because we're all part of the body and
[28:11] not all of us have the same measure not
[28:13] all of us have the same office not all
[28:15] of us have the same gifts
[28:17] therefore we all should not think of
[28:19] more than we ought to but we ought to
[28:21] think of ourselves according to the
[28:22] measure of faith given us
[28:24] now this is where i want to talk about
[28:26] the pride paradox and start
[28:28] emphasizing this a little bit more
[28:31] we must lose our pride in order to take
[28:34] our place in the body
[28:36] because paul says don't think of
[28:37] yourself more than you ought to so he's
[28:38] addressing this carnal humanistic pride
[28:40] want to put yourself forward you want to
[28:42] be the one that gets the the uh the
[28:44] credit or there's just something about
[28:46] the the self that's wanting to be served
[28:48] so he's saying that we must lose don't
[28:50] think more highly of yourself than you
[28:52] ought to think in order to be a proper
[28:54] member within the body of christ
[28:57] but
[28:58] at the same time we must take pride in
[29:00] the place we hold within the body
[29:03] he says don't don't think of yourself
[29:05] more than you ought to
[29:07] but we ought to take pride in what we
[29:09] are
[29:10] in this way pride is a boundary pride is
[29:13] a barrier
[29:14] it's getting very quiet i can tell that
[29:16] paradox was the appropriate word to use
[29:18] this morning for the subject that i'm
[29:20] speaking on
[29:21] paul's teaching something very striking
[29:23] again this might be where you really
[29:24] need to if you could just focus with me
[29:26] and if i'm not conveying it right i take
[29:28] the blame for it
[29:30] but paul is teaching something very very
[29:32] striking and what he's teaching
[29:35] because there's certain principles that
[29:36] we often look at oh we're all members
[29:39] one of another and and god's given us
[29:41] all a different measure and we're to be
[29:43] transformed not conformed and our bodies
[29:45] are reasonable sacrifice there's some
[29:46] parts of this that are very easy to
[29:48] overlook because what paul is doing is
[29:50] he's bringing a very delicate balance
[29:51] when it comes to pride let me look at it
[29:54] this way there's two types of pride
[29:56] there's a pride that we're all very
[29:58] familiar with that we find is most often
[30:00] preached against or preached about and
[30:02] that would be a pride that is a weakness
[30:04] so that's the one pride we're very
[30:05] familiar with it's a weakness but
[30:07] there's another pride that is a strength
[30:09] i ref mentioned it
[30:11] here recently called it a perfect pride
[30:13] and that seems like a paradox how could
[30:15] you have a perfect pride but in psalms
[30:17] 139 verses 21 and 22
[30:22] i think i just noticed a typo there it's
[30:24] not verse 22 to 22. it's 21-22
[30:27] and i type these up by hand sometimes so
[30:29] that's where the mistakes come in it
[30:30] says do not i hate them o lord that hate
[30:32] thee and am not i grieved with those
[30:35] that rise up against thee so he this is
[30:38] he's justifying himself right
[30:40] hey i hate those that hate you
[30:43] we're good right he says i'm not am i
[30:45] not greed by those who are offensive and
[30:48] don't believe in your word he says i
[30:49] hate them with perfect hatred
[30:52] i count them mine enemies
[30:54] and so this phrase perfect hatred seems
[30:56] to be
[30:57] um
[30:58] i realize it's maybe in itself a paradox
[31:01] to have a perfect hatred because we
[31:02] would think that hatred is not of god
[31:04] and hatred is bad and hatred is an evil
[31:06] thing but
[31:08] this uh this one is expressing that i
[31:10] hate him with the complete
[31:12] full perfect hatred
[31:14] and why do i hate them because they're
[31:15] against your word
[31:17] and he continues in the next few couple
[31:19] verses to say well search my heart lord
[31:21] examine me and see if there be any
[31:22] wicked way in me so i appreciate the
[31:24] humility of david to express it i
[31:26] believe it's david expressing this to
[31:27] say
[31:28] i hate those that hate you and it's a
[31:31] perfect hatred but lord if that's not
[31:33] correct if that's not right examine me
[31:34] if there be any wicked way in me lord
[31:36] purge it and cleanse it out so in the
[31:38] same way i want to say that there is a a
[31:40] a nasty pride but there could be a
[31:42] perfect pride or a perfect pride or just
[31:44] a bad pride good pride bad pride are the
[31:47] words maybe i'm using or if i could say
[31:49] it this way a godly pride versus a
[31:51] sinful pride the man called it the pride
[31:54] of sin
[31:55] or there's a if there's a sin that's a
[31:56] pride a pride is a sin there's something
[31:58] the bible talks about proverbs the
[32:00] things that god hates and over and over
[32:02] again we see the word of god identifying
[32:04] the nastiness the evilness the
[32:06] corruptness of pride
[32:08] but i want to
[32:10] look at a godly pride sister lorraine
[32:12] shepherd used to always ask me to preach
[32:14] a sermon on godly pride you should
[32:16] preach on godly pride well sister
[32:18] lorraine i'm preaching ungodly praying
[32:22] in second corinthians chapter 11 verse 2
[32:25] this might help you a little bit if
[32:26] you're stumbling with the idea that
[32:27] there can be a good pride for i am
[32:29] jealous over you with godly jealousy
[32:32] for i have espoused you to one husband
[32:35] that i may present you as a chaste
[32:36] virgin to christ
[32:38] we recognize in the scripture that
[32:39] jealousy is often
[32:41] placed in the context that it's negative
[32:43] it's defiled and it's corrupting it's
[32:44] something that we ought to uh abandon
[32:47] from and be cleansed from and not to
[32:48] have within ourselves but paul uses this
[32:51] idea in a way to say that it is there is
[32:53] a godly jealousy
[32:55] there can be a perfect hatred there can
[32:57] be a godly jealousy there's a way that
[32:59] you could desire something and be
[33:00] zealous for it and want it and crave it
[33:02] and yet it aligns with something godly
[33:04] it aligns with something that's pure and
[33:06] that's what i want you to begin to think
[33:08] about there's a bad pride there is a
[33:09] good pride
[33:11] there's a pride that is excessive
[33:13] baseless without foundation self-view
[33:15] you view yourself baselessly you see
[33:17] yourself in an inflated way it's called
[33:19] conceit it's called arrogance it's the
[33:21] hubristic way there's just it's hubris
[33:24] it's empty it's boasting it's it
[33:26] it's self-serving this is the way that i
[33:28] want you to think about the bad pride
[33:31] we all know that one right
[33:33] but then there's also a pride that is
[33:34] reasonable
[33:36] there's a pride that is a justifiable
[33:38] self-respect there's a there's a pride
[33:40] which is akin to a self-esteem
[33:42] and in this way it's a pride that's very
[33:44] authentic you have the hubris but this
[33:45] is an authentic um idea of oneself and
[33:48] this this idea of pride is always
[33:50] coupled with humility
[33:53] as i've used the example before someone
[33:54] who's dirt poor and has nothing
[33:57] is not necessarily humble they're just
[33:59] broke
[34:00] right
[34:02] and you say well he lives very humbly
[34:03] yeah he's poor
[34:04] trust me if he had the money he would he
[34:06] would let you know
[34:08] and that's that's the difference some
[34:09] people are live humble lives because of
[34:12] poverty and because of their own
[34:14] arrogance and pride and if you gave them
[34:16] a lot of money they're going to be the
[34:17] first ones to let you know see what i
[34:18] got see i'm doing this i'm seeing i'm
[34:20] doing that but somebody who has the
[34:22] goods and has the money or has the power
[34:25] but it isn't always flaunting it and
[34:26] flashing it and showing it off those are
[34:28] the ones that have they have the power
[34:30] they have something to be proud of but
[34:32] it's coupled with humility
[34:35] and those are the ones it's the one
[34:36] who's always you know sticking his chest
[34:39] out and boasting and saying he's going
[34:40] to beat you up he's probably the one
[34:41] that can't
[34:43] but someone says hey man i don't want
[34:44] trouble and he's going to walk away let
[34:45] that guy walk away don't chase him down
[34:48] he can probably whip you
[34:50] because he's got power and he knows he
[34:52] can use it but he's got humility so it's
[34:55] not weakness that caused him to do it
[34:56] it's there's a certain pride in ability
[34:59] and so as paul says that one should not
[35:02] think of themselves more highly than he
[35:04] ought to think so we see we shouldn't
[35:06] think more of ourselves than we ought to
[35:08] but by the same token we should never
[35:10] think less of ourselves
[35:13] if you think well i can't think highly
[35:14] of myself so i'm just gonna think lowly
[35:16] of myself i'm gonna think poor of myself
[35:17] i'm just gonna think i'm a bad person i
[35:19] just think i'm i'm worthless i'm no good
[35:21] that's not what paul is advocating he's
[35:23] saying that we ought not to think of
[35:24] ourselves more highly than we ought to
[35:26] think more highly but by the same token
[35:29] we shouldn't think less than ourselves
[35:32] because he says that we ought to think
[35:34] soberly according to so think according
[35:36] to the measure of faith that he's dealt
[35:39] you
[35:40] so there's something that we think
[35:42] ourselves about is paul is talking about
[35:44] an arrogance or the wrong kind of pride
[35:46] you shouldn't be prideful and both have
[35:48] this empty v boast this vanity thinking
[35:50] of yourself to be more than you actually
[35:52] are he's saying but rather on the other
[35:54] hand think of yourself to the measure
[35:57] that god has blessed you or gifted you
[35:59] or the measure that god thinks of you
[36:02] we ought to think of ourselves and see
[36:03] ourselves as god sees us
[36:05] and that could be a consistent constant
[36:07] prayer lord i want to see myself as you
[36:09] see me i want to think of myself as you
[36:10] think of me and one thing that i pray is
[36:12] god help me to see your people as you
[36:15] see them help me to see this brother and
[36:17] that sister as you see him not as i'm
[36:18] seeing him not as i'm processing it not
[36:20] through my paradigms or through my uh my
[36:23] filter and my offenses or whatever i'm
[36:25] going through and my experiences lord i
[36:27] want to see them as you see them
[36:31] and so this is what we ought to do we
[36:32] ought to see ourselves according to the
[36:34] measure of faith that god has dealt us
[36:36] and any measure of faith should be
[36:38] valued
[36:40] whatever measure it's at it ought to be
[36:42] valued we should any measure of faith
[36:44] should never be devalued or diminished
[36:46] or cast aside but it should be
[36:47] appreciated it should be respected it
[36:49] should be promoted
[36:51] so god's given you a measure of faith
[36:53] and you ought to you ought to if i could
[36:54] put it as i take pride in it
[36:57] in galatians chapter 6 verses 1 to 10
[37:00] follow me as we read through this
[37:01] brethren if a man be overtaken in a
[37:03] fault you which are spiritual restore
[37:05] such a one and the spirit of meekness
[37:07] considering thyself lest thou also be
[37:10] tempted
[37:11] i know a lot of us have been in
[37:12] situations before where we were we were
[37:14] accused of false or maybe we were
[37:16] overtaken in a fault but no one ever
[37:18] restored us
[37:20] why because they have to be spiritual
[37:22] and they have to do it in the spirit of
[37:23] meekness
[37:24] so here's one that would recognize one
[37:27] is fallen they're overtaken in a fault
[37:30] deem themselves to be spiritual but yet
[37:32] do it in a spirit of weakness
[37:34] with this humility to realize i could be
[37:36] subject to the same thing but for the
[37:38] grace of god
[37:39] so there's something very interesting
[37:41] about the paul the one that paul's
[37:42] trying to provoke provoke into this
[37:44] restoration you have to be spiritual but
[37:47] you got to do it with meekness thinking
[37:49] of yourselves that you could also be
[37:50] tempted so he says in verse two bear ye
[37:53] one another's burdens and so fulfill the
[37:55] law of christ i'm just gonna keep
[37:57] reading through this and then back up a
[37:58] little bit once we get to verse five for
[38:00] if a man thinks himself to be something
[38:03] when he is nothing he deceiveth himself
[38:05] the phrase could be for if a man thinks
[38:07] himself to be something when he is not
[38:09] that thing
[38:11] uh so he's not saying that uh you have
[38:13] to be you think yourself to be something
[38:15] but you're actually nothing because that
[38:16] means you're nothing and you think
[38:18] yourself to be something then we would i
[38:20] can't we'd put ourselves in position
[38:21] well i can't think myself to be
[38:22] something because we're all nothing so
[38:23] i'm just gonna think i'm all nothing
[38:25] it's not what he's saying when you think
[38:26] yourself to be something but you're not
[38:28] that thing he says he deceives himself
[38:31] that that's the bad pride that's the
[38:33] arrogance that's the empty boast if a
[38:35] man thinks himself to be one thing or
[38:36] something when he is not that thing he
[38:38] deceives himself
[38:39] but let every man prove his own work
[38:43] then shall he have rejoicing in himself
[38:46] alone and not another
[38:47] for every man shall bear his own burden
[38:52] if i can say this barriers and
[38:53] boundaries are about recognizing
[38:56] another's burden according to verse two
[38:57] and your own burden according to verse
[38:59] 5.
[39:00] and that interesting
[39:02] bear ye one another's burdens but then
[39:03] we're told every man shall bear his own
[39:05] burden we might think well that doesn't
[39:06] make sense if every man bears his own
[39:08] then i won't have to bear somebody
[39:10] else's
[39:11] but we've dealt with this before
[39:13] uh it might have been about just about a
[39:15] year ago i think it might have been who
[39:16] is my neighbor where we talked about
[39:18] this
[39:19] when it says
[39:21] bear ye one another's burdens it's a
[39:23] different word that's used in verse five
[39:24] that's used in verse five and it speaks
[39:26] of a heaviness
[39:27] a weight or trouble
[39:29] it conveys the idea of someone's being
[39:31] brought down they're sinking
[39:33] so it says
[39:35] bear ye one another's burdens
[39:37] bear somebody help somebody with a thing
[39:39] that's hindering them
[39:41] help somebody with their barriers
[39:43] help somebody with their obstacle
[39:45] help somebody that's bringing somebody
[39:46] down but when it says barrier every man
[39:48] shall bear his own burden it's in the
[39:50] sense of loading something up placing
[39:52] something on somebody but it speaks of
[39:53] their own obligation like a ship
[39:55] carrying its own weight you fill it up
[39:57] and when you fill up the ship with the
[39:59] weight that it's intended to carry well
[40:00] guess what happens it floats
[40:03] right because it's laiding down that's
[40:05] what it's made for it's a vessel to do
[40:06] it it's speaking about fulfilling your
[40:08] own responsibility what does that talk
[40:09] about boundaries
[40:11] so on one hand you have the barriers
[40:13] that someone is trying to navigate and
[40:14] dealing with or it's a barrier that's
[40:16] bringing somebody down it's just burying
[40:17] one another's burden something that's
[40:19] bringing something down but you've got
[40:21] to carry your own weight
[40:24] you've got to bear your own so paul in
[40:26] verse 2 says bear you one another's
[40:28] burdens conveying a different image and
[40:30] also let every man bear his own burden
[40:32] and paul ties these two together by
[40:34] addressing a bad pride and a good pride
[40:39] he's like how convenient that those are
[40:40] the the what he's doing well that's what
[40:42] i'm preaching about i wanna preach on a
[40:44] good pride this is a good place to use
[40:45] this and examine this he ties these two
[40:48] verses together by looking at this a bad
[40:50] pride and a good pride because he says
[40:52] let every man prove his own work let
[40:55] every man prove his own work let him
[40:57] test his own work examine his own work
[41:00] scrutinize his own work to ultimately
[41:02] approve of his own work
[41:05] let every man prove his own work in
[41:07] other words let him approve of it let
[41:09] him demon worthy
[41:11] so you look at your job and says i'm
[41:13] doing a good job i'm doing a worthy job
[41:16] this is a benefit this is worthy this is
[41:19] awesome this is great this is good let
[41:20] every man test and examine his own work
[41:22] and be like
[41:24] you're doing a good job aaron you're
[41:25] doing a good job that's exactly what
[41:27] he's saying
[41:28] i'm talking to myself you could say it
[41:30] to yourself you're doing a good job
[41:31] brother sir you'll pat yourself on the
[41:32] back look in the mirror i'm doing a good
[41:34] job right that's what he's saying let
[41:36] every man prove his own work so that he
[41:37] can have rejoicing in himself you know
[41:39] the word rejoicing is translated to
[41:41] boast
[41:42] so he can bolsten himself so he can
[41:44] glory in himself do do he says
[41:47] deem your work worthy to boast in its
[41:50] fruits
[41:52] do you approve your own work bring forth
[41:55] good fruits be proud of your job
[41:57] and when you bring forth things that are
[41:58] productive and fruitful you should have
[42:00] rejoice in it and boast in it what is he
[42:03] talking about a good pride
[42:05] he's someone looking at what you're
[42:06] called to do doing what you're
[42:08] supposed to do doing it well and when
[42:09] you're done take a step back and say
[42:11] that's a good job it's a worthy job i've
[42:13] done a good job so you enjoy in doing
[42:15] your part rejoice in doing your job and
[42:17] it's using a word to say boast or glory
[42:20] in yourself
[42:22] this is a good pride
[42:24] all right you're still not quite willing
[42:26] to a man good pride or perfect pride
[42:29] i get some real
[42:30] real energetic amens when i say bad
[42:33] pride
[42:34] i want there to be some real light
[42:36] and free amen to good pride
[42:39] a good pride is when you glory in the
[42:41] right things you trust in the right
[42:43] things you're taking pride in the right
[42:46] things
[42:47] hey hey i'm proud of this message
[42:50] i'm not ashamed of it i'm not ashamed of
[42:52] christ i will boast in christ i will
[42:54] glory in the word of god so there is a
[42:56] there's a good praise there's a good
[42:58] glory there's a good as a good thing
[43:00] good way to think positively and think
[43:02] good of yourself
[43:04] there's a phrase that uh i think it was
[43:06] in um
[43:08] the sister elizabeth's parents home in
[43:10] her home that said uh positive people
[43:12] don't put others down
[43:15] and and i modified it to say uh positive
[43:18] people don't put themselves down either
[43:20] because you can be positive by everybody
[43:22] else and
[43:23] tear yourself down and that's that's not
[43:25] that's not necessarily true humility
[43:29] but when it comes to bad pride because i
[43:32] want you to recognize what paul is
[43:33] saying he's talking about working
[43:35] and bear your own
[43:37] bear your own burden prove your own work
[43:39] so that as you work and you bury your
[43:41] burden by the fruits of your labor you
[43:43] can boast in what you've done and you
[43:44] can be proud of what you've accomplished
[43:47] but on the other hand
[43:50] he says if a man thinks himself to be
[43:51] something when he's nothing he deceiveth
[43:52] himself
[43:54] because a bad pride values immediate
[43:56] pleasure
[43:58] the the sense of self the entitlement
[44:00] those things that it's looking
[44:02] to immediate gratification whereas good
[44:04] pride values the future outcomes
[44:08] it's taking pride in hardware it's
[44:09] taking pride in certain things it values
[44:11] the future outcome and it's a certain
[44:13] sense of worth and value that gives you
[44:15] the ability to delay gratification
[44:19] again think very
[44:20] i'm just want to throw certain things
[44:22] out there and i'm wanting to catch a
[44:24] hold of your spirit because these are
[44:25] very deep principles and i need you to
[44:26] i'm hoping that you're concentrating
[44:28] that when you when you need to be
[44:30] immediately gratified it's pride that's
[44:32] needed to be told pride this need to be
[44:34] lifted up it's the self that's need to
[44:35] be sensitized to made to be feel better
[44:37] about yourself and it's the bad pride
[44:39] that's going to get you in trouble to
[44:40] immediately gratify yourself but when
[44:42] you have the right respect for yourself
[44:44] and pride in yourself and your callings
[44:46] your ability and what god's made you
[44:48] then you're willing to delay
[44:50] gratification for a future benefit
[44:53] and it's related to something within
[44:54] character maybe you'll touch on it here
[44:56] in a moment about this tenacity and
[44:58] resilience so paul continues
[45:01] in verse six let him that is taught in
[45:03] the word communicate unto him that
[45:05] teacheth in all good things
[45:07] uh you could say that relates to saying
[45:09] a man's in service but it's actually
[45:10] saying to communities to give back to
[45:12] give of your resource to to to so too
[45:16] communicate to him that is teaching if
[45:18] there's one that's teaching the word of
[45:19] god you could even use this in the
[45:21] context of tithes and offerings then you
[45:23] want to give back to him
[45:25] you ought to give it's a very beautiful
[45:27] scripture if you're being faithfully
[45:29] taught you're being taught in good
[45:30] things you ought to communicate back and
[45:32] give back so he says continue on that
[45:34] principle be not deceived god is not
[45:36] mocked for whatsoever a man soweth thou
[45:39] shall he also reap
[45:41] principles of labor what you sow what
[45:43] you reap the fruits coming forth he that
[45:45] sowed to his flesh of the flesh reaped
[45:46] corruption but he that sowed to the
[45:48] spirit of the spirit reap life
[45:50] everlasting
[45:51] and let us not be weary in well-doing
[45:55] for in due season we shall reap if we
[45:57] faint not
[45:58] as we have therefore opportunity let us
[46:01] do good unto all men
[46:04] regardless of political spectrum right
[46:07] regardless of any spectrum ideology let
[46:09] us do good unto all men you're not going
[46:11] to find a scripture that says if you
[46:12] hate them with the perfect hatred you
[46:14] can do bad things to them
[46:20] let us do good unto all men especially
[46:22] unto them who are of the household of
[46:23] faith
[46:26] such beautiful scriptures i hate to
[46:27] really
[46:28] move beyond
[46:30] uh
[46:31] several of these verses but i want to
[46:33] focus on verse 9 be not weary and faint
[46:35] not
[46:37] don't get exhausted or don't relax
[46:40] don't be discouraged
[46:42] he he's speaking to a characteristic
[46:45] some sort of mindset where i'm willing
[46:47] to endure i i want to keep going on in
[46:50] this don't get exhausted don't relax
[46:52] don't be discouraged paul if i can put
[46:54] this kind of lifting up grit a
[46:55] determination
[46:57] he's somewhat being resilient somebody's
[46:59] gonna say i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm just
[47:00] gonna stick this out
[47:02] because i know it's worth it i'm gonna
[47:04] do good because i know it's the right
[47:05] thing i'm gonna continue in this he's
[47:07] saying don't give up don't quit that's
[47:09] exactly what paul is saying
[47:11] whatever you do don't quit when you're
[47:13] doing good keep doing good because it's
[47:15] worth doing good keep doing good because
[47:17] it's right to do good don't ever get
[47:18] exhausted relax or be weary in doing
[47:21] well because you're going to reap
[47:23] because if you're doing good you're
[47:24] sowing the right things and you're going
[47:26] to reap the right things so you're go
[47:28] you'll finally ultimately get the
[47:30] benefit and the blessing from all the
[47:32] positive labor as long as you don't stop
[47:34] if you don't quit
[47:37] and so this is the this is the uh that's
[47:39] the principle paul's lifting up and he's
[47:41] lifting up perseverance
[47:43] to persevere it means to persist
[47:46] in what one has to undertake and to
[47:48] pursue steadily of course
[47:51] to be persistent which means to continue
[47:53] despite opposition
[47:55] i'm going to keep doing this regardless
[47:56] of the barriers
[47:58] i'm going to keep doing this because i
[47:59] know it's right
[48:00] it's a determination
[48:02] why are you doing it because it's the
[48:03] right thing how do you know it's the
[48:05] right thing it produces the right
[48:06] results
[48:08] well there's all these obstacles it's
[48:10] very very hard but i got to do it
[48:12] this is coming against me one of the
[48:14] best things i'm starting to realize with
[48:15] my own children is i want them to be
[48:17] resilient
[48:18] i want to raise them in a bubble where
[48:20] they always win and everything always
[48:22] goes their way and i'm always
[48:23] intervening for them and always bail
[48:25] them out of trouble i don't mind if they
[48:26] experience pain experience hurt and
[48:28] experience difficulties and things don't
[48:29] go their way i want to be able to teach
[48:31] them that when things don't go their way
[48:33] that they still have to persevere they
[48:35] still have to do the right thing that
[48:36] they become resilient and they don't
[48:38] always quit they don't always give up
[48:39] right boys
[48:41] even if your brother's cheating even if
[48:43] the score is getting out of control
[48:44] you're playing you persevere you stay in
[48:46] it you don't accuse other people of
[48:48] cheating you don't have a bad attitude
[48:49] what that's resilience that's grit
[48:52] it's sticking something out it's getting
[48:54] the job done if you started it's
[48:55] completing it paul is using the very
[48:57] same principle here he's saying hey if
[48:59] you're doing the right thing keep doing
[49:01] it if you're doing the wrong thing stop
[49:04] i said no brilliant you told me to be
[49:05] determined do you tell me to not quit
[49:06] i'm just going to use grit and keep
[49:08] doing the wrong thing no
[49:09] in the right thing
[49:11] so brother banh talks about it and this
[49:13] is where my inspiration was and i
[49:15] mentioned it before i don't know if i
[49:16] mentioned it but god just supernaturally
[49:18] brought the thought humble thyself and
[49:20] perseverance together
[49:22] and such a beautiful picture when we
[49:23] were studying on practice i'm so
[49:25] profound to me i've been studying on
[49:27] these things now for well over a month
[49:29] but in perseverance brother brown says
[49:30] the word perseverance means to be
[49:32] persistent
[49:33] webster says that it's persistent in
[49:35] making a goal
[49:37] trying to do something and being
[49:38] persistent about it you become
[49:39] perseverant
[49:41] trying to do
[49:42] something i says men of all ages who
[49:45] have faith in what they're trying to
[49:48] achieve have been persist perseverant
[49:50] you must have faith in what you were
[49:52] doing
[49:53] so men throughout all history who had
[49:55] faith in what they were trying to
[49:56] achieve were perseverant
[49:59] now think about that
[50:01] trying to accomplish something
[50:03] believing they can do it
[50:04] wanting to do it and then persevering to
[50:07] achieve it so he says you must have
[50:09] faith in what you're doing and the
[50:10] message perseverance that was
[50:12] perseverant this is perseverance and
[50:14] every person on earth or that's ever
[50:16] been on earth that's ever achieved
[50:17] anything though amounted to anything so
[50:19] you're talking about good positive this
[50:21] is good this is great this is something
[50:22] worth bragging about or putting on your
[50:24] resume or writing home about had to be
[50:27] perseverant
[50:29] you've got to be sure first what you got
[50:31] your faith anchored in
[50:34] so this persistence this perseverance to
[50:36] be perseverant or to persevere or to
[50:39] persist he's talking about the
[50:40] confidence
[50:42] any man who's ever accomplished anything
[50:43] if we're going to accomplish anything to
[50:45] achieve anything he says you've got to
[50:46] set a goal say this i believe
[50:49] in other words i want to climb mount
[50:51] everest i believe i can climb out
[50:53] everest if you set a goal to climb a
[50:55] mountain but you don't believe you're
[50:56] gonna climb it you're probably what
[50:58] not gonna climb it
[51:00] right it's just not gonna happen
[51:02] so to persevere to persist requires some
[51:05] level of confidence
[51:06] you see where i'm going with this
[51:09] if you're going to set a goal and you're
[51:10] going to achieve it if you're going to
[51:11] persevere if you're going to persist if
[51:13] there's a mark of perfection whatever it
[51:15] might be that you feel that you ought to
[51:16] be doing or something you're called to
[51:17] do something you desire to do in this
[51:19] mind he says let us not be weary and
[51:21] well-doing
[51:23] and to persevere and to persist in order
[51:25] to do that there has to be some
[51:27] self-esteem in some belief even if it's
[51:30] audacity
[51:32] to do it that you can do it
[51:35] anybody who's ever done something
[51:38] he's saying had to believe that they
[51:40] could do it
[51:42] even despite all the pieces you're going
[51:44] to fall flat on your face you can't do
[51:45] that why are you even trying that's
[51:47] impossible that'll never be restored
[51:49] that'll never work out you could never
[51:50] get that job you can never do this you
[51:52] could never i remember people tell me
[51:54] you're going to start a church in the
[51:55] middle of a pandemic and i'm like
[51:57] yeah i didn't think about that yeah i'm
[51:59] starting a church in the middle of
[51:59] pandemic
[52:01] it's easier to spread seven people out
[52:03] than it is 70.
[52:06] and so that there's all these people
[52:08] saying you can't do it you can't do it
[52:10] you can't do it and there's always these
[52:11] ideas and people but when somebody is if
[52:14] they're ever going to do it they have to
[52:15] believe they despite everyone else's
[52:17] opinion believe that they can do it and
[52:19] guess what some of us might call that
[52:20] he's being arrogant
[52:23] but it's just belief it's confidence
[52:26] it's some self-esteem
[52:28] and what happens when we quit or we give
[52:30] up we lose heart when we despair of the
[52:32] outcome
[52:34] people quit when they think they can't
[52:36] make up the difference in a score
[52:38] right well we can't i can't come back
[52:40] and win anyways but who is it that keeps
[52:42] playing it's the one that says well if
[52:43] they got up by 30 of us in the first
[52:44] half can't we do the same thing to them
[52:46] in the second half like they did it in
[52:48] the first quarter can't we do in the
[52:49] second quarter and that's someone who
[52:50] believes it's always within reach
[52:52] this is something that i can do we lose
[52:55] heart when we think well we can't do it
[52:57] so what there is a doggedness there is a
[52:59] determination there is a tenacity when
[53:02] it comes to faith
[53:04] there's a persistence there's a
[53:05] perseverance if someone's going to
[53:07] persevere and keep doing something on
[53:09] some in some way they actually have to
[53:11] have pride or belief enough that they're
[53:13] going to do it otherwise you're not
[53:15] going to keep doing it
[53:16] why do you keep hitting up against that
[53:18] barrier why do you keep hitting up
[53:19] against that barrier because i can
[53:21] believe i can get through it
[53:23] oh wow you really think you can i
[53:24] believe i can i believe i can get
[53:25] through this and so there has to be some
[53:27] kind of belief
[53:29] it's a good pride
[53:32] it's a healthy way of thinking
[53:34] and there's a there's so many things i'd
[53:36] love to just begin to expound upon in
[53:39] this area
[53:40] because this is something that even you
[53:42] don't even have to go to the word of god
[53:43] to find it the word of god is the first
[53:45] that establishes it and it spawns upon
[53:46] it and blesses it makes it fruitful but
[53:48] then the academics are looking at
[53:50] certain things and identifying human
[53:51] nature and they're realizing that there
[53:53] has to be some level of good pride
[53:55] joined with humility in order for a
[53:56] person to be to
[53:58] accomplish something
[54:00] and they're finding this and i think
[54:02] even the word of god speaks to it that
[54:05] the right kind of praise will encourage
[54:07] the right kind of pride
[54:10] that's why you'll find the word of god
[54:12] encouraging us in certain things in
[54:13] certain ways
[54:15] and admonishing us and lifting us up and
[54:17] it's the whole new testament is you're
[54:18] all a bunch of sinners that need grace
[54:21] right it's not just always saying that
[54:23] remember you're a dirty foul person that
[54:24] christ loves we're not always reminded
[54:26] of that and remember that when you
[54:28] listen to some of the modern christian
[54:29] music today that is solely focused on
[54:31] just how nasty and bad people are
[54:33] feeling at 2 am after they vaped all
[54:36] night
[54:36] right i just feel so broken and i messed
[54:39] up again and but jesus you love behold
[54:42] be tired again and it's this all real
[54:44] dark lyrics and we want to be very we
[54:46] want to come to the point in our lives
[54:47] was like you know what i don't relate to
[54:48] that anymore
[54:50] i i've been rescued from that yeah there
[54:53] was a time in my life when that was the
[54:54] cycle but what are they there's a
[54:56] certain way that they're promoting
[54:58] certain things that kind of fits this
[55:00] paradigm of christ's love that isn't
[55:01] true because christ love can redeem you
[55:04] from that cycle and so there's a way
[55:06] that the word of god encourages us and
[55:08] admonishes us to not always be the
[55:11] broken sinner that jesus like ah again
[55:13] come here who needs a hug no there's a
[55:15] point where he's wanting you to come out
[55:17] of that cycle and lift you up and
[55:19] encourage you and bring to a place of
[55:21] confidence say i'm standing on my own
[55:22] two feet by the grace of god
[55:25] and so there's a right kind of praise
[55:27] that's going to encourage the right kind
[55:29] of pride and this extends even to human
[55:32] relationships to where when you're
[55:33] raising your children praise them for
[55:35] their effort
[55:36] praise them for their hard work praise
[55:38] them for not giving up praising them for
[55:40] persisting in difficult situations when
[55:42] they do something and they said wow
[55:44] that's beautiful you really tried hard
[55:46] you really did you worked on that for a
[55:48] long time they they accomplished a very
[55:50] difficult problem don't say you're smart
[55:54] it's the wrong kind of praise
[55:56] to speak to the wrong kind the wrong
[55:58] pride
[56:00] when you praise the right way good pride
[56:03] is instigated
[56:05] but the wrong praise encourages the
[56:06] wrong pride
[56:08] i found that if you constantly tell your
[56:10] children that they're smart
[56:12] what happens i'll put it in the
[56:13] terminology i'm using today it
[56:15] instigates the bad pride
[56:18] and bad pride
[56:19] is all about self-preservation
[56:22] it's all about self
[56:23] so actually the more you tell a child
[56:25] that they're smart the less
[56:28] they're going to take risk being proved
[56:29] that they're not
[56:32] and a bad pride is always going to feed
[56:33] a fear of failure
[56:36] you think you're being humble because
[56:37] you're afraid you're going to fail no
[56:38] that's the pride
[56:39] that does that
[56:41] you realize it's pride that keeps you
[56:42] from letting somebody else do something
[56:44] for you you think you're just being
[56:45] humble oh no no no no it's your pride
[56:48] you don't want to humble yourself let
[56:49] somebody do something for you
[56:51] you never let anybody ever do anything
[56:53] for you and you think you're being
[56:53] humble it's your own pride think about
[56:55] it somebody i don't know who i'm talking
[56:57] to anybody don't raise a hand
[56:59] you might need to go home today and
[57:01] think about it you it's you we're here
[57:03] today for you
[57:07] the soups are ready
[57:09] come to the
[57:11] oh sometimes we need to take today think
[57:13] about it am i always saying no to
[57:16] someone's willingness to help not
[57:18] because i'm the humble one but because
[57:19] my pride won't let somebody else help me
[57:23] i'm open for help anybody want to help
[57:24] me i'm available
[57:29] it'll induce the wrong kind of
[57:31] instincts
[57:33] and it'll cause people to be reluctant
[57:34] to try
[57:36] they're not going to be gritty they're
[57:37] not going to be resilient they're not
[57:38] saying oh let me try that why because
[57:40] they don't want to do it and fail and be
[57:41] called a klutz or you're no good you're
[57:43] not athletic and you're horrible at this
[57:45] or why why did you fail and listen
[57:47] they've replicated this in studies and
[57:49] it's very very very profound where
[57:51] they're if you praise someone for their
[57:53] intelligence and then ask them if they
[57:55] want to try something harder they'll
[57:56] always say no
[57:59] they say no no no why because they don't
[58:00] want to do it harder and prove that
[58:02] they're not smart they just want to live
[58:03] in that that spot yes i'm smart but you
[58:06] take your kid and they try a very very
[58:08] difficult problem and they get it right
[58:10] you say wow it's amazing how hard you
[58:12] try like you really persevered and you
[58:14] took your time and you put in a lot of
[58:16] effort you want to try something harder
[58:18] you've praised them and now they take
[58:20] pride in their effort and you know what
[58:21] they're willing to try again
[58:24] and you don't induce this well i don't
[58:26] want to look ignorant i don't want to
[58:27] look uh i don't want to look foolish and
[58:29] so there's a way that someone is afraid
[58:31] to act because they don't want to look
[58:32] like they have faith
[58:34] think about it we're talking about
[58:35] spiritual we're not talking about how to
[58:36] raise your kids alone we're talking
[58:38] about things that have a spiritual
[58:39] application all these different ways
[58:41] that we have been pumped up and patted
[58:43] on the back and lifted ourselves up in a
[58:46] negative way have caused us to be more
[58:47] afraid of achieving things in the word
[58:49] of god and have become obstacles to
[58:51] spiritual growth and it's not true
[58:53] humility
[58:54] but god wants to break us out of some of
[58:56] these negative ways of thinking in these
[58:58] negative cycles and to take on the
[59:01] mantle of his righteousness and start to
[59:03] have a positive pride a perfect pride
[59:05] and a good pride that will let us see an
[59:07] obstacle say i can overcome that by the
[59:10] grace of god
[59:12] in mark chapter 10 verse 27 and jesus
[59:14] looking upon them saith with men it is
[59:16] impossible
[59:18] but not with god
[59:19] for with him with god all things are
[59:22] possible
[59:23] this is christ boasting about the
[59:25] boundless god recognizing the limits of
[59:27] man man cannot do the impossible but
[59:30] with god all things are possible
[59:33] why all things are possible with god who
[59:36] is unlimited in this power who is the
[59:38] absolute he's balls and about a
[59:39] boundless god so with god all things are
[59:43] possible because god can do all things
[59:46] but paul says in philippians 4 12 to 13
[59:49] i know both how to be a based it's very
[59:51] interesting
[59:53] it sounds like a really big boast to
[59:54] brag the humble brag of paul i know how
[59:56] to both to be based
[59:58] and i know how to abound
[1:00:00] and how to be humble and know how to be
[1:00:02] fruitful
[1:00:03] everywhere in all things i'm instructed
[1:00:05] both to be full and to be hungry both to
[1:00:07] abound and to suffer need
[1:00:09] i can do all things through christ with
[1:00:11] strength as me
[1:00:13] how many times has anybody here ever
[1:00:15] quoted this scripture
[1:00:16] this past week
[1:00:18] right we're always reminders i can do
[1:00:20] all things through christ that's
[1:00:21] strengthening i can do all things to
[1:00:22] christ that strength which strengthens
[1:00:24] me
[1:00:25] we should remind ourselves of that
[1:00:28] so with man there's limits there's
[1:00:30] limitations but with god there are none
[1:00:32] with god all things are possible then
[1:00:33] paul says i can do all things through
[1:00:35] christ which strengthens me
[1:00:38] and he says in the way of touching on
[1:00:39] paradoxes i know how to be a beast and
[1:00:41] how to abound and jesus said for
[1:00:43] whatsoever whosoever exalteth himself
[1:00:45] shall be a base luke 14 11 and he that
[1:00:47] humbleth themselves shall be exalted
[1:00:50] but yet there's this paradox of one who
[1:00:53] exalts himself and abounds himself and
[1:00:55] lifts himself up and glorifies himself
[1:00:57] he's going to be a base but he that
[1:00:59] humbles himself shall be exalted
[1:01:01] again it's touching on this self
[1:01:04] exaltation this empty boast this brag
[1:01:06] with no basis talk about the person
[1:01:08] who's always trying to prove something
[1:01:11] from a place of insecurity
[1:01:14] trying to make everyone think they've
[1:01:15] got a lot of money when they're broke
[1:01:17] trying to make everybody think that
[1:01:18] they've got a girlfriend when they don't
[1:01:20] try to make everybody think that they've
[1:01:21] got a gift when they don't try to make
[1:01:22] everybody think that they're they're
[1:01:24] happy and they're secure
[1:01:25] and they're strong and they're powerful
[1:01:27] when they're really not
[1:01:29] the one that's always trying to put
[1:01:30] themselves forward see me see what i can
[1:01:32] do see what i can accomplish he's
[1:01:34] talking about and challenging this
[1:01:36] notion of the bad kind of pride but then
[1:01:38] paul says i know how to abound because i
[1:01:41] can do all things through christ with
[1:01:42] strengthen me that's a confession that
[1:01:44] relates to a perfect pride
[1:01:48] we don't need to just be this
[1:01:49] impoverished dejected broken uh unable
[1:01:53] completely uh
[1:01:55] a mess basket case christians
[1:01:58] with no self-worth with no value
[1:02:00] whatsoever
[1:02:02] there's a there's there are spirits that
[1:02:04] thrive on the attention it gets when
[1:02:06] you're sick
[1:02:09] the attention you get when you're going
[1:02:11] through something the attention you get
[1:02:13] when things aren't going your way so
[1:02:14] some people like that right so oh this
[1:02:17] is horrible oh this is bad that's why
[1:02:19] sometimes you can some people i already
[1:02:21] told them yesterday my life was a part
[1:02:22] so how are you doing i'm doing great so
[1:02:23] you got to find somebody else to boohoo
[1:02:25] on
[1:02:29] come on eeyore
[1:02:36] well i really want to finish this where
[1:02:37] are we
[1:02:38] i'm running out of time
[1:02:40] so let's go back to romans chapter 12 in
[1:02:42] our minds
[1:02:44] not to think more highly than you ought
[1:02:45] to of yourself but to think soberly
[1:02:46] according to the measure of faith that
[1:02:48] god has dealt to every man
[1:02:50] don't think more highly or
[1:02:51] inappropriately
[1:02:53] of yourself
[1:02:55] but think of yourself within your
[1:02:56] measure
[1:02:58] and when paul's using the phrase measure
[1:03:00] in here the measure of faith
[1:03:02] and the different gifts met the
[1:03:04] different measures he's referred to it
[1:03:05] literally means the determined extent or
[1:03:08] portion the determined limit what is he
[1:03:10] defining a boundary
[1:03:12] think of yourself within your boundaries
[1:03:14] think of yourself within your abilities
[1:03:16] any thought that puts you outside of
[1:03:18] those boundaries is a barrier to meeting
[1:03:19] the potential that god wants you to have
[1:03:21] within it when you think of yourself to
[1:03:23] be more than you are or more something
[1:03:25] when you're not that something you
[1:03:26] deceive yourself
[1:03:29] be careful the one who thinks he
[1:03:30] standeth lest he fall
[1:03:32] there's this this self-deception oh i'm
[1:03:34] this i'm bad and it's this bulls this is
[1:03:36] emptiness but he's saying there is a
[1:03:37] measure if you think beyond that measure
[1:03:39] you're going to fail but if you think
[1:03:41] within that measure that's where you're
[1:03:42] going to reap positive things
[1:03:45] second corinthians chapter 10 i'm going
[1:03:46] to read verses 12 to 18. i've got to go
[1:03:48] fast now
[1:03:50] and we'll record it in like the half
[1:03:52] speed
[1:03:55] for we dare not make ourselves of the
[1:03:57] number or compare ourselves with some
[1:03:59] that commend themselves
[1:04:02] but they measuring themselves by
[1:04:04] themselves and comparing themselves
[1:04:06] among themselves are not wise they're
[1:04:08] using somebody else as their measuring
[1:04:10] line they're using somebody else's
[1:04:11] extent or limit to recognize their own
[1:04:15] as kind of like in a negotiation where
[1:04:16] you don't ever want to counter offer
[1:04:18] until the other person kind of gives
[1:04:19] their offer or you kind of wait you want
[1:04:20] to see where they're at well i can do
[1:04:22] that job for what's your budget
[1:04:24] right you want them to kind of set the
[1:04:25] limit to find out where your limits are
[1:04:27] going to be he said we ought to not
[1:04:29] measure ourselves by others but we will
[1:04:32] not
[1:04:32] boast of things without our measure
[1:04:37] but we will boast according to the
[1:04:39] measure of the rule which god has
[1:04:41] distributed to us a measure to reach
[1:04:43] even unto you now i know i inserted that
[1:04:45] in there but that's exactly what paul is
[1:04:47] saying but we will not bolster things
[1:04:48] without our measure but according to the
[1:04:50] measure of the rule which god has
[1:04:51] distributed us a measure to reach even
[1:04:53] unto you do you realize he's saying i
[1:04:55] won't boast beyond measure but i'll
[1:04:57] boast within my measure
[1:04:59] for we stretch out ourselves beyond our
[1:05:00] measure as though we reach not unto you
[1:05:03] for we stretch not ourselves beyond our
[1:05:05] measure as though we reached not unto
[1:05:08] you for we are come as far as to you
[1:05:10] also in preaching the gospel of christ
[1:05:12] not bolster things without our measure
[1:05:15] that is of another man's labors but
[1:05:18] having hope this is a confidence when
[1:05:20] your faith is increased that we shall be
[1:05:22] enlarged by you according to our rule
[1:05:25] abundantly this is this is a brag too
[1:05:28] to preach the gospel in the regions
[1:05:30] beyond you and not to boast in another
[1:05:32] man's line of things made ready to our
[1:05:35] hand
[1:05:36] but he that glorieth lent him glory in
[1:05:38] the lord so you can glory but glory in
[1:05:40] the lord for not he that commendeth
[1:05:42] himself
[1:05:44] is approved but whom the lord commendeth
[1:05:46] the word commanded there means placed
[1:05:48] together combined
[1:05:49] is to establish it speaks of a
[1:05:51] composition or combination so you
[1:05:53] realize there's some godly combination
[1:05:55] that i'm boasting in
[1:05:58] i'm not commending myself i'm not
[1:06:00] approved because i'm commending myself
[1:06:01] but the lord has done this the lord has
[1:06:03] combined this the lord has arranged this
[1:06:06] and paul talks about rule you're talking
[1:06:07] about measure rule uses the rule and the
[1:06:10] line this word rule and line are the
[1:06:12] same word it means a defined boundary or
[1:06:15] fixed space within the limits of one's
[1:06:17] power or influence to which it's
[1:06:18] confined
[1:06:20] paul's saying i'm given boundaries i'm
[1:06:21] giving borders i have a fixed space
[1:06:23] within which are within the limits in
[1:06:25] which my power is confined and i will
[1:06:27] boast and glory in this measure that god
[1:06:30] has given me and i won't go beyond that
[1:06:33] he says i won't go beyond another man's
[1:06:36] line of things it speaks of a place
[1:06:38] where one is a one sphere of activity
[1:06:41] the province assigned to a person he
[1:06:43] says i've been given a job you've been
[1:06:45] given a job i'll respect the boundaries
[1:06:47] between our job i won't boast in glory
[1:06:49] in your work i will boast in glory in
[1:06:51] mind and i won't cross into another
[1:06:53] man's boundary
[1:06:54] paul has respect for another man's
[1:06:56] boundary that's humility to respect
[1:06:58] another man's boundary to respect
[1:07:00] another man's work and to even commend
[1:07:02] him for that work but he also took pride
[1:07:04] in his own
[1:07:05] and wasn't going to devalue his work
[1:07:07] based upon the work that somebody else
[1:07:08] was doing said oh my isn't there is
[1:07:10] wonderful i really wish i could have
[1:07:12] that work no he says i've got mine to do
[1:07:14] and i'll glory in my work you've got
[1:07:15] yours to do you glory and yours and i
[1:07:17] won't interfere with yours
[1:07:19] because what he said those that measure
[1:07:21] themselves by themselves and compare
[1:07:22] themselves among themselves are not wise
[1:07:27] i was studying the phrase i've studied
[1:07:28] it before it was brought back to my
[1:07:30] remembrance this measuring themselves by
[1:07:31] themselves
[1:07:34] you have to know who you are by knowing
[1:07:37] your boundaries and what god's called
[1:07:39] you to be
[1:07:41] and your boundaries are your own they're
[1:07:43] not set by others
[1:07:46] we're not establishing what we're
[1:07:48] comfortable with by first finding out
[1:07:50] what you're comfortable with
[1:07:53] well how far can i push it how far will
[1:07:55] you let me go or how far are you going
[1:07:57] to push me
[1:07:58] when will you stop and then once the
[1:07:59] stop they stop pushing you set your
[1:08:01] boundary no
[1:08:03] you don't measure who you are by
[1:08:05] somebody else's measure
[1:08:07] you don't do it
[1:08:09] you measure yourself according to the
[1:08:11] line or the rule that god has given you
[1:08:15] paul had respect for these boundaries
[1:08:17] and then he's recognizing that other
[1:08:18] people measure themselves by themselves
[1:08:20] they're comparing themselves they're
[1:08:22] using what limit this person goes to to
[1:08:25] set their limits or how far this person
[1:08:27] will go to withdraw their boundary
[1:08:29] and if you're always comparing your work
[1:08:32] and worst of all your worth by another
[1:08:34] man's worth or another man's work you're
[1:08:36] always going to fail
[1:08:39] even if you're finding the person who's
[1:08:41] worth the least and does the worst job
[1:08:43] if you're always comparing yourself by
[1:08:45] somebody else's work or worth you're
[1:08:47] always worse off even if you chose
[1:08:49] someone you compared yourself with to
[1:08:51] make yourself feel better
[1:08:53] well you see how that person raises
[1:08:55] their kids makes me feel better about
[1:08:56] mine you see how much that person goes
[1:08:58] to church makes me feel good about how
[1:08:59] much i go you say you remember you see
[1:09:01] how much that person ties or how much
[1:09:02] person that person gives and what this
[1:09:04] person does and that person does even if
[1:09:06] you come out on top in that competition
[1:09:07] you always fail
[1:09:10] all right
[1:09:11] you might as well just admit it
[1:09:13] we we are losing whenever we do that
[1:09:17] and so it's not by you can't you cannot
[1:09:20] gain the confidence that christ wants
[1:09:21] you to have by comparison
[1:09:24] by looking at what other people are
[1:09:26] doing and whether or not they do it well
[1:09:28] because if we do that maybe we we have
[1:09:30] the kind of heart where we're not
[1:09:31] comparing ourselves to people who do
[1:09:32] worse than us we're always comparing
[1:09:34] ourselves to people who do
[1:09:36] better than us and again you do that and
[1:09:39] you will fail
[1:09:41] not because they are better but you're
[1:09:42] using the wrong measuring stick you're
[1:09:44] going beyond the measure you're not even
[1:09:46] recognizing what your boundaries are and
[1:09:49] what god's called you to do
[1:09:52] your value your worth who you are is
[1:09:54] measured by the boundaries that god has
[1:09:56] placed in your life and you it's a
[1:09:58] matter of respecting who god made you
[1:10:00] and not trying to be somebody else and
[1:10:02] then also respecting what god has made
[1:10:04] others
[1:10:05] do you realize you might be diligent in
[1:10:07] certain things gifted in certain things
[1:10:09] and have certain be thoughtful in
[1:10:10] certain things and you're always trying
[1:10:11] to pull other people into your way of
[1:10:13] seeing things and well they don't do
[1:10:15] this and they don't do that do what
[1:10:17] you're supposed to do and stop judging
[1:10:19] them by what you're supposed to do
[1:10:23] they may not be called to that they may
[1:10:25] not be gifted that
[1:10:28] way that's the pride paradox
[1:10:32] pride's both the
[1:10:33] boundary and the barrier
[1:10:36] pride is only destructive when it goes
[1:10:38] beyond its proper boundaries
[1:10:41] the bad pride that we're talking about
[1:10:43] exist only outside the borders of truth
[1:10:48] if you're a good cook and you think
[1:10:50] you're a good cook that's not a bad
[1:10:51] pride
[1:10:53] if you are a good cook
[1:10:55] right
[1:10:56] it exists within the boundaries of truth
[1:10:59] and justification
[1:11:00] bad pride is impulsive
[1:11:03] it's self-protective it only seeks to
[1:11:04] promote the self
[1:11:11] pride in the sense of self-exaltation in
[1:11:14] the sense of
[1:11:15] self-sufficiency is wrong
[1:11:17] right
[1:11:20] but think about a pride
[1:11:22] in the sense of our sufficiency in
[1:11:24] christ
[1:11:25] i can do all things through christ
[1:11:27] that's not wrong
[1:11:29] but that kind of pride is necessary
[1:11:33] bad pride will
[1:11:35] ignore another person's boundaries
[1:11:38] or disrespect another person's
[1:11:39] boundaries and maybe worst of all ignore
[1:11:41] your own
[1:11:44] it's a lack of good pride that keeps us
[1:11:46] from setting boundaries it's a lack of
[1:11:48] good pride that keeps us from enforcing
[1:11:51] our proper boundaries are you thinking
[1:11:53] about that i think maybe i'm ending on a
[1:11:55] lot
[1:11:56] for you to ponder and think about
[1:11:58] but if you have the wrong kind of pride
[1:12:00] you won't respect other people's
[1:12:01] boundaries
[1:12:03] because you have some sense of
[1:12:04] entitlement you feel like you have the
[1:12:06] right the audacity sometimes for people
[1:12:08] to ask the questions they ask right like
[1:12:11] well i'm just thinking about myself
[1:12:13] i'm going back think about the things i
[1:12:15] thought i had a right to know in the way
[1:12:16] i treated people what was it pride
[1:12:20] they don't owe you that information
[1:12:23] they're not accountable to you
[1:12:25] so then why do you make it your concern
[1:12:28] it's pride that does it
[1:12:30] a sense of entitlement you owe this to
[1:12:32] me
[1:12:33] and so it's that bad pride that'll cause
[1:12:35] us to disrespect another person's
[1:12:37] boundaries but then there's this
[1:12:38] negative side to that bad pride to where
[1:12:40] also you if you could be burdened in
[1:12:42] such a way where the wrong kind of pride
[1:12:44] keeps you from establishing and
[1:12:46] recognizing your own or ignores your own
[1:12:50] but if we can have the right kind of
[1:12:52] pride we'll know to set the boundary
[1:12:54] and we'll know how to respect them
[1:12:58] we know how to overcome barriers
[1:13:01] because with the bad pride you'll push
[1:13:02] beyond boundaries
[1:13:05] i wanted to use it as an example i guess
[1:13:06] i will now try maybe trying to hold
[1:13:08] whether or not we'll pick this up on
[1:13:10] wednesday night
[1:13:12] but
[1:13:15] when the king wanted to offer burn
[1:13:16] incense
[1:13:17] he was met with the word of god
[1:13:19] and the men of god established a
[1:13:21] boundary
[1:13:22] and his pride caused him to push right
[1:13:24] past it
[1:13:27] musicians if he could come we'll close
[1:13:30] i still want to read a couple of
[1:13:32] quotations that i had
[1:13:34] i'd like to end with
[1:13:44] in the message makaya the prophet
[1:13:47] and this might seem to be
[1:13:50] a step out of our subject matter but to
[1:13:52] me it just fits right on top of this so
[1:13:53] perfectly it says you know the other
[1:13:55] night i said that christ is a glow not a
[1:13:57] glare
[1:13:59] we will never be able to convert the
[1:14:00] world by trying to shine up our churches
[1:14:02] and make them bigger
[1:14:04] and polish up our ministers with better
[1:14:06] education
[1:14:08] they already got all that stuff
[1:14:11] they got all kinds of psychology and
[1:14:12] ball games and everything
[1:14:14] the world's got that
[1:14:17] but we got something they haven't got
[1:14:18] that's christ
[1:14:21] i like that boast
[1:14:22] i like that we got something they ain't
[1:14:24] got
[1:14:26] he says it's christ that's right just
[1:14:29] stay in your own territory
[1:14:32] that's the part that spoke to me stay in
[1:14:34] your own territory
[1:14:35] a territory is marked by borders
[1:14:38] territory has defined boundaries
[1:14:41] the territory's something that's
[1:14:42] identifiable by certain structures and
[1:14:44] certain things that kind of place you
[1:14:46] within these parameters that's your
[1:14:48] territory that's your spot that's your
[1:14:50] lane just stay in your own territory
[1:14:55] it's yours
[1:14:57] it's only yours it's nobody else's
[1:15:00] take pride in it
[1:15:02] use it enjoy it get out of it what is
[1:15:05] meant for you in that he says we got
[1:15:07] christ they don't have christ they got
[1:15:09] all the psychology don't try to match
[1:15:10] with wits you can't do it they can
[1:15:12] outmatch you you go to a catholic priest
[1:15:14] one time and try to outmatch him with
[1:15:16] wits he's got 600 books just as sacred
[1:15:19] as this bible he's got to learn
[1:15:22] so brother don't ev don't never try to
[1:15:24] match him with wits i will tell you that
[1:15:27] but if you'll just stay with the holy
[1:15:29] spirit
[1:15:30] he will do the rest of it if you stay
[1:15:32] with that
[1:15:34] but we're not supposed to match wits
[1:15:36] we're supposed to have christ that's
[1:15:38] what we have we've got something that
[1:15:41] they haven't got
[1:15:44] now that puts it maybe in a real
[1:15:45] boastful place to say well the
[1:15:47] denominations the organizations these
[1:15:49] people
[1:15:50] they have their pump they have their big
[1:15:52] churches they have their ball games they
[1:15:53] have their programs they have their
[1:15:56] their coffee bars or whatever it might
[1:15:57] be to to draw the crowds uh even brother
[1:16:00] john was telling me that this one church
[1:16:02] they they have the screens on in the
[1:16:04] foyer to the football games so the
[1:16:06] fathers don't miss anything
[1:16:09] and you know
[1:16:10] i guess our church is no different
[1:16:15] we got the football game on in the
[1:16:17] restaurant that this church has
[1:16:19] some people enjoyed our rooms last night
[1:16:21] we appreciate you staying here at the
[1:16:22] church
[1:16:24] but they do it to get the fathers
[1:16:26] involved they get it to get people to
[1:16:27] come
[1:16:29] now listen
[1:16:31] we will
[1:16:32] i said if we even tried to compete
[1:16:36] with that
[1:16:37] in order to grow the church
[1:16:39] you'll never grow you'll just swell
[1:16:43] you're just bloat
[1:16:45] but if we stay in the word of god
[1:16:48] and and stay in our territory and not
[1:16:51] try to compete with what other churches
[1:16:53] have and what other churches are doing
[1:16:54] and even if we're making personal
[1:16:56] decisions about where god wants us to be
[1:16:58] and about what matters and we make a
[1:17:00] decision based upon what the word of god
[1:17:03] says and not the amenities and the
[1:17:04] attractions of the world then that's
[1:17:06] where we'll be blessed and he says the
[1:17:08] holy spirit will do the rest if you just
[1:17:10] stay with the word and the holy spirit
[1:17:12] and he says because even though it may
[1:17:14] look like it you've got something the
[1:17:16] rest of them don't have
[1:17:18] that means we can take pride in the fact
[1:17:21] that we have the word of god it is ours
[1:17:25] and with that kind of pride coupled with
[1:17:28] humility that's what i want the world to
[1:17:31] find is the christ that i have not the
[1:17:33] coffee bar not the not the music not the
[1:17:36] youth group not the singing not the
[1:17:38] amenities but i want them to know christ
[1:17:41] [Music]
[1:17:44] but you got to stay in your own
[1:17:45] territory
[1:17:48] and then in thinking about comparison
[1:17:51] brother man i'm in the sermon doors and
[1:17:52] door this is february 6 1965 preached in
[1:17:55] flagstaff
[1:17:57] he says when mrs
[1:17:58] amy simple mcpherson when she was here
[1:18:01] on earth in her ministry they say that
[1:18:02] pretty near every woman preacher wore
[1:18:05] those wings like you know or gowns like
[1:18:06] that impact the bible
[1:18:09] comparison emulation impersonation
[1:18:12] wanting to be like that sets the
[1:18:13] standard that's what i want to be like
[1:18:15] just look at billy graham that the billy
[1:18:17] grahams is in the land today
[1:18:21] and even all the other ones he talked
[1:18:23] about the other ones that try to mimic
[1:18:24] him personally says billy graham could
[1:18:25] never take your place
[1:18:28] i couldn't take billy his place
[1:18:30] he couldn't take mine
[1:18:33] i can't take yours
[1:18:36] you can't take mine
[1:18:38] shame on all those people that try to
[1:18:39] take his place
[1:18:41] but shame on all those people trying to
[1:18:43] make him take mine
[1:18:45] right
[1:18:46] he can't take your place
[1:18:48] i can't take yours and you can't take
[1:18:50] mine you're an individual in god god
[1:18:52] made you the way you are for some
[1:18:54] purpose
[1:18:55] why am i this way for some purpose
[1:18:58] if we would just find our place then
[1:19:01] abide there
[1:19:03] if we try to do something different than
[1:19:05] see we're in somebody else's territory
[1:19:07] which we just gum up the picture of god
[1:19:09] you see the point he's trying to make
[1:19:11] you've got to stay in your place you've
[1:19:13] got to be in your lane what's going to
[1:19:15] cause us to veer out of where our place
[1:19:17] is when we begin to compare ourselves to
[1:19:19] somebody else's place
[1:19:21] if you're the middle toe don't start
[1:19:22] looking at the big toe
[1:19:24] i want to be a big toe
[1:19:26] no you can that's going to that's going
[1:19:28] to cause problems you got to stay where
[1:19:30] you are and be proud of who you are
[1:19:33] every member in the body of christ has
[1:19:35] been dealt a measure a boundary a limit
[1:19:37] of faith and there is a value and a
[1:19:40] purpose in it that cannot be described
[1:19:42] as even greater or more necessary than
[1:19:45] any other part
[1:19:47] and so you have to take pride in the
[1:19:49] measure that god has given you have to
[1:19:51] value it and once you realize that i
[1:19:53] have been made this way for a purpose
[1:19:55] then it begins to cultivate inside of
[1:19:57] you the right kind of attitude and
[1:19:59] mindset to where you'll be willing to
[1:20:01] what persevere willing to be determined
[1:20:04] because you have some level of
[1:20:05] confidence you have the audacity of hope
[1:20:08] you have this belief that you can do it
[1:20:10] i can do all things through christ jesus
[1:20:12] which gives me strength you've changed
[1:20:14] your mindset from being this downtrodden
[1:20:16] broken not where you need to be not sure
[1:20:18] you're even called don't have the same
[1:20:20] gifts as everyone else just saying i am
[1:20:22] what i am by the grace of god and no one
[1:20:24] can take my place and i'm going to take
[1:20:26] pride in who god has made me to be
[1:20:33] the world is trying to make people be
[1:20:34] proud and what they're not
[1:20:35] [Music]
[1:20:37] we ought to take pride in who we are
[1:20:39] otherwise he says you get into somebody
[1:20:40] else's territory
[1:20:42] the wrong kind of pride causes us to
[1:20:45] go right beyond
[1:20:46] [Music]
[1:20:48] right beyond where we ought to be into
[1:20:50] someone else's lane
[1:20:52] he says you gum it up
[1:20:54] the whole program of god the whole plan
[1:20:56] of god the whole picture of god starts
[1:20:57] getting murky and muddled up because now
[1:20:59] you're imposing into someone else's area
[1:21:02] and you're moving over into this area
[1:21:03] and everyone's just bouncing off of each
[1:21:05] other and no one's just staying in their
[1:21:06] place
[1:21:08] that's what that bad pride will do
[1:21:11] but you know it's the lack of good pride
[1:21:14] that's going to keep you from standing
[1:21:15] up
[1:21:16] taking your place
[1:21:18] and all the barriers and obstacles that
[1:21:19] try to hinder you and hold you back
[1:21:21] he says we take like billy graham in the
[1:21:23] denominational world today
[1:21:25] we could call it maybe the football
[1:21:26] player he's got the ball
[1:21:28] now if you try to take the ball away
[1:21:30] from your own man you're just messing up
[1:21:32] your team
[1:21:34] right
[1:21:37] right take the ball away from somebody
[1:21:38] else you're just messing up your own
[1:21:39] team guard your man all right you've got
[1:21:42] a blocking assignment
[1:21:44] keep guarding him
[1:21:45] keep the rest of them so he can make the
[1:21:47] run
[1:21:48] he says and we'll have a touchdown after
[1:21:50] a while
[1:21:53] okay there you go there's some of you
[1:21:55] there's some of your husbands go
[1:21:57] and we'll have a touchdown after a while
[1:21:59] and jesus will come and it'll all be
[1:22:00] over how
[1:22:02] as long as the person who's got the
[1:22:03] balls running
[1:22:05] and the people are supposed to block are
[1:22:06] blocking
[1:22:07] everyone has to do their part
[1:22:09] even if you have to run a route every
[1:22:11] single time knowing that the ball's not
[1:22:12] going to be thrown your way you've got
[1:22:14] to do your part
[1:22:16] even if you know you're alignment and
[1:22:17] they're never going to call your number
[1:22:18] and you're never going to be an eligible
[1:22:20] receiver and you're never going to score
[1:22:21] a touchdown and your name is never going
[1:22:22] to get called just keep doing what
[1:22:23] you're supposed to do
[1:22:25] and do it right your number will never
[1:22:26] get called
[1:22:27] right be no flag on the play
[1:22:30] and it's an image that maybe we relate
[1:22:32] to i'm glad brother branham uses it
[1:22:35] i didn't just pick it out because we're
[1:22:36] in the football playoffs
[1:22:38] but it's perfect when he says you've got
[1:22:41] to stay in your territory
[1:22:43] he says we keep getting into someone
[1:22:44] else's territory
[1:22:46] and the whole thing falls apart
[1:22:50] take pride in what god has made you to
[1:22:51] be
[1:22:54] the paradox the pride paradox
[1:22:57] i think i just need to continue on it
[1:22:59] more later let's stand
[1:23:01] [Music]
[1:23:04] thank you so much
[1:23:07] for how attentive you've
[1:23:09] been how patient
[1:23:11] you've been i trust that what you've
[1:23:12] received and heard
[1:23:15] has encouraged you and spoke to you
[1:23:18] let's bow our heads
[1:23:20] [Music]
[1:23:22] our gracious heavenly father
[1:23:24] [Music]
[1:23:26] lord i'm laying out a lot of material
[1:23:30] today
[1:23:32] a lot of principles a lot of different
[1:23:34] thoughts a lot of
[1:23:35] different tracks that my heart is
[1:23:37] running on
[1:23:39] [Music]
[1:23:41] and lord if i could just summarize in
[1:23:43] prayer to you
[1:23:44] as my voice is going out over your
[1:23:46] people that are here today
[1:23:48] [Music]
[1:23:52] we never want to be arrogant lord
[1:23:56] we never want to have a vanity or an
[1:23:58] empty boast
[1:24:01] we never want to brag from a place of
[1:24:02] insecurity we never want to put on a
[1:24:05] front from a place of emptiness
[1:24:09] but lord we would never want to have a
[1:24:11] testimony that profaned your name
[1:24:14] we would never want to have a confession
[1:24:16] that speaks contrary to your word
[1:24:21] and lord as we're admonished in the
[1:24:22] bible that when a man thinks himself to
[1:24:24] be something when he's not that thing he
[1:24:25] deceives himself so lord we do not want
[1:24:27] to be deceived
[1:24:30] and as the same writer tells us that we
[1:24:32] ought not to think of ourselves more
[1:24:34] highly than we should
[1:24:36] lord we don't want to do that
[1:24:38] but the same writer
[1:24:40] says that we ought to think of ourselves
[1:24:44] in light of the measure of faith that
[1:24:46] you've given us
[1:24:48] lord help us all to see that measure
[1:24:52] as priceless
[1:24:54] help us all today to see that that
[1:24:56] measure of faith
[1:24:58] though it may not be the full measure it
[1:25:00] takes my measure to achieve a full
[1:25:03] measure
[1:25:04] though it may not be the fullness of the
[1:25:06] godhead in my person yet in the measure
[1:25:10] is all of god
[1:25:12] all that you are
[1:25:14] all your potential and all your ability
[1:25:17] so lord the same writer the same
[1:25:19] inspiration the one you were inspired to
[1:25:22] place these boundaries of pride that we
[1:25:24] ought not to follow these barriers of
[1:25:26] pride that we not ought to fall into
[1:25:27] lord he also tried to raise us up to
[1:25:30] possess the the extent and the range of
[1:25:32] the gifts that you've placed inside of
[1:25:34] us and he says i will not boast in
[1:25:36] another man's rule but i will boast in
[1:25:38] my own
[1:25:39] i will not boast in in the measure of
[1:25:42] somebody else's work but i will boast in
[1:25:44] my own i will not go beyond into another
[1:25:47] man's labor but i will stay faithful in
[1:25:49] my own
[1:25:51] and we're taught that we ought to have
[1:25:52] some sort of determination and
[1:25:54] confidence that we're doing the right
[1:25:56] thing and some belief in conviction that
[1:25:58] in doing the right thing will receive
[1:25:59] the right kind of benefit
[1:26:02] and lord if we use
[1:26:03] pride in a negative sense i pray you've
[1:26:06] given me a grace today to use it in a
[1:26:08] positive sense that there must be some
[1:26:10] pride in what we're doing what we're
[1:26:12] trying to achieve in order to be
[1:26:14] determined in it
[1:26:16] if i'm going to keep practicing and keep
[1:26:18] practicing and keep practicing it's
[1:26:20] because i believe that practice makes
[1:26:22] perfect i believe that practice makes
[1:26:24] permanent i believe that doing
[1:26:26] practicing the right way is going to
[1:26:28] produce the right results and therefore
[1:26:30] i'm not practicing because i can't i'm
[1:26:32] not practicing because i'm weak i'm not
[1:26:34] practicing until i'm trying to make
[1:26:36] myself a christian i'm doing it because
[1:26:38] i am a christian and i do believe that
[1:26:40] through me you will be expressed and you
[1:26:42] will be made manifest
[1:26:44] and lord i pray that you tear down and
[1:26:47] wash away from us and break any of these
[1:26:49] negative cycles that have existed in our
[1:26:51] thinking
[1:26:52] lord as brother ernie used to always say
[1:26:54] get away from my stinking thinking to
[1:26:56] where we stop thinking negatively we
[1:26:58] stop thinking of ourselves less than we
[1:27:00] ought to but oh lord value the gift
[1:27:03] you've placed in a heart value the
[1:27:05] eternal life value the predestinated
[1:27:07] seed
[1:27:09] lord i you've stripped away family pride
[1:27:11] you've stripped away state pride you've
[1:27:13] stripped away national pride
[1:27:16] i trust that is what you're doing in our
[1:27:18] lives we have no more pride in our last
[1:27:19] name we have no more pride in the state
[1:27:21] of our birth we have no more pride in
[1:27:23] this great country of america but we
[1:27:25] start taking our pride from the word of
[1:27:27] god i'm proud to be a christian i'm
[1:27:30] proud to be a message believer i'm proud
[1:27:32] to be a holy spirit-filled son of god
[1:27:35] i'm proud to be an elect daughter of god
[1:27:37] i'll take my place stay in my territory
[1:27:40] be who he wants me to be
[1:27:42] and help us all to be loose from all the
[1:27:44] barriers that bind us and push us down
[1:27:47] and tell us we're nothing and try to
[1:27:48] marginalize us and try to strip us of
[1:27:51] our power and access to jesus christ and
[1:27:53] lord lord may we rise up as a mighty
[1:27:55] army
[1:27:57] and possess our
[1:27:58] territory come back to our territory
[1:28:02] be what you've called us to be
[1:28:05] in the name of the lord jesus christ we
[1:28:07] ask these things
[1:28:09] amen
[1:28:10] amen
