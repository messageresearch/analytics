[0:00] We've been ministering on the subject of
[0:02] gardening, even even using the concept
[0:04] of the art of gardening or gardening as
[0:06] an art and how there's been something
[0:09] eternal planted inside of us. And it's
[0:11] our desire to see that grow. And a lot
[0:15] of that kind of flowed from the idea of
[0:18] a prelude where you give forethought and
[0:20] vision. It's that forecasting of seeds
[0:22] and the sewing of seeds to bring it to
[0:24] that ultimate climax and conclusion. We
[0:26] should see that individually in our own
[0:28] lives, but then also we see it in the
[0:29] big picture of God sewing the word and
[0:31] even the rapture. And so we're
[0:34] continuing on some of those themes, but
[0:36] tonight um you know, I really wish maybe
[0:38] this subject would be good on a Sunday
[0:40] morning when everybody's here. Uh but
[0:42] I'm really wanting to address very
[0:44] specific things that we ought to be
[0:45] doing as believers and things that are
[0:47] very important for us to overcome in
[0:49] this hour. Proverbs 24:30. I went by the
[0:53] field of the slothful, and by the
[0:55] vineyard of the man void of
[0:56] understanding, and lo, it was all grown
[0:59] over with thorns, and nettles had
[1:01] covered the face thereof, and the stone
[1:03] wall thereof was broken down. Then I saw
[1:06] and considered it well. I looked upon
[1:08] it, and received instruction. Yet, a
[1:11] little sleep, a little slumber, a little
[1:13] folding of the hands to sleep. So shall
[1:15] thy poverty come as one that travelth
[1:18] and thy want as an armed man. Amen. You
[1:21] can be seated.
[1:24] I'm going to use a title that kind of is
[1:27] a little bit of uh double meaning in it
[1:29] and some phrasing that I hope can make
[1:32] some sense as we continue. But it's
[1:33] praying on ignorance. Uh praying on
[1:37] ignorance. And I'm really going to drill
[1:38] down on this idea of this being void of
[1:40] understanding or ignorance. uh but just
[1:43] praying on it. Obviously, I'm suggesting
[1:46] that if there's ignorance, it can be
[1:48] taken advantage of. If you look at verse
[1:50] 30 and what we've read already, he says,
[1:52] "I went to the field of the slothful."
[1:54] We know that is the lazy. And by the
[1:56] vineyard of the man void of
[1:58] understanding, that one that is in need
[2:00] of understanding. So, they they don't
[2:02] have the proper knowledge. And lo, it
[2:05] was all grown over with thorns, and
[2:07] nettles had covered the face thereof,
[2:09] and the stone wall thereof was broken
[2:11] down. Then I saw and considered it well.
[2:13] I looked upon it and received
[2:15] instruction. I want to take these two
[2:18] characters together, the slothful and
[2:20] the man void of understanding. And we
[2:22] could even maybe some uh guess that he's
[2:26] referring to the same field and to the
[2:28] same person. But this one that is void
[2:30] of understanding and lacks knowledge or
[2:32] is in need of wisdom and understanding.
[2:35] uh the the word for ignorance even in
[2:38] the Latin the root is from the word
[2:40] which means to not know that's what we
[2:42] mean by ignorance you don't know
[2:44] something and the ignorance here that
[2:46] I'm referring to when I say praying on
[2:48] ignorance I want to take it from this
[2:50] standpoint of one that's void of
[2:51] understanding but it implies not knowing
[2:54] something that you ought to have known
[2:56] that this is a man that planted a field
[2:59] he planted a vineyard but then he's void
[3:01] of understanding in other words he ought
[3:02] to have known the requirements he ought
[3:04] to known the burden. He might ought to
[3:06] have known or had been taught or had
[3:09] seen an example of something. And so I
[3:11] believe it's evident in Proverbs 24 that
[3:13] there's some willful ignorance. In other
[3:16] words, nature should have taught him
[3:17] something, life taught him something or
[3:19] there's some uh uh laziness where he's
[3:21] not being proactive and it results in
[3:24] destruction.
[3:25] In Proverbs 1:es 27, 28, and 29, it
[3:29] says, 'When your fear cometh as
[3:30] desolation, and your destruction cometh
[3:33] as a whirlwind, when distress and
[3:36] anguish cometh upon you, then shall they
[3:38] call upon me, but I will not answer.
[3:41] Focus on these verses tonight as I read
[3:44] these things. I'm actually going to use
[3:46] a larger context in some places just so
[3:48] that you can see the the very principle
[3:51] that I'm wanting to identify how it
[3:53] exists within this broader context that
[3:54] is so important and full of a lot of
[3:56] instruction. But here it's saying that
[3:58] when your fear and destruction comes and
[4:01] remember if you sew to the wind you reap
[4:02] a whirlwind. So there had been some
[4:04] sowing there had been some lack of
[4:06] attentiveness the slothful the man void
[4:09] of understanding. When destruction comes
[4:11] and desolation comes, then you cry out
[4:15] and he says, "I will not answer." We can
[4:17] gather from this that they waited until
[4:19] destruction came to cry. That there
[4:22] hadn't been this crying out before
[4:24] destruction. They waited till this last
[4:26] moment say, "Oh no, help." And he says,
[4:27] "They shall seek me early, but they
[4:29] shall not find me." Seek me early would
[4:32] imply that maybe they rise up early in
[4:34] their anxiety and their fear and they
[4:36] look to the Lord. Lord, desolations come
[4:38] upon me.
[4:39] uh this whirlwind's come upon me. But
[4:41] then he says this, for they hated
[4:43] knowledge and did not choose the fear of
[4:45] the Lord. We know that the fear of the
[4:47] Lord is the beginning of wisdom. And
[4:49] there's a lot that we could look at in
[4:50] terms of reverencing God and respecting
[4:52] him and fearing him. But this attitude
[4:54] that they hated knowledge. And because
[4:57] they hated knowledge, there's some
[4:59] willful ignorance. They didn't seek it.
[5:00] They didn't desire it. They didn't look
[5:02] um in all their getting, they didn't get
[5:04] understanding. And ignorance creates a
[5:07] void that will be filled by
[5:08] unrighteousness.
[5:10] The fact that they hated knowledge
[5:12] created this void where whirlwind could
[5:14] come in, distress and anguish and
[5:16] destruction and fear could come in
[5:18] because they hated knowledge. And where
[5:21] there's ignorance, not only is there
[5:23] this void that wickedness and
[5:25] unrighteousness can fill, but it becomes
[5:27] a weakness or a vulnerability that can
[5:28] be exploited.
[5:30] Again, more scriptures on this idea of
[5:32] ignorance. And my title, praying on
[5:34] ignorance. I'm wanting to just briefly
[5:37] in this outset emphasize just how
[5:40] dangerous it is to be ignorant. And I'm
[5:43] not using that in a term, well, you're
[5:45] stupid or you're dumb in those terms,
[5:47] but one who ought to know or one who's
[5:49] been taught but doesn't like to retain
[5:51] these things in their knowledge or one
[5:52] that doesn't truly seek to understand.
[5:56] Hosea 4:es 1 and 2. Hear the word of the
[5:59] Lord, ye children of Israel. For the
[6:01] Lord hath a controversy with the
[6:02] inhabitants of the land. He has a
[6:04] complaint. Because there is no truth,
[6:07] nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the
[6:09] land. So because there is a lack of
[6:12] knowledge of God, there cannot be truth.
[6:13] There cannot be mercy. By swearing and
[6:16] lying and killing and stealing and
[6:17] committing adultery, they break out and
[6:19] blood toucheth blood. The second verse
[6:22] tells us the impact of ignorance. The
[6:25] fact that they did not have a knowledge
[6:27] of God. There could not be truth. There
[6:29] could not be mercy. And it leads to
[6:31] swearing, lying, killing, stealing, and
[6:33] committing adultery. They break out.
[6:35] Blood toucheth blood. Where there is
[6:38] ignorance, where there's a lack of
[6:39] understanding, wisdom, or knowledge,
[6:40] there's weakness, there's vulnerability.
[6:42] Where there is no knowledge, it creates
[6:44] this vacuum for wickedness to fill.
[6:47] Swearing, lying, killing, stealing,
[6:49] committing adultery, this breaking out,
[6:51] blood, touching blood. You can say,
[6:53] well, why do these things happen in the
[6:55] void of tr where there's no truth? Where
[6:58] there's a lack of understanding, where
[7:00] there's some area where there's this
[7:02] emptiness or this vanity, that's where
[7:05] um these destructions and this distress
[7:08] and anguish can come into that void and
[7:10] fill it. So he says this in verse 6,
[7:13] Hosea 4:6. This is uh speaking to verse
[7:16] one. My people are destroyed for lack of
[7:20] knowledge. I know this is a scripture
[7:22] that I often quote and I don't say this
[7:25] at all because I have degrees. We have
[7:27] doctors among us who have many degrees.
[7:29] And so this isn't a petting of the of
[7:31] the person who's been able to achieve
[7:33] things academically. This is what he
[7:36] said in verse one, the knowledge of God.
[7:38] My people are destroyed for lack of
[7:40] knowledge. Not because they didn't have
[7:41] street smarts. Not because they didn't
[7:43] know how to do shrewd business deals.
[7:45] They didn't retain God in their
[7:46] knowledge. They didn't keep the word,
[7:48] hide the word in their heart as they
[7:50] were told to bind it upon their heart,
[7:51] their doorpost and keep it always before
[7:53] them. There was ways that the word was
[7:55] to stay fresh. It says, "Because thou
[7:57] hast rejected knowledge, notice the
[7:59] consequence again of this ignorance, I
[8:01] will also reject thee. The vineyard of
[8:04] the man void of understanding, it was
[8:06] the walls were torn down, the nettles
[8:08] and gr uh uh thorns grew over and choked
[8:12] out the fruit thereof." So he says, "You
[8:14] reject knowledge, I will reject thee.
[8:15] That thou shalt be no priest to me.
[8:18] Seeing thou hast forgotten the law of
[8:20] thy God, I will also forget thy
[8:23] children." Now that's hard.
[8:26] &gt;&gt; But we could say you can't say you
[8:29] weren't warned.
[8:30] &gt;&gt; Consequences in the scripture for not
[8:33] following God's obedience. I've been
[8:35] studying the book of Ruth lately and
[8:36] just reading over uh in that story and
[8:39] how Aimilec when he left uh that land of
[8:42] famine, he he he left in opposition to
[8:46] God's word because the reason of the
[8:47] famine was disobedience.
[8:49] &gt;&gt; And you can't run into Moab thinking
[8:51] you're going to escape God's judgments
[8:54] because God said, "I'll if you keep me
[8:56] before you, I'll bless you in that
[8:58] land." And so the famine was God's
[9:00] judgments. So not retaining that in his
[9:02] knowledge to say, "Wait a minute. God
[9:04] promised us in this land that we would
[9:06] have grain and we would have honey and
[9:08] we'd have these things." The reason why
[9:09] we don't have it is we're not calling on
[9:11] the Lord. And you should have turned to
[9:13] God that God could bless him. And here
[9:16] the people do not seek them. They run
[9:18] after their own flesh. They sow to the
[9:20] wind. And then when they begin to reap
[9:21] the world went, "Oh, help us. Help us.
[9:23] Help us." He says, "Had you sought
[9:25] knowledge?
[9:27] If you had sought me and not just help
[9:28] in your time of need, but were you truly
[9:30] seeking me in the knowledge of God? You
[9:32] hated knowledge. You rejected knowledge.
[9:34] Therefore, God, the consequence is to
[9:36] those and even their children. My people
[9:39] are destroyed. It means they perish.
[9:41] They're cut off from God or brought to
[9:43] silence. And the silence not only
[9:45] impacts those who consciously rejected
[9:47] knowledge, but their children after
[9:48] them.
[9:52] Now, if we could uh move move forward in
[9:55] this and just see very quickly because
[9:57] personally there's a lot here that we
[9:59] could continue to mine out on knowledge,
[10:00] wisdom, understanding, and and the the
[10:03] consequence of of ignorance. But in 2
[10:05] Corinthians chapter 2 11, Paul talking
[10:08] about forgiveness and being able to
[10:10] forgive one another and how it's
[10:12] necessary to forgive because it's
[10:14] something that the devil will exploit.
[10:15] He said, "Lest Satan should get an
[10:18] advantage of us, for we are not ignorant
[10:20] of his devices." Remember, overcoming is
[10:24] recognizing the devil in every one of
[10:25] his tricks. So, these are Satan's
[10:28] devices. He looks to where there's
[10:30] unforgiveness in your heart, where
[10:31] there's bitterness, where there's a
[10:32] grudge, where there's a complex or envy.
[10:34] And what he will do is he will take
[10:36] advantage of that.
[10:38] &gt;&gt; Paul is saying, we know how Satan works.
[10:40] Satan's always looking for an
[10:42] exploitable advantage. Satan will take
[10:45] uh advantage of any complex weakness.
[10:48] And so what I say here is Satan will
[10:50] take advantage of ignorance. He will
[10:52] exploit a lack of knowledge.
[10:56] Now I'm I'm wanting to continue on this,
[10:59] Lord willing, on Sunday and even maybe
[11:01] next Wednesday uh as I just have it in
[11:03] my heart kind of these three particular
[11:06] areas to address. But if you don't know
[11:09] something about your Bible, Satan will
[11:12] start right there.
[11:14] &gt;&gt; If you don't know something about the
[11:16] message or the messenger, Satan can
[11:18] start right there.
[11:20] &gt;&gt; Because where there's a lack of
[11:21] knowledge, he could present something to
[11:22] you anyway he wants. And if you don't
[11:25] have the the anchor, the typost or the
[11:27] the genuine to compare to, you can just
[11:30] receive the lie as the truth and say,
[11:32] "Wow, I had no idea that's what the
[11:34] Bible taught. I cannot believe I've been
[11:36] believing this this whole time. And the
[11:38] devil I I want to say this uh because I
[11:41] really wrestle with just exactly how to
[11:43] say this in terms of praying on
[11:44] ignorance. Listen and take this into
[11:47] your heart. If your children aren't
[11:48] here, find a way to share this with your
[11:50] children. If there's people who aren't
[11:51] here, uh if our neighbor in apartment
[11:54] next door needs to hear this, share it
[11:55] with them. What the devil wants to do is
[11:57] make you feel stupid for believing God.
[12:02] He make he wants to make you feel stupid
[12:04] for believing the message. I can't
[12:05] believe I believe that. I can't believe
[12:07] I was so stupid to follow that. You
[12:09] know, that's how the devil works.
[12:12] &gt;&gt; That's how he wants to get you to think.
[12:14] So, what is he praying on when he does
[12:15] it? He's praying on ignorance.
[12:17] &gt;&gt; The Bible says that that's how the
[12:18] spirit works. Taking these women who are
[12:20] laden with sins and burdened with sins,
[12:22] he takes them silly and he leads them
[12:23] away by their lust. what he's able to
[12:25] capitalize on a complex or weakness and
[12:28] make you feel dumb because you believe
[12:30] something when in reality he's
[12:33] capitalizing on something that's lacking
[12:37] truly when it's by faith you've already
[12:38] learned man it this is foolishness to
[12:40] the world but I know right where I'm
[12:43] standing
[12:45] Satan will try to take advantage of a
[12:46] lack of knowledge or understanding
[12:49] in 1 Peter chapter 5 6-9 humble
[12:52] yourselves and if If you're jotting down
[12:54] notes, maybe take this word here,
[12:56] humility. Humble yourselves, therefore,
[12:58] under the mighty hand of God that he may
[13:00] exalt you in due time. So, it takes a
[13:02] lowering of yourself to be exalted.
[13:05] Notice through this humility, we now
[13:09] unbburdened ourselves. We cast all our
[13:11] cares upon him. Casting all your care
[13:13] upon him, for he carth for you. So, as
[13:15] you are brought low, it's our burdens
[13:17] that will bring us low. David and the
[13:19] psalmist often wrote about, I cleave to
[13:21] the earth and I'm out of breath. Why?
[13:23] because the heaviness, the weight, I
[13:25] can't even look up. So, as we humble
[13:26] ourselves before God because of our
[13:28] weakness, cast your cares upon him, for
[13:30] he cared for you. Then also be sober, be
[13:33] vigilant because your adversary, the
[13:35] devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about
[13:38] seeking whom he may devour.
[13:40] He makes due use of every opportunity.
[13:44] He's more opportunistic than we are.
[13:47] He more often takes advantage of
[13:50] opportunity than we do. I know I just
[13:52] repeated myself just using different
[13:54] words, but you might have found the
[13:55] emphasis necessary.
[13:58] We we we live under the blessings of
[14:00] God. We are seated in heavenly places in
[14:03] Christ Jesus. The Pentecostal skies are
[14:05] full of biblical blessings. We have
[14:08] everything made available to us through
[14:10] redemption. All those benefits of the
[14:11] atonement and those blessings that are
[14:13] in the atonement. But how often do we
[14:16] not reach for them? How often do we take
[14:19] second best or we reach out for these
[14:20] other worldly ideals or pursue things
[14:23] that never satisfy when God has made
[14:25] everything available to in his word and
[14:27] we can access it by faith. And if we
[14:29] took the same approach to God's
[14:31] blessings as Satan does to trying to
[14:33] curse you,
[14:35] we'd be pretty blessed because the Bible
[14:37] says he walks about. He never sleeps
[14:39] looking for an opportunity to devour
[14:42] you. And he does this not as a lion that
[14:45] has the ability but or as literally a
[14:48] lion but one who thinks he's a lion as a
[14:52] lion whose only power is when you yield
[14:54] it to him.
[14:56] &gt;&gt; And here we are who have absolute power
[14:58] according to the word of God or by the
[15:00] word of God and faith in God's word. And
[15:02] yet we don't resist the devil as it says
[15:04] that we ought to do. But our adversary
[15:08] walks about seeking for an opportunity
[15:11] to bring distress and anguish to destroy
[15:14] your hedge to destroy your vineyard. So
[15:17] therefore he says whom resist steadfast
[15:19] in the faith knowing that the same
[15:21] afflictions are accomplished in your
[15:22] brethren that are in the world. Notice
[15:25] these elements humble yourselves.
[15:28] Cast your cares. So there's this first
[15:31] submission. Submission without
[15:33] resistance without submission is futile.
[15:35] also he says resist in the faith but
[15:37] first having submitted before the mighty
[15:39] hand of God casting our cares upon him
[15:41] because we had this adversary resist the
[15:44] devil who prays on weakness
[15:49] and as I continue tonight and I'm going
[15:52] to want to use something very specific
[15:54] I'm I'm wanting to address
[15:56] vulnerabilities that the world flesh and
[15:59] the devil will take advantage of to
[16:02] weaken your faith in the
[16:05] that if we have if Satan has been made
[16:08] powerless, he's if he's been stripped of
[16:10] every power that he had over the
[16:12] believer on at Calvary, then there's
[16:14] only a certain amount of power he the
[16:17] power that he would have over us is only
[16:19] to the extent that we must allow it. And
[16:21] if we allow it, surely we're doing it
[16:23] through ignorance.
[16:26] Surely we wouldn't say, "Oh, no. I want
[16:28] him just to run rough shot over me. I
[16:29] want him to drive me to lust. I want him
[16:31] to drive me to hate. I want him to drive
[16:33] me to do these things." No. What do we
[16:34] often find ourselves saying, Lord, I
[16:36] don't want to be driven to do these
[16:37] things that a Christian shouldn't do.
[16:39] But we've set ourselves up as a target
[16:41] because we believe in God. When you are
[16:43] receive the Holy Ghost, you set yourself
[16:45] as a target to be driven some minor
[16:47] things and driven to do things that a
[16:48] believer ought not to do. Therefore, you
[16:50] need God's protection.
[16:52] &gt;&gt; You need God's help. And so, he's
[16:54] looking for an exploitable advantage. He
[16:57] prays on weakness.
[16:59] And so in these next few services, I'm
[17:01] wanting to look at these vulnerabilities
[17:02] or these weaknesses that the devil takes
[17:05] advantage of to ultimately take away
[17:07] your strength or weaken your faith in
[17:09] the word of God.
[17:12] James 1:es 2-6
[17:15] says, "My brethren, count it all joy
[17:17] when you fall into diverse temptations."
[17:20] Now, you might read that and be like,
[17:21] "Oh, man, that's great because today I
[17:23] was tempted to watch a movie I knew I
[17:26] shouldn't watch, and yesterday I was
[17:27] tempted to listen to Taylor Swift's new
[17:29] album." And you're thinking, "These are
[17:31] very diverse temptations." That's not
[17:32] what he's referring to. But it's the
[17:35] trying of your faith. It's not the
[17:38] falling into it, but that attack against
[17:40] your faith. My brethren, count it all
[17:41] joy when you fall into diverse
[17:43] temptations, knowing this. So notice
[17:46] recognize that there's a knowledge
[17:47] requirement
[17:49] uh that if we're going to count it joy
[17:51] there it must it must presuppose this
[17:53] knowledge that the trying of your faith
[17:56] workketh patience. So we must know that
[17:59] faith tried works patience and but let
[18:01] patience have a perfect work that you
[18:03] may be perfect and entire wanting
[18:05] nothing. We know that patience
[18:09] when it is tested, when it's tried, that
[18:10] God's will for us is to be pa tested.
[18:14] And God's will for us be in perfection,
[18:15] it's his will that we would suffer. And
[18:18] that when we suffer and we take it
[18:19] patiently, it brings forth and produces
[18:21] this great character. So, we're to count
[18:24] it joy when we suffer, knowing first
[18:26] this knowledge requirement that the
[18:27] trying of your faith, that this faith
[18:30] being tried has value in it. And then
[18:33] verse five, if any of you lack wisdom,
[18:38] I'm not trying to expand this beyond the
[18:39] bounds of what the scripture intends,
[18:40] but if anybody is void of understanding,
[18:43] if you do not have knowledge, if you're
[18:45] ignorant, let him ask of God that giveth
[18:49] to all men liberally and upgradeth not,
[18:52] and it shall be given him.
[18:55] We are taught to ask for wisdom, to ask
[18:58] for wisdom, knowledge, and
[18:59] understanding. The Bible says with all
[19:01] that, you know, with all you're getting,
[19:02] get understanding. If you're seeking
[19:04] after something, seek for wisdom first.
[19:06] We're taught in the Proverbs to seek
[19:08] after wisdom, to treasure it, to value
[19:10] it.
[19:11] And here it says, if you lack wisdom, I
[19:13] want to say knowledge, wisdom,
[19:15] understanding, then ask God for it.
[19:19] &gt;&gt; And he'll give and he's not going to
[19:22] laugh at you when you ask.
[19:24] I know sometimes we say there's no
[19:26] stupid questions and then somebody asks
[19:28] something then it really tries that
[19:29] definition.
[19:31] H but truly to God this this can never
[19:33] he'll never laugh at you. He'll never
[19:35] mock you. God give me wisdom. God's not
[19:37] ever going for everything I've already
[19:39] taught him. He'd say he's learning
[19:41] something.
[19:43] It pleases God. When Solomon asked for
[19:45] wisdom that pleased God. So he says,
[19:48] "But let him ask in faith." So we must
[19:51] know that the trine of our faith works
[19:53] patience. We must ask God for wisdom if
[19:55] we lack it. But we must ask in faith,
[19:57] not wavering. For he that waverth is
[19:59] like a wave of the sea driven with the
[20:00] wind and tossed. That's that
[20:02] double-minded man in some instability.
[20:05] Now, this brings me to this first thing
[20:08] I'm wanting to address. In light of the
[20:11] fact that the devil prays on ignorance
[20:13] and that he he'll take advantage of
[20:15] vulnerabilities or weaknesses, the Bible
[20:17] says, "Ask in faith." This is this act
[20:19] of imploring, in treating or petitioning
[20:22] God. The word we may use is pray.
[20:26] Pray to God for wisdom. To pray means to
[20:30] ask earnestly.
[20:32] Have have you ever thought about what
[20:34] the opposite of prayer is?
[20:37] You want to break out into sessions. We
[20:39] can get group leaders. We can um hotwash
[20:42] this or whatever it is we do with
[20:43] corporate speak and kind of come to a
[20:45] decision as to what the opposite of
[20:46] prayer is. But I'd like you to think
[20:48] about this. But this is the conclusion I
[20:50] came to. The opposite of praying is
[20:52] ignoring.
[20:56] The opposite of praying isn't saying,
[20:57] "Well, I know I need wisdom." And
[20:59] saying, "God, don't give me wisdom."
[21:01] That's not the opposite of praying. The
[21:02] opposite of prayer here would be to know
[21:04] that you need wisdom and not ask for it.
[21:07] The opposite of praying is ignoring or
[21:09] inaction.
[21:11] If you lack, ask.
[21:14] If you don't have, ask. Pray.
[21:18] and fold your hands and close your eyes
[21:21] to petition and pray, not sleep.
[21:25] Why? Because a little folding of the
[21:26] hands, a little closing of the eyes, and
[21:29] a little slumber,
[21:32] right? Man, I know I should tend to my
[21:34] garden. Man, I know I don't have Oh my
[21:36] goodness, I'm in a lot of trouble. I'm
[21:39] going to take a nap. Right? What do we
[21:41] do sometimes when we're anxious? We just
[21:43] want to sleep.
[21:45] A and and at the best time of the day is
[21:47] when we're sleeping because then at
[21:49] least you know whatever torment we have
[21:50] in our sleeps we can just count it as a
[21:52] nightmare but then you wake up and it's
[21:53] all there all the pressures. So instead
[21:56] of just sleeping it away or eating it
[21:58] away God help us is pray
[22:01] fold the hands close the eyes and pray.
[22:05] If you lack, ask.
[22:09] Because the opposite of praying is
[22:11] ignoring. And both ignorance and
[22:13] ignoring have their same root in the
[22:16] same Latin word
[22:18] that the that God pray the devil praying
[22:21] on ignorance is actually just praying on
[22:22] your ignoring.
[22:25] To ignore is to not know. Ignorance is
[22:27] to not know. That's what it originally
[22:28] meant. Now we kind of the evolution of
[22:30] the term ignoring means like this
[22:32] intentional willful kind of rejection or
[22:34] turning away. But it's essentially is
[22:36] the same thing when God presents
[22:38] knowledge or truth or an opportunity
[22:40] shows you I lack something. I lack
[22:41] something. When you ignore it and don't
[22:43] ask according to the need that's
[22:46] ignorance.
[22:49] So I I I I think that if I could say it
[22:52] this way, I'm encouraging each one of
[22:54] you as individuals and even us as
[22:56] families to encourage prayer, encourage
[23:00] family prayer,
[23:02] to be deliberate about it, to be
[23:04] intentional about growth or that which
[23:07] lacks. And we say, well, where do we
[23:09] start? But then where do we start? We
[23:10] haven't done this ever and this had to
[23:12] happen, that's happening, this is
[23:13] happening. We can start with prayer.
[23:16] If you lack something in your life and
[23:18] you say, "Well, I don't know how to make
[23:19] this happen." Start with prayer. Lord, I
[23:22] need wisdom. What do you need wisdom
[23:23] for? Lord, I lack the discipline in my
[23:25] life to do these things. Lord, I I lack
[23:28] overcoming power when it comes to this.
[23:30] Lord, I lack direction. In other words,
[23:32] you're coming before the Lord. And
[23:33] you're being honest with him to say,
[23:35] "Lord, I lack wisdom.
[23:38] Give me wisdom."
[23:40] It's not a matter of closing your eyes
[23:42] and folding your hands and saying,
[23:44] "Lord, I got a lot of problems. Help me,
[23:46] man."
[23:48] Right? But it's praying, asking
[23:51] earnestly. That's what prayer is, to ask
[23:53] earnestly.
[23:55] I heard a prayer one time over food. It
[23:57] was God's meat. Let's eat. Those are
[24:00] just two. That's a statement and then a
[24:03] command. Essentially,
[24:06] we want to be earnest with our prayers.
[24:09] In Romans 12:es 9-113 looking at this
[24:12] there's just four words I that would
[24:15] draw you to this particular passage or
[24:17] reading in these next several verses but
[24:19] I wanted to read these things that are
[24:21] around it so you can see just how
[24:22] important it is within the context. Let
[24:24] love be without hypocrisy. Let your love
[24:26] be without dissimulation. In order for
[24:28] it to be non-hypocritical, you must
[24:30] hate, reject, abhore that which is evil
[24:33] and cle to adhere yourself to that which
[24:36] is good. True love requires discernment
[24:39] between good and evil. So we should
[24:41] always be praying that our discernment
[24:43] is perfected more and more. That we w
[24:46] would not want to call things that are
[24:47] evil good, nor good things evil. We want
[24:49] to let our love not be hypocritical to
[24:52] reject evil. Embrace good. Be kindly
[24:55] affection one to another with brotherly
[24:57] love. That's an important thing that we
[25:00] must be uh sensitive and kind to one
[25:02] another with a brotherly love in honor
[25:04] preferring one another. There's this
[25:06] lack of selfishness. Not slothful in
[25:09] business, fervent in spirit. A lot of
[25:11] deep principles here
[25:14] to not be slothful in business. You say,
[25:16] "Well, what business are we talking
[25:17] about?" Anything that you are
[25:18] responsible over. You don't have to own
[25:21] your own business. As I mentioned
[25:22] before, my brother Matthew at a
[25:23] particular age when he was asked, "What
[25:24] do you do for work?" He goes, "I own my
[25:26] own business." Just as if that was work
[25:29] in itself is just owning something. And
[25:30] you say, "Well, I own my own
[25:32] toothbrush." But there if you have a
[25:35] business well what is it what is it you
[25:37] need to be doing what is it that you
[25:38] should be active in be be fervent in
[25:41] spirit busy in business it's a fervent
[25:44] spirit some ambition serving the lord
[25:47] rejoicing in hope
[25:50] patient in tribulation
[25:52] these are these rapidfire commands and
[25:55] exhortations and even I would say
[25:57] promises well if I can be patient in
[25:59] hope rejoice in hope then I want to do
[26:00] that if I can be patient in tribulation
[26:01] I want to do that Continuing instant in
[26:04] prayer. That means steadfastly attentive
[26:07] to prayer to persevere and not faint
[26:09] when it comes to praying. Continuing
[26:11] instant in prayer and this is
[26:13] distributing to the necessity of saints
[26:15] given to hospitality. And then you could
[26:17] continue with some of these other
[26:18] things. But let me say this as he says
[26:21] this continuing instant in prayer.
[26:24] Without prayer you cannot hate evil or
[26:26] do good.
[26:28] You'll not be able to bear the
[26:30] tribulations of life to rejoice in hope
[26:31] or be patient in tribulation. Without
[26:34] prayer,
[26:35] you more easily fall into temptation.
[26:39] To live a Christian life, it's necessary
[26:42] to value the spirit of prayer.
[26:46] Now, I know that there are those who are
[26:50] prayer warriors.
[26:52] They have a gift. They have a burden. It
[26:54] drives them to prayer. There's those who
[26:57] are gifted in prayer where they pray for
[26:59] something and things things happen. But
[27:02] if you don't have that prayer warrior
[27:05] spirit gift or calling, then that
[27:07] doesn't exempt you from praying.
[27:10] &gt;&gt; You ought to have you ought to value
[27:12] prayer. And prayer is necessary to
[27:16] maintain our joyful hope to sustain us
[27:20] amid afflictions.
[27:22] The Bible says that they were h found
[27:24] distress and destruction and anguish and
[27:26] fear and they called upon the Lord. He
[27:28] doesn't chide them for calling on the
[27:30] Lord. He chides them because they hated
[27:32] knowledge.
[27:35] He he judges them because they didn't
[27:37] have the habit or practice of calling
[27:39] upon God in anticipation of difficulty.
[27:42] Is that not what Job did? Pre-adventure,
[27:44] my children will sin. Let me offer up a
[27:46] sacrifice. And therefore, we ought to be
[27:48] praying not just whenever it's like
[27:49] everything's falling apart. and you
[27:52] can't get to sleep and you toss and
[27:53] turn. And so then you want to turn to
[27:56] the message. You want to turn to prayer
[27:58] as a sleeping aid
[28:03] in order to
[28:05] even if we don't have that prayer
[28:07] warrior calling,
[28:10] we should we should be in the practice
[28:12] and habit of praying and valuing prayer.
[28:18] Philippians chapter 4:es 6 and 7. Be
[28:22] careful for nothing. Be anxious for
[28:24] nothing. Let nothing cause you anxiety.
[28:27] This may be one of the hardest bars
[28:28] there are in the scripture to not be
[28:32] anxious about anything. That makes me
[28:35] anxious.
[28:37] Thinking that I shouldn't be anxious. Oh
[28:39] no, I get anxious. What does that mean
[28:41] for me? It's like being actually What do
[28:44] you say? Well, you know that don't let
[28:45] that bother you. That makes it even
[28:47] worse. Right? Just get over it.
[28:52] But in everything by prayer and
[28:53] supplication with thanksgiving, let your
[28:55] requests be made known under the unto
[28:56] God. The but he says be not be careful
[29:00] for nothing. That doesn't mean you're
[29:01] not needy, not wanting, not uh having uh
[29:05] maybe stressed because of need, but he
[29:06] said don't be anxious. Just pray about
[29:08] it.
[29:10] So he's not just saying it's not as if
[29:12] the book of Philippians contained one
[29:14] verse just four words. be careful for
[29:17] nothing. And then boom, we're just left
[29:18] to be like, what does that mean? But he
[29:20] says, if you're anxious, if you're
[29:21] overburdened, if you're taxed or
[29:23] stressed, give by prayer and
[29:24] supplication with thanksgiving, let your
[29:27] requests be made known to God. Lord, I'm
[29:29] anxious. I'm worried. I'm fearful. I'm
[29:31] distressed. I see these things
[29:33] happening. Let your requests be made
[29:34] only to God. Notice verse seven. And the
[29:36] peace of God which passeth all
[29:38] understanding shall keep your hearts and
[29:39] minds through Christ Jesus. In other
[29:41] words, it's not just saying, well, don't
[29:43] be anxious. It's saying, "Well, don't be
[29:45] so anxious.
[29:47] If all these things are causing you
[29:49] anxiety, let these things be made known
[29:52] unto God through prayer in supplication.
[29:55] Join it with your thanksgiving. Let God
[29:57] know. And the peace of God will cover
[30:00] your anxieties.
[30:04] &gt;&gt; He'll keep your hearts and minds. Though
[30:06] there's need, though there's lacking,
[30:08] though there's things in your lives that
[30:10] can cause anxiety, he's saying if you're
[30:12] anxious, pray,
[30:15] our escape from the world and our
[30:16] entrance into his presence and safety is
[30:19] through that door of prayer.
[30:23] By prayer, when it said humble
[30:25] yourselves before God
[30:29] and the scriptures commanding us
[30:32] to do so, by prayer, we humble ourselves
[30:34] before God. before God. We make our
[30:36] spirits humble before him when we pray.
[30:39] That's even that's even what is meant in
[30:41] kneeling. That's even what is meant in
[30:44] the open hands or the the bowed head or
[30:47] closed eyes or even the looking up. It's
[30:49] to signify some difference that I I'm
[30:52] not running up before you pounding my
[30:54] chest saying you owe it to me. It's not
[30:58] what the Bible means. And I say it over
[30:59] and over and over again, lest we ever
[31:00] forget when we come boldly before the
[31:02] throne of grace. That boldness is the
[31:05] naked honesty
[31:07] &gt;&gt; that we need help in the time of need.
[31:09] &gt;&gt; It's not you said you said you'd do
[31:12] this. It's Lord I need you right now.
[31:15] &gt;&gt; I have need of you. And so through
[31:18] prayer we make ourselves subject to his
[31:20] presence. Our spirits even subject to
[31:22] his presence. The very Hebrew word pala
[31:25] for prayer means to fall to the ground
[31:27] in the presence of one in authority.
[31:30] You most often find the word prayer used
[31:33] even not projected towards God, but I
[31:35] pray of you. I pray of you. It's this
[31:36] request. It's this humbling to where
[31:39] you're seeking permission.
[31:43] Pray means this intervening or
[31:45] interposing
[31:47] where you are coming before the Lord and
[31:50] petitioning him.
[31:52] And prayer is not the practice of
[31:55] begging. Oh please, oh please, oh
[31:57] please. Even though there is this
[31:58] element of asking, but prayer
[32:03] puts God between you and the world.
[32:07] you and I'm hoping to minister this in
[32:10] such a way to where you feel a greater
[32:12] liberty to ask if you have anxiety, if
[32:15] you have fear, anguish, or whatever it
[32:17] is, you lack wisdom. The the very
[32:19] existence of those things can drive a
[32:21] greater wedge between you and the Lord.
[32:23] I should have known better or I don't
[32:24] have wisdom. I don't know what to do.
[32:26] And so, it can drive this wedge, but
[32:28] then so that's you and your problem and
[32:31] you can see it. But when you pray and
[32:33] you humble yourself to pray, the
[32:35] problem's still there.
[32:37] Amen. Right. Problem's still there, but
[32:39] you just put God between you and the
[32:40] problem.
[32:42] &gt;&gt; You're you're bringing God into this
[32:44] your situation to say, "Lord, I need
[32:47] help with this. I'm praying about this
[32:48] need with my children. I'm praying about
[32:50] this need in my personal life. I'm
[32:51] praying about this need. I'm asking
[32:53] earnestly. I'm giving some thought to
[32:54] this. I'm acknowledging my weakness. I'm
[32:56] acknowledging my errors or whatever it
[32:57] might be. And Lord, I need your help."
[32:59] and you're asking God to come and not
[33:01] necessarily completely do away with the
[33:03] promise, but you need a little bit of a
[33:05] hedge to where he can stand between you
[33:07] and the cares.
[33:09] &gt;&gt; And that's what praying will do. It's by
[33:12] prayer that we're able to cast our cares
[33:14] upon him. It's by prayer that you resist
[33:17] evil.
[33:18] It's by prayer that you're submitting
[33:20] yourself to God. Submit yourselves
[33:21] therefore to God in James. Resist the
[33:23] devil and he'll flee. And it's in the
[33:24] context of even asking.
[33:27] When we ask a miss and we ask to consume
[33:29] it on our own lust, there's a proper way
[33:30] to ask. And so if we submit ourselves to
[33:32] God through prayer and and we soften our
[33:34] spirit through prayer, then we can
[33:36] through prayer actually that's the means
[33:38] by which we resist the devil.
[33:41] When Daniel prayed and he didn't hear
[33:43] from the Lord, it's his prayers that
[33:45] caused a battle and the very fighting of
[33:48] the angel with those spirits and being
[33:51] withtood was prompted by his prayers. So
[33:53] even though he hadn't felt anything, his
[33:55] prayers was creating warfare because it
[33:58] activates something in God's economy.
[34:02] 1 Thessalonians 5 12 to 18.
[34:08] And we beseech you, brethren, to know
[34:10] them which labor among you. Again,
[34:12] there's this knowledge requirement.
[34:15] And are over you in the Lord, and
[34:16] admonish you, and to esteem them very
[34:19] highly in love for their work's sake. Is
[34:22] he talking about pastors there? I
[34:24] Is this pastor appreciation month? Was
[34:27] last Sunday pastor appreciation day?
[34:30] Thanks for all the cards and the
[34:32] comments.
[34:34] So, every single one of you going, I
[34:36] didn't send him a card. Every single one
[34:38] of you are thinking that.
[34:41] And so, my response is, we know and have
[34:43] been well taught that we celebrate
[34:46] pastor depreciation around here. It's
[34:49] been very effective.
[34:51] But it's saying to understand them,
[34:52] highly love them for their work's sake,
[34:54] and be at peace among yourselves. These
[34:56] are definitely some very weighty
[34:59] requirements. Now, we exhort you,
[35:00] brethren, warn them that are unruly,
[35:03] comfort the feeble-minded, support the
[35:04] weak, be patient toward all men. We
[35:07] should chew on this every Monday
[35:08] morning, right? This should be something
[35:10] that we remind ourselves instead of
[35:12] having, you know, I have one nerve left
[35:15] and you just got on the last one in our
[35:17] coffee mugs on uh Sunday morning or
[35:20] Monday morning and all those other nice
[35:21] little quips we like to have in our
[35:22] coffee mugs. This is what warn them that
[35:24] are unruly. Comfort the feeble minded.
[35:26] We might be thinking about our kids.
[35:28] This is characteristic for each one.
[35:29] Support the weak. Be patient toward all
[35:32] men. These are things that we ought to
[35:33] do. See that none render evil for evil
[35:35] unto any man. onto any man.
[35:39] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, they're they uh they
[35:42] celebrate Pride Month. We can treat them
[35:43] this way because they're they're evil."
[35:45] No, don't render evil to anybody.
[35:48] &gt;&gt; But ever follow that which is good, both
[35:49] among yourselves and to all men. Rejoice
[35:53] evermore. Pray without ceasing.
[35:57] &gt;&gt; In everything give thanks, for this is
[35:59] the will of God in Christ Jesus
[36:01] concerning you. I would say all of these
[36:04] are the will of God. But I would say
[36:07] these things are near impossible if not
[36:09] impossible without faith and prayer.
[36:12] Pray without ceasing. Where do I start,
[36:14] brother Aaron? Lord, help me to know
[36:16] them that labor among you. Lord, help me
[36:19] to be at peace among ourselves. Lord,
[36:21] help me to war recognize those that are
[36:22] unruly and how to warn them. Help me to
[36:24] comfort the feeble-minded. Lord, help me
[36:25] to support the weak. Lord, help me to be
[36:27] patient to all men. Lord, help me that I
[36:29] would not render evil for evil. but I'd
[36:32] follow that which is good, not just
[36:34] among us as believers, but to all men.
[36:36] Lord, help me to rejoice in hope, to
[36:38] rejoice ever more. Lord, thank you for
[36:40] your protection, and we can give thanks,
[36:42] but we should pray without ceasing.
[36:46] &gt;&gt; It's a requirement in the scripture to
[36:48] pray.
[36:50] We should be teaching our children how
[36:52] to pray.
[36:55] Now, I I I want to read this statement
[36:57] just the way Brother Brandham says it.
[36:59] and and it is the rising of the sun. And
[37:01] so I say this just based upon the way
[37:03] he's using this. And he's using a term I
[37:05] think that would maybe be a a farming
[37:08] term or one that would be raising
[37:09] animals. He says, "Oh church of the
[37:11] living God, we can't stand around here
[37:12] on little sugar tits that we are nursing
[37:15] around here today." In other words,
[37:16] trying to sweeten things to get
[37:18] something to nurse. He says, "We've got
[37:20] to be full and prayed up with quickening
[37:23] power until the quickening of the Holy
[37:25] Ghost. We've got to be caught away
[37:27] someday in that rapture yonder." In
[37:29] other words, we've got to be prayed up
[37:31] and full. We got to be made full and
[37:34] prayed up to rapture.
[37:37] &gt;&gt; I know sometimes in myself, I just maybe
[37:39] admit this personally that sometimes you
[37:41] could just people prayer meeting, prayer
[37:43] meeting, prayer, meeting, prayer
[37:44] meeting, and they're talking about
[37:44] praying and you realize that, you know,
[37:46] there's a point when you've prayed all
[37:47] you can pray. But we never meet come up
[37:51] to this point to where we've prayed
[37:52] enough as believers.
[37:55] Ah, well, we're done.
[37:58] Well, I read a book one time that said
[37:59] 10,000 hours and I did the math and with
[38:03] all the meals I've eaten in my life, if
[38:05] you add it all up, I've prayed 10,000
[38:07] hours and so I think I'm prayed up. No,
[38:10] when he says we've got to be full and
[38:11] prayed up, that means we're praying.
[38:15] &gt;&gt; We're in the habit and practice of
[38:16] prayer. David returned from battle one
[38:19] time and found that their tents had been
[38:20] raided, their wives and their sons and
[38:21] their children had been stolen. And
[38:23] David in that moment didn't panic. He
[38:24] went into his tent and encouraged
[38:26] himself in the Lord. What was it? The
[38:28] habit and practice of praying,
[38:31] &gt;&gt; meditating.
[38:35] Ephesians chapter 6:es 10 to18. Again,
[38:38] just going to use a a broader context
[38:40] here. Finally, my brethren, be strong in
[38:42] the Lord and in the power of his might.
[38:45] Put on the whole armor of God that you
[38:47] may be able to stand against the ws of
[38:49] the devil.
[38:50] Our defense against the tricks of the
[38:53] devil require the full armor of God.
[38:57] With some of the armor, you may be able
[38:59] to withstand some of the ws. With some
[39:02] of the armor, you may be able to
[39:03] withstand some of the devices. But it
[39:05] will take the whole armor of God to
[39:06] stand against every trick of the devil.
[39:10] For we wrestle not against flesh and
[39:11] blood, but against principalities,
[39:13] against powers, against the rulers of
[39:14] the darkness of this world, against
[39:15] spiritual wickedness in high places.
[39:17] Wherefore take unto you the whole armor
[39:20] of God, that you may be able to
[39:21] withstand in the evil day. And having
[39:24] done all to stand, stand therefore.
[39:26] It's important that we put on the whole
[39:28] armor of God to withstand in the evil
[39:30] day. Having your loins gird about with
[39:33] truth. You have must have that. And
[39:35] having on the breastplate of
[39:36] righteousness, and your feet shaw with
[39:38] the preparation of the gospel of peace.
[39:40] Above all, take in the shield of faith,
[39:42] wherewith you shall be able to quench
[39:43] all the fiery darts of the wicked, and
[39:45] take the helmet of salvation and the
[39:47] sword of the spirit, which is the word
[39:49] of God.
[39:50] &gt;&gt; That's the whole armor of God. And it
[39:53] says, "Take on the whole armor of God
[39:54] that you may be able to stand against
[39:55] the ws of the devil." See that you take
[39:57] on the whole armor of God that you may
[39:58] be able to withstand in the evil day. So
[40:00] then it describes the whole armor of
[40:01] God. And then the very next activity is
[40:03] to stand to stand to stand. And what
[40:05] does he say in verse 18? I hope you're
[40:06] looking at it. Praying always with all
[40:07] prayer and supplication in spirit.
[40:11] As if to say that the best way to take
[40:13] your stand is to pray first.
[40:16] To take your stand, know how to stand
[40:18] and where to take your stand requires
[40:20] some humility to say, "Lord, I need to
[40:22] know where to stand. Where do I stand?
[40:24] How do I make my stand?"
[40:28] So, when this soldier is dressed with
[40:29] all his armor, he's told to stand
[40:32] against the ws of the devil. When he
[40:33] goes into this greater detail, taking
[40:35] the helmet of salvation, the sword of
[40:36] the spirit, his first activity that
[40:40] describes our stand is praying always
[40:43] with all prayer and supplication in the
[40:46] spirit and watching therein with all
[40:49] perseverance and supplication for all
[40:51] saints, praying for one another.
[40:55] Was listening to the sermon statue of a
[40:56] perfect man. I think I may touch on this
[40:58] a little bit on Sunday morning. I I I
[41:02] just didn't know exactly where maybe
[41:03] these things might fit in. But brother
[41:04] Bam talks about the reason why we ask
[41:06] people to pray for us and what happens
[41:09] when other people are praying and and
[41:10] what it activates and what it does.
[41:12] Because I know we could sit around his
[41:14] sophist and be like now why should I
[41:17] pray that God gives them that job?
[41:20] Because how is my prayer going to do
[41:22] anything for God to give them that job?
[41:25] Like am I right? Some of you saying you
[41:27] don't say that out loud, brother Aaron.
[41:30] Those are the kind of things we
[41:31] verbalize anywhere, let alone in church
[41:34] with the tapes recording.
[41:36] But there's this logic thing that we
[41:38] sometimes wrestle with. Why would I even
[41:40] need to pray? Okay, well that might be
[41:42] good to debate, but God tells us to ask.
[41:45] &gt;&gt; Tells us to ask knowing that he knows
[41:48] what we have need of,
[41:49] &gt;&gt; but yet we still ask. And the benefit of
[41:52] prayer is how many times, and give me a
[41:55] real good hearty amen. Wait to say it if
[41:57] this is true. How many times have you
[41:59] found your faith encouraged and uplifted
[42:02] knowing somebody else is praying for
[42:04] your need?
[42:05] &gt;&gt; Because wherein lies the difficulty in
[42:08] receiving the very things that God wants
[42:09] to give us? Our faith, our believing,
[42:12] our acceptance. So knowing that
[42:14] somebody's praying for me relieves me
[42:18] &gt;&gt; in my hands, in my spirit to say, "Lord,
[42:20] I receive your blessing
[42:22] &gt;&gt; by faith. I take you at your word." So
[42:24] the prayer isn't up there to a God who's
[42:26] going.
[42:28] I really want to help them so bad. I
[42:31] just really Oh, wait. Hold on.
[42:34] Is that Sister Esther Walker praying?
[42:37] I think I can help them. God's up there
[42:41] wanting to help. And you have somebody,
[42:42] Brother Aaron's over there going, "It's
[42:44] pastor appreciation month."
[42:48] And you're all burdened and you're
[42:49] anxious. And somebody goes to pray and
[42:51] they say, "Brother Aaron, I'm praying
[42:52] for you. Sister, I'm praying for you. I
[42:53] know you have a difficult need. We're
[42:55] praying with you. And what does it do?
[42:56] It caus you to get a little bit more
[42:57] comfortable and you begin to feel the
[42:58] nearness of God.
[43:01] &gt;&gt; The prayers are effective. So he says,
[43:03] don't just pray, but pray always with
[43:06] all prayer and supplication in the
[43:07] spirit and watching there and to with
[43:09] all perseverance and supplication for
[43:10] all saints.
[43:12] &gt;&gt; Pray for one another. Pray for believers
[43:14] around the world. You
[43:16] &gt;&gt; realize we got it pretty easy here,
[43:17] pretty good. Even if we had a a Congress
[43:20] and Senate and president and all the
[43:22] cabinet, every single one of them were
[43:24] Democrats.
[43:26] And I know this is really hard for you
[43:27] to believe this. We still got it pretty
[43:29] good in the United States.
[43:32] &gt;&gt; There's believers in other countries
[43:33] that can't homeschool their kids. And we
[43:34] think the Antichrist has embodied
[43:36] himself in our state senator when they
[43:38] want to take away ESA funds.
[43:41] &gt;&gt; Right? Come on, somebody. And we begin
[43:44] to panic. Our Christian liberties are
[43:46] being trotten down.
[43:48] You got families in other countries that
[43:49] can't even go to church
[43:52] &gt;&gt; because of war, because of persecution.
[43:56] &gt;&gt; So instead of praying that bills are
[43:58] changed here, how about we just pray for
[44:00] saints, pray earnestly and sincerely,
[44:04] &gt;&gt; could put an Abraham Lincoln and George
[44:06] Washington in every office.
[44:08] &gt;&gt; It won't change the direction America's
[44:10] headed. Therefore, I want to take
[44:12] ownership over my field, my vineyard, my
[44:15] family, my heart, my field, the saints,
[44:17] the believers, our community of
[44:19] churches, even the Christian community
[44:21] at large in Arizona. I want to give take
[44:23] heed to the those things and not be
[44:25] caught up in the politics.
[44:28] Brother Brandham says in the sermon,
[44:29] "Thou knowest all things." He says,
[44:31] "Prayer is the most vital force that God
[44:32] ever put into the hands of mankind."
[44:36] Tells me and we say, "Oh, well, I
[44:37] thought this was vital and that was more
[44:38] powerful and this is more powerful."
[44:40] What makes the word operate? Faith.
[44:44] What loosens our faith? What gets us in
[44:46] contact with faith? What is it that
[44:48] mechanism that's going to wash our
[44:50] spirits and uh decloud our mind and
[44:52] defrag our hard drives to operate faith?
[44:55] Prayer
[44:56] &gt;&gt; is a vital force. He said it's the most
[44:59] effective force that's known to man is
[45:01] prayer. He says, "Do you believe it?" He
[45:02] goes, "It is. It's prayer that changes
[45:05] things."
[45:06] &gt;&gt; I believe prayer changes things.
[45:09] We may say, "Well, you know, I I'm
[45:11] praying for this and I'm praying for
[45:13] that." And you say, "Well, God God knows
[45:15] God knows all things. And if you need
[45:16] it, he'll give it to you. Don't need to
[45:17] pray. You don't need to pray. You don't
[45:18] need to pray." No. I believe prayer
[45:19] changes things. The Bible teaches us
[45:22] believe that's why some of these things
[45:23] exist in scripture that it looks as if
[45:26] God's changing his mind, but it teaches
[45:28] us to pray.
[45:31] Whether you are individual and I know in
[45:34] our church there's situations where
[45:36] people uh uh um do not have spouses or
[45:39] they do not have children or they have
[45:40] circumstances where they live alone and
[45:42] whatever those situations may be. It
[45:44] applies to individuals but it also
[45:46] applies to us as families. We should be
[45:48] allotting time for prayer.
[45:51] We should find a place to be alone with
[45:53] God.
[46:01] In Psalms 119:164,
[46:04] you could say, "Well, how many times,
[46:05] how often should I pray?" It says,
[46:07] "Seven times a day do I praise thee
[46:09] because of thy righteous judgments." And
[46:11] I would say that still wasn't enough.
[46:14] But here he says he did it seven times a
[46:17] day. Gave thanks, gave praise.
[46:21] It doesn't necessarily create the
[46:22] standard. You know, some of us can be so
[46:24] Catholic about it to where we just go
[46:26] ahead and we have an app that reminds us
[46:29] at just the right intervals. We just ask
[46:31] brother Chat or some may more formally
[46:34] call him Brother GPT and say, you know,
[46:37] I wake up at 7, I go to bed at 9ine,
[46:40] give me intervals by of sevens, you
[46:43] know, so I can seven times a day give
[46:45] praise to God. And you'll just have the
[46:47] praise the Lord. Amen. And it becomes
[46:51] nothing more than just the reminder to
[46:53] stand up or take a sip of water.
[46:56] But there ought to be some time
[46:58] committed to prayer. In Daniel chapter
[47:00] 6:10, now when Daniel knew that the
[47:02] writing was signed, I love it. When he
[47:03] knew that praying was going to be the
[47:05] end of him, he went into his house and
[47:07] his windows being open into his chamber
[47:08] toward Jerusalem, he closed the windows,
[47:10] hid under the bed, and wept bitterly,
[47:14] but did not make the mistake to pray,
[47:16] but merely wept, and wrote in the dust
[47:20] under the bed, "God help me. I hope you
[47:23] can be."
[47:25] No, it says he went and opened up
[47:27] kneelled upon his knees three times a
[47:29] day and prayed with the windows open and
[47:31] gave thanks before his God. And not
[47:34] guess notice this. Anybody else looking
[47:35] in the Bible? This wasn't his first time
[47:37] to do it when all of a sudden it was he
[47:39] was in trouble as he did before.
[47:42] &gt;&gt; This is what he did before. Right now
[47:45] you have an opportunity to establish a
[47:47] habit of praying with your family, with
[47:50] your children. teach them to pray
[47:53] to learn the habit and practice as an
[47:55] individual to pray. He kneled three
[47:58] times a day and prayed. Let's not try to
[48:00] do the averages. 7 + 3 divided by two is
[48:03] five. We find a happy medium between the
[48:05] psalmist and Daniel. But just pray
[48:09] time to pray. Daniel did it three times
[48:12] a day. Not just when he was in trouble,
[48:14] but even in the face of trouble. Even
[48:16] when threatened with death, he was like,
[48:17] "You know what? Now's not the time to
[48:19] stop praying. Now's the time to cash in
[48:22] on all this praying I've been doing
[48:25] &gt;&gt; because now it really matters.
[48:28] If I could say this, it's not easy to
[48:30] maintain a a the life of Christ or a
[48:33] Christian life without the regular habit
[48:34] of prayer.
[48:36] To be a Christian is to be Christlike.
[48:39] To be born again is to be a new creature
[48:41] in Christ Jesus. To have the life of
[48:43] Christ in you. And I'm saying you cannot
[48:47] be Christlike and not pray. You said
[48:50] where are you getting that from? From
[48:51] Christ.
[48:54] &gt;&gt; In Luke Mark 1:35. And in the morning
[48:57] rising up a great while before day he
[48:59] went out and departed into a solitary
[49:01] place and there prayed.
[49:05] Luke 6:12. And it came to pass in those
[49:08] days that he went out into a mountain to
[49:09] pray and continued all night in prayer
[49:12] to God. The son of God,
[49:16] the one who was sinless, without blame,
[49:19] without blemish, the one who did only
[49:21] that which the father told him to do,
[49:23] spoke only those things which the father
[49:25] told him to speak, had a habit and
[49:27] practice of praying.
[49:30] Let me say this, if you want to be like
[49:32] Christ and do it without praying, it's
[49:34] not going to work.
[49:38] &gt;&gt; There must be a prayer life. I'll say
[49:41] this, Lord willing. On Sunday, I'm going
[49:42] to address um Bible reading and reading
[49:45] our Bibles because the devil will take
[49:48] advantage of a lack of knowledge of
[49:50] scripture. He'll interpret scripture to
[49:52] you. And I believe that we should be in
[49:54] the habit and practice of being into the
[49:56] word and and and valuing the message of
[49:59] the hour. These are things that I
[50:00] believe that are important that the
[50:01] devil wants to take advantage of.
[50:04] And Jesus was in the habit and practice
[50:06] of praying. So don't think that you can
[50:10] go without prayer
[50:12] and then withstand temptation of the
[50:14] devil in the wilderness like got the
[50:17] devil's number. I've been I've been
[50:19] serving God all these years. I got this
[50:21] figured out. Ain't nothing get a hold of
[50:23] me. And next thing you know, you're shot
[50:25] with doubt and unbelief and sin. Even
[50:28] those who uh uh preached this message a
[50:32] and used gifts and those different
[50:34] things through the lack of diligence in
[50:37] what they knew were ultimately overcome
[50:39] with great wickedness.
[50:43] Luke 11:1 and it came to pass as he was
[50:45] praying in a certain place when he
[50:47] ceased one of his disciples said unto
[50:49] him Lord teach us to pray and I like
[50:51] this as John also taught his disciples.
[50:55] So it was in the nature of the spirit of
[50:56] Elijah to teach his followers to pray.
[50:58] And now Jesus with this manner and
[51:00] practice and habit of praying must have
[51:03] prayed enough to where this person said
[51:05] Lord I want to know how to pray.
[51:09] This disciple said teach us to pray.
[51:12] Must have recognized even something
[51:14] different than just the traditional
[51:16] prayers or the glory bees or the the
[51:18] Hail Marys and the different ways that
[51:20] things could become very traditional.
[51:22] He said teach us to pray. And Jesus does
[51:25] teach them to pray, but doesn't did not
[51:27] teach them a prayer. He was teaching
[51:30] them how they ought to pray.
[51:33] If you want to, the Lord's prayer is in
[51:35] John 17. That's when he's praying.
[51:38] Teaching the elements of prayer and this
[51:40] practice of humbling yourself and
[51:41] requesting of God. He teaches when he
[51:43] says, "Teach us to pray." He says,
[51:44] "After this manner, pray." And he yet
[51:47] teaches them to pray. Why? Because
[51:49] prayer is something he did. It was an
[51:50] example. Therefore, he taught it.
[51:55] In Matthew chapter 6:es 5 to8 there's
[51:58] some teaching about praying here. He
[52:00] says and when thou prayest thou shalt
[52:03] not be as the hypocrites are for they
[52:05] love to pray standing in the synagogues
[52:06] and in the corners of the streets that
[52:08] they may be seen of men. Here's that
[52:11] self-serving hypocrisy.
[52:13] You want to appear religious.
[52:16] You realize there's times when
[52:19] you can pray for somebody without them
[52:21] needing to know you're praying
[52:24] to accomplish the effectiveness of your
[52:26] prayer.
[52:28] Be careful that you're not just doing it
[52:29] because you want to be seen or because
[52:31] you want to get the attention or get the
[52:32] credit.
[52:35] He says, "Verily, I say unto you, they
[52:36] have their reward. But thou, when thou
[52:38] prayest, enter into thy closet." I say
[52:40] this to impress upon you this idea of
[52:43] prayer that is personal that is private.
[52:47] Before day he departed into a solitary
[52:49] place by himself and prayed. We called a
[52:51] prayer closet. He went into the mountain
[52:53] and continued to pray. He went to a
[52:55] certain place and prayed. So there's a
[52:58] prayer that we do publicly. There's a
[52:59] prayer that we do for each other. There
[53:00] may be a prayer that we offer in a
[53:02] particular situation. We find ourselves
[53:03] doing that. I know oftentimes in our
[53:05] family when people visit, we'll gather
[53:07] for prayer with people as they leave. Uh
[53:10] and it's a a precious time. We don't do
[53:11] it every time. If that hasn't happened
[53:13] for you, there's no judgment. But
[53:14] there's just times when we'll do that.
[53:15] We'll pray with our guests and as they
[53:17] go and and we'll do public prayer. We
[53:19] pray together as a church. We lay hands
[53:21] on the sick here at church. But that
[53:23] doesn't replace maybe this private
[53:25] prayer and this solitude. However it is
[53:27] that you could find it where you enter
[53:29] into the closet and you shut the door
[53:32] and you pray to thy father which is in
[53:34] secret.
[53:36] He says and thy father which seeth in
[53:37] secret shall reward thee openly.
[53:39] Individuals should have this. I think as
[53:41] families we could even come away from
[53:42] the things of this world. We're not
[53:45] we're not playing. We're not going to
[53:47] sit down to pray with the music playing
[53:49] and and the TV blaring and all these
[53:51] different things going on, all this hub.
[53:53] Uh, you know, you're over there on your
[53:54] phone and you're doing this. We're just
[53:56] going to pray real quick. Our Father,
[53:58] which art in heaven, hallowed be thy
[53:59] name.
[54:00] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[54:02] Quieting ourselves down. He says, then
[54:04] he says, "And when you pray, notice
[54:07] this. When you pray, it's this solitude.
[54:10] It's this quietness. And when you pray,
[54:11] use not vain repetitions as the heathen
[54:13] do."
[54:15] That means we're thinking about what
[54:16] we're saying.
[54:18] Was asked by a young man this past year
[54:20] about praying. He's prayed and reading
[54:22] your Bible. He's finding it just maybe a
[54:23] little bit difficult as a young man. I
[54:26] said, "Well, when it comes to praying,
[54:27] just as much as you're able, just have a
[54:29] conversation. Just talk about things."
[54:34] And it it's something that may seem
[54:36] awkward at first or uncomfortable, but
[54:39] that's why you do it
[54:41] &gt;&gt; and you get in the habit and the
[54:42] practice of it. And it's not just vain
[54:44] repetitions. You repeat the same prayer
[54:45] over and over again.
[54:48] Heavenly Father, bless this food. Give
[54:50] us good sleep. Amen. I knew one one
[54:53] person one time it seemed like he only
[54:56] prayed for meals and when he went to bed
[54:57] and he'd pray over the offering and say,
[54:59] "Lord, bless this food and give us a
[55:00] good night's rest when he's praying over
[55:02] the offering." Like prays twice a day or
[55:05] for food and for sleep. And so there's
[55:08] something where we we want to pray not
[55:11] just with these repetitions and these
[55:13] scripted prayers.
[55:15] For they think that they shall be heard
[55:17] for their much speaking. Be ye not
[55:19] therefore like unto them. For your
[55:20] father knoweth what things you have need
[55:21] of before you ask him. But he's still
[55:23] asking you to pray.
[55:26] &gt;&gt; We still pray knowing that he has need
[55:28] of these things. And I don't think he's
[55:29] saying that we shouldn't pray for
[55:30] something over and over and over again
[55:32] and that we shouldn't use the same word
[55:34] twice, but he's saying that your father
[55:36] knows what you need, so talk to him
[55:38] about it.
[55:39] &gt;&gt; He knows you need wisdom, but he said,
[55:41] "Ask me for wisdom and I'll give it to
[55:43] you."
[55:44] &gt;&gt; He knows you need this. Ask for it.
[55:49] &gt;&gt; Notice what I've done with my title,
[55:53] praying on ignorance.
[55:56] And it's this inaction
[55:58] to the opposite of prayer is ignoring.
[56:02] See what I did there?
[56:04] That we ought to be praying.
[56:07] And if we're praying, we're not
[56:08] ignoring. We're we're getting out of
[56:10] ignorance. And we're removing by our
[56:13] praying, it limits the devil's praying.
[56:17] In James chapter 5 13 to18, this is my
[56:20] final scripture reading here that I have
[56:22] on slides. Not that this is the final
[56:25] scripture that we could read, but this
[56:26] is the last one I have on the slide. He
[56:28] says, James 5 13 to18, "Is any among you
[56:31] afflicted? Let him pray. If there's any
[56:35] among us who are down in our spirits and
[56:38] we're in turmoil, pray.
[56:41] Is any merry? Let him sing psalms." So
[56:44] if you're afflicted,
[56:46] pray. If you're happy, vent, praise.
[56:51] Is any sick among you? Let him call for
[56:54] the elders of the church, and let them
[56:56] pray over him, anointing him with oil in
[56:58] the name of the Lord. And the prayer of
[57:01] faith shall save the sick, and the Lord
[57:04] shall raise him up, and if he have
[57:06] committed sins, they shall be forgiven
[57:08] him. Confess your faults one to another,
[57:10] and pray one for another that you may be
[57:12] healed." James teaching us to pray.
[57:17] Therefore, we ought to pray because if
[57:21] you're not praying, I trust you the
[57:22] devil is.
[57:25] He is watching, praying, looking for an
[57:28] opportunity. Praying p r e y i n g.
[57:31] Praying, right? Stalking,
[57:34] looking for an opportunity to devour, to
[57:37] attack. Therefore, we ought to be
[57:39] praying.
[57:40] We're taught to pray. And now, notice
[57:42] this. These closing thoughts to me are
[57:44] so beautiful. The effectual fervent
[57:46] prayer of a righteous man avaleth much.
[57:50] The effectual fervent prayer of a
[57:53] righteous man avaleth much.
[57:56] So our prayers are to be fervent.
[58:01] They're to be effectual
[58:04] to to come from righteous lips, a
[58:06] sincere heart. Then he gives this
[58:08] example of Elijah. Elijah was a man
[58:10] subject to like passions as we are. and
[58:13] he prayed earnestly that it might not
[58:15] rain.
[58:17] Do you realize just how
[58:21] uh you know there's I I don't I'm just
[58:24] going to describe it this way. There's
[58:25] times when you need help lifting
[58:26] something and it's not because it's
[58:27] heavy, it's just bulky. It's awkward,
[58:29] right? I think this is both heavy and
[58:32] bulky.
[58:33] What a statement. He prayed earnestly
[58:36] that it might not rain. But the Bible
[58:39] wants us to know he was a man subject to
[58:40] like passions as we are. He had need to
[58:43] eat.
[58:44] He had personal needs. He had personal
[58:46] wants. He wanted to live. He was subject
[58:49] to certain passions. There's a lot of
[58:50] libert there's a lot of grace that's
[58:52] ministered to men too in this being a
[58:54] man being weak and having this. But he
[58:56] prayed earnestly that it might not rain.
[58:58] He prayed according to the will of God.
[59:00] He prayed for something uh uh uh that
[59:03] could even affect him. But he prayed
[59:06] earnestly and it rained not on earth by
[59:07] the space of 3 years and 6 months
[59:09] because he prayed and he prayed again.
[59:13] It's a time to pray for rain. There's a
[59:15] time to pray that the rain stops. But he
[59:18] says, "And he prayed again and the
[59:19] heaven gave rain." And this is where I
[59:21] see this beautiful symmetry with our
[59:22] prayers about our gardens and our
[59:24] growing our cultivating the seed that
[59:26] we're sewing. And he gave rain and the
[59:28] earth brought forth her fruit.
[59:32] The prayers of Elijah kept the rain from
[59:35] falling. It was a demonstration of God's
[59:37] judgment. But then he prayed again and
[59:39] the heaven gave rain and the earth
[59:41] brought forth her fruit. To me, it tells
[59:43] us we being men, being women, being
[59:45] subject to like passions and having
[59:47] weaknesses. We can pray and ask God for
[59:50] the rain to make our gardens fruitful.
[59:54] That we should not let the flesh, the
[59:56] world, or the devil prey on ignorance.
[1:00:01] Therefore, we want to have a prayer of
[1:00:03] understanding or pray for wisdom.
[1:00:08] As our musicians come, prayer will
[1:00:10] soften your soil.
[1:00:13] Prayer will feed your experience.
[1:00:16] Prayer not only protects you, but it'll
[1:00:18] protect your family.
[1:00:21] Ignoring God by not praying, he said,
[1:00:23] "How do we ignore God by not praying?"
[1:00:25] He said, "How do how is it you how is it
[1:00:27] we've robbed you?" He said by not
[1:00:29] paying.
[1:00:31] So how is it that we ignore God? By not
[1:00:34] praying.
[1:00:36] To ignore God is to not to is not to say
[1:00:40] I don't believe in God. It's to not
[1:00:42] pray. And ignoring God by not praying
[1:00:45] makes us vulnerable to doubt.
[1:00:50] I hope you're thinking about it.
[1:00:52] When we're not praying, we become more
[1:00:54] susceptible to the seeds of doubt.
[1:00:57] we become more vulnerable to temptation.
[1:01:00] Each of us as individuals should pray
[1:01:03] and if we have any stewardship within a
[1:01:05] family even through if we have believing
[1:01:08] uh employee uh employees or if we have
[1:01:11] uh opportunities to teach others
[1:01:13] especially within our families and our
[1:01:14] children even grandparents can pray with
[1:01:16] grandchildren. We should be prayer
[1:01:18] praying and as much as is possible be
[1:01:21] prayer warriors. We may not be able to
[1:01:22] be the warriors like David and be
[1:01:24] warriors like Joshua.
[1:01:26] You know the I joked with my wife one
[1:01:28] time. Brother Brandham preached the
[1:01:29] great warrior Joshua and the great
[1:01:31] warrior David. And I said the great
[1:01:32] warrior Elizabeth.
[1:01:35] Because we can worry, we can fear. But
[1:01:36] how is it we can fight? Pray.
[1:01:39] We're told so many times you just need
[1:01:41] to pull the sword. Fight. Fight. Fight.
[1:01:43] Fight. And we're like, well then how can
[1:01:44] I fight? How can I give the black devil
[1:01:45] a black eye? Pray.
[1:01:49] The prayer faith. Believe. That's
[1:01:51] fighting. That's an atomic weapon.
[1:01:53] That's a vital force. So in this
[1:01:55] subject, I'm admonishing our church and
[1:01:58] wanting to remind us and teach that we
[1:02:01] should be praying more. And there's a
[1:02:04] pattern with people who fall in sin.
[1:02:07] There's a pattern with those who fall
[1:02:09] away. They lack prayer.
[1:02:14] Let's stand to our feet this evening.
[1:02:19] I have an idea. Let's pray.
[1:02:22] Pray together with me in your own way.
[1:02:26] Our gracious heavenly father
[1:02:31] tonight. Lord, we bow our heads and our
[1:02:33] hearts and we consider this opportunity
[1:02:35] to be one of the greatest privileges a
[1:02:36] mortal man has ever had. For Lord, we're
[1:02:39] not just bowing our heads to the dust.
[1:02:42] Lord, we're not just looking at our toes
[1:02:43] or projecting our voice to the earth,
[1:02:45] but we're speaking face to face with
[1:02:48] you. What a privilege, Father. With this
[1:02:52] privilege, I'm asking specifically
[1:02:53] tonight
[1:02:55] that if any lack wisdom, we ask for
[1:02:58] wisdom. Lord, if I lack prayer, I ask
[1:03:01] for a prayer life. If I lack
[1:03:04] understanding, give me understanding.
[1:03:05] That which I lack, Lord, I pray for it.
[1:03:09] And Lord, for my children and for those
[1:03:11] sheep here and for the believers in this
[1:03:13] church, my prayer is
[1:03:15] [Music]
[1:03:16] that we could become more prayerful
[1:03:19] for one another.
[1:03:21] to be more sensitive, to be perseverant,
[1:03:23] to be looking out upon the needs of
[1:03:24] others.
[1:03:26] Lord, I just got to be honest. Lord, I I
[1:03:28] wrestle with my own experiences in life
[1:03:30] through the abuses I've suffered through
[1:03:32] the wrong kind of authority figures. And
[1:03:35] Lord, the distaste I have for the
[1:03:36] nickelan spirit and pastors who've
[1:03:40] dominated the sheep and just abused the
[1:03:42] church.
[1:03:45] Lord, I I never want to create a an
[1:03:47] unsafe, negative dynamic at church.
[1:03:50] Lord, if that's caused me to be a little
[1:03:52] bit more distant and hands off, if that
[1:03:55] has caused any lack of closeness, Lord,
[1:03:57] forgive me.
[1:03:59] So, Lord, maybe through prayer, we could
[1:04:01] just draw closer together and gain more
[1:04:03] of a family feel and community because
[1:04:06] then we can be more sensitive to what
[1:04:07] others are going through and find more
[1:04:09] opportunities to be in fellowship and
[1:04:11] promote that family that we ought to
[1:04:13] have. Lord, there's people here who've
[1:04:14] lost loved ones and they're on their own
[1:04:16] and they have separation and they have
[1:04:18] no fellowship. Lord, let us not be so
[1:04:20] busy with our own lives that we don't
[1:04:23] provide that fellowship that we ought to
[1:04:25] as a church.
[1:04:27] And Lord, I believe it's prayer that'll
[1:04:28] help us to be kindly affectionate to one
[1:04:30] another in brotherly love. Prayer will
[1:04:32] soften our soil
[1:04:35] through prayer. Lord, brother Bram talks
[1:04:37] so often about when you have something
[1:04:38] against somebody else, just take them
[1:04:39] before the Lord in prayer and your
[1:04:41] attitude towards them will change. And
[1:04:43] Lord, if I just started praying for this
[1:04:45] brother and that sister and this need
[1:04:46] and that need, maybe something comes
[1:04:48] upon my heart and I realize, "Oh, wow.
[1:04:51] We could do this
[1:04:53] or this is what they need. Maybe I'll
[1:04:55] just reach out and let them know."
[1:04:58] Lord, I'm reminded one time where a
[1:04:59] sister was at her wit's end and just
[1:05:02] maybe it was a brother rather. It was
[1:05:04] brother Middleton was just at his end
[1:05:06] and he said, "Oh God,
[1:05:09] if you love me, have brother Tim call me
[1:05:12] right now and tell me that you love me."
[1:05:14] And brother Tim Puit, for whatever
[1:05:16] reason, he didn't know just at that very
[1:05:18] moment picked up the phone and called
[1:05:22] said, "Brother Middleton, the Lord loves
[1:05:24] you."
[1:05:26] Lord, it it counts to pray.
[1:05:30] And Lord, I see those who've wandered
[1:05:32] far from you and there's this pattern of
[1:05:34] a lack of prayer.
[1:05:37] Oh, maybe it's not true with everyone
[1:05:39] that they didn't pray. Some may be just
[1:05:41] very,
[1:05:44] you know, active in a prayer life, Lord,
[1:05:46] because these things just aren't cookie
[1:05:48] cutter. But Lord, let it not be said of
[1:05:49] us as a church that we didn't teach
[1:05:51] prayer. We didn't demonstrate prayer in
[1:05:53] our homes. that we didn't give that
[1:05:55] habit of praying and that example as
[1:05:57] Christ gave. So, Father, teach us to
[1:06:00] pray. Help us where we're weak.
[1:06:02] Ask that you bless this church now.
[1:06:06] Bless those that are traveling in Jesus
[1:06:08] name.
[1:06:09] Amen.
[1:06:10] [Music]
