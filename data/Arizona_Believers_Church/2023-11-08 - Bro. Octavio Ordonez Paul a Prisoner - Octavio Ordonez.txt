TRANSCRIPT
========================================
now if we can go a little bit into uh the Apostle Paul now the Apostle Paul was a tremendous man um he he as a young man he he wanted to serve the Lord and I think it's a A fitting for today uh as a young man he wanted to to serve the Lord he did everything he could to serve the Lord uh he went to the best schools his parents paid for the best education he could have and uh he was a a good man and he did everything that he could according to what he knew at the time right he he was a man of God back then for what he knew at that time doing the best he can trying to learn everything he could about the word of God right he was taught under the best teachers at the time the teacher was gel or pronounced something like that he was a tremendous man right and and no one uh or put it this way when when he graduated or when he finished he finished at the age of about 35 years old but he started studying at the age of about 10 to 12 years old and he studied for all that time and when he was ready he uh he thought well now I'm going to go serve the Lord so he went out and got instructions by the Pharisees by the priests at that time to go out and and serve the Lord but he was a he was an error right but he didn't know right that's the problem that he didn't know he was in error now we all have a opportunity to serve the Lord we can say We'll serve him or we won't serve him right we have something that's called the free moral agency imagine that free moral agency I think those are really good words you are free to say yes or you are free to say no God's not going to make you serve him you have an opportunity to say yes I'll serve him or no I'll stay where I'm at Adam and Eve had the same opportunity Adam and Eve were just doing just spine right until Eve made the wrong decision right and it threw the whole world into chaos the whole world lost because of Adam and Eve they had an opportunity to stay with the word but instead they chose not to they chose to doubt the word and when they doubted the word it threw everybody out right threw the whole bath water out the door they had an opportunity as as just as each and every one of us has an opportunity this evening to serve the Lord or to criticize right we have an opportunity to learn or to say well I know that already what are you teaching me I'm not teaching you anything anything I'm just reviewing to you what the word says the word says that we have that opportunity today every young man every young woman has an opportunity to serve the Lord now we see the world situation right now we see it's getting pretty rough out there so we don't know how much time we have so that's the opportunity that we have today is to uh serve the Lord if we want to or not now let me give you a little bit of history of the Apostle Paul I'm sure most of us already know the Apostle Paul when he served the Lord he he actually had to be thrown out of the synagogues he was beaten up he was left for dead outside he shook it all off he went back inside he was thrown in jail for two years without being charged for anything he was Shipwrecked he was bitten by a Viper and he was sent over to Rome and he had to sit there for years and years and years and at one time he decided to write to filimon filimon filimon you know they they made fun of brother BR when he said that word in that message you can hear that they made fun of them oh boy he better be careful amen and uh anyway where was I uh he he was a prisoner okay and uh when he wrote that letter he said I'm a prisoner of Jesus Christ right he was in jail everything seemed like that was the end for him and yet he didn't worry about those things brother Bram says it was him that was in prison for Jesus Christ right he was in prison for the Lord he could not move he could not do anything unless the Lord told them what to do right isn't that something where we ourselves can throw away our own thoughts our own beliefs our own wants our own desires and do the will of God isn't that something if we can learn from the Apostle Paul for what he did and what he said now let's let's take a look at the Apostle Paul before he was converted then we'll look at when he was converted and then we'll look at what he did after he was converted this was a tremendous man this is a new testament Apostle New Testament Star right this isn't just an ordinary person this was a man of God right but how did he start out he as well as much as we know right now is that he he was taught by the best of the best right we know that we have a free moral agency with whether we want to serve God or not serve god so let's let's look at something here and slide two uh Joshua 24:15 I kind of like what it says here and if it seemed evil unto you to serve the Lord choose you this day whom ye will serve oh isn't that something where the gods which are your fathers serve that were on the other side of the flood or the gods of the amorites in whose land ye dwell but as for me and my house we will serve the Lord isn't that something you have to make that choice you have that free moral agency to serve the Lord slide three now we're all born a free moral agent to make any decision that we wish to God justly does that because he must put every man in the same basis or he put the wrong man on he put the first man on the wrong basis that he put a free moral agency let me read that again he put the first man on the wrong basis that he put on the free moral agency see we're just exactly tonight like Adam and Eve there's no different right and wrong sets before either one of us either one of us has a decision to make are you serving the lord or you're not going to serve the Lord there is no difference right and wrong set before either one of us life and death we can make our choice it's up to you to make it see that's the way Adam and Eve did and see and they made the wrong choice and now by that put the whole race of the human race under death and penalty of death and then God came down in the form of man and took that death and paid the penalty of death that the his subjects that desired to be free could go free you can go free everyone that desires to go free can go free amen now and let's look at uh Hebrews chapter 12 verse 1 and two wherefore seeing we also are comass about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and every sin which does so easily besch us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of for Faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and sit down at the right hand of the Throne of God Amen as I just expressed if your light will prove your life will prove exactly what sight you're on I don't care what sight you say you're on Amen what you do every day proves what you are you've heard of of the old saying your life is so loud I can't hear your testimony oh isn't that something a prisoner Paul a prisoner of Jesus Christ you know I just came back from Mexico on on Monday and uh we were at the border and we were stopped on this side of the Border thank God right and the the took us off the car at the at the customs and they searched all my car and they put us in a room about this size room and I thought wow isn't that something I get a taste of being a prisoner for Jesus Christ we couldn't get out the guys on the outside had guns they were looking through my car I go man if these guys guys want to they can keep us here for hours yeah so we better behave so we didn't we didn't say nothing we just kept calm after waiting three hours in line we had to wait another half hour there while they searched our car I thought well I guess I get a little taste of what the Apostle Paul was was talking about we were in prison it wasn't prison but it's close for preaching the word of God in Mexico and on the way back our own country held us up I thought that is so something no that is interesting imagine that uh it's supposed to be a free country but our liberties are so fine that they can be taken away so fast I mean we're not getting our churches burn like India or China or other countries I mean they are really suffering right but maybe one day we'll be like that I don't know I don't know we will but let me tell you the greatest stumbling block in the church is what people that say they're Christians when they're not that's right when you go before other people and you say yeah I'm a Christian and they see your actions they go well maybe I don't go to that church I'll go to this other church that's the biggest stumbling block and that's what brother BR says so the greatest stumbling block that the world has got is a man or a woman who professes to be a Christian at least live something different from the profession oh my slide number eight now the disappointments will come at the Judgment Now The Sinner the Bootlegger The Gambler the adulterous he won't be disappointed to hear his sentence read to depart into Everlasting fire he won't be disappointed but that fellow who is trying to hide himself behind some kind of a church profession that's the boy is going to be disappointed oh at the Judgment Day amen I got I got three bottles here we got plenty of time the one that keeps thinking he's a Christian but is not living the life worthy of a Christian is the one that's going to be disappointed isn't that something that professes to be a Christian and live some other way it'd be better for him that he never did even make any kind of professions started off than to start and live something different because he's the greatest stumbling block we got is for the professor that says that he is a Christian and live something different [Music] amen always don't judge your life by how much power you have to perform miracles and we don't judge ourselves by how much knowledge you have of the word but always judge yourself look back and take inventory of what kind of fruits that life you presently live in now is buing now you can have two masters if you have two masters you're going to have one upset and the other one be happy brother baham says on Matthew 26 or 6:24 no man can serve two masters for he either will hate one and love the other or else he will hold to one and despise the other you cannot serve God and Mamon what is the reflection of your life what has It produced the reflection of your life what has It produced there's an old story of brother br says a a child that was real humble uh background and he comes to his grandma's house he had never seen himself clearly cuz he never seen a mirror before and he finally sees H himself on a mirror he looks wow there's another person over there and he looks again and wow that's that's another person there and it gets closer and his grandma and his mom are looking at him and he goes well that's me yeah that's the mirror and that shows who he is what's our mirror yeah amen our mirror is the word that's the one we have to look at we don't look at each other and see well I'm better than you or I'm better than you we look at the word to see who we represent we represent Jesus Christ are we trying to live a life worthy of the Gospel amen amen and anyways I was in Mexico and uh uh we were there and there was a there was a quite a few pastors there it was uh pretty unusual there's a lot of pastors there and our aimen Corner was really loud so I want to hear a really loud Amen Corner okay uh it was a real kind of small church and the a corner was really loud and we really got uh my interpreter and I we really got uh carried away a little bit we had a really good time in Mexico Mexico has a a a really uh unusual pool the pool in Mexico is so strong there's so many humble people that want to just hear anything of the word of God want to hear anything of this message that they can get a hold of and and the pool is so strong and the people are so humble and man the things that you see over there are tremendous uh over there uh the brothers wanted to go walk a couple of blocks to the park and the owner of the house said no don't you do that don't don't you have to have someone take you over there cu the streets if they don't see that you're from there they'll stop you and and they'll get on your case you don't ever want to go out there at night walking from one corner of the street to to the other isn't that something and here we have so much Liberty it's it's so much nicer than Mexico that you just take a lot of stuff for for advantage or or just the thinking that it's normal yeah but in Mexico that's not normal normal is is not heard of over there uh I've been there a couple of times this year in Mexico City and oh my it is so tough over there it is so tough uh the people have so much struggles over there that we here in the United States are so spoiled uh that we have so much of everything anyways um the Apostle Paul he he starts off his his ministry by going after the Christians he goes after U uh someone called Steve and uh in chapter 6 of Acts they they elected the uh the first deacons how many know how many young men how many deacons did they choose how many deacons did they choose seven that's right on the on the book of Acts chapter 6 they elected seven deacons and the first Deacon men mention is stepen Steven was a man filled of the Holy Spirit and power of God and he came and he started preaching to them and they got him right away they got him right away said nope nope let's get him let's get him and they brought him to the council the the the ministers there in chapter 7 they brought him to him and when they brought him to that Council let's look at it real quick this is a really good story so you can get an idea of the Apostle Paul what he did when he started his ministry and you'll be surprised what he did when uh when he started and what he consented to uh the Apostle Paul on the end of chapter 6 um well let's look at chapter 6:8 and stepen full of faith and power did great wonders and Miracles among the people they should have when they saw that they should have said w we want some of that but in saying instead of saying we want some of that no we're going to take you to the council so and verse 15 he said and all that sat in the council looking steadfastly on him saw his face and that and it had been the face of an Angel imagine that he he was full of the Holy Spirit did wonders face of an Angel and he was taken to to the councel in chapter 7 he preached to them from the beginning and he brought them all the way through to the end and after he talked to him about all these things if you look at verse uh 49 um chapter 7 verse 49 uh let's go to 51 listen to what Stephen said ye stiff neck and uncircumcised in heart and ears ye do always resist the Holy Ghost as your fathers did so do ye which the prophets have not your fathers persecuted and they have slain them which showed before of the coming of the just one of whom ye have been now the betrayers and murderers oh he was accusing them so what did they do they grabbed him threw him out of the city and they stoned him to the and who was there watching everything the Apostle Paul at that time he was called sa and he consented to their death that's the beginning of oh the Apostle Paul a man of God trying to serve God trying to do the best that he could for God and yet doing everything wrong a man of God thinking he's doing God a service and yet he was absolutely wrong isn't that something the Apostle Paul on chapter nine is when God finally gets a hold of them and God finally gets a hold of this man so we see what he was what he did what he consented to but now let's see when God gets a hold of him God gets a hold of this man in chapter n we could read the whole chapter it be nice but let's let's get a a background here and sa yet uh breathing out threatenings and Slanders against the Disciples of the Lord went unto the high priest and desired of him letters to Damascus to the synagogues that if he found any of of this way whether they were men or women he might bring them bound unto Jerusalem man he was after these Christians and he journeyed he came near Damascus and suddenly there shined round about him a light from Heaven oh my man and he fell on the earth and heard a voice saying unto him sa sa why persecuted thou me that's where the saying comes they knocked them off his high horse they knocked them off his ice horse God knocked them off his ice horse thinking he's doing God a service thinking he had authority to go after these Christians thinking he was a a Top Gun Man God had to knock him off his high horse a man thinking he's doing God a service suddenly realize who was God he finally realized whoa imagine thinking you're doing something right all your life you study you you do everything you can and all of a something after 30s something years to find out you were wrong but yet God having the mercy and the grace to show you you were wrong wow that's that's something that must have been a real change brother that must have really changed his Outlook to realize that you are messed up that you really messed up you killed these people you persecuted the people you persecuted the people you wanted to be like you persecuted the people you wanted to be like the people that had the holy spirit that you were after you were persecuted and to know that is something else so what did he do he fell on the earth and heard a voice saying unto him sa sa why persecutest thou me and he said who art thou Lord and the Lord said I am Jesus whom thou persecuted it is hard for thee to kick against the Pricks now listen it says he says I am Jesus and you're persecuting me right we don't well he wasn't persecuting Jesus as a person but he was persecuting the holy spirit that was in the people he was persecuting so then he was persecuting Jesus Christ through the people is that something yes and he said who art thou Lord and the Lord said I am Jesus whom thou persecutors it is hard for you to K against the PRS and he trembling and astonished and said Lord what will thou have me do and the Lord said unto him arise and go into the City and it shall be told thee what thou shall all must do and the man which journeyed with him stood speechless hearing a voice but seeing no man and sa arose from the earth and when his eyes were open he saw no man but they let him by the hand and brought him into de ascus and he was three days without sight and neither did eat nor drink what do you think he thought of for those three days yeah when I crucified or I I bound this person I had that person killed I did this I did that I studied all my life I've done this I've done that and all this time it was Jesus Christ and all the these people isn't that something and there was a certain disciple at at Damascus named ananas and to him said Lord in a vision ananas and he said behold I am here Lord and the Lord said unto him arise and go into the street which is called straight and chir in the house of Judas for one called Saul of Tarsus and for behold he prayeth and he seen a vision and a man named ananas coming in and putting his hands on him that he might receive a sight you know we we uh talk a lot about uh laying hands on people it is scriptural it's mentioned quite a few times about laying your hands on people even anointing people uh that is scriptural that is done that is normal to do if someone has a need you should lay hands on him and pray for him it is done throughout the scriptures then ananas answered Lord I have heard of many of this man how much evil he has done to thy Saints at Jerusalem and here he has Authority from the Chief priest to bind all that call on thy name but the Lord said unto him go thy way for he is a chosen vessel unto me to Bear my name before the Gentiles and kings and children of Israel for I will show him how great things he must suffer for my name's sake and anas went his way and entered into the the house and putting his hands on him said brother sa the Lord even Jesus that appeared unto thee in thy way as thou camest has sent me that thou mightest receive thy sight and be filled with the Holy Ghost amen and immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scales and he received sight for with and arose and was baptized and when he had received meat he was strengthened then Saul was C uh certain days with the disciples which were in Damascus and straightway he preached Christ in the synagogues that he is the Son of God he went and started preaching the word of God now what did he do after that now he became a great man he went to Asia for three and a half years or Arabia for three and a half years and he studied to make sure what he had seen was the word of God he studied he he he went through the the scriptures that he had and he made sure it was the word of God he wasn't going to make the same mistake twice he was going to go preach the word of God and now according to the vision he had seen according to his testimony and according to the word of God now that it was revealed to him what was the word of God and what did that produce what did Paul produce when he was transformed when he was changed when God touched them when he the word of God was revealed to him what did it produce let's go to Galatians chapter 1 verse 8 he was so sure of his experience he was so sure where he was standing now that he himself wrote this but thou uh but though we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that which we than which we have preached unto you let him be a curse he was so sure of his experience he was so sure of his word and he said anyone that preaches contrary to what I say let him be a curse yeah wow what a change what a change what a man he changed the whole world Paul changed the whole world from his experience his studying and he came back boldly and said no one else tells you anything contrary to what I say man that is something now what are the fruits of that Spirit chapter five uh what's the fruits of those Spirit of the Holy Spirit uh verse 22 but the fruits of the holy spirit is joy is love joy peace longsuffering gentleness godliness Faith meekness Temperance against such there is no law and they that are Christ have crucified the flesh with the affection of and lust if we live in the spirit let us us walk also in the spirit let us not be desirous of vain Glory provoking one another envying one another so not only that but he told you what the fruits of the spirit are now what did Paul do if you have a scoffield Bible study Bible uh not only did he know where he stood and he told everyone that anyone that says contrary what I say let him be a curse but he also wrote most of the New Testament and in the scopio and the Epistles of the Apostle Paul we have the chronological order of Paul's Epistles is believed to be as follows first and 2 Thessalonians 1 and 2 Corinthians Galatians Romans filimon Colossians if Ephesians Philippians First Timothy Titus second Timothy even Hebrews he went and he wrote all these things that we ourself base our faith on his writings a tremendous man of God that we cannot uh contradict contradict we have to go with what he said he was a tremendous man of God why because God had mercy on him God showed him and God taught him and gave him the word of God he was a tremendous man of God by the grace of God he was a prisoner of Jesus Christ each one of us has an opportunity to be the Son of God each one of us has an opportunity to say I'll serve him or I won't serve him each one of us um let let me uh read to you some quotes of brother Braham because if we read some quotes of brother Braham we're going to be all right uh brother Braham was another prophet of God see the Apostle Paul was the first church Not only was he the first church but he produced the first bride you know that it brother or the Apostle Paul produced the first bright in the vision of of the bright if you remember that Vision the Apostle Paul saw a vision of the bright to his left side that was the first bride then he saw all the other Brides that were really badly dressed they were they weren't very good all through the church ages and then at the end he saw the bride again yeah so you have the bride and the first church age the first star the first messenger the first bride now we ourselves supposed to go back to what the first Believers beli right amen if that produce the bright then we're supposed to produce the bright in our age yes I hope that me makes sense so the Apostle Paul wasn't just another man he was a man of God a servant of God and the messenger for us today is brother Brandon and he we we trust and believe that he was a messenger for our time and that is a message that's going to straighten us out and bring us back to the faith of the fathers amen I just um let me get a couple of quotes here slide 15 another little quotation we might drop in here you see as they make fun of the church they're not really making fun of the church they're making fun of Jesus why persecutes thou me how could Paul then with all his intellect believe that this was that this group that he was persecuting was the very God that he claimed to be serving I think that's without going into details I think we're all well trained enough to know what I mean here the same thing is happening today the same thing is happening to the message Believers today they're making fun of us but it's all right let them make fun of us uh there'll be a bright [Music] ready and this message is the only message that will produce that bright yes slide 16 Paul through ignorance was yet intelligent and smart much smarter than those uneducated galileans that he was persecuted they had already in their humility accepted this man as Lord but Paul in his great teaching and his great intellectuals could not accept that and what a turnaround it must have been to him on this road that he was stricken blind and he would not carry out his commission but was led down to a place in the street called straight in the house of one and then come the prophet down there by the name of ananas who saw in a vision coming down saw where he was at went down to where he was and went in and said brother sa the Lord appeared unto you on the road down sent me that I may might lay my hands upon you and you receive your sight and be filled with the Holy Ghost SL 17 see where he was what a thing it must have been for Paul see all that he had been trained to do was vice versa wow imagine that so now with all the education he had in it was just become not to him before he has experienced he was now this is me okay before his experience he was like Pharaoh he saw slaves a bunch of mud dobbers that's actually that's I got that from Brother Bram but after his experience he saw them as children of God bunch of nobody's and then whoa these are the ones I want to be like that is something uh and see let's go to slide 18 now he had to become in prison or something a prisoner so after comparing it and seeing no wonder he could write the book of Hebrews and type see there see 3 years and and a half down there laying in the word and finding out that the very God that he called him was taking him back and changing all of his inct changing all that he had ever thought all that he trained to be all of his ambition just wiped it all away wiped it away from him he became a prisoner the love of God had been so tremendous a and such a revelation that he could not get away from it he could not get away from that Revelation that's the true experience in every real believer who meets God you come in contact with something that's so great that you that you become a prisoner through everything else you get away from everything to imprison yourself to this every born again believer can turn back and say on this day the Lord touched me and changed me and I haven't been the same and I can't be the same anymore the Lord has touched me and filled me the Holy Spirit and from that day on I cannot do what I used to do and that was what Paul could always turn back to and realize that he could not be what he used to be every true Born Again believer has that experience one day in their life one day that he can say from this day I'm over here from that day back they're gone it's history it's forgiven it's under the blood from this day on I'm going to serve the Lord that's the way it is for everyone that decides to serve the Lord every one of us who have decided to serve serve the Lord can say I'm saved I'm under the blood the day I gave my heart to Jesus Christ that's the day I got baptized and I decided to serve him and from that day on everything is under the blood everything and from that day on forward I'm saving the Lord and one day may be that day or somewhere in the future the Lord's going to touch me and change my life he's going to change my life and I'll never be the same maybe you'll be another Paul maybe you'll be another uh Branham I don't know whatever you are whatever you do maybe you'll be another Pastor another Minister another Deacon whatever the Lord has for you you do the best you can it's whatever God has for you I'll tell you what I never planned to be a pastor that's for sure and that was this last thing on my mind but whatever God puts before you you do the best that you can that's all that God requires you do the best you can with what you have the abilities that he's giving you you put it before the Lord and he'll take care of the rest from the day you decide to serve the Lord there is no greater decision you can make than to serve the Lord it's a free moral agency he will not make you do anything if you desire not to serve the Lord you don't want to serve the Lord that's between you and God but the day you decide to serve the Lord that's the day that's the day you'll always remember I remember the day I got baptized I remember the when the Lord first touched me the first time I remember a lot of things in my history but the many main thing that I remember is when I got baptized that's the day you will not forget by the grace of God you will not forget that day that you decided to serve the Lord amen Matthew 13:45 46 again the Kingdom of Heaven is like unto a merchant man seeking Godly pearls goodly pearls who when he had found one pearl of great price went and sold all that he had and bought it and that's the way it is with us we can hear a lot of things we can hear a lot of messages we can hear of a lot of faiths a lot of churches a lot of of Ministries but when we hear this message this message changed our lives this message brought us to the word this message gave us that Revelation that understanding of the word of God of what God really wants from us we could have been in the any denomination you name but when you heard this message it made you just leave everything else behind cuz this message is nothing better out there than the message of the hour there's nothing that's going to take you to the feet of Jesus Christ like this message is going to take you right amen Amen brother Bram says we become harnessed we become hooked yeah we become yolked to God he becomes a part of us we become a part of him we cannot move from that word we cannot do anything contrary to that word because we're yoked to him we're we're tied to him he is a part of us we're a part of him he will not let us go as long as we stay with that word yes stay with that word it's not what I think it's not what I uh I think is better not anything else but it's the word God will only back up his word he will not back up your feelings he will not back up your theology he will not back up anything else other than his word amen if it's written in his word you can be rest assured it will be fulfilled you are yoked with God Amen uh just a couple of things here uh this ISS uh slide 22 listen to this as brother B says God is looking for prisoners yes God is looking for prisoners he's always done it you might search it through the scripture a man has to be a prisoner to Christ against anything a man has to be a prisoner to Christ against anything therefore you cannot be connected with anything but Christ even your father your mother your brother your sister your husband your wife anybody you're only connected with Christ and him only then God can use you until then you can't if you're connect connected to your wife you're connected to your husband connected to anyone else God can't use you but when you're connected to Christ then he can use you is that something amen well I appreciate that you you let me be here this evening it's a very special day yes and we thank the Lord uh for a grandson that wants to get baptized um it says a lot for the family uh or his parents are are teaching them well and um I think the the church is teaching them well too it's uh very well I don't think there's anything better than to have your children your grandchildren serve the Lord there's nothing better than that amen you can be the poorest men in the world as long as you're serving the lord yes we're good anything else can happen but at the end of the road you know we're we're going to be fine so I thank the Lord that that he has decided to serve the Lord and uh uh you young man every time we have a baptism in our church we always call out to see if there's any other uh persons that like to get baptized uh we just had two baptisms on Sunday and uh we're supposed to have another baptism this Friday and uh that's great anytime you can get people baptized to want to serve the Lord uh there's something good going on in the church yes amen amen would you please stand for a word of Prayer
