TRANSCRIPT
========================================
tonight I want to uh use for a subject fundamental people with Pentecostal Faith fundamental people with Pentecostal faith and I kind of changed it around from How The Prophet said it but I want to read to you what he said you know uh in in in the message he says how much faith can you use he say the trouble of it is that I found I said the other night two different classes of people amen two different classes of people now he's talking about in this journey of preaching and going to different churches now I I I don't necessarily want to talk about by the grace of God where we say there's three kinds of Believers amen or three kinds of people in the church there's a a Believer a make believer amen and there's are regular unbeliever but the prophet was talking about in his journey of the church and what he sees people trying to serve God and he said I see two different classes of people one of them is fundamental positionally they know what they are the next is Pentecostals the fundament fundamentalist and the Pentecostals the Pentecostals have faith the fundamentalist has the position of Truth amen so the question we ask is what category do you fit in amen because he said there's two kinds of people one is the fundamental believer amen what is a fundamental believer that's somebody who knows the law Hallelujah they know the law they know everything the prophet preach they can quote it they can quote it left and right but it's it's it's it's it's not alive to that person you know it's per se it's just a bunch of Dos and don't you know I'm going to do this because the prophet said so I'm not going to do this because the prophet said so and you know that won't get you no way in Christ Hallelujah because eventually amen you may have a bad day and you just might not feel like doing it hallelujah how many of us been saved a while and and sometimes you have days where you just don't feel good about Hallelujah Christianity you know but a fundamental believer Hallelujah they can serve god with no feeling in it they can do everything they can dress right they can look right they can pay TI they can do all these things with no feeling in it Hallelujah but the prophet of God said amen that that's the kind of people that are in the church fundamental Hallelujah with fundamental people hallelujah but there's a people also in the church Hallelujah that have Pentecostal Faith amen and what do you mean brother J by across the faith Hallelujah somebody in the church Hallelujah that can believe what God did in the book of Acts hallelujah oh let's just go back to the prophet like like uh uh the the the fundamentals they'll look at the message of the hour and all they want is Miracles give me a vision Give Me A Sign give me this give me that Hallelujah and once they get that they go back to their own R in life right y'all know me I'm just brother DS hallelujah hallelujah and you know church he said these are the two kinds of people I see he said but look he says now but the fundamentalist doesn't have any faith to operate hallelujah what they believe oh my think about that church there are people who believe what you believe but they ain't got no faith to make it live right that's a sad place to be in for to come and vindicate his word and do such a powerful out show of his grace and all we can do is quote what the prophet said all we can do is go back to what God did in his life it has to be more than that Hallelujah don't want to hold you too long Hallelujah it has to be more than just us conquering up things that we' seen in a prophet's life Hallelujah but it has to be real unto the individual Hallelujah Church the prophet of God said he said in one place the reason why they walked the 70 walked away from Jesus was because they didn't see themselves as a part of the [Music] ministry oh my you know I've been lately I've been um preaching and you know we believe we got truth right amen and we didn't had Truth for years and you know it kind of baffles me a little bit just to get up and preach and you preach the word of God and people stare at you it's it's it's you know it's just the time we in you know I used to just preach through it and and Hammer demons but Church we're further alone we should be able to to agree with the word hallelujah amen God is not in a nodding business so by the grace of God you're going to see I've been I've lately this is what I've been doing I've been preaching but I've been helping you help [Laughter] me is God good amen I said is God good amen has he been good to you am is God a Healer is God a savior is he an ontime God Amen praise so you can say Amen praise the Lord hallelujah but you know church when we look Hallelujah when we look at the goodness of God how many of us appreciate what he's done for us hallelujah he said look he said the Pentecostals he said he said the fundamentalist Hallelujah doesn't have any faith to operate what they believe who does that sound like that sounds like the Sadducees and Pharisees because fundamentally they knew the word fundamentally they dress right they look right you couldn't put a a a finger on their lives but when Jesus came they couldn't Hallelujah identify the word they couldn't identify let me say it like this the operation of the word hallelujah because they knew the word but they couldn't believe it could operate in flesh like that wa oh my church that's what's been restored unto us the operation of the word in flesh we not only got truth but we got Vindication I'm kind of I hope you see what I'm doing by the grace of God I'm showing you that in our day those two should come to a blending Hallelujah we are fundamental people who will live by thus say the Lord who will live right who will obey the scriptures but what good is that if we don't have no Vindication we just Sadducees and Pharisees cuz you look Church you look through the Bible when Jesus came the Sadducees and Pharisees who knew the word they doubted him why because he came so simple H he came so simple and he found himself he found Hallelujah where did Jesus Find Faith he found faith in the lives of people that were hurting W he found faith in the lives of people who were in need hallelujah how you said he said Hallelujah he came to a people who had a need not to a people who had everything together Hallelujah and you know the fundamentals they feel like they got everything together you know what and they'll put they Fang on your life they'll say well he did this and this wrong and this happened in his family this with his children all this stuff fundamental fundamental fundamental not even realizing that God put you in that W God put you in that why to bring you closer amen hallelujah I don't want to be a fundamental person just watching everything around me with no faith that's right because what the Sadducees were doing they were putting their finger on everything that was wrong when the grace was right before them they told Jesus in one place if if he knew what kind of woman that was was touching him he wouldn't let it do it but let me tell you something about Jesus you couldn't touch him if he didn't want you to Hallelujah you couldn't get close to him if he didn't want you to cuz remember church when they first came to get him Hallelujah Jesus said okay let me show you something I want to show y'all something he said nobody take my life but I lay it down Hallelujah nobody take my life I lay it down there's where the blessing is for us we lay our lives down to follow Christ we lay our lives down Hallelujah to be the message of the hour which is not a Book and Tape W Hallelujah let me help you out one more time amen hallelujah oh my church I love talking about true true manifestation and you know when the prophet preach message is like the Mighty God unveiled Hall where was he being unveiled Hallelujah we say yeah it was the word but where was the word or should I say who was the word hallelujah where was he being unveil he was being unveiled for one in a Vindicated prophet and a Vindicated Prophet was who he come to a Vindicated people hallelujah so while he was being unveiled in that prophet he was also being unveiled in those people hallelujah but if you're fundamental you miss it and say that's just a white man from Kentucky who can't talk right can't speak right his clothes don't look right and all the stuff and blah blah blah blah blah blah fundamental and you put your finger on all this mistakes Hallelujah you know where that comes from hallelujah it's the same life that was there in the moabites Hallelujah when you go back and read the Bible the mo ites had everything Israel had oh we got some Bible readers in here hallelujah cuz we know Hallelujah the message made our Bible Hallelujah illuminate Hallelujah without the message Hallelujah you're no more than a Baptist you're more no more than just a ordinary Pentecostal by denomination you're no more than just a Catholic Hallelujah but God came brought us a word hallelujah that opened the book Hallelujah opened the book where we could understand it it illuminated it and it brought us out of fundamentalism Hallelujah W Hallelujah church as we look and we see how God did what he did let's keep going he says the Pentecostals Hallelujah has it he's talking about faith Hallelujah he said it has it but don't know who they are What a Sad place to be in you got faith but you don't know who you are he say it's like a person who got can got money in the bank but can't write a check and then he said there's another one Hallelujah vice versa Hallelujah got the check but ain't got no money in the bank sometimes I feel like I'm in that category hallelujah oh my but then God always comes a to to to to to vindicate no you're my servant just speak the word only Hallelujah Glory but look church he says he said that's it and look it's just like man who has a lot of money in the bank but he can't write a check the other man can write a check and ain't got no money in the bank if Listen thisen Now Catch Us catch us now you think about how long the prophet's been gone and how long we've been preaching hallu the Vindicated word oh let me say it like this how long Jesus been gone for the Earth and how long we've been preaching Jesus Christ Hallelujah W think about that Hallelujah there has to be a purpose in our pre in US preaching Christ what is it doing it's getting us ready for his return Hallelujah see we can't fundamentally make a rapture because there's nothing you can do to make it if that's the case it'll be on a book with some instructions and all of us will do those instructions and we'll just wait as soon as that time comes but God didn't do it like that H there has to be what a Measure of Faith to make the Rapture Hallelujah yeah you got to live right but you also got to have faith while you living right but he said Hallelujah you got one that can write the check ain't got no money he said other one got money but can't right the check and now he says hallelujah he says if I could get Hallelujah he said if I could ever get them together he said brother the Millennium would start so there are people in the church who don't know who they are and y'all holding us up don't get mad at me the prophet said it he said if I could ever get those two together the Millennium would start and we know that Millennium is that three and a half years of rain Hallelujah before we get to Millennium there has to be a Rapture take place right Hallelujah so he says he says if I could ever get those together the Rapture would have taken place already oh my so what's holding up God H you got fundamental people hallelujah with no faith and then you got Pentecostal people with faith but don't know who they are and then he says if I can ever get those two together Hallelujah the Millennium would take place it would start amen church I don't know about you but I believe this gospel I believe the truth of the word I believe you got to be Sanctified Hallelujah I believe in Holiness Hallelujah let's understand something I think what we've done amen we we we we hit the stage of justification and we made sanctification what's on the outside it ain't how you look Hallelujah cuz remember justification says you never did it in the first place so I can look crazy but according to God God saying I ain't crazy never did it in the first place that's why Hallelujah most of us I shouldn't say most of us but those of us who wen't born in us hallelujah we had to be Hallelujah introduced to it find out what repentance is repent Hallelujah and then grow in Christ Hallelujah forgetting about that days of old and being able to live in the now saying God I thank you for your grace amen but you know what the fundamental does the fundamental like that brings up your past even in this day when we have so much truth and people filled with the Holy Ghost you'll see somebody do wrong and you'll condemn them remember I said people with the Holy Ghost people with the Holy Ghost can do wrong you don't like that one do you it's true because he said you don't begin to fight until you get the Holy Ghost Hallelujah with the Holy Ghost you do we did stuff and it didn't even bother us but with the Holy Ghost we go back and say Lord I didn't mean to do that we have we we we learn Hallelujah we operate in Repentance Hallelujah repentance is not you just confessing it out of your mouth repentance is confessing and forsaking Hallelujah but what we've done we we we accept the justification but when it comes to be Sanctified we put it on something on the outside no sanctification deals with the inward Man Too W Hallelujah the problem of God said sanctification is when God takes the want to away thank you Lord hallelujah how many of us have been there or should be there Hallelujah cuz I used to do some stuff but I ain't going to tell y'all I used to do some stuff I wasn't proud of Hallelujah but then God came and he began to clean me up as he cleaned me up what happened I lost my desire to do what I used to do and as I lost my desire what happened I began to become fundamental Hallelujah I would just do what was right why because I didn't have a desire anymore so I would just do what was right I I look in the word and God would say you know all of us come through a stage where when God was cleaning us up we could see wrong in everybody else life you may as well say I don't know about y'all but when God was dealing with me everybody in my family was wrong everybody and I was like John the Baptist Hallelujah I was a tree chopping Hallelujah human being gun slanging word tasseling individual and you know because I was fundamental I wanted to see people live right I wanted because I had conviction amen when you become fundamental you have conviction there's nothing wrong with being fundamental but fundamental can only take you but so far the prophet of God say if fundamental is all he want Cain was right wow oh my if all he want is fundamental Esau was better than Jacob wow because the prophet of God said look like Esau was the better man but he didn't have no conviction Oh my he didn't have no hunger for more than just doing right see Jacob had Hunger for More Than what his eyes could see wow Hallelujah he wanted more of God hallelujah and you know what him want more God made the fundamentalistic believer see more error in his life be careful if you always see an error in people life the trials and stuff you know the hardest thing for us to do y'all might not want me to say this but I'mma say what's your name Christian Christian I like that name Buddy the hardest thing for us to do is be a Christian that was right on time praise God H all it thing for us to do is be a Christian and mind our own business hey how an evangelist I can talk like this Hallelujah I'm not connected to your feelings and and your facial expr imprs and all these things you may be giving me right now cuz you know what I'm going to preach we going have a good time when I leave I'm a high five brother Mike amen and say brother it was good to see you shake brother John's hand and say man I sure appreciate you call brother Aaron and say church was good see you next time while you sitting there mad at truth that's just being fundamental because you fundamental you hear truth and still have resentment in your heart because the sagues Jesus came with truth and nothing but the truth but the Bible says they were offended at him you think about how many denominations were offended at brother Brandon you think about right now how many people are offended at us because we won't go to their parties and when they have cookouts you you you drank juice I hope you do Hallelujah Church be careful because if you all you if if all you are is a fundamental believer the prophet of God said that's a person he said the worst kind of person is a person who got just enough Christianity to make him sick why we we can't do this why we can't do that I want to go here and I go to that that sound like an unconverted teenager you know what I always tell people I be going through play I be in the airport and children be running through the air they look like they out of control they just be running away they be like honey come back over here my mama would like that we were like soldiers because she was like sorrow but you know what what I do to people hallelujah because I've grown in love and grace Hallelujah you know what I when I see people you know the kids be you know certain certain things they do now get me wrong now the Bible say spare the rod spoil the child oh you don't like that one huh [Applause] ain't no psychology in the Bible put them in timeout 1 2 three no cut day behind that what the scripture say not you you a Christian Hallelujah but Church you know what I do Hallelujah now to each his own don't don't don't don't don't take it out on brother dig said whip you good dog no don't get your child mad at me next time I come they look like nah n don't put it on me no you do your part but look Church you think about it what I do Hallelujah I see I see uh uh kids out wherever Mall you know airport they just just have such a good time you I tell the parents it look like out of control I tell the parents hey you see that enjoy that while you can because when they start growing whenever you ask them to do something they were used to just do it because they believed whatever you said but as they grow and as they get older there's a little word they develop whenever you ask them to do something it's called why hey go clean your room why take out the trash why hey let's go get ready for church why everything is why and and we so sad all we got is because I said so you just fundamental you have to be able to show your child real purpose Hallelujah you have to show your child Hallelujah that you love going to church Hallelujah that is not just a tradition amen you think about it Hallelujah I've seen it parents come to church and they in church sitting like robots and they they get home they'll never talk about the word they don't talk about how good the service was and you want that child to be excited you know what they saying why I don't see no excitement in you but let us go to a Cardinals game we in the sky boox W run that ball what wh wh what my what my man what's your quarterback might Mouse what his name is can't can't think his name right now yeah KY Kyler Murray Kyler Murray about 4 foot6 but he had they giving it everything he got and those who are really Cardinal fans Hallelujah they not looking at him with just fundamental belief they got faith come on now talk to me you don't go to that game say man Kyle ain't up a 4 foot six and we going to lose we say no I seen him do it I seen him win a game so we ain't worried about his height I'm a Believer you let your faith take over your fundamental beliefs hallelujah or you put them together amen and that's what God want us to be he want us to join we should be Hallelujah inter Twain by now amen we should be fundamental with the teachings of the message also with the Vindication of God Amen Hallelujah church I'm not boasting but everywhere I go there supernal Hallelujah I'm going to shake your boots now they're Supernatural here tonight amen hallelujah cuz he said what these signs follow them that what believe believe he didn't say follow them that pray follow them that shout follow them that dance follow them that believe he said they automatically follow the believer I don't have to do nothing special all I have to do is be a believer and God will follow us with Vindication wow Hallelujah you know there's a scripture in the New Testament where the where the Bible said Hallelujah and Jesus went with them confirming with signs and wonders Hallelujah and we know that this message was thoroughly Vindicated so if we preaching or living the same message shouldn't we have the same Vindication but we wanted to be on Sabino Canyon mountain or something ain't nothing up there but lions and rattlesnakes hallelujah hallelujah praise God like I say again to each his own you know y'all somebody go to the government say brother de say demolish the mou no I a say that what I'm saying is it can't just be fundamental because I'm going show you what fundamental fundamental did Hallelujah I remember the first time I came out and you know some brothers I'm might told you this testimony before but Brothers wanted to take me to Sabino I said praise God hallelujah praise God let's go if I wouldn't talk better I was probably been speaking in tongues with my own shab and all that stuff but we fundamental Believers you know so we going we're going up the mountain and the brother say hey let's uh let's get some water so we got a book Pack full of water y'all know this you got got book TX of water and all this stuff so going to I said what we need all this water for it's it's November it's chill it's cool said you'll see like you like you'll see I say okay all and look at the people I went with one brother named Samuel one brother named Israel the prophet the nation and the bride hallelujah hallelujah that was my experience I don't know what yours was hallelujah oh my but church we get out there we go up the mountain but before we get out the trolley I don't know what it is that was the last time I went you mean years ago like 2005 you know and you know we get out and back then when you get out the Charlie the man would say hey if you see a mount lion don't run and I'm thinking like what am I supposed to do I like walking through my neighborhood and you see a pit bull you in your mind you wondering does he bite or does he not bite most of us us don't stick around to find out we gone we out of there like a Road Runner gone that's what that's what that's what it sound like to me the man say you see a mountain lion don't run I'm thinking like mountain lion Propet ain't S no about no mountain lion when he went up the mountain see when you're fundamental you're just hearing things for face value and you're not living by Vision W but y'all pulling some good stuff out tonight Hallelujah Glory oh boy oh my I can feel it church that everybody in here not everybody in here is just fundamental H and everybody here is not just Pentecostal Faith but I can feel the intertwining Hallelujah I can feel that some of you know who you are Hallelujah Glory church so we go up he says hey look you see a m lion don't run I'm like man please I'mma leave these boys down his mou so but it took some Faith to get out and go anyway har what is faith faith is stepping into the unknown Hallelujah and let me say to this church Hallelujah what's happening in the message of the hour we've gotten accustom oh I got to find what the prophecy I got to find us see if he got a quote on us and no faith is stepping out and walking into the unknown amen you may not know what's going to happen but God does you got to trust him Hallelujah if you lose your job trust him if your bills get behind trust him you get sick of your body trust him you fundamental you go to the doctor and say give me a [Music] pill according to your faith now Hallelujah I you know what I'mma leave that alone I'm going leave it alone cuz it be somebody call Brother DS say don't take no pill but d a i to all is all the devil but I will tell you the prophet of God said medicine Hallelujah was made to sell not to heal you like man how can you talk about cuz look church let me let me tell you testimony everybody all right amen let me tell you testimony you know I might have told a testimony about God healed me from from brain cancer amen God healed me from brain cancer when I was a young and 15 years old and you know fundamentally I was just trusting in what the word of God says hallelujah and what my mama was saying hallelujah I didn't really have any experience with God but then hallelujah as I let that come out of my mouth there's a certain Lev devil trust trusting God where it became material Hallelujah so much so to I could grow in that Grace for every sickness that will come my way that's what it means to go from just being fundamental to being fundamental Hallelujah with Pentecostal Faith Hallelujah and church fundamentally I said yeah I got Isaiah 53 Hallelujah but Pentecost of faith means Hall when they brought the x-rays to say the cancer is traveling through your body I said no the Bible says I'm healed amen and I'm going to Stand My Ground Hallelujah and trust God hallelujah but you know church that prepared me for other things to come Hallelujah you one time I went to the doctor amen you know because I used to drive trucks by profession before I became a full-time evangelist I used to drive trucks and and and and I had to go God was trying to get me out of the truck that's a long testimony behind it but you know God was trying to get me out of the truck so he pushed me out of the truck and I had to go to the doctor and I say I don't know what's going on with my eyes and this and that they say well you got diabetes I said nope if he healed me from cancer how can I have diabetes that's right either you healed or you're not healed you say brother J that was a different situation still the same God amen still the same word and that's what we have to do fundamentally you'll say oh well this is another trial no Hallelujah another trial but the same Faith amen and you know church he said you got diabetes that blah blah blah I say n no I ain't accepting that H so I just stay with my confession stay with it stay with it and then when they took the test they said NOP you don't have diabetes I said I told you this year some years later I had to uh uh I had to take a a a a driver's test so I went to the nurse or whatever they had went there gave a lady urine sample she said oh my God Mr digs your glucose it's so high I'm like I'mma give I'm I'm going give you some tricks of the devil how many love to know one of his tricks nobody I'm going to give you a trick of the devil this is what he does most of us we'll go to the doctor we be feeling fine and you get in there and they say you got this well why I don't feel like I got it and that's what the devil does he tries he'll pronounce something to get you to accept that spirit so it can live because it cannot live unless you get giving life with your words the problem of God said hallelujah it's just a thought until you give it life then it becomes a spirit Hallelujah so it starts up here first amen you thinking about it or you receiving what the doctor said and once you receive it and it comes out of your mouth then you got it it comes alive this is why the devil don't like me cuz I like to tell his Secrets Hallelujah most people go to the doctor don't even know they got cancer feeling all right they take some say oh my I see a bruise just bruise that the thing you have to do is say well I ain't never saw it so I'm good but once you say okay and you start worrying you get that thing life and then it start developing and it get bigger and bigger why because you spoke it remember the prophet of God said don't accept them them rattlesnakes he said he can come to your house but you got to reject it Hallelujah and that's I tell that's what happened amen that what what does the enemy do he gets us to confess it out of our mouth and once we confess it then it comes alive because Satan ain't got no power unless you give it to us oh we a going we going to let him ride like that now amen Satan ain't got no power unless we give it to him he ain't got no power unless we give it to him amen he needs a vessel but I walked out of there diabetes free but that was just that's just some of my trials where the enemy comes and he wants to try to fight me you know in in in in areas where he think I for got and that's what he does he'll Circle back around thinking you forgot thinking you just fundamental no I believe I believe another time came about with in they talk about the glucose and East Coast and West Coast and fruct toast and light toast and dark toast all kind of toast I lady please nurses get upset with me because I want accept what they telling me and they got their instruments they got all those look I like nurses especially the nice ones you know but if she selling me something she she trying to give me something that I can't find in the word I ain't got to accept it oh Church remember remember when they tell they say in they mind and say we going to throw Jesus off a cliff Jesus walked straight through him that's right why did he do that because there was no scripture saying he should die off a cliff so why accept something about you that's not written in the word why accept something about your family or whatever the case is that's not written in the word hallelujah tell Satan get behind me any sickness any trouble Hallelujah you can't find in the word where God says you have to accept it fight and don't stop fighting fight with what your Pentecost of [Music] faith I went in lady say he got diabetes I said no she said your glucose I said whatever and they get mad at me I told I told one da said man I just took a pre-workout I I went to the gym this morning I took a pre-workout he said nah nah it don't work like that I say h it don't work like that I want to say do now you the do that ain't so if I drink a fluid how else is that fluid going to come out of my body it has to come out as a fluid it can't come out as a solid you drink water and it come out as chicken don't make no sense he telling me that my my my my my pre-workout it don't work like that where else is the liquid going to go it has to go through my streams right the wisdom of man is foolishness to God hallelujah so I you know I went on ahead and let him talk all the stuff whatever blah blah blah he said well you you this and you that I said man come on let's just let's just get it over with he said well we going to do a we going to we going we going to take the test and do it again I say let's do it let's take the test do took the test do it again came back him nurse stop Whispering well let's do a blood sample you know why they did that the test they took came back negative and they wasn't satisfied with letting me have the victory right and that's how the devil will do you Hallelujah you done already spoke your outcome and the enemy will come back and say we going to test you again you stand your ground amen hallelujah stand your ground Hallelujah and I stood my ground Hallelujah he said we're going to take a blood guess I said praise God you going to take a blood test you you going to measure What I Got by the blood I already win Hallelujah and you going to test me or Try Me by the blood and I'm a Believer who's under the blood of Jesus Christ you going to test my blood oh my you're not testing my blood Hallelujah cuz I'm covered by Jesus W Hallelujah test came back negative Hallelujah and you know Church from that first time I had to go from being fundamental to having Pentecostal Faith while I'm keeping my fundamentalism Hallelujah don't get nervous I'm about to close I know some of y'all need that so I'm going say it again I'm about to close you know them words got power wake people up on a Wednesday night listen let's look at the tooth for a second what was the difference than just being fundamental and fundamental with Pentecostal Faith Hallelujah that's where we are as I begin to wrap this up Hallelujah not just a fundamental believer who say well if the prophet said it I believe it no I want it to be revealed to me because if it's revealed to me nobody can take it from me hallelujah it's if if it's revealed to me no matter what the N says dig up in about the message and says not right and all this stuff if it's revealed to me I'm good Hallelujah that's why I tell people people didn't left the message and they argued about the bridge and this thing happening Brother brandom did do and did that you know I tell I say too late too late for me Hall you can say what but you want to say it too late you know why because elar did his part I met Isaac Hallelujah I met Jesus Hallelujah so you can say whatever you want to say about eler I met Jesus eler did his job he took me to Jesus Hallelujah so why would I be reflecting on what they got to say about a dead man I know that was a little too blunt for you hallelujah hallelujah think about the two Hallelujah if you meet Christ it no matter what you what they say by Brother brandom Hallelujah they can say what they want to say if you met Christ Hallelujah because this message was to do what Hallelujah make this word of God live the prophet's whole job what was his job to bring Rebecca to Isaac if you fundamental you still talking to ELA and that ain't scriptural once elea are you with me Church once Ela introduced Rebecca and Isaac you didn't even hear anything about elea anymore but I'll say this you can't get rid of eler because eler is the only one who knew how to get back to Abraham's house Hallelujah eler knew the way back Hallelujah so you can't get rid of eler Hallelujah but eler did his job you know what I don't even think he got a thank you card for putting him together you know what he was happy to do it he wasn't looking for nothing else you know what he saw he saw a woman Hallelujah who was fundamental that could step into a vision who wow Rebecca comes out there and El and said he said Lord I can't choose no good woman he said I don't know what to choose he said but Lord let the woman that give me drink and give my camels drink let that be my Master's wife Hallelujah and Rebecca just mind her own business coming out there doing what she always did being fundamental she comes out there with a pots Hallelujah to draw water out the well which she always did but this day she was feels a little frisky this day she felt like doing something this day she came out there and she grabed she didn't know what was pushing her to do this but she she she grabbed that water she came Le say you want something to drink she said she say yes yes give her some water and she say just just go ahead drink have a good time I'm going to give some water for the camel then she go get water for Camel water for the C water the C now let me tell you something this way is not an easy way Hallelujah but when something is revealed to you you're happy in doing it Church Hallelujah you know one camel can drink 20 gallons of water that's a lot of water cuz she had to be more than just fundamental Hallelujah it had to be something Awakening and quicken in her Hallelujah cuz she goes back and PS those 20 gallons in one and comes back you know how many he had he had 10 camels sisters when was the last time you went to Walmart and got 200 gallons of milk to feed the family that's who she was Hallelujah she didn't gripe she didn't complain she just went and did it she was anointed what did she do she stepped into the vision of her marriage supper W hallelujah oh my she stepped into the vision she went from just a fundamental day to fulfilling prophet prophecy that's who we are if you're truly bride if you're truly the message of the Y hour you'll find yourself fulfilling prophecy without even trying you just step into it because it's your time hallelujah what does it look like church oh my I got the cloth it's getting late what does it look like well I'll tell you what it looks like let me read this first though he says now he said but what was the difference what was the difference Hallelujah they only had the letter only had the word and these people had signs and wonders and before he got there he was given a type between Moab and Israel Moab had a prophet Hallelujah was bam amen Israel had a prophet who was Moses they had seven bullets seven Rams seven bullets seven Rams if you went on down Moab had everything they had but the only thing they didn't have was Vindication hallelujah hallelujah that's why I don't fuss and fight with people cuz it ain't my job to vindicate myself that's God's job Hallelujah if you're truly bride the bride of Christ God how many of you Brothers going to let somebody mess with your wife huh better not do it while I'm around I'm going tell you something hallelujah look Hallelujah even in the natural we Brothers we will what defend our spices spouses amen and vice versa Hallelujah one thing you don't do is mess with a woman her child and her husband you'll see what some holy ghost power is real quick Hallelujah don't talk about them don't say nothing Hallelujah you going to find out but that was the difference between those two one Hallelujah had the word only and the other one had the word and Vindication Hallelujah y'all know that there are people in this message who don't worship don't shout don't dance no manifestations of GI you know why cuz they say we got the word amen but the problem of God he comes back and he say for those who criticize him for the supernatural moving and gifts and all these different things he said now I'll show you where God gave it you show me where he took it away right and you think about it that's where we are Church Hallelujah you got people who hate to see people in church worshiping and singing It's to the music too loud the music too loud they moving too much the sisters moving too much stop looking at them then that's what it be it ain't that the sisters moving too much is that those people those men those Brothers still got lust spirits on them so what they'll do they'll fall back into legalism and say oh we shouldn't be doing that when the Bible say Miriam danced and shouted and praised God when the Bible it said and all the daughters of Zion the whole church was dancing yes sir oh boy I'm going to make some fundamentals mad I just I just love a nice quiet still the still small voice yeah that's Bible That's Bible but you know before you got there to the still Small Voice the scripture says God said go stand over there and I'mma move towards you am am I right is that what the word of God says it says that God moved and when God moved there was a Mighty rushian Wind when God moved a fire broke out when God moved there was an earth Quake so it was the moving of God that caused all those other manifestations so you can't say they ain't real right you can't say hallelujah somebody on fire dancing for the Lord ain't real you can't say hallelujah when the earthquake come in the church and shake the church up you can't say it ain't real you can't say that when the wind comes through that it ain't real because the Bible says when God moved it happened but that wasn't the way God wanted to speak to Elijah at that moment but that don't mean those manifestations Wen true manifestations Hallelujah because what was he on Mount Si Hallelujah he was an earthquake what was he Hallelujah at Pentecost he was a mighty Russian wi and the Bible says my God is who was he at Elijah Hallelujah stood there with the prophets of Bale what was he he was a god of fire amen so you can't pick and choose what's real and what not when you're fundamental you'll do that no you have to take the whole experience but church he look he said one was vind he said one had the word and the other one Hallelujah had signs and wonders but no doubt we all know I I shouldn't say we know people but you know where I'm at we all may have heard people say well we got the word we don't need need does and what your response ought to be well show me where God took it away cuz a anything that they say we don't need we ought to see what God took it away they could be right but just show it to me Hallelujah but I'm sorry to say you can't take my dancing away because God ain't took it away show it to me show it to me where it's a sin to dance in church I'm talking about under the spirit now I'm not talking about you go home and practice something now I ain't talking about that now now I ain't talking about you go home and premeditate some worship no that ain't God premeditate remember that sister she would premeditate she going to speak in tongues the prophet of God say he watch her pulling her Starin up pull her stockin up and she get ready say he say sit down he said I watch you mess up my service the past two night sit down now and the fundamental people who just want to hear something went up to him and say brother brand she had something from the Lord he said man sit down and be quiet see when is truly of God it will not hit like two Rams it'll blend Hallelujah Andy church we are in a place where we should see the blending of the two in our lives yeah we got the word but we also got Spirit Hallelujah Faith to believe in what God has done look and some people don't shout simply because they just don't want to and I ain't mad at you you just be dead I'm I'm going do what I'm going do Hallelujah I'm going to worship I'm going to give God thanks Hallelujah and some people may just cry some people may just raise their hand but whatever you do Hallelujah don't just be fundamental Let There Be spirit behind it let there be Vindication behind it I know a pastor friend of mine he said he was kind of you know he he he was kind of uh critical about dancing in church wasn't the prophet at one time yes he was kind of critical he said a sister broke out and start dancing in the spirit and he he was standing in the aisle he said God if this if this is of you she won't even touch me now I don't know if I'll try God like that but that's what he needed he needed that he needed that to see if God was real or not and he said he stood there and that sister came down dancing in the spirit eyes closed and spinning around and everything he said he was standing in the aisle like this he said when she got to her when she got to him it was like she was just dancing in front of them like you can't stop this and you say she just dance for a little bit and then she just spent around went all the way around him and continued on down the aisle from that point his criticism left Hallelujah because God did that for him because he needed Vindication now I ain't saying that to say that we need to be testing people worship and all this stuff you know that's childish to me Hallelujah leave people alone let them do what they do that's why we got pastors Hallelujah see I learned this lesson on my own this is personal I learned this lesson as an evangelist and sometime as an evangelist you sit in church and you see things I'm like boy Pastor need to whip them good that's all thinking that's how some of y'all been thinking brother our brother Aaron let this go he need to go blast them he know they off that relationship ain't right he need to blast it why he let them come to church like that that ain't none of your business he the pastor you just be humble and support the ministry H am Hallelujah that's problema we won't control thing no just don't be a Pharisee that's right Let Jesus operate Hallelujah hardest thing for us to do is mind our business and you know Church Hallelujah you know you think about the grace of God you know I sit in my trial and I say Lord you need to just do something with us and God comes and he say me say look there was only one John the Baptist and that was not you sit down shut your mouth and support your pastor that's the reason why he's a pastor and you're an evangelist because there's things that he can see beyond what's going on that you can't because he has a gift to deal with people and their lives sorry most evangelists don't have that gift we just whip us hallelujah we call a blast break tear up shock that's who we are Hallelujah but I love you though Hallelujah you might not think it but I love you I love you amen if I didn't love you I wouldn't be my I get back here and stand back here like Aaron and praise the Lord would you like to say Amen Church you know if Aaron watching now I'm sorry but I had to get you Hallelujah you know I couldn't be him if I tried to Hallelujah because God made him that way and can y'all imagine Aaron being like me what y'all might not realize in his younger days now that boy was fiery now younger days Aaron used to chop up some stuff when God Chang his ministry why for you Hallelujah let me finish up Hallelujah I've been preaching about an hour Hallelujah he said the difference is one got the word one doesn't have the word hallelujah I mean one one has the word and spirit amen that's what we want we want word and life Hallelujah because if you got the word you should have life amen you shouldn't be cold stagnated dead in church talking about I got faith I'm a Believer we got the word if you got the substance of God there should be life there amen there should be multiplication there Hallelujah there should be Dominion there amen there should be somebody looking at you hungering what you got oh my look he says now if teaching the B if fundamental action is all God requires he's Duty bound to anybody who will do it my Cain Esau he said God knows his church and vindicates his church with signs and wonders now before I close what does that look like amen look at the Centurion when he saw Jesus operating and doing whatever he do he said hey went to the Lord he said Lord you ain't even got to come to my house but then he starts describing who he is he saw the manifestation of Christ but what he saw in Christ he also saw in his life Hallelujah he didn't see a difference in the gospel when he saw Christ which is the gospel he saw himself and that's what we should see when we read this message we should see ourself not just brother brandom Hallelujah when we read the Bible Hallelujah we should just see Peter James and John Abraham we should see ourselves think about the church now this was going to shock you he said the Propet God said when you read the Bible you should see Christ in every word so if I can see Christ in every word and Christ lives in me who else should I see I know some of you afraid of that one Hallelujah but you should also see yourself Hallelujah the Centurion he says Hey without I he say I'm a man under like Authority The Authority he saw in God he could identify with it amen he wasn't just fundamental Hallelujah he was a man of Faith H he said hey I believe just like how you operating when when I say go they go when I say do they do when I say come they come he said Lord just speak the word hallelujah that's when the two entl when you see it but then you realize you got the ability to make it happen Hallelujah why because Christ lives in you you see the reflection of God in you Hallelujah and he says speak the word the word only and then Jesus said the Bible says he marveled and and and I believe in Luke he turned them around and he told everybody he said look at this he said I hadn't seen us no not in all Israel why because everybody else a fundamental but this man was living by Authority Hallelujah he had Pentecost of Faith like who just like the disciples because the disciples life was so real in Acts chapter 4 when they came they say we thought we killed Jesus but the Bible said they took notice of them that they had been with who Jesus what happened they seen the same life it wasn't just fundamental it was the same signs and wonders Hallelujah and you go from there who else Paul Hallelujah Paul went from just Hallelujah the teachings of gamea which was fundamental to meet Jesus was was what the pill of fire Hallelujah when he met the pill of fire which was what a type of the Holy Ghost shining in his life W he wasn't dead Pentecost like the rest of them was but he met the pill of fire with Jesus say I am he Hallelujah and it came alive to Paul Hallelujah and when it came alive he went from just being fundamental to get the name changed saw to Paul that's why the of God will say I no longer call you church but I call you bride cuz we're not just supposed to be fundamental people we're supposed to be fundamental people with Pentecostal Faith hallelujah what is Pentecostal faith I'm closing I'm going help you out I said I'm closing I know somebody wanted to say thank god oh it seems like we've been in church a long time Hallelujah you know people say say boy if I was in Jesus day oh man it been such a time and you imagine being out there Christ speaking some of us wouldn't even be able to pay attention that long some of us might even walk away think about it Jesus was preaching one time in a boat out in the water and everybody was on lay I can't hear I can't I can't I I can't hear man I'm going home but I believe his voice was so in tune with the hearts and the ears of people that he didn't have to raise his voice when he spoke it with directly to those who would receive Hallelujah and I believe he's still that same God tonight Hallelujah Well church as we look and we think about it Hallelujah when you look at the the the the the the the fundamental man becoming the Pentecostal man of faith and they intertwining what is it it's the baptism of the Holy Ghost on display Hallelujah cuz before the holy spirit all of the disciples were fundamental they healed the sick they raised the dead they did all that stuff at the same time when they were doing that Peter get mad and cuss you out uh oh still do a little cussing just fundamental you get so [Applause] angry told y'all not to mess with me give you a piece of my M El Peter he's fundamental he's with the church and cuss you slam out and might even say in Jesus name I hope he do that but church not only that Hallelujah he was so fundamental he was with he was with Jesus Healing The Sick raising the Dead doing all these things and you know who else was with them Judas the sick raising the Dead doing all that stuff The Devil Is Fundamental he was right there doing it all and Jesus say what are you is a devil and everybody say Lord is it me is it I he said me they want to pin the finger they want to put it on somebody said no you just got to keep living just keep living don't worry about who it is Peter got so mad one day they came to get Jesus he chopped somebody ear off while he was Healing The Sick racing doing all that stuff and you you believe he was a ear but I I don't believe he was that precise he said I'mma cut a ear off today N I believe you aiming for a neck but the grace of God say it's only going to be a ear Hallelujah Church there been plenty of times we would have messed up bad but it's the grace of God when we were living in our fundamentalism Hallelujah but look at what happened Hallelujah after Jesus but when when he Jesus said you know what I'mma die in three days I'mma rise if before he got dead Peter said no Lord you ain't going to do that you can be fundamental and deny the word he looked Jesus right in his face and say Lord you ain't going to do that what did Jesus say Satan walking with the church and could be possessed by a devil but he was fundamental though he said Satan get behind me Lord you should not sh Satan get behind me and Peter say Lord I'mma follow you wherever you go Jesus said man you going to deny me three times not me Lord I go he said you deny me three times for the cold and he say people say they going to one Peter said not me somebody came yeah I think I'm one of the disciple he said not me and went on a little bit took a little bit about time he said yeah Peter he said didn't I tell you so and so leave me alone and then that thing and then his fundamentalism looked into the eyes of Jesus can you imagine how that felt God telling you you going to do something you say not me I ain't going to do it and you do it anyway because he know you not there yet Church we're in a time now when you hear the word and the pastor preacher or the ministry preaching and it's at your doorstep open the door and receive it because it's God's grace don't get angry with the ministry it's God's Grace trying to get you to that level that next level that he know you ain't at yet don't live in denial Peter was living in denial not me Lord father and now he looking at looking at bible say he looked at Jesus can you imagine I don't know about y'all I probably been shaking in my boots God told me I was going to do it and I did it and I cuss everybody out while I did it that's why he walked away cuz he didn't have nothing to keep him if you just fundamental until you come into a birth one day you going to walk away even though you seen signs and wonders and I mean you you you you did things and you was a part of the church you studied this message 20 years 30 years people walk I know a brother who got powerful testimonies walked away in the name in in the name of this message powerful Tes walked away church and he didn't got to a place Hallelujah when Jesus rose Hallelujah he rose who the first one he said go tell go tell Peter Hallelujah the one that everybody was looking crazy at the one who cuss everybody out the one who chop ears off all he say go tell Peter I have risen [Music] Hallelujah Glory they did Hallelujah they meet back up Hallelujah with Christ oh my Hallelujah they me back up with Christ and then Jesus tell him he said go to Jerusalem and wait go wait Hallelujah and as they waited you know when they was waiting fundamentally they were afraid cuz they were just being attacked a few minutes ago not in the upper room afraid waiting the Pentecostal move in the book of Acts was not about gifts it was not about speaking in tongues what was it in church it was moving away from being fundamental to the Holy Ghost giving you power to not be afraid to live this gospel amen amen there we are that's us people don't understand this message but the Holy Ghost makes us unafraid to live it say what you want to say about the prophet say what you want to say about me I know what God has done for me the Holy Ghost hallelujah what did it do Hallelujah when the Holy Ghost s at Pentecost what did it do it made those fundamental Believers operate in Pentecostal Faith because the ministry of Jesus Christ what did it do it it it opened their hearts up to believe everything not in fear it took the fear away because when they came down this time those same people that persecuted them and said all this stuff Peter stood out the very one who denied it he stood out he said this is that that the prophet Joel talked about we not drunk as you suppose this is the power of God meing Brethren you need to repent he couldn't do that before come on musicians I'm closing come on we should be in our blend you got to be more than just fundamental living under good teachings oh man I oh I know the seals oh I know the Thunders and oh the church ages and oh that brother really breaks it down but can you live it that's the difference yeah give me every mystery give it all but I want to be able to live it listen real quick listen I want to show you a mystery he says and brother sister the deity is in you Hallelujah that's what I thank God for that song the brother [Music] song The deity is in you a little while and the world seeth me no more yet you shall see me amen hallelujah church we should be seeing Christ in our midst amen hallelujah even though his Corporal is not here we should see what the manifestation of his life Hallelujah he said yet you shall see me for I'll be with you even in you you see the blending of the two he says to the End of the Age Christ in the manger listen to this he says no Christ in you hallelujah we're not worshiping Christ in the manger it's Christ in you hallelujah oh my Hallelujah that's what he says he says we're not worshiping Christ in the manger but Christ in you the Holy Ghost the hope of Life Hallelujah the Creator God himself dwelling in the human being oh my it does not yet appear what we shall be but we shall see him as he is for he will be made like us the spirit in the human being that's where we are Church you should see Christ in your daily life this is this is bigger than the trials you go through you know I'm going preach a message by God by God's grace forgive me for my [Music] flaws Hallelujah because what we do is we look at one another's flaws and like brother the brother I seen this and the brother to life and this and that everything you can't get past that don't fail to realize it's my flaws that that makes me a masterpiece hallelujah hallelujah when Michelangelo hit that statue and he HD it over the knee the prophet of God said it looked like so much of the vision of what was in his mind he thought that stone could talk amen and he hit it on the knee because it looked so real so he said it was the flaw in the knee that was the Vindication of how real it was to him [Music] let's not judge one another about the trials they going through because they're specially made for the individual I can't go through what you go through and you can't go through what I go through Hallelujah and you might be looking at me mind saying that brother is not bride and God is saying I got him going through this because he's bride or I got her going through this because she's bride hallah think about the church if you if we would judge everybody on what they went through Hallelujah we'll say people ain't saved we'll say David wasn't saved we'll say Joshua wasn't saved Hallelujah I mean uh Joseph wasn't saved definitely Jacob wasn't saved and the father Faith oh Lord the man gave away his [Music] wife but it's by those things Hallelujah we live [Music] this is where we are fundamental people with Pentecostal Faith Hallelujah we got the word but we got signs and wonders too which is Vindication Hallelujah
