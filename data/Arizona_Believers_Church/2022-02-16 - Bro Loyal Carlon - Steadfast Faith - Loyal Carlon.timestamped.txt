[0:00] lord
[0:01] i want to jump into this uh quote
[0:05] uh perseverant 1962
[0:08] if it would be called a text i would
[0:09] like to take one word for a text and
[0:11] that is the word perseverance of course
[0:13] brother aaron brought this into the
[0:14] sermon the other day as well
[0:16] perseverance webster says it's to be
[0:18] persistent persistent in making a goal
[0:21] to do something to be perseverant
[0:24] is to persist and before you can be
[0:28] persistent you have to have an idea what
[0:31] you're being persistent about
[0:34] and men through all ages that's ever
[0:36] tried to achieve something has been
[0:38] persistent man in order to be persistent
[0:41] my quota gwen again is to know what you
[0:45] are after and if you do not know you're
[0:48] not certain of your standing but when
[0:51] you thoroughly understand what it is
[0:53] what you're after and are satisfied
[0:56] you're going to do it then you can be
[0:58] persistent get really persistent
[1:02] holding on
[1:08] they know where they're standing it
[1:11] starts with knowing
[1:13] where you're standing
[1:15] you can't be persistent with faith
[1:18] until you know where you're standing how
[1:20] do you know where you're standing we can
[1:22] talk a little bit about i'm going to
[1:23] just jump right down to this part i was
[1:25] going to go into a lot of other stuff
[1:26] we're going to just skim down
[1:28] how do you know that you're standing
[1:32] you have to be able to
[1:34] run it through the bible
[1:36] you have to be able to run it through
[1:38] the bible
[1:39] brother branham often talked about how
[1:40] that he almost types the bible with not
[1:43] almost he does type the bible to a body
[1:45] the body doesn't have an offshoot that
[1:47] just doesn't connect back into itself
[1:49] everything is circular it's a network
[1:52] and i want to throw this up here is this
[1:54] idea of a single source of truth and i
[1:57] apologize brother john we're going to be
[1:59] jumping around a lot tonight
[2:01] single source of truth
[2:04] a single source of
[2:06] truth is the practice of aggregating the
[2:09] data from many systems within an
[2:12] organization to a single location
[2:14] is this super exciting very exciting
[2:18] becomes accessible via a single
[2:20] reference point ensures decisions based
[2:24] on same data throughout an organization
[2:27] and it's for when an employee needs only
[2:29] one right answer and eliminates friction
[2:32] concerning which number sources stats
[2:35] and data to rely on
[2:38] so in an organization the idea is you
[2:40] have a singular
[2:42] uh
[2:43] outlet a singular place where all of the
[2:45] information must be brought back to be
[2:48] measured against i might have an idea
[2:50] over here i might have some new
[2:52] information and we can bring it in
[2:54] in a sense but it is going to be
[2:55] filtered through a single source of
[2:57] truth and why what how is it decided
[3:00] that what is a single source of truth
[3:02] that's ultimately up to an organization
[3:04] we're talking about something that's
[3:05] beyond just an organization bring up the
[3:07] slide the uh the colorful picture
[3:10] this is the bible this has been done
[3:12] there's a massive spreadsheet on this
[3:14] that i can send to you guys it did not
[3:16] go and count
[3:17] exactly how many there were but the
[3:19] spreadsheet is massive the bible itself
[3:22] is a network it is a
[3:25] self-reinforced cross-referenced
[3:28] network it is itself a single source of
[3:31] truth it validates itself by the
[3:34] repetitive
[3:35] internal references to itself it is
[3:38] continuous you have in the in the old
[3:41] testament is constantly foreshadowing
[3:44] something that is to come and it is
[3:46] constantly by by prophecy and then by
[3:48] documentation there were people at that
[3:50] time that were documenting you look at
[3:52] chronicles you look at samuel they were
[3:53] documenting this actually occurred and
[3:56] they're validating that this happened
[3:59] and then you look into the new testament
[4:02] where it's referencing back that this
[4:04] was that that they that they spoke about
[4:07] then and they're connecting the dots it
[4:09] becomes a single source of truth brother
[4:11] branham preached the sermon the absolute
[4:13] he used the terminology that people
[4:15] could understand at that time and it's
[4:17] the exact same thing it becomes a
[4:19] measuring stick by which everything else
[4:22] must be measured the problem becomes
[4:25] this chord's not long enough for me the
[4:27] problem becomes is when you get a random
[4:30] offshoot
[4:32] that doesn't connect back in
[4:34] it doesn't it doesn't have any sighting
[4:36] it doesn't have any references it's not
[4:39] it's not going back into a continuous
[4:42] story it's no longer alive if you look
[4:44] at it
[4:46] when someone gets cancer if you get a
[4:48] cancer it is effectively a new life
[4:50] source that's trying to grow inside of
[4:52] your body it is trying to
[4:54] do something that's why you can find
[4:56] hair and teeth and all kinds of random
[4:58] stuff inside of a cancer it is
[5:01] try it is a life source that is living
[5:04] off of the original life source
[5:06] but it doesn't add to this life source
[5:09] it is actually taking away from it and
[5:11] if you look at it you can measure this
[5:13] down into denominationalism into
[5:16] spiritualism into many different ideas
[5:19] that not many all different ideas
[5:22] they always end up not going back
[5:25] to the source at some point they may
[5:27] have a lot of validation through the
[5:28] bible they're like yup this this this
[5:30] and this but eventually they will cut
[5:32] off a part of it they will cut off a
[5:34] part of it so it's no longer continuous
[5:39] you can go ahead and close that down
[5:41] the bible has a single source of truth
[5:44] you have to know
[5:46] where you're standing and the only place
[5:49] that we can have 100
[5:52] certainty
[5:55] is in the word of god
[5:56] it is the only thing that we can
[5:58] actually rest and again we've heard many
[6:00] of these sermons before but i want i
[6:02] want you to listen and i appreciate i
[6:04] can hear i can tell appreciate you
[6:07] we can filter these things out
[6:09] so often if we've heard terms like faith
[6:12] or faith in the word of god we filter
[6:14] these terminologies out because we've
[6:16] heard it so many times but i i need you
[6:19] tonight
[6:20] i need you to put on your your thinking
[6:22] caps of faith tonight and to pull beyond
[6:25] there's a there's a thought that runs
[6:28] deep in this
[6:30] i believe it because god wouldn't have
[6:31] put it out of my heart if there wasn't a
[6:33] reason for us to go back over this so
[6:35] i'm trusting the lord for him to come
[6:37] tonight and i
[6:39] asked that you would preach with me
[6:40] tonight
[6:42] salvation is
[6:45] 1956 the interval and i'm going to just
[6:46] run through a lot of these some of them
[6:48] are very short
[6:49] and i can send you the quotes later
[6:51] salvation is lasts as long as faith
[6:54] lasts and divine healing lasts as long
[6:57] as faith lasts
[6:59] you that's got to experience 40 years
[7:01] ago
[7:02] forget you ever had that experience and
[7:04] go out of here tonight and say i don't
[7:07] even believe in it and i'm not god's
[7:09] servant no more watch how long your
[7:12] experience lasts certainly so he's
[7:14] equating the actual reality of our
[7:17] existence to what we believe
[7:20] to what we believe quote
[7:23] uh from
[7:25] uh just jumping down to i actually
[7:28] i'm sorry i'll i'll send you this uh
[7:31] where this is from i've seen blinded
[7:33] standing on the platform not on this
[7:34] platform
[7:36] but could read that bible come back two
[7:38] days later someone whose eyes were blind
[7:40] and they were open come back two days
[7:43] later and couldn't see their hand before
[7:44] them they got among unbelievers when the
[7:48] unclean spirit's gone out of a man he
[7:51] walks in dry places returns back with
[7:53] seven other devils worse than he was if
[7:55] the good man of the house isn't standing
[7:57] there to protect that man then he will
[7:59] come in and by power overcome him but
[8:02] the good man of your house is faith to
[8:05] say god said so
[8:08] so he's talking about people so here's
[8:10] on one hand our our ex our existence the
[8:14] reality of our existence is connected to
[8:16] our faith
[8:18] and there are people who lose
[8:20] their reality
[8:22] based upon their association
[8:25] they started hanging out with
[8:26] unbelievers and i want to drill down
[8:28] here a little bit romans 14 23
[8:31] and i'm just again going through some
[8:33] highlights laying some foundation
[8:35] 14 23 and he that doubteth is damned if
[8:39] he eat because he eateth not of faith
[8:41] for whatsoever is not of faith is sin
[8:44] this is where brother branham drew the
[8:46] reference from
[8:47] sin is unbelief
[8:49] sin is unbelief and i'd like to also
[8:52] push this in there just a little bit
[8:54] that sin is also misbelief
[8:57] it is to believe it's not what it's not
[9:00] what you don't know it's what you know
[9:02] that just ain't so
[9:04] and so people getting around a person
[9:07] who
[9:08] misbelieves who believes something other
[9:10] than the truth
[9:12] to be true
[9:14] it skews
[9:15] our vision skews your vision and this is
[9:18] the real danger and it's the reason why
[9:20] we must come back
[9:22] to the source to validate by the truth
[9:26] to filter through the word of god what
[9:28] we no matter how good it sounds
[9:31] we're not
[9:32] called
[9:35] i'm going to go away from that we're
[9:36] going to continue on
[9:38] bring it back through to the word
[9:41] and now
[9:43] on their journey the children of israel
[9:45] power of god 55.
[9:47] they look out yonder and there's the red
[9:49] sea mountains on both sides and they
[9:51] lifted up their eyes and looked back and
[9:53] there come pharaoh with all of his army
[9:55] all of his trained soldiers his chariots
[9:57] and his captains each chariot and so
[9:59] forth here come a great cloud of dust
[10:01] while tens of thousands yes perhaps a
[10:04] million of or more armed men come
[10:08] they forgot what all faith had done for
[10:11] them a few days before that's what we do
[10:14] the first little pain hits us after
[10:16] you've been prayed for oh well i guess i
[10:19] lost it oh my and here come them
[10:22] and hear them coming to the platform
[10:23] been healed of cancer blinded eyes has
[10:26] been opened those who are lame walk
[10:28] again and all these things and we see it
[10:31] look at it examine it and go right on
[10:33] moving and then the first little
[10:35] conflict comes along and we forget all
[10:38] about it see
[10:41] and i'm just
[10:42] laying some foundation here of how we
[10:45] lose faith
[10:46] we lose the reality it's not that we're
[10:49] not
[10:50] saved
[10:52] that's the key thing it's not that
[10:54] you're not saved necessarily it's that
[10:56] we start to lose the
[11:00] the benefits
[11:02] the benefits of faith i want to isolate
[11:04] down to specifically talking about
[11:06] faith
[11:08] and the benefits of god's word
[11:10] just going through a few more things
[11:12] sometimes this is a very known thing and
[11:14] i i'm i'm
[11:16] why are we talking about this
[11:18] i've seen this very often and i've seen
[11:20] this among my friends very often and the
[11:22] young people and i i
[11:26] it it's unsettling to me
[11:29] that
[11:30] there are many who have been raised
[11:32] around christianity who have been raised
[11:34] around the tenets of faith but they've
[11:37] never really experienced god
[11:40] that's what we're talking about i'm i'm
[11:42] bringing this down to highlight some of
[11:44] these key points
[11:46] and get to the question of why
[11:49] what is going on here
[11:51] it's just running through a few
[11:52] god expectation 55 god only will honor
[11:57] faith even your salvation sometimes
[12:00] won't atone for your healing not the
[12:02] merits of your salvation you're not
[12:05] healed by that you're healed by the
[12:07] merit of your faith see i've seen
[12:10] christians come to the platform
[12:12] renowned christians and failed to be
[12:15] healed and see a prostitute walk on the
[12:18] platform be healed instantly see
[12:21] because the christian had been drugged
[12:23] through a many places and skeptic
[12:27] and kind of believing
[12:30] one more
[12:31] abraham is seated after him there's a
[12:34] dead woman buried there this great big
[12:36] place rubbed where they go there and rub
[12:38] it to keep plagues off the city this
[12:39] rock above this dead woman why certainly
[12:42] and things happen sure it's the approach
[12:46] the people think they're approaching god
[12:47] through that idol people think they're
[12:49] approaching god through the witch doctor
[12:52] and these people are approaching these
[12:53] idols and images and witch doctors and
[12:56] fortune tellers and all those different
[12:57] things like that
[12:59] they get healed because they have
[13:02] believed that through there they're
[13:04] approaching god and divine healing is
[13:07] based upon faith
[13:09] if you believe it
[13:13] now i'm not
[13:15] going to be careful here
[13:17] i'm i'm very much pro doctors most of my
[13:20] mom's side of the family is doctors i'm
[13:22] very pro anything that helps people and
[13:24] i think the word of god is pro anything
[13:27] that helps people
[13:30] but and this is again i'm just
[13:33] i'm just going to talk to you guys very
[13:36] honestly i look around and i've i've
[13:38] talked to
[13:43] i have more friends that left quote
[13:46] unquote christianity then stayed
[13:49] 90 i have counted since a young i've
[13:51] been paying attention and i've thought
[13:53] about this a lot
[13:55] and if you look and you go and you ask a
[13:57] lot of these people and and this is
[13:58] anywhere you go i've sat around the
[14:01] campfire and the coffee shop with a lot
[14:02] of different people who used to be
[14:04] christians and asked them
[14:07] why what's going on
[14:09] and if you look at it and not in a you
[14:11] need to get back to christ kind of way i
[14:13] think that that's very dangerous i think
[14:15] that that is the the absolute worst
[14:18] thing because the the
[14:20] rod of salvation quote unquote can
[14:23] absolutely beat someone to death
[14:26] if you're trying to go and you need to
[14:28] get like that's no absolutely not
[14:31] absolutely not
[14:34] but if you look at the the rationale
[14:36] behind many people who are reasonable
[14:39] people who are good people
[14:41] they start to question but i can get
[14:44] this over here they reattribute well you
[14:48] know i can go
[14:49] rub up my hand on
[14:51] this over here and i can get healed and
[14:54] this is a real thing this happens i can
[14:57] i can go to tony robbins and get most of
[14:59] what happens in the nominal church
[15:02] atmosphere it's the same
[15:05] anointing
[15:06] in a way you can go to a motivational
[15:08] seminar and it's effectively operating
[15:11] along the same lines
[15:13] but we're calling to something that goes
[15:15] beyond that there's nothing wrong with
[15:18] having faith in psychology to a point
[15:21] there's nothing wrong with having faith
[15:23] in doctors to a point there's nothing
[15:26] wrong with having faith in yourself
[15:28] to a point but there is a tipping point
[15:32] that you cannot it will fail you it will
[15:35] run its course it will eventually end
[15:38] and and we are looking for that
[15:40] distinction that dividing line to faith
[15:45] in god
[15:46] that we don't throw the baby out with a
[15:48] bath water it's like well because i can
[15:50] get my basic human needs looking over
[15:52] here that we just totally leave god off
[15:55] to the side
[16:00] follow with me
[16:03] faith
[16:06] how can i overcome 63
[16:09] overcome means to recognize the devil in
[16:12] every one of his tricks a lot of people
[16:14] say there is no devil it's just a
[16:16] thought
[16:18] it's just a thought
[16:19] you know it's funny like i i've studied
[16:21] a fair amount
[16:23] and there's a lot of great stuff there
[16:25] are a lot of great things that that i
[16:27] think are very important i think that a
[16:28] lot of people have gone through terrible
[16:30] things in their lives and i i don't
[16:32] think that
[16:35] i think though we must be careful
[16:38] because otherwise we do turn the devil
[16:40] into just a thought
[16:41] it's just a part of us it's just culture
[16:43] it's just society it's just my own
[16:46] negative attributes
[16:48] there is a real devil
[16:50] there is a real person of the devil it's
[16:53] not just a
[16:54] uh
[16:56] it's not just a
[16:58] hallucination
[17:01] it's not just a feeling there is a real
[17:04] devil
[17:06] he's just as real as you are or anybody
[17:08] a real devil and you must recognize him
[17:11] real you must know he's a devil then
[17:14] the same time that you recognize him and
[17:16] know that he's a devil and he's against
[17:19] you then to overcome you must recognize
[17:21] that the god in you is greater and
[17:24] mightier than he is and that the one
[17:26] that's in you has already overcome him
[17:29] and by his grace you are more than a
[17:31] match for him
[17:33] you can't say no careful
[17:35] you can't say
[17:37] i got a sickness
[17:38] and i i don't believe it is a sickness
[17:42] oh yes it is a sickness
[17:44] you got cancer you i i don't believe it
[17:47] is a cancer it is a cancer
[17:50] it is a cancer
[17:52] but remember greater is he that's in you
[17:56] than he that is in the world you must
[17:58] realize that the holy spirit
[18:00] that's in you has already overcome this
[18:03] thing and he's in you and you can
[18:06] overcome
[18:07] by him
[18:10] i'm circling around something
[18:12] he's talking about denial
[18:15] there are there are
[18:18] it is a very we talk about in the in the
[18:20] last days that there will come we talk
[18:22] about all over in revelations that a
[18:24] strong delusion would come upon the
[18:26] earth a strong delusion and that
[18:29] delusion if you look at it a delusion is
[18:33] a belief or impression
[18:35] that is firmly maintained
[18:40] and it's not true it is believing it is
[18:43] actually believing something that's not
[18:46] true
[18:49] and i'm i'm bringing this quote in
[18:51] particular in into frame
[18:53] because if we're not careful
[18:55] and again having gone around
[18:58] the christianity circle
[19:00] we can take
[19:01] denial and masquerade it as faith
[19:05] that oh no no no i don't i don't have
[19:07] cancer
[19:10] the bible it is also written
[19:13] know the truth and the truth will set
[19:15] you free
[19:16] yes i am fight this is the thing i am
[19:19] dealing with the it is a cancer
[19:22] but greater is he that is within me
[19:26] than he that is in the word world
[19:30] we're locking down how do you have
[19:33] steadfast
[19:34] faith
[19:36] it is a satan is always trying to come
[19:38] to us
[19:40] with the word
[19:42] and get us
[19:43] just off
[19:45] just off of our footing it came to eve
[19:46] in the beginning if you look at it he
[19:48] only removed one word the word lord
[19:52] hath god said
[19:54] he removed one word and the moment
[19:57] eve says back to him god every passage
[20:01] in that point in the bible when man
[20:03] existed it was the lord god
[20:06] just removed the relationship between
[20:08] them and god
[20:10] that's all it was god is my lord there
[20:13] are benefits of having a lord he's my
[20:15] protector he's my provider he's not just
[20:18] some far away off distance
[20:20] person that i am i'm you know agility
[20:23] you know i'm just i'm reverencing who's
[20:25] way over there and i can't touch no he's

[20:45] you have to know
[20:46] where you're standing
[20:48] and the only way we can truly know
[20:52] is because we did all the math
[20:55] the only way we can truly know is
[20:57] because it felt really good man you know
[21:00] when they shouted i jumped out of my
[21:02] seat
[21:03] and i i love those things i love running
[21:05] the aisles i'm not preaching against
[21:07] that
[21:09] it's not based upon sensation
[21:14] and and i i'm just confessing for myself
[21:16] and many times over the years i've
[21:17] caught i've realized i have run into the
[21:20] trap of sensation it's so exciting
[21:24] it's so
[21:25] dude did you guys read that thing
[21:28] that was amazing
[21:29] it was so amazing is it true i don't
[21:32] know but it was amazing
[21:34] it was so
[21:36] i work in marketing
[21:37] this is my day job
[21:39] i write copy all day long guess what my
[21:43] job is to get people to say
[21:46] wow
[21:47] actually they don't even say wow they
[21:48] don't even know they're saying wow they
[21:50] just click the add to cart button
[21:53] that's all i want i want them to click
[21:55] the add to cart button
[21:57] that's my job
[22:00] i've got a friend
[22:02] so this is actually just a funny side
[22:03] story
[22:05] a friend of mine
[22:07] forgive me i'm gonna tell on him
[22:09] he
[22:10] he loves to evangelize brands for lack
[22:13] of a better word he'll come up and tell
[22:14] you everything about the new brand that
[22:16] he's into and why you should be into his
[22:19] that thing too like this is the only
[22:21] thing that does this thing
[22:23] and it was funny there was a particular
[22:24] product that he had told me about and
[22:26] what's amazing is he had told me with
[22:28] such enthusiasm i believe what he told
[22:30] me i was like wow this is the only one
[22:33] he's the only thing and i had this
[22:35] locked back in the back of my mind it's
[22:38] like this is the best one like you know
[22:40] whatever i'm doing is just must not be
[22:42] that great because he
[22:44] bought in and he sold it to me and he
[22:46] gave me all the right key you know data
[22:49] points and he told me i was like wow
[22:51] six months later
[22:53] i accidentally wound up i was doing some
[22:55] research and i ended up
[22:57] an ad was fed to me i ended up on the
[23:00] website for the same product and i
[23:02] looked at it and it dawned on me he had
[23:04] reiterated to me
[23:07] the copy that was on the website the
[23:10] exact
[23:11] copy
[23:12] almost word for word here i thought he'd
[23:15] like done the research and that
[23:16] everything was amazing
[23:18] i was like wow man he must really know
[23:21] he was reiterating exactly the copy that
[23:24] was on the site that had been spoon fed
[23:27] quite literally
[23:28] this is what i want you to believe about
[23:30] this product
[23:38] and satan does the same thing
[23:40] satan is a great marketer
[23:43] he is a great marketer he wants to get
[23:45] us to believe
[23:47] anything other than the truth to try to
[23:50] misrepresent a scripture or a quote or
[23:54] anything it doesn't even matter what it
[23:56] is anything that he can get wormed into
[23:58] our heads that's stuck in the back of
[24:00] our mouth via his word of mouth
[24:02] marketing campaign that he can
[24:04] lodge in the back of our mind that we
[24:06] believe to be true
[24:09] we believe that it's true and because we
[24:12] believe it
[24:13] we continue to act it out
[24:16] now really quick i want to make a key
[24:18] distinction
[24:20] there are lots of things that we
[24:21] acknowledge to be true that we do not
[24:24] believe to be true
[24:26] that's a very very very different thing
[24:31] the things that we believe
[24:33] we act out
[24:34] almost invisibly
[24:38] let's take this morning okay who here
[24:40] drank coffee this morning
[24:43] who here had caffeine of some kind this
[24:45] morning
[24:46] all right there we go
[24:48] why did we do that
[24:49] it's become unconscious to us at a level
[24:53] we almost don't even realize we are
[24:55] doing it
[24:57] it is we believe we will have more
[25:00] energy
[25:01] because we usually do
[25:02] sometimes it gives us you know we have
[25:04] too much and it's not good
[25:07] i do
[25:07] [Laughter]
[25:09] we believe
[25:11] but none of us is going around thinking
[25:14] man caffeine like that's the stuff you
[25:16] guys should get on caffeine like some
[25:19] people might okay there's coffee snobs
[25:20] we'll write them off the list
[25:23] i'm one of them i understand
[25:25] but
[25:26] the a distinction because we are
[25:29] actually acting out we we prove the
[25:32] value of it by what we do because we
[25:35] believe it
[25:38] similarly out of the abundance of the
[25:41] heart the mouth speaks
[25:43] it is going the things that we actually
[25:45] hold true
[25:47] we really do
[25:50] it's going to come out of our mouths
[25:52] it's going to come into our thinking
[25:54] because it's ju it is it is what is
[25:56] inside of us we can't help it
[25:59] we can't help it
[26:12] the good man of the house
[26:15] is our faith you can go back and read
[26:17] all the quotes it's not the holy ghost
[26:19] it's our faith
[26:22] brother branham talks about in enticing
[26:24] spirits you can go look it up
[26:26] you can be totally insane
[26:29] and still have the holy ghost
[26:31] totally insane that sounds crazy
[26:36] i'm sorry
[26:38] it sounds crazy that you could be full
[26:41] of the holy ghost and totally insane
[26:43] that means there's hope for me there's
[26:44] hope for you you know
[26:46] it's true it's not based upon the merit
[26:49] of how
[26:51] quote unquote good of a person i am on
[26:53] the outside it's based upon
[26:56] the what is the indwelling spirit in my
[26:58] heart and has that been quickened to me
[27:01] and you can measure that based upon
[27:04] the continual
[27:06] persistence
[27:07] the continual walking and striving
[27:10] towards god there is a desire in your
[27:13] heart that is beyond rationality beyond
[27:17] intellect beyond a conscious i believe
[27:20] that you know the lord jesus christ is
[27:22] my lord and savior that's a
[27:25] that is a belief
[27:27] that is calculated in the mind and
[27:30] professed but a belief is i
[27:33] must
[27:34] have
[27:36] god
[27:37] i must have god i must
[27:39] find him i must there there's a longing
[27:43] that you cannot fake that is somewhere
[27:46] deep inside of you and that is the
[27:49] driving force of your entire life and it
[27:51] will lead you into all truth it will
[27:53] lead you because you can't fake it
[27:55] there's no faking it till you make it it
[27:57] is there or it's not
[27:59] there is there is a a a force driving
[28:03] you that is real that is beyond
[28:05] something that again similar to coffee
[28:08] we're back on caffeine apparently i
[28:10] really like coffee
[28:12] back onto caffeine similar to this drive
[28:15] this pull this
[28:17] addiction
[28:19] addicted to god if you look if you look
[28:21] into the word it's actually amazing i
[28:23] love it when i saw this the word seek ye
[28:25] first the kingdom of god and his
[28:26] righteousness and all these things shall
[28:28] be added unto you that word means to
[28:31] crave
[28:32] it is to crave as if you
[28:35] have to have it i just gotta have it i
[28:37] know i'm on a diet but i gotta have it
[28:40] because we're gonna find a way to get
[28:41] this in it's okay i'll just do another
[28:43] workout i have to have it it is to crave
[28:47] and so
[28:48] we these are the things that we're
[28:50] talking about i'm making a separation
[28:52] between what is there and real and
[28:55] concrete faith is a substance
[28:58] it is a substance that you cannot
[29:02] you cannot measure its existence because
[29:04] it's unconscious but you can measure its
[29:07] results because it occurs it happens
[29:10] these signs shall follow them that
[29:13] believe it's not a hey joel i'm going to
[29:16] just come over you know i'm a believer
[29:18] so i'm going to lay my hands on you and
[29:20] i'm going to measure my belief by what
[29:22] happens to you there's a quote in here
[29:24] i'm just going to just go all over these
[29:25] i have way too many notes in here
[29:28] it's not based upon that brother branham
[29:30] talked about it i could pray for a
[29:32] thousand people tonight and every single
[29:35] one of them die
[29:37] and tomorrow i'm going to pray for
[29:39] another thousand people
[29:41] not because
[29:43] because i am not measuring it based upon
[29:46] my
[29:47] outcome per se i'm not basing it in this
[29:49] logical like
[29:51] i must not be a believer like no i'm
[29:53] taking god at his word and placing my
[29:56] faith in his word and acting out what
[29:59] god told me to do
[30:01] in sincerity
[30:03] from my heart from this driving force
[30:06] within me that has to have it i've got a
[30:10] need
[30:11] we've got a need
[30:13] and we're again the reason to talk about
[30:15] this is i i
[30:17] you see
[30:18] people who are afraid to really
[30:22] believe
[30:24] to take a scripture and say you know
[30:26] what
[30:29] just find one
[30:31] to take a scripture
[30:34] and say
[30:35] that scripture right there
[30:37] that's about me
[30:39] when god went you know when he was
[30:41] talking about jehovah jireh being our
[30:43] provider
[30:44] that he was talking about me
[30:46] not because i had a sensation when i
[30:48] read it and i was like i just flipped
[30:49] right open to the bible and there was
[30:51] that means it's for me it's like no it's
[30:53] for me because i see it and it says like
[30:55] there aren't any asterisks that says
[30:57] it's not for me so maybe it's for me
[31:00] and because i'm looking
[31:02] is this the word of god or is it not is
[31:05] it true or is it not okay if it's true
[31:08] and it doesn't exclude me from it that
[31:10] means that that scripture right there is
[31:12] for me and i can die on that scripture i
[31:15] can take that scripture and no matter
[31:18] what
[31:19] no matter what happens to me i can hold
[31:22] that as a sh in a strong hand of faith
[31:26] and
[31:27] resist
[31:28] anything that would come against that
[31:30] because i actually believe that
[31:34] scripture is for me
[31:36] but you have to actually believe
[31:39] not just a oh wow that's a great
[31:41] scripture and it's i'm going to stand in
[31:42] front of the mirror with my affirmations
[31:44] like these signs shall follow them that
[31:46] believe
[31:48] no it's to
[31:52] it is to take with god with a sincerity
[31:56] with with a an action and a purpose and
[32:00] an intention
[32:01] of god i don't understand this this word
[32:04] like this scripture right here it says
[32:07] that this is this is my this is a
[32:09] christian's right and i don't see it in
[32:11] my life
[32:12] reveal it to me reveal okay what am i
[32:15] doing is there something that i'm doing
[32:20] guide me show me lead me through this
[32:23] god is not a i will not be ashamed i've
[32:28] set my face like flint and i know
[32:33] god will back me up that is the the goal
[32:36] the is to get to that point where i can
[32:38] say with a certainty this scripture is
[32:42] for me
[32:44] it is for me and it doesn't matter it
[32:47] doesn't matter what happens you look at
[32:49] jonah he goes to the belly of the whale
[32:52] we all know the story we've heard it a
[32:54] million times since we were little
[32:55] little kids
[32:57] the beautiful thing about that is jonah
[32:59] should have died i mean he's in the
[33:00] belly of a fish in the bottom of the
[33:02] ocean i mean he had pretty bad
[33:04] circumstances you know we could put any
[33:07] of our troubles that we go in there it's
[33:08] like man like i'm not my health is kind
[33:10] of falling apart or my i'm running out
[33:12] of money or you know i got anxiety oh my
[33:15] goodness you know all these different
[33:17] things and we start trying to think how
[33:19] am i gonna get out of this whale
[33:23] ah how are we gonna get out of here you
[33:25] know i'm just getting eaten alive by
[33:27] these circumstances whatever they are
[33:30] we're overwhelmed and we're dropped down
[33:33] to the bottom of the sea we're
[33:36] completely submerged there's no light
[33:39] there's no hope there is no chance that
[33:42] he is getting out of there alive and yet
[33:44] he he turned his face towards the east
[33:47] or wherever he thought east was and he
[33:49] was relying on the prayer of solomon who
[33:53] backslid
[33:55] he was relying on a single scripture and
[33:58] he held on to that with all of his might
[34:01] why because he believed that god
[34:04] said so that god said so and that god
[34:08] would back up his own word and it would
[34:11] have been very easy again for jonah to
[34:14] say well because i'm a messer because
[34:16] you know i went over here and i was
[34:17] going towards tarshish i guess god's not
[34:20] going to hear my prayer
[34:22] and that's exactly the same place that
[34:24] satan wants to get us to where we are
[34:27] looking around at our circumstances that
[34:29] are coming against us ourselves because
[34:32] i mean lord knows we're all a mess
[34:35] absolutely and if we can get our eyes
[34:37] off of everything except for christ
[34:40] then he's won he's completely disarmed
[34:43] us the strong man of faith is not at the
[34:45] door to defend him and he just walks on
[34:48] in without a fight
[34:50] because we have allowed a belief to
[34:52] supersede belief and faith in the word
[34:55] of god we've allowed something to come
[34:58] in and oftentimes it's guised as the
[35:01] word of god
[35:02] absolutely to come in and handcuff us
[35:05] and say say that you are a mess and
[35:08] you're a horrible person and you're
[35:10] never going to change the end goodbye
[35:13] all right you're dismissed
[35:18] it's the truth it's the truth the
[35:20] difference between conviction and
[35:21] condemnation
[35:23] here we go condemnation is
[35:25] gavel whack you're going away life
[35:28] sentence you're never getting out no
[35:29] parole no bail nothing you're dead
[35:33] conviction comes and says you done
[35:35] messed up
[35:38] you done messed up
[35:40] here's all of the things here's the
[35:41] entire rap sheet on you
[35:45] and here's the way out
[35:47] it's always a way out you can
[35:49] distinguish the voice of god and the
[35:51] voice of satan's very very quickly just
[35:54] with that
[35:55] is there a light of hope
[35:59] with it is there some shred of hope
[36:03] satan wants to come
[36:07] and keep us bound always keep us bound
[36:17] you know
[36:19] so is there anything too hard for the
[36:21] lord i'm watching the time i apologize
[36:22] guys we'll come come into a close
[36:25] you know sometimes when things are going
[36:27] wrong dark we know by nature that it's
[36:30] darkest just before day and many times
[36:33] when we see disastrous things happening
[36:35] like that especially to believers we
[36:38] must bear this in our mind that it's
[36:40] satan trying to block the blessing
[36:42] that's on its road that was very much so
[36:45] in this case satan was trying to tempt
[36:47] them speaking of abraham and sarah
[36:49] to feel that they had done wrong
[36:52] and was trying to block the oncoming
[36:54] visitation that god was going to give to
[36:56] abraham and sarah i just want to pop put
[36:59] a pause right there he was trying to
[37:01] convince them that they had done
[37:03] wrong that they must have you know
[37:05] missed the scripture or somewhere they
[37:07] must have missed something maybe i've
[37:08] just not seen it quite right or you know
[37:10] it's been a really long time and again
[37:13] you have done wrong there is none
[37:16] righteous no not one
[37:19] except for me i'm just kidding no i'm
[37:22] i'm we are all filthy rags i love it uh
[37:25] i think in psalms it talks about
[37:27] the lord remembers that we're but
[37:29] dust praise god
[37:32] praise god i am but dust and you know
[37:34] what dust is gonna stay dust
[37:37] no matter how much time i spend on
[37:39] working on this guy i'm still dust
[37:43] no matter how much i achieve in this
[37:45] life and i roll up you know i just
[37:48] it doesn't matter at the end of the it's
[37:51] fine for a great way of life here but
[37:53] and this in the supernatural and for the
[37:56] eternal kingdom to go come
[37:58] it doesn't matter it's literally
[37:59] irrelevant other than we were good
[38:02] stewards with what god gave us
[38:05] and there's nothing wrong with a great
[38:06] life that's all good there's nothing
[38:08] wrong with asking for there's lots of
[38:10] promises of god for that
[38:12] again not preaching against those things
[38:14] we're dividing
[38:17] what is what is to believe the to
[38:20] believe for the promises of god
[38:23] unlimited without limit without without
[38:27] misattribute misattribution
[38:30] where we where we think this is this
[38:33] when it's really not this
[38:35] it's the ability to drive beyond these
[38:38] things
[38:39] and really get to work
[38:41] believing the word of god
[38:44] brother branham talked so often about
[38:47] healing and i i think about this a lot
[38:50] that
[38:50] i think we
[38:53] we majored so much on healing when
[38:56] healing is just a minor
[38:58] there is so much more for us but we
[39:00] haven't mastered the ability to believe
[39:04] god's
[39:06] word
[39:07] to believe why did we bring up these
[39:09] original quotes a prostitute jump up on
[39:11] the platform when many
[39:13] christians
[39:15] don't get healed
[39:16] some random person off the street jumps
[39:19] in and gets healed why because that
[39:20] christian's been through a lot
[39:23] been through a lot of years
[39:25] a lot of hardship
[39:26] a lot of things that have gone wrong a
[39:28] lot of things that didn't go the way
[39:29] that they thought
[39:32] and they may be a believer but they've
[39:34] had their believer
[39:35] hurt
[39:37] they've had they're they're afraid to
[39:39] hope they're afraid to believe
[39:44] and satan wants to keep us there
[39:47] as much as possible
[39:48] it's again i'm preaching to believers
[39:52] i'm preaching to believers i'm not
[39:54] none of us
[39:55] i'm not putting any of us in an
[39:57] unbeliever category
[39:59] and if you are you can be a believer
[40:01] right now
[40:03] that's it that's how fast it's just like
[40:06] that
[40:07] it's just like that it's it just believe
[40:11] i love it right
[40:13] we just sing the song he's in the house
[40:16] comes to jesus my daughter is dead what
[40:19] does he tell him
[40:21] don't be afraid only believe don't do
[40:24] anything else
[40:26] but believe and he says lord i believe
[40:29] help my unbelief
[40:31] even god i love it it's so beautiful
[40:34] here's something as major as death
[40:36] that we're oh my goodness i mean that's
[40:38] just we think of that as being like you
[40:40] got to have super faith to believe for
[40:42] death
[40:43] and here he is coming to christ and he
[40:46] comes to him and he's like yes i believe
[40:48] help my unbelief he is admitting that
[40:50] there's a part of him that doesn't
[40:52] believe and in that truth admitting that
[40:56] to god god i'm not sure if i believe he
[40:58] was able to believe
[41:01] because he could admit maybe what i've
[41:03] been doing this whole time isn't belief
[41:05] this guy is a he's a pharisee for
[41:08] goodness sake he is a member i mean he's
[41:10] a part of the church
[41:12] and he admitted to jesus help my
[41:15] unbelief he humbled himself and in that
[41:19] he was what he didn't need to go pray
[41:21] all night
[41:22] he was able to transcend that unbelief
[41:27] right then
[41:28] and again we
[41:30] we must not go we serve an unlimited god
[41:34] we serve an unlimited god
[41:38] satan wants to come in and put this
[41:41] giant
[41:42] jump through hoops
[41:43] boundaries so that we get this idea in
[41:46] our head that in order to
[41:48] in order to connect with god it always
[41:51] is tomorrow
[41:54] it's always tomorrow it's never today
[41:58] it's never right now
[42:00] there might be something that you've
[42:02] dealt with for your entire life and
[42:05] today
[42:06] god just might decide it's time
[42:09] god will he find faith when he comes
[42:12] it's a scripture it doesn't matter how
[42:14] long it takes will you still believe no
[42:19] matter what
[42:23] and you can
[42:25] that's the key
[42:26] i'm not preaching a sermon of
[42:27] condemnation of you guys should just
[42:29] believe look at me oh man i need this
[42:32] sermon i really need this we all need
[42:35] this we we are constantly surrounded by
[42:39] ella
[42:40] every day
[42:42] we are surrounded by forces that try to
[42:45] come to get us to disbelieve the word of
[42:48] god to try to get our aim and our vision
[42:51] if he can just get us a little bit off
[42:57] siri just said amen so there we go
[43:01] amen
[43:04] and we're taught in the scriptures that
[43:05] all things work together for good to
[43:07] them that love god and no matter how bad
[43:10] it seems remember
[43:12] it has to be working for your good
[43:15] i'm so glad of that
[43:17] satan's been after me all day
[43:19] so i just believe that there's a
[43:21] blessing in store here in this city
[43:23] somewhere and i know when he tempts and
[43:26] tries to block out what's he trying to
[43:29] do
[43:29] get you to disbelieve and if you the
[43:32] worst thing that you can do
[43:34] is disbelieve god and as soon as you get
[43:37] a little scared
[43:39] well maybe i haven't done this and i
[43:41] haven't done that right then
[43:43] satan's got that blessing conquered for
[43:45] you you can't get to it as long as satan
[43:48] makes you think that
[43:54] so what do you do
[43:55] when you start thinking that
[43:57] you just believe
[43:59] you just believe
[44:01] that if it was so
[44:04] that maybe there is something that
[44:05] you're not doing
[44:06] that god is not
[44:08] a god god is not a trickster
[44:11] he is not a trickster trying to slay
[44:13] traps for you
[44:14] he is not
[44:16] the devil
[44:18] he's tr god is trying to help you and if
[44:21] there is something for you to change it
[44:25] will
[44:26] be revealed to you
[44:27] if you're sincere about it i love it
[44:30] david talked about it
[44:32] cleanse me from my secret faults the
[44:35] things i don't even know that i'm doing
[44:37] that i'm doing because there are a lot
[44:39] we're all doing stuff that are wrong and
[44:41] we don't even know we're doing them
[44:42] there are lots of things that's why we
[44:44] need the word of god to come and to mold
[44:46] us and shape us and open our eyes and
[44:48] give us vision to see wow i am i thought
[44:51] i was doing pretty good but man i'm a
[44:53] mess and we're always going to be a mess
[44:55] we're continuously striving and pressing
[44:59] towards the kingdom of god and and it's
[45:01] it it is so that we can always have our
[45:04] faith
[45:06] again
[45:07] not in me
[45:08] not in my walk not in wow you know what
[45:11] today's a pretty good day wow i had my
[45:13] caffeine this morning i had a breakfast
[45:14] you know what i talked to some people
[45:16] it's going great today's a great day
[45:18] today's the day god must want to do
[45:20] something for me
[45:22] today's the worst day of my life
[45:27] god could never do anything for me or
[45:29] maybe he will because i'm doing so bad
[45:34] it's irrelevant
[45:36] it's whether or not i can get
[45:38] if i can get a hold of god can i
[45:42] hold on to that word and really put my
[45:44] belief
[45:46] not in how well i prayed
[45:49] not how much i
[45:51] screamed and shouted or i didn't scream
[45:53] and shout because i'm not like those
[45:54] other people
[45:57] it doesn't matter it is our is my faith
[46:00] anchored in the word
[46:03] of god
[46:05] with
[46:06] christ
[46:14] and that's why we need
[46:15] to read our bible and pray every day
[46:18] i need it we all need it to feed why
[46:21] because you don't know how much faith
[46:23] you have it's a quote i'm not going to
[46:24] bring it up i've already read
[46:26] coming to a close i promise
[46:28] i'm gonna say that six more times um
[46:32] you don't know how much faith you have
[46:34] faith is unconscious
[46:36] but in the moment of need
[46:38] you want it to be there
[46:40] and the only way for it to be there is
[46:42] if you are feeding on the truth on the
[46:45] word of god if you have been allowing
[46:48] this to come into your heart into your
[46:50] mind continuously what it does
[46:52] what reading our bible and praying every
[46:53] day really does
[46:55] is it is forcing our minds
[46:58] to think about it
[47:00] a little bit just think about it and
[47:03] guess what by nature eventually it just
[47:07] becomes something that everything else
[47:09] has to become measured too
[47:11] i mean you think about it you go read a
[47:13] random book
[47:14] oh they said that on youtube
[47:16] but this thing over here that i read
[47:18] said that
[47:19] now i'm confused
[47:23] god is not the author of confusion
[47:25] god is the author of certainty we can
[47:27] hold on to it with truth
[47:31] we need it i need it
[47:34] absolutely again not not any sense of
[47:36] condemnation like oh my goodness i can't
[47:38] believe people are reading their bibles
[47:40] we all
[47:42] you know where you are we all know where
[47:43] we are
[47:56] just coming down into a close the
[47:57] musicians can go ahead and come
[48:01] it must be the greatest battle ever
[48:03] fought 62
[48:04] it must be accepted in the mind and then
[48:08] it's believed with the heart
[48:11] then the word of god becomes reality
[48:13] then every senses of soul and body is
[48:15] just scoured out with the holy spirit
[48:18] then your sense of god your conscience
[48:20] of god everything that's godly flows
[48:22] through you there's not a doubt anymore
[48:25] there's nothing can rise up there's
[48:28] nothing can come up in the memory and
[48:30] say
[48:30] well i remember
[48:32] miss jones tried and trust god and miss
[48:34] so-and-so and misto tried to trust god
[48:36] for healing one time and she failed see
[48:38] but if that channel has been cleared out
[48:40] and been purged and been filled on the
[48:43] inside with the holy spirit that don't
[48:45] even come in memory no matter about miss
[48:48] jones and what she did it's you and god
[48:50] together and nobody else but you too
[48:54] there you are
[48:55] there's your battle
[48:56] [Music]
[49:01] if you'll come and you'll keep them
[49:03] memories and conscience and everything
[49:05] thinking about well i might fail it
[49:08] might not be right
[49:10] don't you do that at all you throw aside
[49:13] everything and open up the channel and
[49:15] say god
[49:16] your word is eternally true and it's
[49:21] for me
[49:22] if the whole church fails
[49:24] if the whole world fails yet i can't
[49:28] fail because i'm taking your word
[49:30] there's the battle
[49:32] that's the thing how many want to be
[49:33] there
[49:34] i want that i want that more than
[49:36] anything to be there with god
[49:42] amen let's just go to the lord in prayer
[49:45] tonight

[50:30] that they could be encouraged to believe
[50:33] and that they would receive it lord god
[50:35] not in some distant way of future
[50:38] but now and even if it does wait
[50:41] that that faith would roll over to
