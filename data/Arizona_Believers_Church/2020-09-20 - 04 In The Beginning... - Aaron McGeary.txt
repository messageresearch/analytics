of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen praise the lord revelations chapter 3 verse 14. i'm going to read this and then just jump right into the word revelations chapter 3 verse 14 wow powerful atmosphere in here today and i know that by faith we sense that and you wouldn't even have to sense anything necessarily within your spirit as far as an emotion or feel anything in your body as far as some sort of sensation by faith we believe that he's where his elector gathered where two or three are gathered in my name there i am in their midst and so upon that promise alone we can confess god is in our midst and he's promised that he would meet us he promised he'd be with us even in us to the end of the world so we always are confessing that we're always believing that and where he is the supernatural is so we just open our hearts to him to do the supernatural for us today revelations chapter 3 verse 14 it says and unto the angel of the church of the laodiceans right and it's remarkable because he does not give himself this designation in any of the other church ages these things saith the amen the faithful and true witness in this part the beginning of the creation of god and wonderful he saved that revelation for the end time the beginning of the creation of god he's expressing something to us in this day a revelation to us in this day to give us confidence who we are in this end time god bless you may be seated we're so happy to see so many of you out to the house of the lord today we trust that you're come just in obedience uh to the the leadership the holy spirit your life even obedience to the word that uh brother brahm says you you can't be a christian and not go to church and so you know you've at least you at least checked that box today but it just doesn't take going to church to be a christian we have to be quickened by the word of the seal of god the baptism of the holy ghost become new creatures in christ jesus and that's our prayer that's our desire is to see uh to see people come to the lord be so soul saved and the and the lost their souls to be caught by the word of god so i trust that you're inspired um to evangelism in this end time not that there's going to be a harvest of thousands but to find that soul that you can touch and reach out to and we're so grateful to be able to announce that today we're going to have a baptism and my son elliot he's 12 years old he's expressed his desire to be baptized and i just thank god for those kind of fruits and so be in prayer for him we'll have a baptismal baptismal this afternoon and we'll give you the information at the end of the service now i want to read genesis chapter 1 verse 1 we've just read in the beginning or the beginning of the creation of god and it's designating you read that it's in the red letter in your bible and it's designating christ the word and how he's expressing himself as the amen he's the alpha and omega he's the first and the last the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of god and then we could back up into the middle of the book and we see that john writes in the beginning was the word and now we go all the way back to the beginning of the bible it says in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth we've been focusing on the beginning and specifically what has been represented in the creation of the heaven and the earth and i want to just read a few things a few statements to recap kind of the trajectory that we've been on to this point and how that we've identified in the word of god how that jesus christ was the union of heaven and earth so there was a blending and a fusion of divinity and humanity in jesus christ and brother branham pointed out to us that that is the beginning of the creation of god and he makes this statement when god created himself a body and come down and lived in it that's the beginning of the creation of god now god himself cannot be created because he's an eternal being so there couldn't be nothing and then god was created that just doesn't make sense even in terms of the scripture and it certainly doesn't make sense in terms of science science has definitively concluded and they're very certain about this that you cannot get something from nothing so in order for there to be something there had to be something before it so only something can from come from something that's always been in that scientific principle alone they must believe that everything creation came from or what we know today came from something that had always been because you can't get something from nothing so there's god the eternal existing uh by himself he is el ella elohim he is a strong one he's the self-existing one and then he doesn't create himself in this scripture but the other it's the beginning of god's creation so god is now creating something and this is an expression of himself brother branham says it again this way he is the beginning of the creation of god and god is eternal but when god created a little baby that was conceived in the womb of a virgin and she began to develop these cells within her to bring forth this little baby that was the beginning of god's creation and that is then looking at how jesus christ himself is the beginning of the creation of god so this is a new creation this is a different creation and then brother branham makes this statement and christ is revealed in his own word he says god was in the beginning and he kept coming down through the prophets and on down until god himself became human like us plumbed down at the foot of the ladder a baby born in a manger hated rejected despised a bad name in everything he was so you could look at this image of how that god was in the beginning and he has been condescending down from the very moment that he formed himself into the logos to when he created heaven and earth and then the days of creation and then even all through the new test of the old testament it is god descending down and he says once he's come into jesus christ he comes down to the foot of the ladder and now god has expressed himself in his son just as he had desired to do in the very beginning he says then he started rising and from the feet he began to build the church the bride coming on back and now coming out into the headstone where it all joins together and makes one great transfigured body of jesus christ so he looks at it as christ is god condescended down into christ now he's saying that god who came down from the heaven to the earth now god's bringing earth up to the heavens just as there's been a condescending down of god now there's an ascension of humanity and so as the heavenly had become earthly now the earthly is becoming heavenly and that's the process that's taking place even through the church ages it's god taking humanity and raising it up to be seated in heavenly places in christ jesus so god was at the beginning condescending down into earth and now he is rising bringing earth up into heaven so the beginning of the creation of god is jesus christ and then he expresses this in the church age book chapter 9 to where we're looking at now not just jesus christ as the beginning of the creation of god but this part that is rising is also part of the beginning of the creation of god he said this is another creation this has nothing to do with the church this is a special designation of himself so it's not the church but a designation of himself and let me just express this we're all family here today and so if something goes haywire with the sound i'm not going to be embarrassed so you don't need to be embarrassed if the string cuts off we apologize to all the streamers but what's important is that the word is preached in person to you who are here so we're family so if you get tired you need to stand up it's not going to bother me if the baby starts crying it's sweet music to my ears we're all comfortable we're all family no one should be nervous hey guess what we don't even have deacons to grab you by the ear and pull you out and say you tell you what you better keep that kid quiet we're just all family here and we're just gathered around the word of the lord so you just relax and don't be nervous or worried if this is your first time we're gathered around the word there's no complexes there's no fears there's no worries just let the word have preeminence so this is the beginning of the creation of god this is the scripture he's referring to revelations 3 14 this is another creation and remember brother brown said when the woman came out of adam she was not another creation he said because she had been had she been another creation she would have been greater so that's a principle that brother branham places within the word of god so as to understand that if god ever creates again it's got to be greater so now in jesus christ it's something greater it's a further evolution of himself a further evolution of god which was prefigured or foreshadowed in adam but now it's a another creation and this one is not a church but it's a special designation he says this has to do with the church this is a special designation of himself i read it incorrectly a moment ago this has to do with the church this is a special designation of himself he is the creator of that church the heavenly bridegroom created his own bride so it's not just jesus christ but now it's his wife it's the bride so it's not just creating the man that's creating the woman again or bringing forth the woman from that creation he says he was of the new creation man and god met and joined he was the first of this new race he is the head of this new race this is the this is this new creation and i'm just reading these statements just to gather this all together so we can go forward this new creation is not the old creation made over or it could not be called a new creation aren't you glad that when you become a new creature in christ jesus you're not just the old person with the band-aid on i'm so glad that when i was born again by the baptismal he goes he didn't just pick me up and clean me up and put a band-aid on my wounds but he made me a new person and he made me such a new person on the inside that my soul is in an eternal condition now by the baptism of the holy ghost and in reality nothing can be added to my soul to make it any more perfect it is already in an eight day eternal condition and when we stumble in our spirits make mistakes in our flesh when we backslide when whatever is that we do we might get a little bit cold our soul remains there as a reminder that it's greater than whatever we experience in our bodies whatever we experience in our spirits and it reminds you that you are quickened you are raised you are not the old person patched up you are a new creature in christ jesus and so we need to become disciplined in confessing from our souls that when our minds begin to doubt when we experience difficulties when even our bodies are sick you say body the fact that you're sick is no testimony that i'm not a daughter of god in my soul i'm well in my soul i'm healed and my soul actually has a new body within it that's going to be developed around this body and you just confess that you anchor in them so he says we are a new creation not the old one patched up he says or it could be called a new creation this is exactly what it says new creation it is another creation distinct from the old one so this is what puts you in harmony with jesus christ so he says he is the first of that creation he was god created in the form of man now by his spirit he's creating many sons unto himself otherwise the bible could not call him the first born among many brethren notice the bible does not say the firstborn among many step brothers half brothers doesn't say it it's brethren he is the first born among many so he is uh the being the firstborn among many there are certain things rights attributes characteristics in the law of the firstborn that would be attributed to christ and now he's saying that there's many that are also born of the same word and the same spirit says their god now has by his spirit his creating sons and to himself god the creator creating himself a part of his creation right let's just be honest with ourselves it's hard to kind of get your head around that god the creator created himself a part of his creation this is the true revelation of god this was his purpose not just to have a son christ jesus but to have many sons and daughters like him to himself this is the true revelation of god this was his purpose we understand that this great home of the bride is to be here on earth and i want to take just a a kind of a detour for a few moments and i've pondered this deeply over these these weeks as we've thought about these things the the burden of the word that's expressed in approaching the subject of in the beginning it's not just to have a new take on genesis chapter one not just to fill your head with with types and and shadows listen you don't ever see a type and then build a truth around it you can only use types once you see the truth so if we use a scripture as a type it's only because i'm pointing you to a truth that we already know in the word of god but that's not the purpose of the exercise the burden is so that you would recognize who you are the burden is so that you can see yourself in the mirror of god's word and read this bible as a way of saying this bible is trying to communicate to me who i am for the moment that i'm living in right now not trying to communicate to you something where you're just merely reading a history or even communicate to you something so that you can look forward to something else but to give you boldness for the moment that we're living in right now so that we can overcome the challenges that we're experiencing right now and meet the mark of this age right now god is wanting you to see yourself in the mirror of god's word so that you can say if this is what i was and this is what i'm going to be then i must be that right now that unbroken continuity of the word that has been and the word that will be is the word that is now the same yesterday today and forever and there's so many pressures upon us so many distractions there's there's junctures of time even naturally there's events that are taking place politically that there's there's things that are taking place globally in terms of a pandemic there's social pressure there's political pressure there's great changes in shifting in economies and this is globally and there's a lot of unrest uh even here at home especially here in the united states and we're conscious of that uh we're we're in tune to the the political things around us the social things around us and it's very difficult for us to not be impacted by uh them and no matter how much we preach faith you would never want to be dismissive that there's things that are taking place in the world today that directly impact us uh there's things that are going to affect us and there's things that decisions that are made and turns that take place in our life that are out of our control that are natural that impact us and so we wouldn't want to be remiss and say just pull yourself up by your bootstraps ignore it get over it the word is the same but what we want to do as believers is see how the word addresses those things around us see how that modern events are already being made clear to us by prophecy we can place them where they are in scripture and that gives us confidence as jesus said i'm telling you now what's going to happen so that when it happens you can have comfort that i told you beforehand and we can go into the word of god and see we've been warned beforehand these things would happen and it gives us confidence that god already warned us therefore he's made provision for us and in the message recognizing your day and its message brother branham's using this language of national force so we could say political force economic force social force political force national force put israel in her homeland and we see that through a a war through the hand of of perverse men who brought a a a genocide upon a people and and through that what was called even termed the holocaust which which happened you got to be careful that you don't give yourself over to conspiracy theories because then you just go right into a path where you just start denying things that are scriptural things that are in the word of god and so the holocaust that takes place and to be able to call it the tender hand of jehovah is absolutely astounding but what was it it was god allowing national force because god deals with israel after the flesh to put israel back in a natural land and because it was a natural land there's natural forces that took all these jews scattered all around the world and forced them back into their natural land he says national forests will put the church in the world council of churches so natural things national forest politics economic social pressure all sorts of natural things will put the church in the world council of churches just as it put israel in their homeland he says but this is where we come in the power of god will put the people in the bride natural force won't do it political pressure is not going to put one member of your family into the bride economic pressure will not put any member of your family in the bride your own personal pressure upon them will not put them in the bride the power of god will put the people in the bride he said the world force is this way the world force is that way but god forces upward the spirit of god which is the word of god my word is spirit and life so the word is the spirit will put the bride in her place in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth and the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters this is now god now showing that the word the spirit of god which is the word of god that's what moves upon darkness that's what moves upon chaos that's what moves upon the void that's what moves upon the brokenness and the darkness and then brings something out of it it doesn't take natural force it doesn't take national force but it takes the word of god to move upon something and he says it will put the bride in her place she'll recognize her position in the word by what the word of god then she's in christ it'll put her in her place no national force will do it but national force did drive israel to the homeland national forces of the world council churches council churches will drive every organization into it so we see national forests doing its part and god will use natural things in our lives there's things that get our attention even our emotions and there's ways that god gets our attention but at the end of the day it's the word of god that puts us in our place there can be all sorts of uh things transpired in our lives to turn turn our lives upside down and cause us to rethink what's going on and cause great harm and it could be a loss of a job it could be uh interpersonal relationships it could be a lot of things that are taking place things getting turned upside down and it could be getting people's attention oh my lord i want to be in your graces i want to be in your will i and even a desire to surrender yourself to the lord and and you can look at all these external things that are getting your attention but if you don't come and surrender yourself to the word of god you'll still be subject to the same forces and those same forces that put you in that state of anxiety to come to church and to try to serve god if you haven't yielded yourself to the power of god those very same forces can then work on you to get you right back out of church again because it's not those things that ultimately lurk upon the believer it is yielding ourselves to the power of god he says but the power of god will raise the bride into glory out of it it's the power of god to raise the bride into glory out of the out of the churches out of laodicea out of these things that we see around us the power of god will put the bride in her place and the statement is used so frequently i think it begins to lose its meaning and i don't want to join my voice with all those who are repeating it just so that it dulls our ears to the significance of it but when brother brahma is preaching christ as the mystery of god revealed which is which is just the silence from that seventh seal being lifted and it's been very directed towards the bride it's a message speaking directly to her to understand who she is and he says if the church only knew its position and this isn't just knows it's it's it's nomination but a full understanding of where it's placed he says it will one day then the rapture will go when it knows what it is so there's a there's a power that comes with the position he says oh if it only knew its position why the power of god is wanting to place the church in her position to recognize her position in the word and that that's gonna force her upwards oh if the church only knew its position he says this in 1957 see if the church so if the church only knew its position he says and the greatest hindrance in the church is fear they're afraid that it just won't work he says well it just won't for you that way it just will not work that way it must be absolutely believers he says not make believers but believers from the heart so the hindrance upon the church he says the greatest hindrance is fear he said it's the worst thing the devil could put on you is fear why there can be a confession of faith but if it's mixed with doubt it hinders that it it weakens your resolve it causes you to place your faith in a state of advance well it's kind of on pause well i believe but we believe but he's saying no it's not going to work for you that way we need to know our position without qualification we need to know our position without any kind of contingencies and to abandon ourselves to the place that god has called us to say lord you've called me to this this is what i am this is what the bible says about me and any voice of doubt or reason that comes to speak up you just say sit down sit down sit down this is what the word has to say about me and you're just telling every voice to quiet down and know your position and not allow a voice of reason a voice of history a voice of affection whatever it might be to bring up fear and cause you to doubt because it's hindering your faith and there's the the message comes and it tries to attack i say it tries it attacks and addresses this fear that brother abraham brethren's talking about in the sermon the god rich in mercy he says now we are a part of god you always was you don't remember it because you were only an attribute in god you were only in his thinking your very name if it was ever on the book of life it was put there before the foundation of the world he knew what you were he says i'm only saying this not to mix up doctrine but to straighten it out that we might get away from this fear and scare the doctrine of election the doctrine of predestination is it's one that the devil wants to muddy solely cause confusion on always leave the door open for you're in and then you're out but brother brahms trying to nail it down you were always a part of god and the reason why he's trying to nail this down is not to mix up doctrine but to straighten up doctrine and by straightening up doctrine he says it will help us to get away from this fear and scare and so if the church only knew its position and the greatest hindrance on the church today is fear fear of taking that position fear of believing there's some weakness in that position so the word is saying you're in this place from before the foundation of the world and i'm wanting to teach this i'm wanting to straighten this out so you can get away from fear and scare he says you don't know who you are you're not going to be but now you are the sons of god you always were the sons of god for when god had you in his thinking at the beginning we're going all the way back to the beginning to understand that what has unfolded from genesis chapter 1 verse 1 to today is not coincidence it's not happenstance it's not just the the the lottery that's resulted in where we are today and we see the confusion the chaos and all the uncertainty like oh where is this handed where is it going what's the end going to be god can say i have thoughts about you that i've had from the beginning thoughts of peace to bring you to a determined end to bring you to a place of safety to bring you to a place of at rest and in the last days to bring a great triumph and a great glory in the midst of great darkness don't worry about all the fear and scare don't worry about the economics don't worry about the politics don't worry about all the things that are being said to cause hindrance to cause doubt he says get away from the fear and scare this is where you're tied to not branham tabernacle not to a church not to a man but to god who in the beginning had you in his thinking he says you have to be some part of you your life that's in you now had to be with god before there well before he was even become material here on earth before it was anything god you were one of his attributes he knowed what your name would be and it continues on talking about even the color of hair the color of your eyes he knew what it would be so it gives me confidence that he liked he liked if you like the color of my hair maybe he likes the thinness of it and i can save save money on not having to go out and get a hair transplant and different things say lord as brother said i haven't lost to one amen listen in christ there's nothing you haven't lost here that you haven't already gained there 100 fold is going to be restored back to you let's not wring our hands and fret and worry and be anxious just have this attitude god's in control god's looking out after this what was one of the things that creeped into the church that caused its demise how can we protect this great truth you don't need to go into protection mode god's the watcher god's the keeper there's a there's a little security sign in front of my house that we're renting it says i think it says adt no and this is no commentary on security systems but it said this house is protected by adt and i wanted to put on there this house is protected uh by the scripture it says if the watchman if god doesn't watch the house the watchman watcheth in vain that's who we're trusting in so the watchmen still watch doesn't say god watches the city the watchmen don't watch we still watch but we're trusting that god's watching also lest our watching is not in vain that's who we're trusting in that's who we're believing in and so when brother branham brings us to this your life that's in you now had to be with god before there even before he become material on earth before there was anything you were in him this isn't just this is to show us that it's not just god being expressed in creation if there's something being squeezed out something being portrayed then you are being expressed as being a part of him you are a part of him so as god begins to express himself in his creation let's identify with that creation and now that's uh i want to just take a step further in this and um if i know it may seem to be a little bit hot it's hotter on this side of the room than it is that side uh and uh so i don't know if uh if this is if this is like the the valley and and that's the i mean you're facing east i think that works out well i think maybe you're not facing these i don't know which direction you're facing but listen to this now as we want to look at genesis 1. and i i realize i'm going to have to start maybe uh going a little bit quicker here and so i'll make reference to these things instead of reading it in the book of genesis genesis chapter 1 details god creating the physical visible realm that the earth exists within and so this is now god creating this this atmosphere and firmament and the and galaxies and and universes that the earth exists within it's what's physical it's what's visible it is what is observable that's what science is observing even with their telescopes and their satellites they're observing the physical creation that the earth exists within regardless of how expansive that is genesis chapter 1 is describing that expanse and detailing the creation of this physical visible realm that this earth exists within and as we've been reading in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth and we read verse two we've made reference to that we've looked at that in some detail i want to look at verses three and four and god said let there be light and there was light and god saw the light that it was good and god divided the light from darkness now as we've seen already that in these first two verses something's being expressed to us that portrays an uh a a reality in our own personal lives whether we identify with the the void and darkness of chapter two and the spirit of god moving upon those elements to change them and to bring forth a new creation but we also identify with the heaven and the earth there's different ways that we've we've identified this now in verses three and four something is being expressed to us for our benefit and i want to go through a few um elements just to a few principles that i'm just kind of laying down and there's a part of me that likes to uh and you may have experienced this before to take one point and just drill it down to where you just kind of exhaust every quote every scripture you nail it down where it's airtight and like well you can't disagree with that that's exactly what that means but i just want to make reference to these things very quickly just to understand these building blocks light represents life so in the beginning god said let there be light and there was light so light represents life and light came by the spoken word god said let there be light and there was light so light came by the spoken word and the word now characterizes it god saw the light and now it characterizes the light as good so the spoken word bring for brings forth light and then the word says that light is good so that's the characterization of light now to substantiate that light is equated with life brother brahman says in the message turn on the light no life can come outside of light light produces life there could be no life outside of light natural or spiritual there must be and only light can come by the word of god god's word is the light when it's manifested now that's a mouthful god's word is light when it's manifested so when the word is manifested that's light when the word is manifested and it's light then that's what brings life because a life comes by light that's natural and spiritual he says in looking under jesus only god's word produces light he says in a man that can turn on the light he says these are just principles i'll just summarize very quickly that light comes by the spoken word and without light nothing can live so light comes by the spoken word and then with light comes life he says in christ is the mystery god revealed the word only has life says again just in a little bit after that the word produces its own life so when god says in the beginning god said let there be light and there was light and it was characterized as good he's taking light and he's associating it with the word which is life light is life this is good and once the light is manifested then darkness is exposed to this point there there's there's now going to be a distinction where there's going to be a division if all you knew was darkness it said well this is darkness it's just the reality but then once light comes and once light begins to be expressed there's a contrast between light and darkness and darkness now represents death when god sees the light he characterizes it as good and he says and he separated the light divided the light from the darkness so he's dividing good from bad good from evil as you might say so it stands darkness stands opposite to light and it's created because of light and and i think that's maybe uh that might be a clumsy way of saying it and i and i i can do that both personally and behind the pulpit maybe use a real clumsy way of asking a question a real clunky way of expressing something but if you could understand this that darkness we gain understanding of what darkness is in light of light so there's something that darkness is made manifest by light and in ephesians even says that whatsoever dust just make manifest is light now in isaiah chapter 45 verse 7 and i know i'm throwing a lot out there and i apologize for that the the in the beginning god said let there be light light came by the spoken word and by light comes life and god says that is good he says that is good so then he says this in isaiah 45 verse 7 so that we can see the difference between as god divided the light from darkness so that we can see this he says i form the light so god says i form the light light is formed because it comes from the word but now it says and create darkness now and i'm not just trying to be patent or you know take differences in words and try to make a point that that isn't relevant and and bring us down a path that really has no substance to it but i believe it's a distinction that is important that god forms light from himself or from the spoken word god said let there be and there was yes it's a creation but it's a further expression from something that is existing that's already there which is god but then he says and i create darkness so darkness is created and it comes from a and i know this distinction may not make much sense right now but it's something separate now i form light i create darkness these are two different words that are being used it says i make peace and create evil i the lord do all these things so light is formed it comes by the spoken word of god but then once light is formed darkness is created and whereas light is equated with good darkness is equated with evil i form the light i make peace i create darkness i make dark create darkness and create evil so darkness is associated with evil darkness is associated with those things that are bad light is associated with good life and peace so then when jesus christ comes in matthew chapter 4 verse 16 the people which sat in darkness saw great light and to them which sat in the region in shadow of death light is sprung up so people are sitting in darkness under the shadow of death and what happens a great light comes people are sitting in darkness and under the shadow of death light is sprung up that's the answer to death that's the answer to darkness you're not going to get life out of death you're not going to get darkness light out of darkness light comes life comes as opposed to death and darkness so just like it was in the beginning where there was darkness and there was void and there was depravity the spirit of god begins to move upon the face of the waters god says let there be light and there was light and now darkness has a distinction darkness stands in contrast to light and what is it it's light springing up where there was a shadow of death it's light springing up where there was darkness so when christ comes we see once again just as heaven and earth in genesis chapter 1 verse 1 when christ came heaven and earth embraced they kissed now we see again with christ it's reviving what was happening in the beginning light has sprung up when christ comes and brother banham says this about darkness he says what is satan anything contrary to the word he doesn't have salvation he doesn't have light his kingdom is darkness in the end thereof is death darkness and death are satan's kingdom and i like this brother brown repeat it again what is satan's kingdom anything contrary to the word of god death and darkness are contrary to the word which is life and light darkness and death are satan's kingdom so what's being portrayed in genesis chapter 1 verses 3 and 4 is not merely an account of how that god brings forth life and brings forth creation and sets the stage for the garden of eden but god's expressing something in this god's identifying light from darkness separating them it's john chapter 1 verses 1 to 5. in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god the same was in the beginning with god all things were made by him the word which is god and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life in the life was the light of men and the light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehended it not and it says john came to bear witness of that light john wasn't the light so even in this day just as john bore witness of the light and he himself was not the light in this hour any minister of god or any prophet is not the light but they bear witness of the light and so this scripture is showing once again in the beginning was the word and life is the light of the light of men is a life the light shines in darkness is shown in darkness in genesis 1 is shining in darkness in the days of christ on earth and the darkness cannot be penetrated by it but yet it's still shining so darkness does not have the capacity though the darker the color the more light it absorbs it does not absorb the light to its demise it lacks the ability to reflect the light it lacks the ability to internalize it and project it back out so it absorbs it can't really understand it or comprehend it it's dead to the light and that's the expression of christ that is coming so jesus says in john 3 19 and this is the condemnation that light has come into the world and men love darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil it's the contrast between light and darkness between good and bad so the in the begone in the beginning and in the beginning of the creation of god he's separating light from darkness and this is an expression to us this is expressing something to us today and in the message it is the rising of the sun there was a time when the world was laying in utter darkness is without form and was void and was all covered with water and it was laying there in the dark dismal gloomy atmosphere and the spirit of god moved upon that water and said let there be light god had a reason to do that god doesn't just move upon your heart without a purpose without a reason that that's why we you just you just don't want to have a charismatic service just for the purpose of the spirit of god moving and get yourself worked up bodily exercise prophet little and if that relates to physical exercise i could use a little prophet but as it relates to worship and getting all excited and everything it profits little the spirit of god moves for a reason he just doesn't pour out his spirit so that we can say i dreamed i spoke in tongues i did this i did that lord let it accomplish your purpose let it further your objective may it make a permanent difference lord so he says the spirit of god moved upon the water he had a reason to do that for down beneath that water there was seeds that he had planted and it had to that had to have that sunlight to make it live oh that's what the moving of the spirit is ultimately for to make seeds live to make life live to bring more life out of you lord if your spirit moves within a service may i not just radiate within the four walls of my tabernacle man i just radiate within the the confines of a convention service or a camp or a church service but lord let my life then be lived out before the people before my family let it be at work let it be a school let's be on the job lord let life be brought out of me by light let it bring it out of me it had to have that sunlight to make it live and because there was a deep calling to the deep because there was a seed that needed light to live there had to be light come forth to bring expression so the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters why there were seeds that were planted there and it had to have sunlight to live this picture that brother branham paints in genesis chapter 1 it's gloomy it's dismal it's dark but there's a seed in there so the word has to come forth as sunlight to make it live now listen to what he says in the message shalom the world is one of the most chaotic times of darkness that it's ever stood in now this is january 12 1964. i've read to you from december 29 63 january 25th 1964 and now that we're reading from january 12 1964 there's a theme of all these things he's identifying right here at this transition from 63 to 64. and he's identifying it's shalom there is a man here who can turn on the light what he says no matter how dark it gets there's a man here who could turn on light and rapture that church and he tells the story of how a boy and a girl go down in these deep dark caverns and they're in these caverns and all of a sudden this engineer turns the light off and it gets really dark and this little sister begins to cry out and fear and scream oh no oh no but her brother maybe his name was william is standing there and she's like brother bill brother bill oh no what are we going to do it's dark but he's the one standing next to the engineer so he says don't worry honey there's a man here who can turn on the light and rapture the church don't worry sister how dark it gets don't worry how depraved against don't worry about it there's a man here who can turn on the light i'm so glad that we had a prophet who was standing next to the engineer and knew no matter how dark and chaotic laodicea is there has been a rising sun for the bright age shalom good morning thy light has come rise and shine it hasn't risen upon the world but it's risen upon thee and his glory shall be seen upon thee he's expressing this so he says in shalom the world is one of the most chaotic times of darkness that it's ever stood in and yet it's standing in again the most blessed light that it ever did shine in wow now he says that because he's standing next to the engineer the difference is just like it was in the beginning this is how he wants us to understand it so i'm going to go back to the beginning so you can understand where we're standing now this isn't a fruitless exercise to examine genesis chapter 1 because in christ is the mystery of god revealed that's what we're going back to restored back to eden and now when he's looking at the condition of laodicea he says it's just like it was in the beginning he says it's just like it was in the beginning when there was gross darkness upon the earth and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the water and said let there be light and god separated the light from the darkness and i believe that we are now living in that hour again that when god is separating light from darkness and he's pressing it to the other side of the world that the light might be made manifest if you should do anything you should make it personal don't make it political don't say oh if that's the case then this party's got to win if that's the case then this has got to happen don't make it political listen if right all of a sudden all the candidates stepped down and you had some god-fearing uh a christian believed in the oneness of god baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ and he was to become the next president of the united states it still doesn't change a thing does it change a thing god's word moves right on god is going to use whatever is there god's word is going to be fulfilled so we wouldn't say oh reset things are going to be different you know salvation's come to america no this thing's on a path let it take its path i'm on a different one in the preview of the bride laodicea which brethren said that church that walked by was the the church from united states of america he said and he catches it later and when he preaches a couple weeks later i didn't recognize it then but he says this is laodicea and what was she doing dancing to the beat of rock and roll naked and going down into chaos going down into the darkness and at the same time laodicea is going into the darkness what was the bride doing rising up and what was the thing that got the bride out of step she was watching who was going down i wonder what's next for them and then she gets out of step don't take your eyes off the third pull don't get your eyes on the squeeze don't try to figure out all the national forces and how they're going to work on you the word is what works on you the word is what going to do it i don't want to be distracted by what's going on around there i don't want to be distracted by what's happened in the world today master no mass pandemic or no pandemic it's the word that's working mightily in me that's what's making the difference the only the only the only mask i'm worried about is anyone that would keep me veiled from christ and i'm so glad he's unveiled himself he's removed his mask in this hour for us to see him as he is he says once again we're living in that hour when god is separating light from darkness here we are in the end and god's doing what he did in the beginning he says the same thing and what's the fair first characteristic of christ in the rapture brother brown brings a great revelation of how the rapture is a cycle it's a process and he preaches the rapture message and he brings it into a a reality that is not a church waiting for something to happen but a church experiencing something that is happening in that the rapture is not a date on the calendar but the rapture is the word made life and the word made light when it's manifest in the time that we're living in right now and it's the resurrection and the life made known to his elect and his bride right now because the lord himself has descended with a shout out it is the rising of the sun that's the time we're living in now and brother bam takes psalms 27 verse verses 1 to 5 and what's the very first characteristic that comes into view in the rapture cycle the lord is my light and my salvation the lord is the strength of my life oh hallelujah the lord is my light and my salvation the lord is the strength of my life so what does david say whom shall i fear of whom shall i be afraid while light has come light is life therefore i do not fear death light has come its deliverance and salvation from darkness therefore i do not fear i will not be afraid i will not be a fearful i and this will i be confident oh praise the lord the lord is my light and because he's light he's my salvation that's the very first characteristic that he reveals himself as in the rapture is light because once again god is separating light from darkness in the chaos and the blackness of laodicea when the holy spirit wanted to write it out and it was even in the heavens with the blackout of the moon she was completely black there was no light left and brother branham wanted to he wanted to keep giving a sliver of light but it was total darkness and it's right when it's totally blacked out that god speaks at the opening of the word and what does he bring light separated from darkness it's a light that not even laodicea can brag about because she's put christ outside the church she can't say oh i i had that light that's where that came from no it's completely blacked out and then god stands on the outside behold i stand at the door knock a fugitive in his own church so once again just as he did in the beginning god is separating light from darkness so if i could uh just reset a little bit god in the beginning and in the beginning of creation of god he's separating light from darkness and he describes it in the rising of the sun how the spirit of god moved upon the water because there were seeds there and it had to have sunlight to live then brother bam says that's the time we're living in now in the message shalom we're living in a time where god's doing the same thing what does that mean there's got to be seeds here that need to live and the darkness of laodicea will never produce it the church cannot produce it it's got to take the word which is light which brings life to produce it so in the fourth seal he says this in genesis chapter one it said in the beginning god created heavens and earth period that's all now the world without form and void god said i believe every seed and he says and i and he's in this conversation sorry he says i believe every seed was laying right there from some other civilization or something okay very interesting there's many different theories on even what it means before the foundation of the world and based upon the construction of the greek there's many theologians that believe that there was a world that existed with satan being the ruler over it before god uh began to say let there be light and banish satan and begin to place him in another realm and bring forth creation and there's a lot of rich things to read about and to explore in these things now brother mann says there was season maybe from another civilization or something and he said as soon as the water lifted off the light struck it up come from the trees and everything this is where i'm describing this process and and i wish he could have labored more on on that thought says the same thing with the human being it's a type then what god did in the beginning and this is where i i wanted to go into these different principles from future home uh and to express some of these uh these parallels and these types and we have the we have the privilege of his god teres the union in the sky and the change of our body maybe we'll have time to get into those things i know in my heart i would love to have an evening service as god would allow us to be able to do that for those who'd want to fellowship around the word in the evening but he's saying the same thing with the human being it's a type so what happened in genesis chapter 1 is a type of what god wants to do with the human with the individual with his elect what god has done to the earth god also does the individual whether it be fire spirit water spirit and the baptism the blood water and spirit all those different elements the same thing he does the earth the same thing he does to the person he says when all the mist is moved away and the revealed truth to that real seed laying there still dermatized and the light of the gospel can strike it by true indication of the word it will live hallelujah so i can see myself in genesis chapter one there was darkness there was void there was confusion but down in that earth was a predestinated seed and it needed the sunlight to live so god said let there be light and there was light and god began to separate the light from the darkness to do what to bring life out of that seed and that's the same thing god's doing today he's separating light from darkness not to build a great church not to build people up in arrogance or heal their humanity but to bring life out of the elected seed to bring life out of the humanity and all that mystery that's in your life once it's moved away by the revealed truth to the seed laying there then the light of god's gospel can strike it by true vindication you will live oh praise the lord the revealed truth is that so the dynamics of the word being preached to you driving away the mist and a revelation of the word striking to the seed the beginning was a type of that the beginning was a type of what you're experiencing now in laodicea and the message man that can turn on the light he says god separates light from darkness and he separates death from life he does it by his word his word is what always brings forth now the seed was already upon the earth i believe god had planted the seed and just as long as the sun could get to that seed it would begin to grow and that's the reason it only taken days to bring forth these things because the seed was already earth all it needed was light and that's the way god has today keep an eye on that parallel that's the way god has today his seed is already here his word the only thing it needs is light on it and he is that light for he is the word and the word and the light are the same thing the life in there is the light of the word is the life the germ of life lays within the grain and the grain is the life is what breaks forth and brings forth the life out of the grain that's the way that christ in the word makes the word do what it's supposed to do just like the life in the grain of wheat or whatever it is it makes the wheat do what it's supposed to do because it's the life that's in it that's if you want to you want to do what you're supposed to do let the word work on you it makes the word the wheat it makes the wheat do what it's supposed to do it was brother barry i made the comment over the last several months about the buried coffee he said that we in in these terms you wouldn't want to accomplish by legislation what needs to be accomplished by revelation we can come up with legislation and we can legislate a lot of things that we see in the word and just make it as law make it legalistic and make it legislation and then us being creatures of habit and some of us even being more disciplined than others we can tow the line of legislation but it never be revelation and then just change the law and then what happens you just go right back but if it's by revelation you can mess with the letter of it all you want but if what you're living is revelation then there's no legislation that changes that it's a revelation to you it's anchored it's the same yesterday today and forever and so it's the light of the gospel that makes you do what you're supposed to do just like the light of the the life and the grain does what it's supposed to do because the life that's in it so life is only by the word of god made manifest life comes only by the word of god made manifest as long as it's just in the book like this it can still be questioned as long as it's a book as long as it's a tape as long as it's an mp3 as long as it's just letter you can question it and i can say this about you looking into it or whether people look at you and question it as long as it's in a book it can be questioned but once in your life once it's lived out in your life there's no more question to it oh i don't know about this i don't know about that as long as it's in the book ask the questions reason with the question with it wrestle with it but once god has spoken to you then you can no longer question it you could say hey that's a good question all i know is god spoke well i never thought about that i didn't know that word meant that that's that's outstanding but god spoke as long as it's in this book it can still be questioned as long as it's only in printed form it can be questioned as long as it's only preached behind a pulpit it can still be questioned but once it's lived out in your life there's no more questions as long as it's just in a book and he says like this it can still be questioned well i don't want to just live by a book i want to live by the lamb's book of life as long as it's in a book it can still be questioned it's time that we start reading the right book because your book of life none of us have a good one and when i say good it's blemish blim is free it doesn't matter how old you are you look at your book your baby book you look at your history like okay all right i'm not perfect but start reading from a different book the lamb's book of life doesn't record one of your mistakes one of your heirs it it it records your character which is your name the book the the books that are open and people are going to be judged according to the works why their life is recorded in the record of the wheat plan but you're the seed all that's there is the germ all that's there is the life not the record of the plant as long as it's just in a book it can still be questioned but when it's made manifest then you see the product of what it spoke of being manifested then that is light on the word the word said so then when it comes to past that is life in light light bringing life light brings life you put into the basement cover it over and never bring forth anything because it can't there's no light there but as soon as light strikes it then it'll bring forth life if it's a dermatitis seed that's the same thing it is in the word the word is god when the light strikes it it brings the word to life again that's what god is doing today separating light from darkness and in the message shalom as we've quoted from it in the one in january 19th 1964. this is just a week after he said the world's in one of the most chaotic times it's ever been him but the most blessed light because god just like he was at the beginning is separating light from darkness he's referring to the fulfillment of revelations chapter 10. he says stand the symphony stay in god's word no matter how hard it is stay right with it wherever god is beating sometimes he causes trouble to break the bands to set you free he does that oh my if there's trouble just say lord break the bands sometimes god causes trouble to break the bands to set you free and we're running from the trouble that god's wanting to use to break the bands he does that you say well i don't know what to do he does what's the difference you're just playing the part he's the one that's got you in his hand he directs you remember it's all done by a sign we see the time we're living in by the sign we're living and so we know what the symphony does today it's a separating time taking the light from the darkness he says let's say it together so you won't forget it because i feel to say this and then and then it says that brother adam speaks and the congregation speaks in union union it's taken the light from the darkness he says let's say it again it's taking the light from the darkness what's happening it's taking the light from the darkness now before you start looking at that on a political spectrum an economic spectrum a personal relationship spectrum a geographical spectrum you have to first recognize that where it matters the most is the light he's taking out of you and separating from the darkness that was in you this is a personal experience what good would it be for there to be darkness in me and i'm i'm glory and and all the separation that's taken around me and i'm stiff arming everything else and i'm trying to get away from this and i'm trying to separate from that and i'm refusing this and i'm refusing that but light's never been separated or been brought out in me so that's what god is doing today he is separating he's taking light from darkness all the darkness and the death that i was in god is taking light out of that he says that's god's symphony he's shown it in the heavens he's shown it on the blackboards he's shown it by himself he promised it in the word we see it vindicated he's separating the wheat from the chaff he's taking the light from the dark amen because that's what he did in the beginning he took light from darkness now i'll uh i i've been right around an hour long here and i still have about an hour to go and i'm gonna i'm gonna just cut it short of that 59 minutes would be short of another hour i'm going to cut it short of that but maybe lay just a few uh elements in there for next time so let's look at genesis chapter 1 verses 14 to 18. oh i just want to go through this so quickly and god said let there be lights and the firmament of the heaven genesis chapter 1 verses 14 to 18. god said now we're looking at another part of the creation and look how god is really with light and darkness god said let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night and let them be for signs remember how brother branham said what happened in the beginning it's a type the same thing with the human being it's a type so he says let it be for signs and for seasons and for days and years and let them be for lights and the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth and it was so and god made two great lights now this there there's a i'll just try to bring this out even if i have to do it slowly when light came and it's referred to in matthew chapter 14 it says those that sat in the in darkness saw great light so now in the beginning it says and he made two great lights the greater light to rule the day and the lesser light to rule the night he made the stars also and god set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth and to rule over the day and over the night and to divide the light from the darkness and god saw that it was good so there's two great lights a greater light to rule the day a lesser light to rule the night so god is we look at these scriptures and there's a lot more we'd like to amplify in this but god is writing a bible and because we know when he put the stars in their place and he places the stars and the heavens that's the zodiac and brother man says it begins with the virgin it ends with the lion you see his first come you see a second coming and so god is writing the bible in the heavens as he's placing the stars he's writing the bible so what is he doing he's hiding a mystery in the heavens and as he places these things there's a drama that's being hidden there there's a story that's being told and there's a lot of people that look to the stars and they see these elements and they draft these things out but what god is doing is he's writing a bible his first bible in the heavens and he's hiding a mystery but he's also placing a representation of you in the heavens he's placing a representation of you in the sky not just a creation but an expression and brother branham in the lamb's book of life says we live by the alms of the people being ministers he's talking about we're all poor none of us are rich he says but brother in africa one little black boy about this high or a prostitute off the street yonder in louisville one soul saved in eternity when that star is shining yonder our name will be wrapped into it that's your value catch that you lead a soul to christ your name is wrapped up in that your name is forever connected with it and he calls it a star if you lead someone to the lord in eternity when that star is shining your name is wrapped up in that star he said there's your value he says what's good all the money all the popularity people to pat you on the back you become a great person what does that do to you not a bit it vanishes and stays here on the earth but one soul saved you'll see your name wrapped into it as long as the morning stars shall glitter so brother abraham identifies a soul saved a soul baptized in the body of christ he identifies them as a star so in genesis chapter 1 verse 16 he says he made the stars also god is placing the stars in their position and as he does he's representing every soul that's going to be placed into the body of christ the heavenly body of christ he's showing each star that's placed that represents you being placed and when you witness and you share from your heart when you speak the truth and that catches the attention of a soul that is lost and they come to christ your name is positioned in that star that means you had a representation already in genesis 1 16 of that soul and your connection with it as long as the stars are shining we can believe that their souls to be saved that my name can be wrapped up in it in eternity when that star is shining yonder he says in the working of the holy spirit where's value at then what is it i can think if i get one soul saved one little black boy or whatever it might be as long as there is an eternity and that light and the star of god is shining in glory my name will be associated with getting that soul saved oh a light and the star of god is shining in glory when the son of god comes into the body of christ he says it's like a star a star of god shining in glory he's equating us to stars in isaiah chapter 14 verses 12 to 14 how are fallen from heaven or lucifer son of the morning however cut down to the ground which does weaken the nations for thou hast said in thy heart i will ascend into heaven i will exalt my throne above the stars of god brother branham and god of this evil age says sons of god now so when he looks at the stars of god he calls them the sons of god that is the daughters of god it's the children he says i will sit also upon the mount of the congregation in the sides of the north i will ascend above the heights of the cloud i will be like the most high so satan wanted to achieve equality he wanted to achieve oneness but god had made him without the ability to create but in god having created this for contrast god had reserved oh hallelujah god had reserved a place for someone to be co-equal in every respect including the ability to create and it drove lucifer to madness why he wanted that place he wanted to exalt himself above the stars of god he wanted to be like the most high but god had reserved that designation for one person for christ and his bride he wanted to express himself in his son and express himself and a daughter in bridegroom and bride god wanted to become that and satan caused himself to want to ascend above that and what the stars of god so what's being dramatized in the heavens the bible says the heavens declared the glory of god christ himself was the glorious of the only begotten of the father the heavens declared the glory of god their line goes throughout all the earth and there's no place where their voice is not heard while the heavens are speaking the heavens declare god's glory the firmament shows his handiwork psalms 19 1-6 in them he says hath he set a tabernacle for the son which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber as rejoices as a strong man to run a race his going forth is from the end of heaven and his circuit unto the ends and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof this is beautiful poetry about the the sun the moon and the stars their relationship their harmony and how the sun the moon and the stars are all declared in the glory of god and there's no place on earth where that voice is not heard the heavens declare the glory of god christ himself is likened unto the morning star he calls himself in revelations chapter 22 verse 16 i am the bright in morning star so we see him as the son he's typed as the morning star he's typed as the son in them hath he said in the heavens he said a tabernacle for the son but then the very next verse says and the spirit and the bride say come he's the bride and morning star and the spirit and the bride together now in unison their voice is one it's not just the son speaking alone by himself now the spirit and the bride are in unison saying come now her voice is his voice now it's united throughout all the earth revelations 10 8 to 11 prophesy again and and the into the circuits of the earth from the ends thereof christ who is in the image of god in the glory of god we beheld his glory the glories of the only begotten of the father that's first corinthians 11 saying man is in the image and glory of god it says but the woman is the glory of the man so it says the heavens declare the glory of god it's not just the son that declares his glory but it's also the daughter that declares his glory the bride is the glory of christ the mystery of god now and this is just where i have to use summary language and try to wrap this up the bride now has come to a place where the mystery has unfolded to the fullness the bible says and he has put all things under his feet ephesians 1 22 and 23 and has put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things to the church now he defines the church which is his body the fullness of him that filleth all in all the bride is the fullness of him that filleth all in all when it comes out into the complete in this hour the full manifestation in this hour that's the season that we've arrived in the hour of the fullness where he says it comes out into his body which is his fullness the fullness of him that filleth on all i notice when he says that he had put all things under his feet so he's put all things underneath his feet that he might be the head to his body and his body is the bride the fullness of him the bride is the fullness of him and he says but all things have to be under his feet now in the in the beginning god separated light from darkness light is life darkness is death and in first corinthians chapter 15 verses 25 and 26 for he must reign till he hath put all enemies under his feet the last enemy that shall be destroyed is death so watch what god was doing now and and i i won't apologize for going along because this next part is just so exciting you'll forgive me you just immediately within the next 20 minutes like justified brother aaron notice what's being foreshadowed now this is the this is why i apolo i do apologize if i've labored it too long myself but i this is the part that just so thrills me for us to see this something is being foreshadowed in the beginning now that you ought to just reach out to grab a hold of and claim he says in genesis 1 16 and god made two great lights the greater light to rule the day and the lesser light to rule the night and he made the stars also so individually we are stars but now we see the sun which is christ and the moon collectively which is the bride and brother banham refers to the sun and moon it says just like the bride and bridegroom and speak to the rock he says in genesis when god made the sun and made the moon now the moon is the wife of the sun when the sun goes away the moon reflects the light of the sun on the earth now but think about this i'm getting excited what did he make the moon to rule over he made the sun to rule over the day but he made the moon to rule over the darkness he made the moon to rule over the night hallelujah he made you to rule over darkness he made you to rule over death in the very beginning he says it's not going to be the sun that rules the day but it'll be my wife she'll be the one to rule the darkness she'll be the one to defeat death oh hallelujah romans 16 20 and the god of peace shall brew satan under your feet shortly oh from the very beginning satan knew there'll be a seed come there's going to be a man born of a woman he's going to crush my head so the very first son born of a woman what did he cain do he killed him why he was afraid his head would be crushed and he's always been after that one but listen he can't do it this time he can't stop her she will crush his head the god of peace shall bruise satan under your feet shortly why because he must reign until all his enemies have been placed under his feet and the last enemy which shall be destroyed is death the last enemy that shall be destroyed is darkness and there was one that was made to rule the darkness and it was the moon the bible says in isaiah 30 verse 26 moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun no longer just a reflection no longer just a glimmer of light and darkness but behold thy light has come and the glory of the lord has risen upon thee and his glory shall be seen and they why the light of the moon has become as the light of the sun the same intensity the same fervency the same power the same glory the light of the moon shall be as the blood of the sun and the light of the sun shall be seven fold as the light of seven days in the day that the lord binded up the breach of his people headstone being united with capstone and healeth the stroke of their wound what is the stroke of sin death it's this day the light of the moon is the same as the sun you can look out you can see the sun you can see the moon there might be the odd time when the moon is glowing in such a way where you wonder there could be an odd twilight time where the sun may look like the moon that's not what's being expressed here saying the light of the moon shall be as brother man said life of his life power of his power she is him he writes into chapter three of the church age but the true church of jesus christ the bride is likened to pure gold her righteousness is his righteousness her attributes are his own glorious attributes her identity is found in him what he is she is to reflect what he has she is to manifest there is no fault in her she's all glorious within and without from the beginning to ending she is the work of her lord and all his works are perfect in fact in her is summed up and manifested the eternal wisdom and purpose of god in her is summed up and her summed up the eternal wisdom and purpose of god she is his righteousness her attributes are his own glorious attributes in the thigh tree and church age he says this about the bride this is when he's drawn the contrast between mystery babylon and the bride i'll just take what he says about you she is called the bride of christ she has called new jerusalem she's exalted to heaven sharing the very throne of god as the only place befitting such a queen you take the place that satan wanted no wonder he's howling no wonder he hates you no wonder he tries to turn things up side down and cause you to doubt these things bring draw you into the wrong places and cause confusion because you are called and ordained to occupy a place that was only reserved for you oh you are exalted to heaven sharing the very throne of god as the only place that's be fit for you there's only one place that's that's worthy of you the very throne of god to place you anywhere else you're more you're worth more he'd do you a disservice he says there's only one place i could put you that would do you any credit it's in my place the only place i could put you that could express to you how much i love you is my place the place i have to raise you to the highest place i have to exalt it to the highest place so that you can understand that's how much you're worth to me what is it darkness and delight from death and to life from the dust of the earth to the stars of heaven that pondered that and i thought of this when he says you're exalted to heaven you're exalted the new jerusalem you exalted to heaven and there's a time in the bible there was a woman named hedessa in the bible and she's a jew living in captivity and there comes a time when at this junction it's life or death for the jews and she's at this crossroads of life and death and it's the pivotal it's the pivotal story in the book of esther it says in chapter 2 verse 7 and he brought up talking about mordecai which is a small man maybe like five seven kind of like brother branham's height a small man he brought up hedessa brought up means he raised her up caused her to be faithful odessa means myrtle tree so here's this hedesa even that maybe a hard sounding hedessa it's earth brown it has its roots into the earth he says he raised her up and he says that is esther he's somebody to his niece or his cousin he brought up podessa his uncle's daughter he brought her up and it's not just tedessa but it's esther so though she has a name given to her that's myrtle tree that's earthbound that's rooted into the earth she's given another name in this as a gentile her name is star so she has one representation which is earthbound but she has another representation which is heavenly which is esther and it was already signifying though she was a captive though she was a prisoner though she was a slave in babylon as odessa she had a destiny for the throne and in esther chapter 3 verse 13 at this conspiracy of haman it says there were letters sent by post all the king's providences to destroy to kill and to cost to perish all jews this is the proclamation that goes out and we know from the book once it's said it can't be reversed the king could not say never mind uh you can't they you can't kill them but god by ordination by predestination had taken a hedesa and made her an esther and where was she placed right in the king's house and mordecai goes to and he's talking to her this time this is the next chapter verse 14 of chapter four and he's talking to esther listen think about what's happened haman has put this conspiracy into the place it's appointed for all of us to die and our lives are at stake it says if you hold your peace at this time then there's shall be enlargement and deliverance arise to the jews from another place but thou and thy fathers how shall be destroyed and who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this he's trying to tell her esther look at the path that you've taken how could it be that you're placed here now for this time this season these things that are taking place this is no coincidence you can't make this stuff up god has placed you in the king's house he's given you favor you're here now why because you're the source you're the source of our deliverance now let's all us wise men not all the king's counselors not all the ones that have been with them not all the wise men of the kingdom not all the ones that are his counselors but you the the hadessa the myrtle tree that's been made an esther to sit in his court you're the one through which the deliverance will come and so she was inspired by the message of the hour and the very next chapter in ephesians chapter five verses one to three excuse me esther chapter five verses one to three now it came to pass on the third day esther put on her royal apparel stood in the inner court of the king's house here's the bride's resurrection on the third day she puts on her royal apparel dressed in the god's word and stood in the inner court of the king's house over against the king's house and the king sat upon his royal throne in the royal house over against the gate of the house and it was so when the king saw esther now remember it was death to go there without being summoned what brought her faith by the message of the hour gave her faith to look at death and not be afraid of it anymore the message of the hour gave her confidence in the one that was in that room the one that was in the inner chamber the one that she would be seeing face to face with the host of camp again against me i will not fear one thing have i desired that will i seek after to behold the beauty of the lord to inquire in his temple i'm not afraid to come into the inner court why he's called me by my name he summoned me well i didn't hear it it's in here it's in my heart confidence draws me i know for such a time as this i could come boldly before the throne of grace and the king saw esther stand in the court and she obtained favor in his sight and the king held out to esther the golden scepter that was in his hand so esther drew near touched the top of the scepter then said the king unto her what wilt thou queen esther and what is thy request it shall be given thee to the half of the kingdom and i read one time in a commentary that this didn't simply mean she got her half it meant the rest of it was hers too that this is his way of saying it's all yours whatever you desire and what she asked for in the the next days that unfolded through these feasts feasting with her king in the presence of her enemy hallelujah seven-fold core seven-course meal feasted in the presence of her enemies is through that opening of that word and that communion with her king that she unfolds the conspiracy of this one who would bring her to death and she shares it with him and the king being unable to reverse the decree empowers her and her people to defend against the threat of death oh hallelujah and they gave her this commandment when the king granted the jews which are in every city to gather themselves together and to stand for their life to destroy to slay and to cause to perish all the power of the people in the province that would assault them listen death is still active death will still work on others death still has rain darkness has rain but there's a people in earth today that says i do not have to die because of sin death does not have hold over me i've been empowered by the word of god to look at death that would come to my door my family my children and say death no more why because he raised up the moon he raised up an esther from the dust to the stars not to rule over the day but to rule over death to rule over darkness that's my place he empowered the jews to say you've come to murder me i've got a right to fight back and to place death under your feet and it says in the next chapter thus the jews smote all their enemies with the stroke of the sword and slaughter and destruction and did what they would to all those who hated them let me just take a victory swig praise the lord it's beautiful the last enemy that shall be destroyed is death darkness and death are satan's kingdom what is light doing now separating light from darkness which light did it give to rule over darkness gave that to the bride and he says so when this corruptable shall have put on in corruption in this mortal you know what the word mortal means destined to die determined to die but it says when this mortal shall have put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the same that is written death and swallowed up in victory i'm living for that moment i'm living for that hour because that's the destiny of this bride in this end time we'll invite sister cassandra to come genesis chapter 22 verse 17 says this to abraham that in blessing i will bless thee and in multiplying i will multiply thy seed now remember it was to seed as to one that's to whom the promise was given and the the seed is christ but he is going to have a multiplication why because he's bringing many sons into glory and notice what he refers to left first he refers to first in the multiplication i will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven that's the first one that's mentioned what does that represent the royal bride to the royal abraham he says it has the sand which is upon the seashore that's the natural lineage to natural abraham but the first one that is mentioned is the royal bride to the royal bridegroom the stars of heaven and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies that's your promise why because he's made you to rule over darkness you have dominion right now over sin the world the flesh and the devil that's your that's your position today in christ you've been raised from the dust to the stars as i pondered this i was looking at the message desperation he says you can't be desperate till god speaks to you as god spoke to you he says old church rise and shake yourself pinch your conscience wake yourself up in this hour we must be desperate or perish there's coming forth something from the lord i know it is thus saith the lord there's coming forth something and we better get desperate it's between life and death it'll pass through us and we won't see it that tells me if it's between life and death then i need to get desperate he says oh church rise and shake yourself could we do that ourselves personally i must rise and shake myself i gotta wake myself pinch my conscience i must be desperate to perish that's why he said the days of playing church is over this isn't this isn't playing games we're not playing games with laodicea we can't think for a moment we've got the upper hand on this because we think we know who we are but we have to have a revelation there must be a desperation that comes with it i believe god has spoken to us because he's spoken to us i can get desperate you can't be desperate till god speaks to you go rise shake yourself make this part of your personal prayer today i want to shake myself i want to pinch my conscience i must be desperate or perish today in this hour once again he's separating life from death light from darkness i must be desperate it's between life and death let's stand to our feet he's made you to rule over the darkness shine shine like the sudden you are you want to say shine like the stars you are she alright let it shine let who you are be expressed bow our heads in prayer our gracious heavenly father lord we're so grateful for the privilege of being able to gather together as family to feast at your table to have a bible which has been unsealed to have a message that's been revealed to look into the word and see you face to face lord you knew who would be here today you knew who would hear the words that are preached may it be so personal to each individual they'll never doubt anymore your love for them may they not look at the book of their own life or how many times they've moved and all the different places they've gone and their ups and downs and their ends and out may they look to the new book the book of life now they look even to the beginning you place the star there and that star has never fallen it's never changed its position it stayed there as a testimony that one day you'll be hung in the gallery of god's elect
