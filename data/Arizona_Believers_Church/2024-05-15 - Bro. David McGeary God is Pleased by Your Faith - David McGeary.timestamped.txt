[0:00] one of the things that is obviously
[0:03] placing Us in this day and this time is
[0:05] we've received an end time message we
[0:07] know that it's it's the anointing of
[0:09] Elisha that was to turn the hearts of
[0:12] the children back to uh the faith of the
[0:15] fathers so it was a faith that was to be
[0:19] restored and it was uh through the
[0:21] ministry of Elisha and uh what I just
[0:25] desire to to minister to you tonight
[0:28] what's upon my heart is and some way not
[0:30] to give it a title but uh he's pleased
[0:33] by your faith so it is enough to believe
[0:38] on the word of God it's is the very
[0:41] requirement of what he's looking for in
[0:43] this day he he was would I find faith
[0:45] when I come and so our confidence can be
[0:49] in if we've receiv received the end time
[0:51] message that was to deliver the faith
[0:54] then that word is accomplishing exactly
[0:57] what God has sent it to perform
[1:00] our our role is to believe it amen so
[1:04] what we want to be aware of is uh is how
[1:08] God is moving in that and also uh
[1:12] everything that the devil would do to
[1:14] try to pre prevent that Faith from being
[1:16] fully effectual or perfect faith in our
[1:19] life and uh brother brandom where a lot
[1:22] of the inspiration we have is from this
[1:24] the ministry of perfect faith and we'll
[1:26] probably be reading from that quite a
[1:28] bit but I I do want to go ahead and turn
[1:29] turn through some additional scriptures
[1:31] if you turn with me to Hebrews chap 11
[1:33] it is the it is the faith chapter I
[1:36] don't think you could Minister on it
[1:38] with that faith without taking a text
[1:40] from there and in chapter 11 it would
[1:43] read now Faith is the substance of
[1:45] things hope for the evidence of Things
[1:47] Not Seen so from the very beginning we
[1:49] know that faith is a substance it's a
[1:52] positive and brother brandham all the
[1:55] way through his ministry you're not
[1:56] going to find it I don't think one
[1:58] sermon where he's not emphasizing the
[2:01] Dynamics of Faith where Faith's final
[2:04] resting place is the word of God we
[2:06] don't if Faith any place anywhere else
[2:10] is not a perfect Faith you can place
[2:12] faith in other things but as Believers
[2:15] what we're interested in is a perfect
[2:17] faith and the only place that you could
[2:19] have perfect faith is in a perfect word
[2:21] right it it's the only place you can
[2:23] have perfect Faith otherwise you have
[2:25] faith that is just as good as what
[2:26] you've put it in yes right so you you're
[2:30] confidence in somebody and when your
[2:31] confidence is broken it's because you
[2:33] put Faith or confidence in that person
[2:36] and they were just as good as
[2:38] the as they were right I mean your maybe
[2:43] your faith was pretty good I mean you
[2:44] had a perfect confidence in the person
[2:47] but what was your confidence in right so
[2:50] that that is a that is something that
[2:52] fundamentally people get confused
[2:55] because you're built to believe right
[2:58] you every every creation made in the
[3:00] image of God is is built with a tuning
[3:03] Crystal you're going to believe in
[3:05] something okay so it becomes very
[3:08] important to understand that there's
[3:10] people who have a strong conviction they
[3:12] have a faith it's probably to them imp
[3:15] paracle the evidence of their faith is
[3:17] their faith but they've placed it in
[3:19] something that is not perfect the only
[3:22] perfect resting place is the word of God
[3:24] heavens and earth will pass away but the
[3:26] word of God cannot pass away it's the
[3:29] very thing
[3:30] now we're it's exciting for us because
[3:34] we
[3:35] know through the through the Eagle
[3:37] Vision of a prophet that even the worlds
[3:40] were formed by faith because God
[3:42] believed his own word when it was spoken
[3:45] now how how incredible is that to
[3:47] understand that faith is never out of
[3:50] the
[3:50] equation okay I I one of the earliest
[3:54] experiences of me as a you know I as a
[3:57] young believer um was to see a miracle
[3:59] was my I had a dog it was dundy her name
[4:02] was dundy she was a she was a good dog
[4:04] and uh being loyal and compassionate she
[4:07] allowed me to take a brush grill a metal
[4:10] BR you know the metal brushes you
[4:12] normally scrub a grill with well it was
[4:15] quite the dearer I tell you what I was
[4:18] helping that dog out I was getting all
[4:19] that summer you know in the summer
[4:21] getting that winter fur out of there and
[4:23] all of a sudden she yelped and I looked
[4:26] down and I had created a a heat blister
[4:29] like er rer burn about this big on her
[4:32] and it really struck me it hurt right
[4:34] like how could she let me do this and
[4:37] just that uh her ability to endure the
[4:41] pain until she couldn't endure it
[4:42] anymore it moved me you know I was like
[4:45] oh my I can't believe I did this and
[4:49] right then when I wanted an answer there
[4:51] was an opposition that that said don't
[4:54] pray it's just a
[4:57] dog God's not going to hear your prayer
[5:00] well we rebuke that God heal we know
[5:04] we've heard about a story about a posum
[5:06] and a fish we've got a message that's
[5:09] imparted Faith right we've got something
[5:11] that has has given imparted Faith to us
[5:15] and as a recipient of that I I took my
[5:18] dog and I I held her to me and I just
[5:20] prayed a simple prayer that the Lord
[5:22] would touch her and miraculously that
[5:24] was gone now I'll tell you this was my a
[5:29] young experience but the very next
[5:31] thought was it was never there you're
[5:36] mistaken right so it it's it's it's
[5:40] important you understand now the same
[5:42] faith that had to pray then had to
[5:45] believe even in the absence now now the
[5:48] now the liar is still there it was never
[5:51] there that first it was it's he's not
[5:54] going to heal it now it's it was never
[5:56] there so what do you have you still have
[5:58] a carnal mind mind that only wants to
[6:01] accept the mental faculties that it's
[6:03] given in other words we know that if
[6:06] there was a wound there you would see it
[6:09] well the fact that it's no longer there
[6:10] what are you now having to doubt your
[6:13] mental faculties and that's what faith
[6:16] allows you to do is have a substance
[6:18] that's able to call those things as
[6:20] though they are that that are as though
[6:22] they are not right right and the things
[6:25] that are not as though they are so A Mir
[6:28] just Faith allows you
[6:30] it it it was just as
[6:33] definitive whether it was there or not
[6:36] but my eyes were even testifying to the
[6:38] fact it wasn't there so what did Faith
[6:39] have to do it still had to rest yeah
[6:42] that God performed a miracle so don't
[6:45] ever think that faith is dependent or
[6:47] somehow is has an obstacle of these five
[6:50] senses
[6:52] right I I'll I'll tell you right now
[6:55] these five senses will always be in
[6:57] opposition to Faith because if they
[7:00] weren't it would no longer be Faith so
[7:03] I'm thankful there's still some if you
[7:05] will uh Faith still has to have its work
[7:09] because even after a miracle is
[7:12] performed there's faith and why am I
[7:15] happy for that because without faith
[7:17] it's impossible to please God and your
[7:19] faith is pleasing right so what's on our
[7:21] heart is even in that opport even after
[7:24] the miracle performed now upon my lips
[7:27] I'm testifying that he's the same
[7:28] yesterday today and forever and I'm
[7:30] sharing that God still heals animals
[7:34] right now I I know my my experience is
[7:37] is not unique I could I imagine if we
[7:38] went through this room right now things
[7:40] are rising up in all of us I remember
[7:43] when God did this he came on the scene
[7:45] for this and we're we're we're gathered
[7:47] together as Believers recipients of a
[7:50] faith that is still performing the
[7:52] supernatural amen um
[7:55] Romans 10:1 17 so so then Faith come by
[7:59] hearing and hearing by the word of God
[8:02] right so the the testimony of the word
[8:06] is going to is going to Quicken faith in
[8:08] you and you're a carrier of that so
[8:11] that's what one thing that um it is from
[8:14] Faith to Faith and it's and you are
[8:16] given the capacity to share Faith it's
[8:21] good I like by by putting the word of
[8:24] God on your lips it was always a mystery
[8:26] how can I impart eternal life that's a
[8:28] powerful statement from a prophet that
[8:30] you as Believers have the power to
[8:32] impart eternal life and it is because
[8:34] you're a carrier of the word when you
[8:37] take the word upon your lips and it's it
[8:40] it and it's it's quickened a word in it
[8:43] season the holy spirit is there to brood
[8:45] out over it and to bring it to pass and
[8:47] we believe that you cast your bread upon
[8:49] the Water we should always be ready to
[8:51] give a response and a word and we want
[8:53] to be in the channel and yield us so
[8:56] that God can Quicken the word through us
[8:58] and we could be a living testimony
[9:02] amen now this is the interesting thing
[9:05] in Hebrews 4: two it says For unto us
[9:09] the gospel was preached as well as unto
[9:11] them but the word preached did not
[9:14] profit them not being mixed with faith
[9:17] and them that heard it so again it goes
[9:19] back to the principle faith is a gift of
[9:21] God so the same word can could could be
[9:25] spoken out and and that what you have to
[9:28] realize is the fact that you can believe
[9:30] it that you have the capacity that you
[9:33] have something in you that does not
[9:34] question that receives the word of God
[9:37] is all the Vindication that you should
[9:40] need to be resting that the word is
[9:43] performing a work in your life there's
[9:46] no other evidence that you need to rest
[9:47] in it's not because you feel it it's not
[9:50] because uh you you uh you know you got
[9:54] emotional it's not because you shouted
[9:56] it's not even because you could feel the
[9:57] anointing it's because the word stands
[10:00] absolute and Perfect by itself it's the
[10:03] word that's what you're resting on the
[10:05] faith that you have is not a sympathy
[10:08] Faith it's not a it's not a form of
[10:10] belief it's not an emotion but it is
[10:14] absolutely tied to the word of God
[10:16] because Revelation and Faith are pretty
[10:19] much the same thing right you don't you
[10:21] by
[10:23] Revelation understand the love letter
[10:25] that the word of God is when it speaks
[10:28] to you it has has life and it has
[10:30] meaning and it it is a dynamic that that
[10:34] that the world tries to imitate and all
[10:37] every inspiration that's out there
[10:39] really tries to steal from the
[10:41] inspiration that God showed in the very
[10:43] beginning with Adam and Eve with with
[10:45] Adam walking in the garden it was that
[10:47] love relationship that when someone
[10:50] could understand something that said on
[10:52] another level that no one else can yeah
[10:55] very good and that's the life of it
[10:57] that's the faith the faith is love one
[11:00] one actually engenders the other because
[11:03] it was while you were
[11:04] unlovable that he died for you it's the
[11:08] understanding of the love of God that
[11:10] actually allows Faith to be exercised in
[11:14] your life we love him because he first
[11:17] loved us he would rather us love one
[11:20] another right that's the fullest
[11:21] commandment well you can't give what you
[11:23] ain't
[11:24] got you can't right you this religion's
[11:28] full people who exercise
[11:32] Hollow
[11:34] etiquette they got just enough religion
[11:37] to make themselves
[11:38] miserable but when you really have been
[11:42] forgiven and you really know what it's
[11:44] like to be taken from
[11:46] nothing when he could love you despite
[11:50] what you were you don't have a stone to
[11:53] throw the only thing you want is others
[11:56] to experience the same love that you've
[11:58] experienced yes and that's the faith
[12:01] that we have is that if he could do it
[12:03] for us if by the price of Calvary by the
[12:06] finished work he could touch your life
[12:08] then that same sacrifice is the same way
[12:12] that he's still touching others
[12:22] amen 1 John 4: 16- 21
[12:30] and we have known and believ the love of
[12:32] God hath to us God is love and he that
[12:35] dwelleth in love dwelleth in God and God
[12:38] in him herein is our love made perfect
[12:41] that we may have boldness in the day of
[12:44] judgment because as he is so are we in
[12:47] this world there is no fear in love for
[12:51] perfect love casteth out fear because
[12:55] fear hath torment so one of the very
[12:57] things that we want to capture is is
[12:59] what stands in opposition to Faith fear
[13:03] so what is it that is it by that makes
[13:06] our faith perfect is love it is the
[13:09] method the way that God is going to cast
[13:11] out fear is love so the you can't have
[13:16] faith without
[13:18] love and I it's it's it's as we will
[13:22] Lord willing get in share some quotes um
[13:25] we'll go through just some of the way
[13:28] that God uses uh those things but you
[13:32] you can't separate them yes um if you
[13:36] look at the stature of a perfect man I
[13:38] believe that they have that you have
[13:40] faith on the bottom it's the very
[13:42] foundation and yet at the top is love
[13:45] well if love is the very thing that
[13:48] produces Faith then why is it at the Top
[13:51] If we're built up from the bottom right
[13:54] seems to be a paradox and and to me I
[13:58] just love that the scripture says he's
[14:01] the Alpha and Omega God is love right
[14:05] you he he's the very beginning of it all
[14:09] and he's the end of it all while we're
[14:11] finished in a Capstone of love love is
[14:14] the very it's still at the very bottom
[14:16] it's the foundation it's in faith your
[14:19] faith is rooted and grounded in the love
[14:21] of God for you and how do we know he
[14:23] loves us because his word said so amen
[14:27] so we're we're we are
[14:30] um we're we're we can't lose right he
[14:34] swore by himself because he couldn't
[14:36] swear by any other as we were reading in
[14:39] in Hebrews chapter 11 I I don't think I
[14:42] went past the first verse uh verse two
[14:45] for by it the elders obtained a good
[14:47] report through faith we understand that
[14:49] the worlds were framed by the word of
[14:52] God so that the things that were seen
[14:54] were not made of things which do appear
[14:57] by faith Abel offered offered unto God a
[14:59] more excellent sacrifice than Cain by
[15:02] which he obtained witness that he was
[15:04] righteous and God testifying of his
[15:07] gifts that by it he being dead yet
[15:11] speaketh and this is this is so uh
[15:14] beautiful to us because we understand
[15:16] the Revelation he got and what he
[15:18] understood was that there was a blood
[15:21] requirement that it the the original sin
[15:24] and and the requirement that there was a
[15:26] a lamb slain that when they left the
[15:28] garden there was the they were clothed
[15:30] and it was beating you know their legs
[15:32] as they left there was an atonement that
[15:34] was spoken by the lamb that was slain
[15:37] and Abel by Revelation offers up that
[15:41] sacrifice and then what's in opposition
[15:43] to that is religion right so if you look
[15:47] just in the scale of things in man's
[15:49] carnality the bride of Christ is
[15:51] gathered together in a small building
[15:53] here in Phoenix
[15:54] today while there's great Majesty in
[15:59] religious Grandeur going on around the
[16:00] world yeah and it's no different than
[16:04] Cain taking the the labor the fruit of
[16:07] his works and the labors and how
[16:08] beautiful it was it by all aesthetic
[16:11] means was the
[16:13] more
[16:15] grandioso it was probably more moving it
[16:18] would have been something that you would
[16:19] have been more likely an apt after your
[16:21] own flesh to be around
[16:23] because death is
[16:26] ugly right I you know it just is is ugly
[16:29] and society and everything that it's
[16:32] built to do is Shield our understanding
[16:35] that death is a reality of the Fall it
[16:39] does by Society by the by by Civics we
[16:44] do a really good job of most of you
[16:46] probably haven't had to encounter a dead
[16:48] body on the side of the road you go to
[16:51] some places you go to India different
[16:52] places they put them on the
[16:55] curb you know there's there's certain
[16:57] cultures and societies they don't have
[16:59] the means by that we have to really
[17:03] protect Society at large from the
[17:05] consequences and the results of sin
[17:07] right but here's
[17:10] death not a great scene testifying that
[17:13] a price has to be paid yeah there's
[17:16] always a
[17:18] reproach to the gospel and as soon as
[17:21] you try to take the reproach out of
[17:25] it you're you're you're you're uh you're
[17:28] you're losing it right you you've
[17:30] already lost because if there was not a
[17:33] reproach in it then Jesus Christ would
[17:34] have come in glory he would have come in
[17:37] a way that but from the very time that
[17:39] he is born he's born in a
[17:41] manger right and it was because he was
[17:44] going to be able to be approached by
[17:47] Shepherds that he came in a way that all
[17:50] all could F could come unto him there
[17:54] there is no no matter how you esteem
[17:57] yourself how low that you think you are
[18:00] he came in such an
[18:02] estate that you can come unto
[18:06] him there's not a there that's the one
[18:09] person you don't have to be embarrassed
[18:11] to go
[18:13] before he held it he he would he
[18:15] despised the
[18:17] shame he bore your
[18:21] sin if we could catch the love that he
[18:25] displayed on
[18:26] Calvary and the
[18:30] The
[18:31] Obedience that he had through the things
[18:36] which he
[18:37] suffered to fully understand the love of
[18:39] God it would start to build a
[18:42] confidence in who you are because you're
[18:46] who he sought and who he died
[18:49] for and in this day we have received a
[18:53] restored word in that truth um you know
[18:59] we could we could spend some time and
[19:01] and talk about you know really what's
[19:04] being restored we know that there was
[19:06] four death messenger for Life Messengers
[19:09] and uh we could go into really how he's
[19:11] rebuilding back in the restoration of
[19:14] faith and what we've received in this
[19:16] day is a perfect word to to provide a
[19:19] perfect Faith because we want to get
[19:22] into uh some of the substance of uh you
[19:26] know I think we'll do fine on time we
[19:29] will try not to keep you too long I
[19:30] think we're doing all right and the
[19:32] restoration of the Bride tree paragraph
[19:34] 504 he says listen real close look there
[19:37] was four death Messengers killed that
[19:39] tree that's right that was it the
[19:41] palmerworm Locust cankerworm caterpillar
[19:44] is that right four Messengers get it
[19:47] amen four God said I will restore he's
[19:51] going to restore it how by four death
[19:53] Messengers killed it then four life
[19:55] Messengers will restore it what was the
[19:58] first Martin Luther justification what
[20:00] was the second John Wesley by
[20:03] sanctification what was the third
[20:05] Pentecost right so we're not just coming
[20:07] to Pentecost and then we're restored
[20:10] there was a restoration of the gifts
[20:12] there was the outpouring there was
[20:14] something that took place and there's a
[20:17] parallel that I find with coming that
[20:20] far um in the Book of Romans and and
[20:23] we'll we'll we'll look at it but but
[20:26] where are we at right amen that's what
[20:29] we want to catch because then if we are
[20:31] recognizing our day in our message then
[20:33] our faith can rise up because there's
[20:35] something that's being accomplished he's
[20:37] going to restore it how by four death
[20:39] Messengers killed it John Wesley third
[20:43] Pentecost restoration of the gifts the
[20:45] Holy Ghost baptism the Holy Ghost what
[20:48] was the fourth the word the word there
[20:51] were four prophets one of them Martin
[20:53] Luther we know he goes in different
[20:55] places calls them reformers but Martin
[20:57] Luther he began to to shine a light
[21:00] there was a little light just a very
[21:02] small strength of justification along
[21:04] the way Wesley stronger sanctification
[21:06] after Wesley the stronger Pentecost the
[21:09] baptism of the Holy Ghost and another
[21:11] great prophet see but in the last days
[21:14] Malachi for Elisha is to come with the
[21:16] very word the word of the Lord came to
[21:19] the prophet in the evening light is to
[21:21] come forth to restore bring back what
[21:24] turn the hearts of the children back to
[21:26] the faith of God forth
[21:29] now let there be light God's word can't
[21:33] fail this was a promise it's the light
[21:36] of God producing just like the light
[21:39] Shone brewed out over the Earth and and
[21:41] brought forth a life the light of God in
[21:43] this C can't help but perform but to
[21:46] bring forth the Life of Christ in a
[21:48] bride yes and we're resting in that
[21:52] right we've received an end time message
[21:54] to call forth and to Quicken a bride how
[21:56] do we know the message has come yes how
[21:59] do I know it's for me I had an ear to
[22:02] hear I had an eye to see how it wasn't
[22:04] of me I didn't it wasn't my mental
[22:06] acuity but he placed something in me to
[22:08] believe with
[22:10] yes and it's a gift of God and it's
[22:13] enough and it's pleasing to him
[22:16] yes and and if we catch that we don't we
[22:20] we're not built on Penance right you
[22:22] know one of the tricks of the devil is
[22:23] to think that you have some Merit that
[22:25] you have another place to rest anything
[22:28] that you rest in besides the finished
[22:30] work is is really resting in a in the
[22:34] creation rather than the Creator you're
[22:36] somehow lifting up uh whether it's the
[22:39] gift whether it's you know uh you know
[22:42] because gifts want to steer your resting
[22:44] place back to the word of God it's not
[22:46] that the gift isn't genuine it isn't
[22:48] that it's not of God but man is always
[22:51] being blinded and lifting up a gift and
[22:55] never getting to the gift-giver right so
[22:58] if you ever put the emphasis on anything
[23:00] else but what God intended it to be on
[23:04] you it's just misplaced but that's been
[23:07] that way from the very beginning he said
[23:08] they're without excuse because the
[23:11] things of God are so clearly made
[23:12] manifest in the things around us nature
[23:15] declares God all around us so what has
[23:18] man done he he's caught the inspiration
[23:21] that God has reflected in nature and
[23:23] they started to worship the creation
[23:25] rather than God right but but that is
[23:29] just enough to convict
[23:32] them that there was something that
[23:34] should have drove them
[23:36] further it's it's not a way of Salvation
[23:39] it just says they're without
[23:41] excuse right so the thirst to say just
[23:44] as job had said I'm looking at
[23:48] nature what of
[23:51] man the the flower dies it goes into the
[23:54] ground it comes back again but while I'm
[23:57] on Earth I have Fellowship ship with God
[23:59] through the sacrifice of bulls you know
[24:01] I I have a way of communing with God but
[24:04] what is the thing what he feared was
[24:06] that something could separate him from
[24:08] God and it it was death yeah what
[24:11] happens when man dies right what is
[24:15] going to become of him so nature itself
[24:18] should be enough to convict
[24:22] somebody and I believe if you you know
[24:24] we know that if you meet God on the same
[24:29] basis that someone else has met him he's
[24:31] obligated to act the same right so
[24:34] here's job now carrying forth a
[24:38] revelation that has come from the garden
[24:40] that there's a blood atonement that's
[24:42] needed but there's still the question of
[24:45] what a man when he dies and he's in
[24:48] travail and he's in desperation and that
[24:51] which he feared Came Upon him right and
[24:54] the Revelation that he comes away with
[24:56] and what would ass seem be meant for
[24:59] evil the devil coming and and sifting
[25:01] his life and all the trials and all the
[25:03] travail a Believer through travail is
[25:07] going to come to a
[25:08] revelation that nothing can separate me
[25:11] from God there's not another result
[25:14] there's not another end to the trial of
[25:16] a Believer then that you nothing can
[25:19] separate Me me from God the love of God
[25:22] wins it's
[25:24] Victorious you can you can take it right
[25:26] back to the devil and say I know my
[25:29] redeemer liveth I know that this word of
[25:32] God has could perform a work in my life
[25:35] and that the trying of my faith is more
[25:36] perfect than gold yeah and in the storm
[25:40] when you're testifying to it it's just
[25:41] putting it right back in the face of the
[25:43] devil right and that's pleasing to God
[25:46] when you stand by faith and you say I
[25:48] have no other reason to believe it but
[25:50] besides God's word he said so that
[25:53] pleases
[25:55] God and it bruises the devil
[25:59] it bruises them and um you know
[26:04] I if you can go back and listen to
[26:06] perfect faith I you know I haven't been
[26:08] reading the quotes but brother brandom
[26:11] in there has just come to me close to
[26:16] uh he says I get spells too you know I
[26:20] get moody I get to the spot where what's
[26:24] it gets me it gets those spells when I
[26:26] get all overworked and Satan comes
[26:28] telling me why nobody cares for you you
[26:32] really haven't got a friend in the world
[26:34] and what so remember I'm not immune to
[26:38] Temptation now that's something that he
[26:40] would equate a
[26:42] mood getting in the moly grubs to a
[26:45] Temptation we often think a temptation
[26:48] of oh you know go steal a cookie from
[26:51] the cookie jar right um I'm going to
[26:54] stay up late I don't know you know what
[26:56] I'm going to play my video games even
[26:58] though I got told to go to bed and we go
[27:00] get the phone I don't know but
[27:01] temptation's usually you know thought of
[27:04] as some
[27:05] Indulgence right right something that's
[27:08] going to satiate or be fun you know
[27:11] that's Temptation usually in our
[27:13] thinking but this isn't Pleasant I'm
[27:16] getting Moody I'm getting depressed I'm
[27:18] getting this is not fun but what is it
[27:21] doing it's giving glory to something
[27:23] that is contrary to the
[27:25] word right so he you have to resist that
[27:29] Temptation and I love this
[27:32] secret amen this is some
[27:35] insightful this is a a a soldier who
[27:39] knows how to do battle he's going to
[27:40] tell you how he does battle when he's
[27:43] faced with this
[27:46] situation and he says you know it
[27:48] happens to him when he's all overworked
[27:50] then when I look back and see something
[27:53] like this I put it right back in his
[27:56] face now he's coming off a testimony
[27:58] that's been shared about a healing and
[28:01] how the Lord's used them or something
[28:03] that God's done so what you David
[28:05] encouraged his heart in the Lord so what
[28:08] you do anytime that Satan comes to you
[28:11] and gets you feeling moody maybe it's
[28:12] about your past you know it it greater
[28:15] than all my sin no matter how great you
[28:18] make the problem it just makes my God
[28:20] greater no ma no whatever you're piling
[28:23] on you just lifted up my God because
[28:25] he's greater if I'm that bad than how
[28:28] much love he really loved me yeah if if
[28:31] my sin got so much bigger how much
[28:33] greater the price that Calvary paid
[28:36] right if it's if it whatever it is
[28:38] you've got to now turn that temptation
[28:41] to side with the mood to side with the
[28:43] moly grub and to turn it around and put
[28:46] it back in the face of the devil that
[28:48] helps me overcome what is it like a
[28:50] certain friend of mine setting in the
[28:52] meeting there was a clan a clan doesn't
[28:54] believe in Divine Healing young fellow
[28:56] recently and says nothing's to it and he
[28:59] goes through and he testifies but turn
[29:01] around and put that back in the devil's
[29:03] face whatever he's doing you just smash
[29:06] it right back in his
[29:08] face yeah amen and the Lord knows he'll
[29:11] Quicken it to you but there should be a
[29:13] word of God a a joy that could come and
[29:16] restore the joy of your
[29:18] salvation through the work that Christ
[29:20] has done in your life and if that hasn't
[29:23] become real to you there's an experience
[29:26] that can be had there's a a gift of the
[29:28] Holy Ghost there is a baptism of the
[29:31] Lord Jesus Christ that could come and
[29:33] make all things new that is our promise
[29:36] we have a simple gospel those who come
[29:39] to God must believe that he is right and
[29:42] that he is a rewarder that diligently
[29:44] seek Him and we've received a word
[29:46] that's not going to fail right amen
[29:49] we're we're living in a provided Place
[29:52] uh that God's provided in this day where
[29:54] where these things are still the new
[29:56] birth is still for our children
[29:58] there's a baptism baptism of the Holy
[30:01] Ghost for every generation you know you
[30:04] you can't preach the whole gospel
[30:06] without preaching that right you can't I
[30:10] know we live in the day of the the power
[30:12] of the spoken word and there's things
[30:14] that are transpiring in a realm unseen
[30:16] by the word of God but there still are
[30:18] hands that have to be
[30:20] extended the the prayer for the sick is
[30:23] not taken out of the Gospel I I could
[30:25] admonish you that yes you receiving the
[30:27] word and faith is enough but there's a
[30:29] portion of the scripture that's been
[30:31] given to help your faith that said that
[30:33] you have the Elders of the church pray
[30:35] with you annoint them with oil lay hands
[30:37] on the sick and they shall recover faith
[30:39] in that word is just as good as faith in
[30:42] any part of it right there was the
[30:45] doubting Thomas that required that his
[30:47] hand be put in his side but God is
[30:50] performing things in your life that are
[30:52] going to make Faith
[30:55] effectual right and it's going to be
[30:57] after those things happen then you are
[30:59] commissioned now you you have a faith
[31:02] something's been imparted to you you've
[31:04] seen the word of God performed in your
[31:06] life you're under obligation now to
[31:10] testify what God's made real to you
[31:14] right because that's the that is the
[31:16] economy of God from Faith to Faith
[31:22] amen just uh try to see where we're
[31:26] at amen
[31:35] now one of the beautiful things that
[31:37] that the Lord dealt with me on is that
[31:42] um how the love that we received that
[31:46] the Lord shown us
[31:49] is is pure just as love is
[31:54] pure and brother Brandon begins to go
[31:57] through it I I I I feel we could it's
[32:00] not I love reading the prophet so if I
[32:03] do some lengthy reading I I know that
[32:06] you'll you'll love it too because I I do
[32:08] feel we could say no man spake like this
[32:10] man uh we could find our own words to
[32:13] try to say it but you know this was the
[32:15] voice to our age that God used to impart
[32:18] faith it was a Malachi 4 voice so I I my
[32:23] faith is by reading the words of a
[32:25] prophet and speaking them they'll
[32:27] perform just like we read the word of
[32:28] God in the scripture this word is a is
[32:31] was the word for our day to deliver a
[32:34] faith and I'm excited to be able to have
[32:37] a message that we can listen to that we
[32:39] can go back that's been transcribed and
[32:42] we can absolutely catch it in the life
[32:44] and the anointing that it was meant to
[32:46] be in
[32:48] amen
[32:51] um perfect faith is the master of all
[32:55] circumstances perfect Faith Masters all
[32:57] C circumstance no matter what it is it
[33:00] Masters it now just watch when you
[33:02] believe in anything do anything and you
[33:04] got faith in what you're doing no matter
[33:07] what the circumstance is that don't have
[33:10] one thing to do with it see it Masters
[33:14] that
[33:15] circumstance so there's always something
[33:17] that has to be in opposition to Faith
[33:20] otherwise faith is not being it's not
[33:24] pleasing right so there's a there's a
[33:26] way that your faith is pleasing and
[33:28] that's because there has to be a
[33:30] circumstance there has to be something
[33:32] that is trying the faith amen but faith
[33:36] is the master of the
[33:38] circumstance and Faith In
[33:41] Love is relation because you can't have
[33:44] faith unless you got love that that is
[33:47] an incredible statement you can't have
[33:51] faith unless you got love we know that I
[33:55] if I have not charity I be I'm nothing
[33:59] right so we could go back and we can go
[34:02] through that the stature of the perfect
[34:04] man really captures that what what those
[34:07] what those virtues are of the spirit but
[34:09] without love you don't have anything
[34:11] there's
[34:13] nothing zero am as much as you can
[34:18] understand the message that you could be
[34:20] a theologian that you could have wisdom
[34:23] that you can have uh diligence in in a
[34:26] lot of things if you've lost the love of
[34:28] God you've actually lost the
[34:32] faith and that's
[34:34] incredible you know we know what the
[34:36] charge was they lost their first love
[34:39] you know the love and faith are not you
[34:42] can't separate them because we don't
[34:46] have a head faith we have a heart Faith
[34:49] the Gentiles did things by the spirit
[34:52] with the word of God written on our
[34:53] heart that the Jews couldn't do by
[34:55] fulfilling the law they Marvel when they
[34:58] saw that here's Gentiles doing by Nature
[35:01] the things written in the
[35:03] law that they
[35:05] exercised that they tried to make
[35:08] themselves perfect in they were
[35:10] genuinely trying to reflect a holy God
[35:14] by the exercising of Law and now here's
[35:16] the Infidel the people who didn't they
[35:19] weren't schooled doing by Nature the
[35:22] things that were reflecting the very
[35:24] life of God because they had had a
[35:28] love had come into their
[35:30] life God had revealed himself to them
[35:34] and if that love is not effectual in our
[35:37] life then what good's the salt for what
[35:40] good is what was it what you know the
[35:42] very things that were believing in and
[35:44] professing to believe if the love of God
[35:46] is not shed forth in our life then it's
[35:48] become of none effect your faith is is
[35:51] is without works the greatest work is to
[35:55] love Faith and love works together here
[35:59] just like a young couple you take a
[36:01] young man a young woman and they love
[36:03] they fall in love with one another and
[36:05] as they go along and begin to know one
[36:07] another their hearts just begin to beat
[36:09] as
[36:10] one amen you know this is the mystery of
[36:13] Christ in the church There's A Love
[36:15] Affair that's going on that we're we're
[36:17] being made into His Image we're bone of
[36:19] his
[36:21] bone
[36:23] amen see they're not husband and wife
[36:27] but they love binds them together and
[36:29] they have confidence in one another now
[36:31] if they really love another really love
[36:34] and you know that this girl loves you
[36:36] and she knows that you love her You've
[36:39] Got Confidence faith in one another if
[36:41] you got faith in one another if you
[36:43] didn't you better not marry her
[36:49] y you know love cast out fear you know
[36:53] that was one of the first questions I
[36:54] had you know as a as a young man having
[36:57] had had experience with the Lord as I
[36:59] got older you know what's love now I
[37:03] know I'd experienced it when I had met
[37:06] the Lord I knew that was real yeah I
[37:09] knew that was love but now I've got all
[37:11] these things that are testifying
[37:14] to that's not a fruit that I know
[37:18] jealousy yeah you know uh lack of peace
[37:23] a lack of
[37:26] confidence but but that's supposed to be
[37:29] love it's tainted right we understand
[37:32] Satan can't create he's a perverter and
[37:35] you know we understand Agape we
[37:37] understand Philly we understand it it
[37:38] just funnels all down and at the at the
[37:40] very bottom you have
[37:43] murder
[37:45] right I mean it it's true you got people
[37:49] who will kill a man out of jealousy and
[37:52] they'll call it love brother Bram said
[37:53] that's not it that's not it but
[37:58] it's their
[38:00] faith it's their
[38:02] love and they put it in the wrong thing
[38:06] notice you got to have faith and you
[38:09] separate them and put one extreme South
[38:11] and one extreme North and they'll and
[38:13] there still that love beats for one
[38:16] another no matter what they're at where
[38:19] they're at and you know that's the other
[38:20] thing love does I mean this is speaking
[38:22] of a separation that love persists but
[38:24] love separates right for this cause a
[38:26] man will father and mother and cleave to
[38:29] his wife right love also causes a
[38:33] separation it it did so in the Life of
[38:36] Christ and it will do so in your life if
[38:39] you love the Lord it will cause a
[38:41] separation it causes a separation from
[38:43] unbelief it causes a separation from the
[38:46] things that you know are not pleasing to
[38:48] him right we we do things by
[38:51] love not by law and there's enough to
[38:55] fall in love with he's the a lovely one
[38:58] he's the lily of the valley there's none
[39:00] like him the works of his hands I mean
[39:03] you look around you see the lives that
[39:05] he's touched the things that could have
[39:07] been ruined that the devil sought to
[39:09] destroy and there's people sitting in
[39:11] here tonight praising the Lord that
[39:15] they've been freed from bondage yes we
[39:18] love the Lord in the works of his hands
[39:20] there's none like them there should be a
[39:23] praise that's emanating from the bride
[39:25] of Christ you know there's no one can
[39:27] worship him like you can he doesn't want
[39:28] to hear someone else's love song he
[39:31] doesn't want to hear a nominal
[39:32] believer's
[39:35] praise it's not acceptable
[39:37] worship they don't even know who he is
[39:40] in vain they do worship
[39:42] me and I know that's tough to say but I
[39:45] don't mean to tear them down what I'm
[39:47] wanted you to understand is how precious
[39:49] you
[39:50] are you know that's the that's the other
[39:52] trick if the devil can make you think
[39:55] that uh you're not called out and you're
[39:57] not separate he tries to make you think
[40:00] you're like everybody else he's a he's a
[40:01] he's a ly balum y we are called out we
[40:05] are separate we are the elect We There
[40:08] is a we do things out of love that maybe
[40:10] others don't feel compelled to do right
[40:14] I I'm not condemning you for that but my
[40:16] love's greater my love's higher my love
[40:18] calls for a separation my love calls for
[40:21] a higher praise yes it that love beats
[40:26] it causes an effect
[40:28] it's not passive
[40:31] yes and if you love the Lord just not
[40:34] trying to dodge hell but you love the
[40:37] Lord then you have faith in God see if
[40:40] you love him like a young girl just
[40:43] happened here in lville not long ago a
[40:45] woman she was she fell in love with this
[40:47] man he had been a Christian a couple
[40:49] years or so got married I love the story
[40:51] I some of you know where I'm going but
[40:53] this story still means a lot to me
[40:56] because it shows a love that's that is
[40:59] pure right they loved and had confidence
[41:02] in one another and they got married and
[41:03] so the woman said to the man hubby it's
[41:06] been hard on you you're just a young
[41:08] Christian you've had so much to go
[41:10] through with drinking and all that she
[41:12] said you've had so much to go through
[41:14] and I know you're bound to be tempted
[41:17] awfully hard and said I want you to know
[41:19] one thing now if you happen to fall if
[41:22] you happen to fall into temptation and
[41:24] and is overcome don't stay away from
[41:26] home you come on back you come right
[41:29] here CU I'm going to be right here
[41:31] waiting for you I'm going to help him
[41:33] pray you through again until you get
[41:35] Victory we believe in Victory I'm going
[41:38] to stay with you because when I married
[41:41] you I married you because I loved you
[41:43] and no matter what you are I still love
[41:45] you few days after that he was eating
[41:48] his lunch with the fellows down in the
[41:50] boiler room he was telling them about it
[41:53] he said now how could a man ever do
[41:55] anything wrong when somebody loves you
[41:57] like
[41:58] that you know the the fear of
[42:00] displeasing the Lord became really
[42:02] worlded me I didn't want to do anything
[42:05] that would cause his presence to leave
[42:07] it's the greatest thing I've ever known
[42:10] and yet he promised to never leave me
[42:13] never forsake me and though I may not
[42:16] feel that he's there he's given me a
[42:17] word that he
[42:19] is right we do things we ought not to do
[42:22] because we don't recognize his
[42:24] presence he's there he's present
[42:28] he's never left
[42:29] you and how could a man ever do anything
[42:32] wrong when somebody loves you like that
[42:34] see there you are How Could You trespass
[42:37] that confidence and when we were Sinners
[42:40] alienated without God in the world in
[42:43] the muck in the mud and I talked this
[42:45] morning God come to us God sought you
[42:49] never you never sought God no man come
[42:52] to me except the father draws him and
[42:54] God come down in that muck what you were
[42:57] and sought you out and brought you out
[43:00] that ought to create a perfect love look
[43:03] what you was and look what you are what
[43:06] did that somebody that loves you can't
[43:10] you have faith in what he's promised
[43:14] you real genuine love will create a
[43:17] confidence in his
[43:20] word he caught me when I was nothing I'm
[43:23] still nothing but I'm in his hand see he
[43:27] caught
[43:30] me amen we can know this God real in our
[43:36] lives but he doesn't want you to put
[43:39] confidence still in anything other than
[43:41] his word without faith it's impossible
[43:45] to please God If he if he wanted it
[43:48] other if you and I say that cuz you
[43:51] could try to rest in the
[43:53] emotion
[43:55] don't don't
[43:57] one of the mo earliest experiences I had
[43:59] as a Believer was God teaching me that
[44:01] if you go by sensation and you go by
[44:04] emotion it'll take you anywhere if it's
[44:06] contrary to the word you don't believe
[44:09] it um listen now now think of this this
[44:13] is in that message brother brandham says
[44:17] this he
[44:20] says if any vision is contrary to the
[44:24] word leave it alone it Thank
[44:28] God now think of a prophet of God who
[44:32] God has come to many times and showed
[44:35] him thus saith the Lord through a vision
[44:38] it is it was just as good as
[44:40] finished when he seen the vision he just
[44:43] had to sit there and watch the vision
[44:45] play out and he could have a faith and a
[44:47] confidence that it was the will of God
[44:50] right but supercharged Faith we've been
[44:55] you know think of Thomas now and what he
[44:58] was he said blessed are they who
[45:01] believed right because they've received
[45:04] the word you have the opportunity to be
[45:07] pleasing to God by taking a man's word
[45:09] you may never see a vision yeah but a
[45:12] vision contrary to the word is still not
[45:15] the a place to rest the best place you
[45:18] can rest is in the word of God Amen
[45:20] there is no other place to rest besides
[45:22] the word of God so if you've received a
[45:25] perfect word
[45:27] then it's delivered a perfect Faith how
[45:29] do I know because a Vindicated Prophet
[45:33] came in our day and I've received the
[45:36] message I've received the end time word
[45:38] I believe it how he's given me the faith
[45:41] he's given me the ear to
[45:43] hear
[45:45] that's it now God will Quicken that in
[45:50] signs and wonders and miracles they're
[45:52] performed but if you ever put the
[45:54] confidence in those things you're
[45:55] putting the confidence in the creation
[45:58] more than the
[45:59] Creator and they'll pass away there's a
[46:02] time when healing ceases There's No more
[46:04] healing needed now the healer's still
[46:07] there the man who the god that had the
[46:11] attribute of healer is eternal yes and
[46:14] you can know him as healer you can know
[46:18] him as Savior and you can know him and
[46:21] all the things that he would desire to
[46:22] reveal to you I believe that's the
[46:24] promise we have
[46:28] I trust the Lord's been good to you
[46:30] we
[46:31] um want everybody to come to know the
[46:34] love of the
[46:35] Lord but even in all those
[46:38] things if you want to be pleasing to the
[46:41] Lord all you have to do is believe his
[46:45] word he's not he I I read it it struck
[46:50] me um Lord willing I could find it he
[46:53] says there's nothing else for us to do
[46:56] yeah right it's a finished
[46:59] work there's all we have to do is
[47:04] believe I
[47:07] mean Lord that's all I have to do and
[47:10] that's pleasing to you now I know
[47:14] without works I know those things I'm
[47:16] not I'm not saying there's not works
[47:18] that are manifested but it's out of a
[47:21] love and it's out of a
[47:24] faith that's in a a perfect word and
[47:28] that's pleasing to him because if you
[47:30] did
[47:31] works and it wasn't the right life
[47:34] behind it it wouldn't please them you've
[47:36] just put confidence in your Works
[47:39] doesn't please
[47:41] them you know none of us have works that
[47:44] are not being done better by someone
[47:47] else yeah right good I mean really and
[47:52] as soon as you are the best there's
[47:53] someone coming after you that's going to
[47:55] do it better very good so we're not but
[47:58] we are resting in a perfect work a
[48:00] perfect work that was finished at
[48:02] Calvary and a and and uh our part is to
[48:07] believe yes and that that's enough God
[48:11] bless you let's Stand Together
