[0:00] genesis chapter 15
[0:02] i want to read the entire chapter it's
[0:03] not a very long one but i want to read
[0:05] the entire one just to share
[0:09] um
[0:10] some very you know a couple very
[0:12] significant instances in abraham's life
[0:15] but there's a
[0:16] theme we know that these verses are
[0:18] really lifting up christ and pointing to
[0:21] um jesus christ in the
[0:24] uh in one portion
[0:26] and then also
[0:28] god even revealing to abraham some of
[0:31] the future of his seed and his
[0:32] generation
[0:33] generations after him so real important
[0:36] scriptures but i have a very specific
[0:37] thought i want to bring out of it
[0:39] genesis chapter 15 starting with verse
[0:42] one after these things and these things
[0:44] were the battle with the kings and the
[0:46] melchizedek coming to visit him
[0:48] the word of the lord came unto abram in
[0:50] a vision saying fear not abram i am thy
[0:53] shield and thy exceeding great reward
[0:56] and abram said lord god what will thou
[0:58] give me see and i go childless and the
[1:00] steward of my house is the eliezer
[1:03] is this eleazar of damascus
[1:06] and abram said behold to me the house
[1:08] given no seed and lo one born in my
[1:10] house is mine heir we recognize that
[1:13] abram is actually suggesting that a son
[1:15] born of his servant eliezer
[1:17] could he be the one that you spoke of
[1:19] could he be the one that the blessing
[1:21] pertains to but then the lord is going
[1:23] to reaffirm and promise abram an heir of
[1:26] his own and behold the word lord came
[1:28] unto him saying this shall not be thine
[1:31] heir but he that shall come forth out of
[1:33] thine own bowels shall be thine heir
[1:36] and he brought him forth abroad and said
[1:37] look now toward heaven
[1:39] and tell the stars if thou be able to
[1:41] number them and he said unto him so
[1:44] shall thy seed be
[1:46] and he believed in the lord and he
[1:48] counted it to him for righteousness and
[1:50] that a marvelous scripture that he just
[1:52] believed god and this was imputed
[1:55] to abram as righteousness
[1:57] and he said unto him i am the lord that
[2:00] brought thee out of ur of the counties
[2:02] to give thee this land to inherit it
[2:05] and again abram he said lord god whereby
[2:08] shall i know that i shall inherit it and
[2:11] he said in him take me a heifer of three
[2:13] years old and a she-goat to three years
[2:15] old and a ram of three years old and a
[2:17] turtle dove and a young pigeon and he
[2:19] took unto him all these and divided them
[2:22] in the midst so there had been a
[2:23] cleaving a separating of the flesh and
[2:25] laid each piece one against another but
[2:28] the bird divided he not and when the
[2:30] fowls came down upon the carcasses abram
[2:33] drove them away
[2:34] when the sun was going down a deep sleep
[2:36] fell upon abram and loa and horror of
[2:39] great darkness fell upon him
[2:41] and he said unto abram no of assurity
[2:44] that thy seed shall be a stranger in a
[2:45] land that is not theirs and shall serve
[2:47] them and they shall afflict them four
[2:50] hundred years god already prophesying
[2:52] the bondage in egypt and also that
[2:54] nation whom they they shall serve will i
[2:57] judge and afterwards shall they come out
[2:59] with great substance so this is prophecy
[3:02] of them being in bondage in egypt for
[3:04] 400 years and then he speaks to him and
[3:06] thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace
[3:09] thou shalt be buried in a good old age
[3:12] but in the fourth generation they shall
[3:14] come hither again for the iniquity of
[3:15] the amorites is not yet full and it came
[3:18] to pass that when the sun went down and
[3:20] it was dark behold a smoking furnace and
[3:22] a burning lamp that passed between those
[3:24] pieces
[3:25] in the same day the lord made a covenant
[3:27] with abram saying unto thy seed have i
[3:30] given this land from the river of egypt
[3:33] under the great river the river
[3:34] euphrates the canaanites and the kinseth
[3:37] canazites and the catamites and the
[3:39] hittites and the perizzites and the
[3:41] rafeems and the amorites and the
[3:43] canaanites and the gergescites and the
[3:45] jebusites
[3:47] amen let's just say a quick prayer
[3:49] heavenly father we thank you for your
[3:51] presence that is with us today
[3:53] for the desire that we have to be in
[3:55] your house
[3:56] for the anticipation that we have for
[3:57] your word
[3:59] and we ask that you would come now bless
[4:01] the words which we have read and speak
[4:03] plainly to our hearts that we might be
[4:05] benefited by your scripture
[4:07] as you give us revelation bless your
[4:09] people now we pray in jesus name amen
[4:12] you can be seated
[4:15] we've been
[4:15] taking this subject on supreme faith
[4:18] revealed in abraham
[4:20] our our goal has been to
[4:24] look at abraham's life
[4:26] and emphasize points that relate to our
[4:28] faith or would allow us to relate to our
[4:30] own faith our own calling
[4:32] our own election and then begin to
[4:35] recognize as we relate to abraham's
[4:37] faith
[4:38] through our own faith and then kind of
[4:40] see the process whereby god wants to
[4:42] perfect our faith
[4:44] and
[4:45] i feel that i'm nearing the end of this
[4:47] series and maybe just have one more
[4:48] service on it that i would say for sure
[4:51] that's on my heart i just thought as i
[4:54] prepared yesterday just to kind of go
[4:56] back in my own mind over the services
[4:57] that we had spoke on
[4:59] this subject already and we've had 14
[5:02] parts on it today the 15th part and in
[5:05] the first three parts we were looking at
[5:07] how abraham is an example of our faith
[5:10] as brother branham said he was
[5:11] determined to be an example for people
[5:14] of today so there's a an example that
[5:17] abraham gives in his life
[5:19] that is indicative of or exemplifies the
[5:22] faith of god's elect and that we can
[5:24] draw from him an example for ourselves
[5:27] and for the next few parts um we begin
[5:30] to look at how the bride's rapturing
[5:32] faith is
[5:34] expressed in abraham's supreme faith so
[5:36] abraham offering up isaac as a sacrifice
[5:39] was rooted in this revelation that death
[5:42] could not defeat god's promises and so
[5:44] abraham
[5:45] being delivered from the fear of death
[5:47] was able to to take isaac and offer him
[5:50] up as a sacrifice and so we spent a a
[5:54] few services on that particular subject
[5:56] just tying in supreme faith of abraham
[5:59] with the
[6:01] with the bride's faith rapturing faith
[6:03] and then for the last several parts we
[6:05] have been looking at how maybe in
[6:07] different ways trying to identify the
[6:09] events and circumstances in abraham's
[6:11] life maybe types in his life
[6:14] and how it is relatable to us just even
[6:17] looking at how god called him out of
[6:18] babylon and how we too are called out of
[6:20] a spiritual babylon looking at how
[6:23] that god
[6:24] sent adam and the woman away from eden
[6:27] but god was actually doing something to
[6:29] call man back to eden in the path and
[6:32] the life of abraham even to the point to
[6:34] where as abram found himself between two
[6:37] edens and there was an eden that had
[6:40] been forsaken but there's going to be an
[6:42] eden to come and eternal eden abraham
[6:45] finding himself between two edens kind
[6:47] of became this
[6:48] uh critical turning point to where we
[6:50] begin to look forward to the new
[6:51] jerusalem and then melchizedek in
[6:54] genesis 14 comes down and serves them
[6:55] commune right on the very spot where the
[6:58] new jerusalem is going to descend out of
[7:00] heaven from god so a lot of different
[7:01] things we begin to look at and that and
[7:04] that the life of abraham and different
[7:06] circumstances that would make his faith
[7:07] relatable and then even looking at how
[7:10] that god separated him from lot and then
[7:12] separating him from lot there's a type
[7:14] that shows us separation from unbelief
[7:17] and separation from religion and
[7:19] formality and different things that
[7:20] hinder our faith
[7:22] and then we've uh and kind of over those
[7:25] few services we've been looking at how
[7:27] there's things in genesis chapter 1 2 3
[7:29] and 4
[7:31] that connects so deeply to the life of
[7:34] abraham in a lot of ways abraham's life
[7:36] is just picking up where things were cut
[7:38] off in genesis chapter 3 and picking up
[7:41] on things that took place in genesis
[7:42] chapter 4. so for us there's a
[7:44] tremendous
[7:46] revelation about abraham's life that's
[7:48] hid in those first
[7:50] several chapters of the bible and so
[7:52] those are just that's just me kind of
[7:54] resetting
[7:56] what we've gone over through those first
[7:58] several parts
[8:00] and uh and you're thinking it took you
[8:02] 14 parts to do it and you did it fairly
[8:04] well just there in the last four minutes
[8:06] so um it just goes to show how much can
[8:09] be contained in just those few things
[8:12] but with that as a foundation i do want
[8:15] to
[8:17] look at abraham's story as a whole again
[8:20] and
[8:22] and say this at the outset and and so
[8:24] this is if you if you take notes you
[8:26] could write this down and this will tell
[8:28] tell you my my this is my thesis and
[8:30] this will express what i wanted to share
[8:32] with you this morning
[8:34] as we look at the story of abraham and
[8:36] we look into his life and we read the
[8:37] instances that have taken place in his
[8:39] life and i've just been going back
[8:40] through and reading through the story
[8:41] it's not very long but you just can sit
[8:43] down and read through all of it very
[8:45] quickly and i've just been doing that on
[8:48] a regular basis
[8:49] looking at a story and what i want to
[8:52] say today is that the story of abraham
[8:55] reveals more about the character of god
[8:57] than it does about abraham
[9:00] and that's the part i really want you to
[9:01] ponder today is that the story when we
[9:03] read about abraham's life yeah we're
[9:05] learning some details about his life but
[9:07] he lived to a good old age 175 years old
[9:10] i believe he lived too
[9:12] and um and much of it's not recorded
[9:14] we have it recorded from i think around
[9:16] 75 years old to maybe some instances
[9:18] around when he was 130 something years
[9:20] old so there's a lot about abraham's
[9:22] life that we're not told about there's a
[9:24] lot of things he did a lot of things
[9:26] that he accomplished and we when we read
[9:29] about his story it reveals more to us
[9:31] about god's character than it does about
[9:33] abraham's character
[9:35] and that's important just to kind of
[9:37] pick on this a little bit and i think
[9:38] that i'm not suggesting that any of you
[9:40] are finding yourselves wrestling in this
[9:42] particular area and i certainly wouldn't
[9:44] suggest that what i just said is some
[9:46] tremendous revelation
[9:48] but i think we need to be reminded of it
[9:50] because abraham's personality um
[9:53] abraham's experiences that he went to
[9:55] his character
[9:56] his particular pathway in life his
[9:58] trajectory the things that he went
[10:00] through his exact circumstances all
[10:02] those things
[10:04] are not the basis of our faith because
[10:06] remember we call abraham the father of
[10:07] our faith we see many details of his
[10:09] life expressed more details
[10:12] in his life than any other character in
[10:14] the bible
[10:15] to this point and so we want to be sure
[10:18] that when we see him as the father of
[10:20] our faith it's not that we're rooted in
[10:22] his own experiences or in what he went
[10:25] through but that our faith is resting on
[10:27] something else
[10:29] and it's in this particular area where
[10:32] oftentimes
[10:33] it's a temptation to make someone else's
[10:35] testimony
[10:37] our basis for believing something
[10:39] just what somebody else said and uh what
[10:42] somebody else has experienced and we
[10:43] make their testimony our basis for
[10:46] expecting and you think well isn't that
[10:47] what a testimony is for there's really a
[10:49] fine line between a testimony misleading
[10:53] you or weakening your faith in a
[10:55] testimony encouraging your faith
[10:58] people can share something express
[11:00] something and give their testimony but
[11:02] it's not just their testimony that
[11:04] becomes the basis of our believing
[11:06] a testimony is something that is
[11:08] evidenced per evidence provided by the
[11:11] existence of something so something
[11:13] exists and it testifies of it it's the
[11:15] evidence of something and so it means to
[11:18] witness or to record that's what a
[11:19] testimony is
[11:21] and brother brahm says and these
[11:22] testimonies are give and he's just
[11:24] referring to these testimonies he was
[11:26] sharing and i found that this statement
[11:28] was very enlightening how that we ought
[11:30] to take testimonies when someone shares
[11:31] an experience and someone tells you
[11:33] something that happened in their life
[11:35] then there's there's something we're
[11:36] looking for
[11:38] to to speak to our hearts to encourage
[11:40] our faith he says these testimonies are
[11:42] given in the light of the gospel that
[11:44] people who are sick and needy might
[11:46] receive help and blessings from the
[11:48] gospel
[11:49] so the testimonies were shared not to
[11:51] lift up brother branham not merely just
[11:52] to vindicate the gift that he had but
[11:55] he's sharing these testimonies in the
[11:58] light of the gospel so these things that
[11:59] are being expressed have some
[12:01] harmony and continuity with the gospel
[12:04] and then as they are being expressed
[12:06] and and or in the light of the gospel
[12:08] those who are needy and need help can
[12:10] receive the help and the blessings that
[12:12] they need from the gospel so the
[12:15] testimony is supporting and lifting up
[12:19] the gospel
[12:20] in the message of hidden life in christ
[12:26] brother branham makes this is a very
[12:27] very uh
[12:30] exceptional statement he says and many
[12:31] times we substitute
[12:33] so much instead of the word especially
[12:36] today we're substituting phenomenal so
[12:39] if there can be some sort of phenomena
[12:41] something phenomenal something
[12:43] flashy and exciting we'll just take that
[12:45] over the word we're substituting a lot
[12:48] of other things that shouldn't be
[12:50] after all church is for preaching the
[12:52] word
[12:54] then he says testimonies are fine
[12:56] acknowledging that testimonies are good
[12:59] and we appreciate testimonies and we
[13:01] ought to have one and we should have
[13:03] freedom and liberty to give them he says
[13:05] in different things that we do is
[13:07] wonderful but we must give the word the
[13:10] first place because it's for the sinner
[13:12] and for the people that have the holy
[13:14] spirit also and this could be expressed
[13:16] in this in this way that when you have a
[13:19] church service uh testimonies are
[13:21] wonderful but testimony shouldn't
[13:22] overrun the service and uh just uh and
[13:25] if church becomes more just people
[13:27] testifying he's saying well that's uh
[13:29] that's not what church is for church is
[13:31] for pre for the word of god church is
[13:34] for preaching the word because the word
[13:36] is for the sinner the word is for those
[13:37] who have the holy spirit also and so
[13:39] it's the word that has to have the
[13:41] preeminence
[13:42] and so i want you to even think about
[13:44] this as he highlights and emphasizes
[13:47] that the word ought to have the
[13:48] preeminence that's really at the end of
[13:50] the day what a testimony ought to point
[13:52] to
[13:53] is it ought to point to the word i if
[13:56] you just gave an example and you gave a
[13:58] scenario and said i was doing this and i
[13:59] was doing that and the lord spoke to me
[14:01] and i did this and that happened well
[14:03] that's your experience and could very
[14:05] very unique and it could very well in
[14:07] fact be god but i'm only going to learn
[14:10] what your experience was and understand
[14:12] your history and what you've been
[14:13] through and not receive a benefit unless
[14:16] that testimony somehow can point back to
[14:20] something in the word of god and give me
[14:22] a basis to believe the same thing for
[14:25] myself
[14:26] because there's things that happen be
[14:27] like my god did that for you and that
[14:29] happened and you walk away going well i
[14:31] must not have any faith or god must not
[14:33] be in my life and or you might think
[14:36] well i don't think that happened we
[14:37] should resist the urge to say i don't
[14:39] think that really happened that's
[14:41] between them and the lord
[14:42] uh but if it's ant if it's contrary to
[14:44] scripture even brother bran was in a
[14:47] scenario says um you're a woman preacher
[14:49] and i think she said that she felt
[14:51] caught god called her to preach he's
[14:52] saying i'm not saying he didn't
[14:55] he said but it's not according to his
[14:56] word and so there's a difference maybe
[14:59] in recognizing even in that particular
[15:01] situation but we have to realize that if
[15:03] we can't bring it back to the word maybe
[15:05] we don't understand whether or not it
[15:07] really happened maybe we can't uh figure
[15:09] out whether or not that's god but that's
[15:11] for that person but it speaks to this
[15:13] point testimonies ought to be lifting up
[15:16] the character nature of god and pointing
[15:19] to something in the word so that others
[15:21] hearing it can be benefited by it and
[15:23] receive a blessing of it
[15:25] and so the testimony of abraham
[15:28] reveals to us the character of god
[15:31] the life story of abraham is not just a
[15:33] story of a great man or a man who wasn't
[15:36] great that became great it's not just
[15:38] history but abraham's testimony and his
[15:41] life and what is expressed through his
[15:42] circumstances and his events show us the
[15:45] attributes of god they're opening up to
[15:47] us the nature and character of god
[15:49] through the word and we recognize it's
[15:51] through the word god dealing with him
[15:53] the word being given to abraham it being
[15:54] even memorialized in the scripture we're
[15:56] not just reading this to know abraham's
[15:58] life but god wants to use abraham's life
[16:01] to show us something about himself
[16:04] and so the growth
[16:06] from abram to abraham the transformation
[16:08] from abram uh a chaldean out of ur to
[16:12] abraham is inspiring
[16:14] it really is an inspiring story if we
[16:16] just look at abraham's life and we read
[16:18] about it and i i think even if we begin
[16:20] to ponder just how extraordinary the
[16:22] battle with the kings was and how he
[16:23] just takes trained servants and he goes
[16:25] and does battle and how fearless that
[16:27] would seem and his journeys and
[16:29] everything he went through he said it's
[16:30] very inspiring in it and it's a
[16:32] tremendous story with tension and
[16:34] different things to keep us engaged but
[16:36] what's what's greater than just that
[16:38] inspiration of what took place in
[16:40] abraham's life is the unfolding of god
[16:42] that's taking place in this
[16:44] and i i want to and i'm going to back up
[16:47] a little bit and and go over some things
[16:49] in the first 11 chapters of genesis just
[16:51] so you could kind of understand how i'm
[16:53] wanting to place this
[16:54] abraham's life because well let's just
[16:57] we know what we're doing we're bible
[16:58] believers we've read the bible from
[17:00] genesis to revelation we're message
[17:02] believers we hear the word of god we've
[17:04] been going to church all of our lives so
[17:06] we see the whole picture already but i
[17:08] want to zero in on what the picture
[17:10] would have been when abraham's life
[17:12] began
[17:13] because if you look at
[17:15] let's just ponder this for a moment what
[17:17] genesis chapter 1
[17:19] through genesis chapter 11 teaches us
[17:21] about the character of god that if all
[17:23] we had were the first 11 chapters of the
[17:26] bible what are some of the things that
[17:28] we could say with certainty about the
[17:31] lord about his about who he is i said
[17:33] well tell me about god tell me about his
[17:35] nature tell me about his character uh we
[17:38] could read and conclude that he's
[17:39] eternal
[17:40] because god
[17:42] is an eternal god and that from this
[17:44] this eternal god was also a creator and
[17:46] that he was creating and he and and even
[17:49] in the names that are used of god at the
[17:50] time we could say he was he this
[17:52] self-existing one who created and
[17:55] wrapped up these laws within creation
[17:58] and these uh these things and these
[17:59] elements that bound things together so
[18:01] he's eternal he's a creator and we could
[18:04] read and see that he's one that grants
[18:06] privileges because he says i'm gonna
[18:08] give this to man and you're gonna be
[18:09] able to do this and you're gonna be able
[18:10] to do that so he grants power and
[18:12] privileges to man we see him as a
[18:14] lawgiver because this is really what
[18:16] he's doing in the garden of eden is he's
[18:18] laying down the law this is what you
[18:20] should do this is what you must do this
[18:22] is what you can't do
[18:23] and this is all just really looking in
[18:25] the first couple chapters of genesis
[18:26] first few chapters we see that he's a
[18:28] law enforcer
[18:30] god said the day you eat that day you
[18:32] die sure enough what did god do he he
[18:34] did exactly what he said he was going to
[18:35] do
[18:36] he came down and was a man of his word
[18:38] he's very strict we can say he's very
[18:39] rigid man he really meant it when he
[18:41] said don't eat of the fruit of that tree
[18:43] so god is a a law giver he's a law
[18:45] enforcer
[18:46] and if we took and i wanted to maybe go
[18:48] over this very quickly
[18:50] if we look at everything
[18:52] that god did in those first 11 chapters
[18:54] we would say he's a man of justice a god
[18:57] of justice
[18:58] because the the instances that stand out
[19:00] the most god is punishing adam
[19:03] god is punishing cain
[19:05] uh in chapter six he's punishing the
[19:07] whole world
[19:09] and then after that he comes down and
[19:10] confuses the whole world so god is one
[19:13] that punishes adam he punishes cain he
[19:14] punishes the woman he punishes the
[19:16] serpent uh he he floods the whole earth
[19:18] and and
[19:20] kills everyone but eight people
[19:22] we're learning about the character of
[19:23] god right we're just looking at if all
[19:25] we had were the first 11 chapters of the
[19:27] bible this is what we would be drawing
[19:29] from and then the last chapter we would
[19:31] have god sees that man is getting
[19:33] together and is ambitious and they're
[19:35] building something and building a tower
[19:37] and building a city and he comes and
[19:38] confuses all humanity and disperses them
[19:41] in chaos over the whole earth
[19:43] and what we be what stood out to me as i
[19:46] begin to look at it this way is that we
[19:47] really see god
[19:49] in his response to unbelief
[19:52] what what brought god down uh
[19:55] not that he hadn't come down before but
[19:57] what brought the voice of god down in
[19:59] the garden in the cool the evening
[20:01] unbelief
[20:02] that the sin of the woman and adam it
[20:05] brings god down in in in garden in the
[20:08] garden it brings him down to address
[20:10] unbelief really the next instance that
[20:12] we see god is god talking to cain
[20:15] when his and when his sacrifice was not
[20:17] acceptable and so we see him addressing
[20:19] the unbelief in the garden out of the
[20:21] garden addressing cain and then we see
[20:23] him
[20:24] um uh talk uh talking even with noah and
[20:28] discussing things with noah as it
[20:29] relates to unbelief and then we see him
[20:31] in babylon dealing with sin and unbelief
[20:33] in babylon
[20:35] god in the first 11 chapters of the
[20:38] bible offers two conditional covenants
[20:40] one with adam one with noah
[20:43] and in this he establishes a
[20:45] relationship with adam he establishes a
[20:46] relationship with noah
[20:48] with certain obligations that were on
[20:50] noah and adam's part but also
[20:51] obligations on god's part
[20:53] but we see that really on god's part
[20:55] it's that if you breach this there's
[20:57] consequences
[20:59] and in genesis chapter 9 verses 9 to 11
[21:03] it says and i will establish my covenant
[21:05] with you this is with noah
[21:07] neither shall all flesh be cut off any
[21:09] more by the waters of the flood
[21:13] neither shall there be any more
[21:15] there anymore be a flood to destroy the
[21:17] earth
[21:19] so this is this is god's covenant and
[21:21] think about it
[21:23] what god is saying is not that i won't
[21:25] punish you again i'm just not going to
[21:27] use water to do it
[21:29] and could you imagine if he said but i
[21:30] will use fire
[21:32] right because that's going to be that's
[21:33] what he does next
[21:34] and this is what god's saying all right
[21:36] fine i won't flood the earth anymore
[21:39] and this is something that really struck
[21:40] me as i pondered this
[21:42] is then in genesis chapter 11
[21:46] they in the tower of babel
[21:48] what was it based upon
[21:50] it demonstrates that the people that are
[21:53] inhabiting the earth didn't trust god's
[21:55] covenant of genesis chapter 9. he said
[21:57] look i won't flood the earth anymore but
[21:59] they still need to build a tower
[22:01] they're wanting to get to higher
[22:02] elevation they're wanting to figure out
[22:04] a way hey if this happens again is there
[22:05] a way that we can construct something to
[22:07] where we can save a life and possessions
[22:10] in some sort of uh fortification that
[22:12] could withstand flood waters and it
[22:14] shows that mankind didn't trust this
[22:16] covenant and they didn't want to spread
[22:18] out and they built a tower and it's
[22:20] related directly to not believing god in
[22:23] genesis 9 when he says i won't flood the
[22:25] earth anymore
[22:27] think about the instances where we see
[22:29] god present with man talking to men we
[22:31] only see god when he's speaking to man
[22:34] and visiting with man and it's
[22:36] when we see god visiting with man and
[22:38] speaking with man it's usually with
[22:40] respect to judgment
[22:42] it's usually in relation to sin
[22:44] something has happened whether it be
[22:45] with adam in the garden cain outside of
[22:47] the garden he comes and knows oh this is
[22:49] beautiful no beautiful he's talking to
[22:51] noah but what does he say you're the
[22:52] only one i see with of righteousness in
[22:54] all the world mankind is totally and
[22:56] completely evil
[22:58] and so he's only
[23:00] if you think about the way that god
[23:02] speaks the voice of god seeking adam in
[23:04] the garden god dealing with cain after
[23:06] the wrong offering and after murder the
[23:08] wickedness of man in the days of noah um
[23:11] what we what we're beginning to see is
[23:13] that any time we hear from god it's
[23:15] because mankind has done something wrong
[23:19] we could perhaps look at maybe just a
[23:21] glimpse of god's grace in cain and maybe
[23:23] a glimpse of god's mercy and noah
[23:26] but the real thrust of god's visitation
[23:28] with man is i'm we had a covenant and
[23:31] you broke it so i'm here to enforce it
[23:34] i'm here i'm here to enforce my remedies
[23:36] under this contract and that's when we
[23:38] see god speaking to adam speaking to
[23:40] cain speaking to noah coming down in the
[23:42] tower of babel it's usually related to
[23:45] some sort of conflict with the na and
[23:47] the nature of man with the word of god
[23:50] and if all we had were the first 11
[23:52] chapters of the bible
[23:54] most of what we would have is god saying
[23:56] if you make a mistake i'm going to
[23:58] punish you if you don't do things right
[24:00] there's going to be a price to pay for
[24:02] and this is the covenant i've made with
[24:03] you and this is the these are the
[24:05] consequences if you don't keep it and so
[24:07] that would create a particular
[24:09] relationship with god uh and i don't
[24:11] mean to take too much liberty with this
[24:14] but really it's indicative of what the
[24:15] people did in the time at the time of
[24:17] the tower of babel is they're not
[24:19] trusting god completely
[24:23] but with abraham's life we have an
[24:25] opportunity to watch god's character
[24:27] unfold
[24:29] to that point the the nature and
[24:31] character of god would have only been
[24:32] told by oral tradition
[24:34] what we have even when we read the book
[24:36] of genesis it's written by moses these
[24:38] different books that are written much
[24:40] later and are able to bring in certain
[24:42] elements that would not even necessarily
[24:44] be known at the time but the anyone on
[24:47] earth at that time would have only known
[24:49] god really by oral tradition or by
[24:51] history
[24:52] and by virtue of it only be an oral
[24:54] tradition in history and
[24:56] there's uh
[24:58] you could just really focus with me
[24:59] today and i feel that you're paying
[25:01] attention and i appreciate that and i'm
[25:03] really going to need your help to make
[25:04] it through the service
[25:06] as i said before the harder you pull the
[25:08] faster i'll preach i know some people
[25:10] just woke up like really we're going to
[25:12] drag him through this but this i really
[25:15] hope you can focus and i because i feel
[25:17] that there's something very deep here
[25:18] that we need to connect with
[25:20] and catch
[25:21] that
[25:22] there would have been a story an oral
[25:24] history about god and god did this and
[25:26] the god of our fathers and the god of
[25:28] this person the god of that person there
[25:30] would have been rich things that were
[25:31] shared but you could see the failure of
[25:34] that in that polytheism and the worship
[25:36] of many gods begins there in babylon
[25:39] because the truth of god is getting
[25:40] watered down from one testimony
[25:42] anecdotal story experience from one
[25:44] person to the next to where the true
[25:46] nature of god is being lost
[25:49] and genesis chapter 11 verse 11. it
[25:51] tells us shem lived 500 years after the
[25:53] birth of one of his sons and you can see
[25:57] then that shem even if you track it
[25:59] and if it's many people commentators
[26:02] agree with this hashem would have
[26:03] outlived abraham
[26:05] living the number of years that he did
[26:08] and so shem being alive and i believe
[26:10] noah died just a few years before
[26:12] abraham was born so think about that
[26:14] noah would have been alive just prior to
[26:17] or before abraham being born and sham is
[26:20] alive one that was on the ark one that
[26:22] lived before the flood he's seen the
[26:24] hand of god he's seen the miracle he's
[26:27] seen these different experiences he's
[26:29] experienced these things and so as he
[26:31] lives hundreds of years after the flood
[26:33] he would have been able to share his own
[26:35] experience
[26:36] he would have been able to give his own
[26:37] understanding of certain events and he
[26:39] would have had a testimony
[26:41] but even in that testimony and i want
[26:43] you to partner this as men share the
[26:45] testimonies shem
[26:47] would have talked about the god who
[26:48] judged the entire earth the
[26:51] the testimony of god the nature and
[26:53] character of god
[26:54] would have still been shrouded in
[26:56] mystery
[26:58] again i want you to think of it this way
[27:00] what we know about him today we kind of
[27:02] have to say well let's just let's just
[27:04] think about what he what would have been
[27:05] known about him then
[27:08] the probing of man the thoughts of man
[27:10] man's search for meaning trying to make
[27:12] sense why are we all here why are these
[27:14] things taking place and uh and all the
[27:16] different things they'd be wrestling
[27:17] with we have the benefit of 6 000 years
[27:20] of man trying to answer the question why
[27:22] are we here what's this all about man
[27:23] search for meaning but at the time there
[27:25] would have been such a mystery of trying
[27:27] to figure out purpose and how did we get
[27:29] here and what caused this and what
[27:31] caused that and the testimony of god
[27:33] would be hidden behind so much mystery
[27:35] but then the details that would be
[27:37] expressed what would be the takeaway
[27:38] shem says yeah
[27:40] one day god called my dad to build an
[27:42] ark because he was going to kill
[27:43] everybody else on earth
[27:45] and that's your takeaway
[27:47] so there's this cloaking of god's nature
[27:49] and character behind judgment based upon
[27:51] the experience
[27:52] of mankind
[27:54] but in genesis chapter 15 verse 7
[27:58] this is god's testimony now kind of
[28:00] jumping in into the middle of this
[28:03] and this is what god says about
[28:05] abraham's life
[28:07] and he said unto him i am the lord that
[28:10] brought thee i want you to catch it i am
[28:12] the lord that he's he's actually giving
[28:14] some
[28:16] context for who he is
[28:18] and he's wanting to express something
[28:20] about what he has done so that he can be
[28:22] identified i am the lord that brought
[28:24] thee out of er of the chaldees to give
[28:27] thee this land to inherit
[28:30] if you could
[28:32] kind of hold this thought in your mind
[28:33] as we carry this forward i am the lord
[28:36] that brought thee out
[28:38] he's not saying i'm the god that told
[28:40] you to go or i'm the god that called you
[28:42] out but i am the god that led you out
[28:44] i'm the one that brought you forth which
[28:47] means to lead and to direct i am the one
[28:49] that took you so he says i am the lord
[28:52] that brought thee out god's the one
[28:54] that's doing it
[28:55] god didn't send him a letter and say hey
[28:57] i'm down here in kane and get here as
[28:58] fast as you can or god didn't just one
[29:00] day knock on his door and say hey get
[29:02] out of here and send them away but god
[29:04] is implying that he took abraham and he
[29:08] walked with him and led him out of er
[29:10] the chaldees
[29:12] and that phrase there ur of the chaldees
[29:14] we might think oh herb that's a city but
[29:16] though even the way that it's phrased is
[29:18] very unique i brought you out of er the
[29:20] chaldees it means the flame or the fire
[29:22] of chaldea
[29:24] i brought you out of the flame of
[29:26] babylon i brought you out of the fire of
[29:28] babylon and even from this very phrase i
[29:31] brought you out of ur which means flame
[29:32] or fire of the chaldees there's a jewish
[29:35] tradition that believes that abraham was
[29:37] delivered out of the fiery furnace of
[29:39] nimrod for refusing to obey some false
[29:41] god because the meaning of this phrase
[29:43] is i brought you out of the fire in the
[29:46] flame of chaldea
[29:49] i am jehovah who led you out of the
[29:51] flame i am jehovah who led you out of
[29:53] the fire to give you this land to
[29:55] possess
[29:56] god is actually making a personal
[29:59] connection with abraham
[30:01] i am the god that brought v he's
[30:03] connecting himself with abraham and he's
[30:05] and in this identification something
[30:07] begins to rise up that i believe we can
[30:10] see is very pronounced in the scripture
[30:12] is he's not the god of noah he's the god
[30:15] of abraham
[30:17] there's an identity that god begins to
[30:19] form to where he's he's he's showing
[30:22] himself to one man very personally i am
[30:24] the jehovah that led you out of the fire
[30:26] of babylon to give you something to
[30:28] possess god is becoming personal to
[30:30] abraham not just in the way that shem
[30:33] could be dramatically telling the story
[30:35] that god came down and spoke to my
[30:37] father noah and told them to build the
[30:39] ark because the whole world is going to
[30:41] be destroyed by a flood and he preached
[30:43] this for so long and no one believed him
[30:45] and he preached it for a hundred years
[30:47] but finally one day we and our wives
[30:49] that were called to gather into the ark
[30:51] and and after so many days the door was
[30:53] shut and then the rain began to fall and
[30:55] we were on this ark for so long and
[30:57] begin to tell the testes that god said
[30:59] he would do it god did it and everyone
[31:01] stands in awe of this god and what would
[31:03] be developed and i want you to think
[31:05] about this mythology is being developed
[31:07] in some ways
[31:08] stories that survive today in all
[31:10] cultures across all every culture every
[31:13] religion has a what's called the flood
[31:15] myth or flood mythology where oh this
[31:18] this civilization was destroyed by flood
[31:20] and and this god got angry because this
[31:22] lesser god did this to this other god
[31:25] and so he caused a flood to sweep over
[31:27] the whole island and civilizations and
[31:29] people are destroyed there's a lot of
[31:31] myths that would be developed and if all
[31:33] you're doing is hearing what somebody
[31:35] else said and walking away and all you
[31:38] have is somebody else's word for it then
[31:40] in some ways that's all you have is a
[31:42] myth
[31:45] it's interesting to think about
[31:47] happy thanksgiving
[31:50] now romans chapter 4 verses 11 to 16 i
[31:54] want to read this
[31:55] and hopefully be able just to read it
[31:58] um
[31:59] just read through it and not get stopped
[32:01] too much
[32:02] it says and he re speaking now of
[32:04] abraham and he received the sign of
[32:06] circumcision a seal of the righteousness
[32:09] of the faith which he had yet being
[32:11] uncircumcised so
[32:13] the seal of god which is the new birth
[32:15] was according to the faith that he had
[32:18] that he might but which is the type of
[32:19] the new birth that he might be the
[32:21] father of all the circumcision is the
[32:23] type of that that he might be this is
[32:25] the phrase i'm wanting to see that he
[32:27] might be the father of all them that
[32:29] believe this is very strong words of of
[32:32] paul
[32:33] abraham is the father of all them that
[32:36] believe though they be not circumcised
[32:38] and we realize that he's trying to draw
[32:40] this distinction between they have the
[32:41] circumcision and those of the
[32:43] uncircumcision to see how the gospel has
[32:45] turned to the jews
[32:47] and that it's not the circumcision of
[32:48] the flesh that makes you a son or
[32:50] daughter of god but he says he's the
[32:52] father of all them that believe
[32:54] that righteousness might be imputed unto
[32:56] them also
[32:57] and the father of circumcision to them
[32:59] who are not of the circumcision only but
[33:02] who also walk in the steps of the faith
[33:05] of our father abraham which he had being
[33:08] yet uncircumcised for the promise that
[33:11] he should be the heir of the world was
[33:12] not to abraham or to his seed through
[33:14] the law but through the righteousness of
[33:17] faith for they which are of the law be
[33:19] heirs faith is made void and the promise
[33:21] made of none effect because the law
[33:24] worketh wrath for where no law is there
[33:26] is no transgression therefore it is of
[33:28] faith that it might be by grace
[33:30] to the end the promise might be sure to
[33:33] all the seed not to that only which is
[33:35] of the law which would be israel but to
[33:38] that also which is of the faith of
[33:40] abraham who is the father of us all
[33:44] that what i'm wanting to
[33:46] emphasize is how that abraham
[33:50] is identified in the scripture as the
[33:52] father of all those that believe
[33:55] and
[33:56] he or he's the first he's a progenitor
[33:58] he's the parent
[34:00] of all other believers
[34:02] and the phrase the father of all them
[34:03] that believe the father of circumcision
[34:05] to them who are not circumcised the
[34:07] faith and he says that the steps of the
[34:09] faith of our father abraham that he is
[34:11] the uh he's the father and it's to the
[34:14] promises to those which are of the faith
[34:17] of abraham who is the father of us all
[34:20] remember abraham means exalted father of
[34:23] a great multitude he is the father of
[34:26] the faith paul is saying he is the
[34:27] father of us all that puts abraham in a
[34:30] very unique position right we talk about
[34:33] his faith is legendary so much so that
[34:35] we more idolize him than we do relate to
[34:37] him but abraham is the father of faith
[34:39] the father of us all the father of jews
[34:41] father of gentiles in faith in their
[34:43] belief and conviction of god
[34:46] he writes it this way to the galatians
[34:48] galatians chapter 3 verse 9 so then they
[34:50] which be of faith
[34:52] are blessed with faithful abraham
[34:56] let's not lose sight of kind of what my
[34:58] my story
[34:59] the ark of my story is today that
[35:02] the character of god is revealed in the
[35:04] life of abraham
[35:06] and all we would have to go by god's
[35:09] character would have been the instances
[35:10] from genesis chapter 1 to genesis
[35:12] chapter 11. but now in abraham we're
[35:15] having an opportunity to see very deeply
[35:17] into the character of god
[35:19] and as the scripture looks at abraham he
[35:21] is the father of us our faith the father
[35:22] of us all the father of all them that
[35:24] believe and abraham is called faithful
[35:27] abraham trustee he's true he's believing
[35:30] faithful abraham he's one that believes
[35:32] and you'll find that as paul talks about
[35:34] abraham faith is the primary character
[35:36] that paul emphasizes the primary
[35:39] character of abraham that is emphasized
[35:41] in the new testament abraham is the
[35:43] father of faith he's the father of all
[35:45] them that believe he's called faithful
[35:47] abraham
[35:49] and
[35:50] his
[35:52] this designation of faithful abraham and
[35:55] abraham's character being called
[35:57] faithful is not about his reputation
[36:00] with mankind
[36:02] if i uh
[36:04] um
[36:04] not that you're looking at me like a
[36:06] mule at a new gate but i feel like i
[36:08] come
[36:09] like i haven't preached on abraham for
[36:10] the last 14 services in some ways i
[36:12] don't know if it's too hot or too cold
[36:14] if we need to loosen up a little bit
[36:16] relax
[36:18] and open up your hearts to receive from
[36:19] the lord but if
[36:21] it's not abraham's reputation with man
[36:24] that caused everybody say there's
[36:26] faithful abraham if he tells you he's
[36:27] going to do something he does it there's
[36:29] faithful abraham you can trust in him
[36:31] you can really really rely on him but
[36:33] the character faithful to abraham was
[36:35] about his faith in god
[36:38] when he's called faithful abraham it's
[36:39] not his dependency it's not his
[36:41] trustworthiness it's not that we could
[36:43] believe abraham but that abraham
[36:45] believed god
[36:47] and in james chapter 2 verses 22 to 23
[36:51] this has been a very significant
[36:53] scripture for us in this series he says
[36:55] see us now how faith wrought with his
[36:57] works and by works was faith made
[36:59] perfect how that when he offered up
[37:02] isaac as a sacrifice and so he's saying
[37:04] see how that his faith was wrought with
[37:06] his works and by the works of abraham in
[37:08] offering up isaac his faith was made
[37:10] perfect now notice what verse 23 says
[37:13] and the scripture was fulfilled which
[37:15] saith abraham believed god and it was
[37:18] imputed unto him for righteousness so
[37:20] this is when the scripture
[37:23] there's a fulfillment of these things
[37:25] expressed to abraham abraham believed
[37:27] god and it was imputed unto him for
[37:29] righteousness and notice this phrase
[37:31] and he was called the friend of god
[37:35] that's an extraordinary phrase
[37:38] abraham is called the friend of god in
[37:40] other words god took abraham as his own
[37:44] friend
[37:45] abraham being called the friend of god
[37:47] abraham becomes a companion and even a
[37:49] confident of god that god takes him as a
[37:52] friend and he has a relationship with
[37:54] abraham and we can see this expressed
[37:56] how that when god is going to judge
[37:58] sodom and gomorrah what the khan if i
[38:00] say conflict but notice the internal
[38:02] dialogue that god has within himself he
[38:04] says can i hide this thing from abraham
[38:06] what i'm about to do oh this is how a
[38:09] friend feels when he knows something and
[38:11] he knows that his friend would want to
[38:13] know and he's like hey i can't hide this
[38:14] for you anymore i've got to tell you
[38:16] this secret i got to tell you what i'm
[38:17] about to do you're the first one to know
[38:19] anybody have a friend like that you
[38:20] don't have to raise your hand look we're
[38:22] all we all don't have a friend like that
[38:24] so glad i have a friend in jesus
[38:26] nobody knows the trouble i feel
[38:29] but abraham had a friend that was
[38:31] excited to share with him
[38:34] or belonged to and wanted to share with
[38:36] him things that only he knew and this is
[38:38] demonstrative of the friendship that god
[38:41] had with abraham
[38:43] think of this phrase he was called the
[38:45] friend of god
[38:47] in john chapter 15 verses 13 to 16
[38:50] greater love hath no man than this that
[38:52] a man laid down his life for his friends
[38:56] there's no greater love than this love
[38:58] that would cause a man to lay down his
[39:00] life for his friends this is what christ
[39:02] is going to do for his friends and
[39:03] notice how he speaks to his disciples ye
[39:06] are my friends if you do whatsoever i
[39:08] command you so you're a friend if you do
[39:11] what your friend says right friends
[39:13] right so a friend if you do whatsoever i
[39:16] command you henceforth i call you not
[39:18] servants for the servant knoweth not
[39:20] what his lord doeth but i have called
[39:23] you friends for all things here's
[39:25] another designation of what a friend is
[39:26] a friend is one that does what somebody
[39:28] else with a friend says to do and there
[39:31] is another designation of this
[39:32] friendship with god for all things that
[39:34] i have heard of my father i have made
[39:36] known unto you so through friendship
[39:38] special knowledge is imparted
[39:40] through friendship special things are
[39:41] revealed and shared and then in the
[39:43] context of that relationship and that
[39:45] friendship the things that are received
[39:47] are acted upon
[39:48] and so there's a difference then
[39:50] servants and those who are servants and
[39:52] have a particular knowledge of god and a
[39:55] certain obedience and strictness or
[39:57] discipline to him who do it uh through
[40:00] certain
[40:01] functions and forms and then there's a
[40:02] difference in those who are friends of
[40:04] god who are friends of christ who
[40:06] special knowledge is made known to them
[40:08] and then they act upon that obediently
[40:11] and then notice how beautiful this is
[40:13] you have not chosen me but i have chosen
[40:16] you and ordained you we know that we can
[40:18] this is him picking his friends so he
[40:20] says i have chosen you and ordained you
[40:22] that you should go and bring forth fruit
[40:24] and that your fruit should remain and
[40:26] whatsoever ye shall ask of the father in
[40:28] my name he may give it to you
[40:32] this is friendship
[40:33] this is the relationship that jesus is
[40:35] now expressing to the seat of abraham
[40:38] look i have chosen you i have called you
[40:40] we walk together i'm sharing you the
[40:43] things that the father shows me how can
[40:44] i
[40:45] not share with you the things that have
[40:46] been shared with me i must tell you
[40:48] these secret things i must speak plainly
[40:50] to you and then you are my friends
[40:52] because you do what i'm asking you to do
[40:54] and he's describing this beautiful
[40:56] relationship and you'll find that
[40:58] abraham seed entered into this
[41:00] relationship with the seed of abraham
[41:02] and abraham meets both of these
[41:04] requirements in his relationship with
[41:06] god
[41:08] god is has made abraham a friend
[41:12] abraham was loved by god with an
[41:14] unfailing love
[41:17] god showed great kindness to him and a
[41:19] stubborn grace he showed a relentless
[41:21] mercy towards him and god took great
[41:24] care of abraham he called him by grace
[41:26] he blessed him with spiritual blessing
[41:28] natural blessings he increased him and
[41:30] gave him possessions god favored him
[41:34] you find that god communed with him god
[41:36] honored him
[41:38] think about this
[41:39] god was so tight
[41:41] with abraham
[41:43] that god made abraham's friends his
[41:45] friends and abraham's enemies his
[41:47] enemies
[41:49] think about it
[41:51] like this is this
[41:52] i was gonna say it's the original
[41:53] bromance but that's maybe more modern
[41:55] parlance but god is saying hey i
[41:58] i'm sticking with you
[42:00] if anybody's got beef with you they've
[42:02] got beef with me
[42:03] if you're good with somebody else
[42:05] they're good with me we know what those
[42:06] kind of relationships are like right oh
[42:08] you're a friend of his then you're a
[42:09] friend of mine oh he's their enemy then
[42:11] he's my enemy and god is literally
[42:14] saying abraham we're in this together
[42:17] whoever curses you i curse him whoever
[42:20] blesses you i'll bless him whoever your
[42:22] friends are or my friends whoever your
[42:24] enemies are my enemies this is god
[42:26] expressing the friendship that he had
[42:28] with abraham
[42:31] and so when we
[42:33] and i and i shared that portion
[42:36] to express this about the character of
[42:38] faithful abraham
[42:40] abraham's faithfulness as the bible
[42:43] calls it is a reflection of his
[42:45] friendship with christ or with god
[42:48] abraham's faithfulness isn't like
[42:50] abraham was a good dude everybody wanted
[42:52] to follow him everybody liked him
[42:54] everybody wanted to be his friend he was
[42:55] really really popular god got really
[42:57] jealous showed up in earth separated it
[42:58] from his crew brought him in the middle
[43:00] of nowhere and canaan was really jealous
[43:02] and possessive held him to himself
[43:03] abused him and manipulated him to where
[43:04] god was his only friend had no other
[43:06] families had no other friends and it was
[43:08] only god and he finally got him to
[43:09] himself
[43:11] anybody ever been in a relationship like
[43:12] that they're the worst
[43:14] that's not what god did
[43:16] that's not what god was doing with
[43:18] abraham god was not uh god had become
[43:23] and it wasn't something in abraham that
[43:25] god
[43:26] that he was faithful and he was good and
[43:28] he was kind and he was rich and and he
[43:30] had a particular reputation but god that
[43:32] abraham's faithfulness what was brought
[43:34] out of him and what he became that the
[43:37] scripture can memorialize him as the
[43:38] father of all that believe the father of
[43:40] circumcision and uncircumcision and the
[43:42] faith of abraham who is the father of us
[43:44] all and call him faithful abraham and to
[43:46] be called the friend of god abraham's
[43:48] faithfulness is a reflection of that
[43:50] friendship a reflection of the influence
[43:52] he yielded himself to
[43:55] really speaks to the importance of
[43:56] having the right kind of friends
[43:59] because he's called faithful abraham but
[44:01] you'll find in the scripture there's
[44:02] only one other person who's called
[44:04] faithful
[44:05] there's a servant who's faithful in all
[44:07] his house and there's different
[44:09] references to faithfulness but as far as
[44:10] a characterization of one who's faithful
[44:13] it says in deuteronomy 7 9 know
[44:15] therefore that the lord thy god he is
[44:17] god the faithful god
[44:20] how is it that abraham became faithful
[44:22] abraham he was under the headship of the
[44:24] faithful god
[44:28] god chose abraham to be his disciple
[44:32] god chose to guide him to teach him to
[44:35] encourage him when he said i called you
[44:36] out of the fire of cow dee and brought
[44:38] you i'm going to lead you i'm going to
[44:40] shepherd you i'm going to guide you and
[44:42] i'm going to be with you
[44:44] this is this is the the thrust that i
[44:46] want i want to emphasize at this in this
[44:48] moment faithful abraham that
[44:51] characterization of faithful abraham
[44:53] he's received that character because he
[44:56] has yielded himself to the influence of
[44:59] god and god being faithful it made
[45:02] abraham faithful that's why abraham
[45:05] could be called faithful abraham
[45:08] notice this
[45:09] this
[45:10] god his
[45:12] god inserting himself into abraham's
[45:14] life in genesis chapter 15 verse 1.
[45:18] after these things the word of the lord
[45:19] came unto abram in a vision saying fear
[45:22] not abram
[45:24] i am thy shield
[45:26] and thy exceeding
[45:28] great reward
[45:30] what a what a contrast to adam now
[45:35] that without we don't know what abraham
[45:38] was going through exactly in this
[45:40] whether or not maybe he's fearing
[45:41] reprisal from the kings or he's worried
[45:44] if this is going to become a regular
[45:45] thing with lot we don't really have much
[45:47] context as to why god wanted to tell him
[45:50] not to fear we addressed we looked at
[45:52] before how there was this underlying
[45:53] fear that abraham had about death that
[45:56] that came up in certain instances but
[45:57] he's saying fear not abram and notice
[46:00] how beautiful that is he calls him by
[46:02] name
[46:04] so it's not just get thee out and do
[46:06] this and do that but he wants to use his
[46:08] name and in using his name he's wanting
[46:11] to bring this familiarity he's wanting
[46:13] him to know abram i'm speaking your name
[46:15] he's using his name to calm him to allay
[46:17] his fears to comfort him and he says i
[46:20] am thy shield which is buckler i am thy
[46:22] covering i am thy surrounding and and
[46:25] thy exceeding great reward i am your
[46:28] recompense i am your wage
[46:31] and this becomes a language that is
[46:34] unique to abraham
[46:37] that what god is saying to abraham like
[46:38] these words that are kind of in our
[46:40] vocabulary you want to know their
[46:42] genesis with abraham
[46:44] we begin to think of god and certain
[46:46] attributes of god and characteristics of
[46:47] god and
[46:48] and things that are rehearsed and and
[46:50] spoken of quite often in in the psalms
[46:53] and in the prophets and of the children
[46:55] of israel and find this beautiful
[46:56] language describing god well we we know
[46:59] about it because he told abraham i am
[47:02] thy covering i am thy surrounding i am
[47:05] your shield and i will be your wage i
[47:06] will be your recompense this is a
[47:08] language that is special to abraham
[47:12] notice in ruth chapter 2 verse 12
[47:15] when boaz is speaking to ruth he says
[47:17] the lord recompense thy work
[47:20] and a full reward be given thee of the
[47:23] lord god of israel under whose wings
[47:26] thou art come to trust
[47:28] he is reciting the blessing of abraham
[47:31] he is using words that are expressed of
[47:33] god's relationship to abraham and
[47:35] abraham's faithfulness to god in god's
[47:38] blessing upon abraham and then by
[47:40] extension to the seed after him these
[47:42] are words that relate and have their
[47:44] genesis in the relationship that god had
[47:46] to abraham i will recompense thy work a
[47:49] full reward will be given thee the lord
[47:51] god of israel under whose wings thou art
[47:54] come to trust
[47:56] you think of how god is speaking to
[47:58] abraham and raising up these things i'll
[48:01] be your shield i'll be your buckler i'll
[48:02] be your your exceeding great reward
[48:06] and he's coming to calm
[48:09] abraham's fears
[48:11] remember god placed adam and the woman
[48:13] on a conditional covenant
[48:16] and i want to be very careful on how i
[48:18] phrase this
[48:19] because
[48:20] we know that they had a perfect
[48:22] understanding of the love of god and
[48:24] there was perfection all around them
[48:27] but yet in reality there was a limited
[48:30] revelation of god
[48:34] and and so in this conditional covenant
[48:37] that is limited in other words you you
[48:39] can you can go beyond this and break it
[48:42] there's this there's something that was
[48:43] capitalized on in the fall that produced
[48:46] the doubt and then on this basis of this
[48:49] covenant in genesis chapter 3 verses 8
[48:51] verses 8 9 and 10
[48:53] after the fall here's adam and they they
[48:55] heard and the woman they heard the voice
[48:57] of the lord god walking in the garden in
[48:59] the cool of the day
[49:01] and adam and his wife hid themselves
[49:03] from the presence of the lord god among
[49:05] the trees of the garden and the lord god
[49:08] called unto adam and said to him where
[49:10] art thou and he said i heard thy voice
[49:12] in the garden and i was afraid because i
[49:15] was naked and i hid myself
[49:18] i i'd like to just say something very
[49:20] quickly
[49:22] and and perhaps not expound upon it very
[49:24] much but why was adam afraid
[49:27] the covenant
[49:29] the reason why adam was afraid and he
[49:31] hid himself is he was told i'm going to
[49:33] make a promise with you
[49:35] you can eat everything and have dominion
[49:37] and bring forth and do genesis 1 28 have
[49:39] dominion have power bring forth seed do
[49:41] all this but there's one thing you can't
[49:43] do eat of the tree of knowledge of good
[49:44] and evil because the day you eat that
[49:45] day you die that's the covenant
[49:48] and so when adam breaks and transgresses
[49:51] the covenant he's afraid because of the
[49:53] covenant
[49:55] so adam is acting in fear and he's all
[49:57] nervous and he's all worried and so this
[49:59] is
[50:00] god
[50:01] in that moment in that instance when
[50:03] mankind is afraid notice god doesn't say
[50:06] adam be not afraid
[50:09] he's saying where are you
[50:11] where are you why did you hide why are
[50:13] you hiding well i heard your voice and i
[50:15] was afraid well why why are you afraid
[50:18] it's the woman she did it to me well
[50:19] what did she do well you know that thing
[50:21] you told me not to do
[50:22] and it's and god says you know what
[50:24] because you've done this
[50:26] and judgment just starts to go forth
[50:30] and so adam with what he would have
[50:32] known about god and experienced about
[50:34] god
[50:35] there's still this fear that comes up in
[50:38] a moment of unbelief
[50:40] in god's judgment immediate judgment
[50:42] because of it
[50:44] and then if we could kind of take this
[50:47] out a step further and begin to think
[50:49] about how the situation would be after
[50:51] the fall
[50:53] after the fall those that have come
[50:54] forth whether it be able and cane and
[50:56] all the different seed that would come
[50:58] forth after the fall from genesis 5 all
[51:00] the way to genesis 11. they don't even
[51:03] have the knowledge and understanding
[51:04] that adam had
[51:06] so think of how adam relates to god in
[51:08] the garden he's thrust out under a
[51:11] punishment but then with the promise of
[51:13] genesis 3 15 so there's this hope that's
[51:15] given we see god giving revelation to
[51:18] abel we see god correcting cain but from
[51:20] that moment on mankind is going to have
[51:22] a much more limited understanding with
[51:25] god and really the fellowship communion
[51:27] and relationship that mankind had with
[51:29] god was cut off through the fall
[51:33] so this is mankind as it exists and
[51:35] begins to populate the earth they don't
[51:37] even know god at all the way that adam
[51:40] knew him
[51:41] so in abraham god is building back
[51:43] relationship
[51:44] and abraham god is building back
[51:46] fellowship he's building back communion
[51:48] god has established in a relationship
[51:50] with one man and he's going to deal with
[51:52] him over the course of his life a
[51:54] greater portion of his life and deal
[51:56] with him in certain ways so that abraham
[51:58] can come to know god and build
[52:01] relationship build fellowship build
[52:03] communion ultimately to build what trust
[52:08] faithfulness
[52:10] i was blessed by the song great as thy
[52:12] faithfulness this was the theme that was
[52:13] in my heart as god began to call abraham
[52:16] god is wanting to build trust and so god
[52:19] as he deals with abraham in in abraham's
[52:22] difficulty and and i guess i could say
[52:24] he says fear not abraham and abraham's
[52:26] immediate thought is well i've got this
[52:28] servant in my house
[52:30] maybe he's the one that's going to be
[52:31] the heir god is renewing the covenant
[52:33] god is confirming the covenant god is
[52:35] sharing things with abraham why he's
[52:37] wanting to establish relationship and
[52:39] build trust
[52:41] different than what took place in the
[52:43] garden it was adam broke trust there was
[52:45] immediate punishment
[52:49] and if i could say things in a way that
[52:51] kind of summarizes
[52:53] every circumstance in abraham's life
[52:57] every condition that existed in his life
[53:00] was an opportunity to learn to trust god
[53:03] or an opportunity to demonstrate trust
[53:05] in god
[53:07] think about the life of abraham in that
[53:09] regard that every condition every
[53:11] circumstance every weakness every trial
[53:13] everything he went through was either an
[53:15] opportunity to learn to trust god
[53:18] or to demonstrate trust that he had
[53:21] learned
[53:25] god was going to establish
[53:27] he needed to god was going to establish
[53:29] a basis to express his love
[53:31] some sort of context to express his
[53:33] nature and build trust and to build
[53:35] faith
[53:36] it says in psalms 36 7 how excellent is
[53:39] i loving kindness oh god i've heard that
[53:41] before how excellent is i love and
[53:42] kindness and the writer says therefore
[53:45] the children of men put their trust
[53:47] under the shadow of thy wings
[53:49] why is it that the children
[53:51] of men put their trust under the shadow
[53:53] of his wings because how excellent is
[53:56] thy loving kindness do you notice it's
[53:58] this knowledge of the excellency of his
[54:00] loving kindness that causes man to trust
[54:02] under the shadow of his wings
[54:04] it's like come over here you your
[54:06] knucklehead i'm going to let you have it
[54:07] it's like oh god here i come it's not
[54:10] that kind of brutish intimidation and
[54:13] threat it's like because of thy
[54:14] excellent loving kindness we've come to
[54:17] trust under the shadow of thy wings this
[54:19] is what's made known to abraham and his
[54:21] seed the excellency of his loving
[54:23] kindness that was compelling to the seed
[54:25] of abraham to learn to trust under his
[54:27] wing
[54:29] i want to read psalm 91 verses 1 to 6
[54:32] and since i want to i will
[54:34] and reading this
[54:35] i
[54:35] hope that you can kind of catch how this
[54:37] language spoken of now about god start
[54:40] to put abraham in this figure and how
[54:42] this is first expressed in the man
[54:44] abraham psalm 91 1-6 he that dwelleth in
[54:47] the secret place of the most high
[54:52] this phrase the most high
[54:55] it's very important
[54:59] just trying to see where i'm at in this
[55:03] the most high means supreme
[55:07] he that dwell from the secret place of
[55:08] the supreme
[55:10] shall abide under the shadow of the
[55:12] almighty under the almighty shadow
[55:13] notice what's there under this shadow i
[55:15] will say of the lord he is my refuge in
[55:18] my fortress my god in him will i trust
[55:22] surely he shall deliver thee from the
[55:24] snare of the fowler and from the noisome
[55:26] pestilence he shall cover thee with thy
[55:28] feathers this is a language amplifying
[55:30] what god said abram i am thy shield i am
[55:34] your recompense
[55:36] he is my refuge my fortress i will trust
[55:39] in him he will deliver thee he will
[55:40] cover thee under his wing shout thou
[55:43] trust
[55:44] his truth shall be thy shield and
[55:46] buckler thou shalt not be afraid abram
[55:48] don't be afraid i am thy shield for the
[55:51] terror by night nor for the arrow that
[55:52] flyeth by day nor for the pestilence
[55:54] that walketh in the darkness nor for the
[55:56] destruction that wasteth at noonday
[55:59] notice how beautifully these things are
[56:00] being expressed from the seed of abraham
[56:03] about the the wings of the almighty
[56:05] saying come trust under my wings
[56:09] and you've come to trust under these
[56:10] wings how excellent is i loving kindness
[56:13] i'm wanting to express this attribute of
[56:15] how that god takes his wings and gathers
[56:18] somebody close to his bosom and it's
[56:21] there that it's this place of safety to
[56:24] learn to trust this one that has
[56:26] gathered you learn to trust this one
[56:28] that is speaking you learn to trust this
[56:30] one that is feeding you and that's what
[56:32] god wants to build we use the word faith
[56:35] but recognize that faith is trust
[56:41] i want you to trust me
[56:44] this is so this is where the this this
[56:47] most high
[56:49] we see this first come up in
[56:50] relationship to abraham in genesis 14
[56:53] verses 18 to 21
[56:55] and melchizedek king of salem
[56:58] king of peace king of shalom
[57:01] king of salem brought forth bread and
[57:02] wine
[57:03] and he was the priest of
[57:05] the most high god
[57:07] the supreme
[57:09] supreme god and he blessed him and he
[57:12] said bless be abram i love this of the
[57:15] most high god
[57:18] that only
[57:20] the god of abraham
[57:22] that's abraham of
[57:24] the god of abraham abraham of the most
[57:27] high it becomes interchangeable now
[57:30] i am the god of abraham this is abraham
[57:33] of the god the most high god abraham of
[57:35] the supreme
[57:36] possessor of heaven and earth and
[57:39] blessed be the most high god so now
[57:41] abram is blessed now the supreme is
[57:44] blessed
[57:46] who have delivered thine enemies into
[57:48] thy hand why because he said i will
[57:49] deliver thee from the snare of the
[57:51] fowler i'll be your fortress i'll be
[57:53] your refuge and he gave him abram now
[57:56] gave him tithes of all
[57:58] it's remarkable how that you see abram
[58:00] building altars which is a type of
[58:01] church you see him paying his tithe you
[58:03] could see these this demonstration of
[58:05] the christian spirit in abraham
[58:08] now immediately
[58:09] and the king of sodom said unto abram
[58:12] give me the persons and take the goods
[58:14] to thyself in other words those that if
[58:16] you rescued from the kings let me have
[58:17] the people you keep the goods and abram
[58:19] said to the king of sodom
[58:22] and i want you to kind of catch the
[58:23] image here i have lift up my hand unto
[58:26] the lord
[58:27] the supreme
[58:29] i lift up my hand of the lord the most
[58:31] high god the possessor of heaven and
[58:34] earth now in his immediately after he
[58:38] has met with the king of salem met with
[58:40] melchizedek and melchizedek says uh he
[58:43] is the priest of the most high god
[58:44] blessed be abram of the most high god
[58:47] blessed be the most high god and now
[58:49] when sodom confronts him and he
[58:51] recognizes the trick i'm not going to
[58:53] take anything lest you brag that i have
[58:56] been made rich by your hand he didn't
[58:58] want there to be any confusion that it's
[59:00] the supreme that blessed him it's the
[59:03] supreme that was looking out for him it
[59:05] was the supreme that had his back and so
[59:07] he lifts his hand up and it says if he's
[59:09] swearing i lift up my hand the lord he
[59:12] says the most high god the possessor of
[59:14] heaven and earth what has he just done
[59:16] he has just echoed melchizedek
[59:20] because mel kazakh just said bless be
[59:22] him he said blessed be abram of the most
[59:24] high god possessor of heaven and earth
[59:26] he has been taught by melchizedek and
[59:29] he's immediately marrying and reflecting
[59:32] back the revelation of melchizedek and
[59:34] he says i am lifting my hand and i'm
[59:37] swearing by and i'm trusting to the
[59:39] supreme the possessor of heaven and
[59:42] earth
[59:44] because when you take what's taking when
[59:45] you look at what's taking place in this
[59:47] and i'm using a figurative speech but
[59:49] this is literally what's happening god
[59:52] takes abraham under his wings
[59:55] and mentors him to supreme faith
[59:58] why was it supreme faith it's the
[1:00:00] supreme god
[1:00:01] he's the supreme and he takes abraham
[1:00:04] the image i want you to catch is the
[1:00:06] faithful abraham god comes down in his
[1:00:09] greatness just takes abraham under his
[1:00:11] wings and is going to nurture him to
[1:00:13] supreme faith
[1:00:15] it says in hebrews 11 17 by faith
[1:00:17] abraham when he was tried offered up
[1:00:20] isaac
[1:00:21] and he that had received the promise
[1:00:22] offered up his only begotten son
[1:00:26] when he was tried tested placed under
[1:00:29] trial
[1:00:30] spoken of in a way that the purpose of
[1:00:32] determining character tests going to
[1:00:33] prove something something's going to
[1:00:35] come out of it
[1:00:36] so abraham
[1:00:38] by faith when he was tried
[1:00:41] so he had a faith that was tested and
[1:00:43] proven
[1:00:44] and then he offered up isaac so there's
[1:00:46] a faith that is built a faith that is
[1:00:48] tested and then it comes to its supreme
[1:00:50] expression and offering up isaac so
[1:00:53] abraham we have to catch this
[1:00:54] characteristic abraham himself was tried
[1:00:57] in the next chapter paul writes verse 12
[1:01:00] chapter 12 verse 6 for whom the lord
[1:01:02] loveth he loved abraham
[1:01:04] he chasteneth and scourgeth every son
[1:01:07] whom he receiveth
[1:01:09] now these are words that seem very uh
[1:01:12] they're kind of aggravating
[1:01:14] someone i'm going to scourge you
[1:01:16] and chastening it it has such a
[1:01:18] a rough context to it
[1:01:21] but this is an aspect that i think that
[1:01:23] is very important that we not miss in
[1:01:25] abraham's life
[1:01:27] abraham is learning
[1:01:29] abraham is being taught
[1:01:32] abraham is being tested on what he
[1:01:33] learned abraham has been improved on
[1:01:35] what he has gained
[1:01:37] and so it says that
[1:01:39] he is to chasten it means to train
[1:01:42] to be instructed or taught
[1:01:44] to cause one to learn
[1:01:46] abraham when he was tried abraham was
[1:01:48] chasing abraham was taught he was
[1:01:50] instructed he was trained this is what's
[1:01:52] taking place when melchizedek comes down
[1:01:54] and begins to speak to abram king of
[1:01:56] salem serving him communion and he takes
[1:01:58] this communion this bread and wine and
[1:02:00] he's having his communion with
[1:02:01] melchizedek and he begins to catch the
[1:02:03] revelation of the supreme you are abram
[1:02:06] of the supreme possessor of heaven and
[1:02:09] earth so that when sodom comes to
[1:02:11] confront him in the wise feast in the
[1:02:13] presence of sodom feast at the table of
[1:02:15] melchizedek there's going to be a
[1:02:17] temptation and he says i have swore i
[1:02:20] have submitted to i am under the care of
[1:02:22] the supreme the possessor of heaven and
[1:02:25] earth he learned from melchizedek
[1:02:30] to scourge it means to whip or to plague
[1:02:32] so i'm gonna plug you
[1:02:34] i'm gonna we use maybe whip
[1:02:37] or we used to right
[1:02:41] just in case the uh
[1:02:43] child protection services is streaming
[1:02:45] in today
[1:02:48] but we there's a
[1:02:50] this chastening the scourging it speaks
[1:02:52] uh uh i mean the word literally speaks
[1:02:54] of whipping or plaguing
[1:02:56] but it's the causing
[1:02:58] uh to cause a a difficulty
[1:03:02] and in other words it to to
[1:03:04] even into it whether it be to actually
[1:03:06] chastise to to use the rod to cause use
[1:03:09] some sort of spanking corrective measure
[1:03:11] it's in order to do it in order to
[1:03:12] discipline
[1:03:14] there's a chastening which is a teaching
[1:03:15] and a training and then there's a
[1:03:17] scourging which is a discipline in order
[1:03:19] to correct not punitive to punish but
[1:03:21] remedial in order to remediate conduct
[1:03:23] to improve conduct to change behavior
[1:03:26] remember as parents our correction is to
[1:03:29] improve conduct not punish bad conduct
[1:03:32] alone
[1:03:33] well this is what god is doing in
[1:03:35] abraham he is doing this in order to
[1:03:37] improve abraham's character and so and
[1:03:40] abraham was tried he was chastened he
[1:03:42] was scourged and listen there's no doubt
[1:03:44] abraham was learning about himself in
[1:03:46] all of this i didn't know i had it in me
[1:03:49] i didn't know i could do this i didn't
[1:03:50] know i could separate from family i
[1:03:51] didn't know i could overcome this i
[1:03:53] found out i was afraid about that i
[1:03:54] found out this was going to happen i had
[1:03:56] no idea i'd be able to resist the
[1:03:57] temptation of sodom and let and let lot
[1:04:00] choose and all these great characters
[1:04:01] that are being brought of abraham but
[1:04:03] not only was he learning about himself
[1:04:04] more importantly he was learning about
[1:04:06] god
[1:04:08] that's the part i want you to get i've
[1:04:10] been preaching for almost an hour and i
[1:04:11] want to just keep emphasizing over and
[1:04:13] over again yes abraham learned a lot
[1:04:16] about himself but what was most
[1:04:18] important is that he learned about god
[1:04:20] so that the things that he learned about
[1:04:22] himself were connected not just the god
[1:04:25] of abraham but the abraham of god that
[1:04:27] he was so connected and tied to it he
[1:04:29] had this friendship with god their bosom
[1:04:32] buddies i roll with you where you go
[1:04:34] i'll go who your enemies are or my
[1:04:36] enemies who your friends are are my
[1:04:38] friends that god was wanting to teach
[1:04:40] abraham something about himself
[1:04:46] god is using abraham's life to hide a
[1:04:48] mystery of himself
[1:04:50] so really when you when you begin to
[1:04:52] look at it and examine it that god
[1:04:54] chooses abraham and as you begin to look
[1:04:56] at abraham and say well how is it he's
[1:04:58] the father of us all
[1:04:59] because god hid himself in abraham
[1:05:02] he hides his he hides the revelation of
[1:05:04] himself in the life of abraham
[1:05:07] and he wants to use abraham in the
[1:05:09] context of abraham and then we can say
[1:05:11] this is shouldn't be hard to get an amen
[1:05:13] out of this but he wants to use abraham
[1:05:15] and his seed after him to reveal his
[1:05:18] entire character
[1:05:19] and the amen is well the seed is christ
[1:05:22] and that's in whom the fullness of the
[1:05:23] godhead dwells right there in christ so
[1:05:26] it's connected to this calling of
[1:05:28] abraham the father of us all
[1:05:30] notice this language in genesis chapter
[1:05:32] 12 verses 2 and 3.
[1:05:34] by the time we're done we're all going
[1:05:36] to have these verses
[1:05:37] absolutely memorized it will haunt us
[1:05:39] all of our days just
[1:05:41] oh genesis 12 2 that's and i will make
[1:05:43] of thee a great nation
[1:05:46] and i will bless thee
[1:05:48] and make thy name great and thou shalt
[1:05:50] be a blessing and i will bless them that
[1:05:52] bless thee and curse him that curseth
[1:05:54] thee
[1:05:55] and in thee shall all families of the
[1:05:57] earth be blessed
[1:05:58] this is god's covenant or promise to
[1:06:00] abraham and we look at how that this is
[1:06:03] the unconditional covenant wherein god
[1:06:05] says i will make i will bless i will
[1:06:09] make thou shalt be i will bless i will
[1:06:12] curse in thee and he's using this
[1:06:14] language
[1:06:16] and so there's a there's this god that
[1:06:18] is doing these things for abraham and
[1:06:20] making abraham something
[1:06:22] and catch this now this is going to
[1:06:24] maybe form the uh my
[1:06:26] uh
[1:06:28] with that as a foundation i'd like to
[1:06:30] preach my sermon this morning
[1:06:31] this can be the rest of the services
[1:06:33] really focused on this aspect here
[1:06:35] this is a promise to abraham but the
[1:06:37] promise to abraham reflects god's
[1:06:40] commitment
[1:06:41] to unfold who he is
[1:06:45] catch this even in the very promising
[1:06:46] covenant that he makes to abraham yes
[1:06:48] this is a promise to abraham to make
[1:06:50] abraham a great nation to bless abraham
[1:06:52] to make his name great but this is god
[1:06:55] actually saying that i'm going to reveal
[1:06:56] myself
[1:06:58] because on one hand it looks like it's
[1:06:59] only about abraham but really it's about
[1:07:02] god's desire
[1:07:04] read it and now see that what god is
[1:07:06] wanting to do and say do unto others as
[1:07:08] you would have them do unto you god is
[1:07:10] now doing something to abraham but think
[1:07:12] about how this reflects god's desire i
[1:07:15] will become a people i will be blessed
[1:07:18] my name will be great i will be a
[1:07:20] blessing and through me will i bless all
[1:07:23] the families of the earth this is
[1:07:26] actually god expressing his vision and
[1:07:29] his desire to have a great name
[1:07:32] and to become a people
[1:07:35] it's not just merely what he was going
[1:07:36] to be doing for abraham but it was what
[1:07:38] he was going to be revealing about
[1:07:39] himself through abraham
[1:07:41] so god hides himself in his dealings
[1:07:43] with abraham in order to reveal his
[1:07:44] character
[1:07:47] in genesis chapter 17 verse 5
[1:07:50] says neither shall thy name anymore be
[1:07:52] called abram
[1:07:54] but thy name shall be abraham
[1:07:58] for a father of many nations have i made
[1:08:00] thee
[1:08:01] he's reflecting god's plan
[1:08:03] we have to let's say god's reflected in
[1:08:05] this because remember the principle is
[1:08:06] this we're not just learning about
[1:08:08] abraham we're learning about god
[1:08:10] we're taught that if you can't see jesus
[1:08:12] christ and every verse of the bible go
[1:08:13] back and read it again there he needs to
[1:08:15] be something that we learn about the
[1:08:16] character and nature of god that's being
[1:08:18] reflected back to us
[1:08:21] so in this he says you're abram now but
[1:08:24] your name is going to be changed to
[1:08:25] abraham
[1:08:26] abram means exalted father
[1:08:30] and it comes from actually the root it
[1:08:31] comes from is the exalted one is my
[1:08:34] father
[1:08:35] so abram is a derivative of the exalted
[1:08:37] one is my father abraham being called
[1:08:40] exalted father it's a clear reference
[1:08:43] and it has this it's synonymous with god
[1:08:44] himself
[1:08:46] the exalted one that's god the exalted
[1:08:48] one as my father abram is exalted father
[1:08:51] there's this this this connection with
[1:08:53] god whereas god is the exalted father
[1:08:56] now abram is given this lesser position
[1:08:58] in this image of abram exalted father
[1:09:02] but abraham is exalted father or father
[1:09:06] of exalted father of a great multitude
[1:09:10] so in this image of of god saying your
[1:09:13] name shall not be abram but i'm going to
[1:09:15] call you abraham there had to be a
[1:09:17] meaning and a purpose behind him
[1:09:19] changing his name his exalted father
[1:09:22] seems to fit the bill because he
[1:09:24] promised him he'd become a dad
[1:09:26] but there's something about the nature
[1:09:27] and character of god that's being
[1:09:29] expressed when he changes his name
[1:09:30] because we can see that how literally
[1:09:32] god changed his name he's given him a
[1:09:34] part of himself
[1:09:36] he's inserted himself into the name of
[1:09:37] abraham so under abram he is the exalted
[1:09:41] father or the exalted one abram the
[1:09:43] exalted one is my father and and adam if
[1:09:47] you look at adam and adam god was a
[1:09:49] father
[1:09:51] but he's the father of one
[1:09:53] adam
[1:09:55] and he's he's exalted father in his
[1:09:56] relationship to abraham to abe to adam
[1:09:59] but now that's in the same image as
[1:10:02] abram he's in the same image as god
[1:10:04] would be to adam but god wants to reveal
[1:10:07] his character he's not just gonna have
[1:10:09] one son but he's gonna have many sons so
[1:10:11] he changes his name from abram which is
[1:10:13] the relationship that god had to adam
[1:10:15] exalted father and he changes abraham to
[1:10:18] abe abram to abraham which means the
[1:10:20] father of many
[1:10:22] why because god would become the father
[1:10:24] of many
[1:10:26] romans 8 29 for whom he did for no he
[1:10:28] also did predestinate to be conformed to
[1:10:29] the image of his son that he might be
[1:10:32] born the firstborn among many brethren
[1:10:36] so the change of name wasn't just
[1:10:37] important to abraham but it was
[1:10:39] important to reflect that god who had
[1:10:41] one son adam is now going to have many
[1:10:43] sons from the seed of abraham
[1:10:48] this is just one example just choose one
[1:10:50] example
[1:10:51] of how god's wanting to show his nature
[1:10:53] to the life of abraham
[1:10:55] and god allows certain things in
[1:10:56] abraham's life to create tension
[1:10:58] to create conflict
[1:11:00] in order to show god's nature not just
[1:11:02] abraham's
[1:11:04] when god changes abraham's name
[1:11:06] from abram he's revealing his own name
[1:11:11] the name of god we know it hides the
[1:11:13] character of god
[1:11:15] when god has a name when he's expressed
[1:11:17] with the name it has it has something to
[1:11:18] do with the character brother said a
[1:11:20] name has something to do with its
[1:11:21] character
[1:11:23] he said a name is associated with the
[1:11:24] nature of its character
[1:11:27] and so a name is something that hides a
[1:11:29] particular life is particular power
[1:11:30] there's something to a name we taught
[1:11:32] that even to the point where we said hey
[1:11:33] be careful what you name your children
[1:11:36] because there's something in a name
[1:11:38] bill of ram says about god an unveiling
[1:11:40] of god he never changed his nature only
[1:11:42] his form
[1:11:44] so god is always the same in his nature
[1:11:46] he just changes the way that he
[1:11:47] expresses himself so even when god is
[1:11:49] given a particular name the name reveals
[1:11:51] something about his nature and his
[1:11:52] character but yet all the nature and
[1:11:54] character of god is still in the person
[1:11:57] so he says like i changed from husband
[1:11:59] when my child is born then i'm father
[1:12:02] so your husband when you're married so
[1:12:04] you're just single you're just aaron
[1:12:05] then you get married and you become
[1:12:06] husband or you can be son you get
[1:12:08] married you become husband when you have
[1:12:09] a child you become father and so what it
[1:12:11] does is it reveals character when
[1:12:13] relationship begins to change
[1:12:15] and so there's something i just kind of
[1:12:16] reviewing these things that i know
[1:12:18] you're well taught on this that there's
[1:12:19] something to the name in the name that
[1:12:21] god is when he changes abram to abraham
[1:12:24] god is revealing something about himself
[1:12:26] he's revealing his own name in abram
[1:12:29] so in genesis chapter 22 when supreme
[1:12:32] faith is expressed on mount moriah
[1:12:34] here's abraham with this declaration and
[1:12:37] he and god is made known as jehovah
[1:12:39] jireh
[1:12:41] the one who sees and provides
[1:12:44] this is this is something that on the
[1:12:46] top of this mountain this revelation
[1:12:48] comes forth and he says you are this is
[1:12:50] jehovah jobber the lord who sees and
[1:12:53] provides
[1:12:54] and it's the first
[1:12:56] explicit reference to a redemptive name
[1:12:58] of jehovah
[1:13:00] jehovah jireh
[1:13:01] we're all familiar i trust that we're
[1:13:03] all familiar with the seven redemptive
[1:13:05] names of jehovah
[1:13:06] jehovah jehovah rapha jehovah sid can
[1:13:09] you jehovah nisi jehovah shalom jehovah
[1:13:12] sharma jehovah
[1:13:14] these are the seven redemptive names of
[1:13:15] jehovah
[1:13:17] and god expresses this and this
[1:13:19] revelation on top of the mountain you're
[1:13:20] jehovah jireh this is something that's
[1:13:22] in the name
[1:13:24] brother ram says in the message jehovah
[1:13:25] jiber now abraham the promise was given
[1:13:27] to him and it's a glorious promise hear
[1:13:30] this old man and his son going up the
[1:13:31] mountain to offer up the sun a very
[1:13:33] beautiful picture of christ the whole
[1:13:35] bible pictures christ and as they went
[1:13:38] up the hill we find out that god
[1:13:41] appeared to abraham there in the name of
[1:13:43] jehovah jireh
[1:13:45] god has seven compound redemptive names
[1:13:49] those redemptive names are inseparable
[1:13:52] you can't separate one from the other
[1:13:56] so when jehovah jireh is revealed to
[1:13:59] abraham
[1:14:01] it's still jehovah nissi
[1:14:03] it's still jehovah it they're it's still
[1:14:05] the same they're inseparable so though
[1:14:08] there's maybe this dominant
[1:14:10] characteristic that comes forward that
[1:14:11] expresses something about jehovah in his
[1:14:13] redemptive name these names are
[1:14:15] inseparable
[1:14:16] but watch what brother branham also says
[1:14:18] he says abraham said in my redeemer
[1:14:21] liveth i've had the same kind of vision
[1:14:22] whereup yonder on the mountain with
[1:14:24] christ god met me and give me his
[1:14:27] redemptive names as jehovah jireh
[1:14:29] jehovah raphain and all those seeing the
[1:14:31] death burial and resurrection
[1:14:34] you'll find in different places where
[1:14:35] god brother brahm speaks about how that
[1:14:37] god was giving abraham a vision of the
[1:14:38] whole thing
[1:14:40] justification sanctification baptism of
[1:14:42] the holy ghost death burial resurrection
[1:14:44] all these redemptive names he says he
[1:14:46] give me his redemptive names
[1:14:49] then in the message abraham he says in
[1:14:50] the book of genesis god gave or appeared
[1:14:52] to abraham in seven compound redemptive
[1:14:56] names
[1:15:00] the
[1:15:02] point
[1:15:03] i'd like to take from this
[1:15:06] is that abraham in abraham's life
[1:15:09] all seven redemptive names are revealed
[1:15:11] this is the character jehovah the old is
[1:15:13] jesus of the new but there's this
[1:15:14] character that's being revealed to
[1:15:16] abraham jehovah oh my shepherd what did
[1:15:18] he do he led god led him he says i'm the
[1:15:20] one that led you i shepherded you
[1:15:23] out of ur the chaldees jehovah rapha the
[1:15:26] lord is my healer what did he do he
[1:15:28] healed his body this one brother bam
[1:15:29] often refers to he healed his body he
[1:15:32] healed a dead body he healed the dead
[1:15:34] womb
[1:15:35] in genesis 14 18 melchizedek king of
[1:15:37] salem the supreme god salem was
[1:15:40] salome it's peace
[1:15:42] jehovah in my is my peace he's the king
[1:15:44] of saiyan he met him in genesis 14. as
[1:15:46] jehovah
[1:15:48] shalom
[1:15:49] genesis 15 1 i am thy shield by covering
[1:15:52] thy refuge it's jehovah nessie
[1:15:54] genesis 15 6 he said it counted to him
[1:15:57] for righteousness jehovah is my
[1:15:59] righteousness said can you here's god in
[1:16:01] these different places these these
[1:16:03] attributes of jehovah being expressed to
[1:16:06] abraham
[1:16:09] genesis 17 1 and when abram was 90 years
[1:16:11] old and nine the lord appeared jehovah
[1:16:13] appeared to have made himself known
[1:16:16] allowed abram to see him
[1:16:19] and said unto him i am the almighty god
[1:16:23] i'm the el shaddai
[1:16:25] the almighty god
[1:16:27] he identifies himself as a strength
[1:16:29] giver he's identifying himself this is a
[1:16:31] characteristic of god i'm the one who
[1:16:33] nourishes this is something intimate i
[1:16:35] am the almighty god walk before me and
[1:16:39] be thou perfect
[1:16:41] jehovah shama
[1:16:43] the lord is present with me
[1:16:45] i'm el shaddai but walk before me
[1:16:48] i'm present every single redemptive name
[1:16:51] is being revealed to abraham
[1:16:53] the character of god is being expressed
[1:16:55] to abraham
[1:16:56] jehovah jehovah nessie jehovah rapha
[1:16:59] jehovah shalom jehovah shaman jehovah
[1:17:01] said can you all these these uh jehovah
[1:17:04] jireh the most the beginning of these
[1:17:06] things that the name comes forth in
[1:17:07] chapter 22 this is god making himself
[1:17:10] known to abraham
[1:17:12] because the story of abraham reveals to
[1:17:14] us more about the character of god
[1:17:16] than it does about abraham
[1:17:19] in exodus 6 3 and i appeared unto
[1:17:20] abraham unto isaac and unto jacob by the
[1:17:23] name of god god almighty
[1:17:25] but by my name jehovah was i not known
[1:17:28] to them
[1:17:29] this is a pretty interesting scripture
[1:17:31] isn't it
[1:17:32] very profound there's many that wrestle
[1:17:34] with this and it creates maybe
[1:17:36] certain problems and and paradoxes that
[1:17:38] men try to wrestle with and figure out
[1:17:40] that perhaps it's moses that goes in
[1:17:42] later and puts lord god into these key
[1:17:44] phrases
[1:17:45] to describe the one that was doing these
[1:17:47] things so it's backwards looking seeing
[1:17:49] this jehovah
[1:17:51] but we see that it's abram who's the
[1:17:53] almighty god makes himself known it's he
[1:17:56] calls upon the name of the lord there's
[1:17:58] this relationship that begins to develop
[1:18:01] and when you see this
[1:18:02] when god says i appeared unto abraham
[1:18:04] isaac and jacob by the name god almighty
[1:18:07] el shaddai i appeared unto them he says
[1:18:08] but by my name jehovah was i not known
[1:18:10] to them he's saying in this character i
[1:18:14] made a covenant with abraham
[1:18:16] in this character
[1:18:18] and in this representation i made him
[1:18:20] promises
[1:18:22] and i'm just going to look at this very
[1:18:23] narrow way that we can look at this
[1:18:24] scripture but those promises did not
[1:18:27] just pertain to abraham isaac and jacob
[1:18:30] but it pertained to future generations
[1:18:32] so they were not fully revealed and
[1:18:34] fulfilled to your fathers alone but he's
[1:18:37] saying but now as jehovah the same
[1:18:40] almighty god that appeared to abraham
[1:18:43] the same lord god that was revealed to
[1:18:45] abraham i will bring into existence all
[1:18:48] those things i said i would do to
[1:18:50] abraham
[1:18:52] abraham did not walk fully in the
[1:18:54] promise abraham did not receive
[1:18:56] everything that i spoke of him but when
[1:18:58] i came to him i told him that his seed
[1:19:00] would sojourn in a strange land for 400
[1:19:02] years and i would bring them out and
[1:19:04] they would come back to this land he's
[1:19:06] saying now i'm going to appear to you
[1:19:09] even in a way that is greater than even
[1:19:11] abraham would have experienced it
[1:19:13] greater than what isaac experienced
[1:19:14] greater than what jacob experienced i
[1:19:17] now as jehovah will fulfill the promise
[1:19:20] that i made to abraham
[1:19:23] and whatever character i was expressing
[1:19:24] to abraham it'll be made perfect in the
[1:19:26] way that i express myself to you and you
[1:19:28] begin to recognize what he's saying to
[1:19:30] israel you realize he's speaking
[1:19:32] something to us as the royal seed of
[1:19:33] abraham whatever these redemptive names
[1:19:35] meant to abraham whatever these
[1:19:37] redemptive names meant to israel
[1:19:39] whatever these redemptive names have
[1:19:40] meant to the church through jesus christ
[1:19:42] it is through christ that in this end
[1:19:44] time he is going to reveal himself as
[1:19:47] jehovah and fulfill the promise he made
[1:19:50] to abraham's seed
[1:19:56] because this revelation of god to
[1:19:57] abraham
[1:19:59] was a revelation of jehovah and these
[1:20:01] seven redemptive names they're expressed
[1:20:02] can you see it in the life of abraham
[1:20:05] all these aspects and characteristics of
[1:20:07] god are being revealed not just
[1:20:09] abraham's character
[1:20:12] as i said earlier abraham was learning
[1:20:14] about himself
[1:20:16] but more important he was learning about
[1:20:18] god
[1:20:21] god had to this is something i've
[1:20:23] pondered through these several weeks
[1:20:27] god had to enter into a relationship
[1:20:29] with abraham in order to reveal his
[1:20:30] character
[1:20:32] we see god at
[1:20:34] on a particular level
[1:20:36] we can see him in this very intimate
[1:20:38] setting in the garden but that's lost
[1:20:41] and whatever that was is broken and man
[1:20:43] is is barred from it so in genesis 4 on
[1:20:46] through these seven chapters to chapter
[1:20:47] 11 we see god with this unique
[1:20:49] relationship with mankind and it's
[1:20:52] really just one particular view of god
[1:20:54] and if that if that view of god ever is
[1:20:56] going to change god's going to have to
[1:20:58] be build a relationship again with man
[1:21:01] so god had to enter into relationship
[1:21:03] with man in order to reveal himself
[1:21:06] he's not just a god that he wants us to
[1:21:08] be afraid of we need to respect him and
[1:21:10] reverence him but it has to be because
[1:21:12] of his character
[1:21:14] it has to be something about him that we
[1:21:16] know he that believeth he that cometh
[1:21:18] god must believe that he is and he's a
[1:21:21] rewarder there has to be some
[1:21:22] understanding of his nature and his
[1:21:23] character so god had to establish
[1:21:25] relationship in order to build trust
[1:21:27] based upon truth
[1:21:29] in the church age book god being a
[1:21:31] savior it was necessary that he
[1:21:33] predestinated a man who would require
[1:21:34] salvation in order to give himself
[1:21:36] reason and purpose of being
[1:21:39] this was necessary
[1:21:40] that god predestined a man that would
[1:21:42] require salvation
[1:21:44] we could even say this abram was that
[1:21:46] man
[1:21:48] he's in the fire of babylon he is that
[1:21:51] man that needs salvation
[1:21:54] so when god begins to establish
[1:21:55] relationship with abram it's not so much
[1:21:58] about the god of abraham as much as the
[1:22:01] abraham of the most high god this is
[1:22:02] something where both are being expressed
[1:22:05] to say something about god's character
[1:22:07] so he says thus what god worked out here
[1:22:09] in the garden was his predestinated plan
[1:22:12] and when satan had brought about that
[1:22:13] which was necessary to the purpose of
[1:22:15] god
[1:22:16] satan brought about that which was
[1:22:18] necessary to the purpose of god
[1:22:22] god it would required
[1:22:24] a man that needed salvation to give god
[1:22:27] purpose and reason of being
[1:22:29] remember exactly almost exactly a year
[1:22:31] ago i believe
[1:22:33] that we were expressing in the beginning
[1:22:36] when mankind fell
[1:22:38] and that had mankind never left the
[1:22:40] garden we would have never known who god
[1:22:41] was
[1:22:44] i mean yeah you could have this all
[1:22:45] everything's perfect but there's so many
[1:22:47] things more about god adam's never sick
[1:22:48] but god's a healer you'll never know it
[1:22:52] adam never gets in trouble but god's a
[1:22:54] deliverer and you'll never know it
[1:22:56] there's so much more to god that he
[1:22:58] wanted to express and he wanted to make
[1:23:00] known so it required this fall
[1:23:02] and so when we see that it says there
[1:23:04] had to be salvation had to be required a
[1:23:06] man needed to be saved in order to god
[1:23:08] have to reason and purpose of being and
[1:23:10] the fall worked out that which was
[1:23:11] necessary for the purpose of god when
[1:23:13] adam fell when god began to make the
[1:23:15] last adam who did he begin with
[1:23:18] abraham and he's the beginning of faith
[1:23:23] as i close
[1:23:26] so then abraham's testings and i would
[1:23:28] want to just look at the the story and
[1:23:30] life of abraham and you have to just do
[1:23:32] this on your own and make connection to
[1:23:34] the whether the barrenness or the wars
[1:23:36] and the strife and everything that he
[1:23:38] went through abraham's testings his
[1:23:40] trials his conditions of his body his
[1:23:43] wife's body the circumstances he found
[1:23:44] himself in
[1:23:46] these are not just things that abraham
[1:23:48] got himself into
[1:23:51] and
[1:23:52] and character development for abraham
[1:23:54] but it was opportunities for god
[1:23:57] it was an opportunity for god to make
[1:23:59] himself known
[1:24:01] in john chapter 9 verses 1 to 3 and as
[1:24:03] jesus passed by he saw a man which was
[1:24:05] blind from his birth
[1:24:07] and the disciples asked him saying
[1:24:08] master who did sin this man or his
[1:24:11] parents
[1:24:12] that he was born blind intriguing
[1:24:14] question considering the man was blind
[1:24:15] from birth
[1:24:17] but he says who did send this man or his
[1:24:19] parents that he was born blind
[1:24:21] jesus answered neither hath this man
[1:24:24] sinned nor his parents
[1:24:26] but that the works of god should be made
[1:24:27] manifest in him could you take this as a
[1:24:30] comfort for you today so often we sit
[1:24:33] back trying to figure out that whether
[1:24:34] or not what i'm suffering today is
[1:24:36] because i sinned because i did this and
[1:24:37] because i did that you know regardless
[1:24:39] of whether or not you sinned or your
[1:24:40] parents sinned or somebody else's sin
[1:24:42] it's an opportunity for the works of god
[1:24:45] to be made manifest to you
[1:24:48] and whereas it could have been a
[1:24:49] perfectly wonderful opportunity to
[1:24:50] chastise somebody call out somebody's
[1:24:52] sin point out somebody's mistakes god
[1:24:54] jesus says it's not for that purpose but
[1:24:57] for that that the works of god should be
[1:24:59] made manifest in him
[1:25:02] so abraham's testimony whether it
[1:25:04] relates to struggles or trials or
[1:25:05] disappointments it was for the purpose
[1:25:07] of manifesting the work of god that when
[1:25:10] we look at abraham we're not just seeing
[1:25:12] faithful abraham we have to recognize
[1:25:14] the headship of a faithful god he was
[1:25:17] under that and that's what made him
[1:25:19] faithful
[1:25:21] and god realized i have to emphasize
[1:25:23] this very quickly in closing it was not
[1:25:26] just enough to tell them
[1:25:29] it wasn't enough for abraham just to
[1:25:31] hear hear the story
[1:25:34] or to hear somebody else's story
[1:25:36] well i'm going to have abraham born 50
[1:25:38] years earlier and he's going to sit at
[1:25:39] the feet of noah and noah's going to
[1:25:40] tell him all these things
[1:25:41] about about god
[1:25:44] he's going to he's going to hear it from
[1:25:45] shem
[1:25:46] just to tell him would not be enough
[1:25:49] so in abraham it's not just merely
[1:25:51] telling him and him hearing
[1:25:54] but he wanted him to experience it
[1:25:58] abraham was not just going to be one who
[1:26:00] would say well i was told of this god
[1:26:02] that did that and i was told this god
[1:26:03] that did that and god told me he would
[1:26:05] do this and god told me to do that but
[1:26:06] he'd be a god that he could experience
[1:26:10] god placed a strong arm around him
[1:26:13] and he brought him to supreme faith
[1:26:17] remember what how we go from faith to
[1:26:19] supreme faith
[1:26:21] daily acts of faith
[1:26:23] the routine
[1:26:25] this is what was happening in abraham's
[1:26:27] life daily experiences of god's nature
[1:26:29] his character
[1:26:31] through trial and victory he was
[1:26:33] learning about god
[1:26:35] and so his experiences
[1:26:38] took what he knew about god
[1:26:42] and it became it became deeper became
[1:26:46] richer
[1:26:47] because that's what god desired to do is
[1:26:49] to not merely just have a story about
[1:26:51] him but for mankind to experience him
[1:26:58] in the message of paradox
[1:27:02] brother mike if you could just make
[1:27:03] ready to come if you want to if you come
[1:27:04] if the lord put something on your heart
[1:27:05] to play just take that liberty
[1:27:10] just have a few scriptures i want to
[1:27:11] read in in closing
[1:27:14] um
[1:27:15] but this quote was the last statement
[1:27:16] i'd like to read he says the trouble of
[1:27:18] it is today the churches speak
[1:27:21] look like say what did moody say what
[1:27:24] did sankey say
[1:27:26] think about that
[1:27:28] speak and say what god said
[1:27:30] let's go forward not look back
[1:27:32] go this away it's hard on these turning
[1:27:35] corners
[1:27:36] brother brahms here in the message
[1:27:37] paradox he's causing his church to turn
[1:27:39] from laodicea pentecost wanting to turn
[1:27:42] the corner
[1:27:43] he said it's hard on turning these
[1:27:44] corners church don't want to believe
[1:27:46] that you see they're always referring
[1:27:48] back from where their educational
[1:27:50] standpoint
[1:27:51] because that's a school in itself
[1:27:53] they learn that through book learning
[1:27:57] we know that through experience of
[1:28:00] trusting god
[1:28:01] and knowing that he does that he does do
[1:28:04] this
[1:28:06] we should not merely just know
[1:28:08] through book experience or tape
[1:28:10] experience from hearing it on book and
[1:28:12] hear it on tape
[1:28:13] our
[1:28:14] our religion if you want to put it that
[1:28:16] way our faith should not just be well
[1:28:17] what did brother branham say
[1:28:20] but it has to be more than that
[1:28:25] i think this is relevant today
[1:28:28] that god wants his word he wants you to
[1:28:30] experience his word
[1:28:33] what his word said he wants you to
[1:28:35] experience it
[1:28:37] because you're learning about the
[1:28:39] character nature of god daily acts of
[1:28:41] faith where it just be the supernatural
[1:28:43] becomes so routine you can just trust
[1:28:45] him and move up to a higher level that's
[1:28:47] when you believe his word and then you
[1:28:49] experience his word
[1:28:53] this is what's expressed in abraham
[1:28:57] he said abraham
[1:28:59] i'm going to do this to you
[1:29:02] and then god gave abraham experiences
[1:29:05] that developed this faith and this trust
[1:29:09] the product of abraham's faith
[1:29:11] was the product of god nurturing him
[1:29:14] el shaddai is a product of god
[1:29:17] encouraging him don't be afraid abram a
[1:29:20] process of god
[1:29:22] molding him teaching him training him
[1:29:24] and abraham listening to him and he
[1:29:26] becomes abram
[1:29:28] the wanderer
[1:29:30] right
[1:29:31] the wandering syrian
[1:29:32] the hebrew
[1:29:34] and he becomes faithful abraham
[1:29:39] and in the seed of abraham
[1:29:42] it speaks of isaac and it says in
[1:29:44] genesis 26 24 and the lord appeared unto
[1:29:46] him
[1:29:47] the lord appeared unto isaac the same
[1:29:49] night and said i am the god of abraham
[1:29:51] thy father
[1:29:52] fear not
[1:29:53] for i am with thee
[1:29:55] see isaac could have lived with a
[1:29:58] relationship with god that was he
[1:30:00] appeared to my dad and he said to my dad
[1:30:02] don't be afraid
[1:30:04] so i am going to believe in the god who
[1:30:07] revealed himself to my dad and told him
[1:30:08] not to be afraid and by my dad's
[1:30:10] testimony i'm not going to be afraid and
[1:30:13] that was wonderful
[1:30:15] but god didn't want to leave isaac in
[1:30:17] the second hand condition where he's
[1:30:19] merely just believing in the god that
[1:30:20] revealed himself to his dad but he gives
[1:30:23] isaac the exact same experience and the
[1:30:25] same god appears to him and he says i am
[1:30:28] the god of abraham thy father and he
[1:30:30] says fear not just as he had said to his
[1:30:32] father he says for i am with thee
[1:30:34] jehovah's shema the lord is my prayer i
[1:30:37] am in the lord's presence i will bless
[1:30:39] thee and multiply thy seed from my
[1:30:41] servant abraham's sake
[1:30:43] so not only is he the god of abraham
[1:30:45] because he revealed himself to abraham
[1:30:47] he became the god of abraham he becomes
[1:30:49] the god of whomever he reveals himself
[1:30:51] to
[1:30:51] but now he's the god of isaac because
[1:30:53] he's made himself known to isaac but
[1:30:55] then isaac's going to have an heir and
[1:30:57] it's not going to be esau but it's going
[1:30:58] to be jacob so the two chapters later it
[1:31:01] says and behold chapter 28 verse 13 and
[1:31:03] behold the lord stood above it and said
[1:31:06] speak in the sound of jacob i am the
[1:31:07] lord god of abraham thy father and the
[1:31:10] god of isaac the land where on thou
[1:31:12] liest to thee will i give it and to thy
[1:31:15] seed
[1:31:17] and when jacob rehearses this to joseph
[1:31:19] he says god almighty appeared unto me
[1:31:22] god almighty
[1:31:24] the same one that appeared to abraham
[1:31:26] same one that appeared to isaac
[1:31:28] jacob could have been the one that says
[1:31:30] well he didn't just appear to my daddy
[1:31:32] but he appeared to my grandpa he
[1:31:33] appeared to abraham he appeared to isaac
[1:31:35] and he believed in the god that made
[1:31:36] himself known to abraham he believed in
[1:31:38] the god that made himself known to isaac
[1:31:40] and jacob would have had every reason to
[1:31:41] believe based upon their testimony and
[1:31:43] witness that what god told them would
[1:31:45] happen it was happening he could see the
[1:31:47] blessing he could believe the report he
[1:31:49] could have confidence in him but god was
[1:31:51] not happy just allowing jacob to go by
[1:31:53] the report of abraham and isaac he
[1:31:56] wanted to give him a similar experience
[1:31:57] so he also appears and the lord almighty
[1:32:01] appeared unto jacob and what does he do
[1:32:03] for him he changes his name too
[1:32:06] because jacob wasn't enough to describe
[1:32:08] the character that was being developed
[1:32:09] in him you were a deceiver you were a
[1:32:11] hill grabber but now you are a prince
[1:32:13] with god
[1:32:17] and then when god comes down to fulfill
[1:32:18] genesis 15
[1:32:20] that your people will be in a strange
[1:32:21] land for 400 years
[1:32:23] this revelation given to abraham
[1:32:26] when he comes down he says in exodus 3 6
[1:32:29] i am the god of thy father
[1:32:32] the god of abraham
[1:32:33] the god of isaac
[1:32:35] and the god of jacob
[1:32:38] that remarkable
[1:32:40] god's not afraid to identify himself
[1:32:42] with these men
[1:32:44] i am the god of abraham because i
[1:32:46] revealed myself to him
[1:32:47] i am the god of isaac because i revealed
[1:32:49] myself to him i am the god of jacob
[1:32:51] because i revealed myself to him and
[1:32:53] what i did for my fathers i'm going to
[1:32:56] do for you
[1:32:58] why because when i was telling
[1:33:01] their story
[1:33:03] the god of abraham the god of isaac and
[1:33:05] the god of jacob when their stories when
[1:33:07] their testimonies when their experience
[1:33:10] and their history was being told it
[1:33:12] wasn't just history but it was his story
[1:33:15] god was declaring and revealing
[1:33:17] something about himself so he said the
[1:33:19] god of abraham he doesn't want you to
[1:33:21] think about abraham he wants you to
[1:33:23] think about the god when he says the god
[1:33:24] of isaac he doesn't want you to think
[1:33:26] about isaac he wants you to think about
[1:33:27] god when he says the god of jacob he
[1:33:29] doesn't want you to think about jacob he
[1:33:30] wants you to think about the god it's
[1:33:32] god that's revealing himself and that's
[1:33:35] the same god that's been revealed to us
[1:33:37] today we're not worshiping the god of a
[1:33:39] man we have been brought into fellowship
[1:33:41] with the god
[1:33:45] and to think that
[1:33:47] his story is my story
[1:33:51] and what he speaks to us
[1:33:53] and what we ought to take great comfort
[1:33:54] in is what was betrayed portrayed and
[1:33:56] revealed in the character of abraham the
[1:33:58] life of abraham he is revealing to us
[1:34:01] i will take you out of the fire
[1:34:04] i will keep you in bareness
[1:34:06] i will rescue you from family strife i
[1:34:08] will protect you when things get
[1:34:10] difficult i will preserve you in famine
[1:34:12] i will i will do these things for you we
[1:34:15] are not in the basis of adam we are not
[1:34:18] in the basis of cain we are not in the
[1:34:19] basis of noah we are not on the basis of
[1:34:22] nimrod we are not on the basis of lot we
[1:34:24] are not on the basis of ishmael we are
[1:34:26] on the same basis that abraham was
[1:34:28] placed with god
[1:34:30] so i express it in this way this has
[1:34:32] been an underlying burden upon my heart
[1:34:34] let's learn to trust him
[1:34:38] oh to absolutely trust him there's a
[1:34:40] song tis so sweet to trust in jesus that
[1:34:44] ought to be a refrain that we just
[1:34:46] anchor in our hearts that we recognize
[1:34:48] that what i'm going through today if we
[1:34:50] could just turn everything around invert
[1:34:52] always invert you look back on your past
[1:34:55] terrible hurtful awful things things
[1:34:58] we're ashamed of things that brought us
[1:35:00] to our brought us to our very end we
[1:35:02] despaired of life through all of it god
[1:35:05] is wanting to teach us to trust
[1:35:09] in every single instance
[1:35:11] god is teaching us in those things to
[1:35:13] trust
[1:35:15] and he said oh no here i come again
[1:35:17] here it comes again
[1:35:19] he's giving you an opportunity to
[1:35:21] demonstrate trustworthiness
[1:35:24] he's given you an opportunity to
[1:35:26] demonstrate faithfulness
[1:35:30] if i could say this way in those
[1:35:32] situations
[1:35:34] what did he prove himself to be
[1:35:36] faithful
[1:35:39] so god was proving
[1:35:41] you could trust him
[1:35:43] then when we come into another trial
[1:35:47] it's just god given us an opportunity to
[1:35:50] trust
[1:35:51] [Music]
[1:35:52] after the victory in the battle of the
[1:35:54] kings melchizedek served in bread and
[1:35:56] wine
[1:35:57] and it's it's it seems after the battle
[1:35:59] after the conflict the type of the
[1:36:02] marriage supper the wedding supper in
[1:36:04] the sky
[1:36:06] here comes the king of sodom
[1:36:08] testing abraham and he had learned to
[1:36:11] trust
[1:36:13] and he said i lift my hand to the
[1:36:14] supreme
[1:36:16] and whose wing
[1:36:17] i've come to trust
[1:36:19] could we stand together today
[1:36:28] [Music]
[1:36:31] with our heads bowed i'd like to pray
[1:36:33] with you
[1:36:36] i pray for you
[1:36:39] is any particular need that you may have
[1:36:41] on your heart
[1:36:43] if you could examine it through
[1:36:45] the context of what we've talked about
[1:36:47] today
[1:36:48] [Music]
[1:36:52] and how
[1:36:54] in everything that abraham went through
[1:36:57] abraham survives as
[1:36:59] faithful abraham
[1:37:01] [Music]
[1:37:04] but it was the product of serving a
[1:37:05] faithful god
[1:37:08] so whatever it is you're going through
[1:37:09] today
[1:37:11] if you could ask god to help you to
[1:37:13] relate to it in the context of him
[1:37:15] making himself known to you
[1:37:18] what you can learn about him what he's
[1:37:20] trying to show you about himself
[1:37:24] then you'll learn to trust him
[1:37:28] our gracious heavenly father today as we
[1:37:30] close our service
[1:37:33] our minds and our thoughts are
[1:37:34] completely upon you lord
[1:37:38] and it's
[1:37:40] sentiments that were expressed in this
[1:37:42] service lord even as i call back
[1:37:45] for people to remember what they've been
[1:37:46] through what they've gone through what
[1:37:48] they've suffered what they've
[1:37:49] experienced
[1:37:55] it is
[1:38:00] it is moments like this that we begin to
[1:38:02] ponder these things and wrestle with
[1:38:04] them
[1:38:05] [Music]
[1:38:08] and it is those times lord when we want
[1:38:10] to know that it was you
[1:38:14] [Music]
[1:38:15] and to not only know that it was you but
[1:38:17] to see what part of you what redemptive
[1:38:19] name what characteristic what attribute
[1:38:21] was being expressed to us
[1:38:23] what is it you wanted me to learn what
[1:38:25] is it that i need to take away from this
[1:38:29] [Music]
[1:38:35] as we're confronted with challenges as
[1:38:37] we're faced
[1:38:39] with decisions
[1:38:42] we want to feel your presence lord
[1:38:45] and this would be my prayer for everyone
[1:38:46] that is here today
[1:38:51] may we have an experience with you lord
[1:38:54] [Music]
[1:38:56] according to your word
[1:38:59] we're not asking father that we just
[1:39:00] have an experience and that we make
[1:39:03] experience our measuring stick but lord
[1:39:05] we want to have an experience according
[1:39:08] to what you've promised
[1:39:10] now lord that that applies to every
[1:39:13] promise you have made us
[1:39:16] there are those who are hearing this
[1:39:18] sermon right now
[1:39:19] who believe you are a healer
[1:39:22] and who need to experience you as a
[1:39:24] healer
[1:39:26] there are those who've experienced you
[1:39:29] very near in life and leading them and
[1:39:31] guiding them and
[1:39:33] perhaps they've experienced a confession
[1:39:36] of justification and some measure of
[1:39:37] sanctification but lord what they really
[1:39:40] need is a genuine experience of the new
[1:39:42] birth
[1:39:44] where their soul and you lock together
[1:39:46] and they become new creatures in christ
[1:39:48] jesus
[1:39:50] lord with abraham you gave him your word
[1:39:52] but it was not just a story
[1:39:56] but you gave him an experience with you
[1:39:59] an experience with your word
[1:40:02] that would be my prayer for us as the
[1:40:03] royal seat of abraham that we likewise
[1:40:05] could experience your presence
[1:40:08] experience your word
[1:40:09] [Music]
[1:40:11] lord i pray that this would be the
[1:40:12] thought that could be sealed in our
[1:40:13] hearts
[1:40:15] that the story of abraham is revealing
[1:40:17] to us your character and your nature
[1:40:20] lord we want to know more about you
[1:40:23] we want to learn more about you
[1:40:27] we commit the people to you today pray
[1:40:28] that you bless
[1:40:30] their hearts and encourage them and
[1:40:31] strengthen them
[1:40:32] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:40:35] amen
[1:40:36] [Music]
