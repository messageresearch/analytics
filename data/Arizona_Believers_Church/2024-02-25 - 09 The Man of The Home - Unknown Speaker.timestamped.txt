[0:00] trust that the Lord will bless those
[0:02] things which we have read and be able to
[0:04] bring something out of it that's a
[0:06] benefit to all of us as you all know the
[0:09] home folk know we've been on the series
[0:10] on the house of the Lord there's a lot
[0:12] of ways that we could address this
[0:14] particular subject the house of the Lord
[0:16] was um when we was established as a
[0:19] Tabernacle in the wilderness we know it
[0:21] represented things it's even made after
[0:23] a pattern in heaven and those things
[0:25] that are in heaven God is wanting to
[0:26] manifest and declare on Earth we even
[0:28] know that eventually the king is going
[0:30] to be a union an eternal Union Between
[0:32] Heaven and Earth so there's a lot of
[0:34] things that are represented in the
[0:35] temple or the Tabernacle and then we
[0:37] come to the New Testament we recognize
[0:39] that the church is the house of God the
[0:41] body of Christ we are the Temple of the
[0:44] Lord and today I want to use the subject
[0:47] of the man of the home and we'll come to
[0:50] that here for in just a moment but
[0:51] Wednesday night we spoke on as for me in
[0:54] my house and we were wanting to make the
[0:57] point that the most important place that
[0:59] the word can be be expressed is in the
[1:01] family in the beginning God created a
[1:03] family not a church and he wasn't just
[1:05] creating a world he wasn't wanting just
[1:06] to create a beautiful garden but the
[1:09] image that he was wanting to express was
[1:10] himself and to do that he created a
[1:12] family and so we know that the family
[1:14] unit was God's first Masterpiece and so
[1:17] the greatest place that we could express
[1:19] the word is in the home and in our
[1:21] relationships one to another and there's
[1:23] a there's a lot of expansion to that if
[1:26] we look at the example of Jesus Christ
[1:28] in Luke Chapter 2 we find him as a
[1:30] 12-year-old boy and he's in the temple
[1:33] confounding the scribes and Pharisees
[1:35] and yet he's kind of separated from his
[1:37] family and his mom and dad as they
[1:39] called themselves uh sought him they
[1:41] finally find him in the temple and and
[1:43] the kind of the question is you know
[1:45] what have you done and you've you've
[1:47] left your father and mother we've been
[1:48] seeking you these many days and his
[1:50] response may seem to be somewhat smart
[1:52] alec but he says you know what do you
[1:55] mean you were looking for me I must be
[1:57] about my father's business I say oh well
[1:59] this is is uh this is what it means to
[2:01] be Christlike is to have this obstinate
[2:05] uh uh dedication to God even if it means
[2:08] it's disrespect to everyone else and
[2:10] there's a lot you might try to draw from
[2:11] that but in the very next verses it says
[2:13] in Luke 2: 51 and 52 he went down with
[2:17] them this is Jesus with Joseph and Mary
[2:20] and came to Nazareth and was subject
[2:22] unto them and the Bible says but his
[2:25] mother kept all these sayings in her
[2:27] heart so the Bible is uh whatever you'd
[2:30] want to draw from that interaction in
[2:32] the temple that day it's not to set
[2:34] forth some pattern where you can just be
[2:36] a rogue you can be on your own you could
[2:38] be a Maverick even Jesus who had a
[2:40] wisdom that could confound the scribes
[2:42] and Pharisees at 12 years old went back
[2:45] with his parents he went down with them
[2:48] to Nazareth and it says he was subject
[2:51] unto them that means he was arranged in
[2:53] an orderly fashion under father and
[2:55] mother the Bible even saying his mother
[2:57] kept all these says in our heart so
[3:00] though she wasn't his natural mother and
[3:02] we know that Jesus wasn't born of the
[3:04] woman in the way that he had her DNA or
[3:07] her genes were used to create him but
[3:09] yet he's arranged under her and her as
[3:12] uh his mother Joseph as his father
[3:15] aranged in an orderly fashion under
[3:18] Authority and that's how a home should
[3:20] be Christ is going to represent and
[3:22] express God's desire and God's pattern
[3:26] and it says in Jesus increased in wisdom
[3:28] and stature in favor with God and man
[3:32] why you say well maybe that's a big
[3:34] question why and it's worthy of a lot of
[3:36] discussion but we recognize that God
[3:39] says he's subject unto them under her
[3:41] father and mother and now his very next
[3:43] testimony is he increases his wisdom
[3:45] stature and favor with God and man so we
[3:48] could say that Arrangement was part of
[3:51] his increase in wisdom it was part of
[3:53] his increase in favor with God and
[3:57] man amen all right good okay just
[3:59] checking if the a manner was
[4:02] working you you I know you were just
[4:04] waiting for an even more profound point
[4:07] after that you said we'll save our amen
[4:08] for the next
[4:10] statement now it we read this in on
[4:13] Wednesday night does God ever change his
[4:15] mind and this is such an outstanding
[4:17] statement he's praying dear Lord Jesus
[4:19] we are assembled again in your name with
[4:22] great expectation for the outpouring of
[4:24] the quickening power of God now if we
[4:27] were to use that phrase and we were to
[4:29] ask what would this look like and what's
[4:30] the mo the greatest manifestation of the
[4:33] outpouring of the power of God that we
[4:35] could see uh in our midst or amongst the
[4:37] people there's a lot of things that we
[4:39] might want to look at visually there
[4:41] might be a lot of things we would expect
[4:42] to happen in a church service it may be
[4:44] dancing or shouting it could be people
[4:46] slain in the spirit uh maybe speaking in
[4:48] tongues or just uh uh some crying and
[4:51] just a release of our emotions it could
[4:53] even be a prayer line or an altar call
[4:55] there might be a lot of ways that the
[4:56] spirit can be outpoured but brother man
[4:59] makes an incredible statement here he
[5:00] says I want to have the outpouring of
[5:02] the quickening power of God which can
[5:04] happen in all those ways to bring us
[5:07] into recognition of our position in
[5:09] place and our
[5:12] responsibilities so this this is
[5:14] something that is as he's saying this
[5:17] now at the end of his ministry that last
[5:19] summer of his ministry and he's saiding
[5:21] I want uh we desire an outpour to the
[5:23] quickening power of God but not just for
[5:25] the moment in a church service but to
[5:27] bring us into a realization recognition
[5:30] of our position and place and our
[5:34] responsibilities and it's the place
[5:36] position and responsibilities of being a
[5:38] called people separated from the world
[5:40] and dedicated to God so we might know
[5:42] that we are a called people we might
[5:44] know that we are separated from the
[5:46] world and we may be dedicated to God but
[5:48] he's saying being those three things a
[5:51] called people separated from the world
[5:52] dedicated to God we need a revelation of
[5:56] our position we need to better
[5:58] understand our place and our
[6:00] responsibilities we've accepted that
[6:02] we're called people we accept that we're
[6:04] separated we accept and we are dedicated
[6:06] we're constantly seeking a greater
[6:08] dedication but he says we bring us into
[6:10] a recognition of our position and I
[6:12] would say that's a prayer that we ought
[6:14] to have for ourselves it ought be a
[6:15] prayer we have for our children it's a
[6:17] prayer that we have together as a church
[6:19] bring us to a revelation and recognition
[6:22] of our place and position that's right
[6:24] and I believe that we all have uh we
[6:26] have a post of Duty and we may use the
[6:29] the comment post of Duty more most
[6:31] frequently in settings like this and we
[6:33] say well I've got a post of Duty and so
[6:35] I want to be at church at my home church
[6:37] on Sunday morning and brother brandham
[6:39] gave a lot of respect and honor to that
[6:41] post of Duty when he would hold meetings
[6:43] in certain areas he'd have Sunday
[6:45] afternoon services so that people could
[6:47] be at the post of Duty in their morning
[6:48] or evening service and so we recognize
[6:51] it has something to do at times with the
[6:53] house of God but you also have a post of
[6:55] Duty as a man as a woman as a child in
[6:58] the word of God we all have post and we
[7:01] have a duty to home we have duties and
[7:04] responsibilities to one another we have
[7:06] a duty to keep order we have a duty to
[7:08] uh cultivate the right kind of Integrity
[7:11] so that we can produce character in our
[7:13] character can be produced in our lives
[7:15] so we need to honor we're this is just
[7:17] some review from Wednesday night we need
[7:18] to honor that post of Duty in the family
[7:20] and in the home and as we've been
[7:22] drawing from uh inspiration in Mark 3:25
[7:26] and if a house be divided against itself
[7:29] that house cannot stand brother brandham
[7:31] said it's the order the character of the
[7:34] family that makes a house a home so a a
[7:38] house out of order is A House
[7:40] Divided so if you're your if your house
[7:42] is like the ice cream machine in
[7:44] McDonald's it's always out of order then
[7:46] you're A House Divided amen you're a
[7:49] Ronald McDonald House that a house out
[7:51] of order is A House Divided a house
[7:54] incorrectly rearranged I say rearranged
[7:57] because it can be incorrectly arranged a
[7:59] and and that's that's a disorder that
[8:01] God wants to bring order but I believe
[8:03] for most of us God orders our homes but
[8:06] then it can get rearranged a little bit
[8:08] too easily and sometimes we just get
[8:10] these fresh Inspirations I don't know if
[8:12] you like this still like this but I
[8:14] remember as a teenager especially uh
[8:16] there' just be these times you get this
[8:18] inspiration you completely rearrange
[8:19] your room and you'd spend all night to
[8:21] the early morning hours figuring out
[8:22] just the right place to put the bed and
[8:24] move everything around a a and it was
[8:26] always it was always nice to rearrange
[8:28] things it felt like you had a new room
[8:30] and sometimes I think we like to go to
[8:32] tinkering with God's Arrangement or we
[8:34] let the devil come in and rearrange our
[8:36] rooms and rearrange our homes and it's
[8:38] incorrectly rearranged and if that
[8:40] happens it's the wrong kind of order and
[8:43] our emphasis is That's A House Divided
[8:46] and you say well we're not fighting
[8:47] against each other and uh this isn't
[8:49] happening and we don't hate each other
[8:51] we're not cursing each other out and
[8:52] things like that but the house
[8:54] incorrectly arranged or rearranged if
[8:57] there's anybody that's out of their
[8:58] place that's A house divided against
[9:00] itself because pieces that ought to be
[9:02] working in harmony will be out of
[9:04] Harmony and be button against each other
[9:06] or overlapping in ways that they
[9:07] shouldn't I I think that that I think
[9:10] that that makes a lot of sense
[9:12] scripturally but I hope that makes sense
[9:13] to you
[9:14] literally now on the subject of and the
[9:17] title today the man of the home as
[9:20] brother Ram says it's important for us
[9:21] to come to a recognition of our position
[9:23] in place and our responsibilities as
[9:26] being called I could say that we to look
[9:29] at what it means to be a man in his
[9:31] place and how that there are certain
[9:33] roles and responsibilities that a man
[9:34] has to the family and now having said
[9:38] that there might be most of you that
[9:39] just kind of checks out you're like well
[9:41] I'm not I'm not a man today so I don't
[9:43] need to hear this and I would argue that
[9:46] it's applicable and relevant to all of
[9:48] us if you're a daughter in a family uh
[9:51] to understand better the roles and
[9:53] responsibilities of a man will help you
[9:55] in your role as a daughter and it'll
[9:58] help you to understand better what to
[9:59] look for when you when it's coming to
[10:01] that time of of marriage and maybe
[10:03] attraction you want to know what a real
[10:05] man looks like you want to know uh what
[10:08] God calls a man to be and so when we use
[10:10] that phrase man uh there might be a lot
[10:12] of things we think masculinity or
[10:14] manliness there might be a lot of images
[10:16] that we get in our minds but I believe
[10:18] the nominal Christian idea of
[10:20] masculinity is so far from the
[10:22] scriptural masculinity I think I've uh
[10:25] I've used uh preached on it before how
[10:27] it seems as if there's more people today
[10:29] want a Jesus that's like John Wayne
[10:32] instead of a Jesus that was who he was
[10:34] in the scripture and so there's a wrong
[10:37] kind of image we could have about Christ
[10:39] or what it means to be a man but what we
[10:41] want to understand is they the
[10:42] scriptural man the man Christ Jesus and
[10:45] so when we're using this phrase very
[10:47] deliberately the man of the home and I
[10:49] hope that that'll make more sense as we
[10:51] continue all right we ready to go to the
[10:53] next step amen okay good Esther chapter
[10:55] 1 as we already read in the first few
[10:57] verses and we read it just to kind of
[10:59] set the scene uh the King has
[11:02] ordered hos has ordered a uh a feast
[11:06] it's continued on for many many days
[11:08] he's a very powerful man he's having all
[11:11] the most important people in the Kingdom
[11:12] at this Feast he's been drinking a a and
[11:15] when he's married and having a good time
[11:18] this is where we're kind of joining here
[11:20] in verse 9 and also vasy the queen Made
[11:22] A Feast for the women in the Royal house
[11:25] which belonged to King
[11:27] araras and now Vash
[11:29] the word means beautiful and we'll touch
[11:32] on this maybe in a few moments that I
[11:34] want you to see her as a type of good
[11:37] brother talks about a beautiful woman
[11:39] representing Leo DEA and I want you to
[11:41] kind of see this type of Leo DEA which
[11:43] rejects Christ and so it says on the
[11:45] seventh day the King when he had been
[11:47] drinking and been making merry he
[11:49] ordered we'll go to verse 11 that they
[11:51] bring vashy the king queen before the
[11:54] king with the Crown Royal to show the
[11:56] people and the princess her beauty for
[11:58] she was fair to look on so you can kind
[12:00] of get the vibe a little bit the king's
[12:02] been partying for a long time it's just
[12:04] been him and his buddies they've been uh
[12:06] uh and maybe I think even in Jewish
[12:08] tradition they believe that there was an
[12:09] argument about who was had the most
[12:11] beautiful wife or which kingdom had the
[12:12] most beautiful women and he says I'm
[12:15] going to settle this right now I'm going
[12:17] to have my wife come forth and and
[12:19] you're going to see her beauty and
[12:21] you're going to know that she's the most
[12:22] beautiful so kind of in this not
[12:25] necessarily climactic but in this very
[12:27] uh seventh this of this Feast this
[12:30] particular time his heart is so merry he
[12:33] wants to bring his wife forward but it
[12:34] says in verse 12 but the queen Vash
[12:37] refused to come at the King's Command by
[12:39] his chamberlains therefore was the king
[12:42] very wroth and his anger burned in him
[12:46] so what we could see and just distill
[12:48] down in very general terms is the queen
[12:50] which is wife to the King has refused
[12:53] her husband's command in this moment
[12:55] that he desires her this moment that he
[12:57] wants to see her she said says no I'm
[12:59] going to hang out with the ladies in
[13:02] your house and it's important to
[13:04] recognize that this house is the King's
[13:07] house and it's a house that belonged to
[13:10] King araras and that this is uh would
[13:13] have been his home and his house and it
[13:15] would have been his right and she's
[13:17] there uh with the ladies having a party
[13:19] and he says it's I want you to come to
[13:21] the banquet I want you to come and make
[13:23] yourself uh known and she refuses that
[13:27] now if we're going to be honest with the
[13:29] text we could I think we could draw some
[13:31] conclusions that the king may have been
[13:33] a little bit irrational in that moment
[13:35] he has been drinking he's on a bender
[13:37] right I mean this guy's been drinking
[13:39] for a long time the Bible even tells us
[13:41] that the heart of the King was merry
[13:43] with wine let's just say he's
[13:45] drunk right he's feeling the he's fing
[13:48] the liquor a and he and maybe get a
[13:51] little bit boastful and he may have been
[13:53] a little irrational or not in control of
[13:55] his sensibilities and it might have been
[13:57] disrespectful for him him to ask for her
[13:59] to
[14:01] come is this a little bit too out of
[14:04] pocket for some people to kind of give
[14:06] this Heathen King a lookover you know I
[14:09] I I'll say this now well you know if
[14:10] you're getting in trouble you might as
[14:11] well just lean into it right you just
[14:15] well maybe I won't do that all right
[14:17] we'll save it for a whole another series
[14:19] a really long one give myself plenty of
[14:20] Runway give you plenty of rope to hang
[14:23] me that gets you thinking but let's
[14:26] let's just think about it the king's
[14:27] having a party with the fellow was and
[14:29] then he asked his wife to come and and
[14:32] this is quite a request and I wanting to
[14:35] at least suggest that the king in doing
[14:37] this isn't necessarily a sober husband
[14:41] this is getting real very fast right
[14:43] he's not he he may not even be asking
[14:46] something that's the best for the moment
[14:48] because of his drunkenness and because
[14:50] of the setting but the Queen's refusal
[14:52] to come was also
[14:54] disrespectful there might have been a
[14:56] lot of reasons for her to think well I
[14:58] don't want to go and I don't want to do
[15:00] this but it would it was unwise for her
[15:02] to refuse the King's Command and I want
[15:05] to suggest this that it would would not
[15:07] have been wrong for her as his wife to
[15:12] comply I know you're thinking maybe we
[15:16] don't normally get this deep into it 20
[15:17] minutes in but we're there in Genesis
[15:21] 3:1 16 at the time of the ab banishment
[15:25] of the man and the woman from the garden
[15:26] and the Judgment upon the earth and the
[15:28] Serpent and the Sorrows to come upon the
[15:31] woman and the man says unto the woman he
[15:33] said God speaking I will greatly
[15:35] multiply thy sorrow in thy conception in
[15:38] sorrow Thou shalt bring forth children
[15:41] and now notice this phrase and thy
[15:43] desire shall be to thy husband and he
[15:46] shall rule over thee I'm glad that we're
[15:49] reading what God
[15:51] Said and knowing how the denominations
[15:53] work this these days they'll say well
[15:55] it's not in red right and they take
[15:57] exception to the fact that it's not in
[15:59] red but God says then thy desires shall
[16:01] be to thy husband and he shall rule over
[16:04] thee it's a very unique phrase to make
[16:06] this commandment to the woman that thy
[16:08] desire shall be to thy husband and part
[16:11] of its meaning and the emphasis is that
[16:13] you need to willingly yield to your
[16:15] husband's desire that as a woman that
[16:18] you are liable to be controlled by his
[16:21] will that's a scary proposition let's
[16:24] just all admit to it that any one of us
[16:26] man or woman if we were to be put into
[16:28] position where you are going to make
[16:30] yourself vulnerable enough to be led
[16:33] guided or submit to another person's
[16:35] will that's what God is saying about the
[16:38] woman he's saying thy desire shall be to
[16:40] thy husband in other words you are to be
[16:43] controlled by his
[16:45] desire and you must willingly yield to
[16:48] his will or his desire and he shall rule
[16:51] over thee which is in plain language
[16:53] have dominion have reign in lordship
[16:56] over thee in other words it means to
[16:57] rule means to have supreme authority so
[17:00] the man has to have supreme authority in
[17:02] the marital relationship now everybody
[17:04] getting nervous anybody getting nervous
[17:06] I look out and I see all family here
[17:08] even the visitors are family so we're
[17:10] we're good I I don't want to have a
[17:13] viral moment here so stick with me this
[17:15] is this content's not suitable for Tik
[17:17] Tok you need to get the whole thing this
[17:20] is not a YouTube
[17:22] short I am a short preacher but that
[17:24] just has something to do with my
[17:27] height now this is the divine order
[17:30] after the fall this is God saying in
[17:33] light of the fall in light of the things
[17:35] that are going to exist in the world
[17:36] that you're going to be coming forth in
[17:37] God had to arrange the man and the woman
[17:39] in a particular way we could go back
[17:41] into the original and say the woman was
[17:43] taken from his side they were co-equal
[17:45] they were Partners in a very beautiful
[17:47] arrangement but after the fall God says
[17:49] I I need to do something which is part
[17:51] of the Plan of Redemption I need
[17:53] something to be expressed in order to
[17:55] get it back to what it was before so he
[17:57] saying that we have in this life this
[17:59] arrangement to where your desire is to
[18:02] be to thy husband in other words you
[18:03] need to willingly yield and be liable
[18:06] and vulnerable to his desire to where if
[18:09] he has a desire that's different than
[18:10] yours that you're there's this
[18:12] possibility and this potential that
[18:14] you're going to need to yield to that
[18:16] desire and he will have supreme
[18:18] authority over
[18:19] you now now going back to vashy or vashy
[18:23] however you want to say it her refusal
[18:26] and in the Jewish tradition is they tell
[18:28] the story and they kind of have some
[18:30] crazy ideas about it I guess but and one
[18:31] of the things that they're uh that they
[18:33] have part of their tradition is that it
[18:36] wasn't um because of modesty that she
[18:39] refused to come and know she wasn't
[18:41] going oh you know I'm just a lady and I
[18:44] don't want to be seen with a bunch of
[18:45] drunk men and and and I don't want to do
[18:48] this as a matter of fact that there's
[18:49] some things that the Jews build into the
[18:51] lore of the story which clearly tells us
[18:53] that she wasn't being modest at all so
[18:56] she didn't refuse because of modesty
[18:59] and for her to have obeyed as the queen
[19:02] for her to have obeyed would not have
[19:04] marred her
[19:05] testimony if you look at the situation
[19:08] and here's a man that's drunk and here's
[19:09] a man that's calling for his wife and if
[19:12] she would have come nobody would said oh
[19:14] and clutching pearls and been so
[19:17] disappointed that this woman would obey
[19:18] her husband that the queen would come at
[19:20] the King's Command it would not have
[19:22] marred her testimony to obey her
[19:25] husband's command as a matter of fact it
[19:27] would have been in the very IM of
[19:28] Genesis 3:16 that in that moment she's
[19:31] yielding her own desire she's leaving
[19:32] her own party and she's obeying the
[19:34] King's
[19:36] Command now we could take some time to
[19:39] look at how that the leod dean church is
[19:41] depicted here because it rejects the
[19:44] king we see the spirit of the leodan age
[19:47] is exhibited in uh the queen and this is
[19:51] that's the spirit we all fight
[19:54] against that's the spirit that's on the
[19:56] age it's the image that raises up in in
[19:58] this age is this image of a woman this
[20:00] independent woman this leis this
[20:02] divorced woman of great power in the
[20:05] scripture or historically this is the
[20:08] representation in this queen who refuses
[20:11] the King's Command there is a
[20:13] representation of the spirit we all
[20:15] fight man or
[20:16] woman so think of that you're fighting
[20:19] in this end time a perverted Spirit
[20:22] brother brandham says and recognizing
[20:23] your day and its message he said he
[20:24] showed me this is in the preview of the
[20:26] Bride uh that gives in a few places
[20:29] there that summer he showed me a a
[20:32] church he showed me each church as
[20:35] they've come up out of the ages and we
[20:36] know that procession he says and oh how
[20:39] vul vulgar and the last one was this
[20:43] last day Church age which was led by a
[20:47] witch it's quite a
[20:50] statement now that as it comes to and
[20:52] you recall just how vulgar she was and
[20:54] how she was dancing and scantily clothed
[20:57] and it was this culmination of all these
[20:59] secession of Ages where brother bam sees
[21:01] this like this is the worst and then he
[21:04] has this kind of this Dawn on him
[21:06] is this what my ministry's produced is
[21:09] this what comes out of the Leo Dean
[21:11] Church age and then the voice says the
[21:13] bride shall come in preview again why
[21:15] because God's going to call a bride out
[21:16] of that out of that immodesty and and
[21:20] into a bride age but notice it's led by
[21:23] a witch but let's do the math it's led
[21:25] by a woman right and he saidwell how did
[21:29] how did he know she was a
[21:31] witch because it was a woman that was
[21:36] leading it wasn't because she had a was
[21:39] green skinned and you know and a hook
[21:41] nose and she was leading on a broom and
[21:43] brother Brown she's like oh it's a witch
[21:47] no just the fact that a woman was
[21:49] leading the church was all he needed to
[21:51] know to know that that woman was a
[21:55] witch this is good stuff
[21:59] I'm getting Goosebumps but I don't know
[22:01] if it's cuz my Spidey Sense tells me
[22:02] someone's going to throw something at me
[22:05] but this is something very profound when
[22:07] you think about brother brandham didn't
[22:09] have to see a black cat he didn't have
[22:11] to see a big cauldron with rat tails and
[22:14] snails or whatever stirring this Brew
[22:16] for him to go oh I think This Woman's a
[22:18] witch the fact that she was out of her
[22:20] place leading a church is all that we
[22:23] needed to know that it was a witch
[22:25] because she was a woman who was in the
[22:26] wrong office
[22:29] and we could do a little bit of Deep
[22:31] dive on witches I'll save it for October
[22:33] but there was a a an article in the New
[22:36] York Times a couple years ago and the
[22:38] title was the witch continues to enchant
[22:41] as a feminist
[22:43] symbol and if you do some more
[22:45] Scholastic research I even think that uh
[22:48] one of the mantras of some of the modern
[22:50] feminist movements was uh we are the
[22:53] daughters of those you tried to burn uh
[22:56] a and they kind of just calling we we're
[22:57] the the modern witches the daughters of
[22:59] those that you've tried to condemn in
[23:00] the past so this Witchcraft and these
[23:04] the the and the witches have become a
[23:06] symbol of feminism and feminist power
[23:09] and one article said the symbol of the
[23:11] witch has endured over centuries as a
[23:13] representation of female
[23:16] empowerment as The Outsider with uncanny
[23:19] power the witch represents a challenge
[23:21] to patriarchal narratives and that's a
[23:23] mouthful right witches versus the
[23:26] patriarchy the the glorious witch you
[23:29] know Ruth Bader Ginsburg right there's
[23:30] this H uh there's this image and this
[23:33] character of a woman in power who has
[23:36] this she's an outsider she's a Maverick
[23:38] I was trying to think yesterday and I
[23:40] didn't want to Google this I guess I
[23:41] could have asked h a co-pilot or chat
[23:44] GPT are there any witches in fiction
[23:47] that were ever married and I don't need
[23:48] answers but just off the top of your
[23:51] head you begin to realize that a lot of
[23:53] this is just my extensive knowledge in
[23:56] witches comes from Disney I don't know
[23:59] any that are married am I right does
[24:01] anybody can anybody so most commonly
[24:04] right witches are not married they're
[24:06] not mothers they're not you know they're
[24:08] not uh uh at stay atome right so this is
[24:12] the image of a witch and it represents a
[24:15] challenge to the patriarchy or to
[24:18] patriarchal narratives and that that's a
[24:20] pejorative that's a a negative term it's
[24:23] used as a the patriarchy is a term to
[24:26] refer to H
[24:28] misogyny or these chauvinist who want to
[24:30] bring women dis take away their power
[24:33] subjugate them to to Abus and things but
[24:37] the the
[24:37] phrase that's used even about feminism
[24:41] is it's it's a religion and even as its
[24:44] imagery in uh as these witchcraft it's a
[24:48] religion they say conceived in
[24:52] rebellion and that's there no wonder
[24:54] which would become the symbol because in
[24:56] Samuel he tells us that Rebellion is as
[24:59] a sin the sin of
[25:02] Witchcraft and so what does it mean to
[25:05] Rebel to fight against an established
[25:07] order right to Rebel is to go against a
[25:10] rule to Rebel is to go against the way
[25:12] something should be or or or or a
[25:15] government or authority and so
[25:17] witchcraft is the sin H H uh Rebellion
[25:21] is the sin of
[25:23] Witchcraft and again I know that in our
[25:25] minds we want to think about some sort
[25:26] of essential o oils and herbs and things
[25:29] like that and and how we might put
[25:30] together a tea to drink uh to get rid of
[25:32] our bunions but it's it's just a a
[25:35] rebellion against an order or a
[25:38] rule and that's what would make
[25:43] witchcraft I I know what you're thinking
[25:45] I thought we were going to talk about
[25:46] the man of the
[25:48] house not the The Witch of the castle or
[25:51] wherever where do witches live covens
[25:53] whatever they're
[25:54] called in the broom closet
[26:00] now now that we kind of have this
[26:02] picture here of the queen rebelling
[26:05] against the king if you'll if we'll skip
[26:08] to verse
[26:11] 17 the kind of the discussion amongst
[26:14] the chamberlains is
[26:15] whoa this isn't
[26:18] good because the word's going to get out
[26:21] we know that you've asked for her to
[26:22] come and she's refused and now this is
[26:25] wanting to get into this so we can
[26:26] understand the severity of this he says
[26:29] for this deed of the
[26:30] queen this is the the words that's
[26:33] coming to advise the king this deed of
[26:35] the queen shall come abroad unto all
[26:37] women so that they shall despise their
[26:41] husbands in their eyes when it shall be
[26:44] reported that King aerus commanded vashi
[26:46] the queen to be brought in before him
[26:48] but she came
[26:50] not to say that they shall despise their
[26:53] husbands in their eyes it means they'll
[26:55] look down at them with contempt right
[26:58] they will make light of their Authority
[27:00] they'll refuse to give the honor that's
[27:02] due all it would take is for the
[27:04] president's wife or the queen or someone
[27:07] in power somebody visible an influencer
[27:09] to do something in a way that shows that
[27:12] this is what a wife can do this is
[27:14] within her power and she can get away
[27:16] with it if we just want to use that
[27:18] phrase uh they are going to other women
[27:21] will see what the queen has done and
[27:22] because of her influences they will be
[27:24] in contempt of their husbands and they
[27:26] will not honor their husbands as they
[27:28] ought to and so this is an act of
[27:32] defiance against an established
[27:34] order in verse 18 they continue likewise
[27:37] shall the ladies of Persia and media say
[27:39] this day unto all the king's princes
[27:41] which have heard of the deed of the
[27:42] queen thus shall there arise too much
[27:45] contempt and
[27:47] wrath every that's not going to be good
[27:49] for all these homes right it's not GNA
[27:52] be good for a prince who thinks he's a
[27:55] prince to come home and have the his
[27:56] wife
[27:58] uh telling him what to do so this is
[28:00] she's looking down on him he's going to
[28:01] look down on her it's going to lead to a
[28:03] quarrel and a fight it's going to get
[28:06] nasty and whether you want to argue that
[28:08] the men are out of their
[28:10] place or it's the women that are out of
[28:12] their place we can at least accept that
[28:14] they recognized that if things got out
[28:17] of order it would get
[28:18] chaotic and there was a recognition of
[28:21] the corrupting nature of this type of
[28:24] example that if a woman could act
[28:27] against the order that God had
[28:29] established and we can look we'll look
[28:31] deeper in the scripture to see that this
[28:32] is this is scriptural that the woman
[28:36] being arranged in a particular way to
[28:38] the man that if she could buck up
[28:39] against that and she could resist that
[28:41] then it would have a domino effect and
[28:43] be corruptive to other people so it says
[28:46] in verse 19 if it pleased the king Let
[28:48] There Go a royal commandment from him
[28:50] and let it be written among the laws of
[28:52] the Persians and the mes that it be not
[28:54] altered that Vash I come no more before
[28:57] King Aeros and let the King give her
[28:59] royal State unto another that is better
[29:02] than she well that's quite a
[29:06] statement and essentially it's saying
[29:07] that the king divorce her and marry
[29:10] again and when and then we might we
[29:13] could he we could argue that's pretty
[29:16] harsh it says and when the king's decree
[29:18] which he shall make shall be published
[29:19] throughout all his Empire for it is
[29:21] great all the wives shall give to their
[29:24] husbands honor both to great and and
[29:28] small so making no distinction whether
[29:31] you're a king whether you're a prince or
[29:32] whether you're nobody wives shall give
[29:35] their husband's honor both whether
[29:37] you're great or small honor is to be due
[29:40] and the saying pleased the king and the
[29:42] princes and the King did according to
[29:43] the word of micin for he sent letters un
[29:46] all the king's provinces and every
[29:48] Province according to the writing
[29:49] thereof and to every people after their
[29:51] language that every man should bear rule
[29:54] in his own house that it should be
[29:56] published according according to the
[29:57] language of every people this is the
[30:00] ultimate standard that vashy rejected
[30:03] this is the ultimate thing that she
[30:05] violated is to not be in harmony with
[30:08] her husband act against his desire to
[30:11] dishonor him to look down upon him to
[30:14] bring contempt and to conjure wrath and
[30:17] and now this is bringing it back to the
[30:19] Baseline this is what was in danger of
[30:21] being eroded that the women should give
[30:23] honor to their husbands whether they be
[30:26] great or small both the women or the man
[30:28] and that every man should bear rule this
[30:30] is the rule that was in danger of being
[30:32] eroded that every man should bear rule
[30:34] in his own
[30:36] house and the Jewish tradition and some
[30:38] of the uh History built around this and
[30:41] even I think Joseph Josephus makes
[30:43] reference to How It Was Written that the
[30:46] woman was to honor and to learn his
[30:48] language and his Customs a lot of things
[30:51] that are very striking in this but to
[30:53] Bear rule that means to be Prince to be
[30:55] Lord to be master we know brother bam
[30:58] often makes reference to the fact that
[30:59] Sarah called Abraham Lord as that's
[31:02] because he was her Lord so this this
[31:05] isn't a strange uh scriptural principle
[31:07] that the man would be Lord or Master the
[31:10] one whose commands are obeyed for him to
[31:12] be honored within the family and that he
[31:14] should bear rule in his own house it
[31:16] means that it would be the family is
[31:18] subject to
[31:20] him that he is the one that
[31:23] rules in the home so if he ask the wife
[31:27] to do something we're given the general
[31:29] rule if you ask the wife to do something
[31:31] that she would do
[31:34] it in Ephesians chap 5:22 so we could
[31:37] see that this is a scriptural principle
[31:40] and I would hope that you're taking this
[31:42] all on its face what the Bible is saying
[31:45] and and and knowing that you have a rich
[31:46] history in scripture in the message of
[31:48] the hour that I'm not going to I'm not
[31:50] trying to paint a picture which is um an
[31:53] abusive uh narrative or that is kind of
[31:56] the things that often happens where
[31:57] there's a dictator and the man doesn't
[31:59] matter what kind of man he is he's to
[32:01] rule and he only points to the rule for
[32:04] his authority instead of character and
[32:07] we're coming to this because we're
[32:08] talking about the man of the home but I
[32:10] think it's important to establish some
[32:12] of these things in
[32:13] scripture now in Ephesians 5:22 it says
[32:16] wives submit yourselves un your own
[32:18] husbands as unto the
[32:21] Lord they see the the the image there
[32:25] wives submit yourselves unto your own
[32:29] husbands so you there's you have your
[32:31] own husband as unto the
[32:34] Lord that's saying that there's a
[32:36] submission that you're going to do to
[32:37] your husband in the same way that you
[32:39] would submit to the Lord now that's
[32:40] quite a
[32:42] standard the husband here in the
[32:44] language that's being used it's the male
[32:47] head of the house the household of the
[32:50] family the one that has been given the
[32:51] that gives the family name he's the
[32:53] master submit unto your own husbands
[32:55] that husband is the master of the house
[32:58] we're looking at now the place and
[33:00] position of the man within a
[33:01] relationship within a family within the
[33:03] house he wives are to submit to
[33:06] voluntarily arrange themselves together
[33:08] with the husband in Harmony and
[33:11] continuity not to be divided not to have
[33:14] separate Ambitions and separate goals
[33:16] but to be arranged together brother Bram
[33:18] in the sermon adoption part three says
[33:20] do you know it's wrong mister for you to
[33:22] continue to smoke and act the way you do
[33:24] quite a question do you it's wrong for
[33:27] you not to be the husband of your
[33:30] house ah he's kind of putting he's
[33:33] putting smoking you a man smoking and
[33:36] physically defiling his body on par with
[33:39] an he to not be the husband of your
[33:41] house and he says your wife get a little
[33:43] temper spell and kick you out the door
[33:45] and you say yes bless your heart honey
[33:47] I'll I'll come right back right we joke
[33:49] all the time I'm going sleep on the
[33:50] couch or I'm in the dog house can't
[33:52] remember which brother it was that was
[33:53] telling me how that just in and uh since
[33:56] the Advent of television that most of
[33:57] the television shows uh always kind of
[34:00] characterize the husband as just being a
[34:02] buffoon a bumbling idiot right you know
[34:04] just a a guy who just works and comes
[34:07] home and drinks beer and the wife's the
[34:08] one that manages everything she's the
[34:09] one that's uh she's the mother and she's
[34:12] doing all the one doing all the hard
[34:13] work the one that's wise the one that's
[34:15] smart and and men are just right they
[34:19] just like tools and and alcohol and
[34:22] sports and uh some of your wives are
[34:24] probably thinking that's all they talk
[34:25] about anyways except for the alcohol
[34:27] maybe rubbing alcohol I don't
[34:31] know but there's a he says do you know
[34:33] what's wrong for you not to be the
[34:34] husband of your house your wife get a
[34:36] temper and she's he's saying and you're
[34:37] you just demure to her and she tells you
[34:39] what to do how can you be a tender at
[34:41] the house of God when you can't even
[34:43] control your own house drawn back on
[34:46] scripture how can a man have his place
[34:49] and position in the house of God when he
[34:50] doesn't even know his own place in his
[34:52] own
[34:53] house so the man can't say well you you
[34:56] need to listen to me you need to listen
[34:58] to me I'm a pastor and it's like that
[35:01] that doesn't work at
[35:02] home any Authority and any uh any
[35:05] testimony that the man would have as a
[35:07] as an officer whether it be Pastor all
[35:10] the way down you name it is going to be
[35:11] derived at how he carries himself
[35:13] privately in his public relationships
[35:16] and he doesn't point to the fact that
[35:17] he's a deacon to get away with murder in
[35:20] his private life he lives a clean life
[35:22] he lives subject to the Lord and He
[35:24] humbles himself he repents if he makes
[35:26] mistakes and has a testimony and that's
[35:28] what qualifies him for office am it's
[35:31] almost as if we kind of work it in
[35:32] opposite now to where if you have a if
[35:35] you're a deacon if you're a pastor if
[35:36] you're a trustee if you're in that that
[35:38] upper cross that Echelon that that that
[35:41] click you can get away with anything you
[35:43] want and you're
[35:46] absolved you're absolved from your
[35:48] adulteries you're absolved from your
[35:49] criminal Behavior absolved from your
[35:51] lack of character you're absolved from
[35:52] your wrath and your fornication you're
[35:54] absolved what because the office wipes
[35:56] the Slate clean when it should work
[35:58] exactly the opposite that someone is
[36:00] living a life and they have a test
[36:03] doesn't mean they're mistake free but
[36:04] they're living a life and they have a
[36:05] testimony and the Bible says proven and
[36:08] that's what you why you can trust them
[36:10] in the office and would you agree we've
[36:12] seen too much of it working the opposite
[36:14] amen
[36:17] amen how can you be a tender at the
[36:19] house of God when you can't even control
[36:21] your own house that's exactly right do
[36:22] you know sister that your husband is not
[36:24] only your husband but he is your ruler
[36:27] God said
[36:29] so do you know that your husband is not
[36:32] only your husband but he is your ruler
[36:34] now I know the thoughts just start
[36:36] rattling off and for those of you who
[36:39] are
[36:41] wives I I I'm not being a wife I can't
[36:43] really think like that but I can imagine
[36:46] that you begin to think about your
[36:48] spouse and your relationships and your
[36:49] unique circumstance and things like this
[36:51] it could cause your heart to race a
[36:52] little bit right cuz not everybody um is
[36:56] in relation some some are divorced some
[36:58] are in relationships where they're
[36:59] they're not on the same page doctrinally
[37:01] some don't have have unbelieving spouses
[37:04] and anytime you talk about this you're
[37:05] going to find people that are kind of
[37:06] outside the general order and the
[37:08] general rule and let's just agree it's
[37:10] challenging isn't it it's challenging
[37:12] but there's a truth that remains despite
[37:16] believer or unbeliever there's a
[37:19] role and we maybe we can get into it
[37:21] more later on the woman but we're
[37:22] wanting to look at the man of the house
[37:24] and we'll get there the man of the home
[37:26] we'll get to the man but we see how the
[37:28] man you're supposed to be the husband of
[37:30] the house you're to control your own
[37:34] house and so he says sister your husband
[37:36] is not just your husband a spouse
[37:38] someone who's you shared his last name
[37:40] now but he's your
[37:42] ruler verse 23 of Ephesians 5 for the
[37:45] husband is the head of the wife even as
[37:48] Christ is the head of the church and he
[37:49] is the savior of the body so the head
[37:52] therefore as the church is subject unto
[37:55] Christ so let the wives be to their own
[37:58] husbands in
[38:00] everything this is what qualifies the
[38:02] character of the submission wives submit
[38:04] your husbands as unto the Lord in the
[38:07] same way that the church is subject unto
[38:09] Christ now we think of that and we say
[38:11] that's absolute submission that's total
[38:14] dependence that's absolute vulnerability
[38:17] what are you as a Christian without
[38:19] Christ what are you as the bride without
[38:22] a bridegroom what are we as the body of
[38:25] Christ The Church Without Our Savior
[38:27] without our husband Christ so that's
[38:29] that's quite a statement to
[38:33] make the the as the church is subject to
[38:35] Christ wives should be subject this is
[38:38] this voluntary attitude of yielding this
[38:41] act of honoring and respecting their
[38:43] husband says in everything says of
[38:46] Christ in Colossians 1:18 and he is the
[38:48] head of the body of the church who is
[38:49] the beginning the firstborn from the
[38:51] dead he's the head of the body that
[38:53] means the Supreme in anything
[38:57] the chief The prominent one of persons
[38:59] it means he's the master and the Lord he
[39:02] is the head of the body the church that
[39:04] in all things he might have the
[39:08] preeminence that's right this is what
[39:12] Christ is to the church he's the head
[39:13] he's the preeminent one he's the master
[39:16] he's the
[39:17] chief and as he is the head of the body
[39:19] to the church and all things he might
[39:20] have the preeminence so he's the
[39:22] preeminent one he's the supreme
[39:23] authority the image that Paul is drawing
[39:26] is that wives are to be submissive to
[39:28] their husband in the same
[39:30] way
[39:32] now is that what the Bible
[39:36] saying
[39:38] amen it's what the Bible is saying
[39:41] brother bradam in the sermon thirsting
[39:42] for Life says and you men that'll let
[39:44] your wife do that I believe he's talking
[39:45] about smoking in this particular
[39:47] instance and there's other uh other
[39:50] places where he's talking about letting
[39:51] the woman dress a certain way and act a
[39:53] certain way he says and you men that'll
[39:54] let your wife do that that show shows
[39:56] What You're Made Of made out of that
[39:59] shows what kind of man you are he says a
[40:03] man is the head of the family he's the
[40:05] head of the
[40:06] house this is what we're looking at as
[40:08] this head he is the head of the house as
[40:11] Christ is the head of the body he's the
[40:13] head of the wife as Christ is the head
[40:15] of the church says he says but today the
[40:19] woman's the head of the house head of
[40:20] the factory head of the church and
[40:22] everything else because it's become a
[40:24] conglomeration of sin I like that phrase
[40:27] the conglomeration it's disorder it's
[40:29] chaos everything's turned upside down he
[40:31] says she's the head of the house he says
[40:32] the head of the factory the head of the
[40:34] church everything else because it's
[40:35] become a conglomeration of sin and it's
[40:38] happened listen it's happened no matter
[40:41] how much leadership in many churches can
[40:44] be misogynistic and abusive and see be M
[40:47] dominated and kind of give off this
[40:50] air of male superiority a lot of times
[40:53] with churches like that it's the women
[40:55] that are running
[40:57] it because it's a perverted
[41:00] Spirit some of the the the harshest some
[41:04] of the harshest Ministries can be
[41:07] dominated by a lesbian Spirit not a
[41:10] brute man but a lesbian spirit because
[41:13] it's a witch trying to abuse and control
[41:15] the woman the
[41:17] church W breakout session we need to
[41:20] talk about that right don't we that's
[41:21] getting some people's wheels are
[41:24] turning he says and Satan took eve and
[41:26] he's still using her in America as a
[41:28] woman's Nation again we're talking about
[41:29] the man of the home not the Le deing
[41:32] woman but we're seeing an image a spirit
[41:34] rising up and we see brother Bram saying
[41:36] the man ought to be the head of his home
[41:38] but the woman's wanting to take that
[41:39] place he should be the head of a church
[41:41] head of a factory but it says with this
[41:43] conglomeration of sin the woman has been
[41:44] thrust into a position she's in a role
[41:47] things are happening as a matter of fact
[41:49] they can trace back the Advent uh uh of
[41:51] some women empowerment and even the
[41:53] birth control and things like that to
[41:54] the woman being drawn into the the
[41:56] workforce as a result of War right and
[41:59] say oh well these wars and these forces
[42:01] that were taking place and these uh uh
[42:03] woes that are taking place and these
[42:05] seals being temporary open we're
[42:07] thinking oh it was all DEC create this
[42:08] but what did It ultimately do move the
[42:10] woman out of her position National Force
[42:12] forcing a woman into the workforce
[42:14] things happening and so Satan's ultimate
[42:16] objective wasn't to blow everything up
[42:18] with nuclear bombs but it was to get
[42:20] people out of their place and out of
[42:21] their position I say it was part of it
[42:25] in 1 Corinthians chap 11:3 says I would
[42:27] have you know that the head of every man
[42:30] is Christ and the head of the woman is
[42:33] the man and the head of Christ is God
[42:36] now that ought to just seal it right
[42:37] there to know that Christ's head is God
[42:40] so even with Christ there's headship
[42:43] there's order and it says the head of
[42:46] the woman is the man now speaking within
[42:49] the marital Arrangement the union of a
[42:51] man to a woman within the household he's
[42:52] saying the man is the physical provider
[42:55] he's the spirit spiritual provider and
[42:57] protector of his wife and his family
[42:59] that's what he's tasked with he's tasked
[43:01] with providing spiritually and
[43:03] physically he's task with protecting and
[43:05] looking out over this is the role of the
[43:07] man he's to do this he's to feed and to
[43:10] clothe he's to look uh protect there's a
[43:12] lot of things that the man is called to
[43:13] do he says the man is the head of the
[43:18] woman The Protector the
[43:21] lifegiver and it says in brother brand
[43:24] I'm writing this in the chapter six of
[43:26] the church age book it is the word that
[43:29] rules us not
[43:31] men that that hopefully it starts
[43:33] turning turning things a little bit the
[43:36] word rules us not men so it's got to be
[43:39] word now aen and keep that phrase in
[43:41] mind we're going to be coming back to a
[43:43] principle before we close now a man as a
[43:45] husband is head of the woman he rules
[43:47] her I know that's heavy language but the
[43:50] church is a woman too and her ruler is
[43:52] the word Jesus is the word if she
[43:54] rejects the word and takes any other
[43:56] headship she is an
[43:58] adulteress she would be that wit she'd
[44:00] be in Rebellion if she rejects the word
[44:02] and takes any other headship she's an
[44:04] adulterous so we see the queen rejecting
[44:06] the headship of her husband and and the
[44:08] husband putting her way in divorc now I
[44:10] know that's strong language but let's
[44:12] just look at it for what the principle
[44:13] teaches us now you name me at one church
[44:16] that hasn't given up the word for
[44:17] tradition and Creeds they are all
[44:19] adultes like mother like daughter so
[44:23] notice this the the characterization of
[44:25] rejecting the word rejecting headship
[44:27] rejecting rule Bram shown that the
[44:29] church is subject to Christ Christ is
[44:32] the word so we must be submissive to him
[44:34] in all things that's the
[44:36] ultimate that's the true then there's a
[44:39] type we take away from that to begin to
[44:41] understand what can be achieved and what
[44:43] ought to exist within the arrangement of
[44:44] the man to the woman the man is the head
[44:48] of the woman he says he rules
[44:50] her but let me say this this just isn't
[44:53] mere human
[44:54] hierarchy right because if you do that
[44:57] we could say oh well if the church is a
[44:58] woman the man is to be the head of the
[45:00] woman and brother Bram saying no it's
[45:01] the word we believe in the leadership of
[45:03] men but it's the leadership of Man by
[45:05] the word so that it's not the man
[45:08] leading but the spirit or the word so
[45:10] there's a there's an order that's being
[45:12] established it's just not hierarchy it's
[45:14] not patriarchy I I it's it's not just to
[45:17] establish the woman as submissive and
[45:19] the man is dominant that's not the case
[45:21] at all but it's just the proper order of
[45:23] things it's the critical Order of Things
[45:26] it's the way that God desires things to
[45:28] be arranged now I hope this isn't too
[45:30] much of a a step but I feel like I just
[45:33] need to point to this I I'm making good
[45:35] time I think I'm going to be able to
[45:36] finish
[45:38] today and and so if I need to stop early
[45:42] I will I'm not worried about uh
[45:44] opportunities to minister on this
[45:45] subject so if we need to stop we will
[45:48] but now let's just take a look very
[45:49] practical in the scripture 1 Corinthians
[45:52] chap 14: 34 and
[45:54] 35 this is
[45:56] this is looking at the order of things
[45:59] Paul says let your woman keep silence in
[46:01] the churches for it is not permitted
[46:03] unto them to speak be they are commanded
[46:06] to be under obedience as also saith the
[46:09] law now what would they be what is he
[46:11] referring to that there to be under
[46:13] obedience and he says this is what the
[46:14] law says so he's referring to something
[46:17] that I would say is greater than just
[46:19] the written law as given to Moses but
[46:21] the law of God where the woman is to be
[46:23] arranged with the man and her desires to
[46:25] be to her husband and he is to rule over
[46:27] her says so he says it's as if he
[46:29] anticipates the objection that well what
[46:32] if the woman doesn't
[46:34] understand what should she do if the
[46:36] preacher preaches and she doesn't
[46:39] understand shouldn't she ask for
[46:41] clarification shouldn't she speak
[46:43] shouldn't she try to get uh uh get
[46:45] better you know try to bring some things
[46:47] out he says and that they will learn
[46:48] anything let them ask their husbands at
[46:50] home for it a shame for a woman to speak
[46:53] in the church so he anticipates the
[46:56] objection well what if women don't
[46:57] understand he says ask your own husbands
[46:59] in particular at home now again I say
[47:02] this is that that general rule that
[47:04] general order this is the way that it
[47:05] ought to
[47:06] be this is the way that you would you
[47:08] should want it to be that the women are
[47:11] to be under
[47:12] obedience as saith the law they're to
[47:15] keep silent in the churches they're not
[47:17] permitted to speak but if they if
[47:18] they're to learn they're to ask their
[47:20] husbands at
[47:22] home now what would you think if a wife
[47:26] said I'm not going to ask my husband
[47:28] anything he's a spiritual
[47:30] idiot I mean what would you think about
[47:32] that my husband doesn't know anything
[47:35] I'm not going to ask him I'm more
[47:36] spiritual than him what what attitude is
[47:40] going to be
[47:41] conveyed when you hear that do you find
[47:45] yourself saying man that sister's so
[47:48] Godly I mean a young man's probably
[47:50] thinking
[47:52] if I hope I find me a Wicked Witch of
[47:55] the East
[47:57] when I get
[47:58] older I want a nose just like that where
[48:01] do you find these green skinned women
[48:04] there's nobody that wants that it
[48:06] doesn't speak well it may be the truth
[48:08] he could be a nitwit he may be a loser
[48:11] he may be unfaithful he may be there may
[48:13] be a lot of things but what does that
[48:14] say about a woman who can just so
[48:16] quickly throw her husband under the
[48:19] bus I know some guys just sleep under
[48:22] the bus it's like they just arrange
[48:24] themselves under it
[48:26] uh but there's a certain way that you
[48:28] can an attitude talking about an
[48:31] attitude and Paul is saying that a woman
[48:33] should keep silent in church and learn
[48:34] from her own husbands in particular I'm
[48:37] just saying what Paul said 1 Timothy 2:
[48:40] 11 12 and 13 let the woman learn in
[48:43] Silence with all
[48:44] subjection but I suffer not a woman to
[48:46] teach nor to usurp authority over the
[48:48] man but to be in silence for Adam was
[48:51] first form then Eve again this is just
[48:54] uh more parallel to First 1 Corinthians
[48:56] 14 let the woman learn in Silence with
[48:58] all subjection to be under obedience as
[49:01] saith the law uh that your desires to be
[49:03] to your husband he shall rule over you
[49:05] wives be submissive to your own husbands
[49:07] as unto the Lord and and so let wives be
[49:11] to their own husbands in everything
[49:12] subject this is the principles in the
[49:14] scripture now being applied even in the
[49:17] house of the Lord that a woman should
[49:18] learn in science with all subjection to
[49:20] their husbands it says let not a woman
[49:22] teach nor to usurp Authority over the
[49:26] man now that's a phrase that is so
[49:28] unique it means one who with his own
[49:30] hands kills another or
[49:33] himself one who usurps authority over
[49:37] the man it's one who either with their
[49:39] own hands kills somebody else or kills
[49:43] thems and that's exactly what a woman
[49:45] would do is she removes the
[49:48] head she kills
[49:51] herself it's one who acts on his own
[49:53] authority one who op uh operates
[49:56] absolute power to exercise dominion over
[49:58] one so when we say that a woman is not
[50:01] to teach we think well a woman shouldn't
[50:03] be behind the pulpit there's no such
[50:04] thing as women preachers in the Bible
[50:06] and the usurping authority of a man I
[50:08] know a lot of times we view that as the
[50:10] woman in the Pulpit teaching but it's
[50:12] actually any woman who's not in
[50:15] subjection a woman who is not under
[50:17] obedience as sayith the law it's a woman
[50:19] who's now ex exercising her own dominion
[50:22] over a domain that's not hers amen it's
[50:26] a woman who's taking the the one who
[50:29] with his own hands kills another that's
[50:31] to remove the lifegiving force who kills
[50:33] another or themselves so it's intruding
[50:35] in an office that's not theirs to usurp
[50:38] Authority is just to assume a position
[50:40] that you shouldn't
[50:42] assume because every place and position
[50:44] has roles and
[50:46] responsibilities and brother brand
[50:48] messes continues to address this in the
[50:50] thotran church age he says now a woman
[50:52] is not meant to have an iron disposition
[50:55] ition she is according to the Holy
[50:58] scripture to be submissive to the male
[51:00] this is with all
[51:02] subjection and the woman is to be ruled
[51:04] by the word the woman to keep silent to
[51:07] be under obedience there's a lot a lot
[51:08] of scriptures here as we're trying to
[51:09] read this wives submitting to your own
[51:11] husbands let your wives be subject to
[51:13] your husbands and everything you hear
[51:15] you know the scriptures we're reading
[51:17] these now brother Bram says according to
[51:19] the scripture she's to be submissive to
[51:20] the male this is commanded of her woman
[51:24] who's truly female all female will be of
[51:26] that disposition so there's this iron
[51:29] disposition which would be that
[51:31] Rebellion that sin of Witchcraft that
[51:33] resist headship or structure or order
[51:35] that resist being in her place that
[51:37] wants to take control or intrude in the
[51:39] office that wants to be the leader that
[51:40] wants to have the power that wants to
[51:42] dominate and and and have the Dominion
[51:44] that wants to usurp authority to
[51:46] exercise control in domains that are not
[51:49] hers he says a woman who is all female
[51:53] will be submissive not dominant
[51:56] well not will be soft and and not of an
[51:59] iron disposition but he says a very
[52:01] important phrase not a
[52:05] doormat no real male makes a female a
[52:08] doormat so let me say
[52:10] this sometimes things get hard because
[52:13] you stamp on
[52:15] them and ground that was otherwise soft
[52:18] can get very very hard if you trample on
[52:20] it long
[52:23] enough but a true woman
[52:25] she will want to be under Authority and
[52:28] not rule over the male for he is the
[52:30] head of the house this is a desire I
[52:32] believe that every daughter of God has
[52:34] she doesn't want to be in that position
[52:36] but sometimes a man's own Disobedience
[52:38] puts a woman in that position Abigail
[52:41] should have never been in the position
[52:42] she was in the scripture there's times
[52:44] even as brother Chris Kavanaugh was
[52:46] bringing out there's things sometimes
[52:47] you have to do in a moment and you you
[52:49] act and you pray you intercede you do
[52:51] something a and and you're not out of
[52:53] your place you're doing things that you
[52:55] have to do and sometimes men put women
[52:57] in positions to do things that they
[52:59] otherwise shouldn't be asked to do and
[53:01] having to do it will make their
[53:02] disposition hard because they're
[53:05] laboring under a strain and a burden
[53:06] that they shouldn't have to labor under
[53:09] but a woman should would want to be
[53:10] under Authority she she wants to yield
[53:13] to the head of the house if she breaks
[53:15] that image that God made for her she is
[53:19] perverted so the woman not being her
[53:21] place perverts the image of God she
[53:24] breaks that image if she usurps
[53:25] Authority if any of these scriptural
[53:27] images that we've expressed so far are
[53:29] not uh in in harmony with the her action
[53:33] she she's perverted she breaks the image
[53:36] then he says any male that lets the
[53:38] woman take authority has also broken
[53:41] that image and he is
[53:43] perverted so the responsibility it's not
[53:45] entirely upon the
[53:47] woman that there he lets the woman take
[53:50] the authority it's not that she
[53:52] threatens with the cast iron pan to take
[53:54] it
[53:55] just you in not assuming the Authority
[53:58] or doing what you ought to do she takes
[54:00] it because someone has to somebody has
[54:03] to say something so I don't want us to
[54:05] get this picture that it's just the
[54:06] woman wrestling for it fighting for it
[54:08] taking it stealing it doing all sorts of
[54:10] things uh sometimes it's it's picked up
[54:13] out of
[54:14] necessity and so a man who lets the
[54:17] woman or causes or forces a woman to
[54:19] break that image he breaks the image and
[54:23] he is also perverted that's
[54:26] right because for a woman to step into
[54:29] that role means it's a woman exercising
[54:32] Dominion so it's a dominating
[54:35] female and it can't have the right
[54:38] nature it can't have the right nature
[54:40] attached to it because it's in an office
[54:42] that her nature God divided male and
[54:44] female there's this the the the the
[54:46] nature of a man is to have the Dominion
[54:49] so he's the one that has the correct
[54:52] authority to have dominion so whenever
[54:55] and he can do it without
[54:56] dominating but as soon as the woman has
[55:00] Authority in Dominion it becomes
[55:02] dominating that's why that spirit that
[55:05] dominates is that female Spirit not a
[55:08] true masculine
[55:10] Spirit brother brah said being a
[55:12] dominating female is
[55:14] Antichrist think of that being a
[55:16] dominating female is
[55:19] Antichrist it's not even say a
[55:21] dominating male it shows that Spirit
[55:23] behind it he says dominating female do
[55:27] you know how do you know how to finish a
[55:28] dominating female is the greatest curse
[55:33] in the
[55:40] world a dominating
[55:42] female is the greatest curse in the
[55:49] world take the name of Jesus
[55:54] with
[55:57] Hallelujah now let me Sprint to a close
[56:01] since we're just all comfortable and so
[56:03] light now and just just enjoying church
[56:07] just loving the the bond of unity that
[56:09] we all have and just feeling closer to
[56:11] one
[56:13] another and a
[56:17] whimper Ephesians 523 it says for the
[56:21] husband is the head of the wife
[56:29] even as Christ is the head of the
[56:32] church hallu and he is the savior of the
[56:37] body my title today was the man of the
[56:39] home not the male of the
[56:43] house man's
[56:45] headship is defined by the headship of
[56:49] Christ over the church and the same way
[56:52] that a woman's submissiveness is
[56:53] qualified in the church is submissive or
[56:56] the body submissive to the Head Christ
[56:58] we say oh the woman needs to be
[56:59] submissive in all things the woman needs
[57:01] to do this as the church does to Christ
[57:03] now it turns it around it says but the
[57:05] man as a head needs to love like Christ
[57:09] needs to be a savior like Christ it
[57:12] qualifies his rule when he says he's the
[57:14] man of the house he needs to be a man
[57:16] like Christ when he rules the woman he
[57:18] needs to rule like Christ and so we've
[57:21] got a lot of images of what the woman
[57:22] needs to look like to submit like the
[57:24] church us to Christ but listen it starts
[57:27] with the
[57:29] head he's not asking the women to submit
[57:33] without first telling the men to rule
[57:35] the right way right he recognizes that
[57:38] this would be this would be uh the king
[57:41] and queen all over again you got a drunk
[57:43] man demanding his drunk wife to show up
[57:46] to a party and she's with the ladies and
[57:48] she doesn't want to come he's like bring
[57:50] her to me I want to see her she's like
[57:52] I'm not going over there right it's just
[57:55] going to be a fight I'm divorcing you go
[57:58] ahead right this is this is what you
[58:01] could expect in that
[58:04] scenario so he doesn't just say well
[58:06] you're the King live however you want I
[58:09] believe that if there was counsel to be
[58:11] given to the king it been like you know
[58:13] there's a way that you can respect your
[58:15] wife there's a time and a moment that's
[58:17] appropriate in other words there's a
[58:19] qualification of what that headship
[58:20] looks like the Bible says the head of
[58:24] every man
[58:25] is
[58:26] Christ so oh the woman the woman I'm the
[58:29] head of the woman I that's the way that
[58:31] it ought to be
[58:34] brothers okay good I like that nobody's
[58:36] afraid to say
[58:38] Amen that we we would want to say that I
[58:41] am the head of my wife therefore she
[58:43] looks to me as the head the supreme
[58:45] authority uh that in all things I as the
[58:48] husband might have the prence and I know
[58:49] it kind of makes some people get a
[58:50] little bit uncomfortable but we're
[58:52] looking at that's what the Bible's
[58:53] saying that it ought to be that the man
[58:55] is the head of the woman but it doesn't
[58:58] paint a partial picture that in that
[59:01] Arrangement if we do it this way and
[59:02] this hierarchy but let's just say the
[59:03] man is the head of the woman it's also
[59:06] saying that Christ is the head of the
[59:10] man if Christ isn't the head of the man
[59:13] it's not right it's a different order
[59:15] it's a different Arrangement that's what
[59:17] causes problems Christ needs to be the
[59:20] head of the man and all the sisters said
[59:23] amen
[59:25] the husband is the head of the wife but
[59:27] Christ ought to be the head of the
[59:29] husband if not he can't be a
[59:32] lifegiver if not he can't be a protector
[59:34] he can't be a provider he can't be a
[59:36] sanctifier because Christ it says about
[59:40] Christ example in Ephesians 5:29 that he
[59:42] did no man ever hated his own flesh but
[59:44] he nourisheth and cherisheth it even as
[59:46] the Lord the
[59:47] church so the Lord nourishes the church
[59:50] he cherishes the church he clothes he
[59:52] feeds he looks out after it
[59:55] as his own
[59:56] flesh so any man that demands headship
[1:00:01] or exercis his rule that is unlike
[1:00:04] Christ is perverting
[1:00:06] headship he's perverting the
[1:00:10] image as we read already that he says
[1:00:13] that not a
[1:00:14] doormat a woman is not called to be a
[1:00:18] doormat that means you're not called to
[1:00:20] try to put her under your feet or under
[1:00:22] your
[1:00:23] thumb cuz that's not what it means to be
[1:00:25] the
[1:00:28] head brother B says you're supposed to
[1:00:30] be the boss of the house you are the
[1:00:33] ruler the Bible said the man shall rule
[1:00:36] not a dictator now a floor matat he made
[1:00:40] him a helpmate a
[1:00:43] sweetheart that's the attitude remember
[1:00:46] it's the word that rules us not men amen
[1:00:49] so then I have to take this I have to
[1:00:51] take this understanding as a man that
[1:00:54] yes I'm called to be a ruler I'm called
[1:00:55] to be a husband I'm called to be one in
[1:00:58] Authority but I can't do it I can't do
[1:01:00] it in my own image I've got to be under
[1:01:03] the word because I need to be ruled by
[1:01:06] the word otherwise my rulership will be
[1:01:09] just human hierarchy and it'll be a man
[1:01:11] that's merely leading the woman and
[1:01:13] that's still not the image that God
[1:01:15] wants Amen in God's order if I could put
[1:01:18] this way supreme authority looks very
[1:01:20] differently than what it looks like in a
[1:01:21] worldly image and a worldly image in a
[1:01:24] cultures the male is the dominant one
[1:01:26] and he can dominate all he wants and he
[1:01:28] can say whatever he wants and get away
[1:01:30] whatever he wants and he's and he's just
[1:01:34] dominating but in the word where you see
[1:01:36] headship where you see a ruler you must
[1:01:37] see Christlike
[1:01:40] character because I want to say it this
[1:01:42] way I think this is where we we're going
[1:01:44] to be able to close in this a dominating
[1:01:47] female is a double
[1:01:50] perversion because a man shouldn't be
[1:01:51] dominating
[1:01:53] anyways right right so for a man to
[1:01:56] dominate a man to make it a doormat a
[1:01:58] man to exercise Dominion because bless
[1:02:00] God I'm the man and as brother Jason
[1:02:02] point out in the scripture that the
[1:02:03] Gentiles exercise Dominion through this
[1:02:05] hierarchy this ranking this Authority
[1:02:07] that's just that's just by by law and by
[1:02:10] rule but there's a certain way that God
[1:02:12] wants there to be Harmony and continuity
[1:02:14] and Arrangement uh and Order where the
[1:02:16] man is the leader and he's the head but
[1:02:18] it's to serve it's for the health of the
[1:02:21] body the health of the marriage the
[1:02:22] health of the family not for the health
[1:02:23] of the man
[1:02:25] and so we'll get into it more maybe in
[1:02:26] the future on this on this example of
[1:02:29] Christ but when you have a man that's
[1:02:31] dominating he's already
[1:02:33] perverting because if his in his
[1:02:35] Dominion he's dominating he's broken the
[1:02:38] order so for there to be a dominating
[1:02:39] female it's a double
[1:02:43] perversion but Christ
[1:02:46] headship as Christ even as Christ that
[1:02:50] must be our
[1:02:52] standard even as
[1:02:58] Christ and if you look at the example of
[1:03:04] Christ I want to we'll look at it in
[1:03:07] Greater detail I think next Sunday the
[1:03:10] Lord would allow us he's one that took
[1:03:15] responsibility to be a man you're not
[1:03:17] going to be selfish you're not going to
[1:03:18] act like a
[1:03:19] child you're it's not going to just be
[1:03:22] about
[1:03:23] you but there's going to be a looking
[1:03:26] outward and a realization that as the
[1:03:28] head I have the greatest
[1:03:32] responsibility as I close in John
[1:03:34] chapter 19: 4 and
[1:03:37] 5 it says pilate this is at the
[1:03:40] crucifixion of Christ at the time that
[1:03:42] he's crucified and he's being taken back
[1:03:44] and forth between rulers and tribunals
[1:03:47] pilate therefore went forth again and
[1:03:48] said unto them this is now what he says
[1:03:50] to the people behold I bring him forth
[1:03:53] to you that you may know that I find no
[1:03:56] fault in
[1:03:57] him why is there no fault because he's
[1:03:59] the
[1:04:01] truth says then came Jesus forth wearing
[1:04:05] the crown of
[1:04:07] thorns and the purple robe and it's this
[1:04:11] phrase and pilate saith unto them
[1:04:14] behold the
[1:04:16] man what a
[1:04:19] statement could you can we let this just
[1:04:21] sink in as we close this Christ who is
[1:04:25] the head of every
[1:04:27] man Christ who is the head of the
[1:04:30] church Christ who is the head of the
[1:04:33] body the one that the body serves the
[1:04:35] one to whom the woman is submissive to
[1:04:38] the one to whom the church is uh uh
[1:04:41] subject to in all things in that image
[1:04:43] now the man who is going to be the head
[1:04:46] of the woman has to do it like this man
[1:04:50] the man amen behold the man
[1:04:55] the man who has taken responsibility for
[1:04:57] whose Sins not his own but
[1:05:01] ours the one who said even though come
[1:05:04] on I hope you can get this even though
[1:05:06] I'm not at fault I'll take
[1:05:10] responsibility maybe I'm not directly at
[1:05:12] fault but I'll take responsibility I'll
[1:05:14] say that it starts with me and it also
[1:05:17] ends with me and I'm not going to pass
[1:05:20] it up what a statement to say behold the
[1:05:22] man amen and that's why we could see
[1:05:25] brother bradam saying it we could
[1:05:27] understand this statement with when we
[1:05:28] make it that a man or a father or a
[1:05:30] husband who won't stand his position is
[1:05:32] a poor excuse for a man because a man
[1:05:35] isn't always Burly a man isn't always
[1:05:37] Gruff a man isn't always a hunter a man
[1:05:39] isn't always in the masculine image we
[1:05:41] like to make him out to be guns and
[1:05:43] things and War and and flags and those
[1:05:45] things no no no no a man is one who's
[1:05:47] Christlike because that's the
[1:05:50] man the image of Christ the nature of
[1:05:53] Christ and brother Bram says about Jesus
[1:05:55] Christ and how can I overcome in the
[1:05:57] presence of hell he defeated hell and
[1:06:00] overcome hell yes in the presence of the
[1:06:02] Grave he overcome the grave he says why
[1:06:04] and he's asking how how did he do
[1:06:08] it right Five Hour Energy little bit of
[1:06:12] oricle rain or whatever it is did he did
[1:06:15] he pop some pills did he get psyched up
[1:06:17] did he play his fight song his walk how
[1:06:20] did he do it it was it training was it
[1:06:22] rigor was he was he strong was he
[1:06:24] smarter did he did he uh read sunsuits
[1:06:27] The Art of War how did he do it brother
[1:06:30] man says all by the word and
[1:06:34] humility how is it that men are going to
[1:06:37] be not just a male in a house but the
[1:06:40] man of the home by taking submitting
[1:06:42] ourselves to the word letting Christ the
[1:06:45] word be our head by the word and
[1:06:47] humility being subject ourselves and not
[1:06:51] just being humble to the word but humble
[1:06:53] enough to serve of those you're called
[1:06:54] to be ahead
[1:06:56] to says Oh by the word and humility oh
[1:06:59] my there's the real man that's right
[1:07:02] there's the one to make your example
[1:07:04] this is the example for men this is the
[1:07:07] man of the home this is the man that we
[1:07:09] want to make our example if I can say
[1:07:11] that this is the measure of a
[1:07:17] man and I'm when I talk about the man of
[1:07:20] the home I'm talking to the men that are
[1:07:22] here you young men are men in training
[1:07:25] there's a way you ought to conduct
[1:07:27] yourself I trust that you have examples
[1:07:29] in the home of how a man treats a
[1:07:31] woman kind of respect that a man ought
[1:07:34] to have for other
[1:07:35] people and I hope that you're beginning
[1:07:37] to realize now at the I hope the
[1:07:40] greatest
[1:07:41] realization is for men to
[1:07:47] recognize just how important their
[1:07:50] office
[1:07:52] is because if a woman serves God as she
[1:07:55] serves you if you're the wrong kind of
[1:07:57] head you put her in a very difficult
[1:07:59] spot that's right because a woman is to
[1:08:03] be a certain way and she's to live a
[1:08:05] certain way and she's to submit and she
[1:08:06] has to have an attitude of willing to be
[1:08:09] subject to your will you better be sure
[1:08:11] your will is the right
[1:08:13] one if she's going to yield to you you
[1:08:16] want to do everything you can to make it
[1:08:18] easy on her to
[1:08:21] yield not a pushover but neither is she
[1:08:24] to be a
[1:08:27] doormat brother Bram says and is your
[1:08:29] life worthy worthy of the Gospel may you
[1:08:31] men that's got wives and let them be the
[1:08:34] boss of the house and lead you around
[1:08:37] May the god of heaven give you
[1:08:39] Grace to set your foot down and bring
[1:08:41] the woman back to her right mind
[1:08:44] again and realize that that's your place
[1:08:47] in
[1:08:49] Christ what's it going to take the
[1:08:52] grace I he says says put your foot down
[1:08:55] you know it's not go home and be
[1:08:57] like right you say
[1:09:00] woman things are changing around
[1:09:03] here right that's not what he means he
[1:09:06] says realize your
[1:09:08] place not a boss but you are the head of
[1:09:12] the
[1:09:13] house the analogy the image even the
[1:09:16] example of a
[1:09:17] boss confuses this the
[1:09:20] picture because a boss doesn't have
[1:09:22] liability or doesn't loyalty to the
[1:09:25] employee he has loyalty to the
[1:09:28] stakeholders he has loyalty to the
[1:09:30] bottom
[1:09:31] line and he'll manipulate and
[1:09:34] abuse employees for his own
[1:09:37] bonus to make himself look good a boss
[1:09:41] like how can we make budget fire all
[1:09:42] those people right how can we increase
[1:09:45] our profit line fire those people get
[1:09:47] rid of benefits do this do that all at
[1:09:49] the expense of the employees that's
[1:09:51] right so to be a boss is the wrong image
[1:09:54] amen but you are the head of the house
[1:09:56] the lifegiver the leader The
[1:09:59] Protector the man of the
[1:10:03] home not just the guy in the
[1:10:06] room I'm stopping right in the middle of
[1:10:08] this thought let's Stand Together
