[2:47] message in French in Haiti but it became
[2:50] so difficult with all third world
[2:53] country and uh uh this strive you were
[2:56] burning tires and you know I saw so many
[2:59] things happen happening there and I have
[3:00] to stop but my brother Barry um couple

[3:11] brother helped me and we were able to
[3:13] print

[3:19] and so even this week he told me he said
[3:22] whenever you have need for Bible and uh
[3:26] crol or French he said let me know so uh
[3:32] well when we are in the will of God uh
[3:35] he take care of
[3:37] everything we don't have to worry and
[3:40] you know I have been in Haiti more than
[3:43] 7
[3:45] times so times and I used to say I am a
[3:50] white
[3:51] Haitian so you know in Haiti you know
[3:55] the Haitian people they dance they
[3:57] worship and you know when I'm with them
[4:00] and there is no Canadian or American
[4:04] with me I let go a little
[4:06] bit but but when there is
[4:10] another American or Canadian I froze a
[4:14] little bit you see brother Bram said the
[4:16] Canadian
[4:18] starchy I don't know but I'm
[4:21] Haitian I'm a Canadian Haitian so yeah I
[4:26] enjoy so much to be amongst them but it
[4:28] become so dangerous was two months ago
[4:31] we had a land project it's long story I
[4:34] cannot go in that and um you know and we
[4:38] it's 900 ft long more than 300 and we
[4:42] have already mango trees avocados banana
[4:46] trees uh lemon and all kind of stuff
[4:50] even we had tilapia fish but now the te
[4:54] invaded the country I had the last trip
[4:58] I did this three years ago and now um
[5:01] two months ago close I want to create a
[5:04] foundation you know we invested a lot of
[5:07] time and money and we have artisian well
[5:11] we have a generator we have everything
[5:14] everything to have a wonderful project
[5:18] and all the benefit I want to create a
[5:20] foundation all the benefit will go to
[5:22] buy Bible and to uh sponsor Ministry and
[5:27] on and on but now we are invaded by
[5:29] Thief so uh my um the famous Thief that
[5:34] kidnapped uh 17 American couple years
[5:38] ago I think one or two years ago they
[5:41] they are my neighbors if you complain
[5:44] about bad neighbors think about
[5:47] me so
[5:49] um and uh two months ago the uh two
[5:53] guyss the um thieves they kill each
[5:58] other right five minute walking from its
[6:01] its outskirt of P of Prince and from
[6:04] there there there was a I have the video
[6:06] I will not show that there is 50 people
[6:09] dead P dead
[6:11] Corps and uh that's the story with Hai
[6:14] so uh
[6:17] anyhow
[6:20] um so uh you know the
[6:24] message I will think most of you and
[6:28] brother Brenham said in the fifth seal
[6:30] he said the very thing that church is
[6:33] watering that is the seed the seed of
[6:36] the word it's the very word that become
[6:40] alive and carry us to our
[6:43] unseen
[6:45] bridegroom so it's so important to feed
[6:49] on the word yes amen so important um
[6:54] there was I read the story in Arizona
[6:59] year years ago there was uh there were
[7:01] two uh two men they were gold prospector
[7:06] and they were searching for gold and so
[7:10] it's many years ago and they they were
[7:13] they built a little Shack you know in
[7:15] little cabins and they were uh wandering
[7:18] in desert and trying to find gold and U
[7:22] one of them has relative and so they
[7:25] were close to each other and they were
[7:28] buddies and and uh so it's happened that
[7:31] one day one of them died and his friend
[7:37] um uh told the family he said I bury him
[7:41] he died and if you want to come and have
[7:45] what he had in his uh Little Shack he
[7:49] said you are welcome to come and so they
[7:52] came and they went in the Little Shack
[7:55] and there were there was old furniture
[7:59] uh oil lamp with the kerosene we say and
[8:04] nothing of valuable and so they took
[8:07] whatever they want and so they were
[8:11] leaving and U so in their car and so he
[8:15] he approached them he said do you mind
[8:18] he said did you
[8:19] take everything you want yeah yeah yeah
[8:22] he said do you mind if I go and I um I
[8:26] take the rest of what there is in the
[8:29] house oh he said no problems just go and
[8:32] so he went and he pushed the table and
[8:36] there is a wood board he lifted up and
[8:39] there was gold in that he gather gold
[8:44] since 53 years and he had enough gold to
[8:49] build a
[8:51] palace and
[8:53] so he looked there was only one window
[8:57] he looked through the window and he was
[8:59] thinking hm If Only They knew him
[9:03] better that money will be their theirs
[9:07] right and I was thinking when I read
[9:09] that story in colossian chapter 2 it's
[9:13] it's written in
[9:16] Christ in whom are hide all the Treasure
[9:22] of wisdom and knowledge and now I
[9:27] address to you if you know him better
[9:29] better it will belongs to you everything
[9:34] you know when we know him better we we
[9:38] belong there is no word to say what we
[9:42] belongs to know him
[9:45] better um there is a little um there is
[9:50] a fact very
[9:52] fascinating about beasts uh the Queens
[9:57] lays eggs in the lay labors and the
[10:00] labors put them in a special
[10:04] alveolus and feed them three days with
[10:08] Royal
[10:09] jelly after those three days they feed
[10:14] them with regular honey and they become
[10:18] labor Beast you see three days like
[10:22] justification
[10:24] sanctification but they need couple
[10:27] others Queens so they select some
[10:30] regular eggs and feed them the same
[10:33] thing with Royal jelly But after those
[10:36] three days they continue on and feed
[10:39] them with this royal jelly till they
[10:44] became fully complete but with the
[10:48] special food their DNN change and they
[10:52] became become
[10:55] Queens you see just they were could be a
[11:01] regular uh labor beast but because they
[11:04] eat something special their DNA change
[11:09] and they become
[11:12] Queens if you
[11:14] eat the Queen's food
[11:17] yesen hey what are you you become the
[11:22] word you eat the word you become the
[11:24] word you are
[11:26] transformed my wife she find a
[11:29] caterpillar you know I was raised on the
[11:32] farms so you see I use a lot of stories
[11:35] whatever so and she knows
[11:38] that and my wife find a catapillar a big
[11:43] one and she um she put in a uh jar with
[11:48] grass and a little branch and uh so the
[11:52] catapiller was eating and after a day or
[11:56] two we look at the in this jar so the
[12:00] caterpillar disappear and she built a c
[12:05] cocon you know you have to understand
[12:08] what I mean not what I say
[12:11] cocon yeah sometime uh instead saying
[12:14] the massage I say the
[12:18] massage so I think the massage is a good
[12:22] massage
[12:25] too so um there is a sister she said she
[12:30] tried to practice me she brother Andre
[12:32] it's not massage it's massage message
[12:36] whatever and
[12:38] so and the
[12:40] cuong um the caterpillar uh once in a
[12:44] while was making a little move so I was
[12:48] oh it's still alive you know not often
[12:51] but
[12:51] some and one day outside of this cuck
[12:56] came a beautiful but
[13:00] butly I was thinking hey it's exactly
[13:04] the type our types we were something
[13:08] else and we decided to hide in
[13:11] Christ from this world you know we we
[13:15] change so we are not anymore in this
[13:19] world though we are living in this world
[13:21] we
[13:22] disappear and one of those day we will
[13:25] be a beautiful caterpillar and we'll
[13:28] take our wings to the
[13:30] Lord
[13:33] amen um for the kids you know I have a
[13:36] story for the kids how many kids here
[13:38] would like to have a story oh just one
[13:42] or two okay
[13:45] so we are all
[13:48] kids so um there was a little boy who
[13:52] was maybe 10 and he likes his grandpa
[13:56] like Manu H Manu you like your
[13:59] grandpa yeah he said yeah agree so he's
[14:02] right and so um his grandpa brought him
[14:07] to his Chalet close to a river and so uh
[14:11] just for a couple days and every
[14:15] morning the the papa the grandpa was
[14:17] reading his Bible and his little uh
[14:22] grandson uh likes to do the same and he
[14:25] has his little Bible and he was reading
[14:28] and one day he said
[14:30] Grandpa what is the need for me to read
[14:33] the Bible I understand about nothing and
[14:36] I forget about what I'm I I
[14:39] read and he said the grandpa has a lot
[14:43] of wisdom he said now he said um uh I
[14:47] want you to pick this basket it was a
[14:51] charcoal basket he said you take the
[14:54] basket and you go to the river right in
[14:57] front of the Chalet he said bring me
[14:58] water so the little lad of course he has
[15:02] a great respect for his grandpa and he
[15:04] took the basket and he ran to the water
[15:07] and when he came there was just a little
[15:10] bit of dropping
[15:13] water and he said Grandpa he said I
[15:17] cannot bring water he said you have to
[15:20] go faster so he went and he came back
[15:24] the same result and uh so finally he
[15:28] said said Grandpa he said I think it
[15:31] will be better if I use a bucket no he
[15:34] said no so go and another time so he
[15:38] went of course it was the same result
[15:40] now and the grandpa put the the basket
[15:43] on the table he said do you see a differ
[15:47] in the in the in the the
[15:50] basket so he look he said yeah he said
[15:54] now the basket is
[15:57] clean
[16:00] and he told him he said you see that's
[16:03] the same way with reading the word the
[16:06] word washed
[16:07] you the word washed you so you will
[16:11] remember that story H yeah I
[16:15] hope uh okay now we we are going toward
[16:19] our subject you know uh I like to relax
[16:23] myself before you know that's first time
[16:27] uh I'm preaching here
[16:30] um
[16:32] so when we approach
[16:36] God we have to have in our mind that he
[16:40] is the
[16:42] Creator
[16:44] and he is the owner of our house I
[16:49] attended the funeral in haii and um the
[16:52] pastor was saying he said now he said if
[16:57] you rent the house and the owner come
[17:00] and he said I want back my house you
[17:02] have to give me back the keys you give
[17:05] the keys because it doesn't belongs to
[17:08] you but when we we approach god with
[17:12] humility and said Lord You Are My
[17:16] Creator I don't belong to myself you
[17:20] could belong to yourself but it's better
[17:22] if you belongs to God and you realize it
[17:26] amen so
[17:30] today I want to speak on the title of my
[17:34] sermon is
[17:37] humility humility and humility
[17:41] hide the power of
[17:45] God we'll see that so if you don't mind
[17:49] to uh stand up and we're going to read I
[17:53] don't know if they have time to to place
[17:55] the scripture one Peter uh no I think I
[17:58] didn't give that scripture one
[18:01] Peter chapter
[18:05] 5 and verse five and
[18:14] six I'm going to drink a little
[18:24] bit
[18:26] likewise e younger yourself onto the
[18:30] Elder yeah all of you be subject one to
[18:35] another and be clot with
[18:40] humility for God resist the proud and
[18:44] give grace to the humble humble yourself
[18:47] therefore under the mighty hand of God
[18:51] that he may exalt You In Due Time In Due
[18:55] Time amen let us pray Heavenly Father
[18:58] father we approach your word this
[19:00] morning and we invite you to come and to
[19:04] change the water into wine for our lives
[19:09] we pray that uh we pray that you will be
[19:12] with us and anoy uh those um lips of
[19:16] clay and that it will be for your glory
[19:20] in Jesus name we pray amen you may
[19:24] sit I start with a quote of humble th s
[19:29] he said you know people want power and
[19:33] really that's very good and really don't
[19:36] know what power is see they don't really
[19:39] know what goes with it the Way Up Is
[19:43] Down always if you want Power see how
[19:47] humble you can get just get away from
[19:50] all your worthy thinking and humble
[19:52] yourself before God and then you have
[19:55] got more power than the man that's from
[19:58] all over the building and makes a big
[20:00] lot of noise see because you have been
[20:03] able to conquer
[20:06] yourself you see the worst enemy is not
[20:10] the devil it's to conquer
[20:13] yourself and commit yourself to Christ
[20:16] you see to humble yourself before him
[20:21] that's really
[20:25] power uh you all heard about Napoleon so
[20:31] Napoleon overcome the
[20:33] world it was a mighty uh con concurent I
[20:38] don't know the word but the thing is
[20:40] that he could not conquer himself he
[20:43] died
[20:46] drunk you see was Asia to to conquer the
[20:51] whole world but not
[20:54] himself
[20:57] so
[20:59] I like to uh give illustration once
[21:02] again for kids will be your
[21:06] turn um we
[21:09] all our worst enemy is our
[21:14] flesh you see the Bible say our flesh
[21:18] will not submit to the spirit and the
[21:21] spirit there is a conflict a constant
[21:23] conflict and that's what make us
[21:26] sometime a measurable
[21:28] life yeah but uh Sometimes some people
[21:32] they would like to be perfect in their
[21:34] flesh and uh and they work like works
[21:39] but you know we are saved by grace and
[21:42] even brother Brenham said he said I
[21:46] confess my sins every day more than one
[21:49] a day you know it's it's it's our battle
[21:54] this flesh you know but we are so
[21:58] thankful that the Lord Jesus was In the
[22:00] Flesh and he was tempted in in every
[22:03] matters but you see uh to be tempted is
[22:07] not sin right you have to know the
[22:10] difference so there was a little boy
[22:12] that he would like to have a dog and one
[22:15] day his dad find a little dog you see a
[22:19] puppy I don't know how you call that a
[22:22] little dog andhow was a a mix of between
[22:25] the wolf and and a dog so his D was
[22:30] thinking it will not matter if it's a
[22:32] dog you know like four legs and a tail
[22:35] that's okay and so uh but the little boy
[22:39] like it so much that he feed him in his
[22:42] own dish and he was sleeping with this
[22:46] little uh dog and you know and he teach
[22:49] him uh things to obey and this dog
[22:54] became a big dog it was a big a big a a
[22:58] big one and so one day
[23:02] um they forget to close the gates of the
[23:05] chicken
[23:06] yard and so this dog wolf or wolf dog
[23:12] when he saw that it just jumped and
[23:16] killed 40
[23:18] chicken
[23:20] so when his dad saw that he was not very
[23:24] happy and he was thinking he said Son
[23:28] he
[23:29] said you will have to get away you get
[23:33] out of this this dog wolf dog he will
[23:37] never be a domestic dog no no no papa he
[23:42] because I I never teach him so is that b
[23:45] other chicken and U so the little boy
[23:49] started to um uh to teach him you know
[23:54] and so um he was thinking King he said
[23:58] okay so he teach him and to he was very
[24:01] obedient and so one day he went he
[24:04] opened the the the door of that place
[24:07] the gate and so his a big fellow came
[24:11] with him and as soon as he said the
[24:14] chicken he said no
[24:17] s and he sat
[24:19] down and he look at his master he said
[24:22] lay down and he did and so he waited and
[24:28] after he went back and the next day did
[24:32] the same
[24:33] thing sit down lay down be quiet and he
[24:38] left and he did that couple days and
[24:41] every time he was leaving one or two
[24:44] minutes outside of the place and so he
[24:47] was checking the dog and the dog lay on
[24:50] the ground and when he was calling him
[24:52] back come he was coming back and after
[24:57] so many
[24:58] days he told his daddy dad he said come
[25:02] to see that so his daddy came and he did
[25:06] the same thing come sit down lay down
[25:10] and he
[25:11] left so his dad was looking at that he
[25:14] said nothing
[25:16] happened so his dad
[25:19] was wow it's amazing so finally I ask
[25:25] you the question you don't have to
[25:27] answer
[25:28] but uh do you think that his nature
[25:33] changed that's good but the thing is the
[25:37] relation he had with his master was
[25:42] greater than the flesh
[25:45] desire you see that's the same thing
[25:48] with us you see our relation with our
[25:53] Master is greater than the flesh
[25:56] desire
[25:58] amen so one of the biggest gift of
[26:01] brother brenham's life was the capacity
[26:04] to heal completely himself to God's
[26:09] ways to be humble it's not to be
[26:13] sh that's good to have
[26:16] complex no to be humble is to have a
[26:20] modest opinion of your own
[26:24] person to be humble is not looking to
[26:27] for praise to popular or to be first but
[26:31] it's more looking for the less nuttiest
[26:35] places to be humble it's not lift
[26:39] yourself up in the eyes of others but
[26:42] more to look up to
[26:44] others you see we saw that in in brother
[26:47] brenham's life you know he was always
[26:50] saying oh you are you are the one I'm
[26:53] nothing you see a humble person is the
[26:57] the
[26:58] one that forget about himself and that
[27:02] rather put his attention on
[27:05] God and
[27:07] others yeah I remember years ago I was
[27:11] working in architecture's office and one
[27:14] morning we're speaking about humility
[27:17] and there was my next buddies and he
[27:20] started to say well he said I think I'm
[27:22] a humble he said if I um if I look at my
[27:27] life he said uh yeah he said um I'm
[27:29] quite humble man so I turn around and
[27:32] said hey I said that's the first time I
[27:34] ever heard a man bragging to be
[27:40] humble you see to be humble consists of
[27:44] evaluating ourself in our sinful nature
[27:49] in the light of the Holiness of
[27:54] God amen amen and and uh you know the
[27:59] Publican and the Pharisees and we're
[28:01] going to read it
[28:03] um it's Luke 18 were perfect and he
[28:07] spake this Parable unto certain which
[28:10] trust in themselves that they were
[28:12] righteous and despise others two men
[28:15] went up into the temple to pray the one
[28:18] the Pharisees and the other Publican the
[28:20] Pharisees stood and prayed thus with
[28:22] himself God I thank thee that I'm not as
[28:26] other men exort oners onjust Alit
[28:31] tourist or even at as this Publican I
[28:36] fast twice in a week I gave title of all
[28:40] that I possess and the Publican standing
[28:43] a far off would not lift up so much as
[28:47] his eyes onto heaven but smold upon his
[28:50] breath saying God be merciful to me a
[28:53] sinner I tell you this man went down to
[28:57] his house Justified rather than the
[28:59] other for everyone that exalt himself
[29:03] shall be Obe and he that humble himself
[29:07] shall be ex
[29:11] exalted
[29:13] so that's a
[29:15] scripture and the thing is that in every
[29:19] man here and woman there is a Pharisees
[29:23] and a
[29:26] publican yes yeah you see the Pharisees
[29:30] attitude dress in his own justice of
[29:34] well spread words despising the poor
[29:38] Publican standing closed of the altar
[29:42] walk out Condon rejected of God but
[29:46] remember the old woman um okay rejected
[29:49] of God but
[29:51] remember uh the story of brother Branham
[29:54] he went to a restaurant and there were
[29:56] police and men that play uh toomic
[30:00] machine that was forbidden and there was
[30:02] a old woman she looked like a prostitute
[30:05] and so brother Brenham was looking at
[30:08] them so he was like a
[30:10] Pharisees
[30:12] sure yeah even if he was a prophet you
[30:16] know and every man there is a Pharisees
[30:19] and a Publican and so you remember the
[30:23] story and so the Lord has to help
[30:25] him to
[30:27] [Music]
[30:28] to to showed him the truth the
[30:36] reality okay
[30:41] so Jesus said a man made a great supper
[30:46] send his servant to invite all and they
[30:50] all make excuse oh I
[30:54] brought um a piece of ground
[30:57] I must see it and others say I brought
[31:00] five yolk of oxen I go to prove them I
[31:04] just married I cannot go and the master
[31:08] onry go to the street and and and invite
[31:13] Lambs
[31:15] um people pour lambs and you know any
[31:19] kind of people
[31:21] and you see it's strange like we know
[31:25] that uh uh um brother Bram said the last
[31:30] pool will be for the unsafe people
[31:33] completely but a gift of love you know
[31:37] it's will be something that we don't
[31:39] know exactly how what will be but you
[31:43] see um I was reading a book of a man of
[31:46] God a century ago and the U there was a
[31:51] trump and he was smelling bad and was so
[31:55] dirty and he he came in the chur church
[31:57] and and he was a drunker and all kind of
[32:00] the worst sin and the church they threw
[32:03] him out and this man was a man of God so
[32:08] he he took him in and he start to to
[32:12] pray and fast and pray for him for days
[32:16] and finally So This Man became converted
[32:20] and became a wonderful man of God and he
[32:24] was married with with a woman he was not
[32:26] leaving with her but she was so um so
[32:31] dirty and they they they have to wash
[32:34] five six time in the water tub you know
[32:37] to to clean her and she was vulgar and
[32:40] full of bad Spirit but because they have
[32:44] a
[32:44] love and they they were able to uh to
[32:48] bring her to the lights you see and uh
[32:52] because this man has not a Pharisees
[32:54] attitude you know if you have this
[32:57] Pharisees attitude you will not go
[33:00] towards
[33:02] people you will not towards uh poor
[33:05] people on the street begging for money
[33:08] or drugs you say no we are message
[33:12] believer you see so you have a Pharisees
[33:16] and a Publican inside of you so my
[33:19] friend Oscar make it God bless you
[33:23] Oscar I met him a couple years ago
[33:28] I was in the desert and was doing some
[33:30] jogging and I saw he was painting a
[33:33] house outside of uh uh what's the
[33:38] name
[33:40] surprise and so I was doing some jogging
[33:44] came in the front of the house where I
[33:46] was singing he was in the front of the
[33:48] house and he said I have a message U
[33:52] from God for you I said really yeah
[33:55] stranger I said said I do have also a
[33:58] message of God for you anyhow so we
[34:01] cannot go through the the whole story
[34:03] but anyhow so I gave him um the
[34:07] supernatural books of brother Brenham
[34:09] the seal seven church and he believe
[34:11] that brother Brenham is a prophet of God
[34:14] any he's here this morning and he want
[34:16] to take his water baptism one day so uh
[34:20] that's a the the best ever decision you
[34:26] do in your life amen amen so
[34:30] now how is born humility humility is
[34:34] born when you are contemp the Holiness
[34:37] of God in comparison to your sinful
[34:41] human
[34:41] nature you see the vision of Isaiah
[34:45] chapter 6 The King's usza uh was a great
[34:50] influence to Isaiah the prophet but
[34:53] Isaiah has a need of a a greater
[34:56] revelation
[34:57] of how God is and I think we all need
[35:01] that too
[35:03] to to acknowledge how God is and he saw
[35:09] in Heavenly scene he saw the Lord
[35:11] sitting on Throne his train filled the
[35:14] temple and there were Holy Angel sarapin
[35:18] with wings flying and they were crying
[35:20] holy holy holy is the Lord and the post
[35:25] of the door move and he said wo to me I
[35:29] am a man of unclean
[35:31] lips dwell in the midst of people of
[35:35] unclean lips for my eyes has seen the
[35:41] king and you know the story and an angel
[35:45] fly and came with the live call from The
[35:49] Altar and he laid it upon his mouth he
[35:52] said th sins is taken away
[35:57] and we all know that's a type of the
[36:00] sacrifice of Jesus and when you touch us
[36:04] it's clean Us Clean us so humility set
[36:10] us see our state of deprivation and the
[36:13] certain condemnation that we Merit our
[36:16] as Sinners humility should be the first
[36:19] characteristic of a Christian Life
[36:22] without humility there is no Christ amen
[36:26] that's right you see we saw that the
[36:30] publicans attitude brought God In Action
[36:32] we're going to see order when Daniel
[36:36] took saot and Ashes fasting and
[36:41] humiliating in confession of his sin
[36:45] this brought the angel Gabrielle on the
[36:48] scene when the Centurion had the sick
[36:52] servant asked Jesus for the healing of
[36:55] his servant he told him that he wasn't
[36:58] worthy that Jesus came under his roof
[37:01] but rather he would speak the word that
[37:04] brought God In
[37:06] Action you see humility and
[37:09] Faith when the Sho phenician woman asked
[37:13] Jesus to chase the demon out of her
[37:15] daughter and he answered her that it
[37:19] wasn't good to take the little children
[37:21] bread to throw it onto the little dogs
[37:26] that brought God In
[37:31] Action when Abraham pleaded with God to
[37:34] spare Sodom if he would find 50 just he
[37:38] humbled himself when he said here I dare
[37:41] speak to the Lord me who is nothing but
[37:44] Potter in
[37:46] hashes and God kept listening to his re
[37:51] request up to 10 that brought God In
[37:55] Action God God is attracted by humility
[38:00] right Isaiah chapter
[38:03] 62 verse two but to this man will I look
[38:08] even to him that is poor and of a
[38:13] contrite spirit and tremble at my
[38:17] word Matthew chapter 53 said bless all
[38:21] the poor in spirit who have a humble
[38:25] Spirit who acknowledge their spiritual
[38:30] poverty for theirs is the Kingdom of
[38:34] Heaven on the opposite God hate Pride
[38:38] right Proverbs 6 verse 16 and 17 these
[38:43] six things do the Lord hate yeah seven
[38:48] are in Abomination unto him a proud look
[38:54] is the first thing mentioned
[39:00] first
[39:05] Mansion proverb
[39:07] 18 8 sorry verse 13 pride and arrogancy
[39:14] do I
[39:21] hate so when the the King Herod
[39:27] uh showed before the people in Royal uh
[39:31] appearance and sat upon his throne and
[39:34] his spoke and he brag himself and the
[39:38] people standing there shout and the and
[39:42] and they say voice of God and not of man
[39:46] you see he was bragging himself so an
[39:50] angel right away Smite him because he
[39:54] gave not glory to God God and he was
[39:57] eaten of worms and died right on the
[40:01] spot Proverbs 16 verse5 everyone that is
[40:06] proud in his heart is an Abomination to
[40:09] the
[40:11] Lord that's a big word
[40:15] Abomination he shall not be
[40:18] unpunished you remember the story of
[40:23] Uzziah when he was strong the king of
[40:28] Israel and U his art was lifted
[40:34] up to his
[40:36] destruction uh he
[40:39] transgressed the law of and he sinned
[40:42] against the Lord and He took he he took
[40:44] the um he brought the burn incense in in
[40:47] the temple and and he burned it and the
[40:50] priest aaria there were 18 other uh uh
[40:55] sacrification and they tried to hand him
[40:57] no don't do that don't do that he did it
[41:00] anyhow and so right away um he was Smite
[41:06] and leprosy when in his head you see the
[41:11] scripture now even brother Brenham spoke
[41:14] about Ministry you know he said uh uh
[41:17] what we have to watch a Ministry and
[41:19] it's good for everyone um proud woman
[41:23] and
[41:24] money so in the book of the Prophet
[41:27] Daniel when the king
[41:29] neb I don't know how to pronounce that
[41:32] lifted his heart and became arogant he
[41:35] was cast down of his throne and became
[41:38] fool as an animal for seven years so
[41:42] that he will
[41:43] recognize that the Supreme God has
[41:46] dominion over
[41:49] men and that he gave it to whom he wants
[41:54] to after that God established him again
[41:59] when he
[42:00] recognize and we have all to recognize
[42:03] that God has Supremacy over
[42:06] us however his son Bazar even though he
[42:10] knew these things those things the
[42:13] prophet told him you didn't humble your
[42:16] hearts you lift yourself against the
[42:19] Lord you didn't glorify The God Who has
[42:23] your breath and all your ways in his
[42:25] hand and you took the vessel of his
[42:28] house feasted with concubines it was the
[42:33] Feast of Bazar and a hand appear on the
[42:37] wall and wrote many many take present
[42:40] numbered weight and divided and the same
[42:43] night Darius the Midian took over his
[42:46] kingdom why humility because God is the
[42:50] Creator and because he still move in his
[42:55] creation
[42:57] he still moving your lives amen you
[43:00] became a Christian you were
[43:02] baptized but don't give up and do say
[43:05] okay now I'm okay no you have to
[43:08] understand that he move he want to move
[43:11] on your life amen amen why God so hate
[43:15] Pride because Pride doesn't recognize
[43:18] the supremacy of
[43:20] God and you know we can say it's what's
[43:23] good for those people but what's about
[43:25] you yes
[43:27] she is responsible for the third of of
[43:30] the Angel
[43:31] Falls first of all satan Lucifer who was
[43:35] a protector shubin with the deploy Wings
[43:38] fell you heart lift him itself because
[43:43] of your beauty and you consider your
[43:45] will as the will of
[43:48] God you see we have the same proud
[43:51] Spirit today even amongst denomination
[43:54] they have a certain proud project or
[43:56] they want to do that they want to do
[43:58] that you see in this but they consider
[44:01] their will as the will of God that's a
[44:04] big mistake yes right that's the reason
[44:07] why we have to pray the prophet said
[44:09] don't pray before don't decide anything
[44:13] before praying right to make sure that
[44:16] you will be in the will of
[44:18] God and see and you said in your heart I
[44:22] will rise to Heaven I will lift my
[44:25] throne above the star of God I will be
[44:29] equal to the god most high but you were
[44:32] cast down into hers so here he is in
[44:37] Eden inviting Eve to eat of his tree you
[44:42] will be like
[44:45] God knowing good and evil his word
[44:50] carried hell's poison right destroying
[44:54] humility and the need to depend in on
[44:59] God Rebellion Pride these are El's and
[45:03] fluence trying to bring each of us
[45:13] down the first Adam took us in the arm
[45:17] of the tempter with the same pride of
[45:20] Independence and
[45:22] Rebellion you see if you are independent
[45:28] it's
[45:32] Pride the second Adam came to bring his
[45:36] power to live a life of
[45:38] humility of submission and
[45:43] dependence the greatest character of
[45:46] Christ if I ask you what was the
[45:48] greatest characteristic of Christ you
[45:51] have maybe something in mind was his
[45:54] humility Philippian 2 verse
[45:59] 5-9 let this mind be in you which was
[46:02] also in Christ Jesus who being in the
[46:05] form of God brought it not robbery to be
[46:09] equal with God but made himself of no
[46:13] reputation and took upon him the form of
[46:16] a servant and was made in the likeness
[46:19] of men and being found in fashion as a
[46:23] man he humble himself
[46:27] and became obedient unto death even the
[46:30] death of the Cross wherefore God also
[46:33] had highly exalt him and give him a name
[46:37] which is above every
[46:39] name you see Christ is God humility
[46:44] dwelling in human
[46:47] nature Jesus was entirely submitted to
[46:51] the father in humility and this in his
[46:54] submission was
[46:58] total the son does nothing of his
[47:03] own he is not it is not me that do the
[47:07] works but the father in me I do nothing
[47:11] of my
[47:12] own my teaching is not from me I do not
[47:17] search for my own Glory I didn't come of
[47:20] my
[47:22] own but him who sent me the word that I
[47:27] tell you I don't say them by my own I
[47:30] always do what is pleasing to the father
[47:35] you see when I sometime you hear people
[47:40] oh we have to be more power we have to
[47:43] be more healing we have to to have more
[47:46] uh gift and whatever hey start to be
[47:49] humble and it will come to you
[47:51] yes brother Bram said never search for
[47:55] gifts or Supernatural if you humble
[47:58] yourself amen you see Jesus he said I do
[48:02] nothing by my own are you over
[48:08] Jesus you see he said he didn't have his
[48:13] own will but he wanted God's be the all
[48:17] in
[48:18] all he has forsaken his will completely
[48:23] so that God will be all in in
[48:28] him it teach us where through humility
[48:31] take its rise and find his stren in the
[48:34] knowledge that is God work all in all
[48:40] yes and that our place is to yield to
[48:45] him in perfect resignation and
[48:47] dependence Amen in full consent to be
[48:52] and to do nothing of ourself
[49:00] amen Jesus gave a teaching he said take
[49:03] my yoke upon you and learn of me we want
[49:07] to learn of him right learn of me for I
[49:11] am meek and lonely in heart and ye F
[49:14] shall find rest unto your souls yes amen
[49:19] we want to learn that Lord humility is
[49:21] the secret of divine rest yes
[49:26] wow you see and our example is the
[49:31] humility of Christ humility is the mark
[49:34] of divinity the more you humble the
[49:37] closer to God you are you see you you
[49:41] become just a big
[49:43] nothing you don't have to defend
[49:46] yourself you don't have to prove
[49:49] nothing you just stay humble and you
[49:53] give glory to God you see I was in Haiti
[49:57] a couple years ago and after the Matthew
[50:01] hurricane that stroke the south of the
[50:04] island everything was destroyed it
[50:06] looked like atomic bomb you know it was
[50:08] so terrible and there was um I rent to
[50:12] the little pickup truck and because
[50:15] there were so many tees we were four
[50:17] five uh five brothers together so I
[50:20] loaded this little pickup truck with
[50:22] rice oil and
[50:26] nled salt and money so I brought some
[50:30] money and so and there were teas on the
[50:33] road sometime they were attacking people
[50:36] to get whatsoever they were bringing to
[50:38] help and so we prayed
[50:42] and so we uh we arrive in the South and
[50:47] uh to get to a place called
[50:50] ciron um um other places that I didn't
[50:55] called we have to cross a river so uh we
[50:59] arrive in the front of the river but the
[51:01] river has no Bridge so we saw a car half
[51:04] in the water and people pushing the cars
[51:07] try to but we're thinking where to go
[51:10] suddenly two guys start running ahead of
[51:13] us and they were running hey we we just
[51:15] followed them it was just this I and
[51:19] when we arrive in the South we give oil
[51:21] and whatsoever we have help with some
[51:25] people and one placees they showed me he
[51:28] said here it was the church I said where
[51:32] was the church you know the wind
[51:35] vanished you could not see anything
[51:38] that's where the church was it was
[51:40] terrible and so after couple hours we
[51:43] went back because we need a place to
[51:46] stay to sleep and uh we came to that
[51:49] River but now the the level of the river
[51:54] was this high oh I said wow and we saw
[51:59] uh it was already dark and we saw two
[52:02] guys the other side they they tried to
[52:04] cross the river and one disappeared in
[52:07] the water there was current and so the
[52:10] other one took him disappear again they
[52:12] were fighting we were we were looking
[52:15] they were drowned but finally I don't
[52:18] know but they were able to make it so
[52:20] they cross and uh so we look at the
[52:24] scene and the brother they said what are
[52:25] we going to do I said I know what to do
[52:30] so they look at me I said get out of
[52:32] this pickup truck they did we went
[52:35] behind on the side the river was here
[52:38] and I said this very easy when you don't
[52:41] know what to do you pray
[52:44] yeah sometime people you know they they
[52:47] scratch their head and this search for
[52:50] solution but they forget to pray so I
[52:53] said I guess because I had the I am the
[52:57] one who get the inspiration well I guess
[52:59] I should pray so I start to pray I said
[53:02] Heavenly Father Here we are and we don't
[53:05] know what to do and I don't want to know
[53:09] what to
[53:10] do but please lead us in the name of the
[53:14] Lord Jesus yeah and when I look at them
[53:17] at them I said you know what I feel good
[53:20] there is a song in h they saying I feel
[53:23] good good good I don't I didn't and
[53:25] start dancing
[53:26] [Music]
[53:27] but you know I should show you some
[53:31] video in Hai you would say hey they know
[53:33] how to worship and you know I said uh
[53:36] well I said I feel really relaxed but I
[53:40] don't have any problems you see I give
[53:43] you an example suppose a man has a
[53:46] little girl and she's coming from school
[53:49] and she come to her dad she said Papa
[53:53] that's French English too
[53:55] she say papa I have so much problem at
[53:59] school a little girl pushed to me and
[54:02] she pull my hair my hair not my ha my
[54:05] hair it's better why she can do the b in
[54:10] and and uh if the father say hey you
[54:15] know what you don't know what kind of
[54:17] day I had I had problems over my head so
[54:22] you have your problem I have my problem
[54:25] keep your problem I keep my problems no
[54:28] it doesn't work that way because the
[54:31] problem of your kids is your
[54:34] problems so now I teach that I baptize a
[54:37] young man from Venezuela and Dominican
[54:39] Republic he live there now I baptize him
[54:41] and I teach him since three four years
[54:45] we are in touch and I BL Spanish
[54:48] so much
[54:51] Spanish amig I I learned a lot of
[54:54] Spanish but I teach him I said dingon
[54:58] you don't have
[55:01] problems and I explained why because you
[55:04] are the son of your
[55:07] father and you have a right to say papa
[55:10] yeah you have a problem yeah your son is
[55:15] sick your son has no money that's not my
[55:19] problem you are my dad you are my father
[55:22] you promised to take care of me so you
[55:25] get rid of your
[55:27] problem and you start praising your
[55:30] father you said you have unlimited
[55:33] power I will be submit to you so father
[55:37] that's your problems yes you see that's
[55:40] exactly the scripture in other
[55:44] word so where I was now yeah okay uh
[55:49] Jesus gave a lesson to his disciple who
[55:52] asked who is the greatest in the Kingdom
[55:55] om so he plays a little child whosoever
[55:58] therefore shall humble himself at this
[56:02] little child the same is greater in the
[56:05] kingdom of
[56:07] heaven when Jesus Took the last supper
[56:12] with his disciple they were discussing
[56:15] to know who was the greater amongst
[56:19] them after three years of
[56:23] teaching they were slow
[56:26] and he gave them an
[56:28] example by washing their
[56:32] feet and he said if ye know these things
[56:36] happy are ye if ye
[56:39] do them you see washing the feet it's
[56:43] not like we we know there is three
[56:45] ordinance uh foot washing communion and
[56:48] baptism okay I agree yes but if you go
[56:52] behind that and you see they were
[56:56] discussing who is the greatest one and
[56:58] Jesus humbled himself and he gave them a
[57:01] lesson he said be a servant of all and
[57:03] you know to wash the feet was the lowest
[57:06] job you can do he give an example he say
[57:10] happy will you be when you will do it
[57:13] you say happy you will be when you will
[57:16] do it to toward your brothers and
[57:22] sisters amen
[57:26] okay uh one more time happiness depend
[57:29] on humility he said receive my
[57:33] instruction for I am meek and lowly
[57:36] humble in heart and you shall find rest
[57:39] unto your
[57:41] soul humility and
[57:44] rest there is a big Link in that because
[57:49] where you when you are humble could you
[57:52] imagine a life where you have nothing to
[57:54] prove
[57:55] to defend
[57:58] yourself uh to compare with
[58:01] others and you know even the prophets
[58:03] was saying he said if you don't agree
[58:07] with me take it as in your and that does
[58:11] that knows no
[58:12] better you
[58:14] see when you you humble yourself nothing
[58:17] to prove and and even brother brah said
[58:21] a Christian will guil will plad guilt if
[58:25] even is not that because that's
[58:28] humility a new Joy will be found if you
[58:31] give your life as a servant and slave of
[58:36] God by being servant to one and
[58:40] another that's what Christianity is you
[58:44] just you don't just come to church on
[58:46] Sunday and say God bless you if you know
[58:49] there is somebody that is a need you see
[58:53] happy will you be if you put put in it
[58:56] into
[58:57] practice amen and Jesus said there is
[59:01] more joy to give than to
[59:03] receive now there is a scripture to find
[59:06] if really you possess humility in John
[59:09] chap 4 verse 20 said if a man say I love
[59:13] God and hate his brother he is a liar
[59:17] for he that lovees not his brother whom
[59:20] he s seen he had seen how can he love
[59:24] God whom he had not
[59:27] seen you see it's the same thing with
[59:30] humility it's easy to think that we
[59:33] humble ourself before God but our
[59:37] attitude of humility before men's is the
[59:40] only proof that your humility before God
[59:44] is
[59:48] genuine Paul to the Roman there is many
[59:52] scripture but I just take a he he said
[59:55] our chapter Roman chapter 12: 10 be
[59:59] kindly affection one to
[1:00:05] another with Brotherly Love in honor
[1:00:10] preferring one another Roman
[1:00:13] 1216 mind not high thing but con then
[1:00:17] send to Men of flow estate be not wise
[1:00:21] in your own conceit Paul to the galatian
[1:00:24] chapter 5 verse 26 let us not be
[1:00:28] deservers of vain Glory provoking one
[1:00:32] another anding one
[1:00:36] another amen Paul to the
[1:00:39] Ephesian he said with all loness and
[1:00:45] meekness with
[1:00:47] longsuffering forbearing one another in
[1:00:51] love humility and faith
[1:00:56] in John
[1:00:59] 5:44 Jesus said how can ye believe which
[1:01:04] receive honor one of
[1:01:10] another and seek not the honor that come
[1:01:14] from God
[1:01:19] Only You See say how could you have
[1:01:21] faith how could you believe when you
[1:01:24] want to receive honor or be acknowledged
[1:01:28] you see it's like a man system you see
[1:01:31] honor to be praised they want to honor
[1:01:34] you know like denomination or you know
[1:01:38] it could be among us you know how could
[1:01:40] you believe when you receive honor of
[1:01:43] each other and not
[1:01:47] um but seek not the honor that come from
[1:01:51] God only that's the reason Jesus said
[1:01:53] when you give give um hide what you give
[1:01:58] when you pray close the door that nobody
[1:02:01] will see you you know it was always the
[1:02:03] same way faith is the confession our
[1:02:07] inability and do be known and do and to
[1:02:11] abandon ourself and wait of God's
[1:02:18] works you know I like it because it's
[1:02:23] simple yes amen you know you can apply
[1:02:26] it right now
[1:02:29] today humility is simply the state of
[1:02:32] the soul that prepare us to live by
[1:02:38] faith the Apostle
[1:02:41] Paul and the revelation of the power of
[1:02:44] God he received he was a great
[1:02:46] man every eyes were suspended at his
[1:02:50] lips when he was preaching oh aul
[1:02:54] Apollos was great man Peter oh he was
[1:02:58] with Jesus but Paul oh
[1:03:01] oh as such a
[1:03:05] revelation Paul was
[1:03:07] human and all this honor affected him
[1:03:11] probably he was probably struggling with
[1:03:16] Fame with proud and he was searching
[1:03:22] humility and in the second Corinthians
[1:03:25] 12:7 he said unless I should be exalted
[1:03:29] above measure through the abundance of
[1:03:32] the Revelation there was given to me a
[1:03:35] torn In the
[1:03:36] Flesh the messenger of Satan to buff
[1:03:40] above me lest I should be exalted above
[1:03:45] meure Paul prayed three times that it
[1:03:48] might depart from him you see uh it
[1:03:52] could be a kind of infirmity
[1:03:55] maybe his eyes or he was ugly we don't
[1:03:58] know
[1:04:02] exactly sorry I don't know because on
[1:04:06] the scripture
[1:04:08] right and the Lord told him my grace is
[1:04:12] sufficient for you for my strength is
[1:04:15] made perfect in weakness in
[1:04:18] humility most gladly therefore I will
[1:04:21] rather glory in my infirmity that the
[1:04:23] power of Christ May rest upon me and
[1:04:26] after Paul took pleasure in infirmity
[1:04:30] reproach uh in
[1:04:33] necessity in persecution and distress
[1:04:36] for Christ's sake for when I am weak
[1:04:40] then I am
[1:04:42] strong amen
[1:04:46] amen yeah I'm I'm approaching the
[1:04:51] end um okay a quote from the
[1:04:56] message you see uh perfect strength by

[1:07:09] Australian
[1:07:11] mountains where a old man was hired many
[1:07:15] years ago by a young town counil to
[1:07:18] clear away the debris from the water
[1:07:22] pools up in the m
[1:07:24] cises that fed the lovely spring flowing
[1:07:29] through their town
[1:07:31] with faithful silence regularity Patrol
[1:07:37] the hills remove the leaves branches and
[1:07:41] other matter that could spoil the water
