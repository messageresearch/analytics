[0:00] as we are asking the question what is
[0:03] God's will for me this year we've used
[0:05] this um emphasis on the year in preview
[0:09] as a way of implying very explicitly
[0:13] stating that uh because there are
[0:16] certain things we can know
[0:18] um with respect to God's will it can
[0:20] give us a preview of what our year holds
[0:22] for us in a lot of specifics now there's
[0:25] maybe a lot of things that remain to be
[0:27] seen and there's a lot of things that
[0:29] will transpire over this year that we
[0:31] did not anticipate there's some that
[0:33] make promises maybe there's been New
[0:35] Year's resolutions and there's a thought
[0:37] that I I want to keep this job forever
[0:39] or I'm going to live here forever I'm
[0:41] never going to do this I'm never going
[0:43] to do that and then God comes along and
[0:45] has different plans and so things change
[0:47] and our path doesn't always go the way
[0:49] that we think that would but there's
[0:51] certain things even on that path that
[0:54] should be constant and should be
[0:55] consistent regardless of where we end up
[0:57] what job we have or if there's some sort
[1:00] of move or some significant change in
[1:02] our lives there are certain constants
[1:04] that are his plan for us no matter what
[1:06] comes up and that's what we're doing
[1:08] when asking this question what is God's
[1:10] will for us this year there are things
[1:13] that we can know are his will and it's
[1:16] that plan that he has for us and those
[1:18] constants and those things that are
[1:19] consistent three things that we're
[1:21] wanting to emphasize in these services
[1:24] and I think that it'd be good for us to
[1:25] be constantly reminded of this but these
[1:28] these are things that we know are God's
[1:30] will last Sunday we went through just a
[1:32] few statements and scriptures to show
[1:34] that this is God's will for us to attend
[1:36] church contribute tithes and offerings
[1:39] and support missions these are three
[1:41] things that are God's will whether it's
[1:43] 2022 2020 2023 whatever it is it's God's
[1:47] will for us to be doing this and if we
[1:49] if the meeting in the air tarries and we
[1:51] we have it translated in the next five
[1:53] years these are things that we all ought
[1:55] to be doing and you say well what if
[1:57] they start shutting things down and
[1:58] something intervenes well God knows and
[2:00] he's mindful people and we could still
[2:02] say until we get out of here this is his
[2:04] perfect will for us I remember on the
[2:06] onset of the pandemic after it's kind of
[2:09] cute when you go back to think about how
[2:10] we felt the first day we stayed home we
[2:12] thought oh you know a couple days at
[2:14] home a few weeks maybe at home and then
[2:16] a few years kind of rolls out and you
[2:18] realize that's this is exactly maybe I
[2:20] would have done things differently had I
[2:22] known this is how it was going to be but
[2:24] I remember after a few weeks and maybe
[2:26] even a month it was with no church and
[2:28] not able to have service where we were
[2:30] and no gatherings I just felt very
[2:32] strong in my heart that we're either
[2:35] getting back to church or the body
[2:37] change is going to happen within 72
[2:38] hours or a week because this isn't God's
[2:41] will to perfect his church and so if if
[2:43] they shut all the doors and it doesn't
[2:45] look foreseeable that we're going to be
[2:46] getting back together then maybe we're
[2:48] just going to get out of here because
[2:50] these are things that are God's will for
[2:52] us and that's one reason why we ought to
[2:54] be supporting missions is because you
[2:55] never know what's going to happen
[2:56] overseas where governments can shut
[2:58] doors sometimes we just have this
[3:00] persecution complex here in America like
[3:02] they're taking away our rights and you
[3:04] say that with an AR-15 strapped on your
[3:06] back and uh and so there's a lot of
[3:09] things that we whine and cry about maybe
[3:10] in America about rights and freedoms and
[3:12] Liberties but you go to places that are
[3:14] War torn or they have dictators and they
[3:16] don't have the freedom that we have and
[3:18] doors can be shut there can be real
[3:20] persecution overseas and that's why we
[3:22] should be supporting missions so that we
[3:25] can facilitate the move of God and give
[3:27] them the resources they need so that we
[3:29] can all get out of here but these are
[3:31] three things that I believe I could say
[3:32] definitively are God's will for us among
[3:35] many other things even on the Wednesday
[3:36] nights we've been talking about sanctify
[3:38] your home gather around the word and
[3:41] live for others are the three things
[3:42] that are God's will for our homes now
[3:45] last week we were taking a thought from
[3:47] the book of haggai and how that God
[3:49] looked at them and said you're living in
[3:51] these well
[3:53] you know furnished homes and you've got
[3:55] Wayne's coating on your walls and you've
[3:57] got nice hardwood floors and
[3:58] everything's very very beautiful but my
[4:00] temple lays in waste and you haven't
[4:02] built up the walls of the temple and
[4:05] you've laid a foundation and you started
[4:06] well but you haven't continued therein
[4:08] and God is challenging them about the
[4:11] fact that they've been focused on
[4:12] natural things and haven't been doing
[4:14] his will and so we put it last week that
[4:18] God was correcting their Vision we could
[4:20] say that God was correcting them because
[4:22] they followed their own desires and not
[4:25] his will and it wasn't the air I could
[4:28] say isn't that they had nice things in
[4:30] their home but is that they had nice
[4:32] things in their home and they weren't
[4:33] doing God's Will and had they been doing
[4:36] God's will then God would have said hey
[4:37] you know have as much wood panel in your
[4:40] homes as you want and have all the nice
[4:42] finery and and enjoy those things but
[4:44] put God first and in haggai chapter 1
[4:47] verse 5 this was the says it in verse 7
[4:49] as well I believe he says now therefore
[4:51] thus saith the Lord of hosts consider
[4:53] your ways and so this is that challenge
[4:54] that was being issued forth consider
[4:57] your ways think about what you're doing
[4:58] and think about what you're emphasizing
[5:00] think about what you're lifting up
[5:01] consider whether or not you've
[5:03] prioritized carnal things over at God's
[5:06] expense
[5:07] I pursued this and there was something
[5:10] that God needed there was something that
[5:12] God wanted me to do and I pursued this
[5:14] maybe even if we could say well I see
[5:16] it's in God's desires for me and I see
[5:19] that he wants me to have these things
[5:20] and I I see that God would want these
[5:22] things to be done but you have to do
[5:24] things in order
[5:25] and so they were pursuing things or
[5:28] Desiring things maybe even achieving
[5:30] things that were part of God's blessing
[5:32] and part of God's plan maybe even things
[5:33] God had promised them but they couldn't
[5:35] do it at God's expense
[5:38] and so they had to keep God's Will and
[5:40] so the LA the the neglect of the house
[5:42] of God we were using as an analogy uh to
[5:45] us neglecting God's will
[5:47] in our lives or God's will for our lives
[5:49] and so we can't make the specific uh we
[5:52] can't put ourselves in a very specific
[5:54] situation that the children of Israel
[5:56] were in who had come out of Exile come
[5:58] back to Jerusalem and we're not building
[6:00] up the walls of that church or that
[6:02] Temple we can't maybe that make the
[6:03] specific comparison but we can say they
[6:07] weren't doing God's Will and that's what
[6:08] we're wanting to draw from it is doing
[6:10] God's will
[6:11] in Proverbs chapter 29 Verse 18 where
[6:14] there is no vision that people perish
[6:16] but he that keepeth the law happy is he
[6:19] that word Vision means divine Oracle a
[6:21] revelation from God and what would that
[6:23] be God disclosing his will we know
[6:26] without faith it is impossible to please
[6:28] God faith is a revelation of God's will
[6:30] for us and so there's so much that's
[6:32] wrapped up in these words that this
[6:33] Vision where there is no following in
[6:36] God's will where we don't give
[6:39] preference to the things of God the
[6:41] people live undisciplined they live
[6:42] unrestrained they may feel like they're
[6:44] making progress but they're going to end
[6:46] up in a spot and say oh wait a minute
[6:47] how did I get here this isn't where I'm
[6:49] supposed to be and so we recognized from
[6:53] those emphasis last week that we want to
[6:56] get we do not want to just give priority
[6:58] to temporal things over God's will
[7:01] this is the Striking scripture to me
[7:03] that I wanted to mention again today in
[7:06] haggai chapter 1 verse six you have sown
[7:08] much in bringing little
[7:10] so there's a lot of effort but not a lot
[7:12] of return you eat but you have not
[7:14] enough so they're eating but it's not
[7:16] quite quenching you drink but you're not
[7:18] filled to drink you clothe you but there
[7:20] is none warm and he that earneth wages
[7:23] earneth wages to put it into a bag with
[7:25] holes but beautiful imagery that is
[7:28] being created and it was not that it's
[7:31] literally a wallet with a hole in it or
[7:33] a purse with a gaping hole in it or a
[7:36] bank account with the back door where
[7:37] some hacker is still in all your all
[7:39] your Bitcoin but it is literally it's
[7:42] used in a figurative sense to say that
[7:44] you're literally laboring and all your
[7:46] labor is just going right through and
[7:49] you're not getting the benefit from it
[7:51] or the return from it that you ought to
[7:53] be getting you earn a wage and you put
[7:55] it in a bag and it just drops right out
[7:57] um some say eating working eating hand
[8:00] to mouth as soon as you get it you eat
[8:01] it or you're not really getting ahead
[8:03] you're not gaining or building or
[8:05] getting in an advancement and this is
[8:08] such a striking correction
[8:11] and what I'd want you to take from this
[8:13] is doing God's will blesses your labors
[8:16] and increases the yield of fruit that
[8:18] you get from your labor if you do God's
[8:21] will then then there's a the laboring
[8:23] that even in itself there's a reward in
[8:25] laboring knowing from whom your reward
[8:27] comes and you can do it as unto the Lord
[8:29] and you can work and so even the effort
[8:32] and the labor will be blessed where
[8:33] there won't be as much uh maybe stress
[8:36] or strain there's a way that when you're
[8:37] putting God's first God first he has a
[8:39] way of lifting you up and encouraging
[8:41] you toward the labor itself is not as
[8:44] burdensome as it could be and then also
[8:46] if you put God first and do his will
[8:48] he'll actually bless the fruits of that
[8:50] labor so I think there's two levels on
[8:53] that that uh that are tremendous to
[8:56] consider in terms of doing God's Will
[8:57] and what it means in terms of our yield
[8:59] our labor and our yield
[9:02] I thought about this principle several
[9:03] times over the last few weeks studying
[9:06] these scriptures and it was at a men's
[9:08] meeting several years ago some of you
[9:10] may remember it my brother Jason Watkins
[9:11] used the example the force multiplier
[9:14] and and some of you may be familiar with
[9:16] it in terms of military experience and
[9:18] different things but a force multiplier
[9:20] is a capability that when added to and
[9:23] employed by a combat force it
[9:26] significantly increases the combat
[9:28] potential of that force and thus
[9:30] enhances the probability of a successful
[9:32] mission
[9:33] and so I figured and I know everybody's
[9:35] like
[9:36] you know you're looking at me like a
[9:38] mule at a new gate uh when I read that
[9:41] but it's um Force multipliers something
[9:44] that makes a given Force more effective
[9:46] than it would be without that multiplier
[9:48] so it's adding something so you have a
[9:50] force you have a labor you have
[9:52] something you're doing maybe in this
[9:53] sense you have a combat Force oh we got
[9:55] a lot of men we got tens of thousands of
[9:56] men we're going to put them in this
[9:58] direction and we're going to send them
[10:00] out to accomplish this Mission but they
[10:02] say that if you give the a GPS unit to
[10:05] this force that it's this force is more
[10:08] successful the results of that Force are
[10:09] five times as large as it would be
[10:11] without the GPS so it's a force
[10:14] multiplier of five and so you could give
[10:16] different examples of what a force
[10:18] multiplier is but it's basically you
[10:19] have a force you have them equipped
[10:21] they're trained and they could do
[10:22] something but then you add something to
[10:24] it and it multiplies their fours so if a
[10:27] GPS is a five times a multiplier to a
[10:30] combat unit what I want to what I took
[10:32] from this and what I was reminded of and
[10:34] I just love how brother Jason brought it
[10:36] out in the men's meeting so it's always
[10:37] stuck with me that God is our Force
[10:39] multiplier and that's exactly what being
[10:42] referred to in haggai chapter 1 verse 6.
[10:44] imagine if you even ask haggai he's
[10:45] saying yeah I'm the one that came up
[10:46] with it I'm the one that came up with
[10:48] the force multiplier or the scriptures
[10:50] say one shall Chase so many two shall
[10:52] Chase so many what it's a force
[10:54] multiplier where God is that Force
[10:57] multiplier and what and this is what I'm
[10:58] wanting to encourage you with whatever
[11:00] you're doing whatever you're laboring in
[11:02] if you put God's first he multiplies
[11:05] your labor and multiplies your fruits
[11:07] this is what doing God's will is a force
[11:10] multiplier and the Bible says a
[11:12] hundredfold is maybe what it's the force
[11:15] multipliers 100 times but it's Limitless
[11:17] what God can do for us when we put him
[11:20] first
[11:21] the Bible says I can do all things
[11:23] through Christ who gives me strength and
[11:25] so this this is what uh I'm wanting you
[11:27] to take this at the beginning maybe I
[11:29] didn't know exactly wasn't exactly sure
[11:30] where to fit this in
[11:32] but I think right here now even if we
[11:34] fail to come back to it later this is
[11:36] what I'm wanting to emphasize in doing
[11:38] God's Will and doing these things is
[11:40] there is a blessing and a benefit that
[11:43] comes from doing God's will so when we
[11:45] can know what God's will is and do it
[11:47] that's good that what Jesus is Happy are
[11:50] you if you do these things in knowing
[11:52] God's will we get a great benefit from
[11:54] it
[11:55] now those three things attend church
[11:57] contribute tithes and offering support
[11:59] missions each one is worthy of a lot of
[12:01] time we could spend a lot of time on
[12:02] each one of those things there's a lot
[12:04] that can be brought out a lot that can
[12:05] be shared I've wrestled with just
[12:07] exactly uh how how to share it when to
[12:10] share it how much to share I felt
[12:12] impressed today just to take some time
[12:14] on a very familiar uh some very familiar
[12:16] principles on this first part of attend
[12:19] church
[12:20] and so I can say this and doesn't it
[12:23] feel good to be here to hear this right
[12:25] I mean at least you're not somebody's
[12:27] not just you know hitting you with the
[12:28] DM this afternoon saying hey where were
[12:30] you we we heard about how good it is to
[12:32] be in church but you're all here
[12:34] and so it is God's will for us to
[12:36] assemble together
[12:38] and there's a lot of different or if I
[12:40] could say not only just to symbol
[12:41] ourselves together but there's some
[12:44] familiarity with that that if you're
[12:46] assembling together there's some uh
[12:48] consistency and some constancy and
[12:50] there's the familiarity that's why they
[12:52] call it a brother man called it a church
[12:54] home that we ought to have a church home
[12:56] when it so when I say attend church and
[12:58] we'll look at some of these scriptures
[12:59] uh it is God's will for us to assemble
[13:01] together in a common place at a common
[13:04] time to where there's there's some
[13:07] there's momentum that builds with that
[13:09] assembly and so you say well I get
[13:11] together
[13:12] um every every Sunday morning at 10
[13:14] o'clock at my favorite sports bar
[13:17] um to watch football and you say I'm
[13:18] assembling I'm assembly with like-minded
[13:20] people no doubt but it's that's not the
[13:23] assembly that's being spoken of or nor
[13:25] is it just always visiting a different
[13:27] Church there's something other something
[13:29] else implied in that as we look into the
[13:30] word of God and this is a very forceful
[13:33] forceful statement brother Branham in
[13:36] the sermon the voice of the sign says we
[13:38] believe that every Christian ought to
[13:40] have a home church that they go to so
[13:42] what is what is home to us it's the
[13:46] place that we return to and we return to
[13:49] over and over again I remember when we
[13:50] were traveling quite a bit as a young
[13:52] family in traveling in Ministry uh that
[13:56] you know there was uh there was moments
[13:58] I think when at least with Jack and some
[14:00] of our other children they didn't know
[14:01] what home was and one time Jack asked he
[14:03] says you remember that White House and
[14:05] the White House and we're like yeah we
[14:07] remember the White House we we've toured
[14:09] the White House we had some connections
[14:10] at the time thank you uh Donald Trump
[14:13] who hasn't paid his ties
[14:15] um and they there's a um I mean we
[14:18] looked at all his tax records it's not
[14:20] in there anywhere
[14:21] but uh
[14:23] he was saying yeah we remember the White
[14:25] House the White House the one in DC goes
[14:27] no the one in Texas and we realized he's
[14:28] referring to our house it's like it was
[14:31] white and he was like and that's what in
[14:33] his mind he was thinking I remember even
[14:34] when we moved to North Carolina we'd
[14:36] been there for like three or four months
[14:37] and he said Dad are you done preaching
[14:39] here yet because he's just so used to us
[14:41] going somewhere to preach he's like hey
[14:43] isn't it time to go to the next hotel
[14:45] the next house when are we ever going
[14:47] back to Texas and uh hopefully never and
[14:49] so that was uh we had moved on from that
[14:52] and and they didn't know what home was
[14:54] but we all know what the thought of home
[14:56] is right it's the place you returned to
[14:59] it's a place you come back to after you
[15:01] go on a work trip when you're returning
[15:03] you're going home and when you land on
[15:04] the airplane and everyone's standing up
[15:06] says oh is Phoenix home or wherever
[15:08] you're Landing they ask why because
[15:09] that's the place you return it's some
[15:11] place where it's consistent you can say
[15:13] well have you checked them at their home
[15:15] or are you when are you going home it's
[15:16] a reference point so brother Brown says
[15:18] I believe that every Christian ought to
[15:20] have a home church that they go to every
[15:22] Christian to meet somewhere with
[15:24] Believers and I love this and wherever
[15:27] you meet that's the church
[15:29] so this is a principle that he
[15:31] references and if if I felt any if I had
[15:35] felt at all that I was going to be doing
[15:37] plowing today and that I was working
[15:39] with this spirit and this I that people
[15:41] had this thought in their head a real
[15:43] stubborn thought that you don't need to
[15:44] go to church and there's no such thing
[15:46] at church and you could just stay home
[15:47] because you are the church I remember
[15:49] brother Gabriel many years ago brother
[15:51] Elijah you might remember this when
[15:52] you'd ask him where he goes where he
[15:54] went to church he'd go
[15:56] I am the church right you might remember
[15:58] that and that's the way some people
[15:59] think about it is well I am the church
[16:01] wherever I am is church and wherever if
[16:03] you want to come over and visit me on a
[16:04] Sunday we can have church but brother
[16:06] Bam's talking about having a home church
[16:08] where you meet with Believers and where
[16:10] they meet it's the Assembly of the
[16:12] people that make it what it is that make
[16:13] it a church and so there's a lot of
[16:16] phrases that we can use with respect to
[16:18] this that we find in the word of God
[16:19] where every believer every Christian
[16:21] ought to have a a post of Duty or a
[16:23] place of Duty and that means a place of
[16:26] responsibility and it's a regular
[16:27] meeting place and wherever that is
[16:29] that's the church because the people
[16:31] come together with that intent and it
[16:33] means something and this is God's will
[16:35] for us now Matthew chapter 18 I'm going
[16:38] to read verses 15 to 17 and then we'll
[16:40] finish with the rest of this a little
[16:42] bit later on
[16:43] but it says moreover If thy brother
[16:45] shall trespass against thee go and tell
[16:48] him his fault between thee and him alone
[16:51] now there's there's a good
[16:53] good um teaching and don't go tell
[16:57] everybody what you're doing right well
[16:58] I'm going to give him a piece of my mind
[17:00] just between he and I and you let
[17:02] everybody know right you hit the group
[17:04] chat I'm going to visit brother Aaron
[17:06] and give him a piece of my mind uh he
[17:08] trespasses I said go to him and tell him
[17:09] alone he says and if thou if he hears
[17:11] thee thou has gained thy brother
[17:13] but if he will not hear thee then take
[17:15] with thee one or two more
[17:17] that in the mouth of two or three
[17:19] Witnesses every word may be established
[17:21] what beautiful principles that we can
[17:22] follow and if he shall neglect to hear
[17:25] them this is you and those Witnesses
[17:26] tell it unto the church but if you
[17:29] neglect to hear the church let him be
[17:32] unto thee as a heathen man and a
[17:33] publican
[17:35] with respect to verse 15 and 16 and I
[17:37] think even verse 17 obviously what Jesus
[17:40] proposes is impossible without the
[17:43] existence of the church
[17:45] because even in the idea of if my
[17:47] brother shall trespass against thee for
[17:49] us that means within Christianity
[17:52] it's the basis of Fellowship a basis of
[17:54] relationship
[17:55] um you you don't go to
[17:57] fries and walk in and begin to announce
[18:01] their hey good to see you brothers and
[18:02] sisters and just call everybody brother
[18:05] and call Everybody's sister sometimes we
[18:07] do I do remember one time at a men's
[18:09] meeting there was a preacher there
[18:10] preaching and he kept saying my brother
[18:11] my sister and it's like men's you know
[18:14] it's like well I don't know who you're
[18:15] streaming to right now but I mean
[18:18] there's no sisters here but you don't
[18:20] you go around and say my you know
[18:21] brother and sister and you're always uh
[18:23] if you said that there would be someone
[18:25] looking to say my answer brother right
[18:28] uh did you just uh misgender me I'm not
[18:31] your I'm not your sister and so there's
[18:33] a lot of a lot of connotation to that
[18:35] idea of even a brother there's a basis
[18:37] for Fellowship there's a basis of
[18:39] relationship and that arises in the
[18:41] church
[18:42] and he says so what he's proposing you
[18:45] could not even accomplish without the
[18:47] existence of the church the Ecclesia is
[18:50] the Greek word that's used it's
[18:51] translated to church or assembly but
[18:54] it's a gathering this word would have
[18:55] referred to a gathering of citizens
[18:57] called out of their homes into a public
[18:59] place so you call them from their homes
[19:01] into a place a public place for a
[19:04] meeting it's a group of Christians who
[19:06] observe religious rights hold meetings
[19:07] and govern their own Affairs this is the
[19:10] meaning that's intended behind the word
[19:11] church and it's those who anywhere who
[19:14] gather anywhere from City or Village or
[19:16] wherever they're Gathering from that
[19:18] constitute such a company a group of
[19:19] Christians and are united into one body
[19:22] so this is when Jesus says you shall
[19:24] tell it to the church if he doesn't hear
[19:27] you then tell it unto the church other
[19:29] than him telling Peter Upon This Rock
[19:31] will I build my church this is the only
[19:33] other reference to the church
[19:36] this is the only other place where Jesus
[19:38] is signaling hey there's going to be a
[19:40] siblings there's going to be those that
[19:41] gather together to a Jew they have the
[19:43] concept of a synagogue and they have a
[19:45] concept of meeting with the rabbi and
[19:47] the teachings and different things they
[19:48] would have had that idea but this is
[19:50] Jesus saying there's going to be a
[19:51] Christian church and Paul is the one
[19:53] that establishes that he's the one that
[19:55] lays so much of the firm principles that
[19:56] we observe today within the Christian
[19:58] Church he's saying hey if he won't hear
[20:00] you bring it to the local Gathering
[20:03] bring it to the the that group that
[20:05] gathers together that holds meetings and
[20:07] observes the the the the the the
[20:10] traditions and the responsibilities of
[20:12] the scripture and they're United in one
[20:14] body
[20:15] and I believe that when Jesus tells us
[20:17] this he is if not uh pointing to it he
[20:21] is clearly uh if he's clearly pointing
[20:24] to it but Jesus is establishing the
[20:26] absolute necessity of a local assembly
[20:29] with order
[20:30] the church
[20:32] brother Branham in the sermon the
[20:33] position of a believer in Christ oh
[20:36] maybe this would be a good place to say
[20:37] it there are so many quotes
[20:40] um so many statements on going to church
[20:42] and having a home church and go to
[20:43] church and go to church there's so many
[20:44] there's even some that we some that we
[20:46] reviewed that we went over last year and
[20:49] that's why I call it a year the Year in
[20:50] preview because in some ways we're
[20:52] actually just reviewing some of the
[20:54] things that we had already ministered on
[20:56] just to keep them fresh in our minds but
[20:58] there's so much that can be said I've
[20:59] really labored
[21:01] um in the study to try to find a way to
[21:04] present it at a little bit different
[21:06] angle other than just quote after quote
[21:07] after quote that's the uh that
[21:10] emphasizes certain things but there's
[21:12] some that I definitely want to
[21:13] re-emphasize or share just so it's we're
[21:16] reminded of how significant this
[21:18] assembly is that Jesus is referring to
[21:20] in this sermon the position of a
[21:23] believer in Christ now the fellow said I
[21:25] can be a Christian and stay home just as
[21:27] well that the fellow said it was
[21:30] referring to it but anybody say well I
[21:31] can I can stay home and be a Christian I
[21:33] don't have to go to church and be a
[21:34] Christian he says no you can't no you've
[21:38] got to meet together with the rest of
[21:40] the body
[21:41] this is uh he revisits this in a couple
[21:44] other ways to where he's clearly
[21:45] identifying that if anyone think he
[21:47] standeth take heed lest he fall because
[21:51] you cannot be the same Christian and not
[21:54] assembled together with other believers
[21:56] and those who by way of tragedy or
[21:59] circumstance who find themselves having
[22:01] fallen out of going to church and no
[22:04] longer attend church there is a price
[22:06] that they pay for that
[22:08] because you cannot be a Christian you
[22:10] cannot be the same Christian you cannot
[22:12] live the Christian Life and not assemble
[22:14] together
[22:16] and Paul it picks up there's a number of
[22:18] places that touch on
[22:20] um what the seeds that Jesus sowed and
[22:22] how Paul brings them out especially when
[22:24] it relates to the church
[22:26] but in Hebrews chapter 10 verses 24 and
[22:28] 25 I know some of you probably already
[22:30] wrote this reference down and are
[22:32] surprised it took me this long to get to
[22:34] it but says and let us consider one
[22:36] another to provoke unto love unto good
[22:38] works
[22:39] not forsaking the assembling of
[22:41] ourselves together as the manner of some
[22:44] is but exhorting one another and so much
[22:47] the more as you see the day approaching
[22:50] if you could take all these verses
[22:52] together these two verses together and
[22:55] kind of
[22:56] keep them keep them together in each
[22:58] principle each phrase and keep them
[23:01] together in the thought that kind of
[23:02] hinges in this central part not
[23:04] forsaking the assembling of ourselves
[23:06] together look at verse 24 and how it
[23:08] says let's consider one another to
[23:10] provoke one of the love and good works
[23:12] and exhorting one another so much the
[23:14] more as you see that day approaching it
[23:16] the center of this is assembling
[23:18] yourselves together if not forsaken the
[23:19] assembling of yourselves together as the
[23:21] manner of some is this is Paul saying
[23:24] that these assemblies and you look into
[23:26] the New Testament the book of Acts and
[23:27] other places where they were ordaining
[23:29] that which was needful in the churches
[23:31] and they were assembling here and they
[23:32] were gathering here and there's all
[23:34] these different references in the
[23:35] scripture where you had this church here
[23:37] this church here even the the seven
[23:39] Church ages under the church which is at
[23:41] these are places where Believers were
[23:44] assembling together that's the dynamic
[23:46] and the mechanics that are being
[23:48] referenced here let us consider one
[23:50] another not forsaking the assembling of
[23:52] ourselves together this is the church
[23:54] that Jesus is referring to
[23:57] Billy Branham says in the sermon
[23:58] discernment of spirit you ought to have
[24:00] a place not just to float about from
[24:03] pillar to pose but have somewhere that
[24:06] you go to church and you call it your
[24:08] church
[24:09] somewhere you somewhere you pay your
[24:11] tithe and somewhere that you help
[24:13] support the causes so there's one that
[24:15] starts that kind of hits all three
[24:17] that's where that's where you pay your
[24:19] tithes you pay your tithes where you go
[24:20] to church and you and and I would say
[24:22] this just for clarification that if
[24:24] there's other Mission projects you're
[24:25] supporting and there's a lot of
[24:27] missionaries that are out there a lot of
[24:28] Mission Works and programs that you may
[24:30] be supporting
[24:32] um so you're I believe that a
[24:33] Christian's at Liberty to do that I'll
[24:35] even go so far as I say you have
[24:36] absolute Liberty not to pay tithes
[24:39] right you do it do what you want to do
[24:42] in our in our house like that this may
[24:45] shock you but I smoke as much weed as I
[24:47] want hey
[24:52] you do too right
[24:55] it just I don't want any right and so if
[24:58] you don't want to pay your taxes you
[24:59] have that right you don't have you don't
[25:00] have to pay your ties but there's
[25:02] scriptural principles that you're
[25:03] abiding by and you're following in doing
[25:06] it and so where brother Brown teaches
[25:08] this I think it's very clear you pay
[25:09] your ties where you go to church and but
[25:10] when it comes to supporting other causes
[25:12] that's kind of what I believe Church
[25:14] ought to be doing is giving us
[25:16] opportunities to support missions and
[25:17] support certain causes and in a vacuum
[25:20] or in the void of not having causes your
[25:22] supporting ones continue by all means to
[25:24] support whatever missionaries and
[25:26] Mission projects that you feel burdened
[25:28] to support but in the right time I want
[25:30] to share with you all the things that
[25:31] our church is doing to support missions
[25:33] and if you feel to support that that's
[25:35] what this is about it's all part of it
[25:37] together but notice it says you go
[25:38] somewhere you call it your church it's
[25:40] where you pay your tithes and you help
[25:42] support the cause take your choice
[25:45] so you've chosen where you go and then I
[25:47] love how brother Branham is so quick to
[25:49] identify kind of that
[25:51] it's us right this us mentality but then
[25:54] don't never double negative but we get
[25:56] the point don't never disfellowship the
[25:58] other man because he don't belong with
[26:00] your group
[26:01] and then beautiful thought here discern
[26:03] the spirit and see if he's got the same
[26:04] purpose and heart then you've got
[26:06] Fellowship on with another
[26:08] and sometimes it might take a little bit
[26:09] of effort to discern enough to find that
[26:12] that common ground and that common basis
[26:14] to find Fellowship but just because
[26:16] somebody goes to a different assembly or
[26:18] goes to a different Church doesn't mean
[26:19] you you remove from them the appellation
[26:21] brother I'm not going to call you
[26:22] brother anymore because you go to a
[26:24] different Church brother mom says no you
[26:26] choose your church you have a choice
[26:27] where you go to church you've prayed
[26:29] about it you feel this is where God
[26:31] wants you to be and you make that choice
[26:32] don't ever disfelish it because God
[26:34] hasn't given them the same leading
[26:36] but you must know for yourself that you
[26:39] have a place and not just float around
[26:41] from Pillar To Post but you go to that
[26:42] church and you call it your church and
[26:44] you support it
[26:46] I would say this and I say it with much
[26:48] with as much confidence as I possibly
[26:51] can I don't think there's any debate
[26:53] whatsoever it is God's will
[26:56] for you to assemble with believers it is
[26:59] God's will for you to go to church it's
[27:00] just there's no it's there's no debate
[27:02] if someone wanted to argue the point
[27:04] with me and use all the quotes that they
[27:06] can try to muster up to prove that it's
[27:08] okay to stay home uh I'm just saying no
[27:11] you just can't do it
[27:13] and and and I think there's probably a
[27:15] lot of at the very least of just to use
[27:17] an intellectual term a lot of
[27:18] intellectual dishonesty for anyone who
[27:20] tries to use the message of the hour or
[27:22] the Bible to make that point a real real
[27:25] uh strong cognitive dissonance at work
[27:28] if anyone tried to make the argument
[27:30] that you don't have to go to church
[27:31] because it's just so plain
[27:35] in Acts chapter 17 verses one to three
[27:37] we'll skip to verse two
[27:39] says they're they're passing through uh
[27:43] and they came to thessalonica where it
[27:45] was a synagogue of the Jews so the
[27:46] synagogue would be the assembly the
[27:47] Gathering of Jews and it's where the
[27:49] concept of gathering and assembling
[27:51] would have been very familiar in the
[27:53] institution of the Christian church as
[27:54] it was established amongst the Jews it
[27:57] says and Paul as his manner was went
[28:01] unto them in three Sabbath days reasoned
[28:03] with them out of the scriptures so now
[28:04] every Sabbath he's going into the
[28:06] synagogue and reason opening in a legend
[28:08] that Christ must needs have suffered and
[28:10] risen again from the dead and that this
[28:13] Jesus whom I preached unto you is Christ
[28:15] this is what Paul was doing
[28:18] every Church day
[28:22] as they would Gather in this on the in
[28:24] the synagogue on the Sabbath day and
[28:26] that was a day holy unto the Lord and
[28:27] they would go to church they would go to
[28:28] their assembly
[28:30] it says Paul went to the synagogue of
[28:33] the Jews as his manner was this is what
[28:36] the scripture is telling us as what his
[28:38] manner was it's um custom or habitual
[28:40] practice this is something that Paul did
[28:43] on Saturdays or on the Sabbath day he
[28:45] went to church and when it's telling us
[28:48] that this is something Paul did as was
[28:50] his custom and this is what I believe
[28:52] that we ought to have this kind of
[28:53] discipline this kind of custom you'll
[28:55] say well is it just custom is it just
[28:57] discipline is it just tradition well I
[28:58] mean
[28:59] you know what God wants right don't
[29:03] reason yourself out of it because you
[29:04] don't want to be a hypocrite right
[29:07] and that to me is just one of the most
[29:09] uh interesting arguments that people
[29:12] make well I don't want to I really don't
[29:14] want to go to church all the time
[29:15] because you know I just don't want to
[29:16] make it a tradition
[29:18] all right
[29:19] So you you're fine with making a
[29:21] tradition not to go to church
[29:23] interesting
[29:24] I know people say well I don't want to
[29:26] go to church because I don't want to be
[29:27] a hypocrite well wait why would you be a
[29:30] hippo could come to church you're the
[29:32] seat of Satan what you mean
[29:34] like you don't want anyone to think
[29:36] you're a Christian because you're really
[29:37] not like no no I'm just not I'm just not
[29:39] really living the life but do you
[29:41] believe you're a Son of God yeah then go
[29:43] to church that's the one place you can't
[29:44] be a hypocrite you're a hypocrite when
[29:47] you're out in the world
[29:48] you're a hypocrite when you're at the
[29:49] bar you're a hypocrite when you're
[29:51] partying because you're really a Son of
[29:52] God living a life that's not congruent
[29:54] with what you really are and so really I
[29:57] there's just a lot of arguments that
[29:58] people make that are just so shallow and
[30:01] so I'm not wanting you to just latch on
[30:03] to words a habit and practice and custom
[30:05] I believe that the Bible speaks that it
[30:08] was Paul's manner or his habitual
[30:10] practice to go to church and I believe
[30:12] that this practice is a choice that one
[30:14] makes it's a choice to keep doing what
[30:17] one has done
[30:18] it implies this uh continual uh volition
[30:22] volition where this is something I do it
[30:24] implies permanence
[30:25] so if I could use a phrase maybe that
[30:27] wouldn't stumble you it was his
[30:29] testimony
[30:31] Paul went to church as it was his
[30:33] testimony it was the expectation that
[30:36] you would expect Paul to be there if
[30:38] Paul was traveling in the city and his
[30:40] companions are with them and Barnabas
[30:42] and someone says hey you know what's
[30:43] what's Paul going to be doing tomorrow
[30:44] he's like dude
[30:46] tomorrow's Saturday
[30:48] right
[30:49] Paul's going to the synagogue oh really
[30:51] yeah just you got to go see this right
[30:54] you knew what Paul was going to be doing
[30:56] it was something he did it was his
[30:57] testimony his expectation it was part of
[30:58] his character part of what identified
[31:00] who who he was
[31:02] brother Madam in the sermon trying to do
[31:04] God of service without it being God's
[31:05] will he says I'm so misunderstood and I
[31:08] don't know why
[31:09] people think I don't even believe in
[31:11] people going to church
[31:14] that's a million miles from the truth
[31:18] there's people who think that today
[31:20] and hang on every word he said he says
[31:22] but people think I don't even believe in
[31:24] people going to church that's a million
[31:26] miles from the truth we must assemble
[31:28] ourselves together and that much more as
[31:31] we see the day approaching we must come
[31:34] together in unity
[31:35] this is something that we must do
[31:37] brother bam in one place says usually
[31:38] it's my custom to go to church somewhere
[31:40] on Sunday if I possibly can this was his
[31:43] custom Luke chapter 4 verse 16 it says
[31:45] and he came to Nazareth just speaking of
[31:47] Jesus where he had been brought up and
[31:49] as his custom was he went into the
[31:51] synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood
[31:53] up for to read
[31:55] this was the custom of Paul who's
[31:58] following in the pattern and the custom
[31:59] of Christ it was what you would expect
[32:01] him to do under normal circumstances
[32:04] that's what brother bam says this is
[32:06] what you can expect me to do under
[32:07] normal circumstances this is what you
[32:09] could expect Paul to do under normal
[32:11] circumstances this is what you could
[32:12] expect Christ to do under normal
[32:15] circumstances is that when that day
[32:17] comes and the church doors are open that
[32:19] this is where you could expect Paul this
[32:21] is where you can expect Christ that's
[32:23] where you can expect brother Madam and
[32:24] that's what we want our testimony it
[32:26] should be our testimony reputation that
[32:28] you would expect to be it would you be
[32:30] expected to be at church
[32:33] under normal circumstances that should
[32:35] be our testimony and I know
[32:37] it just so easily rolls off the tongue
[32:40] right to go to church but you all know
[32:42] what a labor it is to be here some of
[32:45] you drive four hours round trip to be
[32:46] here even on the midweek service so I I
[32:50] if it seems oh it seems really really
[32:52] easy I'm acknowledging that even if we
[32:54] just live hey you think you're late to
[32:56] church now live a mile from the church
[32:59] all right you'll be even more late
[33:01] and I'm sure some of you could testify
[33:03] to that it's like when you lived a
[33:04] little bit further away and then you
[33:05] moved like man I'm only like 10 miles
[33:07] away from church now we're going to be
[33:08] there 30 minutes early every year right
[33:12] still hasn't happened yet because it
[33:14] it's it's always a labor it's always a
[33:16] truck there's always resistance I
[33:18] guarantee you if you're wanting to if
[33:21] you had a vaccination appointment at 10
[33:23] o'clock on a Sunday morning you'll be
[33:24] you'd get somehow some way you'd get a
[33:27] police escort to be there at 9 30. right
[33:29] it's just going to work that way but
[33:31] when it comes to coming to church it's
[33:32] always a resistance it's always a fight
[33:34] so it's very very easy for me to express
[33:36] these principles but I know in doing it
[33:38] there's a labor that comes with it
[33:39] things you have to fight for that's why
[33:41] we've tried to emphasize it the way we
[33:43] to have but brother bam says that it's a
[33:45] million miles from the truth they say
[33:46] that he didn't believe in going to
[33:48] church because it was his custom to go
[33:50] to church
[33:51] it should be our custom to go to church
[33:54] you say well is that just tradition is
[33:56] it just legalism no it's just what we do
[33:59] because we're believers
[34:02] you find this come up a few times in the
[34:04] summer of 64. brother Branham has asked
[34:07] about church in different variances on
[34:09] this in different ways he's asked about
[34:11] should I go to this church what should I
[34:13] do this is question 331 in part three
[34:17] brother Brown do you teach that the
[34:19] bride must not attend any other Church
[34:21] unless you are preaching or otherwise
[34:23] the Tabernacle
[34:25] huh
[34:29] I feel like I should have the Jeopardy
[34:31] theme
[34:32] playing
[34:34] think about it Ponder
[34:37] brother Branham do you teach that the
[34:39] bride must not attend any other Church
[34:41] unless you are preaching or otherwise
[34:43] the Tabernacle no I do not teach that I
[34:47] do not believe that I do not believe it
[34:50] I'm glad he did it like three different
[34:52] ways like right because there's just
[34:54] some people says well I know he said no
[34:56] but he was actually objecting to the way
[34:58] they phrased it
[35:00] no
[35:02] I don't teach that I don't believe it I
[35:05] do not believe it
[35:08] I'm here's maybe the shocking part we've
[35:10] got ministers sitting here that's
[35:12] scattered all around through the country
[35:13] and I believe they are part of that
[35:15] bride
[35:18] people clutching their pearls preachers
[35:21] part of the Bride I believe that a man
[35:23] or woman can go to church anywhere they
[35:25] want to go that teaches the word
[35:28] and I believe and this is just how
[35:29] important church is think about he says
[35:30] and I believe if they don't teach the
[35:32] whole word and you can't go to church
[35:33] any other place where they teach the
[35:35] whole word go where they teach half the
[35:36] word until you can get get to where they
[35:38] teach the whole word I love how he
[35:40] phrases it right
[35:41] and some of you may say well brother
[35:43] Aaron that's why we're all here praying
[35:45] for a whole word church and I would say
[35:47] I'm glad that we could be here right
[35:50] it's ABC Arizona Believers crumbs right
[35:54] you can't get a slice get a crumb
[35:57] but that's how our hearts should be
[35:59] right our heart should be I want to be
[36:02] in church well there's no there's really
[36:04] no good churches then go where there's a
[36:06] half good church
[36:07] until right until you can get to where
[36:11] they teach the whole word go to church
[36:13] whatever you do do that
[36:17] so no matter how you might want to
[36:18] massage it with the rest of the message
[36:20] and and place it just how you how you
[36:22] believe brother Branham would want you
[36:24] to obey and adhere to assembling
[36:26] yourself together that there's he's
[36:28] saying that that's God's will for us
[36:31] and I know there's a danger of legalism
[36:33] there's a danger of rigid compliance uh
[36:36] where there's really not an
[36:37] understanding or a Grace when it comes
[36:38] to these things and some people have an
[36:40] attendance chart and um and as soon as
[36:42] you're guilty and transgressing one time
[36:44] because really if you want to be
[36:45] legalistic about it uh you'd have to
[36:47] have perfect attendance then and never
[36:49] miss a service
[36:50] right and we've all missed a service
[36:53] and and so there's a
[36:56] uh there's a way that people can be very
[36:58] legalistic about it they could use it
[36:59] kind of as a badge of honor and they're
[37:01] very there it's this rigid discipline to
[37:04] it without really an understanding of
[37:05] why they're even Gathering
[37:07] it's it's faithfulness to a legacy it's
[37:09] faithfulness to a man it's faithfulness
[37:10] to a building it's just it's just they
[37:13] go to church because the if I get the
[37:16] the skeleton or the outline of these
[37:18] things has been preached but there's
[37:20] been no heart or flesh added to it
[37:22] so they can be very Stern and very rigid
[37:25] well that's just what we do we just go
[37:26] to church and it's by any means
[37:27] necessary
[37:29] but it's it's going to church just for
[37:30] the sake of going to church and they
[37:32] don't pause to ask themselves well
[37:35] I don't live to go to church I go to
[37:37] church to live
[37:39] and am I getting what I need to live and
[37:41] where I go to church
[37:43] and it's this honest question that you
[37:45] can't think that you're fulfilling the
[37:46] will of God for your life if you're just
[37:49] going to church because I could just all
[37:51] of a sudden flip it and seem very
[37:52] schizophrenic and read all the quotes
[37:54] about says you say oh I go to church
[37:56] that don't mean nothing right and over
[37:58] and over again I don't mean nothing you
[38:00] say you go to church you say you go to
[38:01] church that don't mean nothing and you
[38:02] go over here what means something that
[38:03] you go to church it's because you got to
[38:04] understand the why behind it
[38:06] like am I I don't live to go to church I
[38:09] go to church to live and so maybe
[38:10] because you don't get what you need to
[38:13] live you then live to get there
[38:15] and you're doing everything you can just
[38:17] to get to church because you know once
[38:18] you get there you're not going to get
[38:19] what you need to live
[38:20] so everything's got to get out of
[38:21] balance
[38:23] but I do want to emphasize or really
[38:25] identify
[38:28] how that brother Branham and maybe I
[38:30] could say for this my emphasis is about
[38:32] establishing the habit and discipline of
[38:34] obeying God's Will and putting God first
[38:38] and since in our lives and how varied
[38:40] they are and all the demands the gifts
[38:42] the talents the callings the visions
[38:43] that you may have even how God would
[38:45] lead you within your own home is not up
[38:48] to me to decide
[38:49] and it's not for others to judge
[38:52] it's there's such a variance in how you
[38:55] could be led as a man of God in your own
[38:57] home because I do believe and I'll
[38:58] mention it today as we often have I am
[39:01] nobody's spiritual husband
[39:04] right
[39:05] but I am Elizabeth's Pastor spiritually
[39:07] speaking
[39:09] and if you go to this church I'm your I
[39:11] am your pastor not spiritually speaking
[39:13] I just am literally speaking
[39:15] right and so there's not this husbandry
[39:18] that I have over the flock and oh so you
[39:20] went on about electric vehicle huh well
[39:22] you didn't talk to me about
[39:24] what our carbon policy is here
[39:26] right
[39:28] uh there's there's not that kind of
[39:30] oversight and so it's I can't weigh in
[39:32] on so many things in your life and I'm
[39:34] always happy to have the conversation
[39:35] with you anything the Lord puts on my
[39:37] heart if there's any kind of uh
[39:39] understanding he gives me I'll speak
[39:40] very plainly to you if there's any way
[39:42] that we could talk I'm happy to counsel
[39:43] and talk in those areas but I can speak
[39:46] with this very this Precision about
[39:49] certain things that are God's will for
[39:50] all of us and so when I what I'm
[39:52] emphasizing is not that legalism that
[39:54] rigid compliance but emphasizing let's
[39:56] be in the habit and the manner of doing
[39:59] God's Will and these are things that we
[40:01] know are God's will
[40:02] brother Branham is
[40:04] uh says this in question uh part one of
[40:06] question and answers that same summer he
[40:08] says and you go to church don't set it
[40:09] home go fishing and hunting and things
[40:12] like that on a Sunday you say well I'm
[40:14] not a legalist
[40:15] well you better be in that manner for a
[40:17] while
[40:19] so see how we don't we say well this
[40:21] isn't about being a legalist or just
[40:24] just being really very disciplined but
[40:25] he's saying well you know what maybe you
[40:27] should be maybe you should be well you
[40:29] better be that manner for a while what
[40:31] Manner go into church being a legalist
[40:33] about going to church dishonoring the
[40:35] resurrection of Christ you go to church
[40:37] somewhere
[40:38] so when we are in the discipline of not
[40:41] going to church or the habit of not
[40:42] going to church you're in the habit of
[40:44] dishonoring the Resurrection I said well
[40:47] I don't want to be a legalist what why
[40:48] why plan right why plan disobedience
[40:53] so that you can earn the non-legalist
[40:56] badge right like why plan it so you
[40:59] could be able you know just be like you
[41:00] know I'm just not a legalist we we
[41:02] actually stay out of church
[41:04] um every third Sunday
[41:05] because we just we just don't want to be
[41:07] legalist about this
[41:09] what
[41:10] I mean we this he said this is something
[41:13] we ought to be legalist about
[41:15] be in that manner for a while
[41:17] dishonoring the resurrection of Christ
[41:19] is something we ought to do
[41:21] in Luke chapter 14 verses 1 to 6 I feel
[41:23] compelled to bring this in uh because
[41:27] there's questions these questions are
[41:29] often asked that well I can't be there
[41:32] every service
[41:35] okay
[41:39] you can do that you can beat yourself up
[41:41] over that and other people may beat you
[41:42] yourself over that but you know what's
[41:44] in your heart you know what your desire
[41:45] is
[41:46] you know what your testimony is you know
[41:48] what your manner is and we're not always
[41:50] able to come even shift work we'll
[41:52] change things and circumstances will
[41:54] change and this is kind of I want to
[41:56] bring this in because it's a concept I
[41:57] think we're familiar with Brother Band
[41:58] references in a couple places he says it
[42:01] came to pass as they went into the house
[42:02] of one of the chief Pharisees to eat
[42:03] bread on the Sabbath day that they
[42:06] watched him because it's the Sabbath day
[42:08] and behold there was a certain man
[42:10] before him which had the drop seat and
[42:12] Jesus answering spake unto the lawyers
[42:14] and Pharisees saying is it lawful to
[42:17] heal on the Sabbath day so he's kind of
[42:19] provoking it any
[42:21] like this the nature of Christ is such a
[42:24] paradox I mean here he is just kind of
[42:26] poke hey you guys tell me here's a guy
[42:30] with the drop seat sounds like some of
[42:31] your fantasy football wide receivers
[42:33] here's a guy who's got the dropsy over
[42:36] here
[42:37] and he says is it lawful to heal in the
[42:39] Sabbath I mean he's kind of raising the
[42:41] question and they held their peace and
[42:44] he took him and healed him and let him
[42:47] go
[42:48] and answered them saying which of you
[42:51] shall have an ass or an ox fallen into a
[42:53] pit I know we say ditch but it's a pit
[42:56] which would have been you know because a
[42:58] ditch is maybe not something they would
[43:00] customarily fall into it but a pit
[43:01] they'd fallen into a pit and will not
[43:03] straightway pull him out on the Sabbath
[43:05] day and they could not answer him again
[43:07] to these things so there was they had an
[43:11] understanding
[43:12] or there was a Grace that was given
[43:16] that under certain circumstances it was
[43:18] lawful to labor
[43:21] and to not it to be to dishonor the
[43:24] Sabbath given the circumstances and this
[43:27] is what Jesus and just his way of
[43:29] provoking thought and bringing this
[43:32] challenge he says I I healed on the
[43:35] Sabbath now legalists the legal should
[43:37] be like oh you're wrong you're wrong
[43:38] you're wrong and he just kind of raised
[43:40] the question is there not a variance do
[43:42] you guys not have a variance that if
[43:43] something comes up and there's some
[43:45] circumstance that you have to attend to
[43:47] which one of you would not pull your Ox
[43:49] out of a pit on the Sabbath day if he
[43:51] fell into it
[43:53] and so this is I believe the balance to
[43:55] the carnal legalism
[43:57] because technically we should be
[43:59] legalist about it brother bam said he
[44:01] says you should better be in that manner
[44:02] for a while and I know maybe
[44:04] I'm taking some Liberty with the
[44:05] phrasing but he says ought to be in the
[44:06] manner and habit of going to church
[44:08] he says and if we want to be legalist
[44:10] about it then maybe that's a good thing
[44:11] to be a legalist about but it's a
[44:13] balance to that carnality sometimes that
[44:16] binds the people
[44:18] and and use it as a way because listen
[44:20] there's some people uh just feel such
[44:22] tremendous Liberty this morning maybe
[44:24] just to share these things there's some
[44:26] people who miss a little bit of church
[44:28] and they then miss church altogether
[44:31] because of the stigma that people put on
[44:34] those when they don't go to church and
[44:37] they miss a little bit and they get a
[44:38] little bit out of practice and because
[44:39] of the churches they've been a part of
[44:41] or the way they've been raised or the
[44:42] way it's always phrased it's like it's
[44:44] better to never go back
[44:47] than it ever is to just try again
[44:50] and I think it's a shame and I would
[44:53] hope that our church could be the type
[44:54] that welcomes Those whom we haven't seen
[44:56] in a while and it's not like oh well
[44:58] where have you been huh
[45:01] right and then know exactly you know
[45:02] it's been 368 days
[45:05] since you've been to church you know
[45:06] there's just a way of hey we all been
[45:08] there before and I could say this with a
[45:10] lot of Grace and I know my wife can
[45:11] testify to this God will put you through
[45:13] things to where you can understand why
[45:15] people go through tail spins and stay
[45:18] out of church not just for a couple
[45:19] weekends but a few years long times
[45:22] because that's just how nasty the devil
[45:25] is and that's just how nasty people
[45:26] profess to be Christians can be towards
[45:28] people that's where they find they're so
[45:30] wounded they're so discombobulated
[45:32] they're so hurt and so scarred toward
[45:34] they they're not even thinking about
[45:36] church they're just thinking about
[45:37] living just think about getting their
[45:39] breath back they're just thinking about
[45:40] uh not suffocating anymore and there's
[45:43] people that go for things and they stay
[45:45] out of church for a while and I believe
[45:46] there ought to be a Grace and there
[45:49] ought to be this understanding of what
[45:50] we're trying what we want to achieve in
[45:52] our own individual lives is a life
[45:54] that's pleasing to the Lord and we know
[45:56] this is part of it and not create a
[45:58] stigma in an atmosphere where it makes
[46:00] it harder for others to do what they
[46:02] need to do to please God
[46:05] there's a Grace if you miss church
[46:07] there's a Grace if you're not able to go
[46:09] there's a grace even if you've missed
[46:11] church for a long time there's Grace if
[46:12] you've been out of church for months
[46:13] there's Grace if you've been out of
[46:14] church for years
[46:16] there's a Grace for it
[46:29] I'm thinking of just the I think it was
[46:31] a
[46:34] um I just remember brother Amos Peterson
[46:36] tell me about it it was a glove
[46:38] commercial Dan Marino was in he said are
[46:41] you sick or no it was a glove commercial
[46:42] he did a glove commercial it was another
[46:43] commercial where Dan Ryan said are you
[46:45] sick and tired of being sick and tired I
[46:47] was like that's me
[46:49] and you know what I'm sick and tired of
[46:50] making other people sick and tired let's
[46:52] encourage one another
[46:54] let's not use the word as a blunt
[46:56] instrument to harm people or to try to
[46:59] you know make other people shorter so
[47:02] that we can feel taller
[47:04] there's a Grace in these things brother
[47:06] management has asked this question and
[47:08] again I think that we ought to be taking
[47:10] the message that we know always take the
[47:13] message that you know the message that's
[47:14] been revealed to you
[47:16] and and make what you hear fit within
[47:19] what we know so there's a lot more to
[47:21] the message than just these quotes he
[47:22] says also this is the second question to
[47:25] the prior question about brother Madam
[47:27] do you teach that only the bride should
[47:29] only go to church if you're preaching
[47:30] otherwise the Tabernacle so this is the
[47:33] second part also do you taste that we
[47:35] need not keep the Sunday or holy days
[47:36] holidays as working fishing or so forth
[47:39] and I I read the question several times
[47:41] even where brother Bannon refers to it
[47:42] again and I think you get the point
[47:44] based upon how he answers it he says now
[47:48] if you're you're away and there's some
[47:50] more here to this question but I'm
[47:51] answering it where he revisits it says
[47:52] now if you're away away into Wilderness
[47:56] somewhere and you're out there on a
[47:57] hunting trip and there's no church
[47:58] around or anything like that and there's
[48:00] nothing you can do and if you was
[48:02] fishing I believe that it would be all
[48:04] right what what is this what is it
[48:06] referring to the legalistic idea that if
[48:09] you're out somewhere on a Sunday and you
[48:10] don't make it to church that's sin
[48:12] right notice how that the legalistic
[48:15] thought would be that if you're not in
[48:16] church that's sin if you're not church
[48:17] that sin and he's looking at this
[48:19] question of well I mean if you're out
[48:21] somewhere hunting or you're not where
[48:23] there's Church he's in I believe that it
[48:25] would be all right and the way he's
[48:26] phrasing it and even what his own
[48:28] discipline was that even if he was
[48:30] somewhere where he could go to church on
[48:31] a Sunday he'd like to go because he so
[48:33] he says this but if you're around in the
[48:35] city or around where church is going on
[48:36] you should attend church by all means
[48:38] somewhere
[48:39] and I believe as far as working I
[48:41] believe the ox is in the ditch or
[48:43] something has to be done on Sundays you
[48:45] go ahead and do it if it's something
[48:47] that you couldn't help it had to work
[48:49] that way but if you just do it and wait
[48:51] till Sunday to do it or just do it like
[48:53] that you're wrong we must not do that we
[48:56] must respect that holy day
[48:59] there's circumstances that cause
[49:01] Believers to work on Sundays there's
[49:03] circumstances that cause Believers to
[49:04] miss church on Sundays there's some that
[49:07] it just happens on a regular interval
[49:09] and I think it would be wrong to
[49:11] establish some a legalist principle that
[49:13] discourages the believer
[49:15] and so you take it into your own heart
[49:17] how these things would impress upon you
[49:19] but what can we say from this go to
[49:22] church
[49:24] it's God's will that we assemble
[49:26] together
[49:28] now I spent a lot more time maybe on
[49:30] that part than I anticipated and so for
[49:33] that I apologize those things I think
[49:36] are important just to rehearse
[49:38] and to be reminded of but where have
[49:41] I've spent most of my time studying on
[49:43] this was
[49:45] from this standpoint I know you're all
[49:46] getting kind of nervous at 11 22 going
[49:48] he's just now
[49:50] getting to the part that he studied that
[49:53] I've been studying for decades now and I
[49:55] got to get it out today
[49:58] but it's looking at
[50:00] a point
[50:02] that's why I could say I don't think
[50:03] there's any debate that we should go to
[50:05] church that we ought to assemble
[50:06] ourselves together think it's clear in
[50:07] the scripture and it's been Amplified
[50:10] hundreds of times in the message of the
[50:12] hour
[50:13] but the part that I tried to consider
[50:15] it's going to be very easy for me to
[50:16] share this with you so I don't feel that
[50:17] there's uh there's a lot a lot of
[50:20] material here to share it's very very
[50:21] simple but the question is well why
[50:25] I'm sure we've all asked ourselves that
[50:27] question a lot of times I was like okay
[50:28] I know it's God's will for this but the
[50:30] why sometimes seems to escape us and I
[50:34] think that's where we need to be very
[50:36] careful in any principle of God but here
[50:39] with respect to going to church why do
[50:41] we assemble why ought we to attend
[50:43] church why is it the first one that's
[50:45] mentioned at least on my slide of the
[50:47] will of God for us this year is a 10
[50:48] church because it's good for us to
[50:50] consider that because often the context
[50:52] is missing
[50:53] and it's all important to have the
[50:55] context
[50:56] it's absolutely clear that it's God's
[50:58] will for us but why what is his purpose
[51:01] and US assembling and it's right there
[51:03] it's it's staring Us in the face if we
[51:05] could go back to Hebrews chapter 10
[51:07] verses 24 and 25 and let us consider one
[51:10] another to provoke unto love and to Good
[51:12] Works not forsaking the assignment of
[51:14] ourselves together as the manner of some
[51:16] is now there's a lot of rich
[51:19] teaching that we could use to identify
[51:23] what Paul meant by saying as the manner
[51:25] of some is there were some that were
[51:26] forsaken the assembly together whether
[51:28] it because of persecution or whatever
[51:29] the reasons might be Paul is saying
[51:31] despite
[51:32] the persecution despite the hardship
[51:34] despite what others may say it's
[51:36] important that we assemble ourselves
[51:38] together so he's saying gather together
[51:40] and he's telling us he's given us the
[51:42] reasons Paul does not give the
[51:44] Commandment without identifying some
[51:46] function or purpose in doing it does not
[51:49] give the command with it without kind of
[51:51] seeding to us what the reasons might be
[51:53] it's not just Hebrews 10 25 10 25 and go
[51:57] to church and then he moves on to
[51:58] something else it's kind of wrapped in
[52:00] this packaging of let us consider one
[52:02] another to provoke unto love and good
[52:04] works but exhorting one another and so
[52:06] much more as you see the day of protein
[52:09] there's there's meaning given to it
[52:11] there's purpose and sense as to why we
[52:13] assemble ourselves together if it was
[52:15] just merely be sure you get together uh
[52:18] we could do this at different times
[52:20] right
[52:21] in which much greater brevity right
[52:24] because it's just show up we'll be there
[52:25] we're just going to have a parking spot
[52:28] we're just going to be like a food truck
[52:29] right whatever's convenient we're going
[52:31] to be at the in the parking lot of a
[52:32] Home Depot and you just come by and once
[52:35] we get a quorum and enough people have
[52:36] gathered we just all hold hands and sing
[52:38] Kumbaya and then we just dismiss because
[52:40] it's like we gathered we were there we
[52:42] did it but there's more to it than that
[52:45] and I know you're all familiar with all
[52:47] the quotes about if you're and I'm going
[52:49] to paraphrase Elizabeth because I'm a
[52:50] little bit because I'm wanting to kind
[52:51] of aggregate a lot of different thoughts
[52:53] that if you love God or if you're a
[52:55] Christian you'll you love to go to
[52:57] church
[52:58] you'll be there every time the church
[53:00] doors are open
[53:02] right and every time I drive by their
[53:03] clothes so hey
[53:05] hey
[53:07] there's but there's a uh
[53:09] there's so many quotes like that that we
[53:11] could share with you that the real
[53:12] Christian goes to church you love to be
[53:13] in church you love to be there when the
[53:15] doors are open you'll be there every
[53:16] service there's a lot of statements that
[53:18] we can use
[53:19] um that we know that we're familiar with
[53:21] but I went through as many as I possibly
[53:23] could find in searching and reading
[53:24] dozens and dozens and over multiple you
[53:26] know from the beginning of the message
[53:27] to the end trying to find all the
[53:29] different places wherever I said go to
[53:31] church and you ought to go Church you
[53:32] ought to have a home church and you be
[53:33] your posted Duty in all these different
[53:35] places because uh what I wanted to find
[53:39] is what reasons does brother Branham
[53:41] give for this is it always just oh if
[53:44] you're a Christian you love to go to
[53:45] church uh when the church doors are open
[53:47] and that's it and it's kind of in a
[53:49] vacuum and it leaves us to wonder what
[53:51] is it about church like what are we
[53:52] missing and what is it all for
[53:55] but most statements imploring us to go
[53:57] to church or emphasize and attendance
[53:58] give reasons
[54:00] he identifies something in there that's
[54:03] just not questioning whether or not you
[54:05] love God and questioning out whether or
[54:07] not you really want to go to church but
[54:08] it's saying the reason why we do go to
[54:10] church the reason why we want to go to
[54:11] church and and I'm just going to pull a
[54:13] few out because again it's not that
[54:16] there's
[54:17] just uh Decades of sermons that I could
[54:20] unfold from these these things that we
[54:22] studied but brother says I go to church
[54:23] for one thing that's to stay in your
[54:25] presence
[54:26] his presence
[54:28] no place we better come to church to do
[54:30] it is check up with God
[54:32] so we come to church to be in his
[54:34] presence we come into church to check
[54:35] and check up with God he says we come to
[54:37] church we've come for one purpose to
[54:39] Fellowship around the word and these are
[54:42] statements that you'll find that are
[54:43] near or within the context of if you
[54:45] love the Lord you'll go to church and
[54:47] you ought to have home church and you go
[54:48] to church and and these things he's
[54:49] emphasizing he says we we come for one
[54:52] purpose to Fellowship around the word he
[54:54] says to get in there this is why we come
[54:56] to church to get in here to fellowship
[54:57] with your brothers it says one place you
[55:00] to associate with the people who love
[55:02] the Lord
[55:03] like this is there's like this some
[55:05] bigger bigger purpose to this it says in
[55:08] one place to go there you go to church
[55:10] to worship and to go home refreshed
[55:13] you ought to have a clean feeling when
[55:14] you leave church not to be a refreshed
[55:16] feeling when you leave church uh there's
[55:18] it's you don't want you don't want to go
[55:20] to church that leaves a sticky residue
[55:21] when you're done
[55:22] right you want to leave feeling clean
[55:24] and refreshed you want to say yeah I I
[55:26] feel encouraged and not leave going well
[55:28] I thought I was a Christian but at least
[55:29] now I know I'm not a Christian
[55:32] uh but at least I know I want to be a
[55:35] Christian
[55:36] now that I know that I'm not a Christian
[55:37] at least whenever I do become a
[55:39] Christian at least I know I won't be
[55:40] pretending anymore
[55:41] like there should be something that that
[55:43] you're energized and you're refreshed
[55:45] and you're encouraged he says we come
[55:47] here to worship and to go home refreshed
[55:49] and so this is what Paul is this is
[55:51] what's uh part of his teaching in
[55:54] Hebrews 10 24 let us consider one
[55:56] another to provoke unto love and do good
[55:58] works
[55:59] we assemble as a as a means of exhorting
[56:02] one another
[56:03] and I know there's exhortation there's
[56:04] teaching there's preaching that goes
[56:06] forth from the pulpit brother man says
[56:07] church is for the preaching the word we
[56:09] know that Dynamic I believe that it's uh
[56:11] um that is maybe in itself a whole
[56:13] separate uh Avenue of emphasizing why we
[56:16] go to church is because this is God's
[56:17] original way of us receiving Faith this
[56:20] is how we understand God this is how
[56:21] there's so many ways that we could
[56:22] express the preaching Dynamic but it's
[56:25] we come to church he says a symbol
[56:28] consider one another to provoke unto
[56:30] love and do good works not forsaken the
[56:32] semon of ourselves together we have a
[56:34] duty to encourage one another
[56:37] this is so I know that we come to church
[56:40] to be encouraged
[56:43] and when you come to church with the
[56:45] need in your heart and you're coming
[56:46] with a heavy heart because you need your
[56:47] burden lighter you're coming to feel
[56:49] refreshed you're coming to be blessed
[56:50] and you come because you're maybe a
[56:52] little bit selfish and coming but did
[56:54] you know that when you arrive you bless
[56:56] somebody else but you're coming you're
[56:58] like well I'm here to get mine it's like
[57:00] well thanks for coming to get yours
[57:01] right my brother's still my brother
[57:04] Matthew never ceases to remind me that
[57:07] what when he met brother Lucas one time
[57:09] and he said it's good to see you brother
[57:10] Lucas and he says it's good to be seen
[57:12] right and so there's there's this kind
[57:15] of mutual dependency
[57:17] that that we're feeding off of when you
[57:19] come I'm coming because I need something
[57:20] from God and I show up very needy and
[57:23] I'm here because I need to be spoken to
[57:24] but and I see you came with your need
[57:26] and it encourages me
[57:28] because when we gather together there's
[57:30] this there's this Force multiplier that
[57:31] begins to develop there's something that
[57:33] begins to collect together pillars of
[57:35] fire licks of Fire coming together and
[57:37] we're an encouragement to one another
[57:39] you know how it feels I maybe a lot of
[57:41] us in our church experiences haven't had
[57:43] to do this but all right trying to
[57:45] remember maybe the first time well yeah
[57:47] get this you talk about God having a
[57:49] sense of humor one of the first times I
[57:51] ever preached at the church in Texas
[57:53] Christian Life Tabernacle on a Wednesday
[57:55] night one of the first times I preached
[57:57] I think my sermon title was on
[57:58] loneliness or no never alone and there
[58:01] was three people there
[58:03] word must have got out right
[58:05] for the Aaron's preaching at night well
[58:07] where do we go let's drive to Louisiana
[58:09] but I and and so there's you all may
[58:12] remember the times you come to church
[58:13] there's just a few people and it can be
[58:14] discouraging all right but then the more
[58:17] people come and you say well maybe it's
[58:19] if only three people in the church are
[58:21] in the church then you're happy when
[58:23] everyone's there so something about
[58:25] Gathering and people being together in
[58:27] the assignment together there's an
[58:28] encouragement one to another brother
[58:29] Branham says in the message perseverance
[58:31] now if you've got to post a duty you go
[58:33] there and it's how he's imploring the
[58:34] people not to you know he was always
[58:37] very careful that people just wouldn't
[58:38] come to his meeting
[58:40] and forsake their post to duty so he
[58:41] didn't even schedule Sunday morning
[58:42] services in different places he says
[58:45] that's what you're supposed to do always
[58:47] stand at your post of Duty that's your
[58:49] duty to God and to your pastor and to
[58:52] the rest of the congregation
[58:54] so the duty is not just to God but it's
[58:56] also to the church it's to the
[58:58] congregation we have a duty to one about
[59:00] to one another if you could take a
[59:02] summary from what Paul is saying in
[59:03] Hebrews 10 and we have a responsibility
[59:06] to one another to Faithfully Assemble
[59:10] it's not just my responsibility to God
[59:12] but it's my responsibility to you
[59:14] and in that way I think it does kind of
[59:16] change the tenor a little bit of of why
[59:18] we come because sometimes oh well I'm
[59:20] doing this and I'm doing that and we do
[59:21] this we do that but it's for somebody
[59:23] else's benefit
[59:25] this attending church and this is where
[59:27] I think it branches off into a lot of
[59:29] other areas but it promotes the sense of
[59:31] community amongst us as Believers it it
[59:34] establishes our common ground
[59:37] because we have things in common and
[59:39] it's it points to and and I'm going to
[59:41] try to hurry up and finish this as soon
[59:43] as possible it points to the it creates
[59:45] unity and just think about the power of
[59:48] unity
[59:49] of u19 and being of one mind and one
[59:52] Accord assembling together and having
[59:54] the same purpose and the same thought
[59:55] brother I've talked about it just in a
[59:57] church service if everyone could be on
[59:58] the same page and all doubt crossed out
[1:00:00] he said there wouldn't be a sick person
[1:00:01] amongst us and so there ought to be
[1:00:04] momentum building as we get grow as a
[1:00:06] church and as we have this pattern of
[1:00:07] assembling together and being
[1:00:08] like-minded and having the same vision
[1:00:10] and having the same purpose despite the
[1:00:12] multiplicities of callings and gifts and
[1:00:14] envisions that we might have and how it
[1:00:16] works on our lives that we do have
[1:00:18] something in common we have a word of
[1:00:19] God that we're lifting up we have a
[1:00:21] message that we believe and we have
[1:00:22] things that we're supporting things that
[1:00:24] we desire to see together that creates
[1:00:26] power because we're unified there's
[1:00:27] common ground
[1:00:30] brother Brown and the sermon the
[1:00:31] unwelcome Christ he says you know people
[1:00:33] who love the Lord they like to go to
[1:00:34] church
[1:00:35] because they have things in common
[1:00:37] we have common grounds for things we
[1:00:40] come here because we're Believers in
[1:00:41] this way of worship so it has something
[1:00:43] to do with recognizing that I'm part of
[1:00:46] something bigger than just myself
[1:00:51] the scripture talks about how beautiful
[1:00:53] it is how pleasant for Brethren to dwell
[1:00:55] together in unity
[1:00:57] this is this is part of what we do we
[1:00:59] dwelt together in unity it's common
[1:01:01] ground it's there's a basis of
[1:01:03] Fellowship
[1:01:04] and I want to close on this thought if
[1:01:06] you want to turn to Matthew chapter 18
[1:01:08] so we'll finish up our text
[1:01:11] we assemble together not just for the
[1:01:14] sake of assembling itself
[1:01:16] God's just not that way
[1:01:19] God God's intentional
[1:01:21] God's a god of planning I think I've
[1:01:24] said this before that men climb Mount
[1:01:27] Everest
[1:01:28] just for the sake of climbing Mount
[1:01:30] Everest
[1:01:31] but if God ever climbs a mountain he's
[1:01:33] got a reason for doing it Beyond
[1:01:36] climbing the mountain
[1:01:40] but there's so much this is what I want
[1:01:42] to close with the thought of just how
[1:01:43] much
[1:01:45] this there's it's a assembling together
[1:01:48] is a source the source of strength
[1:01:51] a a source of power
[1:01:54] in Matthew chapter 18 verses 18 to 20
[1:01:56] verily I send you whatsoever ye shall
[1:01:58] bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven
[1:02:00] whatsoever ye shall lose on Earth shall
[1:02:02] be loosed in heaven
[1:02:04] again I say unto you that if two of you
[1:02:05] shall agree on Earth as touching
[1:02:07] anything that they shall ask it shall be
[1:02:09] done for them of My Father which is in
[1:02:11] heaven this comes right after he said
[1:02:13] he's talking about bringing something to
[1:02:15] the church
[1:02:16] right in verse 17 how he told us you
[1:02:18] take it to the church if he does not
[1:02:20] hear you then then bring tell it unto
[1:02:24] the church that they neglect to hear of
[1:02:25] the church let it be as a heathen so
[1:02:27] he's brought into mind this assembling
[1:02:29] this relationship of brothers and
[1:02:31] sisters and whatsoever ye shall bind
[1:02:34] whatsoever ye shall lose whatever you
[1:02:36] agree on Earth is touching anything that
[1:02:37] you shall ask it shall be done for them
[1:02:39] of My Father which is in heaven for
[1:02:40] where two or three are gathered together
[1:02:42] in my name there am I in the midst of
[1:02:45] them
[1:02:46] one of the most common scriptures that
[1:02:48] we use of these assemblies one of the
[1:02:50] most common scriptures we use for our
[1:02:52] gathering together here is where two or
[1:02:54] three are gathered together in my name
[1:02:55] that's why we invoke his name when we
[1:02:58] open the Service in prayer that's why we
[1:03:00] praise His name when we worship because
[1:03:02] it's not just a gathering in vain but
[1:03:04] it's a gathering in his name and not
[1:03:06] just in the Church of Christ or the
[1:03:08] Church of Jesus Christ in a name only
[1:03:10] but it's something that's in harmony
[1:03:11] with this character it's something that
[1:03:14] aligns with his vision it's something
[1:03:15] that we know is his will for us and he
[1:03:18] says where two or three are gathered
[1:03:20] together in my name there am I in the
[1:03:22] midst of them
[1:03:24] so The Gather in a church where brother
[1:03:26] Madam says and wherever they meet that's
[1:03:28] the church it's not just a gathering of
[1:03:30] Believers but it's also a gathering
[1:03:32] together unto him
[1:03:34] it's where we know that he will be in
[1:03:36] our midst and I know that he's with you
[1:03:38] in your homes and I know that you
[1:03:39] experience his presence in your car and
[1:03:41] we've seen him move on the scene in many
[1:03:43] many other different places and God is
[1:03:45] Sovereign and God does that and he
[1:03:46] visits us in our prayer closet he visits
[1:03:49] us in our family devotions he visits us
[1:03:50] when we're doing domestic labors and
[1:03:52] visits us on the job site God is an
[1:03:55] ever-present God and this is one place
[1:03:57] that he's also present in and it's one
[1:04:00] place where we can have the history and
[1:04:02] the experience of Time After Time After
[1:04:05] Time After Time God meets us here and
[1:04:07] always know that when these Church doors
[1:04:10] are unlocked and we're having service we
[1:04:13] do it to invite his presence so that
[1:04:15] Jesus can be in the midst of us
[1:04:18] we're not just doing it so we can say
[1:04:20] well we're Believers and that's what
[1:04:21] believers do no Believers seek Christ
[1:04:25] where the fresh kill is where the man is
[1:04:27] where the word is where Christ is where
[1:04:29] the body word of the son of man is there
[1:04:31] where the Eagles be gathered together
[1:04:32] that's why you're here this morning is
[1:04:35] because you're wanting to gather around
[1:04:36] the things of Christ and feed on Christ
[1:04:39] [Music]
[1:04:41] maybe there's a lot more comfortable
[1:04:42] places we could go maybe there's a lot
[1:04:44] different things we could do and we
[1:04:46] could just purpose in our heart that as
[1:04:47] a group we're going to visit every state
[1:04:49] park in the state of Arizona this year
[1:04:50] but what we want to do is gather around
[1:04:53] the things of God
[1:04:54] and what we do is we gather around the
[1:04:56] things of God
[1:04:57] brother Branham in the sermon why Christ
[1:04:59] speaks as We Gather here for Spiritual
[1:05:01] strength we need it Lord we must have
[1:05:03] strength to endure the crosses that we
[1:05:06] bear
[1:05:09] these are one of the statements I came
[1:05:10] across in Reading
[1:05:13] trying to read in the message of why do
[1:05:15] we assemble I get it and I I go so far
[1:05:18] as to say this even if I never knew the
[1:05:20] why it's so clear in the word of God
[1:05:22] that we should go to church that I would
[1:05:23] just go to church knowing that one day
[1:05:25] I'll know why
[1:05:27] it's that clear but I studied it with
[1:05:29] the eye of Lord I want to see the
[1:05:31] reasons you give I want to know and
[1:05:33] maybe there's a maybe I'm leaving a lot
[1:05:34] to be desired but maybe these are things
[1:05:36] you can go in and find
[1:05:37] because there's so much more we can
[1:05:39] identify but this is one I came across
[1:05:40] We Gather here for Spiritual strength
[1:05:42] That's What We Gather for we need
[1:05:43] strength to endure the crosses that we
[1:05:45] bear
[1:05:47] I know you've heard this one before if
[1:05:48] you don't have a church you must
[1:05:51] see you'll die spiritually
[1:05:53] you'll just dwindle away
[1:05:56] now I know that what we when we think
[1:05:58] about that we think about the dwindling
[1:05:59] right
[1:06:00] where there's no vision that people
[1:06:01] perish so we think about the absence of
[1:06:03] vision and the perishing of the people
[1:06:05] when we think about if you don't have a
[1:06:06] church you just dwindle away spiritually
[1:06:08] and die and and that's what we imagine
[1:06:10] but we got to invert right invert always
[1:06:13] invert so the inverse is the Pow we look
[1:06:16] at the the power of church
[1:06:18] and it speaks more about the power of
[1:06:19] assembling than it does anything
[1:06:21] it doesn't necessarily speak to the
[1:06:23] corrupting nature of being out of the
[1:06:25] house of God as much as it speaks about
[1:06:26] the preserving nature of being in the
[1:06:29] house of God it's not the power to
[1:06:31] corrupt that bears upon you when you get
[1:06:33] out from under when you're no longer
[1:06:35] going to church it's you're away from
[1:06:37] your source of life
[1:06:39] it's more a stagnating it's more of just
[1:06:41] growing cold it's more of just dwindling
[1:06:43] away and withering away whereas if you
[1:06:44] stay in the presence of God then there's
[1:06:46] a strength and vitality and a refreshing
[1:06:48] that comes and so it speaks more to the
[1:06:51] power of assembling than it does the the
[1:06:53] negativity of not doing it
[1:06:56] so that that ought to be the drawing
[1:06:58] cars I I don't want to I better go to
[1:07:00] church because I don't want to dwindle
[1:07:01] away and die no I I'm going to church to
[1:07:03] get sustenance to get strength to get if
[1:07:06] the spiritual vitamins the things that I
[1:07:08] need in order to strengthen myself and
[1:07:10] carry myself through the work that I
[1:07:12] have to do
[1:07:14] he says you'll die spiritually you'll
[1:07:16] just dwindle dwindle away
[1:07:19] I'm going to quote Saint Ignatius for
[1:07:22] you brother Ignatius to some of you
[1:07:24] it says when you frequently and in
[1:07:26] numbers meet together the powers of
[1:07:28] Satan are overthrown
[1:07:30] and his Mischief is neutralized by your
[1:07:32] like-mindedness in the faith
[1:07:35] I like that should we put that on a
[1:07:36] plaque and rub it when we come in
[1:07:39] speaking of traditions when you
[1:07:41] frequently and in numbers meet together
[1:07:42] the powers of Satan are overthrown and
[1:07:45] his Mischief is neutralized by your
[1:07:47] like-mindedness in the faith
[1:07:48] we're neutralizing Satan's
[1:07:50] mischievousness today
[1:07:52] through our like-mindedness of faith
[1:07:54] when you gather frequently and in
[1:07:56] numbers the powers of Satan are
[1:07:57] overthrown I want you to purpose in your
[1:08:00] heart that every time you walk through
[1:08:01] those doors we're going to have a
[1:08:02] different doorway effect
[1:08:04] the powers of Satan are being overthrown
[1:08:06] I'm going to church with the purpose of
[1:08:09] over having the powers of Satan over
[1:08:10] them his mischievousness that he's
[1:08:12] trying to work in my life all the little
[1:08:14] Mischief he's doing all the little traps
[1:08:16] all the little things he's doing I'm
[1:08:17] going to church to expose his schemes
[1:08:19] I'm going to church to to thwart his
[1:08:22] plans I'm going to church to neutralize
[1:08:24] Satan against me
[1:08:27] my final thought for you is revisiting
[1:08:30] verse 25 of Hebrews 10.
[1:08:32] 25 he says not forsakening the semen of
[1:08:34] ourselves together
[1:08:36] as the manner of some is
[1:08:38] but exhorting one another
[1:08:40] in so much the more
[1:08:43] as you see the day approaching
[1:08:46] and notice how Paul then
[1:08:50] caps this whole thought off and I think
[1:08:52] it's this there's a lot more maybe in
[1:08:53] the context he's building it in
[1:08:56] but we don't forsake the semen of
[1:08:57] ourselves together but We Gather in
[1:08:59] order to provoke one another unto love
[1:09:01] and do good work so our gathering is to
[1:09:03] provoke good works our gathering is to
[1:09:05] provoke one another to love there's a
[1:09:07] there's a way that we're gathering
[1:09:09] together in such a way to see that we're
[1:09:12] inspiring this Gathering encourages and
[1:09:14] fosters love it gives opportunity to
[1:09:16] inspire to Good Works
[1:09:18] we do it because not only am I dependent
[1:09:20] upon you but I recognize you're
[1:09:22] dependent upon me there's this Mutual
[1:09:23] dependency that you're not codependent
[1:09:25] on me
[1:09:26] that we do not want a code dependency
[1:09:28] that creates the wrong kind of Dynamics
[1:09:30] and nor am I code dependent upon you but
[1:09:33] we're mutually dependent upon one
[1:09:35] another and we all view one another that
[1:09:37] way there's not a caste system in the
[1:09:39] Church of Christ there's not a there's
[1:09:41] not a hierarchy of you know levels and
[1:09:45] clicks to where certain people have
[1:09:46] these different uh places in terms of
[1:09:49] privilege and opportunity there's a
[1:09:51] there's a there's a common ground that
[1:09:52] we all share in Christ and We Gather to
[1:09:54] encourage love to Foster love to inspire
[1:09:57] one another the good works there's a
[1:09:59] reason why we're Gathering there's a
[1:10:00] purpose to it it's not just to check the
[1:10:02] box
[1:10:04] and then he says that we're exhorting
[1:10:06] one another and whether you want to say
[1:10:07] the Gathering or the exhortation is the
[1:10:10] much more
[1:10:11] but if it is the exhortation then it
[1:10:13] requires the Gathering and if it's the
[1:10:15] Gathering it requires the exhortation so
[1:10:17] now how you diagram this sentence it
[1:10:19] says and so much the more as you see the
[1:10:23] day approaching
[1:10:25] why would it be that we would have less
[1:10:27] assembly the closer we get to the
[1:10:29] rapture
[1:10:30] when brother Brandon even takes it to in
[1:10:32] the angle of that the later that gets
[1:10:34] the more assembling we ought to have or
[1:10:37] the more exhortation we ought to have
[1:10:40] but it's done with the day in mind
[1:10:43] decembering they gathered together the
[1:10:44] church is done with the day in mind
[1:10:46] what's the day the consummation
[1:10:49] the rapture
[1:10:51] we Assemble
[1:10:53] with the Rapture in view
[1:10:56] oh and as as the more as the day
[1:10:59] approaches so our gathering should
[1:11:01] always be with the mind to that day
[1:11:04] that it's never done absent that context
[1:11:07] and and if you read the New Testament
[1:11:09] all the writers were seemingly aware of
[1:11:12] that day this is the end and they had
[1:11:15] this there was this imminence there was
[1:11:17] this thought that we're Gathering
[1:11:18] because there's a consummation we're
[1:11:19] Gathering because there's going to be an
[1:11:21] end I think that there's a there's
[1:11:22] something missing whether we're
[1:11:24] Consciousness conscious about it or not
[1:11:25] there would be something missing or
[1:11:27] maybe this is the part that's missing in
[1:11:30] our church experience when we divorce
[1:11:32] this activity from the finality of the
[1:11:35] change
[1:11:36] that if we don't realize that every time
[1:11:38] I come in some ways something is being
[1:11:41] added to the translation when I come
[1:11:44] something in some way has moved the
[1:11:45] needle just another step further to the
[1:11:48] change and so I come and we exhort and
[1:11:50] we preach and we encourage one another
[1:11:52] unto love and the good works not just so
[1:11:54] that we can keep this going in
[1:11:56] perpetuity so that our children's
[1:11:57] children can have church but we're doing
[1:12:00] it so that we can get out of here and
[1:12:02] we're doing it with a day in mind and
[1:12:03] that changes everything
[1:12:08] and I thought the part that just so
[1:12:09] blessed me this past week and studying
[1:12:11] this I I never connected these things
[1:12:13] together but just in studying this
[1:12:15] scripture of assembling in the church
[1:12:17] and this thought of the church
[1:12:18] when we assemble every time we assemble
[1:12:22] we're very familiar with the concept
[1:12:23] that we're honoring the resurrection
[1:12:25] Billy Branham even says dishonoring
[1:12:27] ought to be in the legalist about it or
[1:12:29] ought to be in that manner for some time
[1:12:32] dishonoring the resurrection We Gather
[1:12:34] on a Sunday not the Saturday We Gather
[1:12:36] on a Sunday and what it's honoring the
[1:12:38] resurrection every Sunday there's an
[1:12:39] honor to what has been passed but also
[1:12:42] not only are we honoring the
[1:12:43] resurrection past but every time we
[1:12:45] assemble we're in the image of the
[1:12:47] Resurrection to come
[1:12:49] every time we gather together we are
[1:12:52] gathering in the image
[1:12:54] of that Gathering or that assembly unto
[1:12:57] the Lord in the air
[1:12:59] that's what it represents today
[1:13:01] anybody here between the ages of 18 and
[1:13:03] 21
[1:13:04] anybody
[1:13:06] I knew we had like an age group that was
[1:13:08] missing
[1:13:09] there's no one here today between 18 and
[1:13:11] 21. is there any way we can cut that out
[1:13:13] of the the video
[1:13:15] I hear that's why people go to church
[1:13:16] these days right it's just a
[1:13:19] just because there's a youth group
[1:13:20] foreign
[1:13:22] but if I did if we did have anybody in
[1:13:25] there I'd have them stand
[1:13:27] but did you know you're all just as
[1:13:29] close to 18 to 21 as anybody else
[1:13:31] brother Dale
[1:13:33] you and I are just just as close to 18
[1:13:35] as Elliot is
[1:13:38] right
[1:13:39] but that's that gathering in the air
[1:13:41] every time we Assemble
[1:13:44] it's a gathering that's in the image of
[1:13:46] the ultimate Gathering
[1:13:48] and this word not forsaken the
[1:13:50] assignment of ourselves together it's
[1:13:51] used in one other place this conjugation
[1:13:52] this exact phrasing and she used in
[1:13:55] second Thessalonians chapter 2 verse 1.
[1:13:57] I meant to include this one brother John
[1:13:59] I don't believe I did I include second I
[1:14:01] didn't think so I left out the the
[1:14:03] several things at the end just so I
[1:14:05] could have a little bit more Liberty and
[1:14:06] emphasis
[1:14:07] but in second Thessalonians chapter 2
[1:14:09] verse one now we beseech you Brethren by
[1:14:11] the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:14:13] by our gathering together unto him
[1:14:19] it is understood that Paul is referring
[1:14:21] to that gathering in the air the meeting
[1:14:23] in the air
[1:14:25] at the time of the resurrection and the
[1:14:26] change of our bodies where we will all
[1:14:28] be assembled as one great glorified body
[1:14:30] of Christ to the glorified Christ in the
[1:14:32] air
[1:14:33] that meeting in the air that triumphant
[1:14:35] Rapture that culmination of putting
[1:14:37] death under our feet he says I beseech
[1:14:39] you brother by the coming of our Lord
[1:14:40] Jesus and by our gathering together unto
[1:14:42] him and that's the image that's
[1:14:45] Gathering Together the assembling
[1:14:46] together the church meeting him in the
[1:14:48] bride meaning in the air but that's what
[1:14:50] we do every time that we have church
[1:14:52] that we come and he says there where two
[1:14:54] or three are gathered together in my
[1:14:55] name there am I in the midst of them
[1:14:59] and it's our gathering together unto him
[1:15:01] in a spiritual sense and that would be
[1:15:03] in a very that would be in a literal
[1:15:04] sense but this is a gathering to him in
[1:15:06] a spiritual sense
[1:15:08] This Is Us coming together around our
[1:15:10] mate the revealed word
[1:15:13] and that our gathering together in him
[1:15:14] is the assembly in the air that that's
[1:15:17] what we're all looking for that's the
[1:15:18] day we're looking for that's the the day
[1:15:21] we desire for us all to be together now
[1:15:23] brother ma'am uses this terminology a
[1:15:25] lot he says that if you if you don't
[1:15:26] like it loud here if you don't like
[1:15:28] shouting here you're not going to like
[1:15:29] it over there
[1:15:30] right and if you don't like assembly now
[1:15:32] hello come on somebody right if you
[1:15:35] don't like assembly now then you don't
[1:15:38] want to be there
[1:15:39] all right I just don't do good in crowds
[1:15:41] well you're not gonna like it there
[1:15:44] you're not going to have a lot of luck
[1:15:45] because it's going to be a lot in hell
[1:15:46] too right like if you don't want crowds
[1:15:49] you're in trouble
[1:15:51] and so this is the only place you're
[1:15:52] going to be lonely but this is this is
[1:15:55] what we got I want you to keep this
[1:15:56] image in your mind I'll invite the
[1:15:57] musicians to come now that this is
[1:15:59] something that you could keep in your
[1:16:00] mind that when we assemble it's in the
[1:16:03] image of that assembly
[1:16:05] and if and that image we're all healed
[1:16:08] and that image were all perfect and that
[1:16:11] image were all strong in that image
[1:16:13] there's no fear in that image there's no
[1:16:15] doubt in that image it's all all rated
[1:16:17] and goreful and Powerful then that's
[1:16:20] what this assembly holds the potential
[1:16:22] of
[1:16:23] and just think of what Paul meant when
[1:16:25] he gets set and used these very words
[1:16:27] that we ought to assemble ourselves
[1:16:29] together as that day approaches the more
[1:16:32] what a beautiful powerful reflection we
[1:16:35] are testifying today of that ultimate
[1:16:37] assembly
[1:16:38] [Music]
[1:16:40] and that's why we assemble ourselves
[1:16:41] together
[1:16:43] that's why we're here this morning
