TRANSCRIPT
========================================
acts chapter 28 verses 1 to 6. in reading this and understanding that we're going to be finishing this theories on barriers and boundaries you may feel like i've got a long ways to go to get to this scripture and i do and you might be thinking how is he going to loop this back around but i believe god's going to be able to do it and and i trust it will be a blessing to you acts chapter 28 verses 1 to 6. and when they were escaped they knew that the island was called malita and the barbarous people showed us no little kindness for they kindled a fire and received us everyone because of the present rain and because of the cold when paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and laid them on the fire there came a viper out of the heat and fastened on his hand he was bit by a snake and when the barbarians saw the venomous beast hang on his hand they said among themselves no doubt this man is a murderer whom though he hath escaped the sea yet vengeance suffereth not to live and so we understand this is after their shipwreck as he was on his way to rome on this island of malita gets bit by a snake the barbarous people there like yep he's getting what this is karma in their minds right he's getting what's coming to him he's survived the shipwreck and now he's getting his just desserts and it says in verse 5 and he shook off the beast into the fire and felt no harm and i want to come to that at the very end he shook off the beast into the fire and felt no harm how be it they looked when he should have swollen or fallen down dead suddenly but after they had looked a great while and saw no harm come to him they changed their minds and said that he was a god amen praise the lord god bless you can be seated oh how quickly the barbarians change their mind my title today is let's go forward and the i want to just kind of give you uh the road map for this morning's service i want to conclude on the subject of respect and then i want to kind of summarize the entire uh subject of barriers and boundaries and then i want to just kind of seal it with this message let's go forward and if that sounds like a three-hour sermon you expected it you get what you expect if it's a 30-minute sermon and that's what you think you get what you expect right so we'll either feel like 30 or feel like three i don't know i'm just going to preach but the uh so i know that may seem like there's a lot there i want to i want to conclude some things on respect and then i want to kind of just give a quick summary to the whole subject of barriers and boundaries and then conclude with a message in the same subject it's going to fit it's going to just seal in the subject of barriers and boundaries now on the subject of respect this is some review but maybe just a slight step forward just to seal up what we've been talking about on respect and at the core about uh the subject of barriers and boundaries is respect you'll find that you could probably look back through the other 12 parts we've ministered on this and realized that yes whether it be god being a god of boundaries and what that means to us is we must respect his boundaries and and however we looked at it even if you looked at god being boundless it's just it's the perspective or how you look at it in with respect to something and so there's different ways that respect is at the core of this and when it comes to our personal boundaries and even the barriers that we face in life and interpersonal relationships we find that the issue of respect has to do with respecting others but then also respecting ourselves and i would say and reinforce this as we've expressed this in the past that boundaries are about relationships uh relationships one to another and then the responsibilities we have to each other the responsibility we have to ourself with within um our calling and our position and i was pondering this last week and realized that you could define a relationship or come to understand uh the type of relationship someone has to somebody else and the kind of the character of it and the nature of it just based upon the respect and responsibility if you begin to define well that there's there's a there's a love there there's a reverence there there's this particular duty there's that particular duty you can say oh that person's a wife right just by describing how they feel about somebody and then the responsibilities they have to them you say oh well that person must be a dad so it's the respect and the responsibility that even defines a relationship and respect means to regard which is has its kind of roots in to judge or to consider to regard or to esteem someone or something and to esteem is to estimate to determine or to value something so respect uh has to re has to do with esteeming valuing judging regarding uh or determining valuing something and it comes from the phrase or the word to the very act of looking at someone and that's why you can use the word respect in its relationship and its position and you say well it's it's second uh in line with respect to the house on the corner you could use it in that terminology but the way we're looking is kind of this courteous treatment uh this considerate conduct that someone is due you say that he showed him the respect that he deserves or you respect him as an elder you respect them as your parents and and so this is something that when someone is do something because of their position they do something because of their calling or they do something because it's something that they deserve that is respect and i wanted to use this statement like wednesday night and we held it off till today and i want to use it just to show how important respect is and stay with me because this is a this is a hard saying he says our nation has come so little until they've even taken the jobs away from the men and put women out here in these places to 90 of them nearly are prostitutes that's a that's a hard that's a hard saying and talk about man being gone sure it's because they got woman out there in their jobs and they got so low down till they put women as peace officers on the street that's a disgrace to any nation yes sir now that's you'd agree that that's a pretty heavy statement now what you could i was fellowshipping with some brothers last week on this very statement and that has a lot of uh maybe shock value and the way that it's worded today especially today but then you try to that when you ponder what it is he's looking at and how women have left their place and men have left their place that's kind of the root of what he's looking at so even some of the language that might seem to be very shocking we kind of get down to it we realize the point he's trying to make so then he asked this question what are you going to do about it what do you do about it brother branham so he's asked what are you going to do about this situation where women are taking over men's jobs and men aren't in the place that they ought to be and society is losing uh uh losing its moral compass and the government is letting it happen what do you do you stormed the capital right right you you you protest you you refuse to submit you you you you enter into a revolution in a rebellion and and i believe we've read this statement from the last couple months now brother brahm said one of the beauties of the wesleyan revival is it didn't necessarily the overthrow of england like that was one of the beauties of the revolution i it didn't overturn the government there was still a spiritual revival and the government still stood and says what are you going to do about it brother branham i have to respect it he says i'm an american citizen i do what the big boss says do come on somebody maybe we should have read this before they started lifting all the masked mandates right maybe we should have read this before brother so and so joined the freedom convoy but this is i don't know if a brother has it but um says i do what the big boss says do think about that this is brother ramsay i don't agree with him this is wrong and he uses some really really charged language but he says this is i live in america and if if the government says to do it if this is what the big boss says do he says i do he says i have to respect it now notice the next point because i think this is even more important if a family ever loses its respect for the family the children lose the respect for the parents that family is tore to pieces respect is what holds together he says a family in which the children lose respect to the parents the family is tore to pieces then he says if a church ever loses respect of its pastor why that church is gone now i i don't believe he's suggesting that all of a sudden the next sunday the doors are locked and the windows are boarded up so the church loses something he said it's unmoored it's untethered it's gone and and maybe it even implies that it's eventually going to end in ruin if you lose respect for your parents the family gets tore to pieces you lose respect for the pastor why that church is gone and if a nation ever loses their respect to the supreme court and its decision decisions that nation has gone to pieces i believe he's making a very important point that we can take from it that respect is so important with in relationships uh from parents to children and husband to wife and even within the church and then he's even making this point on a larger scale to help us to understand how important it is within the family and within the church he said if you lose respect for those who are charged and entrusted with making decisions the supreme court those that would have been making these decisions that he's referring to here if you don't respect it that's where the nation goes to pieces isn't it interesting that he identifies how that the nation has gotten very very low but what's going to cause it to fall to pieces is when with people fail to respect those who are making decisions even if you disagree with them i hope i'm not losing any any friends this morning stay with me we're just reading the statement i'm not i'm not implying uh anything anyway besides maybe i'm a libertarian right so you you all of you could hate me then but it says we got to respect i'm not a libertarian we've got to respect those things because they're the big boss he's saying he's laying it out we've got to respect those things because they're the big boss he says but it isn't right in the beginning you can disagree you can feel that it's wrong it's immoral it's low he says but once if a decision has been made and this is the way that it is he's telling us that showing respect is important very important even in the face of disagreement he's saying that there has to be respect there within the family within the church even within our government and now again we're just trying to conclude these things on respect and so we've identified a number of scriptures that speak to uh the respect for one another and even how that love your enemy is to respect your enemy not this warm fuzzy feeling that if i gotta love my enemy like i love my wife no it's a respect you hold for him not so much eve with the proper discernment of what he is it's i know this is an enemy brother brahm said any person that is against the word of god is your enemy but that doesn't mean we treat him as the world would treat an enemy we do it as christ told us love your enemies so you still have that respect even if somebody's against the word of god you have respect for them so to love your enemy is to respect them and to regard them as an enemy but respect them for what they are they're a person there there's someone that god has made promises to because you want to look at them and say lord even though they may be an enemy today i have respect for what they can be saying for love thy neighbor as thyself it's a respect for your neighbor and to trespass against an enemy to trespass against not so much in their opinion but in the way that against the word of god against someone else to trespass against someone is an act of disrespect even the bible tells us whoa offenses will come but woe unto you from whom the offense has come and so where we were ending wednesday night and we went through matthew chapter 18 to examine this that the word in first corinthians 5 and 6 that the word admonishes us to not trespass against others over and over again even when the word is saying if somebody trespasses against you we ought to read that and say well then i i shouldn't be trespassing against anyone it's instructive to us and so where it admonishes us not to trespass against others and then to handle how to handle situations when we are trespassed against now i want to go through maybe eight or nine scriptures here and i want to do it very quickly so i've just provided them to you here so you could jot them down and i'm doing this just as an overview of how the the new testament recognizes a trespass somebody who may be against what you believe or get something against you personally or behave in a way that transgresses against your autonomy your christian liberty and notice how the word of god is bringing it up saying this is what we ought to do in matthew chapter 18 verse 15 mo moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone you go to them just you too nobody else and if he shall hear thee thou hast gained thy brother what does the bible continue to tell us jesus says that if he won't hear you you bring two you bring a witness and two witnesses and then if they won't hear them then you bring it to the church and if he still refuses to hear he's to become as a heathen man and the publican and so if your brother does not res if your brother does not hear he does not listen does not understand and the bible even says if he does not repent then you are to respect him as a heathen and republican in other words relationship changes when respect is lost brother branham says it that's what happens if a family ever loses respect the families toward appeases if the church loses respect the church is gone uh and and there's this there's this idea that relationship is lost and relationship changes and so if you continue we'd say if you want to have friends show yourself friendly if you if you want to lose friends show yourself unfriendly show yourself disrespectful and a true friend is eventually going to say you know what you can't treat people that way and even to the point towards like you you hold people accountable for the way that they act and the way that they talk and the things you do and eventually it's like you know what i've been long-suffering i've been patient i've been kind but i cannot continue to allow you to abuse to mistreat and conduct yourself in this way so i'm going to draw a line oh you're just not going to have everything to do with me anymore no that's not what i'm saying i'm saying but our relationship changes from this day forward something is lost when respect is lost in first corinthians chapter 5 verses 1 to 13 paul is saying not to keep company not to eat to put away from yourselves anyone that's an idolater a fornicator somebody who uses force to get something anybody who's greedy or verbally assaults or is very anyone who's a drunkard he's saying these very specific phrases don't keep company not to eat put away from yourselves this wicked person first timothy chapter six verses three to five if any man teach otherwise and consent not to wholesome words even the words of our lord jesus christ and to the doctrine which is according to godliness he's gonna tell you what they are he is proud knowing nothing but doting about questions and strifes of words where have cometh envy strife railings evil surmisings perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds and destitute of the truth supposing that gain is godliness in other words those who are rich and have possessions use it as evidence that they're righteous or right and he says from such withdraw thyself that's quite the command keep away have no communion have no fellowship from such withdraw yourself from those who fit these characteristics he writes again in second timothy chapter three verses one to five very familiar to us this know also that in the last days perilous times shall come for men shall be lovers of their own selves covetous bolsters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful unholy without natural affection truce breakers false accusers incontinent fierce despisers of those that are good traitors heady high-minded lovers of pleasures more than lovers of god having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof that's a mouthful from such turn away i'm saying avoid them in titus chapter 3 verses 9 and 10 but avoid foolish questions and genealogies and contentions and strivings about the law for they are unprofitable in vain a man that is a heretic after the first and second admonition reject so a heretic may be admonished once even twice he says after that reject them they're very instructive and again i'm not maybe giving context to them just reading these so that you see that there's a uh treat him as a heathen man and a publican and from such withdraw myself from such turn away avoid and reject and romans 16 uh 17. now beseech you brethren mark them which cause divisions and offenses contrary to the doctrine which you have learned and avoid them you've been taught something you mark those who cause division and walk differently and cause offenses contrary to the word which you've been taught he says avoid them 2 thessalonians chapter 3 verse 6. now we command you brethren in the name of the lord jesus christ that you withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh this orderly and not after the tradition which he received of us again you notice the there's a theme here in a lot of different places and then in second thessalonians 3 14 and if any man obey not our words by this epistle note that man and have no company with him that he may be ashamed i hope that you understand i'm just reading these things to you so that you can see these are principles in the word of god and as with any principle in the word of god you must pray for revelation that god would reveal to you what it means but then also that god would buy revelation reveal to you whatever application that might have in your life because what's more important is that we get a revelation and we obey by revelation than just beating into everybody by education well you know the bible says this and the bible says that then you get very very very strict very rigid and you might seem to be technically in compliance with what paul said well i'm just marking those that cause divisions and i'm avoiding them but you've completely left the spirit of it out and you can never actually fulfill it if you're not doing it in the spirit that wrote it so these were just mentioning these so that you could see wow it's amazing just how often the word of god is telling me that i can draw a line ii john 10 and 11 if there come any unto you and bring not this doctrine receive him not into your house neither bid him god's speed for he that biddeth him god's speed is a partaker of his evil deeds aren't we all glad we don't ever say god's speed anymore right because that would really make us complicit and those and there's a lot of meaning behind this to where it's not just that we give everybody a questionnaire and says are you bringing the doctrine of ii john and then if not say well i can't have you in my home there's obviously more meant to this but at least we could say there's some place in the word of god that's identifying some circumstance where this is applicable they're not to be received into the house neither bit of god speak because to bid somebody god's feeder to give them the blessing is to partake in his evil deeds so just looking at all these scriptures you can realize that there's a there's a point at which a limit that is reached or something that is violated and in the violation the word of god is saying that you have a duty to respond to particular error you have a right to respond a particular way and say that in in light of this something changes this is this is a line that's crossed and then i have this responsibility to conduct myself and to regard something a particular way so i'm mindful of the nature of their transgression and and i use some discernment and caution some a different kind of respect or regard in this instance and i would put it this way that the bible is telling us to use boundaries to divide define our relationship with anyone that would fit these categories instead of just barriers to ignore them and you'll find that the bible is very deliberate in the way that uh the uh the scripture um and i don't even know if i finish this it says if any man obey not our word by this epistle note that man and have no company with them that he may be ashamed so paul is not just there's this there's this he's interested in a conduct that not only protects your faith and and keeps your spirit clean but that it kind of has this reciprocal of a response and every action has an equal and opposite reaction that this one who's offending me realize oh wait a minute this conduct isn't right there's a consequence for this conduct and that that would prick the heart of a real son of god and a daughter of god to be like oh i'm sorry i need to make this right which is exactly what jesus is detailing says if you go to your brother and him alone and tell him that he's offended you a brother who's understanding what you're saying and say i'm sorry i said that if he doesn't quite get it the first time the second time he'll get it and a brother who doesn't quite get it the second time the third time he'll get it and somebody who doesn't get it the third time he's really not a brother treat him is not not a brother right it's just it's almost common sense that someone who realizes there's been a transgression or who recognizes they've done something wrong is going to take steps to repent and to make it right and so we're not just using barriers to ignore an offense or using barriers to keep your distance or use barriers to try to just avoid the situation but it's a proper conduct in face of opposition or persecution or trespasses or offenses to preserve your integrity remain steadfast uh as brother loyal ministered i'm gonna have a steadfast faith i'm gonna persevere through this but then also have this uh kind of conduct that brings about a conviction as brother reggie was mentioning to the young people this reproof which is this exposure with the view to correction we're like oh i've harmed i've transgressed i've done something that's not right i want to correct this and i believe the word is clearly authorizing us as believers to use judgment to use discernment about these things now as we've read these several scriptures and that say from such withdrawal myself from such turn away avoid reject avoid them withdraw yourself have no company with them neither bid them god speed or receive them into a house don't not to keep company treat them as a heathen man and republican boom boom boom boom all these different things what's the purpose of that limit what's the purpose for that kind of protective decision or or what's the purpose for establishing that standard defining that boundary that we could walk together but to this we can have this kind of discourse this kind of conversation we can have this kind of fellowship but it's at this point that we draw the line and maybe to help you to understand that in a church there's those that we can have free fellowship with and we treat them as a brother and sister and we and they have every rights uh that a brother and sister would have within the church as far as fellowship and opportunity to come to service but there are certain situations or things that they might want to do or offices they might want to hold or certain services they might want to perform but there's a standard that if they violate that they might lose that opportunity you understand that so it's in the same way that we might have that dynamic within church of god there's a certain thing where we could treat somebody as a brother we can treat them with respect we can love our neighbors as ourselves we can love our enemies and we can do good unto those especially those in the household of faith but we realize this we're not being compelled to do things that transgress the word of god compromise the word of god or defile our spirits so there's a standard that's lifted up and why is the standard there as we read already from first corinthians chapter 5 in verse 6 he says your glory is not good know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump so in the very context of paul saying this sin is bad and you guys were puffed up and you didn't recognize how bad that was and even from where i was i judged it already and when you get back together you judge this because do you not know that as christians we're going to judge angels we're going to judge the world should we not judge matters that pertain to this life should we not have discernment even even the smallest matters this is what he's telling the church and he says and this is the principle that just kind of is at the core of all of it because a little leaven leaveneth the whole lung that's what he's looking at just a little bit of the the wrong kind of attitude towards sin the wrong kind of welcoming to the wrong to the wrong kind of nature it's gonna have the it's gonna when it runs of course everyone's gonna be affected by it know you not that a little eleven eleventh the whole proverbs chapter 22 verses 24 25 make no friendship with an angry man and with a furious man thou shalt not go this is a very plain plainly articulated scripture make no friendship with the man that's angry speak steve a character you could probably use this in an instance just use it when a man is angry let's you know you might want to keep your distance right the bible talks about you know it's better to live in a shack than it is a large house with a railing woman or a a um a loud woman it's these are relationship parameters these are this is wisdom from the scripture god and say well if somebody's angry maybe you don't want to conduct yourself in a familiar way or a friendly way you have to keep your distance make no friendship with an angry man and with the furious man thou shalt not go why why that seems really really strict us angry men are like why why well let's thou learn his ways and get a snare to thy soul i mean this is very instructive that if you go with a man that is fierce if you make a friendship with someone's angry it it's uh it's contagious it can be it can it can go viral and you can catch something and you can all of a sudden you find you you make friendship with an angry man and all of a sudden you're like i'm angry too that makes me upset i never thought i could be this angry and it's all because the person got you all riled up like i never thought i'd have a take on that and and there's it's it's instructive make no friendship with an angry man if somebody's furious don't go with them you're going to get caught up in the mob mentality there's it's something that's contagious there's a con emotional contagion with these things it's a real danger to social media networks whether it be whatsapp or facebook just the way things can kind of sweep into your spirit you take up causes there's an emotional contagion that's with that with respect to these friendships and these bonds that we form you'll learn his ways and it's not just learning his ways but you're going to get a snare to your soul it hinders your spirit it brings you down paul says it again in first corinthians 15 33 be not deceived evil communications corrupt good manners so if you're around criticism and constant negativity and and uh just rumor-mongering whatever it might be says this is going to corrupt your conversation it's going to corrupt your attitude and your spirit the way you conduct yourself it says it in second timothy chapter 2 verses 16 to 17. i hope you can see how these things are sewn into the fabric of this this broad picture of conduct and attitude this is the reason why there's a limit this is the reason why there's a standard this is the reason why there's a protective barrier shun profane in vain babbling for they will increase under more ungodliness not they may not that it's possible or probable but that it will increase under more ungodliness it could we do could the holy spirit do some identifying in our lives or maybe we could do a little bit more some discerning in our own life and realize i i have engaged in a lot of profane and vain babbling and that's the re that's the cause to the ungodliness in my life there's a direct causal connection he's not saying there's a correlation he says they increase under more ungodliness it's just going to get this momentum and increase into moral and goddess profane and vain babblings are ungodly and they only increase under moral guidance it said their word will eat as doth a canker he calls out some names but we just left them out he says those words they eat these uh profane and vain babblings eat they eat at your spirit they're corrosive the more negative you speak about somebody the more negative you're going to feel about somebody anymore there's a lot of situations where it's like i just would rather not know like i i know the situation i know how they are i know this situation i know that situation i've heard it we agree i have the same appreciation for its lack of integrity i have the same appreciation for how wrong it is how immoral it is how it whether it doesn't comport with our constitution or whether this is shouldn't be happening that should be i get it but the more negative that you feed on the more negativity you hear the more just begins to defile your spirit defile your spirit defile your spirit and it eats as a canker it's gonna eat up your joy it's gonna eat up your peace it's gonna eat up your happiness it's gonna eat up your enthusiasm and eat up your ambition it may not take away your salvation but all the things that salvation is supposed to purchase you just got something where it's like at the end they go i have to get vaccinated i have to wear masks but thank god i'm saved it's like man come on there's more to life there's more to experience there's more to enjoy but we let things eat away eat away at our spirits i'm glad that they're starting to lift these things so you could talk about them without it being too much of a a a sore subject with some people remember the statement we read on wednesday night brother brown says temper breeds temper the family's fussing and you're being ridiculed you're being mistreated being disrespected he says no don't this is me using summary language don't respond you know if you fight back you fight fire with fire you're just gonna get a bigger fire what do you fight fire with water right did i get it right fire fire people fire persons are we being politically correct in 2022 uh the firemen amongst us you fight fire with water now i realized to the hot shots around hill there's certain instances where you might remediate and do certain things with fire before the fire comes but what you do if you want to put a fire out you're going to fight it a certain way brother i'm saying don't use fire to fight fire don't escalate it don't if they get angry and you fuss you're just going to take their spirit on you he says could temper breed's temper and we were using it in this sense especially in light of what brother i'm saying there's people you love to be around and he says there's people you can't stand to be around he said but they're good people but they're critical they're caustic they're crunching things down he says and it kind of affects you it breeds something in you we receive thoughts we receive seed and it begins to grow in our spirits he says and so this the reason why the scripture is so detailed in these many different instances about drawing the line is because disrespect breeds disrespect if somebody transgresses the word of god and you don't have the right respect towards it then guess what happens it makes it easier for the next person transgress the word of god slight deviation from the word of god just begins also slightly everybody's ah it doesn't really matter what's going to happen years later you get so far away from the truth you get so far away from the standard and everyone stand in the spot and they all feel justified because they don't recognize the incremental process they went through to get to the place that they are and people can love it and embrace it and it may seem like it's perfectly justifiable but it was because some standard is violated and it just breeds more and more and more remember in the very context of that statement we are atmosphere creators we have the ability to create an atmosphere and not just good ones can i get a witness we can create bad atmospheres we can do things that bring breed negativity and bring a dourness and a sourness in our spirits and so the bible tells us that we too we're to be heart keepers we have to guard our hearts we're to watch over our spirits we're to watch over our bodies why because they're the lords we we protect our bodies the body's a temple our spirits are need to be kept clean we guard our hearts we keep our hearts we are called and tasked with being wall builders build up the walls of jerusalem oh lord let us build up these walls let us clearly define our relationship to the lord let us clearly define our relationship to the world lord let me build up the standard lift up these things that are righteous and holy that i might keep my spirit clean so that in the time and the moment that i need access to the word of god that i i need your virtues to be flowing freely through me there's not a lot of barriers that are in the way and so that that concludes the thought on respect and now i want to again visit in general the subject of barriers and boundaries and there are two different things barrier a barrier to boundary or two different things and it's important that we recognize the difference and if it seems like i'm backing up i am i'm just taking a step back just to kind of give this overview as we we conclude a boundary indicates the limit of something and it's uh maybe a very important way of describing is the boundaries the dividing line and in the very beginning god laid out boundaries and there's a dividing line what could be done what couldn't be done we saw the image of the moon and the stars and where he hung everything and he placed everything and and and it it became a controlling agent even over certain things upon the earth and gravity and so boundaries the furthest point of something our property extends to this border or this extends to this boundary it's a dividing line it's the limits of something but a barrier is something that obstructs something that gets in a way a barrier is an obstacle a barrier there could be a wall and there could be an entrance and there's a door but you wouldn't the door is not a barrier the door is the proper point of entry through the wall you don't climb over it you don't dig under it you don't tear it down you go to somebody's house you don't just bang on the garage door let me in you go to the front door and you knock you don't you don't find a window that's open or you don't say this this spot here looks easier to plow through than any other you observe the doorway as the proper way to enter within the boundary and you park on the driveway of the street not the lawn right there's just these appropriate places this is just real simple today just we're getting right where the rubber meets the roads stop parking on people's lawns and i just know there's probably a situation where somebody is right now going i can't that is so petty i can't believe they told him that like why would they even text brother aaron and tell him that it didn't happen it didn't happen maybe just discernment this morning you better all be careful but a a barrier is something that would obstruct your way into something you have a door and that's the proper way to get in but there might be a barrier that's put there and it's trying to keep something out that otherwise would be able to get in and it's important to kind of recognize the difference what a boundary is what a barrier is because we used it this context we're just using a language to understand principles god uses boundaries but satan uses barriers and where the trick is sometimes we see a boundary and in our minds you think oh well that's just a barrier uh let's just get rid of that because it's just a barrier keeping us from fellowship but in reality it was a boundary that god had said or you might see something said oh well that's just a uh that's just a um you see something says oh that's a boundary uh we we ought to not do it but it's just a barrier and we're misunderstanding that one is just trying to get in the way to keep you from enjoying the limits of something whereas something else is the actual limits of enjoyment so god is the one that sets and respects boundaries he even does it for us does he not he respects our limits he respects our boundaries but satan's the one that sets barriers and he's constantly disrespecting boundaries and as we look at boundaries and if boundaries is a the limitation of something or it's a dividing line it's interesting that you could begin to look at the word of god and say well it says i can't do this it says i can't do that and it says this is appropriate but this isn't appropriate and certain people look at the word of god and say i'm fenced in i'm caged in but the boundaries of the word of god are not put there to bind us or bring bondage but to put us in the right channel so that we can we can live as overcomers god knows the way that we are made he knows the heart of man he knows what our purpose is he knows what our calling is and so the boundaries give us a true power and a true sense of identity think about how crazy the world is getting when when a child is born say well you can't assign a gender all right and just how confusing a life would be if it's like well mom i think i'm a boy will you just give it time you know you just give it time and he said well you know what you're right mom i thought about it i'm just a girl and says well now you've discovered two but there's more right that you just live on a spectrum you live on a scale there's this fluidity that you can have within yourself that's untethered from biology and you can kind of just pick and choose whatever you want to do that's just going to generate so much more chaos because how is a person ever going to understand and recognize what god has equipped them to do and what they're calling in task is if everything is without boundaries without uh borders without callings without limits it's important in order to have a true sense of identity and that true sense of identity is not a bondage it's not a restraint it's liberating to recognize who you are and so it was in this that we referenced we use the subject of the pride paradox and how that we have to have a a good pride has to be there's a healthy sense of self there's a proper perspective as the bible says you ought not to think more of yourself than you should but by the inverse you shouldn't think less of yourself a lot of times we kind of hit on why are you you know he that stands you know better think twice lest he fall and you say i want to think more of yourself but i don't fulfill the scripture by thinking less of myself if the way up is down it's not that we would be so self-effacing and we'd be so uh down on ourselves and haunted ourselves that we would miss the true promise of god to us so there must be a healthy pride that in order to set boundaries and say this is my limit and there must be a healthy pride in order to defend those boundaries and know what god's called you to a healthy pride to say you know i know god called me to do this i know god's called me to be this person i know this is who i am and and it takes some unction and it takes some persistence and perseverance for someone to step into that i know someone says well that's a little bit arrogant that's a little presumptive you say well no this is what god's called me to do that's a healthy sense of calling that's a healthy sense of pride and then once you're in that call and it takes a real healthy pride to be perseverant to be adamant no this is what he called me to do i'm going to be persevered i'm going to hold out to the end you can't cause me to waver and then anyone coming and says well you know that you're really not a christian you know you really shouldn't be doing you know and you're like oh well oh oh maybe i'm not it takes some healthy pride to stand there and say i'm standing on god's promises i'm standing on god's word and so there's a it has to take a healthy sense of pride but not too much pride right unless you step out of your parameters step beyond your calling step beyond what god's called you to step beyond really who you are or even worse you step beyond somebody else's limits can have too much pride to where you disregard or disrespect somebody else's boundaries but then you don't want to have so little pride to where all you can use is barriers excuses it's the pride paradox this is this is i think this is review obviously and then in setting limits in setting limits we we felt to examine the myths regarding christian liberty and christian virtue that there's certain scriptures in luke chapter six and matthew chapter five where it kind of paints this picture of somebody who is weak and just has to give in to every beating and get it give in to every every abuse and every situation we found that meekness is not weakness but meekness is to actually have power but choose not to use it and that there is a there's a there's a kind of a misunderstanding of christian virtue where the christian virtue then opposes personal liberty and that we have the right to say no and there's times when we absolutely have to say no because there's conditions that humans and christians in the natural there's conditions that humans cannot exist in and in the spiritual there's conditions that god does not demand that you stay in and that god knows your limits and recognizes this this is even in the sense that love has limits it knows your limits and knows you cannot you can only go so far and god's not going to demand that you stay in a situation that's going to destroy you demoralize you strip away your faith so you can have confidence that if you cannot stand that situation there's going to be a grace that god's going to give you in it to bear up against it because he knows your limits we looked at the scripture how turning the other cheek was not to invite to be smacked als likewise on the other cheek but according to the message of the hour and even the way that jesus expressed it that when someone disrespects you and tries to condemn you and and show a force and a certain dominance over you you respond in such a way that rebukes the offender you don't run away from them you don't freeze but you also don't fight but you have a way to say well why did you do that brother and it ought to be the kind of conduct that's attention grabbing number one you don't have power over me you don't scare me and you're not bigger and stronger than me so that i feel like i've got to fight you because it's the fighting back that makes them feel like see i'm the bad boy here they feel like they've got to fight me you don't fight back justifying their power over you vindicating their their their little thoughts that they have towards you it's a way that you respond that rebukes the offender and sets the limit that's not right and in that context you'd know that once they were put on notice that continue again we have a saying in arizona fool me once shame on shame on you for me once can't fool me again right is this point we say no sorry i've got to draw the line in proverbs chapter 22 verse 28 this is my final uh um i i i could say just principle scriptural principles on the subject just to kind of bring it to a head and then use let's go forward as the climax the capstone of it proverbs chapter 22 verse 28 says remove not the ancient landmark which thy fathers have set how many are familiar with this scripture different places in the bible that refer to similar situations remove not the ancient landmark which thy fathers have said the hebrew word landmark means boundary remove not the boundary remove not the set of bounds something that's been marked out and made very distinct sound elsewhere in the scripture it says that there's been a mark set and it says this is yours this is your inheritance this is yours to enjoy don't remove the boundary now you might not think oh well i want to move it because if i move it then then perhaps that gives me greater uh greater territory but as soon as you remove the boundary you've lost the authority now that the boundary's been removed the boundaries in question who's to say that you're not going to lose territory think think about it oh well i'm just expanding my borders i'm just well now there's a border dispute and when you begin to dispute it you've removed the landmark you've removed the standard isn't it amazing how some people fight against the standard as soon as you remove the standard something bad happens like well wait a minute that's not what i meant it's like well you that's what you wanted right uh this is what you thought it meant when we talked about equality or equity this is what you thought this is what you were this is what you're championing this is what you're asking for you got what you asked for now you don't like the results i think god had a better idea in the beginning didn't he his word his word knew he knew exactly what he was doing when he gave us his word he knew human nature he knew how far things could go he knew how bad things could get he said i'm going to set a standard and if you just follow this it's going to harmonize everything even to the point is like you don't need a king i can give you a prophet if you follow my word you won't ever need a king what did israel do is like no no we really really want a king well if you get a king this is what's going to happen ah that's fine we still want a king and guess what happened exactly what god said god knows he understands us so in that boundary and that mark there's even the the sense of if you remove the boundary and deuteronomy chapter 19 that the meaning that's even set forth in proverbs 22 and in deuteronomy 19 14 is that remove not the boundary don't defraud your neighbor it's even kind of the idea behind an easement and and kind of this separation that you don't want to build right on the property line because even though you're enjoying and it's the use and enjoyment of your property right at the property line that wouldn't be fair to the neighbor because if he wanted to do the same thing he wouldn't be able to right anybody ever build a house and like you mean i can't build right up on the property line no it has to be ten feet offset why it's out of respect to your neighbor so that they're also 10 feet off and there's 20 feet be between your houses that's why our neighborhoods look like they do in the valley is these i this idea of of showing respect you don't want to take advantage of your neighbor you don't want to disrespect your neighbor so there's this don't push the limits don't don't overstep the boundaries says thou shalt not remove thy neighbor's landmark which they of old time have set in thine inheritance which thou shalt inherit in the land that the lord thy god giveth thee to possess it i can say this these things were set for a reason and even if it may seem to be an offense to you and a transgression to you this is something you respect it's set for a reason respected even deuteronomy 27 says if you remove your neighbor's landmark you're cursed if you do that's just i'm just using these principles to understand boundaries are important they're so critical they're they're replete to the word of god i'm going back through the the dozens probably over 100 pages of notes of just from the message alone on this subject how broad it is and how deep it is on how this subject and again you say well it's just terminology i would agree it's just maybe a term that you use and you can just fit things within this paradigm and i recognize that but i don't want you to get the paradigm i want you to get the principle but these things are very important in the word of god jeremiah 6 16 thus saith the lord stand in the ways and see and ask for the old paths where is the good way and walk their end and you shall find rest for your souls walk in the way ask for the old paths ask for the good way that means it's something that's marked out it's something that's been traversed it's something that's been set these are parameters this is the right way to walk this is the right way to go this is a this is a clearly defined path this is where you want to be it says but they said we will not walk therein if i could say this in a very specific yet broad way to the subject of barriers and boundaries the word has been established we have been given the word we have got our confidence is restored into the bible restore we have a confidence in this written word of god we have a confidence that this bible is right and though some of us may carry different translations we know that ultimately it's the thought that's contained in the remix the thought that's contained in the letter and if you read a spanish bible you read a french bible if you have a the living bible and someone else has the king james american standard whatever it might be we might hold to a particular version because we see that it more adheres to kind of the original intent and certain things but we have to have the confidence that god is the one who has watched over this translation and it's not so much the letter but there's a spirit that's contained in it and that god will make himself known in it and we've got confidence in that the word has been given to us the message of the hour has been delivered if there's a specific number of tapes that that have been recorded and have been preserved and been provided a certain number of books that have been translated and printed then we have to have confidence that what god has preserved and what he has made available that in there are things that i need and i can have confidence and i can believe in and that it will give me faith we must stay within its protection we must respect its tenants if it says something no matter how hard it is we must have a respect towards it i would even go so far as to say if there's things in the bible and things in the message of the hour that you may not agree with be very careful that you still respect the respect is very important and as the bible is telling us to to remove not the ancient landmark but then even says remove not thy neighbor's landmark which they've set in thine inheritance we never want to disrespect a landmark we never want to disrespect a boundary and so that may make us cautious right now anything that is a bump and anything that's a hedge and anything that's a wall anything that might be in our way we just think oh i want to respect it but at the same time we're to never respect satan's barriers we can't stop rather at satan's barriers because you have not been called to just always stop where satan's built something well i guess satan built a wall well i guess satan did this i guess satan did that and you start looking at all these walls that's not how god made us pro psalms chapter 18 verse 29 for by thee i have run through a troop that's an obstacle impeding forward progress a troop would be a a band of soldiers i have run through a troop and by my god have i leaped over a wall that wall was a false boundary that wall said you can't come in but you've been called by god to go and so if there's a troop in your way you can run through it if there's a wall in your way you can leap over it he says by my god i can run through a troop by my god i have i can leap over all this is something that god is going to empower us to do something that god has uh asked you know that we must do as christians there's times when we've got to run through a troop there's times we've got to leap over a wall and if all of a sudden like well now everything's changed brother and at one point we're respecting all walls and now there's walls we gotta jump over yeah that's the challenge right when is someone's attitude towards me when is there a change in our relationship because there's a barrier that needs to be addressed or there's a boundary that's been violated is this something i need to step back and apologize for and and respect and moderate conduct or is there something that i'm looking at the devil's just trying to get in a way and i've still got to have the right attitude towards it there's still a way that i got to approach this to where i don't do something unreasonable or hurt somebody but we've got that's the challenges recognizing things that the devil is trying to bring division the devil's trying to destroy something because paul said the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through god to the pulling down of strongholds i was studying this scripture last week and and the way that paul is even describing and the other scriptures around it just seem to kind of paint this picture our tools are ready to clear the ground of any obstacle our tools are ready to remove every obstruction in order that we might grow into maturity amen to you i say this for you your tools what god has given you he's given to you that you might use in your own lives in order to remove every obstruction that's keeping you from growing into maturity if it's every thought we can bring captive if it's mighty to god to pulling down of strongholds that means that within your posse within your spirit there's been some bulwark some place that the devil has resided and he's there and he's like you got to respect my boundaries i got to respect my bounds he's like no i do not you're exactly the thing that god has told me i can root out of my life i can tear down and i can reject and get out because he's given me the tools to do it this is the challenge we build walls according to the word of god and we're to tear down every barrier that satan puts in our way we're staying the path maybe there's two different images of possessing ground and building up and building the walls of jerusalem but as we are on this highway to heaven we want to stay on that road not venture into ditches not allow things that would get in the way to obstruct us keep going forward in ephesians 2 14 for he is our peace with peace who hath made both one and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us this is in the nature of god to tear down things that separate that divide that are contrary to the word of god so i say the word of god builds strong boundaries and it tears down every barrier contrary to his will that's what the word of god does and i and it's easier said than done right so we need a grace to do both we need a grace to set the boundary to set it in the right spirit not not harsh not rude but this is the right spirit to set the boundaries and i know there may be the instinct just to think about personal relationships and maybe i'll even admit to this that my my ministering on this has been informed by my experiences there might be things that i'm hypersensitive about even as i minister and you may not even be thinking about it at all and i would say that's wonderful i want it to mean to you what god wants it to mean to you so if you see this in terms of a schedule or places you go or something you would do for work or people you hang out with or if it has application within relationships we need god need god's grace to defying boundaries to build walls and we need his grace to address barriers because it's a challenge to recognize sometimes the difference so let's go forward let's go forward god last week in a very very deep way impressed upon me i just re-emphasized one thing and just clearly impressed upon me another that gave everything just settled my spirit and gave me this deep peace and i was impressed very deeply that this series was meant to do two things and i might have initially thought that it was in this first one that we would look into the word of god and point out how that god god has patterns of boundaries and satan has a pattern of barriers and that in looking at that and whether it be setting limits and love has limits and and the pride paradox and god is boundless and the gods boundaries and different ways that we looked at it that we were just equipping us to face relationships or decision-making or standard making from the sense that god is a god of boundaries and if you just disrespect god's boundaries there's a consequence and so that's a principle that it's important to teach we that we need to learn ourselves that we teach our children this is what raising children in the path that they should go it's not in the way that you want them to be something so you're going to force them to be something but you teach them the right way to live to respect the word of god to respect other people and that's something that when they're older you say well i raised my son to be a lawyer and he's not a lawyer so i raised him in the path that he should go and he he's not he's departed from it wrong idea it's not what you think he should be it's what god wants him to be and you realize is the way that he has to live in order to become what god wants them to be so it's this principle of teaching us how to treat one another and how to make decisions and how to set standards and so that was kind of originally my whole thought is that if we could recognize these principles it was just something to look at to recognize god is the god of order god the god of the god of boundaries satan tries to use barriers to disrupt and make chaos in god's parameters but the second point which became more clear to me last week and a very pronounced way and i knew it was just the lord so not only was he wanting to equip us and point out a principle in the word of god that we could use in our daily lives but it was to give context to what has been and this may not be so for all of us but i believe it is for some of us that this subject has been enlightening in a retrospective way that if we were never able to actually articulate things we knew that there was an offense so we knew something was wrong we knew something didn't work out and there's many things in our past that we don't fully understand but using this principle we can look back and like well that could be that could be clearly defined as a boundary issue that's because i didn't set boundaries or that's because i went beyond this boundary and you start looking back and we recognize that many offenses and hurts and harms were bound related to where we did something we crossed a line or somebody else crossed a line and we start looking at all these different things and so we're looking back and it gives context to what has been and and looking back at what has been we take personal responsibility where we did not set limits we purpose to do so now we take personal responsibility where we transgress to other people's limits and we purpose in our hearts to do so to no longer do so and so in one sense it was to teach a principle in the word of god but in another sense it was to give perspective and to give context to things that have happened before so there's a part of us that maybe starts looking back and we start looking at things but what i want to say now is let's go forward let's not all of a sudden become spectators of our past and you remember this and you remember that you remember this you remember that we start trying to fix everything and define everything and try to create some sort of label or some sort of paradigm of what has been we don't want to be backward looking we want to go forward and i want to say this in going forward we did not share these things of barriers and boundaries to create a new paradigm or a worldview i know there's authors who have written on boundaries i know that there's a book that even i mentioned on when the body says no and one thing that i found sometimes with authors and these uh these views of certain things whether it be the body and sickness or whether it be uh social issues or whether it be personal relationships a particular writer or doctor or scholar will have a view a paradigm so that they just have a particular language to describe everything and so now instead of looking at things through the word of god and art we view the world through the word i did not introduce these principles so that we have a new worldview well everything's a barrier or a boundary no everything is what it is described in the word of god we don't look at things like oh oh your body is saying no then you probably have we're not freudian all of a sudden because there's there's certain principles that some of you have if you've read the book you'll find that some of these doctors say well if you have a problem in your pancreas it's probably because you're abused by your dad when you're eight years old in two days it's the only time it happens if it happens on that day you're gonna have pancreatitis for the rest of your life and it it's just because they view everything right eat right for your type can i get a witness anybody read the book right everything is oh you must be o positive and everything's viewed through that paradigm birth order some people they view everything as birth order you're first born aren't you no actually i'm the third born you have two older sisters don't you um no actually i've got two older brothers they were born in june weren't they and it's like there's a million ways to figure out why the third child is actually first in the birth order right because everything has to fit that paradigm this is not a new paradigm for us as believers we already got one it's the word of god the message of the hour the word of god the bible that's the way that we viewed the world this was not shared so that we have this new paradigm it's just terminology and principles to emphasize a truth that's in god's word and so i say that that we cannot we the these things have been spoken to equip us spoken to give context to what has been so let's go forward because we can't get caught looking back on what has been but we can't start trying to view everything going forward through something that's limited we've got to use the word of god the bible says in luke chapter 9 verse 62 and jesus said unto him no man having put his hand to the plow and looking back is fit for the kingdom of god when when it says a man putting his hand to the plow it doesn't mean he's borrowed somebody else's plow it means this is what he is this is what he does he's a farmer he has a job to do no man putting his hand to the plow to fulfill his job to fulfill his task to fulfill his duty looks back you don't turn around in this image you look at the ground that is before you if you've deviated from the past the path and the past only looking back on it's going to cause you to deviate in the future you look on the ground that is before you if a man who has a job to do is constantly looking back says he's not fit for the kingdom of god we can use this to say that all of us are citizens of the kingdom of god we have a job to do we're putting our hands to the plow as it were to do god's will and to perform his service and to and to lift up his kingdom if we're not looking forward we are not fit to declare his kingdom if we're not looking forward we're not reflecting or manifesting the attributes of his kingdom it says you're not fit for the kingdom it doesn't mean you're not worthy you can never have it you're going to be cast out it means you're not doing truly the lord's work you've got to have a face that is set you have to be looking forward you have to have your eyes on the goal and then with that in mind not always looking back on what has been but haven't kind of paused yes this has been horrible yes this has been harmful yes this has happened but i'm looking forward to the promise then you can properly convey the joy the happiness the forgiveness the reconciliation the healing the liberty that is in the word of god brother branham says and god is his own interpreter i know this is used quite often a very precise way he says living in a glare he said a glare is an image it's a mirage the sun reflecting itself and it's false and any glare of another age is a false reflection right he says this the people always are walking in something that happened years ago and we just we'd like to be oh those pentecostals yeah get him brother brandon rub that pentecostal kitty the wrong way you know what you're still whining and complaining about what happened to you five years ago i don't know being harsh i'm talking to a moses right now elijah will get under the juniper entry and talk a little bit but it's like some of us are living we're living walking is something that happened years ago that's our worldview it's our paradigm well this happened to me this happened to me this happened to me and he realized afterward well you're just a sum of everything that's happened to you so you're you you and brother branham is using this in a direct way but i believe the principle can even be used in this broad context people are always walking in something that happened years ago let's not do it in the sense that we're always recalling a former glory and all this was wonderful this was great but that's also not living the nastiness of our past the mistakes of our past the harms of our past at some point there has to be a confidence i am forgiven and i go forward there has to be a confidence that though i bear that with me let us go on into perfection though i might always be connected with my youth and i may always be connected with my past i still grow up into maturity and i still leave certain things behind and and and though i may never be severed by all the things that have made me who i am today and nature and nurture god has a way of placing those appropriate in my life that i can say all things have worked together for the good and and no way at all this is my this is my climax my summary and no way at all were these things shared to make us hesitant to make us reluctant we're we're always questioned i'm afraid to act because i don't want to offend somebody i'm afraid to move and do this but these things were shared to empower us to give us boldness to give us authority to go forward in god's path for us because all too often it's this uh this failure to really embrace the word of god it's this failure to have confidence in what god called you to do i looked back in my life and i realized that there was always this real subtle uh stab of the devil that and he would use people to do it to always try to cause me to question what my calling was that god had spoken to me in a very particular way in a very specific way and he had given me if i could say he had given me something to identify and it would be at this moment and had to do with pastoring this is this is this will be so when you begin to pastor and i didn't ever i knew it was the lord and i thought well there's just a number of ways that could happen so god interprets his word by bringing it to pass and there's always these kind of subtle digs through the ears that were trying to get me to waver on what my calling was well what do you think your gift is you know and always this and in my heart i knew well whatever whatever season i'm in however it's being used and whether i'm traveling and i'm going around the world or i'm doing this and doing that well you must be a teacher you must be a missionary you must be an evangelist you're this you're that in my heart i knew god had called me to be a pastor and i recognized there was always some kind of intimidation to try to make me reluctant about that and the moment the very moment when i when god it crystallized my wife is a witness to this that the very moment i knew that god had turned my heart and i was going to be that it was like god is calling me to phoenix to start a church and i'm going to be a pastor it'd been exactly a week since that threshold had been crossed that god had told me about before and it's not until it happens like oh my goodness look at all of this and i recognize years of where the devil is trying to bully and intimidate me from my calling and that's my testimony it's anecdotal but i hope to god that there's something you could recognize in your life there's always these things that just kind of try to push us of course and push us from doing the things that we know god has called us to do and try to intimidate us and so i share this to say that you have a call and you have borders you're to possess you have an inheritance let us be confident in what god has made us and let us be confident in what he's told us to do we can't be intimidated by man-made barriers masquerading as boundaries oh you can't do this you can't do that man-made barriers i studied the message and found that all the places that brother branham talked about denominational barriers being torn down he never tore down a word barrier it was always a man-made barrier i think i read every instance where brother bam talked about it because i wanted to be sure that i was being faithful to the message i want to be sure that what i had to share with there's this fidelity and harmony with what brother braun taught and i found everywhere brother man was talking about tearing down a boundary a fence a barrier a circle or whatever it was it was man that had put that there not god we're to respect others but that deference to others can never contradict god's will for us that means we can never fulfill god's word by being disrespectful but what god wants you to do may be different than what somebody else wants you to do where is it sometimes we find the greatest conflict in relationships is when you feel like you can't say no you got to do it to appease somebody and you got to do this and you got to do that because this is what happens and it's this real nasty dynamic and you realize that you're acting against conscience you're doing things you don't want to do all because of this person's sensitivities it's a real bad habit to get into because one day god says you've got to do this and then you're afraid to do it because you don't want to hurt somebody's feelings right i want to use an example in the spring of 1962 brother brown had a vision of shooting a large brown bear you familiar with this story and brother brown that during that time it was i believe it's april 1st is when he says he recently had a vision so may have been in march um that it happened but it was just sometime in the early spring 1962 and that time march april maybe even a little bit earlier be that's when he begins to tell this vision and he testifies that it's thus saith the lord and he gives these descriptions about it and the way that he described it and other stories he's starting to tell in the midst of this and i had i had the privilege years ago this was after i just began to serve the lord i think even before i was preaching years ago to hear it was through a personal in a personal way not over a pulpit or anything and preaching brother biscuit share with me some details to this and brother blaine is a witness witness brother billy paul brother bud southwick brother branham they were all hunting they went hunting again in canada that fall and these brothers can testify those that would be still living and and could share this and brother biscuit has done so publicly since and these are this is testimony of how that brother branham had this vision of a brown bear and brother biscuit and brother blaine and brother billy paul went out hunting and they witnessed that bear described it exactly and perfectly that bear that brother brown said he was going to shoot and i know this might seem to be a little bit this could for some it might sound teetering a little on an area that makes some people uncomfortable but you remember when brother branham told the story about being in south africa and god had told him to do one thing and he didn't do it god told him to do one thing and he didn't do it has any has god ever wanted you to do something and you didn't do it is there anybody here that's got a perfect record tell us the secret brother branham in south africa and there was a price that he paid was a tremendous consequence it's very instructive to us as believers to recognize that now this was a similar situation where he they see that they see this brown bear and they come back and i think the testament was oh brother brandon we saw this bear was exactly the one in the vision and things completely changed on the trip the rain came in it rained for days and brother branham comes back later after this hunting trip and he testifies in the message countdown he says this he says i find out if god has spoken anything that we must go with that word in order to make it be fulfilled now that's you hear that god speaks something if it's going to be fulfilled we have to go with it we've seen that as i told you last night a vision just recently i had to be there and wanting to be there in telling me six months before to be on that spot this fits perfectly with when he had the vision fits perfectly with the timeline than him going hunting in canada to be on that spot and stand there and say go down there three times with them and i walked on with the other men and the vision passed right through exactly god's part recognizing this god's part and i was left standing now i'm not this is this is just i want you just to use this as an example for our own lives so if there's more here that you need to drill down on what the points being made in brother branham's sermon and his life then god can certainly speak to you in this way but here's brother brown saying i had a vision i was warned i was told to do it i should have gone with them brother billy paul brother blaine but the biscuit i should have gone with them and i didn't i went with the other men god did his part exactly i was left standing so here's the instruction so we want to remember you've got to stay on the word just stay right with the word and where the word leads you go right with the word and it'll bring you out all right i'm sure what a lesson for us a prophet in his humility can admit to these things and tell us listen i've learned that if god has spoken anything we've got to go with the word in order for it to be fulfilled if god has spoken something for you don't be so presumptuous to think that he'll fulfill it if you don't go with what he says it doesn't matter how much thus say the oil god told me this is going to happen god told me this guy god told me this is going to happen if you don't stay with his word god can't do it for you this is a lesson to us very humbling lesson very striking lesson the humility of a prophet god did his part exactly the vision passed right through exactly god did his part there was this enormous brown bear but i was left standing and you think oh maybe that's the end of it that night he says and in his presence and father as i confess mine about misbehaving before them people earlier in this sermon i believe it's where he says there i was up on the mountain it was all snowy and he said god forgive uh i i think the word he uses um a stupid maybe i wish i would have brought the quote i cut it out maybe i do have it no he he uses a very harsh word for himself there that day on that mountain the storm blowing in he walked away and he asked for forgiveness and repented and then he says and father as i confess mine my sins my mistakes about misbehaving before them people i didn't carry on myself like a servant of christ i didn't you want to know why i was afraid that man might be angry with me and think i didn't want to hurt and think i didn't want to hurt his feelings but i didn't think of what i was doing to you lord do you recognize what happened he was told and warned to do something and the reason why he didn't is he had a friend that he was afraid he would hurt his feelings he's afraid he would disappoint him in his age and and maybe he's not able to go on that kind of a hunt to be that aggressive and to pursue something and maybe run up the mountain or whatever it is i'm just just trying to imagine what it might have been and he feels like oh i should go hunting with these young men and brother budd is going to be on his own or maybe he can do something else and instead of brother branham doing what he knew he should have done he had his feelings were being hurt for this older brother and he says i was afraid he'd get angry afraid of the response and as i afraid i'd hurt his feelings but i never thought about what i was going to be doing to you now think for a moment why why is this so important september 1962 he's going to have another vision he has another vision where he's got to meet constellation of angels and he can't miss this one because if he misses that one none of us are here right god's teaching this prophet you've got to do your part well you've got this schedule you've got that schedule is this happening and that happened all these other barriers and barriers but you got to be there in arizona at that moment you got to be there at that time i didn't want to hurt his feelings but i think i didn't think of what i was doing to you lord and now i pray that you forgive me and now father i know that i ask forgiveness i have forgiveness and you put them in the sea of forgetfulness and you'll never remember that no more god i'm thankful for that there was a situation in the circumstance where prophet had to do something and go forward and there's still some to this day that are waiting for that brown bear to get shot and killed but brother branham tells us right here in the message of the hour it was there but i wasn't what do we learn from that there's a lot we can learn from that but for us if a prophet under a vision could feel the pressure to not do what god wants him to do in the face of opposition making somebody angry hurting somebody's feelings we ought to be able to appreciate the fact that this can be very hard on us in our lives but we must go forward we must do the things that we know that god has asked us to do and in acts chapter 28 i want to use this in closing and i have a quote to refer to in this that brother branham refers to this in a message jairus jeru different ways you could pronounce it gyrus and divine healing but it says this is the story i'll just skip to verse verse three and there's so there's barbarious people barbarians there that are present as paul says and when paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and laid them on the fire there came a viper out of the heat and fastened on his hand anybody ever bit bit by a snake anybody raise your hand if you've been bit by snake why am i the only one does that disqualify me for anything he said have i not admitted that i got bit by a snake once it was this hand and it wasn't venomous but i know what it means to be snake bit because it was just a black snake it was just a chicken snake and i could feel the venom making its way to my heart and my dad said you shall take up deadly serpents and they shall not harm you and i said dad if it was going by faith right now i'd die because i'd been bit by a snake but this venomous snake attaches itself to his hand and fastens to his hand and the barbarians saw the venomous beast hang on his hand and they said among themselves no doubt this man is a murderer whom they though he escaped the sea vengeance he's getting his karma he's going to die a murderous man and suffered not to live and the gods have balanced the ledger though he survived the shipwreck you're going to get what's coming to you and they're all looking i'm like yep he's a murderer and it says in verse 5 and he shook off the beast into the fire and felt no harm and now they're looking kind of looking because he would have swollen and fallen dead suddenly so they're kind of like looking but after they had looked a great while and saw no harm come to him they changed their minds and said that he was a god i if you could make application to your life there's things that happen to us and when they happen some people may think we're just getting what's coming to us and then they just they expect that it'll ruin us they expect that it'll stop us satan even expects that it might weaken our faith our resolve there's this expectation all you got to do is invite them this venomous snake all you do is throw something in the way some harm some injury come and just wait give it time this will be their end but as paul was able to shake it off in the fire and as they all watched and he didn't swell up and he didn't die then they changed their minds it was in the fact that paul continued it was the fact that paul might have just went about his business uh gathering sticks and tending to the fire and it says that paul shook off the beast under the fire and felt no harm now we have that kind of saying in our own lives when you shake something off we say shake it off or just shake off something walk off something it means to deal with something or recover from an injury or to recover from a negative feeling just shake it off just walk it off to successfully recover to successfully deal with something either whether it be a physical injury or even a negative feeling and so i impressed this to you i felt so supremely led if i just read one scripture and told one story it would be this that whatever has happened to you whatever has bitten you whatever has uh uh have occurred then whatever has taken place i say shake it off and go forward though it may be a fearful sight and thought may seem to be painful no matter what it's a venomous snake people that has happened this too they've died i say right now just as paul knew that he was going to rome you know that you've got a purpose you know you have a job you know you have to call it whatever has happened to you in the past i say shake it off and go forward and let this be something this guiding principle as we go forward as believers whatever comes up if you get bit by a snake something happens some offense comes some harm comes something takes place i just say it successfully deal with it and recover and go forward and whatever the enemy wants to say about the snake bite he'll have to change his mind when you don't succumb to its venom they'll have to well i thought for sure this message would crumble with the website i thought for sure all i had to do was bring that up and the thing would fall to its knees i thought for sure just to cause them to be debilitated physically i thought for sure throw this in their way throw that in their way but they just keep shaking it off over and over and over why we've got a revelation we've got a vision we've got thus saith the lord and we can't miss it i'm not suggesting you won't feel it i've been bitten by a snake i'm the only one here can testify i've been bit by a snake you'll feel it you want to hear the whole story i won't save it for the evening service i'll tell you now my dad was preaching in the back woods of missouri but jared is that brother brown's it's probably where we met met and hung out back in the 80s and we're on our way home and my brother david loves to collect all sorts of critters matter of fact first time you ever met my wife he says you want to see my pet lizard she's very naive she said yeah he went to the freezer and pulled out a dead bearded dragon that had been there for years and introduced her to the corpse of a dead bearded dragon so that's david that's kind of the way that he is and so we're driving home we're picking up all sorts of turtles and everything else for david when we get home and there's this gigantic five foot long black snake in the middle of the road my dad says we should we should uh we should catch it all right dad you go for it and we're in the process of trying to catch it it goes into the grass and i try to reach for it it bites me and i panic and go to the car and finally my dad steps on its head and i grab it i grab it and we put it in a box and well we grab it and we're walking across the street holding a five foot long snake and another family probably just got out of the upc church down the road and we're walking by with a snake they're probably like bless god real believers real believe they must be they're gonna have an evening service tonight right let's follow them to church and they see us walk in with this snake and we put it in this box and we're driving and i've got teeth marks just all in my hand and my heart's pounding and i'm dying and and any moment my heart is going to seize up and my dad uses this uh scripture to try to encourage me it's not working and i'm holding this box i'm like dad we got to get somewhere to tape this thing up there's a convenience store up ahead and right about that moment the snake pops its head up out of the box and i'm face to face with the beast the devil himself who beguiled eve and now it's the it's the my mount zion showdown and i shriek and just push the box away from me and out comes the snake towards my dad so now my dad's driving his pickup truck and he wants to get away from the snake so he steers away from it i don't know if he finished high school he stares this way and it just causes the snake to pile up almost in his lap so he wants to get it away from him he learned steered the other way so now it's coming towards me and he's trying to do this dirt hurt and finally and this pentecostal family's still behind us so you can just imagine they know age pulls off the side room we both just bolt out each door i'm like dad let the snake go and we let the snake go and i lived i wasn't resurrected from the dead no hands were laid on me the pentecostals didn't pull over and said you guys are a bunch of make believers let us lay hands on you they just drove on and didn't follow us to the evening service but that's like that's my snake bit story and haven't been snake but i'd say i'm not saying you won't feel it i'm not suggesting it at all i'm not suggesting that what has happened to you before is trivial i'm not suggesting that there should have been any pain i'm not suggesting that going forward there's not going to be any pain but it shall not hinder it said that he shook it off in the fire and felt no harm that means whatever it could have done it didn't do he felt no harm and i know sometimes in our lives we're told it's time to move on but that whole phrase too can be very disrespectful and have a lot of meaning that it doesn't mean so let me say this it's not time to move on let's go forward and we may carry with us the sufferings of our past i have even dear dear dear friend who suffered a tremendous loss and it's interrupted his whole life and some some people may tell him you just need to move on you just need to move on but you know what this brother can't he can't move on but what he needs to do is go forward carry the loss carry the grief carry whatever it is god will use it but don't let it don't let it stop you we got a job to do let's go forward and brother graham said why it never scared paul he looked at it like that so full of the holy ghost his whole inner body just charged with the power of god this wasn't my response he looked at it and shook it off in the fire and said i've got to go before caesar what are you bothering me about like that and went on walking it didn't bother him didn't scare him a bit why he knew god had called him to do something oh god give me the courage that when i know you want me to do something i can face the opposition and say i i don't know what it'll mean to you but i've got to do what god wants me to do it didn't matter to him and i close on this we'll invite the musicians to come we'll close on this just prior to this uh actually just before brother makes this statement brother ram comes to this very story of paul shaking off this serpent in the fire this is this is his this is what he's tracking are you still with me it's 1209 if you've been disciplined not to look to this point god bless you i know it's running long but i'm finishing a 13-part series i mean you need time you need time to do this but listen and paragraph 35 he says we ought to get ourselves in that kind of atmosphere create each one of you as a creator did you know that each one of you people that's born again is a creator we must create an atmosphere as i said the other night and then he tells the story the next paragraph it's long when this is just um the digital version he said the evils and he said he tells the story of how chaos is in the home and his wife is all upset and he just changes the atmosphere helps wash dishes and different things and the children start playing with blocks and he says it's the atmosphere you got you got the get to get away from it from that old confusion there's this old confusion this old malaise this old way of thinking you got to get away from something you even got to get away from this bad atmosphere that's been created you got to get away from it from that old confusion and now i love this oh am i going to be he says you're scared that's what's the matter and he says you'll this is a principle this is and and you say well why you keep pushing it because there's something here i've got to get to this i got to get to this you'll be frying your meat of a morning for breakfast and first thing you know you're filled with the holy spirit says now i'm going to shock you a little bit and i think i've already used way too much of my own testimony to even have the right to say this so i'll i'll have to take a few months off with testifying i heard this as a young boy and i put it into practice and it's never failed me i heard it just took i was like i believe it i believe it i'm gonna use it he says he's i'm gonna shock you if you don't you don't mind do you all right for instance a meats of frying and all at once the grease pops out on your hand now if you'll just shake it off and go on frying meat it wouldn't bother you now you didn't get that just right look first thing oh wear the uncontent that's a even today i think it's still sell it it's just like where's the melaleuca right where's the aloe vera where where's where's the ointment where's the burn uh where's the what do we use to apply to birds honey get the melaleuca the melo gel i need tea tree oil i'm dying over here he said but if you'll just shake it off it wouldn't bother you you see you grab your hand it scares you to death that's what does it it's fear peter walking on the water he was walking all right till he seen the waves contrary and he got scared jesus said why'd you fear notice the principle the very simple principle you get burned and he says when your mind first goes to the harm the damage the pain what it could mean he says it's immediately then that your body's even going to give in and it's going to blister i i know i'm amplifying it but i said just shake it off shake it off and just keep doing what you're doing he said it wouldn't bother you what is it that happens to us sometimes things just happen and we make it such a big deal instead of just shaking it off and going forward he says why'd you fear that's the matter with holy ghost people today you got a lot afraid listen the devil's just trying to scare you out of something i say this to you this morning you've made it here you're here you've stuck with this service it's 12 12 12 13. here you are you've been listening you've been listening and you say well that i want you to get this if there's anything you get from this the devil's trying to scare you out of something he's trying to put something off somewhere else do you not realize that the devil wakes up every morning and he checks his to-do list he says hey google what's my job today scare a believer out of something [Music] say some of these days you'll be this you are now now we're sons of god now we're seated together in heavenly places now we all have powers in heavens and earth now we have it not in the millennium we won't need it there we got it now right now we're sons of god it does not appear what we shall be but we shall be like him what you are here is a reflection of what you are somewhere else hallelujah what i am here sometimes reflects what has been my past but what i want to be now is a reflection of what i am somewhere else there is no past me that's living there is no past me that's breathing there is no me that exists somewhere else in the past but there is a me beyond this veil there is a me that exists in the mind of god and what i want to be here is a reflection of what i am there i say let us go forward and whether it be a grease fire or something else just shake it off and go forward let's go forward please stand
