[0:00] Proverbs chapter 31:E1 16.
[0:05] We know this is speaking about a
[0:07] virtuous woman. Here in my Bible, the
[0:09] heading is a virtuous woman cares for
[0:11] her family. And it says in verse 16, she
[0:13] considerth a field and buyth it. With
[0:16] the fruit of her hand she planteth a
[0:19] vineyard. Just a short reading. Let's
[0:21] just read it again. She considerth a
[0:22] field and buyth it. With the fruit of
[0:25] her hand, she planteth a vineyard. Amen.
[0:28] Let's just go to the Lord in prayer. Our
[0:30] heavenly father, as we have this
[0:32] opportunity today to be in service, we
[0:34] consider it to be a great privilege. We
[0:37] ask Lord that as you've been with us in
[0:41] the song service and you've been with us
[0:43] in our hearts, as we've lifted up our
[0:45] hands and lifted up our voice, we ask
[0:47] that you come now through the word and
[0:48] speak to our hearts and give us those
[0:50] things that we have need of that it
[0:52] might uh enrich us, Lord, that it might
[0:54] just strengthen us and encourage us. We
[0:56] commit ourselves to you now, Lord. bless
[0:58] this word which we have read from your
[0:59] Bible and make it alive to us by
[1:02] revelation as we commit all things to
[1:03] you in Jesus name. Amen.
[1:07] &gt;&gt; You could be seated.
[1:10] My title is uh taken from verse 16 here
[1:14] as it says she considers a field and
[1:16] buyth it and then plants a vineyard. My
[1:19] title is plan possess plant. So use of
[1:23] alliteration there is my son Preston
[1:25] might say repetitive there to use those
[1:28] P's but to plan possess and plant and
[1:31] taking it directly from this scripture.
[1:33] If you could turn to Exodus chapter 31.
[1:36] I want to jump into this subject today
[1:38] by looking at an example in scripture in
[1:40] Exodus chapter 31:es
[1:43] 1-1.
[1:46] And it's speaking of Bezale and it says,
[1:50] "And the Lord spake unto Moses saying,
[1:51] see, I have called by name Bezale, the
[1:54] son of Yuri, the son of the tribe of
[1:56] Judah." So God knows him, calls him by
[1:59] name, and says this about him. And I
[2:01] have filled him with the spirit of God
[2:04] in wisdom and in understanding and in
[2:07] knowledge and in all manner of
[2:10] workmanship. And so we're going to be
[2:13] reading about the chief artisan in the
[2:15] building of the tabernacle and even the
[2:17] building of the ark of the covenant.
[2:19] We'll look in some of these verses,
[2:20] these next several verses, and see that
[2:22] he was a highly gifted craftsman. And
[2:24] not only has the Lord uh filled him with
[2:26] wisdom and understanding and knowledge,
[2:28] but he has this gift in all manner of
[2:31] workmanship. So he was an artist. He's
[2:33] very creative. He was highly gifted. And
[2:36] as we'll read, you can see that he could
[2:37] engrave precious metals and even work
[2:39] with stones and wood. And so he was a
[2:42] master artist. And it says that to
[2:44] devise cunning works, to work in gold
[2:47] and in silver and in brass, and in
[2:50] cutting of stones, and to set them, and
[2:52] in carving of timber, to work in all
[2:54] manner of workmanship. And I, behold, I
[2:57] have given with him Aholab, the son of
[3:00] Amish, of the tribe of Dan. And in the
[3:03] hearts of all that are wisehearted, I
[3:06] have put wisdom, that they may make all
[3:08] that I have commanded thee. God had
[3:10] given Moses a commandment, given him a
[3:12] vision in heaven, and he had a an image
[3:14] in heaven of what the tabernacle should
[3:16] look like. And he's going to be building
[3:18] this tabernacle on earth. And Moses has
[3:21] the word. He has the blueprint. He has
[3:23] the plans. But God has now called by
[3:25] name others who are gifted to be able to
[3:29] bring that vision to pass to work in all
[3:31] manner of workmanship, and that they may
[3:34] make all that I commanded thee. So,
[3:36] there was kind of like the boots on the
[3:37] ground. They were going to be the ones
[3:38] actually making it. The tabernacle of
[3:41] the congregation and the ark of the
[3:42] testimony and the mercy seat that is
[3:44] there upon in all the furniture of the
[3:47] tabernacle. Moses knew what it was to
[3:49] look like. Bezile and those helping him
[3:52] were going to bring uh this vision to
[3:55] pass. and the table and his furniture,
[3:58] and the pure candlestick with all his
[3:59] furniture, and the altar of incense, and
[4:02] the altar of burnt offering with all his
[4:04] furniture, and the labor and his foot,
[4:06] and the clothes of service, and the holy
[4:08] garments for Aaron the priest, and the
[4:10] garments of his sons to minister in the
[4:12] priest's office, and the anointing oil,
[4:14] and sweet incense for the holy place.
[4:16] And all of you who subscribe to do
[4:18] terara young living you find your place
[4:20] in the scripture that bezel and holab
[4:23] they were gifted with these essential
[4:25] oils.
[4:27] It says in the sweet incense for the
[4:28] holy place according to all that I have
[4:30] commanded thee shall they do. So notice
[4:34] how not only was Bezel gifted, but he
[4:36] also had these um artists or these
[4:38] apprentices working under him and that
[4:41] he instructed them also in these things
[4:43] so that they could bring to pass the
[4:45] prophet's message or his vision. It
[4:48] reads this way in Exodus 35 30-35 very
[4:52] similar. And Moses said unto the
[4:54] children of Israel, now that God has
[4:56] spoke to Moses, Moses speaks openly and
[4:59] he affirms these gifts. And he's not
[5:00] afraid uh to say that God has gifted
[5:03] other men and and done these things to
[5:05] bring this word to pass. He says, "See
[5:07] the Lord hath called by name Bezale, the
[5:10] son of Yuri, the son of the tribe of
[5:12] Judah. And he hath filled him with the
[5:14] spirit of God in wisdom, in
[5:15] understanding, and in knowledge, and all
[5:17] manner of workmanship." So he's being
[5:18] very faithful uh to what God has said
[5:20] and to devise curious works to work in
[5:23] gold and in silver and in brass and the
[5:25] cutting of stones to set them in carving
[5:28] of wood to make any manner of cunning
[5:30] work. And he hath put in his heart that
[5:32] he may teach. So notice when he had
[5:34] filled him with the spirit of God and
[5:36] wisdom, understanding and knowledge uh
[5:38] that was so that he could teach this uh
[5:41] according to this talent that he had to
[5:44] work in all manner of workmanship as an
[5:46] artisan with wood and stone and precious
[5:48] metals. Now he's put in his heart to
[5:51] teach both he and Holab the son of
[5:53] Asamak of the tribe of Dan. them hath he
[5:55] filled with wisdom of heart to work all
[5:58] manner of work. of the engraver and the
[6:00] cunning workman and the embroiderer in
[6:02] blue and in purple and scarlet and fine
[6:04] linen of the weaver even of them that do
[6:07] any work and of those that devise
[6:09] cunning work as we've been speaking on
[6:13] God giving us talents or giving us gifts
[6:16] and these gifts laying in us from God a
[6:18] God a God-given ability
[6:21] was gifted and called by God to employ
[6:23] his talents in this incredible work of
[6:26] building the tabernacle and not just
[6:29] building the substructure or laying the
[6:31] foundation. But you could see it covered
[6:32] everything from the furniture to the ark
[6:34] of the testimony to the garments to the
[6:37] oils. He was going to do all these
[6:39] things and kind of be like this chief
[6:41] artisan, this uh chief overseer of the
[6:44] building of the tabernacle. Holab also
[6:46] was gifted and called. And so God puts
[6:49] it in the heart of Bezale to teach and
[6:53] to help Aholab and all these other
[6:56] embroiderers and these other ones that
[6:57] the scriptures speak of to cultivate and
[7:00] to use their talents. And instead of
[7:03] spending a lot of time on bezel and
[7:06] holab and this work that they undertook
[7:08] in Exodus and some of these other places
[7:10] to build these things, I want to use
[7:12] this at the outset. They are examples to
[7:15] us of our duty to the God-given talents,
[7:19] abilities, and opportunities that he has
[7:22] given us.
[7:23] &gt;&gt; That God has ordained us. He puts the
[7:26] spirit of God in us, and it gives us
[7:29] wisdom and understanding and knowledge.
[7:31] And we might say, "Well, I'm not good at
[7:33] working with precious stones, and I'm
[7:34] not good working with that." But
[7:36] whatever gift he's given you, he's
[7:37] placed it in your heart. And he has
[7:40] given you uh he wants you to employ that
[7:43] talent with skill.
[7:45] &gt;&gt; He wants you to use these God-given
[7:47] opportunities and gifts that he's given
[7:49] us. In 1 Corinthians 4:es 1 and 2, it
[7:52] says, "Let a man so account of us as the
[7:55] ministers of Christ." As Paul said that
[7:57] what are we but ministers? uh he and
[7:59] Apollos that God has sent to minister to
[8:03] the church and that one would plant and
[8:06] one would water but it's God that works
[8:07] in all to bring forth fruit. So he says
[8:10] as ministers of Christ we are stewards
[8:13] of the mysteries of God. I apologize
[8:17] today if we don't have some more details
[8:19] on our slides as we typically do. Uh
[8:22] I'll just say ran out of time.
[8:26] And so the stewards of the mysteries of
[8:28] God and being stewards that means the
[8:30] mysteries have been committed to him.
[8:32] It's not Paul's mysteries but committed
[8:34] to him for safekeeping to watch out over
[8:36] to use appropriately. So it says
[8:38] moreover it is required in stewards that
[8:40] a man be found faithful. So we could use
[8:44] this as an example that we are to be
[8:45] faithful to the things God gives us.
[8:48] When God's given you a revelation, you
[8:50] need to be faithful to them.
[8:52] &gt;&gt; You need to be faithful to the things
[8:53] that he shows you. If he's given you a
[8:55] gift or a talent or ability or an
[8:57] opportunity, be faithful to that
[8:59] opportunity. Don't squander it. Don't
[9:01] belittle it. Don't look past. Don't look
[9:03] over it or look beneath it. But be
[9:05] faithful to the things that God commits
[9:07] to you. We are stewards. You are a
[9:10] steward of the mysteries of God as
[9:11] they're revealed to you. You're a
[9:12] steward of that salvation that God has
[9:14] given you. You're a steward over the You
[9:16] might might not want to think of it this
[9:18] way or don't think of it this way, but
[9:19] you're a steward over that gift of the
[9:21] Holy Ghost that's placed in your heart.
[9:24] In Ecclesiastes 3:1, we've been focusing
[9:27] quite a bit on this verse in the last
[9:28] couple services. He hath made everything
[9:31] beautiful in his time. We could say of
[9:33] the tabernacle in the ark of the
[9:34] testimony that it was made beautiful in
[9:36] its time. And God had called Bezale to
[9:39] bring to pass the vision that Moses had
[9:41] from God. And it took time to do that.
[9:44] But that is the work of the Lord. As he
[9:46] works on us as clay, as he worked in the
[9:48] earth to bring forth creation, he makes
[9:50] everything beautiful in his time. And
[9:53] then this statement also he hath set the
[9:55] world in their heart. We looked at how
[9:58] some translations rendered this. He has
[9:59] planted eternity in your heart. God has
[10:03] planted an eternal treasure deep inside
[10:05] of you. You are a steward over that
[10:08] treasure.
[10:09] &gt;&gt; You are a steward over these gifts that
[10:12] God gives you. Some are more gifted than
[10:14] others and some have might seem to be
[10:17] more visible callings, but your gift is
[10:20] just as important as anybody else's. and
[10:22] nobody else can take your place in the
[10:24] body of Christ. And so you you have a
[10:26] stewardship over what God has placed
[10:28] inside of you.
[10:31] &gt;&gt; God has planted eternity in your heart.
[10:34] &gt;&gt; So in Proverbs chapter 31
[10:37] verse 16, it says she, speaking of this
[10:40] virtuous woman, this virtuous woman is
[10:42] an example of a daughter of God. She is
[10:44] an example or the image of the bride and
[10:48] she's a lesson for all of us. This
[10:50] virtuous woman teaches us things that
[10:52] whether you be a a man or a woman, it's
[10:54] an example of a daughter of God. Uh it
[10:57] is a she's in the image of the bride of
[10:59] Christ and she's a lesson for all of us.
[11:02] Says she considerth a field and buyth it
[11:07] with the fruit of her hands. She
[11:09] planteth a vineyard. When it says that
[11:12] she considers a field, she devises, she
[11:14] plans, she fixes her mind uh upon this
[11:18] field for careful examination. She's not
[11:21] just it's not just she sees it and she
[11:23] buys it, but she sees it, she considers
[11:25] it, she meditates upon this opportunity.
[11:28] And it says she buys the field. The the
[11:31] phrasing that's used, it could be that
[11:32] she purchases it or she receives it or
[11:34] acquires it, but it suggests that she
[11:36] takes possession.
[11:38] She sees the field. She considers it.
[11:40] She meditates on it, but now she's
[11:42] taking ownership over it. She holds it
[11:45] to care over it. And it says she plants
[11:48] a vineyard in that field. She sets seeds
[11:52] in that field to grow. She's making
[11:56] investments in that field. It's from
[11:58] these phrases that I get these words
[12:01] plan, possess, plant.
[12:05] That we ought to ourselves plan as she
[12:08] considers the field. You ought to look
[12:10] at the field. Meditate on these fields.
[12:12] Think about them. Plan in your mind.
[12:15] Look at this field before you and think
[12:16] about what can you can do with it. What
[12:18] opportunities it provides you. And
[12:21] there's many different fields. In John
[12:23] 4:35, Jesus says, "Lift up your eyes and
[12:25] look on the fields." He's telling them
[12:28] there while you say, "We got four months
[12:30] to the harvest." He says, "Look now.
[12:31] They're white now for harvest."
[12:33] &gt;&gt; So there's different fields that you
[12:35] could think about. The scriptures are a
[12:37] field. Your heart is a field. Your home
[12:40] is a field. Your children are a field.
[12:42] This church is is a field. There's your
[12:45] your where you work, your neighborhoods.
[12:47] There's fields that are set before us.
[12:49] And we ought to give thought to those
[12:51] fields that are before us.
[12:53] &gt;&gt; And not just think about them, lest us
[12:55] all we do is think. But we must also
[12:57] possess those fields.
[12:59] &gt;&gt; When I say plan, I'm talking about
[13:01] meditating, considering, thinking about
[13:02] these opportunities. But then also when
[13:05] we say she buys this field, I'm using
[13:07] this phrase possess. In other words,
[13:08] we're going to assume responsibility
[13:10] over them. Take some ownership.
[13:14] Uh and and in doing so, we're going to
[13:17] assume responsibility, take ownership,
[13:19] and then thereby exercise control that
[13:22] I'm not just going to have this
[13:24] attitude, well, whatever happens
[13:25] happens. There's nothing I can do to
[13:26] stop it. That could be our attitude
[13:28] towards the world today. It's so dark
[13:30] out there. It's so black. It's so awful.
[13:32] there's nothing we can do. But that's
[13:34] simply not true.
[13:36] &gt;&gt; I had a brother ask me here recently
[13:38] about uh in about homeschooling and and
[13:42] I know in some churches a lot of people
[13:43] homeschool and other churches maybe
[13:45] nobody homeschools and this church
[13:46] doesn't have any particular doctrine as
[13:48] it relates to that every individual
[13:50] should do that uh according to their own
[13:52] leadership in their own family in their
[13:54] own home. And one brother was asking me
[13:56] well what's the what's the point of
[13:58] homeschooling or what's the reason for
[14:00] doing it? And the question was, are
[14:02] schools so bad now that if you send your
[14:04] kids to school, are you are you just
[14:06] setting them up for failure? And I in
[14:08] our fellowship, I just made the point
[14:09] that I don't believe if you send your
[14:11] kids to public school, you're giving
[14:13] them over to the devil. But they are
[14:15] going to be in the world and around
[14:17] worldly influences and worldly things.
[14:19] It may be inappropriate teaching, but
[14:21] what you do at home,
[14:24] &gt;&gt; to take ownership of that vessel, to
[14:26] take ownership of that field is enough
[14:29] to protect them when you send them out
[14:31] into school, into the workforce, when
[14:33] you tell them to run out and go do an
[14:35] errand and go buy this or they're around
[14:36] extended family. Because the devil's not
[14:39] just in the public school system.
[14:41] &gt;&gt; I went to private school. I found that
[14:43] the the temptations and the peer
[14:45] pressure were worse in a Christian
[14:46] private school than in public school. So
[14:49] charter school, private school, even in
[14:51] home school, sometimes you have the
[14:53] worst classmates,
[14:55] right? So sometime you're not able to
[14:57] get away from evil influences and and
[15:00] and ill temperaments. But the time that
[15:03] your parent you spend with your children
[15:05] as a field, you can protect them. As we
[15:09] saw in the scripture, you build up the
[15:10] hedges. you you you keep things out. You
[15:13] take care take care over the and so then
[15:17] not only did she consider the field and
[15:19] then buy it and take ownership, but it
[15:20] said she planted.
[15:22] And so we're to plan, possess, and then
[15:24] plant in these fields. That means
[15:26] there's an investment of your time and
[15:28] your resources. You're not just thinking
[15:30] about it. And it's not just a one-time
[15:32] transaction, but you're then investing.
[15:35] And part of this planting is to take the
[15:38] right seed and sew it into the ground.
[15:40] and not just say, "Wow, we sowed the
[15:42] seed." But then also, you must give it
[15:44] that goodly nurture
[15:46] &gt;&gt; to raise our children in the admonition
[15:48] of the Lord. There's a godly nurture
[15:50] that we're to give our children.
[15:53] &gt;&gt; And I found it very edifying to me to
[15:56] say that with the fruit of her hands,
[15:58] she planted a vineyard. The fruit there
[16:01] is the produce of the ground. It speaks
[16:02] of progeny or children of fruit of the
[16:04] womb. But it's the fruit of her hands.
[16:08] this from the that which she already
[16:10] had, the profit that she had, the thing
[16:13] she had already received, she sold that
[16:15] back into the earth. So, we're we're not
[16:18] trying to borrow to invest. God's given
[16:21] you something. God's giving things into
[16:24] your hand. He's given you opportunity.
[16:25] He's given you gifts. He's given you the
[16:27] Holy Spirit. He's given you the word.
[16:29] You can sew that back into these fields.
[16:32] &gt;&gt; You can dig into these fields. You can
[16:34] explore these fields. You can try to get
[16:36] something out. She took the fruit of her
[16:38] hands and she planted a vineyard.
[16:42] In Exodus 4:es 1:3,
[16:45] when Moses is standing before the Lord,
[16:47] he tries to offer up some excuses as to
[16:49] why he doesn't think he'll be able to be
[16:51] an effective servant. And he says, "But
[16:53] behold, they will not believe me, nor
[16:55] hearken unto my voice, for they will
[16:57] say, the Lord hath not appeared unto
[16:59] thee." So, he's has an excuse, a
[17:01] built-in excuse. And the Lord said unto
[17:04] him, "What is that in thine hand?" And
[17:07] he said, "A rod." And I thought of the
[17:10] scripture when I was looking at these
[17:11] things last week. How that sometimes we
[17:14] offer these excuses. Well, Lord, what
[17:15] can I do? How how can I protect this?
[17:18] And how can I grow that? Or how can I
[17:20] make a best of this opportunity? God
[17:22] probably says, "What have I already
[17:23] given you? What have I already placed in
[17:26] your hand? What opportunities have you
[17:28] already been given? What gifts do you
[17:30] already have at your disposal?" He says,
[17:32] "What is in your hand?" He said, "A
[17:33] rod." And he said, "Cast it on the
[17:35] ground."
[17:37] We've been given opportunities. We give
[17:39] gifts and seeds and things in her own
[17:41] hand. As she took the fruit of her hand
[17:43] and she swed it into the earth, he says,
[17:44] "Cast on the ground." And he cast on the
[17:46] ground and it became a serpent. And
[17:47] Moses fled from before. I know there's
[17:49] more to this story how he begins to pick
[17:51] it up. But God is showing himself with
[17:53] him. And brother Badam even uses this.
[17:55] What is that in thy hand? God's placed
[17:57] something in your hand. Use it.
[17:59] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, I just don't know. The
[18:00] forces in the world today are too
[18:02] great." You've got the sword of the
[18:03] word.
[18:05] &gt;&gt; That's more powerful. You got prayer and
[18:07] committ. You got all these different
[18:08] things at your disposal. We ought to use
[18:10] them. These things that we have, sew
[18:12] them into the field.
[18:15] &gt;&gt; Without the proper planning and
[18:17] possessing and planting, we risk
[18:18] becoming unfruitful.
[18:20] &gt;&gt; And maybe that's the worst, but maybe
[18:23] the most catastrophic would be just our
[18:25] lives full of other things. Right.
[18:28] &gt;&gt; It's one statement I read one time. You
[18:30] want to know how to keep the uh the the
[18:32] the weeds out of the bushels? Pack them
[18:34] full of wheat.
[18:36] And that's one thing you could try to do
[18:38] instead of trying to always worry about
[18:40] uh uh what's be what else is being sown.
[18:42] So good seed and care for that seed.
[18:46] &gt;&gt; Otherwise, your your garden become full
[18:48] of weeds.
[18:50] &gt;&gt; Proverbs chapter 24, we're going to be
[18:52] read verses 30 to 34, but we'll just
[18:54] skip a couple things in there here.
[18:57] This is the observation that is made. I
[18:59] went by the fields of the slothful
[19:02] and by the vineyard of the man void of
[19:04] understanding. These could be one and
[19:05] the same, but I like the way that he
[19:06] breaks it out. The field of the lazy,
[19:09] the sluggish, or the vineyard of the
[19:12] owner that lacks understanding.
[19:15] So the lazy can own a field. The unwise
[19:19] can own a vineyard. So I went by the
[19:21] field of the slothful. I went by the
[19:23] vineyard of one void of understanding.
[19:26] Proverbs 21:2 says, "The desire of the
[19:29] slothful killth him, the fleshly
[19:32] desires, the wants of the flesh." How
[19:34] the wandering of desire uh it leads
[19:37] astray. It's vanity and vexation. So the
[19:40] sloth desire of the slothful killth him
[19:42] for his hands refuse to labor.
[19:46] He has a field
[19:48] but he won't labor in that field. He has
[19:51] dreams, imaginations and dreams. Oh,
[19:53] this is such a awesome field. There's so
[19:55] much that could be done, but he never
[19:56] acts to take advantage of it.
[19:59] Proverbs 12 11, he that tillth his land
[20:02] shall be satisfied with bread. There's
[20:04] your labor.
[20:06] You have a field. You have an
[20:07] opportunity. Maybe you didn't buy that
[20:09] field, but you've received it. Now, till
[20:12] it, dig about it, sow the right seed. He
[20:15] that tills his land shall be satisfied
[20:17] with bread. Notice the different points
[20:19] at which uh that references. Tilling is
[20:23] in the beginning, eating's at the very
[20:25] end.
[20:26] &gt;&gt; You till a field to sew the seed. And
[20:28] there's a long time between that and the
[20:30] time that that harvested grain actually
[20:33] becomes bread.
[20:35] &gt;&gt; So it's showing there must be labor,
[20:36] this exerting, this planting, this
[20:38] possessing and planting. He that tillth
[20:40] the land, he that does those things will
[20:42] be satisfied with bread. But he that
[20:43] followeth vain persons is void of
[20:46] understanding.
[20:48] So you can see how the scriptures in
[20:50] Proverbs, if you read the book and you
[20:52] read in these other places, you read,
[20:53] "Well, I went to the field of the
[20:54] slothful, you can see, well, the desire
[20:56] of the slothful kills him because he
[20:58] doesn't labor." So you could already
[21:00] begin to guess what that field looks
[21:02] like. He went by the vineyard of the man
[21:04] void of understanding. Well, a man who's
[21:06] void of understanding follows vain
[21:08] people,
[21:09] &gt;&gt; vain examples, empty, void promises,
[21:14] useless with no no substance.
[21:18] But he that tills the land, he'll enjoy
[21:21] bread. So I went by the field of the
[21:24] slothful and by the vineyard of the man
[21:26] void of understanding. Verse 31. And lo,
[21:28] it was all grown over with thorns and
[21:30] nettles had covered the face thereof,
[21:32] and the stone wall thereof was broken
[21:34] down. Remember how God said that when he
[21:37] had his vineyard, he hedged it. He got
[21:40] all the rocks out of it. He swed the
[21:42] right seed. He built the tower. He put
[21:44] laborers in there. And so we see the
[21:47] wall is broke down. It's grown over with
[21:49] thorns and nettles and covers the face
[21:51] thereof. Then I saw and considered it
[21:54] well. I looked upon it and received
[21:58] instruction.
[21:59] Could this be part of what that virtuous
[22:02] woman does? She may look at a field and
[22:03] say, "Oh, the wall is broken down. It's
[22:06] covered with nettles and thorns and it's
[22:08] all grown over and it's it it's
[22:11] unfruitful." But the more you look at
[22:13] it, you can see there was potential
[22:15] here.
[22:16] &gt;&gt; There was an opportunity here here. But
[22:19] the walls been torn down. Thorns have
[22:21] overcome whatever was growing in it that
[22:23] could have been fruitful. The nettles
[22:25] have covered the face thereof. So he
[22:26] looked, he considered and received
[22:28] instruction. And he could devise deduce
[22:30] that yet a little sleep, a little
[22:32] slumber, a little folding of the hands
[22:35] to sleep. That just even sounds I mean
[22:38] just fleshly. Kind of sounds nice,
[22:40] doesn't it? Just little,
[22:43] you could just imagine it, right? Just a
[22:45] little folding of the hands to sleep.
[22:48] Don't get too comfortable, but let's
[22:49] just He says, "But
[22:53] so shall thy poverty come as as one that
[22:55] travaleth traveleth
[22:58] and thy want as an armed man." Suddenly,
[23:03] just a little recreation, just a little
[23:06] enjoyment.
[23:07] You know, there's even sometimes just
[23:09] let kids be kids. Well, that that just
[23:12] becomes just let teenagers be teenagers.
[23:15] Well, just they're just a they're just a
[23:17] young soul, right? And before you know
[23:19] it, they're 50 years old like little
[23:20] kids.
[23:22] So, there's a there's an idea. Well,
[23:24] just let let them be. Let them be. Well,
[23:26] just a little folding of the hands,
[23:28] just a little sleep, but then poverty
[23:30] comes suddenly. It arrives eventually
[23:33] and it takes you by force.
[23:36] the want as an armed man. In other
[23:38] words, you're seized by it. He, "Oh, no.
[23:40] I need bread."
[23:42] And this is what the this observer
[23:44] learns in the field of the slothful, in
[23:46] the vineyard of the man void of
[23:47] understanding that he let his fleshly
[23:50] desires kill him
[23:52] because he refused to labor. He didn't
[23:54] till his land. He pursued vanity. Is
[23:58] void of understanding. a field which had
[24:01] walls built about it and ground that
[24:03] could obviously produce life because
[24:04] thorns and nettles found enough
[24:06] substance to live. It did not provide
[24:08] him what he needed in that time of want.
[24:12] Proverbs 6 to 11 says, "Go to the ant,
[24:17] thou sluggard." Anybody ever had that
[24:19] quoted to you?
[24:22] Go to the ant, thou slugger. Didn't you
[24:24] notice it doesn't say, "Go to the go to
[24:26] the ant, thou sluggard. consider her
[24:28] ways and be wise. Which having no guide,
[24:31] overseer, a ruler, provideth her meat in
[24:34] the summer, and gatherth their food in
[24:36] the harvest, laboring for the next
[24:39] season in the opportunities that the
[24:42] current season provides.
[24:43] &gt;&gt; Right?
[24:44] &gt;&gt; You can look at a field and say, "Oh
[24:45] man, that field is just brown. There's
[24:48] nothing growing in it. It's covered up
[24:49] with snow or water. That is a worthless
[24:52] field." Said, "Well, what season is it?
[24:54] &gt;&gt; What time of year? What season have we
[24:56] found it in? You provide your meat in
[24:58] the summer. You gather food in the
[25:00] harvest. And he says, "How long will
[25:01] thou sleep, oh sluggard? When wil thou
[25:04] arise out of thy sleep?" Why? Because
[25:06] just a
[25:08] little sleep, a little slumber, a little
[25:10] folding of the hands to sleep. And it
[25:13] again it says, "Yet a little sleep, a
[25:15] little slumber, a little folding of the
[25:16] hands to sleep. So shall thy poverty
[25:19] come as one that travelth and thy want
[25:21] as an armed man."
[25:24] the Bible using repetition,
[25:28] repeating to us these things so that we
[25:30] recognize there's the wants of the
[25:32] flesh. And do you realize just as much
[25:34] as it's needy for the flesh to rest that
[25:37] if you rest inappropriately or too much,
[25:39] then you're not going to be able to meet
[25:40] the other needs of the flesh of eating
[25:44] &gt;&gt; actually takes some wisdom to look at
[25:45] the needs of the flesh. And I could say
[25:47] this about individuals or within
[25:49] families and boys and girls and
[25:51] teenagers that they have certain natural
[25:53] desires and things that they want to do
[25:55] and say, "Oh, well, this is let them
[25:57] have fun and this affords us. This
[25:59] affords us an opportunity to enjoy this
[26:01] and those things are fine." But without
[26:03] moderation and wisdom
[26:05] that you can say, well, we're doing
[26:07] this, we're doing this, but then you
[26:08] forgot to do this and this is just as
[26:09] important naturally.
[26:11] &gt;&gt; This is just as necessary.
[26:14] a lot of things that you could say,
[26:15] well, you know, this should be okay and
[26:17] that should be okay. And I may be just
[26:19] using some real general phrases, but I
[26:21] think it's important for us as parents
[26:22] to think about it ourselves and make
[26:24] direct and specific application.
[26:27] We have to think about these things.
[26:29] Plan,
[26:31] consider.
[26:33] Proverbs chapter 13:4, the soul of the
[26:36] slugard desireth and hath nothing. has a
[26:39] lot of wants, has a lot of desires, but
[26:41] doesn't have the wisdom or the activity
[26:44] to satisfy that desire. But it says,
[26:46] "But the soul of the diligent shall be
[26:48] made fat."
[26:49] What's the diligence? One that plans,
[26:54] one that's willing to invest, take
[26:55] possession.
[26:58] And diligence must be given to those
[26:59] things which are before us. You have an
[27:02] opportunity.
[27:04] I think one thing that we express to our
[27:06] children and even we express to young
[27:08] people and I think it's wise for us to
[27:10] repeat this as parents. We're in a
[27:12] different season of life than our
[27:13] children
[27:15] &gt;&gt; and we should be impressing upon uh our
[27:18] children and and single people. This is
[27:21] a particular season that gives you
[27:23] opportunities. It's the season before
[27:25] you to do as the ant does to gather food
[27:29] and the harvest for the next season
[27:31] that's coming.
[27:33] And therefore, we must give diligence to
[27:35] the things that are immediately before
[27:36] us and within our power.
[27:39] &gt;&gt; There may be a lot of things that are
[27:40] not within your power. And for some
[27:42] reason, I think we concern ourselves
[27:44] more often with what other people are
[27:46] doing, right? Can you believe that
[27:48] person? They're yawning in church,
[27:50] right?
[27:54] Who else yawned? If you didn't yawn,
[27:56] you're a narcissist
[27:58] according to non-narcissistic people,
[28:00] right?
[28:03] There there's a a tension that we can
[28:07] fixate on other things. The ant having
[28:10] no ruler, no guide or overseer
[28:14] knows what they need to do and they do
[28:15] it.
[28:19] &gt;&gt; Reminds me of the
[28:22] uh the phrase the early bird gets the
[28:24] worm.
[28:26] And so the father was instructing
[28:28] instructing his son. He says, "Son, the
[28:30] early bird gets the worm." And he said,
[28:31] "Well, what about the worm who was
[28:33] early?"
[28:35] And the father said he was coming home
[28:37] late.
[28:39] And so there's a lesson there. You don't
[28:42] want to use the worm as your example.
[28:44] You may be getting eaten by the bird,
[28:46] but you want to take your you want to be
[28:48] active in those things which are before
[28:50] you. The Song of Solomon chapter 1 verse
[28:53] 6, it's uh kind of jumping right in the
[28:57] middle of this. And the Song of Solomon
[28:58] is one of those books that's really
[29:00] tricky to read because you have
[29:01] different speakers in it. But he says,
[29:03] "Look not upon me because I am black.
[29:07] Because the son hath looked upon me and
[29:09] that black there is kind of just
[29:11] weathered.
[29:13] My mother's children were angrith me.
[29:16] They made me the keeper of the
[29:18] vineyards, but my own vineyard have I
[29:20] not kept." Think of what's happened here
[29:23] where they've been active. They've been
[29:25] laboring. They've been working. There's
[29:26] a lot of things that they've done. And
[29:28] so because of it, they're weary. They're
[29:30] they're they're worn. They've been
[29:32] affected by the elements. They're out
[29:33] there laboring and working. But the
[29:35] phrase, "My own vineyard have I not
[29:38] kept?" I use this because we may be busy
[29:42] and we might be planting, possessing,
[29:43] and planting, but are you even in your
[29:45] right the right field?
[29:47] &gt;&gt; Are you even laboring for those things
[29:49] which are yours? Those things which are
[29:51] your possession? I I'm working. I'm
[29:53] busy. I'm keeping. I'm keeping. I'm
[29:54] keeping. But what are you keeping up
[29:56] with?
[29:58] &gt;&gt; Cuz the the the observer here says, "My
[30:01] own vineyard have I not kept? I may look
[30:05] like I'm working. I may be weary and I
[30:07] may be struggling and striving and I'm
[30:09] very very busy, but are you busy with
[30:11] the things that matter?"
[30:14] In 2 Thessalonians 3:1 it says, "For we
[30:17] hear that there are some which walk
[30:19] among you disorderly, working not at
[30:21] all, but are busy bodies."
[30:26] That interesting. They're walking
[30:28] disorderly. And how are they disorderly?
[30:30] They don't work.
[30:31] &gt;&gt; They're not laboring. And the phrase
[30:34] here, busy bodies, we might think that
[30:36] has just to do with maybe their talking,
[30:39] but it just means they they kind of
[30:41] bustle about uselessly. It's a useless
[30:43] hustle. They busy oneself about needless
[30:47] things or useless matters.
[30:51] That's not even speaking about busy
[30:53] bodies in other people's matters, but
[30:55] they're just busy with useless things.
[30:58] We hear there are some that walk
[31:00] disorderly. like, "Oh, tell me what are
[31:02] they doing that's disorderly?" They're
[31:04] they're busy with things that don't
[31:07] produce fruit.
[31:09] &gt;&gt; They're busy with things that don't
[31:10] feed, that don't edify. They don't labor
[31:13] and work fruitfully. He says, "They're
[31:15] not working at all, but are busy bodies.
[31:19] They may not be lazy and slothful uh and
[31:22] other things, but they're not laboring
[31:25] in things that are fruitful."
[31:28] &gt;&gt; Peter does address it in the other
[31:29] sense. 1 Peter chapter 4:15. But let
[31:31] none of you suffer as a murderer or as a
[31:33] thief or as an evildoer or as a busy
[31:36] body in other men's matters. That means
[31:39] a medddler in other people's affairs.
[31:43] Just as the one said, "I keep vineyards
[31:45] and I'm in everybody else's field and
[31:47] I'm working and laboring in everybody
[31:48] else's field, but my own vineyard have I
[31:50] not kept." Let it not be said of you
[31:52] that you're busy in other people's
[31:54] business,
[31:55] even willingly, even sincerely, and
[31:58] maybe not with a tongue or just a
[32:00] meddal, but you're busy helping everyone
[32:02] else, but you're not helping those that
[32:04] matter most to you,
[32:06] &gt;&gt; the things that are most pertinent and
[32:08] relevant to you. I remember one time we
[32:11] were I might have mentioned this before,
[32:13] but for a number of years we were able
[32:16] to bring a group of brothers to the
[32:18] men's meeting in Tennessee that Brother
[32:20] Barry Coffee host and Hickory Bible
[32:22] Tabernacle and for a number of years
[32:23] were able to do it and we got to where
[32:24] we would we would rent a van and a dozen
[32:26] brothers would go off to these meetings
[32:28] and we did it for a few years and then
[32:29] one year one brother said, "I have
[32:32] things at home I have to take care of,
[32:34] so I'm not going to go." And he was
[32:36] apologetic. I said, "This just proves
[32:39] the meetings work." And another brother
[32:42] had a wife who was pregnant, didn't have
[32:43] a job, and had two little ones under the
[32:45] age of two or something like that, and
[32:46] financially couldn't afford. He's like,
[32:48] "Man, I can't wait to go to these
[32:49] meetings." And it's like, I don't know
[32:50] if they're helping,
[32:52] right? Because there's a time and a
[32:54] season. It's like, I've benefited from
[32:56] this. I I I've grown up now. I can work
[32:59] with those things. I have resources to
[33:01] address the needs in my own family and
[33:03] and in my life. And I'm not trying to
[33:05] for the pretense and for vanity do all
[33:08] these other things.
[33:11] I think we should take a moment to
[33:13] consider this verse as it speaks of a
[33:16] busy body being one who is a meddler in
[33:19] other people's affairs. I want you to
[33:21] notice your company if you're this a
[33:23] murderer, a thief, an evildoer
[33:26] are all on par with the busy body.
[33:30] And so those who meddle
[33:34] in other people's matters are included
[33:36] with murderers, thieves, and evildoers.
[33:39] Just something to think about.
[33:43] In Mark chapter 4, Jesus is given the
[33:45] parable of the seeds that are sown and
[33:46] some went by the wayside and found some
[33:49] found stony ground and others found
[33:51] ground with weeds and thorns growing up.
[33:54] It said that that ground in verse 19
[33:56] wherein the seeds were sewn into good
[33:58] ground, but there was other things that
[34:01] grew and choked out the word. It says
[34:03] the cares of this world and the
[34:05] deceitfulness of riches and the lust of
[34:08] other things entering in choke the word
[34:10] and it becometh unfruitful.
[34:16] We must be given diligence. The soul of
[34:18] the diligent shall be made fat.
[34:23] Oh, I wish sometimes the natural, the
[34:25] spiritual type the natural more often.
[34:28] So easy to eat poorly and get fat
[34:31] naturally.
[34:33] But you can't eat spiritually poorly and
[34:36] get grow this soul fat like this. Some
[34:40] of you tried your you got a spiritual
[34:43] eating disorder.
[34:45] And there's a there's an unhealthy way
[34:47] that we're looking out after the things
[34:49] to where our own vineyard, the field
[34:51] that God's given you, the one that you
[34:52] ought to consider, you're not working
[34:54] and in laboring in. And what will
[34:57] happen? Cares of this world,
[34:59] deceitfulness of riches, and lust of
[35:00] other things choke the word. And it
[35:03] says, "And it becometh unfruitful."
[35:06] The danger of not being diligent is that
[35:08] it's either overgrown with weeds that
[35:10] choke out the word, but at the end of
[35:12] the day, the result is not just the
[35:15] weeds, but your lives are not fruitful.
[35:20] So, we must give attention. This is just
[35:22] a very simple, straightforward uh
[35:24] service this morning. I even took out a
[35:26] number of scriptures uh uh from my notes
[35:28] at the last minute just because I didn't
[35:30] want to get venture into some other
[35:32] areas. But attention must be given
[35:36] to the field and that that possession
[35:39] and planting in it.
[35:42] As we look at these being a busy body,
[35:47] busy with things that are useless or
[35:49] don't matter, we can say, well, what
[35:50] fields are you laboring in? What fields
[35:52] do you spend your most time in
[35:56] in terms of planting?
[35:59] What you plant matters, but also when
[36:02] and how you do it matters.
[36:05] What you sow determines what will come
[36:07] up. When you sow determines when it'll
[36:10] come up. How you sow determines how
[36:13] you're going to reap.
[36:15] In Deuteronomy 22:9
[36:19] says, "Thou shalt not sew thy vineyard
[36:22] with diverse seeds." It's two kinds of
[36:24] this mixture. We know according to the
[36:26] scripture that this mixing of seeds is
[36:28] forbidden. It's even tied to the
[36:29] original sin. Lest the fruit of thy seed
[36:32] which thou hast sown and the fruit of
[36:33] thy vineyard be defiled, unholy or
[36:36] desecrated. It even speaks of being
[36:38] burned. So say that there is a lack of
[36:42] wisdoms. The Bible says the vineyard of
[36:44] the man void of understanding and behold
[36:47] it was growing up with thorns and
[36:48] nettles and it was covered over the it
[36:50] was just completely covered over. There
[36:53] could be this lack of wisdom in planting
[36:56] where you plant this and you plant that
[36:58] but there's been no thought given to uh
[37:01] the mixture of seed that you're sewing
[37:03] together such that healthy plants aren't
[37:05] able to survive.
[37:08] Here it speaks of vines intertwining or
[37:10] mingling even according to the law. In
[37:12] doing so it' make it unlawful or even
[37:13] unfit to use.
[37:16] So, we have to give care as to how much
[37:18] seed we're sewing, how we're sewing it,
[37:21] when we're sewing it, and just the
[37:23] diversity of things we're sewing.
[37:26] Can say this over and over again. If we
[37:29] sew constantly to the flesh,
[37:32] don't be surprised when all you get is
[37:34] fleshly results.
[37:36] &gt;&gt; There ha there must be a sewing to the
[37:38] spirit.
[37:40] In Ecclesiastes 11:4, he that observeth
[37:43] the wind shall not sow, and he that
[37:45] regardeth the clouds shall not reap. We
[37:48] could take from Deuteronomy 22, well, I
[37:50] don't want to mix seeds. I don't want to
[37:51] mix seeds. And and but you have to sew.
[37:54] You have to plant. Just give care to
[37:56] what you're planting.
[37:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:57] &gt;&gt; Brother Aaron, does that mean we should
[37:59] never go to a ball game? Does it mean we
[38:00] should never do this or never do that?
[38:02] Well, you need to answer according to
[38:03] your own convictions and how God leads
[38:05] you within your family. And you better
[38:07] obey the Lord in terms of the token and
[38:09] what you feed on. But you must be sewing
[38:11] the word.
[38:13] &gt;&gt; If all you binge on are things of the
[38:15] world and the word's not being sown,
[38:17] then then that's that's just a an influx
[38:21] of weeds.
[38:23] &gt;&gt; There's ways that things can compete for
[38:25] nutrients and resources and times. We
[38:27] have to plan, consider,
[38:30] but we don't want to be so cautious as
[38:32] to not sow. He that deserveth the wind
[38:34] shall not sow. He that regardeth the
[38:35] cloud shall not reap.
[38:38] I always say do not wait to plant good
[38:40] seed.
[38:43] Can't get caught up just waiting for the
[38:44] perfect conditions or just the right
[38:46] time. Well, a better time, a better
[38:48] time.
[38:50] I remember in our in our family when we
[38:53] had just the real young ones and after
[38:54] Ellie was born and Preston was born and
[38:57] you know, devotions to me reading your
[38:58] Bible and praying uh had a certain kind
[39:01] of tenor to it. You read your Bible, you
[39:03] prayed, you looked at things, and you
[39:05] flipped through the concordance and and
[39:06] and it was very it was kind of
[39:08] straightforward.
[39:09] A and then you have a one-year-old who
[39:11] won't sit still. And when the seventh
[39:14] seal was open, there was sound of Hey,
[39:17] listen. Can't you be quiet for 30
[39:19] seconds? The seals are opening, right?
[39:22] We're gonna listen to spoken words of
[39:24] original seed tonight. That's why we
[39:25] started at four o'clock. Hey, sit still.
[39:28] And you and you could be so uh
[39:30] legalistic and so harsh. You say, "Oh,
[39:33] well, they're so young. Ah, devotions
[39:35] are a waste of time." No. Uh-uh.
[39:38] &gt;&gt; Meet them where they are.
[39:40] &gt;&gt; Right. I I I still remember to this day
[39:42] one of the most life-changing moments
[39:44] I've ever experienced was when brother
[39:46] Mike Walls was doing a devotion at one
[39:48] of those men's meetings and he said,
[39:49] "When you do de do devotions with your
[39:51] family, when you have those little ones
[39:53] and you get down to pray, what's the
[39:55] first thing that happens when you get on
[39:56] your knees and you have a toddler? They
[39:58] jump on your back."
[40:00] Every time we went to pray family
[40:02] devotion, boom, one of the kids was on
[40:03] my back. And he said, "Just let them
[40:05] crawl all over you. Let them get up and
[40:07] down." said the important thing is that
[40:08] you're just taking that time around the
[40:11] things of God
[40:12] &gt;&gt; and that'll make an impact and in that
[40:14] moment it changed my life. I believe it
[40:16] made changes in my family's life because
[40:18] then I realized just find a way to enjoy
[40:20] it for the 5 10 15 minutes and then it
[40:23] got to where my kids would never let a
[40:25] night go by without doing devotions
[40:28] because they wanted that we found a way
[40:29] to make it exciting and engaging and we
[40:31] we let them crawl all over us and we did
[40:33] certain activities. The point is don't
[40:35] wait for a better time.
[40:38] &gt;&gt; He's always absorbing the times and
[40:39] always watching the wind. Well, it's too
[40:41] windy today to sew. They're too young to
[40:42] do this or it's not a good time. That's
[40:44] never not a good time to sew good seed.
[40:48] &gt;&gt; And then also, he that regardeth the
[40:50] clouds shall not reap. In other words,
[40:51] do not delay in harvesting good fruit.
[40:54] Jesus said, "Lift up your eyes and look
[40:56] at the fields."
[40:58] We can't get caught just waiting for
[41:00] just the right time. Seow good seed.
[41:02] &gt;&gt; Right? And I if I could in
[41:06] express it this way, the external
[41:08] conditions should not determine your
[41:11] confidence in God's promise.
[41:14] &gt;&gt; You look at how dark the world is. With
[41:16] how dark the world is and how evil this
[41:18] world is and how hard the world is, you
[41:19] can say, "Well, the seed don't work or
[41:22] the seed won't work." And that's just
[41:24] simply not true.
[41:26] &gt;&gt; The word will work.
[41:28] &gt;&gt; The effort is worth it. That's right.
[41:31] &gt;&gt; The labor will not be in vain. No matter
[41:33] how hard it looks, how bad it looks, how
[41:35] dark it is. Don't look at all the
[41:37] external conditions. Certainly, don't
[41:39] even look at it in your own children's
[41:40] hearts and lives. Well, they're just too
[41:42] stubborn or they don't do this and they
[41:43] don't do that. Don't look at the
[41:45] external conditions to determine your
[41:47] confidence in God's promises and his
[41:50] process.
[41:51] &gt;&gt; Keep believing that if you plant and you
[41:54] water and you plant and you set the
[41:56] right example, better is the side of the
[41:57] ice. Better is your example of diligence
[42:00] in sewing good seed
[42:03] &gt;&gt; than the wondering of their desire.
[42:06] &gt;&gt; The Bible says in 2 Corinthians chapter
[42:08] 9 verse 6, "But this I say, he which
[42:11] seweth sparingly shall reap also
[42:13] sparingly."
[42:16] And he which seweth bountifully shall
[42:18] reap also bountifully.
[42:21] Notice these scriptures deal with what
[42:23] you sow, when you sow,
[42:27] and how you reap. If you sow sparingly,
[42:30] you're going to reap sparingly. This
[42:31] works for good and bad.
[42:34] &gt;&gt; The world might call it karma, right?
[42:36] You get your comeuppant. Something
[42:38] happens. It's like, man, you asked for
[42:39] that.
[42:41] And if we sow sparingly, we're going to
[42:43] reap sparingly. But if we sow
[42:46] bountifully, we'll reap also
[42:47] bountifully. And this works because God
[42:49] is not mocked. Whatsoever you sow, you
[42:51] reap. And if you're going to sow to bad
[42:54] things, you're going to get bad things
[42:56] out of life. So Galatians 6:9 says, "And
[42:59] let us not be weary and welloing."
[43:01] That's sowing the right things, planting
[43:03] the right things. It said, "For in due
[43:05] season we shall reap if we faint not."
[43:08] If we do not loosen or relax our faith
[43:11] in sewing the right seed, if we don't do
[43:14] not loosen or relax in that tilling the
[43:17] ground knowing that one day we'll be
[43:19] satisfied with bread.
[43:21] &gt;&gt; When you're tilling the ground, you're
[43:22] not eating bread. When you're tilling
[43:24] the soil and planting the seeds, you're
[43:25] not enjoying the harvest. You but you
[43:27] know that if I stay faithful to this
[43:29] process of planting and possessing and
[43:32] planting them, one day I will enjoy the
[43:34] fruits of this.
[43:36] And for those of you who weren't here, I
[43:37] think maybe it was Wednesday night, we
[43:38] emphasize in the scripture how it's a
[43:40] right of the one who labors in the
[43:42] field. Even if it's not their field and
[43:45] their seed, it is your right to enjoy
[43:47] the fruits of that labor.
[43:51] &gt;&gt; If we don't slack in our faith, we will
[43:53] reap.
[43:55] In Hosea chapter 8 verse 7, it says,
[43:57] "For they have sown the wind and they
[43:59] shall reap the whirlwind."
[44:02] Le let's just uh consider this field for
[44:04] a moment. They've swn the wind that you
[44:08] say how do you sew the wind? They sowed
[44:11] the wind and reaped a whirlwind and
[44:13] that's kind of a more turbulent result.
[44:16] You sow the wind, you reap a whirlwind.
[44:19] You're getting back what you sowed but
[44:22] troubled.
[44:24] &gt;&gt; But then it describes it this way. It
[44:25] hath no stock. The bud shall yield no
[44:28] meal. If so be it yield, the stranger
[44:31] shall swallow it up.
[44:33] It's a very curious statement. For they
[44:35] have sown the wind. But you think of it
[44:38] this way. Wind lacks substance.
[44:42] And it's the sewing to the things that
[44:43] don't edify.
[44:45] Sewing to the things that aren't going
[44:47] to bring forth the kind of life that you
[44:48] can benefit from.
[44:56] It's a minding of those things that are
[44:58] they seem only useless. So they might
[45:00] even if I could say it this way
[45:02] to you. It might just seem
[45:06] uh not not recreational but useless.
[45:09] Well, it doesn't matter. It's trivial.
[45:13] But it's not trivial. You sow to the
[45:15] wind. It's trivial. But you reap the
[45:17] whirlwind.
[45:20] It becomes
[45:22] what? was what you thought was harmless
[45:24] becomes harmful
[45:26] because it feeds the wrong thing.
[45:28] &gt;&gt; You feed emptiness, you're only going to
[45:30] get more emptiness.
[45:32] &gt;&gt; You feed vanity, you're only going to
[45:33] get more vanity. And it says if it
[45:34] yields, strangers shall swallow it up.
[45:36] To me, that tells me that it feeds the
[45:39] wrong thing.
[45:40] &gt;&gt; It feeds a worldly hunger.
[45:44] Brother Bam says, "Why do you crave and
[45:46] why do you thirst?" He said there's a
[45:48] holy thirst placed inside of you that
[45:50] God is wanting to quench that only the
[45:52] mystery of God can satisfy. But he says
[45:54] you let so many things of the world beat
[45:56] it out of you.
[45:58] &gt;&gt; In other words, you feed so many of
[45:59] these empty emotions and these empty
[46:01] things to the point to where that's all
[46:03] you crave.
[46:05] &gt;&gt; That's what doom scrolling is. that
[46:08] that's what all these things we feed on
[46:11] insatiably and you find yourself drawn
[46:13] back to it and you find yourself seeking
[46:15] that that that killer dopamine cycle
[46:18] because you feed yourself those snippets
[46:20] those clips those those things that
[46:22] entertain that part of the mind and the
[46:24] body and so the body it's yielding a
[46:27] desire and the world is eating that up
[46:30] &gt;&gt; and you just stay right in the cycle of
[46:31] that you say well how do I how do I
[46:33] break that cycle feed the right thing
[46:37] &gt;&gt; make make a bold decision to cast off
[46:39] those things and wake up and say, "I I I
[46:41] I I want to start feeding the right
[46:43] thing.
[46:46] &gt;&gt; You're sewing to the wind and you're
[46:47] reaping that whirlwind."
[46:50] Oh, just a little scroll,
[46:54] a little folding of the hands,
[46:57] &gt;&gt; and next thing you know, you're in a
[47:00] stuper.
[47:04] In Job 4:8, even as I have seen, they
[47:07] that plow iniquity and sow wickedness,
[47:10] reap the same.
[47:13] You sow to the flesh, you'll reap of the
[47:15] flesh corruption.
[47:18] You plow iniquity, you sow wickedness,
[47:20] what are you going to get? Iniquity and
[47:23] wickedness.
[47:25] You may not instinctively think this,
[47:28] but there's a tremendous amount of grace
[47:30] that's ministered in that scripture.
[47:33] there's so much iniquity and wickedness
[47:34] in my life.
[47:37] Well, that's what you've been sewing.
[47:40] &gt;&gt; So, that means you have power over the
[47:42] yield
[47:45] &gt;&gt; in your own families, in your children,
[47:47] in your own life. Then you can say,
[47:49] "Wait, I have power over this."
[47:53] &gt;&gt; I can't just be saying, "Oh, well, the
[47:54] devil did this and the devil did La
[47:56] Deia." I mean, don't we all want to just
[47:59] keep blaming Obama?
[48:02] or even more recently Biden and one day
[48:04] we'll be able to blame Gavin Newsome and
[48:07] but at a certain point I just want to be
[48:08] able to say no no I need to take
[48:12] ownership
[48:13] &gt;&gt; of my vineyard
[48:16] &gt;&gt; I mean I don't know what flag my
[48:17] neighbor's flying and I don't know what
[48:19] sign my neighbor over here has in their
[48:21] yard but as for me in my house
[48:24] &gt;&gt; we will serve the Lord
[48:26] &gt;&gt; as for me in my garden I want to give
[48:28] thought as to what is consistent
[48:30] constantly being sown. As for me in my
[48:33] mind, I want to take ownership of the
[48:35] things I'm feeding on. As for me in my
[48:37] ears, I want to give diligence to the
[48:39] things I'm hearing.
[48:42] &gt;&gt; Maybe we can't control the thoughts from
[48:44] coming, but we can keep them from
[48:45] nesting.
[48:48] &gt;&gt; We There may be a lot of seeds that are
[48:49] being sown by the world, but we can try
[48:51] to block them out.
[48:53] &gt;&gt; Say, "No. Uh-uh. Not here."
[48:55] &gt;&gt; Right? We need to get more strapped when
[48:56] it comes to the things of God and the
[48:57] seeds that are being swn in our lives.
[48:59] You know what? get those things out of
[49:00] our minds.
[49:02] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[49:04] &gt;&gt; And it helps minister grace to us to
[49:05] realize, wait a minute, there's a I'm
[49:07] buffeted from all sides and there's a
[49:09] lot of evil in this world, but I've got
[49:11] power over iniquity and wickedness to
[49:14] where I don't have to let it grow.
[49:20] &gt;&gt; I want to use Noah as an example as our
[49:22] closing thought.
[49:26] In Genesis chapter 9 verse 20,
[49:31] I'll read verse 20 and then we'll drop
[49:33] back to verse one. And Noah began to be
[49:35] an husbandman and he planted a vineyard.
[49:39] There's a lot of lessons we could take
[49:40] from this. Noah being as old as he was
[49:42] after the flood began to be a
[49:45] husbandman.
[49:46] He began to plant. Some Jewish writers
[49:48] believe that he found a vine that
[49:50] flooded out of the Garden of Eden in the
[49:51] flood. But Noah began to be a
[49:54] husbandman.
[49:56] It's not too late to look at the field
[49:59] of opportunity before you and plan,
[50:02] possess, and plant.
[50:04] Not too late, no matter how old you are,
[50:06] how long you've been raised in a family
[50:08] or even as a grandparent. You say, "Man,
[50:10] I've never been involved. I've never
[50:12] been uh diligent with my own children."
[50:14] It's not too late to begin to be a
[50:16] husbandman.
[50:17] And it says he planted a vineyard.
[50:20] When he does so, this isn't haphazard
[50:23] because the earth was Noah's field. In
[50:27] verse one, and God blessed Noah and his
[50:29] sons, and said unto them, be fruitful
[50:31] and multiply and replenish the earth.
[50:33] And the fear of you and the dread of you
[50:34] shall be upon every beast of the earth,
[50:36] and upon every fowl of the air, but all
[50:38] that moveth upon the earth, and upon all
[50:40] the fishes of the sea. In your hands are
[50:42] they delivered. Every moving thing that
[50:44] liveth shall be meat for you. Even as
[50:46] the green herb have I given you all
[50:49] things. So when Noah begins to be a
[50:52] husband and plants a vineyard, he's
[50:54] doing so as we've seen before in the
[50:56] image of God as God planted a garden in
[50:58] the beginning. And Noah in this
[51:00] opportunity, he considers takes
[51:03] ownership of the earth. And it says he
[51:04] plants a vineyard. This is a good act.
[51:09] This is the right thing. This is what he
[51:12] ought to do.
[51:14] is to take ownership of the earth. He's
[51:16] given to me the herb to eat. Let me grow
[51:19] things that are edifying.
[51:22] But verse 21,
[51:24] I mean, it sounds like, oh, what a what
[51:26] beautiful things are happening. It's
[51:28] after this great destruction, but Noah
[51:30] and his sons are going to populate the
[51:31] earth. He's been given this almost uh an
[51:34] identical commandment that Adam was
[51:36] given. This is a beautiful thing. And
[51:37] the very next verse, and he drank of the
[51:39] wine and was drunken, and he was
[51:40] uncovered within his tent.
[51:43] There is a a lot of meaning that is
[51:46] meant in this phrase uncovered within
[51:49] his tent. And as you'll read in the next
[51:50] verses, it speaks of their father's
[51:52] nakedness. It it's a phrasing that's
[51:54] used to convey a particular sin. But if
[51:57] I could just use this that it indicates
[52:00] he drank, became drunk, and it speaks of
[52:03] a a moral failure on Noah's part.
[52:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[52:08] And I'm not trying to twist the context
[52:11] or use it in a way that it's not meant,
[52:14] but it does warn us of the improper use
[52:16] of the fruits of our gifts.
[52:19] &gt;&gt; It does warn us of the misuse of the
[52:22] fruits of the field.
[52:25] &gt;&gt; He drank of the wine, which is what that
[52:28] field would have yielded. He planted a
[52:30] vineyard.
[52:32] And I I've tried to read a lot on it and
[52:34] just even to find out what maybe what
[52:36] the some of the Jewish writers and in
[52:38] their traditions they looked at and they
[52:39] some speculate that he just didn't know
[52:41] how intoxicating those grapes were
[52:45] because he hadn't planted those before.
[52:47] He didn't know how what was going to
[52:49] happen. But so whether it be uh
[52:51] intentional or or uh unintentional, it
[52:55] still serves as a lesson to us. He did
[52:57] the right thing. He planted a vineyard,
[53:00] but he it led to moral failure because
[53:03] he didn't use wisdom with the fruits.
[53:09] &gt;&gt; If I could say this
[53:12] before we I want to read our text one
[53:14] more time before we close. But there can
[53:16] be a misuse of gifts.
[53:19] There could be a mixing of seeds that
[53:20] results in if you read into these
[53:22] scriptures and read into what's being
[53:24] said, spiritual adultery.
[53:28] that there can become this
[53:30] immodderation.
[53:32] You realize that even when it comes to
[53:34] what we think are spiritual things that
[53:37] sometimes there's more emphasis given to
[53:40] those optical things, those visual
[53:43] things than it are is than there are to
[53:45] the real heart things,
[53:47] &gt;&gt; the real seed things, the real things
[53:50] that uh that matter. And so we can
[53:53] almost blindly
[53:55] cater to the intoxication of the fruit,
[54:00] cater to the stimulation
[54:03] of certain things and not enough to
[54:05] what's being grown
[54:07] &gt;&gt; and to the field and what's being
[54:08] planted.
[54:11] &gt;&gt; What's been in my heart as we try to
[54:13] just maybe I don't know where we're
[54:15] going to go just exactly next on this.
[54:16] There's some things I felt I could be
[54:18] very specific on in the future services,
[54:21] but we must be given even just recent
[54:24] events have taught me, don't assume
[54:28] what's growing
[54:30] if you haven't planted the seed.
[54:34] &gt;&gt; If you know what seeds you've planted,
[54:37] then you'll know what's in there.
[54:40] And if what you see isn't what you
[54:42] planted, then don't be afraid to begin
[54:44] to inquire as to whether or not
[54:46] something else is being planted. Often
[54:49] times we do this in our own home. All of
[54:51] a sudden, something's happening and
[54:52] things are a little unsettled and
[54:53] something seems to be wrong. And
[54:54] sometimes I'll pull my children aside
[54:56] and I'll have conversations with them.
[54:58] What's been going on lately? Talk to me.
[55:01] Be honest with me. Where are things
[55:02] where do things stand? Because you know
[55:06] what you're sowing. And I'm not saying I
[55:08] do everything perfectly. Sometimes I'm
[55:10] like, I know where he got that.
[55:13] Right. I'm sorry I sowed that. There's
[55:16] some things that, you know, immediately
[55:17] that's on me. But there's times when you
[55:20] can say, "Wait a minute. Something's not
[55:21] right. This isn't what we like to
[55:23] emphasize. This isn't what we're trying
[55:24] to cultivate within our family." And you
[55:26] could recognize something else is being
[55:29] done.
[55:30] &gt;&gt; Something else is being said. And so you
[55:32] don't panic. Oh my goodness, what have
[55:34] they been saying to my boy? What
[55:36] happened to my boys? Right? And all of a
[55:38] sudden, you get worked up about it. Say,
[55:40] "No. Uh-uh. I know how to handle this.
[55:43] &gt;&gt; Those are weeds.
[55:45] &gt;&gt; I need to take care of this. I need to
[55:46] make sure the the walls are still. I
[55:48] need to make sure I'm back on the
[55:49] watchtowwer. I need to give care."
[55:52] &gt;&gt; Because if you haven't planted those
[55:54] seeds and you see them growing, then
[55:56] address them.
[55:58] &gt;&gt; But let me say this to all of us. I say
[56:00] this as a pastor. I have realized that
[56:03] if I don't know what seeds been planted,
[56:06] I can't assume what's growing.
[56:09] &gt;&gt; And so if you have children, then I'm
[56:12] saying this to the parents. It's
[56:14] incumbent upon you to be sure that the
[56:17] word, and when I say the word, I speak
[56:18] of the Bible, but also the message
[56:20] that's been given to us in this day
[56:23] &gt;&gt; through the word of God by brother
[56:24] Brandham to make sure that that's being
[56:27] taught.
[56:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. and that you're expressing it in
[56:31] ways that it's digestible
[56:33] so they can understand the weight of it.
[56:37] &gt;&gt; So that a Sunday school teachers and
[56:38] pastors and everyone else doesn't make
[56:40] the assumption that oh they read their
[56:42] Bibles,
[56:44] they're praying, they know the message.
[56:48] They they know the things that are
[56:50] taught. They know the emphasis. They
[56:53] know the things that aren't emphasized
[56:55] but said that people blow out of
[56:56] proportion.
[56:58] They they they know these things so that
[57:00] one day they're not all a sudden caught
[57:01] by surprise with something. I didn't
[57:04] know the Bible said that. I didn't know
[57:07] the Bible said that.
[57:10] &gt;&gt; You have to really I I you say, "Well,
[57:13] brother, it's all up to you." All right,
[57:14] that's fine. Just give me more time with
[57:16] your kids. Then
[57:19] if that's what if you just want to put
[57:20] it all in the the church to feed your
[57:22] children, then we just need more time
[57:25] and we need more resources. tithing just
[57:28] went up 25%. Right? If you're gonna
[57:30] leave it all on us, right? We need more
[57:33] time. We need more resources. And we'll
[57:35] start putting together nice apps and
[57:36] we'll start buying this and we'll start
[57:38] buying that and we'll make take time.
[57:39] We'll make sure that your children get
[57:40] the word they need. But you know what?
[57:41] I'm a poor substitute
[57:44] &gt;&gt; for you.
[57:47] &gt;&gt; I I'll just say this honestly and I'm
[57:49] not just trying to fill up an hour here.
[57:51] I'm just trying to be follow the
[57:52] leadership of the Lord. Now in the now
[57:55] finally
[57:58] I'm trying to follow the leadership of
[58:00] the Lord right now in this moment to say
[58:02] that I'm here to support you not replace
[58:04] you.
[58:07] &gt;&gt; I'm here to support you. You've got the
[58:10] hardest job there is.
[58:12] &gt;&gt; The job you have. You say, "Oh, brother,
[58:14] you're busy. You got a hard job." No.
[58:15] Uh-uh. I'm supporting those who have the
[58:17] busiest job, have the hardest job.
[58:19] because I'll leave here today, take none
[58:20] of you home except those in my family
[58:22] and my work begins there.
[58:24] &gt;&gt; But the job you have, I'm here to
[58:26] support you in that
[58:27] &gt;&gt; and and what I want to convey is know
[58:30] what you're sewing into your families,
[58:32] into your homes, into your atmosphere,
[58:34] in your field. Think about it, plant it,
[58:36] so that you know when you begin to see
[58:38] the fruits of it,
[58:39] &gt;&gt; right?
[58:40] &gt;&gt; And you know when you're seeing fruits
[58:42] that you haven't sewn,
[58:44] &gt;&gt; like, well, where do you get that from?
[58:46] Where is that coming from? Why do you
[58:48] feel that way? Why all of a sudden you
[58:49] want to pursue this? I found out
[58:51] recently and I didn't know that someone
[58:53] had been trying to influence my son to
[58:54] leave the house, go away to college, sew
[58:58] your wild oats.
[59:00] And it's like, well, where is that
[59:02] coming from?
[59:03] &gt;&gt; You find sometimes there's influences
[59:05] and things that start to subtly creep up
[59:07] and you want to know what you're sewing
[59:09] and what you're planting
[59:11] &gt;&gt; so you know when it's not according to
[59:13] what you're sewing.
[59:15] Proverbs 31:16, "She considerth a field
[59:17] and buyth it."
[59:21] Give consideration to the fields of the
[59:22] scripture.
[59:24] &gt;&gt; Read your Bibles.
[59:26] &gt;&gt; Give consideration to the field of the
[59:28] Son of Man that's been opened up to us.
[59:30] &gt;&gt; Possess it. Plant in it. Buy it. And
[59:33] with the fruit of your hands, plant a
[59:36] vineyard.
[59:38] What God has given us, plant. Hosea
[59:40] 10:12 says, "Sow to yourselves in
[59:42] righteousness, reap in mercy." You want
[59:44] more mercy. How many times say, "Oh, God
[59:46] be merciful." That's one of my one of my
[59:49] prayers. When something happens and
[59:50] people call me and they say, "Oh, this
[59:52] has happened." Or you see something bad
[59:53] happening. I I just find myself God be
[59:55] merciful.
[59:57] And and when we ask God to be merciful,
[1:00:00] there's it even it speaks of Lord be
[1:00:04] merciful. They deserve this.
[1:00:07] Like you you get your just fruits or
[1:00:09] your just reward. Mercy is withholding
[1:00:11] those. I deserve to be punished. I
[1:00:14] deserve the whirlwind. I He said, "God,
[1:00:16] be merciful." But it's it's so amazing.
[1:00:18] It says, "Well, if you want mercy, sow
[1:00:20] righteousness."
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; Do not continue to plow iniquity and sow
[1:00:26] wickedness and sew to the wind and then
[1:00:29] ask God for mercy.
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; If you've done if you planted a lot of
[1:00:32] wild seeds and you need mercy, just
[1:00:34] start sowing righteousness and God will
[1:00:37] be merciful. Amen.
[1:00:39] &gt;&gt; It says, "Break up your follow ground."
[1:00:41] That hard ground. Break it up.
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; How can I do that? Prayer will soften a
[1:00:47] lot of things.
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; Repentance will soften a lot of things.
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; For it is time to seek the Lord till he
[1:00:53] come and re righteousness upon you.
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; Sow to yourselves in righteousness
[1:01:01] &gt;&gt; and he will re righteousness upon you
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; and you will receive re reap mercy.
[1:01:08] Amen.
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; Even to the point to where all those
[1:01:11] things that have been sowed in your
[1:01:12] mind, in your spirit and your family,
[1:01:15] God will take care of the vineyard. And
[1:01:19] you won't reap. You don't have to reap
[1:01:21] all that you've seown. If you do, God
[1:01:23] allows it,
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; but you can reap mercy wherein you
[1:01:26] haven't swed the right things and you
[1:01:28] haven't always done the right things.
[1:01:29] You can begin to be a husbandman and
[1:01:31] plant the right vineyard. Sew in
[1:01:34] righteousness
[1:01:36] and he'll come and reign righteousness
[1:01:38] upon you if you seek him with your whole
[1:01:39] heart
[1:01:41] &gt;&gt; and you'll reap.
[1:01:43] Or musicians, if you could come to your
[1:01:45] instruments because we have a baptismal
[1:01:48] uh four baptismal. Sister Hannah, you're
[1:01:50] still good. We got four different
[1:01:52] baptisms. Got the Mana family, Rashhate
[1:01:55] and Sister Joyce, brother Moesi being
[1:01:57] baptized. Sister Hannah's being baptized
[1:01:59] just wonderful. So we'll take that. will
[1:02:01] maybe just be a little bit abbreviated
[1:02:02] in our worship. But as the musicians
[1:02:05] come, I want to read this statement from
[1:02:06] God's power to transform.
[1:02:09] Brother Bram says, "The word has come to
[1:02:11] pass. It is God's word."
[1:02:15] He says, "Plant it in your heart if you
[1:02:17] want to go in a rapture."
[1:02:20] &gt;&gt; Can you think about that for a moment?
[1:02:23] You plant it in your heart if you want
[1:02:25] to be harvested.
[1:02:28] If you want to be Christians genuine,
[1:02:31] place this word
[1:02:34] as I believe it was Ezekiel, God said,
[1:02:36] take the scroll and eat it up. That the
[1:02:38] prophet and the word could become the
[1:02:40] same. What do we need to do? Take the
[1:02:43] word, plant it in our hearts.
[1:02:46] How? By eating it, reading it, feeding
[1:02:49] on it. If you want to go in the rapture,
[1:02:52] you say, "Well,
[1:02:54] press play and obey." Okay. All right, I
[1:02:57] press play. What I've heard, I'm going
[1:03:00] to obey.
[1:03:02] I am going to take that word and I'm
[1:03:06] going to eat it.
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; I'm going to feed on it.
[1:03:11] I'm going to take it into my heart.
[1:03:15] You say, "Well, rapturing faith lays in
[1:03:17] those tapes." Well, those tapes told me
[1:03:19] that I got to take that and plant it in
[1:03:21] my heart. Amen.
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; He says every promise in there has to
[1:03:26] manifest itself because it's God's
[1:03:27] original seed.
[1:03:29] So if you if you will receive it into
[1:03:31] your heart, if you'll plant it, if
[1:03:32] you'll water it, it has to manifest. He
[1:03:35] says, "Do not let some educated don't
[1:03:38] you let some educated theologian out
[1:03:40] here try to pump it out of you.
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; Don't you let him spray you with that
[1:03:44] carnal science and knowledge and
[1:03:45] education." He says, "Believe God." And
[1:03:48] that's the hardest thing to do is to
[1:03:51] believe God.
[1:03:53] How? Well, it's a God that you don't
[1:03:55] see.
[1:03:57] It's a God that you can't verify. Don't
[1:03:59] you wish it was just like whenever you
[1:04:01] go to pay with a $100 bill, which I know
[1:04:02] all of you do that. You go to pay with a
[1:04:04] $100 bill and and and you hand over
[1:04:06] there and they whip out the marker. They
[1:04:07] hold it up to the light and No, that's
[1:04:08] genuine. Don't you just wish we could do
[1:04:10] that with God? Just give me the
[1:04:11] highlighter. No. Okay. That's genuine.
[1:04:14] No, it takes faith. Amen.
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; Faith becomes that highlighter.
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; Faith becomes that light that shines
[1:04:20] upon something says I see God in this.
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; So whatever we do, we can't let loose
[1:04:24] our faith in God to the things of this
[1:04:26] world. Science, education, knowledge.
[1:04:30] And I trust that God will give you
[1:04:31] wisdom
[1:04:34] to be a husbandman,
[1:04:36] to be a keeper of your own vineyard,
[1:04:39] to not be void of understanding and not
[1:04:41] be lazy. that we can plan, consider,
[1:04:43] think about the opportunities that God's
[1:04:45] given you. Take ownership of the
[1:04:47] responsibility you have over that field
[1:04:48] that you're buying it. You say, "Well, I
[1:04:50] can't buy the field." Receive it in the
[1:04:52] name of the Lord. God's given you these
[1:04:53] responsibilities. God given you these
[1:04:55] gifts and then labor in them. Plant,
[1:04:57] invest in these gifts. There's gifts and
[1:05:00] talents. It's one thing I've noticed, my
[1:05:02] wife has commented on a few times too in
[1:05:03] our fellowship, just how recently it
[1:05:05] just seems like there's been more gifts
[1:05:06] that are manifested themselves in terms
[1:05:08] of people wanting to sing specials and
[1:05:10] work and labor. And I think it's
[1:05:12] wonderful. I think God's saying it's
[1:05:13] time for us to use the things that God
[1:05:15] has given us.
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; I rejoice in the fact that we have
[1:05:19] baptisms. It shows God's dealing with
[1:05:21] hearts and that families are doing the
[1:05:22] right things by emphasizing things to
[1:05:24] their children. So God, help us to be
[1:05:26] the right kind of field as a church, as
[1:05:29] families, and as individuals. If we
[1:05:31] could stand to our feet.
[1:05:37] And Lord, let's just pray with our heads
[1:05:39] bowed.
[1:05:44] Gracious heavenly father, today as we
[1:05:46] close this service,
[1:05:49] we read in Hosea that it says, "Break up
[1:05:51] the file ground." Lord, right now I
[1:05:55] begin with prayer to work on this hard
[1:05:58] soil.
[1:06:00] And I want to take a swing right now
[1:06:03] with the hardness of my heart and say,
[1:06:05] "I believe in you."
[1:06:08] I want to take another swing with this
[1:06:10] pickaxe, with this hoe, and say, "I
[1:06:12] believe your word is true."
[1:06:16] And Lord, I pray that you could wash me
[1:06:18] of all poisonous spray.
[1:06:22] Lord, in this day and age of all these
[1:06:23] this poisonous gas and all this science
[1:06:25] and education and human knowledge, Lord,
[1:06:28] hide thou me in your presence.
[1:06:32] Protect me, Lord.
[1:06:34] But Lord, I'm asking that this ground be
[1:06:36] broken up. But Lord, I'm not just going
[1:06:38] to wait for you to do it. I'm going to
[1:06:40] start beating on it with faith.
[1:06:44] And I believe, Lord, that you'll send
[1:06:46] the rain.
[1:06:48] So may more of us be motivated as
[1:06:50] individuals to be more spiritual. May we
[1:06:53] be more motivated as individuals to be
[1:06:55] more moderate.
[1:06:57] Lord, may we be motiv more more
[1:06:58] motivated as parents and as overseers in
[1:07:00] homes and over relationships
[1:07:04] to consider the field and take ownership
[1:07:06] of it that we would plant with the fruit
[1:07:09] of our hands.
[1:07:11] Bless us. I pray as we commit ourselves
[1:07:13] to you these baptisms. Lord, I pray for
[1:07:15] each one. You promised, Lord, that if
[1:07:18] they repent that they would receive this
[1:07:20] blessed gift.
[1:07:22] So, Father, having repented as they go
[1:07:24] into the water as an outward sign of
[1:07:26] inward regeneration,
[1:07:29] may you give that blessed baptism of the
[1:07:30] Holy Ghost.
[1:07:33] Lord, in the event that there's a
[1:07:34] rebaptism, may there be this
[1:07:36] confirmation that they've obeyed you,
[1:07:38] they've honored you, and may we bury
[1:07:39] that weapon of the devil once and for
[1:07:41] all.
[1:07:43] We love you, Father. that we commit
[1:07:44] ourselves to you in the name of Lord
[1:07:46] Jesus Christ.
