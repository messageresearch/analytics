TRANSCRIPT
========================================
title today is for God so loved just taking it there from John 3:16 and using uh that kind of even with the lips to suggest that there's more that we're looking at or more that's mentioned here but it's for God so loved I think even that phrasing so loved is going to be a little bit important in how I'd like to emphasize this and not wanting to spend much time in review but each one of these are all building together on the subject of perfect love and as we've looked at our relationship to God and his relationship to us or the perfect love that exists from the father to his children, the heavenly father and the children of God. Uh we've looked at that as maybe a horizontal relationship and how that he has a perfect love for us and we're wanting our love to be made perfect for him or have a perfect love towards him. That's the horizontal. But then also the scripture commands us that we must love one another and that the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts. So there's a perfect love in the vertical one to another and from brother to sister and even to mankind. And so we're looking at that and wanting to understand better his love for us uh free our love for him and have a a more perfect love for him and then also have that perfect love one for the other. And I will say this today that this is a setup. And so if you want to get a little bit uh suspicious, I guess I don't mind that. But this is there's a lot in here that's being set up. But I would say it's at least a very critical foundation for where what we're tracking and where we're wanting to go. And I hope that you could just stay real close uh to what we're saying today because I believe it's going to be so simple that you you may just let your thoughts wander a little bit, but really really kind of engage me and really focus and stay with me because I believe the Lord has something tremendous for us. Now in chapter four of the church age book as we've been reading this particular statement in both relationship to the church uh the the church that suffered in martyrdom and through tribulation of the church ages and even the Jews and how they suffered uh at the hand of judgment or even if you want to look at the holocaust uh the question was people say how could God be a loving God if he lets his people suffer. So he says they could not figure out God's love. They thought that love meant no suffering. They thought that love meant a baby with parental care. And so it's almost as if it always stays in that stage where the type of love that a mother has for her newborn or the type of love that parents have for a a baby, an infant, that that's the love that God always has and that's the way that God would treat us. But he says, but he's kind of refuting that notion and he makes this statement that is just so significant. mess might be just uh elective love could have very well been a title that we could have used today but it says God said that his love was elective love and to use that term elective he's drawing from a scriptural principle even using a scriptural word and to say elective we have to think of it this way it was voluntary that it wasn't that God was compelled and forced to love us but it was voluntary because to elect or to be elective it's to choose or to pick out so if I could say this way It's an elective love or it's a selective love. It's a love of discretion. It's a love that's not just, oh well, whatever it is, it doesn't matter. And it's just kind of a I just love everybody, want to put my arms around everybody and an undiscerning uh uh love. There's some people that love food, meaning they'll eat anything, right? And that's not an elective love. That's not a discerning love. That doesn't mean they have a distinguished pallet. They just love to eat, so they'll eat anything. But there's other people who love food and will hardly eat anything because they're discerning in their in their taste and they're they distinguish among things and they love things a particular way. And so that just maybe as an example we can all relate to and everybody's like, "Yeah, I can talk about food all day long, Brother Aaron." So now that we've got everybody's attention, God's love is that way. It is an elective love. So it's a love that has discretion. It's a love that's choosy and it picks. And so when brother Brandham uses the phrase elective love, we we recognize scripturally that God of his own free will before there was creation, he d decreed his love towards specific individuals. And I trust that we're all, you know, believers of the Bible and we can relax when it comes to election and predestination. But God by his own will, free will before any creation, uh, decreed his love for specific people and that is the elect. And that's what God did. God decreed his love towards a specific group of people. And I would say that we could probably all agree that really this love is mysterious. In other words, there's really no explanation that can completely satisfy the question of why. We said that God chose you. And we might all say why. And no matter how much we give, no matter how many explanations we come up with, we probably there's a part of us that then says there's still there's still a mystery to this. I mean, we could use this scripture. We can use this principle, we can use that principle, but there's just something about it that remains almost untouchable because we can't explain it. And brother Brandham in the sermon kinsman redeemer and it's in this sermon he's dealing with Ruth and says there's a hidden revelation in it. It'll draw you closer to God. So it's a love affair. It's a love story. And and he's talking about how that uh he and his wife or I guess they said the kids were uh they were laying in bed a little bit longer. the kids didn't have to go to school and they were talking about answer the question what was hatred and he said hatred had a beginning this was his answer hatred had a beginning now think of that and hold that in your mind hatred had a beginning so it has to have an end now he contrast that love had no beginning so it has no end is forever love is eternal these are important principles as we go forward hatred begins and hatred will end never did begin and it'll never end it's eternal and when a man loves loves a woman and marries her because she's pretty. There'll be an end to that. Now, what is he what is he looking at? Not the love he's talking about. Because you can love somebody because of the way they look or certain characteristics and personalities and say, "Well, why do you love her?" Well, she loves the same food I love and she she does this and she does that. Maybe there's a way that someone can explain it. And he said th that kind of human love is he said that can change. It's temporal. It's conditional. And and there can be an end to that. Even to the extent that the things you love about a person could change or the person that you love for all these reasons they could die. And he said there's an end to that love. He says when a man loves a woman and marries her because she's pretty there'll be an end to that. But when a man finds a woman that he loves he says he don't know why but he loves her. And I believe what he's touching on is maybe hate can be strong and and rational like why do you hate that? Because of this why do you hate them because of that? And he says that love sometimes can be explained. He's he's looking at a human love, but this love that he's talking about is eternal is something that defies explanation ultimately. He says you he don't know why, but he loves her. He says, "And she finds a man that she loves no matter what he looks like." And all all of us said, "Thank God for that." And I think maybe it's even more appropriate saying, you know, she loves him, but even if she doesn't know why, she just does. He says she finds a man that he loves. No matter what he looks like, he loves her, she loves him. He said that's an eternal mate and glory. I believe what he's doing is he's taking a love which is a perfect love and he's and he's taking that and saying that this this union that we see between a man and a woman that love each other that that's a a reflection of a perfect love that's not just tied to human feeling. It's not just explainable by attraction says well he really loves his wife. You're like have you do you know her? She's rich. Of course he loves her. Right? there's maybe not an explanation for it. And so there's a it's a human feeling, human attraction is not the basis for this kind of love. And it's something that he's saying you can't fully explain because he doesn't know why. It's not that he's good-looking. It's not that he's this or she's that, but it's something that is just uh that that is special. It's a special kind of love. And so when John says in 1 John 4:16, "And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God and God in him. When he says we have known and believed, I I I think that we could all say amen to that. But then also recognize that there is more to know, more to believe. And I would say that we must know it to trust it. Doesn't say we just believe God's love. We have to know his love to trust. As brother Bam says, you have to have love fa first to have faith. We must know his love in order to trust it. And we must know it more and trust it more. If if we say that we have a perfect understanding of the love of God, then I would say there would be definitive characteristics of it in our lives because it's that it's that powerful. And so this elective love, as I would even call it, a perfect love is deliberate. I think that's what we were talking about uh uh Wednesday night. It is deliberate. It is intentional. And there there's purpose behind it. And that this love works within God's character. So, it can't act out of character and it it's very protective of God's will and it manifests. So, God loves and therefore it works and it manifests to accomplish his perfect will. Now, as we look at John 3:1 16, I'll read verses 16 and 17 and come to verse 18 here in a moment. Now, we're just going to dive head first into this. It says, "For God so loved." And just by using that to say so loved, doesn't say, "For God loved the world." But it's like for God's so love. We almost can't even say it without saying so because it's so imprinted in our memory. And that's a special love that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life. For God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved. Amen. Now, this is where it's going to be simple, but stay close with me because I'm not making a distinction that's just to to tickle our ears. But there's something to this, but what's being said here that we have to separate from our traditional understanding or maybe our typical conclusions when we read read that and recognize that there's a layer that God's speaking to that is speaking of a special love. And it's and maybe I'll come back to this in a future service. If if not, I I think this is maybe just enough for you to get to think about thinking about a little bit. But you have his audience is Nicodemus, a Jewish rabbi. And what Jesus is doing is refuting the belief that the Messiah's blessing was only to the Jews. Right? So when I say that, I I'm wanting to kind of point to or just kind of hint at the fact there's a mystery here that Nicodemus doesn't know. And Jesus saying, "Ah, I could talk to you about natural things, you won't even receive that. How can I talk to you about heavenly things?" In other words, there's a tremendous mystery that I'm unfolding or that remains to be seen. And you believe in your mind that the Messiah is only going to be a blessing to the Jews by their bloodline back to Abraham. But he's saying there's a there's a greater mystery there. And this mystery is summed up in this phrase, for God so loved the world. And then in verse 17, that he sent his son into the world. Now, when we read that, we think, oh, that he descended out of heaven and he came into the world. And we're thinking of the cosmos, the mankind, all of humanity, the earth, and there he is in Palestine with a physical presence in a in a geographical location among a physical people. But what that word there is translated to in many other areas is he sent his son to the world or among the world or towards the world, unto the world or also for the world. So it's not just into in the sense that you walk into a room a and and it denotes kind of the space you occupy but it speaks of the purpose that what what he's what he's trying to accomplish. I believe even in the Greek lexicon it kind of has a funny definition where it says um the word for there you have to think about Jesse James is wanted for murder and you think oh in other words he's wanted to conduct a crime like I need Jesse James to kill somebody because he's wanted for murder wanted but it means to it means more to purpose or or a prior event or something that was before why he was wanted. It speaks as to why he was wanted, that he's a wanted man because he's committed murder. When God says he sent his son for the world, it speaks to a greater purpose. And so this is if you if you take notes, this is a moment to write this down and and just keep looking back to this. If at any point it in my preaching I begin to fail, I think if you come back to this and try to think of it in terms of this that this is what we're trying to understand, it'll help. So he says, God so loved the world. God is the lover. The world is the loved. So God so loved. So there is love as I've been studying it that this love we're talking about has to have an object. So God is the love of the world is the love. And this love is expressed it expresses it's expressed in a mysterious paradox because for God so loved the world that he sent his own that he gave his only begotten son. And in Romans chapter 8:32 it's it's not maybe as uh sterile as oh he gave his son like he he loaned him or he he he handed him out. He sent him into the world to be a help. It says he spared not his own son. In other words, he sent his son to as a sacrifice but delivered him up. Notice for us all. So he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all. How shall he not with him also freely give us all things? Now the question I want to ask is in Romans 8:32 and then also in John 3:16 and 17. Who are the us? Who's the us all? What what is this world? And I think that's the question that's at the heart of the question today. For God so loved and it says he so loved the world. What is this world that God loved? And we're wanting to consider the dynamics between the lover and the loved. God is the lover. The that's God the world that he loved. That's the loved. And now these are these are the these are the statements that I'm wanting to build on. The love of God has an elected elective object. Brother Bam said his love is elective. And so it's a love that he has for us. So the love of God has this perfect love has an elective object, an elected object. That would be the subject of God's love. So God is the lover and the world is the love. That means his love is to someone. It is for someone. And then not only does it have an elective object, but it is it has a predestinated objective. So it's not just love for someone, but it also has an objective for that object. It is an elective object and a predestinated objective. And so as we read here that he that believeth on him should not perish but have everlasting life. The love of God then uh faith in Christ and eternal life are the benefits for the subjects of God's elective love as we read this for God so loved the world and he gives his only begotten son and this God who is the lover has this love for the world and the benefits are faith in Jesus Christ and eternal life [snorts] and as it says that he he sent his son into the world not to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved his love God so loved as the lover having love having love for the object. So the lover to the loved with that love dynamic. His love cannot condemn the object. Just draw I'm just drawing all these very simple principles out of this verse before we continue. His love cannot condemn the object. This love in being unable to condemn the object can only redeem the object. Amen. For God so loved the world and as he loves as the lover and the loved the dynamics of that relationship are such that no matter what condition listen we've got to understand this absolute. No matter what condition the world found it itself in that world that he's talking about GOD COULD NOT REJECT it because he could not condemn it. HIS LOVE REQUIRED REDEMPTION of it. Amen. This is what is meant in this verse that God so loved he had such a love for this world that even in its deplorable state he had to send a sacrifice to redeem it because the lover for the love required it. And therefore this is where maybe it starts to get a little deep at least a notch. The object of perfect love is therefore eternal because it says that he should never perish. He that believeth in him should not perish. This is this is what's happening when you look at this scripture. The object for God so loved the world. So he that believeth the object of this perfect love is therefore eternal because it can never be ruined. It can never be destroyed. Can never be rejected. That's what perish means. It's it's ruined. It's it's past use. Now then this once we've come to that place that God so loved and so the lover to the loved begins to raise in this scripture alone begins to identify certain principles about perfect love. As brother Bradom said hatred had a beginning and so hatred has an end and love has no beginning so love has no end. Hatred is temporal. Why? Because the object of hate is not eternal. Amen. that whatever whatever there's hatred towards it's going to end. It's temporal because the object of hate is temporal as well. I think that's I think it's a notch deeper and that could just be me because my understanding is growing. But hate is temporal because the object of hate is not eternal. But this sole love, this special love is an eternal love because the object of that love is also eternal. Amen. And so we know that imperfect love or perverted love as brother Brandon calls it, human love will have an end. And so these other things, hatred is is temporary because the object of hatred will have an end. Therefore, hate is not eternal. So God so loved the world, he gives his son. He spares not his son. He gives him as a sacrifice. That he that believeth on him should not perish but have everlasting life. He sent his son for the world, not to condemn the world, but that the world would be saved. So the lover, his love to the loved requires salvation and redemption. But now verse 18 interrupts that. He that believeth on him is not condemned, but he that believeth not is condemned already because he hath not believed. in the name of the only begotten son of God. I think this scripture alone after saying that God so loved the world and so it speaks of this God who just loves the loves the world then all of a sudden someone in that world doesn't believe me he's like oh fine if you're not going to believe in me I'm just going to kill you and that's maybe how we start interpreting in our minds that this that all of a sudden God if his love is rebuff rebuffed he gets angry and he gets vindictive he that believeth on him is not condemned but he that believeth not is condemned already wow They that believe are part of the mystery of the world that God loves. Amen. Amen. They that believe are part of the mystery of the world that God loves. The unbelievers condemned because he's not an object of that love. This is I I know I'm going to say this is the plain English. But some of you might say, I've I've read every translation there is where there and I I've been reading the message. I've been getting into the message Bible so I can get more into the message and listen to the message on SiriusXM and I've never seen it this way. But listen, this is what the scriptur is saying. That he that is condemned, he that believeth not is condemned already. Why? Because he's NOT THE OBJECT OF GOD'S REDEEMING LOVE. THAT'S WHY HE'S CONDEMNED. But they that believe are part of the mystery of the world that God loves. So this is what it leads leads us to. There's two different worlds. The one you think I'm living on and the one you think you're living on. No, the two different worlds. There's a world of love that speaks of redemption. But then there's a world of hate that speaks of condemnation. A world of faith is another way to describe that world. Uh which is the world of love. And a world of unbelief, which is the world that's condemned. So there so the the term world could be used in many different ways. And this is where the translators who translate it are doing their best to kind of catch what God is intending or what the writer intends by it. And I have a complete confidence in the Holy Spirit who wrote the Bible that preserved it to quicken to me the truth and the meaning of it. Not that I need to change any meaning at all. Can it can stay right here in the King James format. I can read in another language. And I just know that God will reveal his truth to his own. Amen. And this term world, we could use it to refer to the earth itself natural, all of humanity and mankind. We could start to think of ways that it might be referring to. But you can use the term world as its use in the scripture to refer to a specific group of people. It's a way of referring to something collectively. And so there's two different worlds that begin to emerge as we look at this. For God so loved the world. This is the world that God loved. But then there's those that are condemned that are part of this condemnation. And the Bible says in 1 John 2:15, just so this could kind of be the first uh uh push to this idea that this world that God loves is a special love for a special world. The Bible tells us, "Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world." If any man love the world, the love of the father is not in him. Believe it's in James 4:4 that says, "Friendship of the world is enmity with God. Therefore, whoever is a friend of the world is an enemy of God. So, it puts this affinity and connection with the world as hatred between God and you. And it says, "Love not the world, neither the things of the world that are in the world. And if any man love the world, the love of the father is not in him." Now, this to me becomes one of these things where it says, "Wait a minute. John 3:16 says, "FOR GOD WHO IS THE FATHER, SO LOVED THE WORLD." AND NOW I'M TOLD THAT I CAN'T LOVE THE world because if I do, THE LOVE OF THE FATHER IS NOT IN ME. When the very red LETTER I READ TELLS ME THAT THE FATHER LOVED THE WORLD AND THAT'S WHY HE SENT HIS SON. THEREFORE, and that represents there there's a contradiction, right? There's a that's a like A BLACK AND WHITE contradiction or red and black. I don't know. I'm getting my my my colors confused. But there's a direct CONTRADICTION TO THE LETTERS ON THIS PAPER. FOR GOD SO LOVED THE WORLD, BUT IF YOU LOVE the world, you don't have the love of God in you. say, "Well, I I need some help here." It's because it's a different world. The world that God loves must be different than the world that we should not love. The world that God loves must be a that must be a SPECIAL KIND OF LOVE. A and and a special kind of world than the world that we ought not to be friends with, than the world that is an enemy to God. A world that that um it produces that hatred between God and itself. Notice how Jesus uh prays in John chapter 17 6 to10. I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world. Thine they were and thou gavest them me and they have kept thy word. So there's love uh is the is operative in choosing the love seized upon them. They keep the word that is the love of God. Now they have known that all things whatsoever thou hast given me are of thee. For I have given unto them the words which thou gavest me, and they received them. Now notice how this kind of marries with John 3:16. For God so loved the world that he that believeth should not perish. The word word has come to them. They've received it and and they have received them and they have known surely that I came out from thee and they have believed that thou did ascend me. I pray for them. I pray not for the world, but for them which thou hast given me. For they are thine, and all mine are thine, and thine are mine, and I am glorified in them. So Jesus did not pray for the whole world. So what it says, for God so loved the world, THAT'S A A DIFFERENT world than the one that Jesus says, I PRAY NOT FOR THE WORLD. HE DID NOT PRAY FOR ALL OF MANKIND or all of humanity. He did not pray for the whole earth or this cosmos, but he prayed for the loved for God so loved the world. There's a mystery of to what that world is. THAT'S THE WORLD THAT GOD LOVED. THAT'S THE WORLD THAT JESUS WAS PRAYING FOR. AND HERE HE SAYS, I PRAY FOR THEM THAT THOU HAS GIVEN ME OUT OF THIS OTHER WORLD. This world of hatred, this world of temporal love, this world of a perverted love. I pray for them. I don't pray FOR THE WORLD. I DON'T PRAY FOR EVERYONE. AND I PRAY specifically for those that thou hast given me. Amen. In 2 Corinthians chapter 5 18 and 19, it says, "And all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation, to it that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them, and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation." Now, I'm using this scripture again to emphasize reconciling the world unto himself. We might think, "Oh, that's all of humanity." And did you know there's branches of theology within Christianity that believe that everyone is going to be saved? That all of humanity, all of mankind, everyone's going to be redeemed, everyone's going to be restored, and everybody's going to live in the love of God and the presence of God. And it's because they take these verses and they say, "Well, the blood of Jesus Christ is efficacious and the blood of Jesus Christ is powerful and he purged all he bought everyone's sins and he paid the price for everyone's sins and therefore having loved the world and reconciled the world to himself. Hey, listen buddy, whether you like it or not, you're just going to be a beautiful eternal Christian over there, right? And they just look at it that way." And and that's that that's the idea um that they have in their minds is that you know all the John Wayne Gasey's and uh Jeffrey Dmers and all those that no matter what they believed and what they did in life and the lack of repentance, they're all just going to be over there saying, "Yeah, didn't expect to be here." Yeah. I don't know. This is good love. THIS IS GREAT. I'M ENJOYING IT. SEEN AN AXE LATELY? [laughter] That's right. But he's talking about the world. I want you to think of the world that he's reconciling. He's reconciling the world unto himself. What world is this? And it's all within this through the ministry of Jesus Christ. HATH RECONCILED US TO HIMSELF BY JESUS CHRIST. NOW, this is love. This is the elective love. And when you see Jesus Christ, I want you to be thinking about THE LOVE OF GOD because brother says Jesus Christ is the love of God. He says Jesus Christ is God's heart. In the first seal, he says that and he says this in different places, a number of different ways. I used to think years ago that maybe God was angry with me, but Christ loved me, right? He says that in a number of places. I thought God was angry with me. And Christ is kind of over THERE SAYING, "WAIT, HOLD ON. STOP." NO, NO, BUT THAT'S NOT THE CASE. CUZ IT'S NOT AN ANGRY GOD WHO'S JUST MAD AT ALL OF US AND mad of all humanity. And Jesus said, "Look, if I die, will that settled it? Will you be happy if I JUST OFF MYSELF?" THAT'S NOT THE THAT'S NOT THE PARADIGM. NO. GOD SO LOVED THAT HE SENT THAT SON. AMEN. And he says, "I used to think God was angry AT ME AND CHRIST LOVED ME." HE SAYS, "BUT CHRIST IS THE VERY HEART OF GOD." So where there where there's a REVELATION OF JESUS CHRIST, THAT'S A REVELATION OF CHARITY. That's the revelation of the heart of God. What's at the very center of God? Now ponder that implication. And so he says that he hath reconciled us to HIMSELF BY JESUS CHRIST, BY HIS LOVE, BY HIS HEART. He has reconciled the world. and think of the two different worlds and we're talking about that world that he loves reconciled the world to himself. Reconciliation means atonement. Something's been atoned for. For there to be reconciliation, it's the restoration of favor. The word speaks of the adjustment of a difference. So where there's been a difference and there's reconciliation, the difference has been accounted for. Like when you which I know we all do, we get out our check ledger, right? We you're doing that, right? You get out your physical check ledger and you write and you're you're going to check the ledger and reconcile everything and reconcile what everything you've done. And when you reconcile, you oh well, I'm off by 40 bucks. No, you find out where the difference is. You find out why. What makes the difference? HOW CAN I RECONCILE THIS expectation from this reality? Where is it wrong? And so, it's the adjustment of the difference to make things line up. So, now this is a this is important as I look at this word reconciliation. For God so loved and this is the very heart of God. The very love of God is Jesus Christ. And so Jesus Christ is the reconciliation or the adjustment of the difference. Perfect love. This is THE NATURE OF PERFECT LOVE. IT WILL ALWAYS REMOVE the barrier between the lover and the loved. AMEN. AMEN. GOD SO LOVED THE WORLD THAT WHEN HE FOUND THE WORLD IN DEFICIT, THIS ONE THAT HE LOVED, HE DIDN'T JUST START OVER WITH A NEW WORLD, BUT HE SAID, "LOVE DOESN'T JUST MOVE ON. Love looks AT THE SITUATIONS. I'VE GOT TO ADJUST THE DIFFERENCE. I'VE GOT TO REMOVE the barrier. I'M THE LOVER. THEY'RE THE LOVE. SOMETHING IS BETWEEN US." AND WHAT MY LOVE WILL DO IS IT WILL NOT GET IMPATIENT. IT WILL NOT GIVE UP. IT WON'T SAY ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. BUT IT'LL FIND THE THING THAT'S CAUSING THE ENMITY IN THE DISAGREEMENT. AND PERFECT LOVE REMOVES THE BARRIER BETWEEN THE LOVER AND THE LOVE. Wherever there's disagreement, wherever there's hate, wherever there's animosity, wherever there's misunderstanding, perfect love says, "I'm not going to give up until we've adjusted the difference." I know there may be times in our lives where we say, "Well, if this is the way that it is, I'll just live with it." But I believe perfect love desires to see the adjustment, the reconciliation, it says in Romans chapter 5:es 8 to10, it says, "For God commendeth his love towards us, he proved it to us in that while we were yet sinners." Now that's at the heart of this. And you think, well, why why why was the writers constantly trying to point us to the prior to the before? So that if I could just maybe interject this that if if it wasn't I think if the scripture wasn't so direct, I'm pretty certain that some of us if at the very least not just at least the neighbors in the apartment next door would think that they had something to do with it, right? Oh yeah, I know why he loves me because I bought into this. I bought into this. I believed it. I accepted it. And that's why he loves me. But he says while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. So his act of sending Christ was not uh there was it was not conditioned upon the fact that now something has happened a and therefore now oh now I'll do it. Like I I had uh I I don't know why I'm sharing this story. I don't know if I've ever shared this publicly, but there was a church that was looking for a pastor and and so they called me and said, "Now, if we were interested in you, would you be interested in us?" I was like, "Are we 17 years old? I mean, are are we passing notes to each other in class?" Cuz I mean, if you liked me, I might like you. I'm like, that's juvenile. That's childish. HOW ABOUT YOU GUYS GROW UP, RIGHT? find a little bit of direction in your life and give me a call when you figure something out. Cuz it was almost as if cuz if you would be interested, I think we might be interested. Ain't ain't the way God did it. God said, "You know what? I love them." And and someone's like them. He's like, "Yeah, them." Like, you do know. Yeah. I DON'T KNOW WHY, BUT I DO. I LOVE HIM. AND SO WHAT I'M GOING TO DO FOR HIM IS I'M GOING TO DIE FOR HIM. THAT'S THAT'S WHAT IT WAS that he he had this great love. WHILE WE WERE YET SINNERS, CHRIST DIED FOR US. NOW MUCH MORE THAN being now justified by his blood. We shall be saved from wrath through him. It's at the very beginning of this chapter. He talks about that we have peace with God. And and even this peace as Paul talks about in Ephesians, IT'S BROKEN DOWN THE MIDDLE wall partition BETWEEN THOSE WHO ONCE HATED EACH OTHER BETWEEN JEW AND GENTILE THAT THE WRATH OF GOD BEING PLACATED of the wrath that was directed TOWARDS US WHO WERE IN SIN THAT'S BEEN ABOLISHED. HE SAYS NOW THERE'S NO MORE HATRED IN THE BODY OF CHRIST BETWEEN JEW AND GENTILE. AMEN. He says, "WHILE WE SINNERS, HE DIED to save us and then that through THAT JUSTIFYING BLOOD, WE'RE SAVED FROM WRATH." AMEN. For while for if when we were sinners, we were reconciled to God by the death of his son. Much more being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life. So much more there I'd like to amplify, but let me just say this. The immity is gone. That whatever whatever was there between God, the lover, and the loved, it's now gone. And we have peace with God. Amen. that there was there was something maybe THAT REQUIRED JUDGMENT. THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN SOMETHING THAT SAID, "WELL, THERE'S THERE has to be condemnation. THIS IS WHAT THE WORD SAYS and this is the circumstance, THIS SITUATION." AND GOD SO LOVED THAT HE SAID, "WELL, I HAVE A LOVE AND IT MUST ADJUST THE DIFFERENCE." This is this is the world that God loved. This is the world that's being reconciled unto himself. This is the world that is not condemned. Remember how in John chapter 1 vers 29 that says the next day John seeth Jesus coming and say behold the lamb of God that takes away the sins of the world. What world was he talking about? Says in John 6:33, for the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven and giveth life unto the world, but not all receive life. It's the world that God loves. It's not all men that are sinless or become sinless. It's not all men that are given life. Would we agree? It's a different world. 2 Thessalonians chapter 2, I'd like I'll start with verse 10. I might stop short, but it says in verse 10, "And with all so talking about the Antichrist spirit at the end time that's deceiving." And notice how his where his power of deception works. And with all deceivleness of unrighteousness in them that perish. Now, we could take John 3:16 and know that for God so loved the world that to them that believe, they're part of the mystery of the world that God loved, they do not perish. And so, there's a group that does perish. All right? And we're doing spiritual math here. Then they're not part of that elective love because they receive not the love of the truth that they might be saved. So those that perish were not the beneficiaries of the love of the truth that they might be saved. And for this cause, God shall send them strong delusion that they should believe a lie. What's the protection from uh the deception? THE LOVE OF THE TRUTH. Being loved by the truth, BEING LOVERS OF the truth, your protection, your inoculation IS THAT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE ELECT TO BE DECEIVED. And that's because the lover's love for the loved. Amen. Amen. The dynamics of his love. He says that THEY SHOULD ALL ALL MIGHT BE DAMNED WHO BELIEVED not the TRUTH BUT HAD PLEASURE IN UNRIGHTEOUSNESS. That's a that's a specific group of people that that refers to groups of people that are going to perish who will be damned and even in the last days be GOD WILL SEND CONFOUND their delusion even more because they don't love truth. Yes. But in verse 13, Paul says, "But we are bound to give thanks always to God for you, brethren, beloved of the Lord." Amen. BECAUSE GOD HATH FROM THE BEGINNING chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth. Do you realize what Paul has done? He said, "There is a group of people who believe not and that those people will perish. because they don't have a love for the truth. They didn't receive it that they might be saved. Says, "And there and then not only are those that believe not the truth, they're going to be damned. But this delusion is going to come on them because they had pleasure in righteousness." And he's describing to people that are ordained to condemnation, that are going to perish, that don't love the truth, that they don't love God, and then before anybody can make any judgments as to why they're any different, HE SAYS, "BUT GOD CHOSE YOU TO NOT BE THAT WAY." That they're going to perish, AND THEY DON'T LOVE THE TRUTH, HE SAYS, "BUT GOD CHOSE YOU FROM THE BEGINNING TO RECEIVE A LOVE OF THE TRUTH THAT YOU MIGHT BE SAVED." BUT BRETHREN, YOU ARE DIFFERENT BECAUSE FROM THE BEGINNING, GOD CHOSE YOU TO SALVATION. HOW? BECAUSE HE CHOSE YOU TO BE SANCTIFIED BY THE SPIRIT THROUGH THE BELIEVING of the truth. Amen. What is it that brother teaches us? The predestinated are the only ones that's in considered in redemption. Redemption is a special thing. Now, when I say redemption, we're not even talking about living eternally, but we're talking about bringing back something. Amen. Predestinate the predestined the only ones considered in redemption. John 12:es 47 to 48. I hope this is things are are kind of lining up together in how that there's these two different worlds. The one that God loves and the one that he doesn't. John 12:es 47 and 48 says, "And if any man hear my words and believe not, I judge him not. For I came not to judge the world, but to save the world. He that rejectth me and receiveth not my words hath one that judgeth him. The word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day. That's why they're going to be judged by Jesus Christ. The word. Amen. So there is a judgment for those who are not the object of elective love. Says, "I come not to judge the world." Now, I think there's almost uh a double meaning in that because his coming does not condemn the world that he loves. Right? But his coming condemns those who reject him. Because he says, "If you reject me, you've got one that'll judge. And it's the words that I spoke. It's my father uh uh who will judge you. It's Jesus. He He'll judge all men by Jesus Christ." So there's a world that is judged, a world that is condemned. This is not the world that God loves. 1 Peter chapter 2:es 4 and 5, just so we could see this uh dichotomy between these worlds. For God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell and delivered them into chains of darkness to be reserved unto judgment. So there's those that are reserved under judgment. As Jude says, for ordained for ordained to condemnation, and spare not the old world that saved Noah, the eighth person, a preacher, the eighth person, a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly. There's an ungodly world. There's an unbelieving world. There's an unelected world. THERE'S A WORLD THAT IT DOES not is not the beneficiaries of this elective love or this specific love where it SAYS FOR GOD SO LOVED THE WORLD. WHAT WORLD WAS he talking about? Not the world of the ungodly. Not the world of the unbeliever. Not the WORLD THAT REJECTS IT. BUT IF I COULD JUST SAY IN PART BECAUSE THERE'S MORE TO IT THAT THERE WERE INDIVIDUALS THAT MADE UP THAT WORLD. INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE PART OF THE MYSTERY OF THAT WORLD. AND THAT'S WHAT GOD LOVED. AMEN. as he said, I come not to judge the world, but to save the world. And there's those that are rever reserved under judgment. And there is a word that will judge them. Paul says in 1 Corinthians 11:32, but when we are judged, we are chasened of the Lord. That we should not be condemned with the world. Two different worlds. A redeemed world and a condemned world. The redeemed world is not beyond chastisement. It is not beyond being judged. But he's saying when we are judged, we are chasened. But when the world is judged, it's condemned. When the WORLD THAT GOD LOVES IS JUDGED, it's corrected. When the world that hates God is judged, it's condemned. WHY? BECAUSE THE LOVER AND THE LOVED, PERFECT LOVE REQUIRES THE REMOVAL OF ANY BARRIER BETWEEN THE LOVER AND THE LOVED. AND SO WHEN GOD CORRECTS, IT'S TO REMOVE BARRIERS. WHEN GOD JUDGES, IT'S TO PROMOTE HARMONY and union AND RESTORATION. THAT GOD'S LOVE FOR THE LOVED REQUIRES REDEMPTION. IT CANNOT CONDEMN. IN OTHER WORDS, THERE'S NO WAY, IF YOU COULD JUST CATCH THE ABSOLUTE OF THIS, THERE'S NO WAY THAT IN GOD LOVING YOU, HE COULD EVER LOVE YOU IN SUCH A WAY TO REJECT YOU. THERE'S NO WAY THAT GOD CAN EVER MANIFEST HIS LOVE TOWARDS YOU THAT WOULD CONDEMN YOU, PUSH YOU AWAY, SEND YOU TO HELL, BANISH YOU FOREVER. THAT'S NOT WHAT PERFECT LOVE CAN DO. It's impossible. When we are judged, it's a function of God's love that is restorative. When we ARE JUDGED, NOW NOTICE I'm I'm clearly making a difference here. And for those who would reject election, reject predestination, uh this sermon hasn't been working well for them from the beginning. But when God's perfect love, when he corrects, WHEN HE JUDGES, when we are judged, HIS JUDGMENT IS A FUNCTION OF PERFECT LOVE THAT IS RESTORATIVE. BUT THEN THE SAME GOD WILL JUDGE THE UNBELIEVER AND IT'S CONDEMNING. BUT WHEN GOD JUDGES ONE HE LOVES, IT'S REMEDIAL. BUT WHEN GOD JUDGES SOMEONE WHO HATES HIM, IT'S PUNISHMENT. It's retribution. Proverbs 3:12, for whom the Lord loveth, he correcteth. Even as a father the son in whom he delightth, the correction is the proof of God's love. As a father punishes a son he loves, so does God. And why? As a father, this is the meaning behind the proverb. As a son would punish a father would punish a son to make him better. Amen. To see that he doesn't make mistakes. To see that he goes the right way. THERE'S JUST A SO much behind that thought that he's expressing that a father who loves his son will correct him. That's what the Bible teaches us. If you love him, you'll correct him. I if there's no correction, there's no discipline. If there's no hard decisions, IF THERE'S NO EFFORT TO TRY TO TRAIN THEM UP IN THE WAY THEY GO, THEN YOU don't really love them. Said, "No, I love them." No, you got the wrong kind of love. You don't really love them. You've got a you've got a a false love. You've got a tainted love. You've got a perverted love. Human love could be very protective of a child, but if you ever join it with the word of God, and you yield to the perfect love, it says, "No, this child needs it." So the Lord loveth whom he correctth. Hebrews 12:6, for whom the Lord loveth, he chastineth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth. So failure to correct, failure to discipline, we can just do that as a takeaway, is a failure of love. It's a failed love. It's the wrong love. So God so loved the world, that world is judged. And when it's judged, it's restored. When it's judged, it's chasened. It's corrected. And so, Revelations 3:19, and we're making such good time. You all are pulling so hard. I'm just breezing through this. You'll be able to make it to the buffet before the line gets long. In Revelations 3:19 says, "As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten. Be zealous, therefore, and repent." Remember how we looked at how the affirmation of love comes before the correction that he affirms his love before he chastens. As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten because there's no condemnation in his love. There's no condemnation. There's no rejection in the s. It's in that moment when the I know I did wrong. I know there's a consequence coming that God wants you to say, "But I love you, so don't worry about it." There's a lesson to be learned here. It's okay. Everything's going to be all right. It only speaks of an opportunity for restoration. He won't leave you as you are. As we read from uh the church age book in church age, to rebuke is to reprove. To reprove is to expose with the view to correction. It's brother Bam drawing from this scripture. Chason does not mean to punish. When the world he loves is chasened, it's for correction. When the world that he does not love is chasened, it's punishment. He says it means to discipline because the subject's amendment is m in mind. Is in mind. So now when you say the subject, the subject of the pun, the discipline, his betterment, his improvement is in mind. But he's ALSO A SUBJECT OF GOD'S LOVE. And that's what gives a basis for the improvement. Because perfect love is going to remove ANY BARRIER BETWEEN THE LOVER AND THE LOVED. It's like, I don't like this disagreement. I don't like this this DIFFERENCE. I DON'T LIKE THESE THINGS THAT ARE IN THE WAY. SO, HE'S GOT TO REMOVE the barriers. With your betterment in mind. That's the purpose of training and correcting, corrective guidance. It's deliberate. It's intentional. As many as I love, I rebuke and chasen. And so, CHASTISEMENT IS NOT CONDEMNATION, RIGHT? But it's correction for your improvement, for your betterment. What is that? A function of the love of God. He's like, I I don't like it that we disagree. I don't like it that things are going this way. I don't I we need to restore this. And so, Brother Brandham in the Smyrnian church a says, and we're bringing back up the quote we've already read maybe a couple times already, but God said that his love was elective love. The proof of his love is election. And notice the phrase he uses that no matter what happened. And he doesn't doesn't go do anything to qualify it to say that no matter what happened prior to 1963. He says that no matter what happened, his love was proven truly by the fact that they were chosen unto salvation. As second Thessalonians put it, that there's those that are going TO PERISH THAT GOD'S going to send a delusion upon. And here's a group of they received not a love of the truth that they can't be saved. They're going to receive a delusion that they're going to be damned. And this is a whole group OF PEOPLE. AND WHAT WE COULD SAY IS, BUT THERE'S ANOTHER group of people that God loves. And so he sends upon them revelation and he manifests his love to him and he quickens them. There's this whole other group of people. He says his love was proven truly by the fact that they were chosen into salvation. RIGHT? THAT NO MATTER WHAT THAT NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENED, IN OTHER WORDS, there's nothing TO FEAR IN GOD'S CHOOSING. There's nothing TO FEAR IN GOD'S LOVE. REMEMBER, it's an elected. You're an elected object. I know maybe you don't like to be objectified, but in these terms, maybe it's okay. But you're an elective object with a predestinated objective. Amen. His love love is elective. A and it has a predestinated objective. It's a has an object AND AN OBJECTIVE. THAT'S WHAT GOD HAS FOR YOU. AND NOTHING'S going to determ that. NO, NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENED, HE CHOSE YOU. NOW, I KNOW THAT THIS this is we we we even those of you who are tremendous Christians and don't make very many mistakes, if any at all, and and and it's and you still realize THAT IT'S VERY HARD TO MAYBE recognize this this impermeable love that it's just it's an absolute because we find that our tastes change, right? There's times when things just aren't the same as they used to be and our likes and dislikes and what we what we desire and we realize, man, things can happen that can change things overnight and this can happen and man this is different and and there's a lot of things that can happen. But brother, no matter what happens and and the fear-mongerers out there and the and manipulators like I wouldn't say it that way, brother Aaron, you could have a mess on your hand like it's not my mess, right? This is what God's wanting to say to you. Amen. that no matter what happened, this is an elective love. As many as I love, as many as I love, stands for the truth that he loves only the many. Amen. Because he says, "As many as I love, I rebuke and chasen. But not all are chasened. Not all are rebuked. Brother Brandham says this when he writes about this verse and remember that when he says as many as I love it it stands for the truth that he loves only the many. That means there's a specific group that this love is to. Says let us examine the first phrase as many as I love. In the Greek the emphasis is upon the personal pronoun I. He does not say as many would feel. He should say as many as love me, right? Because think of all the songs that are being written. I find almost anymore I can almost hardly listen to contemporary Christian music anymore. It almost just turns my stomach because I'm like that is so shallow, right? Uh good thing it has a good baseline to it, right? But there's just things IT'S JUST LIKE AH I DON'T KNOW. I don't know. There's just it it almost turns your stomach because you realize they they're not even using the right language anymore. And so he says as many as love me. That's the way they want it to be. Oh, do you love him? Do you love him? Do you love him? That's not what it says. Belove says we must never try to make Jesus the object of human love in this verse. Really good. So Jesus is not the object. So who is the object? Who's the lover and who's the loved? We must try to NEVER MAKE JESUS THE OBJECT OF HUMAN LOVE IN THIS VERSE. NO, IT IS THE many that are the loved ones of God. Yes, it is his love in question, NOT OURS. HE IS THE LOVER. WE ARE THE LOVE. CAN YOU JUST ACCEPT THAT? HE IS THE LOVER. I AM THE LOVED. SO ONCE AGAIN, WE FIND OURSELVES GLORIFYING IN HIS SALVATION, HIS PURPOSE, AND HIS PLAN. And we are confirmed even more strongly in the truth of THE DOCTRINE OF THE SOVEREIGNTY of God. IT IS THE SOVEREIGNTY OF GOD'S LOVE THAT HE LOVES ME. I AM THE LOVED. HE [screaming] IS THE LOVER. IT IS NOT THAT I LOVED HIM, BUT IT IS THAT HE IS THE LOVER AND I AM THE LOVE. I AM THE OBJECT OF GOD'S LOVE. AMEN. And being the object of an elective love, that means I am eternal because that love can never perish. I am not the object of HIS WRATH. AND WRATH HAVING an end means THAT I WILL HAVE I CANNOT END BECAUSE GOD DOES NOT HATE ME. AMEN. He's an elective lover of an elective love. Amen. Amen. For an elective objective. It's not indiscriminate. I think it just kind of attacks the heart of the the human tendency to take perfect love and make it something it's not. Because we think, "Oh, well, God's so love. God's so love and just love and just love and just love." And what happens is we could we could deviate from the principle of it's not human love. It's God. It's intentional. It will have an object and an objective. And I there's Brother Brandon brings out a great truth in this. And if if you want to go read it, I'll just I'll just kind of summarize it this way, but it's in this church this part of the church age book. We are the loved ones of God. So he is not the object. It is not those that loved him. So this is the way brother Brand brings this out. And you'll just have to go back and read it. And I like just maybe throwing that out there to you all so you'll be like I got to go find this. Where is this? What's the church age book anyhow? Um he says he says that since we are not it's not our love for him. He makes some statements to to tell us that God is not pining for the love of those that don't love him. Other words not as God just God is not just sitting there going, "Man, I just wish the unbelievers would just love me for real." And he's not just looking at the unbelievers and a man I just wish they WOULD LOVE ME. GOD is not waiting complacently kind of sitting over there and a I'm just waiting for those that don't love me to love me. GOD, THAT'S NOT WHAT GOD IS DOING. SO GOD IS NOT THE OBJECT of love. SO HE'S JUST WAITING to be loved. HE'S JUST WAITING to be loved and waiting to be loved. No, he's a lover. And there's a loved whether they love him or not or whether they know it or not. He's a lover. They're the love. THEY'RE HIS OBJECTIVE. THEY'RE ON HIS RADAR, RIGHT? He He's the ONE THAT'S BEEN STALKING YOU, RIGHT? HE'S THE ONE THAT'S BEEN FOLLOWING YOU. HE'S THE ONE THAT'S BEEN YEAH, I KNOW EXACTLY WHO THEY ARE. HE HE'S FOLLOWING YOU, RIGHT? He's paying attention to you. AND HERE HE IS WITH AN ELECTIVE LOVE FOR YOU. IT'S NOT YOUR LOVE FOR HIM. SO, IT TELLS US THAT GOD IS NOT SITTING BACK WAITING TO BE LOVED. HE'S NOT WAITING FOR THOSE WHO DON'T BELIEVE HIM TO BELIEVE IN HIM. HE'S A LOVER WITH A LOVE THAT HAS AN OBJECTIVE. AMEN. And he says in Ephesians 1:es 4-6, according to as he hath chosen us in him BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD, THAT WE SHOULD BE holy and without blame before him. In love, WHAT DOES ISAIAH SAY? IN LOVE FOR MY SOUL, HE CAST ALL THY SINS BEHIND MY BACK. IN LOVE, HAVING PREDESTINED us under the adoption of children by Jesus Christ himself, according to the good pleasure of his will. Yes. Amen. To the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in there it is again the beloved. We are chosen in the beloved one. Beloved means worthy of love, highly favored. But he says that has made us accepted which means to be pursued. I know I know when you read it it kind of it makes it seem that that we're accepted, right? Right? So, we kind of present ourselves and we're we're sliding into his DMs and saying, "Hey, I I I have you noticed me, but that's not that's not how it works, right? The the the what's happening is that we are the pursued." Was it Brother said you never sought God, right? He pursued us. It's not it's his love for us. It's his passion for us. And so, IT SAYS WE'VE BEEN CHOSEN. It means we've been pursued with grace. He has made US ACCEPTED. IN OTHER WORDS, HE'S MADE US WORTHY. LISTEN, his love for us has MADE US AN OBJECT OF HIS PURSUIT. [applause] I MAYBE I'M JUST BORROWING A LOT OF PHRASES SO THE YOUNG PEOPLE CAN GET IT, BUT HE'S INFATUATED WITH YOU. That this IS AN THIS IS SOMETHING I MUST HAVE. THIS IS SOMETHING I KNOW I WANT. THIS IS A PERFECT LOVE. AND I'M NOT JUST GOING TO FORCE HIM TO LOVE ME. I'M NOT JUST GOING TO MANIPULATE IT. BUT HE HAS AN UNRELENTING STUBBORN GRACE AND A LOVE FOR YOU. AND YOU SAY, "WELL, EXPLAIN IT, GOD. I DON'T KNOW WHY, BUT I LOVE HIM." AMEN. AND HE'S MADE US ACCEPTED. HE'S PURSUED US WITH GRACE. HIS LOVE. HE IS A LOVER OF A LOVED AND HE'S PURSUED US WITH THAT LOVE. AMEN. And that's who he pursues. He's not out knocking on the doors of all those that don't love him. He's not out there knocking on the doors of the unbelievers, but there's an elected out there that he's pursuing. Amen. This is what brother Bradam uses to to support that principle that God's not just sitting back waiting for those who don't love him. Amen. But he says in Romans 9, he quotes from this Romans chapter 9 11-13 and speaking of the seed of Abraham in God's sovereign election. So this is the sovereignty of God. We're confirmed even more strong in the truth of the doctrine of the sovereignty of God's love. I added there the sovereignty of God's love part says for the children being not yet born neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of God according to election might stand not of works but of him that calleth and he he he says this before he mentions it was said unto her the elder shall serve the younger as it is written Jacob have I loved but Esau have I hated This is this is God's words. It said in Malachi, Paul brings it forward here that Jacob I love. I love Jacob. I hate Esau. Brother Baron says this is elective love. The church book this is elective love. It is his love for his elect. So Jacob was chosen. Esau wasn't. Right? Jacob was accepted. Esau wasn't. Jacob was pursued. Esau wasn't. Jacob was chosen for a calling. Esau wasn't. And even if you look at the story, there's one. You'd think, well, we know who Isaac loves, and we know he's the this is his the one he loves, and the mother loves the other one. It's like, well, you got mama's boy, you got daddy's boy. I mean, let's just look at the the way that this should work out. But yet, it was God's choosing. He says, "This is elective love. It is love for his elect and his love for them is apart from human merit. It's apart from human merit. Doesn't say anything about divine merit but apart from human merit. For it says that the purpose of God stands in election WHICH IS EXACTLY OPPOSITE to works or anything man has in himself. This is elective love apart from human merit. That God says I love Jacob. I hate Esau. Jacob was a deceiver. the hill grabber before he was a prince. He was a mama's boy. Got the birthright through deception because he knew how to cook. Right? Obviously, Esau didn't love food in the way that some of us love food, but loved it in ways that others do. He was a shyer. So, if you look at the if you look at the kind of the pedigree, firstborn, man's man, right? daddy's boy. And you start looking at all the laws of the first board. You start looking at everything. It says, "Esau, it's got to be Esau." Yet, God loved Jacob, the mama's boy, the shyer, the scaredy-cat. You name it over and over and over again. And if you had time to look at Esau's life from a natural perspective, he was more blessed than Jacob. you just look at look at from a natural perspective say that despite the wording of the scripture but as as we looked at it from A HUMAN PERSPECTIVE SAY WELL IT SURE LOOKS LIKE Esau's the one that's been firmly planted he's the one that's got wealth and resources he's the one that's got strength even to the point where Jacob is afraid of him and and here's Esau living his best life and Jacob's hated now come on you start to really think about this well well Jacob I've loved and Esau I've hated him like yeah I bet Esau really got it didn't he RIGHT BUT LOOK AT JACOB AND HIS LIFE. HE HAD MORE DISAPPOINTMENTS. He battled MORE WITH FEAR. HE DEALT MORE WITH GRIEF AND LOSS AND CALAMITIES AND DECEPTION. JACOB HAD A MUCH MORE DIFFICULT TIME AS WE READ IT IN THE SCRIPTURE. SO WHEN WE READ THAT JACOB I'VE LOVED AND ESAU I'VE HATED, GOD'S LOVE FOR JACOB IS MANIFESTED IN ACCEPTING JACOB FOR A HIGHER CALLING. IT IT'S MANIFESTED IN CHOOSING JACOB for a greater position. And and it DIDN'T ALL HAVE TO MATCH UP NATURALLY. IT DIDN'T HAVE TO ALL LINE UP WITH CERTAIN UH MILESTONES AND WEALTH AND RICHES AND AND AND BEING ABLE TO GET THE GIRL YOU LOVE WHEN YOU FIRST MEET HER. IT WASN'T ALWAYS WORKING OUT THE WAY THAT WE THOUGHT IT WOULD. AND SO GOD'S LOVE FOR JACOB WAS MANIFESTED IN THAT HE CHOSE HIM TO BE THE PATRIARCH. IT'S MANIFESTED FOR JACOB THAT HE CHOSE TO REVEAL HIMSELF TO him so that he could say, "Jacob, I know your tribulation. I know your poverty. I know your difficulties, but you are rich. Amen. And how is God's hatred expressed to Esau? Not in depriving him of all the wealth and comforts that life could afford, but by rejecting him. That's how hatred was manifested. We think for sure that hatred means, "Yep, it's going to blow up. Yep, going to be scandal. It's going to end in ruin. Yep, it's going to come to find out Esau is this." And no, he can continue on and be blessed. But the hatred is manifest in rejecting, finding him unfit for God's purpose to have a patriarch. And that's why brother Brandham says, "The cloudy skies and storms of life are no signs of God's disapproval." Because Jacob is over there fighting in the storms of life. And he says, "Neither are the bright skies and still waters the signs of his love and approval." Because there's Esau and joining the bright skies and the still waters. He says his approval of any of us is only in the beloved. His love is elective which he had for us before the foundation of the world. For before he even formed the world, he loved the world. And you're part of that mystery. For God so loved. Please stand with me today. Thank you for your attention. musicians you come please. My prayer is that you understand better to know and trust the love that God has for us. It says, "For God so loved the world, the world that he loved is a special world. It's a world that he never stops loving. It's a world that he does not condemn, but it's a world that his elective love restores. You're a part of that world. We have known and believed. So, let's just trust. So, we bow [music] our heads today, grateful for the visitors that we have amongst us. So thankful that we could be together today. [music] If you have a need, just lift it up before him. Say, "Lord, here's my need. Here's my prayer." Let's bow [music] our heads together. Gracious heavenly father, I think each one of us could say that we never tire of talking about your love. [music] There's aspects, Lord, I think that are challenging. There's pictures that sometimes we [music] can't always fully understand. There's paths we've taken in life and hurts and rejections that we've suffered and heartaches, disappointments. Lord, we're even right now facing things that defy explanation. We as even the prophet alluded to say how can I be a subject of God's love and go through this and Lord maybe there is [music] no explanation that we could come up with that would satisfy it but just as brother Brandham was able to one day [music] say I know now I didn't know then but I know now perhaps Lord one day we'll understand it better by and Right. But in the meantime, I've seen enough to know that I can trust you. I've experienced enough to know that I can trust you. And Lord, I recognize that many of the hurts and rejections and [music] the separations and estrangements and the loss that I've suffered in this life, it has been because of the Jacob in me. It's been by my own hands, by my own works. by my own rebellion and stubbornness. In that way, Lord, it's been my own perverted love that's brought me pain. Lord, I realize there's times in my life where perhaps I'm not the main actor and I'm not the one who's to a greater proportion responsible, but I have been hurt. I have been offended. I have been rejected. I have experienced loss, severe pain, and tribulation at the hands of those who loved imperfectly. And perhaps we could say, "It's been a perverted love. But through it all, your perfect love has walked out over me." And said, "I know you, Aaron, and I'll never let you be ruined. Never let you be destroyed. Though you may bow at times under the weight of scars and complexes, and though you may hurt at times with the pain that is overwhelming, my love knows when to say enough is enough. And I'll use every tear. I'll use every knot. [music] I'll use every shadow. And I'll use every scar for my glory. And you will come to know my love in a perfect way. and you'll come to trust me and know that I am not abusive and manipulative and know that all along I even believed in you. So I would let you wonder. I'd let you stray [music] knowing that in the end love would win. And Lord, when I see how much you love me, [music] I realize that the most significant thing in my life is to be an object of your love. You are the lover and I'm the loved and I accept it. And I know it seems so insufficient to say, "I love you back." But Jesus, I love you. I love you. I love you, Lord. I do. And Lord, I sense that that pleases you. And it's [music] what you want to hear. Father, may the heavens rejoice today as your lost ones come home. May your heart rejoice today when the objects of your love turn their face [music] towards you. LORD, YOU'RE NOT PINING for the attention from a world. You're not longing for the affection of a world, but you ARE LOOKING TO US, THE WORLD THAT YOU love to turn our hearts to you. And in their two omnipotent meet, bless us today. I believe you're healing hearts right now. I believe you're giving hope for restoration, Lord. And I believe that there'll even be those who might after the fact listen to a prayer that was prayed in the past and it'll speak to their heart that God is restoring because that's what [music] perfect love does. That no matter what's happened, decades, years, [music] comingings and goings, say, "Here I am, Lord. I'm I'm here not not for you to receive me, but you already made me worthy of pursuit and I'm done running from you, [music] Lord. You chased me down with the jealous love and I'm done running. Lord, I'm thinking about Jacob. Whole time he was wrestling with you, your heart was beating. Don't let me go. Don't let me go, FATHER. I GRAB BACK AND I HOLD ON to you with all that is in me. And I say, Jesus, I love you. AND I WANT TO STAY FAITHFUL to you, Lord. I WANT TO SERVE YOU WITH ALL THAT IS IN ME. No matter what comes and what goes, no matter what tomorrow holds, Lord, I I want to I want all I want all my heart to love you. Not just a part of it is enough. I want all my heart to love you. And Lord, in turn, I want this for my children. I want it for my beautiful wife. I want it for [music] the brothers and sisters of this church. I want it for my neighbor. I want to be so secure in your love that I don't love with the perverted love anymore. Amen. Help us, Father. I pray I commit the people to you. In the name of Lord Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. Amen. Such a sweet [music] presence amongst us.
