TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Colossians chapter 3:1 I'd like to read to verse 17 it's lengthy but I think it's good to get this first part in these first nine verses before we get to verses 10 to1 17 if ye then be risen with Christ seek those things which are above where Christ sth on the right hand of God set your affection on things above not on things on the earth for ye are dead and your life is hid with Christ in God when Christ who is our life shall appear then shall you also appear with him in glory mortify Therefore your members which are upon the Earth fornication uncleanness inordinate affection evil concupisent and covetousness which is idolatry for which thing sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience in the which he also walked sometime when you lived in them but now ye also put off all these anger wrath malice blasphemy filthy communication out of your mouth lie not one to another seeing that you have put off the old man with his deeds and have put on the new man which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him where there is neither Greek nor Jew circumcision nor uncircumcision Barbarian cyan Bond nor free but Christ is all and in all put on therefore as the elect of God holy and beloved bowels of mercies kindness humbleness of Mind meekness longsuffering forbearing one another and forgiving one another If any man have a quarrel against any even as Christ forgave you so also do ye and above all these put on charity which is the bond of perfectness and let the peace of God rule in your hearts to the which ye Al also ye are called in one body and be thankful let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another in Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing with Grace in your hearts to the Lord in whatsoever ye do in word or deed do all whatsoever you do in word or deed do all in the name of the Lord Jesus giving thanks to God and the father by him amen you can take your seats I know that's lengthy there's a lot of tremendous principles in there that hopefully will come uh can stick with you even as we go further tonight and we'll go as have a lot to get to but we'll just go as far as the Lord would allow us to my title is indicated on this slide it's my native code might seem a little bit odd my native code but we're continuing our examination of fashion and clothing and actually God's attitude towards it how he views um our external dressing or how we present ourselves through our clothing and our jewelry our ornaments and kind of tie this back into to last Wednesday night we spoke on dress codes and we you're looking how that there are set of rules or dress code is a set of rules that specify a required garment or a required clothing uh could be just some customary style of dress for a particular occasion or for a specific activity or even a specific group of people that there's a dress code that they have to accommodate and we used code as a system of words or letters or figures or maybe even symbols to convey meaning and to identify something so a code is some way of identifying something or a code is a way of conveying meaning and we looked at it from the standpoint that how a person dresses or their attire forms a code that signifies their identity it conveys meaning it has some substance to it and I would even say that our dress is a language it speaks and it says something even before we would open our mouths so we looked at the scripture on Sunday we saw different instances where a particular attire is already speaking and calling out and conveying character and that one can dress in a way that signals and speaks and draws someone's attention so when we look at it from this standpoint of my native code or my native code and looking at it from the standpoint of a dress code and how uh what you wear is a language I say my native code because I want you to think of it in terms of something very personal something that is native to you therefore it's intimate it's natural it's some sort of inborn identity or you could say your native tongue or your native dress and I'm wanting to present it this way my think about for yourself what is your native language what is your native tongue what's your native code and specifically the way we dress should reflect our our divine origin in Christ being born again or our Heavenly destiny that place that we believe that God is leading us to and if you look at Colossians chapter 3 we'll start with verses 8 and N I think this is a good place to start cuz I'm wanting to again continue on the idea of the principle of how we dress matters to God it says but now ye also put off all these as it says that we have we're to mortify our members which are upon the Earth and it list fornication uncleanness inordinate affection uh and those different things it says for the wrath of God is revealed against those who do such things he says but now ye also put on off all these and here it gets really serious anger wrath malice blasphemy filthy communication out of your mouth lie not one to another seeing that you have put off the old man with his deeds so uses this language put off all these and it lists them and that word there means to lay aside or cast off and as or to lay apart to lay aside from you seeing that you have put off and that means to be wholly stripped off and it's using a lang language of taking something off that you were previously wearing so put off anger and wrath and Malice and filthy communication and blasphemy sins that you have wholly stripped off and completely taken off the old man with his deeds so Colossians is using a a language of taking off one garment or one particular form of attire and and it's using it as a garment that's reflective of your worldly origin why is it we would lie why is it that we would have wrath or mal or or even do these other things the Bible's mentioning that's all because we're human uh humans make mistakes humans do these things but having been born again you're to put off the old man his his attire his his garments and it's using a language of changing clothes in Acts 7:58 it says cast him out of the city and they speaking of Stephen they cast him out of the city and stoned him and the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man's feet whose name was Saul not trying to look at the stoniness Steven necessarily but this phrase they laid down their clothes it's the same verb put off the old all these it's to lay them down and when they laid down their clothes it means they took something off and set it aside if they had a cloak they had a garment that would impede them in casting Stones they laid down their clothes at the feet of Saul so notice the language that's being used in Colossians 3 and I it may seem like man you're just really building this up it's very simple just want you to catch how the scripture is using a language of of changing your attire or your garments in the scri in the scriptures about putting off the old man then in verse 10 it says and having put off all these and put off the old man with his deeds it says and have put on the new man this word there to be put on it means to be clothed with to sink into as as such as clothing to put on or to clothe oneself I think it may even be just uh translated to AR raay in so what's it saying it's taking off an old garment put in on a new garment changing your outfit changing the way you appear changing the way you look now we recognize he's speaking spiritual things cuz he says put on the new man which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him where there is neither Greek nor Jew I think this is very important Greek nor Jew circumcision nor uncircumcision Barbarian cyan Bond nor free but Christ is all and in all I I want to come back to that but notice Paul talking about taking off an old man you've you've put off the old man with his deeds you're putting on a new man and now with this new identity and this new origin he's saying there's not a Greek or Jew circumcision or UNC circumcision Barbarian cyan but he says Christ is all and in all so now referring to everyone regardless of their natural origin put on sink into such as clothing and be clothe yourself with put on therefore as the elect of God holy and beloved put on clothe yourself with bowels of mercies kindness humbleness of Mind meekness longsuffering forbearing one another and forgiving one another If any man have a quarrel against any even as Christ forgave you so also do ye in order to do these things in order to forgive in order to forbear you've got to take off the old garments of anger wrath and Malice and filthy communication and lying one to another and put on these garments of mercies and kindness and humbleness of Mind meekness and suffering if you're not if you're not wearing that attire you're not going to be able to perform the function you catching this in the scripture saying put off the old man with his anger and put on a a new man who's kind now we realize it's it's not that we go and we actually have a shirt and this is my Angry shirt and I I know some of us might have their favorite shirt and when you're going to go do something you got to put on your favorite shirt because you need confidence and sometimes fishermen have their favorite hat or you have your power tie that you wear to certain meetings and maybe things you like to wear when you think this really makes me look good well that's just an example maybe of what God is pointing out that there's a way that you can dress for the occasion for the circumstance and that you put on these things and in verse 14 it kind of amps it up a little bit and above all these put on clothe yourself with be arrayed in charity which is the bond of perfectness the Bible using this word to be clothed with kindness and mercy and humbleness of Mind meekness and longsuffering uffing and above all let this be your garment this Garment of Charity to further substantiate that this is the language that's used of taking clothes off and putting new clothes on Luke 12:22 he said un the disciples therefore I say unto you take no thought for your life what you shall eat neither for the body what you shall put on what you're going to clothe yourself with what you're going to be covered with in terms of garment it's the same thing when he says put on charity put on the new man put on therefore Mercy kindness humbleness of mind it's the same word that she used when he talks about actually clothing your natural body in Revelations 1:13 seeing him in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks he's described as one like unto the son of man clothe that's put on clothed with a garment down to the foot and G about the paps with a golden girdle this is a a language in Colossians 3 of how you dress and Paul says it's uh where in this new man there is neither grief nor Jew and it says or Barbarian or cian in other words there are cultural differences that will exist for those who are born again there'll be different origins in terms of their ethnicity and they will still exist but Christ is all all and in all whether Barbarian formerly Barbarian whether cian whether Greek or Jew that Christ is in all of them and in all of them regardless of their uh original ethnic back background or cultural background we all are to put on the new man renewed in knowledge after the image of Christ and as the elect of God all of us regardless of where we live in the world there is something we can put on that is the same Mercy kindness humbleness of Mind meekness longsuffering and charity now the uh something I want you to essentially take away from this is there's a way that we may look as Americans and there might be a way that we would be modest As Americans and that would differ than maybe how somebody in Vietnam would look in their modesty and how they honor the Lord but you couldn't have an excuse that well we're Americans were just angry right we couldn't just say well we're Americans we're we just kind of have a tendency to uh to uh jealousy no we all of us regardless of our ethnicity regardless of our origin of birth we ought to have these characteristics that we clothe ourselves could you imagine someone being Irish and using that as an excuse to continue to get drunk which they say the difference between an Irish wedding and an Irish funeral is one less drunk and we couldn't use that as an excuse regardless of family history regardless of what our genetic disposition might be we are to put on these things all should dress themselves in this attire of Christ and saying there's some symbolic nature clothing they say well uh if you could just imagine what it would mean to take off an old garment and put on a new one Paul's saying take off the old man in all his deeds and put on a new man and so it's using this it's speaking that there's something symbolic in getting dressed to me this is very very important to think about these terms put on garments that reflect your new spiritual identity in Jesus Christ now and to take some more time just to look at this and I feel that it's important to do so with you on a Wednesday night being students of the word loving the Bible and just listening to the message of the hour these things will just connect really well and then you can be an effective witness to others to your children with uh not that I'm going to give you a better understanding but hopefully these things will just continue to add to your understanding clothing in the Bible is a is used as a powerful tool to create imagery it is something we've already looked at so I'll just use some familiar scriptures and this the wearing of a garment is used as a figure of speech we've already kind of seen this already put on the new man clothe yourself with a new man so it's used as even a figure of speech in Psalms 35: 26 let them be ashamed and brought to confusion together that Rejoice at my hurt some of you are saying I'm going to memorize that let them be ashamed and brought to confusion together that rejoice it m hurt let them be clothed with shame sh and dishonor that magnify themselves against me saying let them be clothed with shame and dishonor he's using this language of them being dressed with this defeat and failure let them be clothed with it let it be their attire let it be what they're wearing we've already seen in Isaiah 521 where it says put on thy beautiful garments that is symbolic of greatness how we saw in Isaiah 59:17 where he wear garments of Vengeance that is symbolic of Revenge you have beautiful garments and you have garments of Vengeance they're symbolic we saw how in Isaiah 61:10 there was garments of Salvation which is this metaphor of Victory but then also it's used in Psalms 1329 that the priests are to be clothed with righteousness it's a metaphor for justice Bible using clothing to create an image using it as a figurative language a figure of speech and if we look closely at a number of different scriptures a manner of dress carries this um a great symbolic and spiritual weight in the Bible it's used to signify someone's social standing or even their spiritual standing and it becomes a visual identification of who they are a visual marker of identity there's a number of scriptures we could use where clothing uh in the in Bible stories is telling us what their role of someone has or their personality or what's accepted one particular scripture in 2 Kings 25: 29 it speaks of this King now who had been imprisoned and they changed his prison garments and he did eat bread continually before him all the days of his life he was wearing garments that identified him as a prisoner this we do the same thing in our society today that when one goes to prison or Goes to Jail they put garments on them that identify them as a ward of the state they're under the control and the authority of the state even uniforms whether it be in a gel setting or even at school and some of them some people probably think they're exact same thing but uniforms are used to remove differences and if everyone's wearing the same thing you lose your individuality and you lose your Independence and it's for reason when you go to the military you get rid of all your personal possessions essentially you're going to dress a certain way everyone's going to have the same boots even give all the men the same haircut and everyone's to conform and it's for reason think of it this way there's a power to the way you dress there's a power to the way you look and by homogenizing everyone it takes away from them certain differences uh they're less individualistic they there's less Independence all through what you wear and here this his prison garments were changed in know there's garments that indicate bondage garments that indicated a person was subject to something else and not a free person we saw in Esther 6:8 that there was Royal apparel that Mori was dressed in saw in Zechariah 13:4 that there was a a hairy garment or a hairy mantle that spoke of a prophet or a Nazarite and Genesis 38 we saw that there was garments of widowhood these garments of mourning Exodus 28:2 it says Thou shalt make holy garments for Aaron thy brother for Glory and for beauty I now that I'm reading this I don't know why I never used this against my brothers well they probably would have just cut holes in my pants but make holy garments for Aaron thy brother for Glory and for beauty he reading where there's dozens of verses that speak to the clothing for the high priest it's not just make sure your ankles are covered but it's so precise and so detailed make holy garments for the high priest for what for Glory and Beauty we can say that clothes make a person and we recognize this that we judge people very quickly by what they're wearing when you go to an interview you dress a particular way sometimes even today you need to know the person you're meeting with and what their expectations are I know for myself as a lawyer that if I was going to meet uh maybe somebody else younger than me a client younger than me I may not have the pressure to wear a tie because they don't me expect a lawyer to but if I was meeting with somebody older than me they have an expectation wearing a suit wearing a tie cuz that's how a lawyer should dress and if you're not dressed the right right way or you don't represent yourself and present yourself with the way you dress the right way people can make judgments about you and so the clothes make a person may not mean that you can just put on a jersey and become a football player but the role in which the person is serving the position they have their standing is indicated by what they wear Luke chapter 15 ver 22 we're doing fantastic for time so uh uh if I am going fast I I don't mean to so thank you for staying with me but in the story of The Prodigal Son as we use that to identify it the son who is an heir told his father give me my portion I want to use it now he goes He spins all of it in riotous living and then having completely spent everything he owned he becomes a slave in a foreign country and he comes to himself he says my father has servants and uh and they don't beg and I'm going to go back to my father and when he comes back it says but the father said to his servants now think of this disobedient son who's come back bring forth the best robe and put it on him and put a ring on his hand and shoes on his feet if you could just for a moment allow yourself to imagine what's taking place this transformation of this prodal coming out of sin and out of rebellion and coming back to the father is represented by the father removing Any Garment that he had had on at the time of his coming back Any Garment that would indicate his servitude anything that would be a Remnant or the the vesage of slavery there was a a a ring in his ear he removed it if there was anything on him from this foreign country he removes all of it and he clothes him in the best robe he puts on a ring on his hand and shoes on his feet and he would have been wearing garments that indicated that he had become impoverished he would have been wearing something that indicated that he was a poor person that he didn't have any worth he didn't have any value would have probably been wearing a servant's garments if not a prison garment as verse 15 said he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country and he sent him into the fields to feed swine probably would have been wearing something appropriate for a swine feeder would have been wearing something that would have indicated that he was a slave to a citizen of a foreign country they might have had something that he wore that indicated to everyone else this person is my uh uh uh Chanel this is something that I own this painting here by Rembrant of the prodal returning to the father you could just see his tattered garments and his shoes without soles and he looks completely destitute the father says I want to wash you up I want to take off these old garments that are stained that are tattered maybe just some Patchwork maybe things he put together whatever it might have been these things that stink and smell of this foreign country and the slop of these Pig pins I want to take all them off and not just put a robe on you but the best robe and not just change these outer garments but I want to put a ring on your hand to signify that I have received you that you're my son and I also want to put shoes on your feet he was taking care to make sure that in every way the Eternal forgiveness and love of the father that was being projected to his son he could wear as garments to indicate he's been received back into the family he's loved he's mine I I I'll get rid of all these garments that may remind him of his past and so clothing is used of spiritual character it's symbolic Colossians 3 speaks to that we also see these other places where let them be clothed with shame and these garments of Vengeance or beauty or Justice or Victory it's used to speak of spiritual circumstance spiritual character it's symbolic now this is my simple point if clothing is used that much to represent something of spiritual character and symbolize something of spiritual origin our physical clothing does the exact same thing how else could you have garments of Vengeance unless there was something that would indicate perhaps you're angry how else could you put on beautiful garments unless there was something that would signify royalty and power otherwise it' just be like well this language doesn't have any meaning anymore if this isn't the actual truth that your physical garment speaks of something what you actually wear is speaking a language it's conveying meaning if you saw me with baseball spikes on and tight baseball pants and a baseball jersey on you would probably just assume for my own sanity sake that I was going to play baseball by the by virtue of what I am wearing so clothing will serve as a visual expression of one's identity it'll identify even one's things that value or even their social standing in this picture here on the right you have rembrance uh the night watch rather large painting as a family we were able to see this in the Reich Museum in Amsterdam it's a giant painting it's maybe difficult to see here but on on to your right these characters are dressed in all sorts of different garments that would indicate special status and position and it within the guard and ones that would belong to H maybe a certain group and others and they even see the children dressed in a very very fanciful way and just looking at them you would know these people are important and the people to the left are not the ones that the night watches guarding over these are The Potato Eaters these are just simple potato Farmers painted by Van go one of his most popular paintings and they're uh just in the light of an oil lamp and they're eating and they almost seem very earthy they almost seem like potatoes themselves and they're sitting there just pouring some tea and eating potatoes they're humble they're would be impoverished especially compared to this other social class here you have a painting of the a boy in blue and I kind of cropped it where you can't see his fanciful shoes uh but this is a very fine garment this young man is clearly wealthy this may look like just some sort of costume show but they couldn't afford costume shows back then I mean Amazon Prime by the time this service is over we could all be dressed like this for 15 bucks or if we can get it on team earlier that we could have 500 people dressed for 15 bucks but now here this is another van go portrait of a of just a a young man who's not very wealthy a commoner just a a a potato farmer maybe himself and you can see it just even by the way they're dressed links are gone to the paint to where it would look as if the maybe the the man on the left is little bit dirty and and his clothes aren't real clean but you would never mistake the one on the right is a potato farmer here another I can't remember who painted the the nice Cavalier here but what are all these things trying to show us through his upturned mustache his hat his collar so nice his Sash and all these colors he's someone of importance as you would look even down to what he is wearing it would signify I I I have a horse and I have this sword and I have these things this is someone of a particular status whereas the man on the right is just an old poor man a common man kind of people that van go could afford to sit for a painting what are these things teaching us or maybe not teaching us but reminding us what someone wears tells us their social class what someone wears can tell us where they're from or what they value or maybe how much money we think they have in a story on uh Google's art and culture uh product or I don't know what necessarily you call it but in one of their stories they make this statement we what we wear is more than just material sewn together to protect us our clothes are a signifier of our identity and culture I do not believe that this would be a controversial statement to make what we wear is more than just material sewn together to protect us I find in the Bible that clothing was either ref refed in sense of uh protection from for warmth or protection of elements or in some sense of modesty or to indicate someone's stature and so scripturally these things would hold true what we wear is more than just material sewn together to cover up our elbows or to protect us from uh the cold but it signifies our identity signifies something about our culture whether it be something that is innate within us by birth but then also those environmental cult uh influences that shape Who We Are this isn't a reach I know that you're going to understand this and I'll just provide a few examples uh to substantiate this but the garments that we wear can symbolize our national identity can actually disclose one's native origin you could just look at these and know by what they're wearing that they're they are from two different cultures you may be looking at say from here but there I can't even tell what I'm looking at and you may not even be able to identify if the woman on the right is is Native American if it's Navajo if the one on the left is from Eastern Europe and you may not be able to identify it yourself just looking but for those who know they could look at this and say oh clearly I I know what that is this is an important symbol to this culture someone who uh maybe has this is familiar with this dress they look at say oh I know right away that that's from this particular region this part of the part of a country the same for these you may say they're all the same there's a blouse there's a hat this there there there's this a girdle there's an apron they may all look the same but to someone with perception or someone with knowledge and say these are entirely different cultures and it's all signified by how someone dresses I think the one on the right is not you know anatomically correct it's don't know of a woman with four arms but this the the native Garb this is a very faint uh famous painting or fainting if you're losing time but it's a very famous painting that someone recognize these are garments that are particular to someone in India or Hindi religion they say this is something that would signify something special may see uh a a dress on the left someone who knows these things with say I know exactly what that is I know what region that's from and we can certainly get lost in the Weeds on all the different dresses and all the different ways that people could dress and all the different pieces of art that convey it but what I want you to recognize is just the way someone dresses can tell you whether or not they're from Japan or at least trying to convey them they are or whether they not they're from a Nordic country just by the way that they dress the manner of dress can be reflective of in each one of these instances the type of work that the women were expected to perform we could show you many more in terms of men how they dress that it would identify maybe their daily activities some of them would tell you about their climate you look at say oh it must be really cold where they live and it would signify perhaps their social status all all these things conveyed simply by what you wear and in 1 Peter 1: 13 to 16 if we could now just transition a little bit further into the word he says wherefore gir up the loins of your mind there's a reason for doing this be sober and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ to gir up the loins of your mind is even a reference to some sort of adjustment to your clothing to GD up the loin of your mind as one would uh uh gird up their loins or gird up their robe in order to run and to be Fleet of foot and to not be hindered in their movement he's now using this analogy to us to Girt up the loins of our minds and this analogy continues as he says as obedient children not fashioning yourselves according to the former lust in your ignorance these things that we read of before in Colossians 3 we did them in our ignorance in our blindness in the nature of our first birth but now that we are born again we have a different fashion but as he which hath called you is Holy so be ye holy and all manner of conversation manner of Life all manner of conversation that would pertain to even how that you present yourself physically because it is written be ye holy for I am Holy these are scriptures that we've already examined to Great length and even attached to other scriptures and identified just how consistently we are called to this Holiness he comes back to the very same theme in the next chapter chapter 2:9 but you are a chosen generation a royal priesthood I'm identifying these scriptures on the hills of showing how that clothing can identify someone's identity their social standing and even how garments will symbolize national identity or what one identifies thems with I don't know when St Patrick's Day is and that may you know put me in Bad Company maybe I should know this uh but what do people want who are Irish want to be identified with it or and then really I guess everybody does everybody claims to be Irish on that day but there's a certain way that people want to addess and act to signify and to show this is where I'm from this is my Heritage and here it says that we are a holy nation A peculiar people a unique people that you should show forth the Praises of him who have called you out of Darkness Into His Marvelous Light we have a we are of a different generation we are of a royal priesthood we are A peculiar people and he says a holy nation in other words we have a spiritual citizenship in a different country a different Kingdom we are of a different Nation it's a new Nativity whereas when you have and I know a lot of these distinctions are removed in terms of today's Commerce and the way that fashion and those things work a lot of these distinctions may be removed but there's still things that would ify and I guess where we see it the most is when you break the rules of cultural appropriation and everyone calls you out for doing something that you shouldn't be doing but there's still these ideas that these things belong to a particular identity and when you're born again you have a new Nativity you have a new divine origin called out of Darkness Into His Marvelous Light Romans chap 13: 112 13 and 14 and that knowing the time that now is high time to awake out of sleep that means take off your pajamas put on some clothes it's time to work one of the biggest areas I I qualified to say this but one of the things I've become more aware of as of late is loungewear right if you're going to work from home and you're going to be at home find comfortable clothes and there's clothes that I will Lounge in at home but I would not be caught not even going out to get the mail in not that they look bad but they're just it's loungewear right this is what you Lounge in it's not shopping clothes it's not going to the grocery store cloth it's not going to the mall clothes and what is the world done they've turned pajamas into a commonly accepted attire to do anything but it is a mark of immaturity to not change to me it's a mark of laziness and sleepful to to to Slumber to remain in the garments of sleep awake out of sleep for now is our Salvation nearer than when we believed it says the night is far spent the day is at hand let us therefore take off cast off remove the works of darkness and let us put on the armor of light it's a language of taking off the PJs and putting on your work clothes taking off the loungewear and putting on the garments of light for work as Jesus said I must work while it's day this is a language that tells that it's a change of attire it's a change of gear it's a change of garments cast off works of d garments and put on Armor of light let us walk honestly as in the day not in rioting and drunkenness not in chambering and wanness not in strife and an envy and but put ye on wear as clothing as a garment the Lord Jesus Christ and make not provision for the flesh to fulfill the lust thereof we are to wear this in a spiritual sense and if there's this much emphasis in a spiritual sense of taking off clothing of darkness and putting on clothing of light then that in a spiritual sense can also be reflected in a very physical sense could we not all agree there's a way that we could dress that would signify some sort of Darkness he said before that there's people may draw lines in different areas but there's ways that people can dress way that people can act it's important for us to even consider whether it's a brother or a sister or a young person that the way that I'm doing my hair the way that I'm wearing my clothes I'm try am I trying to Signal am I being identified with something that's not holy because there are garments literal physical garments that are garments of Darkness but we're to wear Christ in a spiritual sense and by all means not cover him up physically in Matthew chapter 23: 27 I think the scribes and Pharisees are The Usual Suspects for me we find that they become a very good example of what we ought not to be he says woe and you scribes and Pharisees Hypocrites for you are like undited seers why did tombs or tombstones uh uh which indeed appear beautiful outward but are within full of dead men's bones and of all uncleanness quite an interesting tradition that Jesus is referring to since in the law you would not you could not touch a a grave or touch bones a and be clean it would cause some sort of uncleanness and you'd have to be purified uh they would make sure that a vessel or grave or tomb was Whited and very bright so that people would know there's death in there interesting isn't it and Jesus now says you are like a whitewashed tomb on the outside you look beautiful but inside you're full of uncleanness now what I would like to do is just invert that I'd like to invert it in the sense that we our outward appearance should not be void of light should not be void of Glory should not be void of Purity and appear as horrible vessels of uncleanness but then say Oh but inside white as snow white as snow my sins have been washed white as snow and on the outside appear as if we are nothing but a a a vessel of Darkness we should desire that our outward appearance reflect God's glory God's holiness and the humility of Christ in a way that these Pharisees were not able to achieve that not only would we be purified inside but even the outside could be a good testimony of that in Psalms 104: 1-7 is everyone feeling comfortable tonight is it proceeding as normal or am I is it is it okay good cuz is it just me I feel weird with this thing on my ear and it's amazing just how a subtle difference and even the sound sounds a little bit different and maybe everyone's just really really nervous about where I'm going with this because I told you my title but you couldn't read it and everyone's wondering if there's some Easter egg in that well there is my native code it was in the colors of the Irish flag yeah was in a gayc kind of font and so yeah maybe there was an Easter egg in there can we move on now good Psalms 104: 1 to7 pay close attention to this this is where it gets fun to me this is where it really gets uh a little bit deeper in a very simple way bless the Lord oh my soul oh Lord my God Thou Art very great now speaking of God Elohim the great one Thou Art clothed with honor and Majesty God himself has clothing who coverest thyself with light as with a garment notice this description of God who is clothed with honor and majesty and he's covered himself with light as with a garment and now it says who stretcheth out the heavens like a curtain who layeth the beams of his Chambers in the waters who maketh the clouds his Chariot who walketh upon the wings of the wind who maketh his Angel Spirits his Ministers of flaming fire who laid the foundations of the earth that should not be removed forever thou coverst it with the deep as with the Garment so it revisits that that analogy the wat stood above the mountains at thy rebuke they fled at the voice of thy Thunder they hasted away if you have time continue to read the remainder of the chapter as it stays within that theme but as it describes God in his creation the one who stretched out the heavens like a curtain and laid the beams of his Chambers and the waters and clouds were his chariots as it describes God God's creation and God is the creator there's this parallel to God's appearance and God's clothing it says that he is thou clothed which means to dress or to wear to be fully clothed thou are clothed with honor this Splendor and strength you are clothed with Majesty there's this ornament of Glory God has described as being clothed it says that he has covered himself wrapped or enveloped himself as a garment a mantle or a robe God is dressed in strength and gor Glory he is fully clothed with light now think of this God is being ascribed with having clothed himself with honor and Majesty in this beautiful description he covers himself with light God's covering God's garment is this light in James chapter 1:1 17 every good and per every perfect gift is from above and cometh down from the Father of Lights if he fathers lights it's because God is light himself with whom is no variableness neither shadow of turning this is the image of God God who is clothed with honor and Majesty a God who had covered himself with light even the very language suggests that God allowed allowed his shape and form to be expressed that's what we say God the invisible God forms himself into the logos he has dressed himself he's clothed himself in a way that he could be presented way that you could see him and know his glory and God being in this image do you catch this now clothed with honor and Majesty covered with light as a garment in the beginning man was made in God's image God said let us make man in our image God clothed man in God's glory in God's strength he had brought forth Adam as a God on Earth God who was clothed with honor and Majesty he covered himself as with the guard arment of light it says in Genesis 2:25 and they were both naked the man and his wife and were not ashamed but we know being made in the image of God there was a holy image that Adam and the woman were in a similar way wrapped in the covering of Honor wrapped in this covering of majesty there was a there was a light about them they weren't dressed in the manner that we would understand dressed now and at the same time I would say they they weren't naked then necessarily in the same way that we're naked there's no glory and Majesty In the Flesh we cover ourselves as Paul says to hide parts that are uncomely and parts that are not beautiful but yet the man and the woman in their state they had a light and a garment of Glory that covered them Matthew 17:2 in the Transfiguration it says about Christ he was transfigured before them and his face did shine as the sun and his reignment was white as the light this is this expression this Transfiguration this Glory that's emanating from the person God clothed and honor in Majesty strength and Glory covered in light as a robe or garment Christ now in the Transfiguration his reignment is white as the light we read in in Colossians well I guess we didn't read in Colossians 1 but Colossians 1:15 Christ was the image of the invisible God the firstborn of every creature God being the father of light in him there's no variableness God in the beginning was clothed with honor and majesty and he wore like a garment light so notice this as we've looked over this at other angles and just substantially uh go substantiating this deeper Genesis 3:7 and the eyes of them after the man and woman have partake of that which was forbidden says the eyes of them both were opened just as the serpent had told them would happen says and they knew knew that they were naked and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons if we could just use the figurative language that's used prior in scripture they took off their Garment of light they took off their garments of Innocence that Holy robe of honor and Majesty had to be removed God's glory had been put off they laid aside his Holiness think of the inverse of what we're to be putting on now and what we see in the end but what happens there in the garden is this disrobing of innocence and as they changed out of those garments and I know there might be this desire to think in a very physical sense that they actually had uh white garments but rather just think of how that they shed these things that in believing the light they had to remove this light that was about them and when they did it they lost their identification with God they took off something that identified them with God cuz now after they recogn iiz they're naked they sew fig leaves together and they make themselves aprons which is in the language is a loin cloth and they recognize their nakedness and they put something on to cover them but notice in verse 10 and he said I heard thy voice in the garden Adam when God said why did you hide I heard your voice and I was afraid because I was naked and I hid myself he's still naked even though he got dressed the native code had been corrupted and their outward nakedness now reflected the nakedness of their soul no m whatever effort they made in trying to hide themselves behind loin cloths they might have kind of felt guilty a and in the nature of their sin they they wanted to cover these parts and it was this identifiable shame but they had already taken off the garments of light the holy image of God had already left them and so no matter how much they tried to use this Pat work of leaves they still felt naked despite their efforts to cover their body they fell short of their that Divine dress that native dress that God had given them and so God had to properly clothe them I hope that you can see how significant these things are in scripture we could spend service after service after service using scriptures from the Bible that relate to clothing as being symbolic and then we could take that and we be right in saying that if clothes can hold symbolic meaning physical clothes hold meaning too and not just symbolic meaning but literal meaning very real meaning they're clothes of consequence James 1: 21 he says wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness and receive with meekness the engrafted word which is able to save your souls the lay apart means take off filthiness as in removing a garment remove dishonorable garments take off the fashions that have been stained by the world you can say well is he is he speaking specifically to that not necessarily but he could be lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness that means the residue or remains of naughtiness the residue or remains of wickedness or evil the residual remains of unrighteousness if God has in fact taken your soul and renewed it to be perfectly white and pure and he's constantly Renewing Your Mind he's saying then we ought to continue to lay aside all things that are dishonorable in whatever residue or remains of the world we ought to lay them aside amen and that would extend even to the garments that we would wear as men and women and receive with meekness this is humility willing to subject ourselves to it the engrafted word the word which has been implanted by Nature the inborn word if I could say this way the native word now which can make you fully whole that as we are told in scripture to take off those things that pertain to the old man and put on things that pertain to the new man as we are doing this in a spiritual sense there ought to be some literal transformation that's taking place in our physical representation as men wear their hair in a way that is respectful as women do the same and not cutting their hair in all the different ways that we can begin to describe the very specific elements of Holiness take time to read your Bible take time to search the word of God and find all the very precise ways that IT addresses holiness the native word the engrafted word which is able to preserve you completely in Colossians chap 1: 9-13 this being a principal foundation for what we read in Colossians chapter 3 for this cause we also since the day we heard it do not cease to pray for you and to desire that you might be filled with the knowledge of his will and all wisdom and spiritual understanding that you might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing being fruitful in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God strengthened with all might according to his glorious power un all patience and longsuffering of joyfulness with joyfulness giving thanks unto the Father which hath made us meat to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in light who have delivered us from the power of darkness and have translated us into the kingdom of his de son this is the Kingdom of Light am this is the kingdom of him who is in the image of the invisible God this Kingdom that was represented is coming in power when his reignment was white as the light this Kingdom which has been established by the father who is the father of light this one who in the beginning was clothed with honor and majesty and covered himself with light as a garment let our garments be reflective of that light if we have been taken out of darkness and delivered from the power of Darkness whereas at one time we dressed under the power of Darkness we presented under the power of Darkness let us now who have been translated into the kingdom of his son be Bears of light even the way in the way that we dress that we would give care to that musicians as you come to your instruments brother bam makes this statement oh for your sons and daughters of the king the king of kings let us conduct our character as Christians we are aliens we are pilgrims we're strangers here this is not our world Amen we are seeking a kingdom that is to come this is not our home though we be tossed about and made of made fun of by the world and called this and the other and oldfashioned and all like that what do you care you do not want to be pattering yourself after some kind of movie star or some television star or something some influencer some YouTube personality some athlete amen right so model you are a daughter of God you are a son of God let's act like God we are the children of God we know we are Sons and Daughters of the king let our character reflect his presence no matter how rough it gets let our character reflect his presence there is a reason why God desires that we would dress a certain way we could run it back through and use pictures and as I've been going back through different things there's a way that you could show a picture of somebody and immediately you'd know by the picture what they are even if it was just described to you you say well that's a cowboy this person's a doctor they're a nurse they they do this they do that they work in this industry they do that they're a football player they're B all just by the way that they [Music] dress take a picture and you can look at somebody with bell bottoms on and a tie dye shirt and long long hair and a headband on and you'd say that's a hippie cuz there's a way that people dress and it signifies something about what they're looking at what they're modeling what they value how they how they want to be perceived and in the same way the requirements that a man not wear a garment pertaining to a woman and a woman not wearing a garment that pertains to a man is so that there's a manner of dress there's a native code that says I am from above I am a Christian and God wants us to be able to be identified as separate from the world world and it's important for us to find that identity for ourselves and I thank God that he's given us a word a precise word a modern day word a modern day message that tells us that there's things that the world may call dated in oldfashioned but they're still beautiful to God and there the way that men and women ought to be acted in this hour that glorifies God why because we're in the Kingdom of Light God dressed himself covered himself in light he wore garments of honor and Majesty Lord let my garments give you glory let them please you and may I be a bearer of your light reflecting he says his presence it's quite a calling isn't it let's stand to our feet tonight and just pray thank you for your patience tonight thank you once again brother Ron for not falling asleep on the first row service after service he sits here and he listens he's the first one to hear me too and I appreciate all of you who are here tonight your attentiveness such a blessing to be part of the family of God if we could bow our heads in a word of prayer I say this to whether it be to brother roow and my daughter Eliza or any other young people here we want our character to reflect his presence and there's an attitude there's a disposition there's a shamefacedness there a clothing of humility the humility of Christ that we must wear but then there's also this extension of that in our physical garments in our physical dress and you may clearly look like you're from Arizona or you're from America you're from Mexico there might be ways that we could dress that could signify we're European or we're from Africa but we all should be wearing Christ Christ is in all God help us to find that measure of you yes in the way that we live the way that we Dess the way that we act our gracious Heavenly Father tonight I pray that you would seal these things up in our hearts that they would not be confusing that they would not be outdated or old-fashioned but we could see from the scripture that as you took care when bringing yourself forth in a visible expression you gave thought to what you would wear and you dressed yourself in honor and majesty and you clothed yourself with light as a robe and as a garment yes Lord likewise Lord when you brought forth Adam by Your Word he was clothed with light he was in your image and Lord when he sinned your holy image left him he may have in that moment looked no different but his garments had changed and in the of the nakedness of his soul he quickly and performed the first religious work of fabricating clothing from fig leaves and dressing himself and his wife with loin claws but still felt naked in your presence so Lord you use a language in the New Testament that we have been translated out of Darkness out of nakedness into light yes to be dressed to be gted up to be clothed so father I pray that we too could in our garment in our dress reflect your presence not nakedness not shame but your presence because you which have called us You Are Holy so you've called us to be holy and there is a standard for our young women and our young men this standard that we ought to teach in our homes this standard that we we ought to be living at church and abroad Lord this standard of Holiness that today is so reviled so hated why because men and women love their evil Deeds they find comfort in the residue of naughtin not willing to be completely died out in your presence and accept you they're worried about what it might look like as the Wardrobe changes as their hair grows out as they become less identified with the world by the jokes they tell and the things they watch but Lord to the real believer that Spirit of the Holy Ghost Inside of them cries out for more light and I pray tonight that all that would hear my voice especially those that are here today they could receive with meekness this word this Divine word this native code Lord because it's theirs and let it begin to work inside of them to produce this modesty that you find so beautiful as we're dismiss tonight Lord be with us protect us watch those who've traveled great distances watch out over them Lord on I 17 and different paths that they may go Lord we love you we ask all of this in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen
