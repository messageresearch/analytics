TRANSCRIPT
========================================
as you see already from our title slide we're continuing on the subject of the kingdom and identifying in particular Heaven's mystery Earth glory and on part four I believe it is of worldly kingdoms and we're really we're looking at worldly kingdoms for the sole purpose of identifying uh the plan and purpose of God and as we read in the beginning several different places are just kept referring to the quote over and over again God is always moving towards the kingdom science goes backwards God is always moving toward the kingdom and so the plan and purpose of God we could say just in a way of using a phrase that kind of sums up a lot of stuff we're using it as the kingdom you say well what God wants to do is he wants to do this and he wants to do that uh I'm I'm just using the kingdom to bring into view the plan and purpose of God because that's what God is wanting to accomplish is his will and his what was deep within his heart is a mystery in the very very beginning and Sunday if I could summarize Sunday by saying this God allowed Satan to pervert the kingdom uh he had he had all fashioned and laid out there laid out all his material as a builder had the seed sown everything was in its place each seed bring it forth of its kind the man and a woman are naked and unashamed because they know that they have the power within the seed to bring forth everything that God desired but then God allows Satan to pervert that Kingdom of Genesis 1 and 2 and bring forth what we're calling worldly kingdoms all these things that we see in the world and we were using the parable of the sower of how the you know the uses it in the first symbol sense that our Master we know that you sowed good seed but where did the tares come from and it was Jesus using the parable to raise the question of to raise the question of why is there evil in the world but then also to answer it by saying it's the devil that has done this and as we read in Isaiah chapter 45 verses 7 and 8 and More in particular verse 7 we know that God did not create moral evil but rather that was a choice of free will that mankind chooses wrong and even in the beginning he allowed Satan uh to have the capacity of free moral agency even as an angel he had the ability to choose because he was like God in every way except the ability to create and so he allowed Satan he didn't create evil but he allowed Satan and you might say well this is uh this is an interesting distinction but I think it's important he allowed Satan to pervert good and by perverting good It produced evil remember that a lie cannot exist on its own so God cannot create a lie but as soon as he bring puts forth truth and someone has the ability of free more agency then they can change truth he said well it doesn't quite mean that I know he said that you'll die but I'm just going to add three letters and say you will not die and that's all it took to take something good and turn it to evil and so the the way that Satan works is Satan does not have the power to sow seed of himself and so the only thing that he could do is find a way to deform good seeds and Satan found a way to do that take one seed that was meant to be used this way take another seed that was meant to be used this way and mix it together he said how can two you say two wrongs don't make a right right but two goods can make her wrong if you mix them if you mix them out of God's program in the way that God intended it and so I'm just using some summary language so that we're all on the same page and I have to admit sometimes I get nervous when there's visitors because I kind of have a tendency to preach in a series and you can just drop in on one service and be like he makes no sense he's lost his mind and so I get nervous uh in his when I preach in a series and we just kind of catch a snippet so if we need to kind of answer a bunch of questions later we're available but Satan he is a deformer so what Satan did is he deformed seeds that's what he does he's a deformer he deforms the seeds so sin is not organic or original right and that should please a lot of people who are all about Organics and so he'd say Walmart sells the deformed seeds and Sprouts sows the good seeds but it's uh we know that good seed is is original but Satan perverts the good seeds so sin is not an original seed sin is righteousness perverted Elias a truth perverted brother bam even says death is a perversion of life and so the things that you see that are Satan's kingdom whether it be Darkness it exists because of light whether it be death it exists because of life whether it be a lie it exists because of Truth and so God's not the one that creates those things as an original but rather they're things that exist as a result of the original being perverted I think that I think that's sufficient uh to go forward and I will say this it's at the real heart of us identifying the kingdom and even in eternity because there's a lot of things with I thought this was going to happen and that's going to happen and brother I'll read it here in a little bit where bro man talks about anything that had a beginning will have an end and so we are looking at things that are original and things that are perverted because that's a part of understanding Eternal things and in the sermon who do you say this is I think I just I don't know if I provided this statement but it says there is a system in the world and I would say that he's about to say there's two systems but we can identify a worldly system he says two systems and one of them is the right system and the other is a perverted system so there is a perverted system that is in the world and that's what we're looking at is where this perverted system began we use the parable of the sower the tares what are the tares brother Brown said they are the seeds of discrepancy that are sown by Satan it's that wheat's evil twin it's the mimic weed it's the impersonation and that's that's how there became a perverted system had that not happened and let's say nothing else happened then all we would have is the right system brother bam said in the seat of discrepancy Satan sowed his seed from the beginning when God placed his first harvest of human beings upon the Earth and I think we said before the way that he's characterizing this is very important that God had his first harvest of humans Adam and the woman that would be the pure human the pure race the pure seed that God had brought forth from the in the original creation and then Satan sows his seed in the beginning after God had placed his harvest in the Earth and he calls it a seed of discrepancy I think that characterization is so important because he says uses the definition of being contrary to what's already been so at a seat of discrepancy is something that's contrary it's a contradiction not just a difference you just say well the uh the serpent was different than the human but God wanted them he's a god of variety and he's a thing of a different Collins and different gifts in different places and one could have a true gift and one has a true calling and they're they're absolutely true but where they where things get wrong is when they get mixed and so it's not that God uh God likes differences he likes a A variation but it's not the the variance is what's against God so a seat of discrepancy is something that's a contradiction to what has been a conflict or variation between facts figures or claims and that's uh That's what Satan brought was a contradiction to God's program that's the seat of discrepancies oh well did Satan have an actual seed no he just brought a contradiction he used a seed of The Serpent and it brought a contradiction to what God's original was now I want to read this statement from the seat of discrepancy and it's in uh kind of two parts because then brother Brown gives the vision he had of the of the um the rain fallen on the uh just an unjust and the things he saw how the weeds Rejoice just the same as the the wheat and he's I had that experience in the Pentecostal meetings where one had a true gift and could use tongues in Prophecy and another one had an ungodly life behind it but he says I believe that Jesus was speaking this Parable in his day and this is the parable of the sword but was meaning it to be at the end of the world or the End of the Age which is this day that gives it a little bit more of a um we said I want you to understand this in particular in the end when these seeds are coming to harvest and I believe and he's taken it from Matthew 13 and he says and I believe this little text tonight is a very appropriate is for the hour that we're living in so if I could say this to us as Believers brother Branham as a prophet is putting his finger on a particular Parable and he's saying what Jesus is teaching in this and all the depth and meaning that it has he said is very appropriate for the hour that we're living in and if you want to argue it was appropriate for January 18 1965 and that alone okay that's fine argue it but if it was appropriate then just think of how these seeds are continuing to come to harvest and maybe even how more relevant it might be for us to take a cue from what was appropriate then and the brother Brandon continues after he gives that Vision he says the rain falls on the just and the unjust The Same Spirit can fall in a meeting and everybody rejoicing it Hypocrites Christians and all together exactly right but what is it by their fruits they are known so if we talk about sowing and manifestation he's looking at the Harvest to identify what kingdoms they may be of children of the kingdom are children of the wicked one that's the only way it can ever be known then you see that now since Wild Oats or wild wheat and Grains sometimes impersonate a genuine domestic grain so close that it would deceive the very elect so the other text he took was in Matthew 24 at 24 where he's talking about the spirit at the end time and he's false Christ would be showing such signs and wonders and doing such things that if it were possible it would deceive the very elect and so we can't brag about anything other than the fact that God designed You by election to not be deceived and so there's it's an impossibility for the elect in the end but notice how he's saying that it's a wild wheat it's that mimic weed that impersonator that those tares that have been sown into the Earth and into humanity and as we near the end he's saying that this even if you look at it in terms of a different type now the shock looks just like the wheat but it's not the grain it's not the original and so you could look at it from that standpoint or you could look at in terms of the tares that look just like wheat but it's it's there's a poison to it there's death in it he's saying they have been sown in amongst the domestic grain and it impersonates it remember the stowaway seeds and the truth about the Terrors that we've already ministered on he says I think we're living in a timely age when these things should be preached on and talked about and not and and the way that he puts it in that impersonation context I think is very very good because I believe that each one of us as individuals shouldn't should desire to manifest instead of impersonate and yeah maybe it's fun to sit back and identify all the impersonators but really uh it's horrible when we're the ones impersonating and so what we want to do is we don't want to be the hypocrite we don't want to be the impersonator really if I could put it this way if you're genuine grain and you start doing things like that you're impersonating the mimic weed hey you're the one that needs to check yourself before you wreck yourself because Christians shouldn't be doing that and so there is a there's an attitude that we have first we examine ourselves and we ask ourselves am I in the truth am I doing what's expected of a real genuine Christian do I have the right kind of attitude and so we're not necessarily wanting to identify externally the impersonations but how easy it for me having had my first nature and first nurture from the world how how is it that it's easy for me to slip into some of those things and not allow the kingdom to manifest itself and so we've been looking at Genesis chapter 3 where we could say that the the wicked one planted these Wild Oats these impersonating tears the mimics and so if you look at as we've looked at Genesis 3 we know it produces twins let's look at Genesis chapter four and and start with verse 16. and read uh just verse 17 and now we'll look at we're at least looking at the worldly kingdoms coming into into view and we could spend a lot of time on earlier in this chapter how that Cain uh brought of the fruit of the ground and in doing so brought an offering that wasn't accepted by God and when God came to him and said well your brother did well and if you'll just do well you'll be accepted and brother makes a statement that Cain could not humble himself to the word of God he said that shows the serpent Satan and so if I could put it this way instead of us saying that that that's identifying a pure serpent race on Earth today that identifies the hybrid nature that of itself cannot humble itself to the word of God and it ought to make you so happy for grace in your life that you did because the hybrid seed cannot humble itself to the word of God and so then God has placed inside of you in thy election into a new birth it gives you a different nature to where you can now humble yourself to the word of God so that's already happened in chapter 4 verse 16 it says and Cain went out from the presence of the Lord and dwelt in the Land of Nod on the East of Eden and Cain knew his wife and she conceived and bear Enoch and he builded a city and called the name of the city after his son Enoch so if I could say this is the beginning of the world in the worldly kingdoms this is now after there is a seed of of the serpent there's Cain who is that mixed not pure human not pure serpent as brothers teaches us he's now marrying he's having children he's building a city and this is the beginning of the world and worldly kingdoms what begins here is ultimately going to take over everything and so this is the beginning of uh these this is the beginning of civilization these are the seeds of modern thinking you say where we are today you want to know how we got here go back to Genesis chapter three look at its Beginnings in chapter four look at how God highlights it through the next few chapters and you look at that and it's all building up to when he calls Abraham because if I could say this uh and I believe it's Sunday morning that maybe we'll get into this how that God now frames the world but then he calls a man out of the world and he's going to bring forth the seed and in that he is representing symbolically through a natural seed his kingdom why the world exists as the kingdoms of Satan and so he's bringing that contrast right there through the Old Testament and then it's going to head up in Christ and Judas so you can see all along this has been God's plan but he's given us that Old Testament so that we can see uh how Satan sold those tares and how they're representing these other kingdoms so now that's these are the seeds of of the world and worldly kingdoms and so it says he Cain went out from the presence of the Lord now that's striking because it shows that even in the Fallen condition Cain is making a conscious decision to leave the word because in the beginning God's presence was declared by his voice it's declared by his the voice of God came walking in the garden saying and speaking so he was wanting to get away from the word he's wanting to get away from God and how he declared himself and made his presence known and he says indwelt in the Land of Nod now nobody go there tonight and so nard it means wandering speak or Exile and so we could say well that makes sense he's wandering away from the presence of the Lord and he's going to be exiled but it speaks of commotion it comes from the root of wandering or aimless and it it kind of carries with it this feeling of of unrest it's unsettled so if I could say about Cain and I want to say this because this is how I start thinking about Cain he's leaving and he's unsettled he has no aim he has no expectation except that God said well I'll put a mark on you that so no man kills you he doesn't say hey man just if you could just serve your sentence I'm going to take away I'm going to restore you and give you kingdoms and make you powerful and everything's gonna be fine again he doesn't speak any such prophecy over Cain when he's leaving remember the last time that somebody sinned and was sent away from the garden as they leave brother Brahm dramatizes but wait stop and love bundles itself up in a funnel and comes down and says I'll redeem I'll put enmity and so now as King's like oh no what's going to happen he says well I'll put a mark on you so that no one will will kill you he says and now Cain begins to leave God doesn't stop him he already he already told him hey if you'll just do well he'll just humble yourself to the word of God I'll uh your your sin lieth at the door and your brother you know he's telling them that you don't have anything if you'll just do right will everything not be well and so now as he leaves he doesn't stop him so his Cain is leaving he's unsettled he has nothing to Anchor himself in he's being driven by fear he's leaving the presence of God so it says restlessness and this aimlessness he's the maybe the father of wonderlust and then he says that he built he dwells in the Land of Nod there's your Wonder in your commotion and then it says he built a city what a remarkable difference I think we brought it up before how that after Abraham had a son of his own he planted a Grove and now after Cain has a son he builds a city one one making something that's open and inviting has no walls it has no fortifications but it's an oasis to welcome the weary traveler in but Kane on the other hand builds a city and the meaning of that means he built a place that was guarded by waking or watch I said well why did Cain build a city he built a city for his protection because of Terror because of fear because of his sins and to protect himself from himself as he builds walls and he builds fortification because now he's looking out and saying oh there's enmity and there's judgment and I've committed wrong let me build a city and let us let us support ourselves and fortify ourselves and so without happiness without peace and in the state of unrest he devised ways to protect himself and then feeling unsettled and feeling without any expectation if I could say this is like the this is you talk about whistling through a graveyard you talk about pretense Cain is trying to bring some sort of order and so to protect himself and to bring contentment if I could even say to dull the fear that was eating at him I'll build the civilization and I'll build walls and I'll build Gates and I'll have a family and we'll protect ourselves in the city as it's a place that's guarded by watching for what will come and harm us and we find and I could continue reading in this chapter but then I I use this just to show very clearly and I know you all believe this so it's not like I'm trying to say you people who doubt the original sin you're gonna get it tonight but just to show it's so scriptural that here from The Lion of Cain you first find polygamy you find murder with lameck you find an expanding of civilization and Science in verse 20 jabal was the father of those who made tents and raised cattle so it's a it's a means of protection and also sustaining life so he said we need to we need to find ways to protect ourselves we need to find ways to sustain ourselves and verse 21 um his brother Jubal uh it says was the father of of harp and organ players and so now these are the musical instruments uh they're inventors it's tubal cane in verse 22 he's the instructor of every Craftsman and brass and iron and they're making armor they're making weapons just think of how these Generations are unfolding and as they're coming up to the seventh generation and you see these things manifesting they're becoming wise right they're saying wow we need armor and we need brass and we need these fittings and we need these instruments and they're trying to find ways to protect themselves trying to find ways to entertain themselves they're trying to find ways to find peace and happiness and joy and why all this is going on in keyneslin it's all we read about Adam's lineages they called on the Lord like there's there's just some sort of contentment and satisfaction going on with these simpletons uh who are just wanting to serve God and they're cognizant of things that once were and now they aren't anymore and and they're hearing the maybe this narrative from Adam about what should have been and they still have some uh I want to use the word Shadow but maybe they still have some gleam of righteousness who Adam was direct from God so now this is being projected in his his line in his seed but over here notice in this hybrid nature they can't be happy and their accomplishments their advancements and their skill and music and Industry and Science and knowledge you'll see that it fits perfectly with Lucifer's Vision to have a bigger and better Kingdom and as we could track it through the Bible as cane seed spreads out it gets further and further from the righteousness that God intended for man to where if you find in Genesis chapter six when God looks down upon the Earth the witness wickedness he says of man was great in every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually what happened that hybrid nature had almost filled it up completely to where there's only one man left on Earth in whom God saw righteousness one it was Noah and that's that's the effect of that weakening blood the the mixture that's sewn into it this this nature of Cain and the way that Satan can influence it that's what that's the worldly kingdoms we'll read some places tonight to help I was wanting to take this from this scripture and start going through the Bible to Nimrod uh to Babylon and Nebuchadnezzar and all these different images in the Old Testament and that's when I realized I was wanting to give you 6 000 years of history in one service and I thought that wouldn't be a good idea and so we'll just read some things to summarize it because I want to go further but so notice how brother Brown says this in power of transformation as soon as they went out from the presence of the Lord they started building cities they started making instruments they started in science to make brass and iron and plain music and so forth now where did it come from who went out came the serpent seed you understand it Cain went out and notice he went out from the presence of the Lord and started working in science now look where he is still working science education cities culture it's of the devil don't get nervous but he says it's of the devil who started it the devil who is it of today the devil atomic bombs and things to destroy us with we live in it we have to live here we are a being we have to stay here that's uh that's quite a statement considering what he's about to say but God's Great civilization won't have any of that in it and science has taken the natural things and perverting it to do the things that it wasn't intended to do so it's taking natural things as brother man was talking about breaking into God's Great laboratory and they're discovering things and they're identifying certain things and they're playing with it trying to figure certain things out and trying to modify this and clone that he said they're perverting natural things into things that wasn't intended to do and is it not true that if science makes its great advancements and achieves something there's always a negative consequence I think we've mentioned that before man we can process food so much quicker now and we can feed billions of people cheaply and like isn't this great everybody's eating and then the Fallout from it like oh great now we need to come up with the way and science steps in and says we'll treat the cancers we'll treat the diabetes and right and so now it's just all the scientists they've made made one another necessary and so he says it's perverting things and natural things and perverting it he says and so is this is a real kicker scientific religion it takes the word of God and makes a church organization out of it instead of doing the things that it's supposed to do that's the that maybe is the real rub is it's when it comes into it comes into the church it comes into the things of God it comes into the message of the hour to where now it's a scientific religion that hybrids the message with politics and nicolaitanism and things of man and all sorts of ideas and those things he says you can't do that you've got to keep it pure remember you don't see a denomination and say that that's mixed all you do is when you see something that's mixed that's a denomination because that's what brother Adam identified as being in their anything that mixes the original is denominational now brother bam says this in the seed of discrepancy and I'm using this just to be more concise I was wanting to get into a lot of the scriptures of it but I'm wanting to go further I'm wanting to make a greater go a greater distance tonight so that we can continue into some other areas it says now we find when God sowed his seed in the Garden of Eden we find out that it brought forth an able so there's the man and the woman as God originally had set them forth in Genesis 1 and 2 that when she conceived of Adam she brought forth Abel but when Satan sowed his seat of discrepancy it brought forth a cane you know we I know we all believe that we're family tonight and we understand that one brought forth a righteous one one brought forth an unrighteous one because that Eve listened to the word of discrepancy contrary to the word so notice how the contradiction it was what opened up the channel for the Mixon all right that's where that's what it comes to so Satan uses the power of a lie that causes the hybrid and the mixing and that's there in the Genesis of it and so he says Eve listen to the word of discrepancy contrary to the word and it started the ball of sin rolling right there and has rolled ever since so God so to see it in the beginning and It produced an able we know that that's righteous Abel Abel operates by faith we looked in Genesis chapter 4 we'd find that he operates by Revelation you go again into the New Testament Abel by Faith by Revelation he acts and brings forth an offering a shedding of blood and it's a revelation and God has respect to his offering because think about his revelation of what happened in the garden because his revelation of what was brought death was brought in the and the way that it's so uh permeates his sacrifice and what it represents but his offering by Revelation is contradicted because think of the seed of discrepancy it wasn't just that it was a different offering but it was the fact that it contradicted I think it's in marriage and divorce where brother bam talks about Cain bringing forth by Revelation he says but excuse me Abel bringeth forth by Revelation but Cain is bringing forth fruit and he uses this phrase as he was taught that his parents particular as he was taught in the garden as they were taught in the garden and the phrase can be somewhat ambiguous but to me uh maybe I'm inferring that remember I'm saying that Cain was actually taught by his parents right because you imagine uh him feeling like they need to tell Cain you know Adam's not your real daddy like really the very first family and this is the problem like yeah is it any Wonder we have these problems in laodicea the very first family on Earth is like there's a secret and so what do they do that well it was fruit and that's why we don't live in that Mansion anymore you know the government Biden did it right and they just tell these stories thanks Obama and and so Cain is just like well you know that's great it was fruit let's offer up fruit let's offer these sacrifices and so Cain's offering was a contradiction to truth we can say Cain's Acts were poisoned right because he's he's been deformed and he's been he's influenced by the deformer again remember how that God wanted to indwell humanity God had alone reserved that right to him but he allowed Satan to use the serpent but he couldn't get in the woman he couldn't get in the man but now that he brought forth a hybrid who had some of the Serpent's DNA Satan had access to Cain to cause him to be a murderer caused off the wrong sacrifice causing to refuse to submit now causing to drive him out away from the presence of the Lord and so we could see that he's being deformed by the deformer and when Cain gives his offering I want to say this because it Harkens back to what we preached a couple Sundays ago on how the very seeds of Satan are the nature of it is pretense and pride and politics we see that in the beginning Isaiah 14 in Ezekiel how that it's all in there he wants pomp he wants circumstance he wants ceremony and so Cain acts as if ceremony is enough as long as it's pretty as long as it's beautiful as long as it's in order that's enough but this is born from Lucifer's pretense so we can say the seeds of false religion are manifested in Genesis chapter 4 by Cain it's a seed of unbelief the seed of Doubt because that's his poison formula that's his spray and it's deforming and it's even embodied in the phrase that he as it says that he traveled he dwelt in the land of not on the East of Eden brother Brown's the one that opened this up to me and and I would have just never caught it her brother man I'm not just pinpointed this but it's it's symbolic of religious motive not motive to please God but molded to please man motive for pretense if I could back up and say this about Cain Cain knew he could sense that he was untethered from the right things from the moment that God has respect unto uh able sacrifice Cain now is Roth and he's angry and he's a murderer and God says you're not right you ought to have done this and he knows that he's being punished so Cain is completely unsettled and Cain uh Cain is trying to quiet The Voice he's trying to he wants to give pretense that everything's okay he wants to posture himself and save a rattle that all is well and so when he acts it's it has religious religious motive to to posture to man and to give pretense to man even if it's to intimidate or at least to invite like hey wouldn't you want to be in this city a place of protection so he's acting out of religious motive because remember Lucifer desires to be worshiped as God not as a God he doesn't want to be the pastor of the Church of Anarchy and he doesn't want to be worshiped in this in the seat of the atheist he wants to be worshiped as God so he wants all even the children of God and the stars of God to worship him thinking that he is God so Satan Satan is going to be Cain is working in that motive in a religious realm and it's brother badman says it in power of transformation you can see I'm drawing heavily from these few sermons he says see how religious it was went around to the east side east side right so brother Brown he pointed points us to the fact that him going to the on the East of Eden signaled a particular intent and motive when he found himself on the east side that there is going to bring forth the fruit of religion the fruit of religious covering it's even from the very the very thing that Adam and the woman hid themselves in they take the from a fig tree and they dress themselves what was that the first religious move and remember uses that example religion is a covering and so now when Cain is going and when he first offers up worship and he offers up a sacrifice here then it is again it's in that that family of covering himself through carnal means it's a false religion it's a mimic it's wheat's evil twin and it's even in the same brother Branham identifies this I'm not going to read the statements here but I just grabbed the scriptures where in Genesis 13 it says lot chose uh all the plain of Jordan and Lot journeyed East and as he journeyed East that's where he separates from Abraham why because Abraham's not going to be religious but he's going to be true he's going to be in spirit and in truth so Abraham the true seed he the one that's called and elected he remains and it's just the religious that separate because they're going to journey into religion they journey into some other they have other motives they have other objectives and so even the name lot means covering and so it tells us he's connected with the sin in the beginning he's associated with that original sin it Associates it with Cain who's using the covering using the pretense and using the religious move so it tells us that he was in the Land of Nod it tells us that he built cities we're all recognizing the different elements of Cain of worldly kingdoms and then there's a religious hint to it because if I could say this and I know that I'm not going to touch on it tonight but maybe this will get you really hungry and pulling on this uh maybe even people change their vacation plans or something if it sounds exciting enough that this these seeds that are sown we recognize the polygamy the murder the the weapons the armor and all that side and civilization so we can get this image of Babylon and Hedonism and all these things and we feel that today we could identify that plainly in the world today but the same seeds produce spiritual wickedness and religion and Satan himself is transformed as an angel light so this is the statement I want to make that even though it may appear they're divided they are united even though it may appear these worldly kingdoms and the religious realm are against each other and they rally against each other right and one is this and one is that and they seem to be opposed to one another they're actually furthering the same agenda because given the opportunity you pull the curtain back they are United against the truth the thing they have in common is the thing that'll always bring them together is they can always bitter enemies can always unite together against truth and so now brother better makes this statement in the handwriting on the wall and this is kind of helping me uh it's almost like I've you know kind of able to accelerate a little bit quicker here it says in everything that is on Earth today in the way of spiritual things such as the spirit of God and the spirit of the devil and all the Cults and everything that we have today in the world they begin in Genesis Genesis means the beginning and all those things yet under another name and under another form but the same spirit that begin in Genesis brings it out and it's just like a tree growing coming up to a head where it'll all come to a climax in the end that's why this Parable is so important at the end the seat of discrepancy is so important to identify at the end for the great judgments of God where he will settle all things and all that had a beginning will have an end that's just something to really Ponder all that had a beginning will have an end just those things which had not a beginning has no end so God God has to God is Planning around that all that at the beginning we'll have an end just those things which had not a beginning have no end but notice it all the seeds sown in Genesis that we see here in Genesis 4 he's saying they are here in the end and they're climaxing at the end laodicea is Satan's achievement in the sermon in Israel and the church this is part four and he says some other things I think it's part three where he's touching on some real important factors about the kingdom he says you notice that all those Cults of this day are beginning in Genesis they had their start back in Genesis winding up out here in the last day for instance many of them like how that formal religion begin and came how it come on out and come down through the sons of Noah him out of him he had Nimrod Nimrod built the Tower of Babylon this is kind of where we're able to just to do the thousands of years of History so formal religion begins in Cain it comes survives through the ark Nimrod built the tire Babel Babel comes down through King Nebuchadnezzar's time and on Outlander Revelations Babylon so you have Babylon is in Nimrod and that Kingdom of Babylon just continues to expand and that's what God called Abraham out of is out of Babylon he's using that in the very beginning to show us something but it's Babylon that ends up in the end and now not so much as just a nimrod or Nebuchadnezzar but as a beautiful church as a beautiful woman comes out in Revelation he calls it Babylon he says how that little seed started way back there at the East side of the gates of Eden so that's where he wants to bring it that's where you see but remember showing us this is something religious too it's not just the murder it's not just the uh the fornication and the lust and all those things but it has this religious side to it coming on down winding out all kinds of Cults and everything started back there winding themselves out to the end he says now and again this series Israel in the churches I recommend it to everyone to listen to because this prophet's coming off of being in the field and he's telling us this is what I've seen this is where we're at and he wants to use Israel as an example to show us where the church was at he says now it behooves us to watch be careful be set in the word many things are taking place today which are unscriptural let's watch the scripture be sure that we are right I think that's very very good advice connects back to what he's saying in seated discrepancy the things that are happening today this is appropriate for us to look at these things these are things that ought to be preached on and things that ought to be talked about and I'll say I'm not I'm not saying that brother Branham gave me my marching orders and that what I'm preaching needs to be talked about but go back and listen to what he preached on it listen to what he preached we're here as a voice amplifying what's been brought and if God has gifted us what all we want to do is just bring out his brother bam said we would from the word the things that have been spoken before so that we can get a revelation of it it can give us life and Empower us and so we want to watch ourselves and be careful be set in the word because there's a lot of unscriptural things that are happening today but Satan always presents himself in scriptural ways so you've got to be able to identify these worldly kingdoms now if you would allow me to I want to just take a little bit of a turn here because I want to end on a good note in Matthew Chapter 4 verses 8 9 8 9 and 10. and this is to like just kind of maybe seal up the worldly kingdoms that exist today because I'm going to pick I want to pick up maybe on this verse on Sunday wants to recognize Satan's the one that did this Satan has these Powers he has this way that he's working and so I know it's going to seem real gloomy for the next 10 minutes but then I'm gonna I'm gonna punch back at Satan a little bit so now in the Temptation Of Christ it says again the devil taketh them up into an exceeding high mountain and showeth him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them it's from this verse that I got the phrase worldly kingdoms if we just use less ink if than saying kingdoms of the world so he showed them all kingdoms of the world and the glory of them and saith unto him this is Satan now saying I've showed them all the kingdoms of the world and the glory the power The Prestige just oh wow you'd be in Wonder of it and he says all these will I give thee if that will fall down and worship me that's it that's Lucifer's agenda in the very beginning that's what he wanted in the very beginning he wanted Michael to worship him he wanted all the angels to bow down to worship him he wanted to supplant and you serve God and so here he is he's not hiding it at all this is his ambition and this is the Temptation that really could only come to the Messiah he says all these things will I give thee if thou will fall down and worship me and I love how Jesus answers this because he's just I think his answers it assumes some things and he doesn't really get he doesn't get caught up in the argument with him he just answers get the hint Satan and he uses the word once again for it is written Thou shalt Worship the Lord thy God and him only shalt thou serve notice how he does not answer in any way to give any credibility to what Satan has said he just uses the word he's not going to debate oh well you think you own these things and you think you're great huh well yeah let me tell you something yeah he just says you know what the word says Thou shalt not worship you should only Worship the Lord thy God and him only shalt not serve so he's saying get the hints I got word for this get get behind me and so when when he says all the kingdoms of this world we're using the phrase we're only kingdoms but this is the kingdoms of this world I want you to think Satan's Eden I want you to think about the fact that he's the God of this evil age he's the prince of the power of the air and how Satan has all this control over the world today and it's the very reason why some of us start having a hard time when we start talking about the world in positive ways and that for God so loved the world and there's a world that God loved and that God wants to redeem the Earth and God's not going to completely annihilate it and there's a lot of things we start wrestling with because we have taken the world that we see today and we say that's Satan's world I'm going to read from to you from oh maybe five different places real quick just quick bullet points I don't have the slides here but I just want to read these to you because I've been reading every place I could find in the message of the hour where brother banham referred to the scripture and he says and so these just kind of give us some more uh color to what he says what the scripture means it says when Jesus was taken up on the high mountain by Satan he let him look down through the stream of time and showed him all the world and the kingdoms thereof so he didn't lift him up just to see the Roman Empire he wasn't seeing uh kingdoms that might have existed in other lands at the time and and maybe the power of Egypt or the power of Greece he's he's raising him up to Sea in the Stream of time all the world kingdoms of this world and he sees them all and the glory of them and then his brother says and he showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time so here he's able to see spread throughout history and I would even say these future kingdoms because he looked down to the stream of time and he identified all these kingdoms he says just think of that in other words he just opened up and he saw all the kingdoms of the world United States Russia Great Britain all of them and he said these are mine Satan did he says Jesus knew they were his friends Satan's so as he as he shows him this and you'll find this in the many different places brother Adam refers to it that Satan shows them all the kingdoms of this world and Jesus doesn't debate with them he he recognizes you're the only one who could produce these things you've set the ball rolling you set these things in motion so he could see uh he could see where this was going what a remarkable I just think about it just now how remarkable that would have been here's the Messiah coming after all those years and and here he is he's sitting there and and I guess you'd say whether I would know the exact time but four thousand years he sets there and here's the Messiah who's prophesied and he's shown Satan's able to show him that a couple thousand years later man there's going to be kingdoms far surpassing the ones that he sees Russia Great Britain the United States and program says every nation under the heaven is dominated by Satan so he could show him all the kingdoms of this world he says now in another place and think of this he says and as long as they're controlled by Satan they've got that satanic thoughts and Powers they'll just fight until Jesus comes as long as they're controlled by Satan that's all there are fights and wars and backstabbings and and breaking of treaties and uh sabotage and terrorism he says as long as this is as long as there's they're controlled by Satan that's what happens he says and that's the reason we have wars and killings is because these kingdoms of the world are controlled by the devil and as long as they're controlled by the devil we will continue to have wars and fightings and killing one another that's what we've got why because all the kingdoms of this world are controlled by Satan and Satan is able to show Jesus in his temptation I want you to see not just in this time alone where you are here as the Messiah and we kind of all thinking that when the Messiah comes he's going to overthrow the oppressors of Israel but he's able to show them kingdoms persisting for a couple thousand years and their Glory of them and all the powers and Satan is saying these are mine and he offers them to Jesus as if he owned them and brother bam says Jesus knew that Satan did he knew that Satan controlled him brother Bam's coming back and affirming yes Satan is the controller of all of it but remember God will only allow it for him to bring to pass his plan and that's the kingdoms of this world so the sermon power of transformation listen to how brother Branham describes this he says he had six thousand years to do it with his poison spray and how did he do it he says now this is the Striking part he says and listen close he did it by civilization because that sounds strange but that's what amen just give me an amen if it sounds strange it does it sounds strange and I I committed myself to just really letting that just wash over me I I I wanted it to eat at me I want to think that you're you're that we're being taught and it's the truth Satan produced he did by civilization and and what caught me what finally caught me is to be civilized it all it to be civilized it's a term that's used if we're looking at how that we would use the word in our English and maybe it's it's Roots it would be used to describe somebody that's not barbaric or inhuman and so you would look at societies that are uncivilized and they live more simple and rudimentary and and they live closer to the Earth and maybe they don't dress very much and they don't have churches and they don't believe in a god they have different kinds of worship and so you would look at someone who's in a barbarian and they would live in a very inhumane way and then brother Adam is saying but Satan started all civilization and then it struck me just how self-aware Satan was that he that he works in Civilization why because he's trying to cover up the fact that he is in fact inhuman that the whole world has been overspread through barbarism and through mixed seed and mixed race and that's that's what's populated the whole earth so of course he wants to set himself forth as being very very civilized hey now he's the one that wants class and he's the one everyone to think no no no no no no no no don't think for a second that there's any any beast in this this is beautiful remember the beast at the beginning and the Beast at the end the Beauty and the Beast there's your story Disney's just picking on it that there is that what Satan is setting out to do he says he worked through civilization because it has everything to do with pretense has everything to do with binding to putting on this this show and goes back to Satan's desire in the beginning or if I could say Cain's actions in the beginning he built a city he civilized because he knew his unruly nature he knew the things that existed and so he had only one way to perpetuate it without the chaos in the Anarchy civilization bondage fear organization wow it still sounds strange that it'd be civilization he says I'm going to make a statement here that'll keep you guessing maybe for a few minutes I hope not but you realize this now I'm not trying to support ignorance but did you know that Civilization Science Education and things that we cherish so great today is the very instrument of Satan even civilization civilization never came by come by God civilization come by Satan now I'm going to read it I'm going to continue reading here and this will make more sense than when I read it he's talking about what we see as civilization it's not saying that God's not a god of order God's not a God of this and decency that he's not saying that he's saying what we know to be civilization is not God's original we don't look at we don't look at things in certain orders and seeing things a certain way and go oh wow this is so good and this is so Godly and we start talking about all the things that we love and enjoy whether it be you know a car that doesn't use gas and there's no combustion engines or whatever it might be that we might think oh this is progress we're doing wonderful and you know the fact that everyone wears clothes and people take showers and we have all sorts of things to take care of bad breath and we say oh these are good things hey this is this is progress this is civilization how how could we EXA exist without civilization so it's not that God's not a god of cleanliness and Order and things but if that what we see Satan began he says civilization never come by God civilization come by Satan now prove that to you by the word just in a few minutes civilization is not of God for let me show you in this civilization the more civilized we get as we work through science we're always killing ourselves it's more true today than it's ever been it says in this civilization is built up to its Pinnacle now I want you to catch that it's at its peak and we got death in this civilization we got sin in this civilization we got sickness in the civilization he says that can't be of God so God in his great own kingdom that is to come we will have a civilization all right he says but it will not be anything like this it won't be by science it'll be a faith Civilization by the word a faith Civilization by the word oh God does that not Inspire us then that let's cultivate that kind of Civilization now that I don't need to be cultivated by science and deformed by science and and deformed by politics and deformed by pretense and all the pressures that exist in the world today it's just trying to deform you and it has access to defamation by virtue of your first birth and your first nature but you who've been born again from above you have a different nature and a different nurture which wants to transform you not deform you and it can transform you into a faith civilization Hallelujah because God one day in his own great Kingdom that will come will have civilization and it won't be anything like this he says it talks about here we're here on Earth trying to just find where he says it he says we're being we're supposed to stay here but God's Great civilization won't have any of that in it because science has taken the natural things and perverting it so God's going to have a civilization let me say this in closing do not this has been at the heart I think if you go back to the the last service the end the the last part of the series that we preached the first part which was the last part do not confuse what it means to be a pilgrim and a stranger because again that's what the pope wants you to think is that you're just passing through here just doing your time on Earth and you're going to get spit out into eternal hell you're going to get spit out into Eternal heaven and that's what this world is all about just just a temporary Passage Point on Sunday we said if even but for a moment in there in Genesis 2 1 2 that the world existed as the opposite of the king of Heaven eternity but God transformed it into an Eden now Satan has come and done what transformed it right back to chaos in darkness again but God's made a promise God's made a promise and let's not forget this let's not misinterpret what it means to be pilgrims and strangers Abraham's sojourned as in a Strange Land as a pilgrim and stranger but remember that was his land he was promised it it's going to be his seeds and his seed after him so even though he might have seemed like a stranger and seemed like a pilgrim it was something that he owned and I believe that the devil wants you more than ever to begin to feel so strange and so was strange to where you just give up and languish but if you could recognize I just can't seem to hold it in anymore we have been made Kings and Priests and the Dominion is here now and our Dominion is Over The World the Flesh the sin and the devil right now we're ruling and reigning over the world sin the flesh the devil the devil wants you to think that you're just some sort of heaven-bound Earth that goes restricted creature it's more than that I'd say it's the lies of Catholicism that just the shadows of it there still speak to us and try to keep us compromised we say this world is not my home but it only relates to the Eden that Satan is controlling now because it says in Revelations chapter 11 verse 15 and the seventh angel sounded and there were great voices in heaven saying the kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord and of his Christ and he shall reign forever and ever Hallelujah I believe these worldly kingdoms are not to scare us these worldly kings that you only exist here but for a few more days because it has been prophesied that the king of glory will assume power once again and all the kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of Our Lord Satan tried to offer him to him just as he did Eve offered a different way Eve accepted the very thing that was offered to Christ he said no I won't do it musicians if you please come in the sermon proving his word he said this son of the Virgin was the word made manifest now Saint John if you want to read that this Prophet this Prophet too he said but this son of the Virgin was the word made manifest the beginning of the creation of God now the whole earth is God's creation but it's lost then he redeemed this Earth and you are a part of the Earth and it redeems you by the same way he redeems the whole Earth remember I trust some of you are listening to a reading the future home he says now this son of the Virgin was the word made manifest in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us and here's Matthew chapter 4. Satan tried every scheme to make him discredit this Satan tried everything he could to make him discredited try to get him to take the kingdom without suffering try to get him to take it without Redemption notice how brother brings it back to Genesis 1 2 3 when it was God's plan in the Garden of Eden when he killed the lamb that only by Blood would he take it take the Earth even promised him all the kingdoms of the world if he would take it just think of what a promise I hope that that just kind of leaves you in a good state to recognize that Satan he had power over all of it and in that moment he offers it to Jesus but Jesus knows you can give it to me now but if I take it now I'll come to it in a way that I'm not supposed to just like you allowed to eat to come to it in a way that she wasn't supposed to and had she just waited for the promise I would have come forth and if I now in manifestation fall for the same lie I'll do the same thing that the woman did and the promise I'll have all the kingdoms and I could sit there ruling and reigning and and Satan could be worshiped through me in this place he could give it all to me but that's not the way that it's supposed to come it's got to come by Blood I've got to shed my blood upon the Earth to undo the curse to redeem what you've defiled and to bring forth all the spoken word seeds that are already laying in the earth oh Hallelujah the saint was trying to trip him up but Jesus saw the plan there was just one Kingdom that Satan couldn't see and there in the Stream of time in the moment of time Satan's showing them all the kingdoms all the kingdoms all the way down to Great Britain Russia and the USA and Satan's like you like that do you want it and just beyond that Jesus sees a bride Kingdom in a woman and he sees I can have all this but if I take it now I won't have that he says I'm sorry the glory of that Kingdom the glory of that woman the glory of that City the glory of one Jerusalem the glory of the New Jerusalem the glory of one kingdom is greater than all the kingdoms of this world it's greater than everything that you could show me he said no for the joy which is set before me I won't take it now without suffering I won't take it out with now without Redemption I won't take a now without the shedding of blood because if I shed my blood even those kingdoms that you raise up will be subject to me in the end I will have them in the end but it'll come God's provided way God's chosen way God bless you this evening let's stand to our feet [Music]
