TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I'm continuing on a matter of Faith tonight the subtitle is a kind of a question human or Divine and so it's a still on that subject of a matter of faith and in the question human or Divine it is kind of pointing back to whether it is a matter of human Faith or a matter of divine faith I think that's a lot to just explore in that question this is running parallel to the series on Christ my healer and there's been three parts already and the first part was looking at how the faith is a state of being and if it is a matter of Faith to that person then it is a matter uh it because that becomes the ultimate brother Brown pointed out in the absolute it's they becomes the thing that they rest everything on that barometer what they judge everything by and we kind of uh wrapped up that particular part on how faith is ecstasy and that it's transcending normal human experience and it's something that lifts the individual up and then part two in augmented in reality we looked at how that faith is a higher way of viewing the world and that with the lens of faith we can enhance our experience in the world and have access to some information and a layer of information or data if we want to put it that way that kind of augments or supplements our experience and what we're perceiving and it's a benefit to us to have that kind of faith and then that tied into the next part on invisible Dimensions or invisible Realms how that our faith is anchored in a Divine Dimension that's higher that's invisible it's not something we necessarily see with our eyes and that with that lens of Faith or with that Faith being Anchored In Those higher Dimensions we can watch the influence from those other base dimensions and those lower Dimensions that have that Humanity's tapped into and the humanity is tied to in humanity is influenced by so it really approached Faith from a particular perspective but today in this question of human or Divine we're really looking at how Faith operates on a person or in a person and certain measures or processes that may re uh that may be at work in a person and the results that come from faith and and it's just going to be kind of introductory laying some things out and I have to be very it's going to be I think it's going to be thought provoking because there may be some things that we mention and point to that are going to cause us to ponder and think about certain things but I'm not necessarily going to try to resolve anything there's some things I think that are worth us acknowledging that it's a paradox there's some things worth acknowledging that I can't explain that and and and I don't understand this and maybe it goes without saying but I'll state it so it's on record I am not going to do a series on faith and attempt to explain faith right it just wouldn't make much sense so this is not this is just taking the word of God as it relates to Faith and put it in a place where your faith can reach out and grab it and your faith can make more sense to it and brother random in the sermon faith is the substance we were listening together as a family and it's all it's a service that's really good to go back and visit to me it is no coincidence that at least to this point the first sermon that we have of brother Branham recorded so that we know and first time we have his words memorialized on tape to know exactly what he said is Faith is the substance knowing that his ministry is to bring us to a place of rapture and Faith or turn our hearts back to an original faith and a very first statement he makes is they're setting up new gadgets here so it's really appropriate how it starts and when you listen to that service it is very very thought-provoking how he treats faith in in a way that's really kind of shocking and jarring a little bit he knows it when he's talking about it that he's presented it in a way that maybe they hadn't considered before and he says at the very beginning of this sermon there's so many people speaks of faith and doesn't have one principle doesn't know one principle of Faith so many people can talk about faith speak of Faith but don't know one principle of Faith so it tells me that there's different principles of faith and they're kind of missing them all not maybe just one singular principle of Faith but many different principles there's a lot of things that we could think about faith but what we want to know at the end of the day are the principles of faith and as I as you look at Matthew chapter 21 we'll begin reading there in our text I will say that as we provoke your thoughts tonight I need to be very deliberate in what I say and not kind of venture even beyond what I have before me I want to be very very careful because it's uh this is just the beginning of a thought that I'd like to present hopefully next Wednesday day night on this particular subject that relates to human or Divine so we're just kind of getting some of the puzzle pieces on the table flipping them all over and hopefully getting a little bit of a border together tonight and I won't tell you how many pieces the puzzle is we'll figure that out as we go Matthew chapter 21 I want to read through it again just so we could kind of be in this Channel and pick up together and I think in terms of faith faith as a all the things we've talked about so far and when we know Jesus living in a world of his own but let's just look at this so in the morning he returned to the city and he was hungry he's a fig tree found nothing there on so he says in verse 19 let no fruit grow on thee hence Forward Forever it says in this instance the presently the Fig Tree withered away and then the disciples in verse 20 are marveling at how his words had such an immediate impact in other words it's not time for this tree to wither uh had it been in a certain time of season or so many months passed maybe they'd be like oh well that's that's to be expected by natural course so it's kind of showing us he speaks this word to this fig tree and they're marveling because this fig tree ought not to have withered but it did exactly what Jesus said and then what he says to me is uh opening up something to us he says verily I say unto you if you have faith and doubt not you shall not only do this which is done to the Fig Tree and the key there is if you have faith and doubt not so it tells us right away that doubt can become a barrier to Faith a doubt is certainly not a boundary to Faith but it becomes a barrier to Faith that needs to be removed so you can have faith but the presence of Doubt just is a limiting factor to What Faith Can accomplish it says you shall not only do this which is done to the Fig Tree but also if you shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea it shall be done and all things whatsoever you shall ask in prayer believing you shall receive and there's I kind of have a little bit of a nature sometimes to in just in personal conversations or talking to the kids or kind of give extreme examples sometimes just to make the point you know of course not or absolutely and so you just kind of go to the extremes and says I don't care if you had all the money in Europe you're not buying yourself an iPad or something like that and so there's just statements you make sometimes just to be extreme and you realize they're outside the realm of possibility so Jesus says that if you had faith and didn't doubt not only could you curse a fig tree but you could speak to a mountain and ask it to move itself into the sea and it shall be done and Jesus is identifying the capacity of Faith to do something that seems physically impossible but yet he's telling us that there's something about faith or the elements of faith and the principles of faith that some a person who could speak with faith without any doubt could speak to not a mountain of sin not a figurative Mountain but speak to a literal Mountain Mount Everest or whatever Mountain you want to mention Mount Humphrey and Flagstaff or something and say all right I want you to move yourself and cast yourself into the sea and Jesus is saying if we believe what Jesus says he's saying it would happen and then he says a companion statement in terms of whatsoever you shall ask in prayer believe and you shall receive and I think that's a companion uh to what he says but I'm separate from what he's talking about and Jesus to say that faith without doubt so this kind of unfettered faith for him to say that it could literally move a mountain which is what we believe he was saying it touches on this mysterious uh if I could say this the mysterious part of humanity and the capacity of humanity when it when it has Faith or when it believes and this is something that science still grapples with and maybe I'm kind of foreshadowing a little bit where I want to go with this but it could even be said of the placebo effect have you ever heard of the placebo effect it is it's an absolute within science they accept it and they believe in it they believe that it's not just a theory but it's something that's been proven uh the placebo effect that I could give you a pill for a certain sickness and if you believe that it would be effective on whatever your element was you take it and you actually get better and have measurable results and then science comes back later and says we gave you a water pill but because the person thought they were taking a pill that would actually treat that particular ailment or that particular problem it's the power of the human mind to believe in something and then in believing it it actually brings measurable results to pass this has been measured across many different disciplines in many different ways to where science is acknowledging they can't they can't say it for certain in certain ways and there's no fact that they can derive but they're looking at certain things and saying why is it that someone can do this and it's something paranormal something they can't explain and I would say that if if we were able to speak to a mountain and cause it to move and that literally happened then in a literal sense everyone say well the mountain moved right and science wouldn't argue with that and science could say yeah it used to be there it's not there anymore and we all the webcams caught it walk in itself to the Sea it happened and they would say we're not sure but we'll try to figure it out and who knows they might say Well it had been moving incrementally over a real long period of time and this was just the Tipping Point we didn't really catch it or the wind just kind of drives it and causes to do that be interesting to hear how they would try to describe it but Jesus is saying that that would have been an Act of Faith now in Matthew chapter 17 verses 19 to 20 we this is a different instance but he he's making a statement about the power of faith and I'd like to maybe taking a greater examination of this particular passage and this happening in a different sermon but the disciples had had difficulty casting out a demon he says then the disciples to Jesus came to the disciples to Jesus apart and said why could we not cast him out why was this demon so stubborn that we couldn't cast them out because they will arrive here a little bit as to where they had that power they've been given that Authority and Jesus said to them because of your unbelief or because of the doubt that was present it wasn't in the language it's not that they had no faith but it was Faith mixed with a little bit of doubt and there's some some resistance there and they weren't able to do it he says severely I say unto you if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed you shall say unto this mountain remove hints to Yonder place I like that yonder place and it shall remove and nothing shall be impossible unto you now in each one of these instances Jesus isn't giving us very many qualifiers he's not saying that if you go to the right church and you pay your tithes and you participate in feet washing and communion just kind of referring to these elements of Faith or these principles of faith that if someone believes and and does that not have doubt that there's the capacity of Faith to do something that we know is scientifically or at least physically impossible or has never been done to our knowledge something that kind of works against our human thinking and so it was because he says of their unbelief that it didn't happen it says but faith of the grain of a mustard seed and and it's kind of trying to orient it to something that is very very small or minuscule and it's not meant to berate them in terms of not having faith he's just saying faith unfettered faith that doesn't have the resistance and the barriers of unbelief even if it's just the size of a mustard seed is powerful enough to move a mountain and then it says nothing shall be impossible unto you so it's expressing this element that that kind of faith moves a person into a realm of where everything is possible and and so it puts it it's shifting it to a Divine realm because they say with man this is impossible but With God all things are possible so we could say that on some level God has designed our our existence in this realm of life and even Humanity to where there's this law this law that science can't prove a law that science does not accept that if a person could tap into this this faith and believe it all it gives them unlimited potential because of the way that God has planned it the way that God has designed it it's not the man that does it but it's God that has has given mankind access to a power through faith and again I'm trying to be very careful in how I phrase this knowing where we're wanting to go with this and what we're wanting to present to you tonight that's just looking at Faith and I appreciate the real uh the attentiveness in the pool tonight it's tremendous those are just mentioning of the power of faith and kind of catch the I've been saying capacity because I'm not wanting to confuse Faith with power but so this is the the principle of Faith or an element of Faith to be able to accomplish something like that and I guess I'll I'll go ahead and say it now that this this power is not this power says there's nothing shall be impossible to you but yet it's not an absolute power owned by by man because God's the one that controls and will either allow or not allow according to his program so there's there's a in program talks about the law of faith in terms of us being able to a Son of God have enough power to create which is a Divine characteristic not just move creation but a Divine characteristic to create a world and go live on it he says but it's controlled by a law and so that same law operates on these parameters where someone's just believing without any hindrance they couldn't do something that would work against God's perfect will and so this I think that hopefully that kind of adds some more context to what we're what God's put in my heart then in Hebrews chapter 11 verse 6 wanted this just to kind of um hit you with this thought of just how but profound faith is how important it is if that with faith the size of a mustard seed you can move a mountain nothing would be impossible to you and if you have faith and not doubt not only could you curse a fig tree and it would wither immediately but again you could speak to a mountain it could be removed this is two instances where Christ is relating to this El this these elements of faith that could move something in a manner which is contrary to Nature human history and experience then it says in Hebrews 11 6 but but without faith it is impossible to please God that's the hymn that is referenced here but without faith it is impossible to please him so God cannot be and will never be pleased without faith for he that cometh the God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him sets forth then a formula or a principle with God that if one has faith and can seek Him believing that he is and that he's a rewarder he'll give to one who seeks kind of it gives us this principle of God to where he loves faith and he will honor faith and he recognizes faith and and it tells us that as Christians and as Believers that the only way that we can ever please God Is by faith and nothing else we don't have some sort of it's not that there's a we're trying to build our resume in high school and doing a lot of extracurricular and I'm part of this society and I'm doing this and I'm doing that because we want to kind of Pat our resume with a lot of extracurricular activities so that when it come to submit something to God he's like well I mean I see here that they believe but whoa look at this over here and impressed with all your extracurriculars no it's just faith is what pleases God and so this faith is in this category faith can move mountains it can do the impossible faith is what pleases God that Faith becomes a very extraordinary as we've used the term in the few Services an extraordinary sense extraordinary capacity if five senses contact this realm five senses of the spirit and we're wanting to delve into a lot more than this Faith realm this Faith element is extraordinary now with that let's kind of rip the needle off the Record and read First Corinthians Chapter 13 Verse 2 because now we see faith is if I have faith that pleases God and with faith and not doubt I can do all these tremendous things and then Paul says something that just is so on the nose to what we've just read and we know he's speaking about the gift of charity and he says and I know I'm taking this out of a lot much larger reading but I think it it stands on its own tonight though I have the gift of Prophecy and understand all Mysteries and all knowledge and though I have all Faith so that I could remove mountains and have not charity I am nothing immediately this acts to me as a boundary to Faith maybe not so much a barrier but a boundary because Paul is saying I could have all the faith but if I don't have charity then I'm nothing all right and when I say boundary it's it's it's it's showing us where Faith ultimately must reside or where it has its perfect placing and and so this kind of becomes this qualifier to win Faith counts and when Faith really matters because he says I can have all faith and then says something that ties us right back to Matthew 17 right back to Matthew 21 and says if I don't have charity then I am nothing so there's some there's some heading there's some proper placing that would take Faith from the place to where it can accomplish so many things in the flesh but then become something substantive and eternal this party says I am nothing he he's saying that I mean I could have the gift of Prophecy and prophesy but that's going to cease and I can have knowledge but that'll cease and I can have faith to move mountains but at the end of the day what have I done I've just maybe raised the sea level and cause a lot of people to lose their beaches right he's just recognizing that what would all that mean at the end of the day if I could have some sort of Supernatural power to do things and it not be governed by a higher power or working According to some other vision because remember how that agape love and you guys are just pulling me right into next Wednesday night but how Agape Love Is Love of a higher intelligence so it's connected with purpose it has something to it and when we're 17 years old and we have a crush and we love somebody we don't we don't think about even what that means or what the consequences are and says all right you love them you want to be with them what does that even mean what's your goal what's your vision I don't know all right it's one talk to him I just love them but I just want to write their name on something hey there's there's no higher intelligence to it it's those base Natures it's just it's a feeling that's related solely to the flesh without really a vision or or some sort of guiding principle that gives it an eternal quality and so he's when he says I am nothing this he's showing that there's there's more to it than just this element of faith that could operate in a way to move a mountain we hope we can see that then in James chapter 2 verses 19 and 20 James puts it in a little bit different perspective he says Thou believest that there is one God thou doest well and I don't think he's being snarky as sometimes we like to say it like good for you what do you want a sticker I think you're saying that's good that's a great start because he that cometh to God must first believe that he is and what you'll find is at least whatever believing this is you do well because you got to have that first if I was if I found somebody who was sick and I asked them if did they believe in Divine Healing and they say I'm not sure what that is and I said well do you believe in God and like no I wouldn't go okay well anyways there's this way I could lay my hands on you and pray for you like I would just kind of skip over the most important part right I'd say well if you don't believe in God let me share with you the the principles of God and things of God and so I hear he's saying that you believe that's good the Devils also believe in tremble now what do I do with this it's not it's not using some other base word about belief it's not saying the devil's suppose or the devil's thing the Devils also believe and tremble uh supposing that there's even a greater depth of understanding with their belief that causes them to fear God and be reverential to God because you believe in God and yet you don't fear him but these believe and tremble at the awesomeness of God and he says but without no obey man that faith without works is dead I realize James chapter 2 is kind of drawing us into a larger understanding of being justified by faith and being justified by works and he says it without uh without any ambiguity and he says it more than once that Faith with no Works ought to be considered dead faith if I could say this way what James is saying is you tell me you say that you believe but absence absent any fruit of that belief I have every right to believe that your faith is not a living faith and that's James is putting it in that way but for him to say this to me it becomes one of these things we're beginning to understand wow there's maybe a lot more to Faith than just well just you know play and Obey right there's more to it than that saying the Devils also believe and that without works faith is dead those are two different statements to me that kind of add to if I have faith all Faith to move mountains and have not charity I'm nothing so there's three different statements related to Faith that kind of add this color to it it's like wow there's a lot to this and so there's some level of believing or some level of faith taking this from James chapter 2 that is not Anchored In an eternally sealed soul again I'm being very deliberate the way that I say this because if Devils can believe and Devil's incapable of of Salvation incapable of being sealed but yet they're capable capable on some level of belief uh and conviction of something and Paul saying that I can have all Faith to move mountains and still be nothing and he talks along that lines in a number of different places it this is maybe I'm saying it knowing that this is true that there's a level of faith that is not necessarily anchored in a soul that has been sealed by the Holy Ghost can we recognize that and so faith can operate in Supernatural healing faith can operate in manifestations faith can operate in demonstrations but be on a different level than the faith that Paul is talking about that could be joined with Charity or the faith that James is talking about that would be Faith with works and and and even the faith the ultimate faith of divine faith and with respect to Faith and I'm sure and if you have thought of this you could you could throw a hand in there you could give me a hearty amen the more that we read our Bibles the more that we listen to the word of God we find that Faith operates in different ways in different instances and that there are different processes that achieve similar results and yet it's coming from different perspectives and there's different ways that Faith Works and so there's a way that faith can work on one person and then faith can work a little bit differently on another and achieve the same results and we maybe can try to compare and say well what's our takeaway is there anything we could take away from this and you might find yourself saying that well the way this happened here and the way that happened there I can't even reconcile it but at the end of the day what you realize is that there was some promise that was made there was some Faith directed towards that promise and each one received what they wanted on the other side of it but different processes and different ways that it works now in Matthew chapter 10 verses 1 to 4 this is taking a step forward now in this examination of Faith this is in Jesus calls his 12 disciples and when he had called unto him his twelve disciples he gave them power against unclean spirits this is Matthew chapter 10. you know how many chapters are in Matthew this is this is not in the book of Acts this is early on when Jesus is Calling his disciples you'll see how early it is he's doing this before we know their names in in total it says he gave them power against unclean spirits to cast them out and to heal all manner of sicknesses and all manner of diseases this is power given to the 12 disciples who have not been regenerated by the baptism of the Holy Ghost now the names of the 12 apostles are and it gives us these 12 Apostles and I will skip in case my lisp raises its head to verse 4 and it says in verse 4 Simon the Canaanite and Judas Iscariot who also betrayed him thanks Matthew thank you for letting us know for sure this is who it is kind of like what John does they all kind of throw Judas under the bus real early on you know the one who was betray him this guy but what's clear is that he is included in the twelve that have received power against unclean spirits to cast them out to heal all manner of sicknesses and all manner of diseases so this we know that the Bible says that to want a gift of faith to another gift of healing and so there are and I and I could say this confidently according to way the brother Branham teaches this that there are those who can have measures of gifts and this is where gifts as we said on Sunday gifts are different than signs but these gifts can be operated in a person's life and it's a god-given gift it's a gift that's there but yet due to a lack of sanctification or a lack of an experience or even a lack of placing that gift can be used but yet that person themselves ultimately as Paul says be a Castaway ultimately uh end up in ruin and and unbelief but yet can be used to do many powerful things Judas would be a tremendous example of this in that he has given power over Uncle spirits to cast them out heal all manner of sicknesses in all manner of diseases now based upon the reading of the scripture anybody could argue well it never says that Judas actually did it and so if you just if that's the approach you want to take that's fine but your name's actually not in the Bible either so in Luke chapter 9 it says this and then he called his 12 disciples together and gave them power and authority over all devils and to cure diseases now again this is this is the companion scripture to that whether or not Judas ever actually did it he had the power because the scripture is unequivocal about it Judas had been given the power to heal to have authority over devils and to cure diseases he's included in that in Matthew chapter 10 power against unclean spirits to cast them out to heal all manner diseases and sicknesses this is a language that looks a lot like what it's going to be like whenever that he gives the signs to the church right and we'll find this again in just a moment in another place in Luke where he's in just the very next chapter here after Luke chapter nine he's speaking a language that's that shows the same kind of manifestations in a group of people that believe if I could say believe with the air quotes Believe In Christ or near Christ being commissioned and given the authority of Christ go forward to do many wonderful works but on another level it's not that Soul faith that we would want to have for our lives and so in verse Luke chapter 9 verse 1 they've been given power verse 6 and they departed and went through the towns preaching the gospel and healing everywhere Luke chapter 9 verse 6 and they departed went through the towns preaching the gospel and healing everywhere what happened they did it the Bible's telling us as it says in Matthew 10 he gave him the power now in Luke chapter 9 verse 6 they went through towns preaching the gospel and healing everywhere so they preached the gospel signs were Fallen this is a pattern that is operating within the lives of the disciples who've been called by Christ and this is this has to be according to and and I know if you say well brother Aaron you're making some assumptions there if you're students of the message you know exactly where we're drawing these things from there's some acceptance by these disciples there's some Faith to whom would we go and there's some Awakening of a greater desire and a supernatural and they become his disciples and they're willing to take him at his word and to go forward believing that they have authority and they accept that they have this Authority and they accept that they can cast out devils and they accept that they can cure diseases and guess what the Bible says they went through towns preaching the gospel healing everywhere so it's not just Jesus that's getting the crowd stirred up at this point very next chapter it's not just the 12 that have it but in Luke chapter 10 verse 1 and after these things the Lord appointed the other 70 also and sent them to and two before his face into every city and place whether he himself would come so he points the 70 to do the same thing I thought maybe I had another scripture here so I just need to check and make sure I didn't accidentally uh strip out some of this there's they had so much I apologize if I'm not really on point today it's been a very difficult week as a family dealing with this sickness and and so Jesus now in Luke chapter 10 is sending for 70 more laborers into the field in the same way that he had commissioned the disciples to do it and so we're not um what they say now if you want to look at verse 17 this is where we'll find this statement and I think it becomes very clear to us that they had been given the same power that the disciples had in Luke chapter 10 verse 17 he appointed seven so you have the 12 now you have a 70 and some places I read where they say they're 72. uh they joined the 72 to it it says 70 return again with Joy saying Lord even the devils are subject unto us through thy name so it's not just the 12 disciples it's not just like the original Clique right the guy it's not just the guys in the upper crust and Christ cast system that we try to we try to impose in churches now it's not like well you got the 12 and they're the Legacy families and and they're they're but now even the 70 right the late comers they're able to do the same thing and maybe they're like we're doing it too just like these other guys and that's their Testament devils are subject unto us through thy name so never get in your mind that this was a kind of a one-off show where they were out invoking some other name or operating According to some other power but it's Christ commissioning them giving them the authority them operating in some sort of conviction and belief that this is the correct Authority and then they can invoke his name and use the name of Christ to cast out demons and now this is Jesus now amplifies what was happening from verse 1 to verse 17 because he tells us what was taking place even though they had yet as it bragged about it and again remember Matthew chapter 7 meaning will come unto me on that day and how it it espoused many great exploits of what they accomplished but yet they're not known by him so he says in verse 18 I beheld Satan as lightning fall from Heaven it's like wait what you know we're out there Cashing Out Devils I behold Satan fall from Heaven as Lightning verse 19. did you guys ever hear back when Barack Obama was elected president I think I was actually uh tricked into saying it over the pulpit by somebody but the the actual reading in there is I saw in one of the languages is I saw Satan fall from Heaven as Barack Obama I'm not saying it is but could it be it's just interesting how people can do stuff like that Lord forgive me and it says in verse I mean I wasn't serious when I shared it but it was just an odd coincidence I didn't believe it now it says in verse 19 it says behold I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy and nothing shall by any means hurt you this this is what had been demonstrated to them and this is the power that's being conferred upon them he says I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions and overall power of the enemy and nothing shall End by any means hurt you what does that sound like you shall take up deadly serpents you shall drink deadly things and it shall not harm you there's this idea that man there's a power that he's giving the believer giving these disciples that there's there you may have attacks you may have things that come against you and there may be pitfalls and trials and things that you come against and preach in the gospel but I'll look out after y'all care for you but then he says notwithstanding in this Rejoice not even though this may be within your ability because I give it unto you I give you power but don't Rejoice that the spirits are subject unto you verse 20 notwithstanding in this Rejoice not rejoice not that the spirits are subject unto you do not rejoice because you can tread on serpents and scorpions do not rejoice that you can handle snakes do not rejoice that you have power of the enemy do not rejoice at Nothing by any means can hurt you but rather Rejoice because your names are written in heaven Jesus breaks open these levels of faith and introduces election he's just completely he he's basically told us this that as he's already expressed and he does express it as Ministry that a lot of people can operate in a realm in this natural realm where these lower I say lower but these Powers these influences from beneath are actually higher powers in terms of human strength but the coming from beneath that a person could take their faith and move themselves above these demon powers and draw make them subject and he's saying to rejoice and that alone will miss the mark because the real place of rejoicing is that your name is written in heaven and so Jesus is showing us that there's levels of Faith or even if we can put it this way areas where God can operate because I give you power you can tread on serpents you can do these things and Judas as we go back to Matthew chapter 10 and Luke chapter 9 Judas and the 70 could operate the power of Christ through a faith believing that they had it they could go forth and exercise it but then Judas was a son the son of perdition the 70 eventually we know walk away right so then what faith did they have what faith were they operating under or or what's upholding their faith and what's keeping their faith afloat and uh how is it that Peter with seemingly no other uh qualifications or abilities than Judas or even these other seventy when the seventy walk away and he says are you going to go awesome Peter's like where am I going to go there's something this faith is still holding in a different realm for peter than it did for these other 70. now before we get too crazy with Peter's Faith he then just a little bit later tries to kill a guy with the sword and then denies Christ completely all right but there's still something about this faith that uh that Judas had and these 70 had that begs the question what kind of Faith do they have in Blasphemous names I'm just I'm going to draw a few statements from this sermon to make this point because I think even despite or without the greater picture that he's painting with respect to the Statue of a perfect man in certain virtues and building up that person either as a a human image of those things or a Divine image uh these principles stand the same so I think I can just kind of pull these out because they he makes these statements in different ways other places and blasphemous names he says you see there are two kinds of faith there are two kinds of virtue as I had the other day two different kinds of knowledge two different kinds of temperance what is he referring to what we call the statue of a perfect man add to your faith and he's building these up now he's acknowledging that there can be a whole nother a whole nother statue not a stature but a whole other image having a form of godliness that is not the kind that we ultimately want or should have but he's acknowledging that it's there a faith a virtue and knowledge Temperance there's different kinds he's saying in the message of the Queen of Sheba he says there is a genuine faith and this will this kind of gives pulls back the curtain a little bit on how my mind is thinking about processes and how faith can work in one channel faith can work in another Channel but there's an ultimate Channel where the believer is he says there's a genuine Faith but you must come into the real channel of God to have that genuine Faith so there's a way to come through a channel he said there's human Faith then there's Faith Of God I think we could look at that in the scripture even in Romans it says it doesn't make the faith of God of no effect so there's a faith of God there's a faith of Jesus Christ there's the faith of God's elect those are designations about faith that have achieved something different if I could even say on a higher level than just kind of a believing or acknowledging something so there's a human faith and then there is Faith Of God he says and you must have a Godly Faith to believe now then to have Godly Faith you must have the mind of Christ in you so Godly faith in that way is the mind of Christ it's speaking speaking of something very particular a genuine faith and then a human Faith so we could say there's a human faith and there's a Divine Faith there's a there's a genuine faith that God we say is the faith of God but then yet there still is a human faith and if I could say this I'm being very careful tonight there's still something powerful about human faith so there's two different kinds of faith if I could just throw some terms out there there's a human faith we might find it to be a mental Faith an intellectual Faith or emotional Faith that's a human faith that would have and I guess I am going to have to go a little bit further than I wanted to tonight but maybe it's just kind of present the image and we'll reinforce it later with the statements from the message of the hour in the scripture that there is a faith that one could have that would merely be one that would be in their mind or their Spirit their emotions of well I believe and and that can reside in that realm alone and that would be mental Faith intellectual Faith an emotional faith but then there's a soul faith that speaks of a faith that has been sealed by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and that sense and if you want to kind of dig into these things on your own and begin to just Ponder these things and pray about them and and really seek a perfect understanding of these things that Faith that's in the soul it's in a soul that's been sealed off to where there is only one Channel One Source in the soul in that's faith faith alone so then what is how does a person who has not the Holy Ghost who does not have the new birth experience which is the Seal of God which is the baptism that goes upon the soul because the baptism goes is the Seal of your faith believing the word of God what does a person who does not have that seal who can actually operate faith and Achieve results what faith are they operating take the name of Jesus don't want to know what it is I'm not just going to end there but it's good to think about it Judas was not elect so the only faith that he had or could have ever had was a human faith in Divine things in a Divine promise in something that God Jesus said that you had so he could take this intellectual faith and there's certain alignment and there's a certain alignment that he could have that forese and he could operate in that channel but that that's not that's not the kind of faith that can stand on its own because after all it's human and so if you can have two different kinds of Faith a human Faith which is mental intellectual emotional and then you can have Divine faith these are different faiths they work in different measures they work in different processes they can achieve the same but ultimately they achieve different results you could have someone who has intellectual faith and could seem to have a life that is much more dynamic than that of one who has Divine faith and one comes up in the resurrection and the other one's left for judgment in Romans chapter 12 verse 3 and 2 Thessalonians chapter 3 verse two two scriptures just to show us that God deals out measures of faith it says for I say through the grace given unto me to every man that is among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think but to think soberly according Romans 12 3 according as God hath dealt to every man The Measure of Faith if we look at this within the body of Christ we could accept that there's some that have greater measures of Faith they work in that realm it's a gift of faith it's a gift of prayer I think I mentioned this before but brother Andrew your grandfather brother Fulcher uh has a tremendous gift of prayer and a gift of faith even to where brother Berry told me one time if he was ever sick he'd tell brother Fulcher and he'd want that man to pray for him because he gets results when he prays and I'll say this I brother Andrew to me has demonstrated someone who has that kind of faith to where I've found in my life he says he's praying for me there's there's results that are immediately achieved and people can have that they have a certain measures of faith and so God deals to every man The Measure of Faith so we realize measures there's there's certain anointings or gifts or callings and they all have to operate within this particular certain ways and certain processes so that says God gives Every Man a measure then Paul says in second Thessalonians chapter 3 verse 2 and that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men for all men have not faith and so there are those who are faithless they have no faith they there's no faith within them at all if I could just kind of seed your thoughts a little bit there are believers make Believers and unbelievers the unbelievers don't really have any semblance of Faith whatsoever at all and then a make-believer has Faith but it's in a different realm than the believer who has faith and so this is the Bible's just shown us there can be measures and there can be those who don't have any faith at all now coming back to Blasphemous names and I'm trying I'm trying a new approach I don't I don't know what time it is a totally new approach probably not a good idea to do it on a Wednesday but um I don't know what time it is and don't tell me so in the sermon Blasphemous names says in the biggest part of our faith is mental Faith so there is a mental faith and I think it's been good for me to recognize and reading all these instances where brother I was talking about faith to see that there's ways that he refers to the faith a faith same way we would take it in the Bible and then that same word can be used in a different context and we know it's not talking about the same thing and so there is a mental faith and that would be your own faith it'd be human faith not just something that you possess has been that has been given to you by God in the soul realm but it would be this emotional intellectual mental Faith he says the biggest part of our faith is mental faith and then this is so beautiful by hearing the word it brings us to a mental recognition of God so that's what the preaching the word first is to do we don't sit here in in the pews and then we're kind of hypnotized and then the word bypasses all sensory input as far as the mind the hearing the emotions and all those other channels and we just kind of get in this state of hypnosis and then we say receive the word and your soul goes hey hey right it's not how it works there's a wrestling that takes place in the mind the ears hearing the mind is wrestling with it and the preach and the word of God kind of swings your mental mind your mental thinking your mental believing your mental recognition it swings your mind to accept and to believe the things of God remember that that's what the preaching the word does it's going to swing your mind so he says the preacher word brings us to a mental recognition of God but if this this Holy Spirit now this Capstone coming from above brother if it ever strikes this then there's Godly spiritual faith that wouldn't be in this this realm necessarily it's in a different place it says then what does faith do that Faith recognizes only the word no matter what anything else says it only recognizes the word that's when faith has gone from the head to the heart or the spirit to the soul sealed in there by the baptism he goes and then now that faith is beating and the only thing that can give it life is the word only the only the only thing that can come in there is the word the devil can't even get to it he's going how can I get in that Soul how can I get in there he doesn't know it he can't do it he can't bring the word he can't impersonate the word he can't touch that soul brother Brandon kind of amplifies through scripture in the beginning there was a word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the word is still God the word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us and when the word itself is poured into our faith our mental Faith becomes a spiritual Revelation and upon that this Foundation I'll build my church you don't get the Revelation in here you get the Revelation down here not upon a mental conception of church joining a mental conception of that but upon the Revelation when them streams of Grace is poured into that mental faith that you've got so there's a place where our mental Faith becomes anointed in the soul Realm by the powers of God and he says he continuing the same sermon this is skipping quite a bit here though so I put it in a different slide that Faith only knows the word that's real spiritual Faith you see that's right it only knows the word that's that Soul faith it's a Divine faith that that was number one number one coming to your mental Faith right here comes the Holy Spirit coming down in your mental Faith making it a spiritual Faith then the spiritual Faith only recognizes the word now kind of this uh recognizing that someone could try to build themselves in a particular image but it's not until the word comes that you actually have that real faith Foundation Faith otherwise brother Bram said when he preaches statue of perfect man you're a blackbird putting peacock feathers in because you don't have the life you're this what he's talking about here it's a mental conception of Faith trying to build yourself up into the image having a form of godliness but having not having the power of Revelation to transform mental faith into the Bedrock of spiritual revelation so that's another way of putting it where brother Brown is saying that there's a mental Faith but then there is a Divine there's a spiritual Faith that's not built up in the head but built up in a soul and these are kind of just pieces that I'm putting out there so in first Timothy chapter 5 verse 12. and there's a number of different statements that we could have pointed to tonight especially scriptures just to see kind of the whole the vast uh survey of faith in the different ways that it's referred to but in first Timothy chapter 5 verse 12 just want to focus on this phrase having damnation as he refers to these women he says because they have cast off their first faith now if you if you have some initial faith and you have a belief and you have a conviction and if Paul says there's a certain pattern behavior or certain things that can happen where you could take that faith and cast it off you have an ability to cast it off immediately puts it within the Realms that you have control over it puts this faith in a place to where it's something that was temporary something that was not permanent I'm realizing now I did um I did kind of chop chop my notes up a little bit and cut them very very short and so I thought I had some references some scriptures and references to the temporary nature of this intellectual Faith but maybe we'll have to pick it up later it says having damnation because they have cast off their first Faith what faith would that be that mental faith the emotional Faith the intellectual faith that faith will fail that faith is temper that Faith was exists within the ability of man and man's fortitude and discipline and whatever factors can work Upon A man mentally and physically and then in second Timothy Chapter 2 Verse 18 again he says who concerning uh the truth have aired saying that the resurrection is passed already and by means of this false Doctrine it says and overthrow the faith of some so you have some that can cast off their first Faith their first believing their first convictions their first uh um uh confidence and then there's others who by means of a wind or false Doctrine can have their faith overthrown now what faith was that was it a human Faith or was it a Divine faith they have cast off their first phase Faith or their faith has been overthrown this would be clearly I say clearly but I think it's and I'm not trying to just use the The Logical conclusion here but it's not one that's sealed right it's their own faith if it was their own faith that they had in the faith of God their own faith that they had in a faith the old Faith they had in real Supernatural things what was undone is not the faith of God or the faith of God's elector the faith is being that life or that ecstasy that augmented reality that invisible Dimension uh and that Sixth Sense this is another sense altogether that has been overthrown that was of the humankind he says our biggest part of our faith is mental faith that component is what they had initially but it had never been by Revelation transformed and galvanized into Revel real faith and so faith in the Bible is that that Greek word pestis is translated to assurance to believe to Fidelity to believe so this is what faith is it's the conviction of the truth of anything it's a belief it's trust or confident confidence so we can say faith and we could talk about confidence and we could talk about assurance and faithfulness and that believe can merely can be merely mental that assurance that conviction that conviction of a truth that belief that trust that confidence can be intellectual towards the word it's just uh as brother Madam says a big part of our faith is mental we hear the word it brings us into recognition of God he said well we didn't even know there was such a thing as that or I didn't know this and so there's this part where in the head the head kind of says okay yeah I didn't know that they can accept that they could believe in it if somebody never believed in the Supernatural and they witnessed the supernatural take place whether cancer fall off and and I remember having friends of mine uh testify of their their their parents or their grandparents being in meetings and witnessing they remember in particular this one brother saying my grandfather was in at a meeting and the Brother Band told everyone to Bow their head and and he he kind of just was peaking because this boy had come up with a mangled limb and and he said he said I was looking I was looking right at he said he said his grandfather said he closed eyes and looked right at it because he wanted to see whether or not this was real or not he said he watched with his own eyes brother banham pray for him and the leg straightened out swell out turn around and go straight now if you didn't believe in a miracle and you didn't believe in Divine Healing and you believed your senses you'd say well you can't tell me that ain't real because that's real you know the story of even the the the um the I want to say Infidel but I think there's maybe another way brother Brandon referred to him how under that tree that day and he was talking about it wasn't really much of a Believer but he wanted to know what was it that told that man what was wrong with that lady say there's something that happens that get inside the mind you start waking up to these things and you want to kind of figure him out and so that can still yet be in that intellectual Realm now let me lay something heavy on you then believe then can be towards the right things and still be intellectual therefore belief can be towards the wrong things and be intellectual and you can have a mental faith and a lot of different things that have nothing to do with the word of God that's what a lot of people place in science their faith is in science you have to have faith to believe that whenever they found something or whatever and they put out this big huge Journal article saying we found out now that T-Rexes actually had purple feathers in the absence of anything that demonstrates that they actually had purple feathers and all the scientists are like they had purple feathers right they believe it then it's like yes purple feathers and they all accept it how old is the world well it's billions and billions of years old where did you find the clock if there's a there's a measure of faith that they use to accept those things and that's intellectual faith this kind of that kind of believe in that kind of faith can be even the carnal things and so this is I'm going to end on this so a sinner someone who is not a Christian someone who is not even before necessarily a Believer can intellectually believe enough to come to a place of healing intellectually believe enough to come to a place to receive an anointing to feel the power of God have an experience and that experience be felt physically and emotionally and even be demonstrated in physical healing Divine Healing God is the Healer and they experience healing and it all come up from a place of intellectually believing enough and you'll have to if if you're familiar with statements brother Branham says about intellectual faith and mental believing and those things just if you could uh I mean have faith in me that that there'll be there'll be some things that could be added to that to realize what realm that's operating in and how the person can believe and God will honor that faith and he honors that alone he hasn't sealed the soul he's not conf he's not vindicating anybody he's not given any sort of approval to lifestyle or theology or doctrine it's just something that God has said and it's put it in Motion in this world that a human being can tap into it and get results from it even to the point to where there are those and there's different ones that were so dynamic in Divine Healing they were called Divine Healers because they could take a group of people and so convince them over a period of time that the word of God was true and he was a Healer that there could be spontaneous healings in a congregation and people be healed instantly and they received their physical healing by someone who's tapping into an element of faith and principles of faith and they would go right out and who know who knows how long they would remain healed but there was discernible evidential measurable results that took place in a realm that was in the body or the spirit so this is the quote that we started this entire sub series on this a matter of faith and question and answers brother Brandon says and healing is based upon faith not upon now righteous how righteous you are how good you are how much you keep the Commandments or whatever it is it's based solemnly on faith all things are possible to them that believe it's not based upon how good you are and this is a statement he makes in a number of different ways to make this point I've seen prostitutes come to the platform this person is not sealed with the Holy Ghost he's using prostitute to refer to the fact that this individual does not have the Holy Ghost they're Sinners I've seen them come to the platform and be instantly healed and a sainted woman brother Brahm another place tells a real Christian real genuine Christian with faith saying a woman come across the platform and miss it and he says to me the most amazing statement sure is based upon faith if thou can'tst believe not upon righteousness so if you could give me if we could just draw this conclusion together as a way to try to explore this as we close there's a prostitute that can come up in a prayer line and not have the Holy Ghost not have a life a a a a virtue not even being a Christian but it's come by faith through the come through this process believing I'm here to be healed heard your Divine healer heard you had a gift of healing I'm sick I need to be healed that's all it is to them I need to be healed I want to be healed and they stand there with faith and brother Branham is able to pray for them or whatever the other laying hands of the sick using discernment whatever it might be and that person genuinely received their healing instantly be healed and then you have a sincere God-fearing Christian has the Holy Ghost stands before the same gift has seemingly come up through the same process and is not able to receive their healing and brother Brown says oh it's because of Faith he said well then you tell me the prostitute had Faith the faith that can move mountains the face of the faith that pleases God the faith that we the ultimate Faith or did she have a human faith that could operate in this channel to bring the results whereas the one who has the faith on the inside has his faith in the soul realm comes up through the line and doesn't get the healing they need it's two different processes Billy Rams referring to Faith and I think it's in faith of the substance says it's another element altogether it's an element in other words somebody can have that element and it's been something that's been it's something that they can use the power the energy of but it's just that element and if I could put it this way I'm just going to create this picture and then we're going to close the center as brother I'm saying it I'm just looking here at the statement he's saying it's based solemnly on faith it's based on faith so healing is based on faith so the the the the the center now I'll just have to amplify this more next time maybe even visually The Sinner comes up to the prayer line intellectually believing in the promise of God and believe in it enough for when it hits against the free moral agency and The Unborn again soul free more agency accepts it and what does God do heals them they believe that intellectually enough here that when it finally came down to the soul because they're not born again they've got faith and doubt they've got the three more agency to open up to choose to accept it or to reject and it comes down there and they've got enough intellectual faith for the the soul even the the human mind the human now not necessarily A Divine realm but human Faith come down and say well my I believe and there's this temporary alignment and God says you're healed come on and does brother but I'm not say that healing will last as long as the faith lasts but then break that get that discontinuity through some way and what happens it comes right back again right but as long as that channel as long as that person can intellectually believe and then in that Soul open up and accept it because what their faith is projected to is Divine Healing God honors it but a Christian who's got nothing but the word here right the soul is sealed it's the Holy Ghost the only thing that can come and hit that faith that seal of faith is the word of God and as they come up their soul has enough power in it power in it to create a world and go live on it and they're standing in line and brother bear says if you had that kind of Faith you wouldn't be standing here why because not in the soul but now in their spirit right that the soul has the word the soul has the faith but they're wrestling with their healing intellectually in the spirit realm they're wrestling with it and what happens the promise that he's a Healer can't get past the spirit to strike the soul and give them the healing right and so that's where the battle is for the believer not if I I'm almost starting to preach now because you guys are just kind of in this channel that's where the devil wants to use that to get you to start doubting in the soul Realm and listen no matter how much you try to doubt you can't doubt if you're sealed it's sealed so he tries to cause the confusion in the mind he tries to cause this wow I'm not so sure and then what are you thinking well maybe I'm sick because I made a mistake and maybe he's doing this to cause this and it's only happening listen you're doing the Choose Your Own Adventure in your spirit it has nothing to do with the soul has nothing to do with the word it's the wrestling you have in your spirit so when you begin to pray and now this is when Jesus says it's even in that Matthew 17 where they said well we couldn't cast this devil out he said but he says because if you have doubt he says but if you believe nothing shall be impossible he says but some things only come out with much prayer and fasting now that has nothing to do with faith that has to do with the spirit being aligned has something to do with preparing the human part to get to the place or say yes I believe yes I believe and to get your mental Faith to line up with the soul faith that you have so that now that Revelation strikes and it is divine that's why you can have a a sinner come to the line and be healed because they've allowed their intellectual Faith to be received by their soul their free moral agency and they receive their healing and then the believer struggles so much because brother bear said they've been drugged through so much we almost know too much about it right you're gonna tell me you're gonna come up you need you're gonna need healing and all of a sudden you're going to hear there's there's a prayer line you're going to come up in the prayer line you're gonna be coming up believing you're gonna get healed and all of a sudden you're like oh wait a minute what was it brother Aaron preached on Christ my healer about prayer lines laying on of hands am I doing something wrong should I not be here is my faith not mature enough and you're going to come right up there and just gonna be like you know I don't even know what I'm doing here because I'm not even sure brother Bram said if you have faith you wouldn't even be here so you think I have faith right and the backslid messenger behind you like man I just wanted man I just wanted just want the Holy Ghost get out of the way you're taking too much time you're talking too much I'm just I just believe I just need it whether they get besides what God I just need Jesus just to be delivered without any kind of shouting or Screaming it's just you can have it in the name Lord lay their hands on them boom a life's completely changed and you're walking away going so which part was it was it was it part six where he talked about the hands being laid on was it right got too much going on up here than to just take God in his word and the moment that you need it lay hands on me I need to be healed this is what I need for the moment that I'm in really in some ways you look at perfect Faith perfect faith is the faith that you need in the moment to meet the challenge of the moment that's that's uh if this was part four that's part three and a half there's still more God bless you let's stand
