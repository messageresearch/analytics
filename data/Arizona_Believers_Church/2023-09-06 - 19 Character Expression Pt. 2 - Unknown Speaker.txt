TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Hebrews chapter 1 verse 1 God who at sundry times in a diverse manner spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets half of these last days spoken on us by his son whom he hath appointed heir of All Things by whom also he made the worlds who be in the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person and upholding All Things by the word of his power when he had made had by himself purged our sins sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high being made so much better than the angels as he have by inheritance attained a more excellent Name than they amen God bless you could be seated I'm gonna just jump right back into where we were on Sunday and just kind of looking out over the audience tonight of confident that most of you if not all of you uh were a part of that service and know where we were at and we're looking at the uh subject of character expression we looked into uh character in the scripture and expression a little bit but we're looking at the order and the character of the Kingdom how that we are manifesting the life of God and in manifesting the life we want to be very focused on fulfilling his will or fulfilling his purpose brother Brandon preaches trying to do God of service without it being his will shows us that there's a lot of things that we could try to do and accomplish works that we could try to manifest but yet if it's not his will if it's not his order if it's not his time if you're not his person there's a lot of ways we can get ourselves in trouble and so what we want to do is fulfill his purpose God whatever purpose you have for me I want to fulfill it whatever your will is in my life I want to fulfill it and as we're looking at Hebrews chapter after one we're looking at Jesus Christ the son of God who God was the climax of all the types and shadows of the prophets and he's saying that in this last days he hath spoken by his son Jesus and then he describes him this way saying who be in the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person I meditate on that phrase in your own devotional time in your prayer time on the brightness of his glory that there was this is something this is quite a heavy phrase to me who being the brightness of his glory he Christ was the brightness of the glory of God and he says the express image of his person and that word express images the character he was the character of God so in Christ it was manifested these defining qualities or features of God they're expressed and made manifest in Jesus Christ and so in Christ we could say there was the sum of these qualities that Define who God is that would uh there's a manifestation in Jesus Christ that would distinguish in him from all the other prophets distinguishing him from anybody else so character is a distinguishing characteristic it is a a defining quality and brother Branham says the character excuse me the concept of God was expressed in Jesus so it's something that embodies God who he is his desires his motives and his objectives he said God became expressed in the person of Jesus Christ and we're drawing this phrase from the church age book Jesus Christ was God expressing himself in man to man so it was God in the man Christ Jesus but God just did not want to indwell Christ but he wanted to manifest himself through Christ to men to humanity in the sermon identification he said God came down and the character of God was Christ the very character of God is Christ this is the character expression that God was just not Christ wasn't just doing things that were Godlike or he wasn't just doing things that made us think about God or hearken to things God had done before but he was actually the character of God expressed he was the reflection brother Brahm says he was God made visible he says again God made visible so this is Jesus Christ the son of God he is the very character of God expressed and then Romans 8 29 says for whom he did for no so now this puts something in the mind of God or the heart of God being foreknown by God we are predestinated brother Graham takes from schofield's notes and says election looks back to foreknowledge predestination looks to Destiny and so here whom he did for no he's elected but then he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren if Jesus Christ was the character of God or he was God in man expressing himself to man Paul is using the same language to say that we too are predestinated to be conformed and transformed into this character that would also declare Jesus Christ or declare God who he is so we are predestinated to be another Express image a reflection of God's character there must be in our lives something divine there must be a deity that's expressed in our lives and and unless it is him in us then everything else is an impersonation so we have to have that deity in flesh in John Chapter 14 verse 12 this is this is still kind of part of the review and then I'm going to read from time tested memorials and I think that's when we're taking a step further to finish some things we didn't get to on Sunday it says verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also in Greater Works than thee shall he do because I go unto my father it's interesting when Jesus says this that there's not necessarily any list of works that he does it would be nice if he said he that believeth on me he will do a he give us a bucket list right or give us a to-do list it's always good when you have a list what do I need to do today and it's just kind of all charted out there so that I could do it Jesus remains I I don't want to say mysterious but he's just saying the works that I do shall he do also and we'd say well then what works are though is it walk on water is it is it multiply the bread and the fish is that is are those the works that we're to do also are we to die on a cross are we to be born in a manger there's there's things we might begin to ask ourselves well what are these works because if I believe I want to do these same works and then he says Greater Works than these shall he do because I go unto my father now I I'm just saying it that way so we can think about it and then if I could express it this way not to get into the details of what these works are but to get to the heart uh what would be at the heart of those works because brother Bram says God is featured in character that that and when he uses that phrase character to to me and brother bam talks about character in that positive sense and christ-like character and and having the right kind of character and character being molded I believe he's talking about an Excellence a moral Excellence an uprightness and integrity uh a righteousness to be as we ought to be and that's where God is featured he's featured in that in that in that a person's character and then he says that God shows his character by his works so so now we're going to be chasing our Tails a little bit right yes it's the works it's the works it's the character but then it's the character that is known by works Billy Bram says in time tested Memorials of God a man's character is made known by his works so when Jesus says the works that I do shall you do also and greater work shall you do there Therefore your Works will declare your character and God is featured in character and and it is to be to be conformed to his image is to be conformed to his character so there's first things first and then there's the byproduct of that I reminded of uh brother uh Bruce who worked at a nuclear plant and he said that what he produced in his ways we produce nuclear waste and Energy's the byproduct and sometimes people have it the other way around we produce energy but nuclear waste is the byproduct but no he's saying no we produce waste and we get energy out of it and now however you want to look at this there's got to be the character there and it's the character that's got to be producing the works whatever they might be so one is the byproduct not not at the beginning well I've got I'm doing the works therefore I've got character but no it's got to start somewhere and so a man's character is known by his works whatever you are your Works prove what you are and another place to believe by the ram says your life molds your character and and to me that expresses the image of what I say and what I do is is painting a picture it's erecting a statue or a stature to tell what's on the inside no matter how much you testify whatever you say Pro or con that has nothing to do with it your Works tell what you are tell us what you are inside now if you could kind of grab a hold of this for some of the practicality that we see in this every job that you do manifest what you are this ought to inspire us even as young men and and how we labor and what we do to do it right he says and you businessmen if you just do a patch up job see what I mean just a halfway job don't do that you can't do it right don't do it at all he's a very character of a person is made known in the works that they do and could you imagine us trying to Parrot all these accolades to God and his word and to the message of the hour and the power of God in all the great things that he can do but then we don't do things the right way even in our own personal lives and in in the way that we treat one another and the jobs that we we undertake he's saying this is part of one's character a man's character is made known by his works and in fact I say this God is no different he's saying here the way that you live your life builds builds an image of your character now James chapter 2 verse 17 and I just want to kind of point to this passage here where he's talking about faith and Abraham expressing his faith by his Works he says even so faith if the hath not works is dead being alone so works here is your deed your Deeds your actions it's activity of life activity that expresses life so if your faith does not have Works your faith is dead because it's alone that's quite a statement as Paul especially expresses that you know that we're justified by faith not by works and that is from God's standpoint he sees your faith and justifies you according to your faith and now here's the other image of that that if you truly have faith it is going to be expressed by how you live your life but and it doesn't mean that if you make one mistake you don't have faith but that's the goal of faith is not that you would just have it but that it would reach its full and supreme expression as it did in Abraham that it's there helping you and it's aiding you and it's doing things through life's journey and where faith has its payoff is in the daily life and so Faith must have works or we can just assume that it's dead brother Branham says in the church age book here it is it most evidently set forth that the perfect manifestation of God in the Sun as we're reading in Hebrews 1 as we read from first John in these different places before here is the perfect manifestation of God in the son was by the indwelling spirit manifesting in word and works there's uh this is where the devil would want to bring a division but here God's brother bam said no let's not let's not even play that game kind of when they're asked what would you rather have would you rather have the Bible or the message of the hour I don't have to play your games it's like the guy one time said you know he's just saying I stayed at the La Quinta and the person said no it's La Quinta he says you can't force me to speak Spanish hey and this is where there's people try to force you into a choice I don't have to make that choice and here he's saying that the spirit was manifest itself in words and word and works that's capital W so it's word and works now zero in on this is he's talking about Jesus Christ but think of this as it relates to us because we've read how whom he did for no he's predestining to be conformed to another Express image the perfect manifestation was by the indwelling spirit manifested in word and works so you must be born again and to be born again you must be elect seed yes if you if you are not elect seed you cannot be born again because there's nothing in you to Quicken and that is the only way that the spirit indwells you now this is this is uh I want to say this is deep and I think it is because it's these pillars go down very very deep to reach the real bedrock the Holy Ghost can anoint someone in their spirit and their flesh to a lot of things and they still they're still lost and and there's a lot of things that maybe could be the work of the holy spirit in our in our emotional realm or in our Physical Realm and that's not what brother Adam is pointing to when he talks about the perfect manifestation of God it was the indwelling of the Holy Ghost that manifested itself in word and works so in order to have a perfect manifestation the spirit of God has to dwell in the soul of the individual and that only happens by the new birth and then this spirit manifested in word and works so it's not just a a confession well I'm a believer I'm a Believer it's you say you have faith without works it says I'll show you my faith by my Works my work my faith is active it's living it's Burly it's got strength to it it's got Vitality to it it will demonstrate itself and I recommend looking at the sermon works as Faith expressed in Shreveport there November 26th of 65. it says a lot even about Abraham's Faith a lot of really good principles and he says this faith and works are husband and wife they work together the husband works with the wife the wife with the husband they identify one another and that isn't that rich this is Faith is not a single a bachelor and works better not be a single um you know party girl right they said they go together faith and works her husband and wife so you can't have the works without Christ otherwise it's adultery for Spiritual fornication it's a spirit of adultery and so faith and works or husband and wife they work together the husband works with the wife the wife the husband they identify one another this is a union that comes together there's something that's being embodied then in the invisible if we could say the invisible Christ The Invisible word the invisible Faith but now it's going to have flesh which is who you are and this is where we have a husband and wife uniting together faith and works her husband and wife they identify one another he says like a man says he's married and yet he can't produce and show that he has a wife she goes to a different school right yet he kept produce and show that he has a wife you doubt his claim so if a man claims he's married claims he has Faith claims he knows Christ claims he's in the word but doesn't have a life to back it up you can doubt his claim there isn't the evidence of God in his life you can doubt his claim because the wife to that the identification is going to be the works now I want to be very careful not to be too specific because there's a way that I I think I believe that we can be explicit I think we can be uh very descriptive even as the Bible gives things that matter our way the spirit manifests itself the message of the hour uh expresses to us the way the Holy Spirit can manifest itself or Express itself uh physically but in this part part I want to be careful not to be too specific because we cannot create a carnal evidence of faith because faith is its faith is faith we cannot create carve out of false security and say well I have faith if I play the piano and because I play the piano shows I have faith and that leaves a lot of us out or in line to get piano lessons but brother bam said God's works are secret and that's that puts a this there's something more to it than just what's on the outside he says that God's works are understood only by his people so this puts the context of works that's something again very special that he's wanting to do not something that just anything but it's something very special these works are very special Jesus says this in John chapter 4 verse 34. Jesus saith unto them my meat is to do the will of him that sent me and to finish his work I I feel that I could step into this without any uh prefacing because we're talking about Jesus Christ the son of God who is the express image of the Father the one that did works that said that we would also do those works and that he was the perfect manifestation of God in the son he was he brought he expressed God in perfect clarity as brother Branham said it and now this is at the heart of what Jesus was doing my meat is to do the will of him that sent me and to finish his work this outstanding characteristic that brother Brown identifies about Christ is the harmony that existed between the father and the son that he didn't do anything unless the father told him to do it he didn't speak unless the father had spoken he didn't act unless the father had showed him to act it was the harmony that brother man called between the father and the son it was a distinctive trait so that you realize that whatever Jesus was doing he was doing it according to the will of God and so his Works were in season so Jesus wasn't saying well the works of God is to curse fig trees if you don't see fruit and therefore we all are under this commission every time you see a fig tree that's not burying figs curse it but he did something that the father had showed him to do so you couldn't just try to distill that down and extrapolate from it curse any fig tree that doesn't have fruit those are the works of Christ I want everybody from here on out to know what a fig tree looks like and if it's the season for figs and it's not berry fruit you better curse it or you're not christ-like right we create this arbitrary standard where to back up a little bit and he was doing something to express something about God's character he was doing something to fulfill the promises of God and the way that he acted he had needs to go by Samaria because God showed him he did because God had a purpose to fulfill in it and this is this outstanding characteristic of Christ his meat what he lived by was doing the will of God that sent him that was his substance that's what gave his life meaning because we eat bread to have life we eat bread to give us muscles and to give us energy and we eat things to sustain our lives and man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeded from the mouth of God in other words it's his will that gives our life its substance it's his will that builds a gives us building blocks and gives us flesh and gives us energy it's his will that gives us the ambition says well that gives us peace I testify there's nothing like knowing you're in the perfect will of God and uphold you in whatever it is you go through whatever whatever it is you're facing because you know you're standing in his will when you're standing in his will and you come up against the battle that battles the Lords just as Moses came up against the Red Sea and knew he's standing right where God had called them to be and so he could stand there and face the Red Sea he said Lord here this is your job now could it be called it could be confident in his calling so brother Branham says this harmony that existed between Christ and the father exists now between Christ and his bride that's what he writes I think that was in the pick up your pen and write that he then puts into the church age book so this was God expressing this to us and he writes this in the church age book and this is shortly after him saying it the perfect manifestation of God was the indwelling spirit manifested in word and works he says when the bride will get back to being a word bride she will produce the very works that Jesus produced again there's those mysterious works right what what do we distill it down to how is it that if we were to produce the works that Jesus has produced does this become a line item list that we all have to kind of check the box that we all have to do and if you if you come up with that you're no different than the Catholics who've got the age at which you're to be sprinkled the age at which you're to be confirmed and everything is just already written out and I don't believe there's a message catechism we're trying to follow she will produce the very works that Jesus produced the word is God the spirit is God they are all one again there's sometimes there's a division that tries to come he says they're all one one cannot work apart from the other here's another Union of things we see faith in Works her husband and wife now he's saying the spirit and the word cannot work apart from the other if one truly has the spirit of God he will have the word of God and the way that he expresses this and the way it continues to express it in this particular part of the church age book is not that there are some manifestations to the spirit that we use as an Evidence but he's saying that if you truly have the spirit then the word will be there so the it's a word test not a spirit test so the test is is the word there do they what do they say to the word give them a word test what do they say to the word and so here he's saying if you have the word of God you you'll have the spirit of God he says but if you truly have the spirit of God if that's what you're you're looking for it says then you you if you have the spirit you have to have the word because they go together and so when the bride will get back to being a word bride she will produce not manufacture she will produce because it'll be him and her bring him to pass his word she will produce the very works that Jesus produced amen amen and the sermon the invisible unit of the bride of Christ this is very important to catch watch when the spiritual bride when she begins to have a Revival and then he defines what a Revival is when she begins to come back and line herself up with the word of God this is the bride's Revival when she lines herself up with the word of God when she will get back to being a word bride the word in her which is Spirit it is power it's life it'll produce the very works that Jesus produced so when he says this when he's preaching invisible Union when she begins to have a Revival when she comes back and lines herself up with the word of God that's her Revival says watch then again how the scriptures at that time there'll be a message sweep out to catch the bride catch that woman elect so there is a message to get our attention and as we begin to line up with the word of God that's our Revival and that stirring the stimulation of Revelation that word that begins to break up in our heart open up in our hearts that becomes the very Source of Life and Overcoming power within the believer but the Revival starts with the word the Revival starts with lining up with the word listen no matter how much God moves in your life never forget that a true move is built upon the word without the word it's nothing you have to have the word foundation when she begins to line herself with the word of God that's your Revival that's your source of life he comes back to it says but then the time that the people are ready to line up there's a message come forth and they line with it there must be a a taking hold of the word of God as Jesus said my meat is to do the will of him that sent me and to finish his work therefore for us to be another Express image there must be a will for us to do a work for us to finish and brother Branham says the proof of the indwelling spirit and this is he says more and I think most of you are familiar with these passages about the evidence of the Holy Ghost and the proof of these things the proof of the indwelling spirit was to acknowledge and follow what God's Prophet gave for his age as he set the church in order we have an absolute it is the word of God and this word of God has been made alive to us and made real to us and we must line ourselves up with it and he says the proof of the Holy Ghost you want to note the evidence of the Holy Ghost is when you have a clear understanding when you the Holy Ghost in you can say Amen to the word of God he always put the proof in the evidence back with the word because the spirit and the word are one so one thing it will agree with it's the one thing it cannot contradict it's the one thing that cannot be impersonated is the word that puts it on a whole nother level the proof of the spirit indwelling an individual is to acknowledge and follow so it's not just saying amen being sympathetic acknowledging it but also following what God's Prophet gave for his age so in this age we've had a message that's been delivered to us and the proof of the spirit is that we will humble ourselves to the word that has been given to this age not our own ideas not our own interpretations but that we would we would acknowledge it say that's truth I acknowledge it it's amazing just how uh with the this age of information that the devil can take any quote and and wear message clothing and say well I know brother Bradham said that but you got to know where he said it like great now I gotta know where he said it yeah you got to find out that that church had a problem with this so that's the only reason why brother Branham said it that way and you're like oh okay well I guess I can't read that one what about this one well you got to realize and you realize that we become subject to the message historians we've got to acknowledge and follow what God's Prophet gave for this age as he set the church in order I believe that God has crowned brother Brandon's Ministry with this that he dressed the bride in the word he's it's tailor-made for the woman that is going to submit herself to God's word it'll fit her but there's seven women in this age who want to wear their own clothing and eat their own bread and they don't want to dress themselves in the message of the outward because the prophet's the one that set the church in order this is the proof of the spirit indwelling the headship of the word is the only way to have life the headship of the word is the only way to have life because he has to be the initiator he has to be the motivator and brother Branham says that there will be a message catch the bride's attention when she begins to have a Revival which is to line herself up with the word of God and I believe that it's in choose it of a bride brother Branham says the true bride attack attracts the attention of God by keeping his word and in that same sermon that she's attracted to character but now she attracts the attention of God by keeping his word let me remind you of some of the statements we've read from Christ the mystery God revealed our headship is the kingdom the kingdom of God is within you the kingdom we are not a denomination we belong to a kingdom and the kingdom is the word of God made spirit and life in our own life bring into pass every promise in this day as it did in that day when the word in God Was Won so just as it was expressed in Jesus Christ Our Kingdom is headship is a kingdom it's the word made spirit and life bringing to pass every promise in this day so there's your promise for today bringing it to pass spirit and life in our own life he says and the world again has fallen apart this one's a real key I think we've read these many many times I just felt impressed to share them again at this juncture he says and the word is the kingdom this is the king and he's talking about the Bible the way he says it this is the king and Kingdom the system the life it's every bit right in here the system the order the structure it's all in the word of God every bit of the kingdom is in the word of God we are to be an expressed image we're to be the God's character expressed and the works that he did we're to do also brother Brown describes it this way I believe we're talking about expressing something in Expressions I've been pondering a lot about Expressions being on vacation afforded us different opportunities and fellowship and uh we're just here with the home Church you're just focused on what's Happening I don't make it a habit of streaming other services and we don't have maybe a lot of Fellowship that comes through uh being out here in the west and so there's sometimes you're a little bit disconnected from what's Happening and so just being in fellowship and be exposed to different things it really broadens your Insight to things that are going on and I believe the word is always orienting us and shifting us to make sure we're headed in the right direction it's always the word was given to us if I could just draw from this uh because I'm just very motivated by these things that we see in the message of the hour that after you had the laodicean church passed by envisioned to brother Branham and they were dancing and shaken to rock and roll music and they went down and descended in the darkness and brother Bradham is aghast at the pr what his message produced is this what my message produced he said then came the bride and she was dressed beautifully each one in their National Guard maybe they had their own way of expressing themselves they had their own way of manifesting the life because they were dressed in their National Garb they had the word in their language had the word in their life and as they begin to March holy to Onward Christian Soldiers and they began to ascend up into and take a step higher and a step higher and as they passed by but I said they're going this when he looks and now brother Brandon was behind us now in this Vision as he sees he sees a couple people at the back get out of step and if you remember why did they get out of Step they were watching the lady oh see in church dancing Boogie Woogie to rock and roll music and that's what got him out of step and he said get back in line because that's your Rising that's your power to rise above all the things well that's what's going to stimulate you is when you come back to the water I'm going to line up with it that's your Reviving [Music] and that's what's going to put flesh to this word and then the church age book Ephesians Church age brother says God's intention for his creation man is to express his words that's that's a phrase I've been thinking of over and over and over again God's intention for man is to express his words God created a human so that he could be expressed this was what God was God was always working towards flesh God was always moving towards flesh and brothers talked about how he's moving towards the kingdom the word made spirit and life in your life this is it this embodies it and he uses Adam as an example in Genesis Adam was given the word to live by him a life lived by the word would be the word expressed the word in works Faith Works is Faith expressed the word and works a life lived by the word is works a life lived by the word would be the word expressed if we have the word and works we have faith and works if we have them together then it's a life lived by it the life lived by the word is the translation the interpretation the expression a life lived by the word would be the word expressed that is true is it not but did Adam live by that word no because he was to live by every word and he failed to take heed to every word then there arose Moses what a great and mighty man he was yet he also failed to live by every word and that Prophet the type of the great prophet to come felt in Anger to obey the word and there was also David the great king of Israel a man after God's Own Heart he failed by adultery when he was tempted but eventually in the fullness of time there came one this is drawn right from Hebrews he says There came one the head even Jesus who also who must be tempted to see if he would live by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God and the bride is to come in contact again with this and you are to prove that you're not like that woman so we are under Temptation in this last days and what's the temptation to not keep every word [Music] then was Satan foiled for here was one who lived by it is written and that Masterpiece of God overcame by reflecting God's word in word end works there in the Temptation in the wilderness he resisted the Temptation by the word of God even in the face of the word being quoted to him even in the face of certain things being presented to him to show an image of what the word was projected about the Messiah as the Bible said he shall suddenly come to his Temple and here he was trying to bring him to a place to manifest himself Suddenly at the temple and he could resist it because it had to be in its season there's a lot there that I hope you could just connect those he says in that Masterpiece of God overcame by reflecting God's word and that's the only way that you can know you're overcoming is by the word then was this manifested perfect one given the cross as the perfect Lamb of God for the perfect sacrifice and on the tree he received the wounds unto death that we notice how quickly this comes to us that we by him and because of him might eat of the Tree of Life and then that life freely given would enable us to overcome and express the word of God this is where it comes back to the firstborn among many Brethren the Masterpiece of God overcame by reflecting God's word having fulfilled God's purpose for him his Spirit can come back upon the election without that death burial Resurrection the seed could not be germinated but now that he has fulfilled his part and done his work and he stayed faithful to have that harmony with the father therefore the life can come back upon the believer the life being freely given through the new birth enables us to overcome and to express the word of God and the word of God is the character of God and a life lived by the word is the word expressed it has to be the spirit the word which the spirit in life made flesh in our own lives I know I'm speaking a very general just general terms tonight but it's at the heart of any it has to be at the heart of Our Lives Christ the Masterpiece of God reflected God's word we too are to overcome and reflect Express the word of God if you look at Colossians chapter one I'd like to read a few verses about Christ from Christ is the mystery God revealed because Christ was the express image he was the character of God amen and says Christ who is the image of the invisible God the firstborn of every creature for by him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in Earth visible and invisible whether they be Thrones or dominions or principalities or Powers all things were created by Him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist this is a language of grandeur that is unsurpassed this could not fit any man this this puts it outside the realm of one who would be born between a man and a woman this is a description that has to only have come from an expression of God and at this at this point it is the image of the invisible God is as a creator of all things everything being created by Him and for him and he's before all and by all and there's just the magnitude of this is so great but now Paul brings it to this this head and he is the head of the body the church so now everything that is in heaven and everything that is on Earth has been set up as having some connection to Christ the image of the invisible God but now what he has done is he's taken everything in Heaven and Earth and he compresses it down to headship over the body of the church that now this is everything else that exists whether it be dominions principalities powers or Thrones and everything that's created he now wants us to focus on this this purpose this objective he is the head of the body of the church the head signifies the life-giver the head signifies the intelligence the animator the one that's generating the one that's giving he says that who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead then in all things he might have the preeminence and Broad Branham is capturing so much from that Christ must have preeminence please the father that in him should all fullness dwell and having made peace to the blood of his cross by him to reconcile all things unto himself by him I say whether they be things in Earth or things in heaven that's that's Redemption this is this complete image of a Redemption of things in heaven and things in Earth why because everything that was there he all things created in Heaven and Earth visible invisible everything is described comes back to the very purpose of God in the beginning of all of it that he might have a body and behead to that body that he might have preeminence brother Brown says have the preeminence to express himself through the bride as God expressed himself through Christ and had preeminence in Christ he now wants to have preeminence in the bride to express himself he's the head of the body and brother Brown picks this up he says God's Great secret mystery God's secret mystery he had before the world began I know some of you are just kind of uh mouth this as I read it we hear it so often back in the back part of God's mind there was something he was trying and was going to achieve and he had a motive in doing it in order to let himself be expressed so we see that all things that are in Heaven and Earth visible invisible where the Thrones dominions principalities or Powers all things are created by Him and for him he is before all things and by him all things consist but the head of the body the church is where he is expressed in order to let himself be expressed because first there wasn't even a moon a star an Adam molecule or anything he was God but he exactly wasn't God at that time because God is an object of worship there wasn't anything to worship him so in his great mind he wanted these attributes to be expressed and in him was love and him was to be a father and him was to be a son and it was to be a savior and it's in Christ the mystery God revealed brother Bradham expresses this beautiful truth that he wanted he loved fatherhood and the only way that he could be a father was to become a son this is that becoming God this is that one uh who is his always unfolding he had attributes to be expressed love father son savior healer and all these great attributes that we see already expressed they were in God and yet there's unexpressed attributes they're still they're still God still wants to express himself these attributes in Christ he wanted to express these attributes all these great attributes were in God in the beginning and he wanted them to be expressed I want to draw this back to God's character God shows his character by his Works Christ was the very character of God the Bible says in Proverbs 23 7 for as he thinketh in his heart this man is he's these observations of wisdom and and I'm not wanting to just take it completely out of context but this is a principle that stands sure and this hypocrite who entices you to a meal and to an offer and he says for as he thinketh in his heart so is he that this principle stands on its own eat and drink saith he to thee but his heart is not with thee the proverb is saying that your thoughts betray your words your thoughts what's in your heart betrays your actions so you can say something and do something but if your heart's not right it doesn't count because your character is made known by your works and if your works are pretense if your works or you're saying the right thing or you're trying to do the right thing but your heart isn't right because as a man thinks in his heart it's what's in the heart that determines the character of a man's work for as he thinks in his heart so is he therefore God having thoughts in his mind things that God thought about attributes that needed to be expressed that's what made God who he was and it's in that it's in the making of that flesh that declares who God is because these great attributes in God's mind that he wanted to be expressed these unexpressed thoughts had to take on flesh for God's character to be expressed and I draw this to a close we just have a couple scriptures and a few statements left to read brother Brown uses this in the church age book to express how that God had thoughts in his mind that he wants to be expressed these are God's thoughts thoughts that are righteous thoughts that are correct thoughts that are pure thoughts of Peace he had he took your perfect picture that's the picture he took of you in his mind that's what's being developed in your life brother Branham says in identification we are invited to have our character molded to his character that's what I want this clay that was born between a man and a woman I received my body and my spirit from my mom and dad they gave me nature and they nurtured me but now that I've been born again and there's a new life on the inside of me I have an invitation for my nature and to be molded and for my life my spirit and even this body to become subject to it so that he can put his mark on me he can put his imprint in me there's a this life that can be lived out through us it's God's thoughts being expressed Psalms 139 15-17 my substance was not hid from thee when I was made in secret and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth that's a phrase quite a phrase to describe what's taking place that's hidden to to the Jews the what the transpired in the womb was a mystery and it says my substance it's it's the very bones it's just things that are being made up and he says so that my my substance was not hid from you though though there may even be observable now the the formation of the womb of a baby in the womb of a mother and these things could be observed in tremendous detail thanks to science as the writer here is saying nothing there's no mystery to God in that he knows every part man has to wait for things to come to a certain place of development before they can declare certain things whether it be in the blood a certain stages and and they're waiting for it to present God knows it all from the beginning and he and he there's writers saying you knew my substance president was saying this even about Adam about Adam it could be said that God had thought about Adam and had thoughts about Adam my substance was not hid from thee when I was made in secret and curiously wrought into the lowest parts of the earth when I was being formed in my mother's womb but he says Thine Eyes did see my substance now that's not the same word in verse 15. in verse 15 it's speaking more to the the bone and power that's being made up of the person because mine eyes did see my embryo you saw me folded together it's rolled together as they would see this thing as something being rolled like a scroll your eyes did see me in seed you see my seed form your eyes did see me as an embryo yet being unperfect and in thy book in your scroll all my members were written which in continuous for fashioned when as yet there was none of them oh God God knows you by election he your substance it's not just what's been formed in the womb curiously running lost parts of the Earth but his eyes ceased the seed and God knows the life and the character that's on the inside of that elect seed that's all he says oh how precious also are their thoughts unto me oh God how great is the sum of them where are those thoughts they're in the embryo of the word where is the sum of them it's in the folding together of the election of the word seed that was down on the inside of you brother bear says the thoughts were there in his mind and that thought was eternal and had to be expressed when did the Lord see your substance this isn't the pre-existing of souls but this is the thought and the mind of God that are Eternal and real and he says in the future home you were made for an eternal purpose because you were the manifestation of an attribute that was in God that thought of you and expressed you this this is that got to make that so personal that you were made for an eternal purpose if you're made for an eternal purpose then nothing temporal can stop you nothing temporal can stop you and even if someone say ah well something did then that was part of the Eternal purpose nothing can defeat God's purpose you were made for an eternal purpose because you were the attribute manifestation of an attribute that was in God that thought of you and expressed you now he says and he made the Earth to take you out of it oh wow that takes this Earth curiously right on the lowest parts of the earth used to describe the womb a Jew would describe a woman's womb in this poetic phrase and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the Earth but what is it emblematic of God curiously rotting bringing you together and so on you as a seed of the Earth because God made the Earth for a purpose to get a bride out of it and he made the Earth to take you out of it and to make you a human being and what is the purpose of a human being God's intention for his creation human beings is to express his word a life to live by the word would be the word express life lived by a human being a life led by you you have an opportunity no matter how young you are no matter how old you are you have an opportunity as a human being to express the word of God Hallelujah he made the Earth to take you out of it and make you a human being that you might Express the word he says all these things about Christ who's in the image of God he is the head of the body of the church that he might have the preeminence have the prims to express himself through the Bride Watch how he comes to verse 26 even the mystery I know I'm skipping a lot here even the mystery which has been hid from ages and from Generations but has now made manifest to his Saints this is Christ Christ The Mystery of God revealed is to be made known to his Saints this is how he said that the works of God are only understood by his people he has to make it known by revelation it's made manifest to his Saints to whom to the Saints God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles Christ who is the brightness of his glory the expressed image of the person of God he has made known by Revelation to the saints that we might know the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles and what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope of glory it's Heaven's mystery of the Earth's hope of glory this great mystery of God which had been hid from ages now manifest to his saints that the Saints may know the riches of the glory of this mystery which is Christ in you the hope of glory amen brother Branham says in Christ the mystery God revealed it will invite our brothers to come to their instruments he says now we see the Promise being fulfilled Christ the true headship going in coming in his bride doing the same Works he did at the beginning and making ready and fulfilling his word as he did at the first in John 14 12 he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also then they head and the body are becoming one in works and in signs and in life Vindicated by God himself through his promised word for the last days he promised this in the last days now if you're spiritual you'll catch it I guess that's what I'll just say to you if you're spiritual catch it brother Aaron I didn't understand your sermon tonight well I mean if you're you're spiritual you'll catch it and I Know It begs the question what is it what is it let him show it to you if there's a 1152 sermons there's thousands of more bride members who are going to feed on that in unique ways and that's the beauty of the body of Christ is how that the spirit does something in you the spirit does something in you Spirit does something in you and when it's God it's all order and it harmonizes because you're doing something I can't you're doing something I can't you're doing something I can't but if we all do our part it just harmonizes but when I see someone doing something oh I want to do what he's doing I want to then we just start bumping it becomes chaos it becomes that chaos that distracts the bride in the last day he's but when God's moving and God's manifesting if you're spiritual if you have the spirit the word will be with you he'll give you Revelation understanding so much I could say so much more to be said about the spirit and how it manifests but this is all with the kingdom as the Bible says for this cause this is a Colossians 1 9 for this cause since the day we heard it of their love and their their faithfulness we do not cease to pray for you and to desire that you be filled with the knowledge of his will and all wisdom and spiritual understanding this is Paul's prayer for the Colossus church that you would be filled with the knowledge of his will and all wisdom and spiritual understanding that's what gets the gods God's attention to acknowledge and follow the will of God that you might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing being fruitful in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God word and works goes together Revelation and manifestation go together listen if it doesn't it's a single woman right if it doesn't it's just it's one of the daughters of the heart you've got to have the word you've got to have the word together with it it's with all knowledge and spiritual understanding he says that increasing be fruitful in every good work increasing in the knowledge of God strengthened with almight according to his glorious power unto all patience and long-suffering with joyfulness giving thanks unto the Father which hath made us to be meat to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in light who have delivered us from the power of darkness and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear son that's what we're a part of these are the elements of the Kingdom these are General descriptions about A Life That's to be lived out and expressed in us and brothers says what is that word bride the manifestation of this hour he says you're a reflection of the message of the hour the bride the manifestation of this hour is the bride not a Creator denomination but a living Oracle of God a living attribute of God displaying to the whole world the attributes of God in the formation of the Bride that's to be expressed in this hour that we're now living I've said this before but your life means something let's not make the mistake of just carving out a little Arena and when we gather here we're just Gathering to another Arena toward this is this is where this is where we express our religion this is where we we express our knowledge and the things of God this is this is our ballpark so to speak and this is this is where this is where we express it this is where we uh partake in our Hobby and our interest let it not be said that this is the embodiment what takes place in these four walls what our responses to the word that goes out over this Pulpit embodies this the life that we have on the inside of us but no it's to be the bride who's expressing the promise of this hour a living attribute of God displaying to the world the attributes of God if anything what we do here is where we come to receive energy and strength and substance and fellowship in the word of God invigorating our souls that when we hit those doors we can be living attributes so we can express God to the people I believe God wants to do that in your lives and in doing that I believe they'll be Souls saved in this Valley by the life that you live and the power of God that lives in your life and the Supernatural That's Unleashed it'll it'll happen by word of testimony it will happen by character will happen by your response to things and I believe God is wanting to use these branches use your life to get others attention it may not be a vast Harvest this is just a gleaning time but unless the life is being lived out on you you're not going to have the salt to catch the attention of somebody out there let's not be cultish let's live the life for others to see could you stand with me tonight [Music] if I want to pray with you thank you so much for your attention let's bow our heads in a word of Prayer brother Branham says we want to make this Bible our Looking Glass and let ourselves be molded by his character by letting the mind that was in Christ be in US you'll find that this character that I'm talking about only comes from the word of God in that alone we've got to be able to bring it back to the word Christ who is in the brightness of his glory the bride when she's described in Revelations 21 it speaks of her light and it says she had the glory of God that's what's in Earth right now this is the earth Glory tonight you a living Oracle of God brother Branham said it about Jeffersonville Tavern at Branham Tabernacle in Jefferson this is what Jeffersonville needs is thousands of lived voices he said that's the Thunder that shakes the devil [Music] that's the Thunder I want in our lives a life lived by the word would be the word expressed if you desire
