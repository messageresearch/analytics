[0:00] I'd like to say it the outset I really
[0:02] feel impressed in my heart this morning
[0:04] about the subject matter these Services
[0:07] have kind of been building together they
[0:09] all kind of Link together we maybe don't
[0:11] spend a lot of time trying to weave it
[0:13] together so that you see Parts one
[0:14] through eleven all tying together
[0:16] perfectly but I believe that there's
[0:19] just principles that have been building
[0:21] and I've sensed in my heart just a real
[0:24] pressure for this morning service I feel
[0:26] it's an important service several things
[0:28] have happened to indicate to me
[0:31] um just to that from even myself I need
[0:33] to be very focused and intentional today
[0:36] of yielding and getting myself out of
[0:37] the way so that God could speak to our
[0:39] hearts trust that you could do the same
[0:40] and pull on the gift as we look at this
[0:42] subject we're looking at for God so
[0:45] loved and then we know the preceding
[0:46] phrase we've really been looking at the
[0:48] world and we're at this particular part
[0:51] and looking at for God so loved just to
[0:53] examine some of these principles to give
[0:55] us a better understanding of the perfect
[0:57] love that's being revealed to the bride
[0:59] in the time that we're living in now and
[1:01] I'd like this service to serve as a
[1:03] foundation for next Sunday
[1:05] if the Lord does not tarry that meeting
[1:07] in the air no problem no problem at all
[1:10] I don't mind but if we're still here for
[1:12] next Sunday I want this to serve as
[1:14] foundation for God's covenant of perfect
[1:17] love he's made this Covenant in perfect
[1:20] love
[1:20] now in verse 16 here's we just read it
[1:23] for God so loved the world that he gave
[1:27] and so we realized that God is the lover
[1:29] and the world is the love Agape or
[1:32] charity love or perfect love is what he
[1:33] has for the loved and in this we realize
[1:36] that when someone is the lover there the
[1:38] giver and the loved are the receivers so
[1:41] we should look at that in our own lives
[1:43] that when we love someone we must be
[1:45] giving if we are loved then we must be
[1:47] receiving and maybe that's where
[1:49] sometimes the difficulty lies is in
[1:51] giving or receiving maybe we don't want
[1:53] to take it in just the way that it's
[1:55] being given or sometimes we don't
[1:56] recognize what's being given but we know
[1:58] that God is a lover and we are of
[2:01] beloved and therefore God is giving to
[2:03] us and we are receiving
[2:05] and there's this is an important
[2:06] principle that I'm just going to read
[2:08] the statement verbatim as brother
[2:10] Branham said it and then maybe you going
[2:12] in you could recognize these things
[2:14] in your own listening to the message of
[2:16] the hour it says when Divine love is
[2:18] projected to its object
[2:20] Sovereign Grace steps in and produces
[2:22] what is projected and so with with with
[2:25] love God's elective love has an elected
[2:28] object which is you and then a
[2:31] predestinated objective and brother
[2:33] Brandon says when Divine love is
[2:34] projected to you Sovereign Grace and I
[2:37] say to you but he's talking about just
[2:39] even an object Sovereign Grace steps in
[2:41] and produces what is projected so it
[2:43] produces Divine love it produces these
[2:46] attributes of God and so it's important
[2:48] that when Divine love this perfect love
[2:50] is being manifested when it's being
[2:52] projected it's to have an impact on the
[2:54] love it's have an impact on the very
[2:56] thing it's being projected to to engrave
[2:58] steps in and produces what is projected
[3:00] and so in this phrase for God so loved
[3:04] the world I've been saying that it holds
[3:05] this beautiful mystery of God's Eternal
[3:08] desire it's it speaks of for God's so
[3:10] loved it's related with what he's
[3:12] purposed within himself before the world
[3:14] began and after his good pleasure this
[3:17] is this comes to the very heart of God
[3:19] and not just go God happening on
[3:21] something oh I think I like that I'll
[3:23] have that but this is something very
[3:24] Central to God
[3:25] and the term the world we've already
[3:28] recognized that there are different
[3:30] worlds as the world of the ungodly
[3:32] there's a world that's condemned there's
[3:33] a world that's saved and the term World
[3:36] there can be used of a collection of any
[3:38] sort it can be used of mankind it could
[3:40] be used as the earth and its systems but
[3:43] the word word world is used of anything
[3:46] that has its own harmonious Arrangement
[3:48] and so this is and I'm sure you've used
[3:51] that term before that in the World of
[3:54] Sports or in the world of programming in
[3:56] the world of this in other words it has
[3:57] its own processes and its own
[4:00] hierarchies or rules and systems and so
[4:02] a world is an arrangement an order or a
[4:05] government the word world is translated
[4:07] to adorning so this is the adorning the
[4:10] ornament the arrangement that God loves
[4:11] that is beautiful in his sight
[4:14] and in the sermon God's power to
[4:15] transform this world we identified the
[4:18] world in the beginning that's the world
[4:20] that God loved his order his arrangement
[4:22] his Harmony in the Garden of Eden was
[4:24] God's economy of innocence and that was
[4:27] one of the dispensations the first
[4:28] dispensation was innocence so this is
[4:32] God's economy and when God has an
[4:34] economy it's innocent when God has his
[4:36] dispensation or he has a purpose that
[4:38] he's arranging things this is his
[4:40] distinctive Arrangement this is his
[4:42] system this is his order and this is the
[4:45] world that he loved this is an image
[4:48] these are the seeds of the world that he
[4:50] loved
[4:51] and as we could look into Genesis
[4:52] chapter 3 if you want to turn there now
[4:55] verses 14 to 16.
[5:02] we should have a a light that goes on in
[5:05] the back you know how like Krispy Kreme
[5:06] has hot and fresh or
[5:08] Little Caesar says hot and ready there
[5:11] should be a sign back there at the back
[5:12] that blinks and it says slow down take a
[5:14] deep breath breathe I was so excited I
[5:17] didn't sleep all night
[5:19] and if I'm not careful I'll just won't
[5:22] even take a breath as I go so I'm trying
[5:24] to pause here a little bit but if you
[5:26] look at Genesis chapter 3 verses 14 uh
[5:29] we're going to be reading all the way to
[5:30] verse 21 as we walk through this
[5:33] but
[5:34] when we read of the curse
[5:36] and and the details of this narrative
[5:38] from God or the conversation that God
[5:40] has or the direct comments he has to the
[5:42] actors here
[5:43] this was the closing of God's economy of
[5:47] Innocence this was a change of
[5:48] dispensation we saw the dispensation is
[5:50] God's ordering of Affairs and systems
[5:53] and God's Arrangement things to
[5:54] accomplish his objective and so as much
[5:57] as this is the Paradox God arrange thing
[5:59] and things in a particular way in the
[6:01] beginning
[6:02] and put man and the woman on the basis
[6:04] that they would fall to accomplish his
[6:06] purpose so when Satan did that which was
[6:09] necessary to fulfill God's purpose
[6:10] dispensation changed but there was an
[6:13] image left there was an image expressed
[6:15] in that original in the beginning that
[6:17] God is forecasting and trying to show us
[6:19] and we've looked at that in great detail
[6:21] over the last few years of what that
[6:24] looked like but now as the the curse has
[6:27] come in and he begins to speak to Adam
[6:29] and the woman this is the closing of in
[6:32] the beginning or that Eternal world that
[6:34] God loved there was eternity in the
[6:36] beginning at the at the end onset of sin
[6:39] time and death begins to settle in and
[6:42] move in and then there's this transition
[6:43] into the Fallen world that we know and
[6:46] that ends the beginning in the sermon
[6:48] marriage and divorce brother Graham says
[6:50] two covenants he reads Genesis 3 16 he
[6:52] says two covenants now that closes the
[6:54] beginning and it's so easy to skip over
[6:57] this I'm not sure if it's this morning
[6:59] that I have a number of statements for
[7:01] marriage and divorce and you say how do
[7:03] you forget it's because there's so much
[7:04] that we've breaking this up into but
[7:07] I'll say this now and I'll probably
[7:08] repeat it later maybe even this morning
[7:10] the sermon marriage and divorce may be
[7:12] one of the most misunderstood and
[7:14] misused sermons
[7:16] in the message and use for people's own
[7:19] selfless reasons I used to support their
[7:22] own agendas and maybe we'll get into
[7:24] that more detail on Wednesday night when
[7:25] we preach on Love and Hate but there's
[7:27] uh I want you to recognize this
[7:30] tremendous principle that brother bam
[7:32] identifies in this now that closes the
[7:35] beginning so there is a beginning way
[7:38] that God arranged things and then when
[7:39] that closes the beginning then that's
[7:41] not God's original way he says that
[7:44] closes the beginning of what Jesus says
[7:45] it wasn't so in at the beginning it says
[7:48] we got another Covenant now notice it's
[7:50] another Covenant so with the
[7:52] introduction of the second Covenant
[7:53] there's a different order arrangement
[7:56] government contract or different world
[7:58] that now begins to rise up or begins to
[8:01] come into come into seed form and grow
[8:03] so there's a something else instituted a
[8:05] covenant refers to an arrangement or a
[8:07] law or an agreement so when there's
[8:09] another Covenant now humanity is
[8:11] operating under a different order in a
[8:13] different dispensation
[8:15] and this is what I want you to recognize
[8:17] now and I this is going to expand maybe
[8:19] through the next few Services God
[8:22] institutes this second Covenant
[8:24] be in anticipation of the darkness of
[8:28] the Fallen nature of man
[8:30] that it's in anticipation he knows what
[8:32] the original sin is he knows that
[8:35] there's going to be a holy image that
[8:36] leaves Adam and the woman he knows that
[8:38] there's going to be a corrupting nature
[8:40] that comes in and begins to defile
[8:41] Mankind and so there's a degrading of
[8:44] humanity that's going to take place and
[8:46] so God knows he has to Institute another
[8:49] order in order to govern govern that
[8:51] nature
[8:53] do you follow that
[8:55] so now if you as you look at verse 14 I
[8:58] want to start reading through this and I
[9:00] want to call this the curse and the
[9:01] consequences
[9:03] and in the curse and the consequences
[9:05] God identifies
[9:08] or or reveals in doing this it's kind of
[9:11] like invert always invert or recognize
[9:13] now God's attitude towards what's coming
[9:15] up and how the second Covenant is
[9:17] anticipating change anticipating a
[9:19] different nature that it kind of shows
[9:21] us that God's response declares the
[9:25] value he had for his original economy
[9:28] let's recognize it's the very things
[9:29] that he says but it reveals what was in
[9:32] his heart in the beginning when he
[9:33] begins to speak
[9:35] so in Genesis chapter 3 verse 14 it says
[9:38] in the Lord God said unto the serpent
[9:40] because thou Hast done this Thou Art
[9:43] cursed above all cattle above every
[9:45] beast of the field upon thy belly shalt
[9:47] thou go and dust shalt thou eat all the
[9:49] days of thy life
[9:52] I want you to recognize all right I know
[9:55] that you recognize this I want you to
[9:56] look at this what you recognize
[9:58] and let's
[10:00] when we imagine the consequence and we
[10:03] recognize an upright Beast that could
[10:04] speak that could talk that could be
[10:05] articulate who actually had the ability
[10:08] an affinity with mankind enough to where
[10:10] he would have been able to communicate
[10:12] and then we know also to have Offspring
[10:14] uh through that Affinity with human
[10:17] nature so very very close to the man
[10:19] and it says when he's cursed
[10:22] he is going to change form
[10:25] and now he's going to be on his belly
[10:27] shall he go all the days of his life and
[10:29] he's going to eat dust
[10:31] so recognize that in the very literal
[10:34] changing of his form there's a change of
[10:36] form and a change of nature which brings
[10:40] the serpent from upright and articulate
[10:42] and intelligent to now he's going
[10:44] downward in nature and his whole form
[10:46] changes his physical form his nature
[10:49] changes downward
[10:51] and so now recognize the form in nature
[10:54] is changing and how God is signaling
[10:56] dust now and now you're going down and
[10:59] then in verse 15.
[11:00] this nature is going to have and I'm
[11:03] just going to skip over but in verse
[11:04] reading it but in this enmity that's
[11:07] going to be placed this nature will have
[11:09] hostility and hatred towards the woman
[11:12] and and when it speaks to the woman
[11:14] there's going to be this hatred and
[11:16] hostility towards that nature which the
[11:18] woman coming from man it's that pure
[11:21] Nature's God intended in the beginning
[11:23] and it says and her seed or the seed of
[11:25] the woman
[11:26] so is this nature changes form and it
[11:29] goes down whatever whatever was left
[11:32] before it changed that nature that's now
[11:35] been sown into Humanity it's going to
[11:37] have enmity and hatred towards uh the
[11:40] seat of the woman
[11:42] so now
[11:43] the woman
[11:45] when it says I'll have enmity you'll
[11:47] have enmity hatred and hostility towards
[11:49] the woman that is there's a number of
[11:51] ways we could look at this but we could
[11:52] say this nature the woman is the as God
[11:55] originally intended her to be
[11:57] so whatever corrupting influence the
[11:59] serpent has upon Humanity it's going to
[12:02] be against how God intended the woman to
[12:04] originally be and then the woman seed we
[12:06] know that's Jesus Christ that's the
[12:08] Redeemer he's the seed of Genesis 3 15.
[12:11] Genesis 3 16 is the manifestation of
[12:14] that so now when he speaks to the woman
[12:16] now verse 16. are we going slow enough
[12:19] for you
[12:21] we might just be able to have communion
[12:22] at the end of this service at four
[12:23] o'clock
[12:24] under the woman he said now he has said
[12:27] unto the serpent cursed are you above
[12:29] volcano he says unto the woman he said I
[12:31] will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy
[12:33] conception those are uh this conception
[12:36] and birth are very important elements to
[12:38] recognize here is it identifies the
[12:39] woman I will greatly multiply thy sorrow
[12:41] and thy conception in sorrow Thou shalt
[12:44] bring forth children and thy desire
[12:46] shall be to thy husband and he shall
[12:49] rule over thee now remember we're
[12:51] reading this so that we can understand
[12:53] how that when the God's first economy of
[12:56] Innocence closed and God institutes a
[12:59] New Covenant it's telling us how
[13:01] precious and wonderful that original
[13:03] world was and this is the world that God
[13:05] loves and he wants to redeem
[13:07] which Genesis 3 15 speaks of John 3 16
[13:09] which is God so loved the world
[13:12] now as he speaks to the woman
[13:15] I want you to recognize the consequence
[13:18] it changes the woman's nurture and
[13:21] relationship
[13:22] the nurture is the process of caring for
[13:25] and encouraging the growth or
[13:26] development of something and it says
[13:28] that I'm going to multiply thy sorrow
[13:30] and thy conception in sorrow Thou shalt
[13:33] bring forth children
[13:34] and then it says and thy desire shall be
[13:36] to thy husband and he shall rule over
[13:38] thee so he it's it's it's looking at the
[13:40] woman's nurture and how she's how she's
[13:43] expressing herself and what she's having
[13:45] to deal with because it says in pain and
[13:46] hurt and toil and hardship and offense
[13:49] it's this it comes from that sarcos from
[13:51] the pain and grieving actually is maybe
[13:53] translated to torture in some
[13:55] translations it's a vaccine that God's
[13:57] going to have to deal with or that the
[13:59] woman is going to have to deal with and
[14:01] so as God is identifying uh this
[14:03] different kind of nurture that she's
[14:05] going to have to experience and a change
[14:07] in relationship he identifies these
[14:10] specific areas of consequence for the
[14:12] woman
[14:13] it's important to recognize this if when
[14:15] I say it's important at least for me to
[14:17] be able to get my point across and it is
[14:19] in this relationship to her husband
[14:22] conception birth and I would say even
[14:25] rearing children
[14:27] that now there is this particular
[14:29] responsibility and burdened that the
[14:32] woman is going to be taking on to where
[14:33] her relationship to her husband the
[14:35] change in that is identified and then
[14:38] her conception is in sorrow the delivery
[14:40] is sorrowful but then and maybe don't
[14:43] amen too loud because some your children
[14:44] are here for some of you but then also
[14:46] the the toil and the trouble in rearing
[14:49] that this responsibility is going to
[14:51] come upon the woman and so God is
[14:53] specifically identifying areas of
[14:55] consequence
[14:57] then in verse 17 so now the serpent has
[15:01] been cursed God speaks to the woman God
[15:02] speaks to the man and unto Adam he said
[15:05] because that was hearken under the voice
[15:06] of thy wife and has eaten of the tree of
[15:07] which I commanded these saying Thou
[15:09] shalt not eat of it cursed is the ground
[15:11] for thy sake
[15:14] and that would be translated in some
[15:16] translations curses the ground because
[15:18] of you
[15:19] in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the
[15:21] days of thy life thorns and thistle
[15:23] shall it bring forth to thee and thou
[15:25] shalt eat of the herb of the field in
[15:27] the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat
[15:28] bread till thou return unto the ground
[15:30] for out of it was thou taken for Dost
[15:33] thou art and unto dust shout thou return
[15:36] I think that kind of speaks in a way
[15:38] where we could just refer refer back to
[15:40] that so it says cursed is the ground for
[15:43] thy sake and I want to say this not only
[15:45] because of you but instead of you
[15:49] the Earth that was which which man was
[15:51] made for over which he had possession
[15:54] and Dominion God made him Dominic King
[15:56] over the Earth God over the Earth this
[15:57] Earth that you came from that I gave you
[16:00] an affinity too by bringing your body
[16:02] out from the earth and dust you came
[16:04] from he says now that body is going to
[16:06] have to return back before the fall it
[16:08] never would have had to you'd have
[16:09] remained a greater than it and and
[16:12] maintained a kinsmanship to it as it's
[16:15] uh as having come from it your body and
[16:17] you would have been ruler in Dominion
[16:18] the very thing that man came from and
[16:20] the very thing that he had possession
[16:21] and dominion over it is now uh you're
[16:24] going to return to it and it's cursed
[16:28] and so if you read it you realize
[16:30] Earth's Nature has changed
[16:33] it's going to the the life that it
[16:35] brings forth is changed man is going to
[16:39] struggle with that nature
[16:42] and God is showing
[16:44] by these consequence
[16:46] that nature and nerd
[16:48] is perverted now
[16:51] it's going to manifest in the earth it's
[16:53] going to manifest in the woman it's
[16:54] going to manifest in in man's struggle
[16:57] and what he's relating to everything is
[16:59] changing now in these consequences God
[17:01] is showing that there's going to be
[17:02] perverted nature what is it doing it's
[17:04] it's going down it's trending down as it
[17:07] says as it speaks into the Bible when it
[17:10] speaks of Satan and Lucifer that did US
[17:12] weaken the nations in other words you're
[17:13] weak in humanity you degraded humanely
[17:16] by mongrelizing the blood and so now the
[17:19] Earthly mind or the carnal mind will not
[17:22] be pure but now it's going to mix be
[17:24] mixed with evil
[17:25] it's going to be prone to perversion
[17:27] it's going to be against God As Romans
[17:29] chapter 8 verses 6 to 8 say the carnal
[17:31] mind is enmity against God says it's
[17:33] death to be Carly minded but spiritually
[17:36] minded is life and peace that that was
[17:38] what Adam and the woman had before the
[17:40] fall but now the carnal mind is mixed it
[17:42] has fear and it has other emotions it's
[17:45] enmity against God cannot be subject to
[17:47] the law of God and we're not just saying
[17:48] the laws God gave it to Moses but God's
[17:51] law
[17:53] because it's a now it's under a
[17:54] different economy it says they that are
[17:56] in the flesh cannot please God
[17:58] now recognize this as we read it already
[18:00] I think it's obvious on its face in
[18:01] Genesis 3 17 as we read on Adam is not
[18:05] cursed
[18:06] brother Branham reads these verses and a
[18:08] marriage and divorce he says he points
[18:09] out look Adam's not cursed the ground is
[18:12] and so it's important to note what God
[18:14] directly curses in other words no what
[18:16] is a curse and what is a consequence
[18:20] because there's direct curses but then
[18:22] there's consequences from that curse
[18:24] and so in the sermon of the future home
[18:26] of the Heavenly bridegroom and the
[18:27] Earthly bride and that's that's the
[18:29] sermon itself because you've got
[18:30] Heavenly bridegroom Earthly bride
[18:31] there's something God's trying to show
[18:33] us he says God didn't curse Adam he
[18:36] might have done the same thing but he
[18:38] cursed the Earth thorns and thistles
[18:42] so brother Brown is deliberate God
[18:44] didn't curse Adam he could have but he
[18:47] didn't he cursed the earth now it's
[18:50] going to Bear thorns and thistles now in
[18:52] that we do see an image of how that the
[18:54] flesh is going to be bearing thorns and
[18:55] thistles and the flesh is going to have
[18:56] things mixed in it that don't produce
[18:58] the right fruits but this
[19:01] what God is portraying here in that he
[19:04] cursed The Serpent and the Earth
[19:07] and between between these curses here
[19:10] stands the man and the woman and this
[19:12] image is a beautiful picture of God's
[19:14] love
[19:16] because recognize that God doesn't curse
[19:18] Adam but he curses the Earth
[19:22] but in Genesis 3 15 he foreshadows that
[19:26] the curse that could have come upon Adam
[19:28] because brother bam says he might have
[19:30] done the same thing the curse could have
[19:32] that could have come upon Adam because
[19:33] it says the serpent who's going to be
[19:35] eating dust and there's a dust eater and
[19:39] that even represents how our flesh is
[19:41] being eaten by this and our flesh dies
[19:43] and man will go to the ground and Satan
[19:45] has a right to this body because of sin
[19:47] and it's going to mean man's going to
[19:49] die and it speaks how it's going to
[19:50] bruise the heel of the seed of the woman
[19:52] it shows that that curse bites Genesis 3
[19:56] 15.
[19:57] and where God could have cursed Adam and
[20:00] cursed him directly Genesis 3 15
[20:02] foreshadows that curse that could have
[20:04] come upon Adam and Paul picks it up in
[20:07] Galatians 3 13 and says Christ hath
[20:09] redeemed us from the curse of the law
[20:11] being made a curse for us for it is
[20:14] written cursed is everyone that hangeth
[20:16] on a tree
[20:17] drawn from Deuteronomy 21 23 how those
[20:21] that were executed were shamed before
[20:23] the people and hung up as as emblems of
[20:25] God's judgment and a shame as judgment
[20:27] under the law so notice that the seed of
[20:29] the woman in Genesis 3 15 he becomes a
[20:32] curse
[20:33] Adam is not cursed God takes that curse
[20:36] and he binds it into a promise that I
[20:39] will satisfy the curse that could have
[20:41] come upon you Adam and I'm going to
[20:43] satisfy it in the seat of the woman
[20:47] and in doing so the very bite of the
[20:49] serpent
[20:51] the very Stinger of death is going to be
[20:53] conquered if God would allow that to
[20:55] come upon Adam Adam could not have
[20:57] redeemed us from the curse but coming
[20:59] upon Christ the sinless one he acts
[21:02] differently than Adam he's acting on
[21:04] another level than Adam and in that
[21:06] comes Redemption isn't that a beautiful
[21:08] picture how God's portraying that in the
[21:10] in the the curse and the consequences
[21:13] so the curses and the consequences for
[21:16] man and woman
[21:18] The Curse Of The Serpent and the Earth
[21:19] and then the consequences for men and
[21:21] women require and necessitate another
[21:24] Covenant
[21:25] as we're reading here in Genesis we see
[21:27] that the relationship between man and
[21:28] the woman
[21:29] and the experience of birth and
[21:31] conception and birth and rearing change
[21:33] entirely
[21:35] if I could say it this way and it's
[21:37] turned upside down to what God
[21:38] originally intended
[21:40] and I mean that it's it's okay to think
[21:43] about that that God God had it facing
[21:46] one way
[21:47] and then once there's a fall it flips
[21:49] around the other
[21:51] and so now there there's some symmetry
[21:54] to what God desired
[21:56] to what's unfolding but we recognize
[21:58] this is not
[22:00] this is only there's only types and
[22:02] shadows in this because the real
[22:05] substance has been lost
[22:07] and so it's been turned upside down to
[22:10] what God envisioned or foreshadowed in
[22:13] the beginning
[22:14] and we know and we recognize from Christ
[22:16] as the mystery God revealed that brother
[22:18] Branham speaks of God's threefold
[22:19] purpose and he says manifested in Adam
[22:22] and Eve
[22:23] so God's threefold purpose in the
[22:25] beginning is sown into the image of Adam
[22:28] and the woman God has a purpose in this
[22:30] he's painted this beautiful picture it's
[22:32] in them it holds the mystery of God's
[22:34] three full purpose
[22:35] so there's this there's something that's
[22:37] in that in the beginning so God made
[22:40] Adam he formed Adam first made him melon
[22:44] spirit
[22:45] that kinship to Supernatural Heaven as
[22:48] we put it before and now he takes his
[22:51] body from the Earth
[22:52] and unites them into one being and then
[22:54] not only does he have that expression
[22:56] but he brought forth the woman
[22:58] then arrange them together and God was
[23:01] intentional with each thing he was doing
[23:04] and so as God originally arranged it
[23:07] notice in Genesis 3 16. that now after
[23:10] the fall and the second Covenant comes
[23:13] into being he says and thy desire shall
[23:16] be to thy husband and he shall rule over
[23:19] thee
[23:20] now you're going to have to kind of dig
[23:21] from and recall the things that brother
[23:22] Adam said that we've been rehearsing
[23:24] through several services
[23:25] when when Jesus says this when God says
[23:29] this at the close of the beginning and
[23:31] the institution of the second Covenant
[23:33] anticipating the the Fallen nature of
[23:36] man and to rule that nature that's
[23:39] trending downward
[23:40] and and to address the consequences
[23:45] of the curses and the fall
[23:47] notice he says and thy desire shall be
[23:49] to thy husband and he shall rule over
[23:51] thee now I'm not going to take time to
[23:54] amplify or Define the words that are
[23:55] here but let me just say this isn't
[23:57] perfect love of Harmony
[23:59] this isn't the Oneness
[24:02] that existed in the beginning this is a
[24:03] different arrangement
[24:05] these are different words to describe a
[24:08] different interaction if I could say
[24:10] that when ah and I'm just looking to see
[24:13] if we're coming to it uh in in this
[24:15] sermon we do we are coming to it but let
[24:16] me just draw the comparison now then in
[24:19] the beginning when the woman stepped
[24:21] forth God didn't say now you're to love
[24:23] your husband and he's going to rule over
[24:25] you
[24:26] but now after the fall something changes
[24:29] and God I believe is intentional in what
[24:32] he allows to be shared I'm sure that we
[24:34] could we could assume and and since it's
[24:37] just an assumption and maybe it's just
[24:38] something we do thinking about it and
[24:40] imagine it that maybe there was more
[24:41] done and more said than is actually
[24:43] portrayed but God is very intentional in
[24:46] what is expressed and what is left in
[24:48] his word he wants that part to speak to
[24:51] us
[24:52] because there's something that is said
[24:54] that holds a thought and a meaning that
[24:57] God has every scripture is given by the
[24:59] Breath of God and is profitable to teach
[25:02] us something about what God's purpose
[25:04] and desire is for ourselves and to see
[25:06] Jesus Christ in every verse
[25:10] and so God is going to into great detail
[25:12] to show us
[25:14] that after the beginning is not what he
[25:17] loves
[25:21] you're cursed you're gonna do this
[25:23] you're gonna have this this is what's
[25:25] going to happen and God is going to
[25:27] great detail to say none of this hat was
[25:29] so
[25:30] at the start but because this has
[25:33] happened
[25:35] he is being deliberate and intentional
[25:37] not necessarily verbose and with a lot
[25:40] of detail but he's giving us precise
[25:43] things so that we could know this is
[25:45] different
[25:47] the world that God loved the heaven
[25:50] Earth Adam and the woman all arranged
[25:52] United perfectly one and in harmony
[25:54] under the God's Banner of love
[25:58] and in Genesis 3 17 where it says to
[26:01] Adam and cursed is the ground for thy
[26:03] sake
[26:04] I believe that the significance of this
[26:07] cannot be overstated
[26:10] cursed is the ground for thy sake
[26:13] now I had to
[26:16] I intentionally chopped in half the
[26:19] sermon this morning
[26:20] uh because it's just so much I I it's so
[26:23] much I want to get to and I don't want
[26:24] to
[26:25] uh I want to be long but I don't want to
[26:28] be too long
[26:30] I wish I could just be a little taller
[26:33] but it says cursed is the ground for thy
[26:36] sake
[26:38] when it says ground the word there is
[26:41] translated to Earth I think in another
[26:43] place
[26:44] but this may not surprise you cursed is
[26:47] the ground Adama
[26:50] which comes from Adam
[26:52] which is the very name for man
[26:55] and we might say because Adam Earth or
[27:00] ground means red and it speaks of a hue
[27:03] and that Adam was named because of this
[27:06] this Hue or this color of the ground
[27:09] that the destiny came from I just want
[27:11] to turn that around a little bit and say
[27:13] the Earth was named after man because of
[27:16] God's purpose for Earth
[27:18] we might say well man is named after the
[27:20] dust from which he came but I want you
[27:22] to look at it that once man came forth
[27:24] that was greater
[27:27] right if
[27:28] um my son Elliot his middle name is
[27:32] Aaron and no one would say that I'm
[27:34] named after Elliot right
[27:37] uh because you'd recognize uh the the
[27:40] father that which came that which was
[27:42] first and so when God created man and
[27:45] spirit being and when I say I want you
[27:48] to recognize that God has a higher
[27:49] purpose for that so when the dust now
[27:52] are you are you are you all with me
[27:54] right now I haven't sufficiently
[27:56] distracted You by mentioning brother
[27:57] Elliot's middle name
[27:59] or maybe you started thinking did he
[28:00] backslide the last four Services he was
[28:02] never here he was in Michigan
[28:04] doing work on the farm
[28:07] living the life of an only child spoiled
[28:09] by his grandparents pray for us we've
[28:11] got work to do
[28:14] that when the dust now is being raised
[28:18] up into another expression and form for
[28:20] the spirit Heavenly being to be
[28:22] deposited into it the dust now is not
[28:26] Adam Adam is now elevating that dust
[28:30] giving it form and purpose meaning
[28:32] Beyond maybe what people you would have
[28:34] originally thought to the dust and now
[28:37] I'm just positing this and I don't think
[28:38] we need to have this huge Paradigm Shift
[28:40] of our doctrinal stances and now when
[28:42] people go to our website and says you
[28:43] know the church's purpose is to declare
[28:45] that the Earth was named for Adam and
[28:47] Adam not from the Earth
[28:48] but there's something now to be said
[28:50] that the Earth is Adam because
[28:53] named after man because God's purpose
[28:56] for the Earth
[28:58] in Genesis 2 7 it says in the Lord God
[29:01] formed man of the Dust of the ground
[29:04] that ground there the Adam the Earth and
[29:07] God forms man Adam from that so there's
[29:10] some Affinity there's some kinship to it
[29:12] and there's some relationship to it and
[29:14] brother Branham says this in the sermon
[29:16] uh the question and answers in that
[29:18] beautiful summer of 64. he says the very
[29:20] creator that created the Earth for
[29:22] purpose so if we could pause there
[29:24] God created the Earth for a purpose he
[29:27] created the ground the dust of the
[29:29] ground for purpose that's what his
[29:32] purpose is now brother Graham says Satan
[29:35] defiled it
[29:36] he defiled the ground
[29:39] he defiled the purpose
[29:41] Satan defiled the Earth's purpose
[29:44] he defiled the dust of the ground's
[29:47] purpose he attacked the woman defiled
[29:49] the union of those which came from the
[29:51] ground so it says Satan defiled it it's
[29:54] not just the ground that was defiled but
[29:56] it's the Adam and the woman that came
[29:58] from the dust that that they had their
[30:00] purpose that their Unity they had their
[30:02] Harmony
[30:03] because notice what Adam declares in
[30:05] Genesis 2 23.
[30:08] and Adam said this is now speaking of
[30:10] the woman this is now bone of my bones
[30:12] and Flesh of My Flesh
[30:16] she shall be called
[30:18] woman because she was taken out of man
[30:22] man is Adam
[30:24] and in this man becomes ish
[30:30] because now once the woman is brought
[30:32] forth from him she becomes the Isha
[30:36] so you have Adam and then when you come
[30:38] to the now that the woman comes forth
[30:40] he's not just Adam from the ground
[30:43] he's now husband
[30:45] he's now ish and the woman that comes
[30:47] from him is Isha now that's showing that
[30:50] God had in the beginning he had this
[30:52] beautiful picture in this Arrangement it
[30:54] just wouldn't be Adam and then another
[30:56] Adam but it would be ish an Isha man and
[31:00] wife
[31:02] but now as God begins to separate
[31:05] as it well I'll just say this is he says
[31:07] this is born in my bones and Flesh of My
[31:09] Flesh in this separation or this
[31:12] manifestation of Isha brother bam said
[31:14] he is portraying his showing portraying
[31:18] here the bride
[31:20] right we this is things that are
[31:23] preached often in the message and I
[31:25] think these I want this to become more
[31:26] practical to us
[31:28] so we we recognize Adam came direct from
[31:30] God
[31:31] and then God placed then placed Adam
[31:34] into the Earth so man's spirit being is
[31:38] placed into the Earth and then the woman
[31:40] from the man and at the very moment the
[31:42] woman steps forth Adam becomes ish and
[31:44] she becomes Isha because she was taken
[31:46] from the husband
[31:48] and this is portraying the bride so this
[31:50] is the purpose of God if I could say
[31:52] this God's secret or hidden love is
[31:54] expressed in the unfolding of the image
[31:56] in the beginning
[31:58] God's portraying a beautiful love story
[32:01] that you're you're kind of reading the
[32:02] cliff note so the short story of what
[32:05] God is now going to unfold in a
[32:06] different clay a different Humanity a
[32:08] different setting what God's going to
[32:10] bring out of it
[32:11] and so brother Bradman the sermon
[32:13] Paradox says God made the Earth and
[32:15] there's no uh no trouble there we can
[32:17] all amen that he made it for a purpose
[32:19] brother Brian said the very Creator
[32:20] created the Earth for purpose
[32:22] to take a church out of it a bride
[32:26] so this was God's purpose
[32:29] was to get a bride out of it
[32:31] so what he what he is doing in bringing
[32:34] forth the man Adam from the earth and
[32:36] now he is life in the Earth
[32:39] and then he brings forth from that a
[32:41] wife because God wanted to have a bride
[32:43] but before before you can have a bride
[32:45] you have to have a bridegroom
[32:47] and so God needed to become these things
[32:51] so as the as the man comes forth and the
[32:53] woman from the man it's portraying by
[32:55] the ram says the bride because God made
[32:57] the Earth for a purpose the purpose was
[33:00] to take a bride out of the Earth
[33:03] so keep this in mind hopefully this can
[33:05] hold and lodge for a while as you chew
[33:07] on it cursed is the Earth for thy sake
[33:11] there is a curse that is made upon the
[33:13] Earth
[33:14] so when the curse settles upon the Earth
[33:18] God help me
[33:20] to express how that now there's other
[33:23] seeds other seeds now sown into the
[33:27] Earth
[33:28] that are going to come forth
[33:31] and it becomes the Earth chains it
[33:34] becomes the Earth's blight it becomes
[33:36] its curse
[33:38] and the fall turned God's world upside
[33:41] down
[33:42] and the fall of the woman the fall of
[33:44] mankind interrupted the trajectory of
[33:48] God's word what was foreshadowed God
[33:49] creates the Earth he sows all his seeds
[33:51] in the earth parable of the sower sow's
[33:53] good seed all the word goes into there
[33:55] there's God's Perfect Harmony the banner
[33:57] of perfect love over the Earth there it
[33:59] is in its Perfection then Along Comes
[34:01] The Wicked one and he sells something
[34:03] else into the earth now this curses the
[34:06] Earth and in that moment as God is
[34:08] recognizing that his creation is cursed
[34:11] there's something that seals up that
[34:13] life into the Earth he says from now on
[34:15] you're bringing up a different nature
[34:17] gonna be a different nature until
[34:19] Genesis 3 15. going to be a different
[34:22] nature coming something else coming
[34:23] forth from this
[34:25] and so every seed bringing forth of its
[34:27] kind now after the fall God says first
[34:30] Covenant pause the second Covenant comes
[34:31] in now there's different Natures coming
[34:33] forth
[34:35] and brother Brandon this so this curse
[34:37] upon the Earth this is very this is very
[34:40] deep into God's heart purpose
[34:42] cursed is the ground for thy sake he's
[34:44] wanting to Signal something
[34:47] don't think for a moment that that which
[34:49] is flesh and comes from the flesh alone
[34:51] is that which I love
[34:54] because remember the audience of John
[34:55] chapter 3. the the rabbinical teacher
[34:58] Nicodemus who thought as long as I have
[35:00] the Blood of Abraham I'm in the kingdom
[35:02] and Jesus says no no no no this Earth
[35:04] has been cursed so if all you have is
[35:07] born of the will of man
[35:09] and born of the desire after the fall
[35:11] then you can never understand the
[35:13] kingdom of God because that is cursed
[35:16] that the world that God loved is lost
[35:19] now it's embodied in me the Redeemer and
[35:21] unless you come in a sinless birth by
[35:24] the new birth as I have to be born again
[35:26] from above from heaven
[35:29] so this comes very very deep to the
[35:31] heart of God and brother Branham writes
[35:32] this the heart purpose the Eternal
[35:34] purpose of God was to take a bride of
[35:36] his own choosing from out of the Earth
[35:39] that purpose was in himself I mean I'm
[35:41] annotating this and sown into the Earth
[35:44] and being Eternal was decreed before the
[35:46] foundation of the world but at the fall
[35:48] God curses the Earth
[35:51] it's no longer in the state that it was
[35:53] originally in is that not why it said in
[35:55] Romans that all of creation is groaning
[35:59] being made subject unwillingly
[36:03] that it did not choose its bondage it
[36:05] did not have a part to play the Earth
[36:08] was pregnant with glory of the sons of
[36:11] God and then all of a sudden with the
[36:13] curse it's it's sealed up
[36:16] his true womb is sealed other seeds are
[36:18] being sown into it
[36:21] and it's been bound and changed Desiring
[36:24] every sense to be loosed into the
[36:26] Glorious Liberty
[36:28] of the sons of God
[36:30] because the heart purpose and the
[36:32] Eternal purpose of God
[36:33] was to have a bride of his own choosing
[36:36] this was in himself
[36:38] and then becomes modeled as he creates
[36:41] and so for God so loved the world
[36:43] there's the lover and the love the
[36:44] original World of perfect love
[36:51] now this original world
[36:54] I hope that we've said enough to where
[36:56] you could kind of kind of just if you
[36:58] just can hold
[37:00] take a picture in your mind of the
[37:02] original
[37:04] and under Covenant
[37:06] the fall
[37:07] in this transition to now the cursed
[37:09] Earth the cursed serpent
[37:12] this man and the woman
[37:14] I I think the original World this
[37:17] original world
[37:19] had a covenant of perfect love
[37:22] they were one with God they were one
[37:23] with each other brother Brian said
[37:25] no fear
[37:27] no shame
[37:28] and notice those dynamics that if that
[37:31] the shame
[37:33] the fear and shame
[37:34] is it was never it never existed
[37:37] internally in either one of them
[37:40] but upon the actions of another
[37:43] and external it manifests and
[37:45] externalizes these things so now whereas
[37:47] before between the two
[37:49] could you imagine I mean let's just for
[37:51] a moment think of never having a
[37:53] misunderstanding
[37:56] with your spouse never
[38:00] like when they say does this make me
[38:02] look fat and you're like yeah kinda
[38:04] that you're both on the same page
[38:07] she's like that's exactly what I was
[38:08] asking you gave me the right answer
[38:09] that's what I wanted to know instead of
[38:13] like wait a minute was this a trick
[38:15] question
[38:16] and then could you just imagine never
[38:18] having a misunderstanding always
[38:20] understanding perfectly that when you
[38:22] say something and they give you a look
[38:23] you're like
[38:25] I love you too
[38:27] and this is what they had there was no
[38:29] there was no suspicion why did you look
[38:31] at me that way what do you mean by that
[38:34] right it was perfect
[38:36] perfect understanding
[38:38] Adam you're getting fat it's good fruit
[38:40] in here in there right like there's no
[38:42] it's always positive it's all
[38:45] no fear no shame no negativity no
[38:47] vulnerability in a negative downward way
[38:52] but now in the transition from the
[38:54] original world that God loves
[38:57] The Serpent and the Earth are cursed
[39:01] not man not the woman
[39:05] you're recognizing this in the same
[39:07] sermon the future home of the Heavenly
[39:08] bridegroom and the Earthly bride brother
[39:09] man says he didn't curse Eve
[39:12] but said Adam would be her ruler
[39:15] so recognize the consequence from the
[39:17] change of the original Covenant to the
[39:19] SEC the double Covenant catch the change
[39:21] in relationship
[39:23] and the arrangement
[39:25] as a consequence of sin
[39:28] the consequence of unbelief and I
[39:30] believe it's important this is where
[39:32] I'll revisit the statement this is where
[39:34] I believe marriage and divorce is so
[39:36] misunderstood and misapplied
[39:38] that God is controlling
[39:41] for the change of nature
[39:44] he didn't need to do that before
[39:47] but now in anticipation of the change of
[39:49] man's nature and the consequence of sin
[39:52] he has to doesn't curse Eve but he says
[39:55] Adam is going to be your ruler there's
[39:56] consequence
[39:58] now in Genesis chapter 2 verse 23 as we
[40:00] already read it this is now bone in my
[40:02] bones Flesh of My Flesh she is taken
[40:04] from woman I'm if she's Isha that was a
[40:07] declaration of co-equality
[40:10] when Adam says she is now bone of my
[40:13] bone Flesh of My Flesh he is saying that
[40:16] she is equal to me
[40:19] she is me
[40:22] as the word help mean beads second
[40:24] person
[40:26] like a second self this is this is my
[40:29] perfect equal but opposite my perfect
[40:31] command companion in other words Adam
[40:33] could not look at the woman as something
[40:36] different than himself
[40:41] this was him
[40:43] this is a declaration of co-equality
[40:46] when God chose the rib and brought her
[40:48] forth I believe he is just not wanting
[40:51] to give men uh Minister's sermon
[40:53] material when they preach a wedding but
[40:55] it's true that he took it from the side
[40:57] of manner
[40:58] that in this in this uh this harmony
[41:01] this the side he's going to be a
[41:03] helpmate so he's he comes from the side
[41:05] to show equality she's a help me to show
[41:09] the opposite compliment
[41:12] isn't that a paradox equal but opposite
[41:15] but they're equal
[41:17] they're they're equal in the beginning
[41:19] that when the woman comes forth for man
[41:21] and you have ish and Isha what you have
[41:24] is bone of my bone Flesh of My Flesh she
[41:27] is me
[41:29] co-equality brother Banner the sermon
[41:31] marriage and divorce says God at the
[41:32] beginning made one of a kind
[41:34] the Covenant was co-equal
[41:39] but now after the fall there's another
[41:41] covenant made
[41:42] now she was no longer ruler with him
[41:46] each must have a second Covenant
[41:49] do you do you mind if I just throw a
[41:52] little piece out there to make you come
[41:54] back for next Sunday
[41:57] in the image after the fall brother Matt
[42:00] says before the fall co-equal she's
[42:03] ruler with him
[42:05] after the fall a different Covenant
[42:08] he's her ruler
[42:11] when redemption's complete we share the
[42:14] very Throne of God
[42:17] ruling with him
[42:19] where is this going
[42:24] how horribly
[42:26] has false Christianity
[42:29] and a fake semblance of this message
[42:32] tried to change God's word to suit the
[42:36] agenda of a bunch of perverted men
[42:42] even for those who fight against it
[42:45] now brother Branham says it again in
[42:47] marriage and divorce first was just a
[42:49] covenant so when he says justice
[42:50] Covenant he's saying it was only one
[42:53] Covenant
[42:55] Adam and Eve was co-equal I have no
[42:58] qualms with the use of a singular verb
[43:00] Adam and the woman was co-equal one man
[43:02] and one woman equal
[43:05] in other words when you look at them
[43:06] you'd have to say it now there's one
[43:09] and someone for someone who doesn't
[43:11] believe God I clearly see too but I see
[43:15] one I clearly see I see one
[43:18] one unit one person
[43:22] I guess you know
[43:27] right like
[43:29] it looks like one to me
[43:38] thank you Levi
[43:43] so this declaration of co-equality
[43:47] one man and one woman now the woman sin
[43:49] and what does she do that through them
[43:51] all to death
[43:53] and God had to make a covenant by that
[43:56] another Covenant
[43:58] so it's consequence that forces this
[44:00] here it is right here in Genesis 3 16.
[44:03] he made another Covenant
[44:06] what's the other the New Covenant and
[44:08] thy desire shall be to thy husband and
[44:10] he shall rule over thee
[44:12] so when God's original Covenant was
[44:16] that that represented perfect Oneness
[44:19] perfect love perfect Unity
[44:22] perfect equality co-equal but now that
[44:26] equality is lost
[44:28] and now that there's going to be
[44:29] disparate natures
[44:31] and variegated Natures it's going to be
[44:33] across the board it's going to be
[44:34] different he says we need a new covenant
[44:37] to control for this
[44:39] now I hope this isn't too much of a rip
[44:43] in here but look at Ephesians chapter 5
[44:44] verse 29.
[44:46] this I'm I'm examining the single
[44:48] Covenant
[44:50] versus the double Covenant that's
[44:51] instituted after the fall
[44:54] God so loved the world
[44:56] the world of the single Covenant
[44:58] the Bible says for no man ever yet hated
[45:01] his own flesh
[45:04] here's where my lisp gets wet but
[45:06] nourisheth and shareseth it even as the
[45:10] Lord the church
[45:12] no man ever yet hated
[45:16] despised his own flesh
[45:20] now if I could say this if you look at
[45:22] Job 42 6. Paul must be expressing
[45:26] something very specific
[45:30] something very particular given the
[45:32] consequence the context
[45:34] as he's instructed we know he's
[45:35] instructing husbands love your wives
[45:37] wives obey your husbands in the Lord and
[45:39] he's kind of addressing family unit
[45:41] and but now he's wanting he's wanting to
[45:43] use examples as he expresses this uh and
[45:47] he's I hope I'm not saying too much to
[45:48] get you you're wondering here but now as
[45:49] he says for no man ever yet hated his
[45:52] own flesh
[45:54] and and it begs the question so no man
[45:57] has ever hated himself
[45:59] Paul must be be very very precise in job
[46:02] 42 6 wherefore I abhor myself in repent
[46:05] and dust and Ashes
[46:06] some translations render it as I I abhor
[46:10] what I said others say I hate myself
[46:13] and the context in the commentary of
[46:15] job's uh lamenting and is pouring
[46:17] himself out he said I hate myself
[46:20] I hate what I said I hate what I despise
[46:23] myself I repent and doesn't dust and
[46:25] Ashes so when Paul says no man ever yet
[46:28] hated his own flesh and here's job at
[46:30] least giving us something to wrestle
[46:32] with because he said no Paul said no man
[46:33] has ever hated himself
[46:35] and you say you know nobody likes me
[46:38] everybody hates me I'm gonna go eat some
[46:39] worms I hate myself and I was like no no
[46:42] you haven't no you haven't
[46:45] Ephesians 5 29 you don't hit yourself
[46:47] he's like no this is pretty real I feel
[46:49] this
[46:50] job felt it
[46:52] First Kings 19 4 about Elijah running
[46:55] fleeing but he himself with a Day's
[46:57] Journey Into the Wilderness and it came
[46:58] and sat under a juniper tree and he
[47:00] requested for himself that he might die
[47:02] and I said and said it's enough I'm done
[47:05] I can't go anymore now oh Lord take away
[47:08] my life for I am not better than my
[47:11] fathers
[47:12] he hated himself
[47:14] he hated his life he didn't want to live
[47:16] anymore Paul must be talking about
[47:18] something very very precise here
[47:19] remember what I'm tracking is
[47:21] co-equality one flesh Adam and the woman
[47:23] one flesh
[47:24] and now Paul is saying no man ever hated
[47:26] his own flesh but nourishes and
[47:27] cherishes it
[47:30] and then in John 12 25 just to kind of
[47:32] make this even more clumsy for us he
[47:34] that loveth his life shall lose it and
[47:36] he that hateth his life in this world
[47:37] shall keep it unto life eternal
[47:39] you better hate your life in this world
[47:42] so when Paul says that he no man has
[47:45] ever yet hated his own flesh
[47:47] he's not generalizing a person's love of
[47:50] self
[47:52] I do not believe that alone is he just
[47:54] hearkening to the fact that we all think
[47:55] of ourselves and our flesh and we take
[47:57] care of it and we don't take risk that
[47:59] would otherwise harm it or cause it to
[48:01] be put into Peril Paul is not just
[48:03] drawing on the general nature of man to
[48:06] want to preserve his own life he says no
[48:08] man has ever despised or hated it he's
[48:11] being very very specific
[48:14] because when he says no man has ever
[48:15] hated his own flesh it signifies himself
[48:19] who he is what he is what he stands for
[48:21] his nature his ability his power his
[48:24] life
[48:25] and so given the context as he says no
[48:28] man has aided hated his own self but but
[48:31] has nourished and cherished himself even
[48:33] as the Lord the church
[48:37] notice how he's turned it given the
[48:40] context as the Lord the church there are
[48:44] two examples that Paul is pointing to
[48:47] we're not we're not going to this is
[48:49] this I don't think this is dry for you I
[48:51] don't I'm just making positive
[48:53] confessions this morning
[48:54] I think you're all with me
[48:58] I know this is a lot of material
[49:02] but given the context Paul is pointing
[49:06] to two examples
[49:09] Adam
[49:10] because the woman was his own flesh
[49:14] and the last Adam
[49:16] the bride because the bride is his own
[49:19] body
[49:20] in Genesis 2 24 therefore shall man
[49:22] leave his father and his mother and
[49:25] shall cleave unto his wife
[49:27] think of this as prophecy
[49:30] now that the woman's come forth in
[49:32] anticipation of what's going to happen
[49:34] God prophesies therefore shall a man
[49:36] leave his father and mother well we have
[49:38] yet to see any children per se
[49:41] and the way that we would expect it but
[49:43] this is prophecy amen Adam shall leave
[49:46] his father and mother and shall cleave
[49:48] unto his Isha and they shall be one
[49:50] flesh
[49:53] now Adam and I hope I hope I can come to
[49:55] it today Adam no Adam no man no Adam has
[50:01] ever hated his own flesh
[50:03] the first Adam and the last Adam loved
[50:07] their own wives
[50:10] because they were him
[50:14] so when Adam looked at his looked at his
[50:16] wife he didn't look at her something
[50:18] else he looked at her as himself
[50:22] Ephesians 1 22-23 and he have put all
[50:25] things under his feet and gave him to be
[50:27] the head over all things to the church
[50:30] which is his body the fullness of him
[50:33] that filleth all in all
[50:35] so what is the bride himself
[50:39] it's his body who was the woman it was
[50:43] Adam himself it was his body no Adam has
[50:46] ever hated himself
[50:49] not the first Adam not the last Adam
[50:51] there's a reason why he's called an atom
[50:55] and what does God saying brother Brandon
[50:57] said after the church age book it was
[50:59] God's purpose to bring forth remember
[51:01] heart purpose Earth purpose
[51:03] to bring forth the people like unto
[51:05] himself that would be a word bride
[51:09] so she is him
[51:12] and his himself
[51:14] no man
[51:16] ever hated his own flesh
[51:19] is perfectly true when it comes to Adam
[51:21] and Christ
[51:24] that's what he's referring to
[51:26] I believe that's the perfect type he's
[51:29] pointing to
[51:30] and so the Earth as the Bible says the
[51:32] ground
[51:33] was made for the purpose of bringing
[51:35] forth a word Bride for Christ
[51:37] who would be like himself
[51:40] remember God's mystery concerning
[51:42] creation that there's if I could say
[51:45] this this is uh if I put it this way
[51:50] Heaven's Glory was Earth's mystery
[51:54] and in the beginning God created the
[51:56] Heaven and the Earth
[51:57] very first utterance of scripture
[52:00] God wants to tell a story of redemption
[52:02] he begins with these words in the
[52:04] beginning Elohim created the Heaven and
[52:07] the Earth Elohim the L strong one plus
[52:10] Allah Bound by an oath or a covenant
[52:14] making it come to swear it means the
[52:16] Covenant God
[52:18] created a union
[52:20] Between Heaven and Earth
[52:22] the Covenant of God placed them together
[52:25] showing the Heavenly bridegroom and the
[52:28] Earthly bride something he was wanting
[52:30] to achieve something he was wanting to
[52:32] express was a hidden reflection in his
[52:34] creation from the very first words
[52:36] honored of Elohim the Covenant God wants
[52:39] a bride groom and a bride that's what he
[52:42] wants to become
[52:44] in the sermon Christ is the mystery of
[52:45] God revealed he says now God's secret
[52:48] mystery he had before the world began
[52:53] uh forecast in Genesis 1 1 if I could
[52:55] say now back in the back part of God's
[52:57] mind there was something he was trying
[52:59] and was going to achieve and he had a
[53:02] motive in doing it in order to let
[53:03] himself be expressed
[53:06] to let himself be expressed you say well
[53:09] was Adam not expressed in the single
[53:11] unit yes
[53:13] he's expressed but then he's expressed
[53:17] in the woman
[53:20] a mystery comes out of him
[53:22] further manifestation and it's not too
[53:24] it's the same
[53:30] now in Ephesians 5
[53:33] 29-32.
[53:38] for no man ever yet hated his own flesh
[53:40] but nourisheth and cherished with it
[53:42] even as the Lord the church
[53:45] notice how if it's the Lord the church
[53:47] then he's do you recognize how he's
[53:49] created that that dual image
[53:52] and that that second expression where
[53:55] you have the man in his own flesh
[53:57] Christ and the church
[54:00] so it's not just self-loathing
[54:02] it's that expression of the wife
[54:06] for we are members of his body and of
[54:08] his flesh and of his bones there's your
[54:11] himself of the Bride
[54:12] for this cause shall a man leave his
[54:14] father and mother
[54:16] and shall be joined unto his wife and
[54:19] they too shall be one flesh
[54:21] Paul revisits this prophecy
[54:25] to show us the love of God
[54:28] if you're worried about how long I'm
[54:31] going to be there's no virtue and worry
[54:38] for this cause shall a man leave his
[54:39] father mother almost verbatim
[54:42] the prophetic utterance of Genesis 2 I
[54:45] shall cleave unto his wife and they too
[54:46] shall be one flesh he's revisiting this
[54:49] part this this Prophecy in the context
[54:52] of of the love that a husband has for
[54:54] his wife to see the love of God so in
[54:57] Romans chapter 5 verse 14 because
[54:58] remember the two atoms I'm talking about
[55:00] Adam and the last Adam
[55:03] no Adam ever aided his own flesh these
[55:06] husbands did not hate their wives
[55:07] nevertheless Romans 5 14 nevertheless
[55:10] death reigned from Adam to Moses even
[55:12] over them that had not sinned after the
[55:15] similitude of Adam's transgression
[55:18] so the likeness or image of atoms going
[55:21] over or breaking God's covenant
[55:24] or breaking God's law not Covenant
[55:27] breaking God's law so after the
[55:29] similitude of Adam's transgression
[55:32] who is in the figure of him that was to
[55:34] come
[55:36] because you have to recognize that Adam
[55:38] under a different Covenant was given a
[55:41] separate commandment a specific
[55:42] commandment to fulfill that only he
[55:43] could fulfill
[55:45] then once the second Covenant is
[55:47] instituted and even to Noah there there
[55:50] there's a covenant given
[55:52] man cannot break
[55:55] the law Adam was under
[55:57] so we have not sinned after the
[55:59] similitude of Adam's transgression that
[56:01] it says likeness or image of atoms going
[56:04] over or breaking and that though
[56:08] trust that you're with me
[56:10] I give you permission to wake up your
[56:12] neighbor if they're sleeping I don't see
[56:13] anybody's eyes closed but
[56:14] just somebody's praying
[56:21] out of transgression now Adam
[56:24] who is the example or pattern of Christ
[56:29] so the symmetude all this is getting so
[56:32] good
[56:33] the similitude
[56:36] of Adam's transgression
[56:38] the likeness and image of what Adam did
[56:42] in the beginning is a pattern an example
[56:46] of Christ who was to come
[56:51] Hallelujah
[56:52] and the Book of Job or in the sermon job
[56:54] or those looking for a job the sermon
[56:56] job he preached it here in Phoenix
[56:58] God so loved the world that he gave
[57:01] notice what brother Brown says so loved
[57:03] Adam so loved Eve that he went out with
[57:06] her
[57:07] Christ so loved the church that he went
[57:09] with her God so loved the world Adam
[57:12] went with Eve and her wrong she was
[57:16] wrong he knew the wrong he was innocent
[57:19] but she was guilty but Adam said ow with
[57:24] her
[57:27] and Christ looked at the church and
[57:30] knowing it was wrong yet Christ went
[57:33] with us and took our place Yonder as a
[57:35] sinner to die for us to take the sting
[57:38] out of death for us sinner how can you
[57:41] reject such massless love
[57:48] only if you're not the match
[57:54] atoms transgression
[57:57] the image
[57:59] and the manifestation that which Adam
[58:01] did
[58:03] in his transgression was a pattern of
[58:06] the one who was to come Christ
[58:09] says for God so loved Adam went out with
[58:11] his wife when he knew he knew she was
[58:13] wrong Christ did the same thing for us
[58:15] the Bible says in first Timothy 2 13-14
[58:17] for Adam was first formed then the eve
[58:19] and Adam was not deceived
[58:23] but the woman being deceived was in the
[58:25] transgression
[58:26] why because love is not deceived
[58:29] love is not duped
[58:31] love is not given over to infatuation
[58:33] love is not given over to lust love ah I
[58:38] got to get the young people involved
[58:39] love is not a simp hey
[58:41] love is acting deliberately
[58:44] right love knows
[58:46] love isn't he's not sprung he's not
[58:49] infatuated he's not he he's not just
[58:52] blind oh love is blind and oh oh he knew
[58:55] exactly what he was doing
[58:57] Adam no Adam
[59:01] didn't hear the sermon
[59:04] Adam didn't have the serpent talking to
[59:06] him to get him to receive something
[59:08] first in his mind
[59:10] and for the first settle in his heart
[59:12] and then act upon it Adam
[59:15] in the moment it's not deceived but he
[59:20] so loved his wife
[59:22] love was not misled
[59:24] love did not behave inappropriately
[59:27] brother Brenham says Now Eve should have
[59:29] been burned along with the serpent for
[59:30] their awful deed listen she should have
[59:33] been burned she should have been cursed
[59:35] she should have been cursed just like
[59:37] the serpent but Adam intervened taking
[59:40] her quickly to himself so that she was
[59:42] saved this was Love's Act
[59:46] this was perfect Love's instinct
[59:49] brother bam says another place he knew
[59:50] it was wrong but because of the love for
[59:53] his wife he represented himself with sin
[59:56] and was condemned by the same and cast
[59:58] out of the Garden of Eden
[1:00:00] there your prophecies fulfilled
[1:00:03] he left father God and mother Eden
[1:00:06] therefore shall a man leave father and
[1:00:09] mother to do what be joined to his wife
[1:00:12] place his seed in her bring forth the
[1:00:14] child that is the one flesh
[1:00:17] back again
[1:00:18] her DNA his DNA United back again
[1:00:22] it's prophecy
[1:00:25] Adam did this out of love
[1:00:28] that for this cause
[1:00:30] man is one
[1:00:32] because they're born Abode flesh or
[1:00:34] flesh because this reason when Adam sees
[1:00:38] that his wife is wrong he's gonna say
[1:00:40] honey I've got to save you in this
[1:00:42] moment
[1:00:43] and he leads father God he leaves Mother
[1:00:46] Earth Mother Eden he knows he's going to
[1:00:48] lose it in the next verses he's banished
[1:00:51] from his mother
[1:00:52] from which his body came
[1:00:54] from the womb of the Earth
[1:00:57] he's driven out
[1:00:59] cleaving to his wife
[1:01:02] he brother Branham says but Adam so
[1:01:05] loved his wife and he wasn't deceived
[1:01:08] but he loved her so well that he walked
[1:01:10] out with her
[1:01:12] a perfect type of Jesus Christ who knew
[1:01:15] no sin
[1:01:16] but came to the world and took the sin
[1:01:19] of his wife and walked to death with her
[1:01:23] this is perfect love
[1:01:28] is God not powerful enough to just keep
[1:01:31] creating and creating and creating until
[1:01:33] finally he wins the lottery and finds
[1:01:34] one that'll never make a mistake
[1:01:36] what love would that be but this is
[1:01:39] charity
[1:01:40] this is the headstone
[1:01:42] that comes crying Grace Grace
[1:01:46] when Divine love is projected to its
[1:01:49] object Sovereign Grace steps in and
[1:01:52] produces what is projected
[1:01:55] I've got to finish this at another time
[1:01:57] but I hope that you can recognize the
[1:02:00] place that this has in our hearts at the
[1:02:02] end time
[1:02:03] when the Bible says in Zechariah 4 7 he
[1:02:06] shall bring forth The Headstone with
[1:02:08] shouting's crying Grace Grace undo it
[1:02:11] this is not theology this is not history
[1:02:14] this is the bride's lover
[1:02:17] brother said but now we come to the Head
[1:02:19] the Capstone Grace Grace that it must be
[1:02:23] divine love being projected
[1:02:25] [Music]
[1:02:27] it's all in the last days when this
[1:02:31] great mystery that God had in his heart
[1:02:33] is being revealed
[1:02:36] for no man ever yet hated his own flesh
[1:02:39] this is a great mystery
[1:02:41] but I speak concerning Christ in the
[1:02:44] church is it plain to you
[1:02:46] do you see it do you recognize what
[1:02:49] layers the message is opening up to us
[1:02:51] as we read Ephesians 5 this is so much
[1:02:54] greater than any wedding vow has ever
[1:02:57] been tried to pretend to be this is
[1:03:00] something Eternal this is something
[1:03:02] beautiful that God is trying to get us
[1:03:04] to see this is a great mystery of the
[1:03:08] one flesh that man no man has ever hated
[1:03:10] God so loved the world that in her
[1:03:14] darkest moment in her weakest time in
[1:03:17] the darkest the church has ever been for
[1:03:20] God so loved that in the last days the
[1:03:23] great mystery that God had in his heart
[1:03:24] is being revealed
[1:03:28] for the husband is the head of the wife
[1:03:31] even as Christ is the head of the church
[1:03:34] Ephesians 5 23 and is the savior of the
[1:03:38] body
[1:03:40] I haven't even been going long
[1:03:42] I've had Wednesday nights longer than
[1:03:43] this
[1:03:47] Christ is the head of the church
[1:03:49] he is the savior of the body
[1:03:51] I want to come back to this very scene
[1:03:55] of Adam and the figure of Christ at a
[1:03:59] later time
[1:04:00] but Christ is the Capstone
[1:04:03] he is Charity his perfect love
[1:04:06] and then he is a savior
[1:04:09] so now this is important when Christ
[1:04:13] when
[1:04:16] under the second Covenant
[1:04:18] thy desire shall be to your husband
[1:04:21] such a peculiar statement but it makes
[1:04:23] sense given the Fallen nature that
[1:04:26] arises
[1:04:29] and he shall have rule over thee
[1:04:31] Brothers said that's different than the
[1:04:33] original one original is co-equal
[1:04:36] now this is different
[1:04:38] but when Paul says Christ is the head
[1:04:41] when he establishes Christ's headship he
[1:04:43] then defines what headship means
[1:04:46] the head is the savior the deliverer the
[1:04:48] preserver
[1:04:49] the one who keeps safe and sound and
[1:04:51] makes well
[1:04:52] the head gives life it nurtures it
[1:04:54] brings up it feeds it tenderly cares for
[1:04:56] it Fosters with Tinder care the head
[1:04:58] gives life to the body to raise it up
[1:05:01] it restores it it revives it it raptures
[1:05:04] it
[1:05:05] the head we think the head brings under
[1:05:08] subjection right
[1:05:09] the head is to to cause subjection the
[1:05:12] headers to to create order in hierarchy
[1:05:15] no
[1:05:16] no the hand is to give life
[1:05:18] the head is to raise up
[1:05:20] the head is to to to heal
[1:05:23] that that's what the the that's what the
[1:05:25] purpose of the head is it's not to
[1:05:28] dominate and Rule it's to restore it's
[1:05:30] to revive
[1:05:31] and brother Branham says in Christ is a
[1:05:33] mystery God revealed and now to the
[1:05:34] Christ in the church is just being made
[1:05:36] known
[1:05:37] the head
[1:05:38] the whole thing is the revelation of God
[1:05:41] to take Eve back to a right position
[1:05:44] again with her husband
[1:05:47] you read right over that it went right
[1:05:49] over your head didn't it
[1:05:51] remember what we just read about Adam
[1:05:53] in Christ
[1:05:55] that when she knew she was wrong she had
[1:05:57] played the part of the adulterer
[1:05:59] she had broke the marriage vowed the
[1:06:02] union vow and now he says it's a
[1:06:04] revelation of God
[1:06:06] to take it back
[1:06:11] what is that it's a language of
[1:06:12] restoration
[1:06:14] it's a language of forgiveness
[1:06:17] do you recognize that
[1:06:19] I know I've done wrong would you have me
[1:06:21] back
[1:06:22] I know I've made a mistake would you
[1:06:24] take me back maybe I'm trying to get you
[1:06:26] to think of in terms of maybe in a
[1:06:28] worldly relationship or relationships
[1:06:30] where somebody does something wrong and
[1:06:32] the person ascends against him and
[1:06:34] breaks the vow and now this is it this
[1:06:36] is over how can we can continue the
[1:06:39] question is would you take me back
[1:06:41] and what is it this is what he says
[1:06:43] because he says take her back again
[1:06:48] to take her back
[1:06:50] to a right position again with her
[1:06:53] husband
[1:06:55] he said the whole thing of the
[1:06:56] revelation of God
[1:06:58] so what does God do he reveals perfect
[1:07:01] love
[1:07:03] to take you back
[1:07:07] and focusing so much maybe
[1:07:09] chronologically or this paradise this
[1:07:11] Eden that existed historically we miss
[1:07:13] the significance of what Eden what was
[1:07:16] represented in Eden that in the Eden
[1:07:18] before eternity had completely slipped
[1:07:20] away Adam's taking you back woman
[1:07:24] taking you back
[1:07:26] and now in the end time
[1:07:29] God says I'm going to take her back
[1:07:31] again to spider sin to spider condition
[1:07:33] and brother Branham says now to the life
[1:07:36] and the body is a Vindication of the
[1:07:37] raptures at hand
[1:07:39] when you see the headship and the body
[1:07:40] becoming one and the fullness of the
[1:07:43] measure of his manifestation shows that
[1:07:45] the body is about to be received to the
[1:07:47] headship or he's referring to the
[1:07:48] kingdom when he's talking about that
[1:07:52] I hope that you can understand
[1:07:55] the reason why I've transitioned into
[1:07:58] these things we all we so often maybe
[1:08:00] hear it in this theological sense but
[1:08:03] this is so real in the sense of the love
[1:08:05] that Christ had for you that when he
[1:08:07] starts talking about Christ and the
[1:08:10] bride and then taking her back
[1:08:13] because Christ found that his bride had
[1:08:15] fallen
[1:08:16] so now when he says take your back
[1:08:19] it has an example of a millennial Reign
[1:08:21] it has a type of the future Kingdom but
[1:08:24] before anyone that could ever happen he
[1:08:27] has to take you back again to a Garden
[1:08:29] of Eden condition
[1:08:31] he's got to take you back again to stand
[1:08:34] his husband and wife
[1:08:36] so he says he has begun to give life
[1:08:38] unto his body why because he is the head
[1:08:40] and the savior of the body he's acting
[1:08:43] out the part of Adam he begins to give
[1:08:45] life to his body why the one that he's
[1:08:47] redeemed the mediatorial work is done I
[1:08:50] know that's a hard saying he's bringing
[1:08:52] life to a body in the Vindication for a
[1:08:54] rapture
[1:08:56] and then what is he says oh if the
[1:08:58] church only knew its position
[1:09:01] it will one day then the Rapture will go
[1:09:05] when it knows what it is
[1:09:09] it's a love story
[1:09:11] it's perfect love
[1:09:16] if I could say it this way he is your
[1:09:18] head
[1:09:19] and you are his heart
[1:09:22] mutually dependent
[1:09:24] equally alive and vital
[1:09:27] this is the Revelation that he's wanting
[1:09:29] to bring to us to us
[1:09:31] if our brothers could come to their
[1:09:32] instruments
[1:09:33] I close with the statement from this
[1:09:35] sermon
[1:09:37] and and I hope I can summarize this
[1:09:40] morning to you
[1:09:42] I want you to understand we're at a
[1:09:44] pause now in this service
[1:09:46] I'll take a step back Wednesday night
[1:09:48] and deal with hatred
[1:09:50] he says no man had ever yet hated his
[1:09:52] own flesh and deal with hate
[1:09:55] and how that when it comes to filio
[1:09:58] there's this perversion of Love and Hate
[1:10:01] but in agape
[1:10:03] hatred has a very precise and specific
[1:10:05] context
[1:10:07] and and it's uh
[1:10:10] it's a clause under perfect love that's
[1:10:12] not easily exercised
[1:10:14] and and maybe you could begin to think
[1:10:15] about that
[1:10:16] but I'm coming to a pause
[1:10:18] before we look at the original Covenant
[1:10:20] of perfect love
[1:10:22] and what we've seen in the world in the
[1:10:24] beginning
[1:10:26] is how that Adam
[1:10:28] acts in the moment
[1:10:31] and what he did for Eve to preserve her
[1:10:32] she should have been condemned with the
[1:10:34] serpent
[1:10:35] she should have been cursed with the
[1:10:36] Earth she should have been cursed with
[1:10:38] the serpent
[1:10:40] but Adam
[1:10:42] before
[1:10:43] God before there's ever a chance Adam
[1:10:46] does something very specific he says and
[1:10:49] that's in the figure of Christ
[1:10:52] and then brother Branham Satan in this
[1:10:54] last days
[1:10:55] and if I could say this we know that
[1:10:57] brother Branham was under a vow to not
[1:10:59] say too much
[1:11:01] and so as he's preaching Christ as the
[1:11:03] mystery of God revealed
[1:11:05] he's preaching that seventh seal in such
[1:11:07] beautiful detail
[1:11:09] and and he's trying to express a picture
[1:11:12] that I believe he sees so vividly
[1:11:15] and he's wanting to convey it in a
[1:11:16] language that hopefully the bride can
[1:11:18] catch
[1:11:19] that's why it goes to length to start
[1:11:21] calling us bride so that you'll
[1:11:22] understand why change of relationship
[1:11:24] there was a language that was used as
[1:11:27] consequence of a double Covenant being
[1:11:29] introduced but then as the seals are
[1:11:31] being opened language changes
[1:11:35] brother Branham
[1:11:37] in this great sermon Christ is the
[1:11:39] mystery of God revealed this great
[1:11:41] mystery that was once in God's heart
[1:11:43] he says secondly the manifested Christ
[1:11:46] in you
[1:11:48] the hope of glory
[1:11:49] that great manifested God in Christ now
[1:11:52] Christ
[1:11:53] manifested in you
[1:11:56] he goes we'll hurry look
[1:11:59] what was once God's Secret
[1:12:01] great mysterious Secret in his mind is
[1:12:04] now put in the hearts of the believer
[1:12:07] the body of Christ
[1:12:09] so what was once in his heart is now in
[1:12:12] your heart
[1:12:14] beating together now
[1:12:16] one flesh
[1:12:18] what was once God's Great Secret in his
[1:12:20] mind
[1:12:21] [Music]
[1:12:23] before the foundation of the world is
[1:12:25] now made manifest think of it
[1:12:28] are you thinking about it
[1:12:31] what are my inspiration
[1:12:35] message preaches
[1:12:37] it's coming from invisible units coming
[1:12:38] from future home it's coming from
[1:12:40] marriage and divorce this is the
[1:12:41] inspiration he says and he said do you
[1:12:43] get it do you get it
[1:12:45] can you understand why I preach what I
[1:12:47] preached you see you see what these
[1:12:49] things mean and he says oh my I'm sure
[1:12:52] we don't
[1:12:52] we don't get it
[1:12:54] well I can't see it the way I I ought to
[1:12:57] and I'm sure you don't
[1:12:59] and everybody's like yep
[1:13:02] but God's great mystery
[1:13:04] what the Eternal God had as a mystery
[1:13:08] has now been unfolded in Jesus Christ
[1:13:11] and they give it right down to his
[1:13:13] church what was once and God's mind is
[1:13:16] now in the body of Christ
[1:13:20] and this is perfect love
[1:13:24] this is an act of redemption
[1:13:27] Jesus making love to the church's bride
[1:13:29] Whispering secrets to her you know how
[1:13:32] much you tell your wife things you know
[1:13:33] the little girl you're going to marry
[1:13:35] you love her so much just tell her the
[1:13:36] secrets and get up next to you and love
[1:13:38] you and everything you know how it is
[1:13:42] that's what God Christ is doing to the
[1:13:44] church he's letting her know the secrets
[1:13:46] just the secrets not these flirters I
[1:13:48] mean his wife
[1:13:50] all right now look no by having the
[1:13:53] revelation of a secret made known to
[1:13:55] them by his grace
[1:13:57] Divine love being projected
[1:14:00] how the grace of God he goes people I
[1:14:02] know it
[1:14:03] and then this this this pause I hope you
[1:14:07] don't think this sounds personal to a
[1:14:09] bunch of people or this or that was he
[1:14:11] taught the way that he's describing this
[1:14:13] he's but the secret that God is sharing
[1:14:15] with the whole church
[1:14:17] if they just would receive it
[1:14:20] it doesn't mean just me or just you it
[1:14:22] means the church
[1:14:24] that he's trying to get into it
[1:14:29] if you've ever wondered if he'd take you
[1:14:31] back
[1:14:32] he does
[1:14:35] he will
[1:14:37] that's perfect love
[1:14:40] would he do it
[1:14:42] yes
[1:14:44] he has to
[1:14:45] you're him
[1:14:48] he can't deny you
[1:14:51] he can't turn you away
[1:14:53] why it's perfect love
[1:14:55] if it was my filio
[1:14:57] no doubt any one of us would say after a
[1:15:00] while there'd be a a callous a hardness
[1:15:03] we would have to say just to save
[1:15:05] ourselves no enough's enough I can't do
[1:15:09] it but here we stand not in a filial
[1:15:12] relationship not looking at our not as
[1:15:15] our accusers of the flesh not least
[1:15:17] we're not looking at a pastor who claims
[1:15:19] to be a husband to the church we're
[1:15:20] looking at Christ
[1:15:22] would you take me back he says a million
[1:15:26] times I would
[1:15:29] every time I would I'd take you back
[1:15:32] what about the flatters now this isn't
[1:15:34] to them
[1:15:36] the flatters come and go and come and go
[1:15:38] and come and go my heart's not with them
[1:15:40] their hearts far from me as a matter of
[1:15:42] fact they flirted with me but I've never
[1:15:44] known them
[1:15:46] they've never been with me to be taken
[1:15:48] back but you were in my heart from the
[1:15:50] beginning
[1:15:52] yo my message to you brother Brown is
[1:15:56] preaching the revelation of The
[1:15:59] Headstone he calls it the Capstone
[1:16:01] revelation of Jesus Christ he's saying I
[1:16:04] will take you back again
[1:16:10] because it's perfect love
[1:16:13] it's a it's a love
[1:16:16] stubborn and I thank God for it
[1:16:19] it pursues it and the Bible says many
[1:16:21] Waters cannot quench love
[1:16:24] no flirters and all the billions of
[1:16:27] flares have never showered God
[1:16:30] on the please of forgive me
[1:16:32] and I say today if you've ever wondered
[1:16:35] if he'd take you back he's Whispering a
[1:16:38] secret to you today
[1:16:40] and he's saying I do
[1:16:42] I will now
[1:16:46] would you just receive it
[1:16:49] maybe what you need to do is get over
[1:16:52] the self-hate to do it
[1:16:55] but if you condemn yourself
[1:16:58] if your heart hates yourself
[1:17:00] if you condemn yourself God is greater
[1:17:05] than our hearts and knows all things
[1:17:10] and he says I don't hate you
[1:17:12] I can't
[1:17:14] you can hate yourself but I can't hate
[1:17:16] myself
[1:17:18] you can loathe your spirit you can hate
[1:17:21] yourself but I can't hate you
[1:17:24] neither do I condemn you
[1:17:27] come I implore you with all that is in
[1:17:31] me I'm looking at a picture that and
[1:17:33] myself that may be incomplete to you
[1:17:35] today but in this moment in this time as
[1:17:39] we settle under the glow of Adam not
[1:17:41] hating the woman and Christ not hating
[1:17:43] the bride can I receive today to say yes
[1:17:47] he loves me
[1:17:50] oh can we say it I I had been pondering
[1:17:53] an example a title of this I know
[1:17:59] in other words
[1:18:01] Jesus loves me
[1:18:03] as I know
[1:18:05] I I I'm confident of that is there not
[1:18:09] somebody here of late who has certainly
[1:18:12] said I'm sure that it's too late
[1:18:15] I'm sure that he wouldn't take me back
[1:18:18] and it's based upon the Dynamics of the
[1:18:21] filial love where we're very conscious
[1:18:23] of the callous we're very conscious of
[1:18:26] the cynicism and the criticism and the
[1:18:28] contempt that can be bred with the
[1:18:30] natural relationships and we begin to
[1:18:32] project that upon Christ and we surely
[1:18:35] he has contempt for me but no no that
[1:18:38] it's not so with perfect love
[1:18:41] and you've lamented of your Redemption
[1:18:43] and you've been unsure of your salvation
[1:18:45] and I give to you thus saith the Lord
[1:18:48] it's not too late to receive it
[1:18:51] [Music]
[1:18:55] oh let's pray
[1:18:57] I thou our heads
[1:18:59] [Music]
[1:19:01] if you
[1:19:02] must
[1:19:05] must
[1:19:08] if you must receive it I say stand
[1:19:11] and open your heart to receive
[1:19:15] I deplore you to save what I receive
[1:19:19] your unconditional love
[1:19:22] I received this offer of redemption
[1:19:24] [Music]
[1:19:30] oh
[1:19:31] [Music]
[1:19:32] oh God
[1:19:36] I don't know Lord
[1:19:38] but the Bible says that the woman took
[1:19:41] it to Adam
[1:19:44] Lord I forgive me if this is wrong but
[1:19:48] did she come to him trembling
[1:19:51] [Music]
[1:19:52] did she come to him already fearful
[1:19:56] unsure
[1:20:00] Adam
[1:20:01] I've done something horrible
[1:20:04] Adam I've ruined our dreamed Adam I'm
[1:20:08] sorry Adam forgive me and he says honey
[1:20:11] don't worry come to me
[1:20:14] oh God could it be
[1:20:17] could it be Lord
[1:20:20] that Latin isn't seduced by his wife
[1:20:24] [Music]
[1:20:26] but there's love for her
[1:20:29] oh God may I as your son received this
[1:20:32] love for myself may I have even the
[1:20:35] character of the woman to come to him
[1:20:40] broken
[1:20:42] and ruined and say oh I'm dumb I'm dumb
[1:20:48] I'm sorry would you have me back
[1:20:51] and I believe Lord that I am no flirter
[1:20:54] but I come to you as a Son of God today
[1:20:56] and I say Jesus loves me this I know and
[1:21:01] Lord I'm more sure of your love than
[1:21:02] I've ever been before and I pray now as
[1:21:05] a pastor of this church I pray as the
[1:21:07] Son of God to your children who hear you
[1:21:10] as a man of God under the burden of this
[1:21:12] Covenant Lord I pray made the chains and
[1:21:16] the bondage of the complexes I feel your
[1:21:19] love be broken this morning Lord may we
[1:21:22] recognize that Adam's transgression
[1:21:24] forecast an image that Christ acts in
[1:21:27] the image of and the Revelation at the
[1:21:30] open of the seals is that yes yes you
[1:21:34] take us back and therefore I stand
[1:21:36] before you today willing to be received
[1:21:41] willing
[1:21:42] [Music]
[1:21:46] oh God I pray now in the name of the
[1:21:49] Lord Jesus Christ that you would break
[1:21:51] the cycles that exist and loose us
[1:21:55] father from these self-defeating Cycles
[1:21:58] the loathing the hate the complexes the
[1:22:01] fear loose us into your love Lord Jesus
[1:22:04] I pray that life would come
[1:22:06] May births take place deep within the
[1:22:10] soul beyond the callous Lord that you
[1:22:13] could bring forth Daughters of God in
[1:22:15] sons of God As We ought to be Lord I
[1:22:18] pray that you grant it in the name of
[1:22:20] the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:22:22] amen
[1:22:24] [Music]
