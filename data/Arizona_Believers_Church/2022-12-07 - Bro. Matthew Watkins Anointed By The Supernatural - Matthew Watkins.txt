TRANSCRIPT
========================================
praise the lord well we are here on this midweek service and so we'll be uh studious with our time and um and knowing that we just have tonight's service actually ministered what I'm going to minister tonight has just been burning upon my heart uh here just recently have only preached this just at home I believe uh and and just ministered over the last three services just on this thought that I'm going to speak tonight and so we just want to say What the Lord Has for us to say and I'd like to speak to you on anointed by the supernatural anointed by the supernatural second Kings chapter two let's just begin reading the verse one and it came to pass when the Lord would take up Elijah into world into Heaven by a whirlwind that Elijah went with Elisha from gilgall and Elijah said unto Elisha tarry here I pray thee for the Lord has sent me to Bethel and Elijah said unto him as the Lord liveth and as thy soul liveth I will not leave thee so they went down to Bethel and the sons of the prophets that were at Bethel came forth to Elijah and said unto him knowest thou that the Lord will take away thy master from the head today and he said yes I know it hold your peace and Elijah verse 4 said unto him Elisha Terry here I pray thee for the Lord has sent me to Jericho and he said as the Lord liveth and as thy soul liveth I will not leave thee so they came to Jericho let's just move on down to verse six and Elijah said unto him Terry I pray thee here for the Lord hath sent me to Jordan and he said as the Lord liveth and as thy soul liveth I will not leave thee and they too went on and you moved on down to verse 8 and Elijah took his mantle and wrapped it together and smote the waters and they were divided hither and thither so that they too went over on thy grounds a scripture distinctly says in more than one place here as you've read if you've noticed they too they too both of them Elijah and Elisha they too went over on to dry ground and it came to pass when they were gone over that Elijah said unto Elisha ask what I shall do for thee before I be taken away from thee in other words whatever you want Elijah and whatever you want Elisha the Lord's going to Grant it unto you and Elisha said I pray thee let alone double portion of thy Spirit be upon me this is to ask for your inheritance this is what he was asking and he said let a double portion of thy Spirit be upon me and he said thou is asked a hard thing nevertheless if thou see me when I am taken from thee it shall be so unto thee but if not it shall not be so and it came to pass as they still went on and talked they behold there appeared a chariot of fire and Horses of fire and parted them both asunder and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven and Elisha saw it and he cried my father my father The Chariot of Israel and the horsemen thereof and he saw him no more and he took hold of his own clothes and rent them in two pieces he took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him and went back and stood by the bank of Jordan and he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him and smote the waters and said where is the Lord God of Elijah and when he also had smitten the waters they parted hither and thither and Elisha went over let's just bow our heads together maybe if you have a need something you just want the us as we pray just to remember why don't you just raise your hand to the Lord and say Lord here's my cup tonight may you just touch it Lord Jesus father I've got both of my hands up or just representative of how much Lord I need you now Lord there's not a one of us that have came and to this building tonight Lord that don't have a need Lord that doesn't have a desire Lord for something for you to do in her life Lord the needs would be to various Lord to Name Lord behind the hands of your children are representative Lord of different requests or maybe Lord something upon their heart that they've prayed about in this service or Lord throughout the week or some challenge that they're facing now Lord I pray Lord that you would just come down and do what I can't do Lord in this service tonight I pray father that you would come and break the bread of life to your children Lord may you feed us Lord with your word Lord I pray God that you would Grant every desire of every person Lord in this building here tonight God may you just have the preeminence Lord in all things that are said and done will give you the glory and the honor and all of the praise in Jesus Christ's name amen amen you can be seated I almost titled this sermon the transfer of anointing and you can see why when we read this scripture here in Kings with Elijah and Elisha and it's amazing the parallel of these two men and their life and the Bible tells us here in Second Kings that Elijah's came to the end of his ministry it came to the very end of the road and you're witnessing as just like you did with David and that you have in the Bible the record of David's last words that David speaks and then you have the record of the last words of Solomon and now you have the last things that the Lord wants to say that Elijah has to say to Elisha this is some of the last burden or the last moments and these last days that he has here on Earth is going to turn into the last hours that he has and in the last minutes that he has I think it's incredible when you see this this the parallel of Eli and Elisha and Elijah takes him through this test through this journey you would call it wasn't just to reminisce or to go back to Nostalgia or places that were uh you know on some historic Journey but Elijah had a purpose in this because Elijah knew that the challenges that he had faced in his ministry and in his life Elisha would have to face those same challenges and so God has told him your ministry's over and and you're you're to cross the Jordan River and and he and before he goes to Jordan he brings him to Jericho and to Bethel and these two cities were highlights of the ministry of Elijah they were they were they were cities that God had done miraculous things through even the city of Bethel goes all the way back to Jacob and when Jacob dreams a dream and and he sees a vision of a ladder that goes from Earth to heaven and angels are ascending and descending and God says the Bible says Jacob woke up and he has a dream and he creates an alter him says surely the Lord is in this place and he calls the name of that City Bethel and then through Elijah's Ministry there's going to be miraculous things that take place there and and and then he takes him to Jericho and and Elijah's Minister Jericho was also a highlight city of of Revival you could call it that it broke out uh in the city of Jericho and in the city of Bethel but now at the end of his ministry both of these cities are backslidden they're they're they're evil uh there's there's a an altar that's been uh uh erected there that's not to the god of Jehovah and Elijah Elijah brings him to these two cities he asked him it's uh in verse 9 if you just hold your place open there he asks him and he says what shall I do for thee before I be taken from thee and without any hesitation at all Elisha says that a double portion of your spirit would come upon me that the anointing that's upon you would come upon my life because Elisha knew the challenge is that you faced in your ministry are not the same challenges I'll face because now Jericho is worse off than when you preach to Jericho and Bethel is worse off than when you preach to Bethel the hearts of the Young Generation of men and people are are evil to such a place that I'm not just going to need the power or anointing that you had to face your challenge but I'm going to need twice what you had to face my challenge and he says you've asked Elijah you've asked a hard thing now it wasn't hard for God and it certainly wasn't hard for Elijah here Elijah's leaving the scene he's about to go on a chariot and he's about to go to his reward so it's not a hard thing for God it's not a hard thing for for Elijah but the hard thing is going to be for Elisha in other words what you've asked for a double portion it's going to be a hard thing Elisha it's not going to be an easy life it's not just going to be a life of sensation it's not going to be his life of just power all the time it's not going to be a life of just success or Victory all the time but you've asked for a hard thing the mantle that the anointing that I have and it's incredible because there is nothing in particular about this mantle whatever it was a long flowing garment if you click on the the word they're using the King James it was like a long flowing mantle or a long flowing garment that Elijah war and there was nothing necessarily unearthly about the fabric nothing was really special about the the way it was stitched or the colors of the mantle that he had there was no special uniqueness or power to the mantle that he wore but but the fabric but but what was special was The Inheritance or the blessing that God had saturated that mantle with and he lined his life there was a purpose or a promise I want to just bring you because I preached this over Parts I'm skipping so much but I just want to bring you right to with me so just stay right with me here tonight and so what was special was the The Inheritance that or the promise or the anointing that was upon the Garment listen to what brother Brandon says here and you can just display those and I'll control it here if I can listen to what brother Brandon says here in this message why Christ speak he says may the Holy Spirit teach us today the things that we ought to know and may we then in return listen closely to every word and weigh it deeply and then may those who are listening by the way of tape may they listen close and may we be able to catch what the holy spirit is trying to reveal to us that's why I said you can hear how many times brother Brandon would say don't miss it the Lord's trying to speak the Lord is always speaking let me just stop and say that the holy spirit is always and has always a message that he's trying to get across to you he's trying to get across to his church he's trying to get across to his people and you as an individual the Lord has something he's trying to speak and I just say Lord don't let me Miss what you're trying to say for my life the way brother random says this may we be able to catch it what the holy spirit is trying to reveal to us for we realize if he should anoint us then the anointing is not in vain it's for a purpose that it might work to the good to the Lord and may our hearts and understanding be open Lord so he says let this anointing he knows Lord let us catch it let us hear every word let us be in tune let us be in harmony let us be in sync with right now not with what you not not yesterday not last year not 40 years ago but let me let my heart be in sync with what the holy spirit is doing right now Lord I want to know what are you doing where are you moving what is happening now Lord I there there's there's a there's a a there is there's an act there's an activity or a or or an action or a plan that's developing or unfolding and I want to be right in the middle of it Lord and he says then the Lord would send us we realize if he should anoint us then the anointing I'm preaching to you tonight on anointed by the Supernatural and he says he should anoint us then the anointing is not in vain so you take this word anointing and I'm not using it in the way that the charismatic church has so used this word anointing and you could almost just turn into any uh Pentecostal uh charismatic group and they would use this uh this word anointing you know that and it's almost like this this feeling or you feel the anointing or this this this uh this warm fuzziness that you feel or the sensation or this but do you know the Bible actually had a meaning of of what the anointing was and the anointing wasn't just a filling or something that you felt or an outward Sensation that you could say I'm singing and I feel the anointing or I felt the anointing in the service and I felt the I felt the sensation or the inspiration but actually in the Bible the word anointing means to smear or to rub with oil and so it means to smear or to consecrate for an office or for a service you would also have it in the Bible they would anoint uh with oil to signify a blessing or it was to signify a blessing that the Lord was wanting to transfer so the Lord had a purpose the Lord had a vision the Lord had a burden the Lord had something upon his heart that he wanted to say to his people so what would God do God would take a man like Jeremiah and God would anoint him what was he doing when he was anointing him he wasn't just giving him magic power it wasn't just some kind of Hocus Pocus that he put upon Jeremiah's life but if God was literally taking his burden or his purpose and transferring it to a human being named Jeremiah and he would saturate that man with his purpose and his message and when Jeremiah spoke he wasn't speaking his own thoughts or his own word but the purpose of this of what Jeremiah said was to translate or transfer the heart of God to a generation of people so when you rejected Jeremiah you weren't rejecting Jeremiah when you denied Jeremiah and you mocked Jeremiah you weren't mocking Jeremiah you were mocking Jehovah because Jeremiah Was Anointed with the message from Jehovah so to it to accept Jeremiah Was to accept the message of the Lord and so brother Madam says what was it he says to anoint us with the purpose so it meant an oil that would be rubbed or it would be smeared it was it was representative of something of maybe a special purpose to be a prophet or to be a builder or to be a king whatever it was they would take the oil and they would pour it upon the priest even Aaron The Pride priest was anointed with oil and that oil was representative of a transferring of the purpose that God had so it would go from purpose to promise to person that's why when we anoint you with oil and you come up for prayer there's no special power with the oil there's no kind of special kind of oil that brother Aaron Or whoever it is that buys the anointing oil you don't go through you buy olive oil but you don't go through and you know pay for some kind of holy water or some preacher that prayed over it or some some great dignitary there's nothing special about the oil itself but it's representing a promise that Jesus made and so that oil takes the place or transfers the promise that your faith in the Bible would come to pass in your life so when we pray for you and we anoint you with oil we're obeying the Bible when it said let the Elders of the church anoint them which are sick with oil and they shall be healed so where is your faith in not an oil that has some special power but your faith is in the promise that's in the Bible that that promise would be transferred all of the paper into your heart that's why we pray and we speak to the devil and say take your hands off of God's Property in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ it isn't any special kind of words that I'm speaking I'm only having faith in the promise that God gave and so that anointing was an oil that was rubbed or it was smeared I think of Psalms I think it's 131 when David says how precious it is for the Brethren to dwell in unity and he says it's like the oil that flowed from Aaron's head and it went on to his beard and it flowed from his beard onto his skirts and his garments and it flowed from his skirts and his garments all the way down to his feet do you realize that this was the high priest that was going to make atonement for the entire Kingdom or nation of Israel and God was going to represent that the anointing or the purpose or the promise that God had wasn't just going to stay on the head of Aaron as miter but it would move from his head to his beard and that oil would then flow from his beard to the urum and the thumb and what was in the urim and thumbem was the topaz and carmuncle and so artists and Jasper which was what representing people those were stones that represented families they represented young people they represented old people they represented the church they represented the strong they represented the weak they represented the healthy they represented the diseased the anointing was going from the head and it would move all the way through the body I hope you can be spiritual to catch it tonight God was not just going to anoint preachers this isn't just a preacher's Revival this isn't just a preachers let me go further it's not just a prophet's Revival it wasn't just a prophet's anointing but that anointing would have to transfer from a promise to a prophet to a microphone to your body to your ears and your faith would reach a hold and take a hold of that promise and that anointing would have to transfer from a prophet to a people it's incredible just I don't want to get ahead of myself here and I want to make sure I just am and sensitive to what the Lord wants us to catch and what he wants us to move over but it's incredible that this is the prayer that Elisha prays and he says Lord let that he prays this to his request to Elijah let a double portion in other words that promise not just not just the not just your power not just the you know the mesmerizing you can imagine Elisha would just enamored by the ministry of Elijah you can imagine just the Miracles of the miraculous that he witnessed in the life of this man and so much that he would go to Jericho and he would go to Bethel and he would say you know Elisha you you know you should you should just pastor this people it'd make a good one you want to use you to stop here this Jericho you know he could see the the Rebellion he could see the the wickedness in in Jericho he could see the hard-heartedness of the people I mean look the generation of people were mocking God's profit in so much they ran him out of the city just a few days later this was a hard-hearted group of people even the generation of young people it was worse in Elisha's Ministry than in Elijah's and they come and visit the city and Elijah says you know you should just settle down here Elisha you know build a home buy you some land you know you'd make a good you'd make a good pastor Elijah you should do Elisha you should just stay here Elisha says as the Lord liveth and as my soul liveth I ain't going nowhere I'm going to stay with you why because what did Elisha understand until I have what you have until the power or the anointing that's on your mantle transfers to me I'll never meet the challenge of Jericho that I face in my life I'll never until the promise of the word comes off of the pages and moves into my life I'm staying with the prophet I'm staying right beside you so notice this here he goes further and he takes him to Bethel and I want you to notice I'm just going to back up here just for a moment and parallel this with the life of Moses listen to what brother Brandon talks about with Moses he says here in the message why Christ speak knows how to do these things and how to deal with man he knows what's in man he knows what's in you you may think you know what God put inside of you you may think you know you but ultimately your creator knows you because he's the one who plays something inside of you and you may feel like a nobody and a nothing but if God put deposited something inside of you then God knows what's done on the inside of you he knows what's in him we don't we only know from the intellectual side he knows what's really in the man Moses was born in this world A Gifted boy he was born to be a prophet a deliverer he was born I love this with the equipment borned in him as every man that comes into the world is born with this equipment Moses born and then he was afterwards he was wrote to the place where he was anointed and notice the seed I hope you catch this I hope I hope you hope you don't miss it here tonight notice he says he came to the place where he was anointed so he backs up he says he knew this intellectually he had the equipment inside of him God had placed everything Moses needed to be Moses he placed everything that he needed for every challenge God would bring in his life for every hard time he brought in his life for every trial he would bring in Moses's life God already put the equipment inside of him to face every single one of them brother Brandon says but he only knew this intellectually he already had the equipment inside of him he was born afterwards he was brought to the place where he was anointed and notice the seed laying there with an intellectual conception with all the faith that he was born to deliver this people now we can mean this in a negative way when we say intellectual conception we're not for in just an intellectual dry-eyed confession that's not what we preach that's not what we believe we believe there has to be a real born-again experience but this isn't what brother branham's talking about he's not referring to this in a negative way he's saying he knew this intellectually in other words he had been taught it he had been told it he had been trained it had been trained unto him he knew he was the deliverer he knew the job that God had him for to do he knew it by an intellectual conception with all the faith listen with all the faith that he was born to deliver this people and yet it never come to life until that light from the burning bush flashed across it until he's seen not something he read about but something he's seen with his eyes not something he just read about but something he has seen with his eyes something Moses experienced he was told it it was trained he was told he was preached to he accepted intellectually in his mind but brother Brandon says but yet there was still something missing he had to see it for himself oh Hallelujah he had to see it for himself until he seen not something he read about but something he's seen something that spoke to him and he spoke back to it oh I just read that and I said Lord give me an experience that I speak to it and it speaks back to me give my children an experience not just a church experience not just a good Christian experience but let him know a God that they speak to and that God speaks back to them brother man says oh how that did bring things to life I think any man or woman boy or girl I think in an intellectual conception of what they think the word is and so forth can never have a full Foundation stand until they have met that light that brings that word to a reality you say then what can a parent do all a parent can do is teach them train them tell them teach them train them tell them and put your faith that there's a seed inside of their heart and so long as you sow the right thing into them when the light flashes across that seed it'll come to life brother Adam says now hundreds and hundreds of years but germ be mistreated in a strange country and would stay there 400 years but God with the mighty hand would bring them out so you see with this Burning Bush just as we know now as a man asked me a few moments ago about the coming and the Rapture it's incredible here that as you read this what why Christ speak brother by Adam's dealing with this Moses he had an intellectual conception he was told he illustrates the story to the kids about djokabed and brother random goes through the entire drama of that and he says but yet something was lacking yet he had never met the burning bush there came a point to when he was anointed there came a point where he was different than the Moses who just knew it intellectually and then when he met the burning bush and God lit that faith on fire brother Brandon jumps and goes just like a man ask me a few moments ago about the coming and the rapture we know we've lived the time out at the time of the Rapture is at hand and we're looking we're looking not just waiting not just on our doldrums not just sitting around on autopilot but even the prophet of God would join himself and say we're looking in other words we're reaching come on somebody help me preach here we're looking we're reaching I'm not just sitting my heart is longing for a rapturing faith it's something I'm reaching out for that's why brother random says I'm reaching out for it my hand is outstretched I'm looking for a rapturing faith amen that can pull the church together and give it some Supernatural strength is that what you're looking for that can change these bodies that we live in when we see a God that can raise the dead off the floor or out of the yard and bring him back to life again and present him before us when we see a God who can take a cancer that's ate a man to a shadow and raise him up to a strong healthy man that ought to make a shout that ought to make us be thankful that ought to bring us bring us some Joy listen when God heals a person when God heals you of sickness that ought to make you happy that ought to make you shout that ought to make you rejoice but listen to what brother random says it ought to do and ought to give rapturing Faith to the people do you realize what the prophet of God is saying what ought to give rapturing faith when God could take a man who who the doctors have given up on and it seemed impossible and could heal him of cancer that ought to give you rapturing faith that no matter how impossible your situation looks even to the point to where you've given up on yourself and brother Brandon says that ought to give us rapturing faith when we see a what brother Matt a miracle when we see something that's impossible to man but God does it anyway and what seemed impossible what man said was impossible God just did it anyway do you see what the body change the Rapture in faith is brother Brandon says it this way the Saint the holy ghost that God placed inside of you that anoints the seed life of God in that seed is everything you have need of for this life's journey even a rapture brother Brandon says that all that you did and bring him back to life again present him before us when we see a God who can take a cancer that's ate a man to a shadow and raise him to a strong healthy man that ought to give us Rapture and faith I just witnessed this just just a week just a month ago came to a man back home this man was an associate pastor what they call a Vineyard Church it's just a non-denominational Evangelical Church and this is Marcus Humphrey a man a wonderful Christian man and there's a brother in our church who some of you may know brother Travis Jackson he actually traveled here with us brother Dallas his father-in-law and brother Travis was on a journey to find the truth never wasn't he he was mom and dad was raised uh raised that raised him in the Beaufort Baptist Church and when his entire life looking for the truth had read the book of Acts had read about the supernatural power of God and begin to ask his parents begin to the one went from his parents and he went to his youth leader and he says why don't we see the thought of the Bible well what do you mean brother what do you mean Travis surely you read the Bible it says yeah but where do you see the these men that are filled with the Holy Ghost that I read about in the Bible where do you see this God who's moving and and operating in a church body or people have faith for Supernatural things and that you know what brother Travis on a on a journey in his life you know what brother Travis testimony if he was here tonight to give you his testimony he loves to tell and I love to hear it that those youth leaders and pastors would always say the same exact thing brother Travis you have to understand the age of the Apostles is over and the days of Miracles are over now that's exactly what they told brother Brandon when they would say the days of Miracles are passed and brother Brandon says anytime you appropriate a promise of the Bible to some other age you're under a delusion and brother Travis would say that's impossible I read about it right here in the Bible all the days of Miracles he goes on this little journey and he says he's in his mom's room and and he's going through her closet looking through some of the books that she had and he's reading any kind of spiritual book that she'd have and he suddenly stumbles upon a book doesn't even to this day doesn't know how a God in his mom's closet and he stumbles on a book the acts of the Prophet written by Perry green and he starts to go through this book he comes to his mom and he says mom where did you find this book he says this is this is the this is the the life of a man I've been looking for and she said I don't even know it was torn up the the spine was completely gone from the from the book it was just some pages of the book I'm not sure and then then she she took that book I think she took that book to work and a brother in our church seen her reading or on her desk she was a reception for a plumbing receptionist for a plumbing company and he says where'd you get that book and she said oh well my son he had found it in my closet he just loves it and wanted me to read it and you know he just he just this this life of this man William Branham and he says if he liked that book let me give him some more so that brother goes back gets Owen jurgensen's Supernatural books and gives him a supernatural book Elaine gave that sister Elaine now gave that book to Travis and said Travis you know a man came into the office and seen it he starts to read this book you know and and the he begins to begins to read and and he starts asking everyone goes to his pastors goes back to his youth leaders have you heard of this man William Branham he didn't have the other Supernatural books to know that brother Branham had passed away and he's looking for him looking for yeah you know brother Brandon he's asking everybody asking everybody have you heard of William Branham he goes to work and he's in a work vehicle with a brother from our church who had backslid and the Satan got a hold of him and took him out when his family was divorced he's living in sin had been married three or four times we hadn't heard from him in years and just so happens brother Travis is riding in a van with that brother who's now living about an hour away and he asks him hey Dave have you ever heard of a man named William Brandon hahaha and you know how I come in the story I get a phone call from Dave listen I'm not living where I should and this name brought such conviction in my heart I'm in no place to tell this I don't know how this happened but this man's asking me do I know who William Branham is and he said this guy's just a heathen just a sinner just a you know a a young man Travis is 20 something years old at that time and he said so I want you to come will you come to my house tonight will you meet him we meet brother Travis start he and the Holy Spirit just begins to deal with Brothers Travis's heart but before before that moment before it before he had came and and and and had the conversation he go he's going from church to church to church to church and he and he meets he he comes to the last church he was at was this Vineyard Church and this man who's in this picture here was the associate pastors now the pastor the associate pastor of that church and I met him actually at a at a a an event that my son was at and Travis introduced him to me and he said this is Marcus Humphrey I want you to meet him here's this man's you know strong healthy man real healthy conscious health conscious family uh all their kids have ran Iron Man races and they're just strong and healthy as they could possibly be and you know and and met the man had had much conversation with him and we leave and brother Travis tells me he said this was the my good friend Marcus and Mary and it was the last church I went to the Vineyard Church and and he said in the last church that I left and and so maybe three months passed by and brother Travis three or four months after that brother Travis calls me and he says hey I got some really disappointing news he says that you remember Marcus the man that you met and I said yeah yeah the pastor associate pastor said yeah he said he's been diagnosed with stage four Hodgkin's lymphoma Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and he said in the Mary just called me broken up saying they've told him he's going to die he doesn't have you know maybe but three or four months to live and and and it's just horrible and and I said oh Travis that's you know terrible he said well he said will you go with me would you go and he actually asked all the minister brethren in our church he said would you go with us with me to lay my layer hands upon Marcus and pray for him that God will Supernatural heal him and I said absolutely just so happens that day uh it was a Saturday early morning none of the other brothers could go I just went by myself with him and go to Marcus's house and this is the man that I seen a man that was had a tumor the size of a grapefruit you could see it there on his neck just on his own on his on his body and he you know walked into his living room and you know I had just been studying actually to preach the message this is just Supernatural the way the Lord moves I was studying to preach that Sunday and my entire message came out of the book what cancer is the book healing healing what cancer is and I had went over everything that brother random talks about the life of a tumor how that that tumor is just a life uh that he that there's a life living in that tumor the tumor is just a body and you remember how brother Brandon breaks that down and he says there's a life living there and he says that and he said and that life is living off your life trying to suck your life out trying to kill you and the doctors if they can go in and remove a tumor and with their tools and they can remove everything then that's wonderful but brother Brandon says but when Jesus in Mark 9 spoke to the deaf and dumb man he didn't say thou deaf disease but he said thou deaf spirit come out of the man and don't enter him again identifying that it was a demon it was a life and so we go into this man's living room and and and there's another family there as a trustee from his church and their her the him and his wife she had lost her son at 16 years old to brain cancer she's a cancer Advocate there they were in the living room and here he is and we sit down and Travis begins to talk to him and and he just begins to say well you know it's a point and then the man wants to die and and you know it's just Travis this isn't the way I wanted to wanted to to die and the doctors have given up hope and you know it was just resigning to this to the fact that he was going to die and and he and Travis says so that's what it that's how bad it is he said yeah it's stage four you know Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and they've tried chemo four times it's failed all four times and you know and he says I you know I just uh it's just the way that it is brother Travis stopped right there I didn't have no idea what he was going to say and he said you know Marcus he said because of that he said I just figure I can't really uh I got to be real honest with you and he said I just I figure I just need to be real straight up with you you know with this kind of diagnosis he said I'm just gonna I'm just gonna say what's upon my heart and what the Lord told me to say and he said you know he said Marcus when I was at your church I was searching and he said I was searching for the truth and he said and I came to your church and he said you're wonderful people I believe you're God you're God's family and your Christian people and he says but I was searching for more than just a an education about the Bible I was searching more than just a understanding or a teaching of theology I was I was look I was searching for a God that I could talk to a god that was alive that's exactly what he told him he said I was searching for a living God and he said I was searching for a God that still was alive still healed there were still Miracles there were still Supernatural there was still a God who could answer prayer and he said and he said and I found that God Marcus I left your church in the Lord led me to the truth that God has restored the the the the original Apostolic Faith with Apostolic power to a to a people to his elected and he's not in your dead he's exactly what he told me he said he's not in your denomination your denomination is dead he's not in the Trinity of God and I was sitting there going oh my goodness he is laying it all out I mean he was as bold you want to talk about bold faith I told him after he got in the car said man if I was ever in a foxhole buddy I'd want you right behind me just a warrior and he said he's not in the Trinity Marcus that's a that's a that's a that's a false interpretation of the Bible he's one God and that's a that's a demon spirit that that's that's the doctrine of devils and he said and he said he's a living God he's not in your denomination and if you'll accept this if you'll believe that God can touch you and heal your body and he said we're going to pray for you and I brought a minister from our church here and he introduces me and you know and I'm already tense thinking oh boy you know I don't even know if he's going to hear anything I have to say and Travis says now Marcus he says I hope that nothing I said offended you he said I hope nothing he said I hope nothing I said offended you and he said I hope it nothing what I was I was never trying to offend you he said I just wanted to be real honest with you he said because I feel like that's what you need right now you're you're not he says your doctors have given up on you and he says but Jesus isn't given up on you and he's still alive and Marcus just bowed his head and he said no Travis He said nothing that you said offended me at all and he said the only reason is is because when you knocked on my door and you and this man that came with you when you knocked on my door and Mary got up to go answer the door and she went downstairs a voice spoke to me audibly and said these are men sent from God heed what they have to say and he said so I was prepared for anything you would say and so I began to just minister to him and all I did was just take everything brother Branham and taught about cancer he began to tell us and show us his pet scan uh that you could see the tumor there normally in a pet scan you can see organs you can see the heart would be black you could see that lungs you could see the kidneys but here you can't see any of that all you see is cancer and that cancer that had started on his on his neck had now moved into his bowels and it moved from his bowels all the way down into his legs had tumors on the back of his calves he had tumors everywhere just ate up his entire body and Mary brought his cats his pet scan over and showed me and I said you know let me just let me just tell you that that life that's living on you Marcus is a it's a life that's trying to trying to kill your life he's trying to destroy you he's trying to suck the life out of you and I just begin to testify to him I said there's a sister named sister Elena and I said I know her know her and her family very well from Louisiana and I said she was diagnosed with the very same disease Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma stage four and I said let me show you Mary her pet scan and I pulled out my phone and I'm comparing and she's there his wife's looking of her Pet's cancer Elena's looks very similar to to Marcus's I said just black with cancer and I said but I want to testify to you about a living God who still answers prayer and I flipped the screen and I said here's her pet skin now after God touched her and you could see Elena's pet scan is completely clear of cancer you could just feel the atmosphere as she looked at that image and and and you can feel the atmosphere and she said she said I want to tell you she said I've never heard anybody ever explain a demon Spirit like that she said but that's what I believe that's exactly what the Bible says and she said do you believe Marcus can be touched the same way and I said I believe the Lord can do anything and nothing's impossible for God we begin to take you can feel the atmosphere change in that room you can feel Marcus's Faith completely changed we went over and laid our hands upon him I'll never forget praying I said Lord just as Hezekiah was told he only has uh to number his days are numbered and he's gonna die but he asked Lord in petition would you would you grant him more years Lord and you granted more years to hezekiah's life will you remember your servant here Marcus Lord would you touch his life months maybe two months Lee we leave that home and not knowing what's happened not knowing what what had taken place and I'm sitting in my house maybe three three months later I think it was and Travis just so happens to be there at my home in my living room and he's talking and we're talking about something some trip and he's he he's in the middle of saying something he pulls out his phone and he has a text message and he just stops and he said Mary just sent me this text in capital letters praise the Living God Marcus has been supernaturally healed of stage four Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma he has no cancer in his body oh you ought to really give the Lord praise for them [Applause] that man went from cancer to no cancer and now you have a pet scan that only shows organs This Is Our God friends this is a supernatural Faith you say what happened brother Matt go ahead and give him praise God and give the Lord praise for that you say what happened somebody believed the promise and that promise was transferred from the words of Jesus into the faith heart that would hold take a hold of it and that promise was transferred to a reality and now Marcus is a healthy man with no cancer in his body now you pray for that man we're witnessing to that man and I told him I pray that the Lord does something greater than the healing of your body but let that only be an insign of what God's wanting to do in your life but even if he doesn't and God never brings him and he's went as far as he can let that testimony be Faith to God's family that we're still serving the god of the impossible as brother Brandon says what ought that to do that ought to give us rapturing faith what ought to give us Rapture and faith that God can heal a man of an impossible condition you say what does that mean brother Matt my condition is impossible I look at myself I look at my body I look at my look at my look at look at yourself today you look at you you look in the mirror you'll see impossibility but God's going to do a miracle and I still believe that God's going to do a miracle I don't care how little it is whatever you need today there's a faith that if you can grab a hold of it and it can become anointed not from your intellects but from your heart that promise Jesus made can come off the page into your heart listen to what brother Brandon says something he says that when the light flashes I love this that when the light flashes from the sky and the trumpet sounds the body of Christ will be quickly gathered together and changed in a moment and taken into the heavens yes I can hear his words there's got to be something like that happened and our schools of theology can never produce that yet they're intellectually all right but you've got to meet that light you've got to find that something here Moses Basin his great call upon the word and was great until one day he met this light and the Very word itself spoke back to him then he got his anointing that anointed what he had in him that on the inside the intellects that believed it the faith that was based upon his belief in God that separated him from his mother and now when he strikes in the presence of this light it anointed what he believed what an anointing brother Branham says then he was commissioned he was commissioned Moses knew this intellectually noted intellectually and the seed that was born in him was laying in his heart listen to this and he tried through his intellectual experience with the word to try to bring them out to deliver them because he knowed he was born for that purpose what did it produce brother random said one dead Egyptian I believe it with all my heart Lord I believe it with all of my heart Lord I've already got it inside of me I've been told that I've been trained it but brother Brandon says until you've met that light and that Faith's been anointed then what will it produce the scriptures all said they had been there 400 years listen to what the prophet of God says here he says I think no church in its practice no matter how intellectual and fundamental it might be that church cannot Thrive until the Supernatural is made known among that people and they see it let me just stop here and say that's supernatural has been made known amongst this people something that they can talk to that will talk back to them that that vindicates this written word now we can preach the wordings this is God's provided way of healing we can preach the word explain the word but you have to receive the word oh Hallelujah that's what sets it a fire brother when you receive it the Revelation something slips out of the Unseen World are you listening to me tonight when you receive the word when you believe the word brother random says what happens something slips out of an Unseen World and comes rolling down through a mystical Channel somewhere into your soul that's a real New Birth brother Brandon says that says now I see it your eyes brighten your lips that hung down straighten up and smile every muscle in your body seems to rejoice Angelic beings Revelations book of symbols Angelic beings associate together oh I hope you get that that just dropped right down free look if you've got the holy spirit in you then you're a candidate for association with the Unseen World and the supernatural you're a candidate when you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost you're a candidate for Angelic being Association do you know that you associate whether you felt them today whether you heard from them whether you touch them you associated with demon Spirits spirits of Doubt spirits of fear spirits of anxiety spirits of lying that tried to lie to you and talk to you and Whisper to you from the moment you got out of bed oh my brother my sister you're in a war this is a Battleground this is not a picnic every day that a Believer gets out of bed and goes through about trying to fulfill or be pleasing to the Lord there's an enemy that you have there's an enemy that hates you listen to me young people you've got a real enemy who wants to destroy your mind he wants to distort your thoughts he wants to lie to you he wants to change you there's an enemy that you've got you've got to recognize that this is a Battleground it's not a picnic and every day you're in a dimensional world that where's their Spirits in that world I just read this quote and I said Lord I'm ready to shut the door of demonic influences and I'm ready to open the door of angelic Association oh is somebody with me here tonight to say let Angels let me open up myself so that angels can minister to me you're a candidate for association with the Unseen World no wonder listen to this no wonder people can't believe in those things they've never come in contact they've got nothing to believe with but when the Holy Spirit comes into the heart quickly he becomes then a two-fold being one on earth that's me to die that's me and one of Heaven that's me to live Amen in his body he's still subject to death but in his soul he's passed from Death unto life in his body he has his Earthly contact with his five senses in his Spirit he has contact with God through the Holy Ghost and the angels of God visits them and speaks with them and they are messengers sent from God to reveal and to bring messages from God to the individual you know what you ought to do tonight you ought to raise your hand and say Lord I'm inviting an Angelic being to come and influence me I'm gonna shut the door to the lives of the devil and I'm going to ask God would you visit me and speak to me and answer me Lord eggs anoint my faith and he says they bring messages from God to the individual then what we got to be worried about Jesus is here his spirit is here I ask you then what do you got to be worried about brother Brandon says we're in a stops what happened just now I went into another world it's an Unseen World you ought to listen to this on tape he says I went into another world it's an Unseen World we become so conscious of looking at one another like this but there's an Unseen World it's greater than anything you can see so I stopped it begins to say what have we got word about Jesus is here his spirit is here we're in a what happened just now brother random says I left here you still hear me you still see me I'm still here in one sense he says but I've left I've went into another world it's an Unseen World and then he says we become so conscious of looking at one another like this but there's an Unseen World just right here accessible that doesn't mean you're in it that doesn't mean you'll go into it it just means it's available to you that doesn't mean that just because you're part of the something part of something that doesn't mean you ever take part in the something that you're part of right like brother random talks about those that were under Luther's message and he says those that Wonder Wesley's message he says some of them were Sanctified but some of them were in Luther's men were in Wesley's message but live just like the anybody else but there were some of them that took part brother random says there's an Unseen World it's greater than anything you can see and here's Christ in this world in this building hear our evil spirits he's talking about church I got some news for you there's evil spirits in this building they're trying to anoint your mind they're trying to anoint your spirit hello somebody I said there's evil spirits you ought to be aware of it you'd come into church a lot differently you'd sit in the preaching of the word of God a lot differently a lot less distracted a lot less letting your mind slip think about this because why you recognize there's a demon Spirit trying to prevent you from receiving what God has specially prepared for you do you realize when you come into the house of God God has specially anointed a burden upon your pastor and that's a specially prepared message for you but you've got a job to do you've got to leave this realm and you've got to move into that room to receive it brother Madam says in this realm there's Christ and then in this building hear our evil spirits and War I love this quote hear evil spirits and War what is that Warrior what is that war brother Matt there's an angel trying to influence your heart there's an angel trying to say believe Son of God it's inside of you already believe child of God don't doubt the word of God and there's a spirit trying to say it's not for you and that's not for you that preacher's just picking on you he's just up there he's got an ulterior motive but then there's another voice saying it's for you child of God accepted by faith Son of God it's for you it's inside of you the answer you've been looking for is already here right now you just got to reach out and take a hold of it there's war and Christians anointed and the angels of God encamped about them trying to energize them with faith I just stop and say Angels energize my faith if that's the purpose of God then Lord let me be a recipient of that energy you know why because there's everything in this life that tries to sap you of your energy spiritually you got every kind of I don't care I'm not even talking about living in sin or doing anything you shouldn't do I'm just talking about in this world and this age that we live in there is everything that wants to sap your battery dry and a lot of Christians are a lot like iPhones and Android phones and smartphones low battery low battery mode it goes from yellow and you get scared then it goes to red and when it goes to Red you're looking for anything man you're stopping at Walgreens buying a charger stopping at a gas station doesn't matter where you've got to have a charge what is it everything your battery's dying you've got to charge it in order to have a battery you got to plug it into the charger and you know what you can have every charger in your car you can have it in your briefcase you could have it at your desk you could have it in your bedroom but if you don't plug it in it won't do you a bit of good you can have every book you can have every tape you can have every photo of the profit you can have sermons playing but unless you tap into it and plug into it and say I'm going to leave this Dimension and move into an Angelic world where I can receive strength for my family strength for my body healing for my spirit I love that the angels of God are trying to energize them with faith brother Brandon says in this world trying to energize them with faith and so is God here and angels and someday it'll be just as much reality as television or anything else because the spirit will bring us into that Immortal Life then we'll understand notice this here Elijah even here at the Jordan and he asks Elijah I'm going to close he asked Elisha at the Jordan he brings him through these cities of Jericho as we said and it's a it's a it's a rebellious people it brings him to Bethel and Elijah says as the Lord liveth and as my soul liveth I'm not going to leave you I'm going to stay right beside you you know what this was for Elisha this was a test this was a test for the ministry of Elijah who was the prophet for the ministry that was coming because Elijah knew there's going to be challenges that you face that are greater than anything I've faced there's going to be challenges that you face Elisha there's going to be things that you come up against and you can't depend upon the mantle that I'm wearing you can't depend upon the memories you can't depend upon the stories but you're going to have to receive that same anointing there's got to be a transfer of that same faith and same expectation that was upon Elijah had to be transferred to Elisha that same expectation that same anointing that same Faith listen to what brother Branham says here this is some of the earliest recorded sermons I have that up there I'm going to get to a quote but let me go through some of these from some of the earliest recorded sermons you have of God's prophet I know the next thing to happen is the restoration of the gifts to the church and it's the hardest thing I've had to do and he calls it in this pioneering work what was that pioneering work it would listen it's easy to walk down the trail it's much easier it's much harder to blaze the trail and brother Brandon says I've had to Pioneer this what brother Branham faith expectation to bring a people to not just trust in the god of history but to believe that God is here today to believe that he's the same yesterday today and forever do you know this is what brother Branham contended for from the beginning of his ministry to the end of his ministry to see that same God of the Bible be present tense and not just in a prophet but in the people not just in Aaron's head but all the way on the tablet all the way down to his Scourge the entire body that there would be a tabernacle of people where the gifts of God and the spirit of God and the power of God listen to me friends it was never the intention of of God's Prophet to bottle up all of the anointing or all of the power in one person but it was his desire to see Apostolic gifts manifesting in the entire body not just five gifts not just pre-church not just evangelists not just pastors not just apostles but in the entire body brother random says this was a pioneering work is to do this and to see people listen this is the angel of God in 1948 if all the Full Gospel people would come with one heart and one Accord there would be a Revival that would shake the whole world and every spiritual gift would be in the church within an hour's time after it took place signs and wonders that was done by the apostles listen to this would be a minor thing to what would do if we could just get the church together it's got to happen it will happen it may be after I've passed off the scene but I want to put my word in this that you might know that my voice may go away I may leave this earth but there will be a magnetic tape that you listen to through digitally or through however you listen to the the tape of God's Prophet let my voice ring out and speak this and he says it will happen it's got to happen it may be after I've passed off the scene but I want to put my word in this that you might know that my voice is this Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever 1953 it is to my humble belief that we're living near the end time or may I make it a little more personal than that Satan we're living in the end time I believe it's time for the restoration of the church that was promised that God would send in the day in this last day I believe that this is the day of when the word has been preached so much that the day is getting so dark and so evil till according to God's word he was to restore all that the caterpillar had eaten the Palmer worm had eaten will be restored back again and this is the day of the restoration of the spiritual gifts given into the church it wasn't so from the beginning and when the church puts forth another church it'll be a Pentecostal church with signs of the acts and the Apostles doing the same thing with the same Jesus working the same did you hear that the same Jesus not a different Jesus the Same power because he's the same yesterday and forever a Pentecostal Branch filled with the Holy Ghost signs and wonders of the Resurrection great things taking place among them they who know their God in the last days shall do exploits we're yes we're at the end time what are you saying brother Matt I'm saying this should be our expectation and say what our expectation brother Matt to see God manifest himself more than just intellectually more than just a word more than just what I think or what I've been told or what I say but let that Spirit manifest itself let that promise be transferred from the Bible to me personally amen yes we're at the end time some of the last recorded sermons here's God does God change his mind what a title 1965 does God change his mind now we find out that in the time that we're in this great thing has been brought up we find out that we're missing something in our churches hold on brother Branham the seals have been preached 1965. we're missing something in our churches and that is the power of Christ now notice he didn't say Sensations he didn't say emotions wasn't just about just a super just one Sensational experience this isn't what Elisha was after Elisha wasn't going to settle for anything less than the mantle or the spirit that was on Elijah to come upon Elisha something in our churches and that is the power of Christ now look I don't want to criticize I love you and genuine true love always is corrective now we're missing Christ in our church I read this and I'll never forget when I read this quote right here and I immediately my mind left my church but left any church and it went straight to my family and straight to my home and straight to this home and brother Branham says now we're missing something or missing Christ amongst our Pentecostal people and I stopped and said Lord don't let this be true of me how many would identify themselves and say Lord don't let this be true of me don't let me Miss Christ get the religion get the doctrine but then miss Christ we're missing Christ amongst our Pentecost we have our brothers and sisters there's something wrong the old-fashioned prayer meetings oh he only talked about that brother Matt before 1963. I love how brother Aaron Brother Aaron your pastor says when what year did Brother Branham say this the year he was a prophet and for those that dates mean something here's 1965. the old-fashioned prayer meetings they used to have all day and night they don't want to have them no more are women used to wear long hair they don't do it anymore be a disgrace for women to paint and use paint back in the early days and act that way these women knew something went wrong nothing's wrong with Christ but something went wrong something is somewhere the pulpit used to wouldn't have permitted such a thing as that but it does now see the crisis is on and we're missing something I I scoured these going through just over the last month and a half of some of the last things this is what was on brother Brandon's heart what was in his Spirit what was upon Elijah before he leaves the scene what are some of the burdens what are some of the things that he's saying what is he wanting to say what is he wanting to express and he's saying this in 1965 areas in April see the crisis is on we're missing power that we ought to have or the big machine ought to be running up and great signs and wonders well this building ought to be sitting so full of the power of God now till a sinner couldn't stay in here the Holy Spirit condemning it right quickly like that like ananias and savira if a sinner couldn't stay in this building then a Christian definitely ought not to be able to stay under preaching with sin in their life the it should expose us brother Adam says The Sinner shouldn't be able to stay here until the sinner can say the Holy Spirit condemning it right quickly like the end of us in summer Sapphira and we're missing something the God of this evil age August now she's calls the whole world to accept the scientific leadership of the educational program that Satan has given to her under the name of a church the leadership of an educational scientific program I'm picturing to you the God of this world when she as Eve had the very filling of God's word in her hand she could have took God's word but what did she do to that instead of tearing for the baptism of the Holy Ghost let science prove to her that the Holy Ghost was only for the disciples instead of keeping Divine Healing going when she ought to now be raising the dead and doing great Miracles she has let Satan under his leadership of religious man take the word of God and try to say that it was for another age and she's believed it when the Bible said the the things that I do shall you do also Jesus said that go you into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature I love this we're still creatures go into all the world and preach the gospel we're still creatures these signs shall follow every them not just brother cop brother random says not just brother Roberts not just brother here not just brother Branham or brother Brandon quotes the scripture Mark 16 these signs shall follow all them that believe she denies every bit of it so what was closing to brother Branham what was his challenge to see a living God to see a promise of God come off of the Bible because within that anointing was the purpose and within that promise was the purpose what was Elisha asking for let the purpose not of Elijah because that Ministry would be used in Elijah then Elisha then John the Baptist and all all the way up down to God's Prophet but it was the purpose that God had let me receive a double portion brother Brandon says here notice this here and the God that he keeps going that she denied she denies all the Supernatural and she swapped it for his intellectual conception of the Bible where priest and Holy Father so-called were Bishops archbishops District presidents General overseers so forth has put their own interpretation to it as God has left them set there dead is 12 o'clock and I believe here's things that are to be now we move to December 5th I believe that the same thing we live in today God bearing record of his word by vindicating what he said he would do now we know that this is the day of salvation thank God the day of salvation is still here where God is calling men from the world from a life of sin into a life of service and in the day God has poured out a spirit from on high great signs and wonders are to accompany the ministry of this day this is when the farmer and latter rain are falling together and we know that they're supposed to be great signs and wonders which is in many great denominations this is turned down but I'm very thankful to these open doors that I've had to go into and the inspiration it's give to young men like your pastor here so what was brother Brandon saying notice the doors have shut they've they've they the Charismatic Church the Pentecostal Church has shut the doors brother random says where it's turned down they deny every bit of it but then he says but I'm very thankful for these doors open doors that I had to go into and the inspiration it's given to young men like your pastor here in other words he's called something that's caused them as I'm beginning to get old and know that my days are numbered and know that these young men can take this message and sweep it on to the coming of the Lord if he doesn't come in my generation which I'm hoping to see him and I look daily for him remember these are the last words I'll look daily for him this is what is on his heart like daily for him watch keeping myself prepared for that hour notice this to his last recorded sermon you know the hour will soon arise when right Among Us will be the holy spirit will speak out like it did in the united sense if I were remember see the hour is arriving and we are now you just remember that that God is going to dwell among his people that's what he wants to do now I read this in in Tucson to the Tucson Tabernacles very special I want to read it to you here tonight and this was the desire brother Adam had it it is it is it is incredible when you watch this by dates of when brother Bynum comes to Tucson and he says I sat here I didn't want to start a church I didn't want to have a church here I didn't want to I didn't want to I didn't want to have any conflict with the Assemblies of God you Brothers you Nazarene Pilgrim Holiness and he says but I sat here in the desert for three years and you never invited me your pulpit you never invited me to your church you never invited me to come speak so brother Brandon brother green opens leaves Beaumont Texas opens starts uh starts the Tucson Tabernacle in Tucson Arizona left everything forsook everything my grandpa was with him in Beaumont when he left everything had my grandpa went to Tucson I'd be living in Arizona right now but God had other plans notice he says in what house will you build me he says but we as this group of people we have a message for this day we believe that God has given us a message and brother green is I don't want to call him my associate because well it also is my associate we're together in this message brother green preaches the same thing and message that I believe in he's left his home he left his people he left his church he was I believe he was a district superintendent of something listen friends I I just want to inject this right here they they left something to come to something they forsook something the first generation of people my grandparents left everything to follow the message and let me just say it doesn't matter if you were born and raised in this message you've got to leave everything and until you're willing to forsake everything and leave everything that you thought President says he left everything he left his home he left his church he was a deuce district superintendent one of the organization give the whole thing up when he heard this he left everything that was dear to him also to come to the desert just to support what God is giving to us now I say I believe it not only should be in our hearts it should be our duty to back him up everything that we can to attend the services to come here to worship to make this a place you've got to make it that place listen it doesn't happen just by a personality of a man you've got to make it that place you can have the most powerful Gifted Man the most charismatic ma'am with a wonderful Ministry but until a church says transfer that promise transfer it to the whole body to the young to the five-year-olds eight-year-olds 20 year olds to the whole church comes into Unity to make this a place where God can come and dwell and he says to make this a place where God can reveal to us the things he has for us to reveal and his word said the message brother Brandon quotes brother green who comes before brother random takes the pulpit this is what brother green says the message doesn't come to me through the given of inspiration as it does to maybe some of us but he said I am here to back up what God has given let me just put my voice and say I am here to back up the saith the Lord I have no other agenda I have no other purpose I have no other Mission other than to back up what God has done and what God is doing he's here to back up brother Brandon says what a statement and I believe if so we'll all cooperate together we'll put our hearts to it I know that each of you if you feel like I do aha we can get a barometer on brother Branham what was brother Brandon feeling in November 21st 1965. where was his heart brother random says and I know that each of you if you feel like I do I am so hungry to see the spirit of God moving I just can't hardly stand it I wonder if that would resonate with somebody here tonight and you could say I'm so hungry Lord I just can't hardly stand it some experience I've just had up in the mountain just to fill that once again that's something that when I was first Saved was So Glorious to my heart we could come into a place we can sit and we could see it among us that we're drying we sit here in the desert listen to this I get among my brother and they talked with me I talked with them always in a little way of watching Phil and other what the feeling uh out there with the spirit as it was to see just the condition of that brother to see what's wrong I begin to fill us all reclining getting away from the spirit listen this isn't a spirit that just affects Arizona this isn't a spirit that just affects Europe it's a spirit that's permeating laodicea it permeates that Spirit of reclining is attacking you your children your home your church you got to stand against it how many is with me say I'm going to stand against it I'm not going to recline I'm not going to dry Satan you might have thrown everything to put my fire out but here I am Satan I'm still standing I'm still believing I'm still pressing I'm still pulling I'm still supporting I'm still creating an atmosphere for the Holy Spirit and no matter what I go through or what tomorrow holds I'll be here tomorrow I'll still be supporting the ministry I'll still be attending the services oh can somebody join me here tonight I'll still be here trying to create an atmosphere for the Lord Jesus and he says oh here he says I see it just the condition he says I begin to refill this all reclining this has become too natural a thing we must Worship in the spirit where the spirit of God not only our message should be the flame of the hour it should be the flame in our hearts it's got to be in our hearts and now that brother green God sent him in here and opened up a church like a precious face that we believe in you know our brother brother green said he opened the church his own words he said I wanted a church that I could mention the name William Branham and not have to explain it and it not offend anybody brother green brother Brandon says and now that brother green has sent him in here and opened us up a church of like Precious faith that we believe in we ought to be very grateful to God and attend every service take every place that we can don't just don't just come don't just enjoy but say Lord where can I fill in let me take every place that I can if we're asked to call on to pray to seek to do let's be soldiers just anxious to do it keep the message honorable live the right kind of life don't let no smut come upon it we're living too late now I just raised my hand and invite you with me to say Lord let me keep the message honorable let me live the right kind of life don't let me let nothing come upon it Lord we're living too late let's live it clean will my life your life all of our Lives need to be picked up before God our young people just ride around from place to place from show to show drifting further and further away from God now that's the truth I see it in my children I see myself get into a place where you've got to assemble ourselves together to worship God the Bible said so when we see this day approaching that much more come together there's something about coming together if there's only two people here you be one of them and if we come together and worship together then we just something another about it Jesus said where two or three are gathered in my name there I am in their midst is that your desire I disclose musicians can return can come if you could come stand to your feet stand with me
