TRANSCRIPT
========================================
my title today is our future home I'm not sure if there'll be a a second part to this or we may just use a little bit of a different title but um we're looking at the subject of our future home the theme today I think is going to center a lot on Redemption and God's Plan of Redemption and there's just a lot of things that have been impressed upon my heart a lot of things have very heavy in my spirit to minister a lot of things that we've been ministering on over the last month or so on character expression the order and the home and those things we like to continue on but I just feel impressed to kind of zero in on the original inspiration for the subject of Heaven's mystery Earth glory and to uh and kind of the very things that we've been pointing to over the last several services from the very beginning of this so there'll be a lot of things that maybe sound familiar to you but it's uh there's this theme of within the sermon future home that really caught my attention and it spoke to me about how and I was studying on the life of Paul and it spoke to me on how that this future home that exists uh we live there are certain things about this this theme in the future home there was things about it I realized that we live in right now and I'm sure that some of you can recall that as you read the sermon future home the way that brother Branham emphasizes it that it's it's the future home is so imminent that brother bam doesn't even really spend much on the Millennium and it's as if there's the very next thing is that Eighth Day and he tells us that even our souls are already resurrected in that position and so there's just a lot of things that begin to realize and that principle that we're just going to emphasize a lot today on how program talks about the Earth being preserved that there's things about the future that relate to where we are right now and that the Earth is just not a throwaway well I think we could all we'd all say well this life is not a throwaway and this this world this life is a Proving Grounds there's a lot of things we might say but even just to slightly get that out of balance like ah one day this is going to all be gone and we choose between heaven and hell kind of waters down some things in my opinion at least in my heart as I was looking at it and the kingdom of heaven that's going to be established it's not just going to abandon the Earth it's not just going to be done away with and so we've been pointing at that quite a bit over the last several services and so I just want to bring that out in the sermon future home today now in Revelations chapter 1 verse 6 it says and this is going to pick up from the Wednesday night uh the last time that we ministered he says and hath made us Kings and Priests unto God and his father to him be glory and Dominion forever and ever we have been made it says Kings and Priests unto God and it says to him be glory and Dominion forever and ever and I think it's a key phrase to the very idea that we have been made Kings and Priests brother Brahman said this is one of those truths that needs to be emphasized and he says that the importance of Revelation to the True Believer can never be over emphasized and so there's a this is a truth it needs to be emphasized I say the revelation of this truth cannot be over emphasized that there is a spiritual Kingdom in effect right now he hath brother Branham uses that in in the churches but he hath made us Kings and Priests not will make us Kings and Priests but he hath made us Kings and Priests and being made a king we have dominion being made a priest we have a service we have something we ought to do so we have been made Kings and Priests right now with power over worldly Kingdoms brother Branham says in the church age book and I'd like to uh you know zero in on God's purpose because we'll come to that out of the future home he says he redeemed us for a purpose he bought us for purpose there's a purpose uh in redeeming us there's a purpose in buying us not just for the sake of redemption alone but he has a reason for doing it we are his King's spiritual Kings and this is where brother Brown kind of acknowledges he says oh we're going to be Kings upon the earth when him when he sits on his throne so there's going to be a domain if we could even look at it as far as the Millennium in the millennial Reign the king of the son of David reigning on his throne for a thousand years and that has uh implications and that's a that's a kingdom and it's a kingdom Reign and that's a Dominion uh yet it's not without opposition because we know there's going to be another battle there's going to be judgments that come and then we know that there will be an eighth day there's going to be a rain a glorious rain that will be an eternal rain that Without End we'll want to emphasize that a lot this morning he says we will one day Reign upon Earth with him when he sits on his throne he says but now we are spiritual Kings and we Reign Over a spiritual Kingdom now that's uh that's something that needs to be emphasized because he says he hath made us Kings then the emphasis is to understand really what does that even mean and what's the point and what does it mean to be made a king and I think there's a way that we look at this and say that I I'm a spiritual King and I ran over spiritual Kingdom we might we might think in a sense of well that's the the message and that's the word of God and that's church and that's my home and there's a way that maybe we try to identify certain things and what's a spiritual Kingdom so we think of the elements of church and we think the elements of religion and the elements of a Christian life but brother Graham says right now we reign with Christ having dominion over sin the World the Flesh and the devil he doesn't say over church over parking spaces over seats in the sanctuary Over Feet washing and communion and all these different things and over leading worshiper over the base it doesn't that's not even he doesn't even bring the elements of those kind of things when it comes to Christian Life and of you he says right now we reign as spiritual Kings in a spiritual Kingdom and we have dominion over sin the World the Flesh and the devil showing forth his praise and glory showing forth himself how do we show it how do we show forth Christ by the Dominion that we exercise showing forth himself for it is Christ in US willing and doing of his good pleasure when he uses the phrase Dominion means control over it means the government Dominion is just another word for Domination and in the scripture when man was given Dominion it was the right to dominate it was to possess absolute control over so right now as spiritual Kings we are to dominate sin we are to dominate the world we're to dominate The Flesh we're to dominate The Devil so if there's any denomination that we believe in it's the domination of the devil it's the domination of sin the World the Flesh and the devil we believe that we right now are spiritual Kings with a dominion over those things the right to absolutely control it the Bible says right now we've been made Kings and Priests now I want to point in this direction for a moment and I think there's a lot that you can mine out in this I'm kind of just setting it out there with the emphasis on how that we are made Kings and Priests but there's certainly an end time element to this I think we should consider and when the seven the book was open the book of redemption those seals were loosed it says they sung a new song Thou Art Worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou were slain and has redeemed us to God by the blood out of every Kindred tongue in people and Nation and have made us unto our God Kings and Priests he says and we shall reign on the Earth now these that are in heaven at the time singing this song as John was caught up in Revelations chapter four he's there in heaven these Elders are singing this song Thou Art Worthy to take the book and to loose it the seals thereof and redeemed us and you have made us unto God Kings and Priests and now he says and we shall reign on the earth now that doesn't do away with the current rain but it points to a future ring a future time and brother bam takes this in the first seal and he says the Saints under the altar screamed out where the art thou lamb for you have redeemed us and you've made us Kings and Priests and we shall rule on the earth he says oh my in that so when he opened that book now the the way this strikes me is that there's something about the rule on earth when that book is open now just I wouldn't ask you to necessarily humor me but just just give me a moment just to kind of refer to things some quickly and if it doesn't quite connect for you there's something to pray about something digging to the message about but if this book is the title deed to Redemption and it represents everything Adam lost in the fall Dominion control and fellowship and now that book is being opened and it's coming back down to earth in Revelations chapter 10 then it has something to do with the bride receiving power and receiving the rights of redemption to have Absolute Total Control so he says in that Saul when he opened the book I believe that something is being ushered in at the time that this book has been delivered to the bride the time that we're taking it and eat it to where now there is a dispensation of dominion that has been dispensed and given to his bride and brother Brandon when he's preaching uh the revelation of Jesus Christ and he's preaching those the church ages he takes Revelations chapter four part two he's preaching on the the four and 24 Elders he says he says this first he was in heaven above and shining in the Stars second he's talking about The Throne a lot of us in Parts one and two he's focusing a lot on the throne in those verses as he's just using Revelations chapter four and describing that before you get to the scene of Revelations 5. and it's just so beautiful how he carries that in setting the scene when he's preaching the church ages because he sensed that something was happening he sensed that something was coming and it's the very events of Revelations chapter 5 that come after that so he says he was in heaven the heavens above shine in the stars the second he was on Earth shining through the Shekinah Glory next he come and was made flesh and dwelt Among Us still wearing his patience and he's talking about blaspheming the Holy Ghost and Jesus saying that day is going to come and when you do there'll be no more forgiveness for that then he redeemed Man by his blood came into his church in the form of the Holy Ghost and speak against that it's a finished thing done this is very remarkable things that he's saying and he touches on it in the two sermons he preaches on Revelations chapter four he says now you can see where the shaking come where at the end time they don't realize people can't comprehend what it means and he refers to this a few times over those two days um here it's January 1 and the night before he's referring to it how God is moving God is doing things and it's not in the way that the world would think it should be and it's not in the big flashy flowery things it's not in the great big things but God was doing it in such a humble way and the world was rejecting it why because the kingdom manifests itself in a way that's different than how humans perceive how the kingdom ought to manifest itself I says this is where that shaking comes and the people just can't comprehend it and it's God who at one time was in the heavens who then was manifest himself in the Shekinah Glory Then Came In the Flesh of his son who said you can speak against me but if you speak against the holy ghost that will not be forgiven you then he says he came into the church in the form of the Holy Ghost so then he summarizes it this way now the first Throne was in heaven the Judgment seat the second Throne was in Christ the third Throne is in manner that's quite a statement God who is in the heavens and then Moses patterned the Tabernacle uh the the Tabernacle in the wilderness after what he saw in heaven and so he's describing brother Brown in these areas around this is talking about the mercy seat and God's judgment seat and that's what he's referring to he says the first Throne was in heaven then it was patterned in the Tabernacle on the holy of holies The Mercy Seat was there and then he says that was in Christ so this is the mercy seat or the throne and think about those elements the throne and The Mercy Seat being one thing that's quite a quite an image to gather together but now he says that God's Throne is in the Earth right now God's Throne is in flesh right now so we say well God is in the heavens and he's the god of the the Heights and he's the god of the stars but he's not just a God in heaven who has a a throne that Moses patterned in the Tabernacle in the wilderness but now his throne is in Earth right now in flesh his throne is n't it now you would if someone has a kingdom and they set up a throne that Throne is typically in some sort of fortified place that is where it exercises Dominion that is like maybe the focal point of the center part of the kingdom and it's like hey if you want to see the king you got to go to where the castle is you got to go you got to go to the house of government you got to go to the place where he is and even that Throne symbolizes his authority in power and it doesn't just where it's anchored isn't his soul place of authority but it shows where the throne is the the kingdom is there the Dominion is there we need to really consider the implications of that so there is a present Dominion and as brother Brown says oh we're going to be Kings upon the Earth with him when he sits on his throne and we could either look at the millennial Kingdom or that perfect Kingdom that's coming I would say the perfect Kingdom that is coming is reflected in our current position in Christ it's it's reflected right now in Ephesians chapter 2 verse 6 it says in hath raised us up together and made us sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus you are his bride right now you're not going to be but right now you are you are Daughters of God now you are sons of God now you're not will be but you are those things right now so there's a we have to consider that if I am his bride now I need to think about my authority right now and and the the power that is exercised by that Authority brother Brandon says in the sermon a greater than Solomon is here it says we're sitting in Heavenly places in the presence of Christ Lift It Up Above the cares of the world into a realm of faith now if there's if there's a part of you that likes to think that the Heavenly places just exist between Beyond these uh in here Beyond these uh French doors or these doors that we walk through into this Sanctuary that's not what's referred to he says we're seated in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus Paul didn't write this letter to the Ephesian church and send it to their church address and say but you can only read this and believe this when you're in the sanctuary he's talking about the Believers every day condition and position is that we are made to sit together that's placed positionally in Heavenly places in Christ therefore it's not just when we come here and we've sung songs for 20 to 25 minutes that were lifted above the cares of this world whether you feel it or not you should confess that I positionally am above the cares of this world whether you can see it whether you can feel it and I'd say even if you don't believe it get your mouth to talking to it oh come on it's so easy for us to tell a little bit of white lies and say well I'm on my way and we haven't even left our bedroom and it's so easy to say that how come we can't just say I'm lifted above the cares of this world even if we don't think it start putting the word on our lips lift it up above the cares of this world he says into a realm of faith we ministered on this from this statement we're preaching on faith and uh Divine Healing that we are in a realm of faith that means a kingdom the very word realm speaks of the Kingdom or a domain of life so realm is not just a space that we've carved out as a sanctuary realm is not an atmosphere that we try to get ourselves into by meditation this realm is a domain of life it's where we're living now Heavenly places is a state of being connected with that perfect Kingdom it's a Heavenly places is a state of being right now that's connected with that perfect existence it's Heavenly on Earth we are made to sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus if my spiritual baptism or baptism baptized into the body of Christ and I believe that I'm there positionally in a supernatural spiritual way my soul is now fused together with God by that baptism of the Holy Ghost and I'm in the body of Christ that is Heavenly on Earth and look at that in two ways it's it's Heavenly in this flesh which is Earth but now it's his throne in Earth now in Ephesians chapter one we're going to back up to what he mentions before because he has raised us up to sit in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus so we're in Christ Jesus now let's just find where he is and Paul will start with verse 15 because I just love this background these words he uses of the the church at Ephesus wherefore I also after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus in love unto all Saints cease not to give thanks for you making mention of you in my prayers that the god of our Lord Jesus the father of Glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and Revelation in the knowledge of him what was his prayer for the Ephesian Church a spirit of wisdom in Revelation and the knowledge of him the eyes of your understanding being enlightened that you may know what is the hope of his calling these are the things that he desired for the Ephesian Church remember brother Brown says Ephesians parallels Joshua and the Ephesian church was being positionally placed with the Corinthian Church a lot of Correction a lot of place in the gifts and trying to get every you know ones trying to have the premise with this and one brings this and one brings that there's a lot of carnality in the Corinthian Church and it manifested in the things that Paul's having to address but now when it comes to the Ephesian church he has he hasn't he hasn't needing to address that he says you've got to go into the knowledge of him understand and be enlightened to know the hope of his calling and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the Saints and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us word who believe according to the working of his mighty power so these are great statements and prayers for us he says which he wrought in Christ when he raised him from the dead and set him at his own right hand in the Heavenly places so when Paul writes in Chapter 2 that he's raised us up together and made us sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus He is wanting the Ephesians believers who read this to think about what is intended by saying we sit in Christ in Heavenly places because Christ has set down at the right hand but I said right hand means in power and authority of God it doesn't necessarily mean the literal right hand but it speaks of the power and authority of God we have been made to sit together in Heavenly places in Christ where is this believer's position in Christ says at the right hand in the Heavenly places far above all principality and power and might and Dominion in every name that is named not only in this world but also in that which is to come that tells you something about this Dominion everything that is in the earth now and everything that will be and hath put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things to the church the church which is his body the church which is the fullness of him that filleth all and all you are his body you are his voice and the bride is the fullness of him that finishes all and there at the right hand in Heavenly places it is above all principality which speaks of the first place a rule or magistrate if one is a principality they're the chief the leader the ruler they're in Christ and Heavenly places you are above every leader every ruler every Chief far above every Power which is the power of authority and influence or the right of influence the right of power just because One Believes then even to say far above every Power just because they have a right doesn't mean you have to let them speaks of government whether by relationship or judge what the the right to influence by relationship by position far above every might the power and influence because of wealth power and influence arising from numbers or forces or people this is what he's using Pharma principality power in might doesn't matter how many resources they have it doesn't matter how rich they have doesn't matter how many people they have in Christ we are far above principality power might and Dominion which is any government any power any lordship over any anyone who possesses Dominion so if someone has a domain of influence and a sphere of influence he's saying you're above it and they may have control in this realm they have control in that realm but you have power over them that gives you power although over their domains you have power to bind the greatest and the least they can say well this is my domain I'm the ruler I have authority I have a right to this I have a right to that I have a right to the body I have a right to cause this I have a right to cause that I have a writer that you have power over it now I hope this isn't too much of a a turn here but I I had moved these statements and scriptures around several times just figuring which should go first which should go first and this is the way that it ended up and I didn't just randomize it or ask uh being AI to you know tell me which way it should go but this is just where I felt impressed to bring it now this is a little bit of a step forward but I want I hope that we've established right now we are Kings and Priests that one's the future home brother Branham and we are his body the fullest of him that filleth all in all that's the body of Christ that's his bride now in the sermon the future home over the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly bride brother Branham draws this parallel over and over again it's one of the main themes to it between the bride and the Earth and there is a there is a reference to the bride he kind of uses the Bride As we already understand this we know this and then he looks at the Earth in a future sense to say now what he's done here he's going to do there and I'm going to go over this for a little bit he says we understand that this great home of the Bride is to be here on Earth so what I'm wanting you to uh to think about is the future is now we have a we have a Reign spiritual Kings right now we are right now in a realm of faith and we are seated in Heavenly places which is that right and the power and authority of God over all principality power might and Dominion right now and he says we understand that the great home of the Bride is to be here on Earth but right now where it's it's okay to sing this world is not my home I'm just passing through because we see the cosmos of it uh we see the order the governments we see the things around us and we look out and we realize uh that these things aren't or what God envisioned in his mind to be our inheritance this isn't the Garden of Eden this is what Satan's eating this is when the devil's made something of this and so I say this world is not my home I'm just passing through it doesn't mean that this Earth is a temporary stop before we go to an eternal heaven and then somehow this is just forgotten and left to the demons he's saying that the bride will have the great home of the Bride will be on Earth right now so where we are now is our future home right I know there's Babies there may be some things there you'd want me to kind of lay out a little bit more clearly but hopefully we'll see this and then what he does is he kind of outlines how God established a pattern of redemption in the scriptures so he's using numbers and threes and these different things he's talking about Redemption and he takes second Peter chapter three Verses 4 5 6 and 7. and he and he takes this he says and saying where is these are the scoffers and the mockers in the last day saying where is the promise of his come in so for since the fathers fell asleep all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation now this is something to really chew on and enjoy today when you have that green chili burrito mixed with cheese enchilada style red sauce at Rito's the promise of his coming and how the perception is nothing's changed everything's just the way that it was from the beginning he says for this they willingly are ignorant of there's just a lot to chew on here a lot to ponder that by the word of God the heavens were of old and the Earth standing out of the water and in the water he's going all the way back to the beginning he said they said where's the promise of his coming nothing's changed since the beginning of creation and he's saying is that so he says they're ignorant of the fact that the world in the beginning the heavens and the Earth standing out of the water and in the water whereby the world that then was that's the phrase the world that then was that's one world the world that then was being overflowed with water perished so here's think of this the mockers and the scoffers in the end time ah brother Branham said this was going to happen brother man said that was going to happen his mission was to fall on this and where is the promise of his coming nothing's happened for 60 years and where is this and where is that and a lot of talk he says because nothing's changed Peter says these guys are ignorant the world that then was was overflowed with water and perished he says but the heavens and the Earth which are now by the same word are kept in store so the word that then there that then was and the world the heavens and the Earth which we could say which are now of the world which is now there's there's two different worlds we could say the world that then was the world which is now is kept in store by the same word so it's it's waiting it's being preserved reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and Perdition of ungodly men so he's saying that the world which is now is being reserved for fire on the day of judgment and that's a clear reference to White throne uh and the the the Earth being judged with fire and Peter is describing brother Brown brings this out and other Scholars have done the same and brother Branham even references uh some places where we you can see where he was getting these things and being very precise with it but Peter's describing the three stages of the world or that we could call that the heavens and earth as one one unit he says the world that then was of old and going back to the beginning he's talking about the heavens and earth in the beginning we got God in just one in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth it says in verse 2 this is chaotic this is confused and the world that then was and the Earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters this is the world that then was and now it's chaotic it's confused and it's Darkness it's just this Mass it's indistinguishable standing out of the water in the water water overflowing it and he says the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters brother Brown says in God's power to transform in Genesis 1 this world was without form and it was void Darkness was upon the Earth nothing but a complete chaos and when this world was in that condition the spirit of God moved upon the face of the water and the entire picture this is the part I want you to catch the entire picture was changed from a total chaos to a Garden of Eden and now this the world that then was was overflowed with water and it's changed from Total Chaos to a Garden of Eden belram said that's the transforming power of God that can take something that's nothing and makes something wonderful out of it so Peter says there's a world that then was God transforms the world that then was to the heavens and the Earth which are now you catch that the world that then was he says they're ignorant they're they since the beginning everything's been the same where's the promise of his coming so things haven't been changed the way they think they ought to but God is transformed he says you're ignorant because the world that then was was transformed to the heavens Earth which are now let's skip to verse 10. because now he's going to bring come back to this world that is now that's reserved for fire against the day of judgment but the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night in the which the heaven shall pass away with the great noise and the elements shall melt with fervent Heat and the Earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up now that's that is the world the heavens and earth which are now so you've got to look at verse 7. and verse 10 is describing how it's kept in store reserved unto fire against the day of judgment the prediction of ungodly men he says when the heaven shall pass away with great noise the elements will melt with fervent heat the earth and the works that are in the shall be burned up now Paul thinking about this says see and then Peter rather saying then that all these things shall be dissolved what mannered persons the heavens and the Earth he's referring to what mannered persons ought you to be in all holy conversation and godliness the heavens will pass away the Earth is going to be dissolved these things are going to uh this is gonna happen what men are persons ought to be to be in all holy conversation and godliness right now looking for and Hasting unto the coming of the day of God wherein again he describes it where in the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved and the element shall melt with fervent Heat this is the heavens and the things that make up the Earth he says going to melt with fervent heat so nevertheless we according to his promise look for new heavens and a new Earth wherein dwelth righteousness Peter sets forth this image of the heavens and the Earth and I think that that would be the world because we have the the actual Earth the things that we can see the what we're grounded to it gravity tells us to and then the atmosphere is above the the holds in the elements and the oxygen of the ecosystem keeps it together how it is that's the world he says it's going to be they're going to be on fire they're going to be dissolved met with fervent Heat he says but we look for I say that they're all going to be melted and dissolved he says but there's new ones emerging we're going to see heavens and earth dissolved but we are going we're looking for new heavens and a new Earth now in Revelations chapter 21 verse 1 . John says and I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth for the first Heaven and the first Earth were passed away and there was no more sea as Peter wrote the heaven shall pass away with the great noise the Earth also and the works that they're in shall be burned up John now says I see the new Heaven and new earth the ones that Peter said in verse 13 he was looking for new heavens and a new Earth now John sees them coming or he sees them and he says the first Heaven on the first Earth were passed away and there was no more sea you I'm not brother Branham a lot of these things are just even accepted broadly the Birmingham is focusing on some things I want to come to in a moment to me that's the real the real meat to this but as we read this this is what brother Branham points out and this is what's looking at is you look at these Scriptures it may seem like that the world which is now in second Peter is going to be destroyed entirely the world being the heavens and the Earth and cease to exist going to melt away if something melts it's gone yeah that's why some speculate that an ice pick would be an icicle would be the perfect murder weapon right because it once it melts it's gone no fingerprints no evidence you know maybe just a puddle of water and you know huckle cat could figure it out and say ah it must have been an icicle but there's a this is when something melts it dissipates it changes and even it's evaporating there's something here that Peters look at saying oh Heaven's gone Earth Gone dissolved when something dissolves it loses its distinction it's completely gone but verse 5 and II Peter chapter 3 says that the world that then was perished how do you catch that it perished now we think something perishes it's gone but when he's what he's describing the world that then was being overflowed with water perished it what perished but it wasn't completely annihilated what happened it changed the chaos was gone the disorder was gone the the confusion was gone the darkness was gone somebody says it perished it was in its former State when God began to move on it even those overflow with water it didn't dissolve and completely disappear and this is what Peter's saying everybody thinks all the Lord's going to come and everything is just going to Boop the Earth is going to vanish and we're all going to be in heaven or whatever however they're thinking about it's going to say but you know what you're ignorant of how God works that the world although it perished it still remained it was just changed so he says it's perished it doesn't cease to exist it's changed and brother Bram says in the future home he says and notice how God makes plain to us his Plan of Redemption he says all this just thrilled my soul when I saw it how he makes plain to us here now his Plan of Redemption brother Branham is adding this emphasis of this Plan of Redemption now compare what we see with our own eyes what God has done to redeem his world he's done the same plan to redeem his people as Paul as Peter refers to the the Earth the world in one condition Water World in another condition and the third condition as it refers to this later instance of this fire and this burning and what's going to come afterwards Brad Brown says he's done the same plan to redeem his people for the unchangeable god changes not any of his plans or anything such a glorious thing how he led us now if I could just interject here when Jesus says Heavener shall pass away but my word shall not pass away there's going my word will not change it only manifests Heaven and Earth will change but my my word will not change he led us to himself to Tabernacle in Us by three stages of Grace now that you have to put yourself in there the person just like he's led the world in three stages to come through the world as God will come to the world after it has gone through three different stages of purification that's exactly how he comes to us through the three stages of Grace so in John writes and I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth for the first Heaven and the first Earth were passed away it doesn't mean that this one's dead and another one's taking its place it means to pass from one state to another so you have the world that then worries that perished but it emerged as the world that then is now but the world that is now is going to pass away it's going to be completely renovated completely changed and it's going to pass from one state to another so this isn't replacement this is a transition this isn't a replacement this is a transformation this speaks of a process of regeneration it speaks of a process of renewal it speaks as brother Braham says the Plan of Redemption to renew it and regenerate back to its original purpose that God had in the beginning says that the Earth is going to be dissolved that word dissolved is used and other places as a loosing when Peter Jesus told Peter I give you the keys of the kingdom and whatsoever Thou shalt loose on Earth shall be loosed in heaven it's the same word as dissolved in second Peter it doesn't mean that it's going to be dissolved Heaven and the elements shall be dissolved they're going to be loosed the very things that are tainted now the very things that marit now all the the asphalt and all the sin and all the mockery everything that clings to it now the stain of man that's been left in the imprint of the earth it's going to be loosed from that that's going to be dissolved all the all those things that speak of Satan's Eden there's going to be releasing a setting free I'm so appreciated the word that was brought while we were gone appreciate the ministry that was here and I trust that I haven't had a chance to fellowship with you and get some feedback don't do it now but maybe after service just let me know how it went but the very thing that we administered on before we left is if God before us they're in Romans and then I believe Sunday what the true shall make you free the dissolving is a looseness setting free and making free so when it says the new Heaven and new earth is a liberated Earth it's a liberated heaven now this is you know those of you who've gone and listened to and studied it and read it know that this theme is in more places than just these few that I'm bringing up but brother Brian says in the future home he says by these passages and he's taken from Peter in Revelation one might think or be led rather to believe that the whole planet of this Earth will be destroyed I will make a new Heaven A New Earth that the heavens will be gone and the Earth will be gone completely annihilated but a close study and with the help of the Holy Spirit we can see the truth of this and that's what we're going into it is only the atmospheres around it and the sin that's upon the Earth that will be destroyed now we realize that the heavens means the atmosphere is above what does it do it's then these thistles and sickness and death and politics and sinful man and sinful women and evil spirits will all be gone away and annihilated it has to be done that way because we're going to live right here right here it's where we're going to live we'll prove that by the Bible right here is where we live that shifts things not going to heaven and then we're going to live there for eternally in heaven we're coming back to Earth we should start looking at Earth a little bit differently notice thistles germs all sickness and things will be completely taken away all this it's existence that's in the earth now man-made systems politic sins all kinds of evil spirits that the world is contaminated with and all that happens above us in here it's contaminated with evil spirits now when he lays out the dimensions for us the scientific Dimensions uh long before he even comes to this in August of 64. he's about how science these radio waves and these things just keep filling up in the atmospheres this is this needs to be Sanctified this needs to be purged it says all this exist in Heavens or atmospheres and the Earth which is now Peter referred to it the Earth which is now this Earth holds those things but it wasn't made for that purpose remember you're made for a purpose so here's this parallels he said that the plan of God does not change what he does to the individual to redeem his people he's doing to redeem the Earth so there's something we can learn about what God's doing for us to learn about what God's going to do for the Earth but what I'm really wanting you to do is though we've accepted what he's done for us if you can see what he's patterned for the Earth it might expand our understanding of what he's done for us the Earth holds these things but it wasn't made for that purpose and you weren't made for that purpose either sin cause it to be like that sin has caused us to be a lot of ways but you are made for that purpose you weren't made to lust you weren't made for compulsion you are made for despair you are made for despondency you aren't made for those things you are made for fear you are made for jealousy amen he says it was made by God the Creator and this is something really really chew on and all our bodies that we live in now were put on the earth when God created it God was laying out all his material he laid us out there thinking of you when he created you were in the earth in the beginning when he made it this is why brother Graham can make such a strong parallel what he does to you he's doing to the Earth because you were the dust of the earth it was all laid out there when God himself created it you were in his thinking and him the great Eternal was the thought which is his attribute and now sin caused all this to happen and God through this age is gathering up his material in other words he wants to use it for the purpose he ordained it for I want you to see Redemption see the plan of God this predestination brother Brandon says right here is where we're going to live our future home will be on the Earth the new heavens and the new Earth are a redeemed world the world that then was perished it is now the world that is but the world it is now that we live in is going to be completely renewed and changed into a new heavens and new earth and that is a redeemed world a world brought back to its original purpose Revelations 21 2 says and I John Saul this is after he said I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth and the old Earth the first heaven and first Earth were passed away and I see the holy city New Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband so John is looking at a New Jerusalem that descends Out of Heaven unto a completely renovated and renewed Earth God didn't create a new one a transformed one the world that then was perished the world that is now is completely changed not alive annihilated but things are melted things are dissolved elements are changed and now this New Jerusalem is coming to settle down upon the Earth something out of heaven in this invisible Dimension is now coming back to a new Heaven and new earth that's New Jerusalem in heaven the bride where she is united with her with her groom there's this it's in a place just as he says he's holding the world and he's reserving the World by his word and he's going to completely melt it and renovate it there is a New Jerusalem in heaven I go to prepare a place for you that where I am there you may be also and now we see this coming back down to earth and so in this we see this image of the world being changed while we're being preserved or we're kept away from all the annihilated because we don't need to be purged by fire the New Jerusalem doesn't need to be renovated that but there's a change that happens to this world and in second Peter chapter 2 verse 5. he says and God spared not the old world but save Noah the eighth person a preacher of righteousness bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly the world was judged by the flood completely changed now it still existed but it had it received its baptism of water there's water that over and Brother Band even uses those two different ones you have one in the very beginning you have this water there with Noah now as this water is completely renovating and changing the world Noah's preserved by the ark from the Judgment that's on the Earth and it carries him back to the Earth and it's different from the earth he was on before it's the same Earth but it's changed things have been annihilated things have been destroyed things have been covered up and buried and now just as Noah was preserved on the ark to come back to the Earth the New Jerusalem after its the world Earth is judged comes back down under the Earth the world the Heaven and Earth that is being renovated and changed it is a spoken word attribute of God it was part of God's original plan and purpose when he made the Earth we were the dust of the earth we are part of his material that was all laid out there and so God will preserve it he has made us Kings and Priests and we shall reign on the Earth the meat shall inherit the earth the Earth is going to be preserved he says compare what we see with our own eyes what God has done to redeem his world he's done the same plan to redeem his people just as you have three stages of the new birth is Holy Ghost is that fullness of the new birth it places it's in the body of Christ as Sons and Daughters of God you have you as you have the three stages of New Birth to the individual he's saying that there's three stages of the Redemption of the Earth that the three stages redeems the soul of the individual that there's three stages that redeems the world brother excuse me the scripture says in Romans chapter 8. verses 29 30 and 31 for whom he did for no out we're thinking about the individual but now I want you to think about the Earth because he says that compare what we see with our own eyes what God has done to redeem his people it's what he does to redeem the world for whom he did for no the world is a spoken thought a thought of God original thought of God he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover whom he did predestinate then he also called and whom he called them he also glorified and whom he justified them excuse me them he also justified in them who he justified them he also glorified what shall we say to these things if God before us who can be against us now as God has planned it this way that homie did for no he's predestinated and if he's predestined he's called you if he's called you he's Justified you if he's Justified you he will glorify you that means the believer does not need to adopt some thought process that relates to a Judas who can profess to be saved who can profess to be justified who can profess to be Sanctified but cannot be sealed with the Holy Ghost he hath perfected forever them that are Sanctified the believer is part of a different plan no matter what's happened to this world what we do to it it will come forth tried and true it will be preserved it will be brought back to glory and no matter what happens to the believer here on Earth he's called you he's ordained you he'll justify you he'll sanctify you he'll fill you he'll glorify you you cannot miss it but around picks us up and who's this Melchizedek I don't know if I have it here but he says it's only the predestinator that are included in Redemption he says we see here plainly the complete secret of our lives and journey and death and where we go after we die predestination is in plain view here now listen as we teach this closely the stages of the Eternal purpose he had in his secret has now been revealed there are still three stages to perfection just like he redeems the world same way he redeems his church he redeems the people in three stages now this is true of every member of the body of Christ he says look first is justification like Luther priests second sanctification like Wesley preached third baptism of the Holy Ghost these are the three stages of the new birth man future home is saying we can see this these same stages and type to what he does to the Earth because when he baptizes us with the Holy Ghost he dwells in our soul and he's gonna I think we may be reading it here in a moment when he baptizes the world with fire it's because we're coming down to live on it and it has to be a fit place for us to live on but now notice he says that's right then comes the rapture so this Plan of Redemption that all believers participate in is the soul being redeemed that's why everyone's preaching the future home he's saying our souls already in this future home condition Eighth Day condition he says but then comes the rapture there's still another piece to this Redemption then comes the rapture and it says in Revelations chapter 1 verse 3 and I heard a great voice out of Heaven saying as we've seen the first or Heaven and the first Earth are passed away I knew heaven and a new Earth and then the New Jerusalem descending Out of Heaven from God and he says now I heard a great voice out of Heaven saying behold the Tabernacle of God is with men the Tabernacle of God is with men I'm what I've been studying on thinking maybe they would over it would be part of the Kingdom but I may just transition a different series on the temple in the Tabernacle and those elements because they're all the same they're just types to understand the truth it says the Tabernacle of God is with men think of that his habitation is dwelling where his presence is and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with them and be their God Berman takes this verse in future home the Tabernacle of God will be with men the former things have passed away this thing has passed away this means that heaven has come down to resident with man that now there's no longer this distinction of a God in heaven and this dichotomy is splitting this bridge or this Chasm that heaven has come down with man he says Heaven and Earth are embraced not the heavens that create the atmospheres that form the world that now is or even the new heavens and the Earth that will form the world that will be after it's purging but he's saying heaven where God was has embraced this is a this is in relation to the perfect Kingdom in the Eighth Day there's this Union of Heaven and Earth Heaven and Earth are going to embrace they're going to fuse together the Tabernacle of God that Moses saw in heaven that he patterned in the wilderness it's not going to be there anymore it's now going to be perfectly Unified so now I want you to catch this this image of the future home that will be this relationship and this this image of the perfect Kingdom in the Eighth Day think about what it presently means to the for the bride now what's the present reality now because brother Brown's using the type of us to describe that he's actually using listen what has already happened to you to describe what's going to happen to the Earth [Music] oh Hallelujah he says it this way but now it has to go through a baptism of Fire Holy Fire from God which cleanses the earth and the heavens around it then it's purchased so that the redeem can live on it living it in peace notice the baptism of fires to cleanse it from sin sickness disease germ sinners from the devil and all his group he has to be cast out into the Lake of Fire Holy Fire from God comes down from God out of Heaven Burns it up to make it ready for God to dwell in for God and the new world that is to come is to dwell on the Earth because you say God he dwells on the human heart really I'm gonna I'm gonna end I'm gonna stop a promise I'm going to stop today promise he dwells in the human heart but can the bride becomes one and they go to their home in the new world where is it here and the same Plan of Redemption is used to redeem both world and the persons that live in it so he's describing a future home he said it's going to be renovated completely annihilated completely changed so that God could come down and live in the Earth and what's going to happen in that Eighth Day forever no sickness no germs no disease no sin no world no flesh no Devil he's saying God burns the world up to make it a fit place for him to live in the future but what he's pointing to is the example now what he's done for you now describes what will be then for the Earth Hallelujah I can say if it's true then of the new Heaven's A New Earth then what about his New Creations right now if it's true then now then what about now oh praise the Lord I don't like the way my voice sounds after I breathe Mountain Air for a week I never could develop a preacher's voice but maybe they'll have some DNA therapy for that or something our future home reflects what the kingdom is on Earth right now the future is now we say oh one day one day that's going to be burned up Earth the devil sin cast the Lake of Fire everything's gonna be destroyed it's going to be perfect then could we agree scripturally could we no sin no doubt no fear no one belief no opposition no rivals one day one day God's going to do that to the Earth and what he's going to do to the Earth to create that he's already done for me what he's going to do for the Earth one day he's already done for me he's already done it oh my you know what it makes me want to do start Millennial reigning right now in this yeah there's going to be opposition but I want the kind of character to Reign this in yeah there's going to be unbelief yeah there's going to be those who aren't in the bride but I want character right now to be able to look at my thoughts and my attitudes my wanderings and all the all the things that kind of try to prick at me I want right now to know let the king arise let the kingdom arise in my heart let me bind him now here on Earth as we said now the world one day is going to be redeemed he's going to make this Earth a fit place to live that means the earth is waiting Paul picks up on Romans 8 chapter 19. read a few verses here to 22 for the earnest expectation of the creature waited for the manifestation of the sons of God I know there's a lot going on in our heads there's a lot that goes on in our bodies but there's Redemption for both of those too right God the perfect Redemption is not just your soul it's not just your body it's also your heart your spirit your minds I know there's a lot that goes on in our body a lot that goes on in our minds but brother Branham says our bodies came from this Earth there's this part of us that's in this image that God is redeeming and I even as the creature creation the Earth the world and all the creatures therein are groaning and longing for the manifestation of the sons of God could it be that there's a part of you that you think you fight with there's still yet a part that's crying out for the manifestation of the spirit of God that's inside of you there's a part of your body when it gets sick and all my weak body and I've got a tendency to this I got a tendency that could there be some strain within it that says oh one day one night in this body that can be riddled with cancer and rashes and disease and and diabetes and whatever else it might be there's a part of it saying oh one day one day that will not be high cholesterol one day they'll not be high blood sugar one day one day I'm gonna be changed and this mind that can be bowed down with so much fear so much doubt and confusion could it be that there's a part inside of it groaning waiting for the manifestation it says of the of the Earth for the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly yeah the earth the earth didn't say here it is in the garden of English is like oh man this is awesome isn't this good I just love it the way Adam walks on me like that and just everything's amazing and then one day the world's just like you know what let's mess this up let's just do something different it didn't have a choice but it says but by reason of him who has subjected the same so there's a purpose there's a plan in Hope it's been subject to vanity it's been subject to sin it's been subject to thistles and politics man-made systems and all kinds of evil spirits because the creature itself because it says in Hope think of this the Earth has a hope all of creation has a hope because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption this Earth will be delivered it will be dissolved it will perish yet again but not to be replaced not to be annihilated but to be changed it notices delivered from bondage into the Glorious Liberty of the children of God what is it longing for you to establish the kingdom for you to manifest it back to its original owner back to its original ruler back to its original Dominion for we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now it's groaning it's desire and what for you for us to come and manifest deity one of the I think reading listening to things that are to be will be a really good spot remember says now you're risen with him and manifested attributes of God setting in Heavenly places already raised resurrected to New Life and set it in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus he says oh that means so much nowadays church that means so much to us to see ourselves positionally placed in Jesus Christ Brothers if you could come to your instruments if we're those attributes of God we cannot live by creeds we cannot live by denominationalism we must live by the word because the Bride is a part of the bridegroom like any wife is a part of her husband I know we read this statement already therefore we must be that word bride and what is that word bride the manifestation of this hour the bread not a creator of denomination but a living Oracle of God a living attribute of God displaying to the world the attributes of God in the formation of the brightness to be expressed in this hour that we're now living a living Oracle in fact in fact it says there's not a lot from the world that see this what happens in this I don't even know what kind of shape you'd call this but what happens in this Tabernacle in this Sanctuary the world not the world's not consistent even those people that stream they think that this is just a green screen and I'm in my bedroom right and we're just we're just putting In Crowd noise that was canned laughter right more of it push the button right just got a drop pad kind of they said he should cue the a man's more or something that but nobody sees what's going on here the world doesn't see it so listen as awesome as I want these services to be I want it more awesomer out there I I I hope these Services just get more Dynamic we find ourselves enjoying the presence of God more I hope that we learn better as a pastor how to structure the services and to minister the word of God I hope that we're learning these song leaders and musicians and all of us coming early doing our part to make these church services the best that they can absolutely be that it would be heaven on Earth that he would have the preeminence the signs and wonders would be manifested among us but listen I don't want the manifestation to be in church I want what takes place here to help you out there because the world has got to see a living Oracle not a structured church service not four walls not a Pulpit and a an a Nord grand piano but oh God to see a living Oracle live in Oracle living out in the world today the expression of the message of the hour Bill bam says on the sermon God of this evil age I'm just wrapping this up and now we're seated with him with power and authority over every devil he says oh if you could only believe what God has given now you have to just listen to me because I this statement's not in the slides you can only believe what God has given but if you're not seated there you don't have it it's quite a statement if you're seated there you have power and authority over every devil if you can only believe what God has given it says but if you're not seated there you don't have it and then he just gives this wonderful Grace and if you're seated there and don't believe it and then that's Grace isn't it you're seated there but you have a hard time accepting it you're seated there but you have a hard time believing it you're sitting there but you have a hard time understanding he says unafraid to move you'll never lose it use it so you could be seated there but at B church we are seated there but maybe we don't fully understand it maybe we don't fully believe it or we're afraid to move and if so he says you'll never use it I don't want to be afraid to use the authority of the word of God I don't want to be afraid to use the authority that brings the power over every devil I don't I don't want to be afraid to use that he says but if you are seated there you will use it for your ordained to do what you do I'm ordained to do what I do for Dane to do what I do what does he mean when he says that you may be seated there and you may not believe it you may be seated there and afraid to move but if you're seated there you will believe it one day you will move one day you will use it because you ordained too oh I want to use it oh Lord help us to do what we're ordained to do to be a living Oracle to satisfy the earnest expectation of the creature satisfy the groaning and travailing of creation it says in Psalms 145 verses 10 11 12 and 13 all thy Works shall praise thee O Lord are you not the works of his hands all of creation testifies he says thy Saints shall bless thee they shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom and talk of thy power to make known to the sons of men his mighty Acts and the Glorious Majesty of his kingdom thy kingdom listen thy kingdom is an everlasting Kingdom and thy Dominion endureth throughout all generations this kingdom is an everlasting Kingdom this kingdom is an eternal Kingdom this kingdom is established right now in the hearts of his bride the throne is on Earth don't get tripped up The Mercy Seat is represented in flesh yet again I know that stumbles a lot of people maybe it's abused by a lot of other people and it causes the other people to stumble but don't lose the truth that in you now is the fullness of him that filleth all in all thy kingdom is an everlasting Kingdom it's a kingdom that shall know no end [Music] it's a kingdom that one day is going to be established upon earth when after this Earth has been re generated and renewed and transformed by fire we're going to come back down to it and live forever and if that's the future home our Futurama that's our future home brother bam is asking you to look at you what has he done for you what has he done for you right now because what he's done for you now is what he's going to do to the Earth let's just admit it it's really easy to believe that about the Earth then isn't it right come on can I get how about a hallelujah and amen that's the truth hit it swing it sitcom something it's easy to believe that in the Eighth Day the Earth is going to be changed it's going to be perfect Sikkim and one day the Earth is gonna be perfect no sin no sickness no death there the lamb is going to be the light there the the father is going to be one with this bride manifested through a sign and bride throughout Italia one day one day it's gonna be like that and brothers says you want to know what that's like you want to understand how it gets there look at yourself with their own eyes see what he's done with their own eyes you see what he's done look what he's done for you the year that was is no more but yet here I am the eye that was is no more but yet here I am Hallelujah and I realized maybe it's hard for me to believe it but he says one day I will it may I may be afraid to use it but one day I will because I'm there already [Music] Hallelujah oh let my works praise him let me bless thee O Lord speak of the glory of thy kingdom and talk of thy power and make known your Mighty ax and the Glorious Majesty of your kingdom let's Stand Together
