TRANSCRIPT
========================================
do you love the lord tonight praise the lord greetings in the precious name of the lord it's good to be with you and uh many of you are strangers to me but we're a family that is getting acquainted with each other on this side we plan to spend eternity together and so we want to give you a warm welcome in the name of jesus christ being here tonight and uh as brother erin said my name is craig boehr we've not met i'm a pastor in connecticut overcomers tabernacle and we're here on vacation and i've got my wife and family with me and josiah and samuel and elia are my children and my wife is anna and then i've got my in-laws i always say my favorite in-laws brother joe adams and sister jessica and their family and so we're just enjoying each other and so brother aaron asked us to come we're very very happy to be here with you brother aaron as brother aaron said has been we have been friends for many many years way back and some strange thing about it is major junctions of our life we have crisscrossed through through the years and he can witness the same just somehow and i don't even understand it through major junctions of life we have always been there at those times whether it be him or me and so we and that grows you together in experiences like that so we love we love him and his family sister elizabeth and their children we're just happy to be with you here tonight we love the lord that's why we're here and i realize this is a wednesday night i'm always trying to be very mindful of the time and uh trying to find the mind of the lord while we were out and so forth so let's just if you if you have your bibles let's turn to two portions of scripture i'd like to turn to first thessalonians chapter five and this may be just a bit strange but i want to bring these two thoughts together tonight let's start with first thessalonians chapter 5 verse 18. say amen when you find your places there we'll just read one verse there and then we'll go to revelations chapter one in everything give thanks for this is the will of god in christ jesus concerning you everything is brought in everything give thanks praise the lord let's turn to revelations chapter 1. and we'll start with verse 12. and i turn to see the voice that spake with me and being turned i saw seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and gird about the paps with a golden girdle his head and his hair were like white as wool as white as snow and his eyes were a flame of fire and his feet like undefined brass as if they burned in a furnace and his voice as the sound of many waters and he had in his right hand seven stars and out of his mouth went a sharp two-edged sword and his countenance was as the sun shineth in its strength i want to preach tonight on the sun that shineth in its strength and i want to preach this as my thanksgiving message tonight let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer heavenly father we thank you lord as we stand before your purchase of your blood two thousand years ago at calvary you purchased lord your people and lord we realize as we approach the pulpit lord that it's a serious thing that we're not handling it loosely so lord as we bow our heads we thank you dear god for an opportunity to gather in your name and lord to feed upon the bread of life we ask god that you call our nerves that every one of us lord would give our full attention to you and the lord that our hearts would be open in our ears to hear your voice lord quiet enough in our spirit that we can hear what you're speaking to our lives and i pray lord god that that our humanity would not restrict the moving of the spirit but lord your holy spirit would go minister to the needs of your people and father i pray that you bless this people lord i pray god that you bless brother aaron and you bless this church dear god and you bless its young people and you bless lord them in battle and you bless them coming and going and father we pray god that the holy spirit would just touch every heart in jesus christ mighty name amen god bless you saints you can have your seats tonight when jesus raised again he had come and he found peter no doubt peter was having a struggle in himself because peter knew that he had denied the lord and even in peter's weakness and failure jesus went right after him don't that make you feel good that he never writes you off when you make big blunders and that's this was a big one but he never writes you off but he goes right back after you and he said now we're going to build from here praise the lord and as he told peter he said peter do you love me peter said yes lord i love you said i want you to feed my sheep do you love me peter said lord you you know that i love you said feed my lambs peter do you love me and he said lord you know i love you amen that's the way god likes to hear it sometimes lord you know it's coming from my heart you know that i love you he said feed my sheep he told peter he said when you were young you went anywhere you wanted to go but when you grow old another shall guard thee and you will go where you wouldn't normally go and the bible said that the lord was telling him of his death and peter still quick at this trigger looked back at the one whom jesus loved following and he said and what will this man do and jesus said what's it to you if he tarry till i come he said follow thou me and there went out of saying that john would not see death but jesus never said that he just said what's that to you if he tarry till i come follow thou me and so we find as jesus spoke a word of prophecy to peter's life that the holy spirit actually led peter to crucifixion just exactly like our lord said but john had a very different destiny and because we're believers god leads us in different places and he take and in one size don't fit all we got to be very careful we'll say well god dealt with me this way that's the way he'll do it with you that way god doesn't work that way god has a purpose for every one here every life here you're to do a specific work for god and him alone and i'll say like the lord what's it to you what anyone else does follow the lord for your life peter had our paul or john rather had a very different walk in his life and we find john was arrested for preaching the gospel and they put him in a a boiling vat of oil and we know that the other disciples died and murder him but john his life was different god had a different a different place for him in the body and they boiled him in oil all night long and brother branham said they could not destroy him because god's purpose for john was not yet done amen god the devil cannot touch you until god is done with you i believe it was george whitefield and he said i am immortal until god is done with me praise the mighty name of the lord god was keeping john but then because they couldn't kill john they he was banished to the aisle called patmos now this is the one that jesus loved what's he doing in patmos isn't it a strange place that if god loved john that he would banish him to a prison island or rocky island about 30 miles around and scorpions and snakes and just the worst of the worst criminals why would god put a man that he loved in a place like that furthermore he's going to be left there to die he was in there for two years but he was going to be there left to die and it's at these times when the devil can really get in our minds it's times like this when we find ourselves on a desert island with rocks and lizards and snakes and criminals why i feel forsaken lord what am i doing here why am i here i would i mean i was walking with the lord i can help so many out there why would you put me here then he begins to you know how the devil can jump on you get in your mind and that's real dangerous when we begin to reason james i love james and he was thrust through with the sword and philip was crucified upside down or crucified on a stake and peter was crucified upside down and matthew drugged through the streets i loved him brothers lord and now i am here when is my turn you go right down through every one of those beloved believers that died so shamefully what am i doing here lord has anyone ever felt that way before and then we know very well the scripture said somehow in these conditions john got into the spirit i was in the spirit on the lord's day without a friend on a dessert island i was in the spirit on the lord's day and there when he broke into the spirit the clouds moved back and he saw the sevenfold glory of his person he saw the lord as the sun that's shining at its power hallelujah brother branham said this he said you go out any day you want to and he said the sun is shining he said no you sometimes there's clouds and you can't see it but the sun is still shining and he said that's just like us you know we we get down we get gloomy on the great days and the rain and the storms but nonetheless the sun still shines you might not be able to see it but i want to tell you tonight that god is on the throne when you're in your trials god is still on the throne when you're sick god is still on the throne the sun is still shining but you know you have to be in the spirit because it's only faith that sees what god sees if we could see from god's perspective john got a very different perspective once god revealed his purpose to john we can oh and we ought to be thankful because john wrote us a personal letter from the lord and it was so we could make a rapture he was banished there and he wrote the book of revelation brother branham actually said john was too busy with telling people his testimony going church to church he said he had to get him quiet our trials ain't to hurt us sometimes it's to get us real quiet and get us spiritual in a condition we can hear from god hallelujah at the end he's screaming come lord jesus come john didn't have it so bad after all once he saw the clouds roll back once he saw god's purpose for his life and every one of you have a purpose from god if you're alive if you've got breath in your lungs you have a purpose from god but we don't see the purpose sometimes and it causes us to struggle because the devil will bombard our minds turn with me if you will grab your bibles turn to hebrews chapter 11. do you love the lord with all your hearts hebrews chapter 11. i saw brother fritz pop back in there and i was so good to see him he's a friend of the family good to see you all here tonight hebrews 11 verse 23 says by faith moses when he was born was hid three months of his parents because they saw he was a proper child and they were not afraid of the king's commandment see moses was born the very instrument of god this was the one that god would use to deliver his people according to the promise that he made abraham and this is not speaking of moses faith this is speaking this verse of his mother's faith and his father's faith by faith moses was hid when he was born his wife was the daughter of levi her her name was jochebed and she knew that god's hand was on moses the bible don't tell us how but brother branham said he believed by divine revelation she knew that this was god's chosen and that because she knew that her child was from god she was not afraid of the king's commandment she was not afraid she was not intimidated she knew somehow that moses must come through because when you have faith your fear drops away amen we don't want to be controlled by fear we want to be controlled by faith in the word of god can you say amen and she knew that god would keep his word god can't keep not keep his word she knew it and she had faith burning in her heart according to this verse but the bible said that she hit him for three months and when she could not hide him any longer they had to he was like a hot potato they had to do something with moses and brother branham said that she was crying and the you remember the story the witches were knocking on the door and they said we know that you got a baby in there and brother branham said they could tell that she was a nurse and mother and they said you're just a matter of time deary we'll get the baby brother branham dramatizes it really nice they call them policewomen these are the policewomen say we'll be back we'll we'll find that baby they searched and could not find it said the baby would why they'd hide that they brother branham dramatizes it beautifully so jochebed looks to amram said honey what are we going to do oh they're going to kill the baby god hasn't told us what to do what he said honey how many remember brother branham taught amram was a prayer warrior he said honey i'm oh i'm going to go upstairs and i'm going to pray and he said he prayed and poured his heart out to god and god gave amram a dream brother branham says this he said god gave amram a dream and gave him instructions how to make the ark and he said he told jochebed the pattern and of the ark that he saw and jochebed by faith makes an ark for the baby do you remember that brother branham taught that now jochebed made an ark and covered it in pitch and that word is the same word in leviticus that is used for the word atonement meaning there was an atonement between the baby and the devil between the baby and the enemy you have an atonement and you are immortal as long as you're doing god's purpose on earth hallelujah do you love the lord and he said at night because they could hide him no longer he said jochebed and amram they got up miriam and aaron and they snuck down to the river and he said that the kids are crying they're like papa you're not going to put the baby in the river he said we must be strong soldiers now god won't let nothing harm this baby we're being unctioned and led and moved by the holy spirit so they snuck down the street they snuck down to the river and there he said that he said now he said we're going to put the baby in the river now remember every other baby is being put in the same river and the crocodiles are crunching them and eating them this baby is going in the same river but the difference between this baby and all the other babies is the atonement and so all that moses of miriam and aaron they kissed the baby and they kissed the baby said now nurse the baby before we put it in the ark and so mama nurses the baby and and everybody's you know just daddy daddy is it gonna be okay he said god has to he won't fail us he gave us this baby god and he's pumping the the family full of faith they close the little lid and at this point is where faith begins to move i want everyone to listen very closely because brother branham said now this is unnatural for a mother to put her baby in death it's completely against human nature a woman will go through fire to save her baby but jochebed under the inspiration of faith takes this baby and said lord i don't understand my situation all i know is you gave me this baby and i know your hand is upon it but by faith you gave it to me by faith i give it back and brother branham said that jock a bed her eagle eye was piercing through the clouds and through the worry and through the fear and through the unbelief and she saw the promise of god and by faith she pushed that baby into the water and when she pushed that baby heaven stood to its feet hallelujah now god dispatched his angels and angels lined all the way down the nile river hallelujah why because there was a word of promise given to amram and given to jochebed and now the armies of heaven is guiding them when you have faith in god even when you can't see the sun shining it's still shining god is still on the throne when you follow the word he'll send his angels how many believe that hallelujah and we find because of that brother branham said now her eyes of faith she saw what god was going to do she knew by faith she believed behind the clouds behind this trial behind the darkness there was a living god that will take the baby to its destination the same living god will take you to your destination if we can look past the clouds and the trials that we go through god's purpose cannot be defeated you're fearfully and wonderfully made with a divine purpose and god is going to place you where he needs you and it cannot be defeated it cannot be hindered it cannot stand on the word of the lord trials will be there you won't always see the presence of god you're not it's sometimes it's raining and it's storming you don't know which way to go but god is faithful to his word everybody love the lord i love it because god's eye was on baby moses god's eye guided that little baby through the crocodiles and all the way to its destination amen don't you love the lord with all your heart i love the way brother branham said he said he called gabriel he said line them angels out but he said don't let nothing touch that baby they said where will you be lord he said i'll be at the receiving end god is at the receiving end he's calling you from the other side how many love the lord with all their hearts see but you must look through the clouds to see the sun shining in its power shining in its glory god never diminishes the holy ghost never diminishes god is still god right now hallelujah god brought it right to the alligator beds right into the king's palace now brother branham said now we may not be able to see it times it gets dark the clouds may hide his blessed face for a season but remember the clouds may hide his face but it don't hide him it can hide the sun from you but it's still shining behind the clouds and faith sees the sun beyond the cloud hallelujah even in your trials you're looking through those trials he said now hear moses mother in a conflict was a testing of her faith god was testing her faith and every child every son that cometh to god must be tried because god will test your faith now look god could have simply bypassed this whole thing and and he said but it's better when god gives you a test isn't that interesting he could have god could have changed the whole thing he could have made moses invisible and every time the police women come they're invisible and they're blind we know god can do that see but god made a custom-made test and he knew she was going to pass it your tasks are not to hurt you it is because god knows you'll bring the devil to shame oh yeah stand on the word of god bless the mighty name of the lord there is a veil right now according to the scriptures angels are right in this room and there is a veil of the flesh we do not see them but our faith declares them and we don't see them but we feel the effects of their presence can you say amen it is a veil that keeps us from seeing god it is a veil that keeps us from seeing that other dimension but it's there anyway remember at dolphin how gehasa said lord the syrians assyrians and elijah said there's more of us and there is them lord open his eyes and when he opened his eyes it changed the scene all together if god could open our eyes and let us see we are not barely making it but we are a part of the army of the lord of hosts and god will not be defeated and there's more of us than there is them it would encourage our hearts to see the sun shining in its power hallelujah you'll never see the son of god shining in his power until you break into that faith to see it god open our eyes like gaheza let us see lord that we're not the bible said we don't not look at the things which are seen but we look at the things that are unseen hallelujah when god spoke the sun he set the sun in its orbit and every one of us here none of us doubt the rising of the sun tomorrow there ain't no one here that's biting their nails and anxious do you think the sun's going to make it tomorrow brother no you have a full confidence that sun is going to rise you got perfect faith in that why because god spoke it and god set that son in order until it must obey god's command and did you know that the son of god died rose again and sent us a pentecost sent us an outpouring of the holy spirit and that has been shining for 2 000 years even in the dark ages even in the worst persecutions against the church even when the antichrist rose and the devil rode his horse riders god was still shining in his power because john john saw him walking in the midst of the seven candlesticks when they did not know he was there he was still shining when he didn't feel like he was there he was still there in the worst times of the church he was still there why because god promised i will never leave you nor forsake you now denomination has smothered out the word of god but the sun is still shining what trial is there among us what trial is there that would blot out the presence of god or break the very word of god god made a promise to israel and said as i set the sun in the heavens and i commanded the stars in their place so will israel always be my chosen and it is a witness that my word will never be broken is there a trial is there a place a depression an anxiety a spiritual condition that can blot god out of his word and and no he is still shining in his power how many can say men i believe that it shines every day now we don't see it because of the clouds because of our clouds because of our reasoning because of our humanity these clouds stand between us and god but he's still every bit what he was on the day of pentecost can you say amen and he is the same yesterday today and forever as long as there is a forever god is still god you love the lord what happens we get clouds of doubt uh greed selfishness clouds that actually break us away from the presence of god but what we must do is move those clouds away that's our job every one of us got to move these clouds away amen remember remember paul you know paul they were to loose from crete and the spirit of the lord said don't tell them warn them they should not loose right now paul said i i think there's trouble up ahead we should not lose ah who are you just a prisoner so they got on the boat and they hit troubled waters the bible said that they they had not seen the sun for 14 days and winds and gales and and squalls and there they lose all hope of even being saved every one of them brother branham said there were hundreds of sharks following the boat and they had not even seen a star or a moon or there was no hope at all sometimes we get there and paul was down there praying and the galilee brother bradham said and god gave him a vision and said paul i give you everyone on the boat not a hair of their head will be lost and you will stand before caesar so while the gales the boat is rocking and the people are vomiting over to sign the ship and paul comes out and said brother praise the lord he lost his mind he got seasickness he said praise the lord eat your heart to content none of us are going to be harmed praise the lord eat your sandwich brother brandon said he was eating on a sandwich what happened faith broke through the clouds of worry and fred and weary faith broke through till it caught the mind of god and god made a promise and said paul you will stand before caesar so paul he gets on an island and a viper bites him he shakes it off in the fire i've got to appear before caesar i think that's what we ought to do with our child is shake the devil off and say god promised me that i'm gonna make a rapture hallelujah but it takes your faith to rise above that trial hallelujah in that storm the sun was still shining amen don't that make you feel good makes me feel good too you're not looking at the wind the gales the panicking ship members you're not looking at the condition of the ship you're not looking at the sharks you're looking at a promise you've got to get your eyes off of everything and focus upon the word of the living god you know that's how brother branham made it through lost his friends didn't have a church even with an open door he had to keep his eye on the word of the lord when he looked dried up there was a promise of us coming amen but in your trials you cannot look at those trials focus not even meditate upon them you have got to meditate upon the word and what you need to do in your trial is say god give me a scripture that i can tie myself to and let that become your absolute in your trial said god in my trial in my heartache give me a word and let god give you that word that will anchor you in the time of a storm then it's your revelation and then you can look that the sun is still shining in its power hallelujah look beyond the shadows look beyond the shadows of your physical body of your sickness of your oppression of your worry look beyond it and look to the promise of god and let the light break through in your life let his rays send his love and his power into your life there's people standing over the grave of their loved ones weeping and crying because bad things happen to good people weeping over a lost child that suffered and they're crying over a dead corpse but by faith we can look beyond and see a land of immortality where there will be no tears and no more sorrow where we will be reunited with our loved ones we can look beyond the circumstances even when we don't have answers we're a people that have information at our fingertips google it google it it's ridiculous sometimes god says no google i want faith in my word he does it and he won't answer you because he knows you're going to pass he knows you're a jockbit he knows you're an amram that'll take your life and give it into god's hands because you know there is a living god that sent this message there is a living god that is preparing us for his return hallelujah bless the mighty name of the lord eyes of faith will tell you he's here right now how many believe that eyes of faith will say you know what no matter how i feel even on a wednesday night service the lord is here right now amen we believe that with all of our hearts i like what brother branham said in later seeing church age he said he is working all things at this moment according to the purpose of his own will he's right in the midst of us all he said he's right in the midst of his church the great creator savior god is faithfully working amongst his own right now as the great shepherd of the sheep how many say i believe that his very existence is for his own amen the self-existing one who always was and always will be his existence is for you sometimes the clouds come over and said but he don't love you brother he forgot about this one but his very existence for us how many say i received that amen his very existence is for his own he loves them he cares for them his eye is ever upon them and when the word says your lives are hid with christ and god it means exactly what it says hallelujah oh i'm so glad that my god abides faithful he is true to himself he won't lie he is true to the word he will back it up he is true to us he will lose none of us but he will raise us up at the last day and i'm glad i'm resting on his faithfulness he is shining in his glory and in his power but it's only to the believer did you know the bible said jesus was the light of the world and that he had the light of life i want you to think that jesus is shining in his power the sun that's what john saw i saw the sun shining in its strength you know the sun when god said let there be light the great sun came over the earth and there were seeds in the earth and that sun commanded those scenes seeds to bring forth of its kind and it brought forth wheat and fruit and garden to feed the earth because the sun equals life but it was only a type of a much greater light than a light that would bring forth earthly life mortal life or botany life but when the son of god rose in his power he brought forth immortal life he brought forth eternal life if we could only get our souls under the presence of that son what god put in you will bring forth of its kind he will bring forth the full manifestation of the word of the living god get that word in your heart and let the sun shine in its power it will bring forth a body change a bride it'll bring forth healing it'll bring forth miracles because he's shining in his power amen our alcatraz our patmos isn't so bad after all when god is only working out his own glory he's shining in his strength he is a healer like he's always been but brother brenham said look he said those clouds they hang over the sun it only keeps it from shining if you get rid of those clouds he will be shining like he did on the day of pentecost how many feel that way god's word is eternal god said let there be there was you hold to that word no matter what comes or goes he's still god he's still your savior he's still on the throne amen that's what i love about jonah jonah swallowed you know jonah's made a big blunder and now he's swallowed by a whale his sins finds him out he's in the belly of a whale covered in seaweed but brother branham said you know it's our conditions these conditions cause our faith to rise because human beings will always take the path of least resistance we all love us we're like oh i believe it but i sure don't want to go down that path god will force you to it because he wants to show the devil what's in his children and so brother branham takes up for jonah and said no jonah was in a backslid god was guiding him the whole time god was in the storm god was in the sea god was in the fish god was everywhere he looked but because he was running from the presence of the lord he couldn't see god but god got him down to where he could have a good old-fashioned prayer meeting covered in seaweed he turns i don't know how he found his direction but he found the temple and he began praying towards the temple because god now was going to show even in the belly of the whale my power and glory is still shining and as soon as he looked beyond the well's belly and beyond his own failure and looked to him that was in the temple all of a sudden the power and glory of god fell and brought forth one of the greatest types of the bible of jesus christ god can reverse your mistakes god can show his glory and his power god can reverse the devil's curse and turn it into a blessing in your life but you got to quit looking at yourself and everything around you and you've got to anchor in the word of god and look to a god that will not fail you hallelujah bless the mighty name of the lord i don't know what time it is i can't calculate my time everything okay brother branham told a story in germany once there was a big painting on the wall and he said just look from from here to that wall maybe look hideous look like clouds and storms and gloom and and so forth bad atmosphere he said but as he got closer and closer to the painting he said it ain't clouds at all he said no the man the painter he said as he made it that when you got close to it it was actually angel wings beating together your trials isn't god's wrath upon you you've got to get closer maybe on your knees where you can look upright and you will find brother branham said it's actually your trials as a blessing in disguise you'll find your trials will put you in a place where god will bless you from there he'll put your soul in a condition he'll put your attitude in a condition he'll put you in a place to use you so all things say all things all things work together for the good that god is still on the throne that god is still your savior amen he's our shepherd how many can say yes i've seen that in my my own life you know dreary times it actually it was not god angry it was a blessing in disguise god turned it into a blessing when you're discouraged the devil can really pour it on you but you know brother branham said you were not meant to be depressed god did not create you to be that way you were created brother branham said this to be happy i did a study once in the in the discernment lines you would be shocked how many times brother brahm said go be healed and be happy go be happy that's a choice that you've got to make it's an attitude that you choose to take can you say amen so you don't want to be upset god has chosen you from the foundations of the world god has chosen you open your eyes to the blessed word of god in a world that hates god god has chosen you that god has equipped you with everything you need for this hour hallelujah that's where i want to tie in my thanksgiving thought because he said in everything give thanks oh we like to give thanks with the new car we love to give thanks and when the going is good thank you lord jesus hallelujah and you should but god wants us to be in such a place in our character that we can thank him in our trials knowing something good's about to happen oh yeah when it comes to god we know his nature we know who we're serving we know the family of god from genesis to revelation every time a trial comes god turns it on the devil and he hangs haman on his own gallows how he said lord change my attitude let me give thanks in everything now that is hard to do we need the grace of god to give thanks in our hard times and everything that's the scripture how many thank the lord who are talking about thanksgiving do you realize the heartbeats that you're having your in your chest right now that you have the ability to hear my words and your heart rejoices at the word of god god gave you the health to come to church tonight and every breath that god has given you come from our maker we're not prada we're not just you know apes just a product of circumstance we are created in the image of god almighty and that we are here listening to the word of almighty god there can't be a ripple in water except god allowed it to be god has not lost his power he moves everything according to and he makes things live by his laws your ability to comprehend your ability to to be here and to understand the word of god is just the grace of god in your life how many say thank you lord for the grace of god in my life god watches over his creation knows every hair on your head knows every bird that falls feeds every living thing on the face of the earth we have homes we have children and husbands and we have wives and you know we have a church have a pastor we have a we have a word we're not running without a message we have a message and we ought to be thankful this is thanksgiving thank you for pardoning me lord of my sins thank you for taking my sins and putting them in the sea of forgetfulness thank you lord so many spiritual and natural that we can say thank you lord god but we need god to open our eyes who was it that kept you from the accident who was it that turned you around at the right time and protected your life from being ruined god help us be spiritual we see a lot of natural help us to see the spiritual spiritual all spiritual blessings in heavenly places how many say lord open my eyes that i can be sensitive to the things of god now everything in your life will work for the good as long as you love the lord that's the secret that's the secret to christianity love god with all your heart love him just love him you can't go wrong loving him you know when you love somebody you still make mistakes but love is what holds it together in our trials we ought to be thankful in our hard times he's still god when my body don't feel good he's still god when i when i don't feel like a christian the sun is still shining he's still god he's still on the throne you say well there's all kinds of you know chaos around the message he's still god now i want to i want to turn this just a bit because he said give thanks in everything and it's very important the word thanks is a very important word two thousand years ago there was a little brother adam said a fifteen-year-old girl mary virgin come out of nasa no good thing comes out of nazareth she's going to get married to a widower she's carrying a little bucket early in the morning to the well she's thinking about i'm fixing to get married you know how girls how they do brother branham said she saw a light flicker and she turned nobody was there he said he was trying to cut her off she come around a little narrow way and there was standing gabriel and he addresses mary hail mary thou art highly favored before god you will have a son for he that is within you shall be called the child of the highest and she said how should these things be i don't know a man he said the holy spirit shall overshadow thee she said be it to me according to thy word now i want you to think let's go back you're that 15 year old girl what is joseph going to think are you going to be able to convince joseph that this is real what about your family what about your church what about your closest friends you've always had a reputation but are they gonna buy this one can you imagine the mind battles that the devil would have ensued upon her at this moment but mary the bible said did not do that immediately brother branham said she took god at his word and said beat unto me according to thy word and brother branham said she started thanking him hallelujah the scripture says that mary said my soul doth magnify the lord she began to praise god and thank him because he took her from a low place and set her in a high place brother branham said that 800 years before that isaiah spoke and that word went down through 800 years until it lodged in the womb of a virgin and when she began to thank god and praise god and testify it created an atmosphere around the word that was in her and she began to water the word that god placed in her womb and brother branham said god give us more memories not that we're entertaining the clouds of doubt if god is going to give you a baby god will make a way when there is no way god will take care of joseph god will take care of your family god will take care of your reputation and he did because he's still on the throne but we must create an atmosphere upon the word that god has sown into his church many times in the healing lines and i'm i'm conscious of the time i don't know what time it is but i'm conscious can we go a little further i won't i try i'm trying not to hold you along many times in the prayer lines you watch i love to study the discernments brother branham look says now the only thing keeping you from your healing he said is a cloud of doubt that it's hanging over you whoa he even said it's that thin he calls it a thin crust he said that it's keeping paralyzed people from rising from their gods sick people with cancer that they would be completely healed in a moment's time the only thing the only thing that's keeping them from miracles is a thin layer of unbelief wow wow i wonder if we could look into that dimension and see what is clouding brother bram said you're clouded sometimes it was sickness sometimes it was unbelief or what it ever was but here mary did not accept the cloud mary began to create an atmosphere of thanksgiving because thanksgiving we can thank him for what he's done but real thanksgiving is faith that looks to what he is doing and what he will do it looks through the clouds into the sunshine and can say when i'm sick in my body and when i don't feel good that i am healed and we can thank god that our prayers are being answered right now that god is hearing our prayers right now god is moving upon my requests you must water the word of god with thanksgiving not and we have a lot to thank him for as far as earthly but we have a thanksgiving in the spirit that we call those things that are not as though they were and brother branham said the reason mary did what she did is because she was a seed of abraham and abraham his body was wore down his wife was wore down but god gave him a promise and no matter how many trembles how many how they felt how barren she was and friendless she was god's word was still true and god was still shining in his power and he called those things that were not as though they were and he praised god for the promise that was on its way hallelujah i'm thankful that god will never leave you nor forsake you thankful that he's bringing you to the full measure of christ how many are thankful that we are approaching the coming of the lord brother branham said the least faith that you feel in your heart you better start thanking him when you feel that little move upon your soul you need to thank god for it whatever you're laying claim of in the scriptures brother branham he told this woman he said come here sister if you believe with all your heart you have an awful trouble you're fighting every day hardest thing to get over his nervousness mental nervousness skipping down a little bit he said you got to get up here then you believe and you're well and you go you believe you're healed then act like it go thanking god don't speak any more of your nervousness don't accept nothing that the devil gives you you go on and you thank god amen how many members it was between the first and second poll brother branham speaks of a man that sold his cow drove 200 miles to bring his wife to brother branham and the woman was demon possessed took five men to get her into a car and she kicked out every window in the car and so they put her in a cellar and brother branham said i'll go see her so he went there and he said when he came down the steps i believe it was in a basement if i remember i'm pulling way back i didn't familiarize myself fully with the story but you remember the story but i thought i'll try to be as accurate as i remember he goes down and it called his name the demon called his name william branham have nothing to do with me something of that nature and brother branham said i went to take a hold of her hand and she grabbed him he said she was 10 times stronger than her normal self he said she would have threw me across the room had not i caught her chest with my foot and he said he yanked away jumped up on the stairs and he said it went on its back and began to push hissing and it began speaking it hit her head and knocked her scalp off like a piece of her head and the husband said i told you brother branham he said what do we do listen to this brother branham said it called my name he said she's never met me he said satan called my name listen to this he said because he recognizes god's gift and because of that she will be well he goes what do i do he said take her back to the institution and go thanking god for her healing a demon-possessed woman 10 times stronger and delivers her by watering the word of god the next day she came to herself and was released and they appeared three weeks later in a meeting and said she's completely healed there is a power in your thanksgiving we appreciate turkey and appreciate stuffing and all of that but let me tell you like brother aaron said this is turkey and stuffing that comes from heaven and i think we ought to eat ourselves fat i think we ought to eat on the word of god and give god thanks for the word this seven course meal of the message of the hour that tells us how to conduct ourselves and how to live hallelujah you know listen to this brother branham said brother branham said now in this great room where the power of god is bottled down satan cannot stand where faith is no more than a person can exist where tear gas is falling that's a direct quote see because in the meetings you would see darkness collect and begin to fight and that's why you see epilepsy epilepsy cancer cancer you see they they unite they're kindred but then brother branham as soon as he preached the word faith would begin to unite and when faith began to unite and live satan was powerless he said and satan cannot stand in the presence of your faith no more than if we put tear gas in this room it would make every one of us leave and in the presence of your face say my faith in the presence of your faith demon powers must scatter as the son of righteousness arises with healing in his wings and the power and glory of god shine upon his congregation he is still shining right now in your life in your church in your situation in your sickness in your trial he is shining right now amen don't that make you feel good as long as there is a forever he is still shining how many say lord i'd like to see a revival in my life i'd like to come out of my negativity i like to come out of my criticisms i've gotten hard on god i want to soften up i don't want to feel this way i want to break the ice and break off this heaviness that hangs over me i'm a child of god i have been called predestinated to this hour i thank god for my calling how many can say thank you lord thank you lord for forgiving my sin thank you lord for healing my body thank you lord for the revelation of the holy spirit i think we ought to be a happy people i think we ought to water the word of god with our praises and i think we ought to make the devil feel real uncomfortable in services like this i think we ought to amen the word of god i think we ought to shout and say god be praised he's a living god he's mighty in battle and the devil ain't got a chance the devil ain't got a chance and he knows it you have an atonement between you and the devil he has no right in this church he has no right in your life you need to thank god for his shielding power the same holy ghost that shielded john in that hot oil is the same holy ghost that shields us i thank god for the holy spirit i thank god for the message of the hour i thank god that he sent a prophet to us i'm not ashamed of the gospel of jesus christ you know what the real thanksgiving is it's the holy ghost that god has sent down filled us with his presence leads us and guides us into all truth he'll bring you into a body change he'll bring you into a millennium he'll set you up on the very throne of god the very one that turned you around brother branham said that same one will say come up how many are listening to the call let's turn our eyes off of the earthly and let's like jock a bed let's commit our lives to god our children to god and look to him who will never fail trusting his purpose for our lives trusting his leadership for our life can you trust him when you don't know what next step why am i in patmos why

beams of love breaking through the unbelief and the fog of the lies of the devil that he puts over us i want you to look up to him and say lord i do trust you [Music] lord take away lord this this
