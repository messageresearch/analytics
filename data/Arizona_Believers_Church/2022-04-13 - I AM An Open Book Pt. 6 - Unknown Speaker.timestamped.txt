[0:00] 2 Corinthians chapter 3 just want to
[0:02] touch on it again real quick how he says
[0:05] the uh you are our letter or what we
[0:08] have written what was in our hearts we
[0:10] wrote out and expressed it to you now
[0:13] you are read by others therefore you're
[0:16] are known by others and this is you are
[0:18] introducing me you're introducing the
[0:20] Christ rather that we have ministered
[0:23] Christ ministered by us and then he says
[0:25] we are able Ministers of the New
[0:27] Testament so it's the he's ministering a
[0:29] new testament now jumping right into
[0:31] this and just picking up I'm reading the
[0:33] one of the last quotes we read Sunday
[0:34] morning in Harvest Time brother bam
[0:37] saysthe son of man so he's focusing on
[0:39] Luke 17:30 again we're continued on the
[0:42] series of I am an open book he says the
[0:45] son of man the word living itself among
[0:47] the people the word itself made flesh in
[0:51] you and I love how brother bam so often
[0:53] when he's describing the revelation of
[0:55] the son of man he takes it further than
[0:58] just a son of man revealing the son of
[1:00] man or even uh the son of man maybe
[1:03] being revealed through his ministry or
[1:04] the sign of the son of man he's always
[1:07] bringing it down to where the individual
[1:08] can make a personal connection with the
[1:10] word of God being made manifest so he
[1:12] says it's the word itself made flesh in
[1:14] you you are reflection of this hour the
[1:17] message so we could say you are a
[1:19] reflection of the message of the hour he
[1:21] says a reflection of it exactly what
[1:22] Paul was saying in his day I preach to
[1:24] you I write to you I minister to you you
[1:27] live it out therefore you are
[1:28] introducing the Christ
[1:30] uh that we are ministering he says you
[1:32] are a reflection of the message you live
[1:34] again live the life that was in Jesus
[1:37] Christ and this is an emphasis now in
[1:39] the revealing of the son of man that we
[1:41] are revealing the word itself is made
[1:44] flesh in us we read a statement also
[1:47] where brother says every born again son
[1:49] and daughter of God of this age is the
[1:51] interpretation of the word we recognize
[1:54] in the scripture how Jesus Christ was
[1:56] the interpretation of the word of God he
[1:59] was the interpret of God's written word
[2:01] in the Old Testament and now he's saying
[2:03] that every born again son and daughter
[2:05] of God of this age is the interpretation
[2:08] of the word you'll find in many places
[2:10] brother Brandon is focusing on the
[2:13] promise of this day the promise of this
[2:15] hour the promise of this time and how
[2:17] we've got to fulfill the promise of the
[2:19] time that we're living in if we were
[2:21] living in the days of Luther we would be
[2:23] fulfilling the promise of justification
[2:26] that would be the mystery was being
[2:27] revealed the truth that was being
[2:28] restored so we would manif EST that and
[2:30] then we could see how sanctification
[2:32] baptism of the Holy Ghost they had to
[2:34] live those things out so then it
[2:36] behooves us to take a step back and say
[2:37] well then what age are we living in what
[2:39] time are we living in what promise has
[2:41] to be manifest he said the Son and
[2:43] Daughters of this age are the
[2:45] interpretation of the word and we read
[2:48] it before brother brandom says in
[2:49] looking unto Jesus each generation
[2:51] reveals him in the full Revelation
[2:53] that's lotted for that time so each
[2:56] generation reveals him in the the
[2:58] Revelation that is given that is
[3:00] dispensed in that time and then he makes
[3:02] this beautiful statement this generation
[3:04] must reveal Jesus Christ so if the if
[3:08] justification made way for
[3:09] sanctification sanctification made way
[3:11] for the baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[3:13] the baptism of the Holy Ghost makes way
[3:14] for the Holy Ghost himself for Christ to
[3:17] step into the church he says this
[3:19] generation must reveal Jesus Christ and
[3:22] that's where we see all right if I'm a
[3:24] born again Son of God in this age I'm
[3:27] interpretation of the word my life is
[3:29] going to inter Christ in this age as we
[3:32] looked at it in John chapter 14 and I
[3:34] wanted to be very brief in my um summary
[3:38] how Jesus is saying that believe me for
[3:40] my work's sake I I speak unto you and
[3:42] you can believe me for my word's sake
[3:44] but my works also testify of me and we
[3:47] saw even how brother Bram said Jesus's
[3:49] life interpreted the word his life
[3:51] interpreted the word Christ The Works of
[3:53] Christ were the interpretation of the
[3:55] written word brother I said he
[3:56] interprets his own words now this let me
[3:59] say this why I want to read from doors
[4:00] and door Christ's actions interpreted
[4:03] the written words of the Old Testament
[4:05] so when it comes interpretation brother
[4:06] B says in doors and door he interprets
[4:09] his own words by making it live and
[4:11] vindicating it to be so so how is God
[4:14] going to interpret his word by making it
[4:15] live so God is not one that interprets
[4:18] it by by explaining to us it's not an
[4:21] explanation that interprets it but when
[4:23] God says let there be light and all the
[4:24] Angels could sit there and say well I
[4:26] wonder what Let There Be light's going
[4:27] to look like and God's going to say well
[4:29] what it's going to look like and what it
[4:31] means is and he could begin to try to
[4:32] describe it and they'd be like all right
[4:35] can you interpret the interpretation but
[4:37] when he brings it to pass you don't you
[4:39] can't argue with it do you realize right
[4:42] now we could take the word of God we
[4:43] could take quotations of the message
[4:45] there take the Bible and interpret what
[4:47] the Millennium is going to look like and
[4:49] we can do it all day long but then you'd
[4:51] still need an interpretation of our
[4:52] interpretation because we're not going
[4:54] to know exactly what it's like until God
[4:57] actually fulfills it and bring it to
[4:58] pass you say well brother brandham said
[5:00] such and such brother brandham
[5:01] prophesied well he's he's still a
[5:03] prophet and he's prophesying and so
[5:06] there can still be a symbolic
[5:07] representation in what he's prophesying
[5:10] so you're only going to know until God
[5:13] manifests it and brings it to pass so he
[5:15] interprets his word by making it live
[5:18] and vindicating it to be so so we've
[5:20] been looking at I am an open book we
[5:22] took Jesus Christ as the Fulfillment of
[5:24] the Old Testament we see that the bride
[5:26] is going to be the Fulfillment of the
[5:28] New Testament this new test opened up
[5:30] the Bible becoming a new book then
[5:32] there's a there's this interpretation in
[5:35] making the book live and in Christ is
[5:37] the mystery of God revealed I hope maybe
[5:39] some of you have gone and looked at that
[5:41] again and read it listened to it some it
[5:43] is such a uh important part of the
[5:46] preaching of the Seven Seals he said
[5:48] talking about the Christ coming to take
[5:50] the book and to redeem the book he said
[5:52] that all that is in this book would be
[5:54] him for that's the believer the words in
[5:58] the book the believer are the they are
[6:01] the words in the book all that is in the
[6:03] book is the believer so you are the
[6:05] written word you're the words in the
[6:07] book and he said and the word is him so
[6:09] when he comes around and it is the
[6:10] rising of the sun it's not he's teaching
[6:11] something new he says she is him she's
[6:13] bone of his bone flesh of his flesh she
[6:15] is him because she is the word for all
[6:18] that is in the word is the believer
[6:20] that's the believer the word's in the
[6:22] book and that's what he's coming to take
[6:24] and and at this time of
[6:26] redemption now I want to pick back up
[6:29] and question and answers on the seals I
[6:31] think that kind of reintroduces some a
[6:32] few of the
[6:33] statements that were very important to
[6:36] our our framing our thought on Sunday in
[6:39] um on last sun or on Sunday we read some
[6:43] extensive statements where brother Bram
[6:45] is talking about you just go on and live
[6:47] a Christian Life we living in the time
[6:49] where certain things are happening and
[6:51] you just go ahead and live a Christian
[6:52] Life go to church be a light live humbly
[6:55] just go ahead and just be humble stay
[6:57] right with the plain message just a real
[7:00] solid San Christian now and then he even
[7:02] gave us the example of John the Baptist
[7:04] and and how they're they asking the
[7:06] question is the bride going to have a
[7:07] Ministry oh yeah it's going to be a
[7:08] great ministry going to Big be big
[7:09] Ministry but he said how they they were
[7:11] challenged that God was in Simplicity
[7:13] working in Simplicity and even John
[7:16] himself was looking for something big
[7:17] and great and it was so simple till that
[7:19] Prophet even missed it and he was saying
[7:21] and he was even using the language of
[7:23] John uh as John would have said the same
[7:25] things in his day as brother Brandon was
[7:27] saying in this day you remember those
[7:28] things how we could see that parallel
[7:30] now I'm going to back up to paragraph 82
[7:32] and I'm going to read um until uh
[7:35] paragraph do you have that did I have
[7:36] that slide in there brother John to
[7:38] paragraph 92 um so this is another this
[7:40] is the second question brother brandham
[7:42] is asked and the first question I had
[7:45] some statements I was going to use but I
[7:47] just realized it's probably going to be
[7:47] pressed for time first question is asked
[7:49] about the 10 virgins the wise and the
[7:51] foolish virgins and then this is the
[7:53] second question should evangelist
[7:55] continue on the field that might seem to
[7:58] be a strange question but I believe
[8:00] these questions were by people who are
[8:02] sensing the urgency of the hour and if
[8:04] you thought that was a strange question
[8:05] should evangelist continue on the field
[8:07] just several months later brother Ram's
[8:08] going to preach souls in prison now and
[8:10] he's asking himself is it too late I've
[8:13] got children out there that aren't saved
[8:14] I got family is it too late and so this
[8:17] is not an of based question based upon
[8:20] the events that were transpiring he says
[8:22] in this hour of course certainly by all
[8:24] means don't change a thing if Jesus is
[8:27] coming in the morning Preach Today like
[8:29] it was going to be 10 years from today
[8:32] but live like it's going to be at this
[8:33] hour that's that's powerful write that
[8:36] down if you need me to email it to you I
[8:37] will he says if Jesus is coming in the
[8:40] morning and again it's a hypothetical if
[8:42] Jesus is coming in the morning you're
[8:44] going to preach as if it's going to be
[8:45] 10 years ain't that remarkable even some
[8:49] ways you're getting some insight into
[8:50] how brother Bram has been impressed with
[8:52] the subject matter that he's dealing
[8:54] with and so there's there we can't we
[8:56] can't take the subject he can't take the
[8:58] events that are transp spiring and get
[9:00] all weird with it to change what
[9:02] Christians ought to always do and that's
[9:04] live close to God live a Christian Life
[9:07] don't get weird don't withdraw yourself
[9:09] and so he's having to he's kind of
[9:11] having to attack that and so he says we
[9:13] must must preach even if it's going to
[9:15] be tomorrow preach like it's going to be
[9:16] 10 years but live like it's going to be
[9:19] at this hour and that's the key I'm
[9:22] wanting us to realize is that if God is
[9:24] going to interpret his word by making it
[9:26] live and vindicating it to be so this is
[9:28] critical to even the subject matter at
[9:31] hand if he says he's coming in 10 years
[9:33] preach or coming tomorrow preach like
[9:35] it's going to be 10 years from day but
[9:36] live like it's going to be at this hour
[9:38] and he says don't get scrupled up now
[9:41] that's what I'm trying to warn you about
[9:43] see just don't be odd peculiar don't
[9:47] change anything but if you're doing
[9:49] something wrong or doing evil repent
[9:51] come back to God and then and so he
[9:53] comes back to the question continue on
[9:55] your Evangelistic service just as you
[9:57] always did and you say well we're not
[9:59] evangelist what should we do he says if
[10:01] you're building a house put it on
[10:03] up if Jesus comes tomorrow be found
[10:05] faithful at the duty so if you're
[10:08] building a house keep building the house
[10:10] right if he's if he's coming if he's
[10:13] coming 10 years from now if he's coming
[10:14] 20 years from now if he's coming in 10
[10:16] minutes don't change anything keep doing
[10:18] what you're supposed to be doing he says
[10:20] he says be found faithful at the duty if
[10:22] you're building your church go on put it
[10:24] up he says I'd rather be putting my
[10:26] money in something like that than be
[10:27] found with it in my pocket see just keep
[10:30] on continue as you are everybody
[10:32] understand now continue right on just go
[10:35] right on as you are now just don't stop
[10:38] and do nothing just go right on just as
[10:41] you are keep on serving the lord think
[10:45] this is very important and we might feel
[10:46] like I I know there's maybe a an
[10:49] attitude that that would take the
[10:52] emphasis of these statements and say
[10:54] well what brother Bam's doing is he's
[10:56] minimizing and taking away from the
[10:58] importance of the things that have
[10:59] happened and he's saying you know what
[11:01] nothing's really changed just keep doing
[11:02] what you're doing but I want us to look
[11:04] at it different and and accept that
[11:08] there has been a taken of the book
[11:09] there's been an open of the seals it's
[11:11] been a supernatural thing happening he
[11:13] says I'm sure you recognize the
[11:14] mysterious part of the week and he's
[11:16] emphasizing all these tremendous things
[11:17] that have happened and he re he's aware
[11:21] of all the carnal of impersonations and
[11:24] all the damage that could be done and
[11:26] all the crazy ideas that people could
[11:27] come up with and all the traditions
[11:29] that would still very stubbornly uh
[11:32] stand up and still try to add itself to
[11:34] this truth so he said he sees the truth
[11:36] of the hour he said there's only one way
[11:39] that this is ever going to come to its
[11:40] completion only one way this is ever
[11:42] going to Climax and that's if the real
[11:44] believer who can take this into their
[11:45] heart can continue to live it out am and
[11:48] he's emphasizing this keep on serving
[11:50] the lord and he uses this example now
[11:53] for instance if you was working for a
[11:54] man and you knew in 15 minutes before
[11:56] quit it was 15 minutes before quitting
[11:58] time well you'd say it's just 15 minutes
[12:01] more so I might as well just go over and
[12:02] sit down says you'd get docked for that
[12:05] 15 minutes if you're planting wheat
[12:07] plant your wheat if you're digging
[12:09] potatoes go on and dig them out if
[12:11] you're building a house build it if
[12:12] you're Building a Church build it if
[12:14] you're planting wheat plant your weed if
[12:15] you're digging potatoes go on and dig
[12:17] them out say well nobody will eat them
[12:18] that doesn't make any difference dig
[12:20] them out anyhow just continue on as you
[12:23] are amen now I I want to say this and
[12:27] it's kind of maybe a different subject
[12:28] or takes a step further but what what
[12:32] strikes me in saying this when you
[12:34] realize that brother brandham uh uh
[12:36] emphasizes how the Holy Ghost has to
[12:37] have preeminence and it has to work so
[12:39] freely through the believer and there's
[12:40] a yielding to the the Holy Ghost and he
[12:43] begins to work through us to the point
[12:44] to where it touches all those who've uh
[12:47] received the spirit he says in one place
[12:49] it draws the rest of them from the grave
[12:50] and we go in the Rapture that's
[12:52] happening as you live your life as you
[12:54] live close to the word of God as you
[12:56] replicate the very nature of Christ in
[12:58] the way that you live act and treat one
[13:00] another and that's as a brother would be
[13:02] Christlike as a sister would be
[13:04] Christlike as children honor their
[13:06] fathers and mothers we're all doing our
[13:07] part if I can say this for this thing to
[13:09] finish
[13:10] up and and I want to use it in this
[13:13] light in knowing that I'm I maybe
[13:15] leaving some to be desired and backing
[13:17] it up with the scripture and the message
[13:20] but our way to a body change is is
[13:23] farming and if you want a body change
[13:26] just keep on farming just keep on living
[13:28] keep on on doing what you're told to do
[13:30] keep on doing what the Bible says don't
[13:32] get weird stand off fold your arms and
[13:34] say I'm just looking to the sky waiting
[13:35] for the Lord to come don't do it it's
[13:37] never going to happen that way you've
[13:39] got to keep living the life and doing
[13:41] what you're called to do and that's our
[13:43] way to a translation amen and I believe
[13:45] that's why he's emphasizing this so
[13:47] plainly if you plant wheat plant your
[13:49] wheat if you dig potatoes dig them out
[13:51] oh well no one's going doesn't make any
[13:52] difference dig them out anywhere just
[13:54] continue on as you are so he says I this
[13:58] is ining in the very next paragraph I
[14:00] got a letter from somebody the other day
[14:02] somebody told them well the times at
[14:04] hand sell the farm now you won't need
[14:05] that food that you live off of on the
[14:07] farm because just the mum's going to
[14:09] start and you won't need it so just go
[14:10] ahead while the tribulation period's
[14:12] going on your children's not safe so
[14:14] just let the children have the farm
[14:15] where they can eat off of it but but you
[14:17] all sell your farm and he said something
[14:19] like that I said oh my so what was the
[14:21] attitude well the millenniums come and
[14:23] sell the farm or give it to your kids
[14:26] whatever it's time just to change what
[14:28] we're doing and and all of a sudden stop
[14:30] he says oh
[14:31] my if I knew he was coming tomorrow and
[14:35] I was a
[14:36] farmer I'd put my crop in
[14:39] today and again I I think that we have
[14:43] to give some real weight to what he's
[14:45] saying if I knew he was coming tomorrow
[14:47] and I was a farmer I'd put my crop in
[14:49] today how many of us would do
[14:52] that I mean if and I I appreciate it
[14:55] that's our conviction that's the way way
[14:56] it should be if I would think that if
[14:58] I'm a lawyer and I knew the Lord was
[15:01] coming tomorrow I may not want a lawyer
[15:03] today like well you know that opinion is
[15:06] not going to be worth the paper it's
[15:07] written on to come tomorrow right you
[15:08] know I'm not going to be able to finish
[15:09] this contract and what's the point and
[15:11] it'd be really easy in our minds to
[15:14] be if you knew the clock was going to
[15:16] strike you're going to be off in 15
[15:18] minutes you and you sit off and you're
[15:19] going to slack a little bit doesn't it
[15:21] frustrate you when you walk into any
[15:23] business establishment and it says they
[15:24] close at 5: and you walk in at 4:45 and
[15:27] like oh sorry we're closing like no
[15:29] you're not the sign says fine you need
[15:32] to serve me you need to you need to
[15:34] provide this service whatever it might
[15:36] be and we get that way about just the
[15:39] services that we demand in the world
[15:40] today well let's use the same mindset
[15:43] when it comes to serving God and living
[15:45] for God if you knew he was coming
[15:46] tomorrow don't slack off do your
[15:49] responsibility do what you're asked to
[15:51] do do what you're called to do he says
[15:53] if he if I was a farmer and I knew he
[15:54] was coming tomorrow I'd put my crop in
[15:56] today if he made me a farmer I'm going
[15:58] to stay right at my duty he says if he
[16:01] made me a mechanic what can you say stay
[16:03] right at your duty if you're building a
[16:04] house if you're planting weed if you're
[16:05] planting potatoes if you're put building
[16:07] a church if you're a farmer a mechanic
[16:10] what do you do stay at your
[16:12] duty so the fellow came in and told his
[16:15] Pastor I'm going to give you the the
[16:16] second set of keys because the Rapture
[16:19] might come you know and I won't be
[16:20] needing it
[16:27] anymore backhanded conf to the pastor
[16:30] you know I want you to have my keys in
[16:32] case the Rapture comes he says so that's
[16:34] making res res ready isn't he goes all
[16:37] right but that's the way it
[16:41] is saying that there's a right way and
[16:44] he says we must be sane solid Christians
[16:47] sane solid Christians he says and I put
[16:49] here to work right I'm put here to write
[16:51] work right up to the last minute I've
[16:53] got a job to do and I'll be right found
[16:56] faithful at the post of Duty must be
[16:59] sane solid I I got a work to do and I've
[17:01] got a job to do and I must be found
[17:03] right faithful at the post of Duty
[17:04] notice how this keeps coming up be found
[17:06] faithful at the duty be found faithful
[17:08] at the stay right at my duty be found
[17:10] faithful at the post of Duty if he comes
[17:13] in the morning I want to be standing
[17:14] right here in the
[17:16] pulpit and you say brother brandom if he
[17:18] was coming this morning shouldn't you be
[17:20] out there no sir this is my post of Duty
[17:25] and he's saying this over and over again
[17:26] in relation to the coming of the Lord he
[17:28] says if the Lord coming in the morning
[17:29] shouldn't you be out there and he goes
[17:31] no this is my post- of Duty so let's get
[17:34] this in our minds whether he comes in 5
[17:36] minutes or 50 years you have to be your
[17:38] posted Duty doing what you're supposed
[17:41] to do he says this is my post of Duty
[17:44] I'll be standing right here preaching
[17:46] when he comes saying the same things I
[17:48] am then when he comes I'll just move
[17:51] right on out with him amen takes this
[17:53] idea of just kind of waiting waiting
[17:55] around looking at the sky and some
[17:57] traditional model of the coming of the
[17:58] Lord and it puts us in this channel of I
[18:00] got to keep living the life he says just
[18:02] go ahead and just be humble and go right
[18:04] on with the same plain message this is
[18:06] what he's wanting us to do just go on
[18:08] this is your post of duty standing right
[18:10] here preaching till he comes then when
[18:11] he comes I'll just move right on out
[18:13] with him says if I'm hoing potatoes I'll
[18:16] just be hoing away just as hard as I can
[18:19] when he comes I'll just drop the hoe and
[18:21] take off you remember in the Jubilee
[18:23] year if they were hoing with the hoe
[18:24] they kept on hoing they knew the Jubilee
[18:26] year wasn't maybe 10 minutes more and
[18:28] the trumpet sound at the Jubilee they
[18:29] just kept on pitching hay or whatever
[18:31] they were doing but when the trumpet
[18:33] sounded they dropped the Pitchfork and
[18:35] gone that's it just keep on pitching hay
[18:38] until the trumpet
[18:40] sounds I'd love to spend more time
[18:42] emphasizing some of these things but I
[18:44] want you just to have that H have this
[18:46] established maybe just entering into the
[18:48] record as a church this is what brother
[18:50] bam taught at this time at the open of
[18:52] the seals at the time of question and
[18:54] answers on the seals before we come into
[18:57] him preaching on the seventh seal that
[18:59] night he's saying this is very important
[19:00] for us to do don't get odd don't get
[19:02] Peculiar don't be strange keep doing
[19:04] what you're supposed to be doing stay
[19:06] right at the post of
[19:08] Duty now in paragraph 349 this is
[19:11] question 42 you could realize see just
[19:13] how many questions brother bandam had
[19:15] this the question comes back around in a
[19:17] different sense and I want to read all
[19:19] the way to paragraph uh
[19:21] 365 he's asked this question question 42
[19:24] brother Brandon will the dispensation of
[19:26] Grace be over after you open the seven
[19:28] con seals again I believe that this is a
[19:31] very astute question this is somebody
[19:34] who's not just kind of knee-jerk writing
[19:35] this down but they're listening to what
[19:37] brother R I'm saying uh one of the one
[19:39] of kind of a lightning rod for a lot of
[19:41] discussion maybe sometimes just among
[19:43] ministers is the discussion of the Bride
[19:45] age and it revolves around the seventh
[19:48] Church age being over a a and some of
[19:50] the things that brother Ram said and
[19:51] he's point blank asked the question
[19:53] brother Bram is the leoty in church age
[19:55] over H and it may seem to be a very
[19:57] strange question in August of 1964 is
[20:00] the latan church age over and he says oh
[20:03] you must have you must misunderstood
[20:05] something that I said the question just
[20:07] wasn't somebody just what's the weirdest
[20:09] thing we can ask brother brandham it was
[20:11] based upon what brother brandham had
[20:12] been preaching that summer so you go
[20:14] back up a few moments and start
[20:16] listening everything he's saying you
[20:17] realize this was a very good question in
[20:19] light of the fact that brother Bram said
[20:21] and when the seventh Church AG is over
[20:23] and it is when he's preaching future
[20:25] home and so there was a truth there that
[20:27] people wrestled with we're trying to
[20:29] figure out so they come right out and
[20:30] ask the question and it's good that the
[20:32] question was asked because it allowed
[20:33] brother Brandon to answer in a way so
[20:35] that someone doesn't go too far with
[20:37] some of those truths that he was
[20:38] establishing in that wonderful summer of
[20:41] 64 and so now when he's asked this
[20:44] question will the dis is the
[20:45] dispensation of Grace over after you
[20:47] open the Seven Seals this is someone
[20:48] who's listening to C this the time this
[20:51] is somebody who just probably listened
[20:53] to the breach in other words they were
[20:55] there listening to it as brother B
[20:56] preached it and they're thinking oh wow
[20:58] the the lamb is going to come forward
[20:59] he's going to take the book and things
[21:01] are going to go quickly to the Jews and
[21:02] all the different things that they might
[21:04] be thinking about and he says I hope not
[21:05] no no friends don't get that in your
[21:08] mind just you just go right on dig the
[21:12] potatoes and go to church and right on
[21:14] if it takes place in the morning you
[21:15] just be found doing just exactly what
[21:17] you're supposed to be doing he says
[21:20] don't start when you do you twist the
[21:22] very thing away from the purpose that
[21:25] it's intended for I I want to come back
[21:27] to that here just a second we when you
[21:30] he says don't start and I would say this
[21:32] is just brother Aaron I I think he's
[21:34] saying when you get weird when you stop
[21:36] doing what a Christian's supposed to do
[21:37] and you start acting funny with it you
[21:39] start interpreting yourself he says you
[21:41] twist your yourself you twist the very
[21:43] thing away from the purpose that it's
[21:45] intended for if I get to put it this way
[21:48] you twist away from the very purpose of
[21:49] the revealing of the Seven Seals the
[21:51] Seven Seals was to give rapturing Faith
[21:53] to the bride those seven Thunders
[21:54] uttering their voices the revelation of
[21:56] these Seven Seals to give rapturing
[21:57] Faith to the bride says you twist away
[21:59] from the very purpose that it's intended
[22:01] for you get a little peculiar thoughts
[22:03] and you get your own ideas about things
[22:05] don't take your own idea just when you
[22:07] sit and listen to things like that say
[22:09] thank you Lord I'm just going to walk a
[22:11] little closer to you when you listen to
[22:14] Little peculiar thoughts when you hear
[22:15] people talking about their own ideas he
[22:17] says when you hear that you just say
[22:18] Lord I'm going to walk a little closer
[22:20] to you you say well I think he was
[22:22] talking about the Seven Seals when you
[22:23] hear that just say Lord I'm going to
[22:25] walk a little closer to you guess what
[22:27] you're probably not going to go wrong if
[22:28] that's what you always say to what you
[22:29] hear right you hear about the the ruple
[22:32] price getting crazy Lord I'm just going
[22:33] to walk a little bit closer to you right
[22:35] when you hear about I know it's rubal
[22:37] but my friends call it ruple so I call
[22:39] it ruple he said I'm just going to walk
[22:41] a little bit closer to you whatever you
[22:42] hear Lord I'm just going to walk a
[22:43] little bit closer to you he says don't
[22:44] quit work and say I'll sell out
[22:48] everything why why would this even be
[22:50] relevant why would he even need to talk
[22:51] about it if there wasn't something that
[22:53] was
[22:54] transpiring a scriptures being fulfilled
[22:57] that within the tradition view of these
[22:59] scriptures being fulfilled everybody
[23:00] thought this is it it's over we're in
[23:02] the Millennium we're in the tribulation
[23:04] it's all going to be over now the graves
[23:05] are going to be dug up at any moment by
[23:07] these angels if there if these things
[23:09] that were happening wouldn't have this
[23:12] wouldn't be easily misinterpreted and
[23:14] made a mockery then he's probably
[23:16] thinking wow this is no different than
[23:18] just you know anything any kind of
[23:20] meeting any kind of special service you
[23:22] just go on you get your healing continue
[23:23] on as you are don't quit work don't stop
[23:26] building a house don't stop digging to
[23:28] potatoes and could we say today that was
[23:30] really really good advice to the potato
[23:33] farmer in March of 1963 if he was
[23:36] thinking about selling the farm couldn't
[23:38] we say 60 some odd years later wow
[23:40] brother brandom that was really good
[23:43] advice I believe that we could say that
[23:45] it's really good advice to not sell the
[23:49] farm
[23:52] how he says don't quit working say and
[23:54] say I'll sell out everything and I want
[23:56] to read this story he says a man running
[23:58] up here the the other day from North
[23:59] Carolina those people from Carolina he
[24:01] said just before he left he said glory
[24:03] to God can you tell me where some great
[24:05] somebody was and I said no oh yes sir
[24:09] this guy is the president of the Auto
[24:10] mission I said the what the Auto mission
[24:14] I said I don't understand he said oh
[24:16] this guy's the president I said what'
[24:18] you say his name was he said brandom I
[24:21] believe something like that brown or
[24:22] brandom I said well my name is brandom
[24:25] and when you read this story and just
[24:26] imagine kind of like this routine back
[24:28] in forth this guy's all excited and
[24:30] remember brother BS answering the
[24:31] question should we continue is the
[24:33] dispensation of Grace over and people
[24:36] getting peculiar and Odd Ideas and he
[24:38] says uh well my name's brandom are you
[24:40] the president of the Auto mission no sir
[24:43] he said well where's the Millennium at I
[24:46] still don't know where Auto mission uh
[24:48] fits into this I'm afraid to Google it
[24:52] he said well where's the Millennium at I
[24:54] said I don't know he said why you mean
[24:56] it's going on right here and you don't
[24:58] know it I said no sir I don't he said
[25:00] well glory to God I got some friends
[25:02] come told me to quit work still had his
[25:04] work cloth on said brother I want the
[25:07] Millennium I said well I believe you're
[25:09] just a little bit confused aren't you
[25:12] brother and think how relevant this is
[25:15] to these events and transpiring because
[25:16] we may have friends I I know I even know
[25:19] of people that were friends with that we
[25:21] fellowship with uh early on with my
[25:24] family who went on to believing that we
[25:26] were in the Millennium well what because
[25:28] the seals are opened oh well then this
[25:31] is what must have happened and oh we
[25:32] believe that this has transpired this
[25:33] scripture has been fulfilled so then the
[25:35] next thing is the Millennium and it gets
[25:37] down to where all of a sudden you start
[25:38] making people God and you start making
[25:39] people the Christ and it gets all
[25:41] scrupled up so brother bandam is seeding
[25:43] these things right in the middle of
[25:45] preaching on the seals this whole idea
[25:47] of people are going to take this truth
[25:49] and twist it and make it out to be
[25:52] something different going to take it and
[25:54] twist it and make to be oh brother we're
[25:56] in the Millennium I want you to think
[25:57] very very spiritual about this brother
[26:00] bradam is preaching the open of the
[26:01] Seven Seals where the lamb has come and
[26:03] take the book he's going to come later
[26:05] on and preach the Rapture and say the
[26:07] Lord himself has descended with the
[26:08] shout and these things have transpired
[26:10] and what's going to be the carnal jump
[26:12] from that oh don't take communion and
[26:14] feet washing anymore we're in the
[26:16] Millennium now and all these and he's
[26:18] he's touching on that he's fighting
[26:19] against those very knee-jerk reaction to
[26:22] these things right while he's preaching
[26:24] this and he's able to provide a real
[26:26] life example in real time to where he's
[26:28] living some guy want to know where the
[26:30] Millennium was brother I want the
[26:33] Millennium I believe you're a little bit
[26:34] confused he said about that time a car
[26:36] drw up now just imagine this scene it's
[26:38] getting almost kind of comical a taxi
[26:40] cab pulls up and a woman jumps out and
[26:43] and he says this woman says hold it hold
[26:45] it hold it little woman come up there
[26:46] she said now you're going to pray for my
[26:48] husband and I saides ma'am what about
[26:51] she say well I understand you have to
[26:52] wait a month for an interview to get
[26:53] prayed for I said what she said yes sir
[26:56] but I'm desperate you got to pray for my
[26:57] husband I said sure where is he at bring
[26:59] him on the guy standing says do you pray
[27:01] for the sick too yes sir did you say
[27:04] your name was brandom and you don't know
[27:05] about about the
[27:08] Millennium he's like this is the guy who
[27:10] brought the Millennium he don't even
[27:11] know anything about it he goes well no I
[27:14] don't brother says no I don't I don't
[27:16] understand it just right in the Bible he
[27:18] said no it's right now people coming
[27:19] from everywhere I said where it's
[27:22] where's it at he said Jeffersonville
[27:24] Indiana right under the bridge
[27:30] he says and he says sir you've got me
[27:32] bested I don't know nothing about
[27:35] it he said let's go in and sit down
[27:37] maybe we can talk this thing over we
[27:40] did CU you realized this guy was
[27:42] thinking that something related to
[27:44] brother Ram's Ministry had ushered in
[27:45] the Millennium in Jeffersonville under a
[27:49] bridge and it was transpiring and he was
[27:52] and he got so caught up in it that he
[27:54] was even saying you mean you're the
[27:56] brother brandom you don't know nothing
[27:57] about the Millen
[27:58] that's just really interesting how
[27:59] stubborn some ideas can get like you
[28:01] know brother Bram introduced us to the L
[28:03] you know brother bram's God right so
[28:05] then you just go right and ask brother
[28:06] brandom are you God he's like no I'm not
[28:08] God I'm Not Jesus Christ I'm like that's
[28:09] exactly what God would say right and
[28:14] it's just a stubborn idea that you can't
[28:15] get out of people's heads so he says you
[28:18] see friends don't you ever desire a
[28:20] Ministry you know what I mean you be
[28:22] happy just the way where just hap be
[28:24] happy just where you are you just go
[28:26] right on
[28:28] amen find it very interesting don't ever
[28:31] desire a Ministry you be happy you be
[28:34] happy where you just you are just where
[28:36] you are just go right on
[28:40] am he says dig the potatoes go to church
[28:43] I want to come back to this dig the
[28:44] potatoes just go to church right on if
[28:45] it takes place in the morning be found
[28:47] just doing exactly what you're supposed
[28:49] to be doing don't start when you twist
[28:51] the very when you do you twist the very
[28:53] thing away from the purpose that it's
[28:54] intended for when you get a little
[28:55] peculiar when you have your own ideas
[28:57] when you take your own
[28:58] idea he says you twist the very thing
[29:01] away from the purpose that it's intended
[29:04] for what thing I I want to say he's
[29:06] talking about the revealing of the word
[29:08] that the the revealing of these
[29:10] Mysteries the open of the Seven Seals he
[29:12] says you twist yourself away you twist
[29:14] the thing very away from the thing it's
[29:16] intended for and remember the statement
[29:17] of the church age but God's intention
[29:19] for his creation man is to express his
[29:23] words in Genesis Adam was given the word
[29:25] to live by are we being restored back to
[29:27] this even condition part of that
[29:29] three-fold mystery of Christ he says a
[29:31] life lived by the word would be the word
[29:35] expressed so if we get odd and peculiar
[29:37] we stop working we withdraw ourselves we
[29:39] get clannish we get cultish we get
[29:41] strange we go gather under a bridge in
[29:43] Jeffersonville because that's where the
[29:45] millennium's at then you can't have a
[29:47] life that's lived by the word am because
[29:50] God's intention the very thing that God
[29:51] intended in the open of these Seven
[29:53] Seals the very thing that God intended
[29:55] by loosening the book is that there
[29:57] would be a life that would Usher in a
[29:59] life that would come forth and there'd
[30:01] be a people that would receive the word
[30:02] of God for this time and then their
[30:04] lives would interpret the word he
[30:07] interprets his word by making it live
[30:09] and vindicating to be so so then we take
[30:11] the word into our hearts we take this
[30:13] word into our bosom then we step out and
[30:15] we begin to live this word and then a
[30:17] life lived by the word would be the word
[30:19] expressed a life lived by the word would
[30:22] be the word
[30:24] interpreted Jesus said go ye therefore
[30:26] in all the world I I and baptizing them
[30:29] in the name of the father and of the son
[30:30] and of the Holy Ghost was that the
[30:32] word right well you're getting nervous
[30:34] right you're like well well let's talk
[30:36] let's sit down and talk about it are we
[30:37] talking about under a bridge in
[30:38] Jeffersonville where are we at on this
[30:40] that's exactly what Jesus said then what
[30:42] did Peter do what did he do when he when
[30:45] they begin to fulfill the word they went
[30:47] and baptize them in the name of Jesus
[30:49] Christ because this is now they're
[30:51] living that word and it's interpreting
[30:53] it's interpreting the word life lived by
[30:55] the word is the word expressed the word
[30:57] interpreted
[30:58] and I believe that the word here is
[31:00] brother R's answering these questions
[31:01] and now I think we've we've read from at
[31:04] least three
[31:05] questions and three questions from
[31:07] question and answers on the seals and
[31:09] there's this theme that you find in this
[31:12] I believe God is the word is being very
[31:15] deliberate in what it's saying very
[31:18] deliberate how it's answering these
[31:20] questions in order to preserve the right
[31:23] focus in our
[31:25] hearts you you we've seen the fanaticism
[31:27] that's been attached to these things so
[31:30] much F fanaticism to where the truth of
[31:31] it's even rejected they'll say well I
[31:34] don't want to become like those folks
[31:35] and these people do don't believe in
[31:37] this and they don't believe in that and
[31:38] it's the fanaticism associated with
[31:40] believing the seals are open or
[31:41] believing in the open of the word or
[31:43] believing that the third pool is being
[31:44] fulfilled or is is is still taking place
[31:47] within the bride they say we've seen the
[31:49] kind of nonsense that that leads to
[31:50] we've seen the path that that goes and
[31:52] they become scarecrows to this all
[31:54] because typically there's not a life
[31:56] that backs it up
[31:58] it gets associated with a lot of sarcasm
[32:00] a lot of worldliness and a a lot of
[32:02] deviating from other principles in the
[32:03] scripture of Holiness and and and the
[32:06] and the moving of the spirit and even
[32:08] the manifestation of gifts to a certain
[32:09] extent and H even communion and feet
[32:12] washing things just get abandoned
[32:14] because they they take these things and
[32:15] they completely misinterpret them and
[32:18] they make them into something they're
[32:19] not and so I believe brother Bram is
[32:22] whether he's being conscious that in
[32:23] 2022 this is going to be a challenge or
[32:26] he the word is God is just be putting
[32:28] this weight upon him to be very precise
[32:30] in his language so that the bride is
[32:32] left with the record to keep us focused
[32:34] on living the
[32:36] word because the promise of this age
[32:39] cannot be manifested if we have the
[32:40] wrong
[32:41] expectation cannot be manifested with
[32:44] the wrong expectation we've got to have
[32:46] the right
[32:49] expectation now I'm realizing I have a
[32:51] lot more um I should have known that
[32:54] reading those lengthy statements would
[32:55] give me a little bit more time typically
[32:58] like I said I come up here with maybe
[32:59] just one page of notes I'm like that's
[33:00] going to be about an hour anything more
[33:02] is going to be longer than an hour on a
[33:03] Wednesday night I don't want to go that
[33:04] long but when it's um sometimes it's
[33:06] these very lengthy statements we go
[33:08] through them quicker so if I if I'm
[33:10] short tonight I apologize I'm probably
[33:13] just barely 58 every time I preach I'm
[33:17] short question and answers on the seals
[33:19] I want to come back to a statement we
[33:20] read on Sunday take my advice as your
[33:22] brother don't put your own
[33:24] interpretation
[33:26] anything now hear this kind of in light
[33:28] of what we just what we just uh read
[33:30] these these two questions that brother
[33:32] Bram answers just go on and live a good
[33:35] Christian life because you only wind
[33:38] yourself away from the real thing when
[33:39] you do
[33:41] it if you can keep in mind these two
[33:44] things these these statements that we've
[33:45] just had where brother bradam is saying
[33:47] you just build your house build your
[33:49] church be found Faith both the duty if
[33:51] you're planting wheat plant wheat
[33:52] digging potatoes dig potatoes be uh you
[33:54] know just stay right at your duty if
[33:56] you're a farmer
[33:58] be found right faithful at the post of
[33:59] Duty this is my post- of Duty dig the
[34:02] potatoes go to church hold potatoes home
[34:04] just as much as you can keep on pitch
[34:06] and hate till the trumpet sounds over
[34:07] and over thank you Lord I'm just going
[34:09] to walk a little closer to you because
[34:11] if you don't you're going to twist
[34:12] yourself away from the very thing it's
[34:13] intended for and this was intended God's
[34:17] intent and purpose is that a life would
[34:18] be lived by the word so in the very
[34:21] outset of this just go on and live a
[34:22] good Christian life because you only
[34:24] wind yourself away from the real thing
[34:26] when you do it you're only wind your way
[34:28] from the thing he said all of you are
[34:30] conscious and know there's something
[34:32] mysterious happening and it's happening
[34:34] and I know what it is and I've been told
[34:37] you told you before so just don't try to
[34:39] put any interpretation but just believe
[34:41] me as your brother we living in a great
[34:45] hour now I I was fellowshipping with
[34:47] brother Andrew on this um earlier this
[34:50] week and there's uh I I I'm alluding to
[34:54] it somewhat and I realize I'm doing it
[34:56] without maybe the the recent
[34:58] backgrounding and I'm relying a lot on
[35:00] your your knowledge of the message of
[35:02] the hour but remember in the vision that
[35:04] three-part vision of the of what we call
[35:08] the third pool and how even the fishing
[35:10] and then the lacing the booty and then
[35:12] coming to the cathedral or the tent in
[35:14] that series of Visions brother bandam is
[35:15] told you explained it too much and the
[35:19] language he uses quite often after that
[35:20] is you don't explain this don't say too
[35:23] much it won't be a public show and he
[35:25] talks about how I'm Duty bound and I'm
[35:27] oblig to the spirit and I was warned by
[35:29] the spirit don't say too much and I had
[35:31] the the statements from the seventh seal
[35:33] maybe to read tonight but I wanted just
[35:35] to leave them off for another time where
[35:37] brother says I have it written right
[35:38] here in my notes stop there don't go any
[35:40] further right and maybe we mentioned
[35:42] that Sunday how even brother Bram after
[35:44] he went after he continued on before he
[35:47] closed that service he had to come back
[35:49] late or he came back the next morning
[35:50] and recorded in a hotel room something
[35:52] to replace what he had said because he
[35:54] felt checked in his spirit that maybe he
[35:55] had said too much and what was he
[35:57] talking talk about that whole time that
[35:58] very Vision that very that very
[36:00] happening there in sainia Canyon the
[36:02] Fulfillment of that Vision he had about
[36:04] the tent and so he's he's very feels
[36:07] very very cautious to explain too much
[36:10] or say too much so when he says where he
[36:12] says I know what's happened but don't
[36:14] just put interpretation to it we're
[36:15] living in a great hour he says we're
[36:17] living in a time where the well
[36:20] were right can just imagine maybe he's
[36:23] wanting to say something maybe maybe he
[36:25] feels like this is there's something he
[36:27] feels like he wants to say he says well
[36:28] you just be real humble be a Christian
[36:30] and try to live for God and live honest
[36:32] with your fellow man and love those who
[36:33] don't love you don't try to make
[36:35] yourself any you see when you do you're
[36:37] only making a mysterious something and
[36:39] mess the real program of God
[36:42] up so you can twist yourself away from
[36:44] the very thing it's intended and he
[36:46] talks about getting off the path and he
[36:49] says here that you just go on and live a
[36:50] good Christian Life or you just wind
[36:52] yourself away from the real thing and
[36:54] you mess the real program of God up so
[36:57] we can say the real program of God and
[36:59] the intention and purpose that God has
[37:01] cannot be fulfilled unless we continue
[37:03] to live the
[37:04] life unless we continue to walk in these
[37:07] truths unless we continue to express in
[37:10] our manner of life and our conduct the
[37:12] nature of
[37:13] Christ just be humble be a Christian
[37:16] live for God live honest with your
[37:18] fellow man and love those who don't love
[37:20] you how could we argue with
[37:22] that why would any of us reason with
[37:25] that as that as not being a part of the
[37:27] solution
[37:28] is not being the proper outcome of the
[37:30] word of God feeding on the word of God
[37:31] and being in his divine presence now I
[37:34] want to um I want to close with going to
[37:37] our text and I when I say close I still
[37:39] have um some things to read here to you
[37:41] in 2 Corinthians chapter 3 I'm glad that
[37:43] we do have time to look at this 2
[37:45] Corinthians chapter 3:
[37:50] 1-6 let's look at this in detail again
[37:58] Do We Begin Again to commend ourselves
[38:01] or need we as some
[38:02] others Epistles of commendation to you
[38:06] or letters of commendation from you
[38:08] whether we want to look at it in the
[38:09] sense of attesting to who he is and his
[38:12] qualifications some Commendation that
[38:14] recommends him it's it has its roots in
[38:17] introduction and a proper Testament of
[38:19] who he was do we need a letter from you
[38:22] attesting to who we are do we we have
[38:25] Epistles of commendation to you so you
[38:28] receive me or letters of commendation
[38:29] from you that speaking of who we are and
[38:32] and what we're our characters are our
[38:34] character is and he says ye are our
[38:37] epistle written in our hearts known and
[38:40] read of all men now in this image then
[38:44] Paul has something in his
[38:46] heart and he says what's in my heart is
[38:49] now known and read of all men it in
[38:54] you so you have become as men read you
[38:58] and as men know you they are knowing
[39:00] what was in my heart so and whatever is
[39:03] in Paul's heart we can't see right even
[39:06] if we we we digging into someone's heart
[39:08] you cut it open and look into it you're
[39:10] not going to see what Paul's talking
[39:11] about what's in Paul's heart is in a
[39:12] mystery it's hidden and then there's
[39:14] something that's deep within his heart
[39:15] it's within his bosom and he says but
[39:17] you now become the very thing that's
[39:19] written in my heart you are now that
[39:22] epistle you are that letter which is now
[39:24] known and read of all men and so he kind
[39:25] of amplifies it in verse three for as
[39:27] much as ye are manifestly declared to be
[39:31] the Epistle of Christ ministered by us
[39:34] how is it that they are the Epistle of
[39:37] Paul's heart that is now read by men and
[39:40] read by men known of men because they
[39:43] you are manifestly declared they were
[39:45] manifestly declared to be the Epistle of
[39:48] Christ ministered by us so the letter of
[39:51] Christ the writing of Christ the very
[39:52] thing that Paul was ministering he says
[39:54] you have manif you are manifestly
[39:56] declared to be that which I ministered I
[40:00] preach I write I exhort I lift up I I
[40:02] share I I I I deliver the burden that I
[40:05] have in my heart and the word as I lift
[40:07] up Jesus Christ he says but now you are
[40:09] manifestly declared to be that which I
[40:12] have written to be that which I have
[40:14] ministered and that's how you become
[40:16] what was in our hearts the the living
[40:18] out of what I have ministered he says
[40:20] written not with ink but with the spirit
[40:22] of living God not in tables of stone but
[40:25] in the fleshly tables of the heart so
[40:27] where is it written it's it's not in the
[40:29] stones as he refers back to the law it's
[40:31] not what's engraved in tablets it's not
[40:33] even what's written in the Scrolls he
[40:35] says it's what's written in your heart
[40:37] it's what's lived out in your
[40:39] life he says and such trust have we
[40:42] through Christ to God word what is he
[40:45] trusting that that there is a what he's
[40:48] ministered what he's labored the bird
[40:49] he's delivered from his heart is
[40:51] received into the hearts of people and
[40:53] lived out that's the proof that's the
[40:55] Vindication not that we are sufficient
[40:57] of ourselves to think of anything as of
[40:59] ourselves but our sufficiency as of God
[41:02] and then I I wanted to continue to this
[41:04] because this is very a very pronounced
[41:06] scripture in the first few parts of this
[41:08] series who also hath made us able
[41:10] Ministers of the New Testament remember
[41:13] he said in verse three you are declared
[41:15] to be the Epistle of Christ ministered
[41:18] by us so we've ministered you are the
[41:21] Epistle of Christ which we have
[41:22] ministered and he says we are ministers
[41:23] of the New Testament not of the letter
[41:26] but of the spirit for the letter kth but
[41:27] the spirit giveth
[41:29] life now you having to gather want you
[41:31] to gather a lot of things together I'm
[41:33] hoping tonight I I had a piece in my
[41:35] heart to preach these things tonight
[41:37] because I thought you know the the
[41:38] people will be able to gather get
[41:39] together these things and and I w't
[41:42] necess have to start connecting the dots
[41:43] but you can start doing it now because
[41:46] what is the New Testament what are the
[41:48] Seven Seals it's the seals upon the book
[41:50] The Seals of the New Testament right so
[41:53] he said that there's the New Testament
[41:54] is sealed with Seven Seals he says the
[41:57] bride right is the New Testament he
[41:59] talks about the whole the Bible becoming
[42:00] a new book he says it's he says it's of
[42:02] the New Testament and what is Paul
[42:04] saying we are able Ministers of the New
[42:06] Testament and and he's and he's laying
[42:09] out this thought of how this this
[42:12] pattern of what is in my heart I
[42:15] Minister and you receive and we'll come
[42:17] to maybe some scriptures next week on
[42:19] how he said from you from you sounds out
[42:21] the word of God we preach the prophet
[42:23] preaches ministers preach behind the
[42:25] pulpit and you think oh my brother Aaron
[42:27] has an opportunity and he and he gets to
[42:29] preach and he preach preaches on Sunday
[42:31] morning preaches on Wednesday and I have
[42:32] the same audience every time and I and I
[42:35] I preach but you go out and you live and
[42:37] you have your congregation you have
[42:39] lives that you touch and there's some of
[42:40] you they're going to have exponentially
[42:43] more opportunities to impact lives than
[42:44] I will behind the pulpit and you'll do
[42:47] it because the manner of life that you
[42:49] live out in public and how you handle
[42:51] situations and the and the opportunities
[42:53] that you have to say the right thing do
[42:55] the right thing dress the right way
[42:57] respond the right way and it it becomes
[42:59] even more and more pronounced to me how
[43:01] it's very easy to kind of slip into
[43:03] certain ways of acting when we're at the
[43:05] work crowd with we're a hobby crowd
[43:07] we're different people and we can talk
[43:08] the language that they talk we could
[43:10] talk about the things that they enjoy
[43:11] the things that they like and we can
[43:13] kind of just to simulate and have a
[43:14] camaraderie around certain things with
[43:16] people in the world and they'll walk
[43:17] away and never have any greater
[43:19] knowledge that who you are really are
[43:22] and what's in your heart what's in your
[43:24] bosom and what you love and what you
[43:26] care for and what's what means the most
[43:28] to you wouldn't you hate till all of a
[43:29] sudden find out one day and you say oh
[43:31] sorry I missed that meeting and I was in
[43:32] church and they go you're a
[43:34] Christian or what church were you in the
[43:36] meat church I know you like to smoke
[43:37] meat what church were you
[43:40] in and they don't even know that you
[43:42] have this desire for the things of God
[43:44] why because it's your life it's because
[43:47] you've you you're not you're not living
[43:49] the life even in your language and your
[43:51] likes and your dislikes and your tastes
[43:53] and your
[43:54] Pursuits but this is a book then SE
[43:58] the seals are opened what does it Loose
[44:01] if the bride's the New Testament and the
[44:02] seals loose the New Testament what does
[44:04] it Loose it's loose the
[44:06] bride and so this very scripture you are
[44:08] epistle written in our hearts known and
[44:10] read of all men I want to read this
[44:12] statement brother Maham says that about
[44:13] Enoch and Elijah he says oh Christian
[44:15] what an opportunity we have we have
[44:17] opportunities that St Paul never dreamed
[44:19] of
[44:20] having I like that statement we have
[44:23] opportunities that St Paul never dreamed
[44:25] of having is A peculiar statement
[44:28] wouldn't you think that that in itself
[44:29] causes you to pause and think he says
[44:31] Elijah and Enoch so you realize there's
[44:32] this emphasis on the Rapture but it's in
[44:34] the Easter seal April 10th 1965 oh
[44:37] Christian what an opportunity we have we
[44:39] have opportunities that St Paul never
[44:40] dreamed of
[44:42] having I want you to think about in
[44:44] light of what he's saying you are an
[44:46] epistle written heart known and read of
[44:47] all
[44:48] men we don't even need a letter of
[44:50] introduction you are introducing what
[44:52] was in our heart you're introducing what
[44:54] I was preaching you're manifestly
[44:56] declared to be the Christ that we're
[44:58] lifting up the Christ that we are
[45:01] ministering now take this statement and
[45:03] join it to this quote I want to read my
[45:06] a lengthy quote to close the service
[45:08] from the voice of the
[45:09] sign and I want I want to this statement
[45:12] we have opportunities that St Paul never
[45:14] dreamed of having now let's just not let
[45:16] that stand on its own listen to what
[45:17] brother man says here he said what did
[45:20] Paul have the rest of them didn't have
[45:23] he had the abundance of the revelation
[45:24] of the word of God because it was Paul
[45:27] who recognized that Jesus of the New
[45:28] Testament was the Jehovah of the old he
[45:30] had the revelation of it and he says he
[45:32] wrote it and revealed it because God
[45:33] permitted it to be added to the Bible
[45:36] and the word comes only by the Bible by
[45:39] the prophet so the words in the
[45:41] Bible have come by the Breath of God
[45:43] come by his
[45:44] inspiration he says and so then God
[45:48] revealed to Paul and he wrote the
[45:50] letters inspired and God put them in the
[45:52] Bible I hope you're kind of tracking
[45:54] what I'm saying like like putting this
[45:56] in the context of what we've ministered
[45:58] on these these first five services on
[46:00] this that there is the written word in
[46:02] the Old Testament was Christ the written
[46:05] word in the New Testament you're living
[46:06] out and you're fulfilling so now brother
[46:08] bram's kind of he's looking at this from
[46:10] this perspective God revealed truths to
[46:12] Paul he wrote letters inspired God put
[46:14] him the Bible oh my revealed that his
[46:16] Christ of the Old Testament because he
[46:17] met him he couldn't understand how the
[46:19] pillar of fire was that was the one that
[46:21] led his people out of Egypt that was the
[46:23] one that had been with the Hebrews all
[46:25] through the age and here he is he seen
[46:27] him he said Lord what is it you want
[46:30] with me he said I am Jesus he seen that
[46:33] this one that had led his people that he
[46:36] knew all the time that Moses met the I
[46:38] am was everpresent same yesterday today
[46:41] and forever was manifested in the flesh
[46:44] this is now the recognition that this
[46:48] Jesus of
[46:50] Nazareth is the is now one it's the
[46:53] pillar fire here's he struck down by the
[46:54] pillar fire he says Lord who art thou
[46:56] he's called him this is Jehovah who are
[46:58] you and he says I'm Jesus and he says
[47:01] whom thou
[47:02] persecutest so this was the Living Word
[47:04] In the Flesh of those Believers in that
[47:06] day that Paul is crucifying persecuting
[47:09] hunting down he says that word Christ
[47:11] the I am was manifest In the Flesh it
[47:13] was his Revelation he had it above any
[47:15] of the rest of them and so great until
[47:17] except he get exalted above the
[47:18] abundance of Revelation there was given
[47:20] to him there was given to him we know a
[47:23] thorn in the flesh he says what did he
[47:24] do this part I want you to catch his
[47:26] Revelation then was prophecy for
[47:29] today you catch that his Revelation then
[47:33] was prophecy for
[47:35] today think about brother BR says we had
[47:37] opportunities that St Paul never dreamed
[47:39] of having his Revelation then was
[47:41] prophecy for today it was the voice
[47:44] coming forth wrote in the Bible to be
[47:46] Vindicated today again he says
[47:49] hallelujah it's the voice being
[47:51] Vindicated again what he wrote because
[47:54] he was God's Prophet revealing the sign
[47:57] was speaking of something and notice now
[48:00] that Jesus now let me I just want want
[48:03] to stop there can you you catch maybe
[48:06] what would be my this would be my
[48:07] emphasis or how I'm reading it how it's
[48:09] striking me that he's saying that Paul
[48:11] wrote the Bible he wrote the New
[48:14] Testament practically we could give him
[48:15] this authorship of writing the majority
[48:16] of the New Testament and he wrote it by
[48:18] Revelation and he wrote these things in
[48:20] the word but his Revelation then that he
[48:23] wrote that is in the word of God which
[48:25] is the New Testament was prophecy for
[48:28] today so what Paul was writing then by
[48:31] Revelation that wasn't history it wasn't
[48:33] summation it wasn't explanation it was
[48:36] prophecy what even interpretation it was
[48:38] prophecy then Paul is writing things
[48:41] that would be Revelation then to Paul
[48:43] that would then be fulfilled in the time
[48:45] we're living today let this like Lodge
[48:48] in your your spiritual understanding
[48:50] that Paul's Revelation then prophesied
[48:53] of
[48:54] today even when Paul looked as if it was
[48:57] going to be happening very imminently
[48:58] and Paul was expressing things that he
[49:00] felt was transpiring in his time and in
[49:02] his the very moment he's living in to
[49:04] whatever extent things are being
[49:05] fulfilled then and there's a compound
[49:07] fulfillment or compound type we see that
[49:10] brother say his Revelation then was
[49:12] prophecy for today it was the voice
[49:15] coming forth wrote in the Bible to be
[49:17] Vindicated today
[49:22] again and then he says so there there's
[49:24] the voice that wrote the Bible's got to
[49:26] be V indicated again today how is it
[49:29] Vindicated through interpretation right
[49:31] through manifestation through living the
[49:34] voice that wrote the Bible the written
[49:35] word of God the written New Testament
[49:37] must be Vindicated today again and he
[49:39] says now the next slide and we notice
[49:41] now that Jesus when he come on the scene
[49:45] good we're there he says now we notice
[49:46] that Jesus when he come on the scene he
[49:48] was prophesied word he was the
[49:50] prophesied word so he when Jesus come on
[49:52] the scene he was the written word right
[49:55] so now when Jesus came on the scene he's
[49:57] the word that was prophesied he had a
[49:59] Ministry to fulfill he had a Ministry no
[50:02] to be fulfilled what was written of him
[50:04] what was written of him a Ministry to
[50:07] fulfill it and there's our par parallel
[50:10] again Old Testament new testament old
[50:12] testament bridegroom New Testament bride
[50:15] so just start thinking now in type of
[50:17] what we must do what we've got to be
[50:18] doing he come on the scene he was the
[50:20] prophesied word he had a Ministry to
[50:22] fulfill what was written of him said
[50:24] that the other night as I spoke to Copus
[50:26] and them oh fools and slow of heart to
[50:27] believe the word of God don't you know
[50:29] that Christ should suffer these things
[50:31] didn't all the prophets speak that he
[50:33] should do this and then enter into his
[50:34] glory he has to fulfill everything that
[50:37] he come he come to heal that it might be
[50:38] fulfilled he did this that it might be
[50:40] fulfilled wa what was written what was
[50:42] written what was written everything he
[50:44] done was to be fulfilling because he was
[50:47] to be the voice of that
[50:51] scripture he was to be the voice of that
[50:54] scripture here's Jesus Christ in his
[50:56] first first coming the word had been
[50:57] written it had been prophesied Jesus
[51:00] comes in fulfillment of Prophecy the
[51:02] Fulfillment of the written word so he's
[51:04] now the manifesting of the written word
[51:06] he is the interpretation of the written
[51:08] word and he says he has a Ministry to
[51:11] fulfill everything he did was fulfilling
[51:13] because he had to be the voice the life
[51:17] if I could put it that way of that
[51:18] scripture he had to be the
[51:20] interpretation of that scripture now and
[51:23] don't answer me and start throwing
[51:25] answers back to me but at least think in
[51:26] your mind if we had a breakout session
[51:28] right now and we all wanted to come up
[51:29] with our in our little groups what this
[51:31] would mean to us today what would you
[51:32] start thinking
[51:34] about what is it that you would start
[51:36] piecing together in your heart saying oh
[51:38] my this is the pattern that was laid out
[51:40] in Jesus Christ Paul's Revelation then
[51:42] that you are the epistle written our
[51:44] hearts known and read of all men you are
[51:45] manifestly declared to be the Epistle of
[51:47] Christ written by us we are ministers of
[51:49] the New Testament and I say this then
[51:51] one day that new testament there has to
[51:53] be a voice raised up and be the voice of
[51:56] that scripture there has to be a life
[51:58] that raise up and interprets the New
[52:00] Testament what would what would we come
[52:02] to our conclusion uh when when we got
[52:04] together and begin to rehearse things in
[52:06] our ears that we've heard are preached
[52:07] all these years that in the bride coming
[52:09] of Christ there would be another
[52:11] manifestation of the word of God in our
[52:13] day and it wouldn't just be a one-man
[52:15] Ministry but it would be individuals
[52:17] like you and I living out the prophecy
[52:19] for our time am everything he did he was
[52:23] fulfilling because he had to be the
[52:24] voice of that scripture who's the final
[52:26] voice to the final Age The Bride under
[52:30] her
[52:30] messenger so brother BR said now his
[52:33] bride will fulfill everything that's in
[52:38] the New
[52:39] Testament his bride will fulfill
[52:42] everything that's in the New Testament
[52:45] that's how I can say that not just I am
[52:48] but you are the open book Let's stand
[52:51] together tonight
