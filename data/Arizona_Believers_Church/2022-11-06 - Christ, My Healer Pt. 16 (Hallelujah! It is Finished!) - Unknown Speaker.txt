TRANSCRIPT
========================================
again the title Hallelujah it is finished we'll come to this towards the end and I think it'll be a real blessing to you this is um Lord willing and the Lord could always deal with my heart I just rely upon him he may lead me in a different direction to continue on this subject there's a lot in this subject to go to go through but it's been a long series that began with the goal of making Christ more personal to us and encouraging growth in the word of God through the last several Services we've kind of been dealing with the barriers to a believer's healing and how often those things relate to our mental approach to Healing so we dealt with chronic conditions of the heart and our vision kind of how we see things how we perceive things we dealt with forgiveness both in terms of forgiving other people but also asking for forgiveness and the role that plays in being sick and even the role that it plays in our healing and the last two services on phobia and pre-existing conditions we've been addressing wanting to get the fear out of our approach to Healing and fear out of approach to whether it be you know using something to help us to feel better or just even approaching God for our healing and one of the main things that we did in the outset through some of those Services the major leads to a minor and the minor and a major Tipping Point elevated Faith some of those things we are really look making the word the foundation so that in in everything that we do we realize God does it his initial and original way is by the word of God and we look to the word of God and we really want to focus on his promise in the word when we're seeking something and one thing we want you to remember as we finish this up that the purpose of physical healing is to point to the truth and reality of full Redemption but that's the that's the primary thing behind a physical healing a Divine Healing is it speaks of a new body that will never get sick and so those there's a cumulative effect of our faith uh being encouraged to take a deeper a deeper dive into the things of God and to grow and to be elevated so those are a lot of the things that we shared in the beginning and through several different parts is this is the 16th part so there's been a lot that we've covered and so today we're just wanting to look at a subject of praise and this belief in this conviction that it's finished according to the word of God if you'll take your Bibles and turn to First Corinthians chapter 6 I think we've read maybe a portion of this already it's been in my notes the last three or four Services we may not have gotten to it but in First Corinthians chapter 6 verses 18 to 20 just like to start this morning by identifying that God has this God has made this body fashion this body this body is the Lord's and so there's promises in the word that relate to our health and that it is it is a good desire to want to be well but then also how we have to keep that in balanced it says flea fornication every sin that a man doeth is without the body or it doesn't not just offend or it's not just the body itself but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body what know you not that your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you which you have of God and you're not your own so again Paul is saying that when a man sins there's a consequence to the body and it's not just consequences l elsewhere but I may have phrased that wrong at the outset that's the consequence in other places it's not just a sin against God or just a sin against his conviction but it's also a sin against his body he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body what know you not that your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you the Holy Ghost is in you tabernacling the tabernacling deity which you have of God and so whether that's the holy ghost or the body both are true but you have this holy ghost from God you're templing it and ye are not your own he says don't you know this that you are not your own you've been bought with the price you've been purchased and so he's wanting you to think about your servitude to Christ your submission to God for you are bought with the price therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit which are Gods so your spirit belongs to God your body belongs to God when your Tabernacle Holy Ghost that's in the soul and so if we were somehow to separate things out and say well the soul is sealed by the Holy Ghost then I have my spirit and my body we may think well the soul is owned by God but then these other two parts are kind of Freelancers or contractors but when you look at it you must realize the spirit and the body though not fully redeemed yet belong to God and so the body is the Lord's the body be in the Lords we should trust the Lord and honor the Lord in managing our health or looking out after our bodies and keeping it healthy and and even wanting to present ourselves the right way and Psalms 139 verses 13 and 14 I'll say this very quickly I've probably taken out more scriptures left out more scriptures than we're reading today on this subject because it's very very vast and very very deep for thou Hast possessed my Reigns thou has covered me in my mother's womb even that thought of possessing one's Reigns is very rich and very deep he said you've possessed me in that that seed of life you've possessed me even if some look at it the rains being delivered or the kidney or the innards and something you've possessed me there in that place and that Source you've covered me in my mother's womb it says I will praise thee from fearfully and wonderfully made fearfully that's fearfully made it speaks of even a delicate Arrangement how things are put together and you think about how intricate this body is and how it's woven together it says we are fearfully and wonderfully made marvelous are thy works and that my soul knoweth right well I wonderfully made it's this complexity that inspires all and anyone who studies the body and the biologist or nutritionist or medical doctors they really are in awe no matter how much they look at it and how much they can explain it and how much it makes sense there's this awe of the human body and how it works how intricate it is and how complex it is and how everything works together and all these different parts and their Arrangement it says wonderfully made which would be that all of How It's Made and then fearfully made because it's amazing how that this body how it's put together how delicate it is and how an injury just to one part can undo the whole and so you're fearfully and wonderfully made and this by God in Job chapter 10 verse 11 it says thou has clothed me with skin and flesh and fenced me with bones and sinews what a poetic way to describe the maker God himself he's clothed us it's by his design that he's clothed us with skin and muscle skin and flesh and has fenced us with bones and sinews it's describing the arrangement of the body that God is the designer of it that God when he brought man forth and he put that Spirit man into the flesh man the flesh man that he made he made it this complex he made it this way fearfully and wonderfully made this is something that God has done God has designed the human body he's arranged it and he's even watched over it as much as the devil has been trying to redesign and pervert things maybe I'll give just a little bit of a glimpse maybe this is a test here my title for this weekend in Europe is the Beauty and the Beast you like that and one of the thoughts that we're looking at is how that Satan has designed redesigned the woman and change things and he's the designer but God has watched out over Satan's attempt to pervert and defile and change and at the end of his Eden think about at the end of his Eden he would have loved to been able to produce a complete genderless race of people right and since he couldn't do it physically he couldn't do it literally he's trying to do it grammatically he's trying to do it through language he's trying to do it through a lot of different political pressures and so the Satan's the redesigner but even in that God has been watching over it to preserve it so you've heard the whole series you don't have to stream you don't have to get up early I think it's an eight-hour time difference I don't even know if it is going to be streamed but you don't have to worry about him God has washed over it so your body is the Lord glorify your body God in your body and your spirit which are the Lords then in First Corinthians chapter 3 maybe going a little bit out of order from chapter six but in chapter 3 verses 16 and 17 he asked this question already know ye not that ye are the temple of God and that the spirit of God dwelleth in you if any man if any man defile the temple of God he shall God him shall God destroy for the temple of God is Holy which Temple ye are so here's the Commandment to not defile our bodies it is in this Commandment that we find basis for a lot of things that we would not do to our body many things that people might think to be lawful are things that people might think to be of no consequence we recognize this body to be the Temple of the Holy Ghost therefore we are mindful of how that we would change this body or mark this body or dress this body or things that we might do to intoxicate or influence this body this is a tremendous basis for a lot of principles in the scripture to keep this body from any influence that is inordinate or any influence that would keep us away from God and in looking at this that man should not defile the temple of God and even these other scriptures we're looking at here there is a there is a Biblical prescription to take care of your health that we ought not to live recklessly We ought not to there's certain things that we might do uh that are that are harmful to the flesh or potentially very dangerous or even uh life-threatening that we ought not to do foolishly because this body is the Temple of the Lord this body is his and so we are to look out after it and I believe that we have a directive to care for our physical well-being because it is God's body it is not just our own well it's mine I can do what I want to with it I think that's kind of a common phrase a lot these days my body my choice and and that's kind of where the platitude that's where people stand and we have to realize that as Christians well it isn't our body right it's the Lord's and so with a lot of these different scriptures we could have used and I'm wanting to go as quickly as possible today knowing that you are all here for lunch I'm just kidding I don't believe that but anyway I do maybe it we could pick on anybody we haven't seen in a while like well we know why you're here but based upon a lot of these scriptures it's not a bad desire to want to be healthy if the body is the Lords and we've been fearfully made we've been wonderfully made and it God has clothed us with skin and flesh and he's fenced us with bones and sinews and it wouldn't be wrong to want that that skin and that flesh and the organs and all this intricate Arrangement it wouldn't be wrong to want it to be in harmony or want it to be well and to be functioning properly it is not wrong to want to be healthy it's not wrong not an inordinate affection to want to be healed of a sickness so to desire to be healed is a good desire to desire to be healthy is a good desire but it must be balanced that even in this uh the the well-being and even the satisfaction of our bodies the health of our body the harmony body even being satisfied with our appearance or satisfied with our health is not the goal of life like I want to be healthy and I want to be strong I want to be beautiful I want to be fast I want to be able to slam dunk I want to be able to Palm a basketball I want to be able to do the splits whatever it is might be that people sometimes can just make these little bucket list items they want to do and maybe those are all trivial in your book but we cannot make a certain weight class or a certain strength the physique or Wellness we cannot make Health itself the primary goal or our primary concern the in Paul and talking about the body and the body being the Temple of the Lord he says the bodies for meats and the bellies for Meats he's talking about there's certain things that are necessary for the nourishment of the body but ultimately the body is the Lord's and the body has to rely upon certain things to satisfy it in nutrients but the body is not for fornication he's saying there's a lot he's teaching a lot of things about the body and understanding urges and desires and keeping the body under subjection and so there's a certain balance that we need to have when either we want to be uh have a certain physical appearance or maintain a certain physique or or just be healthy in a particular lifestyle that promotes health and well-being and the wholeness of the body there's a I hope you understand I'm trying to identify maybe one way that we try to approach things we're always trying to be so fit and so put together and so healthy and then on the other side maybe you'll have a sickness and the only thing you're concerned about the only thing you think about in your entire life fits under this Paradigm of how can I remedy this sickness and in both those instances there's a danger where you put too much emphasis on looking good or too much emphasis on feeling bad and you're not balanced in the word of God in Philippians chapter 3 verse 19 Paul calling out the the heathens and the those who love not God and do not mind the things of God it says whose end is destruction whose God is their belly and whose glory is in their shame who mind Earthly things what does it mean that their God is their belly it's there's a it's there's a way that you can apply this in such a way to to and then it's looking at anything to which someone would crave or desire of their want or their ambition becomes their God their God is their belly their God is their health their God is their the way they look their God is what they desire to do whether it be through some sort of hobby or ambition or um getting some sort of thrill or Adrenaline Rush whose God is their belly whose glory is in shame their shame who mind Earthly things so we ought not to be those who just pursue after what our flesh wants so our body is not the God our belly our digestive system our health is not our God and we ought not just to be minding Earthly things health and happiness are promised by God to the believer it's an absolute promise in the word of God in terms of health and happiness I believe that God provides them he Faithfully provides them by God but in pursuing either of those faith has to be the driving force if we just pursue health for Health's sake alone a Believer is going to find themselves in a tough spot if you're just pursuing happiness for happiness alone you're going to find yourself in a tough spot so both Pursuits must be balanced and subject to him and this is one thing I'm just trying to close the loop on before we finish the series is there's a real danger in putting too much emphasis on the flesh to a real danger in putting too much emphasis on the hope of healing when I say hope not a faith but a hope in healing we touched on this last Sunday I believe it was second Corinthians chapter 12 verses 7 8-9 unless I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of Revelations there was given to me a thorn in the flesh the messenger of Satan to Buffet me lest I should be exalted above measure Paul identifying some detriment some deficiency in his flesh some a physical malady or problem to where he was we could say sick or had some sort of ailment and he actually caught a thorn in the flesh that he uh is being buffeted that is keeping him humble and he says for this thing I besought the Lord three times that it might depart from me and I was he he I don't know if it would just necessarily imply that just in three instances he prayed but there's at least three instances where he was seeking God these time periods or these instances where he said Lord please heal me please deliver me Lord this Thorn In My Flesh this messenger of Satan that is buffet in me oh God deliver me that I might be loosed from this infirmity that I might be well and better able to serve you and he says he sought God to be delivered from it and the Lord he says the Lord said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness what a remarkable answer that in my insufficiencies and in my sickness God is saying my grace will make up the difference my grace will make you self-sufficient in Christ in Christ you're self-sufficient despite whatever weaknesses you might have in the flesh don't pray that the weakness and the flesh be removed but trust in the grace of God to lift you above and raise you above that weakness this isn't a weakness or tendency to sin but anything that would be limiting in your physical ability or physical health he says my grace is sufficient for the for my strength is made perfect in weakness that where there is a weakness in your flesh it's an opportunity for his perfect strength so he says most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities that the power of Christ May rest upon me any way that I've ever read this or seen this I you know commented on or preached about that the glory and is in the actual weakness or in the infirmity and then it just struck me this way that therefore will I gladly in my infirmity continue to Glory though I am weak and though I'm sick and though I have an infirmity I do not need to be made well in order to Rejoice I do not need to be healthy my glory and my praise and my happiness is not going to be in the absence of the thorn of Flesh because his grace is sufficient and his strength is made perfect in my weakness then in my weakness and in my infirmity I will still glorify God gladly because Paul knew that affliction promoted Glory and that through affliction well he knew that Glory through Affliction was a greater Miracle than a supernatural cure he knew that the glory that comes to Affliction would be a greater Miracle than God supernaturally removing that thorn from his flesh and we use that principle to support what he says to Timothy in first Timothy chapter 5 verse 23 where he says don't just drink water only when you're sick drink no longer water but use a little wine for thy stomach's sake and thine often infirmities Paul showing that he cared about the physical health of his friend his son in the gospel that he cared for the malady whatever it was that was bothering Timothy and even these frequent occurrences of whether it be headaches or some sort of um illness that brought Timothy very low he says take a little bit of wine to cure this this Affliction in your stomach and for the other things that you seem to so often be experiencing and we touched on how this was a a balanced view of the Prophet the messenger of this age who has given the gift of Miracles who had signs and wonders followed him that he referred to something within Timothy's REITs it'd be very simple for him to do to address some discomfort or some sickness in himself and it was a balanced view on the sickness because he identified it and he was willing to talk about it but then he also was very balanced in his cure and as we could say maybe he wasn't really extreme with Timothy and so that was that speaks to Paul's balance of I may be sick but healing my sickness is not the end of all things that's not my that's not the only thing I'm worried about is oh I'm sick and the only thing I can think about the only thing I'm worried about is getting well and getting well and getting well there's a tremendous detriment in that I know that the ministry of brother Branham was focused so much on Divine Healing and I think we can all agree on that it's very hard to find um any time period where brother Branham is just kind of taken a step back from ever mentioning praying for the sick or Divine Healing and a lot of the emphasis that we see in his ministry as we have it on tape from 47 to 65 our prayer lines and prayer cards and signs and wonders and miracles and a lot of things transparent around the physical healing of the body and because of it so often mentioned and so frequent within his ministry it it would be I think it would just be natural for us just to conclude that this is what it's all about because it's the most predominant thing that you might find on the tapes and through his ministry but it's very important to take time to consider the context of brother Branham emphasizing Divine Healing and how often that it came up in the context of it especially when you take even the sermons that he preached when he was in Jeffersonville at his home Church where it's not a healing campaign and not everybody's coming to get a prayer card and be prayed for and then so if we look at it from the standpoint that brother Branham is often on the road preaching conventions and campaigns all over the world and all over North America and that when he was coming people the drawing card was this man prays for the sick and they get well this man can discern the thoughts and intents of people's hearts and and it'd be kind of this impetus to healing and so he would have these revivals of these meetings for the sake of praying for the sick and for the call of salvation and if brother Branham was to stay there uh even if he was there for 30 days as he wanted to do and sometimes he wanted to stay and just pray for all the sick there would come a point maybe I'm just making this assumption to where if Brethren's like well I'm here and I'm going to be here for a long time he would then begin to move into the deeper things and the weightier matters of the word of God to bring people who've been healed and been saved into deeper fellowship with Christ his ministry alone he said there's more to this ministry than Divine Healing more to this Minister than just healing the physical body so we got to look at the context of when brother Branham is emphasizing Divine Healing and it was in these campaigns and a lot of times people were coming with life-threatening diseases they were at the end of the road they were dying they were debilitated they had some sort of condition where their lives are completely turned upside down they weren't able to live their normal lives and they were actually coming to these meetings as even oftentimes as a last resort for their lives to be changed and God was using the Miracles and the signs and the Wonders we know to stir up Faith in the unbelieving and for the healing of some to catch the attention of others and and I'm acknowledging just how frequently that's mentioned and because it's there so much the very fact that it's there is enough for us to realize that that's in the atonement and that's for us whether it be the miraculous cure or just God mindful of your health and God provided that promise in the word of God it's it's there but we the danger I would say today is that this repetition this frequency just the sheer volume May overwhelm our view of what the message is for or what the word of God is all about and we can make the conclusion that the goal the goal then of preaching the goal of meetings the goal of the message the goal of any kind of scriptural Ministry or the most important thing is the health of our body and I think that's getting a little bit out of balance because this isn't a well body isn't our goal that that's not the the goal is not just to be healthy in this life we say a perfect body is our goal right A Change body and we know that if our faith isn't set right both foundationally and then directionally like if our faith isn't set right in the word of God but then what direction we're going if it's not set right then we suffer we're going to talk about if you if your faith is set right in the right position then it brings a constant satisfaction so if our faith is based in the word of God and then directionally it's to the word of God that brings satisfaction but if in either way foundationally or directionally it's not right then that's when we get discouraged that's when we grieve that's when we suffer because our faith isn't based right foundationally and it's not set right directionally Paul says this in Philippians chapter 4 verses 11 and 12 not that I speak in respect of want for I have learned and I think we ought to take this into the context of healing in whatsoever State I am therewith be content in whatsoever State I am there with be content I know both how to be a based I know how to abound a basement and abounding two different extremes everywhere and in all things I am instructed both to before and to be hungry both to abound and to suffer need Paul is is of the disposition and the character to say that whether I'm hurting or whether I'm healthy whether I'm sad or whether I'm happy or whether I'm Afflicted or bound abounding or a base then I'm going to be content I'm going to strive for contentment I'm going to be satisfied in Christ and no matter what I'm going through whatsoever State I am there with to be content this isn't the contentment is not resigned or accepting a bad situation but it's not allowing the situation to dictate your happiness is there there's the difference in this sense sometimes well I just don't want to accept it and I don't want to sign for the box of rattlesnakes uh so there's a there's a certain point where it says weatherman says oh you have cancer and you have to recognize you have cancer that doesn't mean I have to be resigned like oh well I guess this is my life and I guess I'm just going to die and I guess I just have to live with this but there's a way to say okay you know they said someone says to you and says well uh Marcus you've got stage four cancer okay all right that's quite the deal right and you you could say yes all right I get it and say well how could you be so kind of even kill in this moment well in whatsoever State I am I'm going to be content if God has allowed me to go through this then there must be a reason for it and there's a certain attitude that someone has towards it towards not all of a sudden and I know that's stage four cancer is pretty extreme but no matter what it is it's like we take it as a I have what an ingrown toe right and always think well how am I going to be able to run a marathon and what is that what if it gets infected and what if you have to remove it and is this a condition I'm going to pass down to my kids oh my goodness what am I doing all right he just says whatever state I am to there with be content now this is where I realize I want to share something and then and and then kind of pivot and I think this this could be such a large area that it might cause a lot of thinking and then when I get back in two weeks like brother Amber then we gotta talk but if Paul says if we just take these few things uh we've already we kind of set it up that the health of the body is important scripturally but then we're looking at this angle where Paul is some Affliction and suffering that it is oftentimes that even physical Affliction is for our benefit for God's glory and that there's there's a certain balance that we've got to take we've got to take a certain balance in this but in the day and age that we're living in it seems as if there is a thousand different remedies for whatever it is we're going through and that there's somebody promising relief if it's back pain there's a lot of different people telling you how they can get rid of that back pain if it's a cancer there's a billion ways to treat that cancer and so no matter what it is we're suffering with science and medicine and cures and remedies and all sorts of disciplines are telling us hey we can take care of that we can make that better and this is something that is well documented within the the medical community that there's a dark side to the hope that is created by medicine that when somebody is sick medicine gives them a hope that they can be well and so what ends up happening is they attach their future or their happiness or their lives to that treatment and so there's always well if this doesn't work there's this and if you don't if this doesn't work here then you can go to Mexico and try this and that doesn't work here you can go to China and try this and if this approach doesn't work you could try this ancient approach or you can try this trial medicine and there's a lot of different ways and maybe these are with more extreme cases or rare diseases but a patient a person who is sick is now looking at all these different opportunities and these avenues that they can go down to try to find healing and it creates this hope to where now they are hoping this isn't faith they're hoping to get well and there's a dark side to it because now the person in hope that they get well all they do is pursue the cure to get well and they fail to just live their lives and go forward they're not content until they can find the treatment that cures them and I believe that we have to be very careful with whatever it is we're asking God to heal us of that we do not create this false hope in any sort of cure or not even begin to get hopeful for healing but when it's true faith it sets our disposition very differently we should never just accept the sickness or be resigned well I guess I'm just sick but we can choose how we think about our sickness and we can choose how that we're going to go forward with our sickness you can take very conscious steps you can take definitive steps towards towards feeding your faith and believing in God and being content instead of just languishing in Hope chasing a cure Paul says there's in whatsoever State I am there with to be content and as this is an observable phenomena to if someone gets so caught up in being healthy then it becomes a hope and there's a dark side to it to where the person's getting more and more discouraged in the absence of a change or measurable benefits or something measurable that shows that they're improving and they're not living their life they're not going forward they're not serving God like they should they're not being faithful to their families they're not just saying you know what God has given me this life he's giving me this opportunity I'm going to keep living I'm going to keep serving in whatever state I'm going to keep going on yes do the things that you ought to do to take care of your health but don't stop and get this this image in front of you then unless this happens then nothing that nothing changes you have a choice how you can look at your healing you have a choice how you can look at your body and you make that choice and you go forward I want to read this lengthy statement from the sermon faith is our victory and this to me will kind of take us into this next step of this second half of the service this ties in so many different thoughts from the last few Services many of you have faith in your doctors and you should have if you've got a doctor now when something gets wrong with you you'll go to that Old Faithful doctor that you believe in that's what you should do now brother bam is uh very uh cleverly kind of setting up people whatever their expectations are and identifying that they have this attitude that when they're sick they go to their doctor and they just trust their doctor whatever he tells them to do to be well and he's again he has that balance where he's not going to condemn them for doing that but he says that's what you should do that's good and then you submit your case to him I believe we ought to realize that the faith he's talking about in the doctors is a Fidelity or a trust and not necessarily A Faith like you would in Christ he says if he says you should go to the hospital you don't do a thing but go home and pack up your clothes and take off to the hospital sure you got faith in the doctor and if he doesn't decide that you want to want to go to the hospital or you should go rather he will write out a prescription and give you a sack full of pills and you'll swallow them and you don't know what's in those pills but you've got faith in your doctor isn't is that not right that for a lot of people this is just the way that they do it it may not be your doctor but maybe it's some sort of uh somebody uh that is your health advisor or somebody who's advising you on your health that you go to to try to help you with your health and whatever they tell you to do they consult their book or they consult their Paradigm and they tell you to do it and we just say that's it I'm going to take your pills I'm going to take your potions I'm going to take your protocol whatever it is I'm going to do it he says it's because you have faith in your doctor and then he says how about God how about God then if this is the approach we would take with the doctor how about God and you're scared to swallow some of those some of the Gospels that he gives you by his stripes you were healed faith is the Victor that overcomes the world swallow it and see what happens it's a confidence now that to me it almost I I recognize the way the human mind works that well I want to drill down deeper into this and understand what faith looks like on this side because there's something measurable if I just do it the doctor says but it's in that approach that you'll just do what the doctor says and have that kind of confidence if you could have that kind of pure submission of your case to God he's saying if you could do that in the equivalent he says it it swallow it and see what happens take the gospel he says you show what confidence you have in your doctor by taking his medicine that you don't know what it is you show your confidence in the doctor by submitting yourself to an operation that proves your confidence in the doctor the fact that you submit the fact that you do and he says but when it comes to Christ you're so scared to take him at his word how is it faith is the victory you can submit your case to Jesus Christ tonight just as you submit your case to the doctrine you can do that now in the same way that you've trusted doctors in the same way that you've given them their chance in the same way that you've honored certain prescriptions and done certain things you were asked to do he says you could submit your case to the doctor give me anything you want to Lord You're the doctor on the gays Lord just move my faith tell me what to do let me take you at your word then you've got the victory then you've got the faith that overcomes and then listen to how a striking this is you'll never hunt another prayer line You'll never hunt nothing else you'll have it right there it'll be settled and you'll see the vein that he's talking about where this this point where your life tips and now only thing you're aware of is getting healed getting healed getting healed getting healed getting healed he says you'll never hunt another prayer line You'll never hunt nothing else you'll have it right there it'll be settled you'll never jump from church to church to see if this one's got it or that one's got it they haven't got it you've got it then when you've got the faith you have the victory that's the that's the we I want you to recognize that as Believers you'll always have this pill in your bag you'll always have this pill in your medicine cabinet you'll always have this in your life just settle it in your heart right now that that if you ever have need of it if you ever get desperate enough just believe that God faith is the Victory and that you can always take that gospel for what you're going through and he's identifying a place that you can't come by faith until you'll never have to hunt anything else again faith is the victory faith in what his word in Psalms 107 verses 17 to 22 this was some of the primary scriptures we used at the foundation of the series says he sent his word and healed them and delivered them from their destructions took a lot of time in the outset connecting salvation to healing and even how here even in Psalms 107 it's showing that man because of his witness wickedness because of his sin he has brought these things upon him and these calamities upon him but then in their distressed they call upon the Lord he hears them and he heals them and he says he sent his word and healed them now it's spoken in the past tense just as is by his stripes we are healed he sent his word and healed them and delivered them from their destructions and notice the very next verse Oh that men would praise the Lord for his goodness and for his wonderful Works to the Children of Men and let them sacrifice the sacrifices of Thanksgiving and declare his works with rejoicing this is what we have to do after we're healed he says he sent his word and healed them and delivered them then it says oh that men would praise the Lord for his goodness for his wonderful works for the children of men what wonderful works of Deliverance and healing let them bring sacrifices of Thanksgiving and declare his works with rejoicing what works with rejoicing the fact that he healed them and delivered them he this is this is exactly what we are to do this is what must follow healing is praise it says to praise the Lord for his goodness and so if I could put it this way that our demeanor and our attitude after we've been healed ought to be one that declares the goodness of God that promotes his glory that declares his wonderful uh goodness and kindness towards us it's a one of Praise one of Thanksgiving one of rejoicing why because you're declaring his wonderful work in your life this is what we ought to do if you're ever sick and you're healed and remember God is the Healer of all he's the one of all healing if there's any healing to God be the glory and so there's a way that you give God the glory through whatever testimony you might have of your healing and it says all that if you are healed if God sent his word and healed you if you find yourself well Hezekiah did not need to start a multi-level marketing scheme on on fig packs right or fig cakes but he could say thanks be to God the the Fig cake was applied and this press was applied and this pace was applied and God delivered me and God healed me and Hezekiah could stand there and describe his situation and express what he was going through and exactly how the prophet came and ministered to his need Timothy himself could say oh I used to have these stomach problems but Paul told me just to mix a little bit of wine in with my water and that took away that bitterness it took away that pain and it's been completely gone and my headaches are gone thanks be to God he made a way and I'm well rejoicing in Praise Spurgeon even in looking at this very scripture preach this I'm forgetting now just exactly where he preached the sermon it may I wish I would have written it down but listen to this I thought this was so instructive when a person is very ill one of the greatest kindnesses that you can show to him is to tell him how you felt under a similar affliction to what physician you resorted what remedies he prescribed through what process you passed what were the symptoms connected with your recovery and how long you have been able to Rejoice over the Cure which has been wrought in you I know that's maybe describes is descriptive on a number of levels in terms of wow uh do I have the same sickness and what was the approach and she's saying that this is this is uh this is again this is even balancing to me it was like well I'm I don't always want to just go on anecdotes or somebody else's experience but this is very true when you think about the word testimony and testifying that the greater kindness that you can show somebody who is sick with migraines is to tell them if you had migraines how that God cured you and the steps that you went through why because you're showing that I as a Believer submitted to this process and I find myself better he says and how long you've been able to Rejoice of the Cure which is wrought in you this kind of practical experiential talk will be far more valuable to him than any doctor's opinions that you may read to him out of a book of Medicine it's going to mean much more to hear from a Believer how that God wrought a miracle in their life then we're gonna then anything we can get from webmd.com anything you can get from Health on anything you can get from some some book of medicine that you're reading out tell the sufferer what your experience has been and you will generally find that he will attach more importance to that than to any Theory which you may propound to him however well you may support that theory by argument oh my goodness I need to start another series because think of how often we are theorizing right and just weighing in and giving our two cents well let me tell you something about about that particular disease well did you ever have it no but I've Googled it I stayed at a holiday in express last night and so I can share with you a lot of hot takes on your particular condition I've read this and I've read that well I was doing some research and it told me this and there's a whole and and Spurgeon is saying you know what if you've experienced it and you've gone through it and you're on the other side of it by you telling them your experience and by you testifying it's going to mean a lot more than all the theories you expound on no matter how much Google research you've done and can support it that the individual the person is going to put much greater emphasis on your testimony of how you were healed than anything else that can be added to it and I believe that's that's a caution to us and how sometimes we treat we approach other people's sicknesses and I believe that it measures us to where if we're going to testify God gets the glory God gets the benefit and I say herein lies the secret to our going forward whether to keep us from languishing in Hope or to keep us from that dark side that the the hope of medicine provides but it's the our secret in going forward to our healing because if we're even going to be healed if this is our is this if this is my disposition after I'm Healed is praise then why don't I just assume it now right you ever heard the phrase dress for the job you want not the one you have right I'm sure you've heard that before well how about you how about you start praising for the healing that's coming if you're going to be happy when you get healed why don't you just get happy now oh if I get healed I would do this well why don't you do it now whatever it is that you're putting off until you get healed if you are able to do it do it now this is this is the right kind of attitude to approach your healing if we had the right if with Paul with Paul's approach and I realize now I feel like I'm coming woefully short of making this point uh clear but if we could take Paul's approach to where with whatever state I'm in I'm going to be with content that the sufferings in this present time are not worthy to be compared to the glory which shall be revealed in us and that's the way that we approach life and I'm not going to languish and hope and make my body the God but I'm just going to live for God and all that I can do for him then you might find yourself focusing having your faith foundationally correct and directionally correct you might find yourself all of a sudden decades later living the full life believing in God stepping into a new body and having never been healed from that thought in your flesh but wow I lived a full life it didn't matter that I had this problem a lot of these things anymore that we get diagnosed with they're trying to put a sentence on you so you have to completely live under some sort of spell and I believe you could just take God's God at his word and go forward do what you need to do to dress it if it's medicine if it's therapy whatever it might be we can say that's not my Paradigm that's not my life my life I'm not a sufferer I'm not a victim of this this is not my sentence I'm going to take God in his word and I'm going to live and I'm going to go forward and I'm not going to wait until my back is straight to praise I'm not going to wait till my stomach is no longer sour to praise but I can begin now to live a life of worship to God regardless of this throne in my flesh far too often people let their sicknesses keep them in bed and out of worship and out of service and away from the body of Christ it's time to say I'm not going to wait till I get well to serve I'm gonna start serving them now [Applause] and that's the approach that we can take to our lives be much better off than just taking this approach well I guess I better do this and the best I guess I better do that you know I have this hope I have this hope I have this hope just start serving God with all that is in you it's a very this idea of Praise it's a very uh forms a very basis the beginning the end of The Lord's Prayer when he taught us to pray after this manner pray ye Our Father which art in heaven Hallowed be thy name with the salutation the salute to God this praise to God you begin it by praising him Hallowed be thy name and then in the closing of the prayer in Matthew 6 he says for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever amen what is this it's adoration it's praise it's being offered to Thanksgiving to him in Psalms 104 enter into his gates with Thanksgiving and into his courts with praise be thankful unto him and bless his name you cannot come before him without Thanksgiving you cannot enter into his presence without praise these are the keys to your entrance this is how that you in the similitude of Esther can approach the king so that he sends forth the scepter and says whatever it is you want why don't you ask when we come and we have not dressed ourselves with praise we have not dressed ourselves with Thanksgiving then it has it's not becoming to the god that we're approaching whatever you have need of if it's to know his will if it's to be healed if it's to get an answer on something if it's to know what the the decision to make you ought to come before him not with all help me help me help me help me help me but come with Thanksgiving in your mouth come with praise upon your lips that's the only proper way to approach the king when you have a request dress yourself with garments of praise dress yourself with garments of Thanksgiving Paul writes it in Philippians 4 6 be careful for nothing don't be anxious about anything can we say that together be careful for nothing and could you all say brother Aaron don't be anxious about anything tell me I need to hear it come on say it amen I accept it accept it for this trip I accept it for all the decisions and all the turns and all the travel whatever it might be I accept it because I shouldn't be anxious about anything and it's a nasty little bug you get anxious about getting anxious I'm not anxious but should I be anxious am I going to get anxious now I'm anxious about the fact that I'll probably get anxious but I'm not going to be anxious for anything but in everything I love that for in and and don't be careful for nothing be careful for nothing but in everything you got a nothing and you got an everything in everything by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God and others you can't pray without praise you can't ask without Thanksgiving you can't even do it unless you're thinking in glory in God don't be anxious about anything but in everything by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God therefore if there's anything that you have a concern of instead of being anxious about it by prayer and supplication with your Thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God showing that we enter with Thanksgiving and praise prayer is the act of making a request or supplication to God praise is an act of expressing adoration and thanks to God we don't just pray we pray is when we pray that's what prayer ought to be it ought to have this function it's Dynamic praise and thanksgiving that when you begin your prayer you you begin with this adoration this call upon God Hallowed be thy name God you are the god that is above all I thank you for this and I acknowledge you for that and you just begin to thank them hey if you ever get under the anointing of prayer sometimes you start thanking them you'll be so busy thinking and praising you'll forget to ask and and say amen and find out he already granted it brother banham uses Mary a lot in this example in the sermon Abraham he said but what did Mary say she never questioned it she said behold the handmaid of the Lord be it unto me according to Thy word and what did she do she never waited till she was positive I don't know if he's talking about a test or what she never waited till she was positive she never waited till she felt or anything else that she was positive like I'll just wait till I can feel the baby kick I'll just wait till I know something's changed as long as God said so that was enough for her to have it she took God in his word and began testifying that she was going to have a baby before she had any evidence other than the word of God she was Abraham's seed just as soon as God said so and you read it in the Bible take him at his word and start thanking him for it there's nothing wrong with thanking him for it because it's a promise in his word when the Holy Ghost fell on the people at Pentecost they took God's word he never said you wait up there two days three days ten days he says you wait until and they were up there thanking him and praising him for his promise when the Holy Ghost came what were they doing they were thanking him and praising him not oh Lord help me oh Lord help me oh Jesus help me help me thanking them and praising them take him at his word thank him for it if you need healing you need Liberation from anything receive it believe it take his word thank him for it and call those things which not as though they were this is the attitude and disposition this is how in whatsoever state I'm in there with to be content it's not that I'm resigning to always be this way but I have a god who's promised to look after me and care for me and I will praise him and I will thank him and I will already thank him for the healing that is on its way Paul writes it this way in first Thessalonians 5 16 17 and 18 Rejoice Evermore how how should I Rejoice Evermore pray without ceasing in everything give thanks for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you what's the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning me that you would Rejoice ever more pray without ceasing and everything give things that you have a cycle of rejoicing praying and giving things I'm going to Rejoice pray give things Rejoice pray get things I ain't got time to be sad or anxious in that if that's all that's on my to-do list I'm going to wake up rejoicing and I have a need I'm going to be praying and once I prayed I'm going to be thinking I don't have room for worry I I don't have room I'm going to fill my heart up with faith where there's no place in my heart for any of this disconcerting stuff or this dark side of Hope why I'm rejoicing and I'm rejoicing and when I have a need I'll ask for it and when I'm done asking I'll give I'll start thinking and then once I'm done thank you I'm going to start rejoicing and I want to begin to cycle in my life of praise and thanksgiving and glory and happiness and joy [Music] this is the will of God for me brother Brandon believeth thou this he's talking about Mary again he says she started praising God before she even had any sign that it was going to be done she didn't know she never waited till she felt life she didn't wait till something was showing she just believed it there it is say why brother Richie prayed for me last night but I don't seem to be any better sorry brother Richie he says you'll never be like that take God at his word start thanking him for it praise him until it comes if you were prayed for last night and you don't feel any better then get your mind off of the feeling better and start praising he says thank him for it praise him for it oh that's the way God give us more Mary's just accept it remember the word of God will defeat Satan anywhere he said anywhere anytime any place therefore I've Got Confidence in the word that gives me enough reason to praise him and to thank him and to rejoice the doe says well what if you never get healed that doesn't change his word what if it hurts worse tomorrow that doesn't change his word doesn't change the greatness of God that doesn't change his glory it doesn't change don't you has he done good things for you has he not done a great thing for you do you have a reason to pray praise him some of you who may be sick and have chronic illnesses maybe you're facing very difficult trials maybe there's things you desperately want and God hasn't seemed to give it to you but has he been good to you has his word made promises that he's kept oh you've got enough reason to praise him you have enough reason to thank him you have enough reason to Rejoice Evermore if you have a need make your supplication with praise make your supplication with Thanksgiving and then when you've asked and you've given it submitted it to God and you submit his case to him don't hold back your praise until you get the answer let the praise go forth now [Applause] let it Pour forth from you praise him till it comes the Bible says in Psalms 30 verse 12 to the end that my glory may sing praise to thee and not be silent O Lord my God I will give thanks unto thee forever oh that it would not be silent to the end that my glory may sing praise to thee I'll give thanks unto thee forever oh that my glory what think about it when Paul said therefore I rather glory in my infirmities not that we're going to be worshiping and adoring or happy that we're sick but in our sicknesses we're happy in Psalm 34 1 I Will Bless The Lord at all times what times all times his praise shall continually be in my mouth it's a shame that the only time these words are in our mouths when we're singing but it ought to be at all times I Will Bless The Lord at all times his praise shall continually be in my mouth that means there's never a moment where praise isn't appropriate there's never a moment when blessing the Lord isn't appropriate why because it's due him at all times I Will Bless The Lord at all times his praise shall continually be in my mouth and whatsoever time I am afraid that is the time that I will not only trust in you but I will glory in you I will praise you I will worship you I will lift your name on high it says let everything the half-breath praise the Lord Praise ye the Lord Brother Aaron when should I praise take a breath you can breathe praise how often should I give him thanks are you breathing praise that everything that hath breath in other words let anything that's alive let anything that's breathing that anything that has a heartbeat they ought to be beating for him they ought to be breathing for him they'll be living for him let everything that has breath well I've got a headache dear God breath praise them well I've got a bum ankle do you got breath praise him doesn't say whoever has a healthy body Praise Him whoever's got breath even if I'm struggling to breathe oh God let it be with my last breath then I praise him let everything to have breath praise ye the Lord and the sermon be certain of God I thought of this recently would just ask what does a person do when they've turned over every stone they've asked God to show them if there's anything they need to make right if there's anybody they need to forgive they've done everything they can they've forgiven they've asked for forgiveness they've done everything they can then be certain of God when you turned over every stone you've gone down every road you could think of you tried to do everything then be certain of God he tells it says in the prayer line You'll find this happens so frequently that I just I used some statements that I'd used before because you start reading these and you realize okay I've got a thousand of these that are very similar this come sister I lay hands upon the woman and the child in the name of Jesus Christ me may they be healed come sister now this is what he just did he says come he lays hands on a prism that's it and he says don't let down right think about think about the attitude now how when you're really desperate you're pushing right you're pushing and a sister comes through to be prayed for and brother brown maybe she wanted discernment I don't know what the expectation might have been but as he prays for him you get this sense and now he says now there's like oh Lord him oh God please tell me oh God heal me like your brother man lays hands on him it's like just may they be healed the name of Jesus Christ they're like right now now they're quiet now their lips are sealed he says don't let down when you come by here start praising God when you're prayed for this isn't the time to stop well you did a lot of talking and your mouth was doing a lot of moving there's a lot of pouring out when you needed it but he's saying now that you've been prayed for let it Pour forth now for real I don't care if it takes 25 years if you're the children of Abraham then you've got the faith of Abraham and then you should have the praise of David you should have the glory rolling up within you to say I've got faith to believe I'm well I'm not going to let these lips fall silent why would you do it that's only testifying to a symbol of death I'm going to let these lips Praise Him he says don't let down in Psalm 42 11 why aren't thou cast down on my soul why are thou disquieted within me hope thou and God for I shall yet Praise Him who is the health of my countenance in my God that matters more the health of your countenance matters more than the health of your feet than the health of your head than the health of your heart the health of your stomach you name it the health of my countenance I will yet praise him who is the health of my account he's the reason why I'm happy he's the reason why I'm expecting he's the reason why I can live another day he's the reason why I get up in the morning he's the source of my joy not a pack of cigarettes or a bottle of pills Christ is the source of my joy Christ is the source of my ambition Christ is the source of my pleasure I will not glory in the things of man I will not find my rest and hope in those things but I will say Christ he alone is my hope and he alone is my helper I shall yet praise him oh so then why is your soul cast down why aren't this quiet enemy oh now in that moment that most things trust yet in the middle and praise him so much can be said about the negative testimony even going back to what Spurgeon had to say when he said you know nothing would nothing's going to matter more to another believer I know I'm putting it in my words than to hear you testify of how God healed you and even the sickness you felt what you went through the cures that were used and testify in the end I was made well he says none of that that'll do better than anything you could read out of a book to say hey yeah don't worry about this problem there's this remedy and this helps and this helps and this helps even if it may seem to be positive he's saying your positive testimony of what you went through means more to a believer would be more to the one that's sick than all the scientific evidence that you could provide them that's that's hopeful now if that's the upside of your testimony what's the downside that when we get Negative oh yeah I've been there you're just gonna have to have that have that cut off right out of the negative testimonies that we have sometime yeah my my kid was doing that you might as well just expect that they're going to go into the world the negative testimonies I'll praise him who's the health of my countenance and my God the sermon Be not Afraid and I'm going to challenge your faith right now to do something what do you think what do you think do you all believe it's the Holy Spirit how many Moses knows that's exactly the same sermon I preached tonight of Jesus Christ how many believes that inside out so he's he's calling back to what he preached and that demonstration of the presence God says raise your hands says all that will accept Jesus as their healer right now I don't care what's wrong with you how crippled you are nothing about it if you'll accept Jesus as your healer stand up to your feet and raise up your hands and start praising him for healing you and you can have your healing right now how often do we hear him say something along those lines that in that moment of crisis when it's come into a head when something's got to give he says Just Praise Him just begin to praise him just begin to glorify him just begin to start lifting him up and adore him the focus on the Christ glorify God in your body and in your spirit with your Gods if you're sick Paul is saying that this I say he's talking about the body and the body therefore being God's glorified God in your body and in your spirit which are Gods that's our number one duty that's what we ought to do is to serve him to fear Him and to keep his Commandments I will glorify God in my body in my spirit when he says my grace is sufficient for thee therefore my most gladly therefore glory in my infirmities then in my sickness I will praise him not just in my health but in my sickness I will praise him I can say hallelujah it's finished and the sermon what thinking of Christ brother braham's talking about an acorn and he says he says then you you set it out into the yard and just keeps growing but you can praise God just as soon as you get the acorn principal of an acorn right when you have an acorn if you plant it in the right kind of ground right you're talking about the principles of the seed that you know that that'll grow into a tree but let's not wait till we get the tree praise him as soon as you get the acorn because you got the tree already now when God said I am the Lord the healeth thee just start praising you got it you got it right then you say well I don't see any results but that don't take make any difference you got it anyhow see because the word of God is a seed is that right and we are sold with the incredible seed of God it can't perish it's incorruptible I don't know if you read it this way but I want to put it this way that if God has given you the seed of I am the Lord the hilleth thy disease water it with praise water it with testimony water with a positive attitude don't keep digging it up and trying to check if anything's different but you could take God at his word he says just start praising how can you praise God for healing when you're sick and you don't see any evidence of it because I've got the seed of it that says by his stripes I am healed I am the Lord to healeth all died of diseases I set my word it healed them I've got a seed that I can start watering with praise because I've got it right then therefore I could say that no matter what you're going through no matter what you're experiencing we could say as David said in Psalm 57 verses 7 to 11 my heart is fixed oh God my heart is fixed I will sing and give praise remember the circumstances under which David this is written of David he had fled from Saul he's hiding in the cave say between a rock and a hard place fearing for his life and in the middle of the trouble there's a request oh my soul is among lions and his requestion of God oh God I cry unto God most high God that that performeth all things for me there's prayer but not just prayer there's praise and his circumstance hasn't changed and this is this is what this I believe is so remarkable and why the psalmist wrote this is David when he ought to have been anxious when he ought to have been fearful when he could have been fretting David said my heart is fixed it's settled no this isn't Up For Debate no I my I don't my heart is not making a choice it's already fixed I'm not going to try to find out well how many people are after me or what's the percentages that this remedy is going to work and how many people have survived this and can I get in to see a specialist will my insurance cover it listen yeah we should have this attitude if my insurance covers it I won't pray if it doesn't then I'll get desperate you know it none of it matters my heart is fixed my heart is fixed oh God my heart is fixed I will sing and give praise it wasn't just oh God help me and this is fixed but it was my heart is fixed oh God my heart is fixed I will sing and give praise and then there's this outpouring of love to this faithful father here's this outpouring of adoration to God he boasts of his goodness he declares his majesty and worship he says I he says awake up my glory if you've been dormant if you've been lulled to sleep if you've been silent if I've let my lips kind of slow down and cease to praise you if I haven't let my countenance be to you whatever it is that has allowed my hands to fall slack in my voice to fall quiet he says wake up wake up my praise wake up my rejoicing wake up my hallelujahs blue devil you're gonna follow me follow me to your peril while I'm gonna wake up from this Slumber I'm going to wake up from this sleep and I'm going to Glory he says the wake up Sultry and harp I myself will awake early I will praise the O Lord among the people I will sing unto thee among the Nations for thy mercy is great into the heavens and thy truth into the clouds be thou exalted o God above the heavens let thy glory be above all the Earth I believe that as Believers we ought to have a praiseful disposition we ought to have a thankful disposition whatsoever stay you find yourself in you may not be sick today you may have had chronic illnesses your whole life but remember this wake up my glory wake up my praise I don't want to be down or I don't want to be sour I don't want to be downtrodden I want to be a believer I want to be a believer that rejoices that praise is that's positive I can stand Upon A promise when Christ is there hanging upon that cross he says it is finished and it was finished for me and that's where I stake my happiness that's where I stake my joy I find it in Christ in him alone I can believe we could all say hallelujah it is finished and there's so much power and praise that you can Praise Him until you are healed can we do that as a church we're going to have this disposition that matter no matter what happens no matter what comes our way I'm going to praise him that that's my disposition it's one of Praise oh well this is horrible yeah Praise Him that doesn't look good yeah Praise Him I shall bless the Lord at all times his praise shall continually be in my mouth I love it there's no footnotes there's no parenthetical phrase there's no and butts there's no exceptions there's no well this General blessed Lord at all times unless you find yourself in the following seven situations no his praise shall continually be a mouth unless you find yourself no continually let's Praise Him because he's your healer praise the Lord let's stand together today musicians if you come
