[0:00] God who at sunundry times and in diverse
[0:02] manner spake in time past unto the
[0:04] fathers by the prophets hath in these
[0:07] last days spoken to us by his son whom
[0:10] he hath appointed heir of all things by
[0:13] whom also he made the worlds who being
[0:16] the brightness of his glory and the
[0:18] express image of his person and
[0:20] upholding all things by the word of his
[0:22] power when he had by himself purged our
[0:24] sins sat down on the right hand of the
[0:26] majesty on high being made so much
[0:29] better than the angels, as he hath by
[0:31] inheritance obtained a more excellent
[0:33] name than they. For unto which the
[0:35] angels, for unto which of the angels
[0:37] said he at any time, thou art my son,
[0:39] this day have I begotten thee. And
[0:41] again, I will be to him a father, and he
[0:43] shall be to me a son. And again, when he
[0:45] bringeth in the first begotten into the
[0:47] world, he saith, and let all the angels
[0:49] of God worship him, and of the angels he
[0:52] saith, Who maketh his angels spirits,
[0:54] and his ministers a flame of fire? But
[0:56] under the Son he saith, Thy throne, oh
[0:58] God, is forever and ever. The scepter of
[1:00] righteousness is the scepter of thy
[1:02] kingdom. Thou hast loved righteousness
[1:04] and hated iniquity. Therefore God, even
[1:06] thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil
[1:08] of gladness above thy fellows. And thou,
[1:11] Lord, in the beginning, hast laid the
[1:13] foundations of the earth, and the
[1:14] heavens are the works of thine hands.
[1:16] They shall perish, but thou remainest,
[1:18] and they all shall wax old as doth a
[1:20] garment, and as a veester shalt thou
[1:22] fold them up, and they shall be changed.
[1:24] But thou art the same, and thy year
[1:26] shall not fail. But to which of the
[1:28] angels said, he at any time, sit on my
[1:30] right hand until I make thine enemies
[1:32] thy foottool. Are they not all
[1:34] ministering spirits sent forth to
[1:36] minister for them who shall be heirs of
[1:38] salvation? Amen. What a incredible
[1:41] poetic reading there. God bless you. You
[1:44] can be seated.
[1:47] such remarkable words about the son
[1:51] whom God had spoken in in the last days
[1:53] as it's mentioned here and then this
[1:55] position of God as the creator of all
[1:57] things and his greatness and so there's
[1:59] some impression that we can gain from
[2:01] reading that and my title is impressions
[2:04] of Christ and I have a lot that I'm I do
[2:07] want to cover I say a lot but it's not
[2:09] going to be lengthy I don't believe but
[2:11] I wanted to read this statement uh by
[2:13] Reverend George Mat he's one of my
[2:16] favorite uh writers and he wrote a book
[2:19] called Studies of the Portrait of
[2:21] Christ. He did it in a couple volumes
[2:23] and uh this is in one of the first ones.
[2:26] This has been in I don't know if the
[2:28] brothers and the slides had noticed this
[2:30] but I think I've had this in my notes
[2:32] for last several services but he writes
[2:34] in the gallery of human souls there's
[2:37] one preeminent figure. It has been the
[2:40] study of all artist, of all thinkers.
[2:43] From the most opposite sides of the
[2:44] building, men have seen it. So now he's
[2:46] looking at it as a gallery, an art
[2:48] gallery, some piece that's hanging. And
[2:51] he says that these men have approached
[2:53] this portrait, this this painting of
[2:55] this human soul. They've approached it
[2:58] from opposite sides of the building and
[3:00] men have seen it, approached it,
[3:01] centered around it. It's been studied by
[3:04] the lover of beauty. It's been lauded by
[3:06] the lover of the commonplace. It has
[3:08] been examined in the interest of
[3:09] philosophy. It has been scrutinized in
[3:12] the interest of childlike simplicity. It
[3:14] has been admired as the embodiment of a
[3:16] creed. It has been eulogized as the
[3:18] negation of all creeds. It has drawn the
[3:20] eyes of the mystic who wants to soar
[3:22] above the world. It has attracted the
[3:24] gaze of the practical who find the world
[3:25] a home. Wise men have sought it in the
[3:28] pursuit of science. Shepherds have
[3:30] sought it in the guiding of their
[3:31] flocks. Herod has sought it in the
[3:33] policy of self-interest. every think of
[3:36] all those different ways that he's been
[3:38] approached and people have looked at
[3:40] this and responded to. He says every
[3:42] avenue of the mind has been at some time
[3:45] a road to the portrait of Jesus. Every
[3:48] mind at some point has been at on this
[3:52] road to the portrait this picture of
[3:54] Jesus. And he's using this stage of well
[3:58] there's this picture that's been painted
[3:59] in this gallery of human souls. There's
[4:01] one preeminent figure, the perfect man,
[4:03] Jesus Christ, that portrait of humanity
[4:06] and divinity. And everyone at some point
[4:09] has been on a road to that picture and
[4:10] looked at it from different vantage
[4:12] points and taken from it childlike
[4:14] simplicity, have taken philosophy or
[4:17] used it to embody creeds or to negate
[4:19] creeds. They've done it in the pursuit
[4:20] of science or in the guiding of flocks
[4:23] or maybe for self-interest. There's been
[4:24] all sorts of ways that it's impacted.
[4:27] But these are and these are the
[4:28] impressions. This is what I want to
[4:30] start with thinking how has it impressed
[4:31] you? And today we are we're taking uh a
[4:37] we're taking this service to conclude uh
[4:39] the series that we've been on this year
[4:41] using the subject of art and these
[4:43] different concepts. We began with the
[4:45] sermon on the art of God at the very
[4:46] beginning of the year. Uh then dealt
[4:48] with created to create and how life
[4:50] imitates art and art for God's sake and
[4:53] the original inspiration. And in that we
[4:56] were seeing how that god is the artist
[4:57] or the creative. We read it here in
[4:59] Hebrews. He's the one that created all
[5:01] things and he brought these things
[5:03] forth. And so he being the creator, you
[5:06] are the created. You're the one that he
[5:08] has created. And we could even say in a
[5:11] natural sense, all life has come from
[5:13] God. That's why uh the woman could say
[5:16] I've gotten a son from the Lord because
[5:18] all life comes from God. And so God is
[5:22] the creator but and you are the creator.
[5:24] But in a spiritual sense, it's the same.
[5:26] you being new creatures and new
[5:27] creations in Christ Jesus. And so you
[5:30] have come forth for such a time as this.
[5:33] So the setting and the context that
[5:34] you're born into is this modern world or
[5:37] this present age. And we know that God's
[5:40] ways and his works and the things that
[5:41] he does, they express his nature. They
[5:44] indicate his character. We think of
[5:46] somebody's uh way that they do
[5:48] something. There's this these
[5:49] distinctive attributes or traits and you
[5:51] say, "Well, those are I like to say
[5:53] sometimes those are the fingerprints of
[5:54] God." Sometimes we think when God would
[5:57] when God would do something uh it would
[5:59] be so uh so obvious that it's God. But
[6:02] sometimes God does things in a way you
[6:04] have to be discerning and recognize his
[6:06] fingerprints. And so we know that
[6:08] actions and words and even the way that
[6:10] we present ourselves is an expression of
[6:12] identity. The same with God. And we know
[6:16] that God will identify his character or
[6:19] he's identified by his character in
[6:21] every age. So as time has unfolded in
[6:24] the Old Testament, we see God identifies
[6:26] himself through uh in in the New
[6:28] Testament, even through the church ages,
[6:30] God's had a way that he expresses
[6:32] himself. So well, how are we going to
[6:33] know God? You know him by his character.
[6:35] Well, how do you know his character? You
[6:36] know him by his character through the
[6:37] word.
[6:38] &gt;&gt; And so his character will be the same
[6:40] today, which is the present world, as it
[6:42] was yesterday, even in the ancient
[6:44] world. So we look at we've think of all
[6:47] Christians in days gone by and you can
[6:49] see paintings and read stories and the f
[6:53] fox's book of martyrs as my former
[6:55] pastor used fox's book of mortars and he
[6:58] thought were they brick layers what's
[6:59] happening there but in the fox's book of
[7:02] martyrs that there was a hest
[7:04] testimonies and this is this is what it
[7:07] looked like and this is what they did
[7:08] well uh we certainly don't want to live
[7:10] in that day uh so that we testify as
[7:13] being Christians by being crucified or
[7:16] burned at the stake. But there is an
[7:18] expression today of the character that
[7:20] those Christians had.
[7:22] &gt;&gt; And so Jesus Christ is unfolding himself
[7:24] today. And that first expression of
[7:27] Christ or in Christ, this intent, this
[7:30] character uh is to be reflected or even
[7:33] restored in this day as Christ has been
[7:35] kicked out of the church and these
[7:36] truths lost. That's when we, it's those
[7:39] first eight services that I'm kind of
[7:40] hearkening back to because they kind of
[7:42] formed the foundation for where we went
[7:43] on holiness and sacred symmetry and some
[7:46] of those things. But we looked at God
[7:47] hidden in profanity.
[7:49] And uh there was a certain theology
[7:52] within churches that art uh if it
[7:54] conveyed [clears throat] God, it had to
[7:55] be grand. It had to be ornate. It had to
[7:58] speak of something supernatural and
[7:59] beyond ourselves because truly God is
[8:02] not human and God is not earthly and God
[8:04] is not um bound to human elements. There
[8:07] was a way you wanted to convey the
[8:09] divine by more than just a halo effect
[8:10] but by gold and embellished images but
[8:13] and there was this ban even within the
[8:16] Catholic Church. You couldn't paint
[8:17] things that they called profane. And now
[8:20] profane today we think profanity. We
[8:22] think four-letter words and things we
[8:23] shouldn't say, but it just simply meant
[8:25] common, normal. So, we looked at God
[8:28] hidden in profanity, hidden in flesh.
[8:30] God manifest himself in flesh or in this
[8:33] human beings lives. And that's where
[8:35] with the original uh reality in in that
[8:38] original context that God in the present
[8:40] context how that this what Christ was
[8:43] today and we led to 21st century Christ
[8:46] which is what you are. You are Christ
[8:48] today. God making another masterpiece to
[8:52] do what? Reflect his beauty and to
[8:54] perform the same creative acts. You're
[8:57] not going to create worlds as they were
[8:59] done in the beginning. You may not do
[9:01] the very same things of multiplying
[9:02] bread, but there is a performative uh
[9:05] the performance of the Holy Ghost in
[9:08] you. Your life will reflect the beauty
[9:09] of the Lord. Your life will be the light
[9:11] that draws others to Christ. This is how
[9:14] a church should operate is the members
[9:17] are the light. Uh we do have a desire to
[9:20] do meetings and to do outreach and and
[9:22] do things in a way that we could get the
[9:24] gospel out to those that need it. We
[9:26] support missions, but the most effective
[9:28] witnessing tool that a church has is not
[9:30] programs and tracks, but it's you.
[9:33] &gt;&gt; That's a that's the way a church should
[9:35] grow is by the lives and the light of
[9:37] those who are out there amongst the
[9:39] people every day expressing the
[9:41] character of Christ.
[9:44] And so it's not uh not just a discipline
[9:47] to what the external appearance should
[9:49] be or those optics but it's displaying
[9:51] his character. So there is a display but
[9:54] it's not looking at well what did he
[9:56] look like then and what does what should
[9:58] a Christian look like and let's try to
[10:00] look like a Christian. It's what is a
[10:02] Christian on the inside and let's be
[10:04] that.
[10:06] &gt;&gt; It's the word becoming a reality in just
[10:09] ordinary everyday life.
[10:12] I know that we would like to perhaps
[10:14] become Christians that we could just
[10:16] walk into hospitals and get everyone out
[10:18] of their beds and heal everyone and walk
[10:20] on water and create all the Christmas
[10:22] gifts we want and we'd want to be that
[10:25] kind of Christian. But it's God manifest
[10:28] himself in just the ordinary, the common
[10:29] place. And so the challenge today, this
[10:32] is the way that it struck me and and
[10:34] even have it written down here. Godly
[10:37] enough to be separate but human enough
[10:39] to be relatable. Amen.
[10:42] &gt;&gt; Godly enough to to be identified as a
[10:44] Christian. Godly enough to be separate
[10:46] from those things of the world, but
[10:48] human enough to be known for so human
[10:50] enough to be related. Someone could
[10:52] relate to this is God. This is this is a
[10:55] portrait of divinity, but yet this is a
[10:57] person. This is a human being. So
[10:59] there's a a relevance, something
[11:01] relatable to that.
[11:03] and that and I wanted to share that so
[11:05] that you could understand this is what
[11:06] we're trying to not so much finish but
[11:09] just conclude this thought this is my
[11:11] been my thesis from the very beginning
[11:13] and I just felt like this is a perfect
[11:14] opportunity just to kind of end this
[11:16] series on uh using this subject of art
[11:19] throughout the year got a lot of good
[11:21] feedback on it appreciate those who've
[11:22] enjoyed it those who have not provided
[11:24] the negative feedback I appreciate the
[11:26] fact that you didn't but I am moving on
[11:29] haven't gotten any negative feedback and
[11:30] we're moving on so now you waited long
[11:32] enough and we'll move on. But I have uh
[11:35] I wanted to mention this and use this as
[11:38] a starting point here. But what would
[11:41] Jesus look like is the question if he
[11:43] was born just 30 years ago.
[11:46] [clears throat] You say now that you
[11:47] begin to think about can't remember what
[11:48] it was. I read the other day, but um the
[11:52] you know now we're in 2026 almost and
[11:55] you think about that like everyone says
[11:57] 20 years ago that was 1980, right? I
[11:59] mean that's what we mean. we think 1980,
[12:01] but no, that that's 45 years ago, 46
[12:03] years ago. And so, we've moved on to
[12:06] where someone just born 30 years ago.
[12:07] They're born in the 1990s. What would
[12:10] they look like today? This present day
[12:12] reality of a Messiah if he was born
[12:14] maybe not in a manger, but born maybe in
[12:17] a a different way uh in a in a way
[12:20] that's very common or maybe even less
[12:23] common, a unique circumstances. What
[12:24] would he look like? And this is an image
[12:28] of what Jesus may have looked like 2,000
[12:30] years ago. You say, "Well, that's uh who
[12:32] does that look like?" You might say,
[12:33] "Who does who does this person look
[12:35] like?" But it's a model of a Galilean
[12:37] man uh from the time of Jesus
[12:40] um by a forensic anthropologist based on
[12:43] an actual skull that was found in the
[12:45] region. So, they're using different data
[12:47] points and ways to project what Jesus
[12:50] may have looked like uh back in 2,000
[12:54] years ago in Galilee or Judea.
[12:58] And this is
[13:00] uh we could say, well, if that's what he
[13:02] looked like then, we say, well, is that
[13:03] what we need to do? Well, that that
[13:05] wouldn't even necessarily be accurate.
[13:06] So, what I did is I took some time and I
[13:09] used AI.
[13:12] This is the only part of AI that I used
[13:14] for my sermon is I generated images of
[13:18] what and I it's kind of painstaking to
[13:20] do this in a particular way of what a
[13:21] modern Jewish man may look like today in
[13:25] today's times and and uh if we were to
[13:30] see a 30 to 33y old uh Jewish male today
[13:34] how would he appear and I I want you I'm
[13:38] saying this because if you went back
[13:39] 2,000 years ago and you saw Jesus,
[13:42] there's not going to be a an apparent
[13:44] halo over his head.
[13:46] &gt;&gt; He's like, "Yeah, that's the son of
[13:47] God." That's what we think the halo came
[13:50] from. You know, this would be the son of
[13:52] Joseph. And this is way people we know
[13:53] your brothers. We know your sister. We
[13:55] know your parents. He would have looked
[13:56] like just another 30-some year old man
[13:58] at that time. Here's another uh
[14:00] characterization of what maybe a Jewish
[14:02] male would look like. And they they're
[14:06] just normallooking people.
[14:09] &gt;&gt; Nothing outstanding about them. even to
[14:10] the clothes that they wear. There's
[14:12] nothing that might uh stand out and say,
[14:15] "Oh, whoa, hold on. Is this the
[14:16] modern-day Messiah?
[14:19] Is that who AI just generated Jesus? Uh
[14:22] uh, and this is what he would look
[14:23] like?" Well, he very possibly could have
[14:25] looked just like that. There was a a
[14:28] Dutch artist some time ago. I don't know
[14:30] if any of you are familiar with this
[14:32] picture, but he was an artist. and he
[14:33] created an image of what Jesus he
[14:36] believes Jesus would have looked like uh
[14:38] 2,000 years ago based upon artist
[14:41] renditions all sorts of uh information
[14:44] and he used some very uh robust tools to
[14:47] try to create a composite of what he
[14:50] thinks Jesus may have looked like. And I
[14:52] see that and I see Hoffman's head of
[14:53] Christ and and different things that
[14:55] might stand out to me, descriptions that
[14:57] maybe you had put a lot of confidence
[14:59] in. the way brother Brandham described
[15:00] how he would look to me. I say, "Wow,
[15:02] uh, that's pretty accurate of maybe how
[15:04] he would look." But then again, that's
[15:07] just a head shot. So, once again, I used
[15:10] AI and I I thought this was kind of
[15:11] funny. I said, "Well, let's put this
[15:13] face in a modern context." And he was
[15:15] always carrying a cup of coffee.
[15:19] I mean, where does this leave the
[15:21] Mormons?
[15:22] And so he's uh so here he's he's just
[15:28] kind of hanging out, you know, looks
[15:29] kind of good here. Here again, cup of
[15:32] coffee.
[15:34] I guess this could be a a matcha.
[15:39] But this is what this face would have
[15:40] looked like in these kind of modern day
[15:42] settings.
[15:44] This is how maybe he would have looked
[15:46] at work.
[15:48] Just a carpenter using modern tools.
[15:52] A and I share this because the question
[15:54] is what would look Jesus look like today
[15:57] and the challenge is yeah I'm I think we
[16:00] should start to realize there's so much
[16:02] more that has to do with the heart of
[16:04] things
[16:06] &gt;&gt; and the way that we live the way that we
[16:08] act the way that we talk the way that we
[16:09] respond in more than just put it on I
[16:12] like to use the phrase the cosplay of a
[16:14] Christian
[16:14] &gt;&gt; right
[16:15] &gt;&gt; where we have the trappings
[16:17] &gt;&gt; you know we're going to get a cross
[16:18] tattoo or we're going to have a what
[16:20] would Jes Jesus do bumper stick or or
[16:22] fly a Trump flag. You know, all the
[16:24] things we do to indicate we're real
[16:25] Christians. And we say those things in
[16:28] themselves
[16:30] are are just elements that present uh
[16:34] ideas.
[16:35] &gt;&gt; Right.
[16:35] &gt;&gt; Right.
[16:36] &gt;&gt; And and that and they're symbols, but is
[16:38] that really what Jesus is? Is that does
[16:40] that distill down to what Christ is? So
[16:43] I come back to this thought of
[16:45] impressions of Christ.
[16:49] An impression is a mark produced by
[16:51] pressure.
[16:52] You talk about a print or a stamp,
[16:54] there's some act of applying pressure.
[16:57] It's the act or process of making a mark
[16:59] upon a surface by pressing. So that's
[17:01] what an impression is. And we could use
[17:03] the verb, you could use the noun, but
[17:04] this impression is that the act of
[17:07] making a mark by pressing. A copy made
[17:10] by pressure. You do this with type or an
[17:12] engraving where you apply pressure and
[17:14] you engrave the surface of something. So
[17:16] it in doing so an impression it makes a
[17:18] permanent image and so it's a even used
[17:21] in the sense of a characteristic mark
[17:23] something that distinguishes something
[17:25] like a potter will take a a stamp and
[17:27] they put their initial in that or they
[17:29] put their symbol in that and by doing so
[17:31] it's this distinguishing identification
[17:33] it's an impression but impression also
[17:36] speaks of something that has a strong
[17:39] effect on the mind or heart. If it if
[17:42] you've been impressed, if there's an
[17:43] impression, it means to stamp deeply in
[17:46] the mind. So an impression is something
[17:49] that uh if we can say an image uh an
[17:53] image or a likeness that's produced in
[17:56] the mind or the emotions by something a
[17:59] pressing it literally means a pressing
[18:01] on the mind. So that the mind we say
[18:04] well you look at your your brain matter
[18:05] and it's not that if you're thinking
[18:07] about that there's a shape of a burrito
[18:09] stamped into your head but rather
[18:11] there's something influencing shaping a
[18:15] and giving this uh influence to your
[18:17] mind or your thoughts and some of you
[18:19] may have already in your in your
[18:21] thoughts as we use this phrase
[18:23] impressions.
[18:25] There was a 19th century art movement
[18:27] called impressionism.
[18:29] There's different impressionist painters
[18:32] uh that were identified with this. Clode
[18:34] Monet, one of the considered the father
[18:37] of impressionism. It began in Paris. It
[18:39] influenced a lot of artists that you
[18:41] know of that were called
[18:42] postimpressionist but yet greatly
[18:44] influenced or impressed by the
[18:46] impressionist.
[18:48] And they were focused on accurately
[18:51] depicting this kind of a visual
[18:53] impression of a moment, especially in
[18:56] terms of how light works and its
[18:58] shifting effect or how color changes at
[19:00] different stages. And they valued the
[19:04] expression of movement, especially in
[19:06] terms of uh you know the especially just
[19:10] how that movement is a very valuable
[19:12] element of human perception and
[19:14] experience. When you see something, our
[19:16] minds kind of have this interplay where
[19:18] it's like we ex we look for something to
[19:20] be in motion or there's certain ways you
[19:23] can indicate movement by how you express
[19:25] things. And this is vastly different
[19:27] from other periods to where you saw a
[19:29] lot of art that was these still lives
[19:31] and and they were very focused on
[19:33] somewhat of a realism and just
[19:35] expressing things the way that they
[19:36] would have been in color and and scene
[19:40] port. Think of how portraits are done. A
[19:42] a brother shared with me a portrait of
[19:44] somebody who in their life never had a
[19:46] portrait uh painted of them. So was left
[19:49] to his enemies his death to paint his
[19:51] portrait. And so now this brother had
[19:53] and it's was very unflattering. So now
[19:55] this brother has a new nickname. It's
[19:57] that Robert Skooler or whatever the
[19:59] guy's name was. And he says, "I sure
[20:01] want to keep in good uh in good with my
[20:04] friends so if they ever paint a portrait
[20:06] of me after I'm gone, it doesn't look
[20:08] like this." But there's a way that
[20:10] portraits were done and what did they
[20:11] do? They expressed that you would look
[20:13] at them and this may not be how they
[20:15] look every day. This is how they looked
[20:16] when they rolled out of bed. This is
[20:18] done to convey uh power, prestige.
[20:21] There's a lot of different elements that
[20:22] were used. But now impressionists came
[20:24] along and initially when I began you the
[20:27] series I I began to think well the
[20:30] impressionists were just using their
[20:32] interpretation of what they saw. And so
[20:35] I maybe was a little bit uh reluctant to
[20:38] lean into this. But as the Lord dealt
[20:40] with my heart, I began to realize what
[20:42] what impressionism expressed was
[20:44] something very different than well, I'm
[20:46] going to look at a sunset and interpret
[20:47] it the way I see it. But they they were
[20:50] meaning something else even by the
[20:52] phrase impressionism.
[20:54] And this picture here, this is one of
[20:56] the most famous
[20:58] uh impressionist paintings. I know all
[21:00] you artists immediately recognize this
[21:01] as
[21:07] impression sunrise by Clo Man Monday.
[21:10] And you look at this and you I think you
[21:13] can figure out what this is. Can some of
[21:14] you who can see it closely? It's this
[21:16] it's a it's a sunrise.
[21:18] It it these are bolts on the water and
[21:21] you say, "Well, that's this isn't very
[21:22] good detail,
[21:24] but it conveys
[21:26] what that sunrise might look over the
[21:28] water. How you might feel when you look
[21:30] at it. the the this kind of this impact.
[21:32] It impresses something on you. It's the
[21:34] effect produced upon the mind as the
[21:37] artist looked at it. It had some
[21:38] impression on them. There was a feeling
[21:41] to it. They're they're the viewer.
[21:43] They're the viewer of nature. So, but
[21:45] how is that nature impressed them?
[21:47] &gt;&gt; Right?
[21:47] &gt;&gt; And so, one of the things that
[21:49] identified impressionism were these
[21:51] visible brush strokes.
[21:53] &gt;&gt; You could see it. Whereas before, great
[21:55] detail was given to make it look and
[21:57] appear what we would call a photo today.
[21:59] said, "Well, that's a photo, not a
[22:00] painting." They went to great lengths to
[22:02] where you didn't see the brush strokes.
[22:03] The paint wasn't going to be added on
[22:05] very thickly. So, these visible brush
[22:07] strokes were characteristic of
[22:09] impressionism because it represented, as
[22:11] one writer put it, the direct impact of
[22:14] surface markers on spiritual perception
[22:16] or experiential cognition.
[22:19] &gt;&gt; The actual brush strokes were indicating
[22:22] that there's some impact, there's
[22:24] something deeper that's happening when
[22:26] we view a sunrise.
[22:28] We could paint it in a very sterile way
[22:30] and say, "Wow, that's a be that's a
[22:31] painting. Wow, that's amazing." And you
[22:33] begin to think that artist is absolutely
[22:35] gifted, talented, that's beautiful. That
[22:37] conveys a lot of what the it actually
[22:39] would have looked like, but when you
[22:40] look at it, you don't feel there.
[22:43] There's nothing there's no deeper
[22:44] impact. So this the impressionism spoke
[22:48] to this idea that there was something
[22:50] that could impact you. there's some
[22:53] effect of that nature, some impression,
[22:56] not just the visual, the act of the
[22:59] optics working to create a visual image,
[23:01] but rather something that impacts you
[23:04] deeper.
[23:04] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[23:05] &gt;&gt; And if I could say it this way, as I've
[23:08] alluded to before, good art tells a
[23:10] story,
[23:11] &gt;&gt; right?
[23:12] &gt;&gt; And all the storytellers said, "Amen."
[23:14] Or, "Yeah, I like that." There you can
[23:15] say it. Or how many years have I been
[23:18] waiting to hear that? No, I'm just
[23:19] kidding.
[23:21] It conveys meaning,
[23:23] &gt;&gt; right?
[23:24] &gt;&gt; And that's what was intended. Even in
[23:25] the realism, in the portraits, you say,
[23:26] "Well, why are they carrying this chain?
[23:28] It meant something. Why is this in the
[23:30] background?" Good art, even if it's not
[23:32] impressionism, has meaning to it. It
[23:35] It's supposed to provoke some sort of
[23:36] thought. And so, it's more than just
[23:39] accurately depicting a scene to where,
[23:41] oh, I want to be very, very faithful to
[23:43] be sure I get the green right. But are
[23:45] you going to be able to paint that in
[23:46] such a way to where you recognize the
[23:48] wind is blowing or the sun is rising or
[23:51] the time or the season or or what a
[23:53] person may be doing or are they pensive?
[23:55] Are they walking? Are they on the
[23:56] horizon? There's a way that the story
[23:58] has to be told to convey more than just
[24:02] oh that's a that's a brook that's a
[24:04] tree.
[24:06] In John chapter 1:es
[24:09] 1 to18 as we read through this I would
[24:11] like for you just to gain an impression
[24:14] going to read this in a way that we are
[24:16] relying upon John to begin to tell us a
[24:19] story of a God who was in the beginning
[24:22] who was then manifested in flesh and so
[24:24] as we read it there's something that we
[24:26] could use this as the literary
[24:27] impressionism that it's being written to
[24:29] us in a way that this is the mind of God
[24:31] as he pinned it upon paper and I want to
[24:34] strike me I I I don't want to just be
[24:36] able to say, well, God was the first and
[24:38] then he had a son and kind of get a
[24:40] chronology
[24:42] and be accurate historically. I want
[24:44] there to be something more that impacts
[24:46] me.
[24:47] &gt;&gt; In the beginning was the word and the
[24:49] word was with God and the word was God.
[24:54] &gt;&gt; So God is the word. The word is God. The
[24:56] same was in the beginning with God. All
[24:59] things were made by him and without him
[25:01] was not anything made that was made. In
[25:03] the beginning God created. The word was
[25:05] a very was creative. That was the part
[25:07] of the inspiration of this entire
[25:08] series. Well, where do you get this
[25:09] biblical concept of uh art? In the
[25:12] beginning, God created. All things were
[25:13] made by him. Without him was not
[25:15] anything made that was made. In him was
[25:17] life and the life was the light of men.
[25:20] And the light shineth in darkness and
[25:22] the darkness comprehended it not. Then
[25:25] there's this transition to this
[25:27] introductory
[25:28] ministry. This Eli spirit of Elijah.
[25:31] There was a man sent from God whose name
[25:32] was John. The same came for witness to
[25:35] bear witness of the light that all men
[25:37] through him might believe. He was not
[25:40] that light. God's forerunners, God's
[25:42] messengers are not the light. They are
[25:44] the ones who point to behold the lamb of
[25:46] God who takes away the sins of the
[25:47] world. He was not that light but was
[25:49] sent to bear witness of that light. That
[25:51] was the true light which lightth every
[25:53] man that cometh into the world. Now we
[25:56] begin to see that this has gone from God
[25:58] who in the beginning created who was the
[26:00] word to where now there's this
[26:02] introductory ministry of Elijah John the
[26:05] Baptist who introduces the light. It
[26:07] says he was in the world and the world
[26:09] was made by him and the world knew him
[26:10] not. He came unto his own and his own
[26:13] received him not. This is uh telling us
[26:17] very real things about this ministry and
[26:19] his days of his flesh. But as many as
[26:21] received him, there's something that's
[26:23] been received now and welcomed. There's
[26:25] others who don't receive him. God and
[26:27] his son is in the world. The word was
[26:28] made by him. Have I been so long with
[26:30] me? You don't know who I am. When you've
[26:32] seen me, you've seen the father. And he
[26:34] came to the Jews. He came to them there
[26:36] in Palestine. And they DON'T RECEIVE
[26:38] HIM. BUT SOME DO. And as many as did
[26:41] receive him and welcome him. to them
[26:43] gave he power to become the sons of God
[26:47] to manifest
[26:48] to to express divinity even to them that
[26:52] believe on his name which were born.
[26:55] This is a new birth. This is born again
[26:56] from above. Not of blood nor the will of
[26:58] the flesh nor of the will of man but of
[27:01] God.
[27:03] &gt;&gt; As many as received him were born of
[27:06] God.
[27:07] &gt;&gt; New beginnings, new creations.
[27:10] So then he says, "And the word was made
[27:11] flesh and dwelt among us. In the
[27:13] beginning was the word and the word was
[27:14] with God. And the word was God." And
[27:16] then we could say, "And the word was
[27:17] made flesh." This is what John
[27:20] introduced. This is what was to follow
[27:22] Elijah's ministry. The word made flesh.
[27:25] The word was made flesh and dwelt among
[27:26] us. This is what God does when the word
[27:28] is made flesh. It dwells among us.
[27:31] Wouldn't it be great that the moment
[27:32] you're born again, you're gone.
[27:35] &gt;&gt; Boom. You're out of here. Resurrection.
[27:38] you're you you've raptured and your body
[27:41] just drops or changes, however you want,
[27:43] but but you cease to exist here. But no,
[27:45] the word is made flesh. You're born
[27:46] again from above and then you dwell. It
[27:49] says, "And we beheld his glory." And I'm
[27:51] kind of maybe looking pointing to this
[27:53] end of us and we beheld his glory. The
[27:55] glory is that only begotten of the
[27:57] father full of grace and truth.
[27:58] Therefore, I believe that if you are to
[28:00] be born again, you're a holder of glory
[28:03] &gt;&gt; so that others can behold that glory.
[28:08] John bare witness of him and cried,
[28:10] "This is he of whom I spake. He that
[28:12] cometh after me is preferred before me,
[28:13] for he was before me." And it says, "And
[28:16] of his fullness," now John the writing
[28:18] this, "and of his fullness have we all
[28:19] received and grace for grace."
[28:23] Such beautiful words.
[28:26] He was in the world and the world knew
[28:27] him not.
[28:29] But there was those that received him
[28:32] and they're born of God. They received
[28:33] the word made flesh who dwelt among
[28:36] them. And we've received him and of this
[28:38] fully we've received him fully uh what
[28:40] he was and it's grace for grace for the
[28:42] law was given by Moses but grace and
[28:45] truth came by Jesus Christ.
[28:48] &gt;&gt; You want grace comes by Jesus Christ.
[28:50] You want truth that comes by Jesus
[28:51] Christ. Outside of those there are none.
[28:54] &gt;&gt; There's no grace and no truth. You can
[28:56] have partial truths and partial grace.
[28:57] We can have grace in a human sense but
[28:59] grace and truth come by Jesus Christ.
[29:02] Mercy and truth are met together in him.
[29:04] Amen.
[29:05] &gt;&gt; And then verse 18, no man hath seen God
[29:07] at any time.
[29:09] This is when Moses saw the backside, he
[29:12] didn't see God. He saw God in a form
[29:14] that declared his presence. He said,
[29:17] "You cannot see me face to face and
[29:19] live."
[29:21] But then Jesus says, "When you seen me,
[29:23] you've seen the father." So it says, "No
[29:24] man has seen God at any time. Cannot."
[29:26] There's even this sense that God who
[29:28] fills all time and space cannot be
[29:29] glimpsed or seen in the sense that well
[29:32] I've seen him but he says the only
[29:34] begotten son this is now Jesus Christ
[29:37] the word made flesh which is in the
[29:40] bosom of the father he hath declared him
[29:44] &gt;&gt; we say in the bosom of the father do I
[29:46] I'm going to present it this way John's
[29:49] I we shouldn't limit what he's saying to
[29:51] the fact oh now he's returned back to
[29:53] the father and there he is resting in
[29:55] the bosom of the father but rather when
[29:56] he says he is in the bosom of the
[29:58] father. Just think of this is at the
[30:00] heart of God
[30:02] &gt;&gt; who is the very heartbeat of God, the
[30:04] very nature of God, the very that if
[30:06] you've seen me, you've seen the father.
[30:08] In other words, when you when you say,
[30:09] "Well, you just don't know my heart."
[30:11] Has anybody ever had to say that to
[30:13] somebody? I can't believe you would do
[30:15] that. Well, you just don't know my
[30:16] heart. If you knew my heart, you would
[30:18] completely justify what I just did. But
[30:20] there's a sense where you say, "You
[30:21] don't know me. you if you and if you
[30:23] know someone's heart maybe if it seems a
[30:25] little bit a little bit misguided or
[30:26] doesn't work out you say well I know
[30:28] their heart in other words I know their
[30:29] person I know their intent I know their
[30:30] motive I know what they're trying to
[30:32] achieve so he says which is in the bosom
[30:34] of the father this is the heart of God
[30:36] says he hath declared him
[30:41] &gt;&gt; and to say he declared him it doesn't
[30:43] mean he was sitting there going dad
[30:45] he's my dad
[30:48] HE WASN'T JUST SAYING FATHER FATHER GOD
[30:50] he was declaring him which means to draw
[30:53] out
[30:54] &gt;&gt; as in a narrative
[30:57] &gt;&gt; that Jesus was declaring the father not
[31:00] that HE WOULD SAY I COME FROM GOD AND I
[31:02] GO BACK TO GOD AND GOD IS MY FATHER AND
[31:03] said there's the declaration it wasn't a
[31:05] declaration to where something was just
[31:07] pinned and distilled to a creed or a
[31:10] mantra but it was an unfolding
[31:14] &gt;&gt; Jesus wasn't implying have I been so
[31:16] long with you that when you that you
[31:18] don't know who I am but he's actually
[31:21] alluding to the fact that I've been with
[31:23] you so long that there has been this
[31:25] continual unfolding.
[31:27] So when you've seen me, you've seen the
[31:29] father. Now we could say in one sense if
[31:32] your eyes gazed upon him, you saw the
[31:34] Messiah. You saw the son of God. You saw
[31:36] him in flesh. But you wouldn't have
[31:38] known him.
[31:39] &gt;&gt; So when he says he's declared the
[31:41] father, then there's something unfolding
[31:43] in the life of Jesus Christ.
[31:46] &gt;&gt; That's why I believe the Bible is as
[31:48] long as it is. It's not just a little
[31:50] pocket book and it says in the beginning
[31:52] God created the world and the world was
[31:54] very sinful and it needed a sacrifice
[31:55] for sin and so God sent his son. He died
[31:57] on the cross and then God rose again and
[31:59] now you must receive him as your savior.
[32:00] Wouldn't that just be really succinct?
[32:03] And I think that's how some people live
[32:04] their Christianity. It's just the
[32:05] three-page Bible. But it's there's so
[32:08] much more to it because God just doesn't
[32:10] simply want to be God. He wants to be
[32:12] known. He wants to be understood. He
[32:14] wants to be apprehended.
[32:16] Wants to have fellowship and communion.
[32:17] And so he unfolded Jesus Christ unfolds
[32:21] the heart of God.
[32:23] &gt;&gt; To declare is to draw out in a narrative
[32:25] this unfolding.
[32:27] That's that's a storytelling
[32:30] that that's painting a picture
[32:33] in the sermon images of Christ. Brother
[32:35] Bram says for the word Christian means
[32:36] Christlike and to reflect him. He's
[32:38] using this example of a um
[32:43] uh one that when you take gold and you
[32:45] beat out all the dross and using an
[32:47] example how that one works with metals
[32:49] is you want to get it polished to the
[32:50] sense that you could see a reflection in
[32:52] it
[32:53] &gt;&gt; where it's not dull. It's not matte but
[32:54] it gets that place where it's pure. You
[32:56] know you've worked out all the
[32:57] impurities.
[32:59] And so to be Christlike is to be a
[33:00] Christian. It means to reflect him. Now
[33:03] that doesn't mean we have to grow a long
[33:05] beard. Thank God I can't do it
[33:10] as the artist pictures him having. And
[33:13] neither does it mean that we grow long
[33:14] hair.
[33:17] Thank God cuz it would look really weird
[33:18] with what I got going on here.
[33:22] And neither does it mean that we grow
[33:23] long hair as the artist pictures him
[33:25] having OR TO WEAR A ROBE AS HE WORE.
[33:29] For we're living IN ANOTHER DAY. NOW
[33:31] THINK OF HOW THAT THAT THAT uh elevates
[33:33] things. We have this long hair and we
[33:35] have a beard and we wear a robe. Well,
[33:37] we think that if we saw Jesus, THAT'S
[33:39] WHAT THAT'S WHAT WE EXPECT to see. So
[33:42] much so THAT WE THINK THAT IF WE COULD
[33:44] TIME TRAVEL, RIGHT, WE'RE GOING TO GO
[33:46] BACK IN TIME and we're just going to be
[33:48] able to walk into Jerusalem and there's
[33:51] Jesus in a robe drinking COFFEE
[33:55] LIKE AH THERE HE IS. THERE'S GOING TO BE
[33:57] THOUSANDS OF ROBES,
[33:59] &gt;&gt; THOUSANDS OF BEARDS, long hair, all the
[34:00] blue eyes, YOU CAN NAME IT. WHATEVER
[34:02] CHARACTERISTIC YOU THINK you're looking
[34:04] for, there's not going to be one single
[34:06] identifiable physical characteristic or
[34:08] length of robe or color of robe or all
[34:11] these different things. Say, there he
[34:12] is. I knew I would know who he was.
[34:15] It just wouldn't be sufficient. He says,
[34:19] "For we're living in another day."
[34:22] It was Jesus Christ was born 30 years
[34:25] ago.
[34:26] It it wouldn't be a matter, well, I know
[34:28] there's a Messiah amongst us, so let's
[34:29] just look for the robe. Let's look for
[34:31] the long hair. Those are the You might
[34:34] end up at Burger King.
[34:40] We're living in another day. We don't
[34:41] necessarily have to be that to reflect
[34:43] his physical image, but we must in our
[34:46] souls reflect his spirit image
[34:50] and his manner of life.
[34:53] &gt;&gt; So there must be an impression in the
[34:56] soul.
[34:57] WE MUST REFLECT HIS SPIRIT IMAGE IN OUR
[35:00] SOULS. And then there is a manner of
[35:03] life that we then live
[35:06] &gt;&gt; where we're holding his glory so that
[35:08] others can behold his glory.
[35:10] &gt;&gt; In Hebrews chapter 1:es 1 to4, we read
[35:14] this in our text. In the beginning, God
[35:15] at sunundry times and adverse manner
[35:17] spake in time past unto the fathers in
[35:19] the prophets. So he was in the prophets
[35:21] speaking his word. says, "By the
[35:22] prophets, hath in these last days spoken
[35:25] to us in his son, or by his son, whom he
[35:27] hath appointed heir of all things, by
[35:30] whom also he made the worlds, who being
[35:33] the brightness of his glory, we beheld
[35:35] his glory, full of grace and truth, and
[35:37] the express image of his person, and
[35:39] upholding all things by the word of his
[35:41] power, when he had by himself purged our
[35:43] sins, sat down on the right hand of the
[35:45] majesty on high," it says, being made so
[35:48] much better than the angels, as heath by
[35:51] an inheritance obtained ained a more
[35:52] excellent name than they. Hebrews goes
[35:54] on to say, "And being made perfect,
[35:56] it pleased him to make the captain of
[35:58] our salvations perfect through
[35:59] suffering." There was a process even in
[36:01] the life of Jesus Christ where he was
[36:03] made
[36:05] &gt;&gt; born. This is why we see God's pattern.
[36:08] HE SENDS THE MESSIAH as a baby in a
[36:10] manger. Why? Because God is a God of
[36:12] process. In the beginning, God created
[36:14] the heavens and the earth and then it
[36:16] unfolds over a period of time.
[36:18] Everything just doesn't step forth step
[36:20] forth instantly.
[36:22] &gt;&gt; God's a God of process. And how is it
[36:23] that you understand him and know his
[36:25] character? By the way he does things. If
[36:28] poof, there was just a house there. He
[36:29] said God is the creator of houses. Boom,
[36:33] they're just there. But when you see how
[36:35] someone works and the way they do things
[36:37] and the attention to detail and the way
[36:38] things are done on in the inside, kind
[36:40] of how the sausage is made, then you get
[36:42] to understand better what it is you're
[36:44] eating.
[36:45] you understand better the process THAT
[36:47] WENT INTO IT. SO HE was being made so
[36:49] much better. But it says he's not just
[36:52] the brightness of his glory, but it uses
[36:54] this phrase, the expressed image, excuse
[36:57] me, the express image of his person.
[37:00] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ,
[37:02] this one born of a woman, born in a
[37:05] manger who lived to die. Jesus Christ
[37:08] was the express image of God's nature.
[37:11] person there. It means this nature, the
[37:13] real being, a substantial quality.
[37:16] &gt;&gt; So, it wasn't that Jesus now reveals
[37:19] what God's always looked like in heaven.
[37:22] &gt;&gt; And so, we can go by AI get an idea of
[37:25] what Moses wanted to see and what all
[37:26] the ANGELS SAW. NO, THAT'S NOT THAT'S
[37:29] NOT IT AT ALL. IT'S THIS invisible part
[37:30] of God that no one knows unless time
[37:32] unfolds.
[37:34] &gt;&gt; I emphasize this a lot and I believe
[37:35] it's important. Sometimes I think modern
[37:37] Christianity looks at the the fall in
[37:40] the garden as you know literally eating
[37:42] an apple and that somehow was just God
[37:44] tempting them to a really beautiful
[37:45] fruit and when they ate it kind of God
[37:47] was like oh no they ate THE FORBIDDEN
[37:49] FRUIT THAT WASN'T SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN
[37:51] WHAT AM I GOING TO DO AH I'LL HAVE A SON
[37:53] AND KILL HIM and that there was this
[37:55] that everything is a consequence of a
[37:57] bad decision that the man and woman made
[38:00] but God had Adam and woman been the
[38:02] perfect couple and never sinned they
[38:05] would have never known God.
[38:08] &gt;&gt; They would have known that, man, he's a
[38:10] a creator, but that's only part of God.
[38:14] &gt;&gt; There's so many attributes and
[38:15] characteristics OF GOD THAT COULD NOT be
[38:18] known unless man experienced certain
[38:20] things.
[38:22] &gt;&gt; And so when Satan worked out what was
[38:24] necessary in the garden, Eden for God to
[38:25] fulfill his plan for him to make known
[38:27] himself, there was you begin to see his
[38:31] nature, his quality, what he desired.
[38:33] And then Christ comes and he is the
[38:34] express image of God's real being, his
[38:38] significant substantial qualities.
[38:41] &gt;&gt; And this word express image, we use two
[38:44] words, express image, but it means in
[38:46] the Greek an instrument used for
[38:48] engraving or carving.
[38:51] So there is an instrument. If you're an
[38:53] express in uh express image, it could
[38:56] speak of the instrument that's used to
[38:59] mark.
[39:02] So an engraver's tool, the pen, a
[39:05] scalpel, a knife, something that would
[39:07] cut or carve. If we were to talk about
[39:08] painting, it would be the brush.
[39:11] So that could that's the express image,
[39:13] but then also it's the mark stamped upon
[39:17] uh that by that instrument or wrought
[39:20] out on it. So there's you can have this
[39:22] two sides to it. The very thing that's
[39:24] used for it or it's the mark that's
[39:26] stamped upon that instrument or brought
[39:28] out by the instrument.
[39:31] So it's a mark or figure impressed in or
[39:33] stamped on express image. So you look at
[39:36] it this way. God is an express im God is
[39:40] something. He has a substantial quality.
[39:43] &gt;&gt; He is a an image, an express image. So
[39:45] that's an express image. But then also
[39:47] he becomes the engraving tool in the
[39:50] mark that gets stamped into Jesus
[39:52] Christ. And the word actually speaks of
[39:54] a faximile
[39:56] &gt;&gt; because now you have something that's
[39:58] impressed in flesh and it becomes this
[40:01] divine
[40:02] &gt;&gt; in humanity
[40:04] &gt;&gt; and he's the express image. So Jesus
[40:06] Christ was the impression of God.
[40:11] &gt;&gt; HE'S HE'S NOT JUST an external figure
[40:16] &gt;&gt; or just an idea.
[40:19] something very fascinating when it comes
[40:20] to ideas and I'm reading a statement
[40:23] here by David Hume and and could we say
[40:26] brother David Hume I'm not sure but
[40:28] there's these thoughts in terms of well
[40:31] what an idea is in ideas you know that's
[40:35] one thing but he writes about how
[40:38] impressions are something else
[40:41] and and I as I was reading it um earlier
[40:44] this year there's someh maybe it just
[40:47] kind
[40:47] It was informative to me and fascinating
[40:49] to me. But he was talking about well you
[40:50] can have you can have an idea but an
[40:53] idea that's not bound to some sort of
[40:55] experience doesn't have anything to it.
[40:59] But if you ever if you if you have an
[41:01] idea that can be brought back to an
[41:04] actual experience
[41:06] then you can produce the impression of
[41:08] it.
[41:10] &gt;&gt; And that's what that's what makes
[41:12] impressions deeper. And so this is a
[41:13] statement that's used of the
[41:15] impressionist movement to what does it
[41:17] mean to be an impressionist artist or to
[41:19] what does impressionism mean? It says by
[41:21] the term impression I want you to really
[41:23] think of this. I mean all of our more
[41:25] lively perceptions not just an idea. Has
[41:29] anyone ever uh heard the phrase of well
[41:33] uh um they they like the idea of being
[41:36] in a relationship or they like the idea
[41:38] of being in love or they like the idea
[41:39] of being employed and there's certain
[41:41] things they like they like the idea of
[41:44] it but they don't really want to work.
[41:46] &gt;&gt; They like the idea of of of being in
[41:49] love but they don't like what love is.
[41:52] They like the idea of being in a
[41:53] relationship but they don't want all the
[41:54] effort that has to go into it. So
[41:56] there's a lot of things where you have
[41:57] this ideal or this idea and it's really
[41:59] just a placeholder or name, but then
[42:01] there's these lively perceptions where
[42:03] there's this well this is what it
[42:05] actually is. It's more than just a sound
[42:08] or a symbol or a feel. And he goes the
[42:10] more lively perceptions when we hear or
[42:13] see or feel or love or hate or desire or
[42:17] will. Think of all these different
[42:19] emotions of hearing, seeing, feeling,
[42:21] love, hate, desire or will. Some of
[42:22] these things we can actually bring right
[42:24] to God. How God uh hates sin. God loves
[42:29] this. He desires he has a will. This
[42:31] hearing, the seeing or feeling all these
[42:33] different human perceptions. He says
[42:34] impressions are distinguished from ideas
[42:37] which are the less lively perceptions of
[42:40] which we are conscious
[42:42] when we reflect
[42:44] the the distinguished from ideas when we
[42:46] reflect on any of those sensations
[42:48] hearing seeing feeling love hate desire
[42:50] will or movements that have been
[42:52] mentioned above. So there's something
[42:54] deeper when we reflect an impression is
[42:56] not just the idea of love but when you
[42:59] reflect upon love what does it do to
[43:01] you?
[43:02] It's not the idea of desire or will or
[43:05] hearing. When you hear something, you
[43:06] can have the idea of hearing. In other
[43:08] words, it's I can hear. It's one of my
[43:10] favorite uh maybe it's a dad joke. DO
[43:11] YOU HEAR WHAT I HEAR? NO, I hear what I
[43:14] hear. And there's a a level of just you
[43:17] CAN HEAR THE SOUND AND WE CAN ALL HEAR
[43:19] THE SAME SOUND. But what does that mean
[43:20] to you?
[43:21] &gt;&gt; As all have approached the portrait of
[43:23] the Bible, as all have approached the
[43:24] portrait OF JESUS CHRIST, PEOPLE SAY,
[43:26] "WELL, I've seen it. I've heard it. Been
[43:29] there, done that." But the question
[43:30] isn't so much what do you see or what
[43:32] you hear, but what is what is aroused by
[43:35] that? WHAT'S THE MORE LIVELY PERCEPTION?
[43:37] HOW HAVE YOU BEEN impressed
[43:40] &gt;&gt; by what you heard?
[43:42] &gt;&gt; This is where sometimes people miss it.
[43:44] God is impressing them and impressing
[43:46] them. The word is impressing them. The
[43:47] spirit is impressing them. And they just
[43:49] get this idea, this general idea of God
[43:51] and love and Christ and the spirit, but
[43:53] they lose sight of what it was really
[43:55] impressing. And the devil can come
[43:57] around and paint a different picture.
[43:59] And because you haven't been sensitive
[44:00] to the impression that was made,
[44:02] &gt;&gt; right?
[44:03] &gt;&gt; He can he can create a different image
[44:05] and interpretation in your mind when you
[44:07] be what what am I feeling in this
[44:09] moment? Not somebody's interpretation of
[44:11] what I've heard and what I've seen, but
[44:13] how has it impressed me?
[44:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[44:15] &gt;&gt; Been thinking a lot about the concept of
[44:17] the idea of he who is without sin, let
[44:19] him cast the first stone. A and really a
[44:23] lot of people try to climb upon a
[44:25] platform of tearing uh other people down
[44:28] on the basis of their flaws and their
[44:30] mistakes and sins that they think are so
[44:31] readily apparent. But I believe the
[44:33] scripture stands to reason still. Let he
[44:36] who is without sin step upon that
[44:38] platform to tear somebody else down
[44:40] based upon their sins or their failures
[44:42] or their mistakes. Let every man's word
[44:44] be a lie. Let God's word be the truth.
[44:47] &gt;&gt; Let us stand upon the proposition that
[44:49] God's Bible is the absolute truth. Let
[44:51] us believe that Jesus Christ is the same
[44:53] yesterday, today, and forever. And don't
[44:55] take my word for it. You look to God to
[44:57] reveal it to you. LET HIM IMPRESS that
[44:59] upon you.
[45:00] &gt;&gt; Because if you take my word FOR IT AND
[45:02] SOMEBODY'S able to convince you of
[45:03] something I did in my past or something
[45:04] I did THAT WAS DISHONEST, THEN YOU MIGHT
[45:06] AS WELL JUST NOT believe what I said.
[45:08] And what does that leave you with? More
[45:09] ideas.
[45:12] But to the impression
[45:16] there has to be there's got to be it's
[45:19] got to be to a point to where it's not
[45:20] just the idea of Christ. It's not just
[45:22] the idea of the word. It's not just the
[45:23] idea of being a Christian, but there's
[45:25] been an impression
[45:27] in the soul to create the manner of
[45:30] life.
[45:32] The word the express image in the Greek
[45:36] is character.
[45:38] That's the actual Greek word from
[45:41] caraso.
[45:43] It's character. Who was the character of
[45:47] God?
[45:49] Not a character. Some of us think when
[45:51] God said you needed more character, you
[45:53] thought he meant Disney and that's why
[45:54] you've gotten the result that you've
[45:55] got.
[45:57] But he says character, which comes from
[46:00] the Greek word teraso, which means to
[46:02] sharpen to a point.
[46:05] &gt;&gt; So this is the idea. But when you think
[46:07] of a character, what do you think in the
[46:09] written character is used by a writing
[46:12] instrument or a tool? It's engraved that
[46:14] produces a character. It's a distinctive
[46:16] mark who's the expressed image. He's
[46:18] this mark. So the word caraso comes back
[46:22] to the idea of carving or engraving.
[46:26] He was the impression. God carved out
[46:29] his identity in it. He shaped it. He
[46:32] brought it out actually from the idea of
[46:34] scratching is what it means and actually
[46:37] is akin to what we'd use for grapho or
[46:39] writing in the Greek.
[46:43] He was the character of God.
[46:50] In Ephesians 4 11-16 it says and he gave
[46:54] some apostles and some prophets and some
[46:56] evangelists and some pastors and
[46:57] teachers.
[46:59] Now this becomes the impressions of
[47:01] Christ. If Christ God impressed himself
[47:04] in Christ. If God had formed himself as
[47:08] the word was made flesh and you see the
[47:12] character of God in Christ. Now there's
[47:14] impressions of Christ.
[47:17] Christ gave these gifts to men,
[47:19] apostles, prophets, evangelists,
[47:20] pastors, and teachers. For what purpose?
[47:22] The perfecting of the saints. as Jesus
[47:25] Christ was made perfect through
[47:26] suffering and being made so much better.
[47:29] This is for the perfecting of the
[47:30] saints, for the work of the ministry,
[47:31] for the edifying of the body of Christ.
[47:33] That's the building up, the
[47:34] strengthening till we all come into the
[47:36] unity of the faith and the knowledge of
[47:37] the son of God unto
[47:40] &gt;&gt; a perfect man.
[47:42] &gt;&gt; This is that all of us individually are
[47:44] we're TO GROW INTO THE stature of a
[47:47] perfect unto the measure of the stature
[47:48] of the fullness of Christ. Amen.
[47:51] &gt;&gt; This portrait of humanity and divinity
[47:53] that we henceforth be no more children.
[47:54] So this is a growing up, a maturing, a
[47:56] stabilizing, tossed to and fro and
[47:58] carried about with every wind of
[47:59] doctrine by the slight of men and
[48:00] cunning craftness whereby they lie and
[48:02] wait to deceive.
[48:04] But the word is to be spoken in love.
[48:06] But speaking the truth in love, you as
[48:08] the word these gifts preach the word and
[48:11] they speak the truth in love, you may
[48:13] grow up
[48:15] &gt;&gt; into him in all things. Amen.
[48:20] &gt;&gt; Which is the head, even Christ. We're to
[48:21] grow up into him.
[48:23] &gt;&gt; He is the stature of a perfect man. He
[48:25] is your measure.
[48:27] &gt;&gt; He is your image. This is what we look
[48:29] to when we say, "Wow, I want to be like
[48:31] Jesus." Long robe, long hair, long
[48:33] beard, drink coffee.
[48:37] I want to be like Jesus. No, it's this
[48:39] measure, this stature, this character,
[48:41] these attributes, this life of Christ.
[48:44] So Christ is the head for whom the whole
[48:45] body is fitly joined together. So now we
[48:47] are joined together compacted that which
[48:49] every joint supplieth. Everyone working
[48:52] their part together. Says according to
[48:54] the effectual working in the measure of
[48:57] every part
[48:59] maketh increase of the body under the
[49:00] edifying of itself in love. So we all
[49:03] have a part to play in the growing and
[49:07] the building of this body.
[49:09] If I could say it this way, you're born
[49:11] by the new birth into a creative process
[49:15] to where you are to become the expressed
[49:17] image of Christ.
[49:19] &gt;&gt; The impression.
[49:22] &gt;&gt; The new birth is a stamp on the soul
[49:25] that now is to write and impress in your
[49:29] life Christ.
[49:30] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[49:31] &gt;&gt; So that others could see the mark.
[49:33] Right. Right.
[49:34] &gt;&gt; And you'll go unto your own and the own
[49:36] your your own may not receive you but as
[49:39] many as receive him.
[49:41] &gt;&gt; There's a there's a witness. There's a
[49:42] testimony as that song says marked
[49:44] marked marked. I'm marked wherever I go.
[49:47] &gt;&gt; WHETHER YOU RECEIVE WHETHER PEOPLE CAN
[49:49] SAY OH THERE'S A MARK OF A REAL
[49:50] CHRISTIAN. THERE'S A GENUINE SEED OF
[49:51] GOD. THEY MAY NOT ALL KNOW THAT BUT YET
[49:54] THERE STILL IS THE IMPRESSION OF CHRIST
[49:56] IN YOU. AMEN.
[49:59] &gt;&gt; Says the working the measure of every
[50:01] part makes increase to what? Into
[50:04] perfection.
[50:05] There's this working out. And it says
[50:08] this in verses six and seven because it
[50:10] says under the measure of the stature of
[50:12] the fullness of Christ as these as the
[50:15] spirit of God is working in the measure
[50:16] of every part. So these all these
[50:19] measures says there's one God and father
[50:21] of all who is above all and through all
[50:24] and in you all.
[50:26] So it's Christ in you, the hope of
[50:28] glory,
[50:29] &gt;&gt; the promise of glory. He says, "But unto
[50:31] every one of us is given grace." SO IT'S
[50:34] GOD IN ALL OF US, BUT EVERY SINGLE ONE
[50:36] of us are given a grace according to the
[50:39] measure of the gift of Christ.
[50:43] &gt;&gt; This I think it's good to connect this
[50:45] measure with the other measures that are
[50:47] mentioned in this chapter. The measure
[50:49] of the stature of the fullness of
[50:51] Christ, the measure of every part. So
[50:55] therefore, we are given grace
[50:57] in order that we might, we've received a
[50:59] grace from Christ
[51:02] according to the divine artist will
[51:05] purpose that God wants you to come into
[51:08] his image. God wants you to be formed
[51:12] into his likeness. AND SO HE HAS GIVEN
[51:15] OF US GIVEN US A grace according to the
[51:18] measure
[51:19] &gt;&gt; of the gift. AND ALL HIS GIFTS ARE
[51:21] PERFECT.
[51:22] &gt;&gt; AMEN. the gift of Christ. AND WHAT IS
[51:24] THIS MEASURE OF THE G? HE'S GIVEN US a
[51:26] grace, the measure of the gift of
[51:28] Christ. He's given some these gifts for
[51:31] perfecting THAT WE COULD GROW INTO THE
[51:34] STATURE OF THE FULLNESS OF CHRIST. WE
[51:36] COULD GROW UP INTO THE HEAD, THIS
[51:38] perfect man.
[51:41] &gt;&gt; This is what this measure of the CHRIST
[51:43] IS FOR. THAT WE can grow into. WE CAN BE
[51:46] IMPRESSED BY THE word so that we can be
[51:48] impressions of Christ. Amen.
[51:51] &gt;&gt; It's a measure of Christ to be
[51:52] impressions of Christ. This expression
[51:54] of humanity and divinity, the sacred,
[51:58] the divine, deity in flesh, the sacred
[52:00] and the profane.
[52:02] You may be thinking, you've been saying
[52:04] this for 79 services. And that means
[52:08] you've done the math.
[52:13] In the sermon identification, brother
[52:14] Bradam says, "We've got to take the
[52:16] entire full gospel."
[52:19] He says, Seeing that we've identified
[52:21] ourselves as full gospel people. I love
[52:23] this. If you you believe the Bible, you
[52:25] full gospel, you believe the word of
[52:26] God, let our let's mold our character.
[52:29] So now he's saying not moldy character,
[52:32] &gt;&gt; but not there's there something. Let it
[52:35] let it be shaped. We're invited to be
[52:37] molded in his image.
[52:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[52:40] &gt;&gt; That we might reflect his presence.
[52:42] &gt;&gt; We're invited to be impressed
[52:45] &gt;&gt; so that we can be that distinctive mark.
[52:49] And remember this is more than the idea.
[52:51] We are we are to be impressed.
[52:54] So it's more than just the surface. It's
[52:57] scratched in. It's not a temporary
[52:58] tattoo. It's not an identity you just
[53:00] changed. It's marked in there.
[53:03] &gt;&gt; So therefore the works that he did we
[53:05] can do also.
[53:07] &gt;&gt; The life that he lives we shall live.
[53:10] &gt;&gt; So he says we're invited BY GOD TO TAKE
[53:11] HIM AS AN EXAMPLE. So Christ IS OUR
[53:14] EXAMPLE. EXAMPLE WHAT? GOD LIKENESS.
[53:16] &gt;&gt; YES. So the mystery of god likeness and
[53:18] let our character be molded like his.
[53:20] WE'VE GOT TO ALLOW OUR CHARACTER TO be
[53:22] molded
[53:24] &gt;&gt; shaped
[53:25] only the word can do that.
[53:27] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[53:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[53:28] &gt;&gt; But this is this distinctive quality
[53:30] that he's given you. We know that
[53:32] perfect character comes by say it with
[53:35] me
[53:36] &gt;&gt; suffering.
[53:38] &gt;&gt; But we SUFFER ACCORDING TO THE WILL OF
[53:39] GOD. And it has to our suffering came
[53:43] up. Well, IF PERFECTION IS MADE BY
[53:45] SUFFERING, then why don't we all just
[53:48] become cutters?
[53:50] Why don't we all just, you know, run
[53:52] marathons in August in Phoenix? [snorts]
[53:55] You know, why don't we just find way?
[53:56] LET'S GO GO HUG A a choya.
[53:59] Let's go lay on a barrel CACTUS AND COME
[54:02] AWAY. I GOT CHARACTER.
[54:05] THOSE AREN'T THE marks we're looking
[54:07] for.
[54:09] There has to be a suffering as as a as
[54:12] as a different mode of operation.
[54:15] And listen, you have been given a
[54:18] quality that can turn, you've been
[54:22] placed in a particular position to where
[54:25] you can turn external suffering into
[54:29] internal glory,
[54:31] &gt;&gt; EXTERNAL PRESSURE, CRITICISM,
[54:32] DIFFICULTIES, HARDNESS, and it produces
[54:35] a diamond. Amen.
[54:38] &gt;&gt; In order to form a diamond out of coal,
[54:39] of course, science is getting way ahead
[54:40] of it to where fake diamonds are going
[54:42] to be more valuable than the real ones.
[54:44] But there IS A THE GENUINE PROCESS THAT
[54:46] REQUIRES CERTAIN DEPTH, CERTAIN
[54:48] PRESSURE, CERTAIN HEAT, CERTAIN ELEMENTS
[54:49] IN ORDER FOR THAT DIAMOND TO BE FORMED.
[54:51] AND SO IN IN TYPE, WE BEING BAPTIZED
[54:54] INTO THE BODY OF CHRIST BY THE NEW
[54:55] BIRTH. WE THEREFORE are placed in a area
[54:58] where the pressures can bring OUT THE
[55:01] REAL PROMISE OF THAT PLACING, THE REAL
[55:03] GLORY OF THAT PLACING WHERE EVERYTHING
[55:05] YOU GO THROUGH, YOU ARE HAVE A QUALITY
[55:07] TO turn your obedience into glory.
[55:14] &gt;&gt; We must let
[55:16] his character be in us by having the
[55:19] mind of Christ which is his character.
[55:21] Your mind makes your character. So when
[55:23] we say let this mind be in you, it molds
[55:26] the character of a son of God.
[55:28] &gt;&gt; The mind is molding it. I've got it.
[55:30] I've got it. Well, then let it mold your
[55:31] character. He says in identification
[55:34] later the next year in 64, you're
[55:36] invited to come and take his character.
[55:38] Not just the be beneficiaries of his
[55:40] blood and salvation. This is what makes
[55:42] the way for. But his shedding of his
[55:44] blood, the receiving of the Holy Spirit,
[55:45] it's an invitation to come and take his
[55:47] character. By having his character in
[55:50] you, it molds you into the same mind
[55:52] that he was. So now notice the engraving
[55:54] instrument.
[55:55] The impression is the character that
[55:57] becomes an instrument. It becomes a tool
[56:00] &gt;&gt; to mold our minds. His mind was always
[56:02] to do the father's will, what the father
[56:05] had ordained him to do.
[56:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:08] &gt;&gt; As the father impressed himself in
[56:10] Christ and he did what that impression
[56:13] it told him to do, we then with the holy
[56:15] spirit there should be this engraver in
[56:17] our hearts. this tool that is marking us
[56:20] out.
[56:21] In Galatians chapter 4 19, Paul said,
[56:24] "My little children of whom I travail in
[56:26] birth again until
[56:29] Christ be formed in you."
[56:33] &gt;&gt; The words that he's speaking to the
[56:34] Galatians, he's troubled. He's he he
[56:37] sees that they've run well and they've
[56:38] started out and that they've done the
[56:40] right things,
[56:42] but he's saying, "Don't you know that
[56:44] you've been given this this operation of
[56:46] the Holy Spirit to bring us into
[56:47] maturity that we do not behave as
[56:50] servants
[56:53] until Christ be formed in you
[56:56] till you become the visible image of
[56:59] Jesus Christ." That's what the it is
[57:01] Christ be formed in you. It it's not
[57:03] this hidden Christ where he's gonna have
[57:07] he has some sort of looking glass into
[57:08] your soul and come here let me look into
[57:10] your ear and he's like yep I see him. No
[57:12] it's this Christ be formed in you. It it
[57:15] speaks of this in this visible
[57:17] reflection this image of Christ
[57:20] impression Christ was the express image
[57:25] of God's person his substantial quality
[57:27] his character that's what express is his
[57:30] character and this impression this
[57:32] marking out this is how he can say in 2
[57:34] Corinthians 3:3 for as much as you are
[57:36] manifestly declared to be the epistle of
[57:38] Christ
[57:40] written with the spirit of living God in
[57:43] fleshly tables of the
[57:45] What are you? You are
[57:48] the the the impression of Christ, the
[57:51] character of Christ written by the
[57:55] spirit of living God in fleshly tables
[57:57] of the heart. This is what this verse is
[58:00] expressing. It's written not in a table
[58:03] of stone that can be broken, but yet
[58:04] it's this idea of engraving, marking
[58:07] as characters WOULD BE ETCHED OUT OF
[58:09] STONE. The spirit of God is etching into
[58:12] your heart the character of Christ, the
[58:15] mind OF CHRIST. I I DON'T WANT GOD TO
[58:17] STOP WRITING. I DON'T WANT THE spirit to
[58:20] stop etching. I DON'T WANT HIM TO STOP
[58:22] CARVING OUT IN MY HEART. DO THE WORK IN
[58:24] MY HEART. DO A HEART WORK.
[58:26] &gt;&gt; I WANT MY HEART TO BE CHANGED. I WANT MY
[58:28] HEART TO BE MOLDED. I WANT MY THOUGHTS
[58:30] TO CHANGE. I WANT TO BRING EVERY THOUGHT
[58:32] CAPTIVE TO THE OBEDIENCE OF JESUS
[58:33] CHRIST. THIS IS THIS IS THE WORK OF GOD
[58:36] &gt;&gt; THAT CHRIST WOULD CONTINUE TO HAVE
[58:38] PREEMINENCE. this impression
[58:42] &gt;&gt; depress and depress and depress and as
[58:44] the more he presses in my heart the more
[58:45] he gets stamped in my heart the more
[58:47] that I become an impression of Christ
[58:52] &gt;&gt; revelations 2:12 just a few verses to
[58:56] end on here
[58:58] says and the to the angel of the church
[59:00] impergamus write these things saith he
[59:05] which hath the sharp sword with two
[59:08] edges
[59:11] A sharp sword is defined as something
[59:14] that's used for cutting or carving.
[59:18] It's a blade. It's a sword. You take a
[59:20] sword and you're going to cleave.
[59:22] You're going to cut. Hebrews 4:12 says,
[59:24] "The word of God is sharper than any
[59:26] two-edged sword. It's powerful.
[59:29] &gt;&gt; It pierces and in doing so, it divides a
[59:32] can divide between soul and spirit and
[59:34] body
[59:35] &gt;&gt; and is a discerner of the thoughts and
[59:37] intents of the heart. Amen.
[59:38] &gt;&gt; What's that? What's the word doing?
[59:41] &gt;&gt; Carving.
[59:42] &gt;&gt; The word of God is an impressor.
[59:45] &gt;&gt; It's that instrument.
[59:48] &gt;&gt; It's it's it's an impression itself. It
[59:50] the word of God has a an image, but then
[59:54] it goes in and it begins to burn into
[59:56] the flesh its own image. Begins to cut
[59:58] away anything that doesn't fit that
[1:00:00] image.
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; Revelations 1:16. and he had in his
[1:00:05] right hand seven stars. And out of his
[1:00:06] mouth, we know those are the messengers.
[1:00:07] And out of his mouth went a sharp
[1:00:09] two-edged sword.
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; That's what the word of God is.
[1:00:13] &gt;&gt; The word of God is quick and powerful.
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; It is likened unto a two-edged sword.
[1:00:21] that not only not only does it cut on
[1:00:24] this side, it's going to cut away
[1:00:27] &gt;&gt; and it's going to take away something
[1:00:29] that doesn't belong, but there's this
[1:00:30] other side to where it's shaping
[1:00:34] and preserving what is
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; that image that God wants in you.
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; We're not living in a day of the great
[1:00:42] revivals.
[1:00:43] Unfortunately, we're not living in a
[1:00:45] time, I guess, if you were an
[1:00:46] evangelist, you'd love to live in the
[1:00:47] days gone by where you could have tent
[1:00:48] revival meetings every night and altars
[1:00:51] would be packed and thousands of people
[1:00:52] are being saved. But we're not living in
[1:00:54] that time. It's a gleaning time.
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; It it's a maturing time. It's a ripening
[1:00:59] time. And we're living in the time where
[1:01:01] end time evangelis evangelism is not the
[1:01:04] finding of stones and gathering stones
[1:01:06] into a rocky yard. But now it takes the
[1:01:08] cutter where the sharp two-edged sword
[1:01:10] of the word of God is shaping the stones
[1:01:12] to fit in the body of Christ.
[1:01:15] &gt;&gt; Every measure fit together because it
[1:01:17] takes every part shaped to fit into the
[1:01:20] stature of a perfect man. I believe that
[1:01:22] in you, God is molding the image of
[1:01:24] Jesus Christ. But together,
[1:01:26] collectively, we're creating this
[1:01:28] beautiful body of Jesus Christ, which is
[1:01:30] the stature of a perfect man, which is
[1:01:32] the perfect portrait of humanity and
[1:01:34] divinity. But it TAKES THAT SHARP
[1:01:36] TWO-EDGED SWORD TO CUT and to shave to
[1:01:39] impress in you.
[1:01:41] &gt;&gt; This word HAS GOT TO IMPRESS US.
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; WE DON'T COME TO CHURCH BUT THAT WAS A
[1:01:46] GOOD IDEA.
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; COME ON, BROTHER.
[1:01:48] &gt;&gt; But the word must impress.
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; I don't ever want to wield a sword where
[1:01:52] I'm just trying to cut you up and hack
[1:01:54] you up. Some people say, "Well, my job
[1:01:56] is to afflict the comforted and comfort
[1:01:58] the afflicted." I don't take any such
[1:02:00] creeds. JUST PREACH THE word
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; because it's the word that's going to
[1:02:04] cut away the things that don't belong.
[1:02:05] It's the word that's going to preserve
[1:02:07] and lift up and strengthen those things
[1:02:09] that we do need.
[1:02:11] If
[1:02:11] &gt;&gt; our musicians could come to their
[1:02:13] instruments in the church age book,
[1:02:15] chapter 5, page 169, brother Brandham
[1:02:18] writes this,
[1:02:20] and he's referring to these very
[1:02:21] scriptures here in Revelations 2. He
[1:02:23] says, "He knew that the way man
[1:02:25] originally got away from God was by
[1:02:26] first leaving the word. Thou hast left
[1:02:28] thy first love." It's this falling away
[1:02:30] there in Revelations 2. If you leave
[1:02:33] that word, you left God.
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; Thus, he's presenting himself to the
[1:02:38] church at Pergamus. Who is he
[1:02:39] presenting? Himself.
[1:02:41] The these things saith he which hath a
[1:02:43] sharp two-edged sword.
[1:02:46] He's presenting himself, the word. And
[1:02:47] indeed, to all church ages, I am the
[1:02:50] word. This is what the Bible's telling
[1:02:52] us. If you want deity in your midst,
[1:02:54] then welcome and receive the word. Amen.
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; Now, we could think, I want the spirit
[1:03:01] of God to move in this church service. I
[1:03:03] want there to be power and
[1:03:04] demonstration. And so, I we could take
[1:03:07] this in a way, well, if you want deity
[1:03:08] in your midst, then welcome and receive
[1:03:10] the word. And we can make that this idea
[1:03:13] of what we're trying to do in church
[1:03:15] services.
[1:03:17] this deity in our midst. Oh, how how
[1:03:21] good would it I mean, let's just admit
[1:03:23] it would be good if we welcomed and
[1:03:26] received the word in a church service
[1:03:27] and deity was in our midst.
[1:03:30] But how would you feel that if you knew
[1:03:32] as soon as you hit two sets of double
[1:03:34] doors that he stayed right here
[1:03:38] and you just [music] you had to pine for
[1:03:39] the next service? Like, man, Brother
[1:03:41] Aaron's cancelling church
[1:03:43] on the night when we need it the most,
[1:03:45] and I can't wait till Sunday, you know,
[1:03:47] when we can welcome and receive the
[1:03:49] word. The welcoming and receiving the
[1:03:50] word isn't for church dynamics,
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; It's for individual dynamics.
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; The dynamics to the mechanics is it's
[1:04:00] Christ the word in the individual's
[1:04:03] life. If you want deity in your midst,
[1:04:04] welcome and receive the word.
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; You want want more Christ, welcome and
[1:04:07] receive the word. You want to be more
[1:04:09] like like Christ, let it welcome and
[1:04:11] receive it. Do not let anyone or
[1:04:13] anything get between you and the word.
[1:04:16] This is Christ speaking through the
[1:04:17] word. Is he summarizing it? That which
[1:04:19] I'm giving you, the word is a revelation
[1:04:22] of myself. The word is a REVELATION OF
[1:04:24] HIMSELF. I AM THE WORD. Remember that
[1:04:28] these things saith me WHO HAS A SHARP
[1:04:31] TWO-EDGED SWORD. I AM THE WORD. Don't
[1:04:35] let anything GET BETWEEN YOU AND THE
[1:04:36] WORD. IT'S GOING TO CHANGE THE THE
[1:04:38] IMPRESSION.
[1:04:40] &gt;&gt; It's going to change THE WAY IT HITS
[1:04:41] YOU.
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; And then, Brother Brandon makes this
[1:04:44] observation and I'm ending I'm ending
[1:04:46] the this this year's series of sermons
[1:04:48] on this. I wonder if we are sufficiently
[1:04:51] impressed with the word in our midst.
[1:04:55] &gt;&gt; I wonder if we are sufficiently
[1:04:58] impressed with the word in our midst.
[1:05:01] Now, WE MIGHT LOOK AT THAT AND THINK,
[1:05:03] "OH, that means h impressive."
[1:05:07] That like, "Yeah, that's I like that.
[1:05:09] That impressive." And we could think of
[1:05:12] all sorts of memes that we could share
[1:05:14] in response to, "Wow, what an impressive
[1:05:16] word, RIGHT?" LIKE, I'M BUT THAT'S not
[1:05:19] what he's meaning.
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; Are you
[1:05:24] impressed? [music]
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; Do you feel the pressure of it? Right?
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; Is is is the word touching you?
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; Is it getting deep? Is it more than just
[1:05:37] an idea? But are we sufficiently
[1:05:40] impressed? That that that means that
[1:05:42] it's to create or to produce a desired
[1:05:46] result.
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; So is that enough? It's sufficient. It
[1:05:50] means it it meets the standard of what
[1:05:53] it whatever it needs to produce. I I my
[1:05:57] challenge then is this. If we are to be
[1:05:59] godly enough to be separate, but human
[1:06:01] enough to be relatable, the only way
[1:06:02] we're going to be able to produce that
[1:06:03] perfect blend of humanity and divinity
[1:06:06] is if the word which was made flesh
[1:06:08] could imprint our imprint our lives.
[1:06:12] And so we have to we have to feed on the
[1:06:13] word of God to let that impression work
[1:06:16] into our lives so that I can become this
[1:06:18] impression
[1:06:20] and I don't HAVE TO WORRY SO MUCH ABOUT
[1:06:22] becoming alien in making MYSELF
[1:06:25] DIFFERENT OR DOING WEIRD THINGS. Just
[1:06:27] let the Holy Spirit work in your life.
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; People be saying things about that nurse
[1:06:31] that's singing in that in the room and
[1:06:34] and praying over people who are
[1:06:35] unconscious. THERE'S GOING TO BE A LOT
[1:06:36] OF THINGS SAID ABOUT YOU BY THE WAY THE
[1:06:37] WORD IMPRESSES you and your life begins
[1:06:39] to change and your standard of holiness
[1:06:41] and the things you ABSTAIN FROM. JUST
[1:06:42] THE WORD DOING THAT IN YOUR LIFE IS
[1:06:44] GOING TO CREATE more of the charact.
[1:06:46] People have plenty of weird things to
[1:06:47] say about you. We don't HAVE TO BECOME
[1:06:49] CLANISH OR cultish
[1:06:51] &gt;&gt; or dogmatic about things to produce this
[1:06:54] visible idea
[1:06:57] that becomes a very stubborn thing in
[1:06:59] people's minds.
[1:07:01] But we should just desire for the
[1:07:03] impression of Christ.
[1:07:05] I want to be impressed as I look into
[1:07:07] this word of God. I want it to impress
[1:07:09] me. I don't want to come away with an
[1:07:10] idea of Christianity. I want the
[1:07:12] likeness of Christ to be impressed in
[1:07:14] me. We must be my prayer for this new
[1:07:16] year is I want to continue to be
[1:07:19] sufficiently impressed with the word
[1:07:22] that is [music] present,
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; the living word that is with us.
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; Let's stand.
[1:07:31] I I
[1:07:35] brother Philip had this song on his list
[1:07:37] and I thought it was a beautiful song to
[1:07:39] sing.
[1:07:40] It's a song uh
[1:07:44] La Fontaine sang and I believe brother
[1:07:46] Paul wrote it.
[1:07:48] Brother Paul La Fontaine, you're
[1:07:49] familiar with him. He's just been a dear
[1:07:51] friend uh to us, very supportive of our
[1:07:53] church. Just that [music] draws from
[1:07:56] that scene in the day of Christ's birth.
[1:07:58] Just a simple stable,
[1:08:02] nothing ornate. [music]
[1:08:04] And and clearly this is not a place
[1:08:05] where royalty
[1:08:07] is born.
[1:08:09] uh and he takes and says, "Well, if God
[1:08:12] would allow the King of Kings, the son
[1:08:14] of God, the King of glory to [snorts] be
[1:08:16] born in such a such a simple stable,
[1:08:21] [music] then truly he can choose me."
[1:08:26] And so we could say, "Well, outwardly
[1:08:27] we're nothing. We're not much to behold.
[1:08:29] It's not really a place for his word to
[1:08:31] unfold." But yet he [music] comes as an
[1:08:33] instrument, an engraving instrument to
[1:08:35] write the word in our hearts to impress
[1:08:37] us that you can become his masterpiece.
[1:08:41] We just have to yield our vessels to him
[1:08:43] to allow ourselves to be impressed with
[1:08:46] his word. Let us pray today that his
[1:08:49] word would be born, be impressed
[1:08:51] in our hearts so that it can live
[1:08:54] through us. Our gracious heavenly
[1:08:56] father, as we close this year out and we
[1:08:58] begin to look forward to a new year,
[1:09:01] there is a concept in human behavior and
[1:09:04] behavioral economics of a doorway effect
[1:09:06] where the very act of walking through a
[1:09:09] door allows our thoughts to reset. And
[1:09:11] that's why sometimes we can forget what
[1:09:14] we were looking for, what we wanted to
[1:09:15] say just by passing through a door.
[1:09:19] So Lord, [music] by allegory, we're
[1:09:22] closing the door on 2025 or passing
[1:09:25] through a doorway into 2026. And we
[1:09:27] close a door and turn a new page. A lot
[1:09:29] of different ways that we describe it.
[1:09:30] And Lord, we do like the fact that we
[1:09:33] can start fresh. We can renew vows and
[1:09:36] make resolutions.
[1:09:38] And today, Lord, we resolve no light
[1:09:41] thing, no small thing. But Lord, we want
[1:09:46] we want to be impressed sufficiently by
[1:09:47] your word. And
[1:09:50] Lord, we can look back on this year and
[1:09:51] say there's been positive changes. And
[1:09:53] yes, Lord, there's been loss and there's
[1:09:55] been hurt. There's been
[1:09:57] backslidings and wewardness and
[1:09:59] decisions made, Lord, that have been
[1:10:02] difficult to make. Some admirable,
[1:10:03] others discouraging, Lord. Just a number
[1:10:06] of different ways we could begin to view
[1:10:08] this year. But we believe that you're in
[1:10:09] control, Lord.
[1:10:13] And Lord, we believe that you had a plan
[1:10:15] in all of it.
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; And so Lord, you've been trying to stamp
[1:10:19] something out. You've been trying to
[1:10:20] carve something in our lives. And we
[1:10:22] just continue to yield to your
[1:10:23] instrument that we might be instruments.
[1:10:26] Lord, may we be impressions of Christ so
[1:10:28] that we can stamp make a mark in other
[1:10:31] people's lives.
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; Not with our own personality, not with
[1:10:35] our own taste and our own ideas, but
[1:10:37] Lord, with by your heart and your mind.
[1:10:41] May we be these impressions. May our
[1:10:43] lives have these broad bold brush
[1:10:46] strokes of grace and truth.
[1:10:50] May we take upon ourselves this mind of
[1:10:53] Christ
[1:11:00] and live
[1:11:04] your manner of life, Lord. coming into
[1:11:06] this new year, Lord, may we as a church,
[1:11:10] have a collective vision. May we become
[1:11:12] more keenly aware of what it is you
[1:11:14] would want us to do as church members
[1:11:15] and as a body. And Lord, I realize it
[1:11:18] forms much, you know, a large part to
[1:11:21] some families, a smaller part to others,
[1:11:23] and we all have different levels of
[1:11:24] service and support and attendance, but
[1:11:27] Father, may we be able to find that
[1:11:29] balance and rhythm here as a church to
[1:11:31] be all that we ought to be, the
[1:11:32] community that uh we should be providing
[1:11:35] those fellowships and opportunities and
[1:11:38] outlets. Lord, we want we don't want to
[1:11:39] fall short in any way as a church and as
[1:11:43] members of a church and those the duty
[1:11:45] we have through this office and these
[1:11:47] callings we have here.
[1:11:50] And Lord, more importantly, may we
[1:11:54] take great thought to these things of
[1:11:56] love and desire and will,
[1:11:59] what our duties are and what your will
[1:12:00] for us in this coming year would be. And
[1:12:02] [music] to think more than just an idea,
[1:12:04] but be impressed. have these more lively
[1:12:06] discernments and perceptions, these
[1:12:08] revelations. Make it alive to us by
[1:12:11] revelation
[1:12:13] so that their lives could be changed
[1:12:14] from glory to glory, day by day, word by
[1:12:16] word, line upon line, as the sword of
[1:12:19] the word continues to mark out Christ in
[1:12:22] us. We commit all things to you now in
[1:12:24] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
