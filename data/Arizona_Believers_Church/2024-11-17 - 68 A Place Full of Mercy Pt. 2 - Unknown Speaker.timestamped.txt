[0:00] I'd like to continue on the subject of a
[0:03] Place full of Mercy this is coming on uh
[0:06] the heels of is there room for mercy and
[0:08] asking the question of is there room for
[0:10] mercy and taking some very outstanding
[0:13] scriptures uh that are being fulfilled
[0:15] in the time that we're living in right
[0:16] now things that brother brandham
[0:18] identified with his own Ministry
[0:19] Revelations chap 10 and Luke 17:30 and
[0:23] so we see certain events unfolding and
[0:25] things taking place and so it challenges
[0:29] us as we see those things in scripture
[0:31] and then we also recognize that it
[0:32] challenged brother Brandon because then
[0:34] he preaches a sermon souls in prison now
[0:37] and he's asking the question and
[0:38] speculating could it be in light of
[0:40] these things that have been fulfilled
[0:43] that we've entered this time of Ministry
[0:46] of Jesus Christ where no one can be
[0:48] saved and the door of Mercy shut and
[0:51] he's saying I sure hope not I hope I'm
[0:53] wrong I hope not and I believe the
[0:55] purpose of that sermon was so that we or
[0:58] one of the things that I gather from
[1:00] from that as you recognize the
[1:01] significance of the things that have
[1:03] been fulfilled what brother Brandon may
[1:05] have previously thought would happen now
[1:08] since it's not happening he's wondering
[1:10] is there this time even in this last day
[1:12] where there's this third pole Ministry
[1:14] which is only to the lost or which is to
[1:17] the Lost who can't be saved kind of this
[1:18] witness um in hell to those who are
[1:21] stuck and going to remain in Tribulation
[1:24] and as You Follow the uh the message and
[1:26] you continue to go forward in the
[1:27] message you'll find that he said that
[1:28] the third pull is to to the totally lost
[1:30] to the bride and to the church and so he
[1:32] sees this uh he sees as time goes on how
[1:36] God is fulfilling his word and
[1:38] interpreting his word by bringing it to
[1:39] pass and we're looking at when we say A
[1:42] Place full of Mercy we're looking at
[1:44] even ourselves being Merc full in a time
[1:46] of judgment that if we're looking at a
[1:49] time when the word has been made plain
[1:51] and we see the plainness of the word of
[1:53] God and we see the standard of the word
[1:54] of God and we see that God hasn't
[1:56] watered down Holiness and we see that he
[1:58] hasn't watered down the message and a
[2:00] lot of different ways then we ought to
[2:02] be merciful in this time of judgment
[2:04] because it is a a terrible day it is a
[2:07] very dark day and then also not that we
[2:10] would just be merciful but that even we
[2:12] ourselves and those that need it can
[2:13] find Mercy in this time that we're
[2:16] living in now and it's so good to know
[2:18] that Ephesians chapter 2:4 tells us but
[2:20] God who is rich in Mercy for his great
[2:23] love wherewith he loved us he's Rich
[2:26] that means he's abounding in Mercy that
[2:28] means kindness and good will
[2:30] and so he abundantly supplies Mercy if
[2:33] you ever ask is is is Mercy over just
[2:36] remember God's rich in Mercy and he
[2:38] abundantly supplies mercy and one of the
[2:40] things I've been thinking about is just
[2:41] all the scriptures his mercy endureth
[2:43] forever so if there is a mercy that's
[2:46] over it's not that there's no more Mercy
[2:49] whatsoever at all because God is rich in
[2:51] Mercy but it's understanding that God at
[2:54] one time who may have addressed
[2:55] something a certain way as the age
[2:57] changes he gives a message that holds us
[2:59] account accountable and so God rich in
[3:02] Mercy his mercies are renewed every
[3:03] morning this is something about the
[3:05] nature of God and his Mercy where where
[3:07] he is rich in it and he abundantly
[3:09] supplies this Mercy brother Brandon when
[3:12] he preaches God rich in Mercy right here
[3:14] in Phoenix it was in January of 1965 I'd
[3:17] encourage you to go listen to that he
[3:19] says if he was just rich in money if he
[3:21] was just rich in materials which he is
[3:23] but yet the greatest thing is being rich
[3:25] in Mercy that's wonderful I guess from
[3:28] our standpoint and our Vantage Point uh
[3:31] if he's rich in money if he's rich in
[3:33] materials that's wonderful that's great
[3:35] and he owns a cattle on a thousand hills
[3:37] but what's most important to us and the
[3:39] greatest thing is that he's rich in
[3:41] Mercy it's by his Mercy that we'll be
[3:44] able to participate in those things that
[3:46] he owns in verse five even when we were
[3:49] dead in sin so God was rich in Mercy and
[3:52] even when we were dead in sins hath
[3:54] quickened us together with Christ by
[3:56] Grace he are saved and hath raised us up
[3:59] together and made us sit together in
[4:01] Heavenly places in Christ Jesus Paul
[4:04] says we were dead in sins and that
[4:06] should alert us to the consequence for
[4:08] sin and Justice required death for sin
[4:12] and us being dead in sins that means
[4:14] we're sentenced to death uh we Face
[4:16] Eternal damnation but being merciful god
[4:20] offered a substitute for us find in a
[4:23] different places where brother Adam uses
[4:25] this scripture in Ephesians Chap 2:4 and
[4:27] he says but God rich in Mercy when we
[4:29] were dead in sins and he's creating this
[4:32] image of uh of being sentenced and being
[4:35] punished and death hanging over us he
[4:36] said he offered a substitute for us and
[4:40] he it goes through how in the Old
[4:42] Testament there was the offering of BL
[4:43] the blood of bulls and goats and that
[4:45] was a substitute for that time but then
[4:47] he says Jesus Christ was our substitute
[4:50] he is the Bible says our perpetuation
[4:52] which is Mercy Seat he is our
[4:55] atonement he is our substitute uh the
[4:59] word God requires death for sin and
[5:02] since there had to be the payment of
[5:03] death for sin we sh ought to die for our
[5:06] sins eternally the second death we ought
[5:09] to be vanquished because of our sins
[5:10] forever but Christ becomes the
[5:13] substitute the substitute death for
[5:15] these
[5:16] sins now do you get the
[5:19] Paradox God rich in Mercy and he's going
[5:22] to demonstrate his Mercy by saying my
[5:24] son my only begotten son why don't you
[5:26] die and and we're over here saying oh
[5:28] what mercy and and the sacrifice is
[5:30] saying
[5:31] Mercy but it's a paradox how that Mercy
[5:35] was shown in judging his own son sin was
[5:39] judged in his own son and sin being
[5:41] judged right there on the mercy seat
[5:43] right there in Christ that perpetuation
[5:45] it was Mercy to us and so there is this
[5:47] Paradox when it comes to the Penalty and
[5:50] the judgment and the mercy and the
[5:52] justice but yet we know that though we
[5:54] were dead in sins Christ becomes that
[5:56] substitute and it demonstrates his Mercy
[5:59] to us so that verse 7 that in the ages
[6:02] to come he might show the exceeding
[6:05] Riches of his grace in his kindness
[6:07] toward us through Christ Jesus recognize
[6:10] how there is this forward movement this
[6:13] trajectory where we are saved and as
[6:15] he's talking to the believer here who
[6:18] has been baptized by one Spirit into the
[6:20] body of Christ so this isn't a question
[6:23] of Salvation in verse se s he's saying
[6:25] that we who are sealed into the body of
[6:27] Christ we who have been saved as we have
[6:29] been and those of us who have
[6:30] experienced this Rich Mercy he has done
[6:33] this that he wouldn't just be done with
[6:34] us but he would show the exceeding
[6:37] Riches of his grace in his kindness
[6:39] through Christ Jesus so there is a
[6:42] Salvation and then there's a continued
[6:44] uh Grace there's a continued kindness
[6:47] that can be shown to us through Christ
[6:49] Jesus to show it's he showed mercy so
[6:53] that he can continually Supply Grace and
[6:55] kindness abundantly so his Mercy opens
[6:58] up to us this relationship where he can
[7:01] continually Supply Grace in his
[7:04] kindness so it's God who is rich in
[7:07] Mercy and this this dis uh God is a God
[7:11] of Justice and Justice required death
[7:14] and so God in his Mercy brought a
[7:15] substitute and we are beneficiaries of
[7:18] that I want you to see that this is
[7:21] Jesus Christ who then becomes the
[7:23] Judgment he he he represents the
[7:25] Judgment in Acts 17: 30 and 31 a very
[7:29] important scripture to be uh looking at
[7:32] in light of the end times he says in the
[7:34] times of this ignorance God winked at
[7:37] but now commandeth all men everywhere to
[7:39] repent and I'm not so much focusing on
[7:42] what he's referencing here because
[7:43] obviously he at the time of this
[7:45] ignorance so he's looking at something
[7:46] past but now there is a Commandment that
[7:48] all men everywhere must repent why
[7:51] because verse 31 he hath appointed a day
[7:54] in the which he will judge the world in
[7:56] righteousness by that man whom he hath
[7:58] ordained who is that man he's going to
[8:02] judge the World by Jesus Christ because
[8:04] he says whereof he hath given Assurance
[8:05] un all men in that Heath raised him from
[8:08] the dead so God is going to judge the
[8:11] world not by denomination not by your
[8:13] opinion not by your experience but we
[8:15] are all going to be judged he judges the
[8:17] World by the word which is Jesus Christ
[8:19] he has appointed a day in which he's
[8:21] going to judge the world in
[8:22] righteousness by Christ Jesus so Christ
[8:26] is uh there's these different uh as ects
[8:29] to Christ these different attributes of
[8:31] the word of God expressed in Christ and
[8:33] he's going to judge by Jesus Christ in
[8:37] Psalms
[8:38] 85:10 you'll recognize some of these
[8:40] scriptures as review from Wednesday
[8:41] night but it speaks of Jesus Christ This
[8:44] Is A Prophecy of the Messiah mercy and
[8:46] Truth are met together and peace have
[8:49] kissed righteousness and peace have
[8:52] kissed each other remember how brother
[8:53] Brandon begins to talk about heaven and
[8:55] earth kissing and embracing at the
[8:57] baptism of Christ at the Jordan River
[8:59] mercy and Truth are met together
[9:01] righteousness and peace have kissed each
[9:03] other and then this beautiful expression
[9:06] truth shall spring out of the earth
[9:08] truth is going to rise up out of the
[9:10] earth and righteousness shall look down
[9:12] from heaven and there's this meaning of
[9:14] righteousness and Truth this mercy and
[9:17] Truth uniting righteousness and peace
[9:19] kissing each other this is Christ the
[9:22] pritu The Mercy Seat the atonement the
[9:25] substitute in Christ is Judgment in
[9:28] Christ there's Justice in Christ uh
[9:30] there's Mercy because in Christ there is
[9:32] truth
[9:34] am in Psalms 98:9 and then continuing
[9:38] into the next chapter verse one before
[9:40] the Lord for he cometh to judge the
[9:43] Earth which with righteousness shall he
[9:46] judge the world and the people with
[9:49] Equity this is what God is this is the
[9:51] only way he could do it you say well
[9:53] God's going to judge with with
[9:54] righteousness and with Equity he can do
[9:57] it no other way other words God can't
[9:59] judge with unrighteousness he can't
[10:01] judge with inequity God judges you just
[10:03] have to accept it that God being the God
[10:05] of All is fair in his judgments true and
[10:08] right and just he is and and then
[10:11] chapter 99 verse1 the Lord reth let the
[10:14] people tremble he sth between the
[10:17] cherubims let the Earth be moved now
[10:20] he's judging and it says here where is
[10:22] he judging from where where is this
[10:25] judgment going forth where is it that
[10:27] he's going to judge the world and the
[10:28] people with equity he gives this image
[10:30] of where he sits where he dwells as it
[10:33] says in Exodus 25: 21 and 22 Thou shalt
[10:37] put the mercy seed above upon the ark
[10:39] and the Ark in the ark Thou shalt put
[10:41] the testimony that I shall give thee and
[10:44] there I will meet with thee this is the
[10:46] meeting place this is where he sits this
[10:48] where he dwells and I will commune with
[10:50] thee from Above The Mercy Seat from
[10:53] between the two cherubims which are upon
[10:55] the Ark of the testimony of all things
[10:57] which I will give thee in Comm commment
[10:59] unto the children of Israel there's all
[11:02] these elements of the wood and the gold
[11:04] and the the ark which it is comprised of
[11:06] that and then the mer uh the tablets the
[11:08] law that's put inside there and all
[11:10] these different elements are speaking
[11:12] something about the totality of this
[11:14] place of dwelling this house of the Lord
[11:16] this Tabernacle and so in the scripture
[11:19] when it speaks of a tabernacle though
[11:20] there's different elements there's times
[11:22] when it's speaking very specifically
[11:24] about his Tabernacle where he dwells not
[11:27] an outer court or an inner court but in
[11:29] there in that I didn't even I didn't
[11:31] notice Asher was sitting there too I
[11:32] only called out Avio but Asher's on the
[11:34] front row too so God bless these young
[11:36] men so attentive and I apologize for the
[11:39] slight there to don't take it out on me
[11:42] later don't leave me a bad review on
[11:46] Google and and so he's saying that this
[11:48] this is where when he refers to time
[11:50] it's a specific place at times where God
[11:52] is dwelling there between the two
[11:54] cherubs where is this it's The Mercy
[11:56] Seat I come to judge the Earth and with
[11:58] righteous n and with equity and it says
[12:00] he sits between the cherubs where is he
[12:03] he's there above the ark above upon the
[12:05] mercy seat this is where he dwells this
[12:08] is where his Justice is going to go
[12:09] forth this is where his judgment's going
[12:11] to go forth but yet it's still a mercy
[12:14] seat and Psalms 89:14 it says justice
[12:17] and judgment are the habitation of thy
[12:20] Throne mercy and Truth Shall go before
[12:22] thy face the preparation the foundation
[12:25] of his throne of his reign of his rule
[12:27] of his power is Justice the foundation
[12:31] of his power is
[12:33] Judgment the justice and habitation are
[12:35] the Habit Justice and judgment are the
[12:38] habitation of thy Throne mercy and Truth
[12:40] Shall go before thy face this place of
[12:43] judgment must be just must be just must
[12:47] be TR right it must be true it cannot be
[12:50] Wicked but from this place of judgment
[12:53] it says mercy and truth will go forth
[12:56] What Goes Forth will not be unjust what
[12:58] goes un forth will not be
[13:01] unmerciful we need to catch that God
[13:04] cannot be
[13:05] unmerciful cuz he's full of
[13:07] mercy and and I know maybe again this is
[13:10] the Paradox that when God judges it's
[13:12] still there's still Mercy that's has
[13:14] been
[13:16] expressed so this Justice and judge are
[13:19] the habitation of his throne and maybe
[13:21] what we would expect to come forth is
[13:23] Judgment alone but it's mercy and truth
[13:25] that goes for forth from this place I
[13:29] read where it was said that God's
[13:31] principal characteristic or his
[13:33] principal glory is in Justice in equity
[13:36] mercy truthfulness and and faithfulness
[13:39] this is God's principal Glory it's this
[13:42] is what makes him who he is his
[13:44] truthfulness his faithfulness is justice
[13:47] as we read Wednesday night Proverbs 21:3
[13:49] to do justice and judgment is more
[13:51] acceptable to the Lord than sacrifice we
[13:54] can just start making a list
[13:55] scripturally of what God accepts above
[13:58] sacrifice
[13:59] offerings and sacrifices I don't want
[14:01] that but but a body thou Hast prepared
[14:03] for me and a and to obey is better than
[14:06] sacrifice and here to do justice and
[14:08] judgment is more acceptable to the Lord
[14:10] than
[14:11] sacrifice this is something that is part
[14:14] of God's principal glory and one of the
[14:17] things that we labored to express on
[14:19] Wednesday night is that truth is
[14:21] associated with
[14:22] Justice and Truth is associated with
[14:26] Mercy in Isaiah 59:14 and judgment is
[14:29] turned away backward and Justice
[14:30] standeth a far off why is there no
[14:33] judgment why is there no justice for
[14:35] truth is Fallen truth has fallen in the
[14:38] street and Equity cannot enter where
[14:40] there is no truth there cannot be
[14:42] fairness and since fairness cannot enter
[14:44] there's no judgment or
[14:46] Justice right no justice no peace is
[14:49] what the the Mantra is but without truth
[14:52] there cannot be Justice unless you lift
[14:55] up truth and acknowledge truth and and
[14:58] and identify by truth you cannot have
[15:01] equity and without Equity there cannot
[15:03] be proper judgment without Equity there
[15:05] cannot be proper justice justice is as
[15:08] we read before or we said before truth
[15:10] in
[15:11] action and there is no virtue so truly
[15:14] great and Godlike as
[15:17] justice so this Justice this judgment is
[15:21] Christ it's going to judge the World by
[15:23] Jesus Christ and judgment and justice
[15:26] but mercy and Truth are met together in
[15:28] Christ
[15:30] in Christ if we could just use these as
[15:33] uh the two different ways that we want
[15:35] to express this judgment which we might
[15:37] think well judgment that's the the final
[15:38] sentence that's the punishment that's
[15:40] the repayment the reward for doing
[15:42] Wicked and then there's Mercy wherein
[15:45] there is some exemption from the
[15:48] Judgment but they both have to come from
[15:50] the same place we're not going to find
[15:53] Mercy outside of Jesus Christ you're not
[15:55] going to find judgment outside the word
[15:57] which is Christ but whether it be Mercy
[16:00] or whether it be judgment both are
[16:03] Equitable both are just both are
[16:08] right now as we've been looking at Luke
[16:12] 17:30 or Luke chapter 17 as it was in
[16:15] the days of lot and the days of Noah and
[16:17] Wednesday night we were looking
[16:19] specifically at Genesis Chapter 18 I
[16:21] want to jump right into this and
[16:23] hopefully go a little bit further in the
[16:26] days of lot we could recognize also in
[16:28] the days of Noah that it was a time of
[16:30] judgment and in the judging of Sodom and
[16:33] Gomorrah in in Genesis Chapter 18
[16:36] there's judgment to Sodom but at the
[16:38] same time there's truth to Abraham at
[16:40] the very same time that God is with
[16:43] Abraham and communing with him and
[16:45] making himself known to him and even
[16:47] lingering back with Abraham there's
[16:49] judgment that's been investigated and
[16:51] judgment coming to Sodom so the Lord is
[16:54] revealing himself to Abraham in sending
[16:56] judgment to the valley not this one but
[17:00] to the Sodom and Gomorrah and as God is
[17:05] sending these angels down into Sodom to
[17:07] see whether or not the wickedness is so
[17:10] and what if they are doing wickedly and
[17:12] it the language is used to express that
[17:14] God is going to punish them for their
[17:16] wickedness but if it's not if it doesn't
[17:18] remain Wicked or it's not as it seems if
[17:20] they're not as they seem they appear to
[17:22] be just wholly Wicked but if they turn
[17:23] out to be righteous God wouldn't judge
[17:25] them so God tells Abraham that thing
[17:29] which he's going to do and Abraham
[17:32] expresses Mercy himself in the time of
[17:35] judgment it's not that God was going to
[17:37] be unmerciful but the reality of the
[17:40] time and the day and the moment brought
[17:42] something out of Abraham and in verse 23
[17:45] of chapter 18 and Abraham Drew near and
[17:47] said wilt thou also destroy the
[17:49] righteous with the wicked so in what God
[17:51] had disclosed to him he understands and
[17:54] he's been taught he recognizes what's
[17:56] transpiring so he says per Adventure
[17:59] what if there's 50 righteous within the
[18:00] city will you destroy the whole city
[18:04] will you kill kill everyone and not
[18:06] spare the whole place for 50 righteous
[18:08] that are therein say if there's 50 could
[18:10] you just spare it all that be far from
[18:13] thee to do after this manner to slay the
[18:16] righteous with the Wicked This didn't
[18:18] offend God God didn't get all well since
[18:23] you say that take back my
[18:25] promise he's he likes the fact that
[18:28] there's something in Abraham that
[18:30] reflects this God who's rich in mercy
[18:32] God who is rich in Mercy says Abraham
[18:34] I'm going to destroy the valley and he's
[18:37] looking for something in Abraham and ab
[18:39] If Abraham
[18:41] said I knew it I knew I chose correct
[18:44] lot you got to come to you baby then
[18:47] that would have completely changed the
[18:48] whole
[18:49] picture but Abraham is instinctively
[18:51] saying no Lord this isn't like you to
[18:54] slay the righteous with the wicked and
[18:55] be the righteous and that the righteous
[18:57] should be as the wicked that that's far
[18:59] from thee and he says shall not the
[19:01] judge of all the Earth Do Right will not
[19:05] the judge of all the Earth do justice
[19:07] isn't his isn't his judgment and Justice
[19:10] based upon truth and because there's
[19:12] truth fairness and Equity can enter and
[19:15] because there that's the only way that
[19:16] you can have Justice and judgment he
[19:18] calls God to one of his uh essential
[19:22] characteristics he he's taking God at
[19:25] his word and holding God to his word and
[19:28] he is actually Abraham I want to use
[19:30] this very deliberately I want to use
[19:32] this phrase Abraham is
[19:34] interceding not that he can be the one
[19:37] that could pay the price oh I'll die for
[19:39] them not that he could be the one that
[19:41] could absolve them and make them
[19:42] righteous but he intercedes for those
[19:44] facing just
[19:46] judgment and in doing so he there's this
[19:50] element that he knew that Justice
[19:52] required
[19:53] warning that God's justice required
[19:56] truth first and that it would be the
[19:58] truth that could identify those whose
[20:00] Hearts were right that truth would be
[20:02] that which would call out the
[20:05] righteous and and something that is
[20:08] important to recognize with Abraham is
[20:10] that Abraham had received
[20:12] mercy and Abraham having received Mercy
[20:15] he gives Mercy Abraham perhaps was very
[20:18] aware of the fact that he was just one
[20:20] day lounging around in Babylon and God
[20:22] spoke to him he's like I was no
[20:25] different than all of my other Kinsmen I
[20:27] wasn't a better worshipper of God I
[20:29] didn't this wasn't something where I
[20:31] sought him and I was out looking for him
[20:33] because I knew there was a being greater
[20:34] than all these caldan deities no God
[20:37] just comes to him and he recognizes that
[20:39] was God being merciful to him and
[20:42] throughout his whole life and trajectory
[20:44] to this point in Genesis 18 we can say
[20:46] that Abraham recognizes even the prior
[20:49] events tell us that when he was able to
[20:51] go after these Kings and rescue his
[20:53] nephew God's always been gracious to him
[20:56] God has been merciful to him God has
[20:57] expanded his household so Abraham having
[21:01] received Mercy he gives
[21:03] mercy and brother brandham even uses the
[21:06] phrase in relation to in so much as
[21:08] you've given done unto the least of mine
[21:11] the least of these my own children uh
[21:13] you did it unto me and brother brandham
[21:16] said Mercy will be shown when mercy is
[21:19] given so when even when those who would
[21:22] not be elect extend a Mercy Mercy will
[21:27] be shown
[21:31] this response by Abraham is I I'll use
[21:35] this phrase was predicted by God in
[21:37] verse
[21:38] 19 and he says shall I hide this thing
[21:40] that I'm going to do from Abraham and he
[21:42] says for I know him that he will command
[21:45] his children and his household after him
[21:48] and they shall keep the way of the Lord
[21:51] to do justice and judgment that the Lord
[21:53] may bring upon Abraham that which Heath
[21:55] spoken of him God had made a promise and
[21:58] he knew that Abraham would guide his
[22:01] household correctly he would command not
[22:04] just his children but those in his
[22:05] household to keep the way of the Lord
[22:08] and to keep the way of the Lord it was
[22:10] necessary to do justice and judgment
[22:14] these are part of God's ways these are
[22:17] attributes of God Justice and judgment
[22:19] so he knew that Abraham would teach this
[22:24] this nature of God that he would command
[22:25] his children to do justice and judgment
[22:29] and it was God
[22:32] who revealed these things to Abraham and
[22:35] if I can say taught Abraham showed him
[22:38] these things Abraham in response would
[22:40] teach his children and in this very
[22:42] image as this patriarch in this fatherly
[22:44] figure the first thing we see him do is
[22:47] interceding for those who may be
[22:48] ignorant or those that don't know that
[22:50] judgment is
[22:51] coming now I want you I want to read
[22:54] these next two passages in Psalms and in
[22:56] the book of James chapter 3 to highlight
[23:00] this aspect of God's mercy he says the
[23:03] meek will he guide in judgment and the
[23:06] meek will he teach his way so there's
[23:08] certain character and disposition that
[23:10] God is going to guide in judgment he's
[23:12] going to instruct them and help them in
[23:13] Discerning in deciding the meek will he
[23:16] teach his way so there's this meekness
[23:18] that's required uh to be taught and to
[23:21] be trained and to understand and to be
[23:24] led in judgment all the paths of the
[23:27] Lord are mer mercy and truth so this is
[23:31] the path of the Lord all his paths are
[23:33] mercy and Truth unto such as keep his
[23:35] Covenant and his testimonies where you
[23:38] see a lack of mercy and where you see a
[23:40] lie or you see untruthfulness that is
[23:43] not a path of the Lord and that is not
[23:46] the evidence of one who's keeping God's
[23:47] covenant in testimony now we could say
[23:50] that he that keeps God's covenant in
[23:52] testimonies will be uh lavishly uh it'll
[23:55] be poured out upon them abundantly this
[23:58] mercy and truth and that's true that if
[24:01] if you are keeping his word if you're
[24:03] obedient if you're humbling himself to
[24:04] his word and you keep his Covenant
[24:06] testimonies then all his ways for you
[24:08] are mercy and Truth mercy and truth and
[24:11] then as Mercy is given Mercy is
[24:14] shown for thy name's sake oh Lord now
[24:16] here's kind of the response for thy
[24:17] name's sake oh Lord pardon my iniquity
[24:19] for it is great what man is he that
[24:22] fearth the Lord the one that fears the
[24:25] Lord him shall he teach in the way that
[24:27] he shall choose
[24:29] God's going to teach you he's going to
[24:30] instruct you the meek will he guide in
[24:32] judgment he will teach him his way the
[24:34] one that fears the Lord will be taught
[24:36] the ways of the Lord his soul shall
[24:38] dwell at ease this is this peaceful
[24:41] Peaceable habitation here's this quiet
[24:43] rest that God will give the believer and
[24:45] his seed shall inherit the earth Jesus
[24:48] said the meek shall inherit the earth
[24:50] here's the seed of the meek that he
[24:51] guides and judgment the meek will he
[24:53] teach his way and the meek being taught
[24:55] the way will do as Abraham did he will
[24:57] command his children
[24:59] so his seed shall inherit the earth the
[25:01] secret I love this scripture just
[25:03] meditate on chew on it a little bit more
[25:05] because I'm just glossing the secret of
[25:07] the Lord is with them that fear Him to
[25:10] those that fear the lord he will teach
[25:12] his way the secret Mysteries of the Lord
[25:14] the hidden things of God are with them
[25:17] that fear Him and He will show them his
[25:19] Covenant he's going to reveal the Deep
[25:22] things yay the hidden things he's going
[25:23] to open up the Mysteries the secret of
[25:25] the Lord is with them that fear Him and
[25:27] He will show them his Covenant it is
[25:30] expressed even of that as a wife who
[25:32] reverences his husband there is a
[25:34] covenant the bride has a covenant with
[25:36] God that is a secret there are things
[25:39] that she knows she experiences and
[25:41] blessings that are poured upon on her
[25:43] that cannot be poured out upon anybody
[25:45] else because the wisdom of God is to her
[25:47] and to her alone because the secret of
[25:49] the Lord is to them that fear him and he
[25:51] shows her his
[25:55] Covenant and all the paths of the Lord
[25:57] are mercy and Truth unto to
[25:59] her and so there's a teaching there's an
[26:01] instructing in this way of
[26:04] judgment and
[26:06] mercy in James chapter 3: 13 to1 18 I'm
[26:10] reading a a larger portion of this to
[26:12] get the full context of what he saying
[26:14] who is a wise man and endued with
[26:16] knowledge among you let him show out of
[26:19] a good conversation his works so there
[26:21] should be a life that is lived by one
[26:24] who claims to have wisdom and be endued
[26:26] with knowledge one of those things I
[26:29] think we could all uh admit that when it
[26:33] comes to accepting
[26:35] advice uh that we want to see that the
[26:37] person's kind of doing it
[26:39] themselves right could you imagine
[26:41] somebody's pedaling to you uh listen
[26:44] guys I I've never mentioned this before
[26:46] but I know an absolute sure cure for
[26:51] male P pattern boldness trust me on
[26:55] this right and you you
[26:58] when you plan on taking it right you go
[27:02] ahead
[27:03] first and then we'll and then we'll know
[27:05] whether or not This Thing Really Works
[27:06] and so there's something about a man's
[27:08] life his testimony his wife his children
[27:10] and I know that we we show grace even in
[27:12] those things that we're all growing and
[27:14] we're all learning but there's something
[27:15] to where you want to see a man who
[27:17] claims to have wisdom who claims to have
[27:20] knowledge you want to see his life
[27:22] demonstrate meekness of
[27:25] wisdom notice there is a meekness of
[27:28] wisdom there is and if I could even put
[27:30] it this way as we'll come to it one of
[27:32] the things that I've been studying in
[27:33] the scripture just myself is to find it
[27:35] is there's this thought that there is a
[27:37] there is a mercy that comes with wisdom
[27:40] and that wisdom necessarily carries with
[27:42] it some this element of wi of of Mercy
[27:46] wisdom must carry this element of mercy
[27:48] so that it it is in fact a wisdom and it
[27:52] says that let the man who says and
[27:54] claims to be a wise man endued with
[27:56] knowledge demonstrate a life that has
[27:59] the meekness of wisdom and he
[28:02] immediately begins to call out these
[28:03] characteristics that ought to be red
[28:05] flags but if you have bitter envy and
[28:07] and strife in your hearts Glory not and
[28:09] lie not against the truth there's your
[28:11] coming back to Mercy and truth if you
[28:13] have nothing but lies you're incapable
[28:16] of
[28:17] Mercy I if if you if you're not seeking
[28:20] truth if you're not Discerning truth if
[28:22] you're not a lover of truth you're
[28:24] incapable of this kind of mercy and
[28:26] you're certainly incapable of Justice
[28:28] right this wisdom descendeth not from
[28:31] above but is Earthly sensual devilish
[28:34] what a
[28:35] remarkable expression and that these
[28:37] things Rise Up from the earth and and it
[28:41] does not come from above but it's
[28:43] Earthly sensual and devilish and these
[28:45] very things that seem to be so closely
[28:46] related to human nature well what is
[28:49] Earthly sensual and devilish
[28:51] humans humans are and so this is the
[28:54] carnal nature and carnal wisdom and
[28:56] carnal thinking but the Bible said that
[28:58] there's going to be truth spring up out
[29:00] of the earth there's got to be vessels
[29:03] from which truth is going to spring up
[29:06] and it says that this wisdom descends
[29:07] not from above it's Earthly verse 16 for
[29:11] where envy and strife is there's
[29:12] confusion in every evil work as I've
[29:16] been studying in a sermon God rich in
[29:17] Mercy I believe it's in that place where
[29:18] he talks a lot about the chaos the chaos
[29:21] and confusion of things and the mercy of
[29:23] God where there's envy and in Strife
[29:25] it's chaos it's confusion in every evil
[29:27] work verse 17 but the wisdom which is
[29:29] from above this is Godly wisdom the
[29:33] wisdom that a man who's saying I'm wise
[29:35] and and I'm endued with knowledge from
[29:37] above he's going to demonstrate a life
[29:39] that has the meekness of this wisdom
[29:41] because the wisdom that is from above is
[29:45] first now we could read all these things
[29:47] and say well the wisdom from the above
[29:51] is
[29:52] gentle right so so that if there's ever
[29:57] wisdom that seems a little a little bit
[29:58] harsh and maybe punitive and corrective
[30:00] and it wants to um it wants to apply
[30:03] correction and maybe even if it would be
[30:05] you tell your children you're grounded
[30:06] or you spank a little one or something
[30:08] like that and say well that's clearly
[30:09] clearly not from above because that
[30:11] certainly wasn't gentle well it says
[30:13] it's
[30:15] first what is what is it what's the
[30:18] thing that ought to be now I'm just
[30:19] stepping on everyone's toes including my
[30:21] own what's the first instinct that
[30:24] should rise up in a moment of judgment
[30:26] what's the first instinct that would
[30:28] want to have in a time when you see
[30:29] something's incorrect or you're trying
[30:31] to make a decision our first instinct
[30:33] should be cut off the
[30:35] head right if if we were granted our
[30:38] first decision we'd be the only ones
[30:40] driving to work tomorrow
[30:41] morning like ah don't have to worry
[30:43] about traffic don't have to worry about
[30:45] anybody and you'd show up you'd have no
[30:46] job why because you cursed your
[30:48] boss right you have no co-workers at all
[30:52] why because you said I hope they meet an
[30:53] untimely end right your first instinct
[30:57] but he said that this wisdom is first
[31:00] pure then
[31:02] Peaceable gentle and easy to be
[31:05] entreated full of mercy and good fruits
[31:10] without partiality and without hypocrisy
[31:12] there there's your Justice there's your
[31:14] Equity there's when we were reading how
[31:16] uh Joseph Addison said Justice is blind
[31:20] because it cannot favor Kindred it
[31:21] cannot favor uh Associates it's got to
[31:24] be blind it goes by truth
[31:26] alone it's first pure and I'd like to
[31:29] say that part of this initial first
[31:31] fruits is that it's full of
[31:33] mercy and good fruits and the fruit of
[31:36] righteousness this Justice is sown in
[31:38] peace of them that make peace if we just
[31:41] took the word righteousness which uh I I
[31:44] hope we can see later that righteousness
[31:46] is connected with Mercy just this it's
[31:49] it's a it's a part of righteousness
[31:51] that's just inherent in it but the fruit
[31:54] of righteousness if we change that word
[31:55] righteousness to Justice the fruit of
[31:57] Justice
[31:58] correctness the just fruit of
[32:00] righteousness and Justice is sown in
[32:03] peace maybe it is no justice no peace
[32:07] fruit of righteous is swn in peace of
[32:08] them that make
[32:11] peace this is what Abraham was
[32:14] demonstrating this wisdom which was from
[32:17] Above This wisdom which was
[32:20] first uh seeking
[32:23] peace first seeking some exemption from
[32:26] judgment and it wasn't that the right
[32:29] the the wicked were being exempt but for
[32:31] the sake of the
[32:32] righteous so it wasn't that Abraham and
[32:34] I'll try to get into this maybe a little
[32:36] bit more on Wednesday or next Sunday on
[32:38] how righteous judgment and showing Mercy
[32:41] is not false
[32:43] discernment showing Mercy isn't like say
[32:45] looking at someone who is indeed guilty
[32:47] of adultery and saying well that's not
[32:49] really adultery is it right that that's
[32:53] not Mercy that's not truthful that
[32:56] that's not fair that's that's
[32:57] inequitable there's something wrong in
[32:59] that process and so showing Mercy isn't
[33:02] calling things wrong right you follow me
[33:06] we can't we can't uh get this wrong idea
[33:09] and concept of what Mercy is and so when
[33:11] Abraham interceded and when he stood up
[33:14] to to to call for God's
[33:18] uh to call for God's mercy or his
[33:20] Justice he said this isn't like you to
[33:22] destroy everybody he wasn't saying that
[33:24] the wicked didn't deserve it but he's
[33:25] saying certainly the righteous don't
[33:28] and he was saying why not spare the
[33:30] wicked for the sake of the the the
[33:33] righteous and exempt the wicked for the
[33:36] sake of the righteous because it
[33:37] wouldn't be fair that they would
[33:39] die and now let me transition
[33:43] to and I'm grateful that I have the time
[33:45] to get through this hopefully the time
[33:47] that we're living in right now Abraham
[33:50] was living in a time when the son of man
[33:53] was revealing himself to him judgment
[33:55] was going to come and fall upon those in
[33:58] Sodom and
[33:59] Gomorrah and we are living in the day
[34:02] when the son of man is being
[34:06] revealed and in this day judgment comes
[34:10] and mercy it's the part I want you to
[34:13] recognize that this this Mercy is I I
[34:16] think there is an aspect that's worth
[34:18] looking at to understand that if Mercy's
[34:21] over what does that mean so if I'm
[34:25] expressing and emphasizing the fact that
[34:27] I believe that there's still Mercy it's
[34:29] not done to try to correct in any way
[34:31] what brother bam said about Mercy being
[34:33] over but it's to understand according to
[34:37] the message of the hour what that meant
[34:40] I mean what what what was it that he's
[34:41] looking at so plainly for him to think
[34:43] could everybody be
[34:47] lost now in the sermon the Third
[34:51] Exodus and I think the dates of these
[34:53] that when he preaches this sermon is
[34:55] quite remarkable just to look at the
[34:58] progression of things that were
[34:59] happening in that that summer of 1963 in
[35:02] June 30th in the morning uh he's
[35:05] preaching the Third Exodus I'm realizing
[35:08] now there was uh a statement that I had
[35:10] from the sermon that he preached that
[35:11] evening uh that I took out of my notes
[35:13] but there's just this emphasis he has on
[35:16] that day he says we are in an
[35:19] exodus and leaving and turning the tapes
[35:21] off in a moment oh my friends my
[35:23] brothers both present and that will hear
[35:25] the tapes let me as your brother and a
[35:28] citizen of the kingdom of God now I know
[35:31] my me expressing this takes away a
[35:33] little bit of the the weight and the
[35:35] emphasis so I trust that you're
[35:36] listening to these things and reading
[35:37] these things yourself but it it might
[35:39] take away the sound and the urgency in
[35:41] brother Brandon's voice he says come out
[35:44] in this Exodus for all that's left
[35:47] behind will bear The Mark of the Beast
[35:49] come out of Babylon come out of this
[35:51] confusion come out of these systems and
[35:54] serve the Living
[35:55] God this great Ang Angel of the Covenant
[35:58] Jesus Christ in the form of God thought
[36:00] it not robbery but became equal with God
[36:03] now he's a pillar of fire in the same
[36:05] form that he was back there bringing
[36:07] that first Exodus bringing the second
[36:09] Exodus and here he is with the Third
[36:13] Exodus remember this important third
[36:16] here he is with us in the Third
[36:21] Exodus and he said come out of these
[36:23] systems come out of Babylon now let's
[36:26] pause for a moment and let's just say
[36:27] well these systems these denominations
[36:30] why is he calling them out of them
[36:33] now
[36:35] whether maybe just as a I wonder whether
[36:38] I should POS it as a question so I'll
[36:40] just say it as a statement there have
[36:42] been Believers in all ages in
[36:45] denominations right and there's
[36:47] believers who died in their Church their
[36:50] organized Church who believed the word
[36:52] for their day who accepted the gospel as
[36:54] it was preached to them but now there
[36:56] comes this really harsh message and this
[36:59] really Stern warning you've got to come
[37:01] out of it you've got to come out of
[37:04] these systems the first Exodus what did
[37:06] he do he brought them out of a natural
[37:07] land to a natural land the second Exodus
[37:10] he brought them out of a spiritual
[37:11] condition into a spiritual baptism of
[37:13] the Holy Ghost now he is bringing them
[37:17] from the spiritual baptism of the Holy
[37:19] Ghost right back into the Eternal land
[37:21] of the Millennium and the great
[37:22] Hereafter this is where we're this is
[37:24] what we're headed to next same Pillar of
[37:26] Fire by the same anointed system the
[37:29] same God doing the same things and the
[37:31] same word declared the first one
[37:33] declared the second one the same word
[37:35] declared the second one has declared the
[37:37] third one and here we see it Among
[37:41] Us The
[37:43] Exodus come out oh come out of this
[37:47] chaos this is a very clear delineation
[37:51] from things that have been to where now
[37:54] you've got to come out of this because
[37:57] now there's an exodus at one time that
[37:59] that Israel was serving God in the
[38:01] temple and worshiping and praising the
[38:03] Lord and and and there was a they had
[38:05] been in their Exodus they were in their
[38:07] promised land and all of a sudden it's
[38:08] like well we're here we're fine right
[38:10] it's like no now I want to take you a
[38:12] step higher now I want to take you out
[38:14] of the spiritual condition of being
[38:15] sinful into the spiritual baptism of the
[38:17] Holy Ghost and that was a time of Exodus
[38:19] the one who had baptized him with fire
[38:21] was there among
[38:23] them brother B said the same ones
[38:25] happening same things happening now come
[38:27] out oh come out of this chaos come to
[38:29] the Living God come to the
[38:30] word the word was made flesh and dwelt
[38:33] Among Us and now he's in our flesh dwell
[38:36] Among Us come out and serve the Living
[38:39] God I would say that there is none on
[38:42] Earth that can say it quite the way that
[38:44] he was saying it with the intensity and
[38:46] the urgency because he was anointed
[38:48] scripturally as a voice to call us out
[38:50] of
[38:51] Babylon Revelations 18:4 to6 says and I
[38:54] heard another voice from Heaven saying
[38:56] come out of her my people that you be
[38:59] not partakers of her sins that you
[39:02] receive not of her plagues this is a
[39:05] this is this is The
[39:06] Exodus that there's going to be plagues
[39:09] there's going to be judgments there's
[39:10] going to be curses and he said you've
[39:12] got to come out of her that you not
[39:14] receive that which she's going to be
[39:16] rewarded with for her sins have reached
[39:18] unto heaven and God ha remembered her
[39:21] iniquities reward her even as she
[39:23] rewarded you Mercy given Mercy shown
[39:28] he's going to remember her iniquities
[39:30] well where's the justice and where's the
[39:31] righteousness and where's the loving God
[39:33] full of
[39:35] compassion reward her even as she
[39:37] rewarded you and double unto her her
[39:39] double according to her works in the cup
[39:42] which she hath filled to her
[39:45] double God standing there in the Third
[39:48] Exodus saying that there's nothing left
[39:51] for judgment in these systems get out of
[39:53] them there's no life he told us there's
[39:56] no life in denominations that's a very
[39:57] harsh statement but that's that's the
[39:59] sum of what he's saying about
[40:01] denominations there's no life in there
[40:03] they cannot bring forth they only bring
[40:04] forth stebo children they only bring
[40:06] forth a a hybrid
[40:10] nature so he says come out of her my
[40:12] people the plagues are going to fall her
[40:16] sins are abounding come
[40:19] out brother B says we're in an exodus
[40:22] and the same God that declared the first
[40:23] declared the second he's declaring it
[40:25] now in that first
[40:34] Exodus let I check my scripture here for
[40:36] a
[40:54] second in Exodus 34: 5 to9
[41:10] says and the Lord descended in the
[41:13] cloud and stood with him there and
[41:15] proclaimed the name of the
[41:17] Lord and the Lord passed by before him
[41:20] and proclaimed now this is God showing
[41:23] himself to
[41:24] Moses and in Exodus chapter 3 it says
[41:27] the
[41:28] Lord himself had descended and appeared
[41:31] to Moses said I am come down to deliver
[41:36] this is the god in The Exodus he comes
[41:37] down to deliver to take them forth says
[41:39] the Lord descended in the cloud and
[41:41] stood with them there and proclaimed the
[41:42] name of the Lord the Lord passed by
[41:44] before him proclaimed the Lord the Lord
[41:45] God merciful and gracious longsuffering
[41:49] and abundant in goodness and Truth
[41:52] keeping Mercy for thousands forgiving
[41:55] iniquity and transgression and sin when
[41:58] God describes himself he's first
[42:01] merciful gracious longsuffering abundant
[42:04] in goodness which can be Mercy in places
[42:06] and Truth keeping Mercy for thousands
[42:08] forgiven iniquity and transgression and
[42:10] sin this is God even being merciful to
[42:13] them in the Exodus God coming down he's
[42:17] first gracious and merciful to Israel
[42:19] he's going to make himself known he's
[42:21] sending them a prophet he's give tell
[42:22] giving them a confirmation he's going to
[42:24] come out there's going to be plagues
[42:25] there's going to be things that are
[42:27] taking place but it's all for the
[42:28] purpose of bringing them out of Egypt
[42:29] and into the promised land and then God
[42:32] in this mid sentences says and that will
[42:34] by no means clear the guilty amen
[42:37] visiting the iniquity of the fathers
[42:38] upon the children upon the children's
[42:39] children to the third and to the fourth
[42:42] generation God is first merciful but he
[42:45] says that my Mercy is not without
[42:48] Justice am if there's maybe I could say
[42:51] it this way have you ever driven by a
[42:54] dry cleaner that says 20% off and it's
[42:56] like written on the
[42:58] window and you're like 20% off of what
[43:02] it's always 20% off so in other words
[43:05] the price is the price and they're just
[43:07] telling you it's 20% off and you go and
[43:09] say how much it's like $1.99 he's like
[43:11] well do I get the 20% off it's like that
[43:12] is the 20% off I've been coming here for
[43:14] 30 years you know right it's like I've
[43:16] never never seen a deduction of 20% it's
[43:18] only gone up and so if there's not and
[43:21] so there's is there 20% off if that's
[43:23] just what the price
[43:25] is and so is there Mercy if there's no
[43:28] punishment it's like well the soul that
[43:31] sinth enter into the joy of the
[43:34] Lord and they say enter in the J oh
[43:37] you're so merciful well no there's no
[43:39] punishment for it no consequence so God
[43:42] is saying I'm first merciful gracious
[43:44] loving I have this long suffering
[43:46] abundant in goodness and truth I keep
[43:47] Mercy for thousands I forgive iniquity
[43:49] and transgressions and sins he says but
[43:50] that will no means clear the
[43:52] guilty visiting the iniquity so I can
[43:56] forgive the iniquity and the
[43:57] transgressions but there's not a
[43:58] clearing of this guilt and I will visit
[44:01] iniquity there's something to say that
[44:03] my Justice requires Mercy but it also
[44:06] requires judgment amen it says and Moses
[44:09] made haste and bowed his head toward the
[44:11] Earth and worshiped so Moses was picking
[44:13] up what he was laying down he said if
[44:15] now I have found Grace in thy sight oh
[44:17] Lord let my Lord I pray thee go Among Us
[44:21] for it is a stiff necked people and
[44:23] pardon our iniquity and our sin and take
[44:26] us for thine
[44:28] inheritance possess us for yourself
[44:31] separate us out amen Mark us out from
[44:35] everyone else Lord be merciful unto us
[44:37] be gracious and it begins with this
[44:39] acknowledgement that we have sinned and
[44:41] that we are full of iniquity and we're
[44:43] stiff necked and
[44:45] rebellious he said I this is what his
[44:49] response is to this God he descended in
[44:51] the cloud and this meeting with Moses he
[44:53] said I am come down to deliver you to
[44:55] take you out of this land in that Exodus
[44:57] there was a leaving of Egypt through
[44:59] signs and wonders and plagues upon the
[45:01] unbelieving and he's bringing them out
[45:03] and Moses saying Lord pardon us have
[45:06] mercy on us take us for your possession
[45:09] separate us
[45:11] out very important characteristic of the
[45:14] taking and the and the calling forward
[45:17] and the separating out of the redeemed
[45:19] and how that he is gathering gather your
[45:22] possession to
[45:24] yourself now brother Brandon preached
[45:26] the Third Exodus there on June 30th
[45:29] 1963 and then on July
[45:32] 7th he preaches the
[45:35] indictment and at the beginning he uses
[45:38] the third basis or excuse me he uses the
[45:41] Third Exodus I played third Bas that was
[45:43] the reason for that slip uh he uses the
[45:47] Third Exodus as the basis
[45:50] for Christ them being indicted for uh
[45:53] rejecting Christ today the very
[45:56] beginning of the sermon in this Third
[45:57] Exodus and because we're in this Third
[45:59] Exodus because God is Among Us now
[46:01] calling us out of chaos he's using that
[46:03] as the basis for an indictment for
[46:05] rejecting Christ
[46:08] today and I would encourage you I I've
[46:11] been putting it together I may share it
[46:13] with you but I would encourage you to go
[46:14] watch the the sermon titles after the
[46:17] seals are open and I may have quickly
[46:18] referenced this before but you find that
[46:20] brother Bram doing a lot of warning
[46:24] inditing preaches the trial right
[46:27] there's things that he's doing and it's
[46:28] almost as if there's this sequential
[46:30] order through the litigation process of
[46:32] bringing us to a place to where now the
[46:33] judge is here and he's giving warning
[46:36] then he's given the indictment for
[46:37] rejecting and there's going to be a
[46:39] trial and so that's the time we're
[46:41] living in right now these are the things
[46:43] that's unfolding in the word of God I
[46:46] would say it's these things is one of
[46:48] the reasons why I believe it is so
[46:50] wonderful that God preserved for us the
[46:52] message of the hour amen and that we can
[46:55] go into it for ourselves and we can read
[46:57] it and it's not just one tape that's
[46:58] saved and it's not just one little quote
[47:00] in a golden nuggets book over here but
[47:02] we can take it and study it out for
[47:03] ourselves and see the totality of what
[47:05] the voice of God is declaring to us and
[47:09] brother brandham says in the indictment
[47:10] they did it because they didn't know who
[47:12] he was They Crucified him in his first
[47:14] coming because they didn't know who he
[47:15] was they didn't know that the
[47:17] Vindication of God's word was standing
[47:19] up in that day now it was it one day and
[47:23] that was right now we understand that in
[47:26] this sermon
[47:27] he's saying that they were worshiping
[47:30] under the law and it was right up until
[47:33] a critical moment absolutely right
[47:36] Jerusalem was in effect the law the
[47:39] ordinances the Commandments were all
[47:41] right and you could be absolutely
[47:42] Justified before God by keeping those
[47:45] Commandments until the time came that
[47:47] Christ is
[47:48] crucified and the the the temple and the
[47:51] Tabernacles exposed as not having the
[47:53] presence of God in there anymore there's
[47:56] no mercy seat but there's Christ hanging
[47:58] on the cross outside of the gates as the
[48:02] perpetuation as The Mercy Seat in plain
[48:05] view so he's saying at one time that was
[48:07] right it was it one day just keep them
[48:09] laws and things but the same laws that
[48:12] was they were keeping pointed them to a
[48:15] time that he would come and be this man
[48:18] that he was supposed to
[48:19] be notice how these things are even
[48:22] forward looking pointing to a day they
[48:25] had this part but did take the other
[48:28] part and that's the same thing they're
[48:31] doing now they got a church and they
[48:34] believe in Jesus Christ and say they do
[48:36] in things but deny the hour we're living
[48:38] in still brings the old proverb back
[48:41] again man always praising God for what
[48:43] he has done looking forward what he do
[48:46] and will do and ignoring what he's doing
[48:49] and being condemned by
[48:52] it so God's doing something there he is
[48:57] you're what you're doing before was okay
[49:01] and God was showing Mercy to you in that
[49:04] but now this pointed to this time and
[49:08] this day and here's where you'll find
[49:10] his Mercy but if you don't move you're
[49:16] condemned they think God is wonderful
[49:19] how great he is what he's doing going to
[49:22] do he's going to come and be a Rapture
[49:25] someday and go home and and denying the
[49:27] very signs and wonders right there at
[49:30] the time that the scripture says that he
[49:32] will be doing it Miss the whole
[49:37] thing
[49:38] denying the word denying the day denying
[49:42] the
[49:49] time there's a unfolding in these
[49:52] sermons as brother braham's preaching
[49:53] them you see this this message of the
[49:55] Third Exodus come out come out come out
[49:58] Christ is calling us out of these things
[50:00] and then he brings this indictment
[50:01] what's the indictment for not coming
[50:06] out in Malachi 4:
[50:11] 1-6 I think it's important that we
[50:13] recognize these aspects of this chapter
[50:15] for behold the day cometh that shall
[50:16] burn as an oven and the proud yay and
[50:19] all that do wickedly shall be stubble
[50:21] and the day that cometh shall burn them
[50:23] up sayith the Lord of host that it shall
[50:26] leave them neither root nor
[50:28] Branch there's going to be a burning of
[50:30] those that are gathered together this
[50:31] bundling together denominations and all
[50:33] these harlots they're going to be burned
[50:36] and at the very same time it presents
[50:38] this picture but unto you that fear my
[50:40] name shall the son of righteousness
[50:44] arise with healing in his wings and ye
[50:47] shall go forth and grow up as calves of
[50:50] the
[50:51] stall and ye shall tread down the wicked
[50:54] for they shall be ashes Under The Souls
[50:56] of your feet feet in the day that I
[50:58] shall do this sayith the Lord of hosts
[51:00] now this is quite a a
[51:04] representation this is quite an image
[51:06] that's being put before us the son of
[51:08] righteousness shall rise with healing in
[51:10] his wings there's going to be a day when
[51:11] there's going to be a burning and the
[51:13] wicked are going to be burned to stubble
[51:15] and they're going to be completely
[51:17] burned up but the son of righteousness
[51:19] will arise with healing in his wings for
[51:21] those that fear Him to those that fear
[51:24] me will I show them my secret Covenant
[51:27] to those that fear me will I teach them
[51:30] in judgment to those that fear me will I
[51:33] guide
[51:34] them it's the son of Justice the son of
[51:38] righteousness the Su n of righteousness
[51:40] is the s n of Justice he brings truth he
[51:44] brings healing you'll find over and over
[51:46] and over again where there's healing
[51:47] there's Mercy in order to have healing
[51:50] there must be mercy so he brings healing
[51:52] and what it happens at this time that
[51:54] truth comes it results in judgment J
[51:56] ment and burning to some but healing or
[51:59] Mercy to
[52:01] others it you'll find that this
[52:03] righteousness is connected with Mercy
[52:05] it's tied to
[52:07] Mercy Proverbs 21:21 he that followeth
[52:10] after righteousness and mercy findeth
[52:12] life righteousness and
[52:14] honor he that follows after
[52:17] righteousness and mercy finds life amen
[52:20] we can't just try to follow after
[52:21] Justice and judgment well it's in the
[52:23] word isn't it Jesus even says you've
[52:25] left off you've you've left off the
[52:27] weigh your matters of the law of justice
[52:29] and mercy he says you you ought to do
[52:32] both yeah do all these things and and
[52:35] the details that's great that's
[52:36] wonderful the minutia of things that's
[52:38] wonderful but if you leave off the
[52:39] nature and character of these other
[52:40] things that's not the right
[52:44] thing and in this time of judgment the
[52:47] day that comes that will
[52:48] burn the reason why he says but unto you
[52:50] that fear my name there's going to be a
[52:53] burning come and unto you that fear my
[52:55] name the Sun
[52:57] will arise it is the rising of the sun
[53:01] it's going to come in Revelations 10:1
[53:04] the mighty Angel his face was as it were
[53:06] the
[53:06] sun Revelations 10:1 the mighty Angel
[53:09] descends to Earth the Lord descending to
[53:12] Earth this Mighty Angel even according
[53:14] to Mark chapter 9 Matthew 17 this is the
[53:16] Lord Brother Bram said the seventh angel
[53:18] is on Earth at the time of this
[53:21] coming the seventh angel of Revelations
[53:23] 10:7 brother brandham says in the church
[53:25] age book Mo very very explicitly is the
[53:28] same Elijah in Malachi
[53:30] 4:5 so the son of righteousness arises
[53:33] with healing in his wings where's that
[53:35] healing it's in that word it's in that
[53:38] open book and so it says remember ye
[53:41] verse four brother John you may need to
[53:42] go back remember ye the law of Moses my
[53:44] servant which I commanded unto him in
[53:45] horb for all Israel with the statutes
[53:48] and
[53:49] judgments behold I will send you Elijah
[53:52] the prophet before the coming of the
[53:54] great and Dreadful day of the Lord and
[53:56] He Shall shall turn the heart of the
[53:57] fathers to the children and the Heart of
[53:59] the children to their fathers lest I
[54:00] come and smite the Earth with the
[54:03] curse as it was in the days of
[54:06] lot as it was in the days of lot when
[54:09] judgment is impending and there's going
[54:11] to be a burning up I will send the son
[54:13] of righteousness with healing in his
[54:14] wings but I'm not just going to send the
[54:16] son of righteousness there will be an
[54:17] Elijah that will forun there will be an
[54:19] angel Messenger on
[54:21] Earth and he will be the one that's
[54:23] going to point us to Christ am amen it's
[54:27] a time of
[54:28] judgment but it's a time of
[54:31] Mercy I I'm not sure what your
[54:35] experience may be I do know that there's
[54:36] some that actually uh hold somewhat
[54:41] closely to the teachings of the message
[54:42] would even identify themselves as
[54:44] message Believers and message ministers
[54:46] that very adamant that there is no more
[54:49] Mercy that the door of Salvation has
[54:50] been shut and even in doing so they're
[54:52] condemning their own loved ones but it's
[54:54] what they see in in the message and the
[54:56] very adamant very strong and harsh about
[54:58] it a very matter of fact about
[55:01] it and I could say that in some way to
[55:04] me I think that we ought not to water
[55:06] down the Judgment aspect of the time
[55:09] we're living in Brother The Razor's Edge
[55:12] we've been brought to the the the truth
[55:14] the line that has been drawn and this is
[55:16] the truth and come out of her and this
[55:18] is the word and you stay with what's
[55:19] been preached and I just think that we
[55:21] can't not get be guilty of watering down
[55:25] the urgency of the time in the hour that
[55:26] we're living in come on but I believe
[55:30] that if we can fully appreciate what's
[55:33] transpired in the day and age that we're
[55:35] living in and we can see that God is
[55:38] here in in his word in the bride and and
[55:41] he's calling us out he says that he's
[55:43] he's he he's here amongst us and and
[55:46] we're being called out of Babylon we're
[55:48] being called out of denominations I just
[55:49] feel there's so much I'd like to express
[55:51] about the message of the hour that's
[55:53] bundling denominations and he's calling
[55:55] judgment upon and even see judgment is
[55:57] striking during the time of brother br's
[55:59] Ministry and there's this urgency and it
[56:00] shakes
[56:02] us to our people even though my my own
[56:05] my parents and their friends and even a
[56:07] lot of people that we would know to this
[56:10] day and and Flagstaff and everyone were
[56:12] there in California listening to
[56:14] choosing of a bride and what they do
[56:16] they
[56:17] left they absolutely left California why
[56:21] they believed in the urgency of the
[56:23] message of the hour fellowship with
[56:25] Brother Joseph and he's going to be
[56:27] driving to Virginia in the next week or
[56:29] so and I said man you've got to go to
[56:30] the Pacific Ocean so you can go all the
[56:32] way and visit the Atlantic Ocean you
[56:33] could do it all in the same month and La
[56:36] was suggested as a possibility there's
[56:38] some good burgers there and good food
[56:39] and everything he's like would we really
[56:40] want to go to the place that's going to
[56:41] sink in the bottom of the ocean I say
[56:43] you know what there's some appreciation
[56:45] of the fact that it's very real what the
[56:47] prophet taught that there's consequences
[56:49] for not being sensitive to the word of
[56:51] God and so I would not want to in any
[56:54] way water down judgment and justice
[56:56] Justice and
[56:57] truth but listen to brother Brandon when
[56:59] he preaches the God of this evil age now
[57:01] there is a sermon to really burn hide
[57:04] right just let them and when it gets
[57:05] down to the end brother bradam say fire
[57:07] fall burn them all and here he is
[57:10] praying at the end dear Jesus don't let
[57:11] one of them be
[57:13] lost as your servant that stands between
[57:16] the living and the dead poting them with
[57:18] the finger to the word of
[57:20] God this no notice what he's doing
[57:23] preaches the God of this evil age he's
[57:25] identifying
[57:26] hell is on
[57:28] Earth it's going that the judgments have
[57:30] they've already been marked for judgment
[57:33] he's already felt the urgency of the
[57:35] Fulfillment of the word of God in this
[57:36] last day of Revelations 55 Revelations
[57:38] 10:1 Luke 17:30 the coming of the son of
[57:41] man the revealing of the son of man
[57:42] these things are have so shaken him that
[57:46] he's very he's very deliberate in what
[57:48] he's saying he's also very careful not
[57:49] to say too
[57:52] much and he recognizes the time that
[57:54] we're living in he's overwhelmed with
[57:56] this as your servant that stands between
[57:57] the living and dead pointing them with
[57:59] the finger to the word of the Lord he's
[58:00] saying Lord don't let them be lost I
[58:02] cannot save them
[58:04] Lord but they want to be
[58:06] saved and father as I have said many
[58:09] times the sun rises in the morning and
[58:12] it comes up across the Earth it's sent
[58:15] by God to ripen the grain to make
[58:17] natural food for natural living but oh
[58:20] God you said to them that fear his name
[58:23] shall the son of righteousness rise with
[58:25] heal in his
[58:27] wings let the son of righteousness the
[58:29] word of God rise in the hearts of the
[58:31] people and the healing rise of faith in
[58:34] that word cure every disobedient to the
[58:36] word and bring them to the fullness of
[58:39] the Sons and Daughters of God and you
[58:42] shall go forth
[58:44] amen and and and and grow as calves in
[58:49] the
[58:51] stone you shall grow up you go forth and
[58:54] grow up in the son of rightous let it
[58:56] now rise in the hearts of the people
[58:57] with healing
[58:59] raise this is the day this is the time
[59:01] that we're living in there's brother
[59:02] brandham standing there even as an
[59:04] Abraham saying oh Lord don't condemn
[59:06] them all don't Lord don't let any one of
[59:08] them be
[59:09] lost Psalms 9: 7 and9 but the Lord shall
[59:13] endure forever his Mercy shall endure
[59:16] Forever The Truth Shall endure forever
[59:19] these things that his righteousness will
[59:20] endure forever why because the Lord will
[59:23] endure forever he hath prepared preped
[59:26] his throne for judgment and the judgy
[59:29] said
[59:31] yeah and he shall judge the world in
[59:34] righteousness he shall Minister judgment
[59:36] to the people in uprightness it's kind
[59:39] of a it's a real some heavy tones there
[59:41] but I think we know enough already to
[59:43] know that he's prepared his throne for
[59:44] judgment because it's the preparation of
[59:46] it the foundation of his Justice it is
[59:49] Judgment he's going to judge the world
[59:50] in righteousness he's not going to judge
[59:52] us in unrighteousness he's going to
[59:53] minister judgment to the People In
[59:55] fairness and uprightness and Equity this
[59:57] is what God must do and as a part of
[1:00:00] that verse 9 the Lord also will be a
[1:00:02] refuge for the oppressed and a refuge in
[1:00:05] times of trouble what Mercy what
[1:00:09] glorious Grace that's being expressed a
[1:00:12] refuge that's a secure high
[1:00:14] place inaccessibly high is the word that
[1:00:17] it's being rooted in that's uh he's
[1:00:19] going to give him a refuge it's
[1:00:20] inaccessibly high it's a stronghold for
[1:00:23] the
[1:00:24] broken God having pity having Mercy on
[1:00:28] the broken and we who are broken we've
[1:00:30] sinned our Brokenness is as a result of
[1:00:33] sin it's been our own stiff neck
[1:00:34] Rebellion there's things that we've done
[1:00:36] but yet the Lord will be a refuge for
[1:00:38] the
[1:00:39] oppressed he will be a hiding place for
[1:00:42] those who find themselves in trouble in
[1:00:45] this time of judgment and it's very
[1:00:47] fiery round about the Lord he's
[1:00:48] revealing himself as a wigged one as a
[1:00:51] lion he'll still be a refuge for the
[1:00:54] broken in Isaiah 2 1:2 we were reading
[1:00:57] these about the book being open and the
[1:00:58] eyes of the blind being open the tongue
[1:01:01] of the stammer being loose to speak
[1:01:02] plainly a king shall reign in
[1:01:04] righteousness and princes shall rule in
[1:01:06] judgment and a man shall be as a hiding
[1:01:10] place from the wind and a covert from
[1:01:12] The Tempest as rivers of water in a dry
[1:01:14] place as the shadow of a great rock in a
[1:01:17] weary land amen remember we ministered
[1:01:19] on these very same principles in the
[1:01:20] very beginning on a place by him there's
[1:01:24] this place that we can have
[1:01:26] I can't remember exactly maybe even what
[1:01:28] the title was but it was spec specifying
[1:01:30] this place he's going to be a covert a
[1:01:33] secret place of
[1:01:34] protection the one provided place of
[1:01:38] Mercy at a time of reigning and
[1:01:40] righteousness a time of ruling in
[1:01:42] judgment a man is going to be a hiding
[1:01:44] place a covert the shadow of a great
[1:01:48] rock in a weary
[1:01:49] land brother brandham uses this
[1:01:52] scripture Psalms 27 when he preaches the
[1:01:54] Rapture his text is Psalms 27 1:5 and
[1:01:57] what does he say I'm not going to go
[1:01:59] down Main Avenue I know a lot of people
[1:02:01] are thinking Main Street but I'm going
[1:02:03] to go to a prophecy of it and he says
[1:02:05] for in the time of trouble he reads this
[1:02:07] verse 5 for in the time of trouble he
[1:02:09] shall hide me in his Pavilion the Lord
[1:02:11] will be a refuge for the oppressed a
[1:02:14] refuge in times of trouble in the time
[1:02:16] of trouble he shall hide me in his
[1:02:18] Pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle
[1:02:21] shall he hide me he shall set me up Upon
[1:02:25] a
[1:02:26] rck now I would love to go into a little
[1:02:29] bit more detail on
[1:02:31] this but I want you to ponder the image
[1:02:33] that David is just painted enemies
[1:02:35] surround him they threaten him even if
[1:02:39] the walls were being sieged and all of
[1:02:42] Jerusalem is being compassed what David
[1:02:44] is saying is if I have to
[1:02:47] retreat pass the outer Court past the
[1:02:50] inner Court he will take me into the
[1:02:54] very secret of his t Tabernacle and hide
[1:02:57] me the secret of his presence where was
[1:02:59] his presence between the
[1:03:01] cherubs he's not just saying in the
[1:03:03] temple you know looking out the door out
[1:03:05] in the outer Court you everybody fist
[1:03:06] bumping there said I think we're going
[1:03:07] to be safe no he said I want to go all
[1:03:09] the way in He Shall Set me upon a
[1:03:14] rock what is it that they believed maybe
[1:03:17] they knew and experienced then is that
[1:03:18] in the temple the very Ark was set upon
[1:03:20] the rock of Creation The Creation Stone
[1:03:23] the foundation stone David's not just
[1:03:25] talking about going to church David is
[1:03:27] not just talking about the glory of the
[1:03:28] Lord filling all the temple and the
[1:03:30] outer court and the inner Court David is
[1:03:32] talking about God bringing him all the
[1:03:33] way into the holiest of holies and
[1:03:35] allowing him his protection if all else
[1:03:38] fails I know that the Lord will hide me
[1:03:41] between the cherubims he'll hide me upon
[1:03:44] the mercy seat in a time of
[1:03:51] trouble in
[1:03:54] Exodus God said to Moses just in the
[1:03:57] chapter before he said that he had
[1:03:58] descended said I'm keeping Mercy for
[1:04:01] thousands and he expressed these things
[1:04:02] to Moses he said there's a place by me
[1:04:05] and thou shalt stand upon a
[1:04:07] rock and this was in response to Moses
[1:04:09] saying Show Me Your Glory and God said I
[1:04:12] will make all my goodness pass before
[1:04:14] thee and I will proclaim the name of the
[1:04:16] Lord before thee and will be gracious to
[1:04:19] whom I'll be gracious and will show
[1:04:21] Mercy on whom I will show Mercy where
[1:04:24] does he where does he where does does he
[1:04:25] show it in the place by
[1:04:28] him in that place upon a
[1:04:37] rock I believe there's room for mercy in
[1:04:39] this
[1:04:40] hour as a matter of fact I believe
[1:04:42] there's a place full of
[1:04:45] it not just not just room like well can
[1:04:49] we fit anything else in there well I
[1:04:51] think we can just shove a little Mercy
[1:04:52] in there no there's a place full of it
[1:04:55] a place that it's very characteristic is
[1:04:57] called The Mercy Seat the throne room
[1:05:00] the presence of God where he
[1:05:03] dwells brother BR preaches a sermon God
[1:05:06] doesn't call man to judgment without
[1:05:08] first warning him I'm going to close on
[1:05:10] this lengthy quote I've provided it for
[1:05:12] you in the slides July 24th
[1:05:15] 1963 think of this he's preached the
[1:05:17] indictment he's going to preach the
[1:05:18] trial and he's saying I'm not going to
[1:05:19] judge without first
[1:05:21] warning these things are all coming down
[1:05:23] you know you familiar with criminal law
[1:05:25] enough to know I mean hopefully from an
[1:05:26] educational standpoint right I'm asking
[1:05:28] for a friend but in criminal law an
[1:05:30] indictment precedes
[1:05:33] trial and an indictment is like the
[1:05:35] formal charges there could be
[1:05:37] investigations but when you when you see
[1:05:39] this indictment that means you're being
[1:05:40] charged you're going to have to face uh
[1:05:43] uh you're going to have to face these
[1:05:45] charges that you're going to go through
[1:05:47] a process of of litigation and maybe
[1:05:49] stand
[1:05:50] trial so brother brandham even in the
[1:05:53] way that he's preaching this it makes a
[1:05:54] lot of sense
[1:05:56] in terms of uh of how we're living in
[1:05:59] this time and in this hour so he's
[1:06:00] saiding God doesn't call him into
[1:06:01] judgment without first warning him this
[1:06:04] is the very characteristic that brother
[1:06:06] that Abraham
[1:06:07] identified like what if there's ignorant
[1:06:10] people down there in Sodom who don't
[1:06:11] know better and would and would receive
[1:06:14] your word and would receive your truth
[1:06:15] that would make them
[1:06:18] righteous and then God listen brother
[1:06:21] says I'm just jumping right in the
[1:06:22] middle of it because it's this image of
[1:06:23] Genesis 18 I was going to use on
[1:06:25] Wednesday I believe he says but then God
[1:06:27] confirms that message that Billy G
[1:06:29] Graham preaches God heals the Sick by
[1:06:32] Oral Robert's prayers and God produces
[1:06:35] the things that proves that Jesus Christ
[1:06:37] is the same yesterday today and forever
[1:06:39] and it's calling those things that it's
[1:06:42] messages of the
[1:06:45] hour and one of those messages is
[1:06:47] calling repent or perish that's right
[1:06:49] repent or perish there's no hopes it's
[1:06:52] all gone world's warned of his coming
[1:06:55] each one of the messages speaks and
[1:06:56] warns of the coming to Lord Jesus both
[1:06:58] to the church denominal remember God's
[1:07:00] always in threes like Father Son and
[1:07:03] Holy Ghost and justification
[1:07:05] sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost
[1:07:06] and so forth he's in threes now God is
[1:07:09] that message of repentance to the church
[1:07:11] nominal God's in the message of Divine
[1:07:13] Healing to the church
[1:07:16] Pentecostal God's in the message to the
[1:07:19] bride so we find out that all of them
[1:07:22] calling one to this this to that that to
[1:07:24] that God calling to the church out of
[1:07:26] the world calling the church in the
[1:07:28] denom in the denomination Church into
[1:07:29] Pentecost and calling the bride out of
[1:07:34] Pentecost like Luther Wesley and now
[1:07:37] it's just all perfectly typed up and
[1:07:38] there's no mistake about it I've hit all
[1:07:40] around the ends of it in sides of it and
[1:07:42] inside and outside and shows it by
[1:07:44] scripture the chronology of it till we
[1:07:45] know that it's absolutely the truth
[1:07:47] there's no
[1:07:49] mistakes Sunday I hope that God Sunday I
[1:07:52] hope that God sinks it in so deep that
[1:07:54] you'll never be able to get away from it
[1:07:56] now notice he says Sunday not Sunday
[1:07:58] Sunday guess what he preaches the next
[1:08:05] Sunday yeah it it
[1:08:08] worked Christ is a mystery God
[1:08:11] revealed now you now you see what he's
[1:08:13] looking at he starts talking about in
[1:08:15] Christ's mystery of God revealed what
[1:08:16] he's saying what is this headship
[1:08:18] vindicating what is it showing what's
[1:08:20] taking place what is this Union what
[1:08:21] what's what's transpiring that we're
[1:08:23] living in so he says I hope next Sunday
[1:08:25] it'll sink in so deep you'll never get
[1:08:27] away from it thank you Lord breaking
[1:08:30] into things that the the the brother Ram
[1:08:32] says when he preaches the seventh seal
[1:08:34] he said these things this happened this
[1:08:36] happened he said the third was unknown
[1:08:37] he said he not revealed he said but it's
[1:08:39] moving into that cycle that silence is
[1:08:42] being lifted now as brother B goes
[1:08:44] forward in preaching the word of God
[1:08:45] taking Christ as the mystery of God
[1:08:46] revealed what is he preaching to us the
[1:08:47] seventh seal which is
[1:08:49] Christ he says in the very next
[1:08:51] statement he says so I I hope you get
[1:08:53] you go so deep you'll never get away
[1:08:54] from it and then he says now god- giving
[1:08:56] warning prepare for a judgment the
[1:08:59] atomic bombs are in the hangers
[1:09:00] everything's set and ready and God
[1:09:02] before he can let this happen this thing
[1:09:04] happen he makes a call down through like
[1:09:07] he did in Sodom come out of it get ready
[1:09:09] there's something going to happen like
[1:09:10] in the days of Noah before God sent the
[1:09:12] waters to destroy the world in the great
[1:09:13] anti livian world that had come off into
[1:09:15] sin as Jesus clearly said that it was in
[1:09:17] that day just like this as it was in the
[1:09:19] days of Noah so shall it be at the
[1:09:21] coming of the son of man and how that
[1:09:23] the women on the Rampage and marrying
[1:09:24] and giving and marriage and the great
[1:09:25] scientific achievements and the smart
[1:09:27] educated going into the intellectual
[1:09:29] side and the little humble flock sitting
[1:09:31] off to one side waiting the pending
[1:09:33] judgment and the
[1:09:35] escape and before God sent that judgment
[1:09:39] he sent a prophet just like he did to
[1:09:42] Hezekiah he said get ready for the
[1:09:43] judgments are ready to fall and he made
[1:09:46] the people ready for the time Noah made
[1:09:49] the people ready and it was a call of
[1:09:52] Mercy before judgment amen I'll read the
[1:09:56] statement maybe in the next couple
[1:09:57] services but I encourage you to go
[1:09:59] listen to it we're going to have an
[1:10:00] anniversary of it 60 years next uh in
[1:10:02] January preached it right here IA was
[1:10:05] doing time looking at The Westward Ho
[1:10:07] Hotel where he spoke it at and in one
[1:10:09] stretch Richard Nixon pre uh preached
[1:10:12] well maybe he did Richard Nixon spoke I
[1:10:14] think Kennedy spoke then brother
[1:10:15] brandham spoke and then after that
[1:10:17] Ronald Reagan spoke for all the
[1:10:21] Republicans and it all these things
[1:10:24] happen and it's actually there in the
[1:10:25] wiked edia paid God bless whoever edited
[1:10:26] it to include brother brandham in that
[1:10:28] list of speakers but it's there he
[1:10:30] preaches God rich in Mercy and he says
[1:10:32] oh if God would just raise up a
[1:10:35] prophet and what he's expressing he says
[1:10:38] before God would send judgment he sent a
[1:10:41] Prophet this is what God does before he
[1:10:44] sends judgment he sents the prophet and
[1:10:46] the
[1:10:47] prophet is the one that gives a call for
[1:10:50] Mercy he's the one that says it's a call
[1:10:53] of Mercy before judgment and I believe
[1:10:55] if the bride under her messenger is
[1:10:57] going to be the final voice to the final
[1:10:59] age we're not going to be rageing
[1:11:00] Maniacs with fist clinch and teeth grit
[1:11:03] saying judge them all God just judge
[1:11:04] them all all these and
[1:11:07] homosexuals burn them up there's going
[1:11:10] to be a call for
[1:11:11] Mercy before judgment oh God help
[1:11:16] us let's bow our heads in a word of
[1:11:18] prayer musicians come feel free to stand
[1:11:21] with me let's pray
