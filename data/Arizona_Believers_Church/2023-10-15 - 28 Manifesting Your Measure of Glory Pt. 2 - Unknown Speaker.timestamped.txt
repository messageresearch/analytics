[0:00] I'm going to continue on the subject
[0:02] that we are on Wednesday night on
[0:03] manifesting your measure of Glory this
[0:06] is a continuation on the uh Heaven's
[0:08] mystery Earth's Glory series that brings
[0:10] into view the kingdom and we'll start
[0:13] with Numbers chapter 14: 21 I'm just
[0:15] going to jump right into this as if
[0:17] we're uh continuing on where we were
[0:19] before he says as truly as I live all
[0:23] the Earth shall be filled with the glory
[0:25] of the Lord this is God speaking this is
[0:28] God swearing an oath swearing by himself
[0:31] as surely as truly as I live all the
[0:34] Earth shall be filled with the glory of
[0:36] the Lord we find in the Book of Psalms
[0:38] where they're praying uh let the whole
[0:40] earth be filled with thy Glory then we
[0:42] read in Isaiah chapter 6 I believe it is
[0:44] where it says and the Earth was filled
[0:46] with his glory so here is God swearing
[0:48] that he will do it uh the Believers the
[0:51] the Jews and the psalmist praying that
[0:53] God would do it and then we see this
[0:55] prophecy and this uh future uh Kingdom
[0:58] wherein the whole Earth is filled filled
[1:00] with his glory and we've been taking it
[1:02] from future home where brother bandam
[1:04] teaches us the way that God redeems the
[1:07] Earth is the same way that God redeems
[1:08] the person since the person is redeemed
[1:10] before the Earth is entirely redeemed we
[1:13] see in ourselves an image of what the
[1:15] Earth is going to go through but then we
[1:17] can also look at what the Earth is going
[1:19] to go through and see that there's
[1:20] something that's in this process of
[1:22] redemption for us kind like what does
[1:24] the Redemption process bring out of us
[1:27] and so now we're kind of looking at
[1:28] these other things that come with this
[1:30] Redemption and it says the whole Earth
[1:32] shall be filled with the glory of the
[1:33] Lord and just as the Tabernacle and the
[1:36] temple were filled with the glory of the
[1:38] Lord so will the earth the Tabernacle be
[1:41] in a shadow in Colossians 21:17 it
[1:43] speaks of the temple the sacrifices the
[1:46] priesthood which are Shadow the feast
[1:47] days are shadow of things to come but
[1:50] the body is of Christ so we know that
[1:53] the temple was a shadow of what God
[1:55] would do in Christ we can see certain
[1:57] elements in the sacrifices test
[1:59] testifying of Christ we could see the
[2:01] elements of sanctification and the
[2:03] different ceremonies speaking of what
[2:06] Christ would do or what is actually
[2:07] embodied in Christ and so when the glory
[2:10] of the Lord came down and filled the
[2:11] Tabernacle in the wilderness filled the
[2:13] temple there in the day in which it was
[2:15] dedicated this was a an example of how
[2:17] that the Holy Ghost would come uh even
[2:19] evidenced by a cloud and would
[2:21] overshadow uh uh overshadow Christ and
[2:25] then declare I'm dwelling the glory of
[2:27] God is dwelling in this sun so just as
[2:30] the temple was a shadow of what God
[2:31] would do in Christ Christ was the body
[2:34] amen and the body is that which uh cast
[2:37] The Shadow as opposed to the shadow
[2:40] itself so when he says these were Shadow
[2:42] things to come but Christ is the body
[2:45] he's saying the body is the very thing
[2:46] that was cast in The Shadow and so what
[2:49] we enjoyed and experienced here was just
[2:51] in measure of what you receive in Christ
[2:53] it was just testifying that there is a
[2:55] body and this so that Christ is the body
[2:59] of what the Old Testament
[3:01] shadowed now as we read here in verse 22
[3:03] of Ephesians chapter 1 it says and hath
[3:05] put all things under his feet the body
[3:07] Christ and gave him to be the head over
[3:10] all things to the church which is his
[3:13] body the fullness of him that filth all
[3:16] and all so now as Christ embodied the
[3:19] shadow of the Old Testament now Christ
[3:22] comes and he's the fullness of the glory
[3:24] of God he's the fullness of the godhead
[3:26] bodily and he now is to be set as the
[3:30] head of the church and the church is to
[3:32] be his body so the the picture kind of
[3:35] develops a little bit further where
[3:38] Christ is the head and the bride now is
[3:39] the body and it says the body is the
[3:42] fullness of him that filth all in all to
[3:46] fill it it means to to to fill up to
[3:48] full measure to make complete in every
[3:50] way or to render perfect now that that
[3:53] speaks to a head if a head does not have
[3:56] a body then the head itself is
[3:58] incomplete
[4:00] and so we see some completeness in Jesus
[4:02] Christ but now in this image that God is
[4:04] wanting to achieve a bride there's a
[4:06] head or there's a bridegroom and there's
[4:08] this body and the body is what renders
[4:11] everything
[4:12] complete I hope this point comes through
[4:15] today that there's something to that in
[4:17] terms of satisfaction or fulfillment
[4:19] that we're looking at so Christ was the
[4:22] fullness we can see that Christ was the
[4:24] fullness but now his bride is going to
[4:27] be the fullness of the word of God
[4:28] manifesting God Glory because the body
[4:31] is that which renders and makes complete
[4:33] that fills it up Christ is the mystery
[4:36] of God revealed brother Bram says there
[4:38] would be a Time come forth when he could
[4:40] express himself in fullness of his
[4:42] godhead deity through his church and we
[4:46] may we may pick up on that uh statement
[4:49] in Christ is the mystery God revealed in
[4:51] the next service it's really lengthy I
[4:53] don't think I'm going to have time this
[4:54] morning to get to it uh but think of
[4:56] that he says and he's speaking of
[4:57] Malachi chapter 4 speaking the seals
[5:00] being opened he's looking at all these
[5:01] different events and prophecies being
[5:03] fulfilled and he says there going to
[5:04] come a time when he would Express
[5:06] himself fully in fullness of his godhead
[5:09] and he says deity through his church and
[5:12] so that's where we're looking at is how
[5:14] we the body of Christ are to be
[5:16] manifesting the glory of God just as he
[5:18] did in Jesus
[5:20] Christ there's a lot that we're drawing
[5:22] from from the book of Ephesians so if
[5:24] you'll turn to Ephesians chapter
[5:26] 3 verses 8 to 11
[5:30] Paul we know Ephesians parallels Joshua
[5:33] so the book of Ephesians is Paul
[5:35] teaching the word of God to place them
[5:38] positionally who they were in that age
[5:40] of course that would to me it makes a
[5:42] lot of sense if this is uh Ephesian age
[5:45] is even going to once that church age
[5:47] sets in that's going to be the first
[5:49] church age and he's a messenger to that
[5:51] age this is positionally placing the
[5:53] Bride of that age it's a it's an
[5:55] important uh view that brother bandam
[5:57] gives us when he says Ephesians
[5:58] parallels Joshua
[6:00] cuz here's a prophet trying to
[6:01] positionally place the believer who's
[6:03] already in the promised land trying to
[6:04] place him where they belong in that
[6:06] promised land and in verse eight he says
[6:08] unto me who am less than the rest of All
[6:10] Saints is the grace this Grace given
[6:13] that I should preach among the Gentiles
[6:15] The unsearchable Riches of
[6:18] Christ and the the he he is counting
[6:22] this as a privilege to preach the
[6:24] unsearchable riches of Christ and it's
[6:26] among the Gentiles to the Gentiles and
[6:28] to make all men see what is the
[6:31] Fellowship of the mystery which from the
[6:34] beginning of the world hath been hidden
[6:36] God who created All Things by Jesus
[6:39] Christ so there was a mystery that was
[6:41] hid in God this is Heaven's mystery this
[6:43] is a mystery that lingered throughout
[6:45] the Old Testament but now Paul is saying
[6:47] that I'm preaching the unsearchable
[6:49] riches of the Messiah among the Gentiles
[6:52] and this is a mystery and he's wanting
[6:54] all to have a fellowship in this mystery
[6:56] so this is a mystery hidden by God but
[6:59] it and it has something to do with the
[7:00] Gentile bride he says I'm preaching the
[7:03] unsearchable riches of Christ among the
[7:05] Gentiles that all men might uh see what
[7:08] is the Fellowship of the mystery which
[7:10] God from the beginning so from the
[7:12] beginning of the world and creation are
[7:14] by Jesus Christ but for a purpose and
[7:17] for a goal because he says to the intent
[7:20] in verse 10 thinking of this The
[7:22] unsearchable Riches of Christ The
[7:24] Fellowship of the mystery which was
[7:26] hidden in God from the beginning who
[7:28] created All Things by Jes Jesus Christ
[7:30] and it's as if Paul is saying it was hid
[7:32] and God in the beginning it was a
[7:34] mystery when all things are created but
[7:36] it's part of it's part of the mystery of
[7:37] creation says to the intent that now for
[7:41] the purpose that now for the goal that
[7:43] now unto the principalities in powers in
[7:46] Heavenly places might be known by the
[7:49] church the manifold wisdom of God
[7:53] according to the Eternal purpose which
[7:55] he purposed in Christ Jesus our lord so
[7:58] this uh
[8:01] manifestation of the wisdom of God is
[8:04] according to the Eternal purpose which
[8:06] he purposed in Christ Jesus we're coming
[8:09] down to God's ultimate objective that
[8:12] God who is this unknown God this
[8:14] mysterious God a God who expresses
[8:16] himself in light and a God who expresses
[8:18] himself in a bodily form but yet just
[8:21] there's no one expression that can truly
[8:23] tell all that he is just in one glance
[8:26] so God is working throughout all time in
[8:28] history to place where now now through
[8:31] the work of Jesus Christ now I can
[8:33] declare my glory the manifold wisdom of
[8:37] God one translation renders it this way
[8:40] and it's just so beautiful so that now
[8:42] through the church the fullness of the
[8:45] wisdom of God might be made known to the
[8:47] rulers and authorities in the Heavenly
[8:49] places I catch how that emphasis is that
[8:52] it's not that it would might that the
[8:54] wisdom of God would be known to you but
[8:57] that you would make known the Manifest
[8:59] wisdom of God the fullness of the wisdom
[9:01] of God would be declared by you to all
[9:05] powers and principalities we are raised
[9:07] up seated in Heavenly places in Christ
[9:09] Jesus and that's a realm HHH spiritual
[9:12] wickedness in high places uh uh rulers
[9:14] of the darkness and there's powers and
[9:16] principalities in that realm and so God
[9:19] now has gone through this process so
[9:21] that now now through the bride the
[9:24] fullness of God's wisdom can be declared
[9:26] and manifested to all spirits to all
[9:29] ungodliness to all unbelief to all
[9:31] principalities and
[9:33] Powers manifesting the mystery of Heaven
[9:35] on Earth good and so the wisdom of God
[9:38] the mystery of God is to be manifested
[9:40] in his
[9:43] body and I I I I'm just going to make
[9:47] reference to this because it's a much
[9:49] larger thought so you are going to be
[9:53] declaring the glory of God you're that's
[9:55] what your life is now it's for the
[9:57] purpose of making God known
[10:00] now Christ in this sense I I want to be
[10:04] careful just how I say this Christ was a
[10:06] preview of The Bride because in him
[10:09] there's there's some there's things
[10:11] expressed in this firstborn among many
[10:13] Brethren and he's this example and he
[10:16] set for us an example so when I say that
[10:18] it might be just the way that I phrased
[10:20] it might be a little odd but he was
[10:21] declaring as a wave sheath this is this
[10:24] is what's to come there's more to come
[10:25] so in Christ there is a shadow too or
[10:29] forecasting of of more to come because
[10:31] he even says Greater Works will you
[10:33] do and brother bandam said that's a
[10:35] divine revelation of the word made flesh
[10:37] if it was flesh in the day by the son
[10:40] the groom it's the flesh today by the
[10:42] bride he says in another place it's God
[10:45] manifested in flesh now in the flesh of
[10:47] his bride for the bride and the husband
[10:49] is the same self flesh she is him self
[10:53] same persons so there's this is that
[10:55] fullness this summing up this
[10:57] completeness so Paul continues after
[10:59] saying that through the church is to be
[11:01] the the fullness of the wisdom of God is
[11:03] to be cleared by his body we picked this
[11:06] up in verse 14 of the same
[11:08] chapter and excuse me if my voice is a
[11:10] little a little rough as just as I
[11:13] mentioned on Wednesday just fighting
[11:14] through some things and I feel very
[11:16] strained in my voice this morning says
[11:18] for this cause I bow my knees unto the
[11:21] father of our Lord Jesus Christ of whom
[11:23] the whole family in Heaven and Earth is
[11:25] named that he would Grant you according
[11:28] to the rich of his glory to be
[11:30] strengthened with might by his spirit in
[11:33] the Inner Man amen and follow these
[11:35] words very closely that Christ I'll read
[11:37] it all and then we'll go back through it
[11:38] that Christ May dwell in your hearts by
[11:40] faith that ye being rooted and grounded
[11:43] in love may be able to comprehend with
[11:46] All Saints what is the breadth and
[11:48] length and depth and height and to know
[11:51] the love of Christ which passeth
[11:52] knowledge that you might be filled with
[11:55] all the fullness of God Amen that you
[11:59] might be filled with all the fullness of
[12:01] God so the image of being rooted in love
[12:04] in Christ dwelling that having been
[12:07] rooted in love and now Christ dwelling
[12:09] in your hearts there's this process to
[12:11] where we come to comprehend every
[12:13] Dimension to say the breath is just the
[12:16] full extent of the length depth and
[12:18] height not just to know that it has
[12:20] Dimension and not just to know that it's
[12:22] deep or not just to know that it's big
[12:24] but to to comprehend the breadth of all
[12:27] these things we can say there's a
[12:29] three-fold purpose of Christ and and I
[12:32] so there's the length the height and the
[12:33] depth well I want the breadth of the
[12:35] three-fold purpose I don't want just a
[12:37] little Glimpse here and a little Glimpse
[12:38] there and say well I've kind of sced
[12:40] together three I want to know the breath
[12:42] as the scripture says may be able to
[12:43] comprehend with All Saints the breadth
[12:45] and length and depth and height right so
[12:48] it is in this knowing the love of Christ
[12:51] being rooted in love Christ dwelling
[12:53] here's that secret Christ Christ
[12:55] dwelling in your hearts by
[12:57] faith in knowing the love of Christ we
[13:00] will be filled with all the
[13:03] fullness to be filled it means to make
[13:05] full to fill up to render full to
[13:08] complete every
[13:10] particular so it says if if there was a
[13:12] bucket list or a checklist that's that's
[13:15] when it's filled when every box is
[13:17] checked if there was a measure and it
[13:19] had to reach a line that's when it's
[13:21] filled it's a realization of the
[13:24] goal that you might be filled with all
[13:26] the
[13:27] fullness and when it uses the term
[13:29] fullness it means that which fills or
[13:32] with which a thing is filled so that you
[13:36] might be filled fully with
[13:38] God that you might be filled with all
[13:41] the fullness of God filled even unto all
[13:44] the fullness of God as God is full
[13:47] there's something that's to happen to
[13:50] the individual who has Christ dwelling
[13:52] in the hearts by faith being rooted and
[13:54] grounded in love that there's a there's
[13:56] something that's to come forth and this
[13:58] is the old ultimate objective as you
[14:00] read this that you might be filled with
[14:02] all the fullness of God according to our
[14:04] capacity amen according to my measure
[14:07] according to my limit uh whatever
[14:10] whatever extent I can be filled up to
[14:12] whatever measure I can let me be filled
[14:15] this is the ultimate objective let me be
[14:16] filled according to my capacity with the
[14:19] Divine wisdom and knowledge and love of
[14:24] God and consider this in Colossians 2:9
[14:27] and10 it says for in him dwelleth all
[14:28] all the fullness of the godhead body
[14:30] that's
[14:31] Christ and then it says and ye are
[14:33] complete in him which is the head of all
[14:36] principality and power so if that Christ
[14:39] May dwell in your hearts by faith so
[14:42] Christ dwells in Your Heart by faith and
[14:44] in Christ was all the fullness of the
[14:45] godhead bodily so Christ is to dwell in
[14:48] Your Heart by faith and in him is all
[14:50] the fullness of God so there's got to be
[14:52] some sort of mathematics Divine
[14:53] mathematics that we need to come to to
[14:55] realize well I'm just going to accept it
[14:58] that even even though it may be by
[14:59] measure it's a fullness of Christ if the
[15:01] fullness of the godhead bodily was in
[15:04] Christ and Christ is dwelling in me then
[15:06] there's a fullness for me to
[15:09] manifest is not the goal and ambition of
[15:12] of Our Lives to be Christlike amen for
[15:15] the Life of Christ to have preeminence
[15:16] in us and a reign in us to to when we
[15:19] make decisions and we respond to
[15:20] circumstances and in all things we're
[15:22] demonstrating the character and nature
[15:23] of
[15:25] Christ I can say that this is where
[15:27] we're at if you've been filled with the
[15:29] Holy Ghost where we are is this place of
[15:31] coming to a full
[15:33] surrender a place of total dependence
[15:35] upon
[15:36] him to so that we can manifest him now
[15:40] Paul continues in chapter 4 we find that
[15:42] there's just this consistent theme
[15:44] through Ephesians 3 or through the book
[15:46] of Ephesians it continues into chapter 5
[15:49] and chapter 6 and yet we won't refer to
[15:52] those uh this today but
[15:55] there's there's obviously these themes
[15:57] in there but it says says in Ephesians
[15:59] 4: 111 12 and 13 and he gave some these
[16:03] are gifts he gave gifts to men some
[16:05] Apostles some prophets some evangelists
[16:07] and some pastors and
[16:09] teachers these gifts now are for the
[16:13] perfecting of the Saints for the work of
[16:17] the ministry for the edifying of the
[16:19] body of Christ it's not for the
[16:20] perfecting of the gifts of the ministers
[16:22] it's not for the edifying of the
[16:23] ministers but it's for the perfecting of
[16:26] the Saints so there's a perfecting of
[16:28] our lives and there's an edification
[16:30] which is a building up God has sent
[16:32] gifts into his church and they've been
[16:34] in this church since the very beginning
[16:36] of the Christian Church who's been
[16:37] ministering gifts that are for the sole
[16:40] purpose of building up his
[16:42] body through Gifts of prophets and
[16:44] pastors and apostles and teachers and
[16:47] evangelists therefore the the building
[16:48] up of the body and the word is going to
[16:51] be preached until notice verse 13 till
[16:53] we all come in the unity of the faith
[16:59] so that's a a very Hefty statement the
[17:02] unity of the faith and of the knowledge
[17:05] of the Son of God so through the unity
[17:08] of the faith and the knowledge of the
[17:09] Son of God we're being edified and built
[17:10] up unto a perfect man unto the measure
[17:14] of the stature of the fullness of Christ
[17:17] that he says later that we may grow up
[17:19] into the head we're to grow up to fill
[17:22] up to the head to come to that full
[17:24] measure the same likeness and the same
[17:26] image so the goal is as brother preach
[17:28] it the stature of a perfect man this is
[17:31] the full measure of Christ the measure
[17:34] of the stature of the fullness of Christ
[17:36] the word of God is to build us up to
[17:38] that place we can grow to the measure of
[17:41] Jesus
[17:42] Christ brother Bram says and modern
[17:45] events are made clear by
[17:47] prophecy and he says I'll meet you in
[17:50] one place the place I put my name
[17:52] because we're seeing Christ as this the
[17:54] knowledge of the Son of God a perfect
[17:56] man the measure and statute of the
[17:57] fullness of Christ Christ he said that's
[17:59] in Jesus Christ that's where God put his
[18:02] name there's the only place he'll meet
[18:04] you and it's in Christ is the word the
[18:07] same yesterday he says it's growed from
[18:10] the feet thighs now this is the image of
[18:12] growing now into the head and now it's
[18:15] in the head fixing to go so this is
[18:17] Rapture time manifesting in full measure
[18:20] the bride the same as the groom so the
[18:24] bride the body is his the bride is his
[18:26] body she is his voice and and it's not
[18:29] just a little part she's the full
[18:31] measure manifesting in full measure the
[18:34] bride the same as the groom so here's
[18:38] Christ the word made manifest in the
[18:40] days as brother said as the sun and now
[18:43] today the bride is to manifest in full
[18:47] measure Jesus said to them in John 5:39
[18:51] search the scriptures for in them you
[18:53] think you have eternal life and they are
[18:55] they which testify me he was was the
[18:58] word made flesh amen he's the mystery of
[19:01] the written word revealed God interprets
[19:04] his word by bringing it to pass my just
[19:06] take the Old Testament pick it apart
[19:08] diagram it chart it do everything you
[19:09] can to try to figure out who the Messiah
[19:11] is and no matter what you come up with
[19:13] there's no better interpretation then
[19:15] Jesus Christ who lived it he was the
[19:18] written word revealed he says search the
[19:21] scriptures you testify to have eternal
[19:23] life in the scriptures it's the
[19:25] scriptures that testify of me because I
[19:27] am the embodiment I'm the body of the
[19:30] shadow of the letter I am the body of
[19:33] what these words were forecasting he was
[19:35] the mystery of the written word
[19:38] revealed and in the sermon the future
[19:40] home of the Heavenly bridegroom and the
[19:42] Earthly bride brother brand and the kind
[19:44] of in the beginning is talking about how
[19:45] that he always finds his messages by
[19:47] prayer be sitting in prayer and
[19:49] something's revealed to him he thinks on
[19:50] it a little bit he says he can just feel
[19:52] it kind of get closer and closer then
[19:54] sometimes I keep waiting till it breaks
[19:56] into a vision he says but when it begins
[19:58] to come and I'm satisfied it comes from
[20:00] God then I go to the scripture and so as
[20:04] as as he goes through that process no
[20:06] matter how that inspiration may have
[20:08] struck he kind of lays it out there may
[20:11] be reading his Bible kind of runs the
[20:12] concordance he sees maybe some scof
[20:14] filled notes maybe he's reading from
[20:16] some of these other Scholars and and and
[20:18] something's coming to him as he as some
[20:21] inspiration comes and he's reading no
[20:22] matter how it happens he says he finds
[20:24] his messages by prayer it can't just be
[20:26] by inspiration alone it can't just be by
[20:29] uh uh um you know kind of getting a
[20:31] little bit of a fi and he has a process
[20:32] he's describing to us very interesting
[20:34] that he would kind of open this up to us
[20:36] but the thing he begins to hone in on is
[20:38] he says I go to the
[20:39] scripture and and so no matter how how
[20:42] it would come and then how it would be
[20:44] uh supplemented he's got to come back to
[20:46] the Bible and he says when it begins to
[20:49] come I I go to the scripture that is it
[20:53] ought to be the confirmation of every
[20:55] spiritual thing that's done the Bible
[20:57] should be the the confirmation of it
[20:59] because the Bible is the complete
[21:01] revelation of Jesus
[21:03] Christ I'm using this statement for a
[21:05] very reason we find a lot of places says
[21:06] this Bible is the complete revelation of
[21:08] Jesus Christ we believe that it's Jesus
[21:09] Christ in written form it's God in
[21:11] letter form he says because the Bible is
[21:13] the complete revelation of Jesus Christ
[21:15] you see it is his body it's a little bit
[21:18] different little bit different uh
[21:20] emphasis it's the complete revelation of
[21:22] Jesus Christ he says but it is his body
[21:25] so it speaks of something about who he
[21:28] is Old Testament spoke about who he is
[21:30] now the whole Bible Old Testament New
[21:32] Testament he says it is his body and the
[21:35] message the super sign says oh God if
[21:38] the world could only see that God and
[21:40] man are one the super sign was that
[21:43] first man that God come could come into
[21:46] that's the super sign the first man that
[21:48] God could come into all that God was he
[21:50] poured into Christ and all Christ was he
[21:53] poured into the church super sign God
[21:56] and man and and and we say God and man
[21:59] Christ but now God and man you God and
[22:01] man together that was to be the Super
[22:04] sign of the last
[22:06] day when the entire Bible was to be
[22:08] fulfilled in the last days well how is
[22:11] it the entire Bible's going to be
[22:12] fulfilled in the last days you going say
[22:14] well the last days are all that
[22:15] culminates in even to the New Jerusalem
[22:17] coming down out of heaven but there's
[22:19] something he's looking at that in the
[22:21] last days the entire Bibles to be
[22:23] fulfilled and what is the Bible it's his
[22:26] body and who are you you are his body so
[22:29] there's a filling up in these last days
[22:32] there's a measure that's to be
[22:33] manifested there's a there's an
[22:34] objective and a goal that God has had in
[22:36] his heart from the beginning that's
[22:38] finally going to be
[22:42] satisfied he says in the unity he says
[22:45] do we come into the unity of the
[22:48] faith
[22:52] now if I could say it this way the unity
[22:56] of the faith first and foremost I I the
[22:58] way that it most often strikes me
[23:01] because it says till we all come in the
[23:03] unity of the faith is that our faith
[23:05] would be United and that we would have
[23:08] unity in our faith and I think there's
[23:11] that's just the way that it most often
[23:12] almost always would strike me is that
[23:14] there's this Unity of Faith amongst the
[23:16] Believers and and I think that there is
[23:19] there is that un Unity of Faith but yet
[23:21] this is
[23:23] individualistic to us that we in the
[23:25] unity of the faith is it's it embodies
[23:28] the Oneness of us with the word of
[23:31] God the unity of the faith is a uniting
[23:34] of the Oneness between you in the word
[23:36] like there's this harmony this Oneness
[23:38] this Faith this cohesion this mixing
[23:40] together of you with the word of God
[23:43] whatever your measure is uh because when
[23:45] it comes to the the the every man has
[23:47] been given a measure faith and each one
[23:49] of us have different gifts and callings
[23:51] we have too much carnality uh in our
[23:53] minds to to try to figure out what the
[23:55] unity of the faith looks like say well
[23:57] you know you're this and you're that so
[23:58] I need to be this and I need to be that
[24:00] or you've experienced this and you've
[24:01] experienced this you've manifested this
[24:02] you've manifested that and somehow the
[24:04] unity of the faith is when we all just
[24:06] all of a sudden at 11:56 one morning we
[24:08] just all spontaneously start doing
[24:10] synchronized
[24:11] dancing I just all of us immediately we
[24:14] just start doing the same thing we're
[24:15] like hey you like this isn't this good
[24:17] that's not what it's talking about it's
[24:18] talking about you and the word
[24:19] harmonizing you've got a part to play
[24:22] you've got a part to play and together
[24:23] it'll all it'll all be work in harmony
[24:25] to God's word so I'm wanting to First
[24:27] and foremost for you to think is that
[24:29] the unity of the faith is to bring the
[24:31] fullness it's that Oneness of you and
[24:33] the word as Jesus said in John chap
[24:36] 10:30 I and my father are
[24:40] one this Oneness brother Ram talks about
[24:42] it Harmony this harmony that existed
[24:44] between the Father and Son now exists
[24:45] between Christ and his bride as Christ
[24:48] was and I'm using the word very Loosely
[24:50] a shadow or preview or prefigure Christ
[24:53] was a fullness the bride is to be a
[24:55] fullness Christ said I am my father one
[24:57] and even pray that they may be one even
[24:59] as you and I are one there is going to
[25:00] be then a Oneness or fullness that's
[25:03] manifested in the bride with
[25:06] Christ he which is the fullness of the
[25:08] godhead bodily having preeminence in his
[25:12] bride brother bam there's so many
[25:14] statements to this effect and I know if
[25:17] we've read these a lot I think
[25:19] repetition will be okay this morning and
[25:21] the sermon the seed is not air with a
[25:23] shook he said but when you come to say I
[25:25] am my father one amen now this is Jesus
[25:29] said I am my father one and they picked
[25:31] up stones to Stone him but now when you
[25:33] come to say I am my father one when the
[25:35] bride begins to recognize her equality
[25:38] when the bride begins to recognize her
[25:39] position when the bride begins to stand
[25:41] up and know that it's not H uh that this
[25:44] isn't something this is what Christ paid
[25:46] for people say I am his body I am him I
[25:50] am bone of his bone life of his life
[25:52] flesh of his flesh and to say that with
[25:54] some sort of confence to believe this is
[25:56] what his purpose was in the beginning
[25:57] this is who I am I'm not ashamed of it
[26:00] and to not let any man with the
[26:02] three-pointed club try to beat you down
[26:04] and take you away from that but to stand
[26:06] up and say I am my father one he says
[26:08] when you begin to say and these other
[26:11] things then the Shu pulls away from him
[26:15] well you know what the shuck is they
[26:16] don't they don't like that talk they
[26:18] don't want that that um uh uh that life
[26:20] they don't want that kind of uh
[26:22] pronunciation and so there's something
[26:24] about you coming to your position that
[26:26] just causes the sh to wither away amen
[26:29] because they've got their own take on
[26:31] things he says but the real genuine
[26:34] bride church will bring forth the entire
[26:37] word of God in its fullness and in its
[26:40] strength for he's the same yesterday
[26:42] today and
[26:43] forever the real genuine bride church
[26:47] will bring forth the entire word of God
[26:50] in its fullness and in its
[26:53] strength she will do
[26:55] it that's the time that that we're
[26:57] living in he said there come a time in
[27:00] the last days when
[27:02] God
[27:05] would Express himself in
[27:08] fullness of his
[27:12] godhead brother B says it this way and
[27:14] what was the Holy Ghost given
[27:19] for I know this is a very familiar
[27:21] statement to you he said God is waiting
[27:23] on me and
[27:25] you the church is waiting on me and you
[27:28] it's quite a quite a statement and he
[27:30] says adoption
[27:31] time I know you know I don't know if
[27:34] it's so much of a controversy anymore we
[27:36] there's always kind of a rhythm where
[27:37] you move on to other controversies I
[27:39] don't know if they're arguing over
[27:40] whether it's one cup at Communion or
[27:42] multiple cups I stay out of it but
[27:45] there's this adoption can be kind of a
[27:47] buzzword that triggers a lot of people
[27:50] but adoption time brother Bram says when
[27:52] God can pour to us his fullness so
[27:54] brother B when he preached on adoption
[27:56] hear you him and these different things
[27:57] he he had something very specific in his
[27:59] mind that he repeatedly and consistently
[28:01] emphasized and what would be important
[28:03] is that we catch his emphasis and not
[28:06] try to kind of Rec couch his emphasis so
[28:08] that kind of makes F makes sense in a
[28:10] bigger picture that we have in our minds
[28:12] just wrestle with what he said to
[28:14] understand what he's trying to teach and
[28:16] this statement here to me is so
[28:18] directing to what his thought was when
[28:20] he preached on adoption he says adoption
[28:23] time when God can pour into us his
[28:24] fullness his power his resurrection
[28:28] that when the church and Christ become
[28:30] so close together to Christ becomes
[28:32] visible Among Us and raises the dead and
[28:34] we go in the Rapture there there's a lot
[28:36] of there's a lot there there's a lot to
[28:38] kind of grab on to and wrestle with and
[28:40] he's saying that adoption time has
[28:42] something to do with the filling up
[28:44] adoption time has something to do with
[28:45] the culmination a completion a a
[28:47] finishing like we this is this is what
[28:49] it was all for to begin with and this is
[28:51] what I was angling for to begin with and
[28:53] it connects in with the change of our
[28:55] bodies he said this is what adoption
[28:57] time is is when God's fullness can work
[28:59] so freely through the church he even
[29:01] talks about how it will touch those who
[29:02] are in the graves and it'll raise them
[29:04] up and we'll all go on the Rapture
[29:06] together this is where Christ can become
[29:08] visible amongst us amen through
[29:12] manifestation so adoption time is is
[29:15] fullness time Amen in Ephesians 1:5 this
[29:19] is at the real heart of what Paul is
[29:21] preaching having predestinated us under
[29:23] the adoption of children by Jesus Christ
[29:25] himself according to the good pleasure
[29:27] of his
[29:28] will Paul is writing this and brother
[29:31] bam is using this Ephesians parallels
[29:33] Joshua he's showing how that this is
[29:34] this letter is to the elect this letter
[29:36] is to the the saved this letter is to
[29:38] those who have the Holy Ghost and now
[29:40] Paul is positionally placing them in the
[29:42] promised land because we've been
[29:43] predestined unto
[29:47] adoption so there is an adoption time
[29:50] for the
[29:53] body I want to use it this way a Rapture
[29:55] time a climax time
[29:58] and so adoption time as brother says is
[30:00] a fullness time here adoption time when
[30:02] God comporn us his
[30:04] fullness
[30:06] now when we think of the adoption
[30:09] type there's we have
[30:13] our natural type of adoption where in a
[30:16] f a a parent uh goes through a legal
[30:20] process to become Guardians and legal
[30:23] parents of a child that was not the
[30:25] product of of them elves or their own
[30:28] Union and I guess they can have single
[30:30] parent adoption these days but
[30:31] traditionally a mother and a father
[30:33] would take a child who is not their own
[30:35] and go through a legal process to make
[30:37] that child legally their own and that's
[30:39] what most of us understand to be
[30:42] adoption and so we can use a language of
[30:45] adoption of God adopting us when we were
[30:48] Gentiles or Sinners or strangers and had
[30:51] no relationship to God but he's adopted
[30:53] us he's taken us out of sin and made us
[30:55] his own and there's nothing wrong wrong
[30:57] with that language there's nothing wrong
[30:58] with that type it's a beautiful
[31:00] illustration how that something that was
[31:01] an alien something that was a sinner
[31:03] something that was a strange something
[31:04] that had no relationship has now been
[31:06] brought into relationship with God it's
[31:09] beautiful but the adoption that brother
[31:10] Bram zeros in on and the adoption that
[31:12] brother Bram talks about he says calls
[31:14] it a law of the Old Testament he speaks
[31:15] about it being in the Old Testament and
[31:17] so go I challenge anyone to go in there
[31:19] and try to find it but he says it's a
[31:20] law of adoption and I'm not saying it's
[31:22] not there but it's just not as easy as
[31:23] putting in a word search like adoption
[31:26] Old Testament hey being AI where is
[31:28] adoption in the Old Testament and it's
[31:30] just going to spit all out the law of
[31:32] adoption but it's there promise you it's
[31:34] there so brother BS capturing a law and
[31:37] the principles we've been talking about
[31:38] the law of
[31:39] redemption it's connected with this this
[31:41] law of adoption is connected with it in
[31:44] terms of the land shall not be sold
[31:46] forever and kinship and
[31:48] relationship that this child a son stood
[31:51] to gain and inherit all that the father
[31:54] had the land the kingdom and and so this
[31:57] is what brother Brandon refers to as uh
[32:00] the adoption of the Old Testament so a
[32:01] son already a son by birth by Nature by
[32:05] life he would come through the process
[32:07] of training and tutoring because one day
[32:10] he's going to run it it's all going to
[32:12] be his so the father himself having run
[32:14] it for years and labored in it and
[32:17] wrestled with it and brought it to where
[32:19] it was and builder of the family name
[32:20] took what his father gave him and now
[32:22] it's a greater Kingdom and he's going to
[32:24] want to hand it off to his son but he
[32:26] wants that Kingdom to remain he doesn't
[32:28] want that land to be sold right he wants
[32:30] it to be run properly and so he's he
[32:33] wants to train his son to be able to
[32:35] take his place
[32:37] amen so the child is raised and trained
[32:41] to be just like his father right is that
[32:44] not what he teaches us and hear you him
[32:46] and these adoption messages that the
[32:48] child who is already his son who has his
[32:50] nature and his life and his character he
[32:52] grows up to a place where he's training
[32:54] that he has that nature in life he's
[32:56] training him to come that character when
[32:58] the father says you know what I trust
[33:00] him to run this just like
[33:04] me so that there could there's this
[33:06] transition now where he can say you just
[33:09] do it man you don't need you don't even
[33:12] need to say well my father who's your
[33:15] boss said to plow that field
[33:19] uh-uh the father says if you think that
[33:22] field needs to be plowed everyone in the
[33:23] Kingdom needs to listen to you because
[33:25] you've come to this place now well you
[33:27] would run it just like me that's the
[33:30] image that is brought out then brother
[33:32] brandham shows us how the church under
[33:34] the tutorship of the holy spirit is
[33:36] being taught they're learning they're
[33:39] growing this is what has happened
[33:41] through the church ages Holy Spirit the
[33:43] tutor within the church individually
[33:44] within us and the sermon Christ has
[33:46] revealed in his own word he says it's
[33:48] God
[33:49] himself it's becoming to a place I just
[33:51] love how he says becoming to a place and
[33:54] he's governed the body all the way
[33:56] through right then the complete body of
[33:59] Christ is revealed in the form of a
[34:02] bride that was taken out of his
[34:04] side like Adam's was at the beginning
[34:07] it's always been God it's God himself in
[34:10] the church and he's been becoming
[34:12] manifest and growing to a place he's
[34:14] governed the
[34:15] body and then as he's governed it then
[34:18] the complete body of Christ is to be
[34:19] revealed in the form of a bride and then
[34:23] the image he wants to see the bride that
[34:24] was taken out of the side just like the
[34:27] woman was from
[34:28] Adam and what was she everything Adam
[34:31] was there was or there was nothing the
[34:33] woman was that Adam wasn't already that
[34:36] Adam hadn't already been so when she
[34:38] steps forth from his side co-equal co-ee
[34:42] equality they were they were there there
[34:44] was Oneness there was Unity there was
[34:45] Harmony they were he said this is bone
[34:48] of my bone and Flesh of My Flesh there
[34:49] was this likeness there was this
[34:50] compliment to her and this is this is
[34:53] harmony this is Unity this is equality
[34:56] Coe equality is what begins to resonate
[34:58] in my mind that there there's govering
[35:00] all the way down to where God finally
[35:01] brings forth a bride that is co-equal to
[35:04] Christ am it's the process of redemption
[35:06] it's the this the law of
[35:08] adoption and listen to this I want to
[35:10] hit this just real quick God just
[35:13] directed me in this I know it may seem
[35:14] like a little interesting area to open
[35:16] up into but I think every time we can
[35:18] touch on these things that can build a
[35:19] bigger picture uh through all the
[35:21] different times we could just Shine the
[35:22] light on it a little bit but he says in
[35:24] the law of adoption now this is the law
[35:27] of adoption when it came to a son who is
[35:29] born of that father he was the father's
[35:31] DNA the father's genes he had the
[35:33] father's name it said this is in that
[35:36] law of adoption he says the law of
[35:37] adoption made him equal holder with his
[35:40] father now catch this emphasis of
[35:42] equality then another place he says he
[35:44] was adopted he was just equal had the
[35:47] authority over all his father's Goods so
[35:51] this is a equality is a theme of
[35:54] adoption where you're raised up to
[35:56] equality raised up to Oneness and
[35:58] Harmony and unity says in another place
[36:00] and then the father had a ceremony of
[36:01] adoption he adopted his own son into his
[36:04] own business and then the son was
[36:07] co-equal with his
[36:09] father in other words I love this if it
[36:12] had been today the son's name on the
[36:15] check was just as good as the
[36:17] Daddy's you know what that means right
[36:21] you don't need to cash a check that
[36:24] somebody else
[36:25] signed
[36:27] this me it doesn't mean that the son had
[36:28] to go to the father say h yeah so if you
[36:30] could do me a favor if you could just
[36:32] sign here and then I'll go ahead and
[36:34] fill in who the vendor is and date it
[36:37] whenever it comes
[36:39] time he could sign the checkbook
[36:42] himself he can sign you have a need sign
[36:45] it are you listening your name on the
[36:49] check is just as good as your daddy's in
[36:50] other words it's on your own
[36:53] authority the church is raised up to a
[36:56] place where she can
[36:57] speak she can speak the
[37:00] word like Adam did at the beginning you
[37:03] ever thought about what Adam did in the
[37:05] beginning Adam didn't run around the
[37:07] garden saying in the name of the Lord
[37:08] Jesus Christ in the name of the Lord
[37:10] Jesus Christ in the name of the Lord
[37:12] Jesus Christ right come on he spoke and
[37:15] it obeyed he spoke and it obeyed what
[37:18] happened when brother Brandon manifested
[37:20] The Creation in the temporary
[37:21] manifestations of the third pole he
[37:23] didn't invoke a name he had a life
[37:26] behind the words he said let there be
[37:29] and there was what was it sh full
[37:33] Authority coming back into the bride it
[37:35] was showing us that there's going to
[37:36] come a time when the bride will stand on
[37:38] her two feet and say I am his life I am
[37:42] his life and I can speak by
[37:46] power not try to be some sort of
[37:49] enchanter I speaking in tongues and
[37:52] yelling the name of
[37:54] Jesus sometimes I think we have to be
[37:56] careful
[37:58] when the the songs that we worship to
[38:01] and and I'm not saying anything against
[38:03] this song at all but sometimes one of
[38:04] says I speak Jesus I'm wondering what in
[38:07] the world does that mean to
[38:09] you and I think they literally mean I
[38:12] speak Jesus right right that that's what
[38:15] they say that they're just thinking
[38:17] there's something to Jesus right and
[38:20] that that's all you got to say is just
[38:22] say Jesus and there's something magical
[38:25] in saying it now if you're getting
[38:27] nervous I don't I guess it's fine may
[38:29] may Jesus calm your
[38:31] nerves but we know there's more to it
[38:33] than just a
[38:34] pronunciation I'm wanting to get deeper
[38:37] that when we say there's healing in the
[38:38] name Why on when we say there's power in
[38:41] the name why it's not a magical
[38:44] arrangement of
[38:45] syntax and vocalization that makes it
[38:48] power and healing it's not did you know
[38:51] Jesus is is is some sort of Fanatics
[38:53] that makes it work why I want to get to
[38:56] the W why that's where the success is
[38:58] going to be in this time that we're
[38:59] living in now is Lord I want to know the
[39:02] why I want to know the depth I want to
[39:05] know the
[39:07] breaths
[39:08] hallelujah hallelujah it's a time when
[39:11] the son's name on the check was just as
[39:12] good as the
[39:14] daddies now I want to
[39:18] just really get you thinking as we bring
[39:21] this to a close brother brand in the
[39:23] sermon a hidden life says God spoke out
[39:25] this is my beloved
[39:27] son I I can't remember if it was
[39:28] Wednesday or Sunday that we touched on
[39:31] the Transfiguration I want to finish in
[39:33] that area a little bit
[39:36] here he
[39:38] says this was my beloved Son hear ye him
[39:41] God adopted his own child into the
[39:43] family did you know that Jesus Christ
[39:46] was
[39:47] adopted not by Joseph and Mary but by
[39:51] God himself hear me no longer but this
[39:54] is my son who takes over from here on am
[39:57] now I know there's a lot of teaching
[39:59] that can go into that to place what
[40:01] brother Benham taught on that but then
[40:02] he says that adoption is near the time
[40:04] in parable of the
[40:06] church that adoption this Mount
[40:08] Transfiguration adoption and notice
[40:11] where brother brandom orients that
[40:12] because we know that on and we'll come
[40:13] to it here in a moment that on the
[40:15] Jordan River the father came to dwell in
[40:17] the son and that Dove John saw the dove
[40:20] descending upon him but he doesn't point
[40:22] to that as the adoption of Christ he
[40:24] points to mount Transfiguration as the
[40:27] adoption of Christ and he says that
[40:29] adoption is near time in parable of the
[40:31] church in other words that time is now
[40:33] it's adoption time it's a parable of the
[40:36] adoption time for the church now it's
[40:38] time for
[40:39] that he says it's time for that amen
[40:42] hallelujah and here's that here's that
[40:44] turn now let's drop back to the hidden
[40:47] life and find out what this is going to
[40:50] required to get into this place of
[40:53] adoption so there's this requirement he
[40:56] said it's time for the bride to manifest
[40:58] the fullness of his glory if I can say
[41:00] to finish that work there's a lot of
[41:02] themes there in finishing the work to
[41:03] take to take over that's what it's going
[41:06] to be in the Millennium it's what's it's
[41:08] going to be forever is Christ and his
[41:09] bride ruling and reigning there's no
[41:12] appeal to God right right you thinking
[41:15] about this yes there's no appeal like
[41:18] right now we pray we
[41:20] appeal there's a sub where there's a
[41:23] subjection to his will but there's going
[41:24] to be a day when it's not like search
[41:26] the scriptures and find out what's going
[41:27] to happen next no all power all
[41:30] authority all Divinity all glory all Dei
[41:32] is being manifested through Christ and
[41:33] his bride this is it there's no higher
[41:36] [Music]
[41:42] appeal so this
[41:44] fullness we're talking about manifesting
[41:46] your measure of Glory he said let's drop
[41:49] back and find the hidden life that's
[41:50] going to take to require this place to
[41:52] get to this place of adoption so let's
[41:54] just catch very quickly this hid
[41:57] life but let's pick up where brother
[41:59] bram's looking at this on this Mount
[42:01] Transfiguration in Matthew
[42:03] 17:5 he says while he yet spake Behold a
[42:06] bright Cloud overshadowed
[42:08] them this is after six days and they're
[42:11] taken up to a high mountain
[42:14] apart and his reignment did shine as the
[42:16] sun as this Glory radiating and a bright
[42:18] Cloud overshadowed them and behold a
[42:20] voice out of the cloud which said this
[42:23] is my beloved Son and whom well pleased
[42:27] hear ye
[42:29] him everybody makes a statement in one
[42:31] place where God witnessed the same thing
[42:33] on Mount
[42:34] Sunset that's a lot to think about
[42:38] Hallelujah Mount Transfiguration was the
[42:41] adoption of Jesus Christ is what he
[42:43] teaches
[42:44] us now if adoption has to do with
[42:48] fullness now I I don't want I I not
[42:52] going to be very much longer I know
[42:54] that's vague but I'm not going to be
[42:56] very much
[42:58] longer but if I could just kind of say
[43:00] some things drawing on what you know
[43:02] about the message of the hour brother M
[43:04] taught that God adopted his own son that
[43:06] day on that mountain and then he talks
[43:08] about how that then he went to
[43:10] Calvary um and the the immediacy of it
[43:14] it's not that it had to happen the next
[43:16] morning but this is the next because all
[43:18] power and authority is given into him
[43:20] this is so now he's come to a place
[43:21] where he can he could take that last
[43:24] step he could do that final act that was
[43:26] required of him and so this adoption of
[43:29] Christ is part of this culmination this
[43:33] Climax and I want to emphasize it this
[43:35] way that the when we think of adoption
[43:38] it h it relates to the Holy Ghost
[43:40] fulfilling its objective in you
[43:42] fulfilling its purpose in you because in
[43:44] Matthew chap 3:17 it says at the Jordan
[43:47] River when he's baptized and lower voice
[43:48] from Heaven saying this is my beloved
[43:50] Son in whom I'm well pleased so we know
[43:54] that the father comes to dwell in him
[43:56] the Holy Spirit as it was comes to dwell
[43:58] the word is made flesh Heaven and Earth
[43:59] Kiss and they Embrace so now the Holy
[44:01] Ghost the or God has been dwelling in
[44:05] Jesus Christ from that moment and Jesus
[44:09] is fully conscious and aware of this
[44:11] indwelling a and there's this unity and
[44:13] there's this harmony and it brings him
[44:15] to a place on Mount Transfiguration not
[44:18] where he gets the Holy Ghost but now
[44:20] there's this declaration of
[44:22] satisfaction CU what does the Holy Ghost
[44:24] do in Matthew chapter 4 soon as the
[44:27] spirit descends upon him and the father
[44:29] dwells in the son in Matthew chapter 4
[44:30] says immediately he's then he was led of
[44:32] the spirit Into the Wilderness to be
[44:33] tempted there's your holy ghost in Jesus
[44:37] Christ leading him teaching him
[44:40] instructing him doing only what the
[44:42] father says saying only what the father
[44:44] says to do and so he's leading him he's
[44:46] LED of the spirit and when he comes up
[44:48] onto that mountain it's the it's the
[44:50] product of Jesus showing he would do
[44:53] that which pleased the father amen
[44:56] brother Braham says this in the position
[44:58] of a believer in
[45:00] Christ he said th this is my beloved Son
[45:03] hear ye him and it's he's drawn from
[45:04] Matthew 17 and Mark 9 fulfilling every
[45:08] law that the Old Testament
[45:11] required think of that fulfilling every
[45:13] law that the Old Testament required
[45:16] remember how this book is his body and
[45:18] the last days the entire body Bible is
[45:20] going to be fulfilled in the last days
[45:22] now he's saying that Christ there's
[45:24] there there's this image of every law
[45:26] that the Old Testament required this law
[45:28] of redemption this law of adoption these
[45:30] laws that were in the Old Testament
[45:31] Christ is now fulfilling them why
[45:34] because adoption is this point it's a
[45:37] time of fulfillment amen adoption speaks
[45:40] of a time of consummation when I gave
[45:43] you a tutor I gave you the Holy Ghost
[45:46] the Holy Ghost is for a specific purpose
[45:48] and when it achieves its objective when
[45:51] it achieves its purpose then that's the
[45:53] time of adoption it satisfied it need so
[45:56] when that son came to a place of
[45:57] adoption you kind of have to be uh very
[45:59] careful with your type here but when
[46:01] that son came to a place of adoption the
[46:04] tutor had done his
[46:06] job the tutor had done it the the the
[46:09] son at that point when he's now heir of
[46:11] all things he's been trained to a place
[46:13] where he doesn't have to say oh hold on
[46:15] excuse me tutor could you help me he's
[46:16] like no you got this right yes that's
[46:20] why when the bride leaves the Holy Ghost
[46:22] leaves it's it's it's done it's finished
[46:25] it's done job there's no more use for it
[46:28] in the earth anymore cuz that's what it
[46:30] was for Amen to bring us to a place of
[46:33] adoption and rapturing
[46:35] Grace brother B says now for nearly
[46:37] 2,000 years God has been making in him a
[46:40] masterpiece because he struck Adam to
[46:42] get a piece off him part of a rib part
[46:44] of him a rib to make a wife for him and
[46:46] now that perfect Masterpiece he struck
[46:48] at Calvary he got a piece off of him
[46:51] it's just the New Testament that's
[46:53] all really that's all
[46:56] just the New Testament that's all he
[46:58] fulfilled the Old Testament now it's the
[47:00] New Testament another piece to be
[47:03] fulfilled the new and old is husband and
[47:06] wife and it took the old to for show the
[47:09] new Christ come the Masterpiece to
[47:11] fulfill the Old to fulfill that now his
[47:14] bride will fulfill everything that's in
[47:18] the New Testament another Masterpiece in
[47:21] the
[47:22] making now now does that mean the bride
[47:24] through the other ages had has fulfilled
[47:26] anything no that's not it at all it's
[47:28] just saying there's going to be an
[47:29] everything that's fulfilled in this last
[47:32] days amen the bride will fulfill
[47:35] everything that's in the New Testament
[47:37] another Masterpiece is in the making he
[47:40] fulfilled the old now we're to fulfill
[47:42] the new amen he had a work to do we've
[47:45] got a work to do now it's in him both to
[47:47] Will and to do of his good pleasure to
[47:49] finish the
[47:51] work and just as that Spirit Led Christ
[47:55] from from that Jordan River Into the
[47:56] Wilderness to be
[47:58] tempted the bride every bride member
[48:00] must have the Holy Ghost amen and it's
[48:04] the T tutor it's the inside teacher
[48:06] bringing us to a place of
[48:10] equality if I can say this a place of
[48:13] manifestation think whenever it was we
[48:15] dealt with adoption most recently
[48:17] Wednesday or Sunday and how that if you
[48:20] because I want to have Grace and
[48:21] different understandings and
[48:22] perspectives of what adoption may be but
[48:25] if you believe that right now you are
[48:26] fully placed fully adopted son of God by
[48:28] the new birth then that's wonderful then
[48:31] you know what God's doing now is
[48:32] bringing you to a full Revelation and
[48:34] understanding of what that means
[48:37] amen good am and so now your adoption is
[48:40] being adopted right or it's being
[48:42] revealed to you it's being made clear
[48:44] you're it's becoming more evident and
[48:46] you're walking into a manifestation of
[48:48] it if you're fully placed fully adopted
[48:49] then there's a maturing into what that
[48:52] means and what that is and in this hour
[48:54] into the filling up the filling up of
[48:57] what this age
[48:58] represents now that's one way of looking
[49:00] at it and and and I think God can work
[49:02] with you and that understanding to
[49:04] realize there's growing there's maturing
[49:05] that brother bam was talking about in
[49:07] that Spectrum or another way as brother
[49:09] bam taught it is that now that we have
[49:10] the Holy Ghost he's bringing us to a
[49:12] place deeper greater more precise more
[49:15] particular in growing our understanding
[49:17] we're growing up into him and he's
[49:19] bringing us to that place of fullness of
[49:21] equality of understand knowledge to know
[49:24] to that place of climate Max and
[49:26] culmination a place of
[49:30] adoption now Romans 8: 10 and
[49:37] 11 let's drop back to the hidden life
[49:41] and find out what this is going to
[49:43] require to get into this place of
[49:45] adoption I got 10 minutes to get through
[49:48] this in Romans 8: 101 and if Christ be
[49:53] in you if Christ be in you what a
[49:55] supposition
[49:56] the body is dead because of sin but the
[49:59] spirit is life because of
[50:01] righteousness the body is dead because
[50:03] of sin and and and the body is in a in a
[50:06] sense owned by death because of sin
[50:09] still subject to death because of sin
[50:11] but the spirit is life because of
[50:14] righteousness but if the spirit of him
[50:17] that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell
[50:19] in you come on think of this if Christ
[50:23] be in you I've got this dead body body
[50:25] this dead weight but the spirit is life
[50:28] because of right because of sin mind and
[50:30] body are bowed down but the spirit is
[50:32] life and he says
[50:33] so if the spirit of him that raised up
[50:36] Jesus from the dead dwell in you the
[50:38] same Spirit which is the spirit of God
[50:41] the fullness of the godhead bodily dwelt
[50:43] in Christ now Christ dwells with me he
[50:46] had it without measure I've got it by
[50:49] measure Without Limits cuz he says if
[50:52] the spirit that raised up Jesus from the
[50:54] dead dwell in you he he that raised up
[50:56] Christ from the dead shall also Quicken
[51:00] your mortal Body by his spirit that
[51:02] dwelleth in you
[51:04] amen that quick means to make
[51:06] alive to cause to live to invigorate and
[51:10] the word picture that's created by this
[51:12] Greek word that's us it's of seeds being
[51:14] quickened into life where there's this
[51:16] germinating and this springing up and
[51:18] this growing and we ought not just to
[51:20] take this image of us who have the
[51:22] spirit in us and then we weak we grow
[51:25] old and we die and we're buried in a
[51:26] grave and our body's laying there and
[51:28] this says oh one day that spirit is
[51:30] going to come and Quicken that body it's
[51:32] not putting it into a resurrection at a
[51:36] later date it's saying right now this
[51:38] body is dead because of sin but if the
[51:41] spirit that dwells in you is the same
[51:44] spirit that was in Christ that Spirit
[51:47] right now is able to Quicken this Mortal
[51:50] body it's able to do something to this
[51:52] mind it's able to do something to this
[51:54] flesh right now I can Quicken your
[51:56] mortal
[52:00] bodies The Same Spirit shall Quicken
[52:03] your mortal bodies by his spirit that
[52:05] dwells in
[52:07] you it's a quickening power now in the
[52:11] acts of the Holy Spirit I hope you're
[52:12] catching this I know I've covered a lot
[52:14] of ground I'm going be told later today
[52:16] that was a lot there's I know it covered
[52:17] a lot of ground brought in a lot of
[52:19] different principles maybe a lot of
[52:21] things uh uh that hope you didn't get
[52:23] hung up on just trying to bring bring
[52:25] out of the message of the hour the way
[52:26] brother brandom taught it not change
[52:29] it we're looking at the hidden
[52:32] life to find out what this is going to
[52:34] require to get to this place of adoption
[52:36] this is the Holy Ghost dwelling in you a
[52:37] hidden life brother Bram says in the
[52:39] acts of the holy spirit this is the acts
[52:42] of the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit then
[52:44] abides in and grows
[52:47] daily just grows making itself greater
[52:50] and greater pushes out the things the
[52:53] cares the Temptation and as you overcome
[52:56] them the Holy Spirit takes its place
[52:59] this is what it's doing the Holy Spirit
[53:00] abides in you and grows daily becoming
[53:03] greater and greater what's it pushing
[53:05] out things the car is the Temptation and
[53:07] as you overcome them the Holy Spirit
[53:08] takes its place it's growing yes it's
[53:12] becoming from a place where the soul is
[53:14] fully redeemed but now it's growing and
[53:17] it's pushing out Temptations and cares
[53:20] and things and as you overcome it the
[53:23] Holy Spirit takes its place this is this
[53:26] is advancement this is Conquering this
[53:29] is growing the that the same spirit that
[53:32] raised Christ from the dead it raised a
[53:34] dead body back to life how much more can
[53:37] that Spirit dwelling in me now Quicken
[53:39] this Mortal body which was dead because
[53:42] of sin but now life because of
[53:44] righteousness can live and reain in this
[53:48] body I read it on Wednesday night in
[53:50] never presentent water from the rock
[53:52] what we need today is not pray for more
[53:53] power you got enough power to make an
[53:56] Earth what you need is Faith to use that
[53:58] power what you need is to control that
[54:01] life he said control that life well okay
[54:05] this is how he says control it and live
[54:06] such a Godly life that when you ask God
[54:08] for anything you'll know you know we
[54:11] have confidence in God of that we know
[54:12] if we keep his Commandments he'll
[54:14] withhold no good thing from us if we
[54:16] walk with him God walking with us oh
[54:20] sometimes if we feel the good hasn't
[54:22] come our way sometimes we feel that we
[54:24] haven't quite reached that Next Step
[54:25] that we should stop for a moment look
[54:27] around and make sure you're walk with
[54:29] him cuz he may be standing over
[54:31] somewhere else saying this is the way
[54:33] walk in it this is a step you got to
[54:35] take but you've wandered from him a
[54:36] little bit and the only way to get
[54:38] there's walk with him walk with him walk
[54:40] with him that's right keep his
[54:44] Commandments amen and he'll withhold no
[54:47] good thing when we walk with him amen
[54:51] amen I think that's why he lets us go
[54:53] through the things we do that's right so
[54:55] I just cling a little bit
[54:58] closer what we need today is not pray
[55:01] for more
[55:02] power we need Faith to use that
[55:09] power the Bible says faith cometh by
[55:11] hearing hearing by the word of God Amen
[55:15] we need the word now more than ever amen
[55:17] we need the word pure we need it
[55:19] straight we need the word preached we
[55:21] need the word cuz Faith comes by hearing
[55:23] we don't need to pray for more power by
[55:25] the new birth you got more power you got
[55:27] power enough to create and make a new
[55:29] Earth create a world and go live on it
[55:32] but you have to have faith to use that
[55:34] power and where are you going to get
[55:36] Faith
[55:37] from the word not even from more power
[55:41] good more power is not going to bring
[55:43] you more faith the word's going to bring
[55:44] you more more faith amen H this is just
[55:47] to Spur the moment riffing so this could
[55:50] get
[55:51] interesting but right now if an
[55:53] earthquake opened up and swallowed all
[55:56] the electric vehicles on our parking lot
[55:58] just them and them
[56:00] alone we'd be like oh my goodness that
[56:03] vindicates the truth that oil's the way
[56:05] to go right I mean we there we just
[56:08] there'd be some it'd be shocking but you
[56:10] know what as incredible and Powerful as
[56:11] that would be it wouldn't do one thing
[56:13] to add to your faith unless you could
[56:15] bring it back to the word of
[56:17] God I mean no matter how powerful
[56:19] someone right now I could walk through
[56:20] this wall walk back back again and you'd
[56:22] be like I think I saw some guy on
[56:24] YouTube do that
[56:25] right that unless you could bring it
[56:28] back unless the word is connected with
[56:29] it it's not going to give you any more
[56:31] faith we don't need more power we don't
[56:34] need no more physical demonstration what
[56:37] we need is the word to make our faith
[56:40] come to the place of demonstration we
[56:41] need the word to build our
[56:44] faith then whatever your faith can lead
[56:47] you to believe walk in it live it and
[56:49] manifest it but that faith can only come
[56:52] by the word it's the word
[56:55] he says that Faith cometh by hearing if
[56:57] the word preaches received then it
[56:58] produces Faith see he's writing there if
[57:01] the report is believed then the arm of
[57:04] the Lord is revealed what he's drawn
[57:06] from Isaiah there in Romans chapter 10
[57:08] to whom the arm of the Lord to him that
[57:10] believes if the report is believed the
[57:12] strength of the Lord is revealed to them
[57:14] where is it going to how is the strength
[57:16] the arm of the Lord going to be used the
[57:17] power is there but you've got to have
[57:19] the believe the report you got to
[57:21] believe the word for the strength to be
[57:23] made manifest amen yes brother brand in
[57:26] the sermon perfect faith brother Micah
[57:29] you drive an electric vehicle you can
[57:31] come to the piano now we're going to
[57:33] pray that that parking lot doesn't open
[57:34] up I know there's a few other EVS in the
[57:37] church we might have to put up charging
[57:38] stations
[57:40] Glory natural types of
[57:44] spiritual but in perfect faith brother
[57:46] Bram says Jesus had perfect faith I
[57:49] wanted to amplify this so much we're
[57:51] just going to end here Jesus had perfect
[57:52] Faith he had it and it come because he
[57:56] was the
[57:56] word think of how what he taught in
[57:59] wisdom versus Faith how the power that
[58:01] he had and how Jesus used the power what
[58:04] he what he Anchored In what how he
[58:06] really used it he says and you become
[58:08] the word as you receive the word
[58:15] am you want more deity in your
[58:18] midst welcome and receive the word
[58:21] am it's a real real difference
[58:25] and just manufacturing
[58:28] things and and and and just kind of
[58:31] conjuring them up and then just bearing
[58:33] it or just just kind of coming up a way
[58:36] where it's it's carnal we're just
[58:38] producing it we're coming up with uh
[58:41] programs and ways of just binding people
[58:43] to legalism there's another way where
[58:45] you just bear it you just it's produced
[58:48] by the
[58:49] life and if you come back to the
[58:51] principles of the word of God and you
[58:52] receive the word of God then you have
[58:54] deity in your midst and where he is
[58:56] there's power there's life there's
[58:57] healing signs and wonders and miracles
[58:59] but you got to come back to
[59:01] that if you're going to come to the
[59:03] place of fulfillment I know it's a
[59:05] steady consistent emphasis in these
[59:08] things brother brandom in a little
[59:10] sermon he preaches I think this is one
[59:12] it was on the radio when he was in Los
[59:13] Angeles and one in a
[59:16] million if I've got that wrong please
[59:18] forgive
[59:19] me want to close with this he says now
[59:21] each one of you have the Potentials in
[59:23] you to deliver
[59:26] you for it is
[59:28] God since you've been planted into
[59:30] Christ by baptism not water baptism
[59:32] spiritual
[59:34] baptism in each one of you you have the
[59:36] potentials to deliver
[59:39] you now and I love how he says before
[59:41] you go well you know what
[59:43] Aaron you're not so bad after all he
[59:47] says for it's God like ah yeah that's
[59:52] right it's him it's him in you you since
[59:55] you've been planted into Christ by
[59:57] spiritual baptism there's power in you
[1:00:00] for you to be
[1:00:02] delivered he says now look each one of
[1:00:04] you here is standing as
[1:00:06] Believers then the life that was in
[1:00:08] Christ is in
[1:00:10] you it can if you could just see
[1:00:15] it and and I think when he says that
[1:00:18] it's
[1:00:20] not it can deliver you as he saying it
[1:00:22] it
[1:00:23] can
[1:00:25] he says if you could just see it it
[1:00:26] implies that it's hard
[1:00:28] sometimes or maybe we haven't fully seen
[1:00:31] it because he says it's the devil's
[1:00:32] business to keep you blocked off from
[1:00:34] that keep you blinded he can just let
[1:00:38] you be blinded see you don't know where
[1:00:41] you're going then with the power in you
[1:00:44] to get there but because you're blinded
[1:00:47] you won't make a
[1:00:48] step the power in you to create a new
[1:00:51] Earth but you can't get there because
[1:00:53] you're blinded right the power in you
[1:00:55] for deliverance but you can't get there
[1:00:57] because he's got you blocked off he a
[1:01:00] man that's blind cannot tell where he's
[1:01:02] going he's got to seek the understanding
[1:01:04] from somebody who can
[1:01:06] see oh this is so good until we can
[1:01:09] understand this is why Paul said I pray
[1:01:11] that the eyes of your understanding
[1:01:12] would be enlightened give you the spirit
[1:01:14] of wisdom and Revelation and the
[1:01:15] knowledge of him until we can
[1:01:19] understand somebody has got to tell us
[1:01:21] what's the truth and Christ died for you
[1:01:24] and your transplanted from the world
[1:01:25] into Christ and everything you have need
[1:01:28] of is in Right In You by the baptism of
[1:01:30] the Holy Ghost isn't that right confess
[1:01:32] an amen today now the only thing you
[1:01:35] have to do is just start drinking from
[1:01:38] that you got any drinkers here
[1:01:42] today I remember my mom one time she
[1:01:44] went to she just celebrated her birthday
[1:01:46] this past week she went to a garage sale
[1:01:48] and my dad would get home from work he
[1:01:50] like a big tall glass of uh uh water you
[1:01:53] know filled with ice fill fed up with
[1:01:55] water and so she was at a garage sale
[1:01:57] and she came across a giant giant beer
[1:02:00] mug and she grabbed it she's like this
[1:02:02] is going to be perfect for my husband
[1:02:04] she picked it up and she noticed that
[1:02:06] the person R the garage sale was looking
[1:02:07] at her and she held her she says my
[1:02:09] husband's a big
[1:02:12] drinker and it didn't dawn on her till
[1:02:14] later just exactly what he thought about
[1:02:17] her
[1:02:18] husband but this is this is in that not
[1:02:21] the type of the alcoholic way but man my
[1:02:23] goodness I even bought a 64 oun water
[1:02:26] bottle to make sure I'm getting at least
[1:02:28] eight ounces 8 O eight o glasses of
[1:02:31] water a day so I can get my water to be
[1:02:34] hydrated and if you'll put that much
[1:02:37] effort Aaron into drinking 64 ounces of
[1:02:40] water if we'll carry our water bottles
[1:02:43] everywhere we go if we'll have our
[1:02:45] watches reminding us to take a sip and
[1:02:47] stand up oh come on word of God tell me
[1:02:51] to stand up when I need to stand up tell
[1:02:54] me to take a sip when I need to take a
[1:02:57] sip he says start drinking from
[1:03:01] that he says as the tree drinks it
[1:03:03] begins to push out its leaves its buds
[1:03:06] pushes its fruit each year the fruit is
[1:03:09] not in the ground the fruit is in the
[1:03:12] plant the fruit is in the plant and
[1:03:14] every plant has to drink from his
[1:03:16] Fountain as the rain comes down give
[1:03:19] that plant life life to drink from and
[1:03:21] as it drinks it
[1:03:23] grows and it's growing up until it comes
[1:03:25] to the full bud just like the church has
[1:03:29] to bloom out in this
[1:03:33] age and as we drink we grow you see that
[1:03:38] that's the H hidden life drinking
[1:03:41] growing pushing out pushing out becoming
[1:03:45] more Christlike growing maturing
[1:03:47] overcoming it can be a difficult process
[1:03:49] because it over under it uncovers layers
[1:03:52] in our lives and we have these great
[1:03:54] huge battles and things we're going
[1:03:56] through and God gives us the Victory and
[1:03:58] he shoves that off our plate like woo
[1:04:00] that was wonderful that felt so good
[1:04:02] whoa what is this it's the one that was
[1:04:04] lurking underneath that that's the next
[1:04:07] one and don't get worried look what you
[1:04:09] just came through this is the process of
[1:04:11] Deliverance don't get discouraged as a
[1:04:13] Believer today if you're fighting don't
[1:04:15] get discouraged if it seems like it's
[1:04:17] getting darker don't get worried if it

[1:04:20] greater you're getting deeper you're
[1:04:22] getting to the boss and that what you

[1:04:27] of the level you're beating boss after
[1:04:29] boss after boss and one day that last
[1:04:32] boss which is death you're going to put

[1:05:31] but if the plant refuses to drink then
[1:05:34] the plant cannot
[1:05:36] grow that means the only thing you need
