[0:00] place is quite Hot For Me
[0:06] so
[0:10] I was just you know so many things
[0:13] ringing
[0:15] so many things you can preach
[0:18] but you have to go back to the channel
[0:20] of God
[0:22] and let God have his way with his people
[0:29] but you can begin to look at something
[0:31] here
[0:33] and in fact I had never preached about
[0:35] this
[0:38] not even in my home Church
[0:42] but God just directs me to this
[0:46] and I'm titling it
[0:49] dying the death
[0:51] and having the end of the righteous man
[1:01] so there is a death that a righteous man
[1:04] has to die
[1:07] and there is an end that he must have
[1:14] and brother Branham comes here in any
[1:16] one quote honestly contending for the
[1:18] faith he says
[1:21] and today you do it they will laugh at
[1:23] you
[1:24] they got a form of godliness but denying
[1:27] the power of
[1:29] brother
[1:30] I don't want to be a Bellum
[1:34] but I say like Balaam
[1:37] when he came back and he seen what God
[1:40] had done to that bunch of holy Lawless
[1:44] he said let me die the death of the
[1:48] righteous
[1:50] and let my last end be like his
[1:55] amen I said the same thing
[1:58] call me a hori Laura if you want to but
[2:01] let me die the death of the righteous
[2:04] let my last end be as God is blessings
[2:08] as he blessed Jacob Hallelujah this is
[2:11] the prophet he says he doesn't want to
[2:13] be a balam but he's saying
[2:16] said
[2:17] he says I want what that statement
[2:22] let me die the death of a righteous man
[2:26] and let my last end be like his
[2:33] now
[2:35] what is the death of the writers a
[2:37] righteous doesn't die
[2:43] we don't die
[2:45] the Bible says it I believeth the word
[2:47] Jesus said I shall never die
[2:52] but has already passed
[2:55] from death and life
[2:58] so what is this death of a righteous man
[3:02] and what is this death that brother
[3:04] Brahma says I want that death I want
[3:07] that end
[3:11] for a small
[3:13] blessed
[3:17] now
[3:20] maybe I'll break it into maybe pick a
[3:23] part this evening
[3:24] and we shall complete tomorrow
[3:27] but I want us to look at
[3:32] how that there is a death
[3:34] that you must die
[3:36] as a righteous man
[3:39] and there is an end you must come to
[3:44] we don't just have to end like everybody
[3:46] else's ending
[3:48] now that we have to die like everybody
[3:50] else is dying and we have to take a type
[3:53] up with that thought
[3:56] that David is saying did abuna had to
[4:01] die like a fool
[4:07] abuna was the righteous man the Bible
[4:10] says you know Solomon is declaring him
[4:13] to be righteous when he was avenging the
[4:15] death of abuna by commanding binaya to
[4:18] go and kill job when job was holding on
[4:21] the altar on the horns and he says he
[4:24] killed abunda a man more righteous
[4:27] than him
[4:30] so abuna was a royalist man but how
[4:33] could he die like a fool
[4:37] this is the concern of David he says I
[4:40] know we can die we may die
[4:43] but how do you die
[4:46] should you die like a full dice
[4:52] so David is crying
[4:55] and his main
[4:57] how could abuna permit himself to die
[5:00] like a fool
[5:06] you are supposed to die the righteous
[5:08] death but now you are dying like a fool
[5:15] blessed be the name of the Lord and
[5:17] David knows
[5:19] you see abuna was a captain of soul and
[5:23] you know when the soul died he had
[5:25] maintained the kingship of Soul by
[5:27] installing his son is
[5:30] and there was a longer war between job
[5:33] the captain of David or the command of
[5:36] David's forces and abuna who was
[5:38] supporting the son of a soul so there
[5:40] was a long bitter battle
[5:44] if you read the Bible you'll find that
[5:48] killed amasa not because he wanted and
[5:53] amasa was the brother of joab
[5:55] but because amasa was very fast in
[5:59] running
[6:00] and the Bible says he was fast of feet
[6:02] like a wild row
[6:05] and in running after abuna he never
[6:08] turned to the right or the left and our
[6:10] Buddha spoke to him and said you turn
[6:13] aside get a hold of somebody else kill
[6:15] somebody take his armor leave me why
[6:19] should I kill you I don't want to kill
[6:20] you
[6:23] he said if I kill you how will I face
[6:25] your brother chew up
[6:29] I don't want to plant that seed of
[6:31] bitterness between me and your brother
[6:33] but you see abuna I mean a master still
[6:36] followed he spoke to him like three
[6:39] times saying don't follow me because he
[6:42] didn't want to kill him
[6:44] but I must have persisted until abuna
[6:47] killed him
[6:52] and time comes after The Bitter war
[6:57] between the two
[6:59] segments of Israel
[7:01] that abuna decides that this is time to
[7:04] reconcile all Israel back to be under
[7:08] the kingdom of David because David was
[7:12] anointed David is the man that God has
[7:14] made to be the king
[7:18] so he goes
[7:20] to talk to King David
[7:24] and during that time job has gone to
[7:27] fight
[7:29] so when they make their final deal with
[7:31] David
[7:33] descends him away he even gave him he
[7:35] made him a feast he came with about 20
[7:37] soldiers and he went away in a piece but
[7:40] now job comes back and hears that a
[7:43] Buddha has been here
[7:45] and the King has sent him away
[7:58] and abuna knows the bitterness that job
[8:01] has got against him
[8:05] he knows that job is no friend of his
[8:07] he's not fan of his
[8:10] at the slightest opportunity he would
[8:12] kill him
[8:13] but he agrees to come back
[8:16] and not only does he come back
[8:18] but joab calls him to a private talk
[8:22] and he's a commander like your abuse if
[8:26] it is Major generous they are both major
[8:28] generals if they are I'm a commanders
[8:31] all of them are I'm a commanders they
[8:33] all have a bodyguards
[8:37] so David is asking a one million dollar
[8:41] question how could a commander of an
[8:44] army die like a fool in the hands of his
[8:48] enemy
[8:50] why didn't he say okay so you have your
[8:54] bodyguards I also have mine
[8:56] you have your weapons standing there let
[8:59] me stand here let's talk why could he
[9:02] accept to be pulled aside By Hand by
[9:05] such an enemy and then he stabs him to
[9:09] death
[9:10] so the question is why did abuna accept
[9:14] to die like a fool
[9:20] and that's the question
[9:22] that I'm looking at today
[9:24] because there are very many people who
[9:26] are supposed to die as fools
[9:29] but not the righteous ones
[9:33] blessed be the name of the Lord the
[9:36] righteous ones are not supposed to die
[9:37] as fools
[9:39] because when you come here I want to
[9:41] just ask to broaden our thinking here on
[9:43] this when you come in a book of Psalms
[9:45] chapter 14 verse 1 he says if the fool
[9:48] has a said in his heart there is no good
[9:55] that's what a fool says
[9:58] there is no God
[10:02] and that's how foolishness begin
[10:05] there is no God in his church I don't
[10:07] feel the prince of the Lord in his
[10:09] church there is no Holy Spirit here
[10:14] I don't feel my pastor I don't feel this
[10:16] man is a man of God I I don't have
[10:18] something like connected to
[10:24] now we are not in an age where you want
[10:26] to feel God from the church
[10:31] God is not no longer God for you in a
[10:35] church or in a in a group of people
[10:39] but God is now to be felt by you
[10:42] because you are the final tab Anaconda
[10:44] God has to Tabernacle himself in
[10:47] so you are now dying as a fool you know
[10:51] leaving the world like people are saying
[10:53] there's no power in the message there's
[10:54] no anointing anymore something's wrong
[10:56] somewhere something's wrong with you
[11:01] because brother Brown preaches the
[11:02] message he preaches the message and he
[11:05] believes does not hinder God so we are
[11:07] now in the time that God Tabernacle in a
[11:09] man cannot be hindered by the unbelief
[11:12] of another person
[11:13] as long as that God is in you and you
[11:16] have that faith and you have that
[11:17] connection and you feel him then that
[11:19] God cannot be hindered by anybody by any
[11:22] belief not even this church can hinder
[11:25] God
[11:26] not even the other sister the other
[11:28] brother
[11:30] because the final Destiny of the book
[11:33] God made sure they never cannot pray
[11:35] tricks with it take the book eat it up
[11:38] and digest it so the final Destiny of
[11:41] the book is now you
[11:44] the word in you
[11:47] so now foolishness Begin by saying ah
[11:50] there is no God
[11:52] I don't feel the princess of the Lord
[11:55] the church is just dry so who is the
[11:58] judge
[12:02] there's something wrong here
[12:06] then put it right
[12:11] because you are a Believer and all of
[12:14] things are possible to them that believe
[12:17] glory be to God so the devil begins to
[12:20] bring foolishness and the foolishness is
[12:23] there is no God
[12:27] there's no God
[12:29] there's no God in this man there's no
[12:32] God in this human there's no God in this
[12:34] church there's no God here
[12:36] and where is he where is he supposed to
[12:38] be
[12:39] supposed to be new
[12:42] so I look why are you looking for him in
[12:45] other people
[12:48] God is now to be in you
[12:52] and you should be contented that he's
[12:54] with you in you and you should feel his
[12:56] presence but now the devil you see the
[12:59] brother brother preaches three summons
[13:00] he preached and one of somebody says in
[13:03] his presence
[13:05] another sermon
[13:07] the unrecognized the presence of the
[13:10] Living God
[13:11] another sermon a man running away from
[13:14] the prince of the Lord
[13:16] so you can have the prince of the Lord
[13:17] but you have not even recognized it
[13:22] or you are even running away from the
[13:24] parents of the road thinking that
[13:25] there's no presence of the Lord
[13:31] that's why we are now in the
[13:32] dispensation of the third pool and what
[13:34] happens in the dispensation of the third
[13:36] pool show me one manifestation with the
[13:38] sorry pool where brother brother
[13:40] manifested it on develop it
[13:42] right
[13:45] the creation of the squirrels in the
[13:47] wilderness
[13:48] when he was himself with God
[13:51] bringing back the daddy fish just
[13:53] outside there
[13:56] speak English Toms just there in the
[13:59] bush
[14:02] speaking of the Tomb out of his wife
[14:05] just there alone in his house praying
[14:08] not only Pulpit not in the church in a
[14:11] group of people
[14:14] but speaking of his sister had your
[14:16] student to be redeemed not in the church
[14:18] not on the palpit
[14:20] but God Tabernacle in Iman
[14:26] that's where we have to be now
[14:28] that is the maturity
[14:32] you don't even need a group
[14:35] you don't even need a people a big bunch
[14:37] you don't need even to have people who
[14:39] are spiritual around you you need the
[14:42] the presence of God himself in you God
[14:45] in you Christ in you the hope of glory
[14:48] that's what you need
[14:50] but now the devil is trying to bring us
[14:52] back to think as fools and talk as fools
[14:59] judging your destiny by the company
[15:06] so there is no God
[15:08] that's what a fool says
[15:11] and he says in his heart he begins to
[15:14] think about it and then he speaks it
[15:18] that's how a fool dies
[15:23] begins to say there is no God
[15:26] I think there is no more truth I think
[15:29] the anointing went with brother Branham
[15:31] I think I I am I'm just I should resign
[15:35] to fit I will come to that God waiting
[15:37] tomorrow let me resign to Faith and just
[15:39] die die as a fool
[15:44] die in the hands of your enemy
[15:47] when you are armed when you are trained
[15:49] when you are full of matter full of
[15:52] Power full of anointing and a word that
[15:54] you have had only someone is all these
[15:56] years where is it
[15:59] why should we surrender to the devil and
[16:02] sometimes the devil brings us to feel
[16:04] like we are now orphans because Brothers
[16:06] the sin we have now more of God since he
[16:09] left
[16:10] because we have had the message you
[16:12] preached more and more
[16:14] many years
[16:17] but just failing to recognize who you
[16:21] are what you are supposed to do and how
[16:25] because the prophet says when you've got
[16:26] the Holy Ghost you've got faith the only
[16:29] problem that you now have is just how to
[16:31] operate
[16:32] that faith
[16:34] you don't need a great big faith
[16:37] that faith that he has put in you is the
[16:39] faith of God it's not even your faith so
[16:41] you don't have to eat intellectually
[16:43] understand how it should work
[16:47] I've prayed for people with different
[16:49] things but one thing that I always
[16:52] know that God you know does is that I
[16:55] completely ignore don't even look at the
[16:58] condition of the person I'm praying for
[17:00] I don't even think about the the
[17:03] severity of the case
[17:09] because I know the logos that spoke the
[17:13] world into existence in the beginning
[17:14] was the word it's the same word now in
[17:17] US
[17:20] same word amen but we need the same
[17:23] faith
[17:24] just to speak it and now that's what I
[17:28] was preaching in Lima
[17:31] that you see we have to move from the
[17:34] invisible
[17:36] God
[17:38] to the visible
[17:40] incarnate one
[17:44] Jesus is telling the disciples says you
[17:47] believe in God believe also in me
[17:51] it's very easy it has been very easy for
[17:53] you all these thousands of years to
[17:54] believe in the visible God
[17:56] with whom you are relating through the
[17:58] prophets and sacrifices and offerings
[17:59] and so forth but now time has come that
[18:02] is God is here he's working here he's
[18:04] got internet he's Emmanuel he's here
[18:07] and you are not you know use that same
[18:10] Faith to believe in a visible God
[18:13] now we are not even in the dispensation
[18:15] of the disciples when God was with us
[18:18] but we are now in the dispensation of
[18:20] the Bride when God is in US
[18:23] so time has come that you have to
[18:25] believe in the god that is in you
[18:28] and that's why he says time comes he
[18:31] says you will not pray but you'll speak
[18:34] so we have to come to that level of
[18:36] faith
[18:37] so but the danger that we have is dying
[18:41] as fools
[18:43] when we are not fools
[18:45] do you have to die as a fool
[18:50] Point number one a fool has said in his
[18:54] heart
[18:54] there is no God
[18:59] um
[19:00] and then pointy number two
[19:04] I want to just show you some more
[19:06] scriptures here
[19:07] Luke chapter 24.
[19:15] let's look at another type of
[19:17] foolishness
[19:19] that is killing us
[19:22] Luke chapter 24 from verse 25
[19:26] this was the resurrection
[19:37] maybe you you you can now come to this
[19:40] point where you can look from verse 21
[19:44] these people are using the word but we
[19:47] trusted that it had been he we should
[19:51] have redeemed Israel we trusted
[19:54] we trusted in other words we are no
[19:57] longer trusting we have backseated from
[20:00] the trust we have lost the faith that we
[20:03] believe that this man should have been
[20:05] he that should have redeemed Israel but
[20:07] now he died
[20:11] and I think you can assist that kind of
[20:14] picture today within the message
[20:15] fraternity we trusted I put all my life
[20:19] into this message I preached it 30 years
[20:22] I preached it so many years but now have
[20:25] come to a time that I no longer adapt
[20:27] things
[20:29] we trusted no longer trust we preached
[20:32] no longer preached we believed no longer
[20:35] believe it
[20:38] um
[20:40] and then he says
[20:42] they are trying to tell Jesus himself
[20:46] he's walking with him
[20:48] and then in verse 23 says yeah and
[20:51] certain women also of our company made
[20:53] us astonished which were Ali A
[20:56] disparator and when they found out his
[20:59] body they came saying that they are also
[21:01] seen a vision of angels which said that
[21:05] he was alive
[21:07] yet he had told them I'll rise up again
[21:11] but now they are not willing to believe
[21:15] the positive part
[21:17] they're swallowed up in the negative
[21:21] the way he died
[21:24] how he was beaten
[21:26] how he suffered how he even cried and
[21:30] how he was buried
[21:32] they are looking at that they are
[21:34] forgetting the positive
[21:36] that was promised a poor package for
[21:39] this
[21:40] the positive was that after death I will
[21:42] rise up again
[21:47] glory be to God
[21:49] now yeah he says
[21:56] and Saturn of them that is verse 24
[21:58] which were with us went to this suppose
[22:03] and found it even us even so as the
[22:07] women had said but him they saw not
[22:10] now listen to this
[22:12] then he said unto them all fools
[22:20] these are believers
[22:25] they had believed him
[22:27] they had left everything
[22:30] for him
[22:32] now they are beginning to think they
[22:35] made a bad deal
[22:38] and that's why Jesus is following them
[22:44] they were trying to go back and connect
[22:45] the lines with their relatives
[22:47] we therefore my business friends
[22:51] we have realized that we have been built
[22:54] we are going nowhere
[22:57] and Jesus how does he begin he begins by
[23:01] identifying them exactly what they had
[23:03] now become
[23:08] and he says unto them all fools
[23:12] and slow heart
[23:16] to believe all that the prophets have
[23:19] spoken
[23:24] go back to the word the word never fails
[23:31] but you have magnified the situation and
[23:34] you have you know you have really dipped
[23:36] yourself into the pit of Sorrow
[23:39] and you've forgotten what the word he
[23:41] says fools slob heart
[23:46] to believe what a prophet has said
[23:49] the prophets have spoken these things
[23:54] but now you are acting foolishly
[23:58] you are wanting to Die the death of
[24:00] fools
[24:02] how do they end by turning around
[24:05] against what they believed and doubting
[24:07] what they believed and losing trust in
[24:10] what they once trusted
[24:13] and beginning to question what they
[24:15] didn't question
[24:25] so
[24:27] there is now the death
[24:29] he says you fools
[24:33] I mean it's not easy these days to tell
[24:35] a person directing the face that you're
[24:37] a fool
[24:39] especially when they are intellectuals
[24:40] like you Americans
[24:44] they'll I gave you to understand I want
[24:47] to give you a piece of my mind I have
[24:49] this I know this I you know
[24:54] but this is the foolishness not the
[24:57] intellect we are talking about it's the
[24:59] foolishness
[25:02] of doubting
[25:04] what you once believed
[25:08] of stopping the Fulfillment of what you
[25:11] are cherishing
[25:17] blessed be the name of the Lord and he
[25:19] says
[25:20] all fools and slow word to believe all
[25:25] not some not a person
[25:28] all other prophets have spoken
[25:32] oh it's not Christ to have suffered
[25:35] the things and to enter into his glory
[25:38] that is the end
[25:41] Christ was to suffer and enter into his
[25:44] glory and that's why Paul says
[25:47] I've fought a good fight
[25:49] I've kept my cause
[25:52] I've remained within the tracks I've not
[25:54] you know be been you know antagonistic
[25:57] looking for whom to fight
[26:01] or focusing on who is fighting me
[26:05] but I'm looking at my course the one
[26:08] that God gave me
[26:10] I'm looking at the line that I'm
[26:12] supposed to follow I have to run this
[26:15] rest
[26:16] and I know the course the track that
[26:18] have been achieving
[26:20] it's my rest
[26:22] I don't care who is antagonistic who
[26:24] wants to throw his leg on me on so forth
[26:26] who is speaking negative about me who
[26:29] accepts ax you know acknowledges me to
[26:31] be a believer or not
[26:33] approval
[26:41] I'm looking at the one who calling me
[26:46] so Paul says I've kept the faith
[26:50] he doesn't say I've come to the church
[26:51] I've kept the friends I've kept my
[26:54] comrades I've kept this that and that
[26:56] I've kept preaching within the confines
[26:58] of those like my fellow preachers preach
[27:00] so we are in in sync
[27:04] I keep comparing my notes with their
[27:06] notes
[27:08] oh
[27:10] I have kept the faith
[27:14] the faith of Jesus Christ
[27:16] why did he keep the faith how did he
[27:18] succeed in doing that because he died he
[27:21] said he's still 20 I am crucified with
[27:24] Christ nevertheless I Live Now the life
[27:26] that I'm living is not me living Jesus
[27:28] who lives in me so what is the death of
[27:31] a righteous man you die so that Christ
[27:33] lives that's the death of a righteous
[27:35] man
[27:37] you die to your thinking to your
[27:40] reasoning to your understanding to your
[27:42] aspirations to your desires to your
[27:45] feelings you die to the surrounding you
[27:48] die to the spirit of the nation you died
[27:50] in the spirit of the area you live by
[27:52] the spirit of Christ and by the word
[27:55] that's the death of a righteous man but
[27:58] the death of a fool begins to die to
[28:01] kill that weak he once knew
[28:08] so Parliament painted his goals
[28:11] because he had the death of a righteous
[28:13] man
[28:16] a righteous man Abraham Abraham believed
[28:19] in God and it was imputed unto him for
[28:21] righteousness so Abraham believed in God
[28:24] God is the word
[28:27] so when you believe in the word what
[28:30] happens the more of the word you receive
[28:32] the bless of you you become and the more
[28:34] of the word
[28:36] you disappear as he appears
[28:39] until the fullness of him is manifested
[28:42] that's the death
[28:45] you die
[28:46] you disappear
[28:50] you should always the prophet said be
[28:52] conscious of the how little you become
[28:54] every other day and how big he is
[28:57] because the bigger he becomes in you the
[29:00] the more Victorious you are
[29:05] but the more you are still around the
[29:07] more the failures because you keep
[29:10] relying on your thinking and looking at
[29:12] situations but now when you are above
[29:15] there that's why John the type of the
[29:18] Bride after the message the Civil
[29:19] changes was invited to come up here come
[29:22] up here and start looking at the things
[29:24] the way I look at them put on my own
[29:25] goggles
[29:28] see the way I see look at the situations
[29:31] the way I see them
[29:36] arguments questions
[29:38] foolishness
[29:40] he he revealed he didn't reveal this was
[29:43] open this was not open come up here
[29:46] see the way I see it it's not it's
[29:49] broken but it's not broken yes
[29:52] that's true that's why brother brother
[29:54] he's preaching to two groups
[29:58] that's why whenever you come to the
[30:00] salmon you would say Do you believe me
[30:01] to be God is Prophet I I mean God's
[30:04] servant why did he say that
[30:06] two groups
[30:08] not all of them would be comfortable for
[30:10] him being a prophet
[30:12] so he was a prophet to a generation
[30:15] so he would address himself as a prophet
[30:17] to the few and as a servant to others
[30:22] so those who are in the public Gallery
[30:25] would look at him as a servant and those
[30:27] who are in the private
[30:29] room they classified people for a
[30:33] classified message they will take him as
[30:35] a prophet that's why he always
[30:36] introduced you believe me to be God is
[30:38] Prophet I mean his servant
[30:42] and that's why he says it's broke but
[30:44] it's not broken to the public yes that's
[30:47] the truth the 70 series is not broken
[30:48] Republic but it is revealing it is
[30:52] revealed and I mean it he cannot explain
[30:55] it
[30:57] because once he explains it then that's
[31:00] the end of faith
[31:02] so where is the natural element going to
[31:04] work
[31:08] glory be to God
[31:10] so now he comes here
[31:15] he's rebuking this second state
[31:19] Jesus himself
[31:21] saying oh fools
[31:24] he's the only disciples
[31:27] so that doesn't what does that mean you
[31:30] can be a good believer
[31:32] but foolishness doesn't respect that
[31:38] you begin to doubt
[31:40] to question
[31:44] what you really believe
[31:46] and that's the most dangerous unbelief
[31:49] the unbelief of the believer
[31:55] now the most dangerous people we have to
[31:57] deal with in the end time and not
[32:00] denominations and not the Pentecostals
[32:02] are not even Catholics and so forth it
[32:05] is those backseatings from the message
[32:13] so hot
[32:16] why are you slow
[32:18] curious
[32:22] to observing
[32:25] using your mind
[32:28] to try to navigate yourself around it
[32:33] does it make sense
[32:39] it doesn't make sense
[32:45] but in the language of Faith it's very
[32:48] sensible
[32:52] blessed be the name of the Lord
[32:55] in this our minds it doesn't make sense
[33:02] even they believe in yourself that you
[33:04] even exist if you question yourself a
[33:07] thousand times who am I how did I come
[33:09] here am I really a human being am I
[33:11] really what I am you'll end up being a
[33:13] fool and stupid
[33:15] you you can't even think about how he
[33:18] created this the stars and all all this
[33:21] person you know your mind stops
[33:31] blessed be the name of the Lord
[33:34] so why shouldn't you die the righteous
[33:38] man is death
[33:40] why should you die the Fool's death
[33:46] because these are the the things that
[33:49] the food the death of a fool
[33:53] is what's going on now
[33:56] and David is crying
[33:58] why would abuna die like a fool
[34:09] your hands were not tied
[34:12] your mouth was not closed your feet were
[34:15] not tied in a fetus
[34:18] you were standing walking seeing with
[34:22] your hands able to pick your sword
[34:25] and fight
[34:28] Glory oh God
[34:30] why would you fall into these cheap
[34:33] tricks of the devil
[34:35] you have your ears that can listen to
[34:38] the message that can study the message
[34:40] that you can read the Bible you have
[34:42] needs that you can go and kneel and pray
[34:44] on the seek God you are God is there for
[34:47] you you can seek another video you don't
[34:49] have to seek God through another person
[34:51] depend through another person God is
[34:54] your father
[34:55] why are you fearing to speak to God why
[34:58] are you fearing to seek God
[35:01] why are you trying to buy ideas of men
[35:03] what what is you that's why Jesus said
[35:06] tell me whom do you say I am don't tell
[35:09] me what others are saying about me tell
[35:11] me what is your personal revelation whom
[35:14] do you say I am
[35:20] okay
[35:21] and then we have this study level of
[35:23] foolishness
[35:26] when you come here in Galatians chapter
[35:28] 3 in verse 1 he says oh foolish
[35:31] Galatians this is Paul
[35:36] foolish Galatians
[35:40] who has Bewitched you
[35:42] that you should not obey the truth
[35:45] so the problem now was obeying the truth
[35:48] they knew the truth but obeyed was now
[35:52] the problem
[35:55] and because they failed to obey it they
[35:57] started backsliding just like when
[35:59] you're riding a bicycle you're only you
[36:01] know able to balance and go when you're
[36:03] moving but when you stop you have to
[36:05] fall down
[36:10] all foolish Galatians who has Bewitched
[36:12] to you that you should not obey the
[36:14] truth before whose eyes Jesus Christ has
[36:17] been evidently set forth crucified among
[36:20] you and he comes down and says this only
[36:23] would I know none of you receive ye the
[36:27] speed receive Thee the Spirit by The
[36:28] Works of the law or by the hearing of
[36:31] Faith are you so foolish having begun in
[36:34] the spirit and now being made perfect by
[36:38] the flesh
[36:40] have you suffered so many things in vain
[36:43] if it yet be in vain
[36:48] you suffer so many years you live by so
[36:52] many years you cherish the message and
[36:55] you begin to doubt it at the time of the
[36:57] rapture
[36:59] thank you
[37:02] what should the devil hinder you
[37:06] from your victory what is your end
[37:09] supposed to be
[37:11] the end of a defeated
[37:13] or the end of a Victor
[37:19] blessed be the name of the Lord maybe
[37:21] this is not a good someone
[37:22] for the first time preaching him
[37:31] blessed be the name of the Lord
[37:34] now look at that your hands definitely
[37:37] saying thy hands were not died
[37:45] and the prophet the Bible says God
[37:47] speaks to the mouth and fulfills with
[37:49] the hand
[37:52] and you are both in the mouth and in the
[37:54] hand
[37:56] because if you only spews you out of his
[37:59] mouth when you become lukewarm
[38:03] [Laughter]
[38:06] but when you are ready hold Christian
[38:08] you remain in the mouth of God in other
[38:11] words whatever God spoke the word of God
[38:14] you were part of the mouth that's pocket
[38:17] yes
[38:20] and then also you are part of the hand
[38:23] that fulfills it because the Bible says
[38:25] I've engraved your names in the palms of
[38:27] my hands
[38:31] so the speaking of it and the fulfilling
[38:34] of it you are part of it
[38:36] you can't deny it you can't change
[38:38] around
[38:42] so your hands are not tied
[38:45] God has not tied the hands of the church
[38:49] and that's why Jesus said the works that
[38:51] I do
[38:52] shall you do also
[38:58] I was talking to one brother the other
[39:00] day I said brother Abraham
[39:01] how is it that good as you can use you
[39:04] like that it becomes you know very
[39:06] special in the message I said
[39:09] who say that Miracles and Son wonders
[39:12] are special
[39:16] when the day becomes special to
[39:17] Christianity
[39:20] who said he praying for a lemon walk is
[39:22] special or a blind man to see or a
[39:25] cancer who say that is special
[39:28] by the way we don't have it in our
[39:30] language as a miracle
[39:32] because God raising them a lemon man is
[39:35] not a miracle in his language there's no
[39:37] miracle in his vocabulary that's what he
[39:39] does
[39:41] it's a miracle to the world
[39:43] not to a believer
[39:47] it's a miracle a miracle mean it's like
[39:48] something that you didn't expect
[39:50] something that
[39:51] is out of the ordinary sect you know it
[39:55] is it's outlandish
[40:00] but it's opening of the eyes outlandish
[40:04] is it a miracle to me it's not a miracle
[40:09] Jesus did it the disciples did it
[40:11] brother Branham was doing it
[40:14] and here we are prophesying again in
[40:16] this day
[40:20] but now the devil wants to make it like
[40:22] something conspicuous
[40:25] and whoever is doing his conspicuous and
[40:27] he wants to become a big man out of it
[40:29] because he's able to do it
[40:32] you are nothing is a gift it's God in
[40:35] you doing it so when did it become you
[40:41] so he says why should we suffer all
[40:44] these things and then end up failing
[40:47] why should we live below our privileges
[40:52] to God has you know measure and given us
[41:01] he says
[41:02] did you receive the spirit and then he
[41:05] comes here are you so foolish that you
[41:07] began in a spirit and now you are being
[41:09] made perfect in the flesh
[41:11] and you have suffered so many things
[41:12] like in vain
[41:14] blessed be the name of the Lord
[41:18] can we suffer all these things all these
[41:20] years
[41:21] no
[41:24] I must make it
[41:26] and that's why brother Branham says let
[41:28] my end be
[41:30] the end of the righteous man
[41:35] yes brother ended when he was rejected
[41:38] by the world rejected by friends Almost
[41:41] by himself but he said I thank God he
[41:45] stood with me
[41:49] he had not diminished in anointing he
[41:53] only diminished in it for him
[41:56] but are we here for him no
[42:00] we are not even looking for friends
[42:03] and have not come to Phoenix to look for
[42:05] friends
[42:09] if you are one of the attributes you'll
[42:11] be my friend whether you want it or not
[42:14] because it's the time that the
[42:16] attributes are fellowshipping together
[42:18] they are looking for one another so it's
[42:21] a fellowship of the attributes not the
[42:22] fellowship of just human beings
[42:25] so many beings will give you the right
[42:27] hand of followers you say God bless you
[42:28] brother God bless you Sister God bless
[42:30] you God bless you God bless you but down
[42:32] in the house they're not even with you
[42:35] so I love you I love you but it doesn't
[42:37] even love you that's the Fellowship of
[42:39] the right hand
[42:40] leave your right hand of fell as your
[42:42] brother oh oh you have started the
[42:44] church we are praying for you brother we
[42:45] love you God bless you hey we give you
[42:48] the right hand of Fellowship but the
[42:49] heart is saying I wish it even collapses
[42:51] tomorrow
[43:05] that's why even the mark of the beast is
[43:07] also in the hand
[43:09] and the forehead the right hand we are
[43:12] all breathing we are all Christians we
[43:14] all believe Christ
[43:17] we part one another on the shoulders as
[43:18] we should wish one another well we wish
[43:20] you success
[43:21] but not from the heart
[43:26] so don't even look for friends
[43:28] don't even fret and be you know like
[43:31] sorrowful because you don't have friends
[43:35] as long as you are with the what as long
[43:38] as he is with you as long as he's in you
[43:41] the right friends will come
[43:48] blessed be the name of the Lord
[43:50] so what are we looking at
[43:54] your hands were not tied
[43:57] and you die like a fool
[44:01] your mouth is not shut
[44:04] you have a mouth that can speak that can
[44:07] pray that can speak the word and it
[44:09] comes to pass
[44:10] you have a heart that believes the holy
[44:13] spirit is still there
[44:17] why do you die like a fool
[44:21] blessed be the name of the Lord
[44:26] so the prophet continues here to say
[44:28] something
[44:36] he says now we are finite
[44:38] we can say this is right
[44:41] today and tomorrow we can find something
[44:43] different
[44:44] we can be better we can become better we
[44:47] got a better
[44:48] we we build better houses than we did a
[44:51] hundred years ago we got better cars
[44:53] than we had 200 years ago
[44:55] we got better transportation whatever
[44:57] more you want to go into we are better
[45:00] because we are learning
[45:02] so human beings can be even able they
[45:04] are designed to make themselves better
[45:10] what about when God joins the friend
[45:12] when God comes in
[45:17] transformation
[45:19] takes place
[45:27] I want us to go back to here in the
[45:30] Bible I'm trying to read something in
[45:32] the scriptures here for us
[45:34] when you come here in the book of Second
[45:37] Kings
[45:41] second Kings chapter seven
[45:47] I hope my English my accent is
[45:50] you're picking it
[45:51] [Laughter]
[45:57] I'm not a Landy person so
[46:13] anniversary
[46:15] he says and there were four Holy Cross
[46:17] men at the entering of the gate and they
[46:20] said one to the other why City we hear
[46:23] until we die
[46:26] in other words we die as fools
[46:32] we have to do something about this
[46:39] and this was the most rejected outcasts
[46:43] of society at that time
[46:45] they were not among the elite
[46:48] they were really rejects of society
[46:51] but God is putting into them a mystery
[46:55] that is going to serve
[46:57] so many people
[47:02] and they are saying why should we sit
[47:04] here until we die
[47:07] if we say we will enter into the city
[47:10] then the farming is in the city
[47:15] what was the city they had come out of
[47:17] the city
[47:19] so now put on your spiritual eyes what
[47:22] was the city was the world we came out
[47:24] of the world because there was farming
[47:27] in the city that's why we came out of
[47:29] the city looking for something to
[47:31] survive outside but now outside also in
[47:34] the wilderness so to speak
[47:36] out of Egypt we came to the wilderness
[47:39] but we are not supposed to survive in
[47:41] the wilderness we have to survive in the
[47:44] promised land but in the promised land
[47:46] there is an enemy there are enemies
[47:48] there
[47:52] so we can't go back to the city because
[47:55] there is farming in the city and death
[47:57] in the city if we sit here we are also
[48:00] going to die
[48:02] but the food is where the enemy is
[48:10] if we want to live
[48:13] the food is where the enemies are
[48:19] that's where God has put the food
[48:23] you hold the finger and we go to here in
[48:26] the book in the New Testament in the
[48:27] book of Hebrews
[48:29] and I want you to look at this as we
[48:31] compare scriptures Hebrews chapter 10
[48:33] verse 18 He says now they just shall
[48:36] live by faith not by sight not by
[48:38] circumstance not by condition not my
[48:40] surrounding
[48:44] not by experience
[48:48] where what we experienced backer there
[48:51] if we go back and use our experience no
[48:56] so he says
[48:58] but if any man brought back that is go
[49:01] back into the city
[49:05] my soul shall have no pleasure in him
[49:07] this is Paul writing
[49:10] if you go backwards no pleasure
[49:14] because we are not designed to go
[49:15] backwards
[49:17] there is only person go forward
[49:23] so you better tell yourself that I'm
[49:27] designed not to go backwards I have no
[49:30] life no future backer there I have no
[49:34] inheritance backer there I have no peace
[49:37] backer there in the world that I come
[49:40] from no
[49:45] they just shall live by faith what is
[49:48] faith faith is believing in the word of
[49:50] God and you die so you die
[49:53] the death of Faith the death of a
[49:56] righteous person and when you are
[49:57] willing to Die the death of a righteous
[49:59] person that you are not fearing your
[50:01] enemy then you die and when you die he
[50:06] that is in you is the one who says I am
[50:08] now who's the one who is going to fight
[50:10] your battles the battle is the Lord is
[50:12] not yours so it as long as you are alive
[50:15] you will see the enemy as yours
[50:18] my enemies are many the enemies are many
[50:21] the castles are many the failures are
[50:23] many the diseases are many have
[50:25] inherited my mother's disease the
[50:27] disease that killed my father this is
[50:28] the 70 minutes trying to kill me you
[50:31] look and see because there will be your
[50:33] enemies but when you die the death of a
[50:35] righteous man and you have died to
[50:37] yourself to your thinking your reasoning
[50:39] then is Christ Living in you you live by
[50:42] that faith
[50:44] when you accept to die so this the
[50:47] select Paras men were willing to die
[50:51] but they didn't die because they were
[50:53] willing to die but those who were not
[50:56] willing to die died because no because
[50:59] they were not willing to die
[51:05] but those who are willing to go to the
[51:07] enemies place and die they didn't die
[51:10] because when they died by faith to their
[51:13] own feelings
[51:14] God started fighting for them
[51:20] so you should be willing to die
[51:23] to you
[51:26] because you are food is in the enemy's
[51:29] territory
[51:32] it's not elsewhere else it's not in
[51:35] another place I want us to catch that
[51:37] revelation
[51:38] you are food
[51:40] is in the land where the enemy is
[51:44] and I can prove to you that by the
[51:47] scripture you come in any verse that he
[51:49] says but we are not of them
[51:52] who draw back unto partition so going
[51:55] back to the city is death
[52:00] stay where we are Wilderness death
[52:07] yeah
[52:09] the only solution is going to the land
[52:12] of promise but in the land of promise
[52:14] they are Americans they are Gaga sites
[52:17] they are jebusites they are Philistines
[52:19] they are always being you know demon is
[52:21] an enemy forces ready and then the
[52:24] prophet says even if the land is
[52:26] promised to you you have to fight for
[52:28] every inch of it
[52:31] that's where your food is
[52:38] not here
[52:40] you want to stay here you are going to
[52:42] die
[52:43] you have to stay where the enemy is not
[52:45] you are going to die
[52:47] because the enemy is not here but
[52:49] there's no so no food here
[52:53] where the enemy is not there's no food
[52:56] where the enemy is there is food
[53:02] so where are you going
[53:04] back to the denominations no
[53:08] we left because there is hunger there
[53:11] almost 8 verse 11 there is famine
[53:15] that's why we left that's why we came to
[53:18] this message now we are like in the
[53:20] wilderness
[53:26] is the Judgment seat
[53:29] who is to be judged and where is the
[53:32] judgments in the house of God you are
[53:34] ready to be judged and that's why you
[53:36] say Amen to the word even when it's
[53:38] hitting you amen doesn't mean it it's
[53:41] wonderful it's good how many minutes is
[53:44] the truth
[53:45] so whether it is hurting you piercing
[53:47] you cutting you but you are saying amen
[53:49] I accept that judgment I take the
[53:52] verdict I am wrong this man must die
[53:55] that's why we come here so that he dies
[53:58] completely he's condemned
[54:06] blessed be the name of the Lord I wish I
[54:09] could invite brother Aaron to start
[54:11] preaching from there
[54:14] I'm not a good one now
[54:17] the glory be to God
[54:19] now I want us to look at something which
[54:22] is hidden here in the scripture which
[54:24] was prophetic
[54:26] concerning the land of promise
[54:31] when you come to the Book of Numbers
[54:32] Chapter 14.
[54:38] when they brought a report
[54:42] about the promised land the report was
[54:45] and the enemy magnifying the report
[54:49] enemy praising report
[54:55] and every time the devil wants he
[54:58] rejoices when you talk about the devil
[55:00] is doing this the devil is doing this
[55:01] the devil is doing this the devil the
[55:03] devil Satan Satan Satan the Devil the
[55:05] devil the devil the devil
[55:09] what about Jesus
[55:19] and those who are failing are the ones
[55:22] who have gone there they are failing
[55:24] those who have never gone there can you
[55:26] imagine those who went there the prophet
[55:28] said those are preachers
[55:30] they went and got the evidence and
[55:33] tested the word they got the Revelation
[55:35] they got this they thought they even
[55:37] carried the evidence they proved that
[55:39] the land is good but
[55:47] we were like grasshoppers
[55:50] they reduced themselves to have
[55:52] Grasshoppers and you know what
[55:53] grasshoppers means Wanderers unto death
[56:00] grasshoppers have no territory
[56:02] they are born to move
[56:05] to eat in order to grow old and die
[56:09] while they are moving and that's because
[56:11] they call themselves grasshoppers
[56:13] grasshoppers they became
[56:16] they wandered in the wilderness 40 years
[56:18] until they died
[56:20] I'm feeling well
[56:24] wow the moment you begin to accept a
[56:27] Doctrine a statement a saying a habit a
[56:31] life that praises the devil
[56:35] that magnifies the enemy
[56:39] and belittles he that is in you
[56:42] you are finished
[56:46] you become a grasshopper
[56:48] you have hope from grass to grass
[56:51] from meeting to meeting from convention
[56:53] to Convention preacher to preacher
[56:56] Church to church
[56:58] very good and you'll never be satisfied
[57:01] until you die you'll never possess that
[57:05] which is yours but you eat that which
[57:08] you find
[57:14] so now we see
[57:16] in the chapter 14 number Chapter 14
[57:19] verse 1 and all the congregations of
[57:21] their voices and cried
[57:23] and the people wept that night
[57:28] um
[57:31] and all the children of Israel my mother
[57:34] against Moses that's what they do
[57:37] when people fail to go and possess the
[57:39] land they begin to Mama again there's
[57:41] the prophet
[57:43] he didn't teach it well he didn't preach
[57:46] it well he didn't
[57:49] okay
[57:50] I'm just trying to bring it slowly so
[57:52] that we understand
[57:56] Moses and against Aaron that is the
[57:58] pastor now
[58:00] any Pastor who preaches the truth you
[58:02] had a problem yeah
[58:07] you know what they are saying who
[58:10] God
[58:12] we wish we
[58:13] wish God we die in the land of we had
[58:16] died in the land of Egypt
[58:18] oh to God we died in this Wilderness
[58:21] they cast themselves
[58:27] we are fearing the land of the enemy
[58:31] but that's their land of promise
[58:34] and they expected the god to first of
[58:35] all kill all the enemies there before
[58:38] they go no
[58:41] no
[58:44] the land that floweth with milk and
[58:46] honey yes
[58:48] but it's full of giants who want to kill
[58:51] you
[58:54] are you ready to die the death of a
[58:57] righteous man or die as a fool
[59:00] sit here either
[59:04] until we die
[59:09] do you know these days we are living in
[59:11] the days of idleness
[59:16] even to lift up your hand is a problem
[59:19] you are too tired
[59:22] even to kneel in the church here on seek
[59:25] God come and seek God
[59:28] praying and fasting as an individual
[59:31] seeking God no
[59:37] so I do as if the devil is not there
[59:41] anymore as if Satan is taking a leave
[59:51] you come to church here friends let me
[59:53] speak to you personally
[59:56] you come in church
[1:00:00] the song only that opens the service for
[1:00:02] you by praying
[1:00:05] then maybe a deacon or some brother
[1:00:07] Minister comes and prays for the prayer
[1:00:09] requests
[1:00:11] and then they pray for the offerings and
[1:00:13] tithesis
[1:00:15] and then the preacher comes and prays
[1:00:16] and preaches
[1:00:18] and after he has preached he prays
[1:00:21] and then there's somebody that comes and
[1:00:23] dismisses you
[1:00:25] what have you done
[1:00:31] I do
[1:00:41] and
[1:00:42] it is called a House of Prayer okay
[1:00:45] who prayed
[1:00:49] everything that has to be done in the
[1:00:51] church the devil wants us to feel like
[1:00:54] they should do it for us
[1:00:57] all the prayers that are prayed here
[1:00:59] they pray for us
[1:01:02] it's like a spirit of Catholicism coming
[1:01:05] upon us
[1:01:06] Mary Mother of God pray for us sinners
[1:01:12] for us we can't pray
[1:01:15] because we can't connect with Mr God
[1:01:21] you come in the church you leave the
[1:01:23] church doors there you go you've not
[1:01:25] spoken to your god no
[1:01:28] all the prayers that they prayed
[1:01:30] somebody else prayed for you
[1:01:33] so what are you doing I know
[1:01:37] you reach home you eat maybe you say a
[1:01:40] few hours before your meal and after
[1:01:42] eating feeling sleepy you go and sleep
[1:01:45] no family altar not studying in the
[1:01:48] Bible nor listening to the message not
[1:01:52] holding your children together reading
[1:01:55] with them the Bible praying together
[1:01:58] who is going to pray for your family
[1:02:00] better than you
[1:02:03] who will pray for your husband better
[1:02:04] than you could pray for your wife better
[1:02:07] than you who will pray for your children
[1:02:08] he'll claim them
[1:02:12] and we send all these words that
[1:02:13] WhatsApp groups pray for so and so pray
[1:02:16] for sister so pray for what about you
[1:02:20] Idol
[1:02:23] you want others to pray for you
[1:02:27] something's wrong somewhere
[1:02:30] we must wake up we can't see the idol
[1:02:35] when death is around us it's killing
[1:02:38] people people are dying
[1:02:40] so and so you knew whom he was your
[1:02:43] brother your neighbor your sister whom
[1:02:46] you started you believed the message
[1:02:47] with is now dead he's in the world has
[1:02:50] left the message can't you know that
[1:02:52] something serious is going on
[1:02:56] you ate a press into who you are dead
[1:03:01] you rather die the death of a righteous
[1:03:03] man or you are going to die as a fool
[1:03:08] and when you die the death of a
[1:03:10] righteous you leave because your
[1:03:12] righteous shall live by faith
[1:03:15] they just shall live by faith faith in
[1:03:17] the word
[1:03:19] so when this fall lepers were willing to
[1:03:23] go and die
[1:03:25] rather than die where there is food
[1:03:27] rather than die where there is no food
[1:03:29] they didn't die
[1:03:35] now let's look at what the Bible is
[1:03:37] saying let's go down here in chapter 14
[1:03:39] of the Book of Numbers
[1:03:46] now listen and the children of Israel
[1:03:48] Mama against Moses and are gone against
[1:03:50] Aaron and the whole congregation said
[1:03:53] unto them that we had died in the land
[1:03:56] of Egypt oh to God we had died in this
[1:04:00] wilderness
[1:04:01] wherefore has the Lord brought us up
[1:04:03] into this land to Fall by the squad that
[1:04:07] our wives and our children should be
[1:04:10] pray weighed not better for us to return
[1:04:13] into Egypt go back to the city
[1:04:19] but why did you come out
[1:04:24] the the leper said if we go back we
[1:04:28] shall die
[1:04:29] because there is family there
[1:04:31] if we stay here type of the Wilderness
[1:04:33] we shall die
[1:04:36] but if we go where the enemies
[1:04:41] where everybody is scared
[1:04:45] where are we also we're scared up to now
[1:04:49] but we now have no option but to believe
[1:04:53] that going to the enemy we are going to
[1:04:55] survive
[1:04:57] and we are going not to fight but God is
[1:05:00] going to fight
[1:05:02] not me but he that is in me
[1:05:05] now listen at this revelation
[1:05:12] verse 6 quickly just to speak at him
[1:05:15] and Joshua that's the type of the Holy
[1:05:17] Spirit
[1:05:18] the son of noon and Caleb the type of
[1:05:21] the believer the bride today the son of
[1:05:23] Jeffrey which of them that search the
[1:05:26] land rent their clothes
[1:05:29] now listen
[1:05:31] and they spoke and all the compatible
[1:05:33] with the children of Israel saying they
[1:05:35] land which we pass through to search it
[1:05:37] is an exceedingly good land
[1:05:40] good land
[1:05:42] but full of the enemies
[1:05:45] now listen to this in verse 8.
[1:05:49] 9 if the Lord Delight in us then he will
[1:05:53] bring us up into the land and give it to
[1:05:56] us
[1:05:57] a land which floweth with milk and honey
[1:05:59] verse 9 only Rebellion you not against
[1:06:03] the Lord neither fear ye the people of
[1:06:06] the land listen now for they are bred
[1:06:09] for us
[1:06:12] oh
[1:06:18] so the enemies
[1:06:22] where the enemy is
[1:06:24] that's your food
[1:06:29] prophetically Spoken Here
[1:06:33] the lepers are picking that and saying
[1:06:35] where the enemies
[1:06:39] that is my foot if I don't tackle the
[1:06:41] enemy I'll die
[1:06:43] I'll die of hunger fighting the enemy
[1:06:46] possessing the enemy's land is my foot
[1:06:48] that's where God has put my food
[1:06:53] but which you fear is where your
[1:06:55] spiritual strength is that's where you
[1:06:58] are going to derive your strength your
[1:07:00] that's your food we are the enemies but
[1:07:03] the devil doesn't want you to go we are
[1:07:06] the enemies
[1:07:07] he wants to sow a seed of fear in you so
[1:07:09] that you die the death of a fool
[1:07:12] who doesn't trust any God who doesn't
[1:07:14] believe that God is with me
[1:07:18] a fool has said in his heart there is no
[1:07:20] God
[1:07:23] I don't feel good I think I have to feel
[1:07:28] I think I have not got enough experience
[1:07:31] I can't tackle this I as a foolishness
[1:07:36] so what are you doing about it if you
[1:07:39] think you don't have the Holy Spirit
[1:07:40] what have you done
[1:07:44] the Bible says pray the Bible says seek
[1:07:47] ask God that is a promise the promises
[1:07:50] unto you and to your children and as men
[1:07:52] as the Lord Our God shall call so if the
[1:07:55] Lord has called you why don't you say
[1:07:56] Lord I need my Holy Spirit what have you
[1:07:59] done about it I don't
[1:08:02] and you want to die the death of a fool
[1:08:10] sitting here you die going back in the
[1:08:12] world you die
[1:08:15] going where your possession is even when
[1:08:18] the enemy is there you are going to
[1:08:20] leave because your enemies your food
[1:08:22] this is what the prophecy is saying
[1:08:27] those people in the land the enemies who
[1:08:31] are holding us from the promises are our
[1:08:34] food
[1:08:35] our bread
[1:08:40] that disease plaguing you that cancer is
[1:08:43] the food because it's a it's the raw
[1:08:45] material for a testimony how are you
[1:08:47] going to get a testimony without a test
[1:08:51] how are you going to say the Lord
[1:08:52] healing me if you were not sick
[1:08:56] now when you begin to get scared of your
[1:08:58] okay he has already gotten you what are
[1:08:59] you going to do
[1:09:04] sit there and surrender to fit and die
[1:09:09] or do something about it
[1:09:15] you go right where the enemy is there
[1:09:18] attack of the enemy possess the land
[1:09:21] that's your promise and say this is mine
[1:09:23] give it
[1:09:26] this is mine this belongs to me if it's
[1:09:28] Deliverance is mine now you know faith
[1:09:30] is not just knowing that God is able God
[1:09:32] is going to do it as long as you say God
[1:09:34] is going to do it you are a Friend of
[1:09:35] the Devil
[1:09:36] because that anything in the in the
[1:09:38] future you are really siding with the
[1:09:40] Enemy
[1:09:43] you shouldn't even claim your promises
[1:09:45] and put them tomorrow
[1:09:47] today
[1:09:49] because if you say God will heal me next
[1:09:51] year or next month or next whatever
[1:09:54] you have already excluded yourself from
[1:09:56] the manifestation of it because one day
[1:09:58] with the Lord is a thousand years so if
[1:10:00] you put yourself in the next day then
[1:10:02] you will die before you receive the
[1:10:04] blessing
[1:10:09] huh
[1:10:14] why do we sit there idle doing nothing
[1:10:17] when we can do something about a
[1:10:19] situation why should you surrender to
[1:10:21] Fair Transit away when their obvious
[1:10:24] options provided in the word laying
[1:10:26] right before you
[1:10:30] so they decided to Die the death of
[1:10:32] believers who can possess the Gate of
[1:10:35] their enemies by faith because that was
[1:10:37] that was what was promised to Abraham
[1:10:41] rather die fighting the enemy than die
[1:10:44] the death of unbelief
[1:10:47] but how do I die fighting the enemy
[1:10:50] I don't die
[1:10:52] I have a guarantee that I don't die
[1:10:57] I only die to the flesh
[1:11:01] and not all of us are even going to die
[1:11:03] physically
[1:11:04] some of us the Rapture is going to find
[1:11:06] us alive
[1:11:08] so you don't have even to die physically
[1:11:12] but you have to die to yourself to your
[1:11:14] feelings and you are reasoning and
[1:11:15] understanding of the word and then you
[1:11:17] say Lord I surrender to you
[1:11:21] as a younger woman as a young girl as a
[1:11:23] younger boy I cannot survive in this age
[1:11:26] with my own thinking I have to die to
[1:11:29] myself
[1:11:32] I cannot even understand this message
[1:11:35] by my brains God cannot be understood by
[1:11:39] your mind
[1:11:41] you have to die to your mind and let the
[1:11:43] mind of Christ come into you
[1:11:44] [Music]
[1:11:50] blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:11:54] this is what I'm wanting to understand
[1:11:56] friends
[1:11:57] what you are fearing is your food
[1:12:01] so when you fear it
[1:12:04] you'll starve to death
[1:12:07] but God has put your position I mean
[1:12:10] your possession where your fear is
[1:12:13] that's why job said the thing that I
[1:12:16] greatly feared is what has come to me
[1:12:24] don't even sit there and begin to
[1:12:26] imagine a certain disease that you fear
[1:12:28] that's what will come to you
[1:12:33] and then when it comes it's like I'm
[1:12:35] finished
[1:12:36] I I can't do nothing about it this is
[1:12:39] you came here finished this is becoming
[1:12:41] but how many people have we prayed for
[1:12:43] who had become you came here given six
[1:12:45] months three months four months to die
[1:12:47] and they are living 10 20 years down the
[1:12:49] road
[1:12:56] glory be to God
[1:13:03] just think about it
[1:13:05] so the prophet says
[1:13:21] he says he wasn't just to go around and
[1:13:24] say well he told me that yes I believe
[1:13:27] it he did something about it oh brother
[1:13:31] sister do you see what I mean
[1:13:34] he just he didn't just sit there and say
[1:13:37] said so he done something about it if
[1:13:40] you want to get saved this morning God
[1:13:42] promised salvation then do something
[1:13:45] about it don't just sit there don't Join
[1:13:49] one church and take your letter from
[1:13:51] church to church he promised salvation
[1:13:53] and deliverance
[1:13:55] if you are sick why sit there
[1:13:58] as the leper say that day when the city
[1:14:01] was besieged why City we here until we
[1:14:04] we die
[1:14:06] he says when Samaria was beseeched by
[1:14:08] the syrians they said why sit here till
[1:14:11] we die we will always be here we will
[1:14:13] die right here if we go in the city we
[1:14:16] they are dying in the city there from
[1:14:18] starvation let's go down to the Campbell
[1:14:20] the enemy and then they Prophet say oh
[1:14:22] my what what a faith they should have
[1:14:25] had
[1:14:29] going to where the enemies
[1:14:32] to eat
[1:14:34] [Laughter]
[1:14:36] you are going there
[1:14:38] looking for food that means they had the
[1:14:41] faith that they were going to eat
[1:14:44] otherwise they would have gone their
[1:14:46] faith was not looking for death
[1:14:48] their faith was to look for food
[1:14:51] so they went you cannot eat when you are
[1:14:53] dead
[1:14:54] they had a revelation that when we got
[1:14:56] there we are going to find food we are
[1:14:58] going to eat so in other words they had
[1:15:02] the inner part telling them you're not
[1:15:04] going to die although be ready for death
[1:15:07] not to die
[1:15:10] be ready to die to your thinking not to
[1:15:13] die
[1:15:13] but if you are not ready to die then
[1:15:16] you'll die
[1:15:20] yeah
[1:15:21] glory be to the name of the Lord
[1:15:25] so he says what a faith they could have
[1:15:28] what they got Camp of the enemy who was
[1:15:31] trying to kill them trying to kill them
[1:15:35] that's why the Assyrians were there
[1:15:38] and the devil is trying to kill us
[1:15:42] this is what you I want you to notice
[1:15:44] that everywhere else there is death
[1:15:48] everything else has died
[1:15:50] every denomination is dead
[1:15:52] that's why there is now death
[1:15:55] surrounding this message because this
[1:15:57] only this is the only place where there
[1:16:00] is still life
[1:16:07] life is just in this world you know
[1:16:10] that's why you see every bag every demon
[1:16:13] every spirit is attacking the message
[1:16:18] because everywhere else death has
[1:16:19] finished
[1:16:24] so he says they go to they come
[1:16:27] of the enemy that I was trying to kill
[1:16:28] them
[1:16:29] but I said if we die we are going to die
[1:16:31] anyhow
[1:16:36] and they went down there and God honored
[1:16:38] that little speck of doing a faith
[1:16:43] that little faith
[1:16:48] that they had
[1:16:50] and not only delivered themselves but
[1:16:52] delivered all Israel
[1:16:55] what we need today is men and women who
[1:16:57] can take God by his word and be
[1:16:59] persistent with it
[1:17:01] God will cause the earthquakes and the
[1:17:03] shakes to go down to the camp fast
[1:17:07] that's what the prophet says when the
[1:17:09] weakest believer goes on her knees
[1:17:12] not the strongest one
[1:17:13] you think those lepers were strong
[1:17:16] they were sick
[1:17:18] they were lepers to begin with
[1:17:20] they were very weak could even started
[1:17:23] to fight
[1:17:24] maybe the fingers were cut off
[1:17:28] they had nothing physically to show off
[1:17:32] they didn't have any ability to even
[1:17:34] start with the standard Just Two
[1:17:36] Soldiers
[1:17:39] so they went completely not trusting in
[1:17:41] their abilities
[1:17:44] they were incapacitated physically
[1:17:48] but as when God comes into action
[1:17:52] when all help is gone
[1:17:56] God will cause the earthquakes and the
[1:17:58] sheikhs to go down the camp fast
[1:18:01] God will take care whether there is
[1:18:03] going to be rain up there or not and
[1:18:06] that's what God did
[1:18:08] before they stepped there God stepped
[1:18:10] there
[1:18:12] and the syrians fled
[1:18:15] the enemy went
[1:18:18] the demons went
[1:18:20] and the food remained
[1:18:24] the food remained
[1:18:26] they ate and they even told others come
[1:18:29] and eat here's the food
[1:18:33] glory be to God so he continues here and
[1:18:36] says but you but do you believe with all
[1:18:39] your heart and ready now like those men
[1:18:41] who laid and they get down there at
[1:18:44] Samaria say why is it here till we die
[1:18:46] you are going to die lying there
[1:18:51] you've got only one chance that is to
[1:18:54] accept him while you are in his princess
[1:19:00] you recognize the princess of the Lord
[1:19:02] as an individual you are in his presence
[1:19:10] and he is in you he in you create the
[1:19:14] princess
[1:19:23] now listen
[1:19:24] and believe it with all your heart the
[1:19:27] prophet says will you do that
[1:19:32] believe it will hold with your heart the
[1:19:34] biggest problem that we have is to
[1:19:37] believe what we claim to believe
[1:19:47] you know
[1:19:51] a lot of brothers have been ringing me
[1:19:53] and asking me rather how do these things
[1:19:55] happen oh hey what a special thing are
[1:19:58] you going I mean they feel like
[1:20:01] God coming down to prove his word is a
[1:20:04] new phenomenon
[1:20:07] I was even you know surprised when one
[1:20:10] Pastor was ringing me say I no longer
[1:20:11] believe in the spiritual brother
[1:20:14] I said if you don't believe in the
[1:20:16] Supernatural you don't even believe in
[1:20:18] God because God is Supernatural
[1:20:21] yeah
[1:20:23] and even the Rapture will be
[1:20:24] Supernatural
[1:20:25] so that means you're not going the
[1:20:27] rupture
[1:20:30] how is your body going to be changed in
[1:20:31] a moment in the twinkling of an eye
[1:20:35] who is going to do that religion for you
[1:20:38] who is going to be changed inside of you
[1:20:41] transformed it instead of you who is
[1:20:43] going to press the button for you
[1:20:50] blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:20:55] so God is going to ask us a question I
[1:20:58] want just to begin I mean finish by
[1:21:00] saying this
[1:21:02] there is something that you're supposed
[1:21:04] to do
[1:21:09] and to be ready to go to that place you
[1:21:12] are fearing
[1:21:14] to that level you thought you can't
[1:21:18] to say those words you thought you will
[1:21:20] never say
[1:21:21] to believe the things that you thought
[1:21:23] you'd never believe
[1:21:25] to stand in that ground that you thought
[1:21:28] you never stand
[1:21:31] that is where your food is
[1:21:33] there is perfect faith
[1:21:42] that's why the prophet he is speaking
[1:21:44] here about Jeremiah I think chapter 8
[1:21:47] from verse 19 to 22 where where the
[1:21:50] Prophet is saying the summer has ended
[1:21:54] and you are not served
[1:21:56] and then he says why is the heart of my
[1:21:59] people not healed
[1:22:07] and God is asking why
[1:22:11] that means you are the problem not God
[1:22:17] you're the problem not God
[1:22:22] yeah
[1:22:23] because he is what the prophet says here
[1:22:27] he says
[1:22:33] in the message diseases and afflictions
[1:22:35] he says there is no need of anyone going
[1:22:38] away from here without being perfectly
[1:22:41] delivered
[1:22:44] there is no need there is no reason why
[1:22:47] you are sick and the healer is here
[1:22:54] is here
[1:22:57] you think you have problems and the
[1:23:00] dissolvable problem is here so he says
[1:23:02] there is no need there's no reason of
[1:23:06] anyone going away from here without
[1:23:08] being perfectly delivered
[1:23:11] I might not have just the time for
[1:23:14] everyone at the platform the prophet
[1:23:16] says I may not be having the time to
[1:23:18] pray for everybody
[1:23:20] but everyone can benefit by it
[1:23:25] if God can prove himself here to be God
[1:23:27] and what has confirmed
[1:23:31] what I have said to be the truth then
[1:23:34] believe God he says believe God he
[1:23:36] doesn't say believe in God
[1:23:38] believe God present tense
[1:23:43] believe God
[1:23:44] then act upon your faith and put your
[1:23:48] faith as a living action and God will go
[1:23:50] to work on you right there and will make
[1:23:53] you well so you have faith but you just
[1:23:56] have to work on your faith
[1:24:01] what if you say well I'm going to see
[1:24:04] how it works out it will never work out
[1:24:06] until you keep your testimony going
[1:24:10] they overcame the devil
[1:24:12] by the blood of the lamb and by the word
[1:24:16] of their testimony
[1:24:18] but what is your testimony
[1:24:20] your testimony is not your testimony
[1:24:22] your testimony is that you are dead and
[1:24:25] Jesus is living in you
[1:24:27] so that's why the Bible says the
[1:24:29] testimony of Jesus Christ
[1:24:32] is the spirit of Prophecy so you
[1:24:35] prophesy Again by the testimony of Jesus
[1:24:38] Christ in you
[1:24:40] not your testimony
[1:24:42] you have no testimony you are a failure
[1:24:45] man is a failure to begin with
[1:24:50] but the testimony That Jesus Lives in
[1:24:52] You
[1:24:54] that is the spirit of Prophecy
[1:24:57] so he says it will never work until you
[1:24:59] keep your testimony going
[1:25:02] if you believe you are saved you believe
[1:25:05] you are saved you should act like you
[1:25:08] are saved you say you are saved and you
[1:25:11] associate with those that are saved and
[1:25:14] it works salvation is that right and the
[1:25:17] same thing will take place by Divine
[1:25:19] Healing do you believe you are healed
[1:25:21] you act like he healed you you say you
[1:25:24] are healed and he is a high priest of
[1:25:26] your confession to make good anything
[1:25:28] you confessed that he has done before
[1:25:31] the father there it is
[1:25:36] he comes down and says you know that but
[1:25:39] it's the truth as I'm standing here it
[1:25:42] is God is internal truth when you
[1:25:44] believe it and act upon your faith God
[1:25:46] will bring it to pass
[1:25:49] and then he says and the rest of you
[1:25:52] here could do the same thing at this
[1:25:54] time if you believe it
[1:25:57] up to you
[1:26:01] so God has washed everything away from
[1:26:05] himself is now on your laps
[1:26:08] it's not even brother that's why he
[1:26:10] slept
[1:26:12] and there are those who are still
[1:26:13] knocking on his door brother Brian I'm
[1:26:15] going to do this he didn't say this he
[1:26:17] didn't do this what do you want him to
[1:26:18] do
[1:26:20] he showed you Christ and he left the
[1:26:22] scene
[1:26:24] he identified a masterpiece he showed
[1:26:26] you the bridegroom and and what you want
[1:26:29] him to do
[1:26:31] and then the Brady groom you say speak
[1:26:34] say it believe it
[1:26:36] and my work will be to confirm it so
[1:26:39] what do you want Jesus to do
[1:26:44] it's you now
[1:26:47] act upon your faith
[1:26:49] it's up to you
[1:26:53] blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:26:56] so what am I saying as we finish friends
[1:27:01] that there is death
[1:27:11] and the standard against death is death
[1:27:17] when there was a death angel moving in
[1:27:19] Egypt
[1:27:20] the only standard that God gave the
[1:27:22] children of Israel was the death of a
[1:27:24] lamp
[1:27:27] so in the lamb died the blood was
[1:27:31] applied on the doors
[1:27:34] to proved that something died
[1:27:37] and I'm leaving by the death of a lamp
[1:27:39] that's the first Exodus so before any
[1:27:43] person died any animal died the lamb
[1:27:46] died
[1:27:47] that was a standard against the death
[1:27:49] was death
[1:27:51] Jesus in the second Exodus was the Lamb
[1:27:54] of God that died
[1:27:57] in order to counter the death that we
[1:27:59] were in
[1:28:01] to redeem us from death he died
[1:28:05] and today the standard against death is
[1:28:08] death
[1:28:10] when you are waiting to die to yourself
[1:28:15] and Jesus is leaving because the two of
[1:28:18] you cannot live at the same time
[1:28:20] so when you die and he leaves
[1:28:23] that is the standard against the Pale
[1:28:26] Horse Rider
[1:28:28] against death against hell
[1:28:32] and the prophet said the Father Paul
[1:28:34] will be preached to the total lost total
[1:28:36] lost are in hell and he saw hell on
[1:28:39] Earth
[1:28:40] so how did Jesus preach to the total
[1:28:42] lost in hell he died
[1:28:47] so you cannot preach to the total lost
[1:28:49] unless you die
[1:28:58] so when you are willing to die friend
[1:29:03] the death of the righteous
[1:29:09] then you are going to leave
[1:29:12] by his life
[1:29:15] you are going to overcome
[1:29:17] by his faith because faith is our
[1:29:19] victory
[1:29:26] I rather die that one today
[1:29:29] don't die the death of fools
[1:29:31] who turn around and doubt what they once
[1:29:35] believed we had trusted
[1:29:39] are you so foolish that you began in the
[1:29:42] spirit
[1:29:43] now you are perfected in the flesh
[1:29:48] foolishness
[1:29:49] the death of a fool versus the death of
[1:29:52] the righteous
[1:29:55] we should be ready and willing to Die
[1:29:58] the death of the righteous and then our
[1:30:01] end shall be like Jesus how did he end
[1:30:06] like I overcame and I'm sat with my
[1:30:09] father in his throne
[1:30:11] he that overcometh
[1:30:14] the enemy in the camp where there is
[1:30:17] food
[1:30:20] shall I grant him to come and sit with
[1:30:23] me
[1:30:25] so we in the right hour of rapture going
[1:30:27] home but how do we overcome we possess
[1:30:30] the enemies camp
[1:30:32] there is food there
[1:30:34] there is strength there there is power
[1:30:37] there
[1:30:39] power in the fact that Jesus Christ is
[1:30:42] the same yesterday today and forever and
[1:30:45] his life and power and Dynamics and
[1:30:47] Power Glory is manifested that is your
[1:30:50] food
[1:30:51] that's your strength that's the strength
[1:30:54] of the church
[1:30:57] Rapture begins right now you are being
[1:31:01] changed it's a process we are going home
[1:31:07] it's not just going to be static
[1:31:10] God is bringing us into the move the
[1:31:12] move to go home
[1:31:16] but death is moving is looming and it
[1:31:21] has taken so many and men are dying as
[1:31:23] fools
[1:31:25] dying when they once knew the truth
[1:31:32] dying has people who never knew God
[1:31:36] dying like they never knew the message
[1:31:38] of the hour
[1:31:42] the evidence is on the tops you can play
[1:31:45] the tape and hear discernment again hear
[1:31:47] the Miracles and so forth going on but
[1:31:50] we are begin to act as fools sitting
[1:31:53] there and dying
[1:31:55] when we can do something
[1:31:58] it's today today
[1:32:00] his princess is here Jesus Christ is
[1:32:02] here
[1:32:05] how many would say I want to die the
[1:32:07] death of a righteous man
[1:32:10] I don't want to die as a fool
[1:32:15] how many are ready to say I take my
[1:32:17] healing today I take my Deliverance
[1:32:19] today I'm going to pray together with
[1:32:21] you
[1:32:23] because he's here if you have a problem
[1:32:24] the prophet said there is no reason why
[1:32:27] you should leave this building and go
[1:32:29] back home with the problem
[1:32:31] he has already paid for your healing he
[1:32:34] loves you to be healthier than you love
[1:32:36] it yourself that's why he died
[1:32:39] he suffered for it he paid in that price
[1:32:44] and I want to say this
[1:32:46] that if God knew that what is in you was
[1:32:49] supposed to deliver you and change you
[1:32:51] and you fail to utilize that chance he
[1:32:54] will ask you why you didn't go ahead and
[1:32:57] possess what belonged to you why
[1:33:00] why were you not healed
[1:33:03] why did you die of cancer
[1:33:05] when I was there to heal you why didn't
[1:33:08] you go ahead to bring glory to my name
[1:33:11] why did you allow people to think that
[1:33:14] I'm no longer a Healer
[1:33:16] why did you begin to magnify the enemy
[1:33:20] instead of me why always talking about
[1:33:22] the pain the disease the egg the this
[1:33:24] and that and you are not talking about
[1:33:25] me
[1:33:27] why not testify that Jesus Is My Healer
[1:33:29] why didn't you talk like a a Believer
[1:33:32] why didn't you speak the language your
[1:33:34] faith
[1:33:35] why didn't you go on to possess the land
[1:33:38] which is yours
[1:33:40] why didn't you seek me seek it by prayer
[1:33:42] why didn't even seek it by fasting why
[1:33:45] didn't you have to seek it until you got
[1:33:48] it these people didn't sit they stood
[1:33:53] they said why do we sit let's stand up
[1:33:56] and go and possess
[1:33:59] what belongs to us they stood and they
[1:34:03] walked
[1:34:04] fearlessly
[1:34:06] to their soon enemy
[1:34:10] but because they were ready to do that
[1:34:13] they didn't even fight anybody
[1:34:15] nobody even harmed them they didn't even
[1:34:18] have to see any Shadow to scare them God
[1:34:21] had done the fighting
[1:34:23] that's how our God works
[1:34:26] may God bless you
[1:34:28] can we stand up
