TRANSCRIPT
========================================
to many even my own family keeps asking me if we're ever going to explain this and we're just kind of leaving it at that but we want to i want to kind of do another installment in this and it may actually this installment may actually be kind of a spin up to a series and i want to start by reviewing i think it was the first service that we'd ministered on kids eat free i just want to review a few things just to kind of get them lay the foundation because i want to draw from some of this and in proverbs chapter 22 verse 6 i'll give you my title here in a little bit in proverbs chapter 22 verse 6 it says train up a child in the way he should go and when he is old he will not depart from it it's important to note that it's a way that he should go so there's a way that god wants each one of us to walk there's a path that each one of us must walk in and our path in life is going to be unique than others and then even the path and calling that we have in life is going to be different than that for our children but we we have a common desire to serve god we have a common desire to walk in his precepts but here it is a way that it's a way that he should go and it says when he's old he'll not depart from it so there's a great power in the way that you train up a child and we used this scripture to refer to how children are the glory of the family and that there's actually gold in them the hidden glory of the family i think we use the title digging for gold that we have this responsibility and as it says to train up a child in the way that he should go i think we use the scripture in ephesians be their followers of god be followers of god as dear children our children have our nature and i know that might make some of us cringe a little bit but it's just it's just the way that science works that when you have give birth to a child they're going to have your nature and so a child has his parents nature and they imitate without effort it's just programmed in them it's just part of their makeup and who they are and so as parents we're either going to promote the worst that's in them or cultivate something better and we know that we're even tasked with being the holy ghost to our children until they get the holy ghost so our desire our desire is parents and our number one job as parents isn't just to bring out the worst in them of what we've given them genetically or even to bring the best out of them in terms of what their talent might be but we want to cultivate something better for our children and parenthood as we know god was the original parent and that he's the source of all parenthood uh it we it has parenthood as the greatest power to influence children has the greatest power to shape the character of a child and if we didn't believe that i believe any parents here should just be very very worried and if we didn't believe that then i think it would i would understand why someone would not want to have a child because if you do not have the ability to shape and influence your child's character then the world just has them the society has them that the day has them but we have there's a way that god has ordained parenthood to shape and form the heart of a child i think brother reggie had kind of touched on some of these points and we may have even used this exact uh statement a couple weeks ago but says the word in the world has fallen apart he says the beautiful virtue that god gave a woman to be a mother has been marred and that's the backbone of the nation you break motherhood and you've broke the nation right then that's one thing that helps hold it together real genuine parenthood so why is society eroding why do we see the morals of the country broken why do we see just a swift current moving people into insanity it's because that that part that god had chosen to anchor the family to anchor children to put them on the right path that's been broken and so that's what holds it together is real genuine parenthood not just a mother but parenthood and i we may have used this one as well i think we did in the last one it's in the message elisha the prophet and this is kind of a this is a statement that's really in your face and um and i i guess maybe brother chris you and brother ed you might have stole all the amen so we might have to start depositing making some deposits on amends but he says how can you expect your children to go to sunday school and serve the lord when you yourself don't even go how can you expect your children to be something when you're nothing that's kind of a that's a hard statement but think of how he's saying this how can you expect your children to go when you don't go how can you expect a particular standard of your children when you don't hold that standard and i think we should maybe even let this strike home and kind of get us get us in our private uh uh private parts of our lives where there's things that we might say and do as parents that we would never allow our children to say and do and maybe it's good just to kind of give pause and ask ourselves would you ever want them to do that is there any context is there any any way that you would ever want your children to behave in a similar manner and it might even operate to challenge us in terms of the things that we give preeminence he says i didn't mean you wasn't nothing but i mean when you know that you make no profession and it kind of gives these questions how can you expect your children to be righteous when you're putting such an example before them might be very easy uh to chastise our children and get onto them and try to implore them to serve god and you should do better and you shouldn't do this and you shouldn't do that but then we can also ask ourselves uh am i holding myself to the same standard am i doing the the things that that could give them the proper reflection he says how can you do it you are the best example that they have they're going to look to you when they won't look for no one else because your nature is in them that's that's that's where the real influence comes from the people in the world uh they may share certain things in common them they may be classmates they may have different associations uh maybe extended families and connections but you have a special connection to your own children because your nature is in them and by nature they're going to look to you for an example and they're even wanting to they're they're they're wanting to look to you to give them clues and to give them direction and it's a remarkable how the child's mind works even from infancy as they begin to develop that they even found that the reason why and i don't know that they were able to actually ask and it was articulated but the reason why infants and newborns or babies will drop things over and over and over again is they're learning about gravity they're learning why things why don't they go when i drop it why doesn't it go up and then and then at the same time they're learning human nature and they see that how many times is this person gonna pick this up every time i drop it because you're being responsive to that and they're actually thinking they're conscious they're processing they're like when i let go of this it falls to the ground and immediately that person comes over picks it up gives it back to me and they're wanting to learn how many times does this happen because it's part it's in their nature to to be responsive to these things and they're learning so as we said last time in digging for gold or several times ago there's glory in our children they're the hidden glory of the family and there's gold in there and if i could put it this way it's our duty to aid the prospect of christ and to put our children to position for christ to bring out the seed of god in them and the best in them as we've read from come follow me says youth men and women for tomorrow if there is a tomorrow we must train them so do we train the youth the the men and women for tomorrow we must train them we feel that burden to train them like there will be a tomorrow and perhaps it is when we do that that there will be no tomorrow that when we can take this responsibility seriously and we train them as we ought to and feel that burden to really lean into it whereas there was a time in the message where they thought it was all going to end in 1977 so maybe there wasn't a lot of thought given to how you train your children there's even a thought today i've come across where people are going to wait in the future when brother branham will be able to save the souls of all their children so they're not really that concerned about where they are now they're looking to something in the future but as i listen to the tapes as i hear the word of god as i read i realize as a parent i have a duty to train them because they're going to be the uh the men and women of tomorrow now that kind of picks us that catches us up to speed on where we were last time and i think where we're wanting to go tonight will be um will rest really well on this and so the the title for my sermon tonight is the seven bad habits of highly ineffective parents i'll leave that up there in case you can't read it i'll just keep saying it but the seven bad habits of highly ineffective parents now um when i mentioned it to my wife she said i don't like that it's negative and i said well that's the whole point because i will just be honest with you i am not qualified to speak on the seven good habits or the seven habits of highly effective parents um but i can speak with uh uh you know an expertise on what doesn't work and so the seven bad habits of highly ineffective parents i am drawing this from the seven habits of highly effective people by stephen covey and you can show that brother john and i think uh the sold over 40 million copies it's been published in 40 different languages a couple million audiobooks sold and it's probably one of the most uh this is the one of the best-selling non-fiction business books in history and so that's that's the connection is the seven bad habits of highly ineffective parents and we're kind of doing the inverse of the seven habits of highly effective people uh full disclosure i've never read the book so if if there's if there's any way that this somehow tracks whatever stephen had to say it's just all by coincidence because there's another book i read that this correlates to now here are here's a list i'll give you the list at the outset i've provided it all on one slide so that you could um you could jot these downs as you need to unless somebody provided it in bullet port format i wanted uh it just to be i might have actually have it timed there but i want you go ahead and just fast forward through all that so they're all up there i might i might have not removed the uh the action on that i just want you to see them all here because i'm not trying to hide anything and uh and i'll say that in this these seven bad habits of highly ineffective parents they're really applicable to any relationship in which two people are dependent on one another and so it's not just a parent to child but husband to wife anywhere there's mutual dependency there should never be codependency it should always be mutual dependency and so you could you could make this applicable in any really any given situation so maybe i could try to write a bestseller in response to or just kind of tracking his language and i will say also this is not doctrine in no way are we trying to establish some doctrinal paradigm uh this is not rigid these these things are not exclusive if you wanted to come up with 500 bad habits of highly ineffective parents i'd sign off on it if you wanted to narrow it down there's a lot of overlap so maybe you could do that but here they are number one to seven over emphasizing carnal things inconsistently instructing and correcting improperly judging inappropriately using voice wrongly disciplining and i have kind of tried to use some of these negative buzzwords not being an example or maybe say being a bad example but not being an example and withholding grace these are the seven bad habits of highly ineffective parents i'm sure you could look at this and say yeah i would say that if anyone is really proficient in these that's not really effective over emphasizing carnal things inconsistently instructing and correcting improperly judging inappropriately using voice wrongly disciplining not being an example and withholding grace now as you look at these what i'd like to do this evening and i meant to say this at the outset that um i was really straining just to try to find the mind of the lord for this service even leading up to it just wasn't sure which direction the lord would want me to go and there's been many different things just right there on the cusp i believe of being anointed to preach even though i've studied and find that there's tremendous inspiration there just maybe not quite ready um to minister on them and so i just really waiting on the lord and and and feeling a lot of inspiration in the word there's just maybe a lot that you could just come up and preach on but something kept resonating over and over in my mind over the last week or so that i just that my burden is something practical something practical something practical and to get into the practical things of the word of god to help us to encourage us we have a lot of needs in our lives we have a lot of needs and we want the word to meet those needs so i feel this burden to pull things out of the word of god that'll meet us right where we live and there was some things just the things that were ministered last week and on sunday and then brother reggie used the statement practical purpose and it just it just connected with the things i'd been studying on on purpose and different things and it really it really quickened to me some things uh it just brought some things together for me and i felt the door open up to minister on this and it this is a subject i administered on just a very very little bit a few years ago and never had the opportunity to fully develop it and really study it and i've been very reluctant uh since we began pastoring to to go back and just take from things i've preached before i've preached for over 20 years and preached i don't know how many sermons i've preached but i've just had this in my heart i haven't i have not wanted just to go back and pull something out that i'd preach before but just seek to find fresh inspiration time and time again and not just rehearse things that being said really if it's in the word of god there's so many wonderful things to preach and the longer we preach here you're going to find yourself you're going to find myself repeating myself because we just rehearse the word rehearse the word rehearse the word and so this is something that today the lord just kind of took whatever seal that was upon i don't want to preach things i've preached before uh at least not too much of it that just was ripped off that and i just felt this liberty to go into this subject tonight it's a little bit different maybe than how i'd prefaced it before but i'm really excited about going through these seven bad habits of highly ineffective parents now these each bad habit you can look at that again uh that slide again each bad habit has in my what i'd like to point out it has a correlation to uh a characteristic in the statue of a perfect man and when we say a correlation there is a there's a contrast so there's some connection but not necessarily in the same sense but one of these negative or bad habits when these seven bad habits is contrasted by or balanced out or uh you know the the other side of it the positive side to it can be found in the statue of a perfect man so if you look at verses five to seven and where we read in our text of the first chapter ii peter it says and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue so there's faith add to that virtue and it is something that's being expressed to us and beside beside this it means therefore thus because of this uh give all diligence to add to your faith virtue into your virtue knowledge so you could even say add to your faith virtue and add to your virtue knowledge and to your knowledge add temperance and to temperance uh you add patience and to patience godliness into godliness really kindness and breadlike kindness charity and this is what brother branham draws from these virtues or these characteristics rather and he calls them the stature of a perfect man and we know that in that pyramid uh that he drew that expresses this and we may find ourselves going into more detail even maybe studying this sermon as a part of this series but a christian expresses these characteristics from faith all the way to charity these are things that are inherent in the life that we receive upon the new birth so when you're born again all these attributes are there now they're in the soul and so the way the language that peter is using is now that there's been this newness of life let there be some development cultivation of it that we can place these virtues where they ought to be they can be made manifest and expressed brother branham referring to this is there's the perfect man of god when he possesses these virtues so this possession is maybe uh related to a placing and a pro and an expression of them in the very beginning of the sermon of the statue of a perfect man brother says this morning we want to speak on the subject or teach rather if we can building the living tabernacle of the living god's dwelling place the perfect man the living tabernacle of the living god where he dwells now all these statements i'm using i'm taking from the statue of a perfect man i didn't provide um these these excerpts for you but they're all coming from the statue of a perfect man so notice that kind of other title building the living tabernacle of the living god's dwelling place the living tabernacle of the living god where he dwells so he can kind of get a full picture of the statue of a perfect man he's talking about building up this tabernacle where god dwells the the tabernacle the living tabernacle of the living god and he and this these descriptions in verses five to seven uh notice what the ver the verse prior to this verse four it says whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises so there is a um there's a divine power that we want to that has been given to us and he says whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these by even by these promises is ii peter chapter 1 verse 4 that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature that means to enter into fellowship with it to have communion with it to be made a partner to just it's actually translated one place to distribute and i thought about that just think that we might be in fellowship and community become a partner with his divine nature but then i even thought to to distribute it not the not even that it would just be distributed to us by the new birth but then we become distributors of the divine nature we broadcast his divine nature and so that we might be partakers of the divine nature this is a very key scripture part of this having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust now catch that because there's a way that people there's a way that we could read these this statue of a perfect man and walk away thinking oh my what i need to do is i need to get this and then i need to add this then i need to add this and we're going to work our way up to the seal of god and that's not the way this works you're not a peacock putting uh you're not a a black bird who says a crow putting in a black bird putting in peacock feathers you have the life you have that nature and so now it's it's a divine nature that needs to be expressed he says having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust that's who he's talking to those who by the spirit have been saved and rescued out of sin and placed into the body of christ as a son or daughter of god so he says this in quoting this exact verse this is brother brahma's language about this verse it's to the church them who are in christ have been exalted above these things not he exalted himself but christ brought him up so this commandment to add to your faith and to add in these virtues he says that's not to the unborn again but it's to those who are in christ and have already been raised up into christ and then he says it again now that's the type of person that he's talking to those who are partakers of the divine nature and who have escaped escape the corruption that is in the world through lust that's the type of person that he's talking to the person that has escaped these things the corruption of the world so who's this targeting these stats these virtues it's targeting those who are in the body of christ and then he makes this statement now he has given us the outline here what to do know how to do it now as i said we are all trying to come closer to god he says he's given us an outline here he's given us an outline here of what to do and to know how to do it that's what the statue of a perfect man is it's an outline for those of us who are trying to get closer to god now and i know you're all very familiar with that sermon but i think that i wanted to give that as an outset kind of as a foundation to these this contrast between a a bad habit of a highly ineffective parent and then the statue of a perfect man now this is just going to be very simple and straightforward as we walk through this i'm just going to give you the uh the bad habit what it's contrasted by and then just read to you a little bit of an excerpt from the statue of a perfect man now the over emphasizing carnal things that was the first bad habit that we express this over emphasizing carnal things is contrasted by faith and that being that foundational point of the statue of a perfect man i have not provided maybe the pyramid working itself up we're just going to kind of look at this in these terminologies over emphasizing carnal things is contrasted by faith and i'll say this as parents we ought to be word focused this ought to be something that our children can readily identify in our natures ought to be something that's um instinct and even habit that the word has preeminence in our families in our home life and that our children recognize that church the word is more than school that the word is more than recreation the word is more that these things these things mean more and that we make decisions in light of that and that we actually would rather see our children excel in the things of god than in athletics and in school and all these other things knowing that if the word has parameters in their lives he is the x factor that'll allow them to excel when maybe the grades aren't very good or maybe the opportunities aren't presenting themselves but when they've honored the lord he brings honor to them and will look out after them i can i know even brother branham taught that when your children have a test the next morning to pray over it or they have a test that day pray with them over that test and i would have more confidence in that than i would um to lay out of a church for a couple weeks before finals because i want my children to do well on their exams and so brother man makes the statement in the statute of a perfect man he says now you're going to build a house and you pour the foundation say boy i got her he said you've got the foundation to build your house on now you got to build a house now there's where the big thing comes in this morning we're going to talk about now a house this foundation is first what is the foundation of christianity faith in the word of god that's your foundation then you begin to grow then you start you begin to add to this foundation so when we take an overemphasis of carnal things and contrast it by faith i believe that we should be making a conscious and deliberate effort to base our family on the right things and that we are placing our children upon a foundation of spiritual things and so in doing so we we should have we should demonstrate within our choices and our decisions to give to put emphasis on spiritual things and brother brother reggie mentioned it sunday morning and it had been part of my thought process that the the the activity of a family devotion is so important for instilling in our children this idea that the word of god matters and it gives you a context and i think i want to go into greater detail on these so i'm going to try to limit myself hopefully from expounding too much on it but just as you pull will expound on it but that there is a uh to have that kind of discipline is giving our children this this habit and this as we say could say routine and it's certainly not a negative one at all to where they're hearing the word of god they're relating to the word of god it has preeminence it's part of our language as a family it's something that we do together even the sacrifices made to come to church and some of you travel great distances and and make that effort that's teaching your children something and they're realizing this this is there's worth and value in this and and so this is what we're looking at in terms of uh uh the the contrast of over emphasizing carnal things what we want to do as parents is not to have so much of the world have preeminence but to really have that foundation of faith in the word of god the second part the second bad habit inconsistently instructing and correcting is contrasted by uh virtue did did my slide have those that those uh those animations in it oh my i didn't realize i had done it that way see i i just even subconsciously make it more complicated than it ought to be but that's what happens when you don't uh don't test it beforehand which i usually do but just didn't have the time to date so it's inconsistently instructing and correcting that's really a mouthful in that because uh it was very deliberate in the words that i chose because there's things that we do when we discipline our children that is instructive and then there's also things that are corrective and it's contrasted by virtue and if i could say this and i'm looking for a really really easy loud amen from the parents but it takes diligence to raise children it takes a lot of perseverance and a lot of energy and a lot of labor i remember one of the first what i thought was a revelation after we had elliott was this is how you grow old and die as you have a baby you never catch up on sleep and you just kind of eventually wither away over a period of decades and the the the the shedding point the tipping point was the birth of that child and uh i caught up on my sleep i think my wife eventually did too because i learned after a while he's not crying for me he's crying for mom he's gonna be okay i'm gonna be okay and i caught up on my sleep but then you realize that to raise children um there's a lot of there's a lot of effort that needs to be put in it especially at the outset and what i recognize in our own lives and then you see it happen in other families there's a lot of things that we can do to buy ourselves some time to get you know to not be pressured or to be bothered or to not have to deal with things and we just make decisions to kind of put off the immediate need to address something or to teach our children that they don't always have to be entertained or learn to sit still and be quiet and instead of just going through maybe days or weeks or months or several different instances where it may be difficult but you take the time to teach them what's right in that situation what we do sometimes is we just want to hand it off to something else because it's just easier it's just easier in the moment i don't i i'll just let them have this or let them do that because it just it's easier than just constantly saying no you need to sit still you need to be quiet you need to learn to be still you need to learn to this you need to learn to do that and brother branham and espousing on espousing on virtue he says virtue and before you can let it out you've got to have it first and so if we if we want our children to be learning and be virtuous then we have to have it to give he says you haven't got it it won't come out there's nothing for it to come out of what if someone tried to draw virtue out of us and the check would return insufficient funds that'd be weird if there was just a way that your your advice could bounce right i'm just while you know what really you should do in this situation is it just comes right back to you and like it didn't cash bro i'm sorry it it whatever you're giving me you don't really have the virtue to give and so you're saying if if you're the virtue the check would return insufficient funds no no none there to draw from check bounced somebody look at you as a christian and tomorrow you see out there carrying on like a sinner not much virtue can be drawn from that this is where you can see some of an overlap to where there's a lot that brother brandon uses in terms of example example she says there's no virtue to be drawn from doing one thing one day and doing something the next he says virtue must be in us virtue anyone knows what the word virtue means and we must have it if virtue went from us from him to heal the woman that was sick he's expecting the same virtue in his church do you hear that if virtue went from him to heal the sick woman he's expecting virtue to be in his church the same virtue therefore we are to be a touch point from virtue to come forth from us to others who need it and what a better place to start to be virtuous and to give virtue than in your home he says because he was our example and if he had virtue to give to the people he expects us to have virtue to give to the people and amazing he expects us to have virtue to give to the people this is not just a preacher on the platform and him uh you know having virtue to give and you pulling from the gift and him becoming completely drained because you pulled all this virtue out it's not just a virtue that would manifest itself in a gifted man but this is the virtue that ought to be in the sons and daughters of god for us to give and he says what is virtue virtue is strength power and this is where i connect it with being consistent being consistent with how we discipline being consistent with how we instruct being consistent with how we correct because in order to do that it takes fortitude uh this inconsistency really is a lack of perseverance of just maybe maybe you sigh a little bit maybe you take a deep breath but going i gotta stick this out i gotta stay with this i gotta stay on top of this and not just giving in now if my children are really listening today they know exactly what's taking this is exactly what's happening when i'm working or i'm studying and sister elizabeth goes to the grocery store or she's going to go run an errand and as soon as she leaves the kids know i'm there at my desk working so they know i'm kind of weak i'm distracted it's like dad can we eat all the rocky road ice cream like yeah just go hey you know that's their moment to ask the world because i'm going to give it to them because they're i'm not taking the time to slow down say wait a minute you want what why do you want it and and to work through the situation why because that takes some fortitude takes some perseverance again let me remind you i chose the seven bad habits of highly ineffective parents because i know these really well i know what does not work i'm not going to pretend to be an expert on what the the habits of a highly effective parent is so now in the next one improperly judging and properly judging is contrasted by knowledge if i could say this based upon the um based upon the things in the statue of a perfect man there is uh we we there we have to have and we want to be sensitive to this i'm just wanting to choose my words very carefully we need to be very sensitive this that whenever we're dealing with others dealing with people i mean this again this is applicable to not just relationships with our children but we need to properly discern what is edifying how can i approach this that would edify there's a lot of things that take place in our lives and we have a knee-jerk reaction and i'll say this that as christians many times our initial imp impression may be absolutely correct that that we we recognize immediately that something's not right but there has to be another layer to this discernment another layer to what's happening to where we can discern what the right way to judge something the right way to handle it the right way to go about dealing with the situation so that we promote our repentance we promote growth we promote correction and we're not just inflicting pain or consequence as the result of doing something wrong a lot of our base instincts as humans is just to cause pain or shame or hurt when someone does something wrong but we want to respond in such a way that it actually addresses the underlying issue and kind of promotes a resolution to it and this is when i say improperly judging it means there's no there's not that knowledge where we judge and according to the word of god where we can begin to recognize maybe motive and objective and begin to actually um address appropriately what's taking place in the sermon statue of perfect man brother evan says knowledge now that don't mean worldly knowledge because that's foolishness to god but knowledge to judge judge right from wrong if you begin just to look at this that we have faith as a parent we're rooted and grounded in faith and this faith then can give us this emphasis on the right things then having virtue it gives us this fortitude to give consistent uh correction to give consistent we have this diligence in raising our children and now with knowledge according to the word of god to judge by the word of god we can judge correctly even the hearts of our children if you i believe that you have the right as a parent today that if you're you're struggling with maybe some stubbornness you're struggling with with something taking place in your children you're not sure just quite how to address it i believe you can ask god to give you the discernment as to what the issue actually is instead of just maybe all the things that are presenting itself because there could be rebellion and stubbornness and emotions that we're you're dealing with and all you're doing is just you're just kind of hitting hitting it as it rises up and hitting it as it rises up but if god could give you the discernment to find out what's giving birth to those things and what's causing them to come up and you do that by knowledge by knowledge according to the word of god because we could deal with symptoms all day long but it's the word that's going to identify the cause he says how do you judge it if then if you've got christian knowledge with your virtue and faith you judge whether the word is right or wrong to judge judge right judge whether it's right or wrong to believe god's word these are things he's saying about knowledge to judge by the word judge by the word judged by the word knowledge not worldly knowledge but it's a heavenly knowledge and heavenly knowledge when god is the foundation of all knowledge and god is the word then if you've got heavenly knowledge you believe the word and notice this and you reason anything by the word you reason anything by the word this is a tool that we use now as as um well you could just see how the inverse you can kind of figure out maybe some highly effective habits of a good uh uh some habits of a highly effective parent you reason things by the word so it's going to give us that knowledge we need to judge and to judge our children's hearts judging by the word the next bad habit is inappropriately using voice this is just a real clumsy way maybe to say shouting but inappropriately using voice and i'm contrasting this by temperance and truly and i'm not i i don't want to be misunderstood i believe that there is a place for uh raising your voice and and there's times when you need to have a greater emphasis and the only way that you're going to be able to do that is maybe to achieve another volume but there is a yelling that can be very harmful and there are harsh words that are not simply not fruitful and so it's not merely yelling i guess you could whisper some of the things that parents say to their children it'd be just as harmful as if you yelled it and it can be shocking it can be shocking the words that people use towards their children and i've encountered this mostly in the world where you are actually just i think any of these instances i could think of would probably be in the world where somebody has just called their children stupid or said things very very harsh and in your mind you're thinking well if they're going to say that in public you know what are the kind of things that they're saying to this child and how is it how is the child then internalizing that and and i i was talking to some i can't remember where i was and maybe when some of my kids were there uh when this was set it was at the meetings this past weekend and one of the kids said said his name was face plant was that it was it was it faced plant who remember yeah it's face plant like face plant and his sister was named bug and uh his name was face plant and i'm like face plant well you must have earned that name right and he told the story how i'm always tripping and falling flat on my face so my parents call me face plant now the thought i have is he will probably do that the rest of his life just because he thinks that's what his nature is he's been given a label right he's the one that face plants and we can start giving labels to our kids oh they're the ones that love coconut cream pie and they're like i do right just because they asked for it one time because somebody else asked for it and then that one birthday when they're four years old they asked for coconut cream pie because that's just the only thing they could think of for the rest of their lives they get coconut cream pie and they're 32 years old saying yeah my favorite pie is coconut cream pie and then i realized no that was something random right because you were jr tippins or whatever and somebody there at the table ordered the uh or shonies maybe that may be a better reference you're at shoni's and somebody orders coconut cream pie and at four years old that just kind of sticks in your head and you order and now you're the coconut cream pie kid not because you love it but it was just something that you learned and so there's a um there's a way that we can talk to our children that imposes on them sentences they're going to live under that the rest of their lives there's a way that we inappropriately use our voice and use our language and use our tongues that are very very harmful and this is easily contrasted by temperance especially given what brother branham says about temperance he says this bible temperance holy spirit temperance that's just one of the lusts of the flesh but we're talking about holy spirit temperance that means how to control your tongue not be a tattler how to control your temper not fly off every time anybody speaks cross to you well now i think this is good for all of us this is good for parents because we could teach our children just by way that we use our voice to others we're teaching them how to talk that's how they learn language right that's how they've learned to talk in your home you you may have to teach them to read but you didn't really have to teach them that hard to talk they're just picking it up and that's why sometimes when kids say things and whole kids say they say they can say the the most interesting things right and they say it maybe just like an adult would and they have just a little bit of attitude they say something you say i know what it's like at home right i know exactly the way the parents talk to each other i know how things take place at home because they're mimicking language they're learning this so he says control your tongue don't be a tattler control your temper don't fly off when anytime someone speaks cross to you this is things that we have in practice and therefore this is a temperance we ought to have as christians and then this is uh this has been useful in parenting to where i'm not going to inappropriately use my tongue with my children he says old temperance how to answer in kindness when wrath is spoke to you how to answer in kindness to your children when rebellion spoke to you when disobedience has spoke to you when their attitudes are spoken to and they raise their voice when they stomp off when they slam the door when they won't listen when they get hard when they get rebel you see somebody say you bunch of holy rollers down there don't jump out and roll up your sleeves now not that now let's just think of how that could be applicable to situations in parenting i guess there is really nothing like an eight-year-old to make a parent act like an eight-year-old nothing like a teenager to make a grown man act like a teenager why because you're seating like are you serious you know you want to just kind of mirror right back at him but i don't know that you're helping the situation i'll never forget the first time i ever i was with elliot and i thought you know whenever they get hurt i didn't want him to you know continue to cry and so i think he'd run into something and i was like i said oh bad table bad shouldn't have done that i was gonna blame the table and he was just like yeah bad table wham and i was like yeah we'll just change that we'll just change that approach next thing you know there's a big hole in the windows like yeah i ran into the i ran into the door and i just i let it happen so you have to be temperate and not just roll up your sleeves at the wall if it hurts you he says but talk with godly love temperance kindness is that the way you want to be when you're riled upon rile not back he says let him be your example and this is applicable then in parenting where there are situations that might provoke us might kind of needle us a little bit might be able to kind of get this riled up but in the same way that we're trying to demonstrate to our children you should not have responded that way you shouldn't use that kind of language you shouldn't yell you shouldn't do this we're gonna we're gonna mirror that to our children by appropriately using language and voice and being very uh careful in the words that we use i think it's very easy maybe to get legalistic with it but maybe there's phrases that we instinctively use or things that we say immediately to our children that may not be helping the situation and we can begin to change our speech change our initial reaction this temperance this self-control the controlling of our tongues in the way that we speak to our children i will say that for myself one of the biggest regrets i have as a father is ever using a loud voice to correct and i wish i could have been much more circumspect in waiting and timely using it now i will say that at times i think preston may not hear as well as the others because you might have to use a little bit louder voice with him but a loud voice can be very very could undermine the very things you're saying because all they hear is your tone and your volume and not what you just said and so it's something to to ponder tremendously because it's a bad habit of a highly ineffective parent to inappropriately use voice the next one is wrongly disciplining and we're going to contrast this by patience wrongly disciplining contrasted by patience there's a again this is another mouthful but one of the most something that undermines our discipline is when we do it through pride it's a lot of instances where we find ourselves wanting to address something not because the conduct in itself was necessarily wrong but it's the way it made us look and and we can parent from the point of pride and we do that it really it really sews the wrong things into our children and so if we punish through pride we punish through frustration then what happens it breeds the same things in the hearts of our children even a man of god if he gets up to the pope and he preaches because he's jealous you're going to sow jealousy into the people if you preach because you're suspicious alone it's going to sow it into the people if you do it because you're frustrated and you're mad it's going to sow into the people and i've heard pastors testify of how there was just some darkness upon the people he's preaching the word preaching the word preaching he couldn't couldn't find any fault with the word that's being preached but there's just something in the people that god opened up their eyes to see there was some complex there was something underneath all of that driving it in unbeknownst to him the very even though it was the word that spirit was carrying on those words and the people were receiving it and they would have never figured out where it was coming from but it's just the way that if you're if you're frustrated if you're angry if you if your pride's been hurt then you parent or correct from that position you're going to inflict the same into your child frustration and anger and those things that you got to be very very careful and so this to when we disciplined the wrong way we can we can we could change that by having patience bill graham says in the statute of a perfect man he says and we should have patience with one another too we get so much impatient with one another's right and we do it with our children it says we think we got to be we think we got to be like moses moses had patience with the people he says we think we got to be like moses he says moses had patience with the people look that's what caused them to not go over and he said and listen very closely here we're um we just have a little bit more to go and we're going to close so i feel that i'm very near so if you could just kind of work up some uh work up some uh attention i'm it's it's 11 15 my body's time i am tired i don't think i went to bed on average i was going to bed at like 3 o'clock in the morning if that kind of helps you well if i haven't if i have an excuse for tonight it's like remember aaron you just really weren't there well i got an excuse and i apologize profusely if you want maybe we won't have service tomorrow night tomorrow night i'll nap and i'll maybe come back and try to do this a little bit better he says he says and so focus how he says this because you could read into what he's saying like i've tried to get this message over at the tabernacle to see that each member of the tabernacle becomes this he wants them to become this status of a perfect man it's hard to do i've tried to have patience this is 33 years have patience women still bob their hair still just the same but just have patience just have patience wait have to if you ain't got it don't try to build on this down here have patience notice what he's saying that he's trying to teach something 33 years i've been trying to teach him been trying to teach him and what is he saying i just i have to have patience i can't give up i can't stop he says just wait i have to each time each one time when rebellion bunch of people had such impatience they caused moses to do something that was wrong but yet when it come to a showdown god got sick of their action he said separate yourself moses i'll kill the whole bunch of them and start anew and then notice it says he moses threw himself into the breach and said god don't do it and he says what patience with the people that were rebelling against him so it's actually moses that stood in the gap and moses didn't get frustrated moses said yeah you know what enough's enough it's about time you just tried decided to destroy all of them no he threw himself in the gap and brother brown's making this uh likening this to patience he was patient with the people that were rebelling so it's through his patience that he restrained from severe punishment this is demonstrative of the meekness that moses had because certainly in this instance he could have just took take a step back and said let him have it god go for it they deserve it even these people they're pressuring him and putting pressure on him he he dug down deep and acted in meekness because he was strained though he could have exercised allowed god to exercise the power though he could have added his voice and support to severe punishment through his meekness he said no no let's wait let's have patience and he stood in the gap and if we should have patience for one another then we ought to have patience for our children i was preaching at a minister's meeting one time and i may have mentioned this to you and the subject was the five definite identifications of the true church of the living god and just drawn it straight from the um straight from the message that brother brown taught now my i was asked to speak and i was told that i was going to go first and my overarching theme kind of my thesis was the local church is not the true church and so the five definite identifications of the true church apply to the true church but not necessarily the local church but as a local church our vision is to promote these five definitive identifications in the individual members of the true church or to serve that purpose of the true church well somehow the order got mixed up and the person that went before me their thesis was the exact opposite of mine and so i was a little bit nervous about how in the world am i going to do this and i thought you know what that's just what ministers meetings are for though is to say with all due respect i disagree with the first brothers but god gave grace and one of the uh one of the things that was really emphasized in the first part was how the sanctuary is the dwelling place of god and we ought to respect the sanctuary and and is very very forceful on how important the building was how important the sanctuary was and how important it was to show respect and all these people that show respect and now if that's true of this sanctuary what about you and i you are the dwelling place of god you are the town you are the temple of the holy ghost and so if we would show reverence and respect to this sanctuary oh be careful be careful don't want to upset that don't want to be disrespectful don't want to be disorderly if we would do that to this sanctuary what about how we treat one another and then by extension what about our children their hearts that if we want to raise them to be dwelling places of god then how respectful we ought to be of that vessel that body their spirit exercising patience in the way that we correct and discipline you know children are first learning to obey god as they obey their parents and you will either make it easy on them or you'll make it hard on them and truly maybe this will be another part of kids eat free when you recognize the judgment that comes upon a child for disrespect in their parents then it'll humble you as to how you want to be the kind of parent they can respect and to make their obedience easy and so that's wrongly disciplining not being an example we could say being a bad example but not being an example as we've already heard brother branham reference a few times contrasting this with godliness being a not being an example contrasted by god this is a very simple and straightforward one here this next one too we'll just kind of uh wrap him up very succinctly he says godliness means to be god like god and he says oh my and i say oh my myself gosh means to be like god he says but you know what godliness meant you've sang in the song to be like jesus to be like jesus on earth i long to be like him all through life's journey from earth to glory i only asked to be like kim he said that's godliness when he was smite on one side of the face he turned the other when he was spoken rough to he didn't speak he didn't rile back godly always looking for one thing i'll always do that which pleases the father yes sir always that's godliness jesus did now notice in this dynamic to me this is what gives us this image of how uh in effect a bad habit is to not be a good example or to be a bad example or not being an example because he says on earth i long to be like him and he says to be like god notice it's not necessarily just to be like jesus but to be like god who afforded jesus the positive example because he says i only do that which pleases the father so jesus did what the father demonstrated or what the father did what he saw the father doing what do you hear the father say he did so that's the way i want you to look at it as god as the ultimate parent was affording christ the example that he likewise followed in then we can view ourselves as standing in the stead of god to our children and in every situation i long to be the example for my children and the way that i talk to servers and the way that i talk to people at the front desk where i talk to people in the service industry the way i talk to people in the world the way that i respond the way that i act the way that i talk to people that cut me off in traffic the way i talk about people in church i mean wouldn't that be interesting if i came up here on a kid's eat free night and just grabbed one of these mics and just said i'm gonna call the children up and i have them come up and say now how does your mom feel about sister so-and-so right you know just just ask him are you getting nervous next wednesday night nobody's going to be here i'm like well we didn't know if it was going to be open mic night brother aaron but isn't that sobering to think that the things that we can so freely say and just what that can sow into the children the thoughts because they you may say something and it means something to you but in their minds they they struggle so difficult so difficult for them to get their heads around it because they're not thinking the same way you do i heard a story here recently of how a little girl told their parent told their friend at school i know who the tooth fairy is and it was like it's my dad and instead of the little girl kind of thinking that's your dad instead of kind of thinking logically that there is no tooth fairy this other girl went home and said mom i know who the tooth fairy is it's my friend's dad and went like her whole life at least for some period of time believing that the tooth fairy was her friend's dad and just kind of be in awe of this guy like wow this is amazing that's how kids can think sometimes like we make a comment and the kid lacks the car the bigger context their minds just work a little bit differently and so we want to and again this is where you can see a lot of overlap in these things we want to always demonstrate the right example a bad habit is being a bad example we can overcome that through godliness the seventh one and this is the the last bad habit of a highly ineffective parent i hope there's a a new paradigm to view the way that we act sometimes as parents but this is the seventh one withholding grace we're contrasting this with brotherly kindness to and i'm going to read a statement that kind of focuses this what i mean by withholding grace is that the way that we might treat someone and the way that we might deal with them can be so severe and so harsh and in doing so we're not seeing that this it connects so well with where i was going actually i think the anecdote i just used about the tooth fairy would have been more appropriate here but when we can exercise brotherly kindness we see things through their eyes we forget what it's like to be a kid it's easy for me at 47 years old to look at elliott at 14 and use a 47 year old mind and not remember what it's like to be 14. and and we can do this on so many different levels and so what what i'm expressing in this in terms of brotherly kindness is the anecdote to withholding grace because what we need to do is show empathy and if we can't be empathetic at least be sympathetic but really all of us can relate that you know at one time we were there and brother branham says this brotherly kindness put yourself in his place on the matter i know that might be hard to kind of get your mind around what a five-year-old's thinking uh but at least you could at least you could look at it from this standpoint i'm looking at it as an adult i'm looking at it as a parent how is he looking at it as a child and therefore how can i approach them in such a way and show grace and again maybe exhibit that patient and say you know what it's apparent to me what the right ideal would be the right response would be in the situation the right way to do this but i'm going to have grace because it wouldn't be equally apparent to a five-year-old why because i'm putting myself in their shoes reminds me of that calvin and hobbes comic at one time where the there's multiple panels where calvin is just nailing uh nails into the end table coffee table and it's just so bam bam bam bam bam and the next frame of his mom running to him and then the the next to last frame it's calvin what in the world are you doing and then there's this kind of like maybe another panel where there's this kind of this little blink above his head like he looks up and says is that a trick question i'm obviously nailing nails into your coffee table and so you think the apparent is like what in the world are you doing and the kid's like painting the wall you know dumping the crisp the grease everywhere i'm repainting the garage you know there's they know exactly what they're doing and so you say what in the world are you doing they're kind of like i thought you were with it mom it's seeing things from their eyes seeing things from their perspective he says brotherly kindness now you see if a brother is all out of tune don't be impatient with him no be kind to him this is how you can exercise bradley kindness is when you try to see something where they're coming from how they see it maybe if you could relate to this but what i it's something i read i think we still do it i still do it rather where i can ask my kids to do something so put this over there and they're like what i like put this over there and they're like what you're like put this over there it's so ambiguous what this is and where there is because i know what this is and i would i know where there is but i've just interrupted them while they're nailing nails into the coffee table so they don't know what this is and where there is but if we just think if we keep repeating ourselves they'll get this and they'll get this and go there and so you need to put yourself in their shoes and if you were just awakened about a daydream a daydream about ponies and to put this over there you say slow down hold on i want you to take this box right here and go put it on the shelf in the pantry and then we maybe have a more educated discussion about which shelf and how high or where and is the box heavy but just this over there in an elevated level of volume probably isn't going to give clarity and that can change if you can hold have a little grace when they don't immediately understand what this is and where there is put yourself in his place on the matter put yourself in your children's shoes is this practical talking about practice again i like it in second peter chapter one now you're thinking i know how to count brother aaron a statue of a perfect man has eight characteristics isn't that right i like that eight bright age and you might be thinking well there's seven there's seven bad habits maybe there should be eight bad habits but this is my sermon so it's structured this way and again there's no word on this this is not a doctrine so i could have used three and a half if i wanted to but in second peter chapter one verse seven and it took godliness add add brotherly kindness and the eighth here and to breadth kindness charity i want you to view this one as let's not have let's not have a counterpart let's not have a correlation let's not have a contrast but let's have this be the cap let it have the capstone let it have no rival let it have no opposite and it says in first corinthians chapter 13 verse 13 and now abideth faith hope charity these three but the greatest of these is charity so there's something about charities the bible says that god is love god is charity it's something akin to god so when we look at this add to brotherly kindness charity we have faith it all begins in faith now it's ending in love there's a way that you can look at that that faith ends in perfect faith and faith is going to end in perfect love there's something that just all melds together and manifest there's certainly a very clear and distinct application dispensationally to the church ages in the open of the word of god and this capstone you find this in christ the mystery as it relates to me as a person wherein as a parent even wanting to add to finally this cap charity is i can say the most outstanding contrast to these seven bad habits it's the key you can almost say it this way that however there and i kind of got lost in the font that you used and from that point on i never really understood the service um i didn't get the correlation it didn't make sense to me um i think there's still people who ask me what invert always invert means uh and so there may be a way that those things just didn't click but i could say this this is the key that if you have love that's the key that's going to unlock i really want to emphasize this it's that love that unlocks so much and how that we deal with our children how we deal with one another it says in galatians chapter 5 verse 6 for in christ jesus christ neither circumcision availeth anything nor uncircumcision but faith which worketh by love our faith works by love we say oh i have faith i have faith but if faith is going to work it works effectively by love so this faith that we have even at the beginning and all these virtues we add there's something about this charity and this capstone that is radiating down through through us and it's causing our faith to work and our faith works by love this is how brother branham says that charity which is love that's the capping stone is the language he uses in the statute of a perfect man the headstone which is love for god is love now catch this statement and he controls and he is the strength of every one of these things look let's look at it not from this standpoint of well i got faith and if i could just figure out faith one day i can get virtue no think of this you're a son of god all these ver all these characteristics are in you and he controls and he's the strength of every one of these that that's that's my that's my comfort as a believer as a holy spirit-filled son of god my my comforter abides with me and and that's my that's my strength and then in this same sense now of using these characteristics to kind of bring a contrast to parental habits parental love is this is the strength that promotes the good habits if we were to say that emphasizing spiritual things consistently instructing and correcting properly judging using my voice appropriately disciplining the right way being a good example showing grace that it's parental love that promotes the good and changes the bad why will i do these things because i love my children why will i well why will i treat you with respect because i love you at the end of the day i would even say that at the very least we ought to treat everyone the right way because we fear god amen there's um i don't think i'm sharing too much here there's times when i thought man i should do that and it's not because i care about the person that i choose not to it's the fear of god that causes me not to act i think wait a minute i fear god too much than to misbehave i fear god too much to do something that's not right and so it's that love and that reverence even for god and it's love that we have for one another that'll restrain us and even motivate us restrain the negative conduct but then promote the right kind of conduct and if it's god that controls it's the love of god god is love he controls and is the strength of every one of these characteristics of all these things that we've expressed to you of this faith and virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness brother christ he is the strength of every one of these and it says in philippians 2 13 for it is god which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure this is what i could say to parents tonight who are filled with the holy ghost who want to honor the lord who are already making the sacrifice to have their children in church on a wednesday night it's 8 it's 8 30 on a wednesday night whatever time it's going to get the kids up in the morning is going to come quick it's going to come early but here you are what causes you to do that it's god that works in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure and i'll say this to the parents tonight and if you and those who are no longer raising children again this applies to any relationship that we could have you're willing to do it because you love and you're able to do it because you have faith it's god in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure we're willing say you could say i'm willing brother and i'm willing to do the right thing i'm willing i'm willing to begin to say and do these things be more effective in parenting or even address these seven bad habits i'm willing to do it because i love my children i love my wife i i love other people i want to do the right thing i'm willing because i love and i'll say you're able also because you have faith it's in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure let's pray our gracious heavenly father lord tonight as we have examined these things i know that it's it's a dryness maybe i'm not sure just exactly how to express it but you know better than i just what dynamic pull there was on these things just how easily i could have committed myself to expounding on any one of these into great detail because lord it was real it's applicable there's things that were expressed tonight that one person may be able to take and so precisely apply it to their life it is the exact key to unlock a situation that seemed close to them so i pray tonight lord that you would have a grace upon the people that have been faithful been have been attentive and listening lord they've been very focused may you have a grace on them and and strengthen them and encourage them lord as we're soon dismissed lord may these things not soon leave our thoughts but may we meditate upon them consider them their relevance lord i think of some of the those amongst us who have adult children they've already raised their children and they find themselves in a different stage of life lord i would that they would have a liberty to impart wisdom and to be good examples to those of us who are following in the footsteps and just to promote lord give me wisdom as a pastor to now as i feel in my heart we're entering into just another growth stage as a church just to be able to promote more of a family atmosphere among one another finding ways to help one another spend more time together lord i believe that these this approach these principles will be helpful to us in that lord if there be anyone here tonight that needs a touch from you that needs that really wants to reach out and grab a hold of this word that was preached tonight and say oh god help me may you hear their cry may you respond to their need may you have mercy on them oh god commit all things to you tonight praying your blessings upon the word which has been preached the things that have been shared in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen god bless you let's stand
