TRANSCRIPT
========================================
um just make reference to something that has been uh I think on a lot of our hearts there's been a lot of a statements shared amongst ourselves over the last week or so and I think it uh it didn't really come into view until this past week after the election um that the state number of statements that brother Brandon makes regarding a woman rise to power great woman he gives us prophecy in 1933 one of the different visions that he had in prophecies that he made and there's a lot of focus uh oftentimes on how this is going to be interpreted and a lot of statements are shared so what I wanted to do just for a few moments here at the outset um is to share some of the the rest of the statements or a few things not to put my own interpretation on it but rather just to zero in on even how brother brandham felt this prophecy was being fulfilled and and I have several statements here that just in themselves we could spend the morning uh teaching on them but I'm just going to try to uh point to some key phrases when he's uh preaching the message life in 1957 he refers to that Vision he says remember 1933 I saw that come in a vision a great powerful woman will take over the whole nation someday and then he talks about how it's a woman's Nation America he says women will take over women will take over and the doctrine of the Catholic Church which I've always said would take over the United States it's absolutely almost there right now worship of a woman Mary which is a goddess then which is contrary to the Bible then he says uh in condemnation by representation in 1960 I seen a great woman rise up in the United States well-dressed beautiful but cruel in heart she'll either guide or lead this nation to ruination I got in parenthesis perhaps Catholic Church then also that same year and from that time he says in 1933 referring to the vision again this is a woman Nation it's number 13 it appears in 13th chapter of Revelation so he's just laying those things out he says she'll either be president vice president or it'll be the Catholic Church as a woman I've seen her a great woman then when he's preaching the revelation of Jesus Christ which is the uh Church age book he says but there will be a powerful woman now remember this is on tape two a powerful woman great woman she'll either be president or it'll be a woman representing the Catholic Church which I think it is which take over here someday and she'll rule this country and then he talks about how the number 13 the United States of America number 13313 everything is woman woman woman woman woman right on down she takes over all the offices she's taken over Hollywood she's taking over the Nations over the offices he says she took over everything there is equal right with men cusses like a man drinks like a man he says and just bait for the Catholic church for the wor worship of a woman do you see a thing them and how brother brandom approached this prophecy of a woman coming into Power he says now this is how it was written in the church age book the same statement he says then in the sixth Vision There Rose America in America the most beautiful but cruel woman she held the people in her complete power I believed that this was the rise of the Roman Catholic Church though I knew it could possibly be a vision of some woman rising in great power in America so he's he believed it would be the rise of the Roman Catholic Church then he says in Jehovah Gyra 1961 I said I seen some great powerful woman rise in the United States and he again he goes through the same Revelations chapter 13 the number 13 He says and I see a great woman rise up beautiful to look at but cruel Wicked heart and that will be a church and she's on her road now excuse me for a moment [Music] now I can really really get as loud as I want notice how he says and that will be a church very definitive this great woman coming into Power then in Jezebel religion just a week later he says remember Jezebel calls herself a prophetess and then he says they'll come a worship of a woman in the United States that will be Mary I seen it 1933 and he refers to again to the vision so it's the worship of a woman the worship of Mary which he's connecting with the Roman Catholic church and then also he connects these things with the World Council of churches in an ecumenical movement and so these things are all the ways that he tied these things together and then in the message once more this is in November of 1963 he says the Council of churches putting themselves together and uniting in Fellowship around Rome he says exact what the Bible said it would do 1933 the Holy Spirit came one morning and told me seven things that would take place before this nation was destroyed one of them is that so notice how he places it he says one of them is that it's on Old Paper there at the church many has looked at it goes through a few of those visions and he says and how that they would permit women to vote and doing so they would elect the wrong president and in this would be a woman standup that would govern the United States not actually a woman but a church and so he says it it was it wasn't more than just it wasn't just one time in 1957 he says well to my opinion I think it's the Roman Catholic church and then left it alone but he multiple times he makes reference to this prophecy and he he's pointing out very definitively that it is fulfilled at least in one way that it was the Roman Catholic church and I believe that there can be women rising to power literally rising to power and it's symbolic of of that that the real power that's governing things and and what the thrust of it is and how it's a religious thing it's a religious spirit and it's the uh and it's uh even going to take head in the Antichrist after the Rapture but I wanted just to read those to you um share those with you so that you get the full context uh because we all know uh if you're around the message for very long you hear these visions and you hear that brother brandham said there'd be a woman president and that really is just kind of a a snippet of what he actually said he said a lot of things in relation to it and he most often and especially after the seals are open he's pointing more to this spiritual side of This Woman This worship of Mary worship of a woman the Roman Catholic Church it being joined ecumenically with the World Council of churches and he's always pointing back to this Vision that it was the church not just a woman so with the election of a new president uh president-elect Joe Biden and his vice president uh Harris uh Vice president-elect Harris there's maybe some speculation could this be the Fulfillment now I can't say that brother brandham didn't see this woman but I do know that he already has pointed us to the church and the rise of that woman as being a fulfillment of it and in that way I'm more intrigued that Joe Biden is only the second Catholic president ever elected to the United States since John F Kennedy so to me that's maybe more compelling than the woman aspect but you can definitely see in the message and know this is one of the known knowns right this is one of the knowns that we can look to and say brother brandom already told us that this is part of it um even when it comes to the foolish virgin going to buy oil he already told us that was happening in his ministry look at them now those denominations seeking it now so there's certain things that we can say this part has been fulfilled if there's another part to it then let God interpret it by bringing it to pass so just wanted to share those with you a few of them not trying to put my own interpretation on it but just share the full scope of how that brother brandham we know that brother Brandon pointed to the rise of the woman in power being a church the worship of Mary which is represented by Roman Catholicism which is the mother and then all the episcopalians the Protestants all of them joined together anyways so it's a lot more subtle than maybe we think it is so I just wanted to share that with you trust that it was uh those things would be helpful if you like to have those statements I can provide them for you if we could just stand again I'd like to take uh a read from Luke chap 22: 31-34 thank you musicians we can do it in plural this morning which is nice I apologize for making you sit there a little bit longer Luke chapter 22: 31-34 and the Lord said Simon Simon behold Satan hath desired to have you that he may sift you as wheat but I have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not and when thou art converted strengthen thy Brethren and he said unto him Lord I'm ready to go with thee both into prison and to death had a lot of zeal uh was really convinced of uh what you know the conviction his backbone he really thought he had it he says and he said I tell thee Peter the shall not Crow this day before that thou shalt Thrice deny that thou knowest me amen we desire God bless the reading of his word you can have your seats we're continuing on the subject of you were made for this this is actually turned into a little bit more than I thought it would be because there's just so much uh depth to this and as we've already um looked at uh in the last couple Services we were really focusing on the tension and the concern regarding the social climate the political climate even the economic climate in relation to the present election and how there was a lot of even a lot of fear amongst uh Believers but fear amongst uh Americans in general the whole world watching what's going to transpire on Election night what are the events that are going to unfold and we can take courage knowing that it's God's word that's going to be accomplished and that regardless of uh what our speculations might be and even regardless of what our fears are God's word is going to be accomplished he's going to bring his word to pass so we can rest knowing that he has set things in motion he allows things to come to pass and so we don't try to get so much invested um in personalities and even outcomes because when we do that um we can actually weaken our faith because we're trying to project confidence in Faith towards something that God hasn't said nor will it come to pass and so really it's just to hope so and we're left disappointed uh my dad said something one time he said many things at one time that I have appreciated and I enjoyed but one thing that has stayed with me for uh over 20 years now is he said faith is not necessarily holding on to a particular outcome we say well it just has to be this way it just has to be that way and that's faith that could just be your hes so your your your will what you want and you hold on to particular outcome and when that doesn't happen what does it become a judgment of or an indictment of your faith because you've presumed and you ventured without Authority and as we were looking at that we're looking at how that things that are uncertain are just that they're not certain and that we have to resist the urge to take these uncertainties and then join them with prophecies and and doing so create a monster that is hybrid that is our the uncertainties with our interpretation of Prophecy and then that doesn't really bring Faith it brings fear and that weakens our confidence even more and we were just looking at those different things and then the third thing if I'm just going by memory here was that if there's been a prophecy take it all into consideration if there's a prophecy of Doom where where's the where's the uh the prophecy of departure where's the depart the prophecy of Deliverance that's attached with it because God gives warning before he gives judgment and the warning isn't merely I'm going to smack you in the face so you might as well just get ready for it it's if you don't I'm going to' so the warning carries with it a way of Escape or a solution or a remedy and so those are some of the uh things that we've been sharing how that in this season and in this time of uncertainty and volatility within economies within our own jobs and social things we need to be connected to the things that we know are certain and resist the urge of creating hybrids in our conscience and in our theology our belief system that promote fear and not faith and as we're reading here in Luke chapter 22 and so we'll just jump right into this uh is where we're reading in our text Jesus says Satan hath desired to have you that he may sift you as wheat this is the agitation of his faith that it might be overthrown because Jesus then kind of amplifies what the sifting was related to he says but I have prayed for thee isn't that wonderful and he's prayed for you too he prayed for not only these but th these but them that th also given me and he prayed that you would be one with him as even as he was one with the father so he has prayed for us he says I've prayed for them or for thee that thy faith fail not so that's the focus of Satan's sifting is kind of the weakening of his faith the agitation of his faith to failure and when thou art converted strengthen thy Brethren I I love how that it's not and if it's when so he had this confidence in the election of Peter he knew all that thou has given me is thine except for one he even said he said that's the one that'll betray me so he knew that Peter was not that one he knew that Peter was one that was given to him and couldn't be separated from him so he says when thou art converted strength in thy Brethren and Peter remarks Lord I'm ready to go with thee both into prison and to death so he was certain that he could do uh he could follow Jesus even into prison if it meant that I'm willing to die for you I'm willing to be in prison for you I'm so certain in this faith that I have for you that I'm willing to suffer all sorts of persecution even unto death and he said tell thee Peter the shall not Crow this day before that thou shalt Thrice deny that thou knowest me so it says I know you are drawn The Sword and you're all ready to go to fight for me you're ready to go to prison you're ready to be murdered for my sake but at this point you'll actually deny me three times before the crows and it says it this way in John Chapter 13 it says it uh he says it in verses 36 and 37 Simon Peter said unto him Lord wheither goest thou Jesus answered him whether I go thou c not follow me now but thou shal follow me shalt follow me afterwards now this speaks directly as it says Peter said unto him well and there's another place where Jesus is speaking to him and they knew that he said this foreshadowing the death that Peter would have so he knew that now Peter couldn't be a martyr in the condition that he was in then he couldn't be a martyr but he was saying but you will be able to follow me afterwards right now you can't do so but later you on you will be and Peter said unto him Lord why can I not follow thee now I will lay down my life for thy sake now we understand the story or know the story how that Peter that very day that very morning uh was challenged whether or not he was identified with Jesus and in each time these three different instances his defense be got more agitated and more agitated to the point it's the Bible says he swore he he was like I don't know this man so he's brought to the place three times where he denies Christ and then even denies his deity and his origin from God says I don't know this man and that fulfills what Jesus said would would happen because in that state the fear of persecution or even the fear of death caused Peter to deny Christ when Under Pressure so right there when the word was being crucified right there when he was being put on trial Peter could not stand the pressure but after his conversion all fear is gone and he stands up before the people and he says you've crucified Jesus Christ you men have blood on your hands he was the the Son of God and he refers to prophecy and he's telling them what's happened and all the fear has gone from Peter to the point to where Peter in his as Jesus even prophesied he was willing to lay down his life for the gospel and the tradition is that Peter requested to be hung upside down because he didn't feel he was even worthy to be crucified in the same manner that Christ was but it was fear that caused this in Peter and in First Peter chapter 5: 8 and N he wrote be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a Roy and lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour who resist steadfast in the faith knowing the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world so Peter could speak personally saying I know Satan has desired to sift me like wait I know how he tries to agitate I know how you can be under pressure I know he could say I even know what it's like to walk with Christ and then be brought to a place to where you would even deny him he says because your adversary The Devil Makes due use of every opportunity every breath he's seeking to devour you he says resist him steadfast in the faith knowing that he's doing this to everybody he's doing this to all the Brethren so if you're undergoing something and you're facing a difficulty you're even in a crisis of Faith you're it's not unique to you Believers around the world for thousands of years have suffered the same trial of their faith they they have suffered the same questioning the same examining the same testing the same proving and so he says these things are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world I if with that in view here's Jesus acknowledging and even telling Peter Satan has desired to sift you like weak and in Peter's experience he's saying that the devil will make due use of every opportunity to do exactly that agitate you to the place where your faith is overthrown that's his objective and that's his goal now Jesus was not expressing to Peter that he had an adversary that was going to seek make take advantage of every opportunity could to destroy him in order for Peter to be scared looking over his shoulder peeking around corners waiting for the devil to show up but he told him to give him courage he says I've prayed for for you that your faith fail not and when thou are strengthen when you are converted strengthen thy Brethren so for us Prophecies of hardship are even a even a prophecy of death is never meant to cause fear or weakness if if the Lord prophesied that you were to die it would not be to cause you cause fear or weakness but actually to give you boldness to face it so there's no prophecy of difficulty there's no prophecy of trial or hardship that should come upon the body of Christ that should ever cause us to worry or to fear or start tra trying to make man-made things to get through it or or or put things in place and procedures in place and safety net say well if there's going to be this happening there's going to be that happening and then begin to act out of fear just stay steady stand still and watch God come on the scene in the message anointed ones at the end time brother brandham says an eagle is a special built bird there's nothing like him on the earth if a buzzer try to follow him or any other bird he'd disintegrate his folies would be made manifest sure enough now there might be a lot of focus on the Buzzard and his Foles being made manifest but so this is the maybe the negative take the opposite this applies to the eagle and opposite because an eagle is a special built bird he says he's talking about the Buzzard he would blow up he'd disintegrate which means the eagle won't he says his body isn't put to together with the structure to hold him up there which means the Eagles is right when he gets in them great spheres up yonder he wasn't made ordained predestinated born an eagle he'll bust to Pieces but the made Eagle can soar in those spheres in a place of pressure he says the feathers would fly out of his wings but not for the eagle and he'd fall to the Earth but not for the eagle sure he can't follow the eagle in height if he tries his folly will be made manifest that means the eagle under pressure pressure at these high heights and however you want to phrase this and not getting bogged down in the science of which bird can fly the highest he's merely using something in the natural to try to type something that is for sure a truth in the spiritual that the believer is made for pressures that everyone else isn't made for that the believer can experience things go through things endure things hardships afflictions persecutions and not fall apart not lose their feathers not crumble not disintegrate not because of the profession that comes out of their mouth but a character that God has placed in them from the beginning he's made you that way he's made you that you could endure these things he's made you that you could go through this so it's not there's no fear of failure those there's no fear of folly but the pressure reveals your true character the higher it goes the longer it goes the harder it gets the more pressure there is it's revealing your true character so that's why I'm focusing on this you were made for this and that there's nothing we ought to fear because God's word has already spoken something very certain and that's what we focus on not the uncertainties but the things that are very certain and now trying to and and I I think I've been maybe spending too much time reviewing and that's why we don't get as far as we would like to get and I want to pick up where we were on Wednesday night on how brother Brandon made statements about a squeeze or persecution and he did not prophesy these things to cause Despair and to cause us to speculate and to worry and to fear and to guess could it be this could it be this is how how cruel is the vice president elect because if if Vice pres if president-elect Biden doesn't live very long because he seems so frail then who's gonna is this woman G to become president and is that going to be 10 um uh perhaps 12 years you know depending on what the rules are I don't know I'm a lawyer and I don't know you know how how many years can she run if she assumes the presidency because a resignation or something by the president and she could be elected to two more terms after she serves out Joe Biden and you're thinking could this be 12 years of Terror could this be 12 years of of what brother Brandon prophesied we don't know but we do know he did say certain things that we can be absolutely certain of and so he didn't say these things so that we would speculate guess and in our own guesses once we speculate say sure looks like it could be we don't do that we say I do know that what he said carried with it a promise and that regardless of the interpretation regardless of the Fulfillment the prophecy also points to a promise that he will perfect and he will provide and he will protect in the midst of the Fulfillment of the prophecy and so he shared these things and we're going to look at them again in the message Look Away to Jesus I apologize for not keeping up with this in the message Look Away to Jesus and these State statements that we're going to rehearse to you again the focus what he when he shares these things he shares them as a foundational point for his sermon so it wasn't the conclusion it was the foundation so it wasn't in the end there's going to be great trouble coming so watch the third pull then and then we're kind of like okay well let me know when the Trouble Comes because man once that trouble gets here I better watch the third pull then but until then we wait for the trouble and we almost take it as this was the conclusion of the matter so what we do just in physical in a physical sense we say all right then I'm going to look for The Squeeze so we're always looking for the pers ution and so here's the third pull over here but we're looking because whenever whenever the squeeze come whenever that comes I need to look over there so as soon as I think I see it and then all of a sudden there's a pandemic right and all the churches are getting shut down what does everybody do is this it huh and then everything kind of relaxes a little bit eases up everybody goes back to work and it's like okay maybe that wasn't it that wasn't it and what's happened is we're more squeez Lookers and persecution searchers than doing what we ought to do because he said this is a foundational point to the sermon Look Away to Jesus forget about those things they're going to come regardless if it's prophecy it's going to happen and you can't stop it no matter if we left right now and we went and prayed for the next 72 hours fasted and prayed in front of the elections Commission in Phoenix that the ballots would change miraculously that's not going to change prophecy God has spoken it's going to come to pass so the focus should be on the word that keeps us and protects Us in the persecution or the pressure that is to come whatever it may be instead of waiting for it to come and then in that moment of trial and tribulation like this is it this is the time hurry up real quick where's the third pull where is it he said we know what it is and what it does it's thoroughly identified it's been properly Vindicated what is it that's not the time to get into it I if you feel a little relief right now if you feel well things are looking okay and we had an election and we're getting through it and and yeah it might be harder on business and taxes might be different and there might be more of this there might be more of that but you know what we've been through democratic presidents before we've been through when the whole Congress was controlled by uh the Democrats we can make it we're going to be able to make it right I mean we could just look back on history and say we haven't it didn't fall to pieces even in the 60s when Kennedy himself which seemed to embody these very things that brother was talking it still continued and then when Bill Clinton who was a beatnick thought now this is fulfilling all the prophecy and all the quotes are being trotted out this is another Kennedy this is another Kennedy this is another we made it and what did we get we got a George Bush God bless him and and so there's all we have to be careful that we don't get caught in this mindset that's going to be a particular way prophecy is going to be fil fulfilled no matter what our our our focus is on the word because if it's not we get relaxed in a time like this we have to be we have to aim fellowship with brother Burley Williams it reminds me there's I I hear from a different Pastor every week from around the world that wants to greet you and uh and so there's a a pastor brother Andreas Bal in Switzerland who wanted to greet you and brother Tim dods wanted to greet you brother Bley Williams wanted to greet you that's just in like the past week so there's a lot of people that praying for you A lot of people excited about what God is doing and and I don't even know why I started sharing that but our Focus has got to be on the word that's right not the other things that are taking place it was brother bur that shared that you have to be aimed at and St and stay focused or you get relaxed you got to be a you got to keep your aim and if we if our aim's not on the word then we start looking at things say well the pressure is kind of easing up a little bit then you're then you you get relaxed and that's gives the devil the room to work so even if this morning we focus on a lot of statements that relate to pressure persecution squeeze it's not to take your eyes off the off the word to that in itself but to put it in the context that brother brand was sharing these things about a squeeze a tighten of persecution in the context of the third poll so we can only understand it as we look at the word because the persecution The Squeeze these tightening that's to come it's actually not just in the context of the third pole but it's an opposition against it so the devil can win if we're merely distracted from it so we got to be focused on the word now brother bradam says these statements and now now I I want to go quickly through this he says the third pole has now been Vindicated he says now it will not be used in a great way until this Council begins to tighten up and when it does when that does and then it's a fragment he says the Pentecostal and so forth can almost impersonate anything could be done so the tightening seems to relate to some impersonation some some expression some manifestation something so close he says but when that time comes when the squeeze comes down so now the squeeze is act he's relating The Squeeze to a Pentecostal impersonation isn't that interesting so if you if you can put it in that in that in that in those categories when the squeeze comes down then you'll see what you've seen temporarily be manifested in the fullness of its power now we identified in several places how the third pool is rapturing Faith it's the open of the word to give the bride rapturing faith in those few places we saw that continuity and that theme that the third pool is not some date in a future calendar that brother bam is identified and he looks at his plan and goes oh there it is third pull is on that day that that's not a future event but rather it's the word which is present the revelation of Jesus Christ brother brandham brought this word revealed this message to us we're still connected to it tied to it and this is the word that's feeding us and we're feeding on the message and we're still listening to those sermons and it's revealing to us Jesus Christ and the fullness of the power of this message is to be changed in our atom to go to meet the Lord in the air so he says you've got you've had the word you know what to look for and how to stand and he says talking about the pulls he says I think if you'll think real closely You Are Spiritual as the Bible said here's to him that has wisdom the third pull is properly identified we know where it is the third pole is here and then he says I'm not he wasn't to explain it but he says this will be the thing in my opinion that'll start the rapturing faith for the going away so it's thoroughly identified it's properly Vindicated it's here and it's for rapturing Faith it's for the the rapturing of the Bride so he's saying when that Council begins to tighten up when the squeeze comes down and this is really the only place that the squeeze is mentioned in specifically in relation to the third pool but we hear the squeeze mentioned a lot don't we when the squeeze comes when the squeeze comes and I remember as a young Minister I thought man am I going to have enough paper to print out all the quotes where brother M talks about the squeeze in relation to the third point I realized I could write this by hand you know it's just a just a one little statement where he refers to it but he also talks about tightening in these things so he says wait he says that wait till the time comes and he talks about the time coming then he says this there's coming A Time In This Nation where this nation is going to exercise all the power that the Beast had which was Pagan Rome then it become papal Rome this nation will do that Revelations 13 explains it he talks about how the lamb comes up speaks like a dragon he says don't you see Roman denomination a marked Protestant denomination an image under the beast making a power that'll force all Protestants like a union you'll have to be in this Council of churches you won't be able to have Fellowship well it's practically that way now and what do we see happen in brother bram's Ministry every door was closed to him if that hadn't been for the Full Gospel businessman's uh breakfast and conventions every door would have been closed to him that's why he was so grateful to brother Perry for starting a church in Tucson he said I couldn't do it he says i'm' so glad you did why because it was there was all the doors were closing it was the very fulfillment of these things they're putting them out putting them out after he preached these things even said when he's preaching the seals when I say this thousands T thousands of my friends are going to leave me over what the revealed word over what the third pull of his ministry it was those things that caused him to go away he says it's practically that way now you can't go to church and pre preach unless you have a fellowship card or some identification do you believe this doctor do you believe that doctor how do you see it and you and you now in persons like ourselves we're going to be cut out of that all together that's exactly because they won't be able to do it it's tightening they won't be able to force you into that Union so you'll be left out of that economy you'll be left out not a literal economy is as far as markets and buying and selling but rather even a spiritual economy or Fellowship you're left out of that they won't be able to push you into it it's tightening and when that time comes and the Press comes to a place where you're pressed out then then watch what I'm fixing to tell you in a few minutes watch the third pull then and what he began to tell them in the next few minutes was Look Away to Jesus so he says watch the third pool then it'll be absolutely to the total loss but it'll be for the bride and the church so the third pull is to the totally lost to the church and to the bride there's something in what's revealed in the open of the word that speaks to the totally lost that speaks to the church that speaks to the bride we know the totally lost will partake in the second death we know the church will have to go through tribulation and face white Throne judgment but the bride is raptured before tribulation and so he's connecting the tightening the persecution and the squeeze to the spirit of Rome he said Pagan Rome now papal Rome and when he does that he's identifying a particular spirit that persecutes and crucifies the revealed word so this is going to be in the name of Christianity it's going to be in the name of of unity wherein the word is crucified and the word is persecuted now this in the the summer of 64 brother brandham preaches a series of sermons if you take it from I think it's the trial that he preaches in Topeka you take from that sermon and it may be the Mighty God unveiled and listen all the way through question and answers and just and follow through with it listening to each one you hear brother brandham laying things out and expressing things in such depth and such deep detail that you realize there has been something that is crystallized in brother bram's Revelation where he's so focused on revealing Jesus Christ he's so focused on introducing the bride to the revealed word her mate which is what he refers to in this message Feast of the trumpets and things have become so clear that he's even more clear now on what kind of persecution and squeeze and tightening they'll be on the bride and I think I'll try to do it Wednesday night just seeding this in here for maybe Wednesday night if the Lord would lead looking at the things that brother brandham was identifying in 1963 that were causing him to see a physical persecution coming to the church but then how it transitions we realize there is a physical persecution coming to the church by the totally lost but the bride she is being pressed now Tried by the word tested proved now by the word but before it comes to the place that the Beast would exercise power over her to harm her to take her life or to to take things away from her she goes in a Rapture and so the message speaks to the trumpets and he's referring to Revelations chapter 9 verses 14- 16 he says he says this it was spiritual horses now those the 200 million demons that were loosed he says there spiritual horses spiritual Devils Chargers that have been bound in the Euphrates all these years Supernatural Devils what was it the old Roman empire being revived the persecution of the Jews now the Jews relate to the promise physically they are given a physical Promised Land the Gentile bride has a spiritual promised land they receive a physical Messiah we receive a spiritual Messiah they received a physical circumcision we receive a spiritual circumcision we see these these parallels uh these opposites so he says they this Roman Empire was revived in persecution of the Jews they were bound there 200,000 Devils of persecution now and notice what happens under the Sixth trumpet they were turned loose on the Jews the persecution of the Jews Supernatural Devils nearly 2,000 years then Loos by Stalin Hitler upon the Jews you say well that isn't Rome it's the same spirit and and why he says they done the same thing they did to Christians in the old Pagan Rome what was the martyrdom of the church he says now watch natural Israel and the spiritual church now as we separate it here turned loose on the Jews so he wants you to se separate between natural Israel and the spiritual church how there was something naturally loosed upon the Jews but the spiritual church is going to is suffer this somewhat differently so there is skipping that was paragraph 160 now this is 182 now the ecclesiastical realm has been opened from the natural Revival of the old Pagan Rome and he says went forth on the Jews which was always been their enemy The Lion the teeth and everything it stomped down broke out the people Roman Rome has always been God's enemy and we can see that represented in the Gospels how it was the Romans who were ruling and reigning there in Judea which brought the final uh crucifixion of Jesus Christ he says and it turned loose In The Same Spirit by the dictators of the world because the religious system was still holding now it's been loosed says what has it done so it was I want to point this out it was loosed in the dictators of the world because the religious system was holding because says now it's been loosed so it's not through the dictators of the world it's not through natural government it's not going to be physical remember the statement that it's the power of God that puts the bride put puts the bride in her position and takes her in the Rapture not National Force so he says this now what has it done in the cunningness as he said it came in like flatteries he's bringing the Protestant ecumenical council of the world churches the spirit of the Antichrist upon both of them bringing them to the slaughter just like they did the other in the hour to call the bride so while this Gathering is happening which is going to be a gathering to a Slaughter it's in the hour there's a calling of the Bride says you say the church has to go through the persecution for the Perfection of it sorry I I'm I'm skipping a little bit here so let me just get my place it's in and that hour to call the bride loosed in the ecclesiastical Church spirit so it's loosed 200 million demons are now loosed not through the dictators of the world and governments specifically but it's loosed in a church Spirit an ecclesiastical Church Spirit loosed upon what not upon the denominations upon the bride meaning its focus or its attack just as dictators Focus their attack on the Jews now this ecumenical Spirit through denominations through a church spirit is focusing its attack on the bride but here you'll get the bride will not go through that time what time the Gathering to together for a Slaughter so he says the Bible says not the church will but not the bride can't you see ministers can't you see that Brethren you say the church has to go through the persecution for the Perfection of it the blood of Jesus Christ perfects the bride a man who would choose his wife don't put her through a lot of punishment she's already found Grace he's already found Grace with her she's found Grace with him he's engaged to her and if there's anything he will keep her from every place to turn her hand words if there was anything that would keep that Union from happening he'll he'll step in he'll intervene to be sure that the union takes place his grace is so great upon them and so will it be upon the bride and so is it upon the bride we unworthy creatures deserving of hell but his grace holds us through it now brother bradam is specifically identifying 200 million demons loosed in an ecclesiastical spiritual realm through denominations against the elect against the word against the bride which will culminate after the bride's gone in in the mark of the beast and not being able to buy or sell even though brother mam says that's the the take the mark of the beast in the head would be to believe their Doctrine and the hand would be to support it so I'm always a little leery when someone forwards me something says look at this microchip technology could it be the mark of the beast I said I'm just going to go with a known known what brother brandham said it was in the forehead to believe the doctor in the hand to support it and so it's not a literal Mark in that sense then it's spiritual but yet it's going to have enough power to bring seduce everybody and cause them to behave a certain way act a certain way and we don't know what the exact interpretation will be when it's brought to pass but we do know when that time comes when that Antichrist is going to assume full control upon the Earth the bride which has been keeping him from doing that will be gone amen because only he will uh hold back until she is taken out of the way and so he's he's showing that the bride before it comes to a place of physical persecution before it comes to a place wherein the church is going to be challenged and pressed and they have to give their lives and shed their blood the bride is already gone because the bride will not go through tribulation saying his grace is so great upon her her favor is towards her that he'll do everything he can to take her in a Rapture before it comes to that place CU she doesn't need that for her Perfection we individually go through suffering go through difficulties hardships to perfect our character but when it comes to our our perfection in the word it's by this bleeding bloody word it's by the word of God that the bride is made perfect and we're the bride does not need to go through purging or tribulation to come out on the other end perfect she's already perfect in his eyes if I could just say this maybe as a personal conviction that really what's holding it away is for us to realize that we are perfect tell the the full realization that we're we're sinless and being sinless death has no hold over us and and this is where I think this transition it just comes up in my heart and this is what originally caused me to go down this pathway is if we won't fear death we won't fear anything so it is a spiritual persecution that brother bram's identifying in the cunningness in the flatteries and it's specifically related to an attack against the truth so it's a spiritual persecution that targets the bride not physical or material suffering does that mean a bride member doesn't suffer physically no it doesn't mean that does it mean that they won't suffer materially that doesn't mean that there's message churches that are shut down there's message ministers cast into prison but as far as that being the Fulfillment of these prophecies no many are the afflictions of the righteous all that will live Godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution we realize churches can be closed and things can happen in economics and tax laws and and and and even just persecution within a community that can cause hardships and difficulties and bodies to be restricted and and things could happen there there's any number of things that could happen we don't know specifically what tomorrow holds but we know who holds tomorrow and we know what he has said about certain things and we know before it gets to a certain point we've got to be gone and so my focus isn't trying to test just how far this can go my focus is looking at Jesus I want to get out of here and so these prophecies and this spiritual persecution is going to be just that it's going to be cunnings and flatteries and these are the Hallmarks of that religious system that brother bandam says will be so close as the Pentecostals and so forth can almost imperson anything when the squeeze comes down so think about that it's a it's this he identifies these characteristics even in Revelations 13 this the way that this thing will represent itself it's going to be so close to the truth right now forgive me especially since I think the election has been decided no offense to anybody who's wanting them to stop counting some places keep counting in others but Donald Trump president Trump was not close you know at all in my opinion as far as someone who's going to be so close would deceive the elect uh I mean I I'm not going to be reading from two Corinthians today and so uh what's your favorite verse in the Bible Bible which Bible so I I don't think that the the so close isn't going to be a political realm the so close isn't going to be in an e economic realm with economies and politics the so close has got to be something that presents itself spiritually pleasing appealing to the flesh something that would get so close that the bride would think well this has got to be this is could this be is this it and in Matthew chap 24: 24 it says for there shall arise false Christ and false prophets and show great signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect right you you you better rest in the grace of God because the fact that you can't be deceived is because he's made it impossible that's the only reason why you can't be deceived is it's an impossibility by God's design and by God's choosing but if you could Ponder just how close a false Christ a false prophet and what signs and wonders and gifts and things would be manifest that the elect could be deceived but for it being impossible for her to be deceived how close would that have to be and brother bam says this in the message Discerning the body of the Lord he says the last plague that hit Egypt was death that last plague that hits the church is spiritual death I believe that this will hold true now that as we are by God's grace going to emerge from this uh covid-19 through whatever discipline that takes personally or whatever measures that need to be put into place I just believe by God's grace I'm praying that it's something that will get Beyond we won't have to see any more people die from this but if there is another plague that comes upon the whole world just remember the only plague that falls upon the entire world that the bride is exempt from is the spiritual plague of death when it comes to the message and what brother bam taught he did not teach us that there's going to be a time when all the brid is upon Earth and her tests are coming back negative and everyone else is coming back positive the only test that we pass that no one else passes is the word test and so he says here the last plague what that hits the church is spiritual death what we need is a spiritual Awakening A Spiritual Awakening to discernment why because this last plague that hits the church is like the squeeze of a python brother B describes in the church age book that kills out the spirituality of the church says it's like the false Vine that winds itself around it what does it do it chokes out the life so when you see a vine vines can be growing up and if you you don't know which one is which you don't know is this the true is this the false when it it comes to that python wrapping itself around and squeezing the life out of it it's something that presents itself in a subtle seducing way he says the last plague that hits the church is spiritual death and that we need an Awakening to spiritual discernment so that's what we need a spiritual discernment to recognize the squeeze of a python not the squeeze of politics and governments and economies listen if you're going through a financial squeeze be honest with how financially responsible you are and don't blame your financial problems on the squeeze now brother brandham said no be real with yourself am I being responsible at least have this conviction that God has given you enough time in the day and enough money in the bank it's just a matter of using both wisely and if I could be use it more wisely then I can have enough instead of just blank just taking a quote well brother Ram said you and using these SE an excuse no financial difficulty and a financial squeeze isn't the way that this is going to be challenging to the believer it's the spiritual python that squeezes up the spirituality and life of the believer so in unveiling of God brother bam says this he says you remember the last plague in Egypt was Death Before The Exodus the last plague on the earth is spiritual Death Before The Exodus then they'll be cremated and turned back into dust and the righteous will walk out upon their ashes but the last thing is spiritual death rejecting the word so we could say for certainty that death and plagues and judgment and tribulation are coming but upon the bride the promises not one drop right not one drop Noah was safe in the ark before one drop fell so the bride is secure She is safe from any prophecy of judgment that's to come upon the church she's safe from any prophecy of Calamity or destruction that's going to come upon the whole earth and that and that and it's going to cause loss of life and this great massive scale I'm I'm not talking about plagues I'm talking about the judgments of God not talking about just diseases the judgments of God coming upon the Earth the bride is gone before that happens but the last thing that challenges the whole world while we're still here that we need spiritual discernment to recognize and to catch is spiritual [Music] death and so as brother brandham laid it out in Feast of the trumpets the pressure upon the elect is not the same as it was on the Jews and even it's not the same as it was upon the early church his brother said this is the Revival of old Pagan Rome or the papal Rome that crucified the Christians and destroyed the Christians and even Pagan r that crucified Christ it's revived in the persecution of the Christian and and it's revived in the H persecution of the Jews the persecution on the Jews in the early church the persecution on the Jews in this last century and the persecution on the early church is not the same as it is upon the bride so you had the martyrs in the early church that was something that they endured by prophecy that the word said would happen it's the same Spirit but a different manifestation of the persecution and you can see this by identifying the protection that God sends the church in the time of the persecution so so what I'm what I'm setting forth right now is that the spirits that bring persecution it manifested in the early church on the Jews to where they were martyred The Same Spirit manifested itself in the early church as in martyrdom to where the the spirit that was against the church produced a loss of life on when they were challenged according to what they believe the disciples the apostles being martyred for the cause of Christ and the early church being martyred for the cause of Christ and the spirit that God gives in that time speaks to the kind of persecution that's coming upon the body because we'll notice this in scripture God anointed them to go through this now in Revelations chap 4: 6 and 7 says and Before the Throne there was a sea of glass like into Crystal and in the midst of the throne and round about The Throne were four beasts full of eyes for before full of eyes before and behind and the first Beast was like a lion and the second beast like a calf and the third Beast had a face as a man and the fourth Beast was like a you got to say it the way he says it a flying eagle not just an eagle a flying eagle I think that's important important I think it's really important to recognize that the this last Beast is a flying eagle not an Earthbound Eagle not not an eagle with its wings clipped not an eagle changed to a a h changed to a a pen that keeps it upon the Earth but a flying eagle so this is uh it's remember the eagle is made for pressure can fly into Realms that nobody else can follow so now this is the scene Before the Throne now brother Bram connects these things together and if I'm assuming too much by not taking more time to teach on this I know God will just lead me in that channel to be more patient to lay these things out to you as a church but in Revelations chap 6: 3 and 4 says and when he had opened the second seal and we and we were going to maybe read through all of them how that when the seal was opened there was a beast and when he had opened the second seal I heard the second beast say come and see and there went out another horse that was red and power was given to him that sat there on to take peace from the Earth and that they should kill one another and there was given unto him a great sword now in the first seal when the white horse rider went out riding that was not Jesus Christ that was the Antichrist and the Beast that was there before the throne in the form of a lion or in the spirit of a lion was a spirit that God raised up in that time to meet The Challenge from that white horse rider so now under the second seal he is showing this this now that under the second seal he said I heard the second be say come and see and it's the ox anointing that comes and combats the red horse so now it's in this fourth Church age where the church goes into the ground in martydom where which finally dies out goes into the ground BR brah says in one place he says the denominations are the dirt that's a remarkable statement he says there's your dirt maybe even the way he phrases it but it's it's this when this seal is opened now here's the red horse rider going out but it's the spirit the Bible says a calf but it's an ox anointing now to meet the intensity of this Antichrist Spirit that's coming against the church in that age and brother Braham says in God's chosen place of worship the next beats was an ox which is a beast of burden a sacrifice in the days of the Roman Church the Roman Cathedral the church died out sacrificed so I want to identify this that when the church was had when the Antichrist Spirit had evolve from the White Horse to the red horse and now it's manifesting itself in the trying to Snuff out the church and the church actually dies and goes into the ground into this martyrdom brother saying there was a spirit a beast of burden a sacrifice on the church to do just that to shed their blood to give their lives as Martyrs this was an anointing that came upon the church so the the the the the church at that time had the spirit of an ox to be a martyr a calf if you even want to say a calf that would be taken to the slaughter they were anointed to be martyrs now watch in Romans chapter excuse me Revelations chapter 6 veres 7 and 8 and when he had opened the fourth seal I heard the voice of the fourth Beast say come and see so now the Seal's open a beast says come and see and I looked and behold a Pale Horse and his name that sat on him was death and Hell Followed With Him and power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth to kill with the sword and with hunger and with death and with the Beast of the earth so now when this seal is opened which is bringing us to the time of the leodan church age is bringing us to this very time and season that we're living in at the very close of this age even as we see some of these things come into perfect manifestation after the bride is gone brother Bram says in the fourth seal three powers United together all mixed up in a color pale death spoke in a whole thing Pol political and religious and demon powers mixed together so this is how it all gets mixed together politics religion and demon powers State and church United again political and religious but with the Demonic power behind it he says politics he's the king of politics Satan is amen I I said it Wednesday night and I don't know how many how many caught it but I said it's a shame that politics has become so political he's the king of politics itics it's always been political it's always been that way and so he's showing that the demon powers of Revelations chap 6 now come to a place where they're going to work they're going to manifest in a political religious and demonic power they're going to come to the head in the pale horse rider so now follow this because now we're in as we think this is the season we're living in this is the time that we're living in the demon powers are going to work spiritually again remember brother Ram said spiritually against the bride until this time because it's moving in an ecclesiastical realm in in the religious realm so these demon powers are working now in a religious realm demon powers in a religious L realm but one day it's going to unite together in political church and state United back together and so the pale horse rider rides out against the church but there's an eagle anointing upon the true bride and what kind of Eagle was it a flying eagle it wasn't a moping Eagle was wasn't a crawling Eagle it wasn't a scared Eagle it was a flying eagle so the pale horse rider is going to ride out upon the church it's going to take its full ride in that tribulation the P Horus Rider is going to have effect upon all those that are left upon the face of the Earth to kill with the sword with Hunger with death and the Beast of the Earth but there's an anointing of a flying eagle that comes and so it shows that as God gave the spirit of an ox in the day of the red horse rider because they were going to have to yield to that sword to die in this time he doesn't send the anointing of an ox he sends the anointing of a flying eagle why because you don't need to endure it and go through it until the very end when it takes its head in the image of the beast but rather you're gone in the Rapture before it comes to that time there shall arise false chres to sh in signs and wonders such Charisma and such magnitude to the point would deceive the elect of possible but now what does it say in Matthew CH 24:28 for wheresoever the marus says there will the Eagles be gathered together what kind of eagles flying Eagles gathered around the revealed word of the son of man in this hour right now right isn't that where we're gathered right now feeding on unfailing body word of the son of man knowing that what we're feeding on is going to actually cause a body to materialize and then where are these Flying Eagles going to go to a meeting in the air where we'll all have the same body gathered together to Christ in his glorified body because where the Eagles are right where that body is the Eagles are gathered together we're flying Eagles so it is the church that that is that faces the death that is under the the death under that pale horse rider but the bride is raptured under an eagle anointing so let's just settle this in our hearts the bride is not under a prophecy of death right we could at least settle that she's not under a prophecy of death she has the eagle anointing she is Anointed as an astronaut the bride age is the astronaut age to Fly Above denominations to Fly Above the Pentecostal age which is the Leo Dean age once you've heard the word of God for this hour you're raptured up quickly spiritually now right so you're not even in tune to what's going on here the our our sole consideration and concern right now for Leo is to get every seed out of it that is ordained to come out of it so the door has not closed I don't believe it's sealed off and I I believe in a bright age very very fervently very very passionately because brother Brandon believed in it but I'm not closing the door on leod DEA because I believe there's still souls to save in this Valley there's still family members that are going to come and be baptized you're going to see Transformations and changes in a very Supernatural way I'm believing for it why because we're looking now into Leo de seed and saying Lord show me that seed direct me to that last Soul because that one's got to be Qui quickly raptured out of Leota for the entire body to be caught up to meet the Lord in the air that's our conviction that's our belief so we're in another age and so the promise of our age is not a grave we're not we're not saddled with this anointing of an ox that's going to drive us to a grave but the prevailing promise I may have mentioned this a couple service ago the prevailing prophecy and the overarching theme of this message is life the very theme of this message is is provision protection if we were Anointed with the ox anointing and that was the spirit upon our age then it would be responsible for me to tell you you were made to die for this you were made to lay down your life you were made and that would be the emphasis that's that that is exactly how I would challenge you say look this is what we're coming to this is what's prophesied can't you see it's being accomplished this is what we're called to but we have not heard a voice that said remain in her until death but we've heard a voice that says come out of her brother bham said and there is a man here who could turn on the light that very morning before he preached Look Away to Jesus he says when the persecution comes don't get scared when the spiritual persecution comes when that last plague of spiritual death begins to knock on your door and try to get you to back down from the open of the word try to get you to back down from a real genuine faith in the promise of this hour don't get scared when the persecution comes he said don't get scared there is a light he said he would catch his people away before it ever turns into the physical persecution of the Pale Horse there's a man here who's going to take his bride away why he he'll turn he'll do everything he can brother Bram said if there's anything that'll keep him from turning her hand he's going to keep her from it because his grace is so great upon her now I I'm starting with this this worst case scenario death believing that if we could look at death and say you have no power over me that anything that would follow also doesn't have power over you what's the what is what is the greatest fear with covid-19 besides all the weight I've gained I caught a revelation of what the 19 was in covid-19 it's at least 19 pounds but the fear of it is death if it really was everyone can get it and they'll just be fine in the end then nobody would be scared the polit politicians wouldn't be scared the doctors the scientists everyone there would be no there would be no fear there would be no pandemic so to speak in the sense of panic it' be like well this is just this is just like allergies or just like sneezing it's just something that happens it's going to come and go but this is it can be so deadly right and so harmful to certain segments of the population that's the real re uh the real fear and then when you're told there's a marathon runner 45 years old I read it as a lawyer I I have different uh you know I'm not trying to drop that I'm a lawyer every time it just happens I'm going to try not to ever say that again as a lawyer I promise with my hands in my own pocket the I I received a bulletin that said that a a lawyer 45 5 years old healthy ran marathons never sick a day in his life succumbed to it and died now what does that do it creates the fear I'm a 45 year old I've been sick though is that what makes me different I've been sick so I won't die because I've been sick before and it creates a fear what it's the death that makes it fearful it it's the what's going to happen to my family and what's what is it's that Spectre it's that cloud so if you can get rid of the fear of death then you're not going to fear anything that Bluffs you with death right they said I could kill you like anything worse than that can you separate my soul from Christ can you can you leave my body in the grave but then also cast my soul to hell if you can't then I'm not afraid of you there's only one I fear and that's God and brother Bram said in the god making his promise and that's the greatest th thing that put fear over man was death so the thing that put the greatest fear over man is death he said the greatest enemy that man ever had was death to all men he called it the greatest dread and the greatest fear so what's man's greatest fear death what's man's greatest dread death what's the greatest enemy death the greatest thing that put fear over man was death so if you can be uh uh Fearless against the worst if we could take in in in what we're emphasizing now to you is that whatever lays ahead you should not fear even death because he's made a promise then that can give you certainty that if he's promised that I won't die then that means I'm going to have to eat eventually right or not have to eat anymore but still live because he's hasn't I'm not afraid of death this is his promise he's made to me and in the message Paradox brother Bram has that vision and I call it the Black Mamba vision and what is it he says about it if you're bit by it it's certain death and he said everyone was afraid of it and he said he saw it going after his brothers and they're just dancing away from everyone was scared to death of this black mama and it's represented death but he said he was 2third of the way right so we're coming to that third pull and when you come to the third pull it's this vision of this black mama this Black Mama's there in this third part that's where it comes in he says everyone's scared to death but as this Vision comes forward as it as a vision unfolds he finds that he's got power to B it everyone's scared to death what he do he bound it and he turned to that and sign he said and then he loosed it and this is what the voice says and the voice came from above me and said you've been given power to bind him the worst or any so in this third poll when we come to this this is the time under this word of God you're given power to bind death the worst and therefore since it's the worst you have power to bind any and these are the things that are made manifest in the temporary manifestations of the third pole you see that every phase of life there's power over it that there's a certain character there's a certain activity there's a certain uh confidence there's a certain provision and it's not so that we would be waiting for everything to line up like brother brandham would in a vision but to recognize we're walking now in a time in a season in a promise where we have provision in the word of God for everything and that we've been given power to bind death this vision of the Black Mamba two-thirds of the way to Jordan was something that was given to brother Brown to show that the power of this revealed word that was coming into the church that would be revealed in the church gives her power over the worst and therefore having power of the greatest she has power over the least we have power over it and if I could say it this way at the very least Saints it has no power over you where is its sting where is its Victory it has none so brother badam says as he says you've been given power to bind him the worst or any now let's just all admit it all of us would have said I didn't know that thanks and we would have walked away but brother BR says well God what must I do think about that the kind of humility to say then if I've given been given power then I have some responsibility then and he says what must I do and he said there's one thing you must do you must be more sincere this speaks to discernment you must be more sincere how are you going to bind death if you don't recognize it these are my words now this is me just impressing this upon your heart how are you going to bind something if you don't recognize it you just pet them python you just pet the Black Mamba because you don't have the discernment to recognize it that's why we need an Awakening to spiritual discernment he said there's one thing you must do be more sincere I want to be more sincere in the message Christian versus idolatry says the denominational church will just move right on into denom into domination and go on the way it goes he's talking about a battle conflict is coming he says the denominational church is going to move into domination or even denominations they're going to join the World Council churches it's just going to go on it's going to be forced into it's going to be driven into it he says but the real I mean the real True Believer is coming to that Battlefield what Battlefield is it you better be ver Versed and know what you're doing or you could take an evil spirit so easy and not know it if it's contrary to this word don't believe it stay with that word what word the message of the hour listen I think times people talk about reading between the lines and they literally mean I'm inventing things in the white space but to read between the lines is to catch the Revelation in the black what's being said I'm catching the revelation of what's being said reading between the lines isn't utilizing the white space between it to put your own interpretation and I believe this message is is complete it's perfect it's delivered to us the revelation of Jesus Christ to introduce us to our mate and it's enough to get us out of here if you'll just be more sincere with it and stay with it and not let all the fanaticism and all the other movements and all the other ideas and all the politics and any kind of persecution move us from that word listen there's never been a greater time to preach this message than right now why because I look out upon people who are battle scarred you're veterans there's been moves come through and push you moves come through and try you and especially with I see the young fam staying true to this message you've endured separation you've endured conflict you've endured H H uh just the the Venom and the animosity and the vitual and the hatred to try to convince you to walk away from this but you're still sitting here today you're still standing in Jesus Christ and there's never been a greater people to preach to than you right now never been a greater privilege people are hungry for the word of God not to be beat over the head with it you bunch of make Believers I don't come to church to get beat over the head I come come to church to have someone who knows how to handle a sharp sword and I say I'm going to yield myself so you can be a surgeon I'm going to yield myself so you can just delicately cut away all these things in these day of small things refine my faith bring me up with the Positive gospel not always bruting me beating me up like a bully with the club why because you're here you deserve the best you deserve a positive gospel we deserve we need to then stay with the message because the real true believers come to the battlefield that's where a fight's going to take place where this last plague is Fallen upon all the Earth and people are going into spiritual death you're coming to a battlefield and you better know what you're doing he says you better be well versed better be versed he says and know what you're doing I recommend that you listen we used to use a phrase for all your young people we call them tapes and that's not more than one of Scotch tape in a in a drawer I don't think there'd be the proper plural of that but we say listen to the tapes do you realize in that phone you have right now in your purse or your pocket you can have all 1,200 and listen not even on the local drive but in the cloud glory and you can listen to them whenever you want I think we ought to be listening to them amen I think we ought to be feeding on it we ought to be versed so that when someone sends us a quote and and we read it and we're thinking oh my I didn't know that you immediately say oh but keep reading you know what he says next that's the real meat of that that's the real perspective to that like oh yeah he did say that he did say that he didn't know about the third pool yeah I remember souls in prison now he did yeah that's right he was a lot of questions that's true but Have you listened to look away to Jesus you're well versed you know it you know what he said not just what somebody's saying about it but you know also what he said in the message how can I overcome I put my watch up here so I would watch it but I've looked away to Jesus all right this is long all right here we go let's go fast in the message how can I overcome I want you to see where this fear of death it's gone but the razor focus on what kind of persecution this is is going to be Amplified because there is a persecution that comes upon the bride and it's so close in the message how can I overcome he says we see this age that we're living in it's one of the grandest ages of all ages this leot Dean Church age is the grandest of all Church ages because it's the ending of time and the blending of Eternity and it is the greatest sinful age it's more sin in this age than there's ever been and the powers of Satan are many times harder to fight against than it was in any age back now listen because he says see here back there in the early ages a Christian could for his profession of in a church of belonging to Christ could be beheaded for it he could be killed and put out of his misery and go to meet God quickly he's phrasing it in a way that there was a time that if you believed God you went to meet him very quickly you put out of your misery it it was such a challenge of faith it was so uh Stark of a contrast where you you believed in Christ then you were crucified you were killed you were murdered so where was the test in that do you believe Jesus Christ yep off with your head it wasn't well now Jesus was actually it was different so he says this but now the enemy has come in in the name of the church and it's so deceiving this is the great age of deception so he's actually contrasting physical persecution unto death behind between the real temptation of this hour which is a deceitful deception the enemy comes in in the name of the church so deceiving in this great age of deception this great sinful age where the power of Satan are many more times harder to fight against not because it's death which would seem to be the worst thing to overcome but now it's so subtle it's spiritual death so he's he's he's he's brought this dichotomy the early church faced physical death by the spirit of this Antichrist but now in the end time it's worse he worse the subtlety of it because if you're spiritually dead what are you going to do die it's only those that are spiritually alive all those with eternal life go in the Rapture or the resurrection simultaneous Resurrection right I didn't get a lot of amens on that if you believe that you can say Amen to that if you don't I don't want you to say Amen but it might be a little bit of a litmus test what part five will be if you have eternal life you're coming up you're going in the Rapture so it's those who are spiritually dead that are going to die and so there's this brother Ram showing then that this great deceptionist last age is worse because it's not in your face do you believe the message or you're going to die so in Satan's Eden he says this let us look now to this great sinful day that we're now living in I don't believe there ever was a day that I've ever read in history there's been greater days of persecution with the children of God was put to death on every hand but to see the deceitfulness of the enemy we've never had a day like this we're living now now living it's the most cunning deceitful day and this is how this Spirit comes in flatteries this cunningness and when I see that it brings this that the Christian has to be more on his toe today than he ever was in any age you got to get on your toe more now than any other age in the days of marom maybe you could be flat footed right because it was so the the the the distinction was in such a way to so such a contrast denounce Christ deny CH Christ deny him just let you know walk away from this I'm giving you an opportunity right now to deny him and If you deny him I'll let you keep your life it's like no I can't do it it's too late the Revelation is already too clear and if somebody would take a gun to your head and put a gun to your head and say do you believe this do you believe that you could just say well yes I do and if that's the price I've got to pay then I got to pay but now it's a lot more subtle now there's political pressure that if you don't believe exactly the same way they can cut you out of Fellowship that that you you you're not invited you're not part there's a way that you feel ostracized and alienated because you don't believe a certain way and then there's political pressure put on because people can use the pulpit as a bully pulpit and sermons are preached and things are said and things are done and attacks are launched and phrased are used and it it takes a takes place in a totally different realm now where there's pressure to relent there's pressure to let go so you have to be more on your toe today now back in the days of persecution of Rome to the church the Christian make a mistake he went into the arena and was fed to Lions or something like that when they found him being a Christian for his testimony but his soul was saved because he's purely unadulterated believer in God and gladly sealed his testimony with his blood as the veins let loose or holes in his body and the blood bled out he would scream with real loyal Faith say receive my spirit Lord Jesus he's just described that anointing of an ox this anointed that could come upon a Believer now brother brandham actually says a number of places that the bride would be willing to give her life for this absolutely absolutely she would be but he says but now because that's not what you have to face if fact could put it this way martyrdom would be too easy isn't that what he says earlier I mean he could just be killed and go meet God quickly and his misery be over but he says but now the cunningness of the devil now makes the people believe that they are Christians when they're not there's the thing it's a more cunning day than when you had to seal your life away with your your testimony it's more cunning now than it was when you had to seal your life away with your testimony the devil has set every cunning trap he can he's a deceiver so this is the pressure we face not a pressure that's going to culminate in a sacrifice of our physical lives not a pressure that we Face where we have to we're going to have to lay down our lives or at least be faced with that where all of a sudden Mass men come in with AK-47s before they're outlaw and they tell us you better believe this message or you're going to die and we all say we believe it and they go to shoot us and their guns jam up and they panic and they flee and they say they saw angels surrounding us we're not all prophesied to have to go through that that's not what we're waiting for the cattle cars to round us up and take us to Alaska that's not what we're facing the squeeze and the persecution is going to bring pressure from close so close the python has got to get close enough to choke you and so the persecution of the Bride is because of her spiritual revelation of the word we're taught it's the false Vine that persecutes the elect the false Vine impersonates the True Vine in Galatians 4: 28-31 he says now we Brethren as Isaac was are the children of promise but as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the spirit so it is now so the carnal believer persecutes the real spiritual believer this is a principle that he goes back to the Old Testament he brings it here in the Genesis of the church and now we can see it even in the end that the carnal one that is born carnally after the flesh always persecutes the one who's born after the word nevertheless what sayith the scripture cast out the Bond woman and her son for the son of the Bond woman shall not be Heir with the son of the free woman so then we are not children of the Bond woman but of the free the seed is not air with the Shu but the Shu it'll persecute seed all day long why because that it looks so close but he says that those that are after The Flesh will persecute this is the pattern those that are close the Bond woman those of the Bond woman those who were after the flesh birthed even in the Revival as a twin but after the flesh persecute the word born and it's the twin of this message and this may be a mouthful and I'm just going to move on from it the twin of this message persecutes the bride because of her Revelation that's the truth it's because of her Revelation that the twin of this message persecutes her because that's what happened in the beginning the first set of twins Abel was persecuted by Cain because of his Revelation it was when God had respect unto Abel's sacrifice it was when he knew that she that he had Revelation that he was wroth and the same spirit is identified with that twin today where the Revelation is he hates it so now we have to be thinking in more specific terms about what persecution would be other than this General persecution of do you are you a Christian listen some of the people that we vilify and and again I'm talking about the elephant and donkey in the room the politics the election some of the Democrats that we vilify the most are better Christians than the Republicans that we uh admire the most when it comes to Christian being decent actually going to church and doing things that you would normally do as a Christian that we would the the Democrats and even some of the more social Democrats that you would say Well they're the they're just socialist whatever they're they're they are they are faithful to to their religious faith of Christianity they're they're strong adherence to it they they believe in it they they they they they they attend church and they they have their churches that they go to they support them and the the pressure the persecution of the politics of it that's going to really come and nail us down is it going to be in a political realm it's a political spiritual realm watch the third pull because the persecution of the squeeze is an attempt to keep you from it notice the language brother brand uses he says don't you let somebody squeeze something into you that's not thus sayeth the Lord what's the squeeze trying to do squeeze something into you that's not thus sayith the Lord when that squeeze comes to squeeze something into you that's someone's opinion private interpretation don't let them do it don't let them squeeze something into you that's not thus sayith the Lord in the message in time evangelism this brings us around to the uh our text in the beginning Peter had a sword he pulled that sword and was going to cut the high priest ear off and things like that he did it but when it come to real Christian Courage he didn't have it he backed up and denied him is that right he could cut the high priest ear off with his sword sure he knowed how to handle it but when it come to the squeeze and the time to stand on the word of God he didn't have the courage and even denied he knew Jesus that's where it is today not in a Physical Realm we've got to be willing to draw a sword if you reading that passage it's really interesting uh they they they they say we have two swords you know they tell Jesus we have two swords is that enough he goes it's sufficient it's really interesting he told him I told you before you know not to take anything but this time take a sword take a script take these things with you but this sword that we wield is not a physical sword it's this the king sword and he says that's where it is today the squeeze and a time to stand on the word of God do you have courage to stand on the word of God we got courage to build buildings and put millions of dollars in them we got courage to put pipe organs and plush seats and everything and go out and proelite from place to place and make the methodists come Baptist and so forth and back and forth like that but when it comes to Christian Courage to accept the word and the message of God and stand there on it we are few there's where the squeeze is do you have the courage courage to stand on the message of God the courage to stand on thus sayith the Lord when the squeeze came it was pressure to squeeze into you something that's not this thus sayith the Lord squeeze came to get you to renounce to to let loose of your faith all right I've run out of time again so we're going to skip there is no promise of no suffering or there's there's not a promise of no suffering we're going to suffer there's hardships there's difficulties there's persecution there's Affliction there's things that we may go through but you're made for this what's going to be the source of our courage in a time like this the word of God what are we looking to the word what are we looking away from all all the towers that are being built on the other side of the Jordan you've entered into your Promised Land your job is to place every devil under your feet your job is footsteps as possession let them build what they want on the wrong side of Jordan let them erect their altar so high you could see them let them build out things so great so tremendous let them uh try to intimidate bully you all they want stay focused on the task at hand I was going to share some things with you we just we'll save it for another time but brother said there should nothing bother us nothing worry us we are his there should nothing bother us nothing worry us we are his but notice what he says here in the church age book chapter two they were safe in his care for nothing could pluck them out of his hand and neither could anything separate them from the love of God let it be sickness Peril nakedness famine sword life or death they were truly yielded to him and kept by his omnipotence they were not concerned about the persecution that came their way pain and derision was not was but caused to give glory to God that they were counted worthy to suffer for him this ought to be our attitude and were so focused on his care so focused on his word so yielded to him and kept by his all his power that we're not concerned about the persecution that came our comes our way we're not concerned about what the future may hold regardless of the coming persecution regardless of the test there's no reason to fear I'm actually going to be so focused to him on him so yielded to him that I'm not going to be paying attention to it am I could come out on the other side and be like oh that's what that was I didn't realize that I passed a test didn't even know I was taking it why you're so focused on the path that he has for you and the end time pressure cannot defeat you Peter even says the trial of your faith is more precious than gold your individual faith will be tried but the trying of it is the purging of it the trying of it is the purifying of it this the end time pressure the end time conditions the persecution whatever it may be even as I'm emphasizing how brother B talked about this python would come and this this subtle spirit and this persecution would come up as a twin within even the message and it would try to choke out the life in you and it would persecute you and try to alienate you and separate you you don't have to fear the worst or any because you're made for this end time pressure it can't defeat you it can only perfect you because Eagles are built for it you've been anointed as a flying eagle I've been pondering this over the last couple weeks about a diamond it's the only gem that's made up of a single element carbon and it takes very very specific conditions for carbon which you know it's abundant in Coal right not very valuable seemingly trying to get away from it now right clean energy but it's certain conditions within a very specific depth range that's required to that forces the carbon to crystallize into a diamond has to be carbon it has to be at a specific depth in the earth and at that place there's certain temperatures and certain pressure that comes to bear on carbon and it forces it to crystallize forces it to become a diamond it's high pressure high temperature over 800,000 pounds per square inch of pressure and over 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit someone has to know where to place that carbon at the right place in the earth and exert the right pressure and right temperature to force it to crystallize into a diamond and listen your diamonds I could use a cucumber analogy you're pickles you're not just carbon you've been forced forced to crystallize into a diamond there's nothing that can defeat you there's nothing that can destroy you there's nothing that you should be worried about you're made for this time you're made for this season and now I I like to end with this statement the musicians if they would come Church age book chapter 4 be Faith be thou faithful unto death he does not say be faithful until death but unto death you may have to seal your testimony with your blood thousands J Millions have died during all the ages they died in the faith like Antipas the faithful martyr they held not their lives dear unto death I want you to catch this often we think that it would be almost impossible to be a martyr but dare to recall that the faith we daily use to Triumph in Christ Jesus is the same faith that upholds the polycarp and all Martyrs and then I love this statement the Supreme faith will give Supreme Grace for the Supreme hour he says blessed be God forever the Supreme faith will give Supreme Grace for the Supreme hour whatever's to come his Supreme Grace is is going to be evident with us because he's given us the Supreme faith for the Supreme hour whatever's coming whatever we're facing whatever's uncertain I don't know what's happened in the news since yesterday we don't know what might happened and with politicians and governments and there's always a threat that states could succeed secede from a union and there's all sorts of well this could happen and that could happen and martial law and they could stack the Supreme Court we're not worried about it I'm not worried about the Avenues through which the persecution can come I acknowledge that persecution can come I acknowledge that all that live Godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution I acknowledge that many are the afflictions of the righteous I acknowledge that brother bandam said things that could cause fear to the carnal believer about church doors being closed and being chased and hunted and persecuted but I'm going to look away to Jesus and I'm going to stand here solidly believing that the Supreme faith will give Supreme Grace for the Supreme hour and that this faith I have is is equal to it's just like the same faith that polycarp had the same faith that antios had the same faith that led to the place to where they can lay down their lives is the same faith I'm carrying today so I need not worry about pressure that may come politically socially economically but I promise to look out after you pray for you we do this as Believers as members of this body of Christ we we look to one another and I say I'll be praying for you in your difficulty I'll be uplifting you in prayer if you need a job let's pray to together let's see the channels that I might have if you need food come join with mine if you need toilet paper I've stockpiled back in March we'll take care of each other we're not afraid of what's to come we won't fear what man can do to us we won't fear what pandemics can do we won't fear plagues coming upon the Earth we won't fear Politics the Supreme faith will give Supreme Grace for the Supreme hour but you know what won't Supreme speculation if I told you right now it's coming Saints you better get ready for it shortly after the inauguration every message church will be closed tax laws will be changed they'll shut us down before we get out of 2021 I'm telling you right now you might as well get ready for it we're all going to be without churches we're going to be meeting in our homes and if I told you that as speculation just presuming certainly speaking outside of what brother brandham said if that's not thus sayeth the Lord it will only produce fear and carnal preparation for something that's never coming we mentioned before baptizing into 1977 how many are still eating from the stockpile of 2000 right when the clock hits midnight and December 31st 1999 the whole world economy is going to fall apart and you're going to be glad I've got all those rice bags in the basement because people built up something very large we don't need to do that we can focus on the word of God Supreme faith will give Supreme Grace for the Supreme hour let's stand to our feet [Music]
