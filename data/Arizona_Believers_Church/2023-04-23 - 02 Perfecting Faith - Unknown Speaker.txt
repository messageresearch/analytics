TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I'll give you my title for this morning at the outset it's perfecting faith and as we were on the subject of perfecting love last Sunday I want to look at it from the angle of perfecting faith today and before we get to the subject of perfecting Faith we're just going to revisit um the subject of perfect love for a little bit this is a series on uh perfect love and God's dealt with us on a number of different levels in terms of that subject and so instead of maybe building in a series as we would in different subjects I feel there are so many different principles related to perfect love that we'll just address them as the Lord leads and if it is in little Parts together with different subjects we'll do it and just have that Liberty to do it but perfect love I know it's a phrase that's familiar to all of us we've already read um that you hear in the scripture where it says perfect love casteth out fear it's the one place where that's put together in that way but as we read in First Corinthians chapter 12 and 13 and 14 we saw that love is the greatest and that charity as it's referred to even being the person of God and this essential attribute of God it is the sum of all Perfection it's greater than Faith greater than hope and that it is something that ought to be our chief suit so charity follow after charity make it your aim make it your goal and we even find that John is admonishing the Believers in his letter here in first John that not just love God but if you love God manifest and express that love to others and so there's just a lot of breadth and depth to the subject of perfect love now if you look at Verse 18 where we just read it says there is no fear in love and I'm just going to review perfecting love for a few moments there is no fear in love but perfect love cast out casteth out fear because fear hath torment he that feareth is not made perfect in love and remember how we looked at that and we said that our tendency is to try to do the math and say that if I have fear then I don't have perfect love and if I if I if I'm fearing then God's love hasn't cast out fear and if I'm fearing that I don't have perfect love to cast it out and I feel like something is wrong just by the way that we we look at this and we're wanting to look at it from a different angle to where we're not using it to judge ourselves but we use it to encourage ourselves and we took the phrase perfect love and we looked at how God's love is already perfect and that his love cannot be uh cannot decrease nor can it increase it cannot diminish or grow stronger God loves us with the perfect love and it is already perfect and cannot be made perfect so there's phrases we use of the love of God and it could refer to our love for him or it could be the love that God has for us and so because he loves us and his love is perfect we say his love is perfecting and we're making complete our love his love is a perfecting love it's accomplishing something it's a love of a higher intelligence it's a love that has a goal so when it says it's perfecting and even if we say love is made perfect means love did its job love accomplished something and so so instead of looking at it as maybe the finality of something or the litmus test of whether or not something exists we just say oh love is working love is accomplishing something love is doing something that's what it says he that feareth is not made perfect in love we I believe it was towards the end of the service we just said it just means there's more of him to know that if there's fear and perfect love casteth out fear then there's more that I can know about his perfect love that can address the fear that I have in my life that there's room for my love to grow if I believe that I love God and I love uh my brothers and sisters and I have the love of God in my heart but there's fear or there's doubt or there's some sort of uh emotional disharmony we don't just say oh never been there to begin with I got to start all over we just realized oh more of him to know more of him to experience more of him to grab a hold of and we realize that we can always fall deeper in love with him and First Corinthians chapter 8 and verse 3 it says but if any man love God the same is known of him and I think the takeaway from this as we read it says that he that loved God we believe oh that God knows the one that loves him but one way that we could say this based upon what we read in first John is you can't love God without knowing god and because you've known him you love him and we love God because he made himself known to us we don't love God because of what our mom told us as we were being raised you don't love God because what the preacher said we don't love God because of Sunday school we love him because he made himself known to us and in making himself known to us we fell in love with him whatever attribute that was whether it been forgiveness or whatever way that he began to make himself known to us we love him because he has made himself known so you can't I love him first it's because he knows you and you know him we looked at how that knowing the love of God necessarily has an influence upon the knower you cannot know the love of God without loving him back if you say well I know that he loves me but I don't love him then no you don't know that he loves you it's something that's true knowledge has an influence and as we read already in first John 4 19 we love him because he first loved us that's the reason the reason we love him is because he first loved us that's what begets our love that's what inspires our love and so when we look at how his love is being made perfect or his love being perfected in us his love is perfecting our love for him the love that we have in US is being perfected or do we do we live sinless lives do we never make a mistake do we never doubt we realize we do we make mistakes and we and we're sinning but his perfect love for us is perfecting our love for him that it could manifest itself in the ways that Christ spoke of if you love me you keep my Commandments Paul said if you love him you keep his Commandments and his Commandments are not Grievous John says if you love them you keep his commandment because here is the love of God that you keep his Commandments realize I'm not always doing what I should but you want to and it's his love that enables you it's his love that will help you to grow and so we have this love for him that's being perfected and then we see so much in the word of God as how it's not just our love to him but it's our love that's projected outward this love that we want to express and manifest outward uh we do not we're not cultists with this love and it's the secret love affair to where nobody knows but we want his love to be manifested through us and to others and that's the real thrust of what John is writing he's not trying to teach them about the love of God he's trying to teach them about the fact that if you do love God and God loves you then love your brethren and so that was the perfecting love his love is perfect love our love is being perfected growing maturing his love is accomplishing something our love is accomplishing something and it's this beautiful process and if I could sum up uh maybe what was that the core this might even be at the core of the whole series is that perfect love is obtainable because of his perfect love in other words I I can achieve this perfect love because of his perfect love I'm not going to sell myself short I'm not going to sell the promises of God short I I believe that Perfection is not Out Of Reach because of his perfect love from me and we want we want his love this perfect love to be something that we we're Desiring not begging for but Desiring to come into now as we go forward in and there's just a lot of things that even this morning I just felt too uh maybe a step away from and address uh at later a later time if God could just give me Grace maybe I'll just mention it right now it may be I don't want to be clumsy in saying it but it's a point that's trying I feel to make and and I want to be careful on how I say it because I guess there's just a way that it could be misunderstood and and if it is I'll take the blame because I'm the one saying it but there's times that we will that brother Brandon teaches something even the Bible is expressing different principles on a subject uh and it's in its truth and it's real we know it's revelation we know it's the word of God we know this Bible is an absolute and so we kind of gather statements as the truth and we kind of compile them as statements of fact about something and and I find I'm just going to say what I was wanting to maybe just leave off for another time but then that kind of becomes that becomes it like that's the truth when you say brother Brandon says faith is a revelation of God's will we're like if somebody said well faith is a confidence in God you're like no no no no faith is a revelation of God's Will and what we do is we take what we call these statements a fact about a subject and we make that the whole truth about the subject and we put a period on it and it's not that it's not truth but we have to recognize that God is truth and God is his word and so there's truths that are spoken in Revelations that are given not so that they could kind of be carved out as statements of fact or doctrines with the period on it but it's all for the purpose of making God known to us and so if brother Branham says something about uh perfect love and and maybe it's just very clear very succinctly no that's what perfect love is it's not said so that we could put a period on what perfect love is it's so that we can understand the truth the truth about perfect love which is God and so I I thank you for the grace and be able to express that and I hope it makes sense that we can hear truth believe truth and there can be statements of Truth or statements of fact but we have to be careful that we're not putting a period on it and just looking at the black and white looking at the quotation and saying well this is what it says and this is what I believe but recognize that that's meant to convey an understanding about Christ about the word so that we could know him and that's been one of the things God's been impressing upon me as I've studied the subject of perfect love is it's not about just getting all the definitions down but it's realizing in all the things that are said about it it should be adding to this beautiful full picture of who God is and what the word is to us and so I I think that was uh appropriate to say there because I want to use a statement and I believe I have a slide for this is there just a statement There Brother John this is perfect love nothing can enter here without it how many have heard that before and I believe that some of you probably already thought of this phrase over the last week or so maybe as we've been prefacing this subject coming up brother Banner makes this statement in the rejected King and he's talking about his experience of going beyond the curtain of time and I believe this is the Angel speaking in response to brother branham's awareness that there's very there's something very different about what he's experiencing and it describes the atmosphere it describes the feel and it describes just even that Dimension as this is perfect love nothing can enter here without it and so maybe your mind's kind of wondered there over the last week or so that you have to have perfect love to be there nothing can enter there without perfect love and when brother Brennan was describing this Dimension he calls it Perfection or actually what he says is perfection or Sublime cannot even adequately describe it so brother Ram's having a difficult time describing what it's like and he's saying well Perfection can't do it uh Sublime can't do it he says everything and kind of the thing that sounds like he's satisfied with is saying everything was perfect love so Perfection couldn't describe it Sublime couldn't describe it but when he would say when the angel said this is perfect love and brothers says everything was perfect love and for in the sermon from that time this is echoing the sentiment that without perfect love you cannot enter into this place of perfection you can't enter into this as that Dimension was a place of all these redeemed saints that they were gathered together in this dimension of perfection he says except that you have perfect love you'll never be there now brother bam is taking this a very direct statement because nothing could ever be there without it he said your spirit would be out of place there so without perfect love you wouldn't belong you'd be out of place whatever your wants and whatever your desires were you wouldn't you wouldn't uh you says you would be out of place and he says except you have that perfect love you will never be there so this is perfect love nothing can enter here without it unless you have that perfect love you'll never be there those are very uh obvious statements how many have heard those statements aware of those statements conscious other statements so what we're doing now is we're looking at the statements to gather something from it in the sermon or in beyond the curtain of time brother Neville is reading from the Full Gospel business since newsletter wherein it recites brother branham's story and so it's it's brother Neville reading what was written in this publication and it's and brother Branham is the first person he says I am more convinced than ever in my life that it'll take perfect love to enter that place so here's this is showing us just how important perfect love is if you want to be there you got to have perfect love and I believe what that does is it kind of heightens our sensitivity to whether or not we have perfect love and especially once we've read first John chapter four we're like well if I fear my love is not made perfect perfect love casteth not fear so there's a lot of things that are starting to enter into our our thought process to tell us about what perfect love is what it isn't and now we realize without it I can't even be there so it's a very a significant subject it says I'm more convinced than ever in my life that'll take perfect love to enter that place there was no jealousy no tiredness no sickness no old age no death only Supreme Beauty and joy whatever you do lay aside everything else until you get perfect love and pray this is important this is a tremendous emphasis get to where you can love everybody even every enemy this is Brother Neville right this this can't be brother Branham he says get to that where you love everybody and even every enemy no matter if the plane is rocking the sinner The Guns of the enemy are upon you these things do not matter get perfect love if you're not saved except Jesus Christ is your savior now if you've not been baptized in water be baptized now if you've not received the baptism of the Holy in the Holy Spirit receive it now he says press on in that perfect love which will take you to that beautiful and joyful place beyond the curtain of time these are statements I know that we're very familiar with true statements and and important statements to consider but this is where I would remind us to be careful because we could very easily create a litmus test again and ask ourselves well do I love everybody do I love my enemies am I laying aside everything to get perfect love and so what we do is we kind of invent a new level to attain to in order to get into heaven or to get into this dimension and we say well I know what salvation is and I know what it is to be born again and I know what it is to believe the message I know what it means to have the Holy Ghost but what I need to do is I need to get perfect love in order for myself to be there and I would say this these statements were never meant to carve out an another experience that we need to achieve in order to be in eternity it's not that the word has always been the same and brother Brandon preached something and then he has this experience beyond the curtain of time and he's like oh I've been wrong all this time about something uh we need to be saved we need the Holy Ghost but whatever you do is press into that perfect love and now somehow opened up a mystery to this other level that can be unlocked and we can attain to in order to be in that dimension brother bam says in the sermon from that time we've already read he says except you have that perfect love you'll never be there and now listen to how he says except you're born again and the spirit of God of love comes into your heart you'll certainly miss that place so notice how he says the same thing but maybe uses a language that we're a little bit more accustomed to except you're born again and the spirit of God of love comes into your heart you'll certainly miss that place so except you have perfect love you'll never be there and brother says unless you except you're born again you'll never be in that place unless you have the spirit of God of love that comes in your heart you'll certainly miss that place then he says it this way and Beyond the curtain of time brother says I don't understand this this is something entirely different from our human love I don't want to go back to that old body on the bed then a voice spoke to me this is what you preached that the Holy Ghost is this is perfect love nothing cannot enter here without it so it says uh this is showing us and I believe that we'll have opportunity at some point to address the evidence of the Holy Ghost on this subject since brother Branham brought love into view when he discussed that because this is what you preach the Holy Ghost is this is perfect love nothing can enter here without it so what's our takeaway perfect love is the baptism of the Holy Ghost perfect love it is a new birth it is it is God who is love dwelling inside of you permanently and so brother Branham has not taken us from into a new birth and and we we've been born again and we have the Holy Ghost and we're serving God and all of a sudden it's like and you need to get perfect love and we're all sudden like I didn't realize this I didn't know this I didn't realize that I could have the Holy Ghost and somehow show up in this Dimension and say yeah but do you love that guy who dented your car and you're like uh which guy you mean my car got dented right and you and you're realizing oh there's this conflict of emotions maybe I won't be entered in it's not it if you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost it is perfect love perfect love is the baptism of the Holy Ghost it is the new birth it's God who is love dwelling inside of you so he has not in going beyond the curtain of time he wasn't trying to these things weren't being expressed by the angel or brother Brahm and his response to what he was experiencing was not trying to come and then give us a language that we would restrict ourselves to to uh redefine what it means to be born again but it was meant to understand better what that experience is and what it ought to produce brother Brandon and I wish I would have written it down I just have the phrase here he says place within your heart he's praying for his sister he says place within her heart tonight that Divine love that holy spirit of God so the spirit of God is divine love God is love and God and there's ways that God is described he's a consuming fire these attributes and characteristics of God that Divine love place it within our heart what is that Divine love the holy spirit of God in the sermon why is it that so many Christians find it so hard to live the Christian Life One of the longest sermon titles he says may you thoroughly understand that it isn't Church it isn't intellectuals isn't knowing the Bible is it any of these things it's God's love the holy spirit in the middle of that spirit that you've quit drinking and quit smoking and quit lying what is it it's God's love the holy spirit in the middle of that spirit and God's love is a perfect love and without perfect love you will not be there and I'm not just simply doing math and I'm not just drawing logical conclusions these are the teachings of scripture this is the teaching of brother Branham that it's when he says nothing but perfect love will be there he's talking about the Holy Spirit as a seal upon his person's soul that should be there and then I believe we're admonished by brother Brandon and say make sure you have that lay aside everything else until you get that press into that whatever you do press on in that perfect love and I believe that it's also an admonishment to those of us who have this new birth experience to recognize what I possess is the love of God and remember one of those outstanding characteristics of the love of God I think was when we were preaching on this series of Christ my healer is that that for love to be projected and to have that kind of love the love of God is to love when it's difficult to do so or to love when we believe it's Justified not to or to love when we find that it's very very difficult if not impossible to do it that's the love of God could you not agree with that that the love of God loves when it's impossible for us to love his love can love and brother Branham and other places I believe this might be an adoption part four he says perfect redeeming unadulterated love of the Holy Ghost into a human soul that's passed from death into life notice how he's using these phrases and I just used some quick ones because we're wanting to go forward in this subject how that the perfect love is God perfect love is eternal life eternal life is the Holy Spirit dwelling in a person Soul by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and so he has not created another surprise level that we now that we have the Holy Ghost and we're sealed Sons and Daughters of God that if I'm ever going to be there I now have to press into perfect love and this is a new mystery about the message no I believe it is the same holy ghost that we've heard preached before but it's helping us to understand what that Holy Ghost is I believe that when we look at it this way and we take what brother Branham not when we look at it this way but when we understand what brother Branham is saying it removes the complication that if there was a part of us that felt well I know I got the Holy Ghost but I need that perfect love as some sort of Entry requirement then maybe we didn't quite understand it the Holy Ghost allows you to be there but if you recognize you don't have perfect love then that's what you want to do is press into that perfect love I believe it removes the complication I believe it takes us out of the place of I'm trying to make it I'm trying to make it I want to prove myself and make sure that I'm going to make it it takes it away from this realm to where haven't you noticed that sometimes whether it's our own doing or somebody else is just doing this to us they take the word and they always just put it just Out Of Reach you're like that rodent in Ice Age who's just always right just always so close right I don't know why it reminds me of Lucas because I remember he would always dramatize not this Lucas Lucas coffee would always dramatize and tell me the story of we're going back 20 years now though uh and and it's just always Out Of Reach and just as soon as you get there preacher says but and it just starts rolling further away from you and every time you get close it just gets moved just a little bit more and move just a little bit more it's almost as if the preacher's panicking that you'll get it right so perfect love is not Out Of Reach things and if you have the Holy Ghost you have perfect love so perfecting faith it was remarkable how the Lord dealt with me on this and I I realize that we'll just go it's going to go slowly through uh this without necessarily a real clear track but just knowing there's different things that the Lord may cause us to pick up as we go along but I realize that in that you cannot address perfect love without also addressing perfect faith just found out that I could not refer to the one and preaching on perfecting love and faith not be a part of the conversation in the sermon perfect Faith we're drawing a lot from this sermon he says in faith and love is relation because you can't have faith unless you've got love because your faith is in a God Who is the very essence of love Faith and love works together you know it's a very familiar statement to all of us but brother Branham has now related them and I would say he's putting them together in such a way to where he says well it's just obvious he says you can't have faith unless you have love and so they both work together so it's not in this it's not that we'd say oh well you should only have this or you should only have that but they're complementary to each other and they work together as we look before in First Corinthians 13 it says the greatest of faith hope and charity is charity and he says but now is faith hope and charity why because you need the faith and you need the hope but one day they're both going to be assumed into the summation of all perfect love and into into the sum of all Perfection which is charity and so they're complementary to each other they work together we don't cause them to fight each other and say well my charity can beat up your faith right and and maybe wouldn't surprise me if those words haven't been used given the names that are given sometimes to children but it is a it is not a competition but they work together in Galatians chapter 5 verses 5 6 and 7 for we through the spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith so there's that hope that we have because we believe and because we have faith it says for in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth anything nor uncircumcision it's not what you have done in the flesh or the condition of the flesh that's going to Merit you righteousness in Christ because it's through the spirit we wait for the hope of righteousness by faith not by circumcision not by legalism not by discipline or Not by avoiding legalism nor uncircumcision but he says but Faith which worketh by love I think this is good to recognize this Faith which worketh by love this phrase is to me it's a it's a really easy one to remember and to recall and it's it's Faith Faith Works by love it operates by love and then he says you did run well who did hinder you that you should not obey the truth so as he's as you follow this progression you have faith and you believe and you have this hope and expectation of righteousness by faith and he says and this is faith that works by love and we know that love manifests itself in doing the Commandments of God now believe it maybe chapter six where he says this is the love of God that you keep his Commandments and his Commandments are not Grievous and he's saying you did run well what's hindering you what's keeping you there was something in you that was good there was something in you doing well but what's keeping you from obeying the truth but what I want you to focus on is this Faith which works by love this is the principle of life that there is something inside of you there is there's a power inside of you and Faith expresses its power through love Faith expresses its power through obedience to the word of God you believe and you have faith well then it's love that's operational it's love that's acting I have faith but I also have love which is operational love is acting brother Berman the sermon desperations and I know we've tracked these exact things over the last couple years here he says and I don't believe we did it five years ago we've done it in the last two and a half years here and he says and the only way that you can have faith is have love first so now he's given us some sort of order to this and I would say it's important that we don't try to uh get completely dissect this and be able to become uh the Apologetics on this and say no you what you know what came first we know what came first the chicken not the egg but to rather just recognize that there's some there's some principles trying to highlight something's trying to emphasize the only way that you can have faith is have love first because after all faith is Love's incentive incentive that's exactly what faith is it's an incentive to love now if you don't have love you can't have faith so without love there is no faith and even when it comes to feel your love it's the feeling of love and affection that you might have for somebody that kind of gives you the confidence in them or trust in them and he's saying what about agape love what about the love of God and loving God and he says faith is Love's incentive it's the thing that motivates or encourages what motivates one to do something it's what encourages one to do something so I say it this way and I'm going to find myself inverting it but Faith motivates love Faith motivates action we looked at how that love is something that can be expressed and not just be a feeling and so Faith motivates love but then we also recognize that if you have love first it motivates and encourages faith so you have you have love for God and that love for God gives you confidence in God gives you trust in God I would say that this could very well be at the core of a lot of our a lot of people's issues when it comes to trusting God and believing God is it's as if we present to them confidence absent love oh you just need to believe them you just need to trust them you just need to put your faith and confidence in God and you're like I'm not even sure I know who you're talking about I'm not even sure I don't know this God you're speaking about I don't know what his nature is his characteristics are why should I trust him and listen that's a valid comment when you just try to get people to blindly trust in a deity because we're using the phrase God and we think we know exactly what we're talking about well you just need to believe the message you just need to believe the message you just need to believe the message and to them the message is a character that they don't love the message is is embodied in personalities that have misrepresented the nature and character of Christ and so you're asking them to trust something that they detest or they don't even know and so what we should desire more than anything is not that just people would come to trust the god that we trust but that they would know the God We Trust in whom we've learned that we loved first and learned to trust him and so love now because we love them it motivates and encourages our faith and you cannot have true trust and confidence Without Love so we have love and what does it produce it produces Trust which this is one thing as I've studied this this is maybe just a little bit of an aside as we say here's an example I hope you're paying careful attention to what I'm saying because I'm not trying to get in trouble but we say Zoe and we say that's god's own life but Zoe in the scripture is used of just a human's life not God's life so there's word Agape I always say well that's that's the love of God but you know the same word is used of love for things that aren't Godly or of God so we take these phrases and these words like oh no no this is all it can mean this is all it can mean this is all it could mean and then when it comes to Faith or like faith belief and we try to understand what faith is Faith is confidence the word faith or trust it's just trust or confidence in something and so and I say I'm not trying to narrow the definition it's just realizing wow there's a lot to Faith that I could never just distill down to a few sound bites but if you love it produces confidence and you have to have confidence it shows in love expressed and I couldn't think of the right word for it it wasn't kinetic energy I thought maybe it was Dynamo but it was it was it's a power where the other force is feeding off the other Force and kind of like the kinetic motion to where it's its own its own Mass is giving it energy and they're feeding off of one another perpetually and will never stop because the one you love and it gives you trust and Trust expresses love and then love trust and it just creates this powerful Dynamo these omnipotents tumbling together producing Divine energy and that's how faith and love are working together and that would be my uh expressing to you where God began to deal with me how that you can't deal with perfecting love without talking about perfecting faith and as we address perfect love last time I believe it establishes a parallel and we looked at perfect love I believe it establishes a parallel for looking at perfect Faith so I would say don't take this truth or misuse the truth to create some sort of false litmus test of whether or not you have perfect Faith but let's understand what perfect faith is brother Brown in the sermon perfect faith says perfect faith is pure just as pure as love is it's already said they they work together they are relation you can't have faith unless you've got love so they each require the other he says perfect faith is pure just as pure as love is remember when we looked at the love of God you could use the phrase the love of God to refer to three different things the love which God is which is an essential characteristic of God the love that God shows or the love that we have for God so he says well the love of God is pure and that could refer to the love that you have for God and it would be pure you say the love of God is pure and that's the love that he has shown you which it is pure or the love which God is is pure and so you could use the same phrase to describe different have different emphasis or different meanings the same is said of Faith you could speak of the faith which would be that which God has revealed through his word and the scripture speaks of the faith and it's so it's not necessarily attributed to any person but it stands at its own is that which God has revealed through his word is the faith or it could be the faith of God and it's actually referring to God's faith and then we also know that we have our own faith or if we could say our faith in God so you have the faith of God the faith of God or you could have the faith of God that we have in God and we know that when it comes to love God's love is perfect our love is perfecting so here's my thesis on faith God's faith perfect our faith being perfected in Galatians chapter 2 verse 20. we'll just walk through several scriptures here to bring out these different levels of Faith you have the faith of God which is his faith you have the faith of God which is that which he reveals and the faith of God which was the faith we would have in God or our faith in God in Galatians chapter 2 verse 20 Paul says I am crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ liveth in me and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me remember this as we go forward it says in referencing the faith of the Son of God he says who loved me I remember this and he does not just end there with the period it's not just he loved me but he gave himself for me so he loved him and that would be a condition a state of feeling that now it is expressed through positive action in that he gave himself for me so he does not say well I live by the faith the Son of God who loved me and says well he loves you yeah I've been told that he loves me so I'm living by the faith of the Son of God in whom I've been told that he loves me says but he manifestly declared that love in that he gave his life for me and now he refers to the faith of the Son of God and he says I actually live by the faith of the Son of God so this faith is a living faith if I could look at it from this perspective and I apologize if I'm not very Dynamic today I I was just hoping my suit would be enough so all of you who just weren't impressed by it I'll try to preach a little bit more dynamically to keep you from looking at me like something's wrong but the faith of the son maybe it's my suit so I forgive you but the faith of the Son of God it is a living faith and it is if I can look at it from this perspective it is that is the faith which is revealed by Jesus Christ so it says I live by the faith of the Son of God I'm not living by any other faith I'm not living by religion I'm not living by Judaism I'm not living by the the statement of facts that we've compiled of the prophets but I'm living by the faith of the Son of God brother Branham says in earliest earnestly contending for the faith that was once delivered to the Saints is that more words than the other one but he says then the first one to introduce the faith for the Christian church was none other than Jesus himself this isn't a very important principle for us as message Believers to understand that Christ was the one that introduced the Christian faith to the Christian church and so if we see the pattern of John the Baptist and the pattern of Elijah it has to be Christ that introduces the faith to the Christian Church it says he was the introduction of the faith that was to be handed to the Christian church so this is the faith that is revealed by God this is the faith that is given to the elect there is a faith that we could say is that which stands on its own there's a faith that is revealed there's a faith that is given that is the gift of God and Paul is saying I live by the faith of the Son of God this is that Divine gift that God has given me that is not just human trust that is not just human Ascent that is not just intellectual but I'm living by a living faith that is on the inside of my soul and I'm living by the faith of the Son of God the the truth that has been revealed to me by Jesus Christ and then there's a another aspect to this faith in Revelations chapter 2 verse 13 it says I Know Thy works now God's speaking I Know Thy works and where thou dwellest even where Satan's seat is and I'll hold as fast my name and Hast not denied my faith so now this is Christ speaking and we know that there is a faith of the Son of God which is revealed to the elect and so when he says my faith you have not denied my faith it's not just well I'll say this when it comes to his faith it is not just his faith as something that is revealed but when it and maybe if this scripture isn't just exactly the right one to use I'll use some other scriptures here in a moment but it's speaking of his own his own faith his own his own Trust they have not doubted him that you have not denied my faith that there's no doubting my trust or my confidence because faith is an attitude of trustworthiness when we speak of our faith it's your trust and confidence in God's word now there's a lot of different ways we could describe it but if you just take the Greek and the pistas and you want to look at it in a conjugation you say it just speaks of one's trust and confidence in something and so our faith is our own personal trust commitment to a belief in and confidence in God's word so when he says my faith it speaks of his own confidence it speaks of his own faith it's something that is now a Faith of Christ not just in something he reveals but even a trust in the confidence that God has in Romans chapter 3 verse 3 it says for what if some did not believe shall their unbelief and this is the negative of Faith the very word that's used is anti-faith or antithetical to trust or confidence what if they did not believe or shall their unbelief it's the uh apostola or something that speaking of it this is negative of Faith so shall it make their faith shall make thee Faith their unbelief their lack of faith make the faith of God without effect now some of you you might have already had this thought it does seem odd to attribute the characteristic of Faith to God and say well God has faith but there is a concept of God's faith and he said Can there unbelief cause God to disbelieve what he's promised can their lack of faith and confidence disinull God's faithfulness so it and it's like if you you say I promise I promise I'll do this for you I I I promise I promise I'll do it I'm gonna do it I promise I promise and the person says I don't think you will right nah I don't think you can do it I don't think you can afford it and that might do what to us oh really oh it discourages us takes away our confidence we no longer trust in our promise we we begin to doubt our ability and as the fact that people don't believe God will keep his word does it annul God's confidence in his own word he's like man there's billions and billions of people that think I'm a fraud there's billions and billions of people that don't even believe in me there's people who've rejected me they don't love me is God fretting no is God doubting the faith of the Son of God my faith as he says in Revelations 2 13 and now the faith of God actually speak of God's own faith brother makes this statement he says in several places but this to me was just a real beautiful way how he phrases a little bit broader than just uh one little phrase he says all things that you see were made by faith in the spoken word of God now who was listening and who was believing was it the Angels was everybody waiting and then brother and then God said let there be and the angel said I believe that I'm expecting that and it was their faith that did it he says no he says God said let there be and he believed his own word so God had confidence in what he spoke God had confidence in what he said God had trust God had faith now if I could just just vary just a little bit and hope to revisit this and maybe we'll just say it now and we'll keep repeating it God's faith speaks to where if we have trust and faith in him and we love him and therefore we trust him he loves you so when God has Faith he trusts you he's got I know it sounds crazy right and we can all talk about it at lunch and be like I don't know what he's thinking but he loves you and therefore there's an attitude of trust there's an attitude of confidence and we can keep saying well but this about this but this is no no I love you you got this yes and any and he believes in you and he has trust in you he has faith in you and so when God spoke it's the same characteristic of trustworthiness there's this attitude he said let there be and he believed his own word he trusted it would happen and so God is the the faith of God is the belief that God has or the trust or confidence that God has and here it says God he said let there be and he believed his own word and now if I could say this to add this kind of this other parallel that when the faith of God speaks of the faithfulness of God to his word so the faith we can say are his revealed promises but then his faithfulness is his commitment to what he has revealed because it says wow you know some don't believe and can their disbelief annul or negate God's faithfulness to what he's prophesied if we got enough people to sign what it's not GoFundMe but was it changed or what's the place that we go sign petitions brother Travis you're always on there signing petitions right no he doesn't know what I'm talking about but there's some place where everyone goes and signs up and they want to change the name you know they want to and everyone signs up God there's not a GoFundMe or a go petition me or whatever to to change God's mind and God's not up there just kind of running the metrics and going man I need a brother who's really good at data analytics and where are the thoughts of the people these days I said yeah you know what God a lot of people don't care if there is a Rapture things are getting so good on Earth and he'll be like all right fine no rapture no he's dedicated to it it's committed to it and so herein reveals another Peril as it may be revealed but this is where and when I say parallel we looked at a pattern of understanding perfect love and we're kind of taking the same template now looking at perfect faith and so when it came to perfect love we kind of looked at these different uses of noun and verb to understand what love is being used in the scripture to know the love that you must have but then the love that must be shown and so there's related Concepts when it comes to Faith you can have faith but then there's faithfulness which is this essentially the same word but it's conveying something different with perfect love you have Agape which is the noun it'd be something that you have then you'd have the agapa all which would be the verb the agapa O which is this it's something that you would use to oh I love that and it's and he was loving this and there was something that speaks of one is a feeling or possession or I have love for something and the other is a showing or an acting on that so one is felt the other scene like I feel the love that I have for you but then if I love you you feel it too and so when it comes to Faith and faithfulness faith is that which is our possession faith is that what we hold faith is something the condition of the Soul faith is a condition of believing but then faithfulness is the expression of that faith it says in Revelations 2 19 now God is speaking later to the next Church age I Know Thy works and charity and service and faith and so we could take this to say I Know Thy works and I Know Thy charity and I Know Thy service and I know thy faith and I Know Thy patience and I Know Thy works so when he says I know thy faith he's speaking about their faith the prior Church age they had not denied his faith and now he's not addressing his faith and their trust and confidence in his faith of the denial of his trust and confidence but now he's actually saying I know your faith so there's the faith of God which is that which he has revealed through his word there is the faith of God which is his own belief and conviction and there is your faith brother Branham in chapter six of the church age book says now he does not say here as he did to the church in pergamus you hold my faith and somebody's saying where did brother Aaron come up with this I just got it from the message isn't that an amazing concept that's why I encourage you to be reading the books listening to the tapes scrolling through the ebooks of this message whatever format you have feed on it and you'll be getting there before I get there because that's where I get my inspiration now he does not say here as he did to the church in Perkins you hold my faith he's not talking about his faith now but he's commending them for their faithfulness now could we look at it this way that we know God knew their faith but he's not commending them for Faith unseen but it's an outward expression of their faith that brother Brandon now refers to as a commending them for their faithfulness they have faith and they're faithful James chapter 2 verse 20 to see us thou how Faith wrought with his works now speaking about Abraham Abraham believed God and it was imputed to him for righteousness Paul in teaching on this says Abraham was justified by faith it was that which God knew he possessed within his soul that which Abraham possessed by conviction by trust and confidence but it wasn't that he had trust and confidence absent from any evidence one of the things I I I this uh faith cannot exist apart from knowledge right that Abraham and I say that that there's something known that causes us to love God that gives us this faith and it cannot exist apart from knowledge and then knowledge cannot exist separate from action love cannot accept exist separate separate from function faith cannot exist separate from actions so Abraham believed God and he was justified by his faith but true knowledge must impose itself or have an influence on the knower so the very proof in one sense that Abraham believed God is in what he did and there's if I could back up about faith cannot exist without knowledge but there is no amount of knowledge that it can ever make Faith unnecessary and now you have something to think about for lunch some of you just waiting to get there and you've already called ubereats or you don't call them you text them I think so now Abraham worked his faith wrought his manifested and brought it out and his faith reached its full and supreme expression when he offered Abraham excuse me he offered his son upon the altar says then how Faith wrought with his works and by works by his working Faith was made perfect it's another phrase that you have love made perfect now you have faith being made perfect and so if we back up again God sees our faith peers into our soul sees our faith which is a noun he sees that he knows it's there he knows that we trust him he knows that we love him but then faithfulness is demonstrated by our works and God can see our faith and justify us by faith but then if the outward working out of that faith that men see and we and James is looking at that whereby we're justified by works so his faith produced The Works and these Works expressed perfect faith his faith reaches full and supreme expression when you offer it up Isaac upon the altar so if we say there his faith was made perfect by works was Faith made perfect there's just different ways you could look at this his faith God's faith and confidence in Abraham accomplished its purpose he trusted Abraham he called Abraham he dealt with Abraham he met with Abraham he coached him about the promises he he told them what to do and his his faith paid off his faith accomplished its purpose but then also we could say that Abraham's Trust accomplished its purpose that his faith made was made perfect it accomplished something it did what it was supposed to do and so when he says that Faith was made perfect we could say that his faith is accomplishing what it set out to do and our faith is being perfected brother Branham says the sermon perfect Faith he says when you got Pure unadultered Faith Like Your Love Is to your companion then you prove it by the way you act if you have faith your actions will prove it and it's in the acting that faith is being made perfect faith is accomplishing something so we we then desire that the faith that we have would be perfect by doing what it's supposed to do not looking at the absence of things done and concluding that we don't have it we look at the fact that we have it and fill the void where it's not expressing it now some may look at that and say wow you're really you're treading on Dangerous Ground because what you really need to do is convict the people that they don't have it and that may be true for some but how awful would it be today if you had perfect faith and perfect love and I was able to manipulate the word of God clever enough to where you left thinking you didn't have it and which would be worse which would be worse to beat you up so bad till you leave doubting you have perfect love or at least provoking confidence in that which you believe you have because then once you could come to the place of Desiring to see the fruits of it in the absence you can always ask yourself Lord have I done something to where I've missed it and just get it right right that's the beauty of being bride you're never afraid to be found out you're wrong because that just means you're it's an opportunity to be right finally and if you've got Pure unadulterated Faith you prove it by the way you act and then he equivocates it to love like love to your companion if you love your companion you show it and so faith is believing faithfulness is expressing that belief and I I'll say this here and I I'll come back to it we God we learn of God's faith through his faithfulness right so God is unseen cannot see him no man hasn't seen God at any time he's unknown he's invisible and he is a God of all Faith the God of all love and that's an absolute truth and nothing we ever say or do can ever change that but then we would never know his faith if he wasn't faithful we would never know his love if he wasn't loving so just like God demonstrated his love by loving us and demonstrating his love by action we know God's faith and we know the faith of God through his faithfulness now there's a statement brother man makes in perfect Faith No we're just gonna use this use this phrase to transition towards our clothes here and maybe just get a little bit of momentum to swing Us swing us to a close he says we are to have perfect faith in this perfect word so as we recognize without perfect love we cannot be there and we realized the challenge in the mark of this age is perfection and we are to have perfect faith in his perfect word and that's a challenge to us and I would say if you're not challenged by it maybe you're just being dismissive of it because that is a challenge we're to have perfect faith in this perfect word not just faith in his word but a perfect faith in his perfect word now if God is requiring that which I believe he is because we're to have perfect faith in his perfect word I believe that God has a provided way to bring us to this place of perfect faith it's not something that we we leave church and we scramble and we go home and we start shifting through our house trying to find perfect Faith where did I put it where did I put I know I had it somewhere but God says you've got to have perfect faith and you say then you've got to give it to me if God ever requires something of you he's not shocked if he said by your grace if you'll help me get there right it says yielding to him if he says you've got to have it then you just say well then would you give it to me please and so we have to have perfect faith in this perfect word so then God has a way to bring you to perfect faith it says in Hebrews 12 2 looking unto Jesus the author the beginner the originator the Creator and the Perfecter The Finisher the completer of our faith not his faith not the faith but our faith and I would say no matter how you look at it there's a perfecting of our faith that is transpiring whether our faith is the faith or our faith is his faith or our faith is that Faith which we have in him it is being begun and it is being perfected and in John Chapter 14 verse 29 it says now I have told you before it come to pass I told you these things would happen before they happened that for the reason that when it is to come to pass you might believe so God prophesies his word beforehand fulfills it so that when he has demonstrated his word or he has demonstrated faithfulness it increases our faith this is a pattern I could prove scripture after scripture after scripture I told you beforehand so that when it happens it'll cause you to believe more I've spoken to you my word so that when I fulfill it it increases your faith he is the author and the finisher of our faith we know him and because we know him we love him and because we love him we trust him and this is what causes this love to begin with he says now that you love me I and now that you have faith in me I'm going to perfect that faith now that you love me I'm gonna perfect that love and the way that God does it is he does it through his word he does it through his faithfulness he does it by demonstrating his love towards us he does it by demonstrating his promised word to us in the sermon perfect Faith he says I know he wants to do something speaking of God I know he wants to do something he has been doing something to create this Perfection of faith in the people it's God that does it it's God that's creating the Perfection of your faith so maybe the most critical element of perfect love the most critical element of perfect faith is yielding to what God's doing he's got the blueprints he's got the engineering degree he's got the permit he's got all the materials and if you could just sit still long enough he's like listen I'll get you there if you'll just trust me I'll get you there if you just settle down long enough and quit running around and trying to do this and trying to do that I can do this because I am doing something to create this Perfection of faith in you and then brother Brandon comes to it about a paragraph later the word operate in the human flesh by physical science by Material Science by scriptural science perfectly to bring you a perfect faith for perfect rapture God has invested himself in the process of taking you from a faith to a perfect faith this is God's desire this is God's design this is something that is his faith that he believes your love for him he believes your faith for him and he's engaged to this process of taking Faith to a perfect faith and he wants to do something to create the Perfection of faith in you and the word is operating in you the word is operating in other people the word is operate in the message of the hour the word is fulfilling Prophecy in the day and age we're living in in order that it might be made known to you by Revelation in order to swell up a perfect faith for a perfect rapture I'll try to go quickly through these remaining scriptures first Thessalonians chapter 3 verses 9 to 13 I believe that we could just read it and it'll express to you what he the uh the the principle of a perfecting Faith he says for what thanks can we render to God again for you for all the joy we're with we enjoy for your sakes before our God night and day praying exceedingly that we might see your face and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith this is this is the sincere desire of an apostle this is him saying through the ministering of the word of God through the gifts that have been placed in us I would like to come and Minister the word of God to perfect that which is lacking in your faith now God himself and our father and our Lord Jesus Christ direct our way unto you and the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one to one another and toward all men even as we do toward you to the end he may establish your hearts unblameable in Holiness before God even our father at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his Saints we know that it is only it is only God's power that produces faith but it is also God's power to increase it amen they have faith and he's saying that God I like to come and Minister the word of God to you more perfectly that it might perfect that which is lacking in their faith they had received Christ they had faith yet the word of God needed to be taught that their faith could be perfected wherever it was lacking the preach of the word we know in Ephesians is for the perfecting of the Saints and and for the knowledge of Christ that we all could come into the unity of the faith and so Paul is saying I'd like to come to you in order to perfect that which is lacking in your faith the takeaway for me when I was reading this yesterday is he didn't say I'd like to come and expose all your weaknesses I'd like to come and prove to you that you guys aren't the Believers you thought they were you were preaching is never meant to take away from your faith it's always meant to perfect that which is lacking in your faith remember when we looked at the subject of who is my neighbor and how that we could all be Thieves by stealing from people and we could take things away from him and we could Rob them and leave them half naked and half Alive by the things that we robbed them of and if there's if you ever take away something from somebody be sure that you follow it up with something that's more necessary that they ought to have in its place and so the preach of the word is meant to perfect that which is lacking in our faith to renders he says that it might perfect that which is lacking to render your faith complete to fill up anything that's missing in your faith Paul is openly acknowledging that they believe and that belief is by the power of God but the same power of God desires to fill up your faith to make your faith effective and to render complete the faith that you have in him is in Mark chapter 9 verse 24 is the straight way the Father the child cried out and said with tears he said if you'll just believe your daughter will be made well he says Lord I believe I have faith help thou my unbelief what a declaration and I'm so glad that it's not met with rebuke I'm so glad that it's not like you believe help you're unbelief that's a paradox it cannot exist it cannot be true but rather it discloses how we feel sometimes we do believe we do have faith but yet maybe there's just something that's not effective something that's not working something that's not whole something that's not complete it says Lord please heal the defect that's in my faith Lord I do believe but right now I'm a little bit fearful Lord I do believe maybe I'm a little bit doubting but make that part of my faith which seems to be right now just a little bit restrained Lord Make It whole and help my unbelief he writes in second Corinthians chapter 10 verse 15 not boasting of things without our measure that is of other men's labors but having hope when your faith is increased that we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule abundantly Paul acknowledging once again that faith can be increased so when we think of perfect faith if our faith isn't perfect it's coming to it by perfect love amen that's the perfecting faith God's perfect love and God's perfect Faith are working in us to bring us to perfection God's perfect love and God's perfect Faith that's perfect that's the the perfect love the perfect faith and which we have we could say which we have in our souls by the baptism of the Holy Ghost but then there's our faith in our love and it's his love and his faith that's perfecting faith if my faith isn't where it needs to be God will get it there as you yield to him as you feed on his word as you believe for it as you trust him musicians feel free to come here I want to read this statement from perfect Faith he says brother Brown's talking about the end of servant I did this for a reason and I know this is a very pronounced statement to us not a faith but a perfect faith built up in here and this is notice what this faith is to watch a perfect god with the perfect heart keep a perfect Promise by his perfect word whose Perfection are you trusting in what's going to bring it to pass it's a perfect god with the perfect heart and a perfect Promise by his perfect word if there's any perfect Faith to be had it's his Perfection that is doing it what does he want to orient our eyes to he said oh God God's going to bring forth perfect faith and so you do is you just kind of look and say well do I have perfect Faith do I have perfect Faith No keep your eyes on the promise the perfect word which is sharper than a two-edged sword and a discern of the thoughts of the heart we're coming now to the Perfection we are now God's already perfect his heart is perfect his promise is perfect his love is perfect his word is perfect his faith is perfect but we're coming to the Perfection because the people have to come to this in order for the rapture so if I've got to come to it he's got to get me there so God's perfect love and God's perfect faith is going to bring me to a place of perfection he says that's what's holding it away right now waiting for that church to come into perfect raptured Faith he says looking for it if I could put it my own words I'm expecting it it's gonna happen why because this perfect level never fail God's faith is perfect and all unbelief and even our own failures and mistakes and our doubtings have never disenold God's confidence in his election in you he says it means a lot of Shaving down I think in some other translations it's a lot of shaking down for me because it means a lot for you but together we will make it by the grace of God but together together we will make it by the grace of God I believe if I could say this from the bottom of my heart this is why love is so important that it can be channeled and expressed the right way because I want the love of God shed abroad in my heart if I said that's been poured out into my spirit Lord let it be expressed to me through me that it might give others that I'm with together the confidence that will make it together we'll make it in other words I bind myself to say I'm not going to do this alone together we'll make it by the grace of God if I try to do it by myself I'll never make it if you try to do it without me you'll never make it we've got to do this together and I believe his word cries out to us that he's building up a perfect faith how am I going to get there let his perfect heart do it that is perfect word do it let his perfect promise do it if I have a faith that I believe is ineffective if I have a faith that's not being made whole I say I do have a faith but that's not just a faith it's a perfecting faith in other words it's this present state of coming into perfection brother Bradman statue of a perfect man he talks about that headstone which is love he says God is love and he's the one that controls and he says he's the strength of every one of these other virtues he which is God who is love is the strength I've been thinking about how his strength is perfect when my strength is not his love is a strength to you and it'll uphold you in your week it'll uphold you when your faith isn't strong it's there to remind you that that if I could put it in a way that it certainly seems like a paradox because our sins and iniquities he remembers no more against us but he knows your capacity to make mistakes he knows your limits he knows your weaknesses but his love there's a commitment to his love he loves you therefore he trusts you he's got confidence if I can say maybe it wasn't brother Brad I'm saying together we'll make it maybe it was God wanting to tell you that together we'll make it that I'm in this with you and in you to the end and his it's his strength this beautiful scripture in Philippians 2 13 for it is God that works in you Faith which worketh by love his faith working by his love in my soul it is him working in me both to Will and to do of his good pleasure the will is the love the will is the faith there's the noun the desire but to do is the agape the action the expression and the faithfulness it's him in you both to Will and to do of his good pleasure perfect love obtainable sayings by the baptism of the Holy Ghost it becomes your possession and then we know and believe maybe we'll pick up on this in our future service we know that he will perfect that which concerneth me that if there's anything lacking in my faith the word will perfect it that is as my faith can grow he will increase it it's perfecting faith it's not a faith that well if you have faith it's a perfect faith if you don't have perfect Faith you need to go get Faith if you've got faith it's a perfecting Faith let's trust him for all trust him with everything that we have in us that this love that we have for him is a perfecting love that there's faith that we have in him is a perfecting Faith let's stand
