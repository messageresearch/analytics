[0:01] we want to welcome you back to another
[0:03] segment of kids eat free
[0:06] and if you're still trying to figure
[0:07] this one out let me just say that you
[0:09] know
[0:10] if you heard that at a restaurant your
[0:12] kids could eat free you might have an
[0:13] incentive to bring them right so
[0:17] kids eat free is this segment that we've
[0:19] been doing we've started a series
[0:20] underneath this
[0:22] uh on the seven bad habits of highly
[0:24] ineffective parents this is part three
[0:26] on that
[0:27] and tonight the subtitle is emphasis by
[0:31] example so i'm gonna be kind of bringing
[0:33] a couple things together and i forgot to
[0:35] say this but sister trinity it's so nice
[0:37] to see you tonight
[0:39] god bless you welcome back she's been
[0:41] traveling visiting family and it's so
[0:43] good to see her tonight i apologize i
[0:45] feel like i should reset i forgot to say
[0:47] hi to her it's so nice to see you
[0:49] but the so the subtitles emphasis by
[0:51] example we're kind of marrying a couple
[0:53] of those principles that we went over
[0:54] last time so if we look at these i'll
[0:57] just review for a few moments the seven
[0:59] bad habits of highly ineffective parents
[1:02] um if you're thinking well i'm not a
[1:03] parent now i'm a grandparent i'm not
[1:05] married this is applicable for any time
[1:06] of life and for any relationship we
[1:09] could we could say this is you know
[1:10] seven bad habits of a highly ineffective
[1:12] christian if that would get your
[1:13] attention feel free to write it down
[1:15] that way but the number one in this
[1:18] order and again i'll even say this i
[1:20] structured it this way because i saw a
[1:22] correlation to
[1:23] the uh seven of the characteristics of
[1:25] the stature of a perfect man and so i
[1:27] saw each one of these so i kind of
[1:29] ordered them to match with those and we
[1:31] went over that in part one
[1:33] and so it's over emphasizing carnal
[1:35] things inconsistently instructing and
[1:38] correcting
[1:39] improperly judging inappropriately using
[1:42] voice wrongly disciplining not being an
[1:45] example and withholding grace and i
[1:47] would say all of these are related some
[1:49] of you may be able to look at this and
[1:51] think that under the principle of keep
[1:52] it simple stupid you would kind of
[1:54] consolidate them and maybe only come up
[1:56] with a few uh there is overlap and
[1:59] correlations among them
[2:00] and even as you look at them i want to
[2:02] maybe just do this by looking at it that
[2:04] there's some groupings that you could
[2:06] make with these
[2:07] and with emphasis over emphasizing
[2:10] carnal things and even
[2:12] number six uh being an example or not
[2:15] being an example those would be two
[2:18] different habits that relate to how we
[2:20] live before our children i want you to
[2:23] recognize that that in number one over
[2:25] emphasizing carnal things isn't
[2:27] something you do to them but it's
[2:29] something rather you do before them in
[2:31] front of them that they're watching so
[2:33] you can kind of group some of these
[2:34] based upon
[2:35] how you live before your children and
[2:37] then the others on instructing and
[2:39] correcting and judging and how you use
[2:41] your voice and disciplining and even the
[2:43] grace that you show that relates to our
[2:46] treatment of them
[2:47] so there's ways that you can look
[2:49] there's things that we do that may never
[2:50] be to them but it's in front of them and
[2:53] there's things that we do that are
[2:54] definitely to them that we need to be
[2:56] conscious of and so that's what i want
[2:58] to do tonight is going to combine some
[3:00] things
[3:01] but again just for review i want to kind
[3:03] of honestly maybe close the loop but
[3:04] just revisit a couple things from last
[3:06] time on overemphasizing
[3:08] carnal things or one way that we put it
[3:10] was to emphasize spiritual things
[3:13] we looked in the word of god and saw
[3:15] where spiritual things bring depth it's
[3:17] what makes a real solid relationship
[3:19] it's the real good footing and security
[3:20] of a relationship it brings stability
[3:23] and so where you if you want happiness
[3:25] if you want rest if you want quietness
[3:27] if you want that peace within your in
[3:29] your family among your family members or
[3:32] in a relationship uh spiritual things
[3:34] are going to give you that bedrock so it
[3:36] really brings depth but the carnal
[3:38] things
[3:39] uh they feed shallowness if it's carnal
[3:41] it's very very shallow it's gonna it's
[3:42] gonna run out it's it's not gonna last
[3:44] and if you're feeding on carnal things
[3:47] it's going to promote fear within your
[3:48] relationships
[3:49] and it's going to breed a frustration
[3:51] and so it's carnal things to me this is
[3:53] just an absolute if carnal things have
[3:56] the preeminence there's going to be
[3:57] anger within your relationships if
[3:59] carnal things have preeminence there's
[4:00] going to be frustration and aggravation
[4:02] and discouragement and so god's law we
[4:05] looked at it in galatians chapter 6 that
[4:07] god's law of the harvest dictates this
[4:09] is an absolute law that if you sow to
[4:11] the carnal you're going to reap
[4:14] carnal
[4:15] right if you sow to it you're going to
[4:16] get from it so if you if you want to sow
[4:18] to the lust of the flesh if you want to
[4:20] sow to the desires of the flesh if you
[4:21] want to sow to entertainment enthusiasm
[4:24] around certain things then you're going
[4:25] to get it back in kind and so maybe that
[4:28] helps us sometimes well where did they
[4:30] get that from well maybe from the siege
[4:32] you so
[4:33] there's a lot of ways that we need to
[4:35] recognize that even god in the beginning
[4:38] made
[4:39] those that the man would have power over
[4:42] made them and i want you to think maybe
[4:43] very deeply about this made them to
[4:45] receive seed and produce whatever you
[4:47] sow into them
[4:49] that's the way that that's the way that
[4:50] it was made in the creation so whatever
[4:52] we put into them we're going to get out
[4:54] of them and so the bible this is to me
[4:56] kind of maybe closing the loop on the
[4:58] last time or at least catching some of
[4:59] these principles up the bible places the
[5:01] duty of training a child train up a
[5:04] child in a way that he should go places
[5:06] that duty
[5:07] to train them from the right things upon
[5:09] the parents
[5:10] he says well we send them to sunday
[5:12] school then they go into school they're
[5:14] only in sunday school for an hour if
[5:16] even that and then they go into school
[5:18] during the week monday through friday
[5:19] they're in the classrooms they're
[5:20] amongst their peers in the world and
[5:22] then they get no training at home at all
[5:24] is kind of what he said he talked about
[5:26] establishing a family altar again
[5:28] because that duty is on us the duty is
[5:30] on us as parents to emphasize the
[5:32] spiritual things because no offense but
[5:34] brother tucker carlson isn't doing it
[5:37] right
[5:38] all right neither is brother uh anderson
[5:40] cooper just to be inclusive they're not
[5:42] emphasizing
[5:44] they're not emphasizing spiritual things
[5:46] and so you're not gonna get the those
[5:48] spiritual things that you need it's
[5:50] gonna come from the parents and i was
[5:52] gonna mention it tonight i've kind of
[5:54] just rearranged some things but we spend
[5:56] less than three percent maybe even less
[5:58] than two percent of our time in church
[5:59] listening to preaching
[6:01] so where else are you gonna get it
[6:03] where else you're gonna get that that
[6:05] right kind of emphasis
[6:06] so now i want to look at not being an
[6:09] example
[6:10] and in using this phrase of not being an
[6:12] example what was kind of another way of
[6:14] saying is just a bad habit would be
[6:16] being a bad example
[6:17] and a couple wednesday nights ago we
[6:19] used the contrast of fate of godliness
[6:22] rather as being the um
[6:25] the contrast to
[6:26] uh
[6:28] being a bad example or not being an
[6:30] example brother i said godliness is to
[6:32] be like god
[6:33] and so reading from a stretch of a
[6:35] perfect man he says but you know what
[6:36] godliness meant you've sang the song to
[6:37] be like jesus to be like jesus
[6:40] on earth i long to be like him all
[6:42] through life's journey
[6:43] from earth to glory i only asked to be
[6:45] like him now this is you kind of have to
[6:47] think
[6:49] um you have to kind of meditate on it to
[6:51] catch the one of this these another
[6:53] layer to the principle anytime you look
[6:55] at the word of god you should look at it
[6:57] as if it's 3d
[6:59] and look at it to where it pops out at
[7:01] you because there's dimension to it
[7:02] there's there's ways of viewing it and
[7:04] so we think oh well to be like jesus
[7:06] that's to be godly but what did it mean
[7:08] to be like jesus in another sense he
[7:10] says that's godliness when he was
[7:12] smitten on the cheek when he was smite
[7:13] on the one side of the face he turned
[7:15] the other when he was spoken rough to he
[7:17] didn't speak he didn't rile back so one
[7:19] thing we could say is he didn't let the
[7:20] actions of others dictate his actions
[7:24] as he didn't respond in kind so that's
[7:26] one way
[7:27] that we realize that we can be godly and
[7:29] that's one way that we can be an example
[7:30] to our kids and since this is pretty
[7:32] much turned into a cathartic confession
[7:36] hour for brother aaron
[7:38] one of the things i don't like when i do
[7:39] it is whenever my kids act immature and
[7:41] i just do it too to make a point but i
[7:44] think i'm just reinforcing what they're
[7:46] doing they're like well he's 47 years
[7:48] old and he's doing it
[7:49] like finally dad gets it he's acting he
[7:52] he's acting just like me and so
[7:53] sometimes we if they go nanny boo boo we
[7:56] want to go nina back and what we're
[7:58] doing is we're kind of mirroring their
[8:00] behavior and we may accidentally be
[8:02] reinforcing it when we're trying to get
[8:04] them to recognize how wrong it is but we
[8:07] haven't accomplished that at all
[8:09] so one way that we could
[8:11] uh take from being godly is to not let
[8:13] the actions of others especially our
[8:14] children dictate to us our response
[8:19] in terms of meeting their immaturity
[8:21] being riled against riling back speaking
[8:23] loudly speaking loudly back in that
[8:25] sense but he says godly always looking
[8:27] for one thing so here's the secret
[8:29] i always do that which pleases the
[8:31] father
[8:32] he says yes sir always that's godliness
[8:35] now how could we expand upon that
[8:37] scripturally god this was he said i only
[8:39] do that which the f with the father has
[8:40] said i like what i say what i see the
[8:43] father do i do likewise so godliness is
[8:46] following the right example amen
[8:48] therefore if godliness was achieved by
[8:50] fall in the right example by doing what
[8:52] pleases the father jesus did what the
[8:54] father demonstrated god then was the
[8:57] example of godliness
[9:00] and christ therefore himself kind of
[9:03] followed that example and so that's
[9:04] where i it really inspired me to look at
[9:07] godliness in the way of i want to be
[9:09] following the right example and if i do
[9:12] that then i can be setting the right
[9:14] example myself
[9:16] that's uh that's the should be the
[9:17] aspiration of every parent especially as
[9:19] fathers is that we are have the headship
[9:22] of christ and having hit that headship
[9:24] we can reflect the right things in our
[9:25] family so i want to join these two
[9:27] things together the carnal things
[9:29] and the bad example uh being bad
[9:32] examples and this is where we come up
[9:34] with emphasis by example bad habit is to
[9:37] emphasize carnal things and another bad
[9:39] habit is to
[9:41] not be an example so the carnal things
[9:43] and bad examples i'm coming up with the
[9:45] subtitle of emphasis by example
[9:49] now this is i'm going to say this at the
[9:50] outset and then hopefully this could
[9:52] just kind of open up your minds and you
[9:54] said you could say brother we know where
[9:55] we're going we know we're going let's
[9:56] just get out of here before in and out
[9:57] closes
[9:58] and because i think this should make the
[10:00] point right here our emphasis will
[10:03] dictate their attention
[10:06] what we emphasize is going to determine
[10:09] what their emphasis is we could do a
[10:11] little experiment right now we won't do
[10:12] it because chances are when you do it
[10:14] cold and you don't test for it it
[10:16] doesn't turn out right but i'm pretty
[10:17] sure
[10:18] that if we had a toddler here and i put
[10:21] the bible on a chair
[10:23] and then i put a cell phone on a chair
[10:26] which one do you think they're going to
[10:27] grab
[10:29] this is a thought experiment they're
[10:31] probably going to grab the cell phone
[10:33] and you might say oh because it's shiny
[10:36] and it's new no it's because it's what
[10:38] they see in your hand the most
[10:40] right
[10:41] it's true there's a lot of things that
[10:43] we that we are doing before our children
[10:45] and doing so
[10:47] it it sets a precedent for their
[10:49] behavior
[10:50] and so our emphasis is going to even
[10:53] determine their attraction
[10:55] what you look at what you watch what you
[10:57] listen to what you admire what you
[10:59] promote what you talk about is getting
[11:01] their attention and and this is not in
[11:04] any way trying to establish some sort of
[11:06] precedent but obviously if this was
[11:08] never laying around they wouldn't grab
[11:09] for it so now you know this is what i
[11:11] look at when i'm up here is my the time
[11:13] uh wouldn't have been awful if that
[11:14] switched to something else and like my
[11:16] brother aaron's following the basketball
[11:18] score
[11:19] uh
[11:20] that would have been really awful but
[11:22] there shouldn't be any other apps open
[11:24] on this phone right now i did have the
[11:25] song app here so we keep our we have our
[11:28] music here but if that was never even
[11:30] laying around they wouldn't be drawn to
[11:32] it
[11:33] but it's the things that become familiar
[11:34] to them so i would say this as a way of
[11:36] just getting your thoughts
[11:38] in the direction that i'm pondering this
[11:40] on the emphasis and example our behavior
[11:43] signals value to them
[11:46] how we behave what we promote what we
[11:48] lift up is signaling value to our
[11:50] children
[11:51] now in john chapter 10 verse 36 that
[11:53] that's kind of just getting you thinking
[11:55] where i'm going and i may not be able to
[11:56] get to that spot until later but john
[11:58] chapter 10 if we could go there verse 36
[12:01] now i'm now just right into my subject
[12:04] matter this evening
[12:05] and
[12:06] feel very comfortable
[12:09] and so we'll uh
[12:11] we'll start kind of
[12:13] from the beginning
[12:15] and but what i've just said is given the
[12:17] idea of what we're looking at
[12:19] brother jesus says this in john chapter
[12:21] 10 verse 36 say ye of him whom the
[12:23] father hath sanctified
[12:25] and sent into the world now i'm just
[12:27] taking a phrase out of this because he's
[12:28] saying you're going to say of him the
[12:30] one that the father sanctified and send
[12:33] to the world and then
[12:34] he expounds on the criticisms that they
[12:36] had of the one that the father sent but
[12:39] catch the way that jesus describes the
[12:41] father
[12:42] he says
[12:43] or of himself but in doing so kind of
[12:46] highlights an attribute of the father
[12:47] say of christ whom the father hath
[12:50] sanctified and sent into the world what
[12:52] has he just done he's told us something
[12:54] about the characteristics of god
[12:56] saying something about fatherhood that
[12:57] the true reflection of fatherhood is
[13:00] that god sanctified his son before he
[13:03] sent him out
[13:04] and so this is a reflection of true
[13:06] fatherhood because training children is
[13:08] the process of sanctifying them before
[13:10] we send them into the world
[13:12] uh the process of child training isn't
[13:14] trying to figure out a way or trying to
[13:16] get them out of the house as soon as
[13:17] possible nor is it trying to figure out
[13:19] a way to where they never leave
[13:21] right and there's ways that i'm starting
[13:22] to recognize that little eliza is being
[13:24] so helpful around the house and thinking
[13:26] how can we keep her here
[13:28] for all her days but that's not the goal
[13:30] the goal is not just to keep your
[13:32] children at home but the idea of
[13:34] fatherhood is the father has sanctified
[13:38] his son and sent him into the world
[13:40] christ is identifying that you're saying
[13:42] this of christ and he kisses this is
[13:44] what you're saying of christ who was
[13:45] sent into the world but he wants us to
[13:46] understand some nature of the father and
[13:49] this is where i may be kind of getting
[13:51] into the face of the men tonight a
[13:52] little bit addressing you not
[13:54] confronting you but uh of this he says
[13:57] it in a way to say this is what a real
[13:58] father does before he sends his son into
[14:02] the world he sanctifies him first
[14:05] matthew chapter 10 verse 16. he's jesus
[14:07] did that which pleased the father and
[14:09] demonstrated what the father
[14:10] demonstrated he says behold i send you
[14:12] forth as sheep in the midst of wolves
[14:14] thanks
[14:17] he says be there for wise as serpents
[14:19] and harmless as doves so as christ was
[14:22] sent he now sins and because because
[14:25] christ is sending he has an obligation
[14:27] to train he says it in luke go your ways
[14:29] behold i send you forth as lambs among
[14:32] wolves it's quite an extraordinary
[14:33] statement that one who has trained
[14:35] somebody is telling them you're a sheep
[14:37] but i'm sending you in the midst of
[14:38] wolves but then has confidence that he's
[14:41] trained them in such a way to where they
[14:42] can navigate it without getting eaten
[14:45] you realize that that's the real nature
[14:47] then of christ reflecting his father his
[14:49] father sanctified him and sent him into
[14:51] the world now as a master as a teacher
[14:53] just during his short time with him he
[14:55] said i'm going to send you a sheep into
[14:57] the midst of wolves wolves eat sheep
[15:00] in case we didn't know that wolves eat
[15:01] sheep they're gonna tear them limb for
[15:03] limb but he says be harmless as serpents
[15:05] and wise as doves take what i've given
[15:08] you and you'll be able to navigate a
[15:10] world amongst wolves
[15:14] and because
[15:15] he knew what was ahead he prepared his
[15:17] disciples
[15:19] likewise as parents because we know what
[15:21] is ahead we must prepare them we must
[15:23] equip them for what is ahead that's
[15:25] right because we know as parents we've
[15:28] lived it
[15:29] one of the things one of my ideas in the
[15:31] uh under the subject of withholding
[15:33] grace is completely forgetting what it
[15:35] was like to be
[15:36] a child
[15:37] forgetting what it was like to be one of
[15:39] them that there's a uh
[15:41] there should be some empathy because
[15:43] we've been there before
[15:45] maybe we could just signal that to our
[15:46] children one time
[15:48] or let even right now to let them know
[15:50] jack i was seven years old at one time
[15:51] did you know that
[15:53] yeah
[15:55] elliott i was 14 before i i've been
[15:57] there and they're like really
[15:59] because one of the fun things with kids
[16:00] is trying to figure out
[16:01] you know the relationships because they
[16:03] just think that mom and dad were always
[16:04] together and all of a sudden they start
[16:06] realizing wait a minute your mom's
[16:08] different than his my wait how did this
[16:10] all happen right they try to figure that
[16:12] all out but sometimes it's good for us
[16:14] to remember we were that way one time
[16:18] and so we we know what is ahead and
[16:20] because we know what is ahead we must
[16:22] prepare them for what is ahead we must
[16:24] equip our children for what is ahead and
[16:26] if i could say this out of love to our
[16:27] children our young men and the young
[16:29] ladies here a lot of the things that our
[16:31] parents are saying and doing on your
[16:32] behalf isn't because of so much what
[16:34] exists now in your lives but what is
[16:36] ahead for you
[16:38] and we want to be sure that we're
[16:39] emphasizing the right things and
[16:41] promoting the right virtues and actually
[16:43] preparing you for what the world would
[16:45] want to do to you
[16:48] and now in john chapter 17 verses 17 to
[16:51] 19. now watch how jesus comes back to
[16:53] this he says you're saying this of
[16:55] christ whom the father has sanctified
[16:57] and sin to the world so we know that god
[16:59] as the ultimate parent as the extreme
[17:01] parent
[17:02] sanctified christ before he sent him
[17:05] into the world and now watch christ as
[17:06] he said i'm going to send you a sheep in
[17:08] the midst of wolves he says sanctify
[17:10] them through thy truth thy word is truth
[17:14] so he also is praying that they would be
[17:16] sanctified
[17:18] he says as thou has sent me into the
[17:20] world even so have i also sent them into
[17:22] the world
[17:23] now that we could take this very
[17:24] literally that if god sent christ into
[17:26] the world under one way then he's also
[17:29] going to christ must do the same thing
[17:31] when he sends his disciples into the
[17:34] world so what does he say verse 19 and
[17:36] for their sakes i sanctify myself
[17:40] that they also might be sanctified
[17:42] through the truth
[17:44] now this is coming to the real heart of
[17:45] what i want to emphasize tonight
[17:48] is
[17:49] he's he doesn't just tell him hey i'm
[17:51] going to send you into the world and you
[17:53] better live clean
[17:54] i'm going to send you in the world you
[17:55] better not sin in the world you know
[17:56] better not be like the world you better
[17:57] not do this you better not do that but
[17:59] he's saying that i want i must send them
[18:01] into the world and as the father
[18:03] sanctified me
[18:05] they need to be sanctified also and so
[18:07] in order to sanctify them
[18:11] i'll sanctify myself
[18:15] i like it
[18:17] here he's laying out this principle they
[18:19] must be sanctified and so the work of
[18:22] sanctification wasn't so much rolling
[18:24] the sleeves and get over here boy and we
[18:25] beat the devil out of you but it was
[18:27] sanctifying yourself first
[18:30] that's how you really cast out spirits
[18:31] that's how that's how you really deal
[18:33] with certain issues is let's start with
[18:35] ourselves so we can do all this tonight
[18:37] say lord i'm here with a rake not a
[18:39] pitchfork i don't even know if the
[18:41] neighbors in the apartment next door are
[18:43] here tonight it's just you and i'm gonna
[18:44] take this into my heart whether i'm a
[18:46] single parent whether i'm a mother
[18:48] raising my children by myself this is
[18:50] gonna be instructive to me and lord if
[18:51] my children must be sanctified then i
[18:54] must sanctify myself
[18:56] first
[18:57] and for their sakes i sanctify myself
[19:00] that they might be sanctified through
[19:02] the truth
[19:04] i hope to emphasize this for the
[19:05] remaining time that we have together
[19:06] this evening but if that could really
[19:09] drop in your hearts as a revelation
[19:10] behavior changes across the board
[19:12] the things that you may feel that you
[19:14] have liberty to do as a father and the
[19:16] liberty to do as a parent you
[19:17] immediately begin to think whoa
[19:20] what would this mean to my children
[19:23] and so this is an example such a
[19:25] beautiful example of our taken
[19:26] responsibility
[19:28] for the sanctification of those we are
[19:30] leading
[19:31] just as christ was leading his disciples
[19:33] first respect reflected in how god dealt
[19:35] with his son now christ sending his
[19:37] disciples out into the world we one day
[19:38] are going to let our children go we're
[19:40] going to let our sons leave and cleave
[19:42] to their wives we're going to give our
[19:43] daughters away to another man and when
[19:45] we do we want to have sanctified
[19:47] ourselves so that they likewise were
[19:48] sanctified and so this is an example of
[19:51] us taking responsibility for ourselves
[19:54] because we have a responsibility to
[19:55] sanctify those that we are leading in
[19:58] training
[19:59] brother braham says it this way on
[20:00] christmas day in 1960 god's wrapped gift
[20:03] he says i think one of the most pathetic
[20:04] words that jesus ever said was when he
[20:07] said father i sanctify myself that they
[20:09] might be sanctified now it's curious
[20:12] that he says pathetic but kind of enter
[20:14] into what he's trying to say in other
[20:15] words he had a right
[20:17] he was a man he had a right to be to a
[20:19] home he had a right to a family he was a
[20:21] man as much as man as you or i am as
[20:23] much human in his manhood as we are he
[20:25] had a right to it but he was training 12
[20:28] men that were going to take the gospel
[20:30] to all the world so he sanctified
[20:32] himself for their sake i sanctify myself
[20:35] for their sake a gift of god keeping
[20:37] himself sanctified
[20:40] he had a right
[20:42] but he sacrificed those rights for
[20:44] somebody else's sanctification
[20:46] this is the example of christ we have
[20:48] rights but we sacrifice those rights for
[20:50] the sanctification of others remember
[20:52] this that sanctification requires
[20:54] sacrifice
[20:56] isn't that right it was in the it was in
[20:58] the sacrifice that things were
[20:59] sanctified so again even in the type of
[21:02] our lives if i'm going to if i need to
[21:04] sanctify those that i send out if i'm
[21:06] going to have a responsibility for my
[21:08] children that i have to sanctify myself
[21:10] and my sanctification is going to
[21:12] require sacrifice of things that may be
[21:15] my right
[21:17] let me say this even things that you are
[21:19] that is your liberty and right uh as
[21:21] being a born-again christian that this
[21:23] is not uh is it gonna harm me this isn't
[21:26] gonna be wrong for me this is gonna be
[21:27] there's no law the prohibition against
[21:29] it but you recognize that for your own
[21:32] expediency but also for the example that
[21:34] you set before your children i as a holy
[21:36] spirit spirit-filled parent speaking on
[21:38] your behalf may be able to do things
[21:41] that you remain free from but it could
[21:43] expose somebody who doesn't have the
[21:44] holy ghost to influences that they don't
[21:47] know how to deal with and break free
[21:48] from
[21:50] and so it becomes very important that we
[21:52] sacrifice because sanctification
[21:54] requires sacrifice
[21:56] this is our responsibility as parents
[21:58] this is part of our job description is
[22:01] to be sacrificial
[22:02] and again just addressing fathers
[22:04] tonight i'd say this duty primarily or
[22:06] first rest upon fathers
[22:09] we have to be taking the lead not in
[22:11] rolling up our sleeves and beating the
[22:13] devil out of our children but likewise
[22:14] but ourselves ourselves being sanctified
[22:18] and first corinthians chapter 4 verse 2
[22:20] it says moreover it is required in
[22:22] stewards that a man be found faithful
[22:25] this is not just true of the stewards of
[22:26] the mysteries but rather of anyone that
[22:28] is a steward this is a principle of
[22:30] stewardship that if one is being given
[22:32] responsibility for somebody else they
[22:34] have what is called a fiduciary duty to
[22:36] them
[22:37] under the one that's put them in that
[22:38] place it's required of stewards that a
[22:40] man be found faithful
[22:42] catch this a steward is a ruler or head
[22:44] over something
[22:46] but it's also a steward in this sense is
[22:48] appointed to govern in someone's stead
[22:51] this is the way that paul is meaning it
[22:53] having oversight in the stead of the
[22:55] actual ruler or owner so to have
[22:57] stewardship means you are in the place
[23:00] of having headship or control over
[23:02] property or someone or something that is
[23:05] somebody else's
[23:06] so paul was saying the mysteries of god
[23:08] those are gods but we've been given
[23:10] stewardship over them so we are
[23:12] operating in god's stead over his
[23:15] mystery so think of this always as
[23:17] parents you may be leaders and you may
[23:19] be rulers as men you may be the head but
[23:21] it's actually in god's stead or having
[23:24] oversight over something that is the
[23:26] lord's
[23:28] your wife is wife says the lords your
[23:30] children are the lords they are the
[23:31] heritage of the lord so we must look at
[23:33] one another and as ministers we look at
[23:36] the sheep as being god's sheep not our
[23:38] own we look at our wife as being a
[23:40] daughter of god so we recognize the
[23:42] ownership is the lord's and i'm a
[23:44] steward in the office of husband i'm a
[23:46] steward in the office of the father of
[23:48] those who are the lords
[23:51] one thing that i use well i just
[23:53] honestly say god used as an example to
[23:55] me
[23:57] and as a young minister he had something
[23:59] happened to me
[24:01] and he spoke to my heart and he said
[24:02] you're nothing without me
[24:04] and i realized very very quickly that
[24:06] it's not about me
[24:08] and one of the best things i think you
[24:09] could speak to ministers is to
[24:10] constantly remind them it's not about
[24:12] you
[24:12] not about not about you
[24:14] and maybe we should all sing specials to
[24:16] one another it's not about you
[24:18] it's not about you preacher because it's
[24:21] not
[24:22] it's not about us the christian life is
[24:24] not about you christian life is about
[24:26] service it's about living for others
[24:27] it's not your selfish ambitions it's not
[24:29] what your testimony looks like it's
[24:31] about christ and his seed and it's a
[24:33] life of sacrifice
[24:36] then as parents
[24:38] and and especially again as husbands and
[24:41] fathers
[24:42] we first demonstrate
[24:44] what to do before we tell them what to
[24:46] do
[24:48] in other words we've kind of already led
[24:50] without opening our mouths
[24:53] we demonstrate what we want them to do
[24:55] before we tell them what to do in
[24:57] proverbs chapter 16 verse 12. it says is
[25:00] it it is an abomination
[25:03] to kings to commit wickedness
[25:05] for the throne is established by
[25:06] righteousness
[25:08] now just ponder that it's an abomination
[25:11] for a king to commit wickedness why
[25:14] because their throne
[25:15] their authority their power
[25:17] is upheld by righteousness
[25:20] if kings derived their authority from
[25:21] god if this was a divine right if god is
[25:23] the one that places the king in his
[25:25] position then unrighteousness
[25:27] essentially moves him out under the
[25:28] headship of god and it completely
[25:31] undermines their office
[25:33] so saying it's a king should not commit
[25:35] wickedness because his very authority
[25:37] his power and his position is derived
[25:39] from a righteousness that comes from god
[25:42] and so in order to have authority you
[25:44] must live correctly
[25:47] in order for your authority to be
[25:48] effective you must live correctly
[25:50] because true leadership true headship is
[25:53] by
[25:54] example leadership is never the function
[25:57] of domination
[25:59] of an imbalance of power leadership is
[26:01] never the function of just being able to
[26:03] manipulate or using harsh words it's not
[26:06] just by being strict or being a
[26:08] a dictator and taking advantage of
[26:10] people or having more resources and
[26:12] buying uh uh
[26:13] buying behavior or demanding certain
[26:15] things but the way that it ought to work
[26:17] in that mutual dependency is that one
[26:20] lives a righteous life and having been
[26:22] put in that position as a head or a
[26:24] leader or a parent then they have a kind
[26:27] of life that they're demonstrating
[26:28] before those that they're training and
[26:30] leading in this case a king who lives
[26:33] righteously his authority is not his own
[26:35] but it has the backing of heaven amen
[26:40] and so our authority within the home
[26:42] must be established likewise by example
[26:44] by righteousness
[26:46] notice how peter exhorts the elders and
[26:48] pastors he says in first peter chapter
[26:51] five verses one to four i'm wanting just
[26:53] to draw these types out of that
[26:55] relationship dynamic of one who is
[26:57] teaching one that is leading the elders
[26:59] which are among you i exhort whom i'm
[27:01] also an elder and a witness of the
[27:03] sufferings of christ and also partaker
[27:05] of the glory that shall be revealed feed
[27:07] the flock of god which is around the
[27:09] world via the world wide web
[27:12] feed the flock of god which is among you
[27:14] taking the oversight thereof
[27:17] not by constraint but willingly
[27:20] and there are there's two different ways
[27:23] that you can look at this that you're
[27:24] going to take oversight not constraining
[27:26] them right you can look at this not by
[27:28] constraining them but let it be
[27:30] voluntary let it be willingly but then
[27:32] also there's a way that this reads and
[27:34] i've seen it it lived out i i love to
[27:36] see a pastor who embraces his calling
[27:39] i i've heard pastors before kind of say
[27:41] well i'm you know if i didn't have to do
[27:43] this i would leave and you're kind of
[27:45] thinking
[27:46] i don't know if i really understand what
[27:47] you're trying to say
[27:48] you don't want to be here you know you
[27:50] don't want to be a pastor i love seeing
[27:51] pastors who have a pastor pastor's heart
[27:53] and they embrace that and and they give
[27:55] themselves to it so it's not even by
[27:57] constraint why i'm being forced to pass
[27:58] to you and i guess i'll just have to put
[27:59] up with you and i'm sick and tired of
[28:01] pastored people who don't have the love
[28:02] of god in their heart and you're just
[28:04] kind of up there because you're being
[28:05] forced to
[28:07] but you do it
[28:08] i'm willing to do this i want to do this
[28:10] i and i love to do this so there's so
[28:12] much mint in this and then not for
[28:14] filthy luke or not just because it's a
[28:16] paycheck but of a ready mind
[28:19] i think somebody accused me of coming
[28:20] here for a paycheck and the person they
[28:22] said it to says do you know what he does
[28:23] do for his day job
[28:27] and uh he says neither is being lords ex
[28:30] being lords that's where i wanted to get
[28:32] neither as being
[28:33] lawyer lords over god's heritage
[28:37] but being in samples to the flock
[28:40] and when the chief shepherd shall appear
[28:42] you shall receive a crown of glory that
[28:44] fadeth not away
[28:46] not as being lords over god's heritage
[28:50] but being examples to the flock and then
[28:52] also beautiful and so subtle and when
[28:55] the chief shepherd shall appear
[28:57] what is he reminding these guys of hey
[29:00] you're just in the stead of the shepherd
[29:03] if you're a shepherd if you're
[29:04] passionate if you're leading you're
[29:06] doing it as a steward on behalf of
[29:08] somebody else and he's coming back and
[29:11] he's gonna you're gonna have to answer
[29:12] for what you do and even christians are
[29:14] gonna stand before the bema and we're
[29:17] gonna answer to him whether we've done
[29:18] good and whether we or whether we've led
[29:20] right and led correctly and we're gonna
[29:22] be judged for our reward so he reminds
[29:24] the elders hey there's a chief shepherd
[29:27] so be sure you rule correctly so that
[29:29] you can receive the right kind of crown
[29:32] at your judgment feed the flock of god
[29:34] neither being lords over god's heritage
[29:37] but the examples don't stand over them
[29:39] telling them what to do but show them
[29:41] what to do
[29:43] because he says not being lords over
[29:45] them that's exercising power over them
[29:48] telling them what to do but be an
[29:50] example to them of what to do
[29:53] can i say something just to get your
[29:54] mind thinking a little bit
[29:56] the lord's really been dealing with on
[29:57] me this for some time this thought
[29:58] crystallizing but you know there's a
[29:59] difference between a groomer and a
[30:01] cultivator
[30:04] really what you think about this
[30:06] this isn't about people who groom pets
[30:08] this is
[30:09] this is even the language that we use in
[30:11] the world how people groom people to get
[30:13] them to do things that
[30:15] that they otherwise wouldn't normally do
[30:16] or take advantage of them and there's a
[30:18] difference between a groomer and a
[30:20] cultivator
[30:22] a man of god who cultivates you will
[30:23] always have an interest in what's best
[30:25] for you
[30:26] a groomer has no use for you when you
[30:28] can't do anything for them
[30:33] he sounds to be lords over god's don't
[30:35] be lords of god's heritage but be
[30:36] examples be cultivators not groomers
[30:40] and first timothy chapter three verses
[30:41] two to seven to me i think this just
[30:43] perfectly represents this because tim
[30:46] for the paul speaking to timothy
[30:49] likewise exhorting him to be an example
[30:51] of the believer he says the bishop then
[30:52] must be blameless
[30:54] the husband of one wife now why would he
[30:56] need to be the husband of one wife have
[30:58] you ever thought about that
[31:01] because you teach your children never do
[31:03] such a thing as that
[31:04] and bring them up in the admonition of
[31:06] god what brother brahm said
[31:08] so god knowing that the perfect
[31:10] reflection would be that a man not just
[31:12] the preacher but the man would have one
[31:14] wife
[31:15] he likewise then teaching correctly if
[31:18] he wants to teach the flock correctly he
[31:20] can't say listen we're taught in the
[31:21] message of the hour brother bam said
[31:23] that you remain as you are but you teach
[31:25] your children never to do what you've
[31:27] done through divorce and remarriage so
[31:29] we're going to teach our children to do
[31:31] that then how hard would it be for a
[31:33] pastor who has
[31:34] with a woman who's not his wife but then
[31:36] has a living wife telling everyone
[31:38] listen don't do what i've done don't do
[31:39] what i've done and it's just almost like
[31:41] charlie brown's teacher right
[31:44] because these examples so loud they
[31:46] don't really get what he's trying to say
[31:49] it has to be by example so it says
[31:50] vigilant sober of good behavior
[31:53] given to hospitality
[31:55] apt to teach not given to wine no
[31:58] striker not greedy of filthy looker but
[32:00] patient not a brawler my right not
[32:03] covetous
[32:05] one that ruleth well his own house
[32:08] having his children in subjection with
[32:10] all gravity now
[32:12] i think we even touched on this recently
[32:14] on what it means to rule
[32:16] and and there's some that might think
[32:17] this is just get everybody under your
[32:19] thumb be have them in subjection
[32:22] but gravity means with all honesty
[32:25] and it it's the word actually speaks
[32:27] that which entitles a person to respect
[32:30] so you rule your house and you have your
[32:33] children in subjection because they
[32:35] respect you
[32:37] you have them in you have them in
[32:39] subjection with all
[32:40] gravity i even remember brother loyal
[32:42] one time when i administered there in
[32:44] minnesota there's a brother's breakfast
[32:46] and the question was being asked about
[32:47] you know what does this mean all gravity
[32:49] and ruling the house because the
[32:50] question kind of came up can does a man
[32:52] have a right to preach if his children
[32:53] aren't exactly serving the lord order
[32:55] they're doing this and they're doing
[32:56] that and and and i just in the
[32:57] fellowship we're talking about what it
[32:59] means and listen gravity holds you in
[33:01] your place it doesn't drive you straight
[33:02] plumbed through the earth's crust
[33:05] right
[33:06] gravity has a way of just kind of
[33:07] keeping you right
[33:09] i i still kind of have some movement i
[33:11] have some liberty but it's gravity
[33:12] that's keeping me tethered at least to
[33:14] something and so there's a there's a
[33:16] there's an image that's being expressed
[33:18] here to rule your house with all gravity
[33:20] it's it's a conduct and a behavior that
[33:23] has the respect of your children you
[33:25] haven't just locked them into something
[33:28] and doing it by force
[33:30] makes this beautiful statement in verse
[33:31] 5 for if a man knoweth not how to rule
[33:33] his own house
[33:35] doesn't say that he doesn't rule his own
[33:37] house but it says if he doesn't know how
[33:39] to rule his own house how shall he take
[33:41] care of the church of god
[33:43] in that we see the symmetry between the
[33:45] church and a home
[33:47] not a novice lest being lifted up with
[33:48] pride he fall into condemnation of the
[33:50] devil moreover he must have a good
[33:52] report of them which are without let's
[33:54] default to reproach and snare of the
[33:56] devil
[33:58] in these things we could say that paul
[34:00] is telling
[34:01] timothy that a bishop must be blameless
[34:04] and he must do these things because his
[34:06] teaching his instruction will be undone
[34:08] by his example
[34:10] the way that he lives if he's if he can
[34:13] be blamed if he doesn't have good
[34:14] uh behavior if he's uh doesn't have good
[34:17] reporter then with her out if he's
[34:18] lifted up with pride all these things
[34:20] will undermine his pure doctrine his his
[34:22] instructions his admonitions everything
[34:24] he's trying to do it'll undermine what
[34:26] he's trying to accomplish
[34:29] in zechariah chapter 11 verses 15 16 and
[34:32] 17 we
[34:33] at our text which was kind of the which
[34:35] was part of the inspiration
[34:37] of recognizing bad habits of parenthood
[34:40] or bad habits of fathers
[34:42] that in the example that zechariah gives
[34:44] instead of saying show them what is
[34:47] faithful show them what is just but take
[34:49] unto yourselves the instruments of a
[34:51] foolish shepherd
[34:53] a shepherd is one as a keeper he's a
[34:55] feeder he's a pastor so we're using it
[34:57] as the image of one that leads or rules
[34:59] or teaches as us as parents we're
[35:01] leading our children as lambs we're
[35:03] leaving we or we could say goats as kids
[35:05] right this is what we're doing with our
[35:07] children we're leading them and then
[35:09] instruments are the tools that are used
[35:10] to do a job
[35:12] so these are things we're seeing it and
[35:13] a fool the foolish is here someone who's
[35:15] kind of anti-truth won't submit to truth
[35:17] doesn't take in to consider truth to be
[35:19] foolish here it speaks to someone who's
[35:20] combative or contentious they're
[35:22] undisciplined they're unrestrained
[35:25] and so he says and the lord sent to me
[35:26] take unto thee yet the instruments of a
[35:29] fool of shepherd for lo i will raise up
[35:31] a shepherd in the land which shall not
[35:33] visit those that be cut off
[35:35] i think we went through these before as
[35:37] a church
[35:38] last year about a year ago neither shall
[35:40] seek the young one
[35:42] nor hill that is broken nor feedeth that
[35:45] that standeth still
[35:47] well these are these are this is the
[35:48] real work of a shepherd
[35:50] it's not all wool and milk right right
[35:53] and all shepherds they're just going to
[35:54] fleece the sheep and live off their milk
[35:56] and eat their meat and have their wool
[35:58] and live live live with nice finery but
[36:00] this is the reality of a shepherd to
[36:02] visit those that are cut off to seek the
[36:04] young heal the broken feed those that
[36:06] are standing still can't move you you
[36:08] take care of these this is the true
[36:10] labor
[36:11] and the glory of pastoring and this is
[36:13] the real work of a parent
[36:17] this is
[36:18] and let me just say this as a way of
[36:20] encouraging all of you if you have
[36:21] children with you tonight i want you to
[36:23] look at your children
[36:24] and say god call made me for this
[36:28] if he gave them to you he's given you
[36:30] what you need to to raise them to teach
[36:32] them i i want you from this moment on to
[36:34] hear the voice of a man of god telling
[36:36] you you can do it you're called to it he
[36:39] wouldn't have given them to you if you
[36:40] couldn't he's equipped you has given you
[36:42] the things you need if circumstances in
[36:44] life have left you raising them by them
[36:46] themselves or without much means you can
[36:48] still do it god is the force multiplier
[36:50] his word is enough and he's going to
[36:52] give you what you need to get the job
[36:54] done
[36:56] and the rest is up to him
[36:59] and so he says instead of doing this but
[37:01] he shall eat the flesh of the fat and
[37:03] tear their claws into pieces and pieces
[37:06] woe to the idol shepherd that leaveth
[37:08] the flock
[37:09] and this is the judgment to him the
[37:11] sword shall be upon his arm and upon his
[37:12] right eye and his arm shall be cleaned
[37:14] right up and his right eye shall be
[37:15] utterly darkened
[37:17] so zechariah is describing the work of a
[37:20] wise shepherd by saying what a foolish
[37:21] shepherd does
[37:23] not beautiful
[37:24] he's really we can look at this and
[37:26] and recognize what a wise leader will do
[37:28] a wise shepherd a wise father a wise
[37:30] husband a wise wife and mother these are
[37:32] the things that they'll be attentive to
[37:34] this is where they really engage it's
[37:35] not just all about uh the fat and the
[37:38] and the wool and tearing the claws in
[37:41] pieces but it's about these other things
[37:42] that's where real wisdom is manifested
[37:44] that's when the real work gets done he's
[37:46] saying that leaders who aren't willing
[37:48] to sacrifice aren't willing to be
[37:50] proactive aren't willing to sanctify
[37:52] themselves but indulge in their own
[37:54] desires they're the ones that lose the
[37:56] ability to lead their powers he says
[37:58] their arm being dried up their power
[38:00] their influence and even their ability
[38:02] to lead says they lose their eyesight
[38:04] that's what happens when you indulge
[38:05] yourself and don't invest in those
[38:08] you're tasked with leading
[38:10] your wisdom dries up your discernment
[38:12] dries up because then all of a sudden
[38:12] it's about you about what you get out of
[38:14] it how you look how you can live with
[38:17] all the fineries of life how you can do
[38:18] this and you could do that and you
[38:19] almost feel this is where the real
[38:21] danger is now i'm the head of this house
[38:23] and my children serve me and my wife
[38:24] says hold on buddy no wait a minute you
[38:26] serve them too
[38:29] you absolutely serve them too but
[38:30] whenever you just want to sit there and
[38:32] eat the flesh of the fat
[38:34] and not engage in verse 16 and do the
[38:37] things that you must do that's woe to
[38:38] that idol shepherd what you've done is
[38:40] you've left your responsibility to your
[38:42] family and you're going to lose your
[38:43] power you're going to lose your
[38:44] influence going to lose your ability to
[38:45] lead you're gonna lose your discernment
[38:46] you're gonna lose your wisdom and your
[38:48] and this is the caution and the warning
[38:54] i'm happy in the lord anyway
[38:57] right let's be happy tonight
[39:00] all things we try to teach our children
[39:03] first instruct them by example
[39:06] and then reinforce with words
[39:09] all things that we try to teach our
[39:10] children first instruct them by example
[39:13] and then reinforce with words
[39:16] what is the statement that is made by
[39:18] one of the
[39:19] early revivalists who said that to go
[39:21] and to
[39:22] turn the world upside down and heal the
[39:24] sick and
[39:26] raise the dead and preach the word of
[39:28] god and burn the fire you know the town
[39:30] on fire and use words with if necessary
[39:33] can't remember exactly how it's read but
[39:35] that's kind of the 2022 version of it i
[39:37] guess
[39:40] but the head of the house is a husband
[39:41] we put him in that place he's the head
[39:43] of the house but the head is figurative
[39:45] of a life-giver
[39:47] the head isn't the one that the life
[39:49] serves but the head is the one that is
[39:50] giving the life it's figurative of the
[39:51] source of life so therefore the life
[39:54] lived by the head is to flow down to the
[39:56] rest of the body
[39:58] it's the idea of the head being the
[39:59] source of life and if you cut off the
[40:01] head life is lost it's because there
[40:03] ought to be some this wisdom that's
[40:05] prevailing to the entire body life is
[40:07] flowing from the head that's the source
[40:10] of the virtue that's the source of the
[40:11] righteousness that's the source of the
[40:13] purity
[40:15] so in a lot of ways power and we've been
[40:17] doing this over the last several months
[40:18] or since the beginning power needs to be
[40:19] redefined
[40:21] i think nominal christianity has created
[40:23] the idea of a john wayne jesus
[40:25] it's a rambo jesus it's the rough man
[40:28] you know women in subjection and it's
[40:29] really it's really it is chauvinism
[40:32] masquerading behind a false image of
[40:33] christ
[40:35] it is a bigotry masquerading behind
[40:37] behind righteousness there's a real
[40:39] there's a lot of foul spirits that are
[40:41] masquerading behind the name of
[40:43] christianity and it doesn't line up with
[40:45] the word of god it doesn't line up with
[40:46] the message of the hour it doesn't line
[40:48] up with the bible and so true headship
[40:50] power being redefined headship is not
[40:53] bringing people to obedience or
[40:54] subjection by force but through respect
[40:59] because they see a life lived by the
[41:01] word and they're willing to honor that
[41:04] and they respect and it's mutual
[41:06] jeremiah chapter 3 verse 15 and i will
[41:08] give you pastors according to mine heart
[41:11] which shall feed you with knowledge and
[41:13] understanding
[41:15] this is a mouthful i'll give you pastors
[41:17] not the foolish shepherds but i'll give
[41:19] you pastors who have my heart which
[41:21] shall feed you with knowledge and
[41:23] understanding this is a persuasive love
[41:26] by a pure example that shows you the
[41:27] correct kind of life that's what's meant
[41:30] by a pastor after my heart it's going to
[41:32] be a persuasive love by a pure example
[41:36] that shows the correct kind of life
[41:38] shows the right way it's leadership uh
[41:40] it's not the beating it's not the
[41:42] flogging it's not the abuse but it's the
[41:43] right kind of leadership to bring them
[41:45] to the
[41:46] the folds to the places of feeding and
[41:48] resting and drink in order to just
[41:51] produce
[41:52] bear the wool
[41:54] that they're ordained to bear
[41:57] and i say this to fathers and husbands
[41:59] but likewise just to parents we must be
[42:01] willing to do our duty first
[42:03] as shepherds upon whom the sheep depend
[42:06] those of us who have the holy ghost
[42:08] recognizing our children not yet having
[42:10] it therefore we're examples as shepherds
[42:13] with the higher intelligence to guide
[42:14] them and to lead them
[42:16] as they as children who depend upon us
[42:20] i believe brother ben taught that the
[42:21] husband is a spiritual pastor to his
[42:22] wife to the home
[42:24] the wife is called the fifth gospel
[42:26] she's a pastor to her little kitties
[42:27] there she is an image of an associate
[42:29] pastor within the home so his pastors
[42:31] the the fathers described as a priest
[42:34] within the home
[42:36] being pastors and priests of the home
[42:38] who lead by example and not by authority
[42:40] or force
[42:43] coming back to we are stewards we should
[42:45] view ourselves as stewards of god's
[42:47] heritage amen
[42:49] those are god's children that should
[42:50] moderate all behavior that's god's
[42:52] daughter that should moderate all
[42:53] behavior these are god's people that
[42:55] moderates all behavior because we have a
[42:57] duty to our spouses we have a duty to
[42:58] children we have a duty to one another
[43:03] in jeremiah chapter 10 verse 21 for the
[43:05] pastors are become brutish
[43:08] and have not sought the lord therefore
[43:10] they shall not prosper and all their
[43:12] flocks shall be scattered why are the
[43:14] sheep scattered it's because of the
[43:15] behavior
[43:17] or the one that leads
[43:18] it says the pastors have become brutish
[43:20] there's certainly a way that we could
[43:21] maybe try to describe this in such a way
[43:23] to where the pastor's a brute
[43:25] he's overbearing and he's rude and he's
[43:27] mean and he's offensive but really to be
[43:29] brutus means unreceptive
[43:31] become dull-hearted
[43:33] in other words they get to a point where
[43:34] it's almost as if they're numb they're
[43:36] not going to respond to you
[43:37] yeah hey
[43:39] call email try to reach out try to get
[43:40] home they're not going to respond to you
[43:41] they can't be touched they can't feel
[43:43] true
[43:46] they become unresponsive to your needs
[43:48] they become unresponsive to what you're
[43:49] really going through they're not
[43:51] concerned about you anymore they become
[43:53] brutish they don't have to come off as
[43:54] these loud railing mean offensive brutes
[43:58] it just means when they disengage they
[43:59] ghost you spiritually almost
[44:01] they're not responsive to your needs
[44:03] anymore they kind of write you off or
[44:04] cut you off there's this distance that i
[44:06] said that's what a brood is that's when
[44:08] someone becomes brutus they don't feel
[44:09] for you anymore they don't care for you
[44:11] anymore they're not concerned about you
[44:12] anymore
[44:15] wow
[44:18] pastors become brutish and that's what
[44:19] scatters their sheep
[44:23] in colossians 3 19 then look at the
[44:26] husbands the role of a husband
[44:29] husband love your wives
[44:31] and be not bitter against them
[44:34] that's angry don't be irritated or harsh
[44:36] towards them
[44:39] as husbands we have a responsibility to
[44:40] be the sanctifying stabilizing force for
[44:43] them
[44:44] love your wives and be not bitter
[44:46] against them you can't be to be angry to
[44:48] be irritated to be harsh towards them
[44:50] you're sowing seeds of harshness
[44:53] because women are going to receive seed
[44:54] and produce what you sow into them and
[44:56] it's just the nature of a woman to do
[44:58] that so if you're sowing anger you're
[44:59] sowing irritation you're sowing
[45:01] harshness then your bitterness against
[45:03] them is gonna breed the same in their
[45:05] hearts
[45:06] so we have a responsibility to love
[45:09] then to the children in colossians 3 21
[45:11] fathers provoke not your children to
[45:12] anger lest they be discouraged
[45:18] i'd love to amplify this more but it
[45:19] says we have the capacity to provoke our
[45:22] children to anger so therefore we're
[45:24] being warned not to do it right
[45:28] in other words if i could say this way
[45:29] you paul recognizes that though we're
[45:32] filled with the holy ghost there's still
[45:33] a base instinct that resides within our
[45:35] spirits that we've got to be cautioned
[45:36] against
[45:37] don't lead incorrectly
[45:39] don't provoke your children to anger
[45:41] because if you do it discourages them
[45:44] and this is teaching to christians this
[45:46] is teaching to those who have the
[45:47] baptismal ghost it's something that we
[45:49] have to yield ourselves to don't provoke
[45:51] your children to anger lest they be
[45:54] discouraged so we can anger them
[45:57] and provoke them to anger and it's
[45:58] through our provocation that they become
[46:00] discouraged
[46:02] we are the cause of their anger we are
[46:04] the cause of their discouragement
[46:07] we can produce the frustrated and
[46:08] patient spirits
[46:10] that we often encounter
[46:12] and we're the ones that were sowing the
[46:14] seeds
[46:20] is anybody longing for the song service
[46:21] all of a sudden
[46:23] i'm just looking at it looking at
[46:24] another page of notes and i'm glad the
[46:26] worship was just so wonderful
[46:28] uh
[46:29] i don't want to belabor it tonight
[46:32] i'm doing it at least with a smile right
[46:33] that's a that's an improvement for me
[46:38] i want to i want to touch on something
[46:39] very quickly i think it's good to do
[46:41] this in this context hopefully it won't
[46:42] be too long it's 8 27
[46:45] and so you know exactly what time it is
[46:46] you don't have to look at your your
[46:48] apple watch
[46:51] ephesians chapter 5 verse 22 wives
[46:54] submit yourselves into your own husbands
[46:55] as unto the lord
[46:57] so it gives this requirement wives to
[46:59] submit to their husbands so we could
[47:01] recognize this there's some submission
[47:04] i'll say this and again i think i'm
[47:06] getting pulled into this just to amplify
[47:08] it more the requirement of children to
[47:10] obey their parents is different than the
[47:12] requirement that wives obey it's a
[47:14] different word that is used and it's a
[47:16] wife acknowledging her own rights as a
[47:19] christian and she's voluntarily yielding
[47:22] to be a co to be a co-parent to be a
[47:25] co-worker together with the man
[47:28] it's a beautiful a beautiful image of
[47:30] taking her power her equality and
[47:32] joining it together with the man whereas
[47:33] children are told to obey their parents
[47:35] it means just to submit because that's
[47:37] what you must do in the lord it's right
[47:39] but it says wives submit yourselves into
[47:40] your own husbands as unto the lord
[47:41] brother brad i'm picking this up in
[47:42] revelations chapter four part three the
[47:44] sermon he preached she says wives submit
[47:47] yourselves unto your own husbands as
[47:48] unto the lord because he is your lord
[47:50] and we get the loudest of the amens from
[47:52] the men and how many knows that you
[47:54] women and the loudest of amens from the
[47:56] women he said that's exactly right the
[47:58] bible said so at the beginning it's
[47:59] still that way why submit yourselves
[48:01] unto your own husband as unto the lord
[48:04] so this is scriptural this is the
[48:06] principle in scripture now there's
[48:07] another part to this
[48:09] so that if you have fathers that provoke
[48:11] their children to anger
[48:13] and the father can cause their children
[48:15] to be discouraged and angry that creates
[48:17] a a difficult dynamic between father and
[48:20] child but then also the husbands can be
[48:22] bitter against the wives that's going to
[48:24] produce a nature within the wife
[48:27] as if it was brother paul lafontaine who
[48:28] first made the statement and it really
[48:30] stuck with me that a man's sinful
[48:32] tendency is to be harsh and that a
[48:34] woman's sinful tendency is to resist
[48:36] headship and just look at how those two
[48:38] play together
[48:40] right
[48:41] if my tendency is to be harsh
[48:43] as a man and a woman's tendency is to be
[48:45] i resist headship as a woman
[48:47] both weaknesses provoke the other
[48:50] right i'm going to be harsh and you're
[48:52] going to say no i'm not going to submiss
[48:53] like well i'll be harsher
[48:55] right because it just it provokes it
[48:58] and they both get polarized right
[49:00] because i'm harsh and i won't submit and
[49:02] you want to make him submit right to
[49:04] harshness
[49:05] to authority to force
[49:07] never work that way
[49:09] because it feeds her sinful tendency
[49:11] and so when the wife is asked to submit
[49:13] to her husband says unto the lord
[49:14] brother branham says husbands love your
[49:16] wives even as christ also loved the
[49:18] church and gave himself forward he says
[49:20] don't run over her if you do that you're
[49:22] not fit to be a husband
[49:25] so it's not running over them to get
[49:27] them to submit yeah my wife is
[49:29] underneath me yeah she's paralyzed
[49:31] you've run over her she's got no more
[49:33] function anymore she's you've completely
[49:36] robbed her of life and spirit you've
[49:38] broke her
[49:39] that's not submission
[49:41] that's being paralyzed
[49:43] says don't run over if you do that
[49:44] you're not fit to be a husband that's
[49:46] right
[49:49] because this is this is the dynamics
[49:50] we're talking about and i wanted this
[49:52] quickly matthew chapter 9 verses 7 and 8
[49:54] they say unto him why did moses then
[49:56] command to give a writing of divorcement
[49:59] and to put her away he said to them
[50:02] moses
[50:03] say
[50:04] moses let you divorce your wives because
[50:06] you have hard hearts
[50:10] this is the truth
[50:11] moses because of the hardness of your
[50:13] heart suffered you to put away your
[50:15] wives but from the beginning it was not
[50:17] so
[50:19] do you recognize then why moses was put
[50:22] in a position to give a rid of
[50:23] divorcement to the men because of the
[50:25] hardness of their hearts the harshness
[50:27] of their hearts that was the reason for
[50:29] the divorce
[50:31] it's not even that well you had a right
[50:32] to you had a good reason to no is
[50:34] because the man being unwilling to be
[50:36] sensitive the man being unwilling to be
[50:38] forgiven because he says from from the
[50:39] beginning it wasn't so
[50:42] i'm going to restrain myself not to go
[50:44] deeper into that but notice what god
[50:45] says in malachi 2 16 for the lord the
[50:47] god of israel saith that he hateth
[50:49] putting away
[50:50] god hates divorce
[50:53] he hates it
[50:55] he says for one covered violence with
[50:56] his garment in other words a man's
[50:58] violence is exposed and in the putting
[51:00] away of his wife saith the lord of hosts
[51:02] therefore take heed to your spirit right
[51:04] notice what he had
[51:05] approaches the spirit of the man who
[51:09] puts away divorce he puts away his wife
[51:11] and divorce because god hates it and he
[51:12] says
[51:13] take heed to your spirit that you do not
[51:14] treacherously deceitfully offensively or
[51:17] faithlessly
[51:19] and what causes hearts
[51:24] brother branham says in thinking man's
[51:25] filter
[51:26] he says see the woman sees she
[51:28] reverenced her husband reverence her
[51:30] husband
[51:31] then a husband ought to live such a life
[51:33] before his wife that his wife could
[51:34] reverence him as a son of god
[51:36] this is the beautiful balance that we
[51:38] must catch in this because it's wives
[51:39] submit to your husbands but it's it's
[51:41] it's not just
[51:43] all on the woman but the man ought to
[51:45] live such a life before his wife that
[51:47] his wife could reverence him as a son of
[51:48] god this is the leadership by example
[51:51] this is the example that we said this is
[51:53] ruling your family with all gravity with
[51:55] an honesty which entitles a person to
[51:57] respect
[51:58] and if he doesn't live that kind of life
[52:00] well then of course she wouldn't
[52:01] reverence him
[52:02] because she knows what he's made of
[52:04] but when it's a man that is a reverend
[52:05] man reverent and clean when his wife is
[52:07] before his family he's a real servant of
[52:08] god then the woman children all should
[52:10] respect that servant of god with
[52:12] reverence
[52:14] i know he's lifting up an ideal family i
[52:15] believe that we ought to recognize in
[52:18] our families we should view one another
[52:19] in our families or at least our goal is
[52:21] to be equally yoked in faith and
[52:23] experience in the word of god that's
[52:25] where these are two omnipotents meeting
[52:27] in a marriage
[52:29] the wife is loved by the husband he's uh
[52:32] he he's doing exactly what the word says
[52:34] she's willingly submitting because he's
[52:35] the kind of man that she would reverence
[52:37] as a son of god that's the beautiful
[52:39] dynamic in dynamo of a family
[52:41] because what pick up in verse 25
[52:43] husbands love your wives even as christ
[52:45] also loved the church and gave himself
[52:47] for it so you're to love her
[52:49] as christ loved her and the love is
[52:52] sacrificial why because sanctification
[52:54] requires sacrifice that he might
[52:56] sanctify and cleanse it with the washing
[52:59] of the water by the word in order to
[53:01] sanctify and cleanse
[53:04] it it takes a sacrifice
[53:06] yes sir
[53:08] he gave himself
[53:11] and because he gives himself to
[53:13] sanctifying cleanse he can nourish and
[53:15] cherish
[53:17] love your wives even as christ loved
[53:21] brother abraham said of christ there's
[53:22] the man
[53:25] he says and i believe i don't have these
[53:26] there my next scripture's proverbs 29 i
[53:28] just have these here in the presence of
[53:30] hell he defeated hell and overcame hell
[53:32] in the presence of the grave you
[53:33] overcame the grave
[53:35] all by the word
[53:37] and humility
[53:41] it wasn't by the word and a hard heart
[53:43] i was like man jesus was gangster no it
[53:45] was all by the word and humility
[53:49] all by the word and human oh my he says
[53:52] there's the real man
[53:54] there's the one to make your example
[53:56] this is our example of manhood this is
[53:58] our example of sending out it's our
[54:00] example of discipleship it's our example
[54:02] of training it's the example of taking
[54:03] our children under our tutelage and
[54:05] train them and then sending them out in
[54:06] the world i want you to be sanctified
[54:08] when you go but if you're going to be
[54:09] sanctified when you leave i myself must
[54:11] also be sanctified this is the measure
[54:14] of the complete man this is the man that
[54:16] we as men ought to aspire to be
[54:19] there's the real man and it's the word
[54:20] and humility brother man said a man
[54:22] ain't measured by muscles that's a beast
[54:24] a man's measured by character
[54:28] to sanctify and to cleanse i'm wanting
[54:30] to give the image of emphasis by example
[54:34] here are the parents here's the man
[54:36] sanctified brother man said is a
[54:37] compound word which means cleansed and
[54:39] set aside for service
[54:43] it's preparation
[54:45] it's not just subjection it's not just
[54:47] order for the sake of order but we
[54:49] sanctify ourselves so that we can be put
[54:51] into service and then i sanctify myself
[54:54] for their sakes that they might be
[54:55] cleansed and prepared for service
[54:59] these young men right that can do this
[55:02] they can wiggle their fingers these
[55:04] young men are going to they're at the
[55:06] very doorstep of service
[55:09] they're they're they're not the church
[55:10] of tomorrow they are in church today
[55:12] learning today jack you've got it down
[55:14] too you can do it and so there's a
[55:16] they're being instructed now they're
[55:18] learning now they're growing now and
[55:20] what are we doing we're sanctifying them
[55:22] and we're preparing them for service
[55:25] listen i i take great joy knowing that
[55:28] there's not one word wasted that i
[55:30] preach over this pulpit there's not one
[55:32] effort wasted by the parents who do the
[55:34] right thing listen young people your
[55:36] baptism of the holy ghost is coming and
[55:39] you're gonna stand one day and you're
[55:40] gonna testify of a ceiling of god of a
[55:43] face-to-face experience with god this
[55:45] message is gonna become a reality this
[55:47] christ that you
[55:48] hear about this one you want to know
[55:50] this real genuine christianity is going
[55:52] to get a hold of you one day and you're
[55:54] going to be testifying because what
[55:56] we're doing is preparing you for that
[55:58] service
[56:03] and this preparation is not by force
[56:05] it's not by advantage but by example
[56:09] by christ's example
[56:13] can i leave just one more with you
[56:17] proverbs chapter 29 verse 12. this is
[56:19] another one's coming like why
[56:22] if a ruler hearkeneth to lies all his
[56:24] servants are wicked amen
[56:28] you're thinking brethren is that really
[56:29] in the bible
[56:31] well just turn there let's find it
[56:34] i mean i found it
[56:37] think about this
[56:40] it's in one of those spots of just the
[56:41] one-liners yeah if a ruler hearken to
[56:45] lies all his servants are wicked
[56:55] the conduct that we initiate and
[56:56] cultivate is what's going to prevail in
[56:58] our children
[57:01] if a ruler hearkens the lies it corrupts
[57:03] his servants
[57:05] if you're subject to them
[57:08] if you're the purveyor of them
[57:11] if you're susceptible to them and you
[57:13] express them that's why we have to take
[57:14] such great care i i mean this very
[57:17] sincerely as your brother we need to be
[57:19] very careful the things that we repeat
[57:22] right that we're pulling off of facebook
[57:24] we pull off we pull out of the off the
[57:26] web and and the things we hear that
[57:27] people talk about and we spread things
[57:30] and we say things and you got to be
[57:31] careful if you become susceptible to
[57:34] lies and the spreader of lies your
[57:36] children will be wicked
[57:41] specifically speaking to the nature and
[57:44] character of a parent a ruler a leader
[57:46] if a ruler is susceptible to lies and
[57:49] lies himself it corrupts his
[57:52] servants it's leadership by example you
[57:55] could try to tell your children this
[57:57] message is the truth this message is the
[57:58] truth christ is real this message is the
[58:00] truth but if you yourself do not receive
[58:03] it and do not live it then they will
[58:05] likewise have the hardest job of
[58:08] receiving it themselves
[58:10] how many people do we know and it
[58:11] doesn't justify the people but how many
[58:13] people do we know that have walked away
[58:15] from truth because of hypocrisy
[58:18] and and then we hear about it and we're
[58:20] coming yeah well you know i guess i
[58:21] can't really blame you
[58:23] because there's been a lot of it
[58:25] then let's not be them let's not be the
[58:28] hypocrite this message is real it's true
[58:31] but i don't want to live some man's
[58:32] interpretation of it i don't want to
[58:34] live some fantastic idea of it i just
[58:36] want to be subject to the christ that it
[58:39] reveals and live it in the spirit that
[58:41] it was given and there let the leaven be
[58:44] removed from it let the hypocrisy be
[58:46] taken from it
[58:48] for ruler harkens the lies of servants
[58:50] are wicked it corrupts
[58:53] so i'll tell you a story that brother
[58:54] branham tells in his honesty
[58:57] and it's those
[58:58] lawyers that did it to him
[59:01] and he was going through that lawsuit
[59:03] that
[59:03] thing with the irs the message total
[59:05] deliverance i'll just read it to you
[59:07] he says i know that i did wrong i lied
[59:10] caused my wife to lie
[59:13] now this is where really
[59:15] god's prophets make no mistakes
[59:18] so how are we going to get past this
[59:20] right
[59:21] well
[59:21] he said he was wrong but he wasn't so he
[59:23] was wrong well no
[59:25] no
[59:27] he's just
[59:29] okay
[59:30] all right i know that i did wrong i lied
[59:31] because my wife caused my wife to lie
[59:36] there it is i lied and caused my wife to
[59:38] lie i believe i told you about it here
[59:39] at the church is a few days not long ago
[59:41] it's been about six weeks ago the
[59:42] attorneys
[59:44] had me so tore up over this
[59:45] investigation till i hardly knew where i
[59:48] was at
[59:49] i just went home from the office to eat
[59:50] dinner and the private phone number rang
[59:51] and meeta went to answer the phone
[59:54] she put a hand over it and said now
[59:55] let's just think about this all right
[59:57] think of how small this would be to us
[1:00:01] we wouldn't have a problem
[1:00:03] with something like this
[1:00:04] it's them attorneys again
[1:00:07] i said i couldn't stand it another
[1:00:09] evening
[1:00:10] my head feels like it's going to go
[1:00:13] i'm losing my mind
[1:00:16] just pulling me this way and that way
[1:00:18] and this way i can't stand it
[1:00:20] and i jumped up
[1:00:22] and i said tell them i'm not in here
[1:00:26] and run around behind the house
[1:00:29] now you know how you know how i know a
[1:00:31] lawyer caused this
[1:00:34] that's a very loyal way to handle that
[1:00:36] right
[1:00:37] technically
[1:00:40] i wasn't in the house i had run around
[1:00:42] back
[1:00:44] i tell the kids sometimes on our way
[1:00:45] home i say hey let's run by mcdonald's
[1:00:46] real fast
[1:00:48] and they're like yes nuggets right
[1:00:50] and so we get close to mcdonald's and
[1:00:52] let's go
[1:00:53] and we go by real fast
[1:00:58] and like wait a minute i thought we were
[1:01:00] going to freddie's
[1:01:01] yeah we went by it real fast
[1:01:05] so he says i tell them
[1:01:07] i'm not here and run behind the house he
[1:01:10] says when i came back
[1:01:12] and i want you to catch this too meat is
[1:01:14] very conscious of those things
[1:01:17] so god gave brother branham
[1:01:20] a wife who was sensitive
[1:01:23] who's conscientious a compliment to him
[1:01:25] in his ministry she met me at the door
[1:01:27] half crying and said bill was that the
[1:01:29] right thing to do you know how you are i
[1:01:31] know how i am i said sure i wasn't in
[1:01:34] here right then
[1:01:36] i knew god had condemned me for it
[1:01:38] i said i wasn't in here right then she
[1:01:40] said but you was in here when he made
[1:01:42] the call
[1:01:45] that afternoon i went to pray for sick
[1:01:46] baby before i left the house the phone
[1:01:48] rang again
[1:01:50] and little joseph run over
[1:01:52] took a hold of the phone
[1:01:54] and hold it there by john and said
[1:01:56] no we'll go back oh we ruined it oh well
[1:01:59] sorry
[1:02:03] all right well let's just start all over
[1:02:06] i went an hour and fifteen no john it's
[1:02:09] okay
[1:02:10] but what do you think joseph said
[1:02:14] what did he say he said joseph gets you
[1:02:17] the next slide joseph says daddy you
[1:02:19] want me to tell them you're not here
[1:02:22] probably didn't even have enough
[1:02:24] respect to cover it up and whisper it
[1:02:27] dad it's those lawyers again
[1:02:30] you want to run around the house
[1:02:33] right
[1:02:35] the lawyers are like what
[1:02:37] tell him to run around as much as he
[1:02:38] wants we're building them by the hour by
[1:02:40] the minute
[1:02:42] oh daddy you want me to tell them you're
[1:02:44] not here and this is brother brown's
[1:02:45] words
[1:02:46] you see how sin corrupts
[1:02:49] what honesty of a of a father to take
[1:02:52] the responsibility himself
[1:02:54] you see how sin corrupts
[1:02:57] what a family that would finally be
[1:03:00] he's asking the question what kind of
[1:03:02] family
[1:03:03] would my family ultimately be
[1:03:06] if that's the kind of example that i set
[1:03:09] and i'm never able to say
[1:03:11] i'm sorry son
[1:03:13] that was wrong
[1:03:15] wow
[1:03:16] yes sir
[1:03:17] so it's not that there's even a loss a
[1:03:19] brother man blind it's the end of
[1:03:20] everything he's lost confidence no it
[1:03:22] gave him an opportunity to have the
[1:03:23] right emphasis by example and say i was
[1:03:26] wrong
[1:03:27] i should have never done that
[1:03:28] trick but recognize how brother branham
[1:03:31] is drawing from a scriptural principle
[1:03:33] that if he resorts to lies
[1:03:35] it'll corrupt his family
[1:03:39] it's our emphasis by example yes sir
[1:03:42] god bless you this evening
[1:03:44] could we bow our heads in prayer
[1:03:51] i want you just to be very sober as we
[1:03:53] close it's 8 45 i've been too lengthy

[1:04:08] and lord we say
[1:04:09] forgive us father
[1:04:12] if our example hasn't been right lord
[1:04:16] let us have the humility as the prophet
[1:04:19] did just recognize
[1:04:22] that the corruption that i see in my
[1:04:24] home i take responsibility forward
[1:04:27] and i do not do it despairing lord i do
[1:04:30] not do it fretting and anxious and
[1:04:32] fearful i do it knowing
[1:04:35] that if it came by me
[1:04:37] it's going to leave by me
[1:04:39] that i'll sanctify myself lord
[1:04:42] i'll do it lord i'll do it for my
[1:04:44] children's sake amen
[1:04:46] lord as we had labored for
[1:04:49] part of the day in preparation to
[1:04:51] emphasize more

[1:05:33] a warfare within laodicea that buffets
[1:05:36] our minds
[1:05:38] and it
[1:05:39] it's so combative lord in the world and

[1:06:32] on monday circumstances just turned a
[1:06:35] little bit we didn't have a part way to
[1:06:36] share it but lord i wanted to share some
[1:06:38] of these very principles to them how
[1:06:40] they in themselves are reflecting to one
[1:06:44] another
[1:06:45] what's right
[1:06:47] in forming a basis of judgment and
[1:06:49] discernment for when they go out into
[1:06:50] the world
[1:06:52] and lord if we as young men don't treat
[1:06:54] these young ladies right they're not
