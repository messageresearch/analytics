[0:00] I don't know if there's anybody here
[0:01] tonight that wasn't here this morning
[0:03] but just to refresh our thoughts you
[0:05] know we we this morning went through the
[0:09] scriptures and and in particular the
[0:11] things that brother brandham said in the
[0:13] fifth seal pertaining to the four
[0:14] anointings Around The Throne the lion
[0:16] the ox the man and the eagle and how
[0:19] that they are sent with a specific
[0:21] purpose into the church and brother
[0:23] brandom specifically laid out that the
[0:25] church could only operate under the
[0:28] power that was sent into the church as
[0:30] Jesus said in Acts 1 and: 8 and you
[0:33] shall receive power after the Holy Ghost
[0:37] is come upon you he was telling the
[0:39] disciples so Terry in Jerusalem and and
[0:41] you'll receive the Holy Ghost and you'll
[0:43] receive power and so when the Holy Ghost
[0:46] comes and gives a person a new birth
[0:47] they are birthed with an with a view
[0:49] from God that they will be Anointed with
[0:52] power dependent upon the age they are
[0:54] birthed in in the beginning age it was
[0:56] the lion anointing that was upon the
[0:58] church and they acted as certain way but
[1:00] when it changed from The Lion to Ox the
[1:03] actions of the believer changed though
[1:05] the Holy Ghost was the same the new
[1:08] birth is always the same it's the power
[1:10] of the Resurrection in the believer that
[1:13] has quickened them that though they go
[1:15] into the grave yet they shall rise again
[1:17] in the resurrection and that we believe
[1:20] and know with all our hearts otherwise
[1:21] how are they going to resurrect they
[1:23] can't get the Holy Ghost after they're
[1:24] gone on we've been in as brother brandom
[1:27] likened it to the Old Testament Feast
[1:29] we've been in the Feast of Pentecost
[1:31] through seven Church ages we're coming
[1:33] now right up to the last Feast which is
[1:36] the Feast of Tabernacles and then we can
[1:38] talk which is a change of dwelling place
[1:41] and then we could talk about the Feast
[1:43] of atonement which goes to the Jews
[1:45] which is a recognizing of their
[1:47] atonement to which they are called by
[1:50] the Feast of the trumpets and it's the
[1:52] trumpets that call the Jews to the Feast
[1:54] of atonement and the atonement is not a
[1:56] new atonement the atonement is a
[1:58] recognizing of the the atonement that
[2:00] was already given to them so in the
[2:02] tribulation time when the two witnesses
[2:04] come to the Jews the Jews will realize
[2:08] that the Messiah that they're looking
[2:09] for in the future already came 2,000
[2:12] years ago and Moses and Elijah will
[2:15] reveal that to them but as I've often
[2:17] said this message is not their message
[2:20] this message is a bride's message they
[2:22] are not the bride they the 144,000 are
[2:26] the Brethren a type of Benjamin in the
[2:28] Old Testament and and so they are to be
[2:30] called under a new ministry of Moses and
[2:34] Elijah and a message that is particular
[2:36] to them though the atonement is the same
[2:39] we preach the same Christ that Luther
[2:42] preached we preach the same Christ that
[2:44] Wesley preached we preached the same
[2:47] Christ that the Pentecostal preach but
[2:49] it's a different message or it's a
[2:51] revealing of Christ for the age that
[2:54] we're living in as we said this morning
[2:56] Abraham saw the same Christ in the form
[2:59] of me ISC he saw him on the plains of
[3:01] mammory Eli Ezekiel saw him as a wheel
[3:04] in the middle of the wheel Daniel saw
[3:05] him as the Ancient of Days and we could
[3:07] go down through the the Old Testament
[3:10] and the different prophetic messages
[3:12] throughout the Old Testament it was the
[3:14] same individual but God changed his mask
[3:18] and so as he revealed himself in
[3:20] different seasons to different
[3:21] individuals we are thankful to live in
[3:23] the hour that we are living in under the
[3:26] anointing for this day the eagle
[3:28] anointing bringing us into the
[3:30] revelation of the day that we're living
[3:32] in Revelation of the day that we're
[3:35] living in what is revelation it's
[3:38] Faith what is the Revelation for this
[3:41] day it's a
[3:42] Rapture it's more it's and a Rapture is
[3:45] not just a catching away a catching away
[3:48] is part of the Rapture that's why
[3:51] brother brandham even said about the
[3:52] resurrection we're already in a
[3:54] resurrection we've been resurrected from
[3:56] dark denominationalism we've been
[3:58] resurrected from Creeds and dogmas we've
[4:00] been resurrected from Death spiritually
[4:03] speaking and we've been brought into the
[4:05] life of Jesus Christ we're waiting for
[4:07] our bodies to catch up with that and one
[4:10] day we'll be changed in the moment in
[4:12] the twinking of an
[4:13] eye so each power the lion the ox the
[4:16] man and the eagle that is sent into the
[4:19] church under each every Son of God comes
[4:24] to the new birth and is Anointed by the
[4:26] power that is upon the church for their
[4:28] age and I quoted this morning from
[4:30] Brother Bram that's the only way the
[4:32] church can operate is the power that is
[4:35] sent into the church you can only
[4:37] operate under that so now in the message
[4:40] what shall I do with Jesus called the
[4:42] Christ brother brandham says in 1963 he
[4:44] says when the reformers age went out the
[4:47] Beast with the face like a man now
[4:50] remember that's Luther Wesley Pentecost
[4:53] he says but this or sorry he says faith
[4:56] like a man he says organization ensued
[4:59] yeah after the man anointing he says but
[5:02] this is the face of the eagle the Beast
[5:06] that went to make the challenge of
[5:10] today amen and then he says who would D
[5:13] dare to say that wasn't the inspired
[5:15] word of God when he foretold it here and
[5:18] sent out yonder he says to Arizona
[5:22] praise the Lord we're in a good place to
[5:26] Arizona and brought it right back even
[5:29] with the science and everything else and
[5:30] proved it so what was he talking about
[5:32] he was talking about the cloud he was
[5:34] talking about the angels that met him
[5:35] out here in Arizona and said go back to
[5:38] Jeffersonville and the Seven Seals will
[5:40] be open brother brandham did not open
[5:42] the Seven
[5:43] Seals the lamb opened the Seven Seals
[5:46] there was only one worthy to open the
[5:48] book but if God didn't have a prophet
[5:51] that is to say eyes to see we would not
[5:54] even know the lamb had opened the seals
[5:57] so it took a prophet being upon the
[5:59] Earth so that the church could see that
[6:01] God had turned a corner amen so under
[6:06] the man anointing restoration happened
[6:09] uh Reformation happened justification
[6:12] sanctification gifts of the Spirit but
[6:14] now the final challenge is
[6:17] here the final challenge to walk in
[6:21] perfect faith of who you are very good
[6:25] am very good this is what is to come in
[6:27] the last days because when you walk in
[6:29] perfect faith brother Braham says that's
[6:32] rapturing condition he says that's bride
[6:37] materialen all right and those are the
[6:41] keys of what we want to speak on tonight
[6:45] now it's the perfect faith in what the
[6:48] word says you are all right the word
[6:52] hasn't
[6:53] changed the word is
[6:55] eternal we so we know now that Isaiah
[6:59] spoke about Jesus hundreds of years
[7:02] before he was born and he said and it
[7:04] says in 9 and6 it says unto us a child
[7:07] is born unto us a son is given and the
[7:10] government shall be upon his shoulder
[7:12] and his name Shall be Called wonderful
[7:14] counselor the Mighty God the Everlasting
[7:18] father the Prince of Peace that's who
[7:21] Jesus was that's what the scriptures
[7:23] spoke about him but who are
[7:26] you you know like the the sons of SK
[7:29] that went to cast out demons and they
[7:32] they didn't know who they were they said
[7:35] we adure you by the Christ that Paul
[7:39] teaches right and the demons answered
[7:42] back and says well Jesus we know and
[7:45] Paul we know but who are
[7:48] you amen they had no power because they
[7:52] didn't know who they were they were
[7:54] identified with the Jesus of Paul you
[7:57] know we you it's not good enough to
[7:58] identify ify with a Jesus that was born
[8:01] in a manger it's not good enough to
[8:03] identify with a Jesus that hung on a
[8:05] cross it's not the Jesus of 2,000 years
[8:08] ago that was the manifestation of Christ
[8:11] in that day but we are in another day
[8:13] he's the same yesterday today and
[8:15] forever he's alive today as he was alive
[8:18] yesterday and he's making himself known
[8:20] today and as I quoted this morning it
[8:22] was the word made flesh by the
[8:24] bridegroom then and it's the word made
[8:27] flesh in Bride form now
[8:29] amen so we've come to a time that God is
[8:32] calling his church to perfect faith in a
[8:35] perfect word which is rapturing Faith
[8:38] we've been called back to the fullness
[8:40] of the word the revealing of all the
[8:42] mystery of God we quote the quote in the
[8:44] days of the voice of the seventh angel
[8:46] when he shall begin to sound all the
[8:48] mystery of God would be finished as he
[8:50] has declared to his servants the
[8:52] prophets amen we believe that is it
[8:55] finished
[8:57] yes how did get quiet in
[9:01] here is the mystery finished amen the
[9:04] mystery is finished the the seals have
[9:06] been revealed the cover has been taken
[9:08] off the the word of God has been
[9:11] revealed but the question is not has it
[9:13] been revealed generally that the opening
[9:16] of the seals ushered in the end time it
[9:19] was the opening of the seals that
[9:20] signified that we are in the end time as
[9:23] Jesus said at that day you shall know
[9:26] that I am in the Father the father and
[9:28] me I in you and you and me and so
[9:30] there's a declaration of knowledge of of
[9:33] Revelation that shall be released what
[9:36] is that Revelation the revelation of
[9:38] your position in Christ the revelation
[9:41] of who you are in God's thoughts so then
[9:44] it has to be the revealing of God's
[9:46] thoughts and the and the opening of that
[9:49] Revelation that will bring you to a
[9:51] level of uh I'll just say it this way a
[9:55] level of
[9:56] fearlessness that you know who you are
[9:59] in God for if you know who you are when
[10:02] the bride knows who she is then the
[10:04] Rapture will take place the devil
[10:06] doesn't stand a chance against this
[10:08] bride that comes to the revelation of
[10:11] who she is there's no other evidences
[10:13] spoken of this age
[10:15] right you know there there's no other
[10:18] thing spoken of well you need this or
[10:20] you need that no it's God's word
[10:23] revealed you believe what God has spoken
[10:27] to you brother bom says in Easter seal
[10:32] Jesus was so full of the quickening
[10:34] power he says if you can destroy this
[10:36] Temple that took 40 years you thought to
[10:40] build I'll raise it up in three days he
[10:43] he says why could Jesus say that why
[10:46] could Jesus say such a thing because he
[10:49] knew every word that God wrote of him
[10:51] he'd fulfill
[10:52] it and so is it in every word that God
[10:55] spoke of you you must fulfill it you
[10:59] will fulfill it it's not you it's him
[11:03] and it's just your faith in what he
[11:05] spoke of you so brother random goes on
[11:07] in the same quote and says do you know
[11:09] you're the one the Bible speaks of do
[11:12] you know your position is in Christ if
[11:15] you're in Christ you're a new creature
[11:17] do you know this word is just like
[11:19] everyday living to you why sure it's
[11:22] yours you are an eagle yes that's your
[11:27] food all right let me just refer to some
[11:30] things that brother brandham says in the
[11:31] message perfect Faith now in the message
[11:33] perfect Faith as you have read that or
[11:37] listen to that message I'm sure uh if
[11:39] you've been a Believer for any length of
[11:41] time if you haven't uh you know I would
[11:43] encourage you to go back and study it
[11:44] you know there's many um things that
[11:47] brother Branham speaks about the eagle
[11:49] anointing and and in this message
[11:51] perfect faith brother brandham what he
[11:53] is doing it's a very striking message
[11:56] because he he's preaching something that
[11:59] the people need to catch and one of the
[12:01] things that he says in there and I have
[12:04] it here he says I I'll see just how
[12:07] advanced my church is in what we
[12:11] believe so he's testing the faith of the
[12:13] church he's testing the revelation of
[12:16] the people and the same message it's
[12:18] interesting of course because it's the
[12:20] same message he says if you had perfect
[12:22] Faith you wouldn't need a prayer line
[12:24] and then he has a prayer
[12:27] line all right what is he doing he's
[12:29] testing the faith of the people all
[12:32] right he's seeing if the people have
[12:34] come up to where this message is to take
[12:37] us to and as I said this morning that's
[12:39] why in The Seven Seals he couldn't show
[12:42] what the eagle anointing has done
[12:44] because the eagle anointing just came in
[12:47] the opening of the seals he could talk
[12:49] about the lion anointing the man
[12:51] anointing the ox anointing in a
[12:53] historical context but there was no
[12:55] historical context for the eagle
[12:57] anointing because it was all from then
[13:00] forward and everything that he was going
[13:02] to preach from then on was going to be
[13:04] the eagle anointing the Bible had become
[13:06] a new book to him he was seeing it from
[13:08] a different perspective as I said the
[13:10] eagle rises above and sees the same
[13:13] thing that the Li and the ox and the man
[13:16] see but sees it from on high not looking
[13:19] at it from an Earthly
[13:21] perspective all right so let's just look
[13:23] at a few of the things that brother
[13:24] brandham says I had this in slides but I
[13:26] thought we'll just skip the slides
[13:28] tonight and and just uh I'll just quotee
[13:30] them for you this is from the message
[13:32] perfect Faith he says now remember he's
[13:35] talking about the disciples they had the
[13:37] power Jesus had given them power to heal
[13:40] the sick to raise the dead to cast out
[13:42] Devils just a few days before that they
[13:46] had the power but not the faith to use
[13:49] the
[13:50] power remember I said this morning if
[13:52] you've got the Holy Ghost in you brother
[13:54] Brown says you've got enough power in
[13:56] you to speak worlds into existence and
[13:59] go and live on them all right that's how
[14:01] much power is in every holy ghost Born
[14:04] Again believer but he says it's governed
[14:07] by a law and the law is Faith and Jesus
[14:10] now given the disciples power to cast
[14:12] out Devils heal the sick raise the Dead
[14:13] all of that he gave them the power they
[14:16] had the power but they didn't have faith
[14:18] to use the power what was it Jesus had
[14:22] had uh uh they had come to this man
[14:24] whose boy was an epileptic and they they
[14:26] uh uh they tried to cast out the devil
[14:29] and the father could they couldn't do it
[14:31] and the father Jesus came by their way
[14:33] and the father cried out to Jesus Lord
[14:35] help my son if you can and Jesus says I
[14:38] can if you
[14:40] believe and and it's interesting because
[14:43] now remember the angel of the Lord told
[14:46] Brother Bram said if you can get the
[14:49] people to believe you nothing will stand
[14:52] at your prayer not even cancer he didn't
[14:56] say if you can get the people to rep
[14:59] repent he didn't say if you can get the
[15:02] people baptized yeah he didn't say if
[15:04] you can get the people to shout or if
[15:07] you can get the people to speak in
[15:08] tongues or or whatever more
[15:10] manifestation you want he says if you
[15:12] can get the people to believe you
[15:15] nothing will stand at your prayers not
[15:17] even cancer so now Jesus says to this
[15:20] man he says I can if you believe and the
[15:22] man's response is Lord I believe help
[15:24] thou my unbelief is how the King James
[15:26] interprets it but really the meaning in
[15:28] the Greek is Lord I believe help thou my
[15:32] lack of
[15:33] faith so I believe with all the faith
[15:36] that I have but my problem is I don't
[15:38] have faith because what is faith faith
[15:40] is a revelation how does faith come
[15:42] faith comes by hearing the word amen if
[15:45] you're not feeding on the word you're
[15:46] not going to get
[15:47] Faith because faith is a revelation that
[15:50] only comes to you by you receiving the
[15:52] word of God all right now so he said
[15:55] they they they had the power but they
[15:58] didn't not have the faith to use the
[16:00] power and then he says now there's the
[16:03] Bram
[16:04] Tabernacle there's the church the bride
[16:08] today so what is the church the bride
[16:10] today she has the power but she doesn't
[16:14] have the faith to use the power every
[16:16] sickness in this room is
[16:20] defeated every problem has a promise to
[16:23] overcome it every lost loved one is
[16:27] yours
[16:29] if you can believe you've got the power
[16:33] but the problem isn't the power the
[16:34] power is in the church if if if there's
[16:37] one Holy Ghost filled believer and I
[16:39] believe there's many more than that in
[16:41] this room if but if if there's just one
[16:43] even if it's just the pastor there's a
[16:45] power to create another Universe the
[16:47] same power that created this universe is
[16:49] in everybody that has the Holy Ghost
[16:51] it's the same God it's the infinite God
[16:53] who's infinite in all power and the only
[16:56] thing that holds it back is a lack of
[16:57] Revelation and that's why in the last
[17:00] days there will come a perfect
[17:01] Revelation an opening of the book A
[17:03] revealing of the word of God to loose
[17:06] the power in the church it's not actions
[17:10] it's not some f physical manifestation
[17:12] there will be all kinds of physical
[17:14] manifestation but it's not those things
[17:16] that loses the power it's only and I
[17:18] want to reiterate this tonight it's only
[17:20] Revelation that loses the power in The
[17:23] Believer there's no other way for the
[17:26] power to be
[17:27] loosed
[17:29] he says that's the church that's the
[17:31] bride today he says the holy spirit is
[17:33] here with the power but you haven't got
[17:36] that Faith to move it see what I mean it
[17:39] takes Faith to move it so you see these
[17:42] aren't my thoughts these are God's
[17:44] prophets thoughts all right a little bit
[17:46] later in the me same message perfect
[17:48] Faith he said Jesus had faith in the
[17:49] word of God that said what he was it is
[17:53] written of me didn't David and the
[17:54] Psalms and the prophets and all of them
[17:56] speak of him I am the bread of life life
[17:58] that came down from God out of Heaven I
[18:00] am the Tree of Life In the Garden of
[18:02] Eden I am all these things I am that I
[18:05] am and he knew with that a perfect faith
[18:08] that he was the anointed Messiah and the
[18:12] spirit of God was upon him and he said
[18:14] now I myself do nothing but it's my
[18:17] faith in God and God was in him and the
[18:21] word made God was in him the word made
[18:24] manifest and when the word of God comes
[18:27] in you
[18:29] it's made manifest for you are a
[18:33] Believer and a Believer is the faith of
[18:37] God that moves in
[18:39] you that's what you are a Believer is
[18:42] not just well I'm Tim do and I believe
[18:45] this message is true as I said to the
[18:47] church at home you know there's really
[18:49] two kinds of Believers in the message
[18:50] that we know there's three kinds of
[18:52] Believers generally but there's two
[18:53] kinds of Believers in the message I said
[18:56] that that one of them believes the
[18:58] message is true and one of them believes
[19:01] the
[19:04] message I'll let that one sink in a
[19:06] little bit which one are you do you just
[19:10] believe that it's true or is it made
[19:12] real to
[19:13] you do you believe that this is God's
[19:16] anointed word for this age to loose the
[19:19] power of the Holy Ghost that has been in
[19:22] the church through seven Church ages in
[19:24] every individual that was born again
[19:27] right down to this last days I reject
[19:29] that somebody says the new birth was
[19:31] different in another age than it is
[19:33] today it's no different it's the same
[19:36] Holy Ghost you can't make God different
[19:39] either they had the Holy Spirit which is
[19:41] God which is divine love or they had
[19:44] nothing right true and if they had
[19:48] nothing they won't be in the
[19:49] resurrection right but the Holy Ghost is
[19:52] the same in every age and the difference
[19:55] is the Revelation to the age or the
[19:57] anointing inin in that is set upon the
[19:59] word for that
[20:01] age amen so now remember it's the
[20:04] Revelation not the emotion it's the
[20:07] Revelation not the memory it's the
[20:09] Revelation not the
[20:10] imagination it's the it's the Revelation
[20:13] not the reasoning all right it's the
[20:15] Revelation and God is a sovereign Giver
[20:18] of Revelation he didn't reveal to any
[20:21] other age what the Rapture really was
[20:23] that was held for this age because this
[20:26] is the age that needs it I asked
[20:27] somebody asked me one time I have 10
[20:29] children I'll let you just get back to
[20:32] your seats now
[20:34] and uh I I tell the brothers I did my
[20:37] part and you know I I keep the tax base
[20:42] of the country you know with a we don't
[20:46] if it was up to me we wouldn't need no
[20:50] immigration all right and uh that's just
[20:53] the way it goes but nevertheless I I I
[20:55] had a sister come up to me one time and
[20:57] say brother Tim I can't
[20:59] imagine I I I have no idea what it would
[21:03] take to raise 10 children and I said to
[21:06] her says how many children do you have
[21:07] she says I have I think it was three
[21:09] children you have three children well
[21:11] let me tell you sister because you only
[21:13] have three children God will never
[21:15] reveal to you how to raise 10
[21:19] children it's not for
[21:23] you but it's for
[21:25] me that's my revelation
[21:29] so everybody God reveals himself to you
[21:33] sovereignly and if you're the Bride of
[21:35] Jesus Christ for the last days part of
[21:38] your Revelation is a Rapture Revelation
[21:41] it's a revealing of who you are all
[21:43] right and so all we find this all down
[21:46] through yourself let me read a little
[21:48] bit more out the perfect faith is this
[21:49] all right all right brother Brown says
[21:52] Jesus lived in a world that no one
[21:53] knowed about he was an odd person he
[21:57] lived in the world of perfect faith in
[21:59] the perfect God in which he was if we
[22:02] lived in a perfect faith of a Christian
[22:04] to what we are we'd be a Mystic to the
[22:06] world the people wouldn't understand you
[22:09] you you see when you've when you're born
[22:11] again by the spirit of God and you walk
[22:13] by Perfect faith in the word of God
[22:14] you're not walking according to this
[22:16] world's
[22:17] rules the world the medical science of
[22:21] the world will tell you you're going to
[22:23] die but the word of God Says by his
[22:25] stripes I'm
[22:26] Healed it's just simple if that's made
[22:29] real to you it doesn't matter what the
[22:30] doctor says you you can find yourself in
[22:33] a financial we would call it maybe a
[22:36] financial pickle I don't know if you'd
[22:37] say that down here but you know in a
[22:39] situation where everything's all messed
[22:41] up and I don't know how it's going to
[22:42] work out but when you look to the God
[22:44] who owns all things the cattle on a
[22:48] thousand hills your provider he's
[22:50] Jehovah Gyra then you can look to him
[22:52] and say it doesn't matter what my
[22:53] finances look like God is a provider I'm
[22:56] going to make it through this amen he's
[22:59] my deliverer he's my healer he's my
[23:01] peace he's my joy he's my comfort can
[23:03] you say Amen to all those things it's
[23:05] not according to the science of this
[23:07] world that's why we don't need
[23:09] Psychology praise the Lord what we need
[23:13] is a walk with the Lord Jesus
[23:15] Christ praise the Lord that we have that
[23:17] so Jesus lived in a perfect faith in
[23:20] what the word said he was and he says
[23:22] the brother Ram says if you did that the
[23:24] people wouldn't understand you you'd
[23:25] walk in the spirit what the spirit said
[23:27] you would do what it forbid you'd not do
[23:30] that's the way it is to all believers
[23:32] they're Mystics the people don't
[23:35] understand because they live in a world
[23:37] to themselves amen you see you cannot we
[23:42] cannot understand each other
[23:44] carnally you know we might have some
[23:46] things in common say one brother loves
[23:49] fishing another brother loves fishing
[23:50] but another brother might love hunting
[23:52] and another brother like might like cars
[23:55] you know and and you know uh
[23:58] working on cars and another brother
[24:00] might like carpentry and another brother
[24:03] might like farming and and all of those
[24:05] things and and you know and all of the
[24:07] brothers cannot understand the
[24:13] sisters Naturally Speaking you know we
[24:16] don't understand what makes them tick
[24:18] but we sure glad they're
[24:20] around right and so there's there's that
[24:24] this relationship we have and God made
[24:26] us that way cuz God took the the
[24:29] feminine out of the
[24:30] masculine right and he put the feminine
[24:33] in the woman and the masculine in the
[24:35] man and it don't change right you can't
[24:39] decide you're one or the other God makes
[24:41] you what you are all right and so as the
[24:44] result of that we realize that there's
[24:47] some things that a woman can do and
[24:49] understand that a man cannot and vice
[24:51] versa but when we become spiritually in
[24:54] Christ then we realize I have a position
[24:57] in Christ and if I understand who I am
[25:00] and she understands who she is then we
[25:03] can certainly find a place together to
[25:06] become one I'm talking about husband and
[25:07] wife in Jesus Christ amen so that that's
[25:11] a reality that can only happen that's
[25:13] why true marriage can only be understood
[25:15] in Jesus Christ the world tries marriage
[25:17] and God bless him that's the law of the
[25:19] land and uh uh that's uh something
[25:22] that's hard to preach on because of
[25:24] really marriage is for the elect of God
[25:27] the relation the true relationship
[25:29] between a husband and wife is for the
[25:30] elect of God the rest of them out there
[25:33] it really wasn't for them it was for
[25:36] Adam and Eve in the beginning the Son
[25:38] and the daughter of God and it's for you
[25:40] and you're the only ones that can really
[25:42] understand what marriage is about praise
[25:44] the Lord I this is not at all in my
[25:47] notes and and if you want me to leave
[25:50] brother Aaron you just say so all
[25:53] right all right amen so now he says
[25:57] going on in perfect
[26:00] Faith oh let me just finish that thought
[26:04] because that's how I went down that road
[26:06] now I realize what got me
[26:09] there we cannot understand each other
[26:12] naturally it has to be spiritually now
[26:15] you cannot understand brother brandom by
[26:17] theology
[26:19] right you cannot even understand why he
[26:22] said things in a lot of ways that that
[26:25] because it's divinely or orchestrated by
[26:28] God and it
[26:31] works now you want me to explain it and
[26:34] put it in a textbook I can't do it
[26:37] nobody can do it but when it's quickened
[26:40] to you that this is Christ revealed in
[26:43] our day then it becomes a living reality
[26:47] to give faith in you which is faith in
[26:51] this word alone
[26:53] amen all right so brother Ram says so
[26:56] when a man lives by faith walks by faith
[26:58] I mean substance Faith he is isolated
[27:00] from the entire world and becomes a new
[27:02] creature in Christ there now you're
[27:05] getting into bride material see you're
[27:08] getting into rapturing condition now
[27:11] that means for each one of us not just
[27:13] the pastor the deacons trustees that
[27:16] means for the leoty every individual
[27:19] walks in a world with God alone right
[27:21] and the church said amen amen that's all
[27:24] of us it's an individual relationship
[27:26] God is Not interested in the pastor
[27:28] holding your hand in your relationship
[27:30] with Jesus Christ the pastor has a very
[27:33] specific office to instruct the church
[27:35] to Shepherd over the church but it's not
[27:37] him that is United to you it is the word
[27:40] that is United to you all right he so he
[27:44] goes on he says you're baptized into the
[27:45] kingdom and there's nobody in there but
[27:48] you and God he gives the orders you pack
[27:50] them out whatever he says there's not a
[27:52] shadow of a doubt nowhere you walk right
[27:54] on in other words what he's saying is if
[27:57] you don't know this relationship God
[27:59] wants to have this relationship with you
[28:02] the Lord wants you to know him and him
[28:05] to know you in that intimate kind of
[28:07] relationship that's one-on-one with God
[28:09] Alone he wants to speak to you if you've
[28:11] never had God to speak to you there's
[28:13] more for
[28:14] you that's all I'm not here to say
[28:16] you're an unbeliever I'm here to say you
[28:18] haven't realized your full potentials
[28:23] yet if the Lord says this there's nobody
[28:25] in the world can talk you out of it you
[28:27] go right on just the same now you're
[28:30] coming into perfect Faith perfect
[28:33] Perfection that cannot fail that faith
[28:38] never
[28:40] fails amen that faith never
[28:44] fails it can't miss the
[28:47] mark it is the very sovereignly given
[28:52] Revelation to you personally that looses
[28:56] the power of God God in your
[28:58] life it is that simple oh how do I get
[29:02] there brother Tim repent and be baptized
[29:05] in the name of Jesus
[29:07] Christ and you shall receive the gift of
[29:09] the Holy Ghost which means God puts a
[29:12] part of himself inside of you in the
[29:14] book of Acts it's it's referred to as
[29:15] liix ofier that appeared over every one
[29:18] of them it was identifying that was a
[29:21] pie of the great Pillar of Fire that was
[29:23] coming to them individually and that's
[29:26] what the New Testament does in the Old
[29:28] Testament it was God in the great Pillar
[29:30] of Fire in the New Testament it's God in
[29:33] you amen God coming down into the
[29:37] individual by the baptism of the Holy
[29:39] Ghost to change your nature and put put
[29:41] it into the nature that you are meant to
[29:43] be which is a very attribute of God a a
[29:49] uh a very son or daughter of God in the
[29:52] very nature of it you don't have to
[29:56] teach children to be
[30:01] human it's in their
[30:04] DNA you do have to teach them what
[30:07] humans are supposed to act
[30:11] like
[30:13] amen we we understand those
[30:16] things but you ever think about
[30:19] why because we've come to a level of
[30:22] revelation as a human being that we
[30:26] don't tell lies
[30:29] we don't steal we don't beat up on our
[30:31] little brother or sister you got to talk
[30:33] to your children now brother Aon all
[30:36] right or we don't beat up on our big
[30:38] brother all right if we say that way you
[30:42] know these are things that we try and
[30:44] teach instill in our children well
[30:46] that's why the Bible says every son that
[30:48] comes to God must be
[30:51] chastised you are a son of God you're
[30:53] birthed into the kingdom of God now
[30:56] God's in the business of molding our
[30:58] character because our place is not to be
[31:01] slaves our place is to sit with him in
[31:04] the
[31:04] throne and he's birthed us into the
[31:07] kingdom to take us there know ye not
[31:09] that the Saints shall judge the world so
[31:12] you're in a process here and that God is
[31:14] molding your life through the revelation
[31:16] of the world word and the trials that
[31:18] he's taking you through to put you in a
[31:20] position of character so that he can
[31:23] release Revelation which will release
[31:25] the power of God within your
[31:29] life all
[31:30] right so we we read from the Sixth Seal
[31:33] the the eagle anointing versus Satan's
[31:37] power which is death his name is death
[31:40] and Hell follows after
[31:43] him so there's a purpose in what God is
[31:48] doing that purpose is a Rapture but more
[31:52] than a Rapture that purpose is
[31:54] maturity the Redemptive purpose of God
[31:57] has come to
[31:58] maturity the anointing upon this hour is
[32:02] to bring the church to
[32:04] maturity let me let me let me drill down
[32:07] a little bit the anointing of this hour
[32:09] is to bring you to
[32:12] maturity
[32:14] individually oneon-one with God to be
[32:17] exactly what he saw in his thoughts of
[32:20] you before the foundation of the world
[32:24] now when we come to understanding an
[32:26] eagle there's reason it's called an
[32:28] eagle so let's look at some of the
[32:29] characteristics of the
[32:32] eagle the eagle one of the things that
[32:34] identifies the eagle is its
[32:37] focus the eagle has long range vision
[32:41] and the eagle does not get distracted
[32:44] from its purpose all right the eagle is
[32:48] something that is not distracted from
[32:51] things around it it has a vision to see
[32:54] things as we said this morning it rises
[32:56] up on its wings uh it is called to rise
[33:00] on its wings but it does not rise on its
[33:02] wings by its own
[33:04] power the eagle knows how to set its
[33:07] wings on the air currents that are
[33:10] around it and use those air currents to
[33:12] rise higher I I did a study years ago on
[33:15] the golden eagle which which often flies
[33:18] up and down the Rocky Mountains in the
[33:20] in the western North of North America
[33:22] and it uses the sun shining on the
[33:26] exposed rock of the mountains that
[33:28] creates updrafts to to so it'll fly to
[33:32] one place and it'll rise up on that
[33:34] updraft to a very high height and then
[33:37] it'll fly on to the next mountain and
[33:40] then use those updrafts to fly higher
[33:42] and then it'll fly the eagle the golden
[33:44] eagle is actually a migratory bird and
[33:46] sorry to you Americans that love the
[33:48] bald eagle but the golden eagle is
[33:50] actually a type of the Bride more than
[33:51] the bald
[33:54] eagle cuz this bride won't cut C her
[33:57] hair so she ain't
[34:01] bald all right and gold represents deity
[34:05] you want me to throw them all out there
[34:07] you know this isn't my subject tonight
[34:10] but the but the eagle has certain
[34:13] characteristics all right and it's able
[34:16] to create separation brother Brandon
[34:18] talks about how that he was in a storm
[34:20] and and when the storm blew in and the
[34:22] Lord told him to rebuke the storm and
[34:24] and uh uh how that in the after that
[34:27] storm he was walking through the forest
[34:29] and and he came across a chattering
[34:32] squirrel chatter chatter chatter chatter
[34:34] chatter chatter and he talked about all
[34:36] the different things that that
[34:37] represents but then he he thought that
[34:39] squirrel was chattering because of him
[34:42] and because he had kind of walked into
[34:43] that squirrel's territory but then he
[34:45] realized the squirrel wasn't even
[34:46] looking at him and so he looked at where
[34:49] is the squirrel looking and he saw it
[34:50] was looking at an eagle that had taken
[34:53] shelter in the storm and brother
[34:55] brandham had a gun and he he he he
[34:58] talked to the eagle he says you know I
[34:59] could shoot you he says the eagle didn't
[35:02] care he says I I could I could pull this
[35:06] gun faster and you the eagle he says
[35:08] didn't care uh about anything that
[35:10] brother Brandon was talking about he was
[35:12] getting annoyed by the chattering of the
[35:13] squirrel and he saw he was just testing
[35:16] his wings he was just getting ready to
[35:18] take off and he says before you could
[35:20] hardly bat an I says the the eagle just
[35:23] flopped his wings a couple times and
[35:26] then soar up into the Heavenly what was
[35:28] he doing he was creating distance
[35:31] between himself and the
[35:32] chatter there's a lot of chatter that's
[35:35] going on around us and we are anointed
[35:38] to create some separation between us and
[35:41] the world it's just part of the
[35:43] anointing that we're under in this hour
[35:46] and it's Revelation that creates that
[35:49] separation as The Sun Shines on the
[35:52] exposed rock and warms the ground to
[35:55] create an upcurrent for you
[35:57] you know get in the presence of the sun
[35:59] where the rock is being exposed where
[36:01] you can talk about Revelation and how
[36:04] that that's being revealed you get into
[36:06] the Revelation it's going to lift You
[36:07] Higher and lift You Higher and lift you
[36:10] higher until the things of the world
[36:12] don't bother you anymore you say brother
[36:14] Tim I have trouble with this part of the
[36:16] world or this Peri of my life this is
[36:17] where my weakness is you I hope we
[36:19] understand we're all weak human beings
[36:22] as I said this morning John Wesley said
[36:24] you're as likely to make mistakes as you
[36:26] are to breathe why because in these
[36:29] bodies we have to battle against the
[36:31] flesh all right the flesh Wars against
[36:34] the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit Wars
[36:36] against the flesh so there's a struggle
[36:38] that goes on the flesh wants to take you
[36:40] into things but the more Revelation the
[36:42] more of God you get in you the less room
[36:45] there is for the
[36:47] world just as I said say oh brother Tim
[36:49] I need Deliverance you can get
[36:50] deliverance from the world but if you
[36:52] don't get God in you the world will come
[36:55] flooding back in just get more of God
[36:59] it's a law of separation and I i' I've
[37:02] done this years ago I haven't done this
[37:03] for a while but I said it's like the
[37:05] world God hates the world he says the
[37:06] love of the world is enmity with God and
[37:10] so the the world is on one end of the
[37:12] spectrum and the and God is on the other
[37:15] and you cannot get closer to the world
[37:18] and closer to God at the same
[37:20] time if you get closer to God you're
[37:23] going to get further away from the world
[37:25] but if you get closer to the world
[37:28] you're going to get further away from
[37:29] God that's just the way it works it's
[37:31] simple I hope you you you like that
[37:34] simple example all
[37:39] right so brother Brown I'm talking about
[37:41] that squirrel then that storm he
[37:44] says he says uh the eagle has got
[37:47] perfect confidence in what God give him
[37:50] in those two wings to fly away from his
[37:54] enemy he didn't say fight his enemy
[37:57] he said just fly away he says then what
[38:00] ought a man to do that's born of the
[38:01] Holy Ghost when he feels the Holy Spirit
[38:03] around him and you know that you're in
[38:05] love with God what do you care what the
[38:08] devil
[38:10] says and how many threats he makes okay
[38:18] now we find in the Bible Eagles referred
[38:22] to in three ways number one God refers
[38:24] to himself as an eagle all all right
[38:26] Jehovah Eagle number two he Likens His
[38:30] prophets to
[38:31] Eagles okay and number three the last
[38:35] anointing the last power around the
[38:37] throne is an eagle anointing all right
[38:41] so it has a particular meaning to us and
[38:45] in order to see the eagle anointing
[38:48] let's look back on the anointings that
[38:50] were upon God's
[38:52] prophets and if we can see how God deals
[38:55] with His prophets we can s see a little
[38:57] more of how God wants to deal with us in
[39:00] the day we're living in under the
[39:02] anointing of this hour so we'll go to a
[39:06] prototypical prophet which is
[39:08] Elijah and Elijah was given a commission
[39:10] from God go and call Israel back to God
[39:14] and first of all he was to pronounce
[39:16] that there would be no rain because of
[39:17] the evil in Israel and for three and a
[39:20] half years there was a drought and there
[39:21] was no rain and then then Moses was or
[39:24] Moses Elijah was called To Go up to
[39:26] Mount Carmel and to bring the people
[39:28] back to God and and so uh he goes up on
[39:32] Mount Carmel he does exactly what God
[39:35] tells him to do now listen as he as he's
[39:38] up there on Mount Carmel as he's got the
[39:41] the word from the Lord and he knows
[39:43] exactly what he wants to do he says
[39:44] bring the prophets of Baal he says if
[39:46] Jehovah be God then serve him if Baal be
[39:50] God then serve him now that those words
[39:52] in the Hebrew means if Jehovah be Elohim
[39:55] then serve him him Elohim means the
[39:57] self-existing God but if ba be the
[40:00] self-existing god or Elohim then serve
[40:03] ba he says but Let The God Who Answers
[40:06] by fire let him be the one that is God
[40:11] all right so he so then he says to the
[40:13] prophets ba all right you do your
[40:14] religious ceremonies you you have do
[40:17] whatever you want to do and then at when
[40:19] you're all done he says if your God
[40:22] Answers by fire bail then we will serve
[40:24] him and if not when you're done then
[40:26] I'll take over and Jehovah will answer
[40:28] by fire so the prophets of Baal get up
[40:30] there and they're doing their
[40:31] enchantments they're dancing they're
[40:32] making a lot of noise they're shouting
[40:34] they're jumping they're cutting
[40:36] themselves they're doing all sorts of
[40:38] things and there's
[40:39] Elijah I don't have a chair up here you
[40:42] mind if I borrow a
[40:46] chair you got it all right here we go
[40:49] there's Elijah up on Mount
[40:54] Carmel I hate to say say it this way in
[40:58] church why don't you cry a little bit
[41:01] louder maybe your God is hard of
[41:05] hearing maybe he's
[41:07] sleeping maybe your God's busy you need
[41:10] to get listen they got excited they got
[41:13] emotional they danced they cut
[41:15] themselves they were doing everything
[41:17] they could do and Elijah says well you
[41:19] know work a little
[41:23] harder you know he didn't feel sorry for
[41:25] him why because he knew his God and he
[41:28] knew who he was as he sat there on Mount
[41:32] carel he called them more and more and
[41:34] more finally you know the the the
[41:37] prophets of Baal had totally exhausted
[41:39] themselves and Baal had not answered so
[41:42] then Elijah got the stones of Israel 12
[41:47] Stones and rebuilt the altar of Israel
[41:51] one for each tribe one for Judah one for
[41:55] Benjamin one for isachar one for Dan
[41:59] he's going through the 12 he's
[42:00] rebuilding the altar of Israel what is
[42:03] he doing he's reestablishing the word of
[42:05] God in Israel he's turning them back
[42:08] turning their faith back as it were to
[42:10] the faith of the fathers and so he's
[42:13] he's he's bringing it now he says all
[42:15] right we're going to lay the sacrifice
[42:17] on here dig a trench around about here
[42:19] and he they dig the trench he says now
[42:21] pour water on the sacrifice until the
[42:24] trench is full of water
[42:28] now that doesn't seem like a very
[42:29] religious
[42:31] ceremony but he knew what he was doing
[42:35] and then now remember it had been a
[42:36] drought so the ground is dry you know
[42:39] how much water it's going to take until
[42:41] the ground is soaked with water and it
[42:43] actually stays in the trench you ever
[42:45] done that Arizona is kind of a dry place
[42:48] you know you can keep pouring water on
[42:49] the ground and it keeps disappearing you
[42:52] know well that's exactly like it was
[42:54] there on Mount Caramel and as they
[42:56] poured water and more water and more
[42:58] water I don't know where they got all
[42:59] the water but they brought more and more
[43:01] water and finally the the trench begins
[43:03] to fill up with water and they're going
[43:05] to praise the Lord this is hard work and
[43:08] you know they finally the trench fills
[43:09] up with water the altar is soaked the
[43:11] sacrifices laid on the Altar and now
[43:14] what does Elijah do he simply says
[43:17] this Lord let it be
[43:21] known that you are God and that I am
[43:25] your prophet yes and that I have done
[43:28] this at your
[43:29] command simple as that and the fire of
[43:33] God came down and consumed the sacrifice
[43:37] and consumed The Altar and consumed the
[43:41] water so mighty was the fire of God
[43:44] there wasn't even an altar left there
[43:46] was only a burnt spot on the
[43:49] ground and he took and he slew the
[43:52] emotional overwrought prophets of Baal
[43:55] and and and brought Israel back to God
[43:58] and he thought the whole nation would
[43:59] turn back to God but all that God had
[44:01] showed him is do what I show you right
[44:04] and I will fulfill my word it's not you
[44:07] fulfilling the word it's not your energy
[44:09] it's not your emotion you might have
[44:11] energy you might have emotion you know
[44:13] human beings are
[44:14] emotional right anybody know that of
[44:17] course men are more emotional than women
[44:21] right praise the Lord Brother Tim
[44:24] doesn't even know his human
[44:28] pschology but you know what God came
[44:31] down and fulfilled his word Mo uh Elijah
[44:35] didn't have to sing he didn't have to
[44:36] shout he didn't have to do nothing he
[44:37] just had to fulfill the word of God now
[44:40] I want to just say this for a reason
[44:41] because Elijah was anointed with an
[44:44] eagle anointing yes okay and he goes
[44:47] from there now and and they they slay
[44:51] all the prophets of Baal and Jezebel
[44:53] hears about it and Jezebel sends a
[44:54] messenger to Elijah says I'm going to
[44:57] kill you
[44:59] now God had never told him that part
[45:04] yeah right Elijah all of a sudden
[45:08] goes Lord you didn't tell me
[45:11] this and he started to sweat it pretty
[45:15] seriously was he still a prophet yes was
[45:19] he still the one that was sent in that
[45:21] hour to bring the message of God was he
[45:24] scared yes why was he scared because he
[45:27] didn't know what to
[45:29] do and so he ran from there brother R
[45:32] says had a nervous breakdown and he ran
[45:35] from there at the threat of a woman out
[45:37] into the Wilderness because of the
[45:39] threat of one woman and he didn't know
[45:41] what he was going to do and he ends up
[45:42] at a cave right long story short ends up
[45:45] at a cave here's a prophet Anointed with
[45:47] an eagle anointing ends up at a cave
[45:50] he's he's in the cave and the voice of
[45:52] God comes to him and says what are you
[45:53] doing here Elijah what doest thou here
[45:56] Elijah and and and God says go stand in
[46:01] the mouth of the cave so Elijah go
[46:02] stands at the entrance to the cave and A
[46:05] Mighty Wind goes by think about it A
[46:08] Mighty Wind goes by and Elijah goes
[46:12] praise the Lord It's A Mighty Wind no he
[46:16] doesn't Bible says God wasn't in the
[46:19] wind
[46:20] right a mighty fire goes
[46:23] through and God wasn't in the fire
[46:26] and Elijah was standing there saying
[46:28] that doesn't impress me cuz I'm not
[46:31] interested in outward demonstrations I'm
[46:32] interested in God yes and
[46:35] then an earthquake happens the ground
[46:39] shakes listen the ground shook in in the
[46:42] book of
[46:43] Acts the W Mighty Wind came down a sound
[46:47] of a rushing wind on the day of
[46:48] Pentecost nothing we're not complaining
[46:50] about those that I'm just saying that
[46:53] those things were real there but they
[46:54] were also real in Elijah day but Elijah
[46:57] just stood there because he wanted God
[47:00] and so now well this is glorious now he
[47:04] stands there and he says F and the Bible
[47:06] says finally a still Small Voice came to
[47:08] Elijah and then Elijah Mount wrapped
[47:10] himself in his mantle and came and stood
[47:13] outside the cave and he listened to the
[47:16] voice of God hallelujah that's what he
[47:19] came to hear was the voice of God I want
[47:22] God to speak to me I don't just want an
[47:24] emotional experence if I just wanted an
[47:26] emotional experience I'd go join the
[47:28] prophets of ba that's not the point I
[47:31] want to hear direct from God so he
[47:32] stands there listen now he stands there
[47:35] and brother Bram oh I love how he puts
[47:38] this and he as he's standing there God
[47:40] comes and speaks to him and Elijah says
[47:43] God says what are you doing he says
[47:44] listen I I I I've stood for you I only
[47:48] am
[47:49] left he says they've I've slain the
[47:51] prophets of Baal they threatened my life
[47:53] they killed all of your prophets there's
[47:55] nobody left in Israel that serves you I
[47:57] only am left in Israel what did God
[48:01] do brother Brown puts it this way God
[48:03] pulled back a seal for
[48:06] Elijah God opened the word for Elijah to
[48:10] see that there were 7,000 that had not
[48:12] bowed their knee to
[48:14] bail and that Elijah your ministry is
[48:17] not over I want you to go from here and
[48:20] I want you to go and juu and haziel and
[48:23] and Elisha in your stad and there's
[48:25] there's this is the way that's got to do
[48:27] now Elisha could Le Elijah could leave
[48:30] the cave with the
[48:32] commission the bride has thus saith the
[48:34] Lord or she stands still she's under an
[48:37] eagle anointing and Elijah under an
[48:40] eagle anointing he says I'm staying in
[48:41] this cave until God speaks to me I'm not
[48:44] interested in accomplishing something on
[48:46] the earth I'm interested in my
[48:48] relationship with
[48:50] God where he sends me I will go what he
[48:54] tells me to do I will do let him speak
[48:58] to me because when he speaks to me it
[49:00] always comes to pass exactly the way he
[49:03] says
[49:05] it
[49:07] amen that's an eagle anointing I'm going
[49:10] to take you now to the next Prophet
[49:13] Elisha this one's
[49:15] powerful if we can see this we can see a
[49:19] lot so Elisha we know is the next
[49:22] Prophet after Elijah they crossed Jordan
[49:24] together just Elisha comes back Elisha
[49:26] fulfills the commission of God and many
[49:30] different experiences that Elisha has
[49:33] there comes a time that because non the
[49:36] Syrian comes and gets healed and gesi
[49:39] misbehaves himself gesi gets leprosy and
[49:43] he's no longer the servant of Elisha so
[49:46] now there's another servant of Elisha
[49:49] and they're in the city of
[49:50] dotham all right and in this city now uh
[49:54] is where Elisha is is living and the
[49:56] king of Syria is trying to set an ambush
[49:59] for the king of Israel Ahab and so he he
[50:03] he sends um he sends armies into Israel
[50:07] to set set an ambush and Elisha sends a
[50:10] messenger that's why I said this morning
[50:12] if Israel today would have had a prophet
[50:15] they never would have had happened to
[50:16] them what happened to
[50:18] them or least if they would listen to
[50:20] the prophet and so Elisha sends a
[50:23] message to the king and the and and says
[50:25] don't don't go down this this certain
[50:26] Valley cuz the syrians are waiting for
[50:28] you and then it happens again and the
[50:31] syrians are waiting in another place for
[50:32] an ambush and they want to Ambush the
[50:34] king and Elisha sends a message be
[50:36] careful because the king of Syria is
[50:38] waiting for you over in this area over
[50:39] here and so all of this is happening and
[50:41] finally the king of Syria is getting so
[50:43] frustrated says somebody tell me who the
[50:45] Spy is amongst
[50:47] us and the and one of his his uh uh
[50:52] advisers I think it is says sorry King
[50:55] but it's not as a a spy amongst us
[50:59] Israel has a prophet and he knows your
[51:02] secrets in your bed
[51:04] Chambers and so you know you you know
[51:07] there's nothing we can do about it and
[51:09] and the King says well where does this
[51:11] Prophet live and he lives in dotham all
[51:13] right we're going to go and sleep slip
[51:15] down there in the middle of the night
[51:16] and surround the city now you don't
[51:18] think that if Elisha knew he was going
[51:21] to be here and Elisha knew he was going
[51:22] to be there that Elisha didn't know he
[51:25] is going to be surrounding the
[51:27] city okay so but the morning comes and
[51:30] his servant gets up all right he's gets
[51:33] out of bed in the morning and you know
[51:36] how it is in the morning and I got to
[51:38] put the coffee on and you know and just
[51:40] you know rubbing his eyes and he sets
[51:43] puts the W starts the fire puts the
[51:45] water on to boil and he's getting
[51:47] everything ready and he looks out the
[51:54] window uh
[51:58] Elisha
[52:00] Elisha
[52:02] Elisha he's scared to death he runs into
[52:06] the into where Elisha is says we're
[52:08] surrounded and Elisha's just relaxing
[52:11] he's waiting for breakfast to be made
[52:14] yeah he knows what's going
[52:16] on because he knows who he is yes you
[52:20] know when Jesus went up on the mountain
[52:22] and they took him on up on the mountain
[52:23] to throw him over the hill
[52:26] off the cliff and kill him the Bible
[52:29] says Jesus just turned and walked
[52:31] through their
[52:33] midst wasn't he didn't have to escape or
[52:35] fall he just knew the word did not say
[52:38] I'm going to die from being thrown off a
[52:40] mountain right the word said I was going
[52:42] to die on the cross so I'm Invincible
[52:45] until I fulfill my place in this world
[52:49] Amen and there was elishah and he said
[52:51] to his servant he said Don't Fear
[52:53] there's more with us than there is with
[52:56] them now what was going on at this point
[52:59] Elisha was trying to get his servant to
[53:02] see what he
[53:04] saw here's an eagle anointing now the
[53:07] the servant was not Anointed with that
[53:09] anointing but elishah was trying to get
[53:11] him to believe him amen you see that's
[53:14] why the message oh this is just brother
[53:18] Tim now but that's why the message had
[53:20] to change from man anointing to Eagle
[53:22] anointing because under the man
[53:24] anointing you'll never never see what
[53:25] the prophet sees but under an eagle
[53:28] anointing your eyes will come open to
[53:31] see what brother brandham
[53:33] saw Hallelujah God has alloted that in
[53:36] these last days you will be Anointed
[53:38] with the same anointing brother brandham
[53:40] was anointed as a
[53:42] prophet
[53:44] Hallelujah and so there now Elisha is
[53:47] standing there and and and the telling
[53:49] his servant there's more with us than
[53:51] there is with them and the servant says
[53:52] well okay Do You Believe Me Lord I
[53:57] believe help thou my lack of
[53:59] faith I'm I'm trying to believe with
[54:01] everything that that's within me but the
[54:03] problem is I just need more faith to
[54:06] loose whatever is in my life and so
[54:10] finally Elisha says Lord open his eyes
[54:14] is that what he said Lord open this
[54:16] boy's eyes and the boy's eyes come open
[54:18] and this boy that was shaken there and
[54:21] all upset and all fearful his eyes come
[54:23] open and he sees the mountains that are
[54:26] that are filled with f angels of fire
[54:29] and Chariots of Fire and swords of fire
[54:31] and a mighty Army of God that's there
[54:34] protecting God's Prophet
[54:36] Elijah and then you can just see the
[54:38] serent the servant look out the window
[54:41] you ain't so
[54:46] tough yeah you ain't so
[54:48] bad ah we're bigger my daddy's bigger
[54:52] than your
[54:54] daddy
[54:55] yeah all of a sudden this shaking
[54:57] quaking coward by having his eyes come
[55:00] open now can be a brave man now catch
[55:05] this now this is a vital important now
[55:07] if you can catch this tonight if there's
[55:08] the only thing you catch catch this
[55:10] nothing had
[55:15] changed nothing had changed the Angels
[55:18] didn't all of a sudden come from heaven
[55:20] and appear they were already
[55:22] there they were already on the scene in
[55:25] Elijah they were already on the seene to
[55:27] hold back the armies of Syria see
[55:29] everything that you have need of is
[55:31] already on the scene God just needs to
[55:33] open your
[55:34] eyes Hallelujah that's why go Jesus said
[55:37] to the disciples blessed are your eyes
[55:39] for they see blessed are your ears for
[55:41] they hear for a the the sages and the
[55:44] prophets of old have desired to look
[55:47] upon the scenes that you're seeing and
[55:49] I'll say every Church age messenger
[55:51] every believer in every Church age has
[55:53] desired to see the things that's open to
[55:55] your
[55:56] eyes Hallelujah as desire to see the
[55:59] things that you're looking into as a
[56:01] servant of God under an anointed Eagle
[56:04] anointing in this hour to look into
[56:07] Heavens the way a prophet
[56:10] sees glory be to
[56:12] God that's why God sends an eagle
[56:15] anointing because the purpose of a
[56:18] prophet is to get to see th people to
[56:20] see things from God's
[56:23] perspective God lifts him up to see and
[56:27] he con the conveys the message to the
[56:29] people God raised brother brandom up to
[56:32] see things but now it's different
[56:34] because now he's conveying it to a
[56:36] people that are to be Anointed with the
[56:38] same anointing that he's
[56:40] anointed not a prophet to the age
[56:43] anointing don't get me wrong but an
[56:45] eagle anointing with eyes to see things
[56:49] from a different
[56:51] perspective you see God's purpose and
[56:53] his plan and his his reality has not
[56:59] changed he's always your healer yes he's
[57:03] always been your
[57:05] provider he's always been everything
[57:07] that you have need of but now is the
[57:10] hour that God has anointed us to see
[57:12] things the way he sees
[57:15] things glory be to
[57:23] God that's why brother brandham was
[57:25] commissioned if you can get the people
[57:27] to believe you that's
[57:30] right brother brandham could see it
[57:33] brother BR had no problem believing but
[57:35] if you can get the people to believe you
[57:38] but now God takes the prophet off the
[57:41] scene only two and a half years into the
[57:44] eagle anointing two and 3/4 years into
[57:48] the eagle anointing why because he
[57:50] replaces the prophet with an anointing
[57:53] amen he took the the prophet but send an
[57:56] eagle anointing upon the church that you
[57:59] by the revealed word of the hour can see
[58:02] things from God's
[58:05] perspective I say
[58:08] hallelujah I'm so glad I'm living in
[58:10] this
[58:17] day it's your
[58:19] perspective that the eagle anointing has
[58:21] come to
[58:22] change you always were son of God but
[58:26] you didn't know what that
[58:28] was you did you see the church down
[58:31] Through the Ages didn't know it wasn't
[58:33] revealed to them that they are entitled
[58:36] to everything that Adam lost but you
[58:39] know it's been revealed to you you've
[58:43] been anointed to receive that everything
[58:46] that Adam lost perfect Faith perfect
[58:48] love perfect everything you've been
[58:50] anointed to realize that the title deed
[58:53] has been put into your hands
[58:55] that the abstract of the Holy Ghost see
[58:59] here we go from another perspective now
[59:01] the is this okay all right the abstract
[59:05] oh my oh it's not that late all
[59:08] right give me five more minutes who give
[59:10] me five more minutes five more just a
[59:13] few of you five more minutes all
[59:17] right okay I think there's about 12 125s
[59:20] is 60 that's an hour okay
[59:23] okay all
[59:25] right when Jesus went into the tomb as
[59:29] far as the natural man could see a
[59:33] man what was what happened was there's a
[59:36] body laying in a
[59:37] tomb Jesus was in the
[59:40] Tomb but through the revealed word of
[59:43] God we know Jesus was not in the Tomb we
[59:46] know firstly he went to prison went to
[59:48] hell to preach to souls in prison amen
[59:53] and then he ascended Up From Hell H
[59:55] because the promise is I'll not suffer
[59:57] my Holy One to see corruption and so he
[1:00:00] send it up from Hell went into Paradise
[1:00:02] to empty out paradise and bring all the
[1:00:04] Believers out of paradise because they
[1:00:06] had to stay there until the atonement
[1:00:08] was made and then bringing the the
[1:00:10] Believers out of paradise there was a
[1:00:12] Resurrection on Easter morning and and
[1:00:15] many of the saints that were in the
[1:00:16] grave arose because they were coming out
[1:00:19] of paradise they were coming through the
[1:00:21] Earth and they were going off into glory
[1:00:24] amen so this is now what we understand
[1:00:26] and we see but if you were living in
[1:00:28] that day you'd be with the
[1:00:30] disciples oh we thought it was the he
[1:00:32] that would redeem Israel matter of fact
[1:00:36] a couple of them were walking on the
[1:00:37] road 20 minutes they told me I can't
[1:00:38] walk around because the video only still
[1:00:40] shows the front here but let me just
[1:00:42] walk across the front here and there's
[1:00:44] two of them walking to you there come
[1:00:45] walk with me Elliot yeah come walk with
[1:00:47] me you know oh we thought he was the man
[1:00:51] you know I can't believe we gave our
[1:00:52] lives to this gospel for the last three
[1:00:55] years and now they crucified him and he
[1:00:58] died and all of these things and oh we
[1:01:01] don't know what to do Woe Is Us he's in
[1:01:03] the Tomb he's dead now it's all over our
[1:01:07] lives are over nothing good is going to
[1:01:09] happen it's it's now the end of
[1:01:11] everything that we've ever dreamed or
[1:01:13] hoped life is a misery I don't know
[1:01:15] what's going to take place I guess we'll
[1:01:17] just go back to our old jobs of fishing
[1:01:19] or farming or whatever we were doing and
[1:01:22] oh my this is a miserable existence we
[1:01:24] had we never should have got involved
[1:01:26] with
[1:01:28] this and then one joins himself to their
[1:01:32] midst and says what manner of
[1:01:34] conversation is this that you're having
[1:01:37] oh don't you even know what's going
[1:01:40] on don't you know about Jesus of
[1:01:43] Nazareth they say to Jesus of
[1:01:47] Nazareth
[1:01:48] yeah don't you know about Jesus of
[1:01:51] Nazareth who was a mighty prophet in
[1:01:53] word and deed and they've taken him and
[1:01:55] they've crucified him and it's all over
[1:01:57] now and I'm stumbling over the stage and
[1:02:00] and all of these things it's just a it's
[1:02:02] just a miserable existence that we have
[1:02:05] now and Jesus says to them oh
[1:02:09] fools and slow of heart to believe all
[1:02:14] that the prophets have
[1:02:16] spoken amen thank you and and he began
[1:02:20] to beginning at Moses and all the
[1:02:22] prophets he begin to expound to them the
[1:02:25] scriptures concerning who himself
[1:02:30] because he walked by Perfect faith in
[1:02:32] what the word said he was I am that man
[1:02:36] that came down didn't wasn't the Messiah
[1:02:38] supposed to suffer wasn't he supposed to
[1:02:39] die wasn't he supposed to isn't it say
[1:02:41] cursed it he that hangs on a tree
[1:02:43] because there's he's got to become a
[1:02:45] curse that the rest of the world could
[1:02:46] be Loos from the curse and all of these
[1:02:48] things and and as he began to explain
[1:02:50] with them their hearts begin to burn
[1:02:51] within they still couldn't see yet right
[1:02:54] but their hearts begin to burn within
[1:02:56] them oh this message sounds so good I
[1:02:59] haven't heard things like this since
[1:03:01] Jesus himself was
[1:03:05] here and as they're walking along and
[1:03:07] wondering oh if only if only yeah and so
[1:03:10] they get to him and they said and he he
[1:03:13] acts like he's going to just carry on
[1:03:15] and they said oh listen just stay with
[1:03:16] us a little while we'll buy you the
[1:03:18] you'll buy we'll buy you supper come and
[1:03:20] sit down and have some food with us and
[1:03:21] they sat down at the
[1:03:23] table and he begins to break bread like
[1:03:26] he always did and then what their eyes
[1:03:29] become open Hallelujah nothing
[1:03:33] changed nothing changed their eyes
[1:03:36] become open now they see him for who he
[1:03:40] really is now he becomes revealed in
[1:03:43] front of them the Mighty God unveiled in
[1:03:46] their midst and they recognize the day
[1:03:49] they're living in and then they he
[1:03:52] disappears out of their midst they run
[1:03:53] back to to Jerusalem and then they're
[1:03:56] there in no time and says we saw him
[1:03:59] hallelujah our eyes became open well how
[1:04:02] did you see him well never mind about
[1:04:04] that part we don't want to tell you that
[1:04:05] part but we sat in the restaurant
[1:04:08] together and we we broke bread and and
[1:04:10] he revealed himself to us hallelujah
[1:04:14] listen sometimes your heart's burning
[1:04:16] because God's trying to get something
[1:04:18] too he says Church why do you hunger why
[1:04:21] do you thirst it's God trying to get
[1:04:23] these m truths into you hallelujah it's
[1:04:28] already here amen that's why brother

[1:05:05] brother Brown says that's what they're
[1:05:08] feeling he says why do they do
[1:05:11] that he says they want a Great
[1:05:14] Awakening they're crying believing they
[1:05:17] will be awakened they're good people why
[1:05:21] is it what have they done they have not
[1:05:23] recognized The Awakening of the
[1:05:28] Bride he says by being a Christian they
[1:05:30] feel the pull of the
[1:05:32] hour now this is 1964 in other words
[1:05:36] they've left the man anointing the
[1:05:38] Revival's over the eagle anointing has
[1:05:41] come they feel the pull but they don't
[1:05:45] see what was happening under the man
[1:05:47] anointing and they want to reproduce
[1:05:49] what was happening under the man
[1:05:51] anointing all right and so there's
[1:05:54] they're saying now they they have not
[1:05:56] recognized The Awakening of the Bride
[1:05:57] being a Christian they feel the pull of
[1:05:59] the hour but they haven't recognized
[1:06:01] what's been done listen what he says now
[1:06:03] that's what's making them feel that way
[1:06:06] they know something is supposed to
[1:06:08] happen but see they are looking for it
[1:06:10] way off in the future to come when it's
[1:06:13] already happened right by
[1:06:16] you
[1:06:18] hallelujah oh my we could spend a lot of
[1:06:21] time on that what was it they didn't see
[1:06:23] it
[1:06:24] right the eagle anointing came to the
[1:06:26] church and they didn't see it their eyes
[1:06:28] were not open to it they didn't
[1:06:30] recognize what was happening right in
[1:06:32] their midst the bride was being awakened
[1:06:34] the word was bringing the bride into
[1:06:38] position I was in a concert a few weeks
[1:06:41] ago with my wife someone bought us
[1:06:44] tickets to a classical concert called
[1:06:48] handle's Messiah anybody ever heard of
[1:06:50] handle's Messiah all right so you know
[1:06:52] what I'm talking about handle's Messiah
[1:06:54] is a is a classical Orchestra choir
[1:06:58] piece that was written in the
[1:07:00] 1700s and it has three parts to it or
[1:07:02] three movements the first part is
[1:07:05] written about the coming of Christ to
[1:07:08] Bethlehem and in a
[1:07:09] manger and the second part is about his
[1:07:13] rejection and his
[1:07:15] crucifixion and his
[1:07:17] resurrection but then there's a third
[1:07:20] part and the third part in the third
[1:07:23] part they use a lot of the scriptures
[1:07:25] that you hear
[1:07:26] about the Lord himself shall descend
[1:07:29] from heaven with a
[1:07:31] shout they say there we shall not all
[1:07:33] sleep but we shall all be changed this
[1:07:36] is right in the Concerto in the moment
[1:07:38] in the twinkling of an eye this Mortal
[1:07:40] will become immortality they're using
[1:07:43] scriptures that not only do we preach
[1:07:46] but we live and so as I'm sitting in the
[1:07:47] concert listening to them saying and
[1:07:49] their and their classical music and all
[1:07:51] those things I have to confess it wasn't
[1:07:53] that enjoyable
[1:07:56] but as I was sitting there listening to
[1:07:58] it I thought to
[1:08:01] myself this is exactly what brother
[1:08:03] bradam spoke about 2,000 happened 2,000
[1:08:05] years ago where the Jews were sitting in
[1:08:09] the synagogues singing my God my God why
[1:08:13] hast Thou forsaken me my bones they
[1:08:16] stare at me they pierce my side all of
[1:08:20] those things that David sang under
[1:08:22] inspiration they're singing them as
[1:08:24] worship songs in the synagogue while out
[1:08:27] on Calvary it's happening right in front
[1:08:29] of them and I thought all of these
[1:08:32] people listening to this handles Messiah
[1:08:35] and they're singing about the change of
[1:08:37] these bodies and they're singing about
[1:08:39] the resurrection and they're singing
[1:08:40] about the Rapture and they're singing
[1:08:42] about the very things that we preach
[1:08:44] about they're singing about it while
[1:08:46] it's happening right in front of
[1:08:49] them their eyes are closed they can't
[1:08:53] recognize it but blessed are your eyes
[1:08:55] for they see blessed are you that has
[1:08:58] come under the anointing of this hour to
[1:09:01] recognize who you are to recognize your
[1:09:04] position in Christ because when the
[1:09:06] cover comes off the book and the Mystery
[1:09:08] is revealed of that's contained within
[1:09:10] the Seven Seals listen it's not about
[1:09:12] the symbols of black horse rider and red
[1:09:15] horse rider and white horse rider and
[1:09:17] pale horse rider and all of those things
[1:09:19] are just symbols of Revelations that are
[1:09:22] taking place in the day
[1:09:24] that there's an anointing that comes to
[1:09:26] the word that says you are the bride you
[1:09:29] are the Spotless one you are The
[1:09:31] Virtuous one you are the one that I have
[1:09:34] projected my love down Through the Ages
[1:09:36] that my Redemptive plan has been
[1:09:38] building up to this very hour to a very
[1:09:41] cresendo where you shall fulfill the
[1:09:44] very promise of the word there is a
[1:09:46] people that will not die there is a
[1:09:50] people that will catch the revelation of
[1:09:52] the word can you say Amen to that
[1:09:54] if there's only one of them I'm that one
[1:09:56] there's a people that will catch that
[1:09:58] Revelation and it causes them to rejoice
[1:10:02] it causes them to glory in their God it
[1:10:05] causes them to enter into a relationship
[1:10:07] with him because it's a revelation we
[1:10:10] could go to Esther and say how she had
[1:10:12] to catch the revelation of who she
[1:10:15] was she was already the queen but she
[1:10:18] had to catch the revelation of what that
[1:10:20] meant see the very revelation of what it
[1:10:23] means to be bride lays within this
[1:10:26] message I can't emphasize enough get
[1:10:29] into the message get into the word that
[1:10:32] has been sent to you to tell you who you
[1:10:34] are because when you recognize who you
[1:10:36] are you are an invincible Army in the in
[1:10:39] the sight of the devil he can't do
[1:10:41] anything with you you walk by Perfect
[1:10:44] faith in what the word says you
[1:10:47] are praise the Lord Brother Bram never
[1:10:49] said I walk by Perfect faith in how I
[1:10:52] feel I walk by Perfect faith in all my
[1:10:58] mistakes I walk by Perfect faith in the
[1:11:00] church that I'm a member
[1:11:02] of no I walk by Perfect faith in what
[1:11:05] the word says I am hallelujah what the
[1:11:09] word says I am that it's got nothing to
[1:11:12] do with how I feel about it I can't tell
[1:11:14] you as a minister the number of times I
[1:11:17] prayed for people and not felt a thing
[1:11:20] isn't that right brother Aon you pray
[1:11:22] for somebody and you don't feel a thing
[1:11:25] and yet you know God there's no reason
[1:11:28] that word cannot be fulfilled in that
[1:11:29] young man's life had a young man that
[1:11:32] was that had been hit with a puck in the
[1:11:34] chest he was a hockey goalie and in a
[1:11:36] lot of pain something must have been
[1:11:38] displaced or something they didn't know
[1:11:39] what to do for him and he kept getting
[1:11:41] it get worse and then better and worse
[1:11:43] and then better he comes into church on
[1:11:45] a weekday I'm in my in the office at the
[1:11:47] church there and he and I happened to be
[1:11:49] the only Minister that was there and the
[1:11:50] sister brings him into the into the Ser
[1:11:53] into the office says you know this is
[1:11:55] the problem could you pray for my son
[1:11:57] and so we go and into the sanctuary use
[1:12:00] the anointing oil pray for I don't feel
[1:12:02] a thing but in my heart I'm saying Lord
[1:12:05] I see no reason why your word can't be
[1:12:06] fulfilled at this very moment right and
[1:12:09] he goes he goes from there and as soon
[1:12:11] as he walks out of the church he's
[1:12:12] completely
[1:12:14] free now his testimony was as brother
[1:12:18] Tim prayed for me it got worse and worse
[1:12:23] and worse until finally he said in the
[1:12:26] name of the Lord Jesus he says then it
[1:12:29] left
[1:12:30] Hallelujah and what did I feel not a
[1:12:33] thing it's got nothing to do with what I
[1:12:35] feel I walk by faith in what this word
[1:12:38] says we are amen we are a people that
[1:12:42] has been called to fulfill every last
[1:12:45] promise of God in the last days
[1:12:52] hallelujah
[1:12:56] a lot of times people get
[1:12:58] confused because can I take a few more
[1:13:02] minutes all
[1:13:04] right because they feel the Deep
[1:13:07] call and they try to satisfy it with
[1:13:10] means other than the revelation of the
[1:13:13] word of
[1:13:14] God see there if you're a seed Gene of
[1:13:17] God if you were in the mind of God
[1:13:18] before the foundation of the world
[1:13:19] there's something in you calling you to
[1:13:22] this revealed word in this hour it's
[1:13:24] calling you it's pushing you you cannot
[1:13:27] be satisfied with anything else that's
[1:13:29] why people even Believers that that
[1:13:31] don't know their Believers are
[1:13:32] predestinated the elect of God they get
[1:13:35] into things like alcohol and drugs and
[1:13:38] and and lust and different things
[1:13:40] because what are they trying to do
[1:13:41] they're trying to satisfy a spiritual
[1:13:44] call with a natural
[1:13:46] desire it'll never work if you're
[1:13:49] trapped in one of those things tonight
[1:13:51] you just need to say God forgive me me
[1:13:54] and set me free from this and fill me
[1:13:57] with your word you know the devil will
[1:13:59] tell you oh it'll make you feel better
[1:14:01] well it might make you feel better
[1:14:02] temporarily but it won't satisfy the
[1:14:04] Deep call there's a deep call in the
[1:14:07] elect of God that you're looking for
[1:14:09] that can only be satisfied in the change
[1:14:11] of these bodies in the in stepping into
[1:14:13] your theophany that's all that can be
[1:14:17] satisfied brother Bram says in Easter
[1:14:19] seal he
[1:14:22] says as it was in the days of Noah so
[1:14:24] shall it be in the coming of the son of
[1:14:26] man I just have to drop this in here
[1:14:29] before we move to the
[1:14:31] close he says they were eating drinking
[1:14:34] marrying giving in marriage as it was in
[1:14:36] the days of lot so will it be in the
[1:14:38] hours that the son of man will be
[1:14:40] revealed on Earth not Son of God no more
[1:14:42] son of man come back as the prophetic
[1:14:45] message of the last
[1:14:49] days don't gloss over that Amen brother
[1:14:53] Adam is taking the revealing of the son
[1:14:55] of man and tying it to the eagle
[1:14:58] anointing all right he's placing the two
[1:15:01] together what is the revealing of the
[1:15:03] son of man it's when the seals are
[1:15:05] broken all right the he's a son of man
[1:15:09] brother Brandon was a son of man
[1:15:11] revealing the son of
[1:15:13] man all right so he was a prophet
[1:15:16] revealing the prophet the god Prophet
[1:15:20] that's why you're Anointed with a
[1:15:21] prophetic anointing even though you're
[1:15:23] not a prophet right it's the anointing
[1:15:26] of the revealing of the son of
[1:15:29] man all right son of man come back as
[1:15:32] the prophetic message for the last day
[1:15:35] when the eagle will be
[1:15:37] flying not the lion not the ox in the
[1:15:41] sacrifice age see every time a religious
[1:15:43] power went forth now we're back to the
[1:15:45] anointings every time a religious power
[1:15:47] went forth to meet the challenge of the
[1:15:49] political power of the world when the
[1:15:51] lion raised up the Rel religious power
[1:15:54] it went to meet the Roman power and then
[1:15:56] when it come the sacrifice hour the ox
[1:15:58] went because he's a sacrifice Beast to
[1:16:00] the Lord then come the reformers down
[1:16:02] through the church Ages come the face of
[1:16:04] a man then the reformers have been since
[1:16:06] Luther Wesley Calvin on down Pentecostal
[1:16:08] age but in the last message that went
[1:16:13] forth there came a flying
[1:16:16] eagle it's Eagle
[1:16:19] time reveal time I'm quoting right amen
[1:16:24] what time is it it's Eagle time it's
[1:16:26] revealed time right all right the word
[1:16:29] of God made
[1:16:31] manifest the word of God proved and then
[1:16:34] he says oh children walk into this
[1:16:37] baptism of the Holy Ghost come in and
[1:16:41] believe it with all your heart God will
[1:16:44] fill you it's Eagle time it's not man
[1:16:47] time it's not Ox time it's not lion time
[1:16:50] it's Eagle time it's the baptism of the
[1:16:53] Holy Ghost of this day amen people try
[1:16:56] to make it to be something like a man
[1:16:58] age it is not a man age it is an eag I
[1:17:01] don't mean to harp on that I'm just
[1:17:02] saying that you've got to recognize the
[1:17:04] baptism of the Holy Ghost is to bring
[1:17:07] you into a perfect faith in what the
[1:17:09] word says you are amen amen that's
[1:17:12] exactly what other else manifests is
[1:17:15] fine if it's if it's lines up with the
[1:17:17] word of God but the goal of the eagle
[1:17:19] anointing is to bring you into a perfect
[1:17:22] faith of what the word says you
[1:17:25] are
[1:17:32] Hallelujah this this one that rides out
[1:17:34] under in opposition to the eagle of
[1:17:36] anointing is called
[1:17:38] death and the person of
[1:17:41] death as he's called
[1:17:43] Death a mixed horse spiritual death
[1:17:47] natural death death institutional death
[1:17:51] denominational death
[1:17:53] we could go to the seventh seal and
[1:17:55] brother BR says it's the end of all
[1:17:57] things all things end up under this seal
[1:18:01] which the seventh seal is the revealing
[1:18:03] of the son of man it is the coming of
[1:18:06] the lord it's the reason the Angels were
[1:18:08] quiet all heaven was quiet for the space
[1:18:10] of half an hour all of those things of
[1:18:12] what brother brandham said it's it's the
[1:18:14] anointing sent into this hour to bring
[1:18:16] us into the Rapture what is rapturing
[1:18:18] Faith perfect faith in what the word
[1:18:20] says you are that's what the Eagle
[1:18:23] anointing is set to bring so now as that
[1:18:25] comes into the church and takes its
[1:18:27] place within the church everything else
[1:18:30] has to die all right everything under
[1:18:33] the previous ages has to die Luther
[1:18:36] Wesley Pentecost is shock tossel
[1:18:40] shuck it all has to
[1:18:44] die for death anointing is upon the land
[1:18:48] the only thing that remains all the life
[1:18:51] goes into seed for
[1:18:53] form Hallelujah so the church comes back
[1:18:58] into the original image of the word or
[1:19:01] the seed that went into the ground in
[1:19:03] the
[1:19:04] beginning as the word was made flesh in
[1:19:07] Jesus Christ now the word is made flesh
[1:19:10] in the bride Hallelujah an anointing has
[1:19:14] come upon the church to give you a
[1:19:16] perfect faith in who you
[1:19:19] are amen hallelujah amen not in who the
[1:19:23] church is not even in who brother
[1:19:25] brandham is we believe who brother
[1:19:27] brandham was we believe he fulfilled his
[1:19:29] part and we're not doing away with that
[1:19:31] we would have nothing if it wasn't for
[1:19:33] brother brandham but because of that
[1:19:35] message that God sent through brother
[1:19:37] brandham an anointing is come upon the
[1:19:39] church to place me positionally in who I
[1:19:43] am and as long as I stay with who I am
[1:19:47] then I am
[1:19:50] invincible and that's the great thing
[1:19:52] about the infite Redemptive purpose of
[1:19:54] God because God's infinite I want you to
[1:19:56] notice now the difference between God's
[1:19:57] Eden and Satan's Eden in God's Eden the
[1:20:01] only thing you want is to be in your
[1:20:04] place Lord Place me in my place but in
[1:20:08] Satan's Eden the anointing is to be
[1:20:11] number one I want to be the best I want
[1:20:14] to be the greatest I want to be number
[1:20:15] one I wantan to I want to be the richest
[1:20:17] I want to be the most educated I want to
[1:20:19] be the best athlete I want to be this I
[1:20:20] want to be that that's Satan's Eden
[1:20:23] why because it's Satan's anointing
[1:20:25] because in the beginning the one thing
[1:20:27] Satan did not want was who he
[1:20:33] was he wanted I will exalt
[1:20:37] myself above the stars of God I will sit
[1:20:41] in the Mount of the most high I will be
[1:20:45] like
[1:20:46] God is that right that was the devil's
[1:20:49] Revelation and that's the Revelation in
[1:20:51] leosa that's the Revelation in s Zen but
[1:20:54] the bride when she catches the
[1:20:57] revelation of who she is in my position
[1:21:00] I have infinite power yes Hallelujah and
[1:21:05] I can't take somebody else's position
[1:21:07] nobody can take your
[1:21:09] place you are who you are that's why I
[1:21:12] love an infinite God my part may be so
[1:21:16] small in the kingdom of God but to an
[1:21:19] infinite God it's just as important
[1:21:23] as the biggest part in the kingdom of
[1:21:26] God because every part is a part of God
[1:21:31] himself if I had time that's a whole
[1:21:33] another subject he the infinite God he
[1:21:36] is an infinite God and because he's
[1:21:38] infinite the small means as much as the
[1:21:42] large that's what infinite
[1:21:45] means he's not just all powerful he's
[1:21:48] without
[1:21:49] limitation and you might feel like my
[1:21:53] little
[1:21:54] problem God doesn't really care about my
[1:21:57] little problem no your God is
[1:22:00] infinite and your little problem means
[1:22:03] just as much to God as the next person's
[1:22:06] big
[1:22:08] problem God you say well God doesn't
[1:22:11] have time to think about my little no
[1:22:12] your God is infinite amen there's no
[1:22:15] limitations on your God there's no such
[1:22:18] thing as a small issue he loves you and
[1:22:21] he cares about the least of your
[1:22:24] infirmities he's touched by the feelings
[1:22:26] of all of your infirmities he's a he's
[1:22:29] your great physici he's the one that
[1:22:32] overcomes all things and he's here to
[1:22:34] give you the Revelation that the curse
[1:22:36] of the word has already been paid for
[1:22:39] 2,000 years ago and you stand spotless
[1:22:42] in his sight because Christ died to
[1:22:45] redeem himself without spot without
[1:22:48] blemish without wrinkle or any such
[1:22:51] thing that's you amen and that's what
[1:22:55] you are in the sight of God you are a
[1:22:57] vital importance to
[1:23:01] him Lord help me to bring this
[1:23:04] home I can only I can think of a an
[1:23:07] example here in the Book of Numbers
[1:23:10] Chapter 5 we won't turn to it but
[1:23:12] there's something called The Law of
[1:23:15] jealousy and in the law of jealousy I
[1:23:18] think I have might have the scripture in
[1:23:20] these notes actually let me just
[1:23:23] fast forward to the
[1:23:28] end you see Christ has not just taken
[1:23:31] our punishment he's taken our
[1:23:35] guilt so that you stand Guiltless in the
[1:23:37] sight of God that's what justification
[1:23:39] is it's as though you never did it in
[1:23:41] the first place all right now in the in
[1:23:44] the law of jealousy Numbers Chapter 5
[1:23:45] and I'll paraphrase it for you if a
[1:23:47] husband thought that his wife had been
[1:23:49] unfaithful he was commanded to take his
[1:23:51] wife to the priest and the priest was
[1:23:53] given a a certain Commandment that they
[1:23:56] would take some of the dust from the
[1:23:57] floor of the Tabernacle and they would
[1:23:59] put it in water and they would write the
[1:24:02] the words of a curse upon uh a piece of
[1:24:06] parchment or whatever it was and then
[1:24:08] they would take a cloth or a sponge or
[1:24:11] something and they would take the water
[1:24:12] and blot out the curse and put it back
[1:24:15] into the water but then they would make
[1:24:17] the woman drink the water okay and it
[1:24:20] was bitter Waters and so that and I'm
[1:24:22] just paraphrasing it not going into all
[1:24:24] the details but so that th the W when
[1:24:26] the woman drank this water it was
[1:24:27] commandment was given to her that if you
[1:24:30] have been unfaithful to your husband
[1:24:31] when you drink this water your stomach
[1:24:33] will will uh rot your thigh will rot
[1:24:37] you'll become basically unhealthy and
[1:24:39] your your life will be nothing but a
[1:24:41] miserable uh curse and you'll eventually
[1:24:44] die that was the law of the curse of
[1:24:47] jealousy and so she was commanded they
[1:24:50] wrote the words out they were blotted
[1:24:52] out put in the water she drank the water
[1:24:56] and she was commanded to say Amen to the
[1:24:59] word of
[1:25:00] God if I am guilty of this Amen to the
[1:25:04] words of that
[1:25:05] curse and so was a powerful powerful
[1:25:08] thing and that in itself is a terrible
[1:25:11] thing until you consider one thing no
[1:25:15] matter what we have done in the sight of
[1:25:17] God Jesus took our
[1:25:20] guilt we stand Guiltless because of the
[1:25:24] sacrifice of Jesus Christ and so the
[1:25:27] words of the curse of this book are of
[1:25:31] no
[1:25:32] effect now we stand innocent as a woman
[1:25:36] who had never committed adultery and so
[1:25:39] now a woman that knows she never did
[1:25:41] anything wrong when the priest wrote the
[1:25:44] words and blotted out the words and gave
[1:25:47] her the water to drink and all of those
[1:25:48] things she knew she had never done
[1:25:50] anything wrong she could stand there and
[1:25:53] say Amen if i' done anything wrong so be
[1:25:56] it to me according to the words of the
[1:25:58] curse because she knew she stood
[1:26:01] Guiltless she knew it would have no
[1:26:04] effect on her CU she was Guiltless now
[1:26:06] all of the curse of the word of God has
[1:26:09] been eaten up by the sacrifice of Jesus
[1:26:12] Christ so that you can stand here this
[1:26:14] evening as the Bride of Jesus Christ and
[1:26:17] no matter what you have done look at
[1:26:20] Calvary and say I accept what Jesus did
[1:26:23] for me at Calvary and no matter what the
[1:26:26] devil tells me of how bad everything
[1:26:28] that I did I don't have faith in what I
[1:26:30] did I have faith in what he
[1:26:33] did I have faith in the sacrifice of
[1:26:36] Jesus Christ so I can take the book and
[1:26:40] I can eat the book hallelujah hallelujah
[1:26:44] no wonder the angel said to John take
[1:26:46] the book eat the book the book is open
[1:26:50] eat the book The Mysteries contained in
[1:26:52] the book are your
[1:26:54] Mysteries that God could reveal himself
[1:26:56] to you personally and it will become a
[1:26:59] part of your life not because of your
[1:27:02] good works but because of what Christ
[1:27:04] did for you you stand spotless in his
[1:27:10] sight and there's a scripture I'd never
[1:27:13] noticed the scripture before I was in
[1:27:14] you someone sent me a video of the of
[1:27:18] some I think it was baptisms or
[1:27:20] something in a church in Uganda and the
[1:27:22] one of the ministers had wrote this
[1:27:24] scripture on his Pulpit on his Pulpit
[1:27:27] right across the front of his Pulpit
[1:27:29] there right at the bottom it's from
[1:27:31] Jeremiah
[1:27:33] 15:16 and it says this thy words were
[1:27:36] found and I did eat
[1:27:39] them and Thy Word was unto me the joy
[1:27:43] and rejoicing of my
[1:27:45] heart for I am called by thy name oh
[1:27:51] lord of host
[1:27:53] the word has been found and I did eat
[1:27:57] them the curse had been announced and I
[1:28:00] wasn't scared to eat it the death angel
[1:28:03] rote out and I wasn't scared to catch
[1:28:06] the Revelation this world is falling
[1:28:09] apart denomination is dying that's why
