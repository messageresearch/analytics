TRANSCRIPT
========================================
preparation Luke chap 10 start with verse 30 and Jesus answering said a certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho and fell among Thieves which stripped him of his rment and wounded him and departed leaving him half dead and by chance there came down a certain priest that way and when he saw him he passed by on the other side and likewise a levite when he was at the place came and looked on him and passed by on the other side amen you may be seated we appreciated brother brother Michael jumping in and leading songs I thought he did a tremendous job and just uh loved the the uh the worship of the people and his efforts in and and leading songs and there's a several that are out this evening and that's why um different ones have been thrust into different roles but I think that's uh one of the things that church affords US is an opportunity to serve and gives opportunities for certain gifts and uh and talents and efforts that people would want to put forth that's I really think that's what church is for is not just for one man to stand up before you and tell you everything he knows out of the message but opportunities for all of us points of service and opportunities for our gifts to be cultivated and grown so we appreciate brother Michael stepping up out of his comfort zone he says but he stepped out of stepped out and helped out tonight we're so appreciative of it we're looking at uh the title has been who is my neighbor uh that's the question question that is asked before Jesus goes into this story of the parable that we call the parable of the Good Samaritan and we're actually looking at relationships among the characters in this Parable because it's it's more as we said last time it's more than just the man going down from Jerusalem to Jericho in this Samaritan that helps him out there's other actors that um present themselves and make themselves known so we have a certain man that went down from Jerusalem to Jericho we have thieves which we could look at as a group of people then we have a a certain priest a levite we have the Samaritan and then we even have a host so there's different relationships among these parties and different relationships between specific ones and we're looking at them just so that we can be challenged in many different ways from this Parable by the word of God and I believe that every detail is significant that as Jesus begins to answer this lawyer's question of who is my neighbor he takes great care in referencing even going from Jerusalem to Jericho he takes care in mentioning that it's a certain priest and that it's a levite and that it's a Samaritan and then even a host all these characters and these actors that present themselves in this parable are to uh get this lawyer's attention and cause him to think more deeply about even what he had said when he said well the the law says if I love the Lord with all my mind soul and body and if I love my neighbor as myself then I have eternal life and Jesus says hey you've said pretty good that's good the lawyer then says well who is my neighbor seeking to justify himself and so I mention that again because I'm wanting to go specifically into some of these characteristics of the certain man because Jesus was wanting this lawyer to think more deeply now about what a neighbor is and then I think he's wanting him to think more deeply even about himself not just consider who his his neighbor might be but think more about himself and how he views himself and how his self viw influences his view of others and so we looked at last time how a man going down from Jerusalem to Jericho was one going down from a place that is blessed to a place that is cursed going down from a place which is uh the peace and God a place where God's worship was and and all the things that we could share or Express about Jerusalem it's significant it's a beautiful place it's situated in the mountains and uh how this would be a a place of God's presence a place of Temple worship and now he's going down from this blessed place a place that God has identified himself with and he's traveling down to a cursed place a place called Jericho and we mentioned how that we can all relate to this man as humankind that every man is born in sin uh that are we have no righteousness of our own and by our natural birth we're born between brother Bram says between Satan and Eve so we can't come out of the womb bragging and then even as we're raised by Perfect parents which my children could testify to not being raised by Perfect parents but uh even if we are raised by Perfect parents we can't brag we can't say wow I'm doing good I'm doing wonderful we all are born into this world as Sinners under a cursed it's even a curse that comes with that birth as the Bible says it's appointed unto one man once to die and then after that judgment so we all we all face the Judgment because of our sin and we can relate to this man as being representative of all humankind which fell with Adam but then brother brandham placed this man as one that was backsliding and he uses this several times where he says this is a man that had fallen from Jerusalem and was on his way to Jericho so he' fallen from that high place and has now going down to a low PL low place and these are just a few statements here at the outset um just to kind of reestablish where we are and and to go back over this and I I I do I do take my time and and prayer and before the Lord just to be sure that I'm just not going over things because there's material there uh and and but I tried to be very sensitive to the leadership of the Holy Spirit and I think it's wonderful when you can take your time and just keep looking at the same thing over and over again and realize just how much depth there is to it and how the word of God can take even just one statement one statement in the Bible and we can revisit it over and over and over again and it mean different things to us I'm sure you've all done that with scripture where you had a favorite scripture and you loved that scripture and you loved it because it really meant something to you at a particular time in your life and then many years go by in that same scripture comes from a different angle and means something even more to you in a different time in life and so we're we may be looking at something over and over and over again and if that if that frustrates you just let me know don't let anybody else know just let me know and we'll be sensitive to how the Lord is dealing with your hearts and what the desires of the people are but I'm I'm just using a few things in the beginning to lay a foundation and then I'm just going to stay right back in the same area that we've been but brother Bram says he was on his road backsliding when he fell among Thieves and robbers that stripped him and so that's how the prophet placed this man he placed him as a backslider on his road from Jerusalem on his road backsliding so it's a process it's not that when he stepped foot outside of Jerusalem boom immediately he's fully backslid but he looks at maybe a spectrum of backsliding and he's falling away from Jerusalem to Jericho and then he he uses this to really challenge us he says and that's when you fall among Thieves and robbers when you start backsliding away from God just expect the enemy to be along the road so you depart from some place of safety and it is true that this bride cannot fall I was fellowshipping with brother Chad Lamb last week and he shared something with me that just kind of got me all stirred up I was thinking how in the world am I not going to get away get away from this and not preach this but he was just fellowshipping on how that uh it really struck him how that God said he placed Adam and Eve behind the word in the beginning Adam and the woman were behind the word so they could walk out from behind the word word placed behind it as a protection so they could leave it he said but now in the end time brother Bron makes this statement that it's not that we're and using summary language now it's not that we're placed behind the word but we are the word and because we are the word we can't fail because we are the word we we we can't get out from uh get out from behind it we are the word so I say that to say that you are absolutely secure in Christ as a Christian as a Christian who's born again which means you're filled with the Holy Ghost you're secure in Christ as the as being positionally placed in the body of Christ through the through the spirit baptism then then you're secure you can't lose your salvation uh but there is now a a measure wherein we can grieve the Holy Spirit and walk out from Beyond the blessings of what that position in Christ affords us so brother B says that when you are getting away from God and you're backsliding from God you make yourself vulnerable to thieves and robbers in your position under the headship of the word you you you're fortified you have protection but when you come out from behind that uh get away from that protection and you step outside of that uh uh that safety of the word of God you make yourself vulnerable not your salvation but your spiritual well-being your thought process your thought life the way that you interact and think of others and so I thought about it today how that every place that I read including in the parable and even as brother bradam dealt with it he says that here's a man backsliding and I just I hope you can fellowship with me in this thought and not think I'm trying to be mean but here's a man that's backsliding and then robbers seize upon him they strip him and they take his whatever value valuables he may have had and they he leaves them on the side of the road and I thought what Grace that God would catch us on our road to Jericho and stop us before we get there even if it has to be at the hand of Thieves what Grace it is when God stops the believer on his way down from Jerusalem to Jericho and I thank God all the times in my life if I ever got away from Jerusalem and it sure look like I was headed to Jericho but God has a way of stopping the believer on his way to Jericho why you're not ordained to go to the cursed place you're you're not a person of that that is cursed you're not someone that's going to have your place in the cursed City but rather God has an expected end that he's bringing you to and it's the grace of God many times when we're stepping away from where we ought to be we've stepped outside of the prot ction of God's word and we're met with difficulty Calamity whatever it might be and it's the grace of God that the robber sees upon us why it's his grace that stops us from making it all the way to Jericho and I think it's wonderful just to ponder that and think that nowhere do I find where brother brandham or Jesus placed this man all the way in Jericho but something stopped him on his way and backsliding is no indication of a lack of election it's easy for us to surmise that if someone backslides we immediately begin to question their experience and then we begin to question their election and it's important that we not engage in those assessments or those judgments the question whether or not someone is elect uh but rather we you can we have discernment when someone is backsliding so we know that they need to be ministered particularly they need to be met in a certain way they need to be we need to address whatever difficulty they're going through but we never recognize backsliding as an opportunity to say oh they may not be elect or or they um they've never had an experience with God the very phrase backsliding assumes that someone has had some experience with God some position some place of worship some place with Christ and now they're falling away from it and I'm wanting to back up from where we were last week right at the very beginning when brother Brandon was talking about backsliding and we were looking at even the meaning of to be backslid and there's ways that we can backslide where it's of our own accord we make decisions we Harden our hearts we we Fellowship around the wrong things we we feed our Spirits with the wrong kind of things and it causes us to backslide from from where we ought to be in our spirit and our relationship with God but then the word backslid also in the Bible speaks of one being repulsed or driven away so there's uh there's outside factors sometimes that cause people to backslide and I'm wanting to look at this backsliding uh from different angles tonight because it's easy to misunderstand what it means to backslide whether it be our opinion of somebody else or whether our own misconceptions about oursel and so it's important I wanted just to look at this subject of backsliding a little bit differently brother bam when he preaches demonology in the Physical Realm he says now cancer what is that fellow what does he represent now if you could just really focus intently tonight um on this I actually put my notes in a bigger sized font so that I would fill up more pages and not go too far I say no I can't go past a page that's going to be so I'm going to try to be short tonight and and that's not hard for a guy who's barely 5'8 and so he says what does what does this cancer fellow represent he's a scavenger he represents the vulture he eats dead things and a cancer now Focus now a cancer comes from a bruise mostly where cells been hit and it breaks up now instead of trying to think wellow is that really how a cancer is and is that where science is today let's not worry about where Medical Science places at today brother Brandon was seeing a truth he he he saw truth in our spiritual lives he saw truth in in reality according to God's word and he's using science as a type or an example of how that may be or how that works and so I want you to catch more the spiritual application here instead of getting caught uh maybe caught on the science of it he says a bruise is it comes from a bruise mostly where a cell's been hid and it breaks up and a little cell in there becomes backslid he says now notice this little cell backslides when it's bruised amen now the cell didn't bruise itself something bruises the cell so I'm going to take that to show again that many times there's there's though whether it be ourselves or those that we love they backslide because they've been bruised something hits their their Spirit something harms them in their human Spirit something causes a scar a wound or a complex and the wrong kind of image many times of the Bible the wrong kind of image of Christ is used in a way to harm somebody and so they have they have a a a trigger in their heart so they feel they look at something Church they can look at church as being a toxic environment they could look at the things pertaining to Christ being uh utensils of abuse and control and manipulation and so this person backslides not because they in their hearts had rejected God but because they become a little cell that is bruised and then he says it begins and now this is the picture I thought was so beautiful other little germs run forth to give its lives in there and that's where pus comes in the sore now he's just talking about maybe even any kind of wound he said that's teeny little soldiers fighting for your life they run up there and hit that poison them demon powers trying to collect in their and give their lives they are a bunch of little dead soldiers that give their life to save yours isn't that a beautiful picture of how that here brother bam describes in the physical now how that cancer is a scavenger and and he's a nasty little fellow but how he begins is he's bruised and so when the cell is bruised and it begins to break down and this cancer begins to form and brother calls these little demon powers rushing in there trying to collect in there he says there's these other little germs in the body that race to that bruised cell and they begin to provide support to it begin to try to um to fight the infection and fight off and fend off the cancer and brother and says they're running in they giving their lives to save yours and as I pondered uh the the example of a of a person backsliding because they're bruised and and and someone fallen from their position because of external factors and disappointments in life I thought about this analogy and I figured where do we fit into this this uh into this scheme if we're thinking of a cell that is bruised is one that is backslid and then there's demon powers that begin to fight in them there little soldiers that run in to get a fight against it maybe you can identify yourself as the BR bruised I know all of us could probably think in one time in our lives where we were the bruised uh but do you also identify as the Bruiser I don't think any of us want to be the Bruiser as we said last week don't be a thief H none of us want to be the Bruiser but are are but could we be the bomb you have the bruised and you have the Bruiser and if you're neither the bruised or the Bruiser maybe you could be the bomb you could be those little teeny soldiers you may not be much but you're rushing in you're heading in there to impact this cell that has been backslid this cell that has been bruised this cell that has fallen away and you don't oh we don't have any need of you you're good for nothing see you later don't let the door hit you on the way out no you there's something instinctive inside of you that doesn't want to let go reaches out and so we want to challenge ourselves tonight to to if we are the bruised then to welcome the Healer to welcome the healing that Christ can give H and if we've been the Bruiser we looked last week we ought to make it right but then I believe that Christ has called the body of his own body and called the church to be those who have a bomb those who have a Ministry to heal those have a Ministry of reaching out and addressing the needs in families and in people's lives and applying this word of God that we have in this end time to see that lives can be changed and so man as we look at that example in the body backsliding can manifest itself in different ways and be for different reasons that's what we that's what I want you to gather from that statement just using that example of how a little cell backslides when it's bruised backsliding can happen for different reasons so we want to be very very careful about our attitude towards uh the backslider that's that's what Jesus is teaching who's my neighbor the lawyer asked so he talks about a man falling away from Jerusalem in these Pious men walking by and avoiding them and he's no doubt dealing with their attitude towards this one that's fallen and there there's no doubt in my mind that he's really challenging this lawyer on how he thinks about other people and how he's been able able to take the Gentile and just write them off he's been able to take the Samaritan and just write them off he's been able to take these people and place them in separate categories to where they're not worthy of of him being neighborly towards them and because he's written them off Jesus has a parable to tell to shake this person's senses and get them to ponder to think what it means to be neighborly and who we ought to be neighborly to we read uh uh in the beginning when we first started looking at this subject and and and it's kind of nice starting a church because when you say that it's just a few weeks ago it's not like well this was several years ago we preached on this well we could just go back a few weeks it was last month so I know we don't remember but in Galatians chapter 6 verse1 he says Brethren Paul writing Brethren if a man be overtaken in a fault I I see the image of this certain man going down from Jerusalem to Jericho if a man be overtaken in a fault if he seems to be backsliding if he's fallen from his position he's no longer walking in Victory there's something that has overcome him and overwhelmed him he now speaks to to ye which are spiritual so this addresses a very specific category of people a group of people ye which are spiritual restore such a one in the spirit of meekness we looked at last time how there was a saving of one a restoring of one uh reconciling one and it wasn't necessarily salvation initial salvation but one who's walked in the grace of God who's experienced salvation who knows the blessings of God who wanders away from those blessings that if you can restore that one back then there's you can save that person from that difficulty rescue them from the the the pit that they've fallen into there's a blessing reserved for you if you do that now he's speaking in this way if a man be overtaken in a fault the spiritual ones are to restore that one and then qualifies the manner in which you restore he says in the spirit of meekness so it's it's not restoration um at all cost in other words well do whatever you need to do uh if you need to be a brute if you need to lie if you need to cheat you need to steal you know whatever it takes to to save the cner and save the backslider no he said you've got to do it in a spirit of meekness you can't go after him and and claim to be uh uh trying to rescue their soul and and I'm just trying to help them and I'm trying to do them some good but yet you're you're abusing them in the process you're disregarding how sensitive a soul can be and their experience and what they're going through it's not rescue them at all cost it's restore them with the spirit of meekness and he says considering thyself considering your own self think about yourself as you restore this person restore such a one in the spirit of meekness considering thyself lest thou also be tempted so if we are to learn to be neighborly to others our judgment must be right if we're going to we ask the question who is my neighbor if we're going to learn who our neighbor is then we're going to have to have the right kind of discernment because he says considering thyself if you that are spiritual restore such a one with the spirit of meekness consider in thyself the reason why you ought to do it with meekness is your considering yourself contemplate your own Humanity think about your own weaknesses I know we don't like to do that but we ought to think about our own weaknesses contemplate our own uhh uh Humanity even consider our own past failures before we rush arrogantly into someone else's problem and begin to try to deal with it I think if we would just uh consider ourselves we would immediately go from confronting someone to addressing something right when you confront something the very fact that you're confronting something it's aggravated already that that that implies I'm going to meet this with some kind of force I'm already agitated I'm coming into this I'm going to confront it and it's aggressive and and it's hostile but if you address something something it's completely different so a spirit of meekness is the ability to address a difficulty not just confront it because if we if we confront a difficulty every I should get a big hearty amen so you're already primed get ready to clear your throats when we had when we conf front something what we begin to discuss from that moment on is the confrontation am when you confront an issue you're talking about the confrontation you're just talking about how this person raised their voice and how you're overreacting and how you're doing this and hours can go by and you're just talking about the confrontation you've never actually talked about the issue right and that's the difference that's something we can glean from this very scripture that when we want to consider our ownselves when we have a spirit of meekness we're going to go to address something not conf conf fronted and when we address something we can continue to address it and not deal with the Fallout of how we confronted it and so when we consider our own selves we contemplate our own weaknesses the fact that we failed before I've made that mistake I know what it's like to be in that pit I know what it's like to go down from Jerusalem and be accosted on the way to Jericho I know what it's like to be discouraged I know what it's like to think well maybe I could just sit at home and play tapes or I know what it's like to to feel uncomfortable feel like you're alone and be rejected I know what that's like and then you begin to think become empathetic I know how that person feels I know what they must be going through and that's what will you can achieve the right kind of meekness to go to one who's been overtaken in a fault and this is what Paul picks right back up in verse three if for if a man think himself to be something when he is nothing he deceiveth himself right wow that is a mouthful if a man thinks he's something when in reality he's nothing he deceives himself self-conceit what Paul is addressing here when a man thinks himself to be something self-conceit hinders our sympathy and being unable to be sympathetic we can never be empathetic it hinders our sympathy and then it stops us from helping so he's saying ye if you see someone overtaken in a fault you who are spiritual restore them in the spirit of meekness consider yourselves because if you think yourself to be something when you're nothing you have deceived yourselves right and in De being deceived yourselves you can't be helpful to someone else remember the lawyer asked the question who is my neighbor and he asked it to justify himself why he had engaged in this very thing that Paul is saying you can't he thought himself to be something he began to think that he was better than everyone else when a man thinks himself to be something that means he's better than the one who's in Fault Paul said ye who are spiritual restore the one who's been overtaken in a fault but do it in a spirit of meekness consider your own selves think about yourselves because if you think yourself to be something if you think you're better than the one who's made the mistake you deceive yourself right if you think you're more spiritual not saying spiritual but if you think you're more spiritual than the one who made a mistake you deceive yourself if you think you're above making that mistake you deceive yourselves and this really depicts the attitude of that certain priest and the levite who walked by they walked by and as they walked by their judgments of this one were look at this guy look at the mess he got himself into and thought of all the times the hundreds of times they had walked that path because this is something that virtually every commentator will remark Jesus used these actors in This Parable because they would have been the ones that most frequented that road they would have been common Travelers on that road and here goes the priest by says I've traveled this way dozens of times and never ended up in that condition and the levite walks by and takes a look at him and says man how many times have I done this and I've never been befallen he must have acted in a way where he deserved it he probably was asking for it oh he's just reaping what he sowed and they had this attitude this Pious attitude as they walk by and you might say well Aaron you you're sure uh reading a lot into that Parable I just know what Jesus had to say about him before and after what did he always call them often call them Hypocrites yeah Matthew 23:13 but go to use scribes and Pharisees Hypocrites and he often remarked about the pious and the religious in that day how that they would the way that they acted was so hypocritical I was reading some of the burns that Jesus really put on them back then I thought man that is you might as well get out the ointment you don't have enough melaluca oil for that the just CU how he said it my the way that he was tearing into their attitude of how Pious they thought they were and how religious they figured they were and says man you to all ends of the Earth to make one proelite then you just make them twofold more trial of Hell after you're done right and he was he was calling out their hypocrisy says W unto you scribes Pharisees and hypocrites and the word hypocrite when it was used by Jesus it means actor it means a a stage player one who is on the stage acting one who's pretending one who does things for pretense but there's no substance it's all show it's only when they're on stage oh you make these great prayers in front of people and you always do things when everybody's watching and and and you're always putting on a show so the Optics look good and everybody thinks everything's holding everything's right and everything's charismatic and everything's moving on just right but when it's behind closed doors when you're all alone it doesn't matter then say what you want act how you want do what you want and everything's just on for show and he said this is the problem with these Pharisees this is the problem with the pious they they they they'll avoid the wided tombs but inside they're unclean even liken them to wided tombs and a hypocrite is one who is a pretender one who's just acting and so the challenge is if you're spiritual then think more deeply think think spiritually if you're spiritual think spiritually consider now how you would want to be treated consider how what what happened so that this person is in this situation that they're in instead of just berading them for that being in that condition instead of just rushing in and and giving an analysis of the crime scene maybe you could ask yourself what got them there how did they get there to begin with not not immediately begin to talk about why they're in the ditch and they're beat up and they're bloody but think begin to think something must have led them to this place there was a series of events there was things that happened that got them in the place where they are now it's not just that one day overnight someone makes the decision and their life ends up in ruin but if you're more sensitive to how a person got to where they were then you could be more Meek in the way that you would address the situation that they can be restored you're considering them by considering your own s and I in being spiritual then you could have you have the benefit of being able to be uh introspective look at your own self consider your own self when Paul says ye which are spiritual consider yourselves he's actually saying ye which are spiritual are really the only ones that have the ability to do so those who are not spiritual cannot look inside themselves cannot examine themselves cannot see themselves uh um under the magnifying glass of the of the word of God they're they're always uh inflating themselves they're always looking at themselves better than they ought to and so Paul is addressing the spiritual saying you are the ones who can consider yourselves so be spiritual enough to see your bias be spiritual enough to overcome your own Prejudice to uh to get over the stigma and and recognize the real need that's being presented because if you restore and and and this is how the scripture strikes me restore such a one in the spirit of meekness considering thyself lest thou also be tempted in other words if you restore without meekness then you will be tempted if you don't consider yourself and you don't restore the right way then you set yourself up for the Temptation yourself if if any of us have just a moment to reflect in our own lives we could probably think of an example when we were very quick to judge somebody else very quick to offer our help but do so incorrectly and find ourselves right in the same mess ourselves I'll use a I'll use an analogy that's that won't offend anybody you see a sister baking a cake you're like you're not supposed to do that you do that you're going to do this and this is going to happen the things it's it's not going to rise and it's you're going to make a big mess and you and then you walk away going oh it's like that sister's never been in a kitchen before you all sorts of things to say about them and then the very next time you go to make your cake what happens exactly what you said would happen to the other person's cake and you and I'm sure we could maybe maybe it wasn't a cake maybe it was putting up a tent or whatever it might be there's different things that we've done in our lives where we judge somebody and we laugh laugh at them we scoff at them maybe even we we really not very kind in the way that we address the situation and we turn right around and we're doing the same thing ourselves we're kind of like oh man don't I feel sheepish I I'm in the same mess this scripture is setting forth the principle that if you do not address somebody the right way and you do not uh when I in identifying one who's overtaken in a fault and if you think I've ventured far from this Parable the Good Samaritan we're thinking about a certain man who went down from Jerusalem to Jericho brother Bram place this one who as as one who is backsliding we as a church have a responsibility over those that backslide backsliding isn't the process where we sift out who seed and who's not backsliding is the way that we're like glad we got rid of them did you notice service was a little bit better tonight because those people weren't here that that's not that's not how we look at it we should have this Instinct in our hearts that we would want to see the backslider be given an opportunity to be restored not because of weakness but because of strength yes we desire that because we believe there is only one way of Salvation we don't walk the watch the backslider run off and go oh well maybe they'll find Salvation somewhere else we are gripped with a a hunger in our hearts a desire in our heart and a love for that person thinking oh my there is no other salvation there is no other Joy there no is no other bomb there is no other rest there will be no peace until they come back to this and so we don't look at somebody who's Fallen away with this attitude oh well we don't have any responsibility so this what I'm focusing on right now I haven't left my thought on who is your neighbor but I'm wanting you to ponder this if you don't approach something the right way you can't just run up to the the the the man on his way down from Jerusalem to Jericho and manhandle him and beat him and kick him around and mistreat him you've got to have the kind of care that Christ has because if you don't you set yourself up to be tempted in Job chapter 36 and13 it says but the Hypocrites in heart Heap up Wrath now that's powerful the hypocrite is storing up God's Wrath against them if we behave hypocritically if we haven't considered our own selves if we engage in judgment carnally then we're actually putting ourselves in the position to be judged ourselves Jesus says in Matthew 7: 1:5 judge not that you be not judged for with what judgment you judge ye shall be judged and with what measure you meet it shall be measured to you again I I I think that's plain language the way you judge somebody else is the way you're going to be judged whatever measuring stick you use to to say that something falls short you ought to be willing to measure yourself with the same stick because you will be and and That's a classic way that people will measure something say oh measure even measure the message and say oh it falls short because they apply the scientific method they apply some kind of thought discipline to it they say it falls short but they will not apply it to their own thought process if you're going to apply it to the message apply it to the Bible and so it's said whatever judgment you meet out it shall be measure to you again and why beholdest thou the moat that is in thy brother's eye but considerest not the beam that is in thy own eye I I I it may even be translated differently it's used in other places word there the moat it's a sliver just this the Splinter you're looking at your brother and you're like oh come here let me now come closer yeah what is that in your eye you've got a splinter in your eye and the Very language that's being projected here is that you are you're beholding the sliver the Splinter in your brother's eye but you haven't considered that you've got a 2x4 sticking out of yours you're getting right down there let me what what is that in your eye and the other guy's going whoa whoa watch out with that Tu by4 there watch out with that beam and that's the picture that Jesus is trying to paint he sometimes used this dramatic uh way of example just to get people to see you you can uh swallow a camel and strain on a net and so there's a way that he's wanting to get their attention you get hung up on a sliver in your brother's eye but you're not even considering J as Paul said consider thyselves but you consider not the beam that is in thy own eye or how wilt thou say to thy brother let me pull out the moat of thine eye and behold a beam is in thine own eye how can you be seen correctly how can you actually be judging and Discerning and figuring out there's a sliver in someone else's eye when you've got a beam in theirs in your own you have a beam in yours he says Thou hypocrite First cast out the beam out of thine own eye and then Thou shalt See Clearly cast out the moat out of thy brother's eye a that beautiful he he's not he's not setting forth a proposition that we ought not to uh remove someone's sliver from their eye he's not saying it's wrong to see when someone's in need it's not wrong to say that a brother has a a moat in their eye what he's saying is that you're are inable and inadequate when you're judging somebody else wrongly when you haven't judged yourself and dealt with your own weakness your own shortcomings and approach the situation with the right kind of spirit whatever judgment you meet out is a judgment you'll be judged with judge not that you be not judged for what judgment ye judge ye shall be judged Paul said if you don't do it in a spirit of meekness you will be tempted how many have heard the phrase that's like the pot calling the kettle black now I learn this till just a few years ago but that that phrase the pot calling the kettle black it stands for the truth that the pot is seeing its own reflection in the kettle it's not that the pot is black and the kettle's black and who's the pot to call the kettle black when they're both black but rather the pot is beholding its own blackness in the kettle oh wow it's seeing its reflection and looking over at the this shiny Kettle and since it sees itself it calls the kettle black not realizing it's its own Blackness wow and that's exactly what Jesus is talking about when someone looks at the moat the sliver in someone's eye and doesn't realize they have the beam in theirs maybe once the beam is removed from yours they might not have a sliver in theirs the pot calling the kettle black is seeing weakness in somebody else identify a problem in somebody else being willing to call it out but not realizing you're seeing your own weakness and your own problem and this is this is just part of humanity this isn't a condition that's unique to Christians it's not a condition that's unique to North America it's not a condition that's unique to any particular language this is Humanity all of us have this bias all of us have this weakness and as Paul is saying considering thy own self as we're looking at this hypocritical nature of even these Pharisees and these Levites as if we're if if we are going to be spiritual enough to be the right kind of neighbor then I want to look at this human nature for a moment just from a the scientific standpoint because it's very fascinating there's a number of studies that have been performed that show that individuals that would be you people like you and I consistently rate themselves above average compared to everyone else across many different spectrums and so you ask somebody a question are you more likely or less likely are you above average average below average and so you can ask a person a question and more often than not a person's going to think they're above average in many different categories when you ask them uh if they they they they they usually will take credit for successes but explain away failures the the common the average person does this they assume they're more likely than their peers to to experience the good things in life and avoid the bad so you could ask somebody brother are you more likely to avoid bad things in your life and experience good things or more likely to experience bad things and avoid the good things so oh I I generally can avoid bad things and experience good things how would you rate your ability to enjoy the good in life versus this brother's ability to enjoy oh I I do a much better job and that's what's being asked you'll take so that that project that was done uh um would you would you say that you were more likely the reason why it was so successful or would it be your brother's um worked oh no it was I really I really did a good job on that that was that was all mine the same group did this and failed so why did this fail oh well that wasn't me that was that guy's problem this is how we just act as humans we'll actually rate ourselves as more moral and less self-interested than others and there's many of many of these categories I could use just to get you thinking how that we typically see ourselves better than others just instinctively that if something succeeds we get the credit if something fails well it was somebody else's fault and these researchers have found that even if you explicitly explain this bias to people before prompting them about it they still claim they're less susceptible to that than others you say listen all right it's a human tendency and a human weakness to think that they're better than somebody else it's just a human mechanism in the mind it's a bias and not everybody's really conscious of it and so they tend to rate themselves better than somebody else so that's like a human problem so I'm going to ask you do you think you're better than somebody else and they like yeah yeah yeah I I do it's like they don't even even after they've been told they've been warned you have this weakness you have this problem it's still so ingrained in the thought process that even when they've been primed for it even when they've been prompted for it they'll still claim and they are you sure you're not just viewing yourself better because of this bi oh no no I I don't succumb to that bias no no that my now my brother on the other hand oh you should meet my sister she's really bad about that but me no no I'm I no I may have been adopted I don't know but everyone else in my family they've got that problem but me no I'm just uh just humble me you know just humble me yeah I don't have that problem again I just want to use some examples to get you thinking about this we're talking about who is my neighbor it's our perception of others how we deal with others how we deal with with difficulty in our own family with our with our loved ones with those that we're in fellowship with we're part of a broader Community you realize that right we're we're we're more than just people who gather from our places of work and our houses to a place of worship and and we have church here no we are we are part of a broader Body of Christ in Arizona there's dozens of churches we have a responsibility in that context we have a responsibility in the context of those who naming the name of Christ do you realize we claim to be Christi our own bad behavior puts a bad mark on everyone else who claims to be a Christian amen and we want to point our fingers at the denominations all day long and say well they do this and they do that how have we how have we in our own behavior and attitude towards others profane the name of Christianity and the public opinion poll of Christians in Maricopa Valley is going down not because the Baptist but because of us wow we represent that we we're we're part of a much broader community that this isn't a secret society this isn't Dungeons and Dragons or whatever else there is these days and we're not just playing uh you know World of Warcraft in our basements and part of this a group a secret clan that nobody knows about we disperse from here and we're part of many different communities on many different levels we have a responsibility to them to think correctly to act correctly to judge correctly and as we're we're just looking at this human weakness just to reinforce this an example of how that we think about ourselves uh in a more positive light and we're susceptible to this bias take a personality test anybody taking a personality test before an assessment test what happens whenever the we get the results from the assessment test we always agree with the Positive attributes they a leader a problem solver willing to help others we're like oh my goodness gracious how did they know me I thought this was Anonymous and you're just like this is amazing how they can pinpoint this you're even looking around going look at this Vindication I can't believe born leader this that and then it and then you go to the negative attributes impatient doesn't work well with others oh yeah yeah no and you immediately begin to deny or reject the the results of the test we only focus on the positive things and agree with it and then we actually deny the negative attributes so we all agree the personality test with the personality test when it says all the positive things about us but we disagree the negative things and maybe you haven't done a personality test but you'll do it with your birth sign oh I'm Aquarius Aquarius or this and they that and they're this and they're that and then they're this and they're that like well you know I'm on this side of the moon and I'm on this side of the Sun and I was I'm a late Aquarius I'm I'm an earlier one you know or my new birth changed all of that but the truth is if we're going to take the good you got to take the bad now I'm not delving in those things I I I'm just mentioning them I'm just referring to them will even do it with the meaning of a name right a name could mean wonderful orator and you're like yeah that's perfect or it could mean big mouth and like well no it doesn't actually mean big mouth it's the human tendency to focus on the positive and willing to embrace it as being descriptive and applicable to us but where we immediately reject or deny anything that's corrective anything that's disagreeable anything that would be considered to be negative that's just human nature and they have a phrase for it within maybe the uh behavioral side of Behavioral economic side it's called a bias blind spot and it's a tendency to spot a problem in others while denying it in ourselves and so we this biased blind spot means that you can see something and you see a problem in someone or you allege a problem but when it comes to you and so now it's turned around you say well this person doesn't do this well and then the questions Point upon you well do you do it well and you're well absolutely I do it well what they're saying is this there's a tendency to in somebody else see a weakness and somebody else see a problem but not see it in ourselves and I was going to provide uh slides this evening but just just felt like I wouldn't want to get um drawn into it but our our natural eye both eyes both natural eyes have physical blind spots that means there's a part in actual optic the hard wiring of your ey uh in to the brain there's a spot that's just not covered and so there's um there's a there's different tests you could do to show what how this how this blind spot works you could put on a piece of paper like a little red dot and you can move this piece of paper towards you to where it gets in the peripheral vision and there's a point at which that red dot will disappear but you don't see a hole your eye uses all the information around that red dot and fills in the blank because your ey actually is not getting any information from that spot anymore it's a it's a literal blind spot in your periphery and you don't have a black spot there your brain actually says well there's this around it and that around it and it actually fills it in for you so that you don't see a hole so our minds are wired to fill in the blanks where we don't see something and so our our brain provides an illusion to us that there's actually not a blind spot and so the mind will hide mental blind spots from us so that it Fs in the picture and it makes the picture complete so in a in a natur in a judgment sense in a in a sense in which we would look at others not in a physical sight sense in a periphery having blind spots but this biased blind spot is born from the tendency to assume that all things are just exactly as we perceive them but a lot of times our brain is just filling in information you don't know that you've just assumed that you've just added that in Proverbs 16:2 says all the ways of man are clean in his own eyes it says all the ways of man are clean in his own eyes in other words whatever A man does he can easily justify it whatever he says whatever he does wherever he goes how he uses his money what he thinks about other people what he experiences what he puts his money behind whatever it is all the ways of man are clean in his own eyes he can justify everything he does but it says but the Lord weth the spirits amen and a bias this kind of bias this kind of weakness in our Humanity will allow us to create a distinction between our problems and somebody else's problems and not a positive one because it it blurs the discrepancy between what we know to be right and our actions with this biased blind spot you could be acting absolutely contrary to your own moral convictions but you don't see it and you take this moral Spectrum this moral Paradigm this moral prism and you impose that view on everybody else but you yourself do not act in harmony with it but the bias biased blind spot keeps you from seeing that you yourself are not even behaving according to your own moral code this is how one book that I'd read many years ago it said the brain is des designed with BR blind spots Optical and phys psych psychological it's actually would be um so it's Optical and psychological so it's the actual ual process of seeing sight and they describe it very well in terms that it's the Optics it's actually in the hard wiring that creates the blind spot but then there's a visual component where your brain is interpreting it and feeling in the void so he says our brain is designed with blind spots not just Optical but psychological and one of its cleverest tricks is to confer on us the comforting delusion that we personally do not have any that that's that's what the this this bind blind spot actually gives us is a sense that we don't have a blind spot that's nasty isn't it the blind spot this blind spot in you actually has the ability or the the the the Fallout from it is it gives us this comforting delusion that we do not have any blind spots they use the phrase We deceive ourselves the human brain deceives itself it plays a trick on you now it's doing it for your own good do you realize even if you move around the room like this that the your your brain actually creates order and is adjusting the images and creating making a very static smooth image because if you actually seeing it the way the ey is processing it you'd get dizzy it would just be a blur it wouldn't even make any sense that's just how hard your brain works to make things s make sense of things but then there's actually a way when trying to make sense of things that works against you because this psychological blind spot actually confers upon you this comforting sense this comforting delusion that I don't see things the wrong way I perceive everything perfectly I don't have any blind spots and Paul said to the Corinthians 1 Corinthians 3:18 let no man deceive himself we ought to Avail ourselves to a greater spiritual power no wonder Paul said ye who are spiritual consider your own s we take the spirit of Christ which is in us and we examine ourselves we take the word of God through humility and we examine ourselves what we're what we're pondering is our attitude towards backsliding what we're looking at is even our awareness of backsliding in order to be neighborly and also to be considering ourselves in doing so I read this statement one time there's probably no such thing as a conscious hypocrite that makes sense doesn't it probably no such thing as a conscious hypocrite almost everyone can see a hypocrite in action except the hypocrite and it's what's the point brother Aaron what would be the point of even talking about the blind spots any one of you who drive a car you can't avoid having a blind spot what's important is that you're aware of them and a good driver is aware of his blind spots and therefore knowing that he has blind spots always takes the extra measure to be sure that he's acted in a way that's covered the blind spot not just quickly glancing here and there filling in the void filling information but he realizes I've got blind spots what's The Prudent thing to do when I have a blind spot a good driver acts in Awareness that there are blind spots so he'll take the extra turn he'll take the extra care he'll use his signal he won't just rely on certain information that's being fed to him he takes the extra step to be sure that his blind spot is covered you following me so far amen all right I'm going to I want to read three just a few stat to you I said three maybe four here quotes and the Lord just has been piecing these together of the last month or so as we studied this and I just saw the Holy Spirit begin to weave them together because we're talking about our attitude and our awareness of backsliding and I'd want you to be aware of our own or for us myself to be aware when when are we the bruised when are we the Bruiser am I spiritual enough to be the bomb brother Brown in the message a secondhand robe he said on the onto Jordan they went talking about Elijah and Elisha and we we type the Bride As Elisha right he said they crossed over and Elijah said now what will you do what you what will you that I do for you he said a double portion of your spirit to come upon me he knowed he had a work to do he said a double portion now he says not just a good warm experience not just a good handshake or good fellowship with the rest of the church but what I want is a double portion of what the best what's the best now this ought to be our attitude I don't want to just a warm experience a good handshake a good fellowship with the rest of the church I want a double portion of what's the best thing is now he says I tell you when God sets a man for a world task he's got to have something better than the world's got if God's going to commission us if God's going to send us out then he's got to give us something better than the world's God right and if there's ever was a time that a double portion is needed it's today in the Realms of the people now this is his language something better something higher this isn't a shame to say this this isn't this isn't this shouldn't be a reproach to say I want something better I want something higher I want something more this ought to be the heart's Cry of every believer this ought to be the ambition of a fellowship this ought to be the ambition of a minister this ought to be an ambition in the home we haven't leveled off we haven't planed there's higher Heights there's greater depths there's there's things we can experience he says something better something higher he says I think Beans and Cornbread is very good but sometimes I have to reach up a little higher is't that wonderful Beans and Cornbread is very good but sometimes I have to reach up a little higher and we do that we've got to we've got to keep climbing something better something higher reach a little higher than what you've been eating on reach a little higher than how you've been fed he says we've got to we've got to keep climbing and this is the statement Israel was backsliding if they kept staying on the same grounds he's got to be moving on or moving back that's the way the church is if you're not moving on you're moving back so if you're staying in the same place in brother bram's words you're backsliding I I shared that not that we would use uh the Pitchfork right we come to church with the rake a pitchfork so that whenever the Hay's been given out you're like oh that was perfect for sister Elizabeth oh well yeah that sister's here oh yeah brother Scott here you go God bless you brother no you you have a rake bring it in onto you there and I needed that we look at our own selves if we are stagnated if we are going in circles brother B says you're backslid right he says you're either going on you're either moving or moving back we don't want to stay in the same place going around in circles this is a message whose trajectory takes You Higher and Higher and Higher and Higher stay in the rhythm of the word get in sync with the Sy Symphony walk in it it'll keep raising You Higher and Higher and Higher so we challenge ourselves Lord am I growing am I walking am I walking in light as you are in the light sometimes we get out of fellowship with somebody am I walking in the light as he is in the light because if I walk in the light as he is in the light then we have Fellowship one with another it's then that the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from all our sins all of our unrighteousness as we stay in the in the pattern in the pace in the gate of the word we have to be going forward we've got to he says we've got to keep climbing if we're not climbing we're backsliding and that's is this is just one way that we can challenge ourselves because brother bram's taken this realm of backslide and he's taking it out of this uh the the the analytics of saying well you used to attend church 3. six times a month now you're attending 3.2 times a month therefore according to our parameters and our data is telling us you're backslid and we got this algorithm and we' put NFC chips in all of your Bibles so that we can keep track I'm like sister Elizabeth print out a backslide report this month and like we're just like ah no look at this guy no it's it's more it's it's a spiritual atmosphere here all if we not going forward it's not that you've stopped doing this and you've stopped doing that and you're no longer doing this and you you used to go to church all the time you used to pay your ties you used to listen to this you used to do that no it's not this going back into the world it's not just beginning to doubt it's it's actually in our own spiritual life when we stagnate and we're all familiar with that feeling amen we know what it's like yeah and that's the time when we need to we need to uh experience a Reviving right and if you were in that state you'd want someone to approach you with meekness and then brother brandham addresses backslide in a very unique way and I I I feel like with the church as seasoned as you as Believers because it's the Believers that make up the church this is something that you could really catch we ought not to be more concerned about what other people think than we are about displeasing God because we're we're pondering the mental devices that influence the lawyer to judge himself as being blameless to the law but then asking in a justifying way well then who really who is my neighbor think about the mental uh uh devices that influenced the priest and kept him from rendering Aid the mental devices that actually caused the levite to go up and go and look come close and then walk away what were those processes those mental devices going on in their minds and that they couldn't overcome these things and render Aid this Parable challenges see you can just my alarm clock went off so I know I know now I've been too long this Parable challenges our judgments it really does it's more than just a story about oh isin't that Samaritan good let's call this the parable of the Good Samaritan it's more than that it challenges our own judgments it challenges our perceptions that influence our actions and what am I thinking what's going through my mind how am I arriving at these conclusions how are those thought processes keeping me from behaving like Christ these these details in this parable are significant because it challenges the believer who's coming into the image of Christ if we're going to be more Christlike we've got to be able to be challenged in such a way that we're honest with ourselves and willing to change right amen brother bam makes this statement in the church and this title to me is what it sealed it to me in catching what brother bam was saying here the church choosing law for Grace he says we notice after all the blessings had come to Israel they wanted to have a law choosing law over Grace they wanted to have something that they could do themselves this is going to be your human nature to want to have something you can put your finger on that makes yourself right some Sabbath days they could keep or some ordinance they could do or something another that was brought into them that they could do themselves and if you can do one thing to save yourself there there's not one Speck of Grace of it Grace not one Speck of it Grace if you could do something to save yourself law is what you do in regards to the grace that God has showed you by Saving you that's I think that's perfect what it works works don't save us but works works are is the outflow of a saved Soul amen so he's saying law or works is what we do in regards to the grace that has been shown to us because I am saved there's a there's a law that I can keep because I am saved there's a path that I can walk in because I am saved there's a works that I can do he says I've as I've often said I don't run around with other women he says I do not I don't run around with other women because I'm afraid my wife will divorce me and I think he's saying I do not not run around he said I Not Afraid my wife will divorce me so I don't run around he says I don't run around with women other women cuz I love my wife that's it so it's not that I don't run around with other women because I'm afraid that my wife will divorce me I don't believe that you should run around so I don't run around with other women only because I'm afraid my wife will leave me I don't run around with other women because I love my wife he said that's it I don't believe that you should run around but a law isn't what keeps me from it right my marriage vow my marriage vow it's law isn't what keeps it my marriage vow it's my love amen and that's the reason I love God not because I'm afraid he'll send me to hell I don't believe that he would do that but because I love him so much I don't want to do it there's nothing in me to make me do it I love him too much I wouldn't hurt him for nothing certainly I love him right now this is is where these biases and these Tendencies and these ways that our mind will work we ought to be more concerned about displeasing God than what others think and this this priest and this levite refused to act more likely out of what the perception would be and what the outward Optics would be other than what they knew the heart of the law required them to do and brother B saying that Israel chose the law over Grace and in choosing law there could not be Grace but us being the recipients of Grace we can Avail ourselves to Grace therefore we can be gracious and we don't just have a law that we impose upon others because we have experienced Grace we can walk in the law if somebody else has fallen from Grace we just don't have a law at our disposal to render Aid to them and he talking about it's not my marriage vow that keeps me from cheating on my wife it's actually my love amen and now watch how he de how he moves forward in this certainly I love him because he says the reason why I serve God is because I love him not because I'm afraid of hell and when men and women get to a place and this is the thought process well I really ought to stay at home and see this good play tonight but I'll tell you they'll think I'm backslid if I don't go on down to church that that's a mouthful that's real that's real Discerning brother brandom I don't really want to go to church but if I don't I'll be preached against I don't really want to go to church but if I don't if I don't go they'll they'll know I'm not at church they'll think I'm backslid they'll start texting me they'll hit me up on Snapchat and next thing you know I'm having to deal with all this fall back Fallout because I didn't go to church so I'll just go to church because I don't want to be a hypocrite that's a horrible thought process before you go to church and it's brother brandom who identifies it I should stay home and watch TV tonight I should stay home and watch Netflix I should stay home tonight I don't really want to go but they'll think I'm backslid if I don't go down to church now with that thought process in mind the person's afraid of being perceived as backslid but ask yourselves aren't they all ready right right so brother bam says and you sat there and sleep anyhow you might as well stayed home and looked at something you'd enjoy more woohoo wow that hits hard and the and the way that I wanted us to process it is how the back the the thought process well if I don't go I'm backslid you're already backslid in your thinking what a horrible way to approach church that I'm just going so that nobody you know the attendance takers you know don't Mark me as absence and then brother Aaron's going to run the report at the end of the month and I'm going to be on the back slid list cuz I fall out of the algorithm that says you got to be there you got to be car do you carry a 4.0 H what are you carrying on Sundays I made Magna cumladi in our church attendance last month this isn't Sunday school we don't have a you know a board with a bunch of stars somebody was apologizing to me because they missed church I said look we're here to serve not take attendance and I think we need to really be challenged in the way that we think sometimes and if I could say this to us let's never create the kind of culture where somebody shows up to church because they don't want to be looked down upon by us let's create the kind of culture that when somebody's at home thinking about watching something that they would enjoy they remember the love that they're shown here and they'd rather be here in this environment around the people of God who love them and don't judge them and they come am let's not create the kind of culture that puts the pressure on people to perform and to achieve a certain status and to live a certain way to where they just fall right in line and they everyone's doing the thing that they ought to do but what are they we're all just Hypocrites we all just gather on the stage of Arizona believer church and we all just play our part and then we go home and we don't live overcoming lives and we're discouraged and we're not being living fulfilled and all the Fallout that comes from that let's not make that mistake says you and you sit there and sleep anyhow you might as well stay home and look at something you'd enjoy more isn't it wonderful to hear this quote on a Wednesday night when you're here then he says but when your joy becomes the Lord and the Lord is your joy you can't stay away from the church then you're getting somewhere right he said the church was in better shape 40 years ago for the coming to Lord Jesus than it is tonight way better they were closer to God they had more God among them they had more Spirit among them than they got tonight and what's the dynamic that brother brandham identified the pressure at church and the hypocrisy of the individual the attitude well if I don't show up they'll think I'm backslid now they weren't wrong about that right brother R said they weren't wrong but there was something wrong in their own experience where they backslid already brother Bram says in the message thirst sister Elizabeth if you could come and play this creates the expectation of a closeth when you ask the musician to come now I could have already told her honey it's going to be about 20 minutes of you playing but I've created this expectation now he's closing now and since brother Michael did a wonderful job I got an extra 10 minutes with the song service brother says let me tell you something this is the message thirst when you're worshiping God in this spirit and in truth so we We Begin by worshiping God in spirit and Truth he says when it becomes a custom for you to do it because you think you ought to do it because you think if you don't shout or jump up and down or dance with the music your neighbor's going to think you're backslid you are drinking from a stagnated stream when we're at one time worshiping in spirit and truth but then we become more conscious about other people around us or it becomes accustomed to do it or you think you ought to do it or think if you don't worship a particular way you're going to think that your your neighbor's going to think you're back well why aren't they dancing why aren't they shouting why doesn't that sister ever speak with tongues I've never heard her scream before and then you get oh well if I don't they're going to think I'm backslid that's the wrong kind of atmosphere that's being created the worship actually creating pressure and performance anxiety where someone feels like they're on a stage and now I've got to worship like everybody else and then it's it's not genuine anymore from the heart you're afraid that your neighbor is going to think you're backslid he says you're drinking from a stagnated stream he said until it fills every fiber until the Holy Spirit itself is bubbling in you I don't care whether the music is playing whether they're playing near my God to thee or whatever it is the holy spirit still ringing the glory bells in your heart that might speak with he says that brings Glory Bells your hearts that's satisfied that's God's satisfying portion anything less than that you are done says you might speak with tongues like men and angels you might give all your good to feed the poor you might prophesy you might have knowledge understand all the Mysteries and all these things and you still become nothing First Corinthians 13 until that satisfying something that can only quench that thirst my soul thirst for the Living God like the heart panting for the water Brook unless I can find it I'll perish when you get to hungry for God like that something's going to take place the holy spirit is to lead you to those great Fountains of God I love how brother brandom identifies these different ways that we can be backslid all because we're worried about what other people think I'm going to go to church cuz if I don't they'll think I'm backslid I'm in to worship a particular way because if I don't they're going to think I'm backslid and this whole idea of trying to conform to other people's expectations their own experiences their own anecdotal experiences the the things that they've gone through we try to conform to that we try to meet that expectation we try to walk in the pattern of somebody else's story of how they did this and they did that we're falling short of the real privilege of being a son or daughter of God that's led by the spirit of God don't allow this to become a custom don't worship just because you're afraid of what the other person would think allow everyone else to have have a genuine expression of worship allow other people to express their love to God in their own personal way allow yourself to come to church with a hand ready to serve instead of a hand out don't be judgmental don't have dog dogmas come into our own hearts and our own lives we're being challenged with this parable are we the man going down from Jerusalem we could be if we're thinking more about what others think than what God thinks we could be if we're not going [Music] forward CU brother braham's pointing out what it means to be backslid you can just be stagnant going in circles could be because you're offering pretense everything's on the stage it's acting the Bible say there's a way which seeth right unto a man but the end thereof are the ways of death all the ways of man are clean in his own eyes and there's a way that seems right but that way is the ways of death we could be backslid in one of these definitions right not going forward allowing ourselves to engage in a thought process that indicates our our judgments aren't where they should be our value isn't where it should be but then also it could be in how we treat others it could be in how we play the part of the priest or the levite instead of the part of the Samaritan let's stand to our [Music] feet let's just bow our heads in a word of Prayer [Music] our gracious Heavenly Father Lord as we close this service tonight we've had a wonderful time together as family around your word we've been challenged we've laughed together we've thought of our own mistakes Lord we've thought of how we've been mistreated Lord how we've mistreated others and now Lord we ask that this holy spirit that you've given us this great gift that we've received could have more Liberty in our lives that it would heal us of hurts that cause us to judge others incorrectly Lord that it would take any Pride any false humility any hypocrisy and it would bring it low make it subject to the word of God we humble ourselves to you as on a Potter will tonight Lord asking that you break us down any bias any judgment any correct incorrect values Lord anything that's perverted our per ception of others father we lay them down and I ask Lord that you take us tonight and just Lift us up and our hearts cry tonight as a church and for the many that are unable to be here tonight for the many who are here tonight Lord our hearts cry is we want to climb higher we're reaching for something more Lord Beans and Cornbread are good and there's no uh no disagreement with what we fed on there's no disparagement of what we fed on Lord there's no uh uh casting down or crit ISM of what we fed on but Lord we want to reach higher we know there's more we want to climb higher we're instructed in the word that if we aren't climbing higher we're moving back so Lord we reach forth now we reach higher we want to go higher we want to feed on things higher we pray that you wouldd help us to do so Lord if there's been any mechanism in our minds or in our hearts Lord if we've created the kind of atmosphere in the way that we interact with other people to where they're being motivated to come to church merely because they're afraid of being called a hypocrite Lord may we change the atmosphere Lord may we change our attitude may we change the way that we approach Church Lord if we've actually created a an atmosphere in worship and a way that we approach a song service or the post service where we try to get people to worship a particular way because we're afraid we'll be considered a hypocrite or we're afraid the service will be too dry we're afraid people think the spirit of God didn't move oh Lord break down these biases Lord L break down these human mechanisms father that you might have Liberty that you can move in our hearts and move in our lives Lord we're learning from this Parable we're learning as your Holy Spirit leads us and we thank you Father for the lessons which are being taught may they be made applicable father may they be added to our faith Lord that we could use them and I pray father that they'll mean something tomorrow on a Thursday afternoon they'll mean something on a Friday evening they'll manifest themselves on a Saturday morning Lord not just in church but when it really counts commit the people to you tonight Lord bless them I pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen
