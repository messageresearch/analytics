[0:00] we're going to continue on the subject
[0:02] of the kingdom and Heaven's mystery
[0:05] Earth's Glory I feel that it's important
[0:07] to remind you each service that that's
[0:10] the subject we're on because I might be
[0:12] focusing on something that seems so far
[0:14] away from this but it's this that has
[0:16] inspired me and with every service for
[0:19] me personally there's just a greater
[0:21] highlight that's coming to me a greater
[0:23] understanding what heaven's mystery was
[0:25] and is and what Earth glory is so we're
[0:28] not wanting to move beyond that and kind
[0:30] of using the phrase the kingdom to
[0:31] express that and that's a large thought
[0:34] in itself so remember that because we're
[0:36] going to tie back to some of those
[0:37] things later on in this service but now
[0:40] this morning it's part three of the two
[0:42] Edens uh the two Edens we could just
[0:44] simply State as God's Eden which we see
[0:47] in the beginning that God created and uh
[0:49] was there dressed and arrayed and placed
[0:52] and manplaced in the Garden of Eden
[0:54] address it and to till it there in
[0:55] Genesis 1 and Genesis 2. that's God's
[0:58] Eden and then which was formed through
[1:00] six thousand years and then we're
[1:01] looking at also Satan's Eden and what
[1:05] Satan was Desiring to accomplish and
[1:06] what he has accomplished through uh six
[1:09] thousand years and brother Branham says
[1:11] that these two Edens are perfect types
[1:14] and he uses I think we're going to read
[1:16] a statement here in a moment he uses
[1:17] Matthew 24 24 that the spirit will be so
[1:21] close that deceiving Spirit these false
[1:23] Christ and these false anointed ones
[1:24] there'll be such a manifestation an
[1:27] expression of those who are falsely
[1:29] anointed that it could be so close that
[1:31] it would deceive the very elect if it
[1:33] were possible and brother Branham uses
[1:35] that uh to say that Satan's Eden is such
[1:39] a mimic and such a twin and is a raid in
[1:42] such a way that but for God's election
[1:44] we could be deceived as well uh and and
[1:47] it is a contrast between two Edens we
[1:51] know that that God hadn't eaten in the
[1:53] beginning and as we talk about the
[1:55] kingdom let me say this and remind you
[1:57] that God God's objective is to restore
[2:00] Eden and to bring it back to restore us
[2:02] back to Eden and Christ is the mystery
[2:04] of God revealed it emphasizes that over
[2:06] and over again he says to restore the
[2:08] kingdom to its right position
[2:09] and in that Kingdom it's a kingdom where
[2:11] God's Not only worshiped but he's
[2:13] manifested and there's many that worship
[2:16] God and they could even worship the one
[2:18] who created the heavens and the Earth
[2:19] because they maybe they don't know him
[2:21] by name and they don't know his will and
[2:22] they don't know his intention and maybe
[2:24] not being knowledgeable of Christianity
[2:27] or the Bible they just said there must
[2:28] be a being and whoever this being is
[2:30] will worship Him and God's just not
[2:33] desirous that someone would worship him
[2:35] or worship the deity that created the
[2:37] heavens and the Earth but he's a God
[2:39] that wants to be known by his
[2:40] manifestation worshiped in spirit and in
[2:43] truth and there's something that God is
[2:45] wanting to accomplish and that's what
[2:47] this Kingdom represents and as Eden was
[2:51] lost to humanity and even Humanity
[2:53] change Satan has been building his Eden
[2:56] ever since then found his way in the
[2:59] Garden of Eden slipped in found a way to
[3:01] inject himself into the human bloodline
[3:04] into the human stream and he's been
[3:06] building through that his kingdom ever
[3:08] since the fall
[3:10] and just to
[3:13] hopefully give some context to focusing
[3:17] on Satan's Eden and and the worldly
[3:19] kingdoms and because I gotta I could
[3:21] understand the objection with hearing
[3:23] enough about the world we're hearing
[3:24] enough about laodicea we've heard enough
[3:26] about the things going on in politics
[3:28] and and where the church is at I and I
[3:30] understand that but to the extent that
[3:32] we'll focus on Satan's Eden we're doing
[3:34] it so that we can contrast the kingdom
[3:37] and and even to help us to understand
[3:39] that there may be a lot of things that
[3:41] might look uh shiny and like we want to
[3:44] reach out and we just want to touch it
[3:45] and we want to play with it like isn't
[3:47] this neat and in this awesome and we
[3:49] should have an appropriate respect for
[3:51] the fact that Satan will appear as an
[3:53] angel of Light it could be a lot of
[3:54] enticing things that draw Us in and do
[3:57] that so that by the Holy Spirit In Our
[3:59] Lives we're exercising discernment to
[4:01] say no thank you I want Christ I want
[4:04] the word I want that that thing that
[4:06] really Thrills my soul and so we're
[4:09] looking at Satan's Eden to understand
[4:12] to understand the contrast to the
[4:15] kingdom because Satan's Eden is anti-god
[4:18] it is anti-eden if we could say that
[4:21] anti-to the actual Eden that God wants
[4:23] to restore and and Satan's Eden is the
[4:25] Antichrist it's anti-word
[4:28] and we think anti-word would be a
[4:30] rejection of the word but it's it's not
[4:32] quite the rejection of it in the blatant
[4:34] obvious sense but the opposition to it
[4:37] in a very subtle way
[4:39] and in the God's power to transform
[4:41] brother Brahm says here notice the type
[4:43] of the two Edens so closely typed
[4:45] together to almost deceive the very
[4:48] elected Matthew 24 24 said it would be
[4:50] that way so there's the prophet saying
[4:52] Matthew 24 24
[4:54] contains the comparison of two Edens
[4:58] but I want us to stop for a few moments
[5:00] and consider these two Edens
[5:02] and one thing especially how the Bible
[5:05] tells us that God's word did produce
[5:07] that Eden
[5:08] and how God's word warns us that the
[5:10] other Eden would come
[5:12] so that's very direct to Edens God's
[5:14] eating Satan's Eden God's word produced
[5:17] that Eden and God's word warns us that
[5:20] the other Eden would come and remember
[5:22] it's right there the title of the sermon
[5:24] God's power to transform and so that's
[5:27] he's not just historically looking back
[5:29] on God's power to transform a chaotic
[5:31] Earth in Genesis 1 2 into an earth of
[5:34] Nature and light and seasons and land
[5:36] and sea and animal life but it's God's
[5:39] power to transform now
[5:40] it's God's power to transform you God's
[5:43] power to transform the condition we're
[5:45] in God's power to transform what has
[5:48] been deformed into Satan's Eden God can
[5:50] transform it again into an Eden of
[5:53] Eternity and Glory
[5:55] now if Wednesday night we were looking
[5:57] at the two religions that came out of
[5:59] Eden we could summarize that very
[6:01] quickly as True Religion which would be
[6:03] the worship of God and spirit and Truth
[6:05] by Revelation and then also a false
[6:07] religion which even though it may seem
[6:10] to be projected to God it's actually a
[6:12] worship of Satan if God is not receiving
[6:15] it then it's it's almost by default this
[6:19] that glorifies Satan's objective that
[6:21] serves Satan's objective so two
[6:23] religions come out of Eden in the fall
[6:25] and the birth of Cain and Abel we come
[6:27] coming out of that there's two religions
[6:29] uh that are born and I think we're
[6:30] ending on that Wednesday night where
[6:32] program said there's only two religions
[6:34] and and that's remarkable because oh no
[6:36] no no there's over 45
[6:38] 000 different denominations but two
[6:39] religions that's it there there's uh
[6:42] denominations and then there's the truth
[6:44] and so there is uh that's just the
[6:47] reality that we should look at it so
[6:49] that we can understand just how precious
[6:51] it is to have true faith
[6:53] now in Genesis Chapter 4 verses three
[6:55] four and five I'm going to read this
[6:57] uh to kind of reset this point of
[6:59] diversion of these two religions and in
[7:01] the process of time it came to pass that
[7:04] Cain brought of the fruit of the ground
[7:06] and offering unto the Lord
[7:09] remember how in the garden that the use
[7:12] of symbolic language to say if you
[7:14] partake of the fruit of the tree of
[7:15] knowledge of Good and Evil that that
[7:17] would be a transgressions to God's word
[7:18] and the day that you eat thereof that
[7:20] day you die and that as soon as man had
[7:22] sinned he went and took the leaves from
[7:24] a fruit tree
[7:25] and and fashioned himself coverings once
[7:28] he knew that he was naked so when Cain
[7:30] offers this uh it's remarkable how that
[7:34] it might seem to line up with God's
[7:37] intent in the beginning that they offer
[7:39] fruit and and the the very thing that
[7:42] man was hid behind but yet Cain is
[7:45] bringing forth something that is not by
[7:47] Revelation it's not by faith and at the
[7:49] very time that Cain is bringing an
[7:51] offered it says in Abel he also brought
[7:53] of the first things of his flock and of
[7:56] the fat thereof and these are offerings
[7:58] unto the Lord this is worship of God
[8:01] this is intended to uh
[8:04] and I guess there's maybe a lot of ways
[8:06] that you can say it but a way to show
[8:08] honor or a veneration or to appease or
[8:10] to show respect to the one who spoke and
[8:13] the worlds which were created just even
[8:15] this Consciousness and awareness of why
[8:18] they were there and they're not
[8:19] wrestling with well how did we get here
[8:21] and why does this exist and that exists
[8:23] they just they knew that God God created
[8:25] the heavens and the Earth and here we
[8:27] are and there's only us and and in this
[8:29] tremendous Eden and there were some uh
[8:32] sense of the Divine in that they're told
[8:35] uh by even their parents and Cain brings
[8:38] this offering to the Lord which is the
[8:41] fruit of the ground Abel brings a
[8:43] sacrifice he slays the first thing of
[8:46] his flock and and he gives that this
[8:48] would have been a bloody stinking bloody
[8:50] sacrifice a mess that he is pouring out
[8:53] on this Altar and he offers it up to the
[8:54] Lord the Bible says in verse 5
[8:58] verse 4 and the Lord had respect unto
[9:01] Abel and to his offering God regarded it
[9:04] and how that we know that we could take
[9:06] it just simply from the fact that the
[9:08] Bible tells us that God regarded it God
[9:10] had respect to it but it says but unto
[9:12] Cain and to his offering he had not
[9:14] respect so what I I there's we could
[9:17] just take God in his word Moses writes
[9:19] and tells us that God regarded the one
[9:21] and respected one and didn't respect the
[9:22] other but yet the way in the manner in
[9:25] which he did it Cain recognizes that his
[9:28] offering has not been respected or
[9:30] re-honored or regarded so it says and
[9:32] Cain was very Roth and his countenance
[9:34] foul so God had some means of indication
[9:37] he had some means of declaring that I
[9:39] have accepted this sacrifice and and
[9:41] somehow had conveyed it to Able that I'm
[9:45] pleased with your Revelation I'm pleased
[9:47] with your faith in such a way to recain
[9:49] is looking at it and he is offended and
[9:52] it gets angry
[9:54] and and just notice kind of his Instinct
[9:56] instead of saying man Abel that that was
[9:59] amazing what just happened and I was
[10:02] sincere and I built a beautiful Altar
[10:03] and I took the things that I cultivated
[10:05] that I had access to of my own and yet
[10:07] yours just seemed messy and it seemed
[10:09] incongruent it seemed a little cruel and
[10:11] I mean a little insensitive there buddy
[10:13] but yet God respected yours and instead
[10:16] of humbling himself and saying maybe I
[10:18] can learn something from you uh maybe
[10:20] there's something I I want to worship
[10:21] God and spirit and truth I want my
[10:23] offering to be accepted instead of doing
[10:25] that he gets angry so there's that
[10:27] jealousy there's that Pride there's that
[10:29] all coming from that serpent that's
[10:31] bound up in him and he gets angry and we
[10:34] know that and this fit of anger at the
[10:36] time that he's angry God said why are
[10:37] you mad
[10:38] so then God is communicating with Cain
[10:40] and this is where Cain has this sense of
[10:43] something Beyond himself and he says why
[10:45] is it that you you are angry why are why
[10:48] are you mad if you'll just offer the
[10:50] sacrifice by Revelation I'll regard your
[10:53] offering as well and that's not enough
[10:55] for Cain in his anger and in his
[10:57] jealousy he slays his brother and that's
[10:59] I think that's important to remember is
[11:02] this murderous spirit in the beginning
[11:06] the birth of twins
[11:08] of Abel and Cain
[11:10] is what we recognize here in Genesis
[11:13] chapter 4 and the beginning of Satan's
[11:15] Eden this is the beginning of worldly
[11:16] kingdoms this is where we begin to
[11:19] recognize the tactics of Satan that Cain
[11:23] is worshiping and we give him a benefit
[11:25] of doubt he's sincere he means well he's
[11:27] worshiping he's given a sacrifice he's
[11:29] offering if that's all that God required
[11:31] certainly surely he would have accepted
[11:33] it but as soon as God corrects the basis
[11:35] or corrects the inspiration that's where
[11:38] he kind of shows his colors begins to
[11:40] resist the will of God begins to resist
[11:42] the presence of God so we see the
[11:43] tactics of Kate of Satan in Cain in this
[11:47] birth of twins and that that word
[11:49] they're twins is huge if we study the
[11:51] message of the hour how brother Branham
[11:52] uses that
[11:54] because Abel and Cain foreshadow Jesus
[11:57] and Judas
[11:58] and and we say well Jesus and Judas were
[12:01] types of uh Abel and Cain actually
[12:04] Abel and Cain Believe It or Not were
[12:07] foreshadows or types of what would
[12:09] culminate in Jesus and Judas because
[12:12] Judas is Judah from the tribe of Judah
[12:14] so here's one who's in the church he's
[12:16] an officer in the church he's one that
[12:18] nobody suppose that it was Judas when
[12:20] the question came up that one of you is
[12:21] going to betray you and everybody kind
[12:23] of looked around they probably said
[12:24] Judas you're the best tell us right
[12:27] you're from the tribe of Judah you dress
[12:28] the best you hold the bag everything
[12:30] you're you tell us what's going to
[12:31] happen here
[12:32] and nobody suppose themselves and so
[12:35] here's that twin that comes right up in
[12:37] the midst of the Revival comes right up
[12:38] next to Christ and that's what Cain and
[12:41] Abel were foreshadowing is that
[12:44] opposition and that contrast in uh Jesus
[12:48] and Judas and so what does Judas do he
[12:50] betrays Christ uh and essentially
[12:53] delivers him up to be murdered in the
[12:55] same manner in which Cain did his
[12:57] brother Abel and so in those twins
[12:59] represented in Abel and Cain Jesus and
[13:01] Judas you also have the True Vine in
[13:04] false Vine the true church the false
[13:05] Church in all those different ways that
[13:07] you could uh emphasize that same process
[13:10] of true life and false life being
[13:12] expressed
[13:13] in the sermon power of transformation
[13:16] and and so he preached God's power to
[13:18] transform in September then the the
[13:20] month later he preached the power of
[13:22] transformation
[13:23] and I'm reading from a few places here
[13:25] I've been kind of putting this off a
[13:27] little bit over the last few services
[13:29] and I know you're very familiar with
[13:31] this I I just want to emphasize this to
[13:34] see that brother banham put
[13:38] uh was was looking at something himself
[13:40] in tracking and seeing this Satan's Eden
[13:44] how it developed and where it's at now
[13:46] he says don't forget this little flock
[13:48] the church in the last days is going to
[13:51] be twins so close it'll deceive the
[13:54] elected remember his theme in both of
[13:56] these transformation sermons to Edens in
[13:58] that use of that scripture
[14:00] so close it'll deceive the elected
[14:02] Matthew 24 24. the church is going to
[14:05] it's a Pentecostal move
[14:08] and that's a remarkable statement
[14:11] it's so much like the real thing till it
[14:13] would deceive the very elected if it was
[14:15] possible
[14:17] now if I could say this just to caution
[14:19] us he says it's a Pentecostal move
[14:23] and in saying that the church is going
[14:25] to be a Pentecostal move and he's
[14:27] talking about the false because he says
[14:29] it'll be it's so much like the real
[14:31] thing to deceive the very elected if it
[14:33] was possible
[14:34] now what you don't want to make the
[14:36] mistake of is oh if it's a Pentecostal
[14:38] move
[14:39] I'm gonna I'm gonna shoot at it and
[14:41] attack it and tear it down because it's
[14:43] the false but remember
[14:45] it's so close like the real thing that
[14:48] it would deceive the very elective
[14:49] possible so don't make don't let Satan
[14:52] draw you offsides into the same kind of
[14:55] spirit that he's of by trying to oppose
[14:58] something that you think is anti wherein
[15:00] you ought to concern yourself with being
[15:02] what is truth in the truth and not
[15:05] somebody oh if it's a Pentecostal move I
[15:07] hate Pentecost well you've got to be
[15:08] careful there because Brethren even used
[15:10] that nomenclature to describe the very
[15:12] move of God in the last days and so to
[15:14] the extent that Pentecost is genuine and
[15:17] in the word of God and moving in the
[15:18] light of God's word that's what we want
[15:20] to be we want to be original Pentecost
[15:22] we need to be restored back to the
[15:24] original tenets and Faith of Our
[15:25] Pentecostal fathers I know there's a lot
[15:27] of depth and understanding to what that
[15:28] is and so just because Satan brings up
[15:31] the false we need to be careful that we
[15:34] don't hate The False Image at the
[15:36] expense of not embracing the truth
[15:39] or causing us to reject the true because
[15:42] we hate so much the false
[15:43] and I know there's a lot to that and I
[15:46] trust that you you have a little bit of
[15:47] Grace if I'm not articulating that just
[15:49] it with the perfect balance so it says
[15:51] and little later on if I get the chance
[15:53] I want to explain how that election
[15:55] comes it's going to deceive them because
[15:58] it's almost like the same thing just two
[16:01] fathers that's all same mother same
[16:03] church same movement same thing
[16:06] and that's where we come back to the
[16:08] beginning to see this pattern happen in
[16:10] the very very beginning with two
[16:12] different fathers but the same womb the
[16:14] betting ground is the same where the
[16:16] word Falls but one of them like care is
[16:19] perverted one of them is a perversion
[16:21] because it's the wrong father
[16:23] which I will prove someday if God will
[16:26] let me the denomination is the mark of
[16:28] the beast now that's a statement
[16:32] it's quite a statement that denomination
[16:34] is the mark of the beast and
[16:37] there are and even at the time in
[16:40] theologians and Scholars would probably
[16:42] argue that all the other denominations
[16:44] are mark of the beast but ours isn't and
[16:47] maybe a lot of Protestants could agree
[16:49] that the Catholic church is the mark of
[16:51] the beast but protestantism isn't and
[16:54] here brother Brown is saying sorry
[16:57] I'm gonna lump you all together
[16:59] I'm going to take all the tears and bind
[17:02] them up
[17:03] and I'm going to separate out the tears
[17:06] I'm gonna separate the world the
[17:07] kingdoms out I'm going to separate out
[17:09] Satan's and I'm going to separate out
[17:10] the mimics I'm going to separate all the
[17:11] false religions and I'm going to bind
[17:13] them up for their judgment and at this
[17:16] time of the Harvest because he's
[17:17] preaching Harvest Time right in this
[17:19] season I'm going to take out we're going
[17:21] to separate out the true the true wheat
[17:23] and the elect so that they're not judged
[17:26] with the tares
[17:28] so when he says denomination is the mark
[17:30] of the beast that's quite a statement
[17:33] and that is more
[17:35] I see that's more in where brother
[17:38] Brown's emphasizing this as we continue
[17:39] to read he says it's the wrong father
[17:41] he's stirring people to an organization
[17:44] instead of the word it's the wrong
[17:46] father it's a cane move
[17:50] and there is
[17:52] we have just in our nature and however
[17:55] you want to blame that does your finder
[17:58] go as far back to Cain if you want but
[18:00] we have in our nature a desire for order
[18:04] and for Symmetry and humans are wired to
[18:06] identify patterns even if there isn't
[18:08] one that's why we can look at a cloud
[18:09] and say do you see the dog in the sky
[18:11] right because we just kind of wired that
[18:13] way to see things and see patterns and
[18:16] see things kind of emerge I'm like I've
[18:18] noticed this like well that's not really
[18:19] an intentional pattern it's just
[18:21] something that we're kind of wired to
[18:22] recognize and to see so we we like
[18:25] organization
[18:27] uh we we like we like gnome things and
[18:30] and we like things to be a certain way
[18:31] and Satan having designed us if I could
[18:34] say that kind of knows what our bent is
[18:37] in our humanity and will provide us the
[18:39] necessary structure and the Optics so
[18:41] that we can kind of feel like okay yeah
[18:43] this is good I like this this will work
[18:46] this will work this is this will appease
[18:47] my desire to be message or this will
[18:49] appease my desire to be Christian or to
[18:51] worship but to go to church and so he
[18:52] says but he says it's a cane move
[18:55] and then it's this this statement that
[18:57] I'm that he's kind of building to when I
[19:00] go home this time I'm preaching on the
[19:01] subject the trail of the serpent
[19:05] and the phrase this it's the secondary
[19:08] phrase to me that's the most important
[19:09] the beast at the beginning and the Beast
[19:11] at the end now that's just it was just
[19:12] me I'm not going to try to
[19:14] cause you to highlight one over the
[19:16] other but the trail of the serpent the
[19:18] beast at the beginning the beast at the
[19:19] end entrail him right through the Bible
[19:22] and show how he heads up
[19:25] and you'll get that on the telephone you
[19:26] see and he says I'll do this if the Lord
[19:28] permits I don't think I have maybe have
[19:29] that one there he says I'll get this if
[19:31] the Lord permits me to so he had even
[19:33] this sense maybe I'm not going to get a
[19:34] chance to speak it he says he said I
[19:36] want you to watch how cunning this
[19:38] fellow is
[19:40] now
[19:41] he refers to this title the trail of the
[19:43] serpent five more times or at least five
[19:46] times in the last few months of his
[19:48] ministry
[19:49] The Trail Of The Serpent and and this
[19:51] this secondary phrase the beast at the
[19:53] beginning the beast at the end kind of
[19:54] amplify the troller serpent so when he
[19:56] mentions the trail of the serpent he's
[19:58] tracking
[19:59] the beast at the beginning which we
[20:01] could say the serpent was the most
[20:02] subtle beast of the field and this Beast
[20:05] that raises up in the Book of Revelation
[20:06] at the end he said this is the serpent
[20:10] we're going to Trail him through the
[20:12] Bible and it's not so much trailing
[20:15] Through the Bible That's not the big
[20:17] thing it's in the Bible anybody can do a
[20:19] word search Scholars for years could
[20:21] take the beast in the Genesis 3 because
[20:23] it's there Genesis 3 is most subtle
[20:25] beast and go to Revelation and just do a
[20:27] word search and you can find all the
[20:29] places where Satan was there whether you
[20:32] want to see the opposition between Jacob
[20:33] and Esau and see the opposition between
[20:35] Israel and Babylon and all these
[20:38] different kingdoms that raise up you
[20:40] could see Satan's agenda and you can see
[20:42] him there with Judas and you could see
[20:43] him opposing the church and they're in
[20:45] the Pharisees all the different places
[20:47] you can see the the trail of the serpent
[20:50] Through the Bible but that's not real
[20:53] the real mystery is
[20:54] it's where he heads up there's a lot of
[20:57] scholarship on the serpent from the
[20:59] beginning there's even that phrase the
[21:01] trail of the serpent wasn't original to
[21:02] brother Branham but that wasn't the
[21:04] inspiration the mystery isn't just to
[21:06] Trail them in the Bible from Genesis to
[21:08] Revelation but it's where he ends up now
[21:09] it's the beast at the end not even in
[21:12] symbolic form in Revelation but what
[21:14] he's come to in the very end time so he
[21:17] says in the sermon trying to do God a
[21:19] service without it being his will
[21:21] very very very near is the last sermon
[21:23] this is a Brother's breakfast a
[21:25] Minister's breakfast in Shreveport I'm
[21:28] preaching because I wouldn't preach it
[21:29] in brother Jack's Church he'd tell me go
[21:30] ahead and do it but I'm going to the
[21:32] Tabernacle it'll be about four hours
[21:34] long and my subject is the beast at the
[21:38] beginning and the Beast at the end
[21:39] through the trail of a serpent
[21:41] again I say his emphasis is the beast at
[21:44] the beginning of the beast at the end
[21:46] through the trail of The Serpent and
[21:48] again even that phrase you could see the
[21:50] beast at the beginning in Genesis in the
[21:51] beast in Revelation and that could be
[21:53] something oh look there may there may be
[21:55] there's something there do we connect
[21:57] these together and there's a lot there
[21:59] that could begin to fill in to the uh
[22:02] the picture to recognize this Trail he
[22:05] says take about four hours so I'm not
[22:07] quite gonna be four but we don't have an
[22:10] evening service so you just relax I
[22:12] think we got the air conditioner fixed
[22:13] and everything so we're good right
[22:16] all right
[22:17] he says I got my scriptures all laying
[22:19] out the from the beginning
[22:23] he's the beast at the end
[22:26] now notice the punch and show that he's
[22:29] a religious person and a denomination
[22:31] that made the denomination
[22:33] I mean that's a punch isn't it goes and
[22:36] come right through the trail of it and
[22:37] prove it to you by the scriptures that
[22:39] it is he goes I didn't know that to the
[22:41] Holy Spirit give it to me the other day
[22:43] up there now that that should be the
[22:46] clue that brother branham's not just
[22:48] running a concordance search brother
[22:50] Madam's not just drawing uh from history
[22:53] uh he there's something that God has
[22:56] inspired to him and quickened to him
[22:58] you'll find this very often in his
[22:59] ministry that if he reads something or
[23:01] something's inspired to him he would run
[23:03] and he would study it out and he'd
[23:04] research it
[23:05] and he would try to find places that
[23:08] would that he could say oh that that
[23:10] agrees with my heart that resonates
[23:12] there that's a good scripture there
[23:14] that's a good thing there and so God had
[23:16] quickened something to him and instead
[23:18] of just running out there and finding
[23:20] out what brother Jack said about it and
[23:21] what this brother had to say about it
[23:23] what leeville has to say about it he he
[23:25] goes to the word of God and he begins to
[23:27] see this thing develop and if it's
[23:29] corroborated with other other things
[23:31] there's something that has struck him
[23:33] and I want to say this in this very very
[23:36] forcefully when brother Branham says the
[23:38] trail of the serpent the beast at the
[23:40] beginning the beast at the end and then
[23:41] he comes back to it again and this other
[23:43] service that he's connecting it to
[23:45] something Beyond history
[23:48] uh this is going to be a mouthful but
[23:51] it's connecting it to something Beyond
[23:53] Church ages
[23:55] because it's not just a matter of exp
[23:57] it's not just the ahav exposing the
[23:59] devil but there's one thing that exposes
[24:02] the serpent there's one thing that
[24:04] exposes the Antichrist and that's the
[24:07] brightness of Christ that's the light of
[24:10] God's word so you cannot have an
[24:13] exposure and you can't have the cover
[24:15] being pulled off of something to say
[24:17] look it's the mark of the beast unless
[24:20] you have light that is shining
[24:22] to expose the air
[24:25] what good would it be if the lights are
[24:27] off and we're all blind and we're all
[24:28] groping around and and I'm just over
[24:30] there and I got really good feelers and
[24:31] I'm like oh guess what
[24:34] what there's a beast in here
[24:36] right and I'm just going to try to
[24:37] describe to you what the Beast is
[24:40] okay
[24:42] what if you're really bad at describing
[24:44] something
[24:45] hey that wouldn't be good but there's
[24:48] something about the light is shining and
[24:50] if I could say this the beautiful fact
[24:52] about the light shining is that the
[24:54] light is shining to give you an
[24:56] understanding so it's not just trying to
[24:58] be a parent of what brother Branham said
[25:00] but Christ you light up my heart and my
[25:04] mind let me to know him to know him and
[25:07] the reality know him in relationship and
[25:09] that's what pulls the cover off the anti
[25:13] so he's he's really
[25:16] the real heart of this is beyond the
[25:19] historical perspective
[25:20] he's not just repeating historians he's
[25:23] not just reciting church history the
[25:25] history of Israel and the history of the
[25:26] New Testament Church and its opposition
[25:28] and then the history of the church to
[25:30] the church ages that's not what he's
[25:32] that's not what he's referring back to
[25:34] when he talks about the trail of The
[25:35] Serpent and the Beast at the end
[25:37] this isn't another time in leadership
[25:40] and here we are right down to the very
[25:42] end if you ever bought one of my tapes
[25:44] get this when I get it when I get home
[25:46] the trail of the serpent
[25:49] and you'll see where it's at see where
[25:51] this ends up at
[25:53] see what God had showed him the other
[25:55] day and I've been going back through
[25:56] some of those sermons that he preached
[25:57] within that time period trying to find
[25:59] if there was any particular moment or
[26:01] instance uh that is kind of in harmony
[26:04] with what the point he's trying to make
[26:05] there about what he calls him back to
[26:06] and I found a couple places I may be
[26:08] just a little bit reluctant even if it's
[26:10] just for time's sake not to go into it
[26:12] but there's definitely something that
[26:14] was being impressed upon him that he is
[26:17] seen now in a more Stark way than he's
[26:19] ever seen before maybe it's just getting
[26:20] brighter brighter it's coming louder and
[26:22] louder clearer and clearer and so now
[26:24] you're saying you'll see where it ends
[26:25] up at so what the Lord showed him the
[26:28] other day isn't necessarily looking back
[26:31] but it's seen where things were now and
[26:33] that's what a prophet can do that's
[26:35] where a prophet can bring you is to
[26:37] where God where things are right now
[26:41] and so if I can put it this way
[26:43] he is seen and and I know that if I'm
[26:46] taking some Liberty here forgive me he's
[26:49] seeing the climax of two agendas
[26:52] I I'm not wanting to glorify just
[26:54] Satan's Eden but I wanted you to see
[26:57] that he's seen the climax of two agendas
[26:59] Satan's ambition but also God's
[27:01] achievement because God had a purpose
[27:03] God had somebody's trying to achieve God
[27:04] had a reason for doing this and he had a
[27:06] purpose in the beginning that was
[27:07] thwarted and it was that purpose that
[27:09] was seemingly interrupted by Satan to
[27:11] bring forth his agenda and his kingdom
[27:14] according to his ambition and so now you
[27:16] have a
[27:18] God's ambition at the end coming to IX
[27:21] climax so what brother branham's
[27:24] identifying is not just Satan's ambition
[27:26] but it's God's achievement
[27:28] and he's gonna he's gonna talk about the
[27:30] truth of the Beast because remember if I
[27:32] could put it in these terms the Beast
[27:35] system all along
[27:36] is fighting against the potential
[27:38] Genesis 3 15.
[27:40] why did Cain kill Abel let's see to the
[27:42] woman
[27:43] why was there at Judas at the time of
[27:44] Jesus Jesus the seat of the woman this
[27:47] is what he's got to he has got to thwart
[27:51] the the kingdom interruptor he's got to
[27:53] take the one that stands to bridge the
[27:55] gap of Fallen Humanity back to the
[27:57] original Eden and so his kingdom is
[27:59] going to be the Beast system and his
[28:01] beast power is wanting to raise
[28:04] something up but it's got this murderous
[28:06] Spirit behind it you've got to kill
[28:07] anything else that's genuine you got to
[28:09] tear anything else down that opposes uh
[28:12] gives the potential of weakening and
[28:14] destroying my reign
[28:16] when he's talking about the trail of the
[28:18] serpent the beast at the beginning the
[28:19] beast at the end that's a language that
[28:20] kind of puts The Serpent and the Beast
[28:22] in the headlights but that's not what
[28:24] the headlight is shining it's about the
[28:26] mystery of God
[28:28] he is he is looking at the mystery of
[28:30] godliness The Mystery of the church and
[28:32] Satan's attempt to pervert it
[28:34] when you when you Trail the serpent in
[28:37] the beginning the beast at the beginning
[28:37] beginning to the end there's a certain
[28:40] theme that emerges when you come to the
[28:42] end to realize oh you can't talk about
[28:44] the serpent without talking about God's
[28:46] purpose you can't talk about the beast
[28:49] at the beginning the beast at the end
[28:50] without looking at God's achievement and
[28:52] what he's wanting to do
[28:55] when he uses the term Trail it means to
[28:57] track
[28:58] or smell the track or smell left by a
[29:01] person or animal
[29:02] so the trail of the serpent is his track
[29:04] or the smell that has been left the
[29:07] trail of the serpent it's the track or
[29:10] the scent of Satan
[29:13] and there is a pull to that
[29:15] if there's a trail something has been
[29:17] left to to catch the scent of it and if
[29:20] you follow the scent and you know how to
[29:22] follow it it's going to lead you to
[29:24] where it is
[29:30] in this hour that we're living in
[29:34] Satan is capitalizing on just the
[29:37] abundance of information that we have
[29:39] access to
[29:40] and there is even I would say
[29:44] for some this instinct
[29:47] to want to just pour ourselves into a
[29:49] particular subject
[29:51] and just root out of out of it
[29:53] everything
[29:54] you know every every type every shadow
[29:56] every emblem every everything just get
[29:58] all the full history
[30:00] and I thank God that he took the
[30:03] messenger of the hour
[30:05] and wired him in a particular way to
[30:08] where as a and we believed this that he
[30:10] was a messenger to the church that he is
[30:12] he has a uh is sent to us he's a
[30:15] messenger that we've received and we
[30:17] give him that respect and and we have
[30:19] that confidence in him and that that's
[30:21] one of the things that's carving us or
[30:23] that's without that where would we be
[30:25] so we have this confidence that God
[30:28] gifted him equipped him and inspired him
[30:31] and even preserved all the you know 1200
[30:34] sermons that we could go back and listen
[30:37] to
[30:38] and that then and then in turn we need
[30:40] the Holy Spirit to Quicken these things
[30:42] to give us the truth of what's in there
[30:44] and the reality that's laying in that
[30:47] but I appreciate how he had an appetite
[30:50] to research and to study uh and through
[30:53] his effort presented to us kind of these
[30:56] highlights and these bits and pieces
[30:58] like God felt were relevant to us to be
[31:01] able to digest so that we don't have to
[31:04] try to go in and figure it all out
[31:07] because if you want to open up that door
[31:09] and get into that all right fine we'll
[31:11] start a Bible study and we'll do his
[31:12] lips to Babylons okay
[31:14] right
[31:16] and and and and we'll just fill our
[31:19] heads up
[31:20] with all the imagery that he's
[31:22] projecting and everything he's trying to
[31:24] set forth and we'll go ahead and go back
[31:26] to the histories that he quoted and go
[31:28] back to all the in the the try to
[31:30] compile all the resources together and
[31:33] you'd find if you did that it wouldn't
[31:35] satisfy in the end
[31:37] but brother Branham is taking something
[31:39] and he's saying oh let's pull this piece
[31:41] here let's pull that that piece here and
[31:45] it doesn't have to be drilled down
[31:46] perfectly to the letter it doesn't have
[31:48] to have all these things that are trying
[31:50] to perfectly line up because that wasn't
[31:52] his uh that wasn't his agenda his agenda
[31:56] was just to kind of take it back to the
[31:58] scripture and then see these things
[32:00] being highlighted in other places and
[32:02] not just allow us to open ourselves up
[32:04] to other things just to wholesale digest
[32:06] it and make it part of our appetite
[32:09] and Satan has taken advantage of the
[32:12] Loose Ends that exist for some and that
[32:14] seem to be laying out there but I
[32:16] believe that's what the message was
[32:17] doing was tying these things together
[32:21] I want to read from the sermon Israel
[32:23] and the church this was used a few weeks
[32:25] ago at least
[32:26] and it's kind of just this fulcrum that
[32:28] I can move use to go Advance further and
[32:31] today is still kind of reviewing from a
[32:33] lot of things we've already said I'm
[32:34] just trying to add add more depth to it
[32:36] but I'll say this as we enter this maybe
[32:38] the second part of the sermon be very
[32:41] sincere as we approach this
[32:43] and because all hell is against the word
[32:48] and Satan has been work
[32:49] Ed to cause confusion
[32:53] says that Satan knew God's will
[32:56] and with some foresight and even limited
[32:58] understanding of what God's wanting to
[33:00] do Satan has been trying to confuse the
[33:03] record but trying to sow a discrepancy
[33:06] and cause things to happen in such a way
[33:08] towards like oh well what about this and
[33:10] what about that so you've got to be very
[33:11] sincere
[33:12] so in this sermon Israel in the church
[33:14] he says you notice that all those Cults
[33:16] of this day are beginning in Genesis
[33:18] they have their start back in Genesis
[33:20] winding up out here in the last day for
[33:22] instance many of them like how that
[33:24] formal religion begin in Cain
[33:27] that's where he starts it and then he's
[33:29] going to track it for us how come out
[33:30] and come down to the sons of Noah ham
[33:32] out of a ham he had Nimrod Nimrod built
[33:35] the Tower of Babel Babel comes on down
[33:37] through King Nebuchadnezzar's time and
[33:39] out into Revelations Babylon so though
[33:42] the kingdom changed from Assyria uh to
[33:45] uh to these different regions in these
[33:48] different areas in Egypt and Greece and
[33:50] Rome though you could see the different
[33:52] natural kingdoms that existed it's the
[33:54] same spirit
[33:55] Same Spirit animating Kingdom Same
[33:58] Spirit behind the politics it's always
[34:00] been this Same Spirit from the beginning
[34:03] it says it's so there's brother Brown
[34:05] kind of trailing it then how that little
[34:07] seed started way back there at the East
[34:09] side of the gates of Eden coming on down
[34:11] winding out all kinds of Cults and
[34:13] everything started back there lining
[34:16] themselves out to the end now he
[34:17] behooves us to watch be careful and be
[34:20] said in the word many things are taking
[34:22] place today
[34:24] which are unscriptural let's watch the
[34:26] scripture be sure that we are right
[34:29] there's the warning many things are
[34:30] happening today that are unscriptural
[34:32] and he's given us this picture of a seed
[34:34] sown in the beginning and it coming to
[34:36] at the very end in a Babylon in the Book
[34:38] of Revelation he says and that's kind of
[34:40] that's where we've been wanting to get
[34:41] for the last few services in the Book of
[34:43] Revelation there's going to be a Babylon
[34:45] that raises let me says the same seed
[34:47] that was in Cain
[34:48] and formal religion
[34:50] and as it advances even in Nimrod when
[34:53] it comes to Nimrod we're going to see if
[34:55] you'll turn to Genesis 10
[34:57] . it's formal religion but not in the
[34:59] sense of worshiping the true creator
[35:01] Genesis chapter 10 verses 8 to 10 and
[35:03] Kush beget Nimrod he began to be a
[35:07] mighty one in the Earth
[35:09] it's referenced again in the book of
[35:11] Chronicles how he was a mighty one a
[35:13] mighty he begin to be Mighty in the
[35:15] earth he was a mighty Hunter before the
[35:18] Lord wherefore it is said even as Nimrod
[35:20] the mighty Hunter before the Lord so
[35:22] there's some recording a record it is
[35:24] said Nimrod the mighty Hunter before the
[35:27] Lord
[35:28] and the beginning of his kingdom first
[35:30] mention of kingdom in the Bible was
[35:32] Babel and Eric and akkad and kauna in
[35:35] the land of shinard
[35:37] when it says that the beginning of his
[35:39] kingdom was Babel there's the seeds of
[35:41] Babylon that word Babble there is
[35:42] Babylon
[35:43] and it's the Kingdom built by nimrod
[35:48] who is a mighty Hunter before the Lord
[35:51] which isn't
[35:53] like walk before me and be thou perfect
[35:55] as God said to Abraham it's not before
[35:58] the Lord in the way that we might think
[36:01] it but it actually means in the face of
[36:03] God
[36:04] remember in your face that's what he's
[36:06] doing he is a mighty hunter in the face
[36:09] of God in opposition to God so in the
[36:12] beginning of this Kingdom his King a
[36:15] kingdom whose beginning is against the
[36:17] Lord and this is Babylon it's against
[36:19] God
[36:20] Babel and the word Babylon the word
[36:22] Babel there specifically means to mingle
[36:24] oneself or to mix oneself it means a mix
[36:28] so here right at the start in Genesis 10
[36:31] as we get After the flood and we're
[36:33] seeing the generations of the sons of
[36:35] Noah it's not this is nimroduce Noah's
[36:37] great grandson
[36:39] so anybody here have living great
[36:41] grandparents
[36:42] I'll look at somebody that I know has
[36:44] what well that's a small okay good
[36:46] there's a few here we should do great
[36:48] grandparents day or something
[36:49] uh just it'd be a small gathering
[36:51] apparently but if that with the just
[36:54] think of how that is I mean this is just
[36:55] somebody it's not that far removed from
[36:58] Noah
[36:59] yet he is now building a kingdom and the
[37:02] scripture goes on to tell us in verses
[37:04] 11 and 12. he describes all the kingdoms
[37:06] that were built by him so much uh
[37:09] associated with him in that region where
[37:11] in Micah chapter five it refers to
[37:13] Assyria as the land of nimrod
[37:16] this this is just how remarkable his
[37:19] influence was and his this one who
[37:23] builds a kingdom called Babel it's a
[37:24] mixed uh Society or it's it's the word
[37:28] means mixed Babel so Satan has achieved
[37:31] his kingdom very quickly
[37:33] he's got a mighty Hunter against God who
[37:36] opposes God who's who is even the very
[37:39] words Nimrod the word means Rebellion
[37:44] this is this is the son of Cain
[37:46] this is in the spirit of the seed that
[37:49] was sown in the beginning because
[37:50] Babylon in Babylon is a pagan Kingdom
[37:54] they weren't building a tower that would
[37:56] reach to Heaven because they wanted to
[37:57] get a peak of God
[37:59] they weren't building a tower that could
[38:00] reach heaven so that they could be
[38:02] closer to God but this was something
[38:04] that was anti-god Nimrod meaning
[38:06] Rebellion this was rebellious against
[38:08] the word of God it was God's purpose in
[38:11] the beginning because God had set the
[38:13] bounds of man and how that he was to
[38:15] fill up the Earth and God had a vision
[38:17] of how that they would be scattered in
[38:19] the very vision of them in the beginning
[38:20] was that they would not be scattered
[38:25] a mighty one in the earth that means a
[38:27] tyrant
[38:28] Nimrod was a tyrant and he had such an
[38:31] effect upon the people that he had
[38:32] caused them to rely solely on his power
[38:34] his kingdom it's that Beast Force
[38:38] working upon the people with this forced
[38:41] unity in this Conformity and we're going
[38:43] to work together and we're going to do
[38:45] the same thing and we're going to model
[38:46] ourselves in a certain way and lest we
[38:49] be scattered over the face of the Earth
[38:50] as it says in Genesis 11 1 and the whole
[38:53] earth was of one language and one speech
[38:54] and it came to pass as they journeyed
[38:56] from the East that they found a plane in
[38:57] the land of shinar and they dwelt there
[39:00] this is
[39:01] this is nimrod's Kingdom this is his
[39:04] influence his ambition they said one to
[39:07] another go to let us make brick and burn
[39:11] them throughly
[39:12] and they had brick for stone and slime
[39:14] had they from order and they said go to
[39:16] let us build us a city and a tower that
[39:21] City in a tower called Babel this is the
[39:23] same word for Babylon it's in the plane
[39:25] of Shiner this is chaldea this is that
[39:27] region this is the location let us build
[39:29] us a city notice the referring back to
[39:32] let us make let us build whose top May
[39:34] reach unto heaven let us make us a name
[39:37] what a phrase let us make us a name lest
[39:40] we be scattered abroad upon the face of
[39:42] the whole earth that's that opposition
[39:44] to God's will
[39:45] and in these very words here God who
[39:48] wants these to be recorded it gives us
[39:49] insight into their what was in their
[39:51] minds and in their hearts and if the
[39:53] imagination of man was only constantly
[39:54] evil in Genesis 6 look at how quickly
[39:57] now man is united with one language and
[39:59] one speech even to the point where God
[40:01] says nothing will be restrained from
[40:02] them what they want to do and they're
[40:05] recognize the self-reliance the
[40:07] self-ambition the self-preservation it's
[40:10] me it's I I will let us let's preserve
[40:14] let's uh let this is our ambition this
[40:16] is our alliance and in Pride they're
[40:18] going to erect a monument
[40:21] to themselves
[40:23] there's no
[40:25] they're not hiding it it's not there's
[40:27] no pretense that they're worshiping God
[40:30] when you recognize that at this very
[40:32] moment there's no pretense that they're
[40:34] worshiping God Nimrod is against God
[40:36] Nimrod is in opposition to God some
[40:39] Scholars uh suppose that it's possible
[40:41] that Nimrod may have even met Abraham
[40:43] and that this is Nimrod who's there
[40:46] between Noah and between Abraham and his
[40:48] ideas who needs God
[40:51] we are against God and surely the
[40:54] philosophical arguments were pretty good
[40:55] do you know that this God who created
[40:58] the heavens and the Earth and maybe they
[40:59] even acknowledged them but you recognize
[41:01] what a narcissist is right
[41:03] didn't like what everybody was doing
[41:05] didn't like what they were doing with
[41:06] this canvas so he just says hey Noah get
[41:08] an ark build it I'm gonna allow you to
[41:11] survive we're going to kill the rest of
[41:12] the people in the face of the Earth and
[41:14] I'm sure there were some people sitting
[41:15] there going
[41:16] I don't
[41:18] I mean yeah he may be God but I don't
[41:19] want to serve God like that
[41:21] hey this is these are the seeds from
[41:25] Cain this is formal religion
[41:29] that is blatantly and obviously anti-god
[41:34] Josephus even comments that was that
[41:37] their building of this Tower was done in
[41:39] Disobedience to God's command to
[41:40] multiply and replenish the Earth it was
[41:42] done to defeat his will so this is
[41:44] against God
[41:46] and it's the city of Babylon that
[41:47] brother bear said the devil's lie in the
[41:49] devil's mystery rose up against the
[41:51] truth of God and the mysteries of God
[41:53] in this city
[41:55] this is where the devil's lies raise up
[41:58] in the devil's Mysteries raise up
[42:00] against the truth of God and the
[42:03] mysteries of God in that City
[42:05] this is why I would posit that just
[42:07] studying that alone will never let allow
[42:09] you to rise up identify truth
[42:12] and did you know the more often a lie is
[42:14] repeated the more likely you are to
[42:16] believe it to be true
[42:17] so there's a real danger in just
[42:19] researching the LIE
[42:20] real danger and just tracking down the
[42:22] false and trying to identify the Falls
[42:24] if it's not by the light that the
[42:26] light's not shining there's a real
[42:28] danger in picking around and things that
[42:30] are false
[42:33] so Babylon represents Satan's throne
[42:37] it's and if I I want to use that phrase
[42:40] it represents Satan's kingdom and his
[42:42] throne and in it hidden within it is his
[42:44] ambition to have a kingdom
[42:48] brother Brandon says in the pergament
[42:49] church age thus the mysteries of Babylon
[42:51] spread from Nation to Nation
[42:53] until it appeared in Rome in China India
[42:57] and even in North and South America we
[42:59] find the very same basic worship
[43:02] he's brother Branham didn't conduct time
[43:05] travel
[43:07] to to determine that
[43:09] and nor was he a historian with decades
[43:11] and Decades of research skills on his
[43:14] disposal to dig into the original record
[43:16] and read the foreign language and come
[43:18] up with this but he's looking at the
[43:20] historical record as research by
[43:22] historians and theologians and they're
[43:24] all agreeing and they're all pulling
[43:26] these things together saying look you
[43:28] have this model
[43:30] that exists even in Nations and and
[43:33] societies that were cut off from Europe
[43:37] that were not connected to the east the
[43:39] trading routes of the East that they
[43:41] were not they were uninfluenced
[43:43] seemingly by some of these other places
[43:45] by Connection by geography and some sort
[43:47] of uh Commerce but yet they have the
[43:50] same means and Method Of Worship it went
[43:53] with them as they were dispersed
[43:55] though their language changed they
[43:57] didn't mean their hearts were changed so
[44:00] now the imprint that's left in them is
[44:02] this means of formal religion and
[44:06] however that game of telephone worked
[44:08] and those successive Generations from
[44:10] one to the next as it got passed on it
[44:12] evolves to where they have their form of
[44:14] religion their form of worship and what
[44:16] a remarkable observation that the
[44:18] mysteries of Babylon that began in
[44:20] Genesis 10 that's what spread out over
[44:23] the whole earth so that if you're
[44:24] reading this story you're reading this
[44:27] tradition you're reading this allegory
[44:29] you're reading about this record it's
[44:32] all got Satan's fingerprints on it
[44:34] somehow
[44:35] presenting the same narratives why do
[44:37] they all have a flood narrative
[44:40] why do they all have this uh this
[44:43] archetype of this of the hero
[44:46] why is there a messiah figure in a lot
[44:48] of them
[44:49] you want to know why a lot of these
[44:50] things that exist in anthropology and
[44:52] exist in geography and history and all
[44:54] these other ways that we could collect
[44:56] these things is because Satan was the
[44:57] designer
[44:59] it was in them as they spread out over
[45:01] the Earth
[45:05] yeah rely on History alone
[45:08] rely on science alone and there's your
[45:11] faith
[45:13] because that's the that's the worst is a
[45:15] science that masquerades as faith
[45:18] in Revelations chapter 2 verses 12 and
[45:20] 13 I would like to go a lot faster right
[45:23] now so that we could end
[45:26] we could end quickly I would desire that
[45:29] you don't always get what you want
[45:33] but I do desire to to go rather quickly
[45:36] here in Revelations chapter 2 verses 12
[45:38] and 13. I hope I can just hit the
[45:40] highlights on this
[45:42] Satan's
[45:44] the Satan's seat is capital city of
[45:47] Babel the tower that would reach to this
[45:49] guy now we're fast forwarding to
[45:52] Revelations 2. brother Bram did a good
[45:54] job of ninrod Nebuchadnezzar you know he
[45:57] we could track it through that way he
[45:58] says in the angel and to the angel of
[46:00] the church in pergamus right there's a
[46:02] lot of Scholars who recognize how
[46:04] pergamus is a word that's distinct and
[46:06] its Origins they're distinctly different
[46:08] than the other Church ages it says these
[46:10] things saith he which hath the sharp
[46:12] sword with two edges
[46:13] I Know Thy works and where thou dwellest
[46:16] even where Satan's seat is
[46:19] now hold this fast my name and has not
[46:22] denied my faith even those days where an
[46:23] Antipas was my faithful martyr so there
[46:25] was opposition there was a murder Spirit
[46:28] there was a good reason to say
[46:30] uh maybe not politically correct right
[46:32] now for me to believe this maybe not
[46:34] good for my life for my next sake to
[46:36] continue to believe this but he says
[46:37] you've withstood even the face of
[46:39] intimidation he says who was slain among
[46:41] you and he says where Satan dwelleth
[46:45] by giving us this image of this martyr
[46:48] the slain martyr brings back to our
[46:51] minds how Satan is a murderer
[46:53] the father of lies and a murder in the
[46:55] beginning and it is his objective from
[46:57] the beginning to slay the seed of the
[46:59] woman so it's part of his agenda it's
[47:02] part of his nature it's part of the way
[47:03] that he reacts that if he can't do it by
[47:06] the sword he'll do it by word his own
[47:08] word his own lies because it's his
[47:10] desire to assassinate the truth it's his
[47:13] desire to assassinate the believer it's
[47:15] his desire to steal the word from the
[47:17] believer to steal the word out of your
[47:19] mouth to steal away the the the the
[47:21] words of God to cause you to devalue
[47:23] them and not believe them this is this
[47:25] is his desire through threat
[47:26] intimidation or whatever it might be to
[47:29] devalue the word of God
[47:31] and the scripture identifies Satan's
[47:33] seat
[47:34] that might just seem innocuous like oh
[47:36] no no don't sit there that Satan seat
[47:37] but it actually means throne throne us
[47:40] that's exactly what the word is if you
[47:41] looked it up in a Greek Lexicon it's the
[47:44] the elevated chair it's used of God and
[47:46] the Throne of God this is Satan's Throne
[47:49] seat
[47:51] that that helps us to see that Satan had
[47:54] a place of power Ephesians 2 2 calls him
[47:57] the prince of the power of the air
[48:00] here you have the uh the Messiah the
[48:03] prince Messiah that comes and you have
[48:05] the prince of the power of the air the
[48:06] reason he's got this Prince of the power
[48:08] there it says it's this anti-to-it
[48:10] crisis to be
[48:12] in John 14 30 Jesus says Hereafter I
[48:15] will not talk much with you I'm not
[48:17] getting into what he's saying here but
[48:19] just this phrase for the prince of this
[48:20] world cometh
[48:22] and hath nothing in me
[48:25] Satan is the prince of this world
[48:28] this is how the Bible characterizes him
[48:32] now let's just take that phrase the
[48:35] prince of this world
[48:36] the prince of the power of the air and
[48:39] however you'd want to describe that we
[48:41] must recognize that the air then is some
[48:43] Dominion that he's Prince
[48:45] that there's a world that somehow he is
[48:48] the prince of
[48:49] that this is identified with Satan this
[48:52] is what exists this is really maybe
[48:54] relying a lot on our services on for God
[48:56] so loved the world as controversial as
[48:58] they were we're still relying on that
[49:00] concept that there's a world that God
[49:02] loves and this world that God doesn't
[49:03] love and here's the prince of the power
[49:06] of the world this is the prince of the
[49:07] power of the other there's something
[49:08] represented that that Satan has deformed
[49:10] that God doesn't appreciate the
[49:12] deformity if I could put it that way
[49:14] and Satan has in this scripture very in
[49:19] particular
[49:20] he's moved his seat
[49:23] from Babylon of the Old Testament into
[49:27] the church
[49:29] and we have a marriage and a union now
[49:32] of what at one time would have been
[49:33] nimrod's religion formal religion of
[49:36] Cain evolved into the religion of nimrod
[49:38] and this is a religion that is
[49:40] Babylonian is is polytheism and it is it
[49:44] is the worship of the sun and the moon
[49:45] and the stars and we don't like that one
[49:48] true God and the one that spoke and
[49:49] created the worlds well whatever he is
[49:51] we don't want to serve them and they
[49:53] begin to identify other deities and
[49:54] other religions and they spread out over
[49:56] the Earth this false Pagan religion that
[49:59] existed among the Heathen or the
[50:01] reprobate as identified between
[50:02] Abraham's seed and the rest of the world
[50:04] that served not the true God he has now
[50:06] moved his seat and there's now a union
[50:09] in a marriage of all these worldly
[50:11] kingdoms and the power of the natural
[50:13] kingdoms if we could say government or
[50:15] politics with religion
[50:19] and not just religion but Christianity
[50:22] pergamus is therefore set forth as
[50:25] symbolically at this time in the church
[50:27] ages as the present capital of Satan's
[50:30] kingdom
[50:32] in
[50:34] pergamus they worship the god of healing
[50:36] which was
[50:37] the emblem of was a serpent
[50:41] there was there's a lot of things about
[50:43] their music and their science and their
[50:45] medicine and their way of worship and
[50:47] their temples that made this a place a
[50:50] logical place to be the seed of Satan
[50:53] but now it's it's not just the worship
[50:57] of a serpent
[50:59] that's clippios or these other deities
[51:01] that would have existed but it's it's
[51:04] being married
[51:06] with the very word pergamus
[51:09] some take it from pergos which is a
[51:12] mountain or a high tower and it's one
[51:14] definition that's often repeated that
[51:15] pergamus is from the word pergos which
[51:18] is a high tower
[51:20] interesting
[51:22] right
[51:23] you take that definition it connects us
[51:25] back to the Tower of Babel connects us
[51:27] back to that mountain
[51:29] there there's a way that Satan is
[51:31] wanting these mountain peaks himself
[51:32] he's one in this high mountain it is a
[51:35] fortified structure rising to a
[51:36] considerable height in order to repel
[51:39] and attack or enable a Watchman to see
[51:40] in every direction that's that City that
[51:43] came he built for Enoch that waking
[51:45] place
[51:46] where he could set watch built a city to
[51:49] get elevation to be able to see who
[51:52] would be coming after him it's a City
[51:53] built that fortification that dwelling
[51:55] is built by fear
[51:58] it's not not to reach God not to be
[52:00] closer to Heaven it's not inviting it's
[52:02] not welcoming it's not hospitable it's
[52:03] hostile
[52:05] and now pergos if we use that definition
[52:07] it's it's a rising city city that's set
[52:11] Upon A Mountain uh that it that it might
[52:13] be be defensible against any attack
[52:18] fortified structure with this
[52:20] considerable height to to escape
[52:22] punishment or judgment just as it was in
[52:24] the Tower of Babylon
[52:27] but in the Greek that's used
[52:30] pergamus means something else per is
[52:33] abundance or thoroughness
[52:35] and gamos is marriage
[52:38] so there's others that look at this word
[52:40] and say that it does not actually mean a
[52:42] mountain or high tower which means
[52:44] enough to me
[52:45] but the other definition it may is more
[52:48] appropriate more accurate is this one of
[52:50] Thoroughly married
[52:53] and that's what this pergamist
[52:54] represents it's a thorough mixing
[52:57] it's to be a total mixing together of
[53:00] identities
[53:01] you've taken one identity politics
[53:03] you've taken another identity
[53:05] Christianity and you so thoroughly mix
[53:07] it together toward now it's become one
[53:10] now now it's become a hybrid now it's
[53:13] become something different than it was
[53:15] in the beginning and brother Brown is
[53:17] that's the definition that brother
[53:18] Branham uses is Thoroughly married and
[53:20] there's a there's a lot of
[53:22] a lot of scholarship to back that up I
[53:24] don't need the scholarship I'm just
[53:26] saying that for the scholars
[53:27] the fact that brother Branham felt
[53:29] impressed and inspired to use that one
[53:32] it's because this is what's happening
[53:33] catch how perfect this is Batman says
[53:36] The Offspring of that Union of this
[53:38] thorough mixing in in this thoroughly
[53:40] married in pergamus The Offspring of
[53:43] that Union have been consistently the
[53:45] most horrible hybrids the world has ever
[53:46] seen and we're not talking about cars
[53:50] the most horrible hybrids the world has
[53:51] ever seen the truth is not in them but
[53:54] all the evil ways of Cain the first
[53:56] hybrid is
[53:58] Kane the Prius I mean is that what he is
[54:01] the truth is not in him but all the evil
[54:03] ways of Cain the first hybrid is they're
[54:06] all if he's going back saying now that
[54:08] we've had this thorough mixing in this
[54:09] marriage of government power religious
[54:11] political power with Christianity with
[54:13] religion now that we've mingled it
[54:15] together he said they have all the ways
[54:16] of caning them
[54:18] they're hybrid just like Kane Was Not
[54:20] only was State and church wedded in this
[54:22] age but the Babylonian religion was
[54:25] officially joined to the first church
[54:28] this is something that maybe a lot of
[54:31] people just who are looking at these and
[54:34] uh wrestling with these truths and
[54:36] looking at church history very hard for
[54:37] them to fully grasp and appreciate
[54:39] what's happening when the church
[54:41] organized and just how diabolical
[54:43] organized religion was and just how
[54:45] Satan had access to those hierarchies
[54:48] and those unscriptural modes uh to
[54:50] control and to subjugate and keep keep
[54:53] the people in bondage and keep the word
[54:54] away from them listen I'm I'm going
[54:56] through this with this whole other
[54:58] thought in my mind of chasing away the
[55:01] ghost of Catholicism banishing from our
[55:03] psyche all the Shadows that are in the
[55:05] box everything that might be in the
[55:07] system that that's it to fuzzying up our
[55:10] interpretation and it causes us to act
[55:12] out of some sort of Duty to the church
[55:16] instead of love for Christ
[55:21] he said that religion is born married
[55:23] and Satan now has access to the name of
[55:25] Christ it was enthroned as God In
[55:27] Worship
[55:28] he says this is the Beast of Revelations
[55:30] 13 this Roman Empire now married with
[55:32] the Roman Catholic Church this is that
[55:34] beast in Revelations 13.
[55:37] Satan had accomplished another mingling
[55:41] he had intermingled nemrod's religion
[55:44] with Christianity
[55:46] and so exactly what he did
[55:49] in Eden
[55:51] he's now done after the New Creations
[55:54] are born after the Christian church is
[55:56] born after the seed of Genesis 3 has
[55:58] come forth and he's burnt forth a
[56:00] religion that is connecting men back
[56:02] before the fall he takes his he takes
[56:05] his religion the satanic Babylonian
[56:09] religion which we could say is the
[56:11] Serpent's religion and he marries it
[56:13] with Christianity
[56:16] and he mixes them together just as he
[56:18] did in Eden he's now married them
[56:20] together
[56:22] now our Pursuit and our brother Brown
[56:24] does Christianity versus idolatry he
[56:26] studies a lot in hislops to Babylons he
[56:28] brings us a lot of different places to
[56:30] be able to recognize enough sufficiently
[56:32] enough to say oh that's Catholicism
[56:36] that's denominationalism that's this and
[56:39] to be able to recognize these heirs but
[56:41] there's a real danger in becoming the
[56:43] anti-catholic
[56:45] right it's important enough just to
[56:47] recognize some of these things that we
[56:48] need to root out and borrow our stuff
[56:50] away from certain things but this isn't
[56:52] an invitation just to try to drive down
[56:54] real deep into oh did you know that
[56:55] Nimrod married this person and Imran
[56:57] married that person then you get in the
[56:58] history of it they didn't even exist at
[56:59] the same time
[57:01] because we've gotten so caught up in the
[57:03] conspiracy theories
[57:05] and all the oral tradition and
[57:08] everything else that builds up around
[57:10] the legends that build up around the
[57:12] truth man just cut to the truth
[57:22] I'll have to remember that later I'll
[57:24] share it in to the patreon
[57:26] uh clients
[57:29] say he's married nimrod's religion with
[57:32] Christianity now I'm going to jump
[57:34] quickly to the end the culmination of
[57:37] this mixing is the great harlot in
[57:39] Revelation 17 and 18.
[57:42] that's the process is complete
[57:45] that all along there are some there's
[57:47] something Satan's trying to achieve and
[57:49] I I think it is a chess match with Satan
[57:51] he knows God's will but you could see
[57:52] where God at every turn is doing things
[57:55] where Satan maybe didn't expect I even
[57:57] think with the whole idea in in Genesis
[57:59] chapter 10 I could just picture Satan
[58:01] over there you know he's playing rummy
[58:03] with his buddies and he's just like man
[58:05] is this amazing Noah's great-grandson
[58:09] he's worshiping us like it didn't even
[58:12] take very long and here we are this is
[58:14] awesome and and so in his mind he might
[58:18] be thinking this is just on a lot
[58:19] quicker track than I thought it was
[58:21] but he doesn't ever stop
[58:23] even to where when he tempts Christ he
[58:25] shows him all the kingdoms of the world
[58:26] that have been and will be and and he's
[58:28] so this is this is where we're going
[58:30] this is what we're going to do but
[58:31] there's a part to him that's missing
[58:34] it's a part to him that he does not yet
[58:35] see
[58:37] but this process is complete in
[58:39] Revelation 17 and 18.
[58:41] in Revelation 17 18 not sure if there's
[58:44] kind of a neat you know Glory type there
[58:46] but it says and the woman which thou
[58:47] sawest in that great City
[58:50] just as the beginning of Satan's Eden
[58:52] and his kingdom
[58:54] is Babylon the Tower of Babel that's
[58:57] Satan's first capital
[58:59] was a city now the woman which thou
[59:02] sawest is that great City
[59:05] that's
[59:07] the woman
[59:08] is a city
[59:11] which reigneth over the kings of the
[59:14] Earth
[59:15] when you see second Corinthians 4 4 the
[59:17] God of this world
[59:18] this is the kingdom which reigneth over
[59:20] the kings of the Earth the woman which
[59:23] you saw is that great City so as John
[59:25] saw a woman she symbolically represents
[59:28] a city
[59:29] the way the describes her through this
[59:31] symbolic language it's obvious
[59:34] that it's
[59:35] can't be taken too literal
[59:38] but it's symbolically representing some
[59:40] and and the the writer the one Speaking
[59:43] helps us to understand it no the woman
[59:45] you saw as a city
[59:47] brother Brown picks it up in the church
[59:49] age book he says and in Revelation 17
[59:51] God
[59:52] does not any longer refer to pergamus as
[59:55] Satan's seat
[59:56] nor does he say that is where Satan
[59:58] dwells no the throne room is no longer
[1:00:02] in pergamus
[1:00:03] but it is Mystery Babylon
[1:00:06] so to whatever extent it existed there
[1:00:09] in pergamus and had and and there's a I
[1:00:12] guess there's just even a lot of history
[1:00:13] to it how it's being married through the
[1:00:16] the the pope and these these rulers and
[1:00:18] these priest Kings and how that's
[1:00:19] married there in pergamus he said but
[1:00:21] that just shows you Satan's design he
[1:00:24] says it's moved and he says it is
[1:00:27] Mystery Babylon
[1:00:29] it is not in Babylon but in mystery
[1:00:33] Babylon
[1:00:35] in Revelation 17 5 says and upon her
[1:00:37] forehead this woman that John sees upon
[1:00:40] her forehead was a name written mystery
[1:00:42] Babylon the Great
[1:00:44] the mother of harlots
[1:00:46] and Abominations of the Earth
[1:00:51] it's
[1:00:52] interesting to take note that after Eve
[1:00:54] had done after the woman had done what
[1:00:56] she had done she was named
[1:00:58] the mother of all living
[1:01:01] and now in the end when Satan has
[1:01:03] achieved the culmination of his mixing
[1:01:04] and his Eden upon the forehead of this
[1:01:07] woman which is that great city is named
[1:01:10] mystery
[1:01:13] and then if I could just say this way
[1:01:15] mystery Babylon the great the mother of
[1:01:18] harlots the mother of the Abominations
[1:01:20] of the Earth
[1:01:22] oh what a saying Abominations of the
[1:01:24] Earth the mother of harlots of the Earth
[1:01:27] Babylon the great of the Earth
[1:01:30] notice how that that would just ring
[1:01:32] mystery Babylon the great of the Earth
[1:01:35] I know I'm just reading it this way but
[1:01:37] I want you to recognize where this where
[1:01:39] it's at the mother of harlots of the
[1:01:41] Earth
[1:01:42] and Abominations of the Earth
[1:01:44] mystery Babylon is a woman
[1:01:47] not a wife
[1:01:50] it's not called a wife
[1:01:51] but she's called a mother
[1:01:54] she's called a harlot
[1:01:56] mystery Babylon the Great
[1:01:59] the mother of harlots and Abominations
[1:02:01] of the Earth
[1:02:03] it is this contradiction to Heaven's
[1:02:06] mystery
[1:02:07] because it's a mystery of the Earth
[1:02:09] she's described as a filthy City I'm not
[1:02:11] going to go through all the different
[1:02:12] scriptures that are in this but it's the
[1:02:14] Pinnacle it's the Capstone it's the
[1:02:15] culmination of Satan's Eden
[1:02:18] Revelations 18 contains her judgment
[1:02:21] The Babylon is Hell's mystery
[1:02:25] and the world the world's Glory
[1:02:28] the Earth has produced Abominations the
[1:02:31] Earth has produced harlots to her it is
[1:02:33] Babylon the great of the Earth
[1:02:36] this is Satan's Eden
[1:02:38] this is it comes to a head in the end
[1:02:40] time is something so close and I know
[1:02:43] we're all scratching our head saying man
[1:02:44] this Pope is a quack
[1:02:45] but it's so close now that it's he says
[1:02:48] it's a Pentecostal move not that we
[1:02:50] would get all those Pentecostal kitties
[1:02:52] many robbed on the wrong way they're all
[1:02:53] just a bunch of pennies no no no no no
[1:02:54] no no no no it just shows that Satan has
[1:02:57] moved all the way up right up to even
[1:02:59] the restoration of the gifts and the
[1:03:01] outpouring of the spirit of God and he
[1:03:03] can come right out he comes right up to
[1:03:05] that in all his impersonations but the
[1:03:07] one thing he can't cross over into is
[1:03:10] the bright age
[1:03:11] they just just can't do it because
[1:03:13] that's where light is at
[1:03:21] so this is Babylon hell's mystery
[1:03:24] the Earth
[1:03:26] I want to say world but the Earth Glory
[1:03:29] but what about God's mystery
[1:03:31] is that where it all just ends up I've
[1:03:33] been looking at wanting to get into it
[1:03:34] God willing maybe in the next few
[1:03:36] Services we have a chance to identify
[1:03:37] where brother Branham sees the pre the
[1:03:39] bride and sees the success of church
[1:03:42] ages and then when it gets to Lao to see
[1:03:44] it these are my words the stomach turns
[1:03:46] he's just so discouraged and
[1:03:48] disappointed a naked church this is what
[1:03:51] it produces
[1:03:52] dancing to the beat of rock and roll
[1:03:54] music
[1:03:55] that's the culmination of Satan's Aiden
[1:03:58] that's the climax of the church the
[1:04:01] process of hybrid it is complete he's
[1:04:03] mixed it all up organized religion
[1:04:05] everything in the end it's all come to
[1:04:07] that place and again Devil's like boom
[1:04:09] we got him
[1:04:11] we got him Restoration of the gifts
[1:04:13] three life Messengers we've had all
[1:04:15] their death message we've come to the
[1:04:16] Restorations we've been able to
[1:04:17] assimilate all in just 15 short years
[1:04:19] we've been able to organize Pentecost
[1:04:21] and he feels great and then God raises
[1:04:23] up this simpleton out of Kentucky
[1:04:26] with no denominator we say no
[1:04:28] denominational affiliation but no
[1:04:29] denominational organization backing so
[1:04:31] to speak no no education is what I mean
[1:04:34] that he comes up and he's and God raises
[1:04:36] this one up comes brings them right out
[1:04:38] of the systems right out of uh the the
[1:04:40] Baptist system even with the uh with the
[1:04:44] this embracing by the Pentecostals what
[1:04:46] is God raising him bringing up to be he
[1:04:49] is God's voice
[1:04:51] God's Gonna use him as a voice because
[1:04:53] now in this moment where he's just so
[1:04:56] shell-shocked with the perversion of
[1:04:58] laodicea descending Into Darkness and
[1:05:00] Chaos I'm just preaching it now he then
[1:05:03] sees the bride will come and breathe you
[1:05:06] again and what is it it's every nation
[1:05:09] every nation is represented and what
[1:05:12] does it say in Revelations that every
[1:05:14] nation upon the face of the Earth had
[1:05:16] been made drunk with the wine of her
[1:05:18] fornication every Merchant every King
[1:05:21] every priest of every nation has been
[1:05:23] swadded by Babylon but what about God's
[1:05:26] mystery
[1:05:27] Psalms 24 1 2 and 3 the Earth is the
[1:05:30] Lord's and the fullness thereof the
[1:05:33] world and they that dwell in there the
[1:05:35] Earth is the Lord then where is the
[1:05:37] Lord's Earth where are they that dwell
[1:05:39] in that are the Lords for he hath
[1:05:41] founded upon the Seas and establish it
[1:05:43] upon the floods in the beginning God and
[1:05:46] it says who shall Ascend into the hill
[1:05:48] of the Lord
[1:05:50] or who shall stand in his holy place
[1:05:53] this city which sets on Seven Hills the
[1:05:55] one that are the one that represents
[1:05:56] itself is the Pinnacle in the peak of
[1:05:58] God's glory who shall stand
[1:06:01] Ascend into the hill of the Lord notice
[1:06:03] that image of this impersonation
[1:06:05] who shall stand in his holy Place those
[1:06:07] standing in this Unholy place but who
[1:06:09] shall stand in his holy place
[1:06:11] and just as it is we see Revelation 17
[1:06:14] and 18 that great city is this is
[1:06:18] represented by This Woman This Mother of
[1:06:20] harlots this mother of Abominations
[1:06:23] this
[1:06:25] Babylon as he calls it
[1:06:27] in Revelations 19 verses 7 to 8
[1:06:30] let us be glad and rejoice
[1:06:32] and give honor to him
[1:06:34] for the marriage of the Lamb has come
[1:06:39] and his wife it doesn't say woman
[1:06:41] his wife hath made herself ready
[1:06:46] but is it her saying let us
[1:06:48] make us no because verse 8 and to her
[1:06:51] was granted
[1:06:53] that she should be a raid in fine linen
[1:06:55] clean and white for the fine linen is
[1:06:57] the righteousness of the Saints rather
[1:06:59] than called it his word his
[1:07:00] righteousness
[1:07:02] Revelations 18 4 Revelations 4 1 brings
[1:07:05] the bride to the invisible Union of
[1:07:07] Revelations 19.
[1:07:08] it says the marriage of the Lamb has
[1:07:11] come
[1:07:12] you have to catch that
[1:07:14] brother Brandon preaches the future home
[1:07:16] of the Heavenly bridegroom and the
[1:07:17] Earthly bride has any of you been
[1:07:18] studying that listening to it
[1:07:20] I thank God that I've taken so long
[1:07:23] to get to this what in the beginning as
[1:07:26] I preached the first serve the last
[1:07:27] service the first in the first service
[1:07:29] what I'm looking at I've just had more
[1:07:32] time to continue to study and if I could
[1:07:34] just be honest I almost feel like I was
[1:07:36] so shallow
[1:07:37] in the beginning and how I was
[1:07:39] approaching the future home
[1:07:41] not recognizing that some of the things
[1:07:43] that's that kind of stand out in that
[1:07:45] it's just Brother Brad I'm laying the
[1:07:47] appropriate Foundation
[1:07:50] to to understand what's happening now
[1:07:54] there's this idea of what's going to be
[1:07:56] and kind of connecting these things
[1:07:58] together and the real the real kicker
[1:08:01] that's at the heart of what he's saying
[1:08:02] here as he preaches the future home of
[1:08:04] the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly
[1:08:05] bride is to recognize if it's a Heavenly
[1:08:08] bridegroom
[1:08:09] and an Earthly bride
[1:08:12] there has got to be that's got to be a
[1:08:15] wedding
[1:08:17] and a marriage between the Heavenly and
[1:08:20] Earthly
[1:08:22] and he says at the very beginning of the
[1:08:24] future home of the Heavenly bridegroom
[1:08:25] and the Earthly bride and now this
[1:08:26] morning I have a very important subject
[1:08:28] to me it's a very Blissful one
[1:08:31] I hope it strikes you the same way that
[1:08:34] wedding Bliss that wedding day Bliss
[1:08:37] and if I could only give it in the
[1:08:39] inspiration I received it in be
[1:08:41] wonderful but that'll be up to God to do
[1:08:43] that
[1:08:44] that means anybody could read this and
[1:08:47] get some inspiration and draw some
[1:08:50] factual details from it but it takes God
[1:08:52] to give it an inspiration that he
[1:08:55] received it in
[1:08:57] and if I could say this way the carnal
[1:08:59] mind will never see the Deep revelation
[1:09:01] of God it'll only be able to draw from
[1:09:03] its statistics just like anybody could
[1:09:06] from the Bible
[1:09:08] we can just take scripture and compare
[1:09:10] scripture to scripture we could just
[1:09:11] take these details we could break this
[1:09:13] word down we could define this word and
[1:09:15] we could put all that together but a lot
[1:09:17] of that's just going to be forming a
[1:09:18] scriptural basis for the Deep revelation
[1:09:20] of God because that's the only thing
[1:09:22] that God could give
[1:09:24] for the marriage of the Lamb has come
[1:09:26] that's the Heavenly bridegroom and his
[1:09:29] wife is an Earthly bride
[1:09:31] this is the very image that's set before
[1:09:34] us as soon as Revelation 17 comes into
[1:09:36] view and her judgment is spoken of in
[1:09:38] Revelations 18 it says but wait there's
[1:09:40] more
[1:09:42] come on Paul Harvey give me the rest of
[1:09:45] the story and what do you have you have
[1:09:47] oh Revelations 19 the Lamb's wife it has
[1:09:52] made herself ready in the union the
[1:09:54] marriage has come in Psalms 48 1 2 and 3
[1:09:58] great is the Lord and greatly to be
[1:09:59] praised in the city of our God
[1:10:02] in the mountain of his holiness
[1:10:05] beautiful for situation the joy of the
[1:10:08] whole earth what a contradiction
[1:10:11] the contradiction to the Abominations of
[1:10:13] the Earth the harness of the Earth but
[1:10:15] now there's a habitation now there's a
[1:10:18] beautiful situation now there's the joy
[1:10:20] of the whole earth is Mount Zion
[1:10:23] oh Hallelujah here's your bride the
[1:10:26] Mount Zion Showdown on the sides of the
[1:10:29] North
[1:10:30] the very place that Satan made his
[1:10:32] ambition in Isaiah 14 the sides of the
[1:10:35] north the city of the great king
[1:10:39] Hallelujah the city of the great king
[1:10:41] God is known in her palaces for Refuge
[1:10:43] God is known as a mighty warrior in her
[1:10:46] place God is known among her as a
[1:10:48] fortress and a fortification
[1:10:51] this and we see that natural Jerusalem
[1:10:53] is only a type of this spiritual
[1:10:55] Jerusalem
[1:10:56] that's this place that Lucifers desired
[1:10:58] all along as we see the very sides of
[1:11:00] the North in his ambition in Isaiah 14
[1:11:02] 13.
[1:11:04] and I read this in closing
[1:11:06] if our brothers would come to their
[1:11:07] instruments
[1:11:08] I know there's there's a lot a mouthful
[1:11:11] in these few things I'm about to read to
[1:11:12] you but in the future home of the
[1:11:14] Heavenly bridegroom an Earthly bride the
[1:11:16] other man makes a statement the kingdom
[1:11:18] of God is in the earth now
[1:11:21] in the hearts of his Saints
[1:11:23] it is his attributes that he began in
[1:11:25] the beginning
[1:11:27] wow
[1:11:29] it's his attributes that he began in the
[1:11:31] beginning
[1:11:33] could I just try to give you a quick
[1:11:34] overview
[1:11:36] that if Satan in the beginning sowed his
[1:11:37] seat of discrepancy and it comes to Cain
[1:11:40] and he starts formal religion
[1:11:42] and then Cain this carries over after
[1:11:45] the flood toward now that strain is
[1:11:48] identified in nimrod
[1:11:50] and then from there former religion
[1:11:52] Pagan religion polytheism the worship of
[1:11:55] other things spreads out
[1:11:57] around the whole world the whole Earth
[1:12:01] dispersed from Genesis of dispersed
[1:12:03] around the world so now there's your
[1:12:05] Heathen there's your reprobate
[1:12:07] and now that just continues on that
[1:12:10] history just Marches On
[1:12:11] but among the heathens which they were
[1:12:14] all Gentiles which was Nations or people
[1:12:16] Gentiles becomes a phrase to just
[1:12:18] describe hybrid blood
[1:12:20] right that's that's what they are
[1:12:21] Gentiles God from the Gentiles calls a
[1:12:25] man named Abram
[1:12:27] and it doesn't come from South America
[1:12:28] doesn't call him from Spain doesn't call
[1:12:30] he calls him right out of UR right after
[1:12:33] caldea right at the seat
[1:12:35] and he's going to call him out
[1:12:37] of Babylon
[1:12:39] and that that drops down and here's a
[1:12:41] people the children
[1:12:43] the seat of Abraham the one to whom the
[1:12:45] true God revealed himself
[1:12:48] the one whose Glory was lost in the
[1:12:49] beginning
[1:12:51] and there starts Judaism the children
[1:12:54] the Israelites and then the story of the
[1:12:58] world is told through one nation
[1:13:00] but that nation is founded upon a
[1:13:02] promise that the seed will come which is
[1:13:04] Christ
[1:13:05] so why Satan's Eden is expanding
[1:13:08] and religion is forming and all sorts of
[1:13:10] duplicities and multiplicities of
[1:13:12] religions and ideas and theologies and
[1:13:14] allegories and stories is that's just
[1:13:16] developing God is developing one people
[1:13:18] one nation and giving them one land that
[1:13:20] from there the seed would come
[1:13:22] and when that seed come and I gotta go a
[1:13:25] little bit faster than what I'm wanting
[1:13:26] to do here but God now from Christ he's
[1:13:30] the head of a new race
[1:13:32] he's the head of another kingdom
[1:13:34] and there's Judas of the other Kingdom
[1:13:37] right there within Judaism Judas a Jew
[1:13:42] ready to betray Christ
[1:13:45] in Christ through that Christ's death
[1:13:47] burial and Resurrection which the
[1:13:48] princes of this world didn't know this
[1:13:49] would happen
[1:13:51] and through his death Resurrection
[1:13:52] sending back to church he inaugurates
[1:13:54] now True Religion
[1:13:56] the worship of the one true God where
[1:13:58] now it's not God above us but now it's
[1:14:00] God With Us the very image that God is
[1:14:02] tracking and foreshadow in the beginning
[1:14:03] now he's birthing Children of the
[1:14:05] Kingdom bringing forth his seed they're
[1:14:07] all being made manifest they're they're
[1:14:09] his sons and daughters of God eternity's
[1:14:10] been birth in them that begins on the
[1:14:12] day of Pentecost and that UNF that
[1:14:14] starts flooding out
[1:14:16] and then Satan takes his Antichrist
[1:14:18] religion and starts marrying it with
[1:14:20] Christianity
[1:14:22] so when we come to this end time and
[1:14:24] brother Branham says
[1:14:26] God the kingdom of God is on earth now
[1:14:28] in the hearts of his Saints it's his
[1:14:29] attributes that begin the beginning in
[1:14:31] other words it's filling up to where
[1:14:33] it's complete now
[1:14:35] because when the bride is gone there's
[1:14:37] no more salvation
[1:14:39] when the bride is gone it's just whoever
[1:14:40] had their confession of Faith at that
[1:14:42] time once tribulation sets in and the
[1:14:44] Incarnation of Satan among his people is
[1:14:46] becomes complete and and he rides out in
[1:14:49] the Fulfillment of Prophecy in that hour
[1:14:51] think of it where is the kingdom of God
[1:14:54] now
[1:14:55] let's not put it off to the Millennium
[1:14:57] let's not put it off to the eighth day
[1:15:00] this is what is so inspiring to brother
[1:15:03] Branham in my opinion is not just to be
[1:15:05] able to track the trail of the serpent
[1:15:07] not just be able to talk about the
[1:15:08] future home because a lot of people can
[1:15:09] chart that just by reading the Bible but
[1:15:12] it's to understand that now God has
[1:15:15] brought his bride through a process
[1:15:18] oh Hallelujah brings us right up to this
[1:15:21] place to recognize here we are in our
[1:15:23] positional placing at the end time
[1:15:27] he says there's attributes that begin in
[1:15:29] the beginning
[1:15:30] you have the beast at the beginning the
[1:15:31] beast at the end what but about the word
[1:15:33] in the beginning
[1:15:35] what about the God in the beginning what
[1:15:37] about the Tree of Life in the beginning
[1:15:38] what about the Christ in the beginning
[1:15:39] and the Christ at the end
[1:15:41] [Music]
[1:15:43] just as the Bible says for the marriage
[1:15:45] of the Lamb has come in Revelations 21
[1:15:48] and John says I saw the holy city New
[1:15:52] Jerusalem coming down from God out of
[1:15:55] Heaven not a city coming up from the
[1:15:57] pits of Hell mystery Babylon the great
[1:16:00] the mother of the Hornets of the Earth
[1:16:02] the mother of the Abominations of the
[1:16:03] Earth but now the city New Jerusalem
[1:16:06] coming from God out of God from Heaven
[1:16:09] prepared as a bride adorned for her
[1:16:12] husband oh there's another woman that's
[1:16:15] a mystery
[1:16:16] it is the mystery of Heaven it is the
[1:16:19] Earth's Glory
[1:16:21] and brother Adam says are you ready this
[1:16:23] is the city that Abraham was looking for
[1:16:26] in a prophet he knew that city was
[1:16:28] somewhere
[1:16:32] one rolls up a city and God called
[1:16:34] Abraham out so I'm going to bring you to
[1:16:37] a city
[1:16:39] there's another city that's more
[1:16:41] glorious than the towers of Babel
[1:16:43] there's another city that's more
[1:16:45] glorious than all the kingdoms of
[1:16:46] Babylon and oh Abraham was concerned
[1:16:50] with that vision and the city that he
[1:16:52] looked for is this New Jerusalem which
[1:16:54] you are the attributes of on Earth today
[1:16:56] now
[1:16:57] [Music]
[1:16:58] the Bible says for he looked for a city
[1:17:00] which hath foundations
[1:17:02] Genesis 10 Genesis 11 let us make us a
[1:17:06] city in a tower
[1:17:07] let us make bricks thoroughly
[1:17:10] let's build the foundations thereof let
[1:17:12] us make us a name for ourselves but
[1:17:15] Abraham's Vision was I'm looking for a
[1:17:17] city that has foundations whose Builder
[1:17:20] and maker is God
[1:17:22] Abraham sought a City built by God
[1:17:26] I felt like the one
[1:17:27] the one zesters in Babylon
[1:17:30] and that's what I'm seeking I don't want
[1:17:32] a legacy of my ancestors
[1:17:34] I want the faith of my fathers
[1:17:37] I want the original the real the living
[1:17:38] I want the Christ that's being revealed
[1:17:41] in this word I know I shared a lot with
[1:17:43] you today
[1:17:45] that wasn't there was nothing quick
[1:17:46] about that
[1:17:47] I know I shared a lot with you
[1:17:50] but I I know that there's something in
[1:17:52] here if God can just Quicken it to you I
[1:17:55] know there's something in here that can
[1:17:56] be a blessing to you I know it
[1:17:57] I know it can help you not just through
[1:17:59] a church service but even on a Monday
[1:18:01] morning
[1:18:02] as fellowshipping with the brother
[1:18:04] and and he's just sharing some uh God's
[1:18:08] just moving I'll just say this God's
[1:18:10] moving in beautiful remarkable ways just
[1:18:12] even amongst the brothers in Arizona the
[1:18:14] fellowship among his ministers the
[1:18:16] Revelation is breaking and young
[1:18:17] ministers and and they're teaching
[1:18:19] things and things are opening up and
[1:18:21] they're just reaching out and we're
[1:18:22] fellowshipping on it and we're just
[1:18:24] fellowshipping I just asked the question
[1:18:25] all right what's this going to mean for
[1:18:26] me on Monday morning and the brother
[1:18:28] just brings it right down to a reality
[1:18:29] said God is moving
[1:18:31] we should we are we should be so excited
[1:18:33] I I've been I've been just kind of
[1:18:36] tracking a thought to minister on Dry
[1:18:38] Bones no more
[1:18:40] this isn't a valley of dry bones anymore
[1:18:43] this Valley
[1:18:44] [Music]
[1:18:46] High bones anymore
[1:18:47] you're a dry bones there's a word that
[1:18:50] can raise up these dry bones and cause
[1:18:53] them to live and you are the Bears of
[1:18:55] this life that from you is streaming
[1:18:57] from you all right there's a fountain of
[1:19:00] Living Water for the dry bones in this
[1:19:02] desert oh how do I thank God for the
[1:19:04] Brad's Revival in this end time
[1:19:05] beautiful things are happening we ought
[1:19:08] to be enthused with what God is doing in
[1:19:10] this end time God bless you let's stand
