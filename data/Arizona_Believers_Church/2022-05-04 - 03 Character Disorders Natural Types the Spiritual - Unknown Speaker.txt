TRANSCRIPT
========================================
and my title is my subtitle is the natural types the spiritual so we're continuing on the kind of this segment that we visit every once in a while on character disorders this is the third one so it's not like there's been a lot of of ground covered and i want to use the thought of the natural types of spiritual and i am kind of coming back just feeling very led to go back over some foundational things so we could kind of lay a little bit stronger bedrock on this for the things that we want to explore in the future as god would lead and i really um invite you to focus because there's a there's kind of a theme that is going to come through this that i believe you have to be real perseverant to kind of catch now just look again at our text romans chapter 1 verse 20 it says for the invisible things of him the invisible things of god from the creation of the world are clearly seen and that's quite a statement that the invisible things of god from the creation of the world are clearly seen being understood by the things that are made and that's the statement to me that kind of gives me the foundation for this the the subtitle natural types the spiritual says even his eternal power and godhead so that they are without excuse from the creation of the world paul has wanted us to kind of ponder that since god created things that are visible since creation humanity is gazed upon god's creation and it's god's creation that declares his character and so it's as humankind whether they believe in a god or not as they look at things created they're looking at the nature of god and the character of god and it tells us that even his eternal power and divine nature are expressed in natural things and we we may not believe in a god we may not believe in the authority of scripture but anytime we look out and we see creation we see the stars we see the earth we see the uh we see animal life we even see human life you're seeing the handiwork of god therefore paul is even put in this sense that because there's things that are living there's things that are created that the atheist is without excuse even if he never hears the gospel preach it says they are without excuse because the creation holds something in it that can cause us to understand invisible things of god maybe not all of god but yet the invisible things of god are clearly seen and understood by the creation the things that were made and we recognize this statement being it's very familiar to us knowing how much brother branham used this uh emphasis that the natural types the spiritual he says in one place god uh always types the spiritual by the natural and so there's a there's some symmetry there's some relationship and connection between the natural world and the spiritual world even to where even without the bible brother graham says god's character is expressed he would still believe in god and i believe this scripture is speaking to that the invisible things of god are understood by the things that are made because in the things that are made nature there is an image of god or there's a type of the spiritual things of god it says in hebrews 11 verse 3 through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of god so the things which are seen were not made of things which do appears we by faith believe that god created the heavens and the earth that's the one thing that we can maybe identify when it comes to science and study and academics you probably can't get very many scientists to agree on how the world was created but christians all christians agree that by faith we believe god created the heavens and the earth the worlds were framed by the word of god therefore the things that we see are made by things which do not appear so again there's the invisible god that cannot be seen expressing himself through his creation and it's from these scriptures we begin to get this uh this image of there's a spiritual side which is not seen but then there's a natural side that is seen and in in one sense and i want to kind of bring out maybe a couple senses to this in one sense there is a spiritual unseen reality that this natural life that we're living in now and the things that we experience now are a type of or a shadow of in other words this life is a shadow of another life this life is a type or is in the image of a greater life so we create this difference between a higher life a spiritual life spiritual things and then what is earthly what is seen now and what we call the natural life and so the things we taste and see and smell the things you experience the places we go and everything that's related to creation and nature and even our human lives are saying there's some there's something expressed in life that is a type of eternal life there's something expressed in our natural lives that is a type of god's own life for his nature and character so it's in that sense when we say the natural is one thing the spiritual is another paul in talking about the new bodies that we're going to receive writes it this way in first corinthians chapter 15 verses 44 to 47. talking about the natural a life it is sown a natural body it is raised a spiritual body and you'll notice back and forth natural spiritual natural spiritual there is a natural body and there is a spiritual body and so it is written the first man adam was made a living soul the last adam was made a quickening spirit i like how the bible says it's the last adam i think there's some i heard one time there's a doctrine out there called the third atom and uh well you can't really run that through the message of the hour but yet they try and so the last adam was made a quickening spirit so you have natural body spiritual body natural body spiritual body first man living soul last adam a quickening spirit how be it that was not first which is spiritual but that which is natural the natural came first he's saying and afterward that which is spiritual the first man is of the earth earthy the second man is the lord from heaven now paul is establishing it between the first adam and the last adam which is jesus christ and he's using even those two individuals first adam last adam adam in jesus christ as an example of the natural coming first but the spiritual coming second the first adam is the natural man he's comprised of soul spirit and body that triune being and and paul would say this is the natural man that is there's a natural body but when it dies it's going to be raised up in a spiritual body it's the natural that has come first it is our first nature we receive by our first birth our natural birth of our parents and he says but then there's a second adam a last adam which was made a quickening spirit he says the second man is the lord of heaven so christ represents a higher order it represents a heavenly order you could see this even through the the priesthood the aaronic priesthood uh which has an end the melchizedek priesthood which has no beginning and no end and there's a he's emphasizing and showing this there's a spiritual side to things there's a natural side to things there's an eternal side to things there's this carnal side of things and there's different ways of viewing this relationship between the natural and spiritual or maybe this dichotomy between spiritual things and natural things and and i'm and wanting to use both of them and so tonight is maybe me uh kind of going back and reframing some of these things we spoke already on this these character disorders so that we recognize where the emphasis is there is the distinction as we're just talking about between the spiritual with the capital s the heavenly things the spiritual things and natural things so the god who created all things who's invisible who's in a realm that we cannot see that we cannot feel that we cannot touch and all the things that he created that we relate to through those senses that's spiritual and natural heavenly earthly that's how paul captures it in these verses here and then how he's framing it in hebrews and romans that there's a spiritual side of things a divine and then there's an earthly but then there's another way of looking at the natural and spiritual and that would be in the relationship between the body and the spirit or you could even begin to look at it in other senses i guess if you just say things that are spiritual and things that are natural but there's a there's a way that there's things that are higher that are heavenly things that are natural but then there's a way that the natural types the spiritual between our body and our spirit and and i'm just kind of launching into my emphasis tonight on these character disorders there are spiritual there there are physical sicknesses okay i was wondering if i was gonna get an amen or we just deny them all right let's deny there is definitely a nasty little cold bug that's going around all over the place i hear from friends all over north america i've heard there's several families even in our church here that are suffering from just a real uh real nasty cold at least that's all we're calling it and uh so he says that there are there are there are physical sicknesses in our bodies that we have maladies and weaknesses and and diseases and things that relate to the physical body but there's also spiritual sicknesses there are mental maladies there's there's uh if we call what they call mental illnesses or breaches in the spirit the bible talks about when a man is healthy uh when he's sick his spirit will bear him up when in his infirmity he says but when the spirit is broken who can bear it so there's a brokenness to spirits there's a discouragement there's a depression there there's a even mental disorders that are different than a physical disorder and there are uh natural uh personality disorders that's what we've kind of introduced to a couple services or what we might call mental illnesses and that god can heal there are breaches in the spirit there's a brokenness that someone can have in their heart they're diagnosable or labels that the world would want to put on somebody that relates to a mental illness that god can heal that he can mend that he can deliver someone from and so in the same way that god can heal the body in the same way that god could take cancer and cause it to disappear the same way that god can actually supernaturally mend to bone how god could perform a miracle a physical sense on somebody causing a limb to straighten out or or some blood disease be taken away from someone the same god that can do that he's also able to heal the mind same god that can heal the body is the same god that can heal the heart says in first thessalonians 5 23 and the very god of peace sanctify you holy and i pray what a beautiful prayer and i pray god your whole spirit and i could say whole body whole soul and whole body your whole spirit and whole soul and whole body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our lord jesus christ when he asks that god would sanctify you holy it means complete perfect sound and then that your soul spirit and body be preserved blameless blameless means no defect and this is paul's prayer we could say oh i pray that your soul be preserved blameless well when you're born again it's sealed preserved blameless but paul does not just stop with the soul being preserved with no defect but he says your whole spirit and your whole body through some process be preserved so that there is no defect and he's saying this not he's not just saying it's about the soul which i believe we should all readily accept that once we're born again the soul is sealed it's in a perfect condition brother brown when he preaches future at home he's already putting it in the eighth day the soul is already there in the eighth day our spirits and our bodies just need to catch up to it and so paul is saying there is a perfecting a mending and a healing for the body and we usually can say amen to that but i'm also wanting to emphasize that your your inheritance also relates to the perfecting of your spirit there are character disorders that the word of god is correcting not just disorder in the body but character disorders that the word of god is perfecting there's a healing of the mind at the mending of our spirits but also this is where again i want to relate to the difference between uh the natural and the spiritual i and maybe i just need to slow down a bit and collect my thoughts that there's a healing to the body and there's a healing to the spirit in that even within the natural man now in our in a spiritual sense let's just take that as a type then as far as our character is concerned the word of god wants to perfect our characters he wants to he wants to take our thoughts and our thinking and our judgments and our discernments and he wants to also likewise perfect that part of us so there's a healing of a mind and a minion of our spirits but then there's also a perfecting of our character and and i'm looking at those as just two different things and when we use the phrase character disorders last time or you know over the last couple months these are things that natural personality disorders are a type of and that's the way we framed it in the very beginning that uh in the dsm manual that there's a there's certain 157 different disorders uh that people that the scientists use to try to categorize and put people in different categories based upon symptomatic behavior and things that they're exhibiting and and it relates solely to a medical diagnosis of someone's mental condition but then we we say well that's we leave that to the scientists maybe to put the labels on it and to diagnose and but then uh there is a another side to that we're looking in the sense that well a personality according to their own definitions is your character and that god is concerned about our character and that when we die the only thing that we take with us is our character and so there's something about our character that's important in the word of god and character disorders are the natural personality disorders can be type or a type of character disorders and so let me just uh let me just drop back a little bit and define a personality disorder this isn't a broad sense personality disorder is a type of mental disorder characterized by rigid an unhealthy pattern of thinking functioning and behaving now before you try to diagnose the neighbors in the apartment next door let's just look at this uh clinically let's just look at this academically it's a mental disorder characterized by a rigid unhealthy pattern of thinking functioning and behaving i think that rigid is an important aspect to it and then it's uh it's something that's stubborn it's there it's not easily overcome and it's an unhealthy way of thinking unhealthy way of behaving and functioning and relating to other people you find i think just by thinking about that you realize yeah this could have application spiritually this could have application in a different plane in a different order and they say that a person with a personality disorder struggles to perceive and relate to situations in others so if someone has a personality disorder and and there's a number of them we talked about the different clusters that they have for these they struggle to relate to other people they struggle in social situations they struggle uh in in perceiving situations and they can be very paranoid or they perceive it very very differently it's remarkable when you read stories or hear of different ones who've been afflicted with some of these personality disorders and for no reason all of a sudden they'll develop a suspicion uh that they're hearing voices or that someone is tracking them and this has happened you say oh that's for some crazy drug addict no this happens to well-educated otherwise very very healthy people uh and i know of lawyers very uh i'm not not to put make anybody worried i'm not a highly successful lawyer because i was gonna say lawyers that are highly successful uh well-paying jobs very standing uh outstanding in their field uh succumbed to a mental disorder where they perceived that they were being tracked by the government and and immediately begin to think oh because i represented such and such person and i did such and such work and they start to deteriorate in their relationships and they're paranoid with other people this is something that's characteristics of somebody who enters into this kind of mania and there's a it's widely believed that it's caused by genetic influences but also environmental influences in other words this is i think this is just broadly accepted that your dna may make one vulnerable to developing a personality disorder and then a life situation triggers it and to stress or trauma something happens even a physical injury can do things to where by your dna it can run in the family history but then it doesn't necessarily mean you're going to have it but then something happens and it kind of triggers the development of that personality disorder one of them we mentioned in the beginning i still i'm not going to be able to fully develop this as i wanted to in the beginning i realized i kind of jumped the gun even titling the first part the anti-spiritual personality disorder we drew it from the anti-social personality disorder so that's an actual personality disorder that's in in the manual and it is something that they say is it's the presence of a chronic or pervasive disposition to disregard and violate the rights of others huh okay just got real oh so they're crazy well maybe they are it says that manifestations include repeated violations of the law exploitation of others deceitfulness impulsivity aggressiveness reckless disregard for the safety of self and others irresponsibility accompanied by a lack of guilt a lack of remorse a lack of empathy this is what they would say is an anti-social personality disorder someone that disregards laws and norms and rules of society so we looked at that and i don't think we actually got to the point where we could do the type in part one is instead of maybe an anti-social personality disorder but an anti-spiritual personality disorder because to be anti-social doesn't mean you a shoe social being social and you're an introvert you don't talk to other people and you just kind of hide out in your home and never fellowshipping or never around people no some of the most anti-social people are very very sociable you know they because they uh they come across as gregarious and outgoing and can gain your confidence so to be anti-social is not to be an introvert it's true it's to be very very social but to work contrary to what would socially be normal and acceptable so an anti-spiritual personality disorder is not someone that disregards laws norms and rules of society but it's a disregard for the word in the order of the spirit while proposing to be spiritual where you see the impulsivity and the lack of accountability lack of remorse and repentance and the and the the traits that are characteristic of someone who has an anti-social personality disorder there's a way that we can examine our conduct our attitude towards others our behavior within the body of christ and ask ourselves am i acting in an anti-spiritual way we're indifferent it talks about indifferent routine manipulation exploitation violation of other people's rights and rule breaking there's a way that we can look at that spiritually say well i believe the message and i go to church and i believe all these things but yet you act in a manner which is inconsistent with what the word of god says a christian should act and and i'm saying you got an anti-spiritual personality disorder i pointed down the aisle sir one pointed anybody in particular i i missed you brother mike it went straight for straight underneath that table where that imp is hiding out that's a you can have this and it's important to examine ourselves i do i i profess the right things but it's my behavior my interaction with others am i not do i can can i not form the words i'm sorry can i not own up to my own mistakes and realize wow there's probably a way that we can begin to look at our uh characteristics as a christian and ask ourselves whether or not we're in the image of what a christian should be i think we use the terminology spiritual psychopath in the first one and how it's someone who's not walking not walking according to the word but they're walking according to their own values a psychopath if someone has their own value system it's not that they don't have rules and that that it's just they don't believe the rules apply to them and they have their own set of rules their own set of norms and we can be spiritual psychopaths when we are confessing to walk in truth but we refuse to humble ourselves to the word of god and continue to behave according to the word of god i want you just to even consider maybe the first and primary example of somebody that exhibited one of these mental illnesses in the bible just think about cain and how cain behaved and acted in the very beginning that he he made an offering of worship to god and is even instructed and corrected as to how he could make it right but refuses to do it and then murders his brother now as we use the phrase character disorders and we're looking at it in this natural types of spiritual that there can be maybe a medical clinical diagnosis of a person who has some sort of mental illness we're not saying that there's anything uh not we would have a mental illness but in a spiritual sense our character has to be properly developed and our character comes from the word of god that's where our character comes from as christians if we're born again christians our character comes from the word of god so we have spiritual genes we have a spiritual dna it's something that's not related to our natural dna but it's related to our spiritual relationship to christ the elect have a seed that contains certain characteristics and certain potentials do you believe that if you're a son or daughter of god you are elect of god then there was a seed inside of you that could be born again and in that new birth is a new life or new attributes new characteristics and a whole other set of potentials and so with the gene of god let me say this way if you have that seed with the gene of god you are vulnerable to developing perfect character all right so if you can in the world be born with a certain set of markers that make you vulnerable to developing a personality disorder then i believe that the natural types of spiritual that you by virtue of having the seed of god inside of you you are vulnerable to developing perfect character that it's related to the seed it's in the seed already and what we just need is a spirit an experience with the baptism of the holy ghost to trigger its development you may have the gene inside of you with all the potential and vulnerability to develop perfect character but if you're never born again by the baptism the holy ghost you can't it doesn't trigger the the opportunity for that life to come forward and be expressed in second corinthians chapter 5 verse 17 it says therefore if any man be in christ he is a new creature that means he is a new creation the same god who made the invisible god who made the visible things around us and in doing so expressed his nature is still in the business of creating and it says if any man be in christ and how are you in christ by one spirit you're baptized into the body of christ you become a new creation you have to think of this as something new and different than the old man old things are passed away behold all things are become new if you are a new creation a new creature you are a new creation there's a new constitution there's a new institution there's a new ordinance when you're born again there's a new disposition now realize there's still a struggle but i'm wanting you to be more mindful of is upon the new birth there's new life inside of you and this new life operates by a different kind of constitution it has a different disposition has different vulnerabilities different potentials if you have a history of bipolar disorder in your family if you have manic depresses in your family if you look back and there's all sorts of uh psychotic episodes to your family history when you're born again none of that carries over into the new birth experience i hope you i hope you recognize what i just said it doesn't carry over into the new life now that could still be in your flesh those things can still be there in your flesh but it's wholly different from the life that's been birthed inside of you because that germ came from god and the trigger to cause that to come to life came from god so it's holy a new nature brother brahm says you are a different person a different personality because you are a new creation think about that a new person a different a new creation is a different person and a different personality so there has to be there's something else expected of this person there's a new if i can put it this way there's a new personality to be developed there's a new life that has to be nurtured i think in the argument of nature and nurture when it comes to the individual or the person uh there's a whole lot that a whole lot related to your nature or your dna your parents that's going to determine what you're going to be but then there's a whole lot to your nurture that determines just how much you can develop within those parameters or how uh what things are triggered the negative sides to that dna it's all nature and nurture and listen it's the same thing by our natural our spiritual birth there's a new nature in the inside of you but then god just doesn't birth you and then throw you on a shelf and just leave you there until you can go birth the next one until we're all birthed and then he comes by and takes everybody on the shelf into the rapture no there's a nurture then of that nature to bring it into the expressed image of christ and so i would say then a character disorder and again i'm just laying this as a foundation so you can understand where my heart's coming from a character disorder is an imperfect expression of that personality bluebeam says you're a different person a different personality because you're a new creation a character disorder is an imperfect expression of that new different personality because the potentials are there there's no there's no son or daughter of god that is born uh with with some dna or some marker that relates to some disorder or some impairment it's a perfect seed now if you could it's we've we've laid the foundation now for a half hour and i want to now read a number of statements in uh for this in this next half of the service but please if you could think very very spiritually and and even press a little bit say lord i want to catch this i want to i want to recognize how this can be applicable to me in my heart and in my life and the message the greatest battle ever fought brother brahma says it got it it's got to come down the line of free moral agency you yourself let the word of god it's i think this is a very important concept that i i'll just say it even publicly to you that it's understandable that we would wrestle with the idea of election and free moral agency and how do these things how do these work together in the paradox of your chosen or by god you had no say in the matter well but then i've got to let god do something and it's it's a paradox isn't it i'm just going to leave it at that he says you don't come because your mother was a good woman you don't come because you're a good neighbor you come because that god calls you to come and you accept him on the basis of his word that's all you can do it's not it's not your mom is good or you're a good neighbor it's not anything you can do you don't even come on the basis of anything outward or emotional you come you accept him on the basis of his word that's that word what is what means everything that word if you can get everything out of the way all conscience all senses and just let the word come in that word will produce just exactly you catch that if you'll just let the word come in and then he refers to all conscience all senses then the word if it comes in and everything can be out of the way it'll produce just exactly he says here see what's it covered over with now you have to kind of maybe try to in your mind and i know that just by taking an excerpt from this passage because it's a very lengthy part where he's establishing a particular thought you have to kind of let your mind enter into the picture he's creating that the word has got to come into the person and he says but if you if you if you let get you have to get everything out of the way conscience and senses just let the word come in and then that word will produce exactly but he says see what's it covered over with i want you to look at it in this sense that the word can get covered over now it could be covered over externally to us where there's things in our spirits that are that are creating the distance and creating the gap clogging the channels to where we can't see the word of god we can't receive the word of god it's keeping it distant from us and those channels have to be kind of blown out and our heart has to open up he says you have to open up by line of free moral agency open up your heart and that can drop down into your heart and you can be born again but now i also want to take it a step further that once the word has been born again in your soul those channels still exist all those same senses that brother branham is talking about they still exist he says what it's what is it covered over with he says well these you say well his conscience and senses and so forth don't have anything to do with it brother branham certainly it does now this to me is very important because we say well it's the word in free moral agency it's the word and free moral agency and and i i remember one time i was preaching some meetings and i kind of i kind of set it up a little bit to where the i had a slide with a i think it was 70 something different emotional states on the slide and i said i want you to ponder these things and really uh find out whether or not you're characterized by any of these you struggle with any of these you know uh these things are real issues and so the next slide was you just need the holy ghost and i was kind of doing it to make a point and someone was like amen because there's more to it but i'm saying here that this the conscience and and memory and reason and affection and imagination these things are and even our are hearing and are seeing they're all related to it he says it doesn't have anything to do with it certainly it does he says but if you let the word come in and cover it over with conscience then it can't grow you catch that you let the word come in but now conscience is getting in the way imagination memory reason affection is getting away the word is there we we've received the baptism the holy ghost why don't why am i not always overcoming brother why why do i have bad days and why do i get upset and why do i doubt and why do i seem sometimes to get really cold it's there's no problem with the word there's no problem with the seed but it says the conscience covers it up and then it can't grow he says it will be a deformed word it's a deformed expression because he says the word will produce just exactly but if something comes in and gets in the way of the seed being expressed it produces a different expression he says it's a deformed word and then he uses this example did you ever see a good grain of corn planted in the ground and let a stick fall over it it'll grow crooked nothing wrong with wrong with the ground nothing even wrong with the seed something else comes over croc lays across it and it begins to grow crooked anybody anything that grows up will because something has hindered it somebody a hindrance conscience laying over it well that any and then he goes a step further i left this in here so he could see his emphasis well that's what's the matter of our pentecostal faith today we let too many things hinder it the faith that we've been taught the holy spirit that's been living in us we've let too many things looking at somebody else and the devil's always trying to put point you to somebody's failure but he tries to keep you away from the real testimony that's genuine what does it do when that happens it hinders the expression of the word that's inside of you you get some complex you begin to think about something the wrong way oh i don't want to do that this is what this person did well i don't want to believe that this is where they went and there's something that can hinder you from just letting your faith loose to accept all of the word of god in this day and walk in his promises of the hour and he says this is the same thing that's happened in the pentecostal faith he says even this holy spirit that's been living in us there's been a stick or something lay over it and now it's growing crooked because something is uh intercepted in its growth covered over it with conscience and it can't grow it's a deformed word can you see the visual picture that he's painting in this and the way he's saying the word is in you and that word is perfect and it's living inside of you but as you grow something just lays over in your life a branch falls down an event happens something takes place satan starts pointing you to somebody who's failed or somebody's abused you or somebody is a hypocrite something happens and in doing so it gets you crooked and it gets you you're not growing straight anymore it says because something's hindered it that's no that's no judgment oh look at that that's not an ear corn corn doesn't grow that way no that's corn something's just deformed it's growth i i think there's a lot of liberation in seeing these things correctly now in the in the sermon we would see jesus and i was caught by how many of these statements all were within a year period all the ones the things i'd find not just related to this deformative growth but even in some of these other statements i've been reading where brother brown says you're a different personality and and some of these other places that we've been reading from they all were just right up before the seals were opened and it stood out to me just personally to see how that that spirit of man in it in that dispensation just wrapping up these things related to the natural part because that capstone was coming that eagle anointing was going to begin to fly under the open of the seals so he says when we would see jesus there's only one creator that's god satan perverts what god has created there's only one other place that i drink water from something bigger and that's at brother paul's church a mug he says but as as but as long as you have faith in the creator in him god brings it back to its right place so satan is in the business of perverting and that genuine life that's on the inside of you he knows he can't take that life even if you've been born again he can't take that life but he'll try to do everything he can to pervert it or cast aspersions on it he says what if there was a stalk of corn growing and a chunk was laying on it it'd grow crooked that's the point we're trying to want you to see a stalk of corn this grain of wheat something that has life in it but something lays over the top of it it doesn't dispute or negate the life but it's going to change the way it grows it would grow crooked pick up move every obstacle that's hindering that and the sun that's sticking it upwards up and the sun that it's sticking up towards it'll finally grow that stalk of corn right out straight again i think there's different plants that you can you can tell where it gets its sunlight based upon the way that it's growing because it's going to grow to the light and ways that plants can even be uh their growth can be addressed by bolstering it and supporting it to get into to grow in its natural pattern and there's ways i guess they can they can uh they can grow square watermelon right and they can do all sorts of things to deform the life of those fruits and the lives of those vegetables by restricting its growth and putting parameters around it so it's going to grow where it can and if there's forces working against it say well i may not be able to grow in what i naturally would be but i'm going to grow and it boxes me in and it casts me in and i grow in the shape of the pressures that are all around me and saying if you could just get move every obstacle that's hindering it the sun that's shining on it the stalk of corn will grow straight again right to the sun so it's a matter of one orienting ourselves in the light of god's word and removing all these things that kind of cast us in in boxes in and want to make us cookie cutter message believers where we all try to conform to a particular view in a church or a way people dress the way people act and people do things and everyone just kind of tries to create this persona built around a personality that there's one personality we're striving to become and that's christ it's the word and we want god to take who we are in our individual peculiarities and our different callings and gifts and and we want to be free to be what he has called us to be as individuals we're not all called to do the same thing we don't all enjoy the same types of foods and recreations we don't all come from the same kind of background so there's a way that this word has got to be expressed in our callings in our lives in our cultures in our regions and whatever it is we are we want the word to take that and express itself through it without any hindrances he says cast out an evil spirit then people say well wasn't nothing nothing happened to me he says you go right back straight if you believe that and know that something happened to you there's nothing to keep you from straightening right back again you just hold on to it so if a spirit is cast out then you've got to stay in the light you got to remain under the influence you got you got then you'll go back straight may not feel like anything's happened but it's just the nature of this life that if encumbrances could be removed hindrances could be removed if anything that's boxing you in or any is cast aside then you can you can grow up straight another statement and the message influence as i said to little joseph i said little boy is born in this world he stands right in the middle of the road and he's pointed to calvary to christ there's a tree on either side of the road on the left side which i'd call wrong i'd catch just catch this visually in your mind a boy's a any child is born and he stands in the middle of the road and he's pointed to christ he's pointed to calvary there's a tree on either side of the road on the left side which i'll call the wrong if he just starts smacking little boys in the face because they smacked him i wonder why he was having this conversation with little joseph if he just starts smacking little boys in the face because they smacked him and if they start doing these things it pulls that boy with the influence and makes him crooked this is what happens in life this is what happens to kids they get around their own kind of influence they have their own kind of experiences in their life and they get beat up or they get bullied something happens and so they start fighting back and it begins to develop a certain character inside them a certain kind of nature and it's molded by these experiences and maybe they were vulnerable to something and now these life experiences are triggering something and brother bram says these influence influences make him crooked could have been born from this any child could be born in a family that's uh got certain tendencies to lie or to cheat or distill or some really bad characters in it but it often times takes something to push him in that direction and he says these other influences in life he's born right in the middle of the road he's pointed to calvary but something comes along and starts pushing him to the wrong side it makes him crooked he says but if he takes this other side of the road which is the holy spirit on the one side is the wrong on the other side is the holy spirit which points him straight to calvary and keeps him in that way it makes you grow straight your thoughts and this is a powerful thought this could be kids eat free right here it's just as easy to think good thoughts as it is to think bad i'll just accept that i'll just accept that it's just as easy to think good as it is to think bad just as easy to think good of those who speak evil of you as it is vice versa what a challenge is we heard it on uh sunday night on let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth and how are we even challenged with the example that brother brought him in a church setting where people were doing vulgar things and it seems that he would have had the right he would even say say what you want and would have the right to speak something but he restrained himself and spoke something that built up and something that preserved or something that did not uh something that honored god and god was pleased with he said it's just as easy to think good thoughts as it is bad thoughts it's just as easy to speak good or to think good of those who speak up evil of you as it is to think evil of people who think evil of you or speak evil of you if it's easy for you to think negative it's easy for you to take the negative side there could be influences in your life that have pushed you into that way and so you're beginning to think crooked but on the other side is the holy spirit that's pointing you straight to calvary and trying to tell you look change the way that you're thinking change the way that you're responding he says and a lot better it makes you grow straight stay straight with god can you see now i hope that it's becoming clear when i'm what i'm pondering in this thought of what a character disorder would be and how that there's a there's there's a life inside of us i will say you must be born again and those of you who have been born again there's a life inside of you that's longing to be expressed holy without blame is he says blameless preserved blameless now and i'm just going to share this in closing i had initially my my initial focus when i began to study this i've been it's been some months now when i started looking into these things and just waiting on the lord how he might desire to share it just because the lord will just impress it according to your needs it's according to your prayers if any of you think that you're going to come to church and hear what brother aaron wants to preach you're missing it you're missing it i don't even want to preach what i want to preach i i want i labor to know what would touch the heart of god and move his people i i just want i want to be in the channel to where i'm saying the things that you need to hear not the things that i enjoy studying and so as we were waiting on that as i began to study i it was initially very uh plain to me the the the natural types the spiritual and that there's a there's natural things that science looks at and the dsm looks at and these 157 different personality disorders and these different clusters and how you could kind of pick apart some of these and begin to find things in a spiritual sense and the fruits of the spirit and the way that paul would admonish us to act towards one another and to live decently and honestly you begin to look and say well these things may come to a point in the natural that cause someone to no longer behave normally in society in relation to certain events and relationship to other people to where there's actual diagnosis and treatment for these conditions but then on the other hand there's also things that we can do in a spiritual sense or that's related to our spiritual character and the way that we treat one another the way that we believe the word of god the way that we apply the word of god and it's all in a spiritual sense and initially that was kind of how i was seen you got this one side over here but let's look at the spiritual side in the real development of our character but over the last few months as i've studied this what i have recognized is has become so real to me as there has been a a blending of the natural and spiritual to where it is more it's a blending it's more pronounced i think than it could have ever been before that there would have been well if i could say it this way it kind of just pops in my head this way there was a time when the crazies stood out more right let's just be honest i'm not talking about in church i remember one time there was somebody who visited a church i was going to as a young kid and uh he was just some transient who believed the message and the church put him up in a hotel and the hotel called and said you got a problem he keeps clogging the toilet and he was taking the bible and ripping the pages out of the bible and sowing it back into the earth by flushing flushing the toilet and so yeah those those guys there's just some crazies out there but i just mean in the world there was a time when there was maybe just a real strict difference between people who kind of had their heads screwed on straight and those who didn't but i think even now more than ever things natural and things spiritual are blending and if i could say it uh i'll say this first that you cannot address a character disorder without addressing personality disorders in other words there's such a blending now that if you want if you're wanting someone to display the right character of christ you're more likely addressing something in the person's natural spirit you're most likely addressing maybe some trauma in their past maybe some thought process maybe something that actually needs healing you cannot then address perfect character without addressing the healing of the heart talking about perfect character but then there has to be a healing of the mind the healing of the heart and there's a direct connection between our spiritual growth and our natural state and and we are living in a time when there is a blending of time and eternity at no other age at this juncture where we could say there was a time in the beginning of mankind begin to walk out of eternity into time but we are living in a time now where mankind the bride is walking out of time into eternity and so there's a tremendous blending and god by his word is achieving a harmony between a heavenly groom and an earthly bride god is by his word achieving this harmony here we are we're earthbound right now we're born by first nature of natural parents we're living on earth we're breathing oxygen we have this natural experience this natural life but god by his word is bringing a harmony between an earthly bride in a heavenly bright groom and they're walking lockstep they're coming into this union brother abraham says in an invisible union oh that spiritual union of christ and his church now when the flesh is becoming word and the word is becoming flesh manifested vindicated that's the time we're living in we're living in a time when the flesh is becoming word not necessarily the word becoming flesh but now that which was flesh becoming word as the second adam the last adam is a spiritual heavenly being who is made flesh and walked amongst us and it was the word made flesh now the flesh is being made word he says it that way and i believe there's something to it when the flesh is becoming word and the word is becoming flesh manifested and vindicated that's the time that we're living in so there is a spiritual capitalist spiritual that is uniting with the natural there's a union taking place and i would certainly say that's in a positive sense but if it's happening in a positive sense since it's also happening in a negative sense and the sense that there's some deterioration whatever harmony exists between god christ and his bride there's this further uh deterioration of mankind and the message what house will you build me he's praying he says dear god as we stand here on this platform which represents right over the altar here we realize that we are a dying race of people as far as this earth is concerned we looked out we look out upon the streets and see sin wrote everywhere and the glory of the lord is swiftly departing and we know when the glory of the lord goes up so will the church go with it so the glory of the lord is swiftly departing there's a diminishing if i say there's a diminishing to that glory if it seems maybe a bit odd think of how less christian virtue is lifted up even within quote unquote christianity think of what how america would have been characterized a hundred years ago and what would have been her backbone and what would have been her plea and what would have been the uh uh even the the character of politicians and what you would expect from a person sometimes they go back and they wrestle with the writings of our founding fathers because they don't quote the bible this way or they're not always saying god this and god that well it was because it was assumed it was assumed in their language and in their discourse and their confidence in one another that they were god-fearing bible-believing and if they weren't they let you know and you could find it readily in some people's writings what kind of differences they had or viewpoints they had but where it may be remained un unmentioned it was assumed in their speech that the that the bible was god's word the son of god there was a there's a certain way of looking at these things and examining these things uh that was from the heart of people that were sincere with the word of god we're not there anymore we're not aware of their churches that maybe brother branham would say oh there's believers in every church and there's the holy spirit in this denomination and that denomination we have all these people that are trying to come together that god's trying to bring together we're not living in that same time we live in a time when god had said those churches are bankrupt of life they're sterile they're dead and so the glory of god is consolidating it's limited it's not as pervasive as it was the glory of the lord is swiftly departing why it's being consolidated in the very small elect group called the bride and when she goes the glory of god goes with her amen brother braham says the very next month in communion he says and we can also look around and see that that that the way that the human mind is leaving the people he says we can't stay too much longer we'd be in a complete insane institution the whole world will be so we're at the end time the human mind is leaving the people this is not this is not just isolated individuals this is this is society at large we could look at it again in revelations chapter three and you could just go there and read it again read it as a diagnosis of people thinking one thing but the reality being another it's an insanity there there is a madness that is settling upon the people and he says we're if we stay too much longer it would be a complete insane institution institution the world would be but what happens when everyone goes crazy they all think they're in the right mind well we're all thinking this and we're all thinking that and we're all thinking this and everyone just kind of accepts and goes along with it and it doesn't mean they're any closer to truth they just have a consensus of crazy but the bible says let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus what i was studying today was on different places in scripture that talked about a man not being in his right mind and how that we are given a sound mind let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus this is a sound mind this is a sane mind there is a there's a mind that is birthed inside of us and think it says let this mind be in you isn't it interesting uh a phrase to where it's something you're permitting something you're allowing let this mind be in you let it have preeminence think on these things and order your life according to give it place let this mind be in you it doesn't make us double minded it's setting this mind the one that we receive by natural birth that has memories and imagination conscience reason and affection to let it become subject to the mind of christ that if there's anything contrary to the word of god we acknowledge it that's contrary to the word of god any memory any imagination whatever it might be that's conscious of the word of god we acknowledge that's contrary to the word of god and we let the mind of christ have preeminence brother brahman says in the message identification we are invited by god to make him as an example and let our character be molded like his. he says what a thing my i say amen what a thing we are invited to let our character be molded like his to let our character be molded into his glorious character then when we let his character be in us then we become sons by having the mind of christ mind which is his character your mind makes your character let the mind paul said of christ let this mind that was in christ being you let that mind of christ be in you it molds the character of the son of god if you could have the right kind of mindset if you could have a clear mind you got a free unencumbered mind if you could get if it's not covered up with all these other senses and conscience and things then that mind molds the character of a son of god it's got to be free it's got to be unencumbered it can't have some chunk laying over the top of it some stick or branch laying over the top of it let this mind be free let it be let this mind be in you don't don't uh don't prod it don't poke it don't hinder it don't restrict it don't reason with it let this mind let it alone let it be it's what it is let this mind be let it be in you let it be free let it be unencumbered let it be unrestrained don't box it in we talk about putting god in a box putting god in a box well we're putting the mind of christ in a box sometimes but it's that mind of christ if we can just let it be it'll mold the character not moldy character it'll mold the character of the son of god brother brahm said our character is molded in there by the life that is in us so there's a life in you that wants to mold your character so there's a there's a just in the natural this is where natural types of spiritual you're born a natural man and then the life you live mould your character therefore there's also in the spiritual by the new birth there's a life in there that wants a molder character my closing statement's a lengthy one but i want to read this in closing in the messiah brother and says man in his natural condition the way we are now you can see that he's much more than an animal as we try to say we are because man in his fallen estate yet being a fallen son of god he can still better himself he has an intelligence he builds himself a better house living conditions he makes himself better travel conditions he can speed himself through the air now at 1900 miles an hour what is it actually we can fly captain how many miles an hour are you flying not that fast so they still haven't quite gotten there yet he can speed himself through the air at 1900 miles an hour in a jet plane a rocket he's made himself so he can almost travel around the world just in 24 hours i think that's pretty close right he's smart intelligent he's made up in the image in the likeness of god and in him is light now for instance when a man gets saved the light that comes into him is about like this little white button on my shirt my man gets saved that when he when a man's born again a little white button like a button on my shirt that's when god comes into the inner part of a man and a man is made up in a system of tabernacles in the outer courts then the holy place the holiest of holies the shekinah glory on the inside the veil walking us through the the elements of the temple is now in the elements of the man the body spirit and soul it's in that soul in that holy of holies he says the holiest of holies with a shekinah glory about the size of a button he says it's just like it comes in and that for the next couple sentences he talks about self-will and the senses of the body and spirit he starts breaking those down but for time's sake i want to skip he says now when a man is converted say just like that little white button starts in his heart now that part is god and when he's born again with the spirit of god god's spirit dwells in him now he can let that spirit grow and take out all the roots of bitterness and press god's way through him again he can become back in the same condition that he was when he was in the garden of eden just start as a button and end up a man just starting as a little button he says but if he can let it grow and take out all the roots of bitterness and whatever else there might be and press god's way through him and again he can become a man in the same condition in an interesting it's going to work in now it's going to work out jesus said in mark 11 24 verily very i say unto you if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart but believe that what you have said will come to pass you can have what you said that puts him right back supreme again it puts him right back in the condition now we're made up of light meters inside of us is cosmic light that cosmic like is a light that they can take an x-ray with the x-ray doesn't come from the x-ray light it comes from your own light now this is the part i really want you to focus on and if that cosmic like say could be pushed to a place to where it's not cosmic light but eternal light i want i want the eternal light to get pushy get pushed to a place where it's eternal light god could dwell supremely to do our thinking do our walking do our talking then it's no longer the man it's god in the man if he's got light life eternal life is the light of god that dwells in the man notice how beautiful the statement is if he yields to the spirit the more he becomes unmanned sinner-like and becomes more godlike that's what we want in our lives to become unmanned sinner-like to become less of a natural man less of an earthly man less of a carnal man less of a sinner-like person and become more god-like that's what the word of god can do in our lives that's what we want to give him full availability to do i believe i i'll say this with all my heart if it takes god moving supernaturally whatever it's going to take to get you to a place to believe that god can begin to do this that's my desire as your pastor whatever it takes for god to supernaturally get your attention that what he's doing in this hour is a perfecting of the whole person for the purpose of a translation and whatever it's going to take to get your attention to say god i'm ready to let you get this eternal light to come into my heart or this eternal life that's in my heart to begin to get pushy with all the cosmic light and all the man-made things and all the memories imagination reasons and affections to let it get pushy to push all of that out so i can become more godlike i whatever it takes for for us to come to that place i said god let it be i and i i mean that if it's got to be there has to be a change of dynamics in our church services there has to be a change in our way of worship if there has to be something that god needs to do and a very outward a supernatural way to get your attention i said god you do what you have to do to get the people's attention but in the final analysis what i want is on a monday morning some unmanned unsinner like people and more godlike people not just living until the next revival not just living until the next outpouring but people that are so impacted by the divine so caught by the vindication of god's promises that they purpose in their heart that they can live above the things of the world and be jesus christ i really desire to see souls saved a desire to see people's lives changed and you're the only you're the only channel you're the only outlet for it it's a life that you live and if there's just this just this much inside of you it can push out all the bitterness just just the size of this little button that's all it is just this little button is all it starts with but you let it push out god bless you let's stand
