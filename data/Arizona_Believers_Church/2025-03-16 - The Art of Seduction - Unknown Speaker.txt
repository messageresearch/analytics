TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Mark Chapter 13 Verse 22 for false Christ and false prophet shall rise and show signs and wonders to seduce if it were possible even the elect and I really think about this in this end time the time that we're living in now false Christ and false prophets they're going to come on the scene and show signs Great Signs and and wonders and works and their purpose and their goal is to seduce if it were possible even the elect amen we just trust God will bless this word you can be seated my title is The Art of Seduction and I know that might be a catchy title my son Elliot told me that it was um clickbaity and I thought that was a good sign from a 17-year-old and then brother Michael told me it looked like Kirkland's signature brand from Costco so uh I'm somewhere between clickbait and uh bulk uh value pricing but on the uh and I think just as brother Michael admitted he's just seduced by good prices but uh The Art of Seduction I want to just use a definition a scriptural definition of Seduction so you can understand where I'm coming from at the outset is to cause to go astray to be seduced specifically means to be led away from truth into error so you have to be enticed or seded seduced away from something real something true into air that's what seduction is or if you're seduced you're caused drawn to go astray from the right path or a correct way or drawn away from truth into air the Lord's been dealing with me on uh maybe the question of what is sin and the examination of sin and really what encompasses sin because I believe that understanding the nature of sin is actually necessary to completely overcome as because we know that we're taught that overcoming is to recognize the devil in all of his tricks and at the same time to recognize that greater is he that is in you that he than he that is in the world the Seducer and he has already overcome him so there is this component if for to overcome we have to have some understanding of what it is we are overcoming and it is the misunderstanding of sin that often leads to a false Pride um and some arrogance because people believe that they're beyond sin and they're above sin and therefore for uh they've relegated sin to a particular definition where they feel safe or for others since they don't know what sin is they live in constant defeat and then never ever walking in the promise of God to be free from sin so if you'll look in your Bibles to Romans chapter 6 verse 23 the Bible says and we're just going to use the scripture today and I have a number of scriptures here I'm not trying to break my personal uh record on the number of scriptures but those who are counting let me know where we're at by the end but in Romans chap 6: 23 it says for the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ Our Lord we're wanting to understand the nature of sin what is sin and the Bible tells us here that the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life and so the consequences of misunderstanding sin is not ah I got that wrong the consequences of misunderstanding sin is permanent separation from God the wages of sin is death this death is not just a physical death though because of sin there is physical death but it's actually a second death it's permanent separation and here Paul has taken sin's wages and he's contrasted it by God's gift and I think this is an important place to start because sin is only understood in contrast to God and we can really only understand what sin is in relationship to God what that sin then only exists because God has a particular value or God has a particular nature and character in sin is contrary to that so in writing the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life that's putting this contrast between God's gift and the Wage of Sin now if you look at Psalms 51:5 I want us to see for a moment we're just going to run through a number of scriptures here that uh substantiating this and all of this should be very familiar to us because we this sinful condition is real we are all born in a sinful condition and if we misconstrue what sin is it would lead us into uh or we could cause this confusion about our sinful State well sin is this this is what remedies it this is what it is if we don't have the right understanding of what sin is then there's going to be confusion about what we're born in in Psalm 51:5 David says behold I was shapen in iniquity and in sin did my mother cons me I will say now if you have your Bibles today we're just going to be providing the reference and maybe some key words underneath that reference so if you want to turn in the scripture to read the full thing the full scripture just feel free to use your Bibles behold I was shapen in iniquity and in sin did my mother conceived me there was this native sinfulness by being born by the fact that he was born he was born of the original sin and being born of the original sin there's this native sinfulness sin was in him and he's saying he was in sin when we read this here in Psalm 51 he had known that he had uh done wrong and that sin was in him he was shaped in iniquity and and conceived in sin Isaiah 64:6 says but we are all as an unclean thing and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags and we all do Fade as a leaf and our iniquities like the wind have taken us away a man born of a woman is of a few days and full of trouble he's conceived in sin he's shaped by iniquity he's unclean his iniquities drive him as Romans 7:5 says for when we were in the flesh the Motions of sins which were by the law did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death the Bible is telling us that we are naturally inclined to sin that it's not in our first nature uh uh to be righteous that we do not even have the power of righteousness working within us in Jeremiah chapter 13 or Romans chapter well that was the Motions of sins that that desire that movement that activity of sin is already working in us we're inclined to sin Jeremiah 13:23 says can the Ethiopian change his skin or the leopard his spots those are rhetorical questions say no we can't do it then may ye also do good that are accustomed to do evil it's in you sin is in you you are born in sin you're are shaped in sin you are you come into the world with a sinful nature you're inclined to do this as Paul says in Romans 7:18 for I know that in me that is my flesh dwelleth no good thing for to will is present with me but how to perform that which is good I find not this is a consistent theme throughout scripture and you start you might be getting nervous right now knowing just how many scriptures could fit here and you're like just how long is this part of the sermon going to be well we got a few more to go but scripture after scripture details how by a natural birth being born of a man and a woman we come into the world with a fallen nature that is inclined to sin just part part of our part of our makeup as it were there's no good thing in Us by this natural birth in Psalm 58:3 the wicked are estranged from the womb they go astray as soon as there be they be born speaking lies and we might want to think that that's true of the wicked but it's true of all of us that we are not born into relationship with God by our first birth we do not have this Clear Channel to heaven we are not indued with all wisdom and understanding and and righteousness and as soon as we're born we are LED as straight just by Nature just by Nature inside of us this motions of sin are already working having been conceived in sin then shaped in iniquity we come forth with the Motions of sin already working within us and therefore that's how we are inclined to speak lies I think it's often said and pointed out that you don't have to teach a child how to lie there's this Instinct that's kind of it's inate within them for self-preservation and for certain reasons to not necessarily speak truth as the Bible says in Romans 3:23 for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God all all have sinned that puts us all in the same category Ecclesiastes 7:20 for there is not a just man upon Earth that doeth good and sinth not I love how it just Nails it down none of us can take inventory of our lives and say I was born of a good man I was born of a good woman I've lived a good life uh I heard a minister say one time and it was shameful that it was a message Minister it was overseas so you don't have to get nervous about how close they lived to us but they said that they were born in the message they were taught the message the open Word was preached to them and they said what do I have to repent of what is it that I need to make right and I was kind of thinking man this guy's getting ready to really get him and that was his point and I was like well that's really interesting uh so it's a really unique theology but uh there's some verses that would Enlighten us to say it doesn't matter if you were born in the message and under word teaching and everything was just laid out just perfectly right you were born in sin and there's not a man upon Earth who has only been born once that can say he does good and doesn't sin 1 John 18 now realize in using this scripture there's some paradoxes in first John but we'll maybe explore them uh later at another time if we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us if we say that we have no sin we are deceived and we're deceiving ourselves can't put the blame on the devil it's one of these unique things as I begin to look at the scripture that ultimately there's some accountability that we all have to take where we're not just blaming the devil for our condition though there is some shared responsibility as we go back to the beginning but we have it in us if if we're just going to play the blame game then right we're just going to go all the way back to the beginning and all of us are absolved but we have to take accountability I was born this way this is in me I have to take responsibility for this if we say that we have no sin we cannot have the truth in us and we deceive ourselves as Ephesians chapter 2 puts it and you hath the quickened and says who were dead in trespasses and sins so we can all be described as being dead in sin these transgressions these trespass having been born of a woman just born in a human condition born of the original sin there's this native sinfulness that's inside of us and so we are considered dead in sins and the condition that we come forth in in Romans chapter 8:7 is that because the carnal mind is enity against God for it is not subject to the law of God neither indeed can be that's first nature first birth we are and I know I'm maybe drawn heavily on our uh our already well established understanding of what the original sin is or was but this result of that original sin is all have come in this hybrid nature Fallen nature with the carnal mind as we want to say that's evolved and uh uh been uh through genetics and the world history and the forming of our cultures and Society we we arrive at a time when we can absolutely say the mind is against the things of God God naturally we're not naturally inclined to spiritual things the Bible says in Romans chapter 5:12 wherefore as by one man sin entered into the world is placing this responsibility upon Adam and death by sin so there's our real key that death is the result of sin so if you misunderstand what sin is and you say well sin is something if you believe that sin was something that it's not then you're not actually going to have the right understanding of what death is or be fully aware of what can cause death we have to understand what sin is and if it if it feels like man brother eron's going down this path today where sin must be something very Elusive and mysterious no I think it's just going to be something very simple that you already know and is very clear to us but I believe it's important to establish by scripture what sin is so that we can properly overcome completely and overcome everything in the time and hour that we're living in now death entered by sin and so death passed upon all men why for that all have sinned notice how it's by one man that it enters but then we are all sinners and we all have sinned therefore sin has passed on all men now I want to take this sinful condition that we've looked at and I say that's our current state we currently live in with this native sinfulness this is how we're all born and I'm not speaking to your nature as born again but Humanity is born in sin I want to take our original condition or take our sinful current condition and contrast it by the original condition and just take this for a few moments and look at how we recognize through a number of scriptures and maybe eight or nine however it was that born in sin all have sinned that there is by natural process by sexual birth we come forth with the DNA of our parents and we have the nature of our ancestors and then we have the nurture of those that rear us and we have the environment that we're raised in and all of this is not inclined upward but it declines downward but in the beginning there was this original condition of man that was completely perfect we looked at the scripture a number of times as of late in Genesis 2:25 it says of Adam and the woman and they were both naked the man and his wife and were not ashamed it's a poetic language to describe them in a perfect condition there was no sin there was no evil there was no fear there was no perversion only innocence there was nothing in their makeup or their character or their existence that was stained or marked by sin nothing in their existence at all there wasn't anything that they would walk by and blush to as a matter of fact there was no blush they were they were pure they were innocent everything was holy the Bible says in Genesis 1: 31 and God saw everything that he had made and behold it was very good this is is uh this speaks to the sinlessness of creation God the only thing that he remarked was not good was not sinful but rather it was that man had a further purpose and there was a further reflection of God but at this point at which he says I will make uh man in my image and there was going to be a woman that would come forth and she would be this companion to man God looks at all creation he says this is very good this is this is how uh this is perect per everything is sinless but then the great turn is in Genesis chter 3 we find this moment where God says in verse 13 the Lord God said unto the woman what is this that thou Hast done so now the sinless condition has been breached something's changed and God is asking what have you done something has been done and the woman gives a very insight ful accurate I would even say descriptive response the woman said in her honesty the serpent beguiled me and I did eat she could have said I ate she could have said I ate of the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil I could have done this she could have just jumped to the end and answered it very specifically what I have done is I have eaten but she says the serpent beguiled me she was led astray means to lead astray or to deceive the word means is seduce the serpent seduced me and I did eat now to the subject of the original sin it would seem really really odd for her to use such aggravating language to say that she was morally seduced into eating of fruit oh well that was the forbidden fruit you got to think uh you it's important even to think in terms of what we're using as far as human language today to describe something and if it was merely uh uh Disobedience to eat this forbidden uh broccoli or whatever we might want to say that it was or it could have been a a kiwi it could have been an avocado could have been a tomato if we're going with fruit but there's something that said this is what I was told not to eat and I ate it seduction isn't the word that we would use but this was a moral deceiving she was led astray morally and she was seduced to sin now if we can look at the beginning of the chapter I want to take the origin of original sin and essentially in doing this this examination uncovers how Satan uses seduction and what his seduction is to cause sin now God asked the woman what have you done now what she did is this overt act it's something in her actions but we realize there's more that takes place before she ate because her answer discloses that she doesn't just say what I did was eat she says I was first seduced and having been first seduced I acted and it's important to recognize that what she had done is she had sinned first by being seduced and then the ACT followed without the seduction there is no eating so are we on the kind of the same page as we build to this as we've established that we're all born in a sinful condition and we took a quick glance at how there was originally a sinless condition now we see the woman having been seduced into a sin sin ful condition and it begins with Genesis 3:1 now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field he was skillful this is where I get the the the term art the skill of Seduction he was crafty he was subtle he was skilled in a particular manner he was more subtle than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made and he said unto the woman some look at this scripture and say that this would have been a supernatural uh feat it would have been something that would have caught the woman off guard but we understand that the serpent was a beast that could talk there was one that talking would not have been uncommon for him to have said something or there to be some communication between he and Adam would not have been foreign this isn't akin to uh Bam's donkey speaking to him and getting his attention and should have known at the very moment that the serpent is now speaking that something is happening to be on guard he was crafty he was subtle and he used this shrewdness to Satan or Satan used his shrewdness to Satan's own Advantage so catch this he is very crafty he's very subtle he's Artful and he said unto the woman ye hath God said ye shall not eat of every tree in the garden this seems to be a reasonable question but notice this supposition this question is with intent he he he he's not gardening that day and said I'm trying to get your uh I'm I'm your instacart today I'm your personal shopper I want to know what I can gather and Forge for for you this afternoon for dinner he's asking this question probing and it's for a reason and I want you to look at it this way so I provided it to you with this way the serpent speaks and that's one thing that we can see serpent speaks and it's not just the serpent speaking but it's who he speaks to the serpent speaks to the woman doesn't say it to the man he says it to the woman this is not necessarily in the presence of Adam he's not addressing them together but there has been some effort to single her out and to address her so the serpent speaks then the serpent is speaking to the woman and the serpent speaks to the woman what God spoke now this is to me an important thing that he doesn't just come right out and say hey hey woman you're looking good today but he begins with this question of God has not God spoke to you already and he's saying if I could say what the tapes already said but what does here if we could look at this is he said un the woman ye yeah hath God said If you're looking at your scripture you'll see that he uses the term God this is Elohim and in saying yeath God said he's using an impersonal term of God though this is the Transcendent Elohim he is beyond he is superior he uses the word God who God in the beginning created so he's using a term for God Elohim but there's something elusive to that term this is the great one this is the superior one yeah hath not Elohim said that you shall not eat of every tree of the garden but the nature of God had changed once creation had been fully brought forth as it says in Genesis CH 2 ver verse4 these are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created in the day that the Lord God made the Heaven and the earth the earth and the heavens this is not merely God or Elohim but the this is lord god Jehovah Elohim Yahweh and this term that is used expresses this Covenant God in relationship to his creation uh anyone could say that there's an Elohim in the sense that they recognize uh there is one greater they could use it even in the sense that there's one Beyond us and there's one greater I believe even Elohim is used in the scripture to refer to uh Gods of the people or what people that they supposed to be Gods but to say Yahweh or Jehovah this is the Unspeakable to say Jehovah God takes God out of this realm of just merely Elohim and he brings them in relationship to the creation and Satan and I'm not trying to get bogged down in semantics here but he asked the question uh did God say you can't eat and what did God say about what you can't eat in the tree of the garden and since we know the rest of the story we're not just all suspicious we know what happened we can recognize that even in the way that he's talking he cleverly creates this separation between God and the woman by just referring to him as Elohim or God he kind he's able to already get her thinking in God as something dist of God as something distant and it shows up in the way that she answers the question because in answering the question she refers to him merely as Elohim and when you think about it this is the first conversation about God first time that we see God is being spoken of and when it starts and it's not that there hadn't been prior conversations about the Lord and not that Adam and the woman would not have discussed him and fellowship with him but this first recording of a conversation the serpent is speaking to the woman what Elohim had said and in doing so in this first conversation we read about God they've objectified God in other words they've just made them an object they're not speaking to God or with God he's speaking of him in third person and as I thought about it last week I like is this he as if he wouldn't even know what they're saying as if he wasn't present he got the woman to immediately and this is how the Lord's dealt with my heart that there was a way that he caught her attention to where when she answered it wasn't like well he's right here why don't you just ask him there was it was almost as if he was able to create a a distance between her and God to get her so singly focused in on one question that God became distant listen we we we could just be honest if you really felt the presence of God and if in the moment you weren't deceived into thinking that he's some far off and he doesn't see what you do we will do anything when we're unconscious of God and so they're not speaking to God not speaking about God they're using him in the third person and really what this would be is I would say this in the most negative term it was just mere theology they were just merely talking about God it was a study of God without any inference of intimacy or relationship with God it wasn't Yahweh it was God and in doing so objectified God who would have maybe a list of rules so what did this great Supreme Being say you can't do was it he said you're not supposed to do and there was no relationship indicated by the language that being used and even an effort by the devil to separate the woman from her intimacy and her relationship to God an example of this I think would be a very good example to see is in Matthew chapter 26: 69 to 70 I want to go to 75 it says now Peter sat without in the palace and we recognize this at the time when Jesus is being tried Jesus is already prophesied Peter the won Crow uh till you've denied me three times and as he sat in the Palace of damsel came unto him and saying thou also was with Jesus of Galilee so there's no confusion as to who he's being associated with so he can't be clever and and think he was referred to somebody else he says and he denied before them all saying I know not what thou sayest so maybe that's a little bit more clever his lawyer told him answer Ambiguously I don't understand I don't know if I've told you this before but my dad one time was work working on a military base in San Diego and he was there without a he was a young teenager working for my grandpa who had a contract to work on the base and everyone had to have credentials or clearance or licensing to be there and a military the uh military police showed up and asked him if he had any documentation he said no and then the guy just began to speak Spanish perfectly and my dad said and the guy just chuckled and walked away and so Peter might have initially said no and when he was gone out into the porch another maid saw him and said unto them that were there this fellow was also with Jesus of Nazar I love how they're just going to make sure that we know who this guy is and again he denied with an oath right I do not know the man so now he's being a little bit more articulate and after a while came unto him they that stood by and said to Peter surely thou also art one of of them here's how our art series comes into view thou also art one of them for thy speech berth thee it betrays you we know by the way you talk we recognize you you were with him you know Jesus of Galilee it's the same Jesus of Nazareth you have been with him and that with him and he says the Bible says in verse 24 then he began to curse and to swear it's no longer a promise I promise I wasn't now he's cursing and swearing saying I know not the man notice how quickly even in his language he's taken the deity of Christ away he's not Lord he's not master there's no respect being paid anymore I don't know the dude I don't know the guy from I don't know what you mean to I do not know the man to cursing and swearing saying I know not the man and immediately the crew and Peter remembered the words of Jesus which said unto him before the Crow Thou shalt deny me Thrice and he went out and wept bitterly to deny the word means to affirm no relationship ship with it's to deny to deny it means to disavow any connection with to deny is not to say the guy doesn't exist but it's to change your relationship with him to deny he distan himself from Christ and he did it in the moment I could just put it as plainly as we read it he did it because he didn't trust him in this moment in the circumstances when he saw what was transpiring he was no longer proud he was no longer happy to be identified if this had been the very moment where all the Miracles were being performed and all a sudden the soldier showed up he's like it's time to draw my sword buddy and I'm going to stand for you now it looked like the tide had turned and everyone was walking away and everybody had all this evidence and everything was going uh uh working sideways against him it was in this moment of doubt that he began to deny who Jesus Christ was because he didn't trust who he said he was he didn't trust the source of all the Miracles and in that moment he he distanced himself from Christ this is exactly what happened in the garden through the woman's initial response and what the devil was trying to do he wanted to create enough distance some wiggle room a space to work I titled this The Art of Seduction the seduction to cause one to Desert an allegiance to to be seduced you desert your service to something I use the term art because Satan's skill in painting a false picture of God that's what he did in the beginning he painted a picture to Eve and he in painting this picture by conversation he skillfully he artfully cleverly impregnated the woman's mind with the wrong conception of God she entertained a picture of God he painted the picture through his language hey this God this impersonal God has told you what you can't do now you know the reason why is because he's selfish because he's a narcissist because he's because he's trying to hold something back we've used this a number of times even very recently maybe in one of our last Services how that he caused the woman to question God's motive question his character let's look at the the beginning when God gave the Commandment in Genesis 2: 16 and 17 I realized that my my tone may be uh my my volume may be a little high maybe a little strained a lot of emphasis but I realize the matter is really strictly speaking teaching but these are things that are necessary it's necessary for us to slow down and and walk through the scripture with a heart full of Faith to believing that these are the words of God and asking ourselves God today right now where I'm living today I need your word to help me so here's God's original commandment in the beginning are we learning that what Satan did in the beginning uh God is undoing completely in the end God's restoring us back and there's such a critical turn of this revelation of Jesus Christ in this hour to bring us back to the original condition and so in Genesis CH 2: 16- 17 and the Lord God it's not God the Lord God Yahweh yahovah Jehovah Elohim commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat God is commanding Freedom you may freely eat in other words you are free moreal agents to enjoy this Liberty to be fruitful to have dominion and partake of all these things that I've given you this is freedom now I want you to narrow in on this especially as we did several services on modesty and we saw that God does have a standard that God does have a dress code that God has some expectations as to how we might present ourselves externally and it's not just oh it's what's on the inside that matters to the point that God doesn't care how you look at all we recognize scripturally that's error and there there's voices that would want to uh emphasize Liberty and freedom to the extent that you should be allowed to do whatever you want in anything that would inhibit you from pursuing certain things I is controlling we've done our own Deeds to make that so by mishandling the word of God and we have become cultish and we have imposed standards without uh without love it's not speaking the truth as love speaking the truth with love because if you don't have the character of Christ behind it it tends to bind and abuse and bruise and control so Jehovah commanded Freedom you're you're free verse 17 begins with but of the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil Thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that thou eatest thereof Thou shalt surely die God has not immediately given them Liberty to only take it away but their freedom was secured by this restriction he preserved their freedom he says you're free but there's this there has to be this understanding when he says Thou shalt not eat Freedom necessitated a restrictive commandment it's not really Freedom if anything goes right I mean let's just be honest when we tell someone to come we say make yourself at home and you're like wow this is awesome I'm free to make myself at home and then all of a sudden it's like cuz we're going to treat you like family next thing you know we're beating you up and we're calling you names and we're taking your taking what you we're you know rifling through your purse or whatever like and start treating you actually as family what kind of Liberty what we're taking our liberties we're free where the spirit of the Lord is there's liberty to gossip to do whatever we want to justify ourselves right and so there's this way that we can just approach it from the standpoint that liberty liberty liberty but you could not have freedom unless there was some restriction to truly have freedom there must be boundaries to truly have freedom there must be limits it's freedom to operate operate within certain parameters but if there's no restrictions then your freedoms and your Liberties will eventually infringe upon my own that's why it's not just merely uh positive Liberties but positive Liberties require negative Liberties and that's just a nod to our Economist and our uh revolutionary writers and even the writers in in in England who wrestled with these topics and in order to have true Liberty there has to be some restrictive Liberty so only in accepting and honoring God's boundaries was there actual freedom but it's those boundaries that mankind VI violated and when they violated that restrictive Liberty that restrictive commandment that's when they lost their freedom in Romans chapter 7:14 for we know that the law is spiritual but I am carnal sold under sin this is an interesting way to think about it their freedom Adam and the woman their freedom was in a natural ability to not sin that's what Liberty was their freedom was in a natural Liberty to not sin but after the fall through the fall we all lost that freedom we're not free to not sin anymore Paul says I'm I'm in bondage to sin I'm born of a woman and in doing so I am now sold and I'm a servant to sin Liberty is being free now think about the Liberty that God wants to give us with the Liberty to not sin that's the freedom that creation had what was Satan's goal then he could kind of put that out he had a goal he had an objective but by mischaracterizing God what is he able to do he's able to break trust in God which allows this doubt to rise in the woman what he allowed the woman to do is to separate herself from God God and once this impregnation in her mind took place once she was able to he was able to get distance from God and create distance as Elohim and then question his character if you're up if you know somebody if you're up close and you know somebody then there's just a way that you know like I know them I know what they're thinking but if anybody could ever get you to step back from them say oh I just want you to take an objective view of what they've been doing and they get you far enough way to where they want you to begin to examine something in this other light so to speak and you start thinking oh wow I never thought of it that way oh my goodness this is really this is dark you know why they've taken you out of the light they've taken you into the Shadows they're manipulating your perception when you know somebody and you're familiar with somebody you trust somebody you're like oh I know that even if they did that that's not what they were intending to do I know that even if they did that they would make it right but like well on let me show you something take a step back look at this guy he's just a dog just a snake in the grass look at this and his life look at that and they start telling the story and before you know it you're like you know what from here in the shadows this guy looks like a really bad character he caused the woman to take a step back stop for a moment and do it so when she separated herself from God it gave the moment for doubt to arise and the act of the original sin was a deliberate an act of deliberate disassociation from God it was it was an act in that moment she could defy God so the the real the seduction takes place in her mind and then she acts because the dist the space to act has been granted to her now I feel like we're doing we're doing just fine with time but we're we're not going to go much further in this cuz I I know that there's a lot of substance to this a lot of heft and I think it's important for us to be able to ponder it uh afterwards without too much to chew on generally we could say sin can be defined as a violation of God's word some sort of a transgression of God's will generally sin would be a violation by action or omission of God's word 1 John 3:4 said whosoever committeth sin transgresses also the law for sin is the transgression of the law that Greek word that's used here for sin means simply to miss the mark he that misses the mark transgresses for to miss the Mark is the transgression of the law Noti this is what is required if you don't meet the requirements that's sin it's a rebellion or rejection of God's commandment it's a rejection of Truth you miss the mark sin in the New Testament the word is to miss the mark Genesis 3:1 going back to this original sin and he said who told thee that thou was naked Adam having already clothed himself still felt nakedness because he wasn't clothed in the manner that God chose to clothe him still FS nakedness and God says well who told you you were naked and God immediately Associates it with the ACT have you eaten of the tree that I commanded you not to eat of the the naked winess was only felt this this uh exposure this perversion this loss of innocence was only felt because he violated God's commandment so the eating was the fruit of a blatant disregard for God's commandment for the word I commanded you that's my word you transgressed that that's sin 1 Samuel chapter 15: 22- 24 and Samuel said hath the Lord as great delight and burnt off offerings and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of the Lord in studying Saul last year when we went through it in great detail it's become more and more apparent to me the spirit of Saul is still alive and well today that instead of repenting what people want is uh pretense I don't know if you can respell repentance to s spell pretense you can misspell pretense with the same letters of repentance I like I think you your scrabble's not real your Scrabble game is not real strong here I think what you mean instead of this pretense is repentance and instead of saying they're sorry they just want to go to lunch with you right and go to lunch and you you go you're like thinking who did he go to lunch with who do you go to lunch with I thank God that I have not gone to lunch with any of you I baptized none of you except brother Edward there's this idea where it's just like let's just pretend nothing ever happened so it looked look s like everything's cool come let's let's Fellowship together let's offer sacri this is what he did with Samuel he said Samuel why don't you come preach for me so that everybody can see I'm still the legit King I'm Still A Guy I'm still in the circle everything's okay because since you're preaching for me since you're worshiping together with me everything's fine and all the bad things I did must be okay that's why it's only a false prophet that would have fallen for the invitation of the pretense that everything's cool this this example in this Cara character study of Saul is very important for us to not fall to the same things to where if you need to make something right on it and say I'm sorry for what I did make it right with the people you need to make it right with and not try to Garner some sort of uh uh clout by the way that you interact socially to say Well they're following me back see they follow that's how we know when something's gone wrong is when somebody unfollows somebody like oo so and so is in trouble so and so sto following them and then as soon as they fall in the back everything's okay no need no need for repentance no need for owning it no need for apologizing to people that have been hurt by it it's just let's just restore the status quo so that everything looks good I feel like I want to preach on Saul right now Sam that's the spirit Samuel's deal dealing with you think God loves your sacrifices of praise and your offerings of this and everything and not obeying the word behold to obey is better than sacrifice you living according to the word of God is better than you shouting his name you honoring the word of God by doing what the messenger taught us to do is far better than shouting and praising and dancing for Rebellion is as the sin behold to obey is better than sacrifice and to hearken than the fat for Rebellion is as the sin of Witchcraft and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry this is the part I really wanted to get to because thou Hast rejected the word of the Lord he hath also rejected thee from being King and Saul said unto the Samuel I have sinned really this false humility but humility but he's right I've transgressed the Commandment of the Lord and thy words then because I feared the people and OB oby their voice so humble Saul is but sin is to reject the word of God the Hebrew word here is that Catal in the sense of it same as in the Hebrew or the Greek missing the target to deviate from the right way to miss the goal I missed the mark you said to do this I Didn't Do It sin is rebellion it's Defiance against God sin is is not necessary in relationship to you and I because we could do things one to another and that may offend you and you might do something that offends me and we could work that out between ourselves and it's offense we could say it's a sin and it's to miss the Mark it's a transgression or it's an offense but here sin specifically is in relationship to God the words that are used of sin or trespass or Rebellion a pesot to revolt a transgression something that's twisted or crooked these are Avon and pesha these are words that describe the harara these words describe sin it's missing the mark but it's against God God's Mark I can't create some arbitrary standard and say well if you didn't wear blue suede shoes today you've sinned and everybody's like what do you mean we don't even know where to get Blue Suede Shoes anymore and and that but that's not what sin would be sin is to miss the mark its Defiance against God in Genesis 399 Joseph is being seduced the attempt to seduce there's none greater in this house and I speaking of potier neither hath he kept anything back from me but thee because Thou Art his wife and Joseph doesn't rationalize to say I don't want to do this to him but he says how then can I do this great wickedness and sin against God he knew that this would be a sin against God that's what sin is wickedness is sin against God David and his repentance as we already read verse 5 51 Psalm 51:4 against thee thee only have I sinned there may be offenses and there may be hurts but when it comes to atonement when it comes to sin when it comes to transgression the sin that we're talking about I only against you have I done this evil in thy sight against thee and the only have I sinned when we act in Rebellion against God's word we sin against God not that others can't be hurt and not that we wouldn't owe others an apology but we must recognize that our sin is against God sins of action just as the woman was seduced and then acted these are ways in which we are caused to act in a way that rejects the word of God James chapter 4:1 17 puts it even in a different category therefore to him that knoweth to do good and doeth it not to him it is sin often we quote this scripture saying iniquity but it's to him it is sin what does it show a lack of respect to know to do good and not do it to know to do righteousness to know to do well is that not what God Said to Cain in the beginning if thou doest well you'll be accepted but if not sin right if you don't act sin lies at the door what is this sin the refusal to do good to know to do good and not do it is sin at at the very least it's an attitude of indifference doesn't matter some sort of apathy or as the Bible puts it in Revelations 3:15 and 16 lukewarmness because Thou Art lukewarm neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth I'm hoping to in the next couple Services uh uh expose the make believer as it were because and again I never desired to preach to the make believer but it's important for us to recognize that the make believer and I'm giv the whole sermon away so maybe this is it right here got five seconds the make believer is the unbeliever with makeup on does that work should we just break that out put part 18 or whatever it is on a 5 Second let's do a YouTube short there it is and we could do one on shorts because Thou Art lukewarm I'll spew thee out of my mouth to know to do good and not do it that is sin through acts of commission or Omission we can do something that is born of sin now this is my this is my conclusion sin at its roots you want to say what is Sin Sin at its roots root is unbelief what is sin sin is UN belief correct now I believe that scripturally it's obvious I believe as message Believers it's very familiar to know what sin is we would all say sin is unbelief and these things of adultery and fornication and smoking and drinking all those are attributes of sin but do you realize the devil hates the idea that sin would be exposed as and its NE in its naked form is just merely unbelief it's actually uh an assailed truth something that should be established in our faith and in our in our convictions in this end time that to sin is to disbelieve sin at its root is a miscar isation or Corruption of our faith in God and his character if faith is a deliberate confidence in the character of God when you don't understand it and you're not sure what the outcome would be if faith is some sort of trust and Fidelity to God who whose ways you don't always understand then sin would be a mistrust in that God Amen a Corruption of our Fidelity and our faith in God 1 John 5: 16-1 17 If any man see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death wow that's uh that's interesting he shall ask and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto death there is a sin unto death what a language I I'm not trying to unpack this and give us more understanding of what Sins Not unto death may be he says I do not say that he shall pray for it all unrighteousness is sin and there is a sin not unto death I love how he's showing that there's all in righteousness is sin and there's things that we realize we work on we pray for these these are things that we're working through we have Grace for one another but unbelief if I could just say it outright unbelief is the sin of unto death it is the original sin from which the Disobedience was born unbelief she Eve had def first the woman had to first disbelieve before she could ever act now can can there be forgiveness for the ACT can there be forgiveness for this can there be forgiveness for that well there's sins that are onto death but how can you be forgiven of unbelief in unbelief when somebody asks for forgiveness it's like will you forgive me for punching you right like yes yes yes yes yes right some point it just doesn't make sense like I don't believe you at all forgive me forgive me but I don't believe you man it's like well there you can't forgive unbelief notice this in John 16:17 and9 nevertheless I tell you the truth it is expedient for you that I go away for if I go not away the comforter will not come unto you but if I depart I will send him unto you and when he has come he will reprove the world of sin he says he will reprove the world of righteousness and of judgment SEC the next verses and 10 uh he gets into what the righteousness and judgment is but he will reprove the world of sin because they believe not on me it could easily be said he will reprove the world because they did not believe on me unbelief is called sin by Christ why because unbelief is the root it is the sap it is the power of all sin unbelief we could say is the head of the serpent that Christ was to crush in John 3:36 he that believeth on the son hath everlasting life and he that believeth not the son shall not see life but the wrath of God abideth on him simply put the unbelieving will not see life he that does not believe unbelief keeps us from Life unbelief Keeps Us under the wrath of God John 8:24 I said therefore unto you that you shall die in your sins what does that mean for if you believe not that I am he you shall die in your sins in other words the sin is not believing who he is how can we work the mighty works of God believe in him whom he hath sent this is the work this is the primary do you realize that many people at that day will come with a lot of other good things to show for themselves but they still hold in their hearts an evil heart of unbelief they still have a shortcoming of not believing the word of God I was thinking of it I was going to actually make the comment looking at the song Falling In Love With Jesus and it just been preparing my heart to minister on on what it means to fall in love with Jesus and loving Jesus and you know the question sometimes is what is love but really the question anymore is who's that Jesus you're in love with because it's not the one of the word if you do not believe you cannot be you cannot disbelieve and be delivered Hebrews 3: 12 and 13 take heed brethren unless there be any of any of you in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the Living God so unbelief gives cause to distancing leaving God there's your seduction through unbelief you depart from the Living God but exhort one another daily why is called today lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin that is the delusion of unbelief that's the beautiful one say Lord I believe help thou my unbelief there's the there's the real understanding because there's this delusion of unbelief that's completely solidly fine in that state of unbelief it's the evil heart of unbelief what is it sin so he calls it the deceitfulness of sin because unbelief is sin verses 17 and 19 but with whom was he grieved for 40 years was it not them that had sinned whose carcasses fell in the wilderness so at issue and the question is sin and to whom swear he that they should not enter into his rest but to them that believe not it's the same thing so we see that they could not enter in because of sin the Bible says they could not enter in because of unbelief sin is unbelief it's a mistrust in God sin is unbelief that's what it is amen I hope it kind of gets real in a positive way that when you find yourself quote unquote sinning if it's to those in in fornication those in lust those in activities or thought processes indulgences whatever it might be find yourself in sin what a what an opening to find that my problem is is I don't trust God who's absolutely trustworthy it's not trusting yourself not trusting the church or the preacher it's not trusting in a man and I believe this is one of the reasons why the word in our day is so direct and so explicit I can trust the word of God that's why the devil wants to change the conversation and to get you to step back a little bit and begin to question other things and in doing so you're not actually questioning your humanity and you're not questioning your sanity he's wanting you to question God God whose word is true and real in Mark chap 13:22 for false christs and false prophets shall arise and show signs and wonders we read it in Matthew it says to deceive but here it says to to seduce if it were possible even the elect seduction is Satan's goal but what is he what is the ultimate goal what is he trying to do he's trying to bring us to place of unbelief his purpose for seduction is to bring us to a place of a lack of trust whether we begin to act in lukewarmness or apathetic or whether we begin to do those things which are the fruits of unrighteousness at the heart of it is I want to create distance between you and God I want to change your perception of God I either want you to mischaracterize his character as being a god who's too restrictive or the god of the word the god of the Bible is a is a false picture of a a deity that ought to be the Sovereign over all who is just kind of a aqi or something in The Ether and and paint a different picture of God if he could just do that that's the unbelief that's the Seduction That Satan wants to achieve he's a Seducer and he is seducing Society on Sensational levels that we've never seen and the sedu is ineffective on those that believe it's not that he's able to work but ultimately the elect are secure why because having been born again they've given access to the freedom to not commit sin just going to point to it real quick that's why the Paradox of if you say you have not sinned then the truth is not in you to I have I I do not sin I have no sin to seduce Satan's goal is to seduce us to a place of unbelief Satan's entire system his entire system is set up to cause us to disbelieve God's word right that's been his system from the very beginning is he trying to get you to uh uh to do bad things well that happens if he can get us to disbelief because notice how he's just as effective in getting keeping people from doing quote unquote bad things but still in unbelief because his goal is sin and sin is unbelief Satan's always using the same tactic his system is to fight against the word of God and so what is God's power what is God's uh safety the word God help us to not fall for Satan's tricks and his devices be seduced keep this close to your heart always remembering this how that Satan his Art of Seduction is to cause you to view God differently and in viewing God differently it creates distance and that gives the space that we need to act on our own that's and this unbelief that's at the heart of it and it's a truth that God brought to us at this hour Brother Brad and preached that unbelief is sin sin is unbelief because it's the truth it's a truth that we must hold and it's a truth that's necessary to understand if we're going to completely overcome in this age Satan's seduction let's stand together today we'll just pray with you enjoy some time of worship worship there's a song that was sung at youth camps I know in Days Gone By The Devil Is A sly old Fox if I could catch him I'd put him in a box lock the box and throw away the key for all the tricks he played on me and if it was just that easy as catching a fox boy that would be I I'd become a fox Hunter I'd use whatever bait I could I would use whatever means possible but part of the seduction is making us think that well I'm going to I can catch the devil but God is saying do you realize why the phrase only believe anymore has become a bad word predestination became a a curse word to Pentecostals why because it it exposed the erors of their Theology and anymore to just believe the word has become like a cuss word I want to believe God's word I want to believe God's word well that's all he's asked you to do he'll take care of the rest if you want to be real if you don't want to just be a an unbeliever with makeup on take God at his word amen let's bow our heads and pray if anyone here finds himself in a place where they can be honest they haven't trusted the Lord and that the source of their problems the origin of the fruits of sin or unrighteousness in their lives is a lack of trust listen I get it if you don't trust me get it within my own family with my children if I've done anything to offend them where they don't completely fully trust me but you you've got to come to a place where you trust God that's the space the devil wants to create is just a little bit of mistrust paint a different picture he's an artist who can paint a picture so convincing so seducing that you'll believe a lie and it's become that's the source that's at the root of problems God help us to not fall victim to his seduction if there's any of us today who've been seduced Lord get our attention rescue us Lord we come to you with our hearts just being open I just encourage you to pray respond to him in whatever way that you know how Lord forgive me for my unfaithfulness Lord forgive me for my stubbornness forgive me for being seduced whatever it might be that you could do today with our heads bowed our gracious Heavenly Father we love you we thank you for your word Lord we know that the Bible contains many difficult passages we know that the word is often preached and it feels as if it is a sword that's cutting we feel the sternness and the hardness of it there so many examples of your your passion Lord so many examples of your your righteous indignation your Justice and your Fury but truly Lord that's just another side of your love for your compassion and your mercy your forgiveness and your patience the tenderness with which you lead us and guide us the way that you chose to spoke to us today Lord it it comforts me and father I pray that I can only speak for myself Lord as I utter this Lord I don't want unbelief to hinder me and I know unbelief will certainly hinder you father at what time I am tempted at what time I am being led astray and I'm being seduced may I recall that at its naked in its naked form I'm not trusting you in the moment and let me put praise upon my lips let me turn my eyes to you let me do all those things that could be indicative of one who recognizes the situation and is turning their trust towards you Lord I don't want the pretense of Praise I don't want the the popularity of partnership with other preachers Lord I I want I want to have this sincerity of heart for I believe you Lord I trust in you and I'm not looking for uh uh support Lord I'm not looking to external things to try to rally people around me so that I can feel secure in my relationship with you and my position but Lord I want to trust you even if I Stand Alone Lord even if it seems your promises are delayed Lord why why should I question you why should I without you lord I don't want to be like Peter that day in the dead of the night as the morning was Dawning in my fear and my lack of trust denying your supreme authority questioning your promise disassociating myself from you Lord I want to prove I'm not like that woman in the garden who allowed just in a moment to stop and through seduction create enough space for me to act act on my own to do things that are not right I guess it's enough to blame the devil all we want but truly I must take accountability for myself and not point at the Devil but say Lord forgive me I've been seduced forgive me Father in my weakness I've done something wrong Lord I want to prove I'm not like that woman I can stand the test we come to you today Lord with an open heart with a desire to be be washed to be purged to truly walk in that Liberty that you've given us this Freedom which is freedom not to sin by nature and by this new birth Lord as we have many scriptures that maybe get to another time lord if how by faith in you or we are made free by Faith by believing because unbelief is dead we have faith that liberates bless us I pray today as we are dismissed our visitors each one that was with us our youth meeting upcoming bless our fellowship Lord outside these walls may it be sweet Lord that we Fellowship in a manner that brings you glory we ask all this in the name of Lord Jesus Christ amen
