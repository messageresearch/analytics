[0:00] Matthew chapter 2 I'm going to read
[0:03] verses 1 to 12. now when Jesus was born
[0:05] in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of
[0:07] Herod the king behold there came wise
[0:10] men from the East to Jerusalem so
[0:11] beginning their Journey saying where is
[0:13] he that is born King of the Jews if we
[0:16] have seen his star in the east and we
[0:17] are come to worship him when Herod the
[0:20] king had heard these things he was
[0:21] troubled and all Jerusalem with him and
[0:24] when he had gathered all the chief
[0:25] priests and scribes of the people
[0:26] together he demanded of them where
[0:29] Christ should be born and they said unto
[0:31] him in Bethlehem of Judea for thus it is
[0:33] written by the prophet and thou
[0:35] Bethlehem and the land of Judah are not
[0:37] the least among the princes of Judah for
[0:39] out of these shall come a governor that
[0:41] shall rule My People Israel then Herod
[0:43] when he had privily called the wise men
[0:45] and quieter them diligently what time
[0:47] the star appeared and he sent them to
[0:50] Bethlehem and said go and search
[0:51] diligently for the young child and when
[0:54] you have found him bring me word again
[0:55] that I may come and worship him also and
[0:58] when they had heard the king they
[0:59] departed and lo the star which they saw
[1:01] in the East went be before them till it
[1:03] came and stood over where the young
[1:05] child was when they saw the star they
[1:07] rejoiced with exceeding great joy and
[1:10] when they were coming to the house they
[1:12] saw the young child with Mary's mother
[1:13] and they fell down and worshiped him and
[1:15] when they'd opened their Treasures they
[1:16] presented unto him gifts gold and
[1:18] frankincense and myrrh and being warned
[1:21] of God in a dream that they should not
[1:22] return to Herod they departed into their
[1:24] own country another way amen we desire
[1:27] that God would bless these words in this
[1:29] scripture you can be seated
[1:37] I'm going to finish this series on the
[1:39] joy of Salvation tonight there's a lot
[1:41] of subject matter maybe that we studied
[1:43] and had upon our heart we know that
[1:45] there's always a place to pick up on
[1:48] some of these things later but we're
[1:49] just going to title this one tonight
[1:50] rejoice in the gift rejoice in the gift
[1:54] and there's maybe different ways we're
[1:56] going to phrase it rejoicing in his gift
[1:58] or rejoicing in his presence but
[2:00] rejoicing in the gift and we'll just
[2:02] share some things with you that'll kind
[2:04] of make that title a little bit clearer
[2:06] but some of the things that we've been
[2:07] emphasizing in this series on the joy of
[2:09] Salvation is that our joy is in Christ
[2:12] and then when our joy is in Christ he
[2:15] enthuses us with the joy and gladness
[2:18] that is then something that he's behind
[2:20] it becomes a strength to us and we want
[2:22] to have our joy and our happiness in the
[2:24] right things one of the things that's
[2:26] been important to me right now is just
[2:28] because this is this holiday season and
[2:31] the time when people are thinking about
[2:32] the birth of Christ a time when many
[2:34] believe that Jesus was actually born
[2:36] and been wanting just to remind us of
[2:39] not only our season of Joy but the
[2:42] Genesis of our gladness what what
[2:44] initiates it what brings it to us what
[2:46] makes us happy what we rejoice in
[2:49] and so there's a lot of things that
[2:50] we've thought about in terms of the
[2:52] holiday season and how that's kind of a
[2:54] type or parallel you'll see how some of
[2:56] the services we've ministered have maybe
[2:58] been a little bit connected to Holiday
[3:00] themes but Christmas is a time that is
[3:04] marked by the theme of joy and you hear
[3:06] Joy is mentioned quite a bit and also
[3:07] gift giving and I would say that though
[3:10] the real meaning of those things has
[3:12] been lost there's still a truth to it
[3:14] there's even a truth to why gifts were
[3:16] exchanged there's a truth to why Joy has
[3:18] such a a
[3:20] place in the the lore in the language of
[3:23] the Christmas season and so even though
[3:25] some of it's been lost we can go back to
[3:27] the events of Christ's birth and see
[3:29] that Joy is one of those principal
[3:30] themes and this is a gift that God sent
[3:32] to the Earth so at the outset I'm kind
[3:34] of established some of these things
[3:36] related to Joy and then begin to build
[3:38] this idea of God giving a gift and what
[3:40] it means to us in this time we've read
[3:42] this through a number of services in
[3:44] Luke Chapter 2 verses 10 to 11. I will
[3:46] say at the outset my brother John to
[3:49] warned you I put very few scriptures
[3:51] very few quotes in there just so you
[3:53] could enjoy the service so welcome back
[3:55] it's good to have you back and uh just
[3:57] felt I did want maybe to be any kind of
[3:58] distractions because I do have a lot to
[4:00] get to but there's a few key places
[4:02] maybe uh that if you want to just relax
[4:04] brother John and lean into US enjoy it
[4:06] nobody's going to complain if they don't
[4:07] get a slide but if you catch it there
[4:10] there's only just a few there that will
[4:11] share but in Luke Chapter 2 verses 10
[4:14] and 11 it says and the angel said unto
[4:15] them here's the angel appearing to the
[4:17] Shepherds fear not for behold I bring
[4:19] you good tidings of great joy so this is
[4:22] news that is going to bring them it's a
[4:24] gospel of great joy something that is to
[4:26] enthuse them and excite them which shall
[4:28] be to all people for unto you is Born
[4:31] This Day in the city of David a savior
[4:34] which is Christ the lord there's the joy
[4:36] of our Salvation going to be bringing
[4:38] Good Tidings of great joy because
[4:41] there's a savior that is born and which
[4:43] is Christ the lord and remember the
[4:45] angel when it came to Mary and even or p
[4:48] appeared unto Joseph and said what his
[4:50] name would be his name would be Jesus
[4:52] which is Jehovah is salvation and so
[4:56] this is the savior is Jesus Jehovah is
[4:58] salvation and the announcement at his
[5:00] birth and the Shepherds come and view
[5:02] him there in the manger it is the savior
[5:05] and this to them is a great joy ought to
[5:08] be a great joy to them and so the
[5:10] Christmas season is one that is
[5:12] associated with the theme of joy
[5:13] gladness and mirth and rejoicing and
[5:15] they call it jolly and everyone's
[5:18] supposedly happy and some people remark
[5:20] that they like this time of year because
[5:22] people maybe try a little bit harder to
[5:24] be nice and people start feeling a
[5:25] little bit lifted up because they're
[5:26] expecting great Christmas gifts and then
[5:28] when they don't get what they want
[5:29] December 26th I think there's a reason
[5:31] why the Canadians call It Boxing Day
[5:33] right did I get that right I don't know
[5:35] maybe I'm thinking of the wrong kind of
[5:36] boxing but there's a maybe a letdown and
[5:39] the joy is gone but there's a real
[5:40] reason for Joy which is permanent as
[5:42] things that we can rejoice in I'm I'll
[5:45] share these with you maybe so we could
[5:46] kind of get some of these Christmas
[5:47] tunes in our mind brother Michael didn't
[5:48] seeing any this year and so maybe next
[5:51] year we'll work them in but think of
[5:52] some of the songs that we sing related
[5:54] to Christmas and how Joy is mentioned
[5:57] and Joy to the World the Lord is come
[5:59] and this and the song Angels We Have
[6:01] Heard On High it says echoing their
[6:03] joyous strains and the song Hark the
[6:06] Herald Angels Sing it's joyful all ye
[6:08] nations rise join the Triumph of the sky
[6:11] so it's Joy to the World Echo your
[6:14] joyous strains and uh rise joyfully and
[6:17] Oh Come All Ye Faithful it's oh come on
[6:19] you Faithful joyful and triumphant and
[6:23] the song O come O come Emmanuel which
[6:25] has kind of that that Hebrew a rhythm to
[6:28] it and sound it still is Rejoice Rejoice
[6:32] Emmanuel shall come to you o Israel this
[6:35] is a rejoicing and then the song Oh Holy
[6:38] Night a thrill of Hope the weary World
[6:41] rejoices that's what was Dawning at the
[6:44] birth of Christ that's why so many of
[6:45] these hymns that were written by these
[6:47] inspired songwriters are calling from a
[6:49] theme of Joy because the world sat in
[6:51] darkness but now at the birth of Christ
[6:53] it's a time to be joyful it's a time to
[6:55] Rejoice it's a time to Triumph it's a
[6:58] thrill of Hope because a great light is
[7:00] sprung up these are the themes
[7:02] associated with God sending his son even
[7:04] at his birth they're in a Manger though
[7:06] in that present State he can't conquer
[7:09] sin in that state as of yet he cannot
[7:12] declare the father just in a Manger
[7:14] alone just in that scene being captured
[7:16] as a babe but yet this is a great
[7:18] happening this is the beginning of his
[7:19] coming this is something extremely
[7:21] important
[7:22] and the four even the Forerunner of
[7:25] Christ I appreciate the tremendous pool
[7:26] tonight I just feel so comfortable and
[7:30] in Luke chapter 1 verse 14. and it is in
[7:33] his promise to Zacharias it says and
[7:35] thou shalt have joy in gladness and many
[7:38] shall rejoice at his birth speaking of
[7:40] even John John being the Forerunner of
[7:43] this joy that has come into the world
[7:45] John being a forerunner of Jehovah is a
[7:47] Salvation the Forerunner Jesus Christ
[7:50] Zacharias is Promised joy and gladness
[7:53] why because it's foreshadowing Christ
[7:55] something connected with Christ and then
[7:59] in Luke chapter 1 verse 44 when when
[8:01] Mary visits her cousin
[8:04] um Elizabeth and and she mentions you
[8:07] know the even the mention of the Savior
[8:09] to be born she says for lo as soon as
[8:11] thy voice of thy salutation sounded in
[8:14] my ears
[8:15] The Babe leaped in my womb for joy
[8:18] so John the Forerunner promised his
[8:21] promised to bring joy and gladness to
[8:23] his parents and many will rejoice in the
[8:25] birth of the Forerunner and now just at
[8:28] the salutation from Mary The Babe John
[8:31] leaps in the womb of his mother for Joy
[8:34] all right because it's in anticipation
[8:36] of the gift that Mary is carrying it's
[8:39] this theme of Joy being excited and it's
[8:41] a joy that is in anticipation of
[8:43] something coming it's an anticipation
[8:45] for things that are going to uh resolve
[8:48] things and satisfy things and save
[8:50] things so it's a joy and something
[8:51] future coming but when Christ comes it's
[8:54] not a future Joy it's a present Joy
[8:57] and this is what's being expressed at
[8:59] the time of his birth and we see this
[9:01] theme of Joy Joy Joy to the World Joy
[9:04] rejoicing at his birth the baby leaping
[9:06] for Joy at the salutation of Mary
[9:08] because of Christ that is coming
[9:11] and then to see this as a gift in Luke
[9:13] chapter 2 verse 7 it says and she
[9:14] brought forth her firstborn son wrapped
[9:17] him in swaddling clothes laid him in a
[9:19] Manger because there is no room for them
[9:21] in the end and brother Branham takes
[9:23] that wrapping of Christ and calls it
[9:25] God's wrapped gift
[9:27] this wrapping of the child at his birth
[9:29] he calls it God's wrapped gift he says
[9:31] the greatest thing was ever wrapped in
[9:33] human flesh was wrapped in it God
[9:35] himself wrapped him oh his own self in a
[9:38] Christmas package and sent it to the
[9:39] world it's a different way of looking at
[9:41] Christmas right God wrapped himself in
[9:44] this Christmas package and sent it to
[9:46] the world that's what's envisioned even
[9:48] in this image of Christ being wrapped in
[9:51] swaddling clothes and think oh that's
[9:52] not really good wrapping paper we have
[9:54] in our family we exchange gifts amongst
[9:56] one of us and sister Elizabeth is really
[9:58] really good I admire a gift someone
[9:59] could wrap a gift right be able to fold
[10:01] it just right and everything lines up
[10:03] just neat no matter how much I try and
[10:05] the rest of us try in the family we
[10:06] always know which gifts are Elizabeth's
[10:09] this one's gonna wrap the worst and and
[10:12] so in that way I'm a much like God who
[10:14] wrapped the most wonderful gift it may
[10:16] be a way that's not very appealing so I
[10:19] appreciate being Godlike that way it
[10:21] looks like swaddling clothes it's uneven
[10:23] it's not fit for the gift that it
[10:24] contains but yet this is God's way of
[10:27] wrapping the greatest thing ever wrapped
[10:28] in human flesh God himself wrapped his
[10:31] own self in a Christmas package and sent
[10:33] it to the world and what happened when
[10:35] those Shepherds were told there's going
[10:37] to be this babe born you're going to
[10:38] find them laying in a manger and the
[10:40] Bible tells us he's wrapped there in
[10:41] these swaddling clothes and they come
[10:43] and they witness this site they have the
[10:45] announcement of these angels in their
[10:47] hearts and it says the Shepherds
[10:48] returned glorifying and praising God for
[10:51] all the things that they had heard and
[10:52] seen as it was told unto them this
[10:55] glorifying it could have been translated
[10:56] celebrating they left after seeing God's
[10:59] wrapped gift they left celebrating for
[11:02] what they had seen and what they had
[11:03] heard the announcement of Joy to the
[11:06] World and these Good Tidings and all
[11:07] these things it's it's real to them it's
[11:10] present to them and as they left this
[11:12] manger scene they were celebrated and
[11:14] praising God for what they had
[11:15] experienced
[11:16] and if I could say this way it was the
[11:18] presence of the promise being manifested
[11:21] that was bringing the joy not the joy of
[11:24] something to be not the joy of something
[11:26] past
[11:29] manifest
[11:33] bringing them joy we could we could be
[11:35] excited because God promises us
[11:36] something and therefore we could be
[11:39] excited about the promise and then we
[11:40] could be excited in anticipating its
[11:43] fulfillment but in the moment that God
[11:45] is fulfilling it that's a joy different
[11:48] from receive the promise of it right and
[11:51] then the anticipation of it this is the
[11:53] receiving of it this is the presence of
[11:56] it this is a a Greater Joy and so when
[11:59] Christ is born I want you to recognize
[12:02] this and this is why we're wanting to go
[12:04] to Matthew Chapter 2 and Christ was born
[12:06] it wasn't the event there may be a
[12:08] little bit of a word play here it wasn't
[12:09] the event but the Advent
[12:11] in other words it's not that they from
[12:13] that moment on oh remember this day when
[12:16] Christ was born and always going back to
[12:18] revisit what had been in something
[12:19] historical and some something some event
[12:21] in the past now that Christ had come
[12:24] there was going to be an unfolding of
[12:26] the presence of God there's going to be
[12:28] a manifestation and an interpretation of
[12:30] what it meant for a savior to be born
[12:32] there was going to be an interpretation
[12:33] of what it meant for a messiah to come
[12:35] into the world there was going to be an
[12:37] interpretation of all the promises
[12:38] pertaining to the son of David and so
[12:41] now they what you would want to do is
[12:43] from that moment walk in the light of
[12:45] the promises that unfolded itself so it
[12:48] wasn't the event that brought Joy but
[12:49] the Advent or is coming as we looked at
[12:51] it a couple Wednesdays ago or that maybe
[12:53] last Wednesday his coming and continued
[12:56] presence with
[12:57] it wouldn't have been appropriate for
[12:59] the the Shepherds just to always oh you
[13:01] remember that night oh man you remember
[13:02] that night wasn't that an amazing night
[13:03] and the angels lit the sky and the
[13:06] rejoicing I mean think of how the
[13:07] magnitude of what they experienced and
[13:10] they could have lived in the memory of
[13:12] that and the and the rehearsing of that
[13:14] but that was only the beginning
[13:17] there was still a messiah to be made
[13:18] manifest to Christ to be made known so
[13:20] in Matthew Chapter 2 what we do seeing
[13:22] is a continuation of this gift
[13:25] continuation of this Advent this coming
[13:27] not just the event of his birth but now
[13:30] as it begins to manifest in the promises
[13:32] because we could continue to read in
[13:33] Matthew Chapter 2 and find that the the
[13:36] Lord appears to Joseph in a dream and
[13:39] tells him to flee down into Egypt and
[13:41] then come back out of Egypt that it
[13:42] might be fulfilled as it was spoken by
[13:44] Hosea the prophet out of Egypt have I
[13:46] called my son so there's more
[13:48] fulfillments of fulfillments of Prophecy
[13:50] that are manifesting in the Life of
[13:53] Christ as he grows increases wisdom and
[13:55] stature and in favor with God and man so
[13:57] in verses 9 to 11
[14:00] he says when they'd heard the king they
[14:01] departed now this is the the wise men
[14:03] the magias as they're said and we the
[14:05] Bible only tells us that there were wise
[14:07] men we get the three from the three
[14:08] gifts and uh and there's a there's a lot
[14:12] I remember as a children uh we'd have a
[14:14] nativity scene set up on Christmas and
[14:17] nativity scene had wise men at the where
[14:20] the babe was in the manger and so being
[14:22] a legalist when it comes to the
[14:23] scripture I would take the wise men and
[14:25] put him in the front yard he said
[14:26] they're not quite there yet
[14:28] they're on their way they'll get there
[14:30] but they weren't there at his birth and
[14:33] so we know that he was a young child and
[14:35] it was they weren't there at the night
[14:36] of his birth and so it says that they'd
[14:39] come from the East and now it says in
[14:41] verse 9 and when they'd heard they come
[14:43] and they see The King The King says oh
[14:45] oh please tell me where this Messiah is
[14:47] born so I can worship him right and wink
[14:50] wink to his army General right if we
[14:53] could just figure out where he is we'll
[14:54] take care of this and there's a reason
[14:56] why he requested the the um the uh the
[15:00] genocide of male babies two and under
[15:02] because they would have been in that
[15:03] time frame so Christ when they saw the
[15:05] star when it appeared and how long
[15:06] they'd been journeying would have placed
[15:08] child Christ as a young child nearly two
[15:10] years old and so now it says that when
[15:13] they Departed the king and when they'd
[15:16] enter Jerusalem brother Brandon even
[15:17] touches it on this way and a lot of uh
[15:19] the way the scripture is written and
[15:21] brother random emphasizes this that when
[15:23] they had entered into Jerusalem the star
[15:25] that they were following disappeared
[15:28] so now that they're there they're like
[15:30] well we were falling a star we came to
[15:31] Jerusalem maybe they thought this is
[15:32] where it would be but now that they've
[15:34] entered into that religion and into that
[15:36] air that churchianity and all those
[15:38] things the Stars no longer appeared but
[15:40] now when they leave they as they begin
[15:43] to Journey again they say that they see
[15:45] the star and it went before them so now
[15:48] it's leading again until it come and
[15:51] stood over where the young child was
[15:54] and it says and when they saw the star
[15:56] they rejoiced with exceeding great joy
[15:59] and then they they gave the gifts and
[16:01] they worshiped him and they knelt down
[16:03] before him and worshiped him now what I
[16:05] want to emphasize here
[16:07] is that they're rejoicing wasn't just in
[16:10] the star alone
[16:11] it wasn't oh there's the star again
[16:13] we're excited about the star if the star
[16:16] itself was the cause for rejoicing they
[16:18] never would have had the left the leave
[16:19] the East it should have never left they
[16:22] could have just worshiped the star they
[16:23] could have been excited about the story
[16:25] they could have talked about the star
[16:26] they could have written about the star
[16:27] but when they saw the star they knew the
[16:29] star meant something greater than the
[16:31] appearance of the star and they were
[16:33] moved to follow the star because the
[16:35] star was a Guiding Light to bring them
[16:38] to the promise the star was not the
[16:40] promise himself so the cause of Joy or
[16:42] the true cause of rejoicing as it says
[16:44] when they saw the star they rejoiced
[16:46] with exceeding great joy the verse
[16:48] before it tells us that the star LED
[16:50] them to where the young child was and
[16:52] that's the true cause of rejoicing
[16:55] it wasn't the star in the sky but it was
[16:57] the star in the house
[16:58] because the Bible tells us that Jesus
[17:01] I Jesus had sent me an angel to testify
[17:03] to you these things in the church is I
[17:04] am the root in The Offspring of David
[17:06] the bright in Morningstar Revelations 22
[17:09] 16. so this Guiding Light this star that
[17:11] was in the sky was leading him to Christ
[17:13] even John Wesley when he comments on
[17:16] this verse he writes when they saw the
[17:18] star standing over the child they
[17:20] rejoiced with exceeding great joy that's
[17:24] what that's what the cause of rejoicing
[17:25] is when it led them to the place that
[17:28] they'd been seeking when it brought them
[17:29] to the finish line of what it had been
[17:31] promising
[17:32] and so once the star had led him to
[17:34] Christ this was the time to Rejoice
[17:36] fully
[17:37] this was a time uh that they could
[17:40] really let out a praise see and the star
[17:42] is great it's wonderful because you know
[17:43] it's guiding you that gives you a sense
[17:44] of anticipation that gives just as the
[17:46] angel said unto uh to Zacharias you're
[17:49] going to have joy and gladness and then
[17:51] you'll Rejoice at his birth that gives
[17:52] you reason to be excited right just
[17:54] knowing that Joy is coming it gives you
[17:56] a reason to be joyful in itself but now
[17:58] when they find the child that is a true
[18:00] cause of rejoicing and they Rejoice with
[18:02] exceeding great joy
[18:04] the star appearing was only a temporary
[18:06] event
[18:08] that was to lead him to Christ
[18:10] and if I could say this the joy for the
[18:13] wise men began in knowing what the star
[18:15] meant hey that it was going to lead them
[18:18] to a messiah and that's what that's
[18:20] that's really if they had just rejoiced
[18:22] in the star uh from a scientific
[18:24] standpoint that wouldn't have been a
[18:25] reason to that's the wrong reason to be
[18:27] happy and maybe a lot of astrologers and
[18:30] stargazers or whatever could have been
[18:31] astronomers I could have been looking at
[18:33] him like wow this is amazing we never
[18:34] said anything like this this is
[18:35] fantastic I'm really excited and to be
[18:37] like well that's not really you're
[18:38] looking at it wrong it's not the
[18:41] constellation it's not the brightness of
[18:43] it it's not that we've never seen this
[18:44] before it's the fact that this is a
[18:46] Guiding Light declaring that God has
[18:48] sent a gift to the Earth that the
[18:49] Messiah has been sent that God is
[18:51] wrapping himself in flesh that's the
[18:53] real cause for Joy so if you see the
[18:56] sign or you see the star true Joy only
[18:59] begins when you recognize what it really
[19:01] means
[19:02] and so the fullness of rejoicing
[19:04] was not in recognizing the star even
[19:07] following the star
[19:08] but it was in knowing what it was
[19:10] leading them to
[19:11] and the complete joy as it said they
[19:13] rejoiced with exceeding great joy this
[19:15] complete Joy was in seeing the
[19:16] manifestation of the promise having that
[19:18] Star Guide him to that spot finding out
[19:21] what the star getting to the place that
[19:23] the star appointed them to
[19:24] as they had come and they said where is
[19:26] this king of the Jews they knew the
[19:28] Stars signified this royalty the coming
[19:31] of the Messiah where is he that's the
[19:33] reason why they were drawn from the East
[19:35] to Jerusalem and to Israel
[19:37] now in
[19:39] John chapter 3 verses 26 to 30. it's
[19:43] wonderful we have just a really nice
[19:44] group here tonight because these are
[19:46] some things that maybe we might follow
[19:47] up on and you'll have a really a sound
[19:49] basis to have already kind of digested
[19:52] these things pondered them a little bit
[19:53] uh studied it in them yourselves and
[19:56] then if we come back together we preach
[19:57] this and there's some more people here
[19:59] you all will be amen and they're like
[20:00] wait what did I miss
[20:02] right it'd be nice that'd be fun and
[20:05] John chapter 3 verses 26 to 30. I want
[20:07] you to recognize this in terms of this
[20:08] complete joy as they read the the Magis
[20:11] Rejoice with exceeding great joy when
[20:13] the star LED them to where the child was
[20:15] now here's the Forerunner John it says
[20:18] and they came Disciples of John came
[20:19] unto John and said to him Rabbi he that
[20:21] was with thee Beyond Jordan to whom thou
[20:23] bearest witness what was it Behold the
[20:25] Lamb of God who taketh away the world
[20:27] behold the same which is Christ
[20:29] baptize it and all men come to him now
[20:32] they were a little upset
[20:35] that the very one that John said Behold
[20:37] the Lamb of God who takes away the sin
[20:38] of the world this is the one I told you
[20:40] about
[20:41] and now people begin to follow them
[20:42] there's still some Disciples of John
[20:45] they were having trouble with the
[20:47] transition and didn't like the fact that
[20:49] people were following Christ they were
[20:51] still Disciples of John and hadn't
[20:53] caught the transition so John ansonus
[20:55] said a man can receive nothing except to
[20:57] be given him from Heaven what a
[20:58] beautiful response just in terms of a
[21:01] general idea he says ye bear witness ye
[21:03] yourselves bear witness bear me witness
[21:05] that I said I am not the Christ
[21:09] but that I am sent before him
[21:11] he that hath the bride is the bridegroom
[21:15] what a tremendous statement but the
[21:17] friend of the bridegroom which standeth
[21:19] and heareth him rejoiceth greatly
[21:21] because of the bridegroom's voice now
[21:24] notice the language and the analogy he's
[21:26] trying to use to his disciples who are a
[21:28] little bit miffed that Jesus now has
[21:30] followers and he's baptizing also and
[21:32] he's in the Fulfillment of John's
[21:33] prophecy he's the Vindication of John's
[21:35] Ministry and so John uses this language
[21:38] he says I am not the Christ I'm the
[21:40] Forerunner it's important for us to
[21:42] recognize that I am not the Christ but I
[21:44] am the forerun I'm the one that was sent
[21:45] before him and he that hath the bride is
[21:48] the bridegroom I am a friend of the
[21:51] bridegroom I am near him and I hear his
[21:54] voice and I Rejoice greatly because the
[21:57] bridegroom's voice and notice this
[21:58] phrase this my joy therefore is
[22:02] fulfilled
[22:03] thus my joy as a prophet as the
[22:07] Forerunner is complete because I see the
[22:10] bridegroom with his bride in the voice
[22:13] of the bridegroom is my rejoicing
[22:15] because I can say I've done what I was
[22:17] supposed to do if this is the
[22:19] authentication of my Ministry this is
[22:21] the Vindication that I was a forerunner
[22:23] in the fact that the one that I claim to
[22:25] forerun is here manifesting himself he
[22:28] says my joy is full my joy is complete
[22:32] because I see Christ with his people
[22:34] Christ with his followers so he makes
[22:37] this statement he must increase but I
[22:39] must decrease
[22:41] remember my title tonight is rejoice in
[22:45] the gift
[22:46] rejoice in the gift
[22:49] and that there's a
[22:51] rejoicing that we must have there's a
[22:53] fellowship that we must have a rejoice
[22:55] in that we must have and that there's a
[22:57] completion of it when we come there's
[23:00] this exceeding great joy that we can
[23:02] achieve when we recognize the
[23:03] Fulfillment of the word of God in our
[23:04] hour
[23:05] in the sermon voice of the sign
[23:09] ow
[23:10] now let me just I'll say this that
[23:12] there's a in sports there's a phenomena
[23:15] of a letdown game
[23:17] because maybe there's a big game coming
[23:19] up and so the teams play on the weekend
[23:21] and they lose to a team that they
[23:24] otherwise ought to have been because
[23:25] they were looking forward to the next
[23:26] weekend
[23:27] and so there's a little bit of a letdown
[23:32] let's not do that tonight
[23:34] okay
[23:35] let's not look forward to the weekend
[23:37] let's get everything we can right now
[23:39] let's not lose something tonight so
[23:41] everybody who's here and present helped
[23:43] me to preach this because I'm not going
[23:45] to stop until I'm satisfied how's that
[23:46] I'm not going to quit until I'm done
[23:48] until I Feel Complete there's been many
[23:50] times I've left the pulpit and I've just
[23:52] salt because I felt incomplete I felt
[23:53] like I laid an egg I did a horrible job
[23:55] well tonight if I feel bad I'm just
[23:57] going to keep preaching until I feel
[23:59] good
[23:59] and that's gonna be up to you to make me
[24:01] feel good
[24:02] all right so some incentive there
[24:05] it's not reverse psychology it's just
[24:07] nothing but the truth I need your help
[24:09] tonight now John said thus my joy this
[24:13] my joy is complete is fulfilled because
[24:15] the bridegroom whom I full ran I hear
[24:18] his voice now he's the one speaking and
[24:20] he's with his bride and I'm the one
[24:22] that's near the bridegroom and I'm
[24:24] satisfied I'm happy to see those
[24:26] attracted to Christ come to Christ and
[24:28] know Christ and he says I must in he
[24:31] must increase so I must decrease
[24:33] now there's certainly a way that that
[24:35] could have been that could be misused to
[24:37] bring dishonor to the prophet Jesus is
[24:39] sure to say that there's no none greater
[24:41] than John
[24:42] and so brother Brandon picks up on this
[24:44] and voice of the sign he said John The
[24:46] Prophet's appearing on Earth after 400
[24:48] years without a prophet the sign after
[24:49] 400 years of him appearing that little
[24:52] lacks time little slacking off a little
[24:54] quiet time says now if you're spiritual
[24:56] you'll catch what I'm saying
[24:58] right what's his testimony as John 4 ran
[25:01] just as John a very critical phrase
[25:04] associated with brother Brown's Ministry
[25:05] he says now if you're spiritual you'll
[25:07] catch what I'm saying may God open up
[25:09] your understanding
[25:10] how long has it been 400 years that
[25:12] Israel without a prophet the churches
[25:14] had got all twisted up and they're here
[25:16] come John on the scene John was the
[25:18] prophet a sign that the Messiah was
[25:20] going to speak after him watch because
[25:22] Malachi 3 said I'll send my messenger
[25:24] before my face to prepare the way
[25:25] prepare the people look at John no
[25:28] selfishness in him he never took any
[25:29] Glory they tried to call him the Messiah
[25:32] now if you're a spiritual catch what
[25:34] he's trying to say right to try to call
[25:35] him the side he says I'm not worthy to
[25:37] lose the shoes but as soon as Jesus
[25:39] appeared he had a sign a pillar fire A
[25:41] Light Above him like a dove come down
[25:42] from a voice saying this is my beloved
[25:45] Son whom I'm well pleased notice and
[25:47] John immediately said
[25:49] he must increase I must decrease
[25:54] and if you're taking notes I'd write
[25:56] this one down he presented the church to
[25:59] Christ
[26:00] now notice the unique way that brother
[26:02] Banner phrased that John had developed
[26:05] disciples and followers and we know that
[26:06] many of Jesus's disciples were
[26:08] previously followers of John and even
[26:10] them would have been in this transition
[26:12] phase of walking with John and seeing
[26:14] Christ and then we see that Peter and
[26:16] some of them begin to follow Christ holy
[26:18] and only and now he says I must decrease
[26:20] because Christ must increase and what
[26:23] John did is he presented he handed the
[26:26] church off to Christ
[26:28] sometimes we say well it's the
[26:30] introduction of Christ to the church but
[26:32] there's also this element of John
[26:33] presenting the church to Christ and then
[26:36] Christ is the one that introduces the
[26:39] faith to the Christian church
[26:41] that's what brother Adam taught us that
[26:42] Christ is the one there's an
[26:44] introduction made but it's not the
[26:46] messenger it's not John that brings the
[26:48] faith and introduces the faith to the
[26:50] Pentecostal fathers but it's Christ to
[26:52] introduce the faith to the Christian
[26:54] church
[26:55] and he says we are told that in the last
[26:57] days that will repeat again
[26:59] there's going to be a message come forth
[27:01] that will introduce the Messiah to the
[27:03] people
[27:04] and it will be in such a way they'll
[27:06] stand stand dumbfounded like they did
[27:08] then he promised it right right can it
[27:11] happen in a way they're going to stand
[27:13] dumbfound now it doesn't mean it's going
[27:14] to happen exactly the same way but
[27:17] there'll be some of the same elements
[27:18] some of the same Intrigue some of the
[27:19] same mystery he says there's a promise
[27:21] that it's going to happen it will repeat
[27:22] again there's going to be a message that
[27:24] will introduce the Messiah but it's
[27:26] going to happen in a way where people
[27:27] will be dumbfounded it's not going to be
[27:29] obvious they're going to be confused
[27:30] there's going to be a lot of people
[27:31] tripping up but he says he promised it
[27:34] and the sermon proven his word brother
[27:36] Brahm says we know that there's a
[27:37] messiah coming
[27:38] and when that Messiah comes he's going
[27:40] to be the word
[27:42] how will he appear in the last days
[27:44] so that the bride will know her mate the
[27:46] revealed word these are the things that
[27:48] we're taught about the message of the
[27:49] hour and so if I could say this when I
[27:51] say rejoice in the gift his presence is
[27:54] the real gift today
[27:56] he's thinking of that statement over and
[27:57] over again I wonder if we are
[27:58] sufficiently impressed with the word
[28:00] that is in our midst are we impressed
[28:02] sufficiently impressed with this
[28:03] presence
[28:05] in the sermon we have seen his star and
[28:07] have come to worship Him
[28:09] I found this Sermon Just to be uh it's
[28:12] such a brother-in spirit in the sermon
[28:14] it's just so beautiful how he preached
[28:16] such a masterpiece at this uh in this
[28:19] banquet I believe it was
[28:21] and just how he pulled the people and
[28:23] was just making this beautiful
[28:24] introduction in such a way to where one
[28:26] would just want to fall in love with
[28:28] Christ
[28:29] he says but tonight we know that you're
[28:30] here
[28:32] somehow maybe we might not see it seen
[28:34] it with just our eyes but we felt it
[28:36] with our other sense our sense of
[28:38] feeling the sense of feeling our heart
[28:39] our conscience our soul spoke to us and
[28:42] said this is what I'd want our hearts to
[28:44] ring out in this Christian time
[28:45] Christmas time we're in the presence of
[28:47] Jesus Christ
[28:48] the greatest Christmas gift the first
[28:51] real Christmas gift from God to man
[28:54] can our souls uh feel that and
[28:56] experience that that the real gift is
[28:58] Christ he says that the we're in the
[29:00] presence of Jesus Christ and the
[29:02] presence of Jesus Christ is the great
[29:04] greatest Christmas gift the presence of
[29:06] Jesus Christ was the first real
[29:08] Christmas gift that God gave man
[29:12] and he says can I well I'm saying it to
[29:14] you this way can our souls say we're in
[29:15] the presence of Jesus Christ
[29:18] as Paul says in first Thessalonians 2 19
[29:20] what is Our Hope what is our joy what is
[29:22] our crown of rejoicing
[29:24] are not even ye in the presence of our
[29:26] Lord Jesus Christ it is coming
[29:28] is not his presence our crown of
[29:30] rejoicing is it not our Vindication as
[29:32] the Bible says that that constant
[29:34] wearing of the unjust judge and finally
[29:36] says I'll just get rid of the woman I
[29:38] will avenge her and God Jesus says he
[29:40] will avenge his only elect speedily
[29:42] he'll come to their aid come to their
[29:44] defense and he says but will the son of
[29:46] man find faith when he cometh
[29:48] that's the revealing of the son of man
[29:50] looking for that Faith that's excited in
[29:52] the people that that desire from the
[29:54] people and that's our Vindication that's
[29:56] our Triumph are we not in the presence
[29:58] of the Lord Jesus Christ when he makes
[30:00] himself known unto us
[30:03] in the sermon why it had to be Shepherd
[30:05] how many of you young people have been
[30:06] doing Phil and the blank
[30:09] are any of you familiar with that it's
[30:11] not fill in the blanks but it's Phil
[30:13] p-h-i-l and the blanks and he does it to
[30:16] it with our young people gives them
[30:17] those handouts to fill in the blanks and
[30:19] there's one of them is why it had to be
[30:24] Shepherd
[30:26] not Shepherds singular why it had to be
[30:28] Shepherd
[30:30] and he says Christ is the word the
[30:33] anointed word made manifest
[30:35] and if there's any Open Hearts here
[30:37] tonight that don't have that Messiah the
[30:41] real Christmas gift the only real
[30:44] Christmas gift there is that God gave
[30:45] the world and declared declared it to
[30:48] the World by Shepherds of this of Islam
[30:49] the atonement for sin and if that heart
[30:52] is open and I I love this place it in
[30:54] place in it Lord the Messiah word of
[30:58] today
[30:59] what a beautiful prayer these prayers
[31:01] he's praying in these sermons he says oh
[31:03] if they don't have the real Messiah
[31:06] the real Christmas gift and he says
[31:07] place the Messiah word of today in their
[31:10] hearts he says we commit them to you in
[31:12] the name of Jesus Christ your son
[31:14] and as he comes into that sermon he says
[31:16] I'm so happy to know that I live in the
[31:19] presence of the king
[31:21] the Messiah word of today not some
[31:24] denominational expectation not some
[31:26] promise to another day but the Messiah
[31:28] word of today says I'm happy to know I'm
[31:31] living in the presence of the king he
[31:32] says Lord could you place the Messiah
[31:34] word of today in the hearts of the
[31:36] people
[31:38] we've been using Deuteronomy 16 15.
[31:41] that time of rejoicing the season of our
[31:43] joy for Israel it says for seven days
[31:45] you are to celebrate in the presence of
[31:47] the Lord your God where is it when the
[31:49] time of the Harvest will your joy be
[31:51] complete
[31:52] that's the time we're living in now the
[31:54] Rapture time the Harvest Time the
[31:56] harvest season therefore it's a time to
[31:58] celebrate not so because of some future
[32:02] event but in the Harvest presently
[32:05] where there's the ripening taking place
[32:07] we are laying in the presence of the son
[32:09] to ripen that means there has to be a
[32:12] present s-o-n causing you to ripen
[32:16] we're not ripening in the promise of the
[32:18] sun we're ripening in the presence of
[32:20] the Sun
[32:22] there's this uh I I had all these in my
[32:24] my notes to share with you tonight and I
[32:27] well just kept trimming it down and
[32:28] trimming it down and I have more than I
[32:30] would normally take to any service I've
[32:31] I've had less notes for a convention
[32:34] and I hope there's one thing you notice
[32:36] I take a Wednesday night just as
[32:37] seriously as I would a Saturday Saturday
[32:39] night in the Congo preaching at 35 000
[32:41] people just as serious
[32:43] I might be eating better and getting
[32:45] more sleep for a Wednesday night than
[32:46] that but still take it very serious
[32:50] now there's a Peter talks about how
[32:53] they'll be scoffing
[32:54] as conference at the list they said
[32:56] where is the promise of his coming
[32:58] where is the message of his coming where
[33:00] where is it because everything remains
[33:01] as it was and nothing has ever changed
[33:03] what is it they miss
[33:05] they miss the coming they miss the truth
[33:06] of it they're looking for something else
[33:08] and when we talk about the promise of
[33:10] something there's a way that we can say
[33:12] oh well the promise of his coming is the
[33:14] fact that God promised that he would
[33:16] come but what is the promise of spring
[33:19] life
[33:20] green rain uh vitality and so when you
[33:24] receive the promise the promise of it is
[33:27] all these things coming together the
[33:28] promise of something is what it brings
[33:31] and so when we say that we're going to
[33:33] be when you live in this time we're to
[33:34] celebrate in the presence of the Lord
[33:36] Our God because it's harvest time this
[33:38] is the time of perfection this is a time
[33:40] of ripening this is the time of the the
[33:43] soon it's going to happen where we will
[33:45] be out of here
[33:46] and it's in that time he says your joy
[33:48] will be complete
[33:50] and brother brannerman the Harvest Time
[33:51] says the church that lives by that word
[33:53] rightly not through organization but in
[33:56] the presence of the word the son it
[33:59] becomes a very same word that went down
[34:01] on the day of Pentecost
[34:04] that is a mouthful I think our students
[34:08] should diagram this in their homeschool
[34:09] classes
[34:10] the church that lives by the word he
[34:12] says rightly not through organization
[34:15] but in the presence of the word the son
[34:18] could you imagine this diagram do we
[34:19] diagram sentences anymore
[34:21] it says it becomes a real it becomes a a
[34:25] very same word that went down on the day
[34:27] of Pentecost would you catch that
[34:29] not the same word that was there in the
[34:32] upper room that received what came down
[34:34] but they become the word that comes down
[34:37] they become the same word that the
[34:39] church that lives by the word correctly
[34:42] in the presence of the son the word
[34:44] becomes the very same word
[34:47] he says doesn't Malachi 4 teach us that
[34:49] before the great and terrible day of the
[34:50] Lord shall come that this will take
[34:52] place how many knows that and he will
[34:54] restore the hearts of the children of
[34:55] the fathers is that right the faith of
[34:57] the original Pentecostal fathers and in
[34:59] that day Luke 17 30 I believe it is when
[35:01] the son of man is being revealed not man
[35:03] the son of man not an organization the
[35:06] son of man
[35:09] not a son of man
[35:12] but the son of man a son of man
[35:13] revealing the son of man he says
[35:16] the word I love this the word living
[35:18] itself again among the people
[35:21] now it's got to become a personal
[35:22] identification the word itself made
[35:25] flesh in you
[35:26] you are a reflection of the this hour
[35:29] the message if I can say this way you
[35:31] are a reflection of the message of the
[35:33] hour a reflection of it you live again
[35:35] the life that was in Jesus Christ you
[35:38] are in the presence of the son
[35:42] you'll become the visible manifestation
[35:44] of the invisible God you become the
[35:46] visible manifestation of God who is the
[35:49] invisible God made flesh in Christ you
[35:51] become the same thing
[35:54] this is part of the revelation of the
[35:56] rapture
[35:58] remember when brother Madam takes his
[35:59] text I think I maybe have it here okay I
[36:01] do I'll come to it here in a moment this
[36:03] is part of the revelation of the Rapture
[36:04] in the secret of his Tabernacle what is
[36:06] in the secret of his presence he'll hide
[36:08] me you are in the presence of the son
[36:12] he says this revelation of the son of
[36:14] man is you becoming a reflection of the
[36:16] word of God
[36:17] the Bible says in first chronicles 16 27
[36:20] Glory and Honor are in his presence
[36:23] strength and gladness are in his place
[36:27] the Bible says that do you celebrate the
[36:29] presence of the Lord your God at the
[36:30] place where the Lord will choose because
[36:33] he's going to bless you with the Harvest
[36:34] and your joy will be complete Glory and
[36:36] Honor in his presence you want Glory and
[36:37] Honor you want rejoice and you want
[36:38] praise be in his presence and strength
[36:41] and gladness are in the same place where
[36:43] he is
[36:44] it says in Exodus chapter 15 at that
[36:46] time of The Exodus and crossing the Red
[36:48] Sea the Lord is my strength and song and
[36:50] he has become my salvation
[36:52] notice the phrasing he has become my
[36:56] salvation not the event of being saved
[36:58] but the person the savior he is my
[37:02] salvation the Lord is my strength and my
[37:05] song he has become my salvation he is my
[37:07] God and I will prepare him at habitation
[37:10] Exodus 15 2. I will prepare him in
[37:12] habitation my father's God and I will
[37:16] exalt him
[37:18] notice what it's saying that he is the
[37:20] Lord is my strength he's my song He's my
[37:22] praise he's my rejoicing and he has
[37:25] become my salvation so I will prepare
[37:27] him a habitation
[37:30] and what does the psalmist tell us that
[37:31] the Lord oh Thou Art holy oh thou that
[37:34] inhabit us the Praises of Israel
[37:38] what does this tell us that I'm going to
[37:40] how can we build a habitation for God
[37:41] how could you build up a house how is it
[37:44] you could set him up a structure in a
[37:46] place that he could reside I will
[37:48] prepare him at habitation our joy is
[37:52] when we make our heart his home
[37:55] that that we rejoice in him he has
[37:57] become our salvation and then our joyful
[37:59] hearts become the habitation prepared
[38:01] for him
[38:03] there's been a statement I've been
[38:04] longing to read to you uh since the
[38:07] beginning of this series
[38:08] and I'll say this for everyone I don't
[38:10] even want those streaming at home jot
[38:12] this down go look it up the full
[38:13] paragraph the things he's saying
[38:15] preceding this because he's talking
[38:16] about attending Wednesday night services
[38:18] but uh you know I want you all to read
[38:20] this and see this but I'm clipping it
[38:22] for briefing us here brother bam says in
[38:25] the sermon why there's he's talking
[38:27] about why is there no joy in the house
[38:28] of the Lord anymore
[38:30] he says we're going to other places for
[38:31] pleasure instead of coming to the house
[38:33] of the Lord for pleasure
[38:35] we're finding our satisfaction and other
[38:37] things instead of the house of God and I
[38:40] believe that we ought to make a much
[38:41] more I apologize for saying it to the
[38:43] Wednesday night crowd on the Wednesday
[38:44] before uh Christmas to the group that's
[38:46] been here 52 Wednesday nights already or
[38:49] however many there are
[38:50] but I think we ought to get even more
[38:54] perseverant
[38:55] and labor and press
[38:58] to be in the house of God together
[39:00] is notice what he says we're going to
[39:02] other places for pleasure instead of
[39:03] coming to the house of the Lord for
[39:04] pleasure the house of the Lord is the
[39:06] joy of the Lord
[39:09] the joy of the Lord is the joy of his
[39:11] people
[39:13] The Joy write that down take pictures of
[39:16] it the joy of the Lord is the joy of his
[39:19] people what makes God happy to see you
[39:22] happy
[39:23] the joy of the Lord is the joy of his
[39:25] people what a Dynamo what what
[39:26] omnipotence meeting the joy the house of
[39:29] the Lord is the joy of the Lord this
[39:30] place it may not seem like much this
[39:32] Gathering May pale in comparison to
[39:34] others but this is the joy of the Lord
[39:38] and the joy of the Lord is the joy of
[39:40] his people he wants you to come to
[39:42] church and worship him and be happy and
[39:45] satisfied giving praise and honor and
[39:48] glory and wisdom and might and power to
[39:51] God he wants you to do that
[39:54] so God bless you here towards the end of
[39:56] this year those who've persevered who
[39:58] are making these Services God bless you
[40:00] your joy is the Lord's Joy this is a joy
[40:04] to us to be here
[40:06] I don't often do this but I'll say God
[40:09] bless brother Eli and sister Kendall who
[40:12] drive from Tucson on Wednesday nights
[40:14] round trip
[40:16] and would they do this if this was a
[40:18] chore no but there's a joy in it
[40:21] and I I think of just how how the kind
[40:24] of character their children are going to
[40:26] have when their parents willing to make
[40:28] sacrifices like that and through traffic
[40:30] and through hours and working long days
[40:33] why this is the joy of the Lord the
[40:35] house of Lord is a joiner and think
[40:37] about happy and makes God
[40:40] because the joy of the Lord is the joy
[40:41] of his people
[40:42] and he wants to see us making this
[40:44] effort he wants us to see us rejoice in
[40:46] the right things
[40:48] I hope no one feels cited that I would
[40:51] call a name any particular family
[40:54] maybe I'll try to name you all before
[40:55] next year's over
[41:00] in Psalms 27 verses 1 to 6.
[41:03] how many know where the sermon that
[41:05] brother Branham took Psalms 27 1-5 in
[41:08] the rapture
[41:09] and he said many people many preachers
[41:11] would go down the main Avenues go down
[41:13] certain Avenues and take the real
[41:15] obvious scriptures and brother bam kind
[41:16] of gets to the more obvious ones later
[41:17] but as a prophet he said he's directed
[41:21] to a prophecy of the Rapture in Psalms
[41:23] 27 and he takes an unorthodox text but
[41:26] when you begin to read it it's
[41:27] everything Christ is in this Rapture
[41:30] cycle in the first characteristic of
[41:33] Christ psalms 27 1 the Lord is my light
[41:36] and my salvation
[41:38] this is what he becomes he's the light
[41:40] he's that word that comes to us say open
[41:41] the shield seals that's why Brethren
[41:43] says there's a man here can turn on the
[41:44] light Shalom it is the rising of the Sun
[41:47] the Lord is my light and my salvation
[41:49] again in this Rapture Exodus time in the
[41:51] Third Exodus I will rejoice in the Lord
[41:53] he is my strength and my song and is
[41:55] become my salvation Whom Shall I Fear
[41:59] the Lord is the strength of my life of
[42:01] whom shall I be afraid when the wicked
[42:03] even mine enemies and my foes Came Upon
[42:05] me to what eat up my flesh they stumbled
[42:07] and fell is it not describing death
[42:10] itself
[42:12] though the whole shouldn't Camp against
[42:13] me my heart shall not fear the war
[42:15] should rise against me and this will I
[42:17] be confident one thing have I desired of
[42:19] the Lord that will I seek after and this
[42:21] is what he wanted that I may dwell in
[42:22] the house of the Lord all the days of my
[42:24] life
[42:24] but he didn't just want to be in the
[42:26] house empty all by himself to behold the
[42:28] beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his
[42:31] Temple he wanted to be in his presence
[42:34] and so for in the time of trouble which
[42:36] is the characteristic of this time this
[42:38] day we're living from the time of time
[42:40] of trouble he shall hide me in his
[42:41] Pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle
[42:44] shall he hide me in Psalms 31 20 The
[42:47] Pavilion is the secret and the secret of
[42:49] thy presence from The Strife of tongues
[42:51] from the pride of men that is what David
[42:53] is seeking I want to be in his presence
[42:55] in a time of trouble if I could just be
[42:57] hid in his presence that's where my
[42:59] safety is
[43:01] for man shall be a hiding place the
[43:03] Bible tells us
[43:05] he will hide me in the secret of his
[43:06] Tabernacle
[43:08] he shall set me up upon a rock the
[43:10] Rapture is a revelation
[43:11] and now he says in verse 6 and now shall
[43:14] my head be lifted up above my enemies
[43:17] round about me
[43:18] therefore will I offer in his Tabernacle
[43:22] sacrifices of joy
[43:25] I will sing yea I will sing praises unto
[43:29] the Lord God
[43:30] why because this his presence in this
[43:33] time of trouble is what lifts your head
[43:35] up above your enemies you're in the
[43:36] presence of your enemies but you're
[43:38] feasting in the presence of your enemies
[43:40] a table he's prepared for you in the
[43:43] presence of your enemies
[43:45] in Psalms 118 14 and 15 the Lord is my
[43:48] strength and song and has become my
[43:50] salvation kind of mirroring there in
[43:52] Exodus 15 the voice of rejoice and in
[43:55] Salvation is in the Tabernacles of the
[43:57] righteous the right hand of the Lord
[43:58] doeth valiantly
[44:00] was this is the strength and salvation
[44:02] of Psalms 27 and because he is your
[44:04] hiding place the Lord is my light and
[44:06] salvation he's the strength of my life
[44:08] therefore there's the voice of rejoicing
[44:10] therefore their sacrifices of Joy
[44:12] therefore I sing I will sing praises
[44:14] unto the Lord
[44:18] I believe his presence is with us
[44:21] something that would promise for
[44:22] thousands of years coming to pass
[44:25] then brother Brown and the sermon the
[44:27] presence of God unrecognized there's a
[44:28] theme that you could look into more
[44:29] deeply he said if we could only realize
[44:31] that he is appearing to us in these
[44:33] meetings I love this phrase is everybody
[44:35] with us
[44:36] you follow me guys
[44:38] I said he says this he says he is
[44:40] appearing
[44:41] to us in these meetings this is June 18
[44:43] 1964 all that summer of 64. he says for
[44:47] one purpose
[44:48] that is to release our desires that we
[44:51] have in him to us
[44:56] to release the desires that we have in
[44:58] him to us
[45:01] a deep calling to The Deep a thirst a
[45:03] hunger maybe even ones you don't even
[45:05] know about brother man talked about in
[45:06] Christ the mystery why do you hunger why
[45:08] do you thirst there may be things that
[45:09] we're craving there may be some sense of
[45:11] dissatisfaction may seem some sort of
[45:13] incompleteness and there's always this
[45:15] longing and that doesn't satisfy this
[45:16] doesn't satisfy and I never get any
[45:18] traction with this and why is it then
[45:20] that we sense his presence why is it
[45:22] that we see the Fingerprints of God in
[45:24] our lives and we know he's with us and
[45:26] he's performing Miracles but yet
[45:27] something just isn't quite clicking
[45:29] because what he wants to do is to
[45:31] release the desires that we have in him
[45:34] that are hidden in him our real desire
[45:37] our real hungry and our real Joy he
[45:39] wants to release it to us
[45:42] praise the Lord
[45:44] but we've got to recognize his presence
[45:46] he says
[45:47] but we've got to recognize his presence
[45:49] and now how to recognize his presence is
[45:52] when the promised word for this age is
[45:54] made manifest not the promised word of
[45:56] Moses age or any other ages the promised
[45:59] word of this the promise of the word for
[46:01] this age
[46:03] this is the gift
[46:05] this is what we're rejoicing in
[46:07] it's his presence
[46:09] he says he wants to release the desires
[46:12] that we have in him to us do you notice
[46:14] the way he says it I realize that even
[46:16] the way he says it's kind of like it's
[46:18] almost uh not cryptic but like there's
[46:21] just something there he says in such a
[46:22] unique way but it's as if there's
[46:25] Desires in him
[46:27] that he wants to release to us
[46:29] but if we never get past the veneer we
[46:31] never get past the surface we only get
[46:33] caught up in the the Dynamics of a
[46:35] wonderful worship service or or all
[46:37] these other things if we don't recognize
[46:39] his presence and not just the moving of
[46:41] God but the word promise for today then
[46:44] the desires that we that are in him that
[46:47] we could receive aren't going to be
[46:48] released to us
[46:49] so if he could recognize his presence
[46:51] that's when our joy is satisfied that's
[46:54] when the pleasures are released to us
[46:56] that's when we can celebrate
[46:59] we recognize his presence
[47:01] and I believe that in this hour there's
[47:03] a prophetic dispensation that we're
[47:04] living in wherein Christ has become our
[47:07] salvation
[47:10] we're going to preach on the subject of
[47:11] rewards he appeared to Abraham and said
[47:14] I am exceeding great reward
[47:17] my interest isn't in the
[47:20] the rewards that he can give me as even
[47:22] we say well I don't want the healing I
[47:24] want the Healer
[47:25] I there's things wow you could just
[47:28] start thinking along those lines of all
[47:30] these things just the gifts the gifts
[47:31] the gifts and we say we want the Gift
[47:32] Giver and there's things that the
[47:34] baptism the Holy Ghost does that we must
[47:35] have but it makes way for the Holy Ghost
[47:37] itself
[47:39] and there's the gifts of the Holy Ghost
[47:41] and there's gifts that he sends and
[47:43] gifts that he brings even prophetic
[47:45] gifts and Ministries and Messengers and
[47:47] angels and stars but they point to
[47:49] ultimately it's that cycle the major and
[47:52] a minor and a minor will always lead you
[47:54] back to the major which is Christ we've
[47:56] got to be recognizing Christ in his
[47:59] season and all arriving back to him and
[48:01] say this is the gift itself
[48:05] not just gifts that his presence will
[48:07] bring
[48:08] but his presence itself
[48:11] this is what the Bride Can rejoice in I
[48:13] can say because her promise in the end
[48:15] time it's here we're in that season of
[48:17] salvation
[48:18] it says in Psalm 16 11 that will show me
[48:21] the path of Life think about the
[48:23] language that's being used
[48:25] show me the path of life
[48:27] and in thy presence
[48:31] is the fullness of joy
[48:34] in thy presence is the fullness of joy
[48:36] at thy right hand there are Pleasures
[48:38] forevermore
[48:40] brother Bram says he's wanting to
[48:41] release our desires that we have in him
[48:43] to us where are we going to get him at
[48:45] his right hand
[48:46] because that's where the pleasures are
[48:47] that's where the desires are as I said
[48:49] that the right hand of the Lord doeth
[48:51] valently
[48:52] at his right hand or Pleasures
[48:54] forevermore brother Brahman in the
[48:55] sermon then Jesus came and called he
[48:56] says what is the right hand
[48:58] not a hand like man or mine it's the
[49:00] power the right hand of power
[49:03] he is God With Us God in us
[49:06] God here now the right hand ever living
[49:09] present right here when you need God you
[49:11] don't have to go to heaven
[49:16] he's right here with you
[49:18] when you need God you don't even have to
[49:20] go to church
[49:22] you don't have to go to a convention
[49:24] he says he's right here with you he's
[49:26] God in us right hand ever living present
[49:29] right here this is the full reality that
[49:32] we want to walk in this present tense
[49:33] Christ
[49:35] not watered down not filtered not
[49:37] withheld not restrained but to believe
[49:39] every promise of God in the scriptures
[49:41] for us he's right here with you
[49:47] and the sermon excuse me in Matthew
[49:49] chapter 9 we're just closing this is my
[49:51] last scripture I have a couple of
[49:52] quotations to read to you
[49:54] but they came to John
[49:57] in John chapter 3 questioning him
[50:00] it's funny just how difficult John's
[50:02] disciples were having
[50:04] the difficulty are having in recognizing
[50:06] Christ but in Matthew chapter 9 verses
[50:08] 14 and 50 says then came to him the
[50:09] Disciples of John saying why do we in
[50:12] the Pharisees fast oft but the disciples
[50:15] fast not
[50:16] why is it we've got more signs and
[50:18] wonders why is it we do more miracles
[50:20] why is it that we're more religious why
[50:21] is it that we're more strict and the
[50:23] disciples don't
[50:24] and or he says and he says and Jesus
[50:27] said unto them
[50:30] because they're I I find it interesting
[50:32] I do want to expound upon this later but
[50:34] the Disciples of John are questioning
[50:37] the Vindication of John's Ministry
[50:41] says and Jesus said unto them can the
[50:43] children of the Bride chamber mourn
[50:45] as long as the bridegroom is with them
[50:49] if we have if we're in the presence of
[50:51] the king if we are in the presence of
[50:54] the word that was promised in this time
[50:55] not not we've got to recognize the
[50:57] promise for today if there's another
[50:58] promise if there's another appearance if
[51:00] there's another coming if there's
[51:01] another happening let me put it this way
[51:03] if there's a meeting in the air you're
[51:05] going to be there but you want to be
[51:06] walking in the shout you want to be
[51:08] walking in the voice in order to be of
[51:10] the Trump that brings you to the meeting
[51:11] the air
[51:12] he says how can we mourn how can the
[51:15] children of the Bride chamber mourn when
[51:17] the bridegroom is with them again
[51:19] another use of the knowledge of the
[51:20] marriage how can we as his bride mourn
[51:23] when we are in the presence of our
[51:25] bridegroom this is not our season of
[51:27] mourning this is not our season of
[51:29] weeping oh I know there's a way that we
[51:31] want to kind of uh beat ourselves up and
[51:33] Woe Is man this is so weary and this is
[51:35] so hard and trust me we feel it and it
[51:38] is but oh if we could get our eyes on
[51:40] Christ and realize that in the midst of
[51:42] all the darkness he's still making
[51:44] himself known do we not can we not
[51:46] testify as a church just look back of
[51:49] the last 11 months can we not testify to
[51:51] the goodness of God
[51:55] being cancer-free
[51:57] right
[52:01] my my aunt who is in stage four uterine
[52:05] cancer
[52:06] sent a testimony cancer free
[52:09] God's moving in many many ways declaring
[52:12] himself the same God that he's always
[52:14] been and and he wants to release he
[52:17] wants our faith to rise to receive him
[52:19] and for who he is in this hour
[52:23] why should we mourn why should we start
[52:24] we should we be sorrowful
[52:27] and the sermon why it had to be Shepherd
[52:31] I I was wishing earlier this week that I
[52:33] had the time to write all right out just
[52:36] the testimonies that we could express
[52:39] of the prayers that have been answered
[52:41] in this church alone
[52:44] God is working miracles
[52:46] [Music]
[52:47] he's present with us
[52:50] and why it had to be Shepherd
[52:52] again this these prayers he prays at the
[52:54] end of these Christmas sermons are so
[52:56] phenomenal receive this Lord
[52:58] we receive your Christmas gift
[53:01] the Messiah
[53:03] the anointed word that vindicates your
[53:06] presence with this Lord
[53:08] regardless of Creator denomination
[53:13] that's it
[53:15] if anybody asks you who Jesus Christ is
[53:17] he's the Living Word that makes God
[53:20] present
[53:21] that's who he is
[53:23] we received the Messiah the anointed
[53:25] word that vindicates your present with
[53:26] presence with this Lord we find
[53:28] ourselves today the world Fallen apart
[53:30] and here the great Messiah stands with
[53:32] his hands outstretched
[53:34] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[53:36] and forever that made the promise that
[53:39] in this last days the church would be so
[53:41] organized to go into laodicea and we see
[53:44] it today Lord what can we do dear God
[53:46] what can I do
[53:48] this is this this quote here is just
[53:50] it's my Christmas quote this year he
[53:52] says help me and these other Shepherds
[53:54] Lord around the world Shepherds of the
[53:56] word to Proclaim it Lord in this next
[53:58] year
[53:59] let's pray that for me let's pray that
[54:01] for us this church here sends out a
[54:04] number of ministers from here there's
[54:06] four other ministers that are sent out
[54:07] preaching all over in Mexico and all
[54:10] over North America and even going
[54:11] overseas may that be the prayer for the
[54:14] ministry here may that be our prayer for
[54:15] Ministries everywhere forgot to question
[54:17] brother Andrew brother Elias palangio
[54:19] they're the pastor in Arusha Tanzania
[54:21] very very sick does a tremendous work in
[54:24] labor and getting the message out on
[54:25] those regions and I pray God would heal
[54:27] him just so miraculously that he'd see
[54:30] it's the hand of God touched him but my
[54:32] prayer for him and and for all the
[54:34] Shepherds and for us as a church to
[54:36] Proclaim it
[54:38] to proclaim the present Messiah who
[54:41] stands with hands outstretch Jesus
[54:42] Christ the same yesterday today and
[54:44] forever
[54:46] and he says wait let us Proclaim it help
[54:48] us Lord we pray give us thy love oh
[54:50] we've got to have that first and thy
[54:52] spirit and thy light we dedicate
[54:55] ourselves tonight to Thy word and to thy
[54:56] call tonight and let it be that our
[54:59] prayer as this is my last sermon with
[55:01] you together this year let us dedicate
[55:03] ourselves tonight to Thy word and to his
[55:06] call
[55:08] he says in Jesus Christ's name we
[55:09] receive your Christmas gift
[55:12] can we read it with me the word of God
[55:15] made flesh in US
[55:17] amen
[55:20] what a gift
[55:22] give us your love Lord give us your
[55:24] spirit give us your light and let's
[55:25] dedicate ourselves to his word into his
[55:27] call and receive his Christmas gift the
[55:31] word made flesh in US
[55:34] because you're the reflection of the
[55:36] message of the hour
[55:41] foreign
[55:43] if you've got good eyesight
[55:46] this is it
[55:48] and if I don't feel good at the end of
[55:49] this
[55:51] I've got all this
[55:54] and there's places I've studied in this
[55:55] Bible that I'm convinced I could preach
[55:57] series on if I found myself somewhere
[55:59] and didn't have anything to go by just
[56:00] pick up this Bible and start with the
[56:02] book of Galatians
[56:06] I hope the kids brought pajamas
[56:08] if I don't feel good in a few minutes
[56:11] but the Providence of God to pick a
[56:14] quote like this up to end on
[56:16] I want you to focus with me now and
[56:18] think here how if you have to just
[56:21] concentrate don't go to sleep but
[56:23] concentrate by focusing your attention
[56:25] on it do I have the quote there from uh
[56:27] Shalom brother John did I put that in
[56:28] there the last one no okay good so you
[56:30] can just listen for it listen to what he
[56:33] says but brother bear says he says
[56:36] we are creatures of time
[56:39] he's the god of Eternity
[56:41] now you couldn't you couldn't come up
[56:43] with a greater contrast
[56:45] we're creatures of time he's the god of
[56:46] Eternity and listen to The Grace he's
[56:48] expressing to us this is the message
[56:50] Shalom right if it's within that theme
[56:52] but there's a man here can turn on the
[56:53] light and and those and those different
[56:55] themes he's preaching there right at the
[56:57] end of 63 the beginning of 64. and uh
[57:00] and this so we want to really focus in
[57:01] on what those themes would be we're
[57:03] creatures of time he's the god of
[57:05] Eternity and then he says this we try to
[57:07] press ourselves
[57:09] we try to make something different oh
[57:11] this has got to be done
[57:14] do we feel like that sometimes we're
[57:16] trying to press ourselves
[57:18] and I would say almost whatever it is
[57:21] getting certain things done and getting
[57:23] the gifts wrapped in time or buying this
[57:25] or doing that and making things look a
[57:26] certain way whatever it might be that
[57:28] we're trying to pressure that we got to
[57:29] get this done he says remember he knows
[57:31] all about it
[57:33] and I believe it's in our hearts maybe
[57:35] sometimes he's saying we're creatures of
[57:37] time he's the god of Eternity he's
[57:38] bringing that contrast we're Bound by
[57:40] time and distance and language but he's
[57:42] a god of Eternity and we think things
[57:43] just have to happen a certain way and
[57:45] we're trying to make something different
[57:46] or it has to be done a certain way he's
[57:48] telling us just relax
[57:49] he knows all about it it's going to
[57:52] happen anyhow
[57:54] let him do it
[57:56] just commit yourself to him
[58:00] and in any of these things that are
[58:02] preached it's not it's not something we
[58:04] got to work ourselves into it be
[58:05] something different he knows all about
[58:07] it it's going to happen let them do it
[58:09] just commit yourself to him and he says
[58:11] look up
[58:12] and shine with joy of the Lord
[58:15] to know that you've been privileged your
[58:17] eyes have come open and to see this day
[58:22] and that's what we ought to do he's a
[58:24] present tense God and we get all worried
[58:27] oh I'm just not sure what it's going to
[58:28] be like in the Millennium that's going
[58:29] to happen
[58:30] hey
[58:31] let's not lose our joy now about what is
[58:34] it going to be like in the Millennium no
[58:35] I there's let's look at the promise
[58:38] today and he says that we we look up and
[58:41] shine with the joy of the Lord to know
[58:43] what we've seen what our eyes have been
[58:45] opened up to today and then he says
[58:47] trust him for the future
[58:50] that's what we ought to do is just trust
[58:53] him for the future
[58:54] just radiate in the presence of the sun
[58:57] just Sparkle back with joy just as that
[59:00] Dew Drop in the morning begins to shake
[59:02] a little bit just like that bubbling
[59:04] brook that seems so happy why are you so
[59:06] happy because something is driving me
[59:09] something is propelling me to be happy
[59:11] that Dew Drop is happy because there's a
[59:14] sunlight that is beaming upon it and
[59:16] then he says trust him for the future
[59:21] you've seen him vindicate his word in
[59:24] days past
[59:25] he that Vindicated his word in days past
[59:28] and made all these things other things
[59:30] happened just exactly to the hour that
[59:32] we're living in everything exactly to
[59:34] the seventh Angel's message both showed
[59:36] it in heaven on Earth and made it known
[59:38] their three ways so there can't be no
[59:39] slip up
[59:41] remember
[59:43] he promised he'd come again
[59:45] Hallelujah
[59:47] that word will be a Vindicated
[59:49] God's promised word with 2 000 years of
[59:52] waiting he will arrive on time
[59:56] don't try to press yourself and make
[59:57] yourself something different
[59:59] just commit yourself to him
[1:00:01] and shine with the joy of the Lord
[1:00:03] rejoicing in what he's allowed your eyes
[1:00:04] to see and he says don't be weary
[1:00:08] he'll be here
[1:00:10] as he has Vindicated his word in every
[1:00:12] age the church ages show the same thing
[1:00:14] and the revealing of Our Lord by the
[1:00:16] seventh message and so forth God
[1:00:18] revealed it manifested it and proved it
[1:00:21] and in among us today
[1:00:24] he showed himself here with us improved
[1:00:27] and Vindicated his word
[1:00:29] so will he
[1:00:31] what will he do prove his word vindicate
[1:00:34] his word so what we need to do is just
[1:00:36] commit ourselves to him trust him for
[1:00:38] the future and shine
[1:00:41] with the joy of our salvation
