[0:00] continuing on the subject of the house
[0:01] of the Lord I want to I know there's a
[0:03] lot of things we've already talked about
[0:04] that we could rehearse that we could
[0:07] emphasize but we're looking at the a
[0:10] place where the Lord has preeminence
[0:11] we've even wanted to use it in the sense
[0:13] that we want to make our hearts his home
[0:16] that our goal isn't so much just to make
[0:18] it to heaven but that we could have
[0:19] Heaven here on Earth according to the
[0:21] word and the house of the Lord is a
[0:24] place not only where he dwells but it's
[0:25] a place where he is welcome a place
[0:28] where there's peace and justice and
[0:30] tonight we're going to do another part
[0:32] on A House Divided is no home and so
[0:35] hopefully we can just go over this very
[0:37] quickly and we could maybe ask the
[0:39] question this way what makes a house a
[0:41] home to where it's not just simply a
[0:43] dwelling you could have a place where
[0:44] you live uh a place where you keep your
[0:47] belongings a place that you return at
[0:49] the end of an evening I remember there
[0:50] was at one time we were traveling so
[0:52] much that we realized maybe our youngest
[0:54] didn't know what where home was and uh
[0:57] you stay in a hotel a few nights you go
[0:59] on to the next one and sometimes we had
[1:01] Extended Stays and I remember one time I
[1:03] can't remember if we were still on the
[1:04] road and traveling but Jack asked the
[1:06] question mom do you remember that white
[1:08] house and we thought maybe it was
[1:09] referring to the one in DC because we
[1:11] had toured that but after a little bit
[1:13] more imploring he goes no the one in
[1:15] Texas he said where I had my own bed and
[1:18] um and so this was I think this is
[1:20] before we had even moved so there's this
[1:23] sense of uh a place where you keep your
[1:25] belongings and you have your own bed but
[1:27] it's more than just a place where you
[1:28] keep your possessions we're talking
[1:30] about what makes a house a home and
[1:33] Jesus touches on a very remarkable
[1:35] characteristic of what I'm trying to
[1:37] point out in the house of the Lord and
[1:39] even our own individual lives as
[1:41] individuals Our Lives as family our
[1:43] lives as church family says in verse 25
[1:46] and if a house be divided against itself
[1:50] that house cannot stand we looked in the
[1:52] word and we saw that house could refer
[1:54] to a residence it can refer to a temple
[1:56] a church a gathering a building where
[1:58] people gather it can also refer to the
[2:00] human body and it refers to a household
[2:03] or family so you can say the house of
[2:05] meiri and and it wouldn't just refer to
[2:07] a physical address that they own but you
[2:09] might just think of the whole family and
[2:10] you see that in the scripture where a
[2:12] house house kind of invokes a family or
[2:14] a household and we were taking we could
[2:17] even point back to the Gates of Heaven
[2:20] and how that the church and the the your
[2:22] house where you live and your body these
[2:24] are all uh Gates where God should be
[2:27] welcome points of interaction with the
[2:29] super natural even to where as Jacob
[2:32] viewed it you don't have to have heaven
[2:34] in your heart but others could come to a
[2:36] place where Heaven is and it's through
[2:38] those Gates or through those entrances
[2:39] or those contact points with the
[2:42] Supernatural and as we're looking at
[2:43] even this verse here that A house
[2:45] divided against itself cannot stand I'm
[2:47] hoping that you're making an effort uh
[2:50] to apply it to yourself that you're
[2:52] making it personal and that you look at
[2:54] it on a more than just one layer uh I
[2:57] know that maybe a phrase that we like to
[2:59] use some times maybe not myself but
[3:00] others that there's layers of complexity
[3:03] and there's different Vantage points and
[3:05] sometimes we're only looking at it
[3:06] through one slice only from one angle
[3:08] but to every in any way that you can
[3:10] make it practical and personal to you I
[3:13] invite you to let the Holy Spirit do
[3:14] that for you a house whether we talk
[3:17] about you as an individual your your
[3:19] family home or your the place that you
[3:21] dwell or the church if it be divided
[3:25] against itself that's separated into
[3:27] groups or factions but it's not just
[3:30] separation but it's separate into groups
[3:32] that are against each other divided
[3:35] against itself so it's one thing to
[3:36] cause a separation and somebody just say
[3:39] hey I'm leaving I'm out of here or I'm
[3:41] I'm I'm gone or whatever it might be and
[3:43] I hope you could kind of just
[3:44] conceptualize this it's one thing to be
[3:46] separated but it's one thing to be
[3:48] standing shoulder to- shoulder United
[3:50] together as one and then separate and
[3:52] not just separate but turn against each
[3:54] other so it's not just uh things
[3:56] separating uh and well we've just moved
[3:59] on but there's kind of this uh uh
[4:01] combativeness or this competitiveness
[4:03] where there's a separation against each
[4:06] other and any time a house is turned
[4:09] against itself inwardly that house
[4:12] cannot stand and there's a lot of Rich
[4:15] meaning to that word cannot stand it's
[4:17] unable to be established it cannot be
[4:20] placed it cannot grow brother Bram
[4:23] teaches us the word in in the right kind
[4:25] of ground will produce it'll grow and so
[4:27] you have to have the word in its season
[4:29] in the right place and if you're not if
[4:32] you're divided a home that's divided an
[4:34] individual that's divided cannot be
[4:36] spiritually placed cannot mature cannot
[4:39] grow there's a lot of things there that
[4:40] we hope that you can uh uh
[4:43] conceptualize and then there is uh and
[4:46] looking at this A House Divided is no
[4:49] home so we're kind of wanting to Define
[4:50] what home is a home requires certain
[4:54] characteristics and this is kind of
[4:56] where we're trying to do the quick
[4:57] review and then we're just going to jump
[4:58] right almost in our notes exactly where
[5:00] we were on Sunday where we begin to skip
[5:02] a little bit brother Bram said a house
[5:04] it's not the uh building that makes it
[5:06] what it is he says the characteristic of
[5:08] it I'm just going to go through this
[5:10] very
[5:13] quickly he says a home isn't the house
[5:15] you live in it's the order of the house
[5:17] that's what makes a home and another
[5:19] place again we've read these
[5:20] already the home is a order of the house
[5:23] you see the order that's in it order of
[5:26] the family so the it's the
[5:28] characteristic of it when he says what I
[5:30] mean by characteristic it's the order
[5:32] the order in the house is what makes it
[5:34] a home he repeats it again in another
[5:35] place and it's the order of the family
[5:38] so he's not just referring to how the
[5:39] furniture is arranged he's not just
[5:41] talking about kind of a schedule
[5:43] throughout the day he's talking about
[5:44] the family how's the family re arranged
[5:47] one to another and if you'll kind of
[5:50] welcome that thought in your mind and
[5:52] think oh how's the family arranged
[5:53] together I I I know there might be some
[5:56] instinct to think well you've got the
[5:57] the man of the house and it's his domain
[5:59] and it's his castle and everyone else is
[6:01] just there to make him happy that's not
[6:02] what brother Bam's talking about and and
[6:05] whatsoever he says it's the character on
[6:07] the inside that makes a home so there
[6:10] got to be the right kind of character
[6:12] and if I could say this kind of
[6:14] piggybacking on our knowledge of what it
[6:15] takes to receive character character is
[6:17] a victory not a gift so no home has the
[6:20] right kind of order and character by
[6:21] gift but by suffering by effort and by
[6:24] labor it's not just going to come
[6:26] naturally but it really comes
[6:28] supernaturally when we take the word of
[6:30] God we're willing to suffer because
[6:31] we're going to obey the Lord we're going
[6:33] to sacrifice and we're going to be
[6:34] proactive there's a lot of effort that
[6:36] goes into it and there may be some rough
[6:37] spots but what we're doing is we're
[6:39] building character within the home uh
[6:42] through that discipline and through that
[6:43] sensitivity to the things that make a
[6:45] house a home so we could summarize in
[6:49] many different places where brother B
[6:50] said it's the order that makes the house
[6:52] a
[6:53] home uh a family's known by its order
[6:57] you could say well that family's this
[6:58] way that family that way and I know
[7:00] maybe you've said it before and maybe
[7:01] you've interacted with somebody I think
[7:03] it's uh maybe we've noted it in the
[7:05] family that lives in the apartment next
[7:06] door that we know the the wife is the
[7:08] one that runs that family have you ever
[7:10] said that we know who wears the pants in
[7:12] that family or oh those kids control
[7:14] that family why because uh it's whatever
[7:16] the kids need the family just uh they do
[7:19] it and and they're willing to even
[7:21] sometimes comprom compromise the word of
[7:23] God and their excuse is the kids or
[7:25] their kids need this or their kids need
[7:27] that and so sometimes we have a we have
[7:29] a way of defining a family and it's it's
[7:31] instinctual and maybe it's just our
[7:33] perception the way we observe but it's
[7:35] true that a family is known by its order
[7:39] right and brother Brandon saying it so
[7:41] much I think this emphasis invites us to
[7:44] dive into what order is I want to say
[7:47] it's order it's order it's order uh we
[7:50] we want to it invites us to kind of look
[7:51] into what this order
[7:53] means and there's a couple ways that you
[7:56] could Define order and I think they
[7:57] still give the same uh uh image or
[8:01] expression order is the arrangement of
[8:04] people or things in relation to each
[8:06] other according to a particular sequence
[8:09] pattern or method so it's the
[8:10] disposition of people or things in
[8:12] relation to each other it's probably the
[8:13] most important part there uh it's in
[8:16] relation to other things an order has to
[8:18] have some sort of relationship the
[8:20] arrangement of people in relation to
[8:23] each other According to some pattern
[8:25] method or sequence so we may all have
[8:28] some order but what have we made our
[8:30] pattern what what have we used to order
[8:33] ourselves are we just merely looking at
[8:35] some sort of Optics or we looking at
[8:37] some something that serves a particular
[8:39] agenda and so the arrangement of people
[8:42] in relation to each other According to
[8:44] some method or pattern would be a really
[8:46] good way of looking at it some of the
[8:48] synonyms that might be used for this
[8:49] order is sequence Arrangement
[8:51] organization disposition structure a
[8:55] system series or secession these are
[8:57] things to think about that you could
[8:58] only almost plug into what brother
[9:00] bradam says where a home isn't the house
[9:02] you live in it's the arrangement of the
[9:04] house it's the disposition the structure
[9:06] the system the the the the the
[9:08] organization of the house these are the
[9:10] things that he's looking at and so when
[9:12] we say a house is divided we can make
[9:15] the comment uh that maybe that's anti to
[9:18] these synonyms A House Divided is a
[9:20] disorganized house uh I'm not talking
[9:22] about how clean clean it is yet a house
[9:25] can be uh defined by its cleanliness
[9:29] some of you may be like this I don't
[9:30] mind a hearty amen if this is true but
[9:32] some of you may not be able to get
[9:33] anything else done until you have a
[9:35] clean room or the floors picked up or
[9:37] the clothes have to be folded and I was
[9:39] that way especially in law school I I
[9:41] could be in the law school library
[9:43] trying to study and if I knew I had a
[9:44] messy room back home I couldn't study it
[9:47] was like the room had to be clean there
[9:48] had to be some order and I think a lot
[9:51] of people could relate to that so a
[9:52] house that's divided is a house that is
[9:55] out of sequence to some pattern it's
[9:59] disorganized According to some system of
[10:01] structure now we're uh we're Christians
[10:04] tonight we're message Believers so we
[10:06] know what this system would be we we
[10:08] have an idea of what how we'd want to be
[10:10] arranged we we we sing order my steps in
[10:12] your word so and there's been a there's
[10:14] a lot of good preaching that you hear
[10:16] quite frequently and I'm not just I'm
[10:18] I'm not referring to myself at all I'm
[10:20] thinking about the services that I
[10:21] enjoyed while I was gone that are giving
[10:24] us the this pattern in God's word to
[10:26] live
[10:27] by and there so it's a system of parts
[10:30] that are subject to some uniform uh Rank
[10:33] and proportion this is where this
[10:35] belongs and this uh is what it is in
[10:38] relation to this other part so it's a
[10:39] system of things working together
[10:42] uniformly in some sort of established uh
[10:44] uh position and some sort of established
[10:47] relationship or
[10:49] parameters and and when we speak of a
[10:51] sequence or we think of that kind of uh
[10:54] order we're not thinking top down we're
[10:56] just thinking more in relationship to
[10:58] each other and that's a very important
[10:59] part of order now there is a way that we
[11:02] could look at order as an authoritative
[11:05] command um direction or instruction so
[11:08] you give an order and that order is to
[11:11] be followed and in that sometimes we can
[11:14] create an order or sequence that has
[11:17] something that is we're we're looking at
[11:19] it more be more top down and I'm very I
[11:21] guess I kind of find myself being very
[11:23] deliberate how I describe this when we
[11:25] come to this place cuz we know that
[11:26] there's a head Christ is the head of all
[11:28] things things and the head of Christ is
[11:31] God and the head of the man is Christ
[11:32] and so we see that there's rankings and
[11:35] arrangements and with there there can be
[11:37] an order that's a command or direction
[11:39] or instruction so there can be an order
[11:42] that refers to a group of people or a
[11:45] body of persons that are living under
[11:47] some discipline the order of nuns or the
[11:50] the order of this or the order of that
[11:52] and and so there could be some way of
[11:54] looking at something as an order it's an
[11:56] arrangement it's a this it kind of comes
[11:59] from that meaning a position or an
[12:00] estate a rule or regulation is what
[12:02] we're looking at and this is when
[12:05] brother say it's the order of the house
[12:06] it's the order of the family what
[12:08] command do they follow what instructions
[12:10] are they Guided
[12:12] by what kind of discipline do they form
[12:14] and gather themselves around that makes
[12:16] it what it is and now in looking at the
[12:19] atmology of the word order as I was
[12:22] studying it uh quite a bit it comes from
[12:26] the the Latin as a row or line line and
[12:30] so if there's a row or line it starts to
[12:32] look as if a rank but it's more of a
[12:34] series or a pattern it's an arrangement
[12:36] this is the meaning of it's a
[12:38] routine now I'm kind of hearkening back
[12:41] to the very beginning of this series
[12:43] when we saw that the Tabernacle and the
[12:44] Wilderness and then later the temple had
[12:47] divisions but it's not a division but a
[12:50] union it's not divided in the sense that
[12:53] oh man the outer Court that's where you
[12:55] want to be cuz you can see the stars and
[12:58] uh uh oh no no the inner Court that's
[12:59] where you want to be because that's
[13:00] where you can do this and that no no no
[13:02] no the holy of holies like n only one
[13:03] guy can go there and you start ranking
[13:05] it and you start making it exclusive no
[13:07] it's it was all necessary it was not
[13:11] divided but there was distinctions
[13:13] because it had different roles different
[13:16] functions and different offices even in
[13:18] looking at the house of the Lord you
[13:19] found that the outer Court was necessary
[13:21] to be in the inner Court the inner Court
[13:22] was necessary to go to the holy of
[13:24] holies and you couldn't kick any one of
[13:25] them else out they kind of all worked
[13:28] together that's what God saw in the
[13:29] beginning that's that's how that he had
[13:31] arranged it and and as this relates to
[13:34] you as an individual or to your families
[13:36] or to the church ORD is necessary to
[13:38] function properly there has to be some
[13:41] sort of order Church order uh the church
[13:44] has given even government and structure
[13:45] as far as pastor and different offices
[13:48] and it's done so that there can be uh uh
[13:50] it can function properly we have a
[13:53] church order and we have an order of
[13:55] service and and that establishes
[13:56] expectations and that gives rise to
[13:58] roles and
[13:59] responsibilities and without there if
[14:01] there wasn't order that's where you get
[14:03] Strife you get contention you get chaos
[14:06] you have friction if there wasn't uh
[14:09] decision makers in in families if there
[14:11] wasn't decision makers in organizations
[14:13] if there wasn't uh uh something to go by
[14:15] or abide by that's what leads to
[14:16] infighting and that's what leads to
[14:18] friction and
[14:21] difficulty and I I want to Breeze past
[14:24] this hopefully very
[14:26] um uh in um
[14:30] I want it to be efficient but I want it
[14:32] to be sufficient as well in Romans chap
[14:35] 12:4 I want to look at this order says
[14:38] for for as we have many members in one
[14:40] body and all members have not the same
[14:42] office Paul's obviously teaching on a
[14:44] lot of things here in this particular
[14:45] passage and so he says we not we have
[14:48] many many members in one body now your
[14:50] body's that way your body has many
[14:52] members so there's this image of the
[14:54] human body then your family is that way
[14:57] a church is that way so the house the
[14:59] family the church even yourself uh he's
[15:01] using the human body these things
[15:04] operate the local church and even our
[15:06] families operate like the union of the
[15:09] human body and he says they don't all
[15:12] the members of one body don't have the
[15:15] same office in other words they don't
[15:16] have the same function they don't have
[15:18] the same work or undertaking they don't
[15:20] transact in the same same things they
[15:23] don't have the same
[15:26] abilities and and of course the I can
[15:29] say to the nose I see things better than
[15:32] you right did I say that right the eye
[15:34] can say to the nose I see better than
[15:35] you yeah I mean of course right and the
[15:38] nose could say well that wasn't hard to
[15:39] sniff out right because it's just it's
[15:42] obvious you have this ability I have
[15:43] that ability and everything works
[15:45] together and Paul goes to Great Links to
[15:47] say hey how can one part of the body say
[15:49] to the other and he kind of lifts up
[15:51] those uncomely parts to say man we all
[15:53] kind of work together because though
[15:55] we're different members and we have
[15:57] different functions these functions are
[15:59] all
[16:00] connected so what does he say in 1
[16:02] Corinthians 12 he says as he describes
[16:05] it's much larger teaching he says that
[16:06] there be no Schism in the body so again
[16:09] he's looking at how the human body
[16:11] functions and its different parts and
[16:13] its organs and its uh it's vast systems
[16:16] and how they all interrelate and work
[16:18] together and what we see even in your
[16:21] movements that you witness with me right
[16:23] now it's the working together of many
[16:25] different parts right and and even still
[16:29] I I don't know I kind of drawn into this
[16:30] that even when it comes to artificial
[16:33] intelligence a a and Robotics what are
[16:35] they trying to produce that symmetry of
[16:38] movement in a
[16:39] human right even in patterns of speaking
[16:43] that they can now they can replicate the
[16:45] voice but yet there's just something
[16:47] about how an individual a live voice can
[16:50] articulate and can function to where
[16:52] they're getting better and better so
[16:53] don't get me wrong I'm just trying to
[16:54] make a point uh that it it still has
[16:57] something that's missing even the robots
[16:59] man with uh uh is it I can't remember
[17:01] Boston Electronics or whatever Boston
[17:03] robotics or whatever boy these dogs and
[17:05] everything they're creating can do a lot
[17:07] of stuff but you even notice in its
[17:08] movement there's something about it
[17:10] where if I guess if you put um you know
[17:13] a uniform on it like yeah that's a robot
[17:16] it can jump higher than me it can run
[17:18] faster than me but yet you could tell
[17:20] it's not as
[17:21] graceful as I
[17:23] am but these they all these functions in
[17:26] the human body are connected a and Paul
[17:29] says it this way when he's writing to
[17:30] the Ephesians in Ephesians 4:16 that's
[17:33] my birthday for whom the whole body
[17:35] fitly joined together and compacted by
[17:38] that which every joint suppli I think
[17:40] this is just a huge
[17:42] mouthful from whom the whole body fitly
[17:45] joined together and compacted by that
[17:47] which every joint supplieth according to
[17:49] the effectual working and the measure of
[17:51] every part maketh increase of the body
[17:53] un the edifying itself in love and if I
[17:57] asked you what he was describing we
[17:59] would be tempted to say a paper
[18:02] clip because it is it is seems to be so
[18:05] complicated and so detailed and complex
[18:07] maybe better word to put it but yet he's
[18:09] talking about how the human body works
[18:12] together and Paul puts it in a language
[18:14] that maybe only he could have that the
[18:15] whole body is fitly joined together the
[18:18] word that he used there fitly joined
[18:20] together means to sew together it's been
[18:22] woven it's been sewn together in such a
[18:25] way towards one you look at a an
[18:27] individual garment you say oh well
[18:29] that's a suit or that's a shirt but all
[18:31] the individual fabrics and all the
[18:34] individual elements all kind of uh
[18:36] weaved together or sewn together to make
[18:38] something one and this word jointly fit
[18:41] together it is used it's applied to
[18:43] musical
[18:44] Harmony as we mentioned on Sunday
[18:47] several different instruments all
[18:48] playing different parts even sometimes
[18:50] reading in in uh they're reading from
[18:53] maybe individual Sheep
[18:55] music where sometimes and I you could
[18:58] recall this those of you who've played
[19:00] in these organized contexts that if you
[19:03] were to forget your music and you played
[19:04] the Trump oh man I forgot my music I'll
[19:07] just borrow it from the OBO
[19:09] player right you're looking at a
[19:12] different piece of music you can't just
[19:15] you can't just cheat off of somebody
[19:16] else so everyone has even something else
[19:18] that's been given to them and instructed
[19:20] them but the OBO wouldn't just say well
[19:23] just let me play I got this everything's
[19:25] working together so it's applied to
[19:26] musical Harmony every joint so or it's
[19:30] fitly joined
[19:33] together and I'm realizing here that
[19:35] maybe okay yeah that's right I I trimmed
[19:37] my notes up quite a bit I was like wait
[19:38] a minute what's happening I trimmed it
[19:40] up because there's diff beautiful
[19:42] meaning to compact in these different
[19:43] things but as it's it's uh fitly joined
[19:48] together and compacted I think that's
[19:49] important by by which every joint
[19:52] supplieth to the effectual working and
[19:54] every measure of every part maketh
[19:56] increase of the body and the edifying
[19:57] itself and love the the language speaks
[20:00] in this musical Harmony of the
[20:02] circulation of blood throughout the body
[20:05] and the nourishment of each part of the
[20:07] body to one
[20:09] another and as he says that the whole
[20:12] body and think about these different
[20:14] members the it's fitly joined together
[20:16] and compacted you think about the
[20:18] graceful movement of the foot could
[20:20] anybody imagine how graceful the foot
[20:22] moves I don't know if anyone here could
[20:24] imagine that but think about everything
[20:27] that works together the tendons the
[20:29] nerves the muscles and the bones and how
[20:32] they're all kind of sewn together and
[20:35] that's what allows the graceful movement
[20:37] do you want me to demonstrate the
[20:38] graceful movement of a foot brother
[20:40] Michael wow that's a vigorous knot up
[20:42] and
[20:42] down and how it moves gracefully right
[20:47] and you're and and there's something
[20:49] fluid to it and what does that how it's
[20:52] it's not just the foot in the sense oh
[20:55] that's just the foot but there's a joint
[20:57] there's bone structure there's muscle
[20:59] there's tendons there's cartilage
[21:00] there's all things that work together
[21:02] and all you need to do is just find that
[21:05] one thing's missing and one thing gets
[21:07] degraded or one thing gets impaired and
[21:10] all of a sudden a foot just do won't
[21:12] work
[21:13] anymore it doesn't function properly why
[21:16] because the function the graceful
[21:17] movement of that foot is relying upon a
[21:19] lot of things that make it what it
[21:22] is and then those joints those important
[21:26] uh places is he's using this fit joined
[21:28] together the joints become that point of
[21:30] Union from one piece to another and
[21:32] there at that joint there's a lot of
[21:33] pieces that go into that joint of
[21:35] cartilage and tendons and muscles and
[21:36] attachments and and that's how Paul's
[21:38] wanting us to think about the church our
[21:42] family and above all that the body of
[21:45] Christ so he says the body is fitly
[21:48] joined together and the Original Latin
[21:51] of the word order as it was used it was
[21:53] used as a row of threads in a
[21:55] loom so order is speaking to this
[21:58] weaving together it comes from the root
[22:00] or which means to arrange or the
[22:02] arrangement the source of it the or is
[22:04] to begin to
[22:06] weave to fit together to beautify to
[22:11] take one thing and weave it with another
[22:14] to produce something uh uh more
[22:16] beautiful or stronger the rows of thread
[22:18] and aloom as they they're woven together
[22:21] they fit
[22:22] together if anybody's if you want to
[22:26] just think a little bit about what we're
[22:27] I'm I'm considering here how I want us
[22:29] to think about it uh the brothers here
[22:33] if you to make this point just try to uh
[22:36] braid your daughter's hair or your
[22:37] wife's hair find out real quick that
[22:40] there's a way that things have to be
[22:41] done right there's a way of weaving it
[22:44] together it produces something beautiful
[22:46] and it's not just kind of twisting it
[22:48] and putting a rubber band on
[22:50] it and so the house must be woven
[22:54] together into a home just as God weaves
[22:57] together the the body of Christ just as
[22:59] God sews the body of Christ together in
[23:01] all parts fit together for the the
[23:03] supplementing and the nourishment of the
[23:05] whole and no one part is able to go H
[23:07] I'm more important than you that it's
[23:09] all sewn together to where it's one it's
[23:12] one the the the foot cannot say I'm not
[23:14] part of the human body and the head
[23:15] can't say well I am the human body it's
[23:17] like that's what makes it a body
[23:19] everything's been sewn together so when
[23:21] brother B's talking about order it's a
[23:24] mouthful brother talking about the order
[23:26] of the family it's not just being ble to
[23:28] establish some sort of rank where go in
[23:30] this family the the husband's the major
[23:32] general and everybody else is privates
[23:33] it's not a matter of just establishing
[23:35] it that way but it's an arrangement of
[23:37] the family members in relationship to
[23:40] each
[23:41] other so we've emphasized this a number
[23:44] of times especially when we're talking
[23:45] about uh the body of Christ and even the
[23:47] local church and how we work together
[23:49] it's not a
[23:50] hierarchy I think that when we talk
[23:52] about the head that establishes
[23:54] something maybe as H the head or the
[23:57] leader the guider The Protector the
[23:59] lifegiver and we recognize that Christ
[24:02] as our head and we recognize that in
[24:04] that spiritual sense but there's a way
[24:06] that we begin to take some of that
[24:08] language and we remove the life from it
[24:10] we Lo we lose the pattern of the
[24:12] scripture and it can definitely be
[24:14] something else that the scripture has
[24:16] not intended because we talk about the
[24:18] order of the family it's not just merely
[24:20] creating a top down structure or from
[24:22] the important to the
[24:24] least but it's how all the parts work
[24:26] together yes
[24:28] could you imagine just a man in his own
[24:30] home recognizing that he is not the head
[24:32] and he hasn't taken Authority he hasn't
[24:34] taken his place within the home because
[24:36] he's not uh he hasn't kind of stepped
[24:38] into that role as the protector and the
[24:40] provider and the head and he hasn't
[24:41] served in that capacity so he just wakes
[24:43] up one day and says this is my house I'm
[24:45] the head I got to take control so he
[24:47] just shows up says I'm the dictator I'm
[24:49] the boss everybody's going to do what
[24:50] I'm going to do and if you don't like it
[24:52] you got to get used to it and and just
[24:54] started ruling things that way and then
[24:56] he says hey I'm the head I've got to be
[24:58] the head and so just one by one
[24:59] everybody just said well see you later
[25:02] right and the the children leave one by
[25:05] one the wife leaves and finally he's
[25:06] like I did it Lord I did it I'm the
[25:10] master of this house I'm ruling it in
[25:13] all gravity and Authority I I finally
[25:15] found that place and position well you
[25:17] kind of that's not that wasn't the goal
[25:20] the goal wasn't you know just to produce
[25:23] HH um to produce you as the head at the
[25:26] expense of losing everything I know I've
[25:28] shared this before and I'll just repeat
[25:30] it I remember one time I was at lunch
[25:32] with my mom I at least went to lunch
[25:33] with her uh uh once a week if I could
[25:35] when I was in college and and I remember
[25:37] we went to lunch and we're sitting there
[25:39] eating and so I'm just a young man
[25:40] servant Lord probably early 20s or was
[25:42] was my early 20s she said yeah I've
[25:44] noticed Aon it's time for you to get
[25:46] married and of course I realized I'm
[25:49] glad
[25:50] somebody is
[25:53] recognizing these leadership abilities
[25:56] that I have in my and my w wisdom and
[25:58] and all I'm just thinking you know
[26:00] what I've been waiting for you to say
[26:02] this Mom right I mean this is an
[26:05] important moment for me and I'm
[26:07] like say on and she says it's time for
[26:10] you to find your own family to boss
[26:13] around Chips please right or check
[26:16] please who are you anyways I the reason
[26:19] why I remember it so well it's the last
[26:20] time I ever had lunch with my
[26:22] mom yet there's something about the fact
[26:25] that there's a way you can act where
[26:27] you're wanting to be the boss and
[26:28] there's other way where you just are
[26:30] that's what you are but it's not it's
[26:32] not acting as a dictator it's not acting
[26:34] as a boss and everyone else is a doormat
[26:36] underneath you and this is where I
[26:39] wanted to take over this presentation I
[26:41] I've referenced this a number of times
[26:43] you've heard the statement the low man
[26:44] on the totem
[26:46] pole and and in saying the low man on
[26:48] the totem pole we kind of mean the
[26:50] lowest rank the least important but if
[26:53] and and it's actually called the low man
[26:54] on the totem pole myth might well maybe
[26:56] that's just the way I describe describe
[26:57] it because it is somewhat of a myth as
[26:59] you study this are you able to see this
[27:01] okay uh it's somewhat of a myth uh
[27:04] because that's not how it's represented
[27:06] within this mythology or this religion
[27:08] or or within the Native American uh
[27:10] system is that the low man was worthless
[27:12] because what would happen if you took
[27:14] out the guy on the
[27:15] bottom it would topple this big great
[27:17] beautiful one on top and even what's
[27:20] unique about this one is this one here
[27:22] the lowest one on toble is kind of inval
[27:25] by the next level which holds up the
[27:27] next level and really the totem pole is
[27:30] what it is in total we call it a total
[27:32] pole no it is what it is totally working
[27:35] together the way it's arranged otherwise
[27:37] it would just be a statue but it's not
[27:39] to create a hierarchy where this this
[27:42] one is the greatest and this one's the
[27:45] least but they even kind of there's some
[27:47] conjecture but yet there's even some
[27:49] history on it that the smallest the one
[27:50] on the bottom rather not the smallest
[27:52] one about them sometimes was the biggest
[27:53] the grandest and considered the
[27:55] strongest because it's what supported
[27:57] everything else but in our language oh
[27:59] the high man on the totem pole the one
[28:01] that's on top and so we kind of get this
[28:03] idea this is the structure but if you
[28:06] were to take this idea in Native
[28:08] American culture you could even say that
[28:10] the real head is the one down
[28:13] here that's lifting up the rest of the
[28:15] family the husband's not saying wife you
[28:18] need to support me children you need to
[28:20] support me and that's what's created the
[28:22] order from the top down but maybe this
[28:24] is a good way of representing that there
[28:26] is an order but some sometimes the order
[28:28] is the strongest and the most able in
[28:31] the head is the one that's lifting and
[28:32] supporting everything
[28:34] else but but it establishes within this
[28:37] kind of nomenclature or mythology what
[28:40] we mean by an order where we're not just
[28:43] trying to create someone who's the
[28:45] dictator on
[28:47] top now does anybody remember what my my
[28:50] subject matter is A House Divided is no
[28:53] home so and we're talking about the
[28:56] order of the house so we're not just
[28:57] just trying to pay lip service to an
[29:00] order of husband wife children that's
[29:03] not going to work if it was just a
[29:04] matter of creating a relationship among
[29:06] those three elements then I mean you
[29:09] just get it naturally yeah but that's
[29:12] not what we're talking
[29:13] about anybody know what these are
[29:20] called am I missing something here did I
[29:22] go too
[29:23] far I may be missing a quote Oh well
[29:28] don't look yeah I am I'm going to come
[29:30] back to
[29:33] this brother bam says any man in his
[29:36] family a correct good Noble obedient
[29:39] family is one with
[29:42] another any family and if there's
[29:45] something in the family that moves them
[29:47] apart then it's not right the family's
[29:50] broken
[29:51] somewhere so in the moving apart That's
[29:55] A disruption of the order that we're
[29:56] talking about they should be one father
[29:57] with Mother Mother with father children
[29:59] with parent parent with children
[30:02] remember when brother bam said uh to the
[30:04] congregation submit yourself to the
[30:05] pastor Pastor submit yourself to the
[30:07] congregation Let's us all submit
[30:08] ourselves one to
[30:09] another if we are to submit ourselves
[30:12] one to another but one and how how do we
[30:15] submit ourselves one to another if
[30:16] there's always has to be one who's the
[30:18] greatest in that in that there there has
[30:20] to be someone on the top of the to totem
[30:22] pole that doesn't work so it has to mean
[30:25] something else he says all in agreement
[30:28] and when you see that you'll see the one
[30:31] lovely
[30:32] picture when you see the right kind of
[30:34] arrangement in order then you'll see
[30:37] that lovely picture that's God's purpose
[30:39] now brother John if you could go back to
[30:40] that first uh uh picture of the stairs
[30:43] there maybe I've given it away does
[30:45] anybody know what this is please
[30:47] somebody anybody pin row stairs there
[30:51] you go you knew it right knew it as
[30:53] we're talking about different parts
[30:54] arranged together when you look at this
[30:56] which one's up and which one's
[30:59] down which and it's this illusion in the
[31:02] sense to create this idea of and I think
[31:04] it's another way way it's called The
[31:06] Impossible stairs but when you look at
[31:07] it which is higher which is lower yeah
[31:12] and and this is the impossible triangle
[31:14] uh that they call it to where it's hard
[31:16] to tell which is which when looking at
[31:19] it and the way that it can be
[31:20] arranged where uh is one going up one's
[31:23] going down is one the lowest is one the
[31:25] highest and this is the way I'm want you
[31:27] to picture how we're arranged together
[31:30] in some ways maybe one is important in
[31:33] this area and another one's really
[31:35] important in this area unless we try to
[31:37] create just a top down we have to
[31:39] realize that maybe there's a way it
[31:41] works when sometimes it runs up
[31:43] sometimes it runs down sometimes this is
[31:45] needed sometimes that's needed and so
[31:48] just so you could demonstrate it to
[31:49] where you realize wow what is happening
[31:52] you think does it is it keeping is it
[31:54] still is it still going downstairs if
[31:56] it's still going downstairs how does it
[31:57] end up going back down to where it was
[32:00] before and so should we just read this
[32:02] quote
[32:04] again this is where I'm wanting you to
[32:07] think about this how things are arranged
[32:09] together and I'll put it this way there
[32:11] is a head and there is
[32:12] headship but it's the head because and
[32:16] it's the head and as the head it has a
[32:18] greater
[32:20] service not that it served
[32:24] greater let me ask you this do you serve
[32:27] Christ do you serve
[32:28] God do you serve him greater than he
[32:30] does
[32:34] you some might call that a nasty
[32:36] lawyer's
[32:38] trick but it's true think of it he that
[32:41] is greatest May became a
[32:44] servant that's that's what it means if
[32:47] in other words if you are the greatest
[32:48] in the Kingdom if you're the greatest in
[32:50] the house if you're the head is the
[32:52] terminology I want to use then you have
[32:54] the greater service and that's what
[32:55] makes you the greatest that what's why
[32:57] is it the head it's the lifegiver it's
[32:58] the protector it's the it's the thoughts
[33:00] it's the Warner without that you cut off
[33:02] the head anything else is just knee-jerk
[33:04] muscle movements for a short period of
[33:06] time before everything goes away so it's
[33:08] wanting to change the idea that the body
[33:10] exists to serve the head the head exists
[33:13] to serve and give the body its complete
[33:15] unity and function and so in some ways
[33:18] yes I'm challenging the men in their own
[33:20] individual lives the men and their
[33:22] families and even us men in this church
[33:24] that as the heads of families that we
[33:26] hold the greater responsibility to serve
[33:29] not be
[33:31] served brother Brandman doing God a
[33:33] service without it being being its will
[33:35] he talks about the order of the
[33:37] anointing and and how I could maybe draw
[33:40] from that it to emphasize this is It's
[33:43] think in terms of
[33:45] value think in terms of what is
[33:47] ultimately valued is it just power
[33:49] that's valued than a dictatorship a top
[33:52] down works if it's pretense if it's
[33:54] Pride I I if it's just popularity if
[33:57] it's position any other PW you want to
[33:58] throw in there if that's what it is then
[34:02] you can achieve that carnally yeah but
[34:05] miss the order of the anointing what's
[34:07] it what what's the ultimate what what do
[34:09] we what do we ultimate ultimately
[34:11] value now in Mark chapter 3:
[34:18] 27 I mean I really don't want to have to
[34:20] skip again but yeah here we are Mark
[34:23] chapter 3: 27 no man can enter into a
[34:27] strong man's house and spoil his Goods
[34:30] except he will first bind the strong man
[34:33] and then he will spoil his house I know
[34:36] that I've made my title and even my
[34:38] emphasis has revolved a lot around verse
[34:39] 25 A house divided against itself cannot
[34:42] stand but I think it's this verse that
[34:44] forms a a greater key and is a greater
[34:48] point of emphasis for me in looking at
[34:50] the house of the Lord and even this our
[34:53] homes and turning houses into homes this
[34:55] right here is a is the the key because
[34:57] this is his teaching Point built upon
[34:59] his
[35:00] Parables and no man can enter into a
[35:02] strong man's house and spoil his Goods
[35:04] Christ did not cast out Devils by being
[35:08] a part of the house and being be elub
[35:11] kicking something out but he entered
[35:13] into the house bound the strong men of
[35:15] the house that gave it house its
[35:17] identity and kind of made it of
[35:19] effective and you uh useful and Satan's
[35:21] kingdom and he bound him and then he was
[35:23] able to cast out the
[35:25] demons so bying ing the strong
[35:28] man is how you divide the
[35:33] house this is by binding the strong men
[35:36] Jesus was able to kick these demons out
[35:38] if you can bind the St the strong men
[35:40] then you allowed to be defiled and
[35:42] allowed to be
[35:43] destroyed so this is this is kind of
[35:47] it's just another layer to this because
[35:49] A house divided against itself cannot
[35:51] stand so divided House Is Not a Home how
[35:53] do we make a house a home through this
[35:55] order through Arrangement disrupt the
[35:59] correct order wrong sequence wrong
[36:01] organization wrong pattern then that's
[36:04] what divides the house that's what
[36:07] allows it to be
[36:09] spoiled there are if you heard the
[36:12] phrase united we stand divided we
[36:15] fall it's origin comes from asap's
[36:18] fables the one on that united we stand
[36:21] divided we fall I think is most often
[36:23] tracked back to the Fable of the four
[36:25] oxen and the lion
[36:27] and the way that the story is told is
[36:29] that a lion would prowl about in a field
[36:32] where there was four
[36:33] oxen and and whenever he came to attack
[36:36] them they would turn their tails into
[36:39] each other so they were facing outward
[36:42] so whichever way that he approached him
[36:43] he was met with the horns of The
[36:46] Oxen and as the story goes through the
[36:49] passage of time they kind of began to
[36:51] fight among themselves and each went off
[36:54] to eat on their own and then the lion
[36:56] attacked them one by one and made an end
[36:58] to all four and the statement is United
[37:01] to stand divided we
[37:04] fall it's also alluded to in
[37:08] the the Fable of the bundle of sticks
[37:11] and how a father had a family that was
[37:12] always fighting and he tried many times
[37:15] to get them to reconcile by saying we
[37:16] shouldn't fight we should be in this
[37:18] together and and he thought well I I
[37:20] need to demonstrate something to them so
[37:22] that they could understand what I mean
[37:24] by we shouldn't always be fighting and
[37:25] so he took his sons and he told them to
[37:27] lay some sticks before him and so they
[37:29] took these sticks and laid them out
[37:30] there and he he had each one of them uh
[37:34] he had them tie them into a
[37:36] bundle and he told them one by one take
[37:38] these bundle of sticks and you break
[37:40] them and as they took up the bundle of
[37:43] sticks and tried to break them one by
[37:45] one they were unable to break the bundle
[37:47] of sticks that tied together they
[37:49] couldn't they couldn't uh snap them so
[37:52] then he untied
[37:54] it these sticks were bound together now
[37:56] he unti them and then he says break them
[37:59] and they're able to take them and break
[38:00] them one by one and they did it very
[38:03] easily and the father said thus my sons
[38:06] as long as you remain aned are a match
[38:09] for all your enemies but differ and
[38:12] separate you are
[38:15] undone United together arranged
[38:18] correctly there's a strength there there
[38:21] there's a power there's a beauty there's
[38:23] a symmetry there's an upholding there's
[38:24] a supporting that comes when we're
[38:27] arranged together prop properly and you
[38:29] can be United against all your enemies
[38:31] you can find the power you need in the
[38:32] moment you know it you can find the
[38:34] protection you need in the moment you
[38:35] know but if you begin to differ and
[38:37] separate and you're always quarreling
[38:38] then you're undone united we stand
[38:41] divided we fall United together uh
[38:43] remaining together it's as that bundle
[38:45] of
[38:46] sticks another Fable that would could be
[38:50] included in this is about the lion and
[38:52] the Bulls now all these different lions
[38:54] and Bulls and we're mixing football and
[38:55] basketball here it gets kind of
[38:57] confusing but there's three bulls that
[39:00] were in the in the field together and
[39:03] they were they had great peace amongst
[39:05] themselves and there was always a lion
[39:07] that kind of was watching and waiting
[39:09] wanting to eat them and he he found that
[39:13] there were he never had an
[39:14] opportunity uh to attack them as long as
[39:17] they stayed together these three Bulls
[39:18] is a three-fold cord is not uh quickly
[39:21] broken there was just something about
[39:23] the three together where it was imposing
[39:25] to the lion and so the lion began to
[39:28] seow Discord he began to secretly spread
[39:31] evil and slanderous reports of the one
[39:33] against another until he had form intoed
[39:35] jealousy and distrust amongst the three
[39:39] no sooner did the Lions see that they
[39:40] avoided each other and fed by themselves
[39:43] then he fell upon them individually and
[39:45] made easy prey of
[39:47] them and this to me is outstanding the
[39:50] quarrel of friends are the opportunities
[39:53] of foes right amen
[39:57] how did Satan get advantage and how did
[40:00] this work in and how did this happen
[40:02] just get a quarrel among
[40:04] friends get a quarrel in the family I
[40:06] had this statement and maybe I should
[40:08] have out brought it but he says you just
[40:09] get one member of the family worked up
[40:11] and everyone else gets worked up there's
[40:13] a way that he begins to try to quarrel
[40:15] within the family a quarrel among the
[40:17] parents is a quarrel among the children
[40:19] and then it becomes an opportunity of
[40:21] the foes becomes an opportunity for
[40:23] Satan I hope you can see really what's
[40:26] being intended not just by referring to
[40:28] Illusions and and fables and these
[40:30] things to realize that when Jesus says
[40:32] binding the strong man which I think
[40:34] it's such beautiful language in light of
[40:36] A house divided against itself takes
[40:39] something that was together and
[40:41] separates it right and then he uses a
[40:43] language to say bind the strong man yes
[40:47] it it it almost seems to be a paradox
[40:49] because it was a family bound together
[40:51] but you got to find something else to
[40:52] bring it to and so it's the unraveling
[40:55] of the strength of the
[40:57] family is the Bowing down of the family
[41:00] to the wrong kind of order or
[41:03] Arrangement I'll come I'm drawing that
[41:05] from places in the scripture that's used
[41:07] by Jesus in different instances where to
[41:10] bind the strong man it's a
[41:14] bowing it's a subjection to the wrong
[41:17] kind of order in other words Jesus could
[41:19] say it this way Satan has his kingdom I
[41:22] entered in and brought it subject to a
[41:25] different order now if we're going to
[41:26] use this as an example for us and our
[41:28] own families it's when we have an order
[41:31] according to the word of God after a
[41:32] pattern of sequence or Arrangement
[41:34] there's a beauty as we've already read
[41:35] in here that this the family that's
[41:37] correct good Noble and obedient we're
[41:39] one we're all in agreement and it's in
[41:41] honoring God's word then all we have to
[41:43] do to bind the strong men of the house
[41:46] and all we have to do to see that our
[41:48] house is uh is spoiled is to divide that
[41:52] by bowing down to the wrong kind of
[41:55] sequence order p are patting ourselves
[41:57] after the world and not the
[42:01] word in judges
[42:05] 20:1 says so all the men of Israel were
[42:07] gathered against the city knit together
[42:11] as one man there's your
[42:16] order the sewing together the weaving
[42:20] together it's not enough that the whole
[42:23] Army shows up that day it's not enough
[42:26] that they all physically lined
[42:28] themselves up and the scripture wasn't
[42:30] just saying that well they all found
[42:31] their position on the battlefield you go
[42:33] here you go there you go here you go
[42:35] there they were knit together as one
[42:37] man they knew what part they'd played I
[42:40] think have some of you seen I think it's
[42:42] uh I can't even remember what you'd even
[42:44] call it but where you have it's just
[42:46] walking and and they just walk in these
[42:49] in the rhythmic way and it's
[42:51] synchronized to where one's walking this
[42:52] way one's walking this way and they
[42:54] don't touch each other at all and they
[42:55] start weaving in now anybody seen that
[42:57] can I get any hands you think I'm crazy
[42:59] you do you think I'm absolutely
[43:01] crazy and there's a way that they walk
[43:04] and the way that they work and they're
[43:05] all doing their part and they're
[43:07] blending together did you guys conspire
[43:09] to not nod at one
[43:10] point like when he asks his third
[43:13] question everybody just
[43:15] BL every at the same
[43:18] time but there's a this knitting
[43:20] together by of one man it wasn't just a
[43:22] visual representation that signifies
[43:25] some sort of symmetry but they're knit
[43:27] together as one man they would move like
[43:29] one body one thing wouldn't get a ahead
[43:32] of the the next and you know sometimes
[43:34] people are clumsy and they trip over
[43:35] their own feet or they just can't stay
[43:37] out of their own way this wasn't going
[43:38] to happen they were knit together as one
[43:40] man it was fluid it was strong and there
[43:42] was strength in that order there was
[43:44] strength in that arrangement in that
[43:45] sewing together and brother bam says we
[43:48] are identified with our families in this
[43:50] human life and he says by marriage which
[43:52] is a sewing together that's a uniting
[43:54] with their wives we marry our fames
[43:57] identified by the union of our marriage
[44:00] the union of our marriage I want to take
[44:02] that word and just use it as the
[44:03] arrangement the weaving together how how
[44:06] do the two parts relate to one another
[44:09] and in doing that how does it establish
[44:11] a family identity a a and the character
[44:14] to the family that the children then are
[44:16] woven
[44:18] into because a family that is divided
[44:20] against itself or is it saying A house
[44:22] divided against itself it's the
[44:24] upsetting of that Harmony
[44:26] it's the disruption of that Arrangement
[44:28] and the order and so when I used and I
[44:31] really touched on something by using the
[44:33] term contempt on
[44:35] Sunday and I'm not purposely doing it
[44:38] again uh to today at 15 past the hour to
[44:42] just be able to just say it and move on
[44:45] but it's to have contempt I was W you to
[44:47] recognize that's when order's been
[44:49] upset it there there's a wrong kind of
[44:52] order it's the upsetting of the order
[44:54] once the order is broken you're
[44:59] divided and that that and I think
[45:02] there's a lot more that we could share
[45:03] on that and we may continue in it in
[45:04] other places but The Binding of the
[45:07] strong man is bringing this the man of
[45:09] the head or from the whole thing subject
[45:13] to the a different subjection a
[45:15] different order that's what Christ did
[45:17] in the positive
[45:19] sense but in the this negative sense in
[45:21] our own
[45:23] house when the prior order sequence or
[45:26] patterns disrupted you've B you you bind
[45:28] the strong man and I want you to think
[45:31] personally I want you to think deeply
[45:32] about
[45:33] that because we cannot we ought not to
[45:37] allow ourselves to become subject to the
[45:40] world there's an order we must be
[45:42] following and then there's a way that we
[45:43] break that order united we stand divided
[45:46] we fall the qual among uh friends is the
[45:48] opportunity of foes that if we as long
[45:50] as we stay together we can be strong
[45:52] individually divide us up break that
[45:53] order arrange us to some other pattern
[45:56] and we say oh well we're all together
[45:58] and we're all doing this but you're do
[45:59] you're not arranged cuz this is where I
[46:02] could even put it this way sometimes I
[46:04] just need to focus on the family I just
[46:05] need to get with my family I need to
[46:06] spend more time with my family that's
[46:09] great but if you not putting the Lord
[46:12] first if you're not letting Christ have
[46:14] preeminence in the home in your personal
[46:16] life if you haven't found the pattern of
[46:18] the word and say as a family this is
[46:19] what we ought to have preeminence it's
[46:21] not just that we get together as a
[46:22] family we do things as a family we're
[46:24] all together in family and the children
[46:25] are going to live at home and we're
[46:26] going to do all these great recreational
[46:27] things together that that's wonderful
[46:29] but that's not the kind of focus that a
[46:32] family has in order to be strong the
[46:34] family has to be United together all in
[46:36] Harmony and agreement to the
[46:40] word we were doing Ah that's what I was
[46:42] going to ask all right I think there's
[46:45] enough families here parents there's a
[46:47] question have any of your children
[46:49] talked to you this week about Isaac
[46:51] raise your hand if any of your CH
[46:52] parents talk to you about Isaac in the
[46:54] Bible anybody anybody really God bless
[46:57] you what do you want Chick-fil-A gift
[46:59] cards in and out
[47:01] cash you just let's talk
[47:04] later okay some more hands never mind I
[47:07] take that
[47:08] back we talked to the young people about
[47:10] that on um on Sunday about Isaac
[47:14] Abraham's following God Supreme Faith
[47:17] Abraham's going to offer Isaac upon the
[47:18] altar but God never showed that to Isaac
[47:21] something to think
[47:24] about when we lose headship of the word
[47:27] that's when the order in the home is
[47:29] broken brother BR said in the world has
[47:31] fallen apart the beautiful virtue that
[47:32] God gives a woman to be a mother has
[47:34] been marred and that's the backbone of
[47:36] the nation you break motherhood you
[47:39] broke the nation right then that's one
[47:42] thing that helps hold it together real
[47:44] genuine I love how he comes to this
[47:47] Parenthood now the what stands out to me
[47:51] the backbone of the nation is not in
[47:53] Washington
[47:54] DC it's not not in the halls of Congress
[47:57] it's not in the white house it's not in
[47:59] the Pentagon the backbone of this nation
[48:01] is not in the cour houses it's not in
[48:03] the government institutions or in any of
[48:05] the assemblies it's in the home the
[48:09] backbone of the Nations is in the house
[48:11] house it's a it's the real genuine
[48:13] Parenthood that forms the backbone of
[48:15] the nation so he said if you want to
[48:17] know how to divide the nation divide the
[48:19] family if you want to know how to break
[48:21] up the nation break up Parenthood he
[48:24] says it in thirsting for life that's
[48:25] what breaks up homes that's what spoils
[48:27] children that's what makes neurotics
[48:29] that's what makes teenage delinquency is
[48:31] when motherhood and fatherhood is
[48:34] broke I hope you recognize now that
[48:36] motherhood and fatherhood is the office
[48:38] of being a mother the hood ship of being
[48:40] a father it's an order it's an
[48:42] arrangement it's a calling it's a it's a
[48:44] duty it's a responsibility and the only
[48:47] and the way that you can get uh spoiled
[48:49] children make neurotics and break up
[48:51] homes and cause teenage delinquency
[48:54] Isn't So Much by broadcasting things and
[48:57] making pornography available and making
[48:59] video games that are this way and
[49:00] saturating the airwaves with a bunch of
[49:02] nonsense all of that can be out there
[49:04] but if you want it to be effective
[49:06] you've got to break the backbone of the
[49:09] home and that starts with Mom and
[49:13] Dad now that may seem to be
[49:16] hard but that's maybe one of the most
[49:19] encouraging things I could ever say to a
[49:21] church this world is perverted because
[49:24] they broke Parenthood and you want to
[49:26] know how to keep perversion out of your
[49:27] home be a real
[49:29] parent be a real proactive God-fearing H
[49:33] mother and father who will have a
[49:35] backbone and stand up to the things Lord
[49:37] stand up even to your children's
[49:42] whims be diligent raise some
[49:45] Isaacs that when it comes to applying
[49:47] the token and say we're going to kick it
[49:48] out we're not going to do this anymore
[49:50] yeah I've let it go too far but I've got
[49:52] to apply the talken to my home we got to
[49:53] stand for truth we got to stand for
[49:55] right you want to have eyes and like
[49:57] okay I know this is sacrificing a lot
[49:59] that I like and this is a lot for me to
[50:00] lose but you know what you've got to
[50:02] obey the Lord you've got to do what
[50:03] you're supposed to do amen motherhood
[50:07] and fatherhood are the backbone it's the
[50:11] strength of the
[50:13] house and my you could just I as I
[50:16] mentioned contempt
[50:18] before you look at the selfish ambition
[50:21] that some parents have and the inability
[50:24] to F for any anybody else in the family
[50:27] they don't have the ability to feel for
[50:28] their spouse they don't have ability to
[50:30] feel for their children it's just all
[50:31] about themselves and the way they view
[50:32] things this is how you spoil
[50:36] families because it's not holding that
[50:38] real true position in the family as a
[50:40] father as a
[50:53] mother and Isaiah chap 32:
[50:59] 18 this scripture is used quite
[51:02] frequently for myself in ministry here
[51:05] especially in my people shall
[51:08] dwell not just in
[51:10] tents not just in houses with
[51:14] foundations not well furnished and
[51:16] sealed walls and permanent dwellings but
[51:20] he says they shall dwell in a Peaceable
[51:23] habitation and Ure dwell
[51:25] dwellings and in quiet resting
[51:32] places I set forth or I suggest to you
[51:35] tonight that what he has described has
[51:37] nothing to do with the physical
[51:40] structure it was more than a building
[51:42] what he's describing as a home a
[51:44] Peaceable habitation is a place where
[51:46] there's no fighting not Disturbed with
[51:47] the alarm of War there's there's no
[51:49] enemies
[51:51] within there's no quarreling amongst the
[51:53] members there's no infighting there's no
[51:55] division within therefore it's a sure
[51:57] dwelling where it's secure it's
[51:58] confident there's provision it's not
[52:00] against itself there's no infighting
[52:02] it's a quiet resting place it's not it's
[52:05] not
[52:06] there as a place of Labor and strife and
[52:09] unfortunately our homes become that for
[52:11] many people and when I think about it
[52:14] it's almost as if the pandemic
[52:15] Consolidated a lot of things where the
[52:17] husband leaves and he goes works and
[52:18] then he comes home and the wife is she's
[52:20] a housewife she works at home she works
[52:21] where she sleeps she works where she
[52:23] eats she works where she raised the kids
[52:24] she's laid in within the home and home
[52:26] is not just a place of work just a place
[52:28] of Labor just a place of trying to keep
[52:29] up the children homeschool at home they
[52:31] don't even get away everything the
[52:32] father's working from home now and then
[52:34] H the house becomes a place of school
[52:36] work labor chores and if it gets into
[52:39] that Rhythm that's not a really Pleasant
[52:42] Rhythm it's become a place of school
[52:44] it's become a place of work it's become
[52:46] a place of chores it becomes a place
[52:47] where all these things are happening and
[52:49] I believe that all those things can be
[52:51] in the house but if we find a way to
[52:53] make a house a home it's as if all those
[52:55] moving parts and responsibilities begin
[52:57] to harmonize themselves and you have a
[52:59] peaceful Peaceable habitation a sure
[53:02] dwelling and a quiet resting place
[53:04] because it's just not merely a place to
[53:05] lay my head it's not just merely a place
[53:07] of Labor or
[53:09] Strife brother Brandman the sermon
[53:11] Masterpiece speaks of that Great
[53:12] Masterpiece of the family in the garden
[53:14] he says the husband and wife cannot be
[53:16] truly a family unless they are one they
[53:19] have to
[53:20] be if they're not they're not a good
[53:23] family and then notice this language I
[53:24] think we've been used this a lot maybe
[53:25] used it Sunday wife pulling one way the
[53:28] husband another A House Divided amen
[53:31] that would make an awful family but in
[53:34] agreement with love one to the other
[53:37] that's a family and now that was God's
[53:39] Masterpiece and now all the true family
[53:41] here portrays that think about all the
[53:44] work that goes into family pictures
[53:46] coming to the last quarter of the year
[53:47] we need to send out our Christmas cards
[53:49] New Year's cards we got a Happy
[53:50] Valentine's Day
[53:51] card but there's uh there's there's
[53:54] family pictures that they do and they
[53:55] send out and the work and the
[53:57] preparation and all the colors matching
[53:59] and everything being arranged just right
[54:01] you you come forward here you do this
[54:03] you do that we're making sure you get
[54:05] the picture right want everything to be
[54:07] right because people are going to see
[54:08] this but the real the way the what the
[54:10] real family of God portrays the real
[54:12] family picture the real family portrait
[54:15] is harmony Unity the right kind of order
[54:18] and brother bam teaches us he says your
[54:20] family is what you are so he says raise
[54:22] your children in a certain environment
[54:24] it's got to
[54:25] 98% better chance to go right than it
[54:28] has if you bring it up in the wrong
[54:31] way what does that do should stop us at
[54:33] our tracks that if I can raise them up
[54:35] in the right order if I can get the
[54:37] order right in my home if I can get a
[54:39] backbone as a father if I can have a
[54:41] backbone as a mother if we can be woven
[54:44] together correctly in the right sequency
[54:45] in the right order if we can have this
[54:48] in the house if we can make a house a
[54:50] home if this house is not divided we
[54:53] give our children a 98% better chance to
[54:56] go
[54:57] right than if it's out of
[55:02] order A House Divided is no
[55:06] home we should stri this should be
[55:08] something we labor for something we work
[55:10] for for order in the house to make it a
[55:15] home in Ephesians chap 4:3 endeavoring
[55:18] to keep the unity of the spirit in the
[55:20] bond of Peace give diligence haste tend
[55:23] to carefully
[55:25] to keep Unity agreement
[55:27] order brother Brandman how can I
[55:30] overcome I think it's where he's talking
[55:31] about it looked at the stars and the
[55:32] heavens and I thought man what would
[55:34] happen if one of them got out of place
[55:36] when one gets out of order now he's
[55:37] speaking of us it holds it throws the
[55:39] whole thing out of cater the whole
[55:40] program of God is upset when one member
[55:42] gets out of order we should continually
[55:45] to strive to keep the order of the
[55:48] spirit endeavoring to keep the unity of
[55:51] the spirit in the
[55:53] bond of peace
[55:56] that word bond in the Greek is the
[55:57] ligaments by which members of the body
[55:59] are united together a sewing together in
[56:03] the bond of Peace it's translated to one
[56:06] rest quietness it's that Harmony
[56:10] security exemption from
[56:13] fighting that's what makes a house
[56:15] that's the bond of Peace when everyone's
[56:17] at peace when everyone's in Harmony when
[56:19] things are being AR it doesn't mean we
[56:20] all agree necessarily on all things but
[56:23] we have an agreement sure I tell my
[56:26] children quite often it's and I tell
[56:28] them and if I'm wrong in this I know the
[56:30] Lord will help me but they get
[56:31] frustrated I say it's okay that you're
[56:33] frustrated how how uh I I mean I'm
[56:37] trying to think of the right word but I
[56:39] mean that would just be so
[56:40] insensitive to say you're frustrated
[56:43] you're
[56:44] grounded that frustrates you you're
[56:46] grounded for a week that frustrate a
[56:49] month a year leave I mean where do you
[56:53] go with that right I mean if they're
[56:55] going to you just more frustration more
[56:57] frustrated and they blow up and you're
[56:59] like you know what I've had enough this
[57:01] is ridiculous so there's got to be a
[57:03] point where wisdom prevails it's okay
[57:05] that you're frustrated I'm frustrated
[57:07] that you're
[57:08] frustrated but I'm not breaking things
[57:12] right and there's a way that you address
[57:14] the frustration I tell my children I
[57:16] understand it's okay if you're
[57:16] frustrated but it's how we handle
[57:18] frustration I tell them it's okay if you
[57:20] disagree with me I I I don't I I'm not
[57:23] upset or I'm not it doesn't bother me
[57:25] that you think your opinion is better
[57:26] than me and I had to do that in order to
[57:28] get anywhere right it was like okay I
[57:31] know I'm
[57:31] wrong but there's a way that you look at
[57:34] it you're no I know you've got an
[57:35] opinion I know they have a Viewpoint I
[57:37] know you see it a certain way son I know
[57:40] that there you might think that this is
[57:41] a better way and that I'm crazy and to
[57:43] acknowledge and then start from there
[57:46] yeah you know what you feel that way and
[57:47] just because you feel differently than
[57:49] me isn't Disobedience it's not
[57:51] disrespectful it's not being obstinate
[57:53] it's not Rebellion it's how we address
[57:56] and handle a lack of meeting of the
[57:59] minds I think it's fair this way I think
[58:02] it's fair that way someone say oh that H
[58:03] that family's broken up man they're
[58:05] headed for ruin brother Aaron that's
[58:06] contempt No contempt is when well you're
[58:09] an idiot for feeling that way and I hate
[58:12] you can't wait till I turn 18 because
[58:14] you feel that way that that's allowing
[58:16] one dis difference in seeing things to
[58:19] cause a
[58:21] fight instead of just looking at and
[58:23] saying hey we're not we're not on
[58:25] opposite sides here we're in this
[58:28] together we I want to know what's best
[58:30] for you I want you to understand what I
[58:32] feel is best for my family and you begin
[58:34] to approach it from that standpoint to
[58:35] where it's not we're endeavoring to keep
[58:37] the unity there's a there's it's not the
[58:40] fighting because it doesn't have to
[58:41] always be seeing things the same way but
[58:43] have a Meeting of Minds to where now
[58:44] there's an
[58:46] understanding you find a place to meet
[58:48] when it in contract languages I alluded
[58:51] to it on Sunday there's a meeting of the
[58:52] minds now if I'm a seller my mind is
[58:55] high
[58:57] price if I'm a buyer my mind is low
[59:00] price right I remember one time I was in
[59:02] a mediation uh and I was representing a
[59:05] defendant the opposing party made a
[59:06] account an offer and asked for a bunch
[59:08] of money and so the mediator came to me
[59:10] and said how much are you going to offer
[59:12] I said Z doar it worked it worked I had
[59:17] a pretty good argument for it but the
[59:18] idea is that if if there's a meat of the
[59:20] minds what happens when you come to a
[59:22] conclusion is if not that you don't
[59:24] think you should get that you should
[59:26] have to pay them anything and it's not
[59:27] that they don't think they deserve a
[59:28] million dollars but you work to finally
[59:30] come to a place where you ackowledge
[59:33] something there's give and take and you
[59:34] arrive at a conclusion and it's mediated
[59:37] and then you draw up the contract and
[59:38] there's a meeting of the M you say well
[59:40] I wanted I only wanted to pay a dollar I
[59:42] wanted to get a billion dollars but we
[59:44] somehow mediated and negotiated a price
[59:47] and there was ultimately a meeting of
[59:48] the minds we're on the same page the
[59:51] terms are being spelled out I know
[59:53] there's a lot there and I've run out of
[59:54] time
[59:56] but the Bible says in 1 Corinthians
[59:57] 14:40 let all things be done decently
[1:00:01] and in order in the proper form remember
[1:00:05] how we looked at this it's well formed
[1:00:07] and it speaks of that Forma Beauty the
[1:00:09] the the the beauty the shapeliness the
[1:00:12] Symmetry there's a way that something
[1:00:14] works where you you see the way that
[1:00:17] something's supposed to
[1:00:18] function H my brother and I we used to
[1:00:20] kind of joke around that we that we and
[1:00:22] we would do it sometimes where you would
[1:00:24] just you would do something that was out
[1:00:26] of symmetry how a person would behave
[1:00:28] when you're in a social context just to
[1:00:29] see if people would pick up on it and
[1:00:31] and if if if after a while they'd kind
[1:00:32] of creep him
[1:00:35] out we actually had I think he still
[1:00:37] does it but not me uh I need to tell
[1:00:40] Matthew we're not playing
[1:00:42] anymore there is a way we tell a story
[1:00:44] and he'd
[1:00:45] say you remember when we were at the
[1:00:47] store I go no it wasn't a grocery store
[1:00:48] it was a ball game he goes you're right
[1:00:50] it wasn't a ball game and the Cowboys
[1:00:52] were playing saying no it wasn't Cowboys
[1:00:53] it was it was the Dallas Stars and we
[1:00:54] would do this for 5 minutes where
[1:00:57] nothing ever we never the story hadn't
[1:00:59] even
[1:01:00] begun and and that that that's the way
[1:01:02] to tell a story that's no way to
[1:01:03] interact it's it's disconcordant it's
[1:01:05] chaos it's out of order says let all
[1:01:07] things be done decently in an order or
[1:01:10] is that fixed Arrangement it's the due
[1:01:12] course it's the right way it's an
[1:01:14] orderly condition it speaks of a a a
[1:01:17] position A ranked a post of
[1:01:21] Duty based upon a person's quality based
[1:01:24] upon their character based upon their
[1:01:28] calling why because Paul says for God is
[1:01:31] not the author of confusion but of
[1:01:35] Peace he's not the author of instability
[1:01:37] or disorder but he's the author of Peace
[1:01:39] Harmony
[1:01:42] Accord as brother Bram makes this
[1:01:45] statement in God hiding himself in
[1:01:46] Simplicity then revealing himself in the
[1:01:48] same let all things be done decently in
[1:01:51] an order that's what brings true beauty
[1:01:53] the way symmetry the weaving together
[1:01:54] the right kind of order we've been drawn
[1:01:57] a lot from this now I think it's our
[1:01:58] duty to make the inside right by the
[1:02:00] grace of God not the outside by Optics
[1:02:02] and by Design and architecture and
[1:02:05] materials and facade but the inside
[1:02:08] right the Box Car Can Be Heaven on Earth
[1:02:12] the palace can be hell on
[1:02:14] Earth if the inside's right by order by
[1:02:17] character he says to be grateful to the
[1:02:19] god this will not just only be a
[1:02:21] beautiful building that we've come to
[1:02:23] but may everyone that comes in not just
[1:02:25] a beautiful building but a home is what
[1:02:27] I'm saying see the beautiful
[1:02:29] characteristic of Jesus Christ in every
[1:02:31] person that comes in order in the
[1:02:32] individual order in the families order
[1:02:34] in the church may it be a consecrated
[1:02:36] place to our Lord a consecrated people
[1:02:39] for no matter how beautiful the
[1:02:40] structure is and we do appreciate the
[1:02:42] beautiful
[1:02:43] structure the beauty of the church is
[1:02:45] the character of the people these are my
[1:02:47] words the order the character and he
[1:02:50] says I trust it'll always be a house of
[1:02:53] God of beauty a house of God's Beauty a
[1:02:56] home filled with the beauty of the
[1:02:59] Lord I know I've gone over time but I
[1:03:02] still want to finish with another
[1:03:04] scripture 1 Corinthians chapter 3: 9 and
[1:03:06] 10 this will give us a good stopping
[1:03:09] point on A House Divided is no home I
[1:03:12] think we'll just move into some other
[1:03:14] areas on this but but building on this
[1:03:17] so don't leave this in your minds I want
[1:03:19] this to be uh a conversation starter
[1:03:23] yeah if I can put this way this sermon
[1:03:24] is not the subject this is an idea this
[1:03:27] is a suggestion for a subject within
[1:03:30] your home this isn't just sign seal
[1:03:32] delivered put a bow on it period let's
[1:03:34] move on to the next subject and you
[1:03:35] start thinking about oh what's the
[1:03:36] what's the next series or what's the
[1:03:38] next subject no this is a conversation
[1:03:40] suggestion this is something for you to
[1:03:42] consider in your family take this
[1:03:43] material take these principles examine
[1:03:45] Yourself by it think about it he says in
[1:03:47] 1 Corinthians chap 3: 9 and 10 he's
[1:03:50] going to come to where we call chapter
[1:03:53] 14 later let all things be done decently
[1:03:55] in an order God's not the author of
[1:03:58] confusion but of Peace he's going to
[1:03:59] deal with the symmetry of the body and
[1:04:01] let there be no Schism in chapter 12 and
[1:04:03] so there's all these things he says in
[1:04:05] chapter 12 all these things he deals
[1:04:06] with in this tremendous book and
[1:04:07] addressing different things but he he he
[1:04:10] establishes in the beginning we are
[1:04:12] labors together with God ye are God's
[1:04:15] husbandry you're the vineyard you're his
[1:04:18] field you're also his building so now
[1:04:20] whether you want to use agriculture or
[1:04:22] farming or you want to use architecture
[1:04:24] building you are God's husbandry you are
[1:04:26] God's Building they serve a purpose
[1:04:29] according to the grace of God which is
[1:04:31] given un me as a wise master builder I
[1:04:35] have laid the foundation another buth
[1:04:38] thereon what what it might seem to be
[1:04:41] maybe some uh arrogance on his part but
[1:04:44] what
[1:04:44] humility it's been given to him as a
[1:04:47] wise master builder is he saying that
[1:04:48] God the master builder has hired him to
[1:04:50] lay the foundation was he calling
[1:04:51] himself a master builder he says I've
[1:04:53] laid the Foundation another will build
[1:04:55] let every man take heed how the buth how
[1:04:59] he buth there
[1:05:02] upon my challenge to all of us is to
[1:05:04] make your house a
[1:05:07] home whether it be your heart whether it
[1:05:11] be your house your residence your
[1:05:12] dwelling or this church we are called to
[1:05:16] make a house a home when brother bam
[1:05:20] said it's our duty to make the inside
[1:05:21] right by the grace of God he says it's a
[1:05:23] beautiful building but we have a duty to
[1:05:25] make the inside right in order for it to
[1:05:28] be a home of the Holy Spirit in order
[1:05:29] for it to be a Gate of Heaven so that
[1:05:31] when people walk in they don't just see
[1:05:33] Church order they just don't see that
[1:05:34] the message is believed here they're
[1:05:36] just not seeing the elements and the
[1:05:38] accoutrements of a message believing
[1:05:39] church but they come in and there's a
[1:05:41] Gate of Heaven because God is welcomed
[1:05:44] there and everything's done decently in
[1:05:46] order and it becomes a house of the
[1:05:48] beauty of the Lord where people can come
[1:05:50] and inquire of the Lord and see his
[1:05:53] character and see his Beauty in
[1:05:56] order and I say this to all the men that
[1:05:59] are here from the youngest to the oldest
[1:06:04] the youngest here I don't know maybe
[1:06:05] looking around who the youngest might be
[1:06:07] maybe it's Theo might be the youngest
[1:06:09] boy that's here tonight or it might be
[1:06:10] Joseph actually and you say from the
[1:06:13] youngest and he might be a little too
[1:06:15] young to be trained he's not even uh
[1:06:17] training diapers yet but you are called
[1:06:19] to be a
[1:06:20] homebuilder and some of you might think
[1:06:22] I know what I'm going to be when I grow
[1:06:23] up
[1:06:24] you're called to be it you're called to
[1:06:27] be a home
[1:06:29] builder that's what we're called to do
[1:06:31] as men is to build houses into
[1:06:33] homes I know there's a lot of talk about
[1:06:36] well with the generation this day
[1:06:37] growing up I think about it even with my
[1:06:39] son and my children it's becoming
[1:06:41] increasingly difficult especially in
[1:06:43] some areas even here in Maricopa County
[1:06:45] where it's difficult for young couples
[1:06:47] to own homes and it's very difficult uh
[1:06:50] that the entry level to find a good
[1:06:52] residence in an area you want to live
[1:06:54] and you have to go further and further
[1:06:55] out it's it's really hard to buy a house
[1:06:57] but listen it it it it's within your
[1:07:01] ability to make wherever you live a
[1:07:04] home you may not be able to right now
[1:07:07] afford your own house and own it as a
[1:07:09] house but wherever you live you can make
[1:07:11] it a home because you were called by God
[1:07:13] men are called by God to be home
[1:07:15] builders and you're either in that place
[1:07:18] right now or you're being trained for it
[1:07:21] so whether it be Joseph or James or Theo
[1:07:22] or however young or Jack and start going
[1:07:24] all the way up to the oldest that's here
[1:07:26] and different on if you're not there yet
[1:07:28] you're in training for it now to be a
[1:07:31] home
[1:07:32] builder and you say well what about the
[1:07:34] sisters well they're called to be home
[1:07:37] makers men are to be home builders
[1:07:40] ladies are to be home makers you're
[1:07:41] called to make a house a
[1:07:44] home from the youngest to the oldest
[1:07:46] you're either in training now or you're
[1:07:48] in the on the
[1:07:50] job and it's our duty it's our duty to
[1:07:55] make a house a
[1:07:56] home and we do that by looking at the
[1:07:58] order of it and we can determine whether
[1:08:02] or not we have the right order by taking
[1:08:05] an honest look at the way our house
[1:08:08] functions and at the end of the day does
[1:08:11] the
[1:08:12] picture what does the picture
[1:08:15] indicate what what value does the
[1:08:18] picture
[1:08:20] indicate when you look at the picture
[1:08:22] what could we determine based upon that
[1:08:24] portrait the things the family values
[1:08:30] am I know maybe some might say why
[1:08:34] preach this on a Wednesday night I I
[1:08:36] think this is where it's
[1:08:38] easier it's easier to preach it maybe on
[1:08:40] a Wednesday
[1:08:44] night if the musicians could come to
[1:08:47] their instruments I want to read one
[1:08:48] last statement or just make reference to
[1:08:50] it you know it brother's talking about
[1:08:53] in the early early
[1:08:54] 60s and we talk about Revival what does
[1:08:57] Revival mean and and there's a lot of
[1:08:59] really good conversations about it
[1:09:01] recently I think there was a Min there
[1:09:03] was a Minister's meeting I think the
[1:09:05] subject was going to be what is the
[1:09:06] bride's Revival and there's a Believe It
[1:09:08] or Not despite the very clear things
[1:09:10] that brother bradam said there's always
[1:09:11] differences of opinions of what that
[1:09:13] looks like and sometimes people have
[1:09:15] opinions that are just exactly against
[1:09:17] what brother brandham said uh and it can
[1:09:20] become very uh combative in some ways
[1:09:24] but brother man's talking about how a
[1:09:25] minister can't bring a Revival preacher
[1:09:28] doesn't bring a Revival that when a
[1:09:29] minister comes into town and as we have
[1:09:31] brother Jason Watkins coming in town I I
[1:09:33] don't care if he's bringing a series of
[1:09:35] notes on Revival and he's packed it in
[1:09:38] his bag he's going to bring it it's on
[1:09:39] his iPad and he had to go get an iPad
[1:09:41] Pro and get it with one terabyte of data
[1:09:44] on it in order to have everything there
[1:09:45] brother B said he doesn't pack it with
[1:09:47] them the only thing a minister can do is
[1:09:50] be loyal to God and His word is what he
[1:09:52] says but where where does the Revival
[1:09:55] come he says it comes by the
[1:09:58] people and we think oh okay the Revival
[1:10:01] comes by the people so I'll bring the
[1:10:04] Revival or I'll cause the Revival but he
[1:10:07] says in your
[1:10:08] home in your life the real Revival
[1:10:13] listen we know that Revival Services
[1:10:15] have kind of Taken on a language of its
[1:10:16] own Revival is when the church holds
[1:10:19] special services and and there's a
[1:10:21] there's maybe a certain way of worship
[1:10:22] and preaching and oh they're having a
[1:10:24] Revival and it happens within the
[1:10:26] building we hear of the Revival in
[1:10:27] Kentucky we feel the Revival here in
[1:10:29] churches have Revival services and it's
[1:10:31] all based around the
[1:10:33] building and what goes on within the
[1:10:35] building but brother bradam kind of he
[1:10:37] doesn't take away from that and he's not
[1:10:39] trying to uh throw a wet blanket on
[1:10:41] somebody's Fire or the moving of God in
[1:10:43] a church service but really what he's
[1:10:45] doing is saying this is awesome this is
[1:10:48] awesome but you want to know where the
[1:10:49] real Revival comes is when if this
[1:10:52] preeminence that the the Lord has in
[1:10:54] church services if that if you have that
[1:10:56] in your
[1:10:57] home the Revival comes in your home in
[1:11:00] your life that's how the real Revival
[1:11:02] comes we can somehow try to create some
[1:11:05] sort of dynamic and structure where you
[1:11:07] all just leave your home life under the
[1:11:09] uh under the beautiful patio that we
[1:11:11] have in the awning and you just all kind
[1:11:12] of leave it there and we kind of say
[1:11:14] leave it there leave it there we kind of
[1:11:16] leave our home life at the doorstep and
[1:11:18] we come in here and we play church and
[1:11:20] if we could all agree to do that you
[1:11:21] know what we could have some really
[1:11:23] awesome church church services would you
[1:11:25] agree we can have some really really
[1:11:27] awesome church services and you'll have
[1:11:28] some really really crummy days at home
[1:11:31] and my goal is not to have awesome
[1:11:32] church services and crummy families I
[1:11:34] would I wouldn't mind if people looked
[1:11:36] at our church and said they have the
[1:11:37] most boring crummy church services and
[1:11:40] you guys have the most awesome radiated
[1:11:43] powerful home lives that this Valley's
[1:11:46] ever seen and the critics are like ah
[1:11:49] there's no revival going on in Arizona
[1:11:50] Believers Church because all they see is
[1:11:52] what happens on this box as they call it
[1:11:56] you got a new background brother Aaron
[1:11:57] he's still preaching in a box to your F
[1:11:59] your the five people in your family that
[1:12:01] sit in a chair is it just you say I it
[1:12:03] doesn't matter to me what they think
[1:12:04] about this but I want you to know as an
[1:12:06] individual it doesn't matter to me what
[1:12:07] they think it matters to me that you
[1:12:09] know in your family you can have a
[1:12:12] Revival and that the order can be right
[1:12:14] and relationships can find the right
[1:12:16] kind of balance and symmetry that we can
[1:12:18] quit being selfish we can quit we the
[1:12:21] mother pulling One Way father pulling
[1:12:22] another the daughter's out doing this
[1:12:23] the sun's out doing that but we find a
[1:12:25] way to catch or Shake ourselves we say I
[1:12:28] I don't want this house to be divided
[1:12:30] anymore I want this house to be United
[1:12:33] oh God make this house a
[1:12:36] home because that's where the Revival
[1:12:39] comes is in my home
[1:12:42] life oh God help me Lord
[1:12:46] Jesus are you willing to embrace that
[1:12:50] challenge are you are you willing to
[1:12:52] embrace the challenge to be be a
[1:12:53] homebuilder you might think man I I'm
[1:12:56] I'm not a home builder you know what
[1:12:58] I'll just admit it I can I could hardly
[1:12:59] hang a picture in the
[1:13:01] house you just look behind the picture
[1:13:03] see how many holes are there I drilled a
[1:13:06] hole into Eliza's room from the garage
[1:13:08] the other day oh
[1:13:11] whoops because I thought I found the
[1:13:13] stud I wasn't I wasn't in the right spot
[1:13:15] like oh that's that's that that's going
[1:13:16] to give right just right through so that
[1:13:19] might I might be inept when it comes to
[1:13:20] maybe actually building a house but I am
[1:13:25] confident tonight that there's a wise
[1:13:28] master builder who's called me brother
[1:13:30] Aaron to be a home builder and by his
[1:13:33] grace I can do
[1:13:35] it and I could say this too for the
[1:13:38] ladies here there's a wise master
[1:13:40] builder that's called you to be a
[1:13:42] homemaker and by Grace God's grace you
[1:13:44] can do it let's embrace it let's Embrace
[1:13:48] this beautiful
[1:13:50] calling this calling to make houses
[1:13:54] homes
