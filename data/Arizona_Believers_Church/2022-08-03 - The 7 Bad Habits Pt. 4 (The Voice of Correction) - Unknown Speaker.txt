TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Numbers Chapter 20 we're going to start with verse 7 it's going to sound a little unique once we begin to begin our um service and and get into our subject matter but this will just give you you could keep holding on knowing that hopefully I can come back to my text before it's over and it's going to seem very unique once you see our our subject matter Numbers chapter 20:7 and the Lord spake unto Moses saying take the rod and gather thou the assembly together thou and Aaron thy brother and speak ye unto the rock before their eyes and it shall give forth his water and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock so Thou shalt give the congregation and their Beast drink and Moses took the rod from before the Lord as he commanded him and Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together before the Rock and he said unto them hear ye now ye Rebels must we fetch you water out of this rock and Moses lifted up his hand and with his Rod he smot The Rock twice and the water came out abundantly and the congregation drank and their Beast also and the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron because you believed me not to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel therefore ye shall not bring this congregation into the land which I have given them this is the water of meah because the children of Israel strove with the Lord and he was Sanctified in them amen you can be seated I'm really excited about this subject we're going to do another segment uh another part in the segment of of the kids eat free and so all the kids here tonight you are able to eat free no charge uh kids eat free tonight and we're continuing on in that um segment of kids eat free we kind of started a series on the seven bad habits and this is a seven bad habits of highly ineffective parents I'm imagine some of the kids have probably been reminding the parents of this but we had it's been a few services on it so this is the fourth part I don't think that there's going to be anything lost in not having uh maybe a background in those other three parts so I trust that you can just really enter in with us on this subject and tonight we're going to be focusing on um a title of the voice of Correction so in these uh seven bad habits of highly ineffective parents um we've mentioned before that it this doesn't this doesn't just apply to parents but it would apply uh to all of us and it would be something that we could use at any station of life in any relationship that we might have and I don't know are we able to get that up and running is it something I did okay well well then we're just going to trust that this is just the way that it's supposed to be uh it was overemphasizing carnal things was number one and then inconsistently instructing and correcting number two improperly judging number three number four inappropriately using Voice number five was wrongly disciplining number six was not being an example and then number seven was withholding Grace and we matched those up with the elements of the stature of a perfect man and the last service we preached was on emphasis by example and we combined number one and number six on overemphasizing carnal things and not being an example and we took those two because they relate to uh how we act before people and how we act before our children and what we demonstrate the life that we live and the things that we promote by what we say what we View and what we do so we kind of use the emphasis emphasizing the right things by example and then the remaining ones the inconsistent instruction or correction improperly judging inappropriately using Voice or wrongly disciplining and even withholding Grace kind of all relate to how we directly treat our children and so there's ways that we could lump these together but tonight I want to take uh the inappropriately using voice and the wrongly uh disciplining and kind of lump those two together and we I'm going to use two statements from the statue of a perfect man just to kind of recap captured this there you go kids eat free uh so you could kind of see this um in the message of the hour because when we talked about uh using voice incorrectly I think we said it's contrasted by Temperance and we talk talked about just briefly about how the words and the tone that we use can be unfruitful maybe trying to accomplish something but just the way that you do it uh kind of unwinds it and brother bradam says in Statue of a perfect man this is Bible Temperance Holy Spirit Temperance that's just one of the lust of the flesh but we're talking about he's talking about drinking is just one of the lust of the flesh but we're talking about Holy Spirit Temperance that means how to control your tongue not be a Tattler how to control your temper not fly off every time anyone speaks cross to you so I want you to recognize that it's um action and reaction to every action there's an equal and opposite reaction so there's some something that provokes a response and he's looking at Temperance as being what tempers your response and controls it so it's controlling the tongue and then he continues oh Temperance how to answer in kindness when wrath is spoken to you so wrath kind of comes at you Temperance is to not return wrath um back to wrath somebody say you bunch of Holy Rollers down there don't jump out and roll up your sleeves now now that he says not that but talk with Godly love Temperance kindness is that the way you want to be when you're riled upon R not back let him be your example so that's how uh using he's talking about controling the tongue that would be using your voice to respond in Wrath to kind of roll up your sleeves and get right back in their faith face if they have something negative to say you have something negative back that's what um Temperance is is to use him as your example and you kind of bridle that tongue now in wrongly disciplining we contrasted that by patience and I think we Ed the point that wrongly incorrec doesn't correct so if you correct incorrectly you're not going to be correcting the person you're trying to correct and if you correct out a Pride or frustration it kind of breeds the same I think those are some of the things that we mentioned um before and this is what brother bradam says we contrasted this with patience he says and we should have patience with one another too we get so much impatient with one anothers and so you have to have this uh ability just kind of uh persevere and to wait on things and not always be so uh knee-jerk and reactive and then he's uses Moses as an example and we kind of read this in Numbers Chapter 20 and so this fits in beautifully and kind of draws our attention to this and I want it to kind of remain in the back of our minds as we go forward he says even one time when that Rebellion bunch of people had such impatience so they were impatient why are we out here we're all going to die you've led us into the Wilderness he says they caused Moses to do something was wrong so they impatience bred and impatience with him and he did something wrong but yet when it come to Showdown God got sick of their action he said separate yourself Moses I'll kill the whole bunch of them and start knew he threw himself in the breach and said God don't do it so this is a beautiful example of how just because you've done something wrong doesn't mean you can't get something right Moses uh in one instance does something that offends God that inspires his wrath against Moses but here God's wanting to judge in his wrath and in his anger he's wanting to judge Israel and it's Moses that says hold on wait a minute let's not be so harsh or severe and brother Bram says patience with the people that were rebelling against him we know Moses is kind of his characterized of his meekness and whatever characteristic this was with Moses in this particular instance it caused him to want to restrain severe punishment uh for the children of Israel and he says patience with the people that were rebelling against him now I I think you've probably already made the connection when we ask our children to do something they don't do it our children are rebelling against our Command against our word and what we need is we need to have the right kind of patience so that we can discipline correctly and this fits right in this wrongly disciplined disciplining in the wrong way fits right in with having patience to meet out the right kind of punishment when it's necessary so my subtitle tonight is the voice of Correction I trust you're all kind of staying with me tonight um and and comfortable and and attentive to this because I'm really really excited about I think there's just some tremendous things in here and and I want to get through um the scriptures that I have with me tonight and so I I won't be able to maybe go as deep as I'd like to on some of them but I am will not have a problem revisiting it and just reading the same scriptures and just go on another level with it um if you have a problem with it I don't mind you sharing with with me at all uh but if we cover this tonight and it doesn't seem to get very deep I believe God can just Inspire us to come right back to it and emphasize some of these things in a greater way but on this subject the voice of corre direction we're combining this uh the right using the right voice instead of inappropriately using voice we want to use the right voice and the correct correction and there's some overlap this is well I put this way there's an overlap then of this instruction and this correction and some of you have probably heard this principle before it's readily identifiable in the scripture that there's different types of discipline when we think of discipline we think punishment oh you need to be punished but in the scripture dis discipline uh is to is what you do with a disciple someone's being discipled and so it involves a lot of teaching and a lot of instruction so there's instructive uh discipline which is kind of proactive and it teaches one how to act and so you have that Concept in scripture we have that Concept in our relationships and with our children we're not just kind of sitting back waiting for them to make a mistake and saying now no that's not what you're supposed to do we need to take time to teach them the right way and then our uh there's another form of discipline which is corrective and that's kind of so you have one that's proactive and teaching them how to act then the corrective side is kind of responsively addressing something and addressing actions to permanently uh modify Behavior you know I just want to do it in that instance because there's a lot of ways that we can address bad behavior that just alleviates it for that moment but uh kind of the de deliberate intentional perseverant in uh corrective discipline is something that's want to permanently modify Behavior not just get them to stop now but impart some instruction along with it that they realize this is something I ought not to do because I know there's times we could all relate to this there's times when we can correct our children and the offense is kind of ambiguous on their part even though it's obvious to us and they don't quite understand it's not just the moment or it's not just the manner it's the whole thing that was wrong and you need to stop because you could just change context a little bit and they'll think the the behavior is fine unless you're doing it in a way to address permanent change I think it's the instructive discipline that's called formative discipline in some um some circles in some ways and that just means you it's done to form something to shape something to have a lasting influence and so that's we're looking at these two principles of Correction and instruction and I think there's a tremendous overlap with them now this is an important uh important concept to grab a hold of tonight because it's going to be this very image that I'm wanting to carry through on the voice of Correction a voice is your expression or your utterance and that may seem very obvious but to voice something is to give expression to it and it's the medium a voice is the medium or agency of expression so if you say the voice of the right or the voice of the left or the voice of this group or the voice of the family it's the one that's given expression to the needs the wants or the platform or the desires of a particular group so the voice of Correction it's the means of expressing the correction it's not just the utterance of your voice but it's the ageny of the instruction it's the agency of the correction and so it's important and what maybe we're looking at tonight is asking ourselves how how do we instruct how is it that we convey correction how is it we're conveying our uh the things that we're wanting to instruct our children how do we even to the extent of how do we express our approval maybe more importantly how do we express our disapproval is it usually through clinched teeth you knucklehead you're going to get a knuckle sandwich we really need to think about how it is that we're expressing these things because that's the voice of your instruction that's the voice of your correction so I think it's a real maybe if it's just me that se sees it you can just Pat me on the back later and say that was really nice brother eron but something very beautiful in the thought of him using this term voice it's the means of expressing something now let's start in one of our our children's favorite scripture in Proverbs chapter 22:15 and the children will just find that these are the ones that really get them going in the morning and find a tremend amount of inspiration from are these things but what I'm wanting to establish first in the scripture and I know that I could do more so even with statements in the message of the hour that amplify this to to tremendous degrees is that there is the instruction within the word of God that there's times when our children need to be physically chastised and I know there maybe some take a lot of Liberty with that but let's just recognize this in scripture foolishness is bound in the heart of of a child sin and Folly is in man Naturally by his birth to say that it's bound it means it's settled it's fixed it's rooted in his very nature so now being bound in his nature what does it want to do it wants to come to fruit wants to express itself so by birth it's in there shaping in iniquity and sended to my mother conceive me so it's there by birth foolishness is bound in the heart of a child but is how what's going to keep it from growing but the rod of Correction shall drive it far from him so correction is the means of reforming in the child's nature and I'll say this even without a birth the correct nurture of a parent can form the right kind of character in a child to have integrity to be honest to treat people decently and there's a way that we can treat our children and raise our children that's shaping them the right way so that when the time comes for them to change there's a lot less weeding of the garden that the Holy Spirit has to do for the heart to be changed by the Holy Ghost but correction is the means of driving this foolishness out of a child's heart so children need correction and all the children said thank you I can't I meant to write this down one of the one of the ancient commentaries said ignorance weakness inclination to evil Corruption of heart are maladies which accompany all men from their birth education instruction correction cure them or diminish very much their ill effects now this could just be observed in uh in the home life just observed in teaching children and disciplining them and then with the grace of God and with the aid of the Holy Spirit and with the word at our disposal instruction and correction I will diminish the ill effects of the sin that's bound up in their heart sin and Folly is bound in the heart of a child but the rod of Correction shall drive it far from him now I know that there's some revisionist the theologians that are trying to change what the rod means and there's a lot of different uh platforms out there or just way they try to describe well the rod is just a means of guiding and no doubt the rod of Correction is a means of guiding but what they want to use it is more just as a pointing stick right and they try to strip it of its real meaning but this is what the scripture says in Proverbs 23:13 to4 withhold not correction from the child for if thou beatest him with the rod he shall not die so you really it's really not a pointer and if it is it's telling you that it it's actually saying that uh don't worry about beating him because he's not going to die from it that's what it's saying withhold not correction from the child if thou beatest him with the rod it means to beatest and then in verse 14 it says beat it means to Smite to strike to receive a blow so it's speaking of chastisement punishment and it's implying some severity everybody relax I'm not not going to pull out some of these uh pull out a switch and demonstrate how you ought to to do it says withhold not correction from the child for thou beatest him with the rod he shall not die Thou shalt beat him with the rod and shalt deliver his soul from Death again this is showing that correction is necessary uh we have the St saying spare the rod spoil the child what's coming from these very scriptures because it's sparing uh the child of ruin it says if you beat him with the rod Thou shalt deliver his soul from hell so properly administered and that may be a phrase some people just completely forget but properly administered it will not kill him or bring him physical harm if you use the rod of Correction I know it's kind of harsh language but just it's the old English Kings James version it says if thou beat him with the rod if you strike him or Smite him physically in a corrective mean properly administered it's saying it's not going to kill him it's not going to bring him physical harm but it may actually save him from it we we I don't want to hurt him I don't want to harm him but actually it's saying that if you do it you'll actually save his soul from hell so it's through at least some on some level a severe punishment that trains the child to know that certain behaviors are detrimental not only to life physically but to their soul spiritually says in Proverbs 13:24 he that spareth his Rod hath his son so if you're not willing to spank as we might say or Smite or physically correct your child he that spareth his Rod hateth his son but he that loveth him chasteneth him be times that means early in the morning as much as need before the roots grow into habits he that spares the rod hates his son but he that's using it loves his son and and he's not languishing he's not waiting it's something he uses be times he's using it early he's using it as needed before this sin that's bound up in their heart can begin to express itself Proverbs chap 29:1 15 just give me a smile if you're okay and you're comfortable I know maybe some of the kids tonight are going to Gra knew it I knew it was coming to this I I warned my parents Proverbs 29:15 the rod and reproof give wisdom so the rod and reproof this correction this instruction gives wisdom but a Child Left to himself bringeth his mother to shame a child left without the rod a child left without Repro is going to disappoint his parents but worse it's going to bring them to shame because they're the ones that withhold the wisdom of the rod the wisd wi of the reproof in order to guide the child in the way that he should go and conduct himself in a way that's above reproach and by the reproof and by the rod of Correction and so I'm just kind of glancing over this very very quickly because I believe the word is clear that we must discipline our children and sometimes corporally that means to corporal punishment in a legal sense is to inflict P physical pain is punishment anybody here ever had corporal punishment in school brother Lucas anybody else we want to make sure this gets on tape I can still remember in elementary school having to go to some closet they want you to bend over and hold your ankles they pull out a paddle and they they whacked you and they spanked you in school and I know this seems like a strange concept for those who don't homeschool but it's in public schools they used to spank you I think they only do it now in homeschool but uh it's a real thing this corporal punishment uh and even to some degree you could say um um that that's what or I just I'm using that word corporal punishment but the Bible is saying that there must be some means of conveying to your children the severe severe consequences of their behavior not even so much in the moment but if that behavior continues what is it going to look like like an adult and so the Bible is advocating and saying that it is scriptural to use the rod of Correction and and if you're asking well brother Aaron you know how big does it need to be how heavy what's size bat should I be using or what what kind of leather belt should I be using I think that you ought to be ought to be very prayerful and mindful of just the type of damage that the instrument you use to spank your children can cause and the things I'm talking about tonight will hopefully curtail some of the knee-jerk uh punitive discipline we meet out sometimes with the rod in justified by scripture we need to be very thoughtful and careful about this because it's in the word but the word is not completely just leaving it up to us hey if you think it needs to bruise them if you think they need to bleed do what you need as a parent the Bible is not telling us uh no pain no gain to the inth degree but it's telling us that physically spanking your children is a principle in the word of God that can be used to benefit the child and if it you think I'm trying if it looks like I'm trying to be very balancing tonight I am now I'm going to give you a statement here in a moment and I'll ceue it up here in just a second but there's a scientific study and it was kind of an aggregation an analysis covering over 50 years of scientific studies and uh which surveyed and included more than 160,000 children and it came to this conclusion that if children are physically punished as a child I guess that kind of repetitive if you're physically punished as a child you're more likely to develop mental health problems and some of us are saying I knew there was a explanation for this but in the if a child is physically punished they're saying it's that actual treatment as a child that gives rise to mental health problems uh they've also used it to explain antisocial behaviors and all sorts of maladies and mental illnesses uh and they're kind of trying to connect it to uh the child receiving physical punishment as they were raised and this is the statement I wanted you to read it says we found that spanking was associated with unintended detrimental outcomes and was not associated with the more immediate or long long-term compliance which are parents intended outcomes when they discipline their children how kind right they're saying that they're at least giving the credit to the parent that when they discipline their children through spanking that the what they're intending to do is to bring both immediate and long-term compliance they're wanting to produce obedience within their children but they're saying we found this is what science has found and and if you can't tell the little icon we use a Bible for scriptures we use a picture of brother Brandon for quotes and I have Bill NY the science guy for all the scientists tonight and so if you've lost all confidence in this conclusion I don't uh I I understand but it says we found that spanking was associated with unintended detrimental outcomes so they actually showing us that CH parents who with the right kind of motive in their heart to produce immediate compliance or this is what they're trying to achieve is compliance uh immediate and long term that it's not producing what they wanted but it actually produced unintended detrimental outcomes and one of those being that later on in life there's mental health problems antisocial behaviors and they said children who were physically punished were more likely to endorse hitting as a means of resolving their conflicts with peers and siblings and you could take issue with the studies but I could produce I could spend the the rest of the year on Wednesday nights producing to you study after study after study that's trying to say physically spanking your children is wrong it's bad and you shouldn't do it any anybody heard these arguments before these studies are out there you're going to hear them on all sorts of Networks you're going to see them on the Internet you're going to read them everywhere they're saying that when you spank your children it produces unintended outcomes mental health problems and uh uh all sorts of mental illnesses and and rage and Temperance says that when children are physically punished they're more likely to use hidden as a means of resolving conflicts so there they're actually looking it within the context of children that if you use corporal punishment to correct or discipline your child that they will in turn use hitting and punching uh in their disagreements with their peers and their siblings so the the scientist would tell you that if your child your son or your daughter is kicking or punching or slapping or biting uh their siblings they might ask well do you physically spank your children to correct them and you say well yes I actually do that says well that could be the cause of this Behavior now I I've just kind of set that up and I haven't I haven't done it just to spike it down necessarily but let me say this the word is not wrong so what is wrong this is what I want you well I I'm getting some answers but I don't mean to disagree and turn this into a conversation science isn't wrong science goes based on things that are observable and can be repeated and over 50 years of studies and over 160,000 children even I as a faith-based Believer think science probably isn't wrong and even our own experiences have taught us no I don't think it's wrong so what's wrong how can reality contradict God's principle because think of this I I want you to think very very deeply about this physical pain alone will not produce the results that are proposed by scripture don't SP spoil this child by sparing the rod spank your children beat him with the rod don't worry he won't die beat him with the rod Thou shalt beat him with the rod and deliver his soul from hell and we take that's a directive I need to beat my child but it's not just saying that Pain by itself is going to deliver the child's soul from hell so it's not it's not a failure of the word of God and it's not even a failure of science they're observing what misapplying the word of God has produced in generations of children it's a failure of adop of adopting the wisdom and the nature of the word and then misapplying the word principle you can't just just take something in the word of God and then take the nature and the principle of it that's behind it or the the the nature of it and try to apply it and achieve the right kind of results we could look at organized religion and science would tell us it's a joke and you know what we would say science is right Proverbs chap 15 veres 1 to5 it's a failure of adopting wisdom the wisdom of the word the nature of the word to misuse the the word Proverbs 15 verses 1 to5 now I I'd like to spend more time on this but just kind of catch this a soft answer turneth away wrath but Grievious words stir up anger the tongue of the wise useth knowledge AR right but the mouth of fools porth out foolishness the eyes of the Lord are in every place beholding the evil and the good a wholesome tongue is a tree of life but perverseness therein is a breach in the spirit that's just how words can um Can inflict pain or can bring healing a wholesome tongue is a tree of life but perverseness therein is a breach in the spirit a fool and notice what it arrives at a fool despiseth his father's instruction but he that regardeth reproof is prudent all these different these scriptures one two 3 four they're all connected to instruction they're all related to correction and what I want you to recognize is that in instructing in reproof the voice is a crucial part if a wholesome and wise tongue is missing if a wholesome voice if a wise voice is missing then the correction is just merely pain soft answer turns away wrath Grievous words but Grievous words stir the anger it's like a point Counterpoint soft answer turns away with wrath but Grievous words will stir up anger a tongue of the wise usth knowledge correctly but the mouth of the Fool porth Out foolishness a wholesome tongue is a tree of life but a perverted tongue is a breach in the spirit so it says a fool despises his father's instru instruction but regardeth but he that regardeth Repro is prudent it's saying that we've got to be sure that our instruction our correction harmonizes with a soft answer a tongue of the wise a wholesome tongue so a wholesome and wise voice if it's missing then our correction physical correction is just merely pain worse yet if the wrong voice is used it compounds and deepens the pain so you have to have this soft answer the tongue of the wise the wholesome tongue it's what's going to it needs to be it's there as an aid in the correcting and so let's just say you withhold that then it's it's all you're doing is inflicting pain if you saw your child doing something wrong and you just went by and you know hit them and then kept going the only thing that registered is my parent just hit me and that hurt right so there all you've done is inflicted them with pain and so now just think of it this way if you add to that insult you add to that aggravating words and UNG Grievious words and perverseness in the tongue and foolish pouring out then it compounds and deepens that physical pain saying a soft answer turneth away wrath it's talking about the right response and in the Statue of a perfect man brother B is saying that Bible Temperance is how to answer back that's what Bible Temperance is it doesn't escalate uh this past week we did a devotion on Monday night just at the Children's request they suggested the topics Monday night was on antagonism and then the next night was on temper Temperance and they both are you know are work together how an antagonist is trying to escalate conflict it is trying to stir up strife and then Temperance is deescalation having the right answer and and think of it how the Bible is saying the soft answer turns away wrath but it's Grievous words that stir up anger and Colossians 3:21 and also in Ephesians says fathers provoke not your children to anger lest they be discouraged what's the agency of provoking anger in your child it may not be the physical punishment but it's the words that we use towards our children that frustrate and harbor within them here the anger and the Wrath because it says a soft answer turns wrath away in Proverbs 29: 17-22 he says correct thy son and he shall give thee rest and there's there's a whole lot going here so you just have to read it very closely with me and I just want to allude to the the kind of the subject as overall correct thy son and he shall give thee rest y he shall give Delight unto thy Soul so if you withhold correction the Bible says he's going to be a shame to you where there is no vision the people perish but he that keepeth the law happy is he that's a very uh familiar scripture to us so this is being proactive having a vision thinking long term in terms of how you're treating your child and what you're teaching what it's going to produce a a servant will not be corrected by words for though he understandeth he will not answer see us thou a man that is Hasty in his words there's no there is more hope of a fool than of him there's the temperance restraint not just answering back immediately holding your tongue he that delicately bringeth up his servant from a child shall have him become his son at length there's different interpretations of this that some I I've read some places where they say that if you are bringing up your child in the right way then you get him as a son that sounds nice and certainly maybe that's maybe a compound application but it's actually saying that if you don't treat them the right way they'll become insolent they'll get to the place to where they feel entitled and you'll never be able to get them to work for you it's interesting isn't it very interesting and so it says if you delicately bring up your servant he you'll have him as a son at length eventually he's going to feel he has a right to your table he has do this and do that do whatever he wants an angry man stirreth up strife and a furious man aboundeth in transgression now just look at how these things there's different ways of connecting these pieces together correct your son he give you rest see how a man that's just Hasty with words the servant will not be corrected by words only and if you delicately bring up your servant he becomes a son and angry man stirreth up Strife a furious man aboundeth in transgression so addressing a balance it related specifically to servants a firmness and a sternness and kind of the pampering and spoiling that you might do of a servant there has to be some balance you can't just be real harsh and stirring up anger and just spewing off and saying whatever you want but you also can't just be so tender and delicate to where it doesn't there there's no consciousness of consequence for their behavior excuse me and so if I could say this the Bible's saying we we must not be harsh but we can't be delicate we we must be Stern but not necessarily severe and so when we correct we must do it and we would do words as necessary to correct and use the rod as necessary to correct but never with anger this is what the Bible's telling us you must correct you must train you must discipline and you you're going to use words mostly and there's times you're going to have to use the rod but it should never be with anger ver 2911 a fool utth all his mind but a wise man keepeth it in till afterwards may seem uh the thought behind this may seem to be missing on its face but a fool expresses his anger and frustration immediately that's what it's saying that fool utth all his mind he he quick to express his rage and his disappointment and how you just made them feel it there's one translation that says it BR he brings out his wrath the fool brings out his wrath and just says it he cannot restrain it he cannot hide it it's it's just something he does but it says a wise man keepeth it end until afterwards till it passes what a wise person will do is restrain their passion in the moment they realize I'm angry I'm upset I probably shouldn't say anything right now wait till I cool off a little bit and then have a discussion about it and they wait until it passes maybe to address the issue but a fool just spews off his words just says he stirs up a furious man to Bound in a transgression because he just brings out his wrath the Bible says in Proverbs 12:18 there is that speaketh like the piercings of a sword but the tongue of the wise is Health it's talking about the just the Reckless talk where words become swords and they pierce and they thrust and they stab and they wound there's a way of speaking there's a tongue that a reckless way of talking that hurts so way of speaking that causes pain and causes injury but the tongue of the wise is health so words can hurt or words can heal words can cause further wounding or words can promote amending of that which is broken now this is where I I I realize tonight we're making very really good time on this so maybe I'd be able to slow down a little bit on some of this but it's at this point I want you to think about these principles we just shared and in light of the voice of Correction is the is the title but we've established that we must use the rod to correct our children but science tells us look what it's produced and we realize that if science says the punishment's wrong the physical punishment's wrong I would agree in that sense science is wrong but they're not wrong about what they've observed right because in some ways you read it they're just saying physical physical punishment corporal punishment has produced these outcomes and it's true in many ways it's not just a correlation there seems to be some causation to the behavior that's expressed to the children but we look at the word of God and says but the word says we ought to do it so then we have to look deeper at what the problem is because it's not just say well the problem is in the studies or uh the problem is this the problem's that how has the punishment been administered again it's not just spanking the child but there's a whole concept to it because you just take one scripture and it says you know beat him with the rod and he shall not die but keep continue to read in the Proverbs that kind of expresses the whole reality of parenting it's saying a soft answer turneth away wrath the tongue of the wise uses knowledge are right correct thy son you can't don't be delicate but don't be harsh our words so our voice which is the very words we use are even our demeanor our attitude when we're doing it it gives color to our correction say well I'm just spanking my child but what we're saying how we're saying it how we're doing it our tone our volume all those things gives context to the punishment and therefore that's what overall gives meaning to what you've just done now in our minds we may be thinking well if I just spank them the Bible says to spare not the rod uh otherwise you're going to ruin your child and we developed this concept from these things and and if I love my son I'm going to spank him and the Bible says bear chastisement and and I'm going to spank my children and we have this principle in our hearts and our minds and so we may see that very clearly but if in the ministering the punishment the right kind of atmosphere and the right kind of words aren't used and the whole scene creates a different kind of context our children aren't being benefited by the use of that principle to produce what the scripture says it will produce because our words have Chang the meaning for them the voice can either Aid in what you're trying to accomplish it can help you in your instruction help you in your correction or it can undermine it words can build up or they can tear down just just want to uh kind of Point our direction towards some of these statements in the scripture Ephesians 4:29 let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth now that's conversation words and things that tend to destroy costic things Eros corrosive things and it say let not these things things come out of your mouth now would that not apply to how we talk to one another does it not apply to how we would talk to our children let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that which is good to the use of edifying that it may Minister Grace unto the hears this is all leading up to the very instructions that he gives not only in marriage but to our children how it says provoke not your children to wrath but bring them up in the nurture and the admonition of the Lord does this not hearken back to let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but Talk use a language use a tongue that edifies that ministers Grace to those that hear in Colossians chapter 4: 6 let your speech be all way with Grace seasoned with salt that ye may know how you ought to answer every man if we merely put that in the context of what am I going to say to the cashier when they ask me why I don't cut my hair why I'm wearing a skirt that my Sal speech be seasoned with uh salt it may may have Grace in the way that I answer this question perfect application but what about to one another what about at home what about in dealing with our children let your speech always be seasoned with salt Let It Be always with Grace let it let it be graceful let it be seasoned with salt that you may that it may give you the right response know how to respond because that's what Temperance is at the end of the day is the right response we've touched on this principle so I I didn't use the scripture tonight but it's in Ephesians chapter 4 where it's talking about the perfecting of the Saints a and the work of the ministry and it says speaking the truth in love this just said let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth and it's just said that God's going to give you these different offices and these different gifts that speaking the truth in love we may grow up into him in all things so it's not just merely speaking the truth to our children but it must be done in love and we can't uh we can't swap it out and just speaking the truth is love or speaking the truth that proves I love you but no the truth has to be spoken in love to be fruitful says let your speech be all with with Grace seasoned with salt what does salt do it preserves from corruption so this is how you keep from having corrupt communication you've seasoned it so your voice actually talking about inappropriately using voice in the context of even disciplining the wrong way inappropriately using voice your voice sets the tone your your voice is going to set the atmosphere of the attitude there's a way that even within oh we recognize this that even within dramas or plays or or or or movies that there can be a beautifully beautiful bolic scene or something beautiful and I oh well isn't that well that's a beautiful house or oh this is beautiful but all you need to do is start playing some ominous music right and immediately the scene changes all by the music that's being played and it creates a tone it sets certain expectations and and you get this sense something's bad's about to happen and and it's just the it's the music it's the tone it's the buildup and so our voice is the soundtrack our attitudes and what we're saying that's kind of creating the whole image you're the you're the producer you're the director you're the actor you're the one that's bringing all these elements together and your child is observing the correction as it comes to them and so your voice is is setting the tone for the correction for the discipline and so then how we express it is part of the standard it matters the manner in which we express the matter speaking the truth in love it matters the manner in which you express the matter James chapter 3:6 again I'm just wanting us to consider the multiple scriptures I know some of you tonight are thinking of a dozen other ones that I should have used James chapter 3: 6 the tongue is a fire a world of iniquity so is the tongue among our members that it defileth the whole body and Seth on fire the course of Nature and it is set on fire of hell that's what this tongue can do that little Rudder can steer the ships think about what this tongue can do it's our it's our voice it's our our tongue that gives voice to our thoughts it's our thoughts that we meditate on then we give voice to it and it actually creates actions we're taught that our body will become subject to our confession I'm miserable I'm depressed I'm miserable I'm depressed well if you weren't you will be eventually right there's some there's power in the tongue think of how powerful this tongue is and so the tongue must be speaking the right things must be saying the right things must have a positive uh uh positive tone to it the subject matter even the tone and the motive behind it everything it has to that has to be considered when we're disciplining I think we've touched on this before but if you if you're angry when you correct then anger is going to be swn into that the frustration and anger it kind of colors our correction it colors and paints our discipline and it's in the very anger that we're expressing in our agitation and our frustration if that's if that's what's kind of coloring Us in the moment and that's what we're acting on this impulse and this frustration and we act out of that we might be wanting to achieve some uh immediate correction but also some long-term change of behavior but all we've done is swn into our children by our voice the same frustration and the same disappointment I make our entire effort to correct ineffective will you bear with me just a little bit more I know this is uh very simple things I think it's important a voice of Correction when I say the voice of Correction I'm talking about the mood you're in uh the words you use your temperament your your tone your volume I know it's hard enough to know when you ought to spank and when you shouldn't spank or what to correct for and how frequently and how often I know it's very very hard but it must be right your voice must be right when you're disciplining it's uh it's a challenge as a parent to know when to punish and what is appropriate but there's one thing I think we can get right and that's the voice there's a study done at Harvard they said parents who yell frequently are the mo ones who most are like who are most likely to hit frequently about the right use of the voice people who yell are more likely to hit they said children who are spanked and yelled at are more prone to spank and yell at their own children and they're not really making a distinction they're they're identifying the corporal punishment and the yelling that people who yell tend to spank now how do you think that's going to work out if things are being escalated with the voice and the tones getting louder and louder and it escalates to yelling and then it's in the yelling that they spank do we think that's going to achieve the right kind of attitude in our children what does it produce in the end science observes it and says these are a bunch of neurotics these are a bunch of crazy kids these are people that don't like uh their parents and they don't like instruction it's because the way that it's administered and they're connecting the yelling with the negative consequences of punishment this is what they're recognizing when they see this and there's a lot of very very re Recent research and this is it's just starting to add up that verbal abuse of children can be just as destructive emotionally as physical and sexual abuse and this may seem like a huge shock but it's saying that verbal abuse of children can be just as damaging emotionally as physical and sexual abuse that's staggering to think that but it's absolutely true and it's supported by scripture just how powerful the tongue is there was a study done by the University of Maryland go herps children who see their parents verbally abusing each other or more likely to be depressed or anxious and to experience more interpersonal problems of their own verbal aggression between the parents was more traumatic to Children than physical violence between parents so we might feel pretty good right that we don't beat our spouse and I I think that's a good thing but notice what it says about the way you can interact with your word words and just how insecure it can make a child feel in the way that we talk to one another this is kind of seven bad habits of highly and effective parents the way that we can talk to one another undermines the de proper development of our children children who see their parents arguing verbally abusing each other not just arguing but verbally abusing each other are more likely to be anxious and depressed and have more interpersonal problems why because something in the the security is broken there's something wrong there's a breach in the home there's something that has gone sideways and and there something that must be fixed Ephesians chapter 4: 31 and 32 just trying to find a statement here that I just realize I don't have with me and I just want to be able to read it maybe tonight Ephesians chapter 4: 31- 32 it says let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and evil speaking be put away from you with all malice this is again this is in Ephesians chapter 4 this is right here in the uh in the context of corrupt communication and edif speaking things that are edifying and even be building up to instructions in marriage and instructions to Children let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and evil speaking be put away from you with all malice and be ye kind one to another tenderhearted forgiving one another even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you the image of God's patient love ought to Inspire is if we can consider how that God loves us and how the love of Christ is expressed to us and just what it's achieving in our lives that's the example of how that we ought to treat our children it struck me so deeply and so profoundly today that when the Bible is teaching us as parents and we read in the Proverbs and it's telling us all the things that we must do you realize that what God is telling us to do and that it would be right is what he does it's expressive of God's nature if he's saying don't do this do that then it's something about the way that what God would do and how he acts and it helps us to understand how the he is towards us as his children and when we read this that go even as God for Christ's sake have forgiven us that it ought to in turn allow us to be begin to look at one another differently behave towards one another differently and it's saying very clearly bitterness wrath and anger and clamor and evil speaking needs to be put away from us and I'm wanting us to associate that with the tongue that we use with our children our speech will season our discipline so let's season it with love we are to correct our children and we're to do it physically at times but spanking is not just an opportunity to vent your frustration it never is and looking at this and zeroing in on this idea of inappropriately using voice when you yell and you use harsh words they're result it's a result of frustration it's the result of this bitterness this wrath this anger and clamor and evil speaking when we yell or we use harsh words it's something that's been bubbling up and one of the downsides it's just one of them it's one of the biggest ones and this is just very practical one of the downsides to yelling it trains our children to wait until we're angry or loud enough before they react if you've established this rhythm with your CH your your your your kids your children and to where it's like you you you say it and you have to escalate then they learn and they're not they're not evil about it they've just realized wow when they raise their voice and they get mad that's when they really mean it and that's when there's consequence you've trained them that way you might want to say Well they're just stubborn and they're just rebellious no you taught them from a particular age that when you ask them to do something and they don't do it they realize okay maybe that was just a suggestion when there it's not de with immediately right they're thinking oh okay well then they asked me to do it they never followed up they never said anything and you've trained them early on before they can fully appreciate everything that's happening that it's not until you raise your voice that you have to do it because it's only then that punishment comes and so you're thinking man these children are stubborn no you've you're a good trainer right because it's only after you yell that you spank and that's the only point at which they thought you better get it done so when you've trained TR them correctly they obey when you yell right just think about the pract how practical it is once you've trained them correctly as soon as you yell they do it because it's exactly how you've taught them to act could we just have a breakout session on that and think about that for a while to me that that's I wish I wish that we had standing room only tonight to hear that so important to understand this I'd like to go into this more but I want to try to wrap this up just when we use loud aggressive tones negative tones got to be very careful that even when we're correcting there may seem to be it may seem to be taking away something but it must be positive in the way that you do it it's a way that you can lead with building up it's a way you can address a situation where you kind of you create that security in their heart that are in the safe place there someone that's mindful of me and has my best in mind is trying to promote the right kind of virtue there's a way that you can build up it's something that sister Elizabeth has spoken very highly about father how if he ever corrected he didn't lead with it there was a way he built you up and I'm proud of you and you're trying hard you're doing this you're doing that and then it builds the right kind of atmosphere to then bring in the area that needs to be addressed and so there it's more effective that way because if you're negative in how you lead it can create resentment at a very least maybe resistance and maybe at worst passive aggressiveness because there's this bitterness that's being born in their hearts there's there's ways that we can become we can just nag when we nag to our children it conditions them to ignore us and again not evil but because subconsciously if we nag subconsciously they know reminders will come this is just human psychology I I I if anything we should take away from this is these children we have here tonight are precious and no matter how stubborn and rebellious they might be if we could just recognize and this is where we could get into with holding Grace Just recognize they're the product of your nature and your nurture at this point if any we said 100% of the blame rest on me not for all of you but for mine at least I'm the one I give them the nature and I'm the one that's nurturing them and to realize that there's times when we are nagging and the nagging is just subconsciously they realize because of the the the Cadence and the Rhythm with which I'm met with this request without anything else changing then they know Mom will remind me Mom will remind me dad will remind me dad will remind me and we're actually conditioning them just to ignore us initially because when it really matters the alarm will go off may just maybe make reference to this and try to close with in in the Book of Numbers there's a way that we can use we've heard of positive reinforcement there's a way that we can negatively reinforce things and the wrong voice when we correct can encourage the very everything you're trying to correct you you the the you're meeting out some sort of punishment in order to correct a particular Behavior but your voice promotes it there's a way that we can talk to our children to say you're always doing this or you never do that and what we do is we begin to Define them by the issue begin to Define them by their mistake Define them by the problem and if we're not careful that there the mistake becomes a sentence and I'm not talking about grammar I'm talking about jail talking about bondage become identified by it and they live under it I've heard I I remember here recently uh been over a couple a couple years ago now we're meeting some of the neighbors and one of the kids just a young kid says yeah I'm the clumsy one in the family I'm the cluts I'm the one that's always banging in into things and immediately you could tell that's just what he's always been told I mean no kid sits down at 8 years old and goes what am I yeah I'm the cluts of the family don't even know you probably know what that was right but there's a way that we talk to him yeah he's the problem child he's the one that gives me trouble well he's the stubborn one and she's the catty one and we just kind of Define them that way and they just accept it yeah I'm the one that's always smarting off yeah I'm I'm the one that always gets angry and breaks things and they don't want to make you a liar right and so the next time there's an opportunity to get out your inner rage monster you break something you're like am I doing it right Dad you said I'm the angry one did I get it your words have so much weight so much power remember in the beginning we read in where brother bam says in wrongly about wrongly disciplining or we were using it in the context of t uh patience in wrongly discipline he says even one time when that Rebellion bunch of people had such impatience they caused Moses to do something that was wrong now if you want to go back and look at Numbers Chapter 20 I think I do have these verses here hopefully Numbers Chapter 20: 7 we'll read to verse 12 follow this I lost sight of my time am I doing good on time okay thank you and the word the Lord spake unto Moses saying catch this take the rod and gather thou the assembly together thou and Aaron thy brother and speak ye under the rock before their eyes and it shall give forth his water and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock so Thou shalt give the congregation and their Beast drink now we read this and if it seems to be somewhat ambiguous maybe we could argue that maybe the instructions weren't very clear but we know that what God was asking him to do was to have the rod in his possession standing before the people and that Moses was to speak to the Rock and by the spoken word water would come forth out of a rock in verse n it starts out well and Moses took the rod from before the Lord as he was as he commanded him and Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together before the Rock and now he's to speak to the rock this inanimate object this hard unmovable object that's what God told him to to doce to speak under the rock so Moses does exactly what God says and what does he do here now ye Rebels must we fetch your water out of this rock Moses lifted up his hand and with his Rod he smoked the rock twice the water came out abundantly and the congregation drank and their Beast also now I I Lord willing I want to pick up on this on Sunday in Christ my healer the the the way these two things have come together uh and even not being able to minister Sunday the way this begins to link up to me is very very exciting for me as a pastor but notice he smoked the rock twice and got the results that God said he was to have there's still water still Supernatural enough water came out to water them they drank and their Beast also but notice God's immediate response and God and the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron because ye believed me not to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel there was something about the act at this moment that was to sanctify God in the eyes of the children of Israel that that the focus wouldn't so much be on Moses and his motion but it would have to be in something Supernatural beyond the element of man therefore you shall not bring this Congregation of land which I have given them wow here's Moses who's led him up this far and because of this he can't enter into the promised land he said take the rod but speak to the Rock God has created a very deep and Powerful image in this that Moses breaks and so when he breaks it it it's such an offense that God in his in his wrath and his anger his retribution he deprives Moses of that opportunity of entering in and bringing the children into into the promised land now in Exodus chapter 17 verses 5 and six I think I may have these this is when this is early on in The Exodus and the Lord spake unto Moses go on before the people and take with thee of the Elders of Israel and thy rod so again just as he had said before uh take the rod and gather the people together and speak to the children of Israel if you go back earlier he said take the rod wherewith thou smot us the river take in thy hand and go behold I will stand before thee upon the rock in Horeb and thou shalt Smite The Rock and there shall come water out of it that the people may drink and Moses did so in the sight of the Elders of Israel now numbers 20 that I want you to do this that I might be Sanctified in the eyes of the children of Israel now I'm still talking about this seven bad habits of highly and effective parents this is still kids eat free I know maybe there's a lot of things that seem to be colliding in their minds right now so many beautifully Rich principles in The Exodus in the use of God's gifts and His prophets but recognize now as we bring Numbers Chapter 20 and Exodus chapter 17 together early on in The Exodus when the children of Israel as a nation are young in this Exodus the rod was used to Smite The Rock Early in their training early in them learning what this journey was going to be about early in forming them to be able to take possession of the promised land Moses took the rod and he struck the rock to get something out of the Rock and it's demonstrative of our early training of a child using the rod to correct in the physical punishment but in numbers 20 now 40 years later God tells them to take the rod so it's not as if it's been forsaken it Still Remains a part of this image it Still Remains as a part of the Vindication and the building up it it's it's part of thinking through this that we've arrived at this moment for this purpose so the rod is still part of the picture but he's not to use the rod he tells them to speak to the Rock speak to it don't Smite it and in one of the ancient mid rashes in in the Hebrew and and their teachings and their development ment of the Torah one of these early early the one on numbers uh chapter 20 it says when a child is small his teacher hits him and educates him but when he grows up he corrects him with words so there's a time there's a time for it but then there comes a moment and this is the part I hope you can really catch because I've preached myself into a problem it's really late now and I need to wrap this up but this is the moment now if you've used the you've used the rod that you use it with the child but there comes a time when you have to oh when he grows up you correct with your words so let's look at Moses for a second and consider this Moses is told to take the rod and speak to the Rock but what did he do he used his voice to Smite the people he stands before the car you don't find where God says speak to the stiff Israelites tell them they won't be able to enter in you certainly find it where God told them to use words of judgment to the children of Israel but he never told them to tell them that they were stiff necked he never told them to say they were hard-hearted but Moses gets up there seemingly in his impatience a and his anger he stands up there with the rod and when he was to speak to the Rock he spoke to their hearts and he said hear now ye rebeles he spoke to them with words and used his words to hurt and his words words to harm when he ought to have spoken to the Rock and in the beautiful way that the story unfolds and to use this image that when a child is small you use the rod to teach him and to educate him but when he grows up you have to use words to correct them with the rod of Correction having been established with discipline having been established with Exodus chapter 17 even using the rod to open up the the Red Sea now he could speak more effectively this is what I want you to to recognize that for Moses it was his own bitter words that betrayed his use of the rod it's his anger it's his frustration so what did he do he smoted it twice what's he doing there there's something being broken in this there's an image that's failing he failed in his words and because he failed in his words he resorted to being physical and when I what I'm wanting to end on this the voice of Correction there's going to come a time we will only be able to use words to correct come a time when you only have your words to correct your child and so you want to be sure that you haven't tainted them when that's all you have to use we need to be wise in how we form our children's sensitivity and their perception of that voice of Correction because Moses in that moment resorted to using the rod when all he haded to do was use his words it already it may already be there in this family that if I was someone who liked to get physical and push my kids around it might already be so in my family that if my son wanted to whoop me he could so where's the family then if you relied on being physically stronger it could inflict a greater amount of pain through your through physical punishment what happens when all you have left is words then the damage you cause is much deeper and much greater and it wounds even harder because you'll never see the scars that are being formed when you can't just physically throw your weight around oh I know this has maybe just gotten heavy brother brand makes the state in the sermon the uncertain sound he says we don't have any more security of the home says send your children to school what they do what do they teach them out there many times too many times they teach them we come from apes well we don't believe that no and if a man's no more than an animal then eat drink and be married that's what makes so many juvenile delinquents what we teach them we teach them that they're animals you treat them like animals he says that's what makes so many crimes committed because if people are no more than an animal it makes them act like an animal listen to this we got to tell them he's a Son of God born for the kingdom of God and he is somebody we got to use our language to build we got to use our language to praise we got to use our language tell them speak a positive gospel speak positive things create that atmosphere I'm only correcting you because the potential that's bound up in your heart I'm doing this because I want to bring out the best in you create that kind of security because he says we've lost Security in the home said well I'm going to bring security back we're going to start spanking no you'll make it even more insecure if you're not fostering the right kind of environment with your words and your demeanor got to tell him he's a Son of God born for the kingdom of God and he is somebody I think it was Sister Tasha brother jueles daughter every night when she'd pray for her son she'd tell him you're a mighty man of Valor she'd tell him every night son you're a mighty man of Valor then one day he said Mama you're a mighty man of Valor she said no I'm not honey and he goes don't you believe that lie of the devil but that's what we got to speak to our children we got to speak to them in a way that builds them up and brings that kind of security amen God bless you can we stand together tonight thank you for being patient with me the image of Moses hitting the people with his words and then using the rock excuse me the rod inappropriately I hope it can stay with us to realize that it's our words that kind of create the atmosphere and if we use the wrong words now with the rod the rod can be present but our words we won't have the words the context the voice of Correction to achieve the right result and as long as we feel that we have that hand that we can misuse it hope it makes sense to you tonight I really pray that it it's making sense for you could we bow our heads in a word of Prayer would there be a hand that would want to be raised and say Lord help me tonight I realized that in the congregation tonight there's many who know the days of raising their children has passed and there may seem to be some regret and maybe there's um a way that the devil would want to kind of wind that into your spirit you know you can just tell the Lord you're sorry say Lord forgive me you could even apologize to your children and say you know I didn't always do it the right way and just know that with God he never loses hope regarding your success God has a an unrelenting love for us as his children that no matter how long this continues he's never going to give up on you and if you can accept that for yourself and be confident that in yourself I think you can help heal wounds in our hearts stabilize us in our spirits and help us to have the right kind of attitude towards our children let's pray tonight as we pray let's remember brother Burley Williams in prayer he's had an accident today with his nail gun and the nail I don't know exactly how it happened but he was shot in the eye with his nail gun and uh by God's grace the surgery went well his Pastor brother Michel or his former Pastor brother Mike altig said that uh the injury won't affect his eyesight and so they're very grateful with how the surgery went he's at home resting but let's pray for brother Burley real man of God a real servant Pastor there in Belton if you have a need tonight just lift your hand before the Lord soften my heart with oil Lord as I mentioned already Lord forgive me where I've done wrong I know my children know how relevant this is for me as a father I embrace it I want to live the right kind of life I want to use the right kind of words I look at my children tonight and I say in my heart it's not too late to do it right my gracious Heavenly Father tonight as we stand before you we thank you Lord for your grace your goodness your kindness Lord instead of focusing on my failures tonight as a parent I want to focus on your success as my heavenly father because tonight Lord you spoke to me in a way that met me in my need and corrected me and even helped me to understand better why I am what I am and why I've struggled or why I've suffered and Lord I'm speaking for all of us tonight that there's something very enlightening and something very helpful and to think that you love me enough to come by my way and speak these things to me these relevant things impart these things to me I know you care Lord you're not just using the word as a codal you're not just using the Bible as a a weapon or this message can be used to heal when others have used it to hurt and I pray Lord that you could help us today to focus right now in this prayer focus on your love for us your goodness and your kindness that Lord you have been there all the time you've been patient you've been kind we understand Lord that you have used used pain and suffering you've allowed us to endure great hurts and you've put us through great Affliction even as you did the children of Israel but you did it Lord for our good the Bible tells us for our profit for the betterment Lord we see the gain we see the we lift up now these hands though with this heaviness in heart we can lift up our hands and thank you for chastisement thank you for correction Lord we're focusing tonight on your goodness towards us as children Lord if we could do that Lord may it give us may there be May me recognize a Grace for ourselves where we have fallen so short as parents towards our own children those hearts and those lives are so precious Lord I see certain instincts and behaviors in my children and there might be things that I could get frustrated at and I could make comments about and I can write this write out a sentence I could Define them by that issue but Lord could it be that there I've only used my nature and my nurture to train them to be that way and that if I will just use the nurture and admonition of the Lord if I will just dig deep and use the care of the scripture and take the wisdom and the nature of the word and apply these principles that I can drive that very thing away from them Lord May there be a supernatural Deliverance T tonight Lord of the the negative instincts we have to reinforce in the wrong way and maybe Lord kind of the knee-jerk response to things to use the voice or to yell Lord May there just be a tendering uh tenderizing of our Spirits Lord Lord dial it down from 13 Lord bring our volume down let May things just equalize better within our homes because Lord we realize that if we yell frequently we're more likely to hit frequently a way that that language and that voice and that tone create the whole the wrong perception of the correction then our children walk out and they repeat those behaviors themselves Lord let's break the cycle I pray help us to break the cycle may we do it in our homes as fathers may we do it as a church Lord in the way that we handle the word of God may we break these negative Cycles Lord for these people tonight so attentive and so Gra gracious I pray that you bless them and help them and all that they Endeavor to do take the young people here Lord not married one day going to be mothers one day going to be fathers may seem irrelevant to them now may something take hold in their spirits that early on Lord they can train their child up in the way that it should go maybe we use these principles and how we relate to one another lord they're not lost in our Advanced age and our years Lord and our Rel relationships with one another let us make these things applicable granted I pray tonight as we commit the people to you bless your servant brother Burley Williams Lord
