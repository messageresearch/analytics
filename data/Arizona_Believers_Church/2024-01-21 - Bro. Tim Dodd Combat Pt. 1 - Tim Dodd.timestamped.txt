[0:00] now we're living
[0:01] in times that we see many things
[0:05] unfolding in the world that
[0:07] perhaps create questions in our mind of
[0:11] exactly how much time we have left on
[0:13] the face of the Earth we see a nation
[0:15] like Israel in the midst of a struggle
[0:19] and in a battle against their enemies we
[0:22] see demon forces being loosed and and
[0:26] you know people might have their opinion
[0:29] of what
[0:30] happened uh there in Israel a little
[0:33] over 100 days ago and the the evil
[0:36] events that
[0:38] unfolded but let me say this about it
[0:40] that the reason that they were caught
[0:43] off guard is because they don't have a
[0:47] prophet they didn't have eyes to see
[0:49] what was about to unfold in their midst
[0:53] they didn't have someone to warn them of
[0:55] events and and show exactly uh what they
[0:58] ought to be doing they're instead of
[1:01] relying upon education relying upon
[1:03] military relying upon all of these
[1:05] things which will fail the the Mad of
[1:09] the intelligence agency might be a the
[1:12] one of the greatest intelligence
[1:14] agencies in the world but nevertheless
[1:16] they failed you know all of those things
[1:20] God is the one that orchestrates events
[1:23] God is the one that allows events God is
[1:26] the one that oversees events and he
[1:29] reveals them to whom he will and we had
[1:32] a prophet messenger in this hour that
[1:35] came to uh advise or to declare to the
[1:38] Bride of Jesus Christ exactly what day
[1:42] we're living in exactly what we would
[1:45] need in this day that he would show us
[1:48] how God is moving because in the in the
[1:51] opening of the word and in the lamb
[1:53] taking the book we would not know that
[1:56] the lamb took the book unless there was
[1:58] a prophet that could what had eyes to
[2:01] see that could declare to us that the
[2:04] lamb has taken the book that the seals
[2:08] have been opened that the mystery has
[2:10] been unveiled so these are all integral
[2:13] parts of what God is doing and we're in
[2:15] the middle of end time unfolding
[2:18] events a and we see now Israel as a
[2:22] nation now we're privileged because we
[2:24] can look back because of the word of God
[2:26] and we can see Israel coming out of
[2:28] Egypt we can see Israel going through
[2:31] the Wilderness we can see God
[2:34] establishing Worship in the nation of
[2:37] Israel and we know the Old Testament is
[2:41] Shadows of and types of greater things
[2:44] to come we know the Book of Revelation
[2:46] where we read is a book of
[2:49] symbols I always Marvel at at this
[2:52] scripture because John saw 24 seats and
[2:55] 24 Elders who were the 24 Elders they
[2:58] were the 12 patri rars of the Old
[3:01] Testament and the 12 apostles is that
[3:04] right well John is one of those
[3:07] 12 so he sees 24 Elders of which he is
[3:10] one of them but he's in a vision and
[3:14] he's saying things it's not an unfolding
[3:15] event it's a vision that's declaring by
[3:18] symbols things that we can catch and
[3:21] things that we can
[3:23] understand but here we are
[3:26] today this is
[3:28] reality and all of these things are not
[3:31] intellectual understanding but they're
[3:33] to bring us into the thinking of God
[3:38] into the thoughts of God when we pray we
[3:41] don't pray to change God's mind we pray
[3:44] Lord not our will but your will be done
[3:48] we pray Lord show us your will lead us
[3:51] in the path of righteousness give us the
[3:54] right answer give us the right decision
[3:57] give us the right action to take in any
[4:00] situation that's our desire as Believers
[4:02] we don't want to to to mold God into our
[4:05] thinking but we want God to mold our
[4:07] thinking into his thoughts and and to
[4:10] give us an expression of his nature and
[4:13] now I want to just take this thing this
[4:16] what we're looking at in Revelation
[4:18] chapter 4 because this is J as it's
[4:21] shown to John in a symbol form now it
[4:24] was also shown to Ezekiel in the Book of
[4:27] Ezekiel you'll find a description of
[4:29] many of the same things but now if you
[4:31] go back into the Old Testament we find
[4:34] that Moses saw this pattern in heaven
[4:38] and was told to to form or make the
[4:41] Tabernacle and array the children of
[4:44] Israel according as it was shown to him
[4:46] in Heaven All right so he could not miss
[4:49] the pattern so he Moses went up on the
[4:51] mountain saw those things and came and
[4:53] made the representation of them in the
[4:56] earth now I want to spend a few moments
[4:58] here if it's all right with you and I
[5:00] hope you don't mind if I use some
[5:02] quotations here significantly in my
[5:05] slides because I I want to just take you
[5:07] quickly through the things that the
[5:08] prophet of God said in the fifth seal
[5:11] regarding these things so that we can
[5:13] see how they apply in the day and the
[5:16] hour we're living in so if you would put
[5:18] the slides up for me and we'll begin uh
[5:21] this morning now I want
[5:23] to entitle this message this morning
[5:27] combat simply combat
[5:30] now in the fifth
[5:33] seal thank
[5:35] you in the fifth
[5:38] seal we find out he says we find out in
[5:42] the church ages that those four beasts
[5:44] which we read about four powers was
[5:48] gathered around the Acts of the Apostles
[5:52] just the way that the Tabernacle in the
[5:55] wilderness so according to what Moses
[5:58] arrayed in in the wilderness was also
[6:02] what the four gospels were gathered
[6:04] around the Acts of the Apostles in the
[6:07] new test all right so we see this
[6:09] pattern repeating itself he says they
[6:12] were watching over this the lamb and the
[6:16] word to perform the word just as they
[6:19] did the Ark of the Covenant in the Holy
[6:21] place in the wilderness and so forth now
[6:24] the and so forth means the rest of the
[6:27] of the Tabernacle the way that it was
[6:29] made in the wilderness and he says now
[6:32] notice that even the nature of the Beast
[6:35] was exactly a tribal emblem so he's
[6:38] referring to the man uh the lion the ox
[6:41] the man and the eagle those were emblems
[6:44] that were represented there in the
[6:46] wilderness so let's just take a little
[6:47] bit of a look I have a just a few
[6:49] Graphics if they'll work for me this
[6:51] morning I see somebody's controlling the
[6:53] who's controlling this thank you I'll
[6:55] when I point at you I want you to move
[6:57] forward all right got it all right cuz
[6:59] the clicker here is not uh is made by
[7:02] man let's put it that
[7:04] way all right so now here we have a
[7:08] representation of the Tabernacle in the
[7:10] wilderness and some of some tents around
[7:13] it representing the children of Israel
[7:15] as they're gathered around the
[7:16] Tabernacle now remember when Moses made
[7:19] the Tabernacle they came out of Egypt as
[7:21] a I won't say unruly but a disorganized
[7:25] bunch and so they were just a group of
[7:27] people so that when Moses
[7:29] took and and uh uh built the Tabernacle
[7:33] through gifted men in the body then then
[7:36] they he he began to erect it outside of
[7:39] the camp because that what he was doing
[7:43] is he was reorganizing or or placing the
[7:47] people in their position around the word
[7:51] of God and so as he he first put erected
[7:55] this Tabernacle and then he placed the
[7:57] tribes around it which as you see thank
[7:59] you now let's take a little bit of an
[8:01] overview here and we see the Tabernacle
[8:03] we see I'll point to this one here we
[8:06] see the holy of holies we see the holy
[8:08] place and we see the outer court it's a
[8:11] representation of the human body which
[8:14] is the real Dwelling Place of God we
[8:17] have the the body the spirit and the
[8:20] soul is where God dwells when you're
[8:23] born again of the spirit of God he takes
[8:25] up his residency he puts a part of
[8:27] himself in your soul Quicken the seed
[8:29] Gene that's within you and making you uh
[8:33] now a god natured individual whereas
[8:37] before you were an unbelief natured
[8:40] individual all right so now we see I
[8:43] won't go into all of the different
[8:44] aspects of of what we see represented
[8:46] here but you can give me the next slide
[8:48] as we kind of zoom out and and place it
[8:51] there in the middle of the camp and so
[8:53] we see the 12 tribes of Israel that are
[8:55] gathered around the Tabernacle on in the
[8:58] outer perimeter here and then we see the
[9:02] the what would I call them segments or
[9:04] portions of the Le Levites that are
[9:08] camped next to the Tabernacle and then
[9:10] actually Moses and Aaron their
[9:12] encampment would be here and so we these
[9:14] are the tribes and these tribes Ephraim
[9:17] Dan Judah and Reuben they are the ones
[9:20] that have the emblems that brother
[9:22] brandham was talking about the lion the
[9:24] ox the man and and the eagle and so we
[9:27] see that these are these are
[9:29] specifically ordered God doesn't make
[9:33] mistakes and so he he put these tribes
[9:36] all in order he gave Moses the pattern
[9:39] Moses told people this is where you're
[9:41] going to dwell it was a representation
[9:43] that in the promised land you will have
[9:45] a specific placing all right it wasn't
[9:48] to stop here it was it wasn't just to be
[9:50] a Tabernacle in the wilderness we know
[9:52] that it would become the temple in the
[9:54] promised land and was mentioning to
[9:56] Aaron Brother Aaron and I were talking
[9:58] this morning he says he's already been
[9:59] ministering on the Tabernacle this year
[10:01] so you've already have some of the
[10:02] background so this is the encampment but
[10:05] there's a reason the reason that all of
[10:07] these tribes were around here with their
[10:10] emblems was to protect the
[10:13] word the reason that these these emblems
[10:17] which represented the anointings in
[10:19] Revelation CH 4 they are powers to
[10:23] protect the word the word in The
[10:27] Believer the word that dwell in your
[10:29] soul so there are anointings that are
[10:32] sent at specific times in the tribe of
[10:34] is in the nation of Israel we see all
[10:36] Fuller anointings at the same time like
[10:38] is seen in heaven but in the seven
[10:40] Church ages the four anointings are are
[10:43] sent into the church at different times
[10:47] all right give me the next
[10:49] slide in the fifth seal brother Brown
[10:51] says now we see the devil changing four
[10:55] beasts meant what power he revealed to
[10:59] the world and how they ended on this
[11:02] pale death horse now let's look at God's
[11:05] power of these beasts to combat them and
[11:08] that's why I entitled it combat now
[11:12] brother bram's uh describing here
[11:14] without going into detail uh or without
[11:17] going into a longer quote he's
[11:19] describing the four powers of the devil
[11:22] which are revealed in the opening of the
[11:25] first four seals the the white horse
[11:28] rider the red horse rider the black
[11:31] horse rider and the pale horse rider the
[11:34] power is the horse the rider is the same
[11:38] all right it's the same individual
[11:39] riding on you can give me the next slide
[11:42] so we have a little bit of a visual
[11:43] representation here we see a right white
[11:46] horse rider with some symbols he's got a
[11:48] bow but he's got no arrows he's got a
[11:50] crown now that and then and after that
[11:53] it moves to a red horse same guy now
[11:54] moving onto red horse a sword is given
[11:57] to take peace from the Earth and to slay
[12:00] and then the black horse comes with a a
[12:02] pair of balances in his hands and then
[12:05] the Pale Horse comes and his name is
[12:07] death and Hell follows after him and so
[12:09] we see this same Rider switching
[12:13] positions or switching the power
[12:16] depending on the age that we're living
[12:18] in all right next
[12:21] one brother Bram says when that
[12:24] Antichrist was riding with his false
[12:26] teaching now those are symbols this is
[12:29] not physical
[12:31] Warfare this is spiritual warfare the
[12:34] Antichrist was riding with his false
[12:37] teaching God sent his teaching out the
[12:41] word so here's the combat now the
[12:44] Antichrist comes with his power anointed
[12:47] false teaching God sends his power
[12:51] anointed true teaching of the word of
[12:55] God into the age to combat the move
[12:58] movement of the Antichrist spirit in
[13:00] that age and he's talking about the
[13:01] first Age The Lion of the tribe of Judah
[13:04] which is the word made manifest in the
[13:07] Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit there to
[13:10] manifest himself which is the word now
[13:15] before we go
[13:18] further I I want you
[13:20] to I want you to notice something
[13:27] here
[13:29] the Tabernacle in the wilderness
[13:31] representing the
[13:34] Believers when when the Devil comes to
[13:36] attack the word he's not trying to
[13:39] attack the message right he's trying to
[13:43] attack the word in The
[13:46] Believer and the and the anointing is
[13:49] sent upon the
[13:51] believer now there's a there's a a
[13:53] misunderstanding we won't turn to it but
[13:55] you can I think you know the scripture
[13:58] in Acts chap chap 1 and: 8 Jesus said to
[14:01] the church before they receive the Holy
[14:04] Ghost he says you shall receive
[14:07] power after that the Holy Ghost has come
[14:10] upon you and you shall be Witnesses unto
[14:14] me both in Jerusalem and in all Judea
[14:16] Samaria and unto the uttermost parts of
[14:18] the earth now the power that Jesus was
[14:21] referring to is those four anointings
[14:25] Around The
[14:26] Throne a lot of times and I was raised
[14:29] in the Pentecostal movement I as a boy I
[14:31] was grew up in the Pentecostal church
[14:33] and we used to sing a song it's the Holy
[14:35] Ghost and power and it's keeping me
[14:37] alive anybody ever heard that song all
[14:39] right maybe we still sing it but the
[14:42] power was
[14:43] ambiguous it's the Holy Ghost and power
[14:47] you'll get power when you get the Holy
[14:49] Ghost no the power that you get as
[14:51] you'll see as we quote brother brandham
[14:53] here is the anointing that is sent upon
[14:56] the church to combat the Antichrist
[14:59] Spirit that's the power and you can only
[15:03] operate under that power that's the
[15:07] power that defeats the enemy it's not
[15:10] just oh I got the Holy Ghost I got power
[15:12] now well if you got power you got the
[15:14] anointing that was sent into that age so
[15:16] they he brother brandham says when the
[15:18] Antichrist was writing on his power God
[15:21] sent his power the lion of the tribe of
[15:24] Judah into that first age give me the
[15:26] next quote that's the reason the early
[15:29] church had healings and miracles and
[15:31] visions and power is because it was the
[15:34] Living Word in the form of the Lion of
[15:37] the tribe of Judah riding out to combat
[15:40] that amen now you got it he sends his
[15:43] power
[15:44] Antichrist God sends his the word so the
[15:49] anointing comes to the word for the age
[15:53] all right I think the next one is
[15:56] graphical yes so if we lay this out now
[15:59] on a on a screen we see the Antichrist
[16:02] is coming to attack and depending on
[16:05] what uh Power the enemy is riding in is
[16:09] what power of the word he is confronted
[16:12] with so the White Horse is confronted
[16:15] with the lion anointing the red horse is
[16:18] confronted with the ox anointing the
[16:20] black horse of power of the enemy is
[16:23] confronted by the man anointing and The
[16:25] Pale Horse in the last days is
[16:27] confronted by the eagle anointing in
[16:30] other words if you want power in this
[16:33] hour this is the power
[16:36] yes you shall receive power see the Holy
[16:40] Ghost baptism that's one thing that I
[16:42] think sometimes people lose sight of is
[16:44] brother Brown says we've been in the
[16:46] Feast of Pentecost which is the baptism
[16:48] of the Holy Ghost from Acts chapter 2
[16:50] until the present time the Holy Ghost
[16:52] was sent into the church in Acts chapter
[16:54] 2 and many times brother Brown was
[16:57] confronting different Brothers that said
[16:59] well that was just for the apostles that
[17:01] was just for them in that day he says
[17:02] I'll show you where God sent it into the
[17:04] church you show me where God took it out
[17:06] of the church the Holy Ghost the New
[17:09] Birth has been the same down Through the
[17:12] Ages so now let me just lay a principle
[17:13] here now in that the power of the Holy
[17:16] Ghost that was in Paul is the same power
[17:18] of the Holy Ghost in you all right the
[17:20] same power of the Holy Ghost in Luther
[17:23] the same power of the Holy Ghost in
[17:24] Wesley he said oh is that so well why
[17:26] are the actions different well get into
[17:28] to that but I want you to realize that
[17:30] the power of the Holy Spirit brother
[17:32] brandham says if you got the Holy Ghost
[17:34] you got enough power in you to speak
[17:36] worlds into existence and go and live on
[17:39] them but that power is limited by a law
[17:43] and it's not a law of dos and don'ts
[17:45] it's a law of Faith as much as God will
[17:48] reveal to you is as much of that power
[17:52] that is released unto you all right so
[17:56] it takes a revelation to loose the power
[17:59] of the Holy Ghost within the believer
[18:02] you don't have any less than you than
[18:04] you than you a sister doesn't have any
[18:06] less than a brother you know a pastor
[18:08] doesn't have any more than the church
[18:10] it's all the same Holy Ghost because if
[18:13] God is infinite the portion that's in
[18:15] you is
[18:16] infinite there's nothing in you that
[18:19] cannot be done save for one thing
[18:21] Revelation see that's why that that that
[18:25] God did not reveal the revelation of the
[18:27] rapture until this day because the power
[18:30] of the Rapture which is also the power
[18:33] of the Resurrection has been in the
[18:35] church since Acts chapter 2 the Power of
[18:37] the Resurrection The Power of the
[18:39] Rapture has been in the church but there
[18:41] would come a day that the revelation of
[18:44] the Rapture would be given or in other
[18:46] words rapturing
[18:47] Faith the power for the Rapture has
[18:50] always been in the church otherwise when
[18:52] how are they going to come out of the
[18:53] Grave the power of the Resurrection is
[18:55] already in them but in the last day days
[18:58] the revelation will be given to bring
[19:01] the church Faith into a level to loose
[19:04] that power that's in the church and
[19:07] bring forth a change of these mortal
[19:09] bodies isn't that wonderful it's simple
[19:11] that's how God operates all
[19:14] right so here we have just a a little
[19:16] bit different perspective we see you
[19:18] know the the devil wants to get to where
[19:21] the word is which is in you but he has
[19:24] to go through those anointings and he
[19:26] can't do it because they are sent to
[19:29] protect the word in you amen thank you
[19:34] next one we'll just go through a few
[19:36] more
[19:46] here all
[19:49] right let me just you can just blank
[19:52] that for a minute here for me I want to
[19:54] just lay a couple more things in here
[19:56] before you before we go there
[20:02] you know the scripture says brother
[20:03] brandham says
[20:05] that God sent his beast in his own mask
[20:08] to announce the combat to the Antichrist
[20:12] he says the scripture says when the
[20:14] enemy comes in like a flood the spirit
[20:16] of God raises up a standard against it
[20:20] all right and that's you've got to
[20:24] understand you've got to see when I say
[20:27] understand is to see
[20:28] you've got to see the standard for your
[20:31] age and the time that you're living in
[20:35] the power that is sent into the church
[20:37] is to combat the
[20:39] enemy 2 Corinthians 10 says though we
[20:42] walk in the flesh we do not war after
[20:44] the flesh for the weapons of our Warfare
[20:47] are not carnal But Mighty through God to
[20:51] the pulling down of
[20:53] strongholds casting down imaginations
[20:57] amen and every High thing that exalts
[21:00] itself against the knowledge of God and
[21:02] bringing into captivity every thought to
[21:05] The Obedience of Christ and having in a
[21:08] Readiness to Revenge all Disobedience
[21:11] when your obedience is fulfilled now let
[21:12] me just stop here for a
[21:14] moment you we know if you're sick
[21:17] according to the word of God you're
[21:20] already healed 2,000 years
[21:23] ago what's the problem the battle is in
[21:26] your mind it's your
[21:29] imaginations it's the high things that
[21:31] exalts itself against the word of God
[21:34] the word of God says we're already
[21:37] healed but the devil with an antichrist
[21:41] anointing comes to you and say well you
[21:43] can't be healed because of this or
[21:46] because of that and even because as
[21:49] Believers we hear a lot of things as
[21:51] well you know this can hinder you from
[21:53] your healing or that can hinder you from
[21:55] your healing you know if you've got
[21:56] something against you just repent of it
[21:59] just get it right get it under the blood
[22:02] and let the promise of healing take
[22:04] place in your life it's the same with
[22:07] any other thing you got any other
[22:09] situation any other problem you just
[22:10] trust God that's why brother brandham
[22:12] says the right mental attitude towards
[22:15] any Divine promise will bring it to pass
[22:18] it's the mental attitude that the word
[22:20] comes to bring your thoughts in line
[22:22] with his word because his word is
[22:25] eternal and his word cannot fail amen
[22:28] God does not make mistakes as I already
[22:30] said God's word is true it will come to
[22:32] pass exactly like he said and all we
[22:36] have to do is get our thoughts in line
[22:38] with the word of God let the Holy Spirit
[22:40] bring our thoughts into captivity so the
[22:43] weapons of our Warfare are not
[22:46] carnal that is to say I don't Paul's not
[22:49] saying carnal as in unbelieving he's
[22:52] saying carnal as in
[22:54] natural okay so the weapons of our
[22:57] Warfare are not natural that is to
[23:00] say and it's not that these things are
[23:03] wrong it's not laying on of hands very
[23:06] good but it's your faith in the promise
[23:09] of the word of
[23:10] God all right it's
[23:13] not you know some kind of
[23:16] outside touch you know you can ask your
[23:18] pastor to pray for you anoint you with
[23:20] oil that's in the word of God but if you
[23:23] don't believe that physical action will
[23:26] do nothing for you all right we could
[23:29] say the same about water baptism we know
[23:31] that the water availeth nothing it's not
[23:34] the water that's going to wash you of
[23:36] your sins it's your faith in the word of
[23:39] God your re the revelation of Jesus
[23:42] Christ personally to you it's your faith
[23:44] and I I preached on it a while ago at
[23:46] home I says it's very simple why you
[23:48] don't have the Holy Ghost you don't
[23:52] believe oh well brother Tim I I I
[23:54] thought if somebody laid hands on me or
[23:56] somebody prayed for me if I prayed all
[23:58] night if I did this and I did that no no
[23:59] no G the brother brandham explains how
[24:02] that Abraham you know believed God and
[24:06] it was accounted to him for
[24:08] righteousness and God gave him the sign
[24:10] of circumcision a type of the Holy Ghost
[24:13] all right so what was what was wrong is
[24:15] that he what was I should say right is
[24:18] that he believed God God recognized his
[24:22] faith and accounted it to him for
[24:25] righteousness not anything he did amen
[24:28] God saw God spoke his word to Abraham
[24:31] Abraham believed God and God gave him
[24:35] righteousness and said now circumcise
[24:39] your household as a type of the Holy
[24:41] Ghost and that's the reality when you
[24:44] believe God God recognizes your faith
[24:47] and sends down the Holy Ghost as a seal
[24:50] of that
[24:52] faith I I try to not to you
[24:56] know sometimes emotional people need to
[25:00] get emotional
[25:03] right sometimes people that are that are
[25:06] deep thinkers need to understand a
[25:08] little bit
[25:09] better sometimes you know people that
[25:12] you know are religious want to have some
[25:14] kind of religiosity in it and God allows
[25:18] that God God makes room for your
[25:21] weaknesses to bring you into the place
[25:24] that he wants you to be in but the
[25:26] ultimate thing is he puts his life in
[25:28] you and it changes your nature and
[25:31] you're not the same
[25:34] anymore
[25:41] amen all right we go back to the
[25:44] slides now the second beast that the
[25:46] Antichrist sent out was a red Beast that
[25:48] he rode on was to take peace from the
[25:51] earth and War now the second one that
[25:54] went to combat him was the ox Beast
[25:58] now we're we're talking about these
[25:59] anointings or Powers upon the church the
[26:02] ox means a labor a beast of burden all
[26:06] right now we understand what this uh
[26:10] represents
[26:11] here
[26:14] because um we we can look back in
[26:19] history all right let's go to the next
[26:21] part he says see that shows that the
[26:26] thyra age after the Antichrist got
[26:29] settled down and it come into the thyra
[26:31] age the little church could do nothing
[26:34] but just simply labor and another thing
[26:39] the ox is also a beast of sacrifice and
[26:41] they give their lives just as freely as
[26:44] they could give them all right remember
[26:47] I said and you shall receive power now
[26:49] in the first church age the ones that
[26:52] were hidden in the upper room the ones
[26:54] that didn't want to show their face to
[26:56] the Gentile or to the Jews when the Holy
[26:59] Ghost Came Upon them they came out of
[27:01] the upper room seemed like drunk men
[27:04] bold as
[27:05] lions the cowards now became lions and
[27:09] because they were Anointed with an
[27:11] anointing and they begin to declare
[27:14] Jesus Christ to the those that were
[27:16] gathered in Jerusalem 3,000 were
[27:18] converted in that day and even the the
[27:21] Apostle Peter who fled when Jesus was
[27:23] tried as they tried to accuse him of
[27:26] being one of Jesus disciples but now he
[27:28] was fearless and stood up and says these
[27:30] men are not drunk as you suppose and he
[27:32] declared unto them the glory that was
[27:35] fulfilled right in their midst this is
[27:37] that which the SP the prophet Joel had
[27:40] prophesied and this Jesus whom you
[27:42] crucified he's both Lord in Christ and
[27:44] he just declared the whole message to
[27:46] them Fearless standing amongst him and
[27:49] the people were pricked in their hearts
[27:51] and said what should we do and he said
[27:52] repent and be baptized in the name of
[27:55] Jesus Christ here's a man with the key
[27:57] ke of the Kingdom unlocking the door and
[28:00] he says be baptized in the name of Jesus
[28:02] Christ and you shall receive the gift of
[28:04] the Holy Ghost the recipe hasn't changed
[28:08] all right the church got away from the
[28:10] recipe but the recipe hasn't changed now
[28:12] under this as the church changes or as
[28:15] the time changes or the age changes the
[28:18] Antichrist Spirit now changes couldn't
[28:21] defeat the lion anointing so he now he
[28:23] get the devil starts to ride on a
[28:25] different Power a red horse a sword was
[28:28] given unto him he was allowed to make
[28:30] war on the earth and take peace from the
[28:31] earth and and now you think oh well it's
[28:34] going to be a Warfare because there's a
[28:35] lion anointing but God changes the
[28:40] anointing the way to fight the red horse
[28:43] is not to be a
[28:44] lion the way to fight the red horse now
[28:47] is to be an ox is to be Anointed with a
[28:50] sacrificial anointing is to be Anointed
[28:53] with an anointing of service and so now
[28:55] but now let me H let me say if we didn't
[28:58] understand the anointings we might look
[29:00] at it and say what happened the cowards
[29:03] that became Lions did the Lions now
[29:05] become cowards
[29:07] right do they not got the Holy
[29:10] Ghost what happened they're not
[29:13] manifesting the same works that they did
[29:15] in the book of
[29:17] Acts
[29:19] hello what happened was the anointing
[29:22] changed those who previously fought
[29:25] against uh you know W out under that
[29:27] anointing to spread the gospel now under
[29:30] th tyan age they come under a different
[29:32] anointing and when the enemy comes at
[29:34] them and says you're a heretic we're
[29:36] going to burn you at the Stak and they
[29:37] go okay burn me at the steak then I will
[29:40] not re recant of what I believe I will
[29:43] stand for the truth if it cost me my
[29:46] life and they gave their lives willingly
[29:48] and they served God and they were under
[29:50] that anointing of that hour that beast
[29:54] of burden to and filled with the Holy
[29:56] Ghost absolutely filled with the Holy
[29:59] Ghost but a different Power you shall
[30:03] receive power after you receive the holy
[30:05] gohost now there might have been some of
[30:06] the early teachers of that age said what
[30:10] happened to the church where's the
[30:12] anointing we once
[30:14] had I can imagine them because the same
[30:18] in every age where's the anointing with
[30:20] what's head where's the boldness we once
[30:22] had what has happened what is all this
[30:23] people given their lives 66 million
[30:25] Martyrs at the at the the the false
[30:28] church and the Antichrist and all of
[30:30] these things happening what's wrong with
[30:31] us we need a
[30:33] Revival come on it's a different
[30:36] anointing now let's go to the next
[30:39] quote says the Martyr down Through the
[30:41] Ages there suffered terribly but what
[30:44] was they they was under the
[30:46] inspiration the spirit of God the
[30:50] power see a lot of times when we say
[30:53] power we think Warfare right this power
[30:56] made them beasts of sacrifice made them
[30:59] Believers of sacrifice and he says and
[31:02] don't forget this church and you
[31:03] Brethren on tape that's us I want you to
[31:07] examine this how could a man do anything
[31:10] else besides the power of God that had
[31:13] been released to
[31:15] them and you shall receive power after
[31:19] that Holy Ghost has come upon you amen
[31:23] give me the next
[31:25] one all right the next that went out to
[31:29] combat or I'm sorry I'm in a oh I'm
[31:33] going to represent get put a box up here
[31:36] go when God if God sends a certain
[31:38] Spirit among them that's the only thing
[31:41] that they can work by I'll say it again
[31:44] that's the only thing they can work by
[31:48] is the spirit that works among them well
[31:51] I thought it's Jesus Christ the same
[31:53] yesterday today and forever brother Tim
[31:55] but the anointing upon the word is
[31:58] different to fulfill the purpose of God
[32:02] because you don't send the same
[32:03] anointing or the sunshine upon the stock
[32:08] as you do upon the
[32:10] grain the planting sun is weaker than
[32:13] the Harvest Sun it has to be a certain
[32:17] anointing to produce the results that
[32:19] are required in that
[32:21] season and so God sets up his work there
[32:26] and next one we will'll prove to you by
[32:28] the history of the church and by the
[32:30] opening of the seals and the powers that
[32:33] let loose and watch exactly the church
[32:37] responded to the
[32:39] anointing they couldn't do nothing else
[32:43] next one they didn't care because the
[32:46] spirit of the church in that day was
[32:48] sacrifice labor and they walked up just
[32:51] as freely as they could walk Anointed
[32:55] with the true spirit of God of that age
[32:58] what did he just
[33:00] say the true spirit of God for that age
[33:04] well why did they act differently than
[33:06] Acts chapter 2 because they were
[33:07] Anointed with the true spirit of God for
[33:09] that age and they died like Heroes of
[33:12] sacrifice thousands times thousands 68
[33:16] million of them on the records Ox
[33:20] sacrifice cuz that's what they were
[33:23] Anointed
[33:25] with amen
[33:27] good he says
[33:31] now no I'm just going to just leave it
[33:33] blank just for a moment
[33:35] there and I want to say something about
[33:37] this
[33:39] anointing as as they were Anointed with
[33:43] this and they suffered terribly with
[33:46] this under that anointing towards the
[33:50] end of that season was a man by the name
[33:54] of yan hus you ever heard of him John
[33:58] hus we might call him in English he was
[34:01] I think Dutch or
[34:02] something check thank you and uh oh
[34:06] that's why you you know him very well
[34:08] yes yes yes and uh so he was a real man
[34:12] of God matter of fact he was about a
[34:15] hundred years before Martin
[34:17] Luther and and so he's they they took
[34:20] him and and for what he was preaching
[34:24] they burned him at the stake and he
[34:26] willing gave his life and so now as he's
[34:30] standing there at the stake the fires
[34:32] are being lit and the Flames are upon
[34:35] him the spirit of God comes upon him to
[34:39] prophesy and he says you may be able to
[34:44] cook this and I have it here you you're
[34:48] going to burn a goose he
[34:52] said because hust means Goose okay
[34:55] you're going to burn a Goose but in 100
[34:58] years you will have a swan that you can
[35:02] neither roast nor
[35:05] burn now the symbol the family emblem
[35:09] symbol of Luther's household was a
[35:14] swan there is coming a swan he says you
[35:17] won't be able to burn why not the
[35:21] anointing was about to
[35:24] change you see he spoke that in
[35:29] 1415 in
[35:31] 1515 exactly a 100 years later that was
[35:35] the year that a spiritually tormented
[35:39] monk by the name of Martin Luther
[35:42] frightened by God was assigned in his
[35:46] church to teach on the book of
[35:49] Romans and if you know anything about
[35:51] the book of Romans that's where it says
[35:53] and the just shall live by
[35:55] faith and Martin begin to catch a
[35:58] revelation why and and Martin was was
[36:01] taken uh you know we know that he posted
[36:04] his protest against the Catholic church
[36:06] and he he went to trial and and in the
[36:09] midst of that trial they excommunicated
[36:12] him and they they did more than
[36:14] excommunicated him they made him I think
[36:16] it's called Persona nrata or something
[36:18] and they they basically said this man
[36:20] can be killed by anyone who finds him
[36:24] anywhere they pronounced a sentence of
[36:27] death upon Martin Luther now Martin
[36:30] Luther what was his teachings Martin
[36:33] Luther himself said we are all
[36:37] hites he says in other words I'm
[36:40] teaching what John hus taught what John
[36:43] hus taught a 100 years ago I'm teaching
[36:45] today but why wasn't Martin Luther able
[36:48] to be burned at the stake because the
[36:51] anointing
[36:52] changed it was no longer an ox anointing
[36:55] upon the church but but now by the
[36:57] revealing of the word of God the
[37:00] anointing had come to prove that the
[37:02] just shall live by faith and Martin be
[37:05] to preach that anointed word and that
[37:07] anointed be to come on the church though
[37:09] they hunted him and they the his
[37:12] protector of that region hid him away
[37:14] for I think nine months while he
[37:16] interpreted the New Testament into the
[37:19] German language but after that he went
[37:21] out freely and and what we know is the
[37:23] Reformation began to break forth and the
[37:26] Supernatural begin to happen why because
[37:29] it was no longer an ox anointing there's
[37:32] nothing the devil could do about
[37:34] it Hallelujah the devil was now on a
[37:38] black horse but God sent forth the man
[37:41] anointing into the church no longer a
[37:43] sacrificial anointing but raised up a
[37:46] man with boldness like Martin Luther and
[37:48] the shrewdness of Martin Luther to stand
[37:50] there and say I will not recant I cannot
[37:53] recant this is the truth of the word of
[37:56] God he was anointed amen do you have the
[37:59] Holy Ghost
[38:01] absolutely well brother Timmy he drank
[38:04] beer he sure
[38:05] did because it wasn't revealed to him at
[38:09] that point in time there was many things
[38:11] that were not yet reveal God said I will
[38:14] restore sayith the Lord all that the
[38:17] Antichrist Spirit through the Dark Ages
[38:19] the canor and the Palm worm the
[38:21] caterpillar the Locust all that had
[38:23] eaten off the bride tree I will restore
[38:26] and this was the beginning of the
[38:28] restoration it wasn't the fullness of it
[38:30] it was the beginning of it and so that
[38:34] word went out and they were unable to do
[38:37] anything about Martin Luther why the
[38:39] anointing had changed you the church can
[38:42] only operate under the anointing it's
[38:44] given go ahead give me the he says the
[38:47] next thing that went out to combat that
[38:49] was a beast with the face of a man smart
[38:51] educated shrewd fine Anointed with the
[38:53] spirit of that day notice it go ahead
[38:58] notice idolatry brought the man
[39:01] Beast that the man Beast went forth with
[39:04] the power of God by the wisdom that God
[39:07] gave him and brought the church from
[39:10] idolatry back to God
[39:18] hallelujah under that third anointing
[39:21] came reformation and
[39:23] restoration it's amazing that the key
[39:27] Revelation to Quicken the church under
[39:30] the power of the Holy
[39:32] Ghost in that under that man anointing
[39:35] was not the
[39:38] godhead was not the godhead it was the
[39:42] just shall live by
[39:44] faith that was the spirit Came Upon the
[39:47] word and begin to reveal that it's the
[39:49] same thing that Yan hus preached 100
[39:51] years earlier but now it begin to be
[39:54] loosed upon the people when God works in
[39:56] in a season I'll give you an example on
[39:58] the mission field when God works he has
[40:00] his Seasons that he works we have a a a
[40:04] work of God that's going on in
[40:06] Ethiopia and it has been for about 10
[40:08] years and God has has re the word is the
[40:11] message is really now taking a grip in
[40:14] that
[40:15] country uh for several years I would go
[40:18] there and we might be able to gather 10
[40:21] 20 the fir I think the first time I went
[40:23] was probably 10 Believers there was a
[40:25] brother from Uganda that what we sent
[40:28] into the Ethiopia and he was a good
[40:30] evangelist and and and they then there
[40:33] was 20 Believers and then maybe 30
[40:36] Believers and you know for a season but
[40:39] all of a sudden it begin to Break Forth
[40:41] as as the Ethiopians themselves begin to
[40:44] catch the word and God raised up
[40:47] ministry within that country now having
[40:49] looked back there were men from
[40:51] different countries that had tried to do
[40:53] something in Ethiopia and we weren't the
[40:56] first ones and so Brothers with a burden
[40:59] say what's happening in Ethiopia and
[41:00] they would go and they would they would
[41:03] preach the word and they would send
[41:05] messages and different things and
[41:06] nothing ever took root but for some
[41:10] reason last decade was started really in
[41:14] 2013 for some reason God chose that this
[41:17] was the
[41:18] time I can't say why I just know this
[41:21] was the time and now people begin to
[41:23] catch it the Ethiopians begin to catch
[41:26] it
[41:26] and they begin to take a hold of it and
[41:29] the and the 10 to to 20 the 20 to 30 the
[41:32] 30 to 70 the 70 to 100 so two years ago
[41:35] we had a convention and there was over a
[41:38] hundred people not all the Believers in
[41:40] Ethiopia about a 100 people last year we
[41:43] went again there was over 200 people
[41:46] next time we're Lord willing going back
[41:48] in may pray for us because we we try and
[41:50] just to have a just a general meeting
[41:52] for everybody and and the pastor the
[41:54] main Pastor there brother Mogan he says
[41:56] brother Tim maybe next year there'll be
[41:58] a
[41:59] thousand we don't know but it's just
[42:01] exploding across the country why God has
[42:04] a season we can't we can't question God
[42:08] God does things the way he does them
[42:11] amen are you with me on that all right
[42:14] so we find under the man anointing
[42:17] that's where we find uh
[42:21] Luther that's where we find
[42:24] Wesley and that's where we find find the
[42:28] Pentecostals Luther brought under that
[42:30] anointing the church out of idolatry
[42:33] under a move of God that started to
[42:35] deliver them from the Catholic man-made
[42:38] Creeds that had held them in bondage
[42:40] because remember if you've got the Holy
[42:43] Ghost you've got enough power in you to
[42:46] speak worlds into existence but it's
[42:48] limited to the faith that you have they
[42:50] had the Holy Ghost through every age
[42:52] even in the Dark Ages there was Holy
[42:54] Ghost filled believers but brother Bram
[42:57] says the Holy Spirit was bound by Creeds
[43:00] and dogmas so it's man-made teaching
[43:03] that limits the power of the Holy Ghost
[43:05] in The Believer okay so as the church
[43:08] begin to come out of that then then the
[43:10] Lutheran Church became uh uh formalized
[43:14] you could say and because God wasn't
[43:16] finished with just justification he
[43:18] raised up a man by the name of John
[43:20] Wesley you ever heard of John Wesley
[43:22] sure we've all heard of John Wesley he's
[43:24] a messenger to the to the Phil
[43:26] Philadelphia Age and and brother randam
[43:28] says when the wlans come along with
[43:30] their Revival they said we don't need
[43:31] you lutherans anymore but did you know
[43:34] the very life that was in the blade made
[43:36] the
[43:38] tossle says it can go no further until
[43:41] it uses the blade because it's a pollen
[43:44] shakes off itself down into the blade
[43:46] and there brings forth an ear by and by
[43:49] an ear of corn comes out it has grains
[43:51] in it that was the Pentecostal the
[43:54] restoration of the gifts coming com back
[43:56] into the church that's still under the
[43:58] man
[43:59] anointing the restoration of the gifts
[44:01] coming back into the church now the ear
[44:03] can't look back and say tossel I have no
[44:06] need of you notice what brother Brown
[44:08] says so what he's saying he says
[44:10] justification comes into the church and
[44:12] it's always in the
[44:13] church then sanctification comes into
[44:16] the church under that anointing and it
[44:18] stays in the church it's still a
[44:19] Sanctified bride it's still a sanctified
[44:22] people then the gifts of the holy spirit
[44:24] are restored in the church and they stay
[44:26] in the church never did away with those
[44:28] nobody ever did away with those but the
[44:30] church moves on all right it's still
[44:33] there but there's more for the church
[44:35] than just that he says what is it he
[44:38] says it's God's Church further matured
[44:41] and all that is in it he says we can see
[44:44] these things now that the ears ripe ends
[44:48] at the time of the end oh I know we got
[44:50] a lot of fungus on the ear but it's
[44:52] still an ear just the same that's not me
[44:54] that's brother Brown saying that all
[44:56] right he says we have a lot of ins and
[44:58] outs and little isms but God will shave
[45:01] that all off some of these
[45:03] days hallelujah we're still these people
[45:08] right
[45:09] amen we're not perfect
[45:12] yet we're perfect in Christ as far as
[45:15] spotless or sinless in the blood of
[45:17] Jesus Christ but we're not perfect in
[45:20] our actions as a matter of fact you'll
[45:23] never be perfect in your actions until
[45:25] your body is
[45:27] changed the fullness of the adoption to
[45:30] it the Redemption of our mortal bodies
[45:33] that's what we all long for that's why
[45:35] you know I had a young brother travel
[45:36] with me one time to the men's meetings
[45:38] and he said brother Tim you know the
[45:40] body change must be more you know you
[45:43] must desire it more being older than I
[45:47] do as a young
[45:49] man I said my brother you don't
[45:51] understand the body change I said it's
[45:54] not age and and it's not that I'm
[45:56] getting old and tired that makes me want
[45:58] a body change but what it is is there's
[46:01] a life in me that cannot be fully
[46:04] expressed through this Mortal body that
[46:07] life longs to be loosed it that eternal
[46:11] life in me wasn't made to be limited to
[46:15] the the weakness of this Mortal body it
[46:18] was made to have an eternal body and one
[46:21] day Paul says this Mortal will put on
[46:24] immortality this corruption will put on
[46:26] incorruption then the life that's in me
[46:28] will be completely expressed without
[46:32] mistakes Hallelujah I don't know about
[46:34] you I'm looking forward to it because I
[46:36] believe what John Wesley said which I
[46:38] believe is still in the church is that
[46:40] you're as likely to make mistakes as you
[46:41] are to
[46:44] breathe amen so if you want to stop
[46:46] making mistakes stop breathing you won't
[46:48] make any more
[46:50] mistakes all right dead men make no
[46:54] mistakes dead men don't get
[46:57] angry dead men don't get upset what
[47:00] people say about them that's why we need
[47:02] to be dead in
[47:04] Christ amen all right so brother Brown
[47:07] says we have a lot of ins and out little
[47:08] isens but God will shave all that off
[47:11] one of these days and he will have a
[47:13] perfect ear of corn one of these days
[47:17] all
[47:18] right the same Holy Ghost oh sorry the
[47:21] same holy spirit that fell on Pentecost
[47:26] is bringing it all
[47:28] about the Holy Spirit has been in the
[47:31] church for 2,000 years working out his
[47:35] purpose to bring us to the full
[47:38] maturity that is the stature of a
[47:40] perfect man in every individual in the
[47:44] body in general and as long as we're
[47:46] still in these mortal bodies we'll
[47:48] always be in combat yes amen the spirit
[47:53] of God fighting against the spirit of
[47:56] the world or the Antichrist
[47:59] Spirit
[48:03] Hallelujah so we realize under the man
[48:06] anointing was when outward
[48:09] demonstrations begin to
[48:11] manifest was under the man anointing you
[48:14] could go back and look at the
[48:16] Shakers you know largely under the
[48:18] Methodist movement there are people that
[48:21] believed if you didn't shake you didn't
[48:22] have the Holy Ghost and that was their
[48:25] their their evidence they had shouting
[48:27] you know you had to shout it depend on
[48:29] how loud you shouted as to how much Holy
[48:31] Ghost you had there's people they
[48:34] believed in being slain in the spirit
[48:36] right back under the man anointing and
[48:39] that if if if that that was a real sign
[48:41] that the Holy Ghost was Among Us was
[48:44] that that uh uh we were slain in the
[48:47] spirit or or you know somebody laid
[48:49] their hands on us we fell down all of
[48:51] those kind of things that was back under
[48:52] the mount anointing right all right and
[48:54] so all of these things all these outward
[48:56] demonstrations we know the Pentecostals
[48:58] and the restoration of the gifts they
[49:00] begin to say well if you don't speak in
[49:02] tongues you don't have the Holy Ghost
[49:05] that and don't get me wrong brother
[49:07] brandham said they had a real
[49:09] Pentecostal
[49:11] experience right but the anointing on
[49:13] that hour was the restoring of these
[49:15] things the man anointing bringing these
[49:18] things back into the church not that the
[49:20] church would be governed by them but the
[49:22] church would have access to all the
[49:24] promises of God just like we have
[49:27] justification just like we have
[49:29] sanctification we got the gifts of the
[49:30] Spirit anything that we have need of is
[49:32] in the body if it's in the word it's in
[49:34] the body all right and so uh there the
[49:38] Pentecostal begin to say well you got to
[49:40] speak in tongues you got to prophesy you
[49:41] got to interpret you got to do all those
[49:43] things and did all that that speak in
[49:46] tongues have it well brother brandham
[49:47] went to
[49:50] Mishawaka he says they had the Holy
[49:52] Ghost right and one man begin to speak
[49:56] in tongues and another man begin to
[49:58] interpret and he says it was exactly
[50:00] correct is that right he says now one
[50:04] man speaking in tongues he finally found
[50:06] him one day and he was talking to him he
[50:08] says that man was a real Christian he
[50:10] really had it he says but the then he
[50:13] ran into the other man that was doing
[50:15] the
[50:16] interpreting and he talked to that man
[50:18] and he found out that that man was a
[50:21] hypocrite is that right he says the man
[50:24] had a wife I think it was blond-headed
[50:26] and he was living with a blackheaded
[50:28] woman or vice versa in other words he
[50:30] was living in
[50:31] adultery and he had children of adultery
[50:35] and all of these things and so brother
[50:36] Bram thought well you know I thought I
[50:39] was amongst Angels but did I get amongst
[50:41] Devils you know he didn't understand
[50:44] what was going on but it was the
[50:46] anointing of the hour the rain falls on
[50:49] the just and the unjust all right and so
[50:52] they began to catch uh the the some of
[50:56] them now listen now this is important
[50:58] now to understand the anointing versus
[51:00] the baptism of the Holy Ghost are you
[51:02] still with me so
[51:04] far because brother bradam says about
[51:06] Believers and I now I don't have these
[51:08] notes in front of me I'm just going to
[51:09] just lay this out so we're all on the
[51:11] same page pertaining to the baptism of
[51:14] the Holy Ghost the we know the new birth
[51:17] is the revelation of Jesus Christ
[51:18] personally to you all right it's the
[51:20] quickening of the sea Gene it's the
[51:22] baptism of the Holy Ghost in the soul
[51:25] realm that changes your nature he says
[51:28] but now if you do something wrong he
[51:31] says the anointing will leave you like a
[51:35] dove and go sit on a branch
[51:39] somewhere now if you don't understand
[51:41] that the anointing is the power for the
[51:44] age you'll think you can lose the
[51:46] baptism of the Holy
[51:48] Ghost you can't lose the baptism of the
[51:51] Holy Ghost see brother bandam says the
[51:52] dove won't stay upon a wolf nature and
[51:54] what the problem problem is is people
[51:56] don't understand they have two Natures
[51:57] they have the nature of God on the
[51:58] outside but they have the nature of the
[52:00] flesh or the nature of God on the inside
[52:02] the nature of the Flesh on the outside
[52:04] and if you get in the flesh the
[52:07] anointing will not operate Through Your
[52:09] fleshly Existence the weapons of our
[52:11] Warfare are not
[52:13] carnal the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[52:15] you're sealed to the day of your
[52:18] Redemption but you start to act wrong
[52:20] you start to act contrary to the word
[52:22] God will not bless something that's
[52:24] contrary to the word
[52:26] but he says when you make that right
[52:28] then that anointing comes back upon you
[52:31] the dove can come back and that brings
[52:34] the power of God into our life power for
[52:37] what to be witnesses that Jesus Christ
[52:40] is the same yesterday today and forever
[52:42] am hallelujah amen aren't you glad for
[52:46] that I'm glad for this message that
[52:48] teaches us those things it's not a
[52:50] mystery it's a
[52:52] reality how you know cuz if you don't
[52:55] understand that I'll tell you what
[52:55] exactly is going to happen to you when
[52:57] you make a mistake in life and you feel
[52:59] like God Is A Million Miles Away the
[53:02] devil's going to come to you say see you
[53:04] never had
[53:06] it you never really were born again how
[53:10] could you make a mistake like that and
[53:13] be you know you might say some cross
[53:15] word to your spouse or you might you
[53:16] know make some mistake at work or
[53:19] something or get angry or something like
[53:21] that or or a lot of times the devil will
[53:23] just bring you into a place where you're
[53:25] going to see or hear something that will
[53:27] grieve you and will grieve the Holy
[53:29] Spirit and you'll you'll you'll think to
[53:31] yourself how can I ever get into such a
[53:33] situation and have the Holy Ghost and
[53:35] that's exactly what the devil wants you
[53:37] to think but what God wants you to do is
[53:40] just repent of it repent of it every day
[53:44] that's why that's why even in the in the
[53:46] book of Acts we find in Acts chapter 4 I
[53:49] believe it is or Acts chapter 3 you know
[53:51] after the after Peter and John were
[53:53] loosed from prison you know they begin
[53:56] to rejoice and shout and they had a
[53:57] service and the Bible says the house
[53:59] they were in was shaken and they were
[54:01] all filled with the Holy
[54:03] Ghost now they were already filled with
[54:05] the Holy Ghost they were already born
[54:07] again in Acts chapter 2 but they were
[54:10] all the disciples everybody was filled
[54:12] with the Holy Ghost again what was that
[54:14] a fresh
[54:15] anointing a fresh outpouring a washing
[54:18] of the water of the word an expression
[54:20] of God to cleanse because we rub
[54:22] shoulders with unclean things every day
[54:25] right and as we walk in the world we
[54:27] hear music I I'll tell and the devil SWS
[54:31] things in our minds that we don't even
[54:33] realize I might have told the story last
[54:36] time I was here I going to tell it again
[54:38] I I was you know sleeping one night and
[54:41] I I began to dream that I was counseling
[54:43] somebody and I was counseling I think it
[54:45] was a couple and and I I begin to say to
[54:48] them you know I see what the problem
[54:51] here is that you need love you really
[54:53] need love in your relationship all you
[54:55] you need is
[54:56] love all you need is
[55:00] love
[55:02] all and I woke up and now you have to
[55:06] understand for those of you that don't
[55:07] know that was a Beetles
[55:09] song all right and I woke up and I was
[55:13] so
[55:15] grieved how could that happen in my
[55:18] dream I thought what is wrong with me I
[55:21] am so carnal now I was never a Beatles
[55:24] fan you got understand I never was into
[55:26] their music and so I thought to myself
[55:30] how did that get into my
[55:33] subconscious H how did it get there and
[55:36] I was several days pondering that Lord
[55:39] how did that get inside of me and one
[55:42] day I was looking on my tablet at a news
[55:44] article and when the before the news
[55:46] article came on an advertisement came on
[55:49] and it was an advertisement brother
[55:51] Aaron will give me a rough time over
[55:53] this for Blackberry wow okay and the
[55:57] background music was that
[56:00] song and so the devil through that
[56:02] advertisement seed that into my
[56:05] subconscious without me even realizing
[56:08] it see that's why you have to watch what
[56:10] you look at watch what you listen to all
[56:12] of these things because the devil has
[56:15] access to your mind he doesn't have
[56:16] access to your soul if you're sealed by
[56:18] the Holy Ghost he has access to your
[56:20] mind and you need to keep those things
[56:22] away to keep the battle on the Winning
[56:25] Side on the Lord's Side and so once I
[56:29] realized what it was I said oh Lord
[56:31] forgive me the devil was subtle on that
[56:34] one and and it didn't bother me no more
[56:36] cuz I realized how the devil got it in
[56:38] there it wasn't in me it was the devil
[56:41] that put it in my mind and at the
[56:43] appropriate time anointed
[56:46] it
[56:48] dreams sometimes they're
[56:50] crazy and you don't we don't live by
[56:53] dreams
[56:55] all
[56:57] right now brother Bram says in Christ
[57:00] revealed in his own word he says down
[57:04] through the age we started off from the
[57:07] foundation from the first church age
[57:09] when the seed went into the ground the
[57:12] complete seed all right that's the first
[57:14] age under the lion anointing then it
[57:17] comes out through the feet Luther comes
[57:20] back out then through Wesley then into
[57:24] the pentec Apostles the tongues and the
[57:26] lips
[57:27] see now it's in the eyes prophetic of
[57:32] Malachi 4 and so forth now there's
[57:35] nothing else left for it to
[57:38] come but him himself to step into
[57:42] that cuz that's the last thing there
[57:47] is all right so now let me stop here for
[57:50] a moment Luther Luther Wesley
[57:52] Pentecostals are all under the man
[57:55] anointing the last thing that there is
[57:59] is for Christ himself now to come and
[58:01] step into the
[58:04] image amen a furtherance from Luther
[58:07] Wesley and
[58:08] Pentecostal he goes on he says the next
[58:12] is the
[58:13] intelligence we have no intelligence of
[58:16] our own it's his the mind of Christ now
[58:21] people will will misplace quotes and say
[58:24] well people are just into intelligence
[58:27] or they're just into intellectual
[58:28] thinking that's not what brother Brown's
[58:30] saying here brother Brown's saying the
[58:32] very mind of Christ comes into the
[58:35] church she will have the word and know
[58:40] what he wants done with it amen it's the
[58:43] bride that receives the word in her day
[58:46] not doing away with any of those former
[58:48] things that were restored in the church
[58:50] but now a furtherance of it he says we
[58:52] have no sight of our own how can we for
[58:55] how can a man foresee things he can't do
[58:57] that it's God himself it's coming to a
[59:00] place and he's governed the body all the
[59:03] way through and then the complete body
[59:06] of Christ is revealed in the form of a
[59:09] bride that was taken out of his side
[59:12] like Adams was at the beginning amen now
[59:16] we come back to what was in the Garden
[59:18] of Eden we're going to get into that
[59:19] more tonight because that's the hour
[59:21] that we're living in we're come back
[59:23] into that fullness of the relationship
[59:25] with Christ like Adam and Eve had in the
[59:28] Garden of Eden a perfect Faith a perfect
[59:30] love a perfect walk with God Amen all of
[59:34] nature subject to the manifestation of
[59:36] the sons of God we come now to that in
[59:39] this hour that's that's beyond Luther
[59:42] Wesley and Pentecost but includes what
[59:44] Luther Wesley and Pentecost had but if
[59:47] you don't miss the ne or that if you
[59:49] miss the next step you're actually not
[59:52] walking under the anointing of this hour
[59:54] you're trying to be under the anointing
[59:56] of a previous age Lord help us
[1:00:00] amen he said now do I still have another
[1:00:03] quote I think I do he says then at the
[1:00:06] last power he brings down the eagle to
[1:00:11] restore the children back to the
[1:00:13] original faith of the fathers again
[1:00:16] notice the Antichrist was on a pale
[1:00:18] horse mixed color he says a horse is a
[1:00:20] beast that represents a power his power
[1:00:22] is all mixed up it's politics it's
[1:00:24] natural National Powers its religious
[1:00:27] Powers its demonic Powers it's all kinds
[1:00:29] of powers mixed together a mixed Pale
[1:00:32] Horse he's got all kinds of powers so
[1:00:34] the Pale Horse is riding out with his
[1:00:36] powers but the anointing against the
[1:00:39] devil see that's why it's such a
[1:00:40] confusing age we're living in brother
[1:00:43] Bram says here's what the anointing the
[1:00:44] devil is using the power the devil is
[1:00:46] using he says it's politics it's
[1:00:49] National Powers it's religious Powers
[1:00:53] it's demon powers it's all kinds of
[1:00:55] powers all mixed together and it's hard
[1:00:58] to single out and say well this is this
[1:01:01] kind of a demon and that's that kind of
[1:01:02] a demon no we see it in the media we see
[1:01:05] it in the schools we see it in the
[1:01:07] culture we see it in the supermarket we
[1:01:10] hear it on the radios I'll tell you what
[1:01:12] the devil wants to send his powers to
[1:01:14] you through social media wants to
[1:01:16] bombard you every day that somebody
[1:01:19] that's got a spirit on them is going to
[1:01:21] do a certain something and you're going
[1:01:22] to look at that and go oh that's
[1:01:24] terrible well why are you looking at it
[1:01:27] just get away from it walk with Christ
[1:01:29] because the bride is to come up higher
[1:01:32] amen it's not it's not a a a man age
[1:01:36] where we're trying by shrewdness to
[1:01:38] accomplish something we now come to the
[1:01:41] eagle anointing all right we it it it
[1:01:44] wasn't clear then but now as we see it
[1:01:48] all around us the one thing that you
[1:01:50] need to see is the anointing that you
[1:01:52] need to be under there's only only one
[1:01:55] remedy and that is the original Power
[1:01:58] that fell at Pentecost in Acts chapter 2
[1:02:00] is still in the
[1:02:02] church and the power which has gone from
[1:02:05] Lion to Ox to man now has become in an
[1:02:09] eagle form and brought the church to a
[1:02:13] higher place than was ever known all
[1:02:16] right thank you you can take that down
[1:02:17] now I want you to I want to show you
[1:02:19] something here brother brandham as he's
[1:02:21] explaining these in in the seals and
[1:02:23] he's showing the different anointings
[1:02:25] and around the throne and how they
[1:02:26] combat the Antichrist Spirit brother
[1:02:28] brandham could look back in
[1:02:30] history and say this is how the lion
[1:02:33] acted how the how the people acted under
[1:02:36] Theon under the lion anointing in their
[1:02:38] age is that right all right then he
[1:02:40] could look back through the Dark Age and
[1:02:42] say This Is How They responded to the
[1:02:44] anointing in their age you see that's
[1:02:47] why brother Bram says the anointings is
[1:02:49] not emotions it's not running around the
[1:02:52] church and and and doing all kinds of of
[1:02:54] things like that and all emotions and
[1:02:57] things like that he says a matter of
[1:02:58] fact he says Jesus in Luke chapter 4
[1:03:01] with the greatest anointing that was
[1:03:03] upon him he after he read the scripture
[1:03:06] saying the spirit of the Lord is upon me
[1:03:08] he sat down and precious words proceeded
[1:03:10] from his mouth those weren't
[1:03:13] intellectual words Jesus said the words
[1:03:15] that I speak unto you they are spirit
[1:03:17] and they are life and brother brand says
[1:03:19] the anointing is not emotions but the
[1:03:21] anointing is supreme power in in control
[1:03:25] knowing what and how amen amen it's a
[1:03:29] revelation that's imparted in the church
[1:03:31] to loose the power of the Holy Spirit to
[1:03:34] show you who you are to show you what
[1:03:37] lays within you that you might declare
[1:03:40] the glory of God in your life now
[1:03:43] brother bradam could look back in
[1:03:44] history and explain the the man
[1:03:46] anointing the lion anointing the ox
[1:03:48] anointing but he could not look back in
[1:03:51] history and explain the eagle anointing
[1:03:53] right cuz it wasn't history brother Bram
[1:03:57] said in the Easter seal the eagle
[1:03:58] anointing flew out in the opening of the
[1:04:01] seals it was the opening of the seals
[1:04:04] that loosed the eagle anointing upon the
[1:04:07] church so now that's why brother Bram
[1:04:10] couldn't explain in the seals what the
[1:04:14] eagle anointing did cuz it was only just
[1:04:18] then
[1:04:19] released and it was now going to produce
[1:04:22] in the church what had never been
[1:04:25] produced
[1:04:28] before what had never been produced
[1:04:32] before amen all of those Restorations
[1:04:34] and things they're part of the church
[1:04:37] but that's not the eagle anointing
[1:04:40] that's the man anointing and so the
[1:04:42] explanation of the eagle anointing and
[1:04:45] what it is to accomplish is in the
[1:04:48] messages that follows the
[1:04:51] seals because now under that anointing
[1:04:54] as brother brandham said when the seals
[1:04:56] open the Bible became a new book to me
[1:05:00] and he began to preach the word of God
[1:05:03] under the inspiration that was given for
[1:05:05] you and for me not doing away with the
[1:05:08] messages that were before the seals they
[1:05:10] were legitimate Holy Ghost messages sent
[1:05:13] into the church to cap off the
[1:05:14] restoration and Reformation period but
[1:05:17] that ended at the opening of the seals
[1:05:19] to bring the church into the very mind
[1:05:21] of Christ as Christ now is revealed
[1:05:24] himself he's saying to his Prophet he's
[1:05:27] saying to the church come up higher the
[1:05:30] breach between the church ages in the
[1:05:32] seals a door was opened in heaven now
[1:05:35] it's now it's come to give you a
[1:05:37] different perspective because if you
[1:05:39] realize what happens under the eagle
[1:05:40] anointing what's takes place the man
[1:05:43] anointing the lion anointing the ox
[1:05:45] anointing were all Earthbound
[1:05:48] creatures but now the eagle yes sees it
[1:05:52] differently he rises above it all you
[1:05:56] know the lion can't see the forest for
[1:05:58] the
[1:05:59] trees you know the ox can't see anywhere
[1:06:03] past the field he's
[1:06:04] in the man he sees the buildings but he
[1:06:08] can't see what's behind the buildings
[1:06:10] but the eagle rises above it all and
[1:06:13] sees the oh my sees the Eternal purpose
[1:06:16] of God in a three-fold manner that was
[1:06:19] unveiled in the opening of the seventh
[1:06:21] seal to bring the true revelation of the
[1:06:23] believer into the believer to lose the
[1:06:26] entire power of the Holy
[1:06:31] Ghost listen the entire power of the
[1:06:33] Holy Ghost isn't about just going to
[1:06:34] church and shouting and jumping and
[1:06:36] doing all those kind of things now if
[1:06:38] you want to go to church and shout and
[1:06:40] jump and and have gifts of the Spirit
[1:06:41] and all that go for it praise the Lord
[1:06:45] those things are in the body but that's
[1:06:47] not the eagle
[1:06:48] anointing
[1:06:51] hallelujah praise the Lord you still
[1:06:54] with me or you want to throw me out all
[1:06:59] right Hallelujah now when we look back
[1:07:02] in the Old Testament Abraham Moses
[1:07:05] Ezekiel Jacob Daniel all of these
[1:07:07] brothers when they looked at Christ now
[1:07:11] remember the new birth is a divine
[1:07:12] revelation of Jesus Christ personally to
[1:07:14] you when they looked at Christ they all
[1:07:17] saw something
[1:07:19] different but it was the same
[1:07:22] one that's why brother brand says when
[1:07:25] when Jesus went into Paradise to empty
[1:07:28] it out and knocked at the door and he
[1:07:30] says
[1:07:31] and there there's Abraham and Sarah
[1:07:34] there he is
[1:07:37] melkisedek the one we met on the plains
[1:07:39] of memmory the one that gave me strength
[1:07:42] to Bear seed here he
[1:07:43] is there was Daniel was looking at and
[1:07:46] say oh there he is the Ancient of Days
[1:07:49] right there he is there's Ezekiel saying
[1:07:52] there he is the wheel within the wheel
[1:07:54] right Oh my he they all knew him there
[1:07:58] Moses saw him oh the one I saw is hind
[1:08:00] Parts but now I see him face to face
[1:08:04] hallelujah oh everybody recognizing this
[1:08:06] is the one I met this is the one I was
[1:08:08] telling you about they might have been
[1:08:10] there hundreds of years discussing how
[1:08:12] God revealed himself to them but now
[1:08:15] when he come into their midst they all
[1:08:17] of a sudden realize he's the same one
[1:08:19] right it was a different manifestation
[1:08:22] God and morphe representing himself in
[1:08:24] every age but he's the same one he has
[1:08:27] the same power he has the same promises
[1:08:31] the same one that promised to Abraham
[1:08:33] that he would rise again to Joe that in
[1:08:35] my flesh I shall see God that that to
[1:08:38] Moses to to Joseph don't bury me here in
[1:08:41] Egypt take me back to the promised land
[1:08:44] all of the Revelation that was in their
[1:08:46] heart now they're standing in his
[1:08:47] presence in the Fulfillment of their
[1:08:50] expectation and there'll be a people in
[1:08:52] the last days that have an expectation
[1:08:55] for the body
[1:08:56] change Amen brother Ram talks about he
[1:08:59] says you might have come out of
[1:09:00] Methodist you might have come out of
[1:09:01] Baptist you might have come out of
[1:09:02] different groups with different ideas
[1:09:04] but as the word becomes real to you and
[1:09:07] the power of God is loosed in your life
[1:09:09] listen I came out of
[1:09:11] Pentecostalism I went to Bible school
[1:09:14] for four
[1:09:17] days my niece asked me why didn't you go
[1:09:20] any longer I says I didn't find what I
[1:09:21] was looking for she said says what were
[1:09:24] you looking for I said
[1:09:27] God even before I had the message I knew
[1:09:29] God wasn't
[1:09:31] there praise the
[1:09:33] Lord by Grace is
[1:09:35] right we thank God for his mercies in
[1:09:38] our lives that we don't get scrupled up
[1:09:40] with all kinds of men's ideas and as God
[1:09:43] takes his word and washes Us in the
[1:09:46] water of the word how many of you know
[1:09:48] him better today than you did when you
[1:09:51] were first
[1:09:52] Saved yes we all do praise the Lord why
[1:09:56] because he's continually revealing
[1:09:59] himself we we're birth then potentially
[1:10:02] all the power laid in us at the new
[1:10:05] birth but it can only be loosed by the
[1:10:09] Revelation that is deposited in your
[1:10:12] life because the power is limited to the
[1:10:15] Revelation i' go a step further and say
[1:10:18] the Revelation is limited to the
[1:10:19] character
[1:10:21] right that's why there's a molding
[1:10:23] process of our character you don't
[1:10:25] receive the character of Christ when
[1:10:27] you're born again because the baptism of
[1:10:29] the Holy Ghost is a gift but character
[1:10:32] is a
[1:10:34] victory Hallelujah you with me all
[1:10:45] right brother Brown says in things that
[1:10:47] are to be one of his last messages he
[1:10:50] says sorry I need to just check while
[1:10:52] I'm close to closing time
[1:10:55] here he says you see the whole program
[1:10:57] the whole church is built upon divine
[1:11:00] revelation Jesus said in Matthew the
[1:11:02] 16th chapter flesh and blood has not
[1:11:04] revealed this to you but my Father which
[1:11:06] is in heaven has revealed this to you
[1:11:08] what is it a revelation of who he was he
[1:11:11] says Upon This Rock I'll build my church
[1:11:13] and the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail
[1:11:15] against it the revelation of Jesus
[1:11:16] Christ in this
[1:11:18] hour not what he was in another hour
[1:11:22] right what he was
[1:11:24] now he says the great church that he
[1:11:27] established on the day of Pentecost by
[1:11:30] the sending of the Holy Ghost had to
[1:11:32] suffer martyrdom go into the dirt into
[1:11:35] the Earth in the Dark Age to bring forth
[1:11:39] again in the age of Luther and come on
[1:11:43] out to the full statue of the Bride of
[1:11:46] Jesus Christ in this last day Hallelujah
[1:11:52] rising of the Sun
[1:11:54] you know the revelation of Jesus in you
[1:11:58] the revelation of Jesus Christ to you
[1:12:00] but now listen what is the revelation of
[1:12:01] Jesus Christ to you he says in Rising of
[1:12:04] the sun he
[1:12:08] says I want to just catch the context
[1:12:13] here when Peter told him Thou Art the
[1:12:16] Christ the son of God he said blessed
[1:12:19] art thou Simon son of Jonah's Flesh and
[1:12:20] Blood never this revealed this to you
[1:12:23] but my Father which in heaven has
[1:12:24] revealed Upon This Rock I'll build my
[1:12:26] church Gates of Hell cannot Prevail
[1:12:28] against it I give you the keys whatever
[1:12:30] you bind on Earth I'll bind in heaven
[1:12:32] whatever you loose on Earth so forth
[1:12:34] then he says that's the divine
[1:12:36] revelation of the word made
[1:12:39] flesh it was flesh in that day by the
[1:12:43] son the
[1:12:45] groom it's a flesh today by the
[1:12:51] bride so what is the Revelation that
[1:12:54] God's getting in you it's your name on
[1:12:57] the Lamb's Book of Life what is the
[1:13:00] revealing of the son of man it's the
[1:13:02] revealing of your position in that book
[1:13:06] Because when John wept because nobody
[1:13:09] could open the book he wasn't weeping
[1:13:12] that for any other reason than the fact
[1:13:14] that he realized if nobody could open
[1:13:17] the book If nobody could break the seals
[1:13:19] if nobody could redeem the book then all
[1:13:21] Humanity was lost because the names of
[1:13:24] the elect are written on the book and if
[1:13:27] nobody could redeem the book then the
[1:13:30] elect were lost that's why the devil
[1:13:32] tries to attack the word because it's
[1:13:34] the Redemption of the attributes of God
[1:13:37] but
[1:13:38] now John was told don't weep John for
[1:13:42] the lion of the tribe of Judah has
[1:13:44] prevailed to open the book and to loose
[1:13:46] the seals thereof and John looked to see
[1:13:49] the lion and he saw the lamb as it had
[1:13:51] been slain he saw Christ a bleeding
[1:13:54] sacrifice and seeing Christ there a
[1:13:57] bleeding sacrifice take the book I'll
[1:13:59] tell you what John rejoiced all Heaven
[1:14:02] rejoiced the elders C Cast down their
[1:14:05] crowns they know this is what it's all
[1:14:07] about he has redeemed us from every
[1:14:10] Kindred tongue and Nation he has paid
[1:14:13] the price and now we can come back what
[1:14:16] we were meant to be we can hold in
[1:14:18] possession the title deed of our
[1:14:21] inheritance that Adam lost it's our
[1:14:24] hours Hallelujah he paid the price at
[1:14:27] Calvary was spending 2,000 years of
[1:14:30] intercession but in the last days he
[1:14:32] stepped forth to say it's yours amen we
[1:14:37] don't understand what that statement
[1:14:38] means do we when he says it's yours what
[1:14:41] he's what he's done now in the opening
[1:14:43] of the seals is to reveal the mysteries
[1:14:47] of the reality of who you are you're not
[1:14:49] Church you're bride all right start
[1:14:52] let's start there you're not just a
[1:14:54] sinner saved by grace you're an
[1:14:56] attribute that was in the thoughts of
[1:14:58] God before the foundation of the world
[1:15:00] you always were in the mind of God he
[1:15:02] always loved
[1:15:04] you you're always a part of him you're
[1:15:07] an expression of God ordained to this
[1:15:09] age to manifest the word of this hour
[1:15:12] under the anointing of this hour amen
[1:15:15] I'm not living in the day of Pentecostal
[1:15:17] I'm not living in the day of Lutheran
[1:15:19] I'm not living in the day of weslan I'm
[1:15:21] not living under an ox anointing that's
[1:15:23] not my anointing I'm not even living
[1:15:25] under a lion anointing I'm living under
[1:15:28] the anointing of the eagle yes sir
[1:15:30] Hallelujah I'll get right into tonight's
[1:15:32] message if I go any further but it's
[1:15:34] it's got to come to the fullness of the
[1:15:37] power to bring you to a revelation of
[1:15:39] what's written on that book because
[1:15:40] what's written on that book is the
[1:15:42] reality it's not only the reality of who
[1:15:44] you are it's the reality of who Paul was
[1:15:47] it's the reality of who John was it's
[1:15:49] the reality of who James was it's the
[1:15:52] reality they prob that Paul says now we
[1:15:54] look through a glass Darkly but then
[1:15:56] face to face we're beholding it as a
[1:16:00] mystery but then we shall know even as
[1:16:02] we are known then we shall see him as he
[1:16:05] is then we will recognize our position
[1:16:08] in Jesus Christ the devil when the bride
[1:16:11] recognizes who she is she will be an
[1:16:15] undefeatable
[1:16:18] army sometimes we leave these things out
[1:16:20] and say oh we need some carnal
[1:16:22] expression or some fleshly expression we
[1:16:25] Lord give me some kind of outward
[1:16:26] manifestation if that's what you need go
[1:16:29] for
[1:16:30] it go for it you want to see some kind
[1:16:33] it's all available to you right it's all
[1:16:37] there you want to speak in tongues I
[1:16:39] spoke in
[1:16:40] tongues you want to have interpretations
[1:16:42] I've had interpretations I've had dreams
[1:16:44] I've had Visions I've had all of these
[1:16:45] kind of things just personally and I'm
[1:16:47] not making anything out of myself I've
[1:16:49] seen God heal the sick I've seen God Ra
[1:16:50] the raise the dead I've seen all kinds
[1:16:52] of Supernatural thing I've seen God stop
[1:16:55] storms I've seen him stop storms just
[1:16:58] like
[1:16:59] that I've seen God do those things by
[1:17:02] the way I'm not stopping the rain in
[1:17:03] case you're
[1:17:06] wondering has to come you know brother
[1:17:08] Brown even said about the third P he
[1:17:09] says you'll notice it wasn't me it was
[1:17:12] him that told me to do
[1:17:14] it it's not in a man but it's God in the
[1:17:19] man and so all those things we've seen
[1:17:22] all those things but where does it come
[1:17:25] from it comes from the revelation of the
[1:17:28] word made flesh in
[1:17:33] me I'm not any more worthy than any of
[1:17:35] you I'm not any better than any of you I
[1:17:40] say it's all available to you and it's
[1:17:43] unlocked in the mystery of this message
[1:17:45] that's been
[1:17:47] revealed under an anointing that God has
[1:17:50] sent in this day to raise you up into a
[1:17:54] faith that is greater than the world has
[1:17:57] ever
[1:18:00] seen the only thing comparable would be
[1:18:03] the seed that went into the ground the
[1:18:05] Lord Jesus Christ himself it was the
[1:18:08] word made flesh in that day of the
[1:18:10] bridegroom now it's the word made flesh
[1:18:13] in this day by the
[1:18:15] bride let me give you a couple more
[1:18:18] quotes and then we
[1:18:21] close this is just a foundation for
[1:18:23] tonight's service I want to go there
[1:18:26] right now you know it's just throbbing
[1:18:29] in my
[1:18:30] heart he says an Easter seal he says
[1:18:34] every time a religious power went forth
[1:18:36] to meet the challenge of the political
[1:18:37] power of the world when the lion raised
[1:18:39] up the Pol religious power it went to
[1:18:42] meet the Roman
[1:18:43] power and then when it come to the
[1:18:45] sacrifice hour the ox went out because
[1:18:47] the sacrifice beasts to the Lord then
[1:18:50] come the reformers down through the
[1:18:51] church ages the face of a man than
[1:18:53] reformers have been since Luther Wesley
[1:18:56] Calvin on down Pentecostal age but in
[1:19:00] the last message that went forth there
[1:19:03] came a flying

[1:19:40] on the other side in this world it's God
[1:19:44] hidden in Simplicity and revealed in the
[1:19:50] same Saints don't try to make
[1:19:54] God into some kind of a public
[1:19:58] show don't do it he doesn't want to do
[1:20:02] it he wants to make himself known to
[1:20:06] you everything that you have need of is
[1:20:10] yours it all ultimately goes back to
[1:20:13] only beli if he'll reveal it to you
[1:20:16] accept what he'll reveal to you he says
[1:20:19] in the Rapture message also one of his
[1:20:22] last messages
[1:20:23] he says in Wesley's Age The Works that
[1:20:26] he did testified who he was in Luther's
[1:20:29] age on the Reformation I sure it
[1:20:32] testified who he was in the days of the
[1:20:36] Pentecostals the restoring back of the
[1:20:38] gifts the restoration of the gifts
[1:20:41] speaking in tongues casting out Devils

[1:21:47] put you in a mindset that Adam had
[1:21:50] before the
[1:21:51] fall to put you back in a place Romans 8
[1:21:55] says the manifestation of the sons of
[1:21:57] God all creation groans for is to put
[1:21:59] your mind I'll prove it to you tonight
