[0:00] genesis chapter 22 verse 4.
[0:03] i just want to read verse 4 and then
[0:05] jump right into it i'm uh supremely
[0:07] excited tonight i'm super excited to be
[0:09] ministering and so i'm so grateful for
[0:11] this opportunity that i have tonight
[0:13] genesis 22 verse 4 then on the third day
[0:16] abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the
[0:19] place so far off we know that god had
[0:21] told him to go into the land of moriah
[0:23] and now on the third day of travel then
[0:24] on the third day abraham lifted up his
[0:27] eyes and saw the place
[0:29] of far off let's pray our heavenly
[0:31] father we're grateful to be gathered
[0:33] together this evening as family
[0:35] the most precious family that we could
[0:36] think of the family of god
[0:39] and lord we share a common dna we share
[0:42] a common blood to be a part of this
[0:44] family we have to share a common
[0:45] experience
[0:47] and i'm grateful that we have this
[0:48] privilege as family together tonight
[0:51] and as you would be dealing with hearts
[0:53] even to become a part of that family
[0:54] lord we welcome those who seek a new
[0:56] birth experience without open arms lord
[0:59] we welcome those who are in search of
[1:01] healing we welcome those who have minds
[1:04] plagued with doubt and have questions
[1:06] and even those that just have uh
[1:08] perplexions in life and they're just
[1:10] seeking truth lord we welcome them
[1:12] because we know that in your word
[1:14] there's an answer for any need that a
[1:16] man would have any question that a
[1:19] person would have so father tonight we
[1:20] commit ourselves to you desiring that
[1:22] you take the bread of life and break it
[1:23] to us
[1:24] take this gathering though it may be
[1:26] humble in the eyes of man we believe in
[1:28] heaven
[1:29] this is a significant gathering and may
[1:31] we may that realization dawn upon us
[1:33] tonight as we feel your presence and
[1:35] your nearness to us now
[1:37] we take take these things father which
[1:39] we've read the things that will be
[1:40] shared
[1:41] and just harness them lord use them be
[1:43] in them father is a a power to set free
[1:47] and a power to encourage we ask this in
[1:49] the name lord jesus christ amen
[1:52] you can be seated
[1:53] our subject continues to be supreme
[1:56] faith revealed in abraham this is just
[1:58] the third service in this thought
[2:00] supreme faith revealed in abraham and
[2:04] i'd like to say at the outset that
[2:07] uh
[2:08] what i'm preaching tonight i would say
[2:10] if things kind of unfolded the way they
[2:12] normally would when i preach a series
[2:14] this is where i would end because often
[2:17] times when something's inspired to me i
[2:18] kind of see the end and then once i
[2:20] start studying it things start opening
[2:22] up to me and sometimes i never get to
[2:24] the end things just keep coming up in
[2:26] front of him but i'm usually chasing
[2:28] something that the lord has shown me a
[2:29] vision maybe that i have of a thought or
[2:31] a revelation that comes to me and then i
[2:34] just start digging into it and just
[2:36] thought after thought keeps building to
[2:37] it maybe at the end it just kind of
[2:39] completes this picture
[2:41] but as brother brennan made that
[2:42] statement about supreme faith and how to
[2:45] have supreme faith you have to know
[2:46] perfectly what you're doing and we've
[2:48] been preaching on a blind trust and bad
[2:50] faith when god dealt with me in the life
[2:52] of abraham and i started looking into
[2:54] his life what i'm preaching tonight was
[2:56] really what uh was the clincher for me
[2:59] and stood out to me in terms of what
[3:01] supreme faith is in this hour so i'm
[3:03] very excited to kind of preach this as
[3:05] maybe coming to the the punch line as it
[3:08] were or pulling back the curtain and say
[3:09] this is what we're talking about this is
[3:11] this is what ought to inspire us about
[3:13] the faith of abraham and then it just
[3:15] made a lot of sense to me this week and
[3:16] looking at it that if we could see that
[3:18] this is ultimately what god wants us to
[3:21] see in the life of abraham and then back
[3:23] up and start looking at his life it'll
[3:25] just help us to relate so much more to
[3:27] the supreme faith that abraham had he
[3:29] realized that if we just live a life
[3:31] that we're called to live and walk in
[3:33] truth and stay in the light then the
[3:35] supernatural things that are prophesied
[3:37] to take place in this hour will just
[3:38] happen as you're walking
[3:40] and as you just go forward in your daily
[3:42] life so we've been looking at the
[3:44] subject of supreme faith we've mentioned
[3:46] how that when we use the term supreme
[3:47] faith it might seem to be out of reach
[3:49] for us like oh well supreme faith that
[3:52] seems impossible it seems unreachable
[3:54] unreachable but really that's going to
[3:56] stem from a misunderstanding of what
[3:58] supreme faith is the way that we
[4:00] characterize faith and what faith looks
[4:03] like and we feel like well if you can't
[4:04] put your hands on a dead body and raise
[4:06] them from the grave then you don't have
[4:07] faith or if you can't
[4:09] if you can't create something by faith
[4:11] if you can't do certain things or speak
[4:13] in tongues then you don't really have
[4:14] faith and i would say that's faith being
[4:16] misunderstood
[4:18] to put your hands on a dead body and
[4:20] pray for them come back to life that's
[4:22] faith but if you've never had that
[4:24] chance to do so doesn't mean you don't
[4:26] have faith and so um it's something
[4:29] that is often misunderstood and i think
[4:31] this might be a perfect opportunity to
[4:33] mention that brother loyal has it in his
[4:35] will
[4:36] that if he ever dies that you have to
[4:37] first
[4:38] lay hands on him and try to
[4:40] bring him back to life again and so
[4:42] that's i don't know if that gets cut out
[4:44] of the will if you don't do it uh so
[4:47] but he told me that he has this clause
[4:49] in his uh estate that if you'd
[4:52] someone has to at least lay their hands
[4:54] on him when he's dead and believing in
[4:55] the resurrection and so we let the
[4:58] church know as our legal duty
[5:00] to
[5:00] honor that in case
[5:02] we come across loyal slumped body we
[5:05] want to lay hands on them and pray them
[5:06] back but we would say that if we were
[5:08] unsuccessful in calling loyal back from
[5:11] the dead
[5:12] that would not be because we don't lack
[5:13] we because we don't have faith
[5:15] oftentimes faith is just misunderstood
[5:17] that it has to present a certain way or
[5:18] supreme faith has to present a certain
[5:20] way
[5:21] but the example of abraham shows that
[5:24] supreme faith let's say a supreme faith
[5:26] is exhibited in laying hands on someone
[5:29] who's dead and bringing them back to
[5:30] life we don't go hunting dead bodies
[5:33] to try to manifest faith
[5:35] we just live a life of faith and if we
[5:38] ever come across a body that needs
[5:39] resurrection you're in the you're in the
[5:41] best place to do it and so we really see
[5:43] in the the faith of abraham the supreme
[5:45] faith the example of abraham shows that
[5:47] supreme faith will come by daily acts of
[5:50] faith brother bram says you're just in
[5:52] the routine of trusting god and you
[5:53] trust god and he fulfills his word so
[5:55] often that you just expect him to do it
[5:58] and that's really what abraham
[5:59] demonstrates his daily acts of faith to
[6:02] where god was constantly keeping his
[6:03] word and communion with him so it became
[6:05] a routine to expect the supernatural to
[6:08] see god keep his word
[6:10] and so using the phrase supreme faith
[6:13] revealed in abraham we're looking at how
[6:16] his faith is an example of rapturing
[6:18] faith and so supreme faith rapture and
[6:20] faith perfect faith those are all terms
[6:22] that we could use to create this upper
[6:25] echelon of faith and then we might feel
[6:27] like well i'll never get there it's only
[6:28] for certain people and
[6:30] and only for preachers that was only for
[6:32] the prophet and you're really selling
[6:33] yourself short
[6:35] because the reason why it was
[6:36] demonstrated in the life of a prophet is
[6:38] so that the bride could come to that
[6:40] that place of faith it may not reflect
[6:42] itself in this the specific gifts and
[6:45] the public ministry that he had but
[6:47] there was things demonstrated in his
[6:49] life and things that are left for us to
[6:51] read in great detail so that we could
[6:53] have faith to believe in the same god
[6:54] that we too by following the word of god
[6:57] can see the life of christ unfold in our
[6:59] lives so
[7:00] this rapturing faith is is the
[7:03] the faith that abraham is an example of
[7:06] and we know that as we looked at sunday
[7:08] how that abraham believed in a god that
[7:11] was personally revealed to him
[7:14] it wasn't a god his dad told him about
[7:16] it wasn't a god
[7:18] of ham sham or japheth of his relatives
[7:20] it was a god that made himself known
[7:23] uh to abraham and you'll notice that
[7:25] whenever they talk about the god of
[7:27] israel
[7:28] as a nation it's the god of abraham
[7:29] isaac and jacob and they don't say that
[7:31] god of terror they don't say the god
[7:33] of of nimrod they don't go and they
[7:35] don't say the god of adam
[7:38] it's the god that revealed himself to
[7:40] abraham and this is what makes his faith
[7:42] so distinct is that he had this very
[7:44] simple and and i'd like to even use the
[7:46] phrase pure faith it was a pure faith
[7:48] simple and pure faith towards god and he
[7:50] believed in god
[7:52] and so it was faith in the word this is
[7:54] something i think is so important to
[7:55] catch it was faith in the word that
[7:57] moved abraham
[7:59] when he left from earned the land of the
[8:00] chaldeas from the valley of shinar he he
[8:03] moved by faith he didn't move because
[8:05] his family was moving though his family
[8:06] went with them he didn't move because
[8:08] there was an opportunity for wealth
[8:11] though he did come into great
[8:13] possessions as god blessed him he didn't
[8:15] he didn't go as an explorer
[8:17] and as one who who was restless to see
[8:20] what was on the other side of the seas
[8:22] or one that heard of some fantastic
[8:24] sights to be seen in another land it
[8:26] wasn't exploration it wasn't adventure
[8:28] it wasn't curiosity it wasn't family it
[8:30] wasn't fame it wasn't wealth it wasn't
[8:32] um it wasn't some sort of position that
[8:35] was available to him it was faith alone
[8:38] and it's remarkable the way that god
[8:39] allows the story to unfold he says i
[8:41] want you to get up and i want you to
[8:42] leave your land your family and go to a
[8:44] place i'll show you later
[8:46] so that it's not the appearance of the
[8:48] place that causes you to get go
[8:51] if you'd shown them a land flowing with
[8:53] milk and honey and well watered planes
[8:55] and everything very beautiful and
[8:56] gorgeous you might have said well that
[8:57] makes a lot of sense i'll go there
[8:59] i kind of like i'd remark to my wife
[9:01] after we went and visited uh jackson
[9:03] wyoming a couple weeks ago and said well
[9:05] i think there's a reason why god waited
[9:06] till we had moved to phoenix and started
[9:08] a church there before he went to jackson
[9:10] because i probably said well jackson
[9:12] would be a great place to start a church
[9:14] and where two or three are gathered
[9:15] together and we just make sure that
[9:17] elizabeth i always made it to church and
[9:19] we'd have two or three gather together
[9:21] and a jackson whole church sounds he has
[9:24] a nice ring to it
[9:25] but uh it wasn't the appearance
[9:28] of canaan that drew abraham there
[9:31] it was god telling them to do it
[9:34] and then you look at the example of
[9:35] abraham and i'm i'm backgrounding this
[9:38] uh not not to add fluff to the to the
[9:40] message but just so that we're all kind
[9:41] of falling in these same tracks as god
[9:43] has dealt with my heart over these last
[9:44] few weeks
[9:46] that if you looked at abraham and we see
[9:48] what brother branham taught about him
[9:50] and even what the scripture says
[9:51] joshua's saying your fathers even tara
[9:54] on the other side of the flood worship
[9:55] strange idols and were idol worshipers
[9:58] and abraham himself not being a jew
[10:00] since the nation of the jews comes from
[10:02] the children of abraham
[10:04] he was an idol worshiper himself and
[10:07] that all of the world everyone having
[10:09] just re you know
[10:10] in the i say recent but just in the
[10:12] chronology built a tower to avoid the
[10:15] judges of god or dispersed throughout
[10:16] the earth due to and separated according
[10:19] to their different languages from the
[10:20] tower of babel and are worshipping false
[10:23] gods setting up false systems and false
[10:25] ways of worship and denying the true god
[10:27] and in our in in these uh
[10:30] uh false idol worship and so ma all of
[10:33] mankind and even abraham's family we say
[10:35] even himself
[10:37] are worshiping idols that can be seen
[10:41] building groves and erecting altars and
[10:44] worshipping the moon and worshipping the
[10:45] sun and fashioning images of things that
[10:48] would be idols that they would lay down
[10:50] before in worship and these were things
[10:52] that were to be seen and now all of a
[10:53] sudden abraham has a revelation an
[10:56] unction that cannot be seen by others he
[10:58] can't share it with them materially he
[11:00] can't express it to him in such a way to
[11:02] where they can see what he saw but god
[11:05] speaks to him through divine declaration
[11:07] and god has a revelation a way that he
[11:10] reveals himself to him whether it's
[11:11] dream or vision or some appearance he
[11:13] begins to worship a god that can't be
[11:15] seen
[11:16] and to me that's something that's very
[11:18] important to recognize about abraham's
[11:20] faith
[11:21] that matured to supreme faith
[11:24] is that in the midst of idol worship
[11:26] where people are bowing to the senses
[11:27] what could be seen and what could be
[11:29] felt he bowed to an invisible god
[11:32] and he worshipped the invisible supreme
[11:35] brother makes the statement in the
[11:36] masterpiece he's talking about how the
[11:38] bride is another masterpiece in the
[11:40] making she is the new testament as
[11:42] christ is the old testament
[11:44] and he makes this statement in the
[11:45] context of the seed being sown and
[11:47] coming to manifestation he says as a as
[11:49] he started in abraham
[11:51] after the fall of the first masterpiece
[11:54] he talked about god now started in
[11:56] abraham on a foundation to build another
[11:59] masterpiece so in looking at the life of
[12:01] abraham i just this to me stood out so
[12:03] tremendously that he is the foundation
[12:06] of the masterpiece christ
[12:08] and he's the he's the foundation of he's
[12:10] the mast he is the beginning of that
[12:12] masterpiece he uses abraham as the
[12:14] foundation of another masterpiece and so
[12:17] he uses the language of a seed being
[12:19] sown
[12:20] so the seed promised to abraham and
[12:22] we're taking from a lot of scriptures in
[12:24] the new testament that we haven't even
[12:25] looked at yet but the seed sown or the
[12:28] seed promised to abraham culminated in
[12:30] jesus christ because that's who this
[12:32] seed was that seed is jesus christ and
[12:35] just as jesus christ was the culmination
[12:37] of what began in abraham the bride is
[12:40] the culmination that began on the day of
[12:41] pentecost
[12:43] god birth in his church there's a
[12:44] culmination there's a climax to that
[12:46] this other masterpiece in the making so
[12:49] when we look at abraham as the
[12:51] foundation to build another masterpiece
[12:53] he is the seed then he's the seed that
[12:55] god sows or if you want to look at it as
[12:57] the seed of faith being sown in abraham
[12:59] reaching this ultimate manifestation in
[13:01] christ we have you look at the character
[13:04] of abraham of being associated with or
[13:06] holding that seed of another masterpiece
[13:09] and the seed is what holds the mystery
[13:10] of the plant
[13:12] so the things that are sown into abraham
[13:14] the faith that abraham has results in
[13:16] jesus christ the manifestation of jesus
[13:18] christ and so we can begin to look at
[13:20] the life of abraham and the promises
[13:22] given to abraham and see how god dealt
[13:24] with abraham the promise that god gave
[13:26] to abraham the experiences that abraham
[13:28] had and we begin to see that he held the
[13:31] mystery of christ and i'll come to
[13:34] something in the end very scriptural
[13:36] that just is very very evident in terms
[13:38] of how abraham
[13:40] holds this definite connection to jesus
[13:42] christ and he demonstrates something to
[13:45] us when we say we want to be like christ
[13:47] we want to live the life of christ we
[13:48] want to be christ-like christ is going
[13:50] to be born into manifestation in this
[13:52] hour and the full word is born into
[13:53] manifestation and we use these
[13:54] terminology you can go back to abraham
[13:57] to see the genesis of this
[13:59] we see tremendous examples unfold in his
[14:00] life
[14:02] now james chapter 2 verses 21 and 22 it
[14:05] says was not abraham our father
[14:07] justified by works when he had offered
[14:10] isaac his son upon the altar these
[14:12] scriptures really solidified my use of
[14:14] the term supreme faith related to
[14:16] abraham because james looking at it from
[14:19] a different perspective than paul but
[14:20] yet both of them showing the truth in
[14:23] its full spectrum together is saying
[14:25] that abraham was justified by works when
[14:28] was he justified fully vindicated made
[14:30] made righteous by his works when he did
[14:33] this specific act when he offered isaac
[14:35] upon the altar
[14:37] so
[14:38] abraham always had faith
[14:40] he didn't find faith the day that he
[14:42] offered isaac up he always had faith but
[14:45] there's some justification some
[14:47] vindication confirmation that transpires
[14:50] in the time and it's the manifestation
[14:52] of the faith that had always been hidden
[14:53] in abraham or the faith he always
[14:55] professed the things that he always
[14:56] believed there was some something that
[14:59] stepped forward and manifested itself in
[15:01] abraham's faith so that anyone looking
[15:04] at his faith would say well he had the
[15:05] goods he believed what he said in this
[15:08] act as we see that his justification is
[15:10] from maybe the the works or the outward
[15:13] appearance
[15:14] and then he makes the statement seeing
[15:15] thou how seest thou how faith wrought
[15:18] with his works so there is faith that
[15:20] was wrought with his works and there was
[15:22] a working together and by works was
[15:25] faith made perfect he's asking us do we
[15:27] see this and so we could say that by
[15:29] works his faith was made perfect
[15:33] and faith made perfect it's a phrase
[15:35] that it's meaning reached full fully
[15:37] consummated development and one of the
[15:39] phrases used in the translations is
[15:41] supreme expression
[15:43] that abraham's faith had reached its
[15:45] full and supreme expression so by by
[15:48] this work it was a supreme faith
[15:50] expressed
[15:52] it had reached its full expression and
[15:54] it's remarkable that it would be in that
[15:56] work
[15:57] that his faith is justified or that we
[16:00] could say his faith reached its supreme
[16:02] expression
[16:03] so this is the question that i'm i'm
[16:05] going to answer tonight
[16:06] not not maybe uh
[16:09] exhaustively but the question is what is
[16:12] it about this act
[16:14] of offering up his son isaac upon the
[16:16] altar that justified abraham's faith
[16:20] how how was this
[16:22] an act of supreme faith
[16:25] how is it that james could say that in
[16:27] offering abraham upon the isaac upon the
[16:29] altar abraham's faith was made perfect
[16:32] so what is it perfect faith
[16:34] supreme faith and and so we're pondering
[16:37] that at this juncture now i want to read
[16:39] genesis chapter 22
[16:40] verses 1 to 14.
[16:43] i this is maybe an exercise where i have
[16:45] to read it so that it's entered into
[16:47] evidence
[16:49] so this is being entered into evidence
[16:51] so that i can refer to it later
[16:53] because if i don't if i don't read it
[16:55] i'm always gonna feel like i'm lacking
[16:56] some key component here so this is one
[16:58] of the exhibits that's being offered
[17:00] into evidence by reading it i can just
[17:01] say
[17:02] you know here and after referred to as
[17:04] genesis 22 and everyone will be on the
[17:06] same page
[17:07] so in genesis chapter 22 verses 1 to 14
[17:10] i i'm going to be i know you're going to
[17:12] pull on me to stop and want to connect
[17:14] things and bring things out of this but
[17:16] again i'm just entered into the record
[17:17] and we'll go into more closer
[17:18] examination and future questioning
[17:21] and it came to pass after these things
[17:23] that god did tempt abraham of course he
[17:25] doesn't tempt him like satan does and
[17:27] said unto him abraham and abraham said
[17:30] behold here i am here i am that's the
[17:32] way it ought to be right
[17:34] he said and he said take now thy son
[17:36] this is
[17:37] an important phrase thy only son isaac
[17:40] and what is
[17:41] what is ishmael saying like brother
[17:42] randy likes to say hey what am i chopped
[17:44] liver i mean here's ishmael over there
[17:45] going you know what about me i thought i
[17:47] was his first son he says thy only son
[17:49] isaac whom thou lovest and get thee into
[17:52] the land of moriah
[17:54] and offer him therefore burnt offering
[17:56] upon one of the mountains which i will
[17:58] tell thee of you notice how this happens
[18:00] so often with abraham
[18:02] i want you to start doing something but
[18:03] i'm not going to tell you exactly where
[18:04] you're going yet
[18:06] and so there's an example from the very
[18:08] first time he calls him in genesis 12
[18:10] now all these years later
[18:12] 30 something years later to where now
[18:14] he's actually
[18:16] uh saying you know what i want you to do
[18:18] this and i'm not going to tell you
[18:19] exactly where yet but you need to start
[18:20] walking
[18:21] and he says unto upon a mount which i
[18:23] will tell thee of and abraham rose up
[18:25] early in the morning
[18:27] saddled his ass and took two of his
[18:28] young men with him and isaac his son
[18:30] enclaved the wood for the burnt offering
[18:32] and rose up
[18:34] and went under the place of which god
[18:36] had told him
[18:37] so he's going to a place then maybe
[18:39] thereafter once he'd begun these certain
[18:41] things god tells him so there's a lot of
[18:43] activity there's actually at least two
[18:45] days of travel preparation and travel
[18:47] that are
[18:49] referred to there in verse three
[18:50] then on the third day
[18:53] abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the
[18:55] place afar off the place that god had
[18:56] told him of
[18:58] and abraham said to his young men abide
[19:00] ye here with the ass so now he's going
[19:01] to be a separation from the servants
[19:03] and i and the lad will go yonder in
[19:06] worship
[19:07] and
[19:08] come again to you
[19:10] and we know that even in the language
[19:12] that he uses
[19:13] he doesn't he's not implying that he's
[19:15] going to come back by himself
[19:17] but he's told to go to the top of a
[19:18] mountain sacrifice isaac but yet he says
[19:20] i am the latter going up and we'll come
[19:22] back down again
[19:23] verse 6 and abraham took the wood of the
[19:25] burnt offering and noticed the imagery
[19:27] that's being portrayed here and laid
[19:29] upon isaac his son
[19:32] the very wood that he was going to be
[19:33] sacrificed on isaac's carrying up the
[19:36] hill
[19:37] already pre-figuring what christ would
[19:38] do carrying his cross up mount calvary
[19:41] and he took the fire in his hand and a
[19:42] knife and they went both of them
[19:43] together and isaac spake unto abraham
[19:46] his father and said my father and he
[19:48] said here am i my son he said behold the
[19:50] fire and the wood but where is the lamb
[19:52] for a burnt offering isaac knew enough
[19:54] about sacrifices to know that the lamb
[19:56] was to be offered to the lord
[19:58] and he says and abraham said my son now
[20:01] this is such a tremendous statement god
[20:02] will provide himself
[20:04] a lamb for a burnt offering
[20:07] the offering was going to be to god and
[20:08] he's saying god will provide what is
[20:10] necessary god will god will provide
[20:12] jehovah will provide the required
[20:15] offering so they both of them
[20:18] they went both of them together and they
[20:20] came to the place again
[20:22] to the place which god had told him up
[20:25] so abraham's being very purposeful god
[20:27] tells him to do something he begins to
[20:28] do it god reveals it to them the rest it
[20:30] just unfolds as he walks and he comes
[20:32] with a place that god told him to go and
[20:34] abraham built an altar there and laid
[20:36] the wood in order and bound isaac his
[20:38] son and laid him on the altar upon the
[20:39] wood
[20:40] and abraham stretched forth his hand
[20:44] i in just reading it even now it's
[20:46] it's it's then that you wish maybe
[20:48] they could have given a little bit more
[20:50] detail
[20:52] like i i want to know what's going on i
[20:53] want to know if there's anything being
[20:55] said
[20:56] i you know did abraham have to finally
[20:58] pull i'm the dead you just do what i say
[21:01] thing with isaac eventually like look
[21:02] dad i'm stronger than you if i'm not
[21:04] gonna let you do this and he just had to
[21:05] say trust me
[21:06] i know what i'm doing
[21:08] but he just it seems to have happened
[21:10] with such ease builds an altar ties his
[21:12] son up puts him on the altar
[21:15] and abraham stretched forth his hand and
[21:18] took the knife to slay his son
[21:21] and the angel lord called unto him out
[21:23] of heaven and said abraham abraham
[21:26] and he said notice it third time here am
[21:28] i
[21:29] such a mellow guy right god says abraham
[21:31] here i am lord isaac says dad he goes
[21:33] here i am son
[21:34] and here he is he says here i am
[21:37] and he and he said lay not thy hand upon
[21:40] the lad neither do thou anything unto
[21:42] him
[21:43] notice this phrasing for now i know that
[21:46] thou fearest god seeing thou hast not
[21:48] withheld thy son thine only son from me
[21:52] and abraham lifted up his eyes and
[21:54] looked behold behind him a ram caught in
[21:56] a thicket by his horns now
[21:58] i i'm fairly certain that in all the
[22:00] commotion and the struggle with isaac
[22:02] they didn't just miss the ram over here
[22:04] tussling around in the thicket but god
[22:06] had created a ram
[22:08] something had been placed there in the
[22:09] moment the time that they needed it and
[22:11] here's this ram caught in a thicket by
[22:12] his horns and abraham went took the ram
[22:14] and offered him up for a burnt offering
[22:16] in the stead of his son
[22:19] notice the image that's being portrayed
[22:21] here's a god seemingly pronouncing
[22:23] judgment upon his the son of abraham he
[22:26] must die but then his son carries this
[22:29] wood up the hill to be sacrificed upon
[22:32] it and then god cr creates a sacrifice
[22:35] provides a sacrifice fulfilling what
[22:37] abraham already said would happen
[22:39] god will provide a sacrifice and then it
[22:41] says he's offered this is an offering
[22:43] instead of his son
[22:45] there's such beautiful imagery being
[22:47] portrayed here on this mount
[22:49] that is signifying jesus christ and it
[22:51] says and abraham called the name of that
[22:53] place jehovah jireh
[22:56] as it is said to this day in the mount
[22:58] of the lord it shall be seen
[23:01] and i'd love to just get more into this
[23:03] phrasing tonight but i i
[23:05] purposely removing some of these things
[23:07] that are inspired to me and quicken to
[23:09] me in this jehovah jireh is the name of
[23:11] the place and the throt the phrase the
[23:13] prophecy associated with it in the mount
[23:16] of the lord it shall be it shall be seen
[23:19] and this is tremendous phrasing because
[23:22] it's in this place in the mount of the
[23:24] lord it shall be seen the places that
[23:26] god had showed him and told him the lord
[23:27] spoke to get thee into the land of
[23:29] moriah
[23:30] so this was a place chosen by jehovah
[23:33] that's what it actually means a place
[23:35] chosen by jehovah and he's told by god
[23:38] to go upon one mountain that i will show
[23:40] you
[23:41] so the place that abraham comes to is a
[23:43] place chosen by god that god discloses
[23:46] that jehovah discloses to one man
[23:49] abraham he didn't get up there and
[23:51] there's a bunch of
[23:52] you know social media influences up
[23:54] there trying to get selfies in front of
[23:56] this uh famous ram thicket
[23:58] uh because everyone knew about it and
[24:00] there's a great alternative good shot
[24:01] and the lighting is just perfect at this
[24:03] particular time and everyone's clamoring
[24:05] to get up there no abraham alone goes to
[24:07] mount moriah a place chosen by jehovah
[24:11] upon one mountain that he said i will
[24:13] show you that's revealed to abraham and
[24:15] so this place in the mount of the lord
[24:17] it shall be seen
[24:19] this is the prophecy the lord inhabiting
[24:22] something and being seen in a particular
[24:24] place and this mount is on the eastern
[24:26] edge of jerusalem where solomon built
[24:28] the temple
[24:30] the place that god would dwell the place
[24:31] that he would make his permanent home
[24:33] and remember that's only a type of what
[24:35] you are
[24:38] and so in verse 4 it says on the third
[24:40] day after isaac had carried the wood of
[24:42] his sacrifice up the mount
[24:45] god appears to abraham provides a
[24:47] substitute sacrifice according to verse
[24:49] 8 saying my son god will provide himself
[24:51] a lamb for a burnt offering
[24:54] and then it says abraham named the place
[24:56] jehovah jireh which remember it means
[24:59] jehovah sees
[25:01] i i
[25:02] someone had come on my heart i think it
[25:03] was back in march somebody come on my
[25:05] heart while i was preparing for service
[25:06] and they came on my heart and i said
[25:08] brother i just the lord put something on
[25:09] my heart for you and i just said it's he
[25:12] sees and the brother was like oh great
[25:14] what have i done wrong
[25:15] like am i trying to expose something in
[25:17] his life and i kind of had to explain
[25:18] myself well what i meant by that is he
[25:19] sees what you're going through and i was
[25:21] like you know what just never mind come
[25:22] to church tonight
[25:24] but he says jehovah sees now we know we
[25:26] say jehovah jireh is my provider jehovah
[25:29] provides
[25:30] and that's what in the septuagint it
[25:32] talks about how jehovah provides and
[25:34] it's answering to the lord will provide
[25:36] himself a sacrifice so it's answering to
[25:38] that but it's more than just
[25:41] and i say more than god provides it all
[25:43] it's also
[25:45] that jehovah sees
[25:48] he's mindful
[25:49] he knows
[25:51] and insane he will provide and the
[25:53] phrase that he calls the place jehovah
[25:55] jair and to this day it said in the
[25:57] mount of the lord it shall be seen in
[25:58] other words as he has provided for me so
[26:00] will he provide to all for all those
[26:02] that trust in him
[26:04] this is the faith of abraham and the
[26:05] promised abraham seed just as he has
[26:07] provided for me father abraham he will
[26:10] provide for everyone else who trust in
[26:12] him like i do
[26:14] this is this is what he's declaring when
[26:16] he said name the place jehovah jireh
[26:18] this is the father of our faith
[26:20] signaling something to us this is a
[26:23] virtue that you ought to have trust in
[26:25] him because he sees and if you trust in
[26:27] him he'll do exactly for you what he did
[26:29] for me
[26:31] and when he says in the mount of the
[26:33] lord it shall be seen it's a prophecy of
[26:34] the messiah who would come and be the
[26:36] supreme sacrifice
[26:38] because here is a ram caught in a
[26:40] thicket provided by god the innocent
[26:41] that is slain in the instead of his son
[26:44] so it's prophecy that cro of the messiah
[26:48] it's prophecy that god would appear to
[26:50] his people in times of difficulty it's
[26:52] prophecy that god would appear in it to
[26:54] his people in a time of trouble it's
[26:56] prophecy that god would veil himself in
[26:58] flesh
[27:00] so these things that are spoken of in
[27:01] genesis 22 are very precious things
[27:06] and now
[27:06] in just looking at that and i wanted to
[27:08] continue on in the preceding verses as
[27:11] the angel begins to speak back to him
[27:14] and there's more that's disclosed on
[27:16] this mount moriah experience
[27:18] brother madam in referring to genesis
[27:20] chapter 18
[27:22] and how he made himself known to abraham
[27:25] in in
[27:26] veiled in flesh
[27:27] and disclosed himself to when he came to
[27:29] him discerned the thoughts of sarah in
[27:31] the tent behind him brother is referring
[27:33] to that instance it says one day when
[27:35] god seemed that his servant was
[27:37] determined to be an example for people
[27:39] of today
[27:40] now we might we might that might hit
[27:43] each one of us a little bit differently
[27:44] and maybe just in one or two different
[27:46] ways that abraham was determined to be
[27:48] an example for his day in other words it
[27:49] was abraham's determination and god saw
[27:52] his determinations like wow he's
[27:53] determined to be an example of faith for
[27:55] two people today
[27:56] and i'm not wouldn't object to that at
[27:58] all but i also want you to think of it
[27:59] this way that god saw
[28:02] that abraham had been determined
[28:04] beforehand
[28:06] he himself had been selected and chosen
[28:08] to be an example for people today so
[28:11] when he says this in 1964 i want us to
[28:14] begin to tune in that he he had
[28:16] determined when he said abram get
[28:18] yourself out of ur in the land of the
[28:20] chaldees and away from your father's
[28:22] house and away from your kindred into a
[28:24] land that i'm gonna show you because
[28:25] he's saying you are being set forth to
[28:28] be an example of the bride in the end
[28:29] time who's going to be in a third exodus
[28:32] and coming out of a church to go in a
[28:34] rapture he said you are going to be
[28:35] determined you are determined to be an
[28:37] example of end time faith
[28:41] and so when we look at genesis chapter
[28:43] 22 this is when his faith is made
[28:45] perfect
[28:46] and he is determined to be god
[28:48] determined him to be an example of
[28:50] rapturing faith i realize those are my
[28:52] terminologies but determined to be an
[28:53] example for people of today end time
[28:55] bride
[28:57] what expressed the example
[29:00] of the faith for the bride in the last
[29:01] days
[29:03] what what is it then if we look at this
[29:05] if we begin to say all right we're gonna
[29:07] have a breakout session so everybody
[29:08] arrange ourselves by zip code and uh
[29:11] and we're gonna we're gonna talk about
[29:12] this and we're all gonna get together at
[29:13] the end and we're gonna talk about well
[29:14] what it what is it that expressed his
[29:16] faith and we kind of get together and go
[29:18] i don't know we have to like at least
[29:19] try to sacrifice our firstborn or you
[29:22] know what does this all mean do we need
[29:23] to build altars oh i know we need we all
[29:25] go to pilgrimage to mariah right
[29:27] and and we try to kind of figure it out
[29:29] well
[29:30] i i it's
[29:31] it's it's staring us right in
[29:35] the face
[29:36] because abraham's vision
[29:39] is connected with something beyond and
[29:41] i'm talking about in his this is where
[29:43] i'm transitioning now
[29:44] and maybe it's going to be very quickly
[29:46] to the uh very precise to the to the end
[29:48] of the service tonight
[29:50] notice i disavowed quickly very quickly
[29:53] but abraham i want you to catch this in
[29:55] the life of abraham and how god dealt
[29:57] with him his vision was connected with
[29:59] something beyond his natural life
[30:01] and so when we look at genesis chapter
[30:03] 22 and we we see these literal events
[30:06] unfolding child sacrifice god tempting
[30:08] him sacrifices firstborn and we start
[30:10] just looking at the wood and the
[30:11] mountain and the fire and the ram and
[30:13] the thicket and all these different
[30:14] things happening and we start looking at
[30:16] the different details and maybe
[30:17] something gets lost in the details all
[30:18] of a sudden if we don't take a step back
[30:20] and think about abraham's entire life
[30:22] and realize that abraham's vision was
[30:24] always connected to something beyond his
[30:26] natural life or beyond his days
[30:29] remember it's it's abram the hebrew
[30:32] sister sandra told me brother aaron i've
[30:34] got a new name i'm like oh great i've
[30:35] heard this before
[30:37] she said you can call me sister sandy
[30:38] the hebrew and i was like i like it
[30:40] that's how we all ought to identify we
[30:42] begin to understand what it means to be
[30:43] a hebrew abram the hebrew what it he had
[30:46] crossed over
[30:49] one from beyond and abraham could truly
[30:52] be described now in the dimension of
[30:54] time the dispensation of time and the
[30:56] realm of time in genesis chapter 12 that
[30:58] what he stepped out and began to do no
[31:00] one else is doing
[31:03] nobody else is doing it god isn't
[31:04] speaking to anybody else god spoke to
[31:06] one man abram get out of earth the land
[31:08] of counties i want you to go to canaan
[31:10] and he has this
[31:11] this pathway that he takes to canaan and
[31:13] abraham now is someone from beyond
[31:16] he's someone who's crossed over into
[31:18] another realm he's living by faith he's
[31:20] walking in another room he's living in
[31:22] the faith dimension
[31:24] and we have to recognize this about
[31:25] abraham living in the faith dimension
[31:27] he's not operating under the same
[31:29] metrics and the same callings and the
[31:30] same parameters and the same goals and
[31:32] the same attitudes and the same visions
[31:34] that everyone else is living under
[31:36] he has a calling and this calling that
[31:38] comes upon him he is now worshiping an
[31:40] invisible god so now beginning to
[31:42] worship to an invisible god and the
[31:44] invisible god having made himself known
[31:46] to him abraham is drawn into a different
[31:48] dimension and he's living in a realm
[31:50] differently than everybody else
[31:53] complete different reality for him and
[31:55] so this this is where abraham now
[31:58] his life is not it's not just connected
[32:01] with physical mountains
[32:04] and physical sacrifices and physical
[32:06] children there was something deeper
[32:08] about what was inspiring him because
[32:11] he's the hebrew
[32:13] though his body was still here
[32:16] faith by faith his sight had been
[32:18] translated and crossed over
[32:21] and now he's looking at things totally
[32:22] differently
[32:24] and he looked he's as we've been reading
[32:26] through the first couple services he
[32:27] searched for a city not made by man
[32:30] he searched with a city that had an
[32:31] eternal foundation had foundations that
[32:33] means permanence eternal and who made by
[32:35] god
[32:37] so there was something now if the bibles
[32:39] tell us that he searched for a city not
[32:41] made with hands that had foundation a
[32:43] city made by god
[32:45] that there is this means he's not so
[32:47] much looking for a natural place to put
[32:50] up his tent
[32:52] but there's something supernatural that
[32:54] he's craving for and looking for
[32:56] so abraham's vision now is connected
[32:58] beyond his natural life
[33:00] now let's be let's just look at a few
[33:02] scriptures that speak of the promise
[33:03] that's given to him genesis chapter 17
[33:05] i'll read in chapter 13 and chapter 21
[33:08] genesis chapter 17 verses 3 to 8
[33:12] and abram fell on his face and god
[33:14] talked with him saying
[33:16] this is god speaking as for me behold
[33:18] my covenant is with thee
[33:21] and thou shalt be a father of many
[33:23] nations
[33:26] neither shall thy name be any more
[33:28] called thy name anymore be called abram
[33:30] but thy name shall be abraham which is
[33:32] father many nations it says for a father
[33:35] of many nations have i made thee
[33:38] and i said have i made thee
[33:41] he's talking in past tense
[33:44] and if someone was walking by and
[33:45] hearing this conversation between god
[33:47] and neighbor abram and new abram they'd
[33:48] be like
[33:50] right
[33:52] you know the guy had to use a servant
[33:54] just to get one son
[33:56] and now he's gonna say he's gonna be a
[33:57] father of many nations then now notice
[34:00] the pr the covenant being proceeded now
[34:02] from because my covenant is with him in
[34:03] this unconditional covenant and i will
[34:05] make the exceeding fruitful and i will
[34:08] make nations of thee and kings shall
[34:09] come out of thee
[34:11] quite a prophecy and i will establish my
[34:14] covenant between me
[34:17] and thee
[34:18] and thy seed after thee
[34:21] in their generations and knows the
[34:22] language for an everlasting covenant
[34:26] to be a god unto thee and to thy seed
[34:29] after thee
[34:30] it's important to the kind of pawn to
[34:32] this now like we're not thinking in
[34:33] terms of everlasting in its use being an
[34:35] indeterminate amount of time that oh
[34:38] well he was just saying it would be
[34:40] it's only me in the years that we
[34:41] couldn't quite determine in this context
[34:43] he's talking about eternal
[34:45] he said i'm going to be a god unto thee
[34:47] not just for a period of time and thy
[34:48] seed after thee and i'll give unto thee
[34:50] and to thy seed seed after the land
[34:53] wherein thou art a stranger all the land
[34:55] of canaan for an everlasting possession
[34:58] and i will be their
[35:00] god. now these are the things that god
[35:03] is speaking to abraham
[35:05] and the faith that abraham has the
[35:07] revelation that abraham is getting is
[35:09] not hey i'm going to build you a house
[35:11] and you're going to have it until you
[35:13] die
[35:15] and then when you die it's going to
[35:16] revert back to the original owner
[35:18] because there's a way that you can have
[35:19] a particular deed to a property where
[35:21] i'm going to deed this property it to
[35:23] you and you can live in it until you die
[35:25] when you die it's going to revert back
[35:26] to my family or revert to the prior
[35:27] owner he said hey i'm giving it to you
[35:29] free and clear it's all yours
[35:31] and you're going to have it and he said
[35:32] i'm going to be your god forever
[35:35] everlasting in an everlasting possession
[35:37] everlasting covenant and everlasting
[35:39] possession it's ever during or eternal
[35:42] is the meaning intended there
[35:44] it says in genesis chapter 13 verse 15.
[35:46] for all the land which thou seest to
[35:48] thee will i give it and to thy seed
[35:51] forever
[35:53] again to you and your seed
[35:56] will eternally have this land your seed
[35:59] will stand forever by the power of god
[36:02] and notice how he says that i'm going to
[36:04] be a god to you
[36:06] under this everlasting covenant
[36:08] and it's not going to use a language
[36:10] that i can i'm only going to be a goddam
[36:12] for an indeterminate amount of time
[36:14] that said i'm going to be a god to you
[36:15] for a really really long time but i just
[36:17] can't quite tell you how long that's
[36:18] going to be he said i'm going to be a
[36:19] god to you forever
[36:22] eternally
[36:24] so there's if this word is not being
[36:25] used in the context we're going to talk
[36:27] about something that may endure for a
[36:29] very very very long time in a space of
[36:31] time that may be very very lengthy and
[36:33] it's wanting to convey this great
[36:35] breadth that may not be numbered but yet
[36:36] there's an ultimate end this is it's not
[36:38] true of this prophecy god is
[36:40] specifically saying everlasting
[36:42] possession everlasting covenant i'm
[36:44] going to be your god forever
[36:45] as he spoke to in genesis 21 33 and
[36:48] abraham planted a grove in beersheba and
[36:51] called there on the name of the lord the
[36:53] everlasting god
[36:56] remember there's a revelation here i'm
[36:57] just going to allude to it and lord one
[36:59] will speak on it sunday
[37:02] that he's a god of the living not the
[37:04] dead
[37:06] and so i'm going to be a god unto thee
[37:08] forever
[37:09] so abraham's catching a revelation
[37:12] he's not saying wait a minute
[37:15] so i wonder how long my father lived and
[37:18] i had a brother that died early and
[37:20] trying to figure out just how long he's
[37:21] going to enjoy this god
[37:24] or how long do how long is this going to
[37:26] be abraham's catching the revelation
[37:29] that he's an eternal god and he said
[37:31] he's going to be my god forever abraham
[37:34] started it's starting to dawn on abraham
[37:37] that the revelation that's coming to him
[37:39] transcends
[37:41] this natural life
[37:43] so abraham's actions and specifically
[37:45] now i want you to think of his entire
[37:47] life as this revelation is progressively
[37:49] unfolding to him but especially in
[37:51] genesis chapter 22 abraham's
[37:54] actions are testifying of a deep
[37:56] conviction of eternity
[37:59] his actions are testifying of a deep
[38:02] conviction of an essential attribute of
[38:04] god in the nature of god and not just
[38:06] merely the nature of god but the nature
[38:08] of god's promises specifically to him
[38:12] and so he is he is having this
[38:14] revelation unfold to him
[38:17] that this prop that god is is being
[38:19] revealed to me and it's bringing him
[38:21] he's crossed over his faith as he
[38:23] entered into another dimension and now
[38:25] in that realm death and life and food
[38:28] and land and everything begins to lose
[38:30] its hold and power upon abraham but god
[38:33] now begins to connect eternity with his
[38:36] possessions and abraham is seeing
[38:38] something to come together in something
[38:39] very beautiful so his vision transcends
[38:42] the flesh
[38:44] it's going beyond the calendar it's
[38:45] going beyond this life
[38:48] now let me just kind of
[38:49] drop a couple statements in the here for
[38:51] you to uh ponder on before
[38:54] sunday service
[38:56] the seed of abraham was christ
[38:59] he's the son of abraham
[39:01] abraham's faith i want to say this
[39:03] abraham's faith was jesus christ
[39:07] it was it was a he his faith was in
[39:10] jesus christ the word his faith was a
[39:12] revelation of this this redeemer and
[39:14] this redemption he was he was catching a
[39:17] vision beyond the depravity of the world
[39:19] and the time that he lived in the the
[39:20] chaos of genesis chapter 12 and the idol
[39:22] worship of his family and the chaos of
[39:25] the counties and even the chaos of all
[39:27] the lands he was going into and and the
[39:29] the famines and the travels and
[39:30] everything he was doing there was
[39:32] something that abraham's faith was
[39:33] connected to so i'm wanting to kind of
[39:36] connect abraham with jesus christ now
[39:38] so if we could just say that this is
[39:40] there as this undercurrent in abraham's
[39:43] faith
[39:44] abraham then was willing to offer
[39:46] sacrifice
[39:47] offer isaac as a sacrifice
[39:50] because of an understanding
[39:52] of the god that he believed in
[39:56] so if
[39:57] if i could just say it this way
[40:00] the first vision that abraham had
[40:03] he wasn't laying there just stretching
[40:05] on a really nice morning and earth
[40:08] and also this voice says kill your wife
[40:13] you know your half sister sarah the one
[40:15] you married yeah just go ahead and kill
[40:17] her take a knife he's like
[40:19] well
[40:22] voices are talking got to do what the
[40:24] voices say
[40:26] right
[40:28] that's not what abraham does
[40:30] it's not day one kill a family member
[40:33] but here's a life
[40:35] lifetime
[40:36] of where by the time he this is what you
[40:38] have to catch
[40:39] we sometimes look at abraham like oh my
[40:40] goodness god tempted abraham and we get
[40:43] this real dramatic ethical discussions
[40:45] about well what if god let him kill him
[40:47] you're like what would that mean and how
[40:48] would that topple our faith and we don't
[40:50] even look at abraham as being
[40:52] he's the father of faith guys
[40:56] he had confidence in the character
[40:59] of the one that's asking him to do this
[41:00] i'm about to get excited i'm glad
[41:02] there's there's a wide aisle today
[41:05] i'll just say it this way if there was
[41:06] pews i'd run the tops of them right now
[41:09] because this is it don't get pushed
[41:11] anytime soon i'll probably change my
[41:13] you know my desire to run the tops of
[41:15] pews
[41:17] but he's willing to offer up isaac as a
[41:19] sacrifice because he trusted and
[41:21] understood and knew the nature of the
[41:23] god who asked him to do this
[41:26] and so abraham's actions directly
[41:28] testified directly testified and were
[41:31] evidence that he believed god had power
[41:33] over death
[41:35] we can't look at this activity in this
[41:37] action in genesis chapter 22 any other
[41:40] way other than
[41:42] god
[41:43] i trust you
[41:45] i know you
[41:46] every promise every vision everything
[41:49] you've been doing in my life to this
[41:50] time testifies to a power beyond this
[41:53] life
[41:54] and so he walked in that journey i i'm
[41:56] not trying to get too dramatic
[41:59] and dramatized to the point where i
[42:00] leave the truth of the scripture but i i
[42:03] just i'm not seeing tonight that abraham
[42:06] was depressed
[42:08] being dragged for three days going oh my
[42:11] goodness
[42:13] and trying to hide from
[42:14] isaac and i was like man i wonder what's
[42:16] going on with dad he's really depressed
[42:18] i have never seen him like this and he's
[42:19] just over there going i can kill my son
[42:23] abraham's probably going man i don't
[42:24] know what's going to happen on mount
[42:25] moriah
[42:27] but this is going to be good
[42:29] like he must have just felt like that i
[42:31] know the god i'm trusting he's proven
[42:33] himself from genesis 12 to genesis 22 to
[42:36] all these things that have happened he's
[42:37] a god i'm personal with the god i'm
[42:39] intimate with the god has made promises
[42:41] and backed him up i'm in a situation now
[42:43] where it seems like this is a big ask
[42:45] this is a big ass to sacrifice my son
[42:47] but i'm not looking at a god of death
[42:50] i'm looking at a god of life i'm not
[42:52] looking at a god of the dead i'm looking
[42:53] at a god of a living and he's testifying
[42:55] that he believed in a god that had power
[42:58] over death
[43:01] he had a faith in god that could bypass
[43:03] death
[43:05] or he could raise isaac from it
[43:08] why because he's the god of the living
[43:10] not a god of the dead
[43:12] why does it say in verse 4
[43:15] then on the third day
[43:20] then on the third day
[43:22] he goes up that hill to sacrifice his
[43:24] son then on the third day god appeared
[43:27] to him as jehovah jireh why was it the
[43:30] third day why was it the first day why
[43:32] was it the second day it was on the
[43:33] third day because that's the day of the
[43:35] resurrection
[43:37] it's on that day because he's testifying
[43:39] abraham's walking in these steps and
[43:42] he's willing to offer up isaac as a
[43:44] sacrifice not because he just believed
[43:47] god so much like well if he wants me to
[43:48] kill my son then i'm just going to kill
[43:50] my son he's like well you already told
[43:52] me that everyone in the earth is going
[43:53] to be blessed by him
[43:55] you've already demonstrated to me you're
[43:56] a god of the living and not of the dead
[43:58] you've already told me everlasting
[44:00] covenant going to be your people forever
[44:02] i already know i'm going to live forever
[44:04] so then i know that isaac is included in
[44:07] that promise and death can't have me
[44:10] death can't have my son because this
[44:12] promise is eternal and abraham was
[44:15] willing not because he believed god
[44:18] and it was going to be obedient
[44:19] irrationally unto death but he did it
[44:21] understanding power and promise
[44:25] he did it believing that he was a god an
[44:27] eternal god that could resurrect
[44:31] and the message jehovah jireh brother
[44:32] man says you've got about 2 800 years of
[44:35] experience to look back through others
[44:36] and see what he's done
[44:39] and if the old testament provided that
[44:42] how much more does the new covenant a
[44:44] better thing
[44:46] that them without us would not be made
[44:48] perfect god has provided
[44:51] he says i trust that you'll believe with
[44:52] all your heart as we pray
[44:54] and he says now father we thank thee for
[44:55] being jehovah jireh the lord's provided
[44:58] sacrifice
[44:59] now i ask you today lord jesus that you
[45:02] will give grace abundantly to all the
[45:04] people that are here
[45:06] and let them know that he's preaching
[45:08] jehovah jireh he's preaching genesis 22
[45:10] you provided a resurrection in a form
[45:13] there for isaac
[45:16] this is what happened on mount moriah
[45:18] you provided a resurrection informed
[45:20] there for isaac who had come to the end
[45:22] of his road but you provided a way for
[45:24] him
[45:25] what was provided on mount moriah
[45:27] resurrection
[45:29] what was it abraham was going to the top
[45:30] of that mountain believing in a
[45:32] resurrection
[45:34] he might not have known everything
[45:35] because it was god's nature to show him
[45:36] some things but not show him everything
[45:38] but he had this vision this
[45:40] understanding that if isaac dies he must
[45:42] live again
[45:45] and here's brother brown saying you
[45:46] provided a resurrection
[45:48] this ram caught in a thicket is
[45:50] signifying representing resurrection why
[45:52] because isaac under the sentence of
[45:53] death is by bypasses death
[45:57] and and now i realize i'm going to read
[46:00] hebrews chapter 11 verses 17 18 and 19.
[46:03] and some of you probably already thought
[46:04] about it and said i don't know why
[46:05] brother aaron's getting all excited
[46:06] about this i've been reading like this
[46:07] in my bible since i could read
[46:09] but it says in hebrews chapter 11 verse
[46:11] 17 by faith abraham when he was tried
[46:13] offered up isaac so when he offered up
[46:15] isaac it was a trial it was a testament
[46:17] it was approving and he that had
[46:18] received the promise offered up his only
[46:20] begotten son of whom it was said that in
[46:23] isaac shall thy seed be called so it
[46:25] brings us back to the promise so it says
[46:27] accounting that god was able to raise
[46:30] him up even from the dead from which
[46:32] also he received him in a figure
[46:35] he said that he actually in parable or
[46:37] in time receives isaac from the dead
[46:40] because he's under the sentence of death
[46:42] take your son your only son and
[46:44] sacrifice and kill upon an altar on
[46:47] mount moriah the place that i have
[46:48] chosen the place that i'll show you but
[46:50] what does abraham do he reckons and
[46:53] accounts that god is able to do what
[46:55] raise isaac from the dead so whenever
[46:58] isaac is receives the resurrection and
[47:01] form the scripture actually says in
[47:04] parable or pre-figure isaac was
[47:06] resurrected for
[47:08] abraham and that's what he experienced
[47:12] it's actually telling us that he
[47:14] reckoned god was able to raise him up
[47:16] so the faith of abraham was very
[47:18] purposeful
[47:19] that in going up this mount moriah this
[47:22] mount moriah experience this mount
[47:24] moriah showdown in coming to this apex
[47:26] coming to this climax of his faith
[47:28] coming to this place of supreme
[47:30] expression it was not that he was up
[47:33] there guessing but he reckoned and
[47:35] believed god would raise him up
[47:39] counting that god was able to raise him
[47:41] even from
[47:43] the dead
[47:46] and my redeemer liveth
[47:49] brother adam says
[47:51] abraham said and notice this phrase it's
[47:53] kind of just a lengthy
[47:56] expression several sentences here i've
[47:58] had the same kind of vision
[48:01] rip yonder on the mountain when christ
[48:03] god met me
[48:04] and give me his redemptive names as
[48:05] jehovah jair is kind of answering to job
[48:07] and he's dramatizing this give me his
[48:10] redemptive names of jehovah jair jehovah
[48:12] raph and all those see in the death
[48:15] burial and resurrection
[48:18] what does he see
[48:19] and giving these redemptive names
[48:20] jehovah sees he's not just expressing
[48:24] that faith is being able to accept
[48:26] whatever circumstances come your way and
[48:28] that faith is able to accept that if god
[48:29] wants me to sacrifice this then i'm
[48:31] willing to let it go and we have this if
[48:33] you love it you let it go it'll come
[48:34] back to you
[48:36] and just some kind of mushy gushy
[48:39] weird
[48:40] new age way of believing god faith was
[48:43] an understanding for abraham he's very
[48:45] purposeful in god the way god revealed
[48:47] himself to him it was a progress
[48:49] progressive revelation and he says it
[48:50] was death burial and resurrection
[48:52] abraham already saw it
[48:54] he says seeing it and i offered it in my
[48:57] own son
[48:58] when i seen little isaac when i took him
[49:00] on the hill let him pack his own wood up
[49:03] this is abraham speaking the top of the
[49:05] mountain and there i laid him on the
[49:06] altar and was going to take his own life
[49:09] catch this
[49:10] i purposely haven't asked the musicians
[49:12] to come i just want you to focus on this
[49:14] very diligently now knowing that i'd
[49:16] received him as one from the dead
[49:20] even in figure of what
[49:22] sarah's womb being dead this was one
[49:24] that he couldn't have
[49:25] i believe that he would raise him up
[49:28] again
[49:30] and through this great hope that beats
[49:33] in my heart
[49:35] i know
[49:36] he said he could raise them up
[49:40] and then brother says it was a foresight
[49:42] even if it's abraham speaking this is
[49:44] what you've got to catch it was a
[49:45] foresight of the resurrection
[49:48] abraham's faith had he had a vision of
[49:51] the rapture he had a vision of the
[49:53] resurrection he did not wasn't willing
[49:55] to offer
[49:56] isaac as a sacrifice just as some sort
[49:58] of dumb blind trust or bad faith but he
[50:01] was willing to offer isaac knowing the
[50:03] promise believing the promise believing
[50:06] in the character and the nature of god
[50:08] and he had a vision he had a foresight
[50:10] he had a revelation of the resurrection
[50:12] he said the same thing job had
[50:16] job said i know my redeemer liveth
[50:19] and in the end i will stand on the earth
[50:22] said abraham had the same vision
[50:24] he's seen the same thing job had so
[50:26] abraham has a faith
[50:29] to believe
[50:30] in his position beyond the flesh
[50:33] he has a faith to believe in a power
[50:36] beyond natural things this is the faith
[50:38] of abraham as he walks up that mountain
[50:42] one last scripture i'm stopping just
[50:43] right in the middle of this thought but
[50:45] john chapter 8 verse 56
[50:47] i want to leave this with you
[50:49] jesus says your father abraham rejoiced
[50:50] to see my day
[50:53] and he saw it
[50:56] and was glad
[50:58] what did abraham see
[51:00] what was abraham's faith
[51:03] and then how is his faith akin to our
[51:05] faith
[51:08] you see the same thing
[51:10] and you're glad
[51:12] you cross over other people don't see it
[51:16] looking at looking at the same things
[51:18] well i listen to that i read that i
[51:20] studied that you're looking at it look
[51:21] at you looking at me look at you and
[51:22] you're kind of like
[51:25] it's awesome isn't it isn't this good
[51:27] good isn't it they're kind of like well
[51:28] i mean
[51:31] why because you see something
[51:33] by election
[51:35] jesus said abraham rejoiced to see my
[51:38] day it might have seemed like he looked
[51:40] forward to seeing my day and jesus says
[51:43] and he saw it
[51:46] and hear abraham
[51:48] on mount moriah his life is patterning
[51:51] even god
[51:53] offering up his son
[51:57] but then it's at that last moment
[52:01] god creates in a second something that
[52:03] wasn't there he creates it and it's
[52:04] there
[52:05] and what ought to have been isaac's
[52:07] death
[52:09] it's bypassed in a resurrection
[52:11] that it's appointed unto men wants to
[52:13] die
[52:15] but all of a sudden in a moment god
[52:16] cancels the appointment
[52:19] you see how abraham's faith
[52:22] is determined to be the faith of the
[52:23] people today
[52:25] let's stand to our feet tonight
[52:29] what a
[52:30] faith what a supreme faith
[52:36] abraham
[52:37] saw
[52:38] the day of jesus christ
[52:40] and was glad
[52:42] he had a foresight of the resurrection
[52:43] he provided god provided a resurrection
[52:46] in form for isaac
[52:48] abraham accounted reckon god was able to
[52:51] resurrect from the dead
[52:54] why because he was an everlasting god
[52:56] and he couldn't be an everlasting god
[52:57] unless there was
[52:59] an everlasting people
[53:02] and so faith is so far beyond what's
[53:04] happening naturally
[53:07] and it's in that faith of abraham when
[53:09] he when he offered up isaac as a
[53:11] sacrifice james says his faith reached
[53:14] its full and supreme expression and
[53:16] brother van says abraham's faith was an
[53:18] example of faith
[53:19] this is this is the pinnacle this is the
[53:21] peak
[53:23] but so then i'm saying we have to have
[53:25] rapturing faith
[53:26] and we see it in abraham
[53:29] so then we can look we can go back start
[53:31] over in genesis 12 and see the steps
[53:33] that abraham went through
[53:35] to where he could have that kind of
[53:36] faith
[53:38] to believe have a vision beyond this
[53:39] flesh
[53:41] let's bow our heads in prayer
[53:43] gracious heavenly father
[53:45] it is a pleasure to be able to minister
[53:47] this word
[53:49] especially lord of pleasure to minister
[53:51] to people who believe these things and
[53:52] are hungry for these things
[53:56] lord we're living in an hour in a time
[53:58] where many people are in bondage
[54:02] they're bound by personalities they're
[54:04] bound by false doctrines they're bound
[54:07] by
[54:09] fears
[54:12] bound by blind loyalty
[54:16] led by bad faith
[54:20] and there's only one that can set him
[54:21] free
[54:23] that's you
[54:26] i believe in the same way that abram was
[54:28] set free
[54:29] in genesis 11 and genesis 12 it begins
[54:32] by you calling their name
[54:35] and what i pray tonight lord what you
[54:36] would do is just whisper their name
[54:40] in whatever manner that you disclose
[54:42] yourself to your people or whatever
[54:44] personal way you have of speaking to
[54:46] someone and beckoning them beyond
[54:47] themselves
[54:49] and even helping them to realize that
[54:51] this is not
[54:53] what's taking place even
[54:54] in in this last days it's not just even
[54:57] what's being preached at this church is
[54:59] just not a another reiteration of the
[55:01] good news and the gospel that's been
[55:02] denominated and not just another branch
[55:04] off of another of different bible church
[55:08] but lord it's something that we believe
[55:10] is direct from heaven
[55:12] very pertinent for the age that we live
[55:14] in it's different than religion lord
[55:15] it's different than denominationalism
[55:17] it's different than just the fanaticism
[55:19] and charisma that exist in the world
[55:21] today but this is something deeply
[55:23] personal
[55:25] and just as you revealed yourself to
[55:26] abraham you're wanting to reveal
[55:28] yourself to the seed of abraham in this
[55:30] hour not just become part of a
[55:31] collective not become part of a movement
[55:33] not become part of a broad group but
[55:36] lord individually find ourselves
[55:38] communing with you walking in the
[55:39] routines of the scripture in the plans
[55:41] of god for our life
[55:44] and lord i believe that there's
[55:46] individuals that will attain to this
[55:47] rapturing faith
[55:50] people that possess the seat of it right
[55:51] now
[55:54] and they too will have a mount zion show
[55:56] down in a very personal and intimate way
[56:00] on a mountaintop with their isaac with
[56:01] their christ
[56:08] in a way that's personal and intimate
[56:11] and then as we all come to this climax
[56:13] we come to this highest part of the
[56:15] mountain we all are
[56:17] walking these steps of faith together
[56:20] may we encourage one another
[56:22] pray for one another be there for one
[56:24] another
[56:26] lord i
[56:31] as i am moved by
[56:33] this example in genesis chapter 22
[56:36] and how abraham acted with the rapturing
[56:39] faith he acted with a perfect faith
[56:43] hey we just take a step back and ask
[56:46] ourselves lord
[56:47] how did he get there
[56:51] and then understand that you'll take us
[56:53] the same way
[56:55] you'll give us the same experiences
[56:59] so that we too
[57:02] can experience
[57:05] what abraham looked for
[57:08] what abraham believed in
[57:10] i pray for the people tonight lord as we
[57:12] have
[57:13] needs in our midst we pray for them
[57:16] we believe that your word is sufficient
[57:19] we believe in the power of divine
[57:21] healing we believe in the power of
[57:22] casting out devils we believe in the
[57:23] power of deliverance
[57:26] from sin
[57:28] father we believe your word now is
[57:29] enough
[57:30] we pray for anyone bound by sickness
[57:32] bound by sin bound by disease bound by
[57:35] foul spirits lord whatever it might be
[57:37] we pray that you would bring a
[57:38] deliverance acts of repentance lord
[57:42] save souls being baptized in the name of
[57:44] jesus christ
[57:46] lord we pray for those that we know are
[57:48] sick father i failed to mention at the
[57:50] beginning but brother tim cho the pastor
[57:52] of a church in northern missouri passed
[57:54] away this week because of cove lord
[57:56] another pastor that's just three pastors
[57:58] in missouri in this past year alone lord

[58:07] comfort the family
[58:08] sister joanne lord
[58:12] i pray that you would have grace upon us
[58:14] as we as a church and his families
[58:16] navigate
[58:19] the
[58:20] continued challenges lord of a pandemic
[58:22] may we never shriek back in fear act and
[58:24] fear act suspiciously lord but be
[58:27] deliberate in our actions father be
[58:29] confident in our behavior and our
[58:30] demeanor
[58:32] and i pray lord that you help us
[58:34] to do all things well as you do

[58:37] name of the lord jesus christ
