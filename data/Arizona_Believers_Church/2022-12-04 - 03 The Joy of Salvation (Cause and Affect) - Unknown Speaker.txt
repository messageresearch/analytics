TRANSCRIPT
========================================
the this is uh part three in the on the subject of the joy of Salvation we're looking at subject of Joy subject of Salvation I'm wanting myself personally um have been looking at and studying and just waiting for the Lord to find the right place to drop it in there but some of the things that are relevant to us at the end time the bride's salvation the Salvation that's even promised at to the elect in the end and it has um a lot of emphasis on Christ coming and even these themes of Christmas so uh this season this time of year we want to put our focus on the things of Christ and really focus intently on even what his coming means to us so there's some of that connection there but today I'm going to take the title of cause and effect and not effect but cause and effect and we'll hopefully amplify a little bit of a word play there for you and I hope that it'll kind of have a some emphasis even in the same way that we dealt with first principle last Sunday and we first begin to establish in that first first principles and so that's where I'll start is just by reviewing a few things on first principles I've appreciated the feedback and fellowship on this subject it is very really a neat tool to use to begin to look at things and stimulate some thought a lot of truth that's contained in it and when we looked at first principles it's the primary cause of something or the basic elements of something and when we talk about first principles we were using it in a sense of really understanding the fundamentals of something or what makes something what it is when you think first principles this is what distinguishes it when you distill it all down and you get to the root of it this is what it is and you begin to build from there and Paul uses this in Hebrews chapter 5 verse 12. it says for when the time you ought to be teachers you have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the Oracles of God and there become such as have need of milk and not strong meat so that Paul is expressing disappointment uh these this is an observation that he has made about the people when they ought to themselves be teaching things because they understand the fundamentals they have a concept of the building blocks they know what these pieces are they know how they work they know how to use them and so when they ought to be the ones that are instructing they need to be taught again even the fundamentals and the foundational things and they need milk and they can't handle strong meat so it's speaking to maturity they're unskillful they haven't really grasped the things that they needed to grasp in order to go further and so this phrase first principles of the Oracles of God we could amplify Oracles of God but we can just even say that that's a summation of the word of God and even the fundamental elements of their their law that they held so closely to but the first principles of the beginning elements it's the first thing from which a series of things arises so you go back to the the primary cause of the the initiator the beginner so it's the first thing from which a series of things arise or it's the basic elements from which a hole is composed so you say oh well that's a that's a boat well what is it made out of is it a wooden boat what's at its core what are its basic elements and we could use even the example of the letters of the alphabet are the building blocks that form language and and that that produce speech and so that's what first principles are and Paul in Hebrews chapter 5 is saying because uh you don't know the first principles as you ought to you're being held back from being skillful with the word of God you're being held back in terms of better understanding the nature of God his will and his design and so it it is I believe he's directly saying that if they had the first principles down if they had them established if they really understood the first principles then they could understand the deeper things that when he begins to deal more with Christ after the order of Melchizedek he could say things and since they understood the first principles they'd be able to place it right like oh I I see more clearly now but without that Foundation you can get all weird with your types and your shadows and all excited about language and numbers and and things from the law and things from this he's saying this just isn't a show this isn't just to tickle your ears you really need to have the fundamentals down you have to have the basics down so that you can really understand these deeper things and grow and build into this stature and into this beautiful picture so he's saying if you could understand the first principles you could understand the deeper things of God and when we take this uh title The Joy of Salvation we could even present it this way do we understand the first principles of salvation now I said do you understand it I'm not implying you don't have it in terms of Salvation I'm not saying that uh you know we need to all check ourselves because we're all just a bunch of unregenerate uh not born again uh Pretenders here no it's not it at all but do you understand what you have do you understand what you possess is there do you even do you understand the first principles of joy is there a deeper understanding of when the Bible if if some of you have done this and I know sometimes some of you I kind of take the cue that if there's a particular subject we're ministering on you dive into it yourselves and my goodness you can't you can't hardly uh turn a page in the Bible without coming across joy and they're so so often mentioned in the bible so do we understand Joy do we understand these building blocks these first principles of Salvation and joy such that they're they're they they form the letters of a new language where we're speaking a new language to wear themselves they become the building blocks of of a whole of something that's being built up in us do we know how to use them and so that's that's uh kind of the the preface to to see what the things we're trying to be challenged with and I would say as we said before that we're looking at this together that together we're looking at a subject and we're wanting the word to speak to our hearts this is in no way me trying to take something to say see this see here uh in order to expose something but we're looking at something together in order to understand more now I've broken this up for myself just to be able to put some building blocks out there to the sermon and so I want to First Look at Joy we're going to examine Joy a little bit deeper today look look at Joy's just merely a human emotion so we have this understanding of what Joy is a happiness or pleasure and how that they can have a joy that's just merely human emotion and by that I mean it's it's merely instigated by human things human experiences human perception and and our senses and so joy as a noun is defined as a human emotion or feeling of great pleasure and happiness so when you have joy it's great pleasure happiness that's what Joy signifies I have joy great pleasure and happiness if you Joy as a verb it means to rejoice and so that's what when you think of rejoice and rejoicing in all the places that the Bible speaks of rejoicing it's connected with joy it's the expression of this great pleasure and this happiness and so Joy is a human emotion that's evoked by our feeling well by success or good fortune or even the anticipation of something good the prospect of something good or oh I'm excited about this or I have a lot of Joy because Christmas is coming coming whatever it might be these are all human emotions and we looked at this uh in great detail as a church in the past and um in my I I'm finding myself maybe drawn back to some subject to a minister and we subministered last year on a theme of pure joy there's a lot of things in there you could go back and revisit um I even feel that there should not be any fear on my part just to go back and completely re-preach some things that we've ministered the last couple years because we're almost an entirely different body as we've grown and it's not like we just preached from the Bible once and then put that up right so there's just so much to explore as long as it's the word and not my opinions it'll stay fresh my opinions will get stale real quick and what you what you want is the word it's always fresh and so is human emotions are these conscious experiences that we have characterized either by some you know there's got to be some mental activity there and it can be pleasure or displeasure so there's this range of emotions and there's this mental activity that uh you you you this conscious experience of Happiness a conscious experience of sadness those are all emotions and emotions are always present with us brother randomly lewds too I mean if it doesn't have emotions it's dead you know so there's there's got to be this emotional component to our existence we are creatures of emotion the creatures of passion we're creatures of sentiment and affections it it just it's just who we are and sometimes one of the biggest dangers we could make is saying so many nasty things about emotions uh um that we almost begin to think oh you know I don't want to feel it you know I don't want to be I don't want to have this I don't want to have that and we could really degrade emotions to the point to where we're stigmatized by them or we're we have a complex about them but really what we want is we want to have emotions but we want emotional Harmony where they're in line with the word of God subject to the things of God and at the end of the day ins you know in controlled by the spirit of God did you find a lot of the fruits of the spirit as we'll touch on these are manifested in the emotional Realm and so when it comes to Joy we can have these joyful experiences this feeling of great pleasure or happiness that uh or we could have experiences that give us that great pleasure and happiness and they can be temporal moments of Happiness moments of joy and so there's these an experience with some emotional Dynamic and it's Joy rejoice in happiness and when we say that it's in this joy as a human emotion it can be just connected with anything but in the Bible in second Thessalonians chapter 2 verse 12 it speaks of those who have pleasures and pleasure and unrighteousness that means they enjoyed and had fun and derived great satisfaction from unrighteousness and so you could take from this that there was Joy just by definition just by making a word connection that this was joy in unrighteousness and that would be a human emotion but from the wrong thing the wrong kind of Joy because it is inspired by caused by the wrong thing Paul visits it again in the last days he said that there'll be lovers of Pleasures in second Timothy 3 4. it's that hedonistic way of living love lovers of Pleasures even the word there is Hedonism basically and it's that joy that comes from satisfying human desires by fulfilling the lust of the Flesh and where if someone is hedonistic they live their life uh wanting pursuing Joy toy itself in other words they're finding things that make them happy find them things that satisfy the flesh that um they have pleasure and pleasure so and I think as you can begin to think deeply about this that there that's that slippery slope so I want joy I want joy joy joy and then you make Joy the object so then there's this realm where Joy is the object and you're doing things just to experience Joy so Joy's the pursuit not even the product necessarily it is the pro it's what you are pursuing ultimately and that's the hedonistic way of living where they love the pleasures of the Flesh and that's what they wanted to be sensitized by and as we're looking at Joy is merely human emotion that is connected to or inspired by uh just natural things in Proverbs chapter 24 verse uh let me go I have verse 17 and 18. what what how does that work um I might have to just look so we know we're in the right place I there was another verse there I think it might just be uh verse 17 Proverbs 24 17 and those of you who flip through your Bibles and are already there yep verse 17. I had verse 18. well I guess I do have 18 on there too 17 and 18. and so it says Rejoice not when thine enemy falleth and let not thine heart be glad when he stumbleth we could just dismiss Church on this right here well you said that maybe a little bit too anxiously uh we could we could get so much just from thinking about this verse right now to where there's a principle that we could take and if we live by there's gonna be a lot of progress Rejoice not when thine enemy falleth that we may we need to allow that to have the most Broad and deep uh application in our hearts that we do not rejoice when our enemy fails and we do not let our hearts be glad when he stumbles what a temptation isn't it like us to be happy when our our Nemesis Falls and makes a mistake or somebody who said something bad about you get something bad said bad about them what is our first response oh right we like it we like it when somebody gets what's coming to them and it's saying that we ought not to be happy or rejoice and be gleeful when our enemy fails or when they stumble or be glad when they stumble and this next verse might just hits you right between the eyes lest the Lord see it and it displeased him and he turn away his wrath from him all right so if there's any if there's any part of you that says they're getting what's coming to them keep your mouth shut don't Rejoice don't do the praise hands right did you know that the um the Emoji or whatever it is we use for uh prayer is just a high five did you know that everybody's giving each other a high five you know my mom died high five right but I it's that's what it looks like but we want to resist the temptation to high five right and chest bump and and be like yeah yeah because you could in doing that rejoice in enjoying over the wrong thing caught over something that you think they ought to get because got to say wait a minute I'm not happy that you're deriving your pleasure from their judgment I'm not happy that that excites you their demise excites you so there's a there's a joy that is the resp that is a human response to Natural things things maybe even God's cousin if it's the judgments of God on an enemy but the Bible's cautioning us against those Joys pleasure and unrighteousness lovers of pleasures and that Hedonism and so in looking at these few verses and this thought as Joy is merely human emotion that's connected with natural things think in terms of what the joy is coming from in other words what what where's the what's causing the rejoicing or as my uh initial working title was just reasons like there's a reason for something I have a reason Give Me A Reason Tis the reason there's got to be there's some reason for it why does this exist there's got to be something that causes it and so there is a joy that is a human emotion that is connected to it just natural things we understand that now there is a joy and this is uh this is easily identifiable but there's a joy which is a human emotion but it has a connection to the supernatural in other words we have a joy it is a human emotion but if we traced uh what it's related to there's some correlation or causation we realize that it has something to do with Supernatural things in Galatians Chapter 5 Verse 22 Paul writes but the fruit of the spirit is Joy says it's love it's peace it's long-suffering gentleness goodness and Faith but the fruit of the spirit is also Joy so if it's the fruit if there's a fruit of so it's something the spirit produces or something that the that promotes it or causes it the you have the spirit and if it's effective if it does something joy as a result of it so there is a joy in that and this love joy peace long-suffering gentleness goodness these are all things that we would experience in the the realm of our human being our human emotions and so there's a joy that has a connection to the spirit the capital S spirit in Acts Chapter 13 Verse 52 and this is where if you just were doing a word search and printing out your notes for joy and using scripture Joy you just you'd keep the printer would keep printing because there's so many scriptures related to joy and peace and gladness and pleasure and rejoice and it says in Acts 13 and the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Ghost and so this filled with the Holy Ghost and then there's this joy and excitement that's coming with it and so this is that Joy which is a human emotion but it has some connection or basis in the Supernatural and then in Psalms 51 12 it says that they this is a well this is a scripture that we used uh in the outset and so maybe instead of uh just continue along those lines maybe I'll just reset a little bit so there's a human emotion there's of Joy which is purely carnal then there's a human emotion of joy that has some connection to the Supernatural and David alludes to it in Psalm 61 12. he's alluding to This Joy of Salvation he says restore unto me the joy of thy salvation and uphold me with thy free spirit so there's a joy that comes from salvation there's a joy that comes from it but now I want and this might be a nuance and you say well that that seems very uh very fine very distinct but it makes a huge difference there's a joy that comes with salvation and brother Bantam touches on this and he starts to divide this difference where he's taking what Joy is and he separates it out and he says you got to look at it this way because there's these other things of looking at certain principles and you have to recognize their differences so in the sermon why he says we Rejoice that's the joy of God that's the joy of our Salvation it says David David never lost his salvation he said restore to me the joy of my salvation he had his salvation but he lost his Joy well we got plenty of joy we know that we have joy joy unspeakable and full of Glory got it now it's not that's not a slight he's just making a difference and sometimes that that uh when a difference is made that can bother us it says oh well if there's a difference and this happens well he's just making a difference doesn't mean one is uh that he's saying this is bad and this one's good he's just wanting us to understand the difference he says but now the thing the power of God is something greater than Joy power comes by settled faith we can have a lot of Joy but maybe wouldn't have no power there to heal at all right so there's joy there's enthusiasm there's excitement these human emotions says you can have that you got it he's not saying that's bad but he's saying that power is something deeper the power of God is something on the level to where it can heal it says but when we have the power of God then we've got the faith of God that moves up takes hold of God knows how to touch him and he's definitely looking at something very specific here to where you can have the experiences of Joy but not experiences power or there's a joy that God brings and the joy even Joy of salvation but yet there's something lacking in terms of a faith that's getting a hold of God and knows how to touch God so it and I think this distinction's important and I want to be very careful how I phrase it but there's there's something about God touching you and making you happy and then you being able to touch God and getting something from them and so he is being very specific and he's actually making a very precise application and the number of statements I'm going to read to you he's looking at something very precisely so sometimes you have to resist the urge to just uh take this statement and just try to apply it in a blanket way but he's being very precise and so this distinction is important because he's identifying joy as this emotional product it's wonderful it's desirable we want it we have it it's great it's not he's not putting a Scarlet Letter on Joy at all but he's saying there's a difference between the joy that comes from the Lord and the power that comes from the Lord or the power of God and as he uses this in a number of places as I've studied this and looked at in the message of the hour when he's making this distinction he's looking at a joy from the Lord that is temporal and that temporarily in its experience so it's temporal even in the things that Inspire it or temporal in the way that we experience it or the way that it's manifested the joy of the Lord moves or shouting there's praise there's rejoicing and he's saying but there's no power there because uh the joy is temporal it's fleeting it goes away when the human emotion subsides there's nothing lasting where is he saying that the power of God can make changes that are permanent and so there's a way that the spirit of God can move to enthuse people manifest itself in a way where people are emotionally enthused and enthusiastic and they can dance and they shout and they praise and they rejoice and they scream and it's a and it's and again it's the spirit of God that moves and causes people to shout to dance to praise to have excited utterances to rejoice and that's the spirit of God moving causing people to yes hallelujah praise the Lord and they're excited but I said that's one thing that's the joy of the Lord and even when it comes to that joy that accompanies salvation he's in that there's this expression there's this outpouring that comes uh from the saved he said David didn't lose his salvation he had kind of lost his praise and so there's a way that the spirit of God then can move in power to heal it can manifest itself in a way that brings Deliverance so there's a there's a a spirit of God moves and there's rejoicing spirit of God moves and there's healings and brother I'm saying there's a difference between that and the sermon God called men he says many people don't understand what anointing means he says they think it means to shout he said that's Joy power comes solemn and that's a it's a great uh it's a great a principle to really uh dive into and Ponder in the sense that there are things that can uh we think sometimes oh man he would they were so there's such an anointing and there was such an anointing there and we we apply the anointing to how excited somebody was and how much they sweat or how loud they were and those anointed prayers are the ones that when they lay hands on the person they almost fall down how hard they touch them and we're thinking that's annoying brother said no power is very somber very solemn uh when the power of God begins to move in meetings uh in brother Brands meetings many times there was a hush there's a Stillness um I had a very close a family very sister Della Shepherd brother Phillip uh she expressed how she uh has some family relation which if as you get to know brother Philip and sister Carol uh everybody in the message has no more than six degrees of separation from those two in terms of relation they know they're related to everybody in the message and uh and that's great that's wonderful and one of the degrees of separation from him is Sister Della Shepherd and she was called out in a meeting in Los Angeles where brother Bama said I see you sister begins to describe and she said that when she felt that presence she said it was so tremendous if I and if I remember remembering it correctly that part of you wanted just to burst and to run but it was so powerful you were just paralyzed that it was just it was something that just it just it brought you into under subjection and she was paralyzed and he's saying there's a joy that's shouting he says but that's not the anointing he's in power the anointed of power of song he said that's the joy of the Lord this is the power of the Lord healing making well and so again he is being very specific about the Dynamics in his meetings of what joy and shouting and rejoicing might be because a lot of people they might say that was largely absent from these meetings uh but yet there was the power of God present to heal and the power of God was present to make deliverances so he said there's a joy that happens there's an excitement that people can have but when the power of God is moving he's saying it can be very solemn but the power of the Lord brings healing and it makes well and so there's something I want us to learn from this uh together and as I use the word nuance there's a Nuance here that I think we need to catch and though it might be slight it makes a huge impact and the sermon believeth thou this and uh I hope you could just pay very close attention because I'm the subject matter um to me is uh very serious and I want us to be concentrating that we don't um that we you could just be following me very closely and the sermon believes without this brother Ram is talking about the land beyond the river there's a place there's an eternity there's a place to go there's a realm that we can live in uh one day we will go to live in forever and never leave and he says and one out of every ten thousand Christians knows no more about but just by faith to believe about it an interesting statement that one out of every 10 000 Christians know no more about it but just by faith to believe about it so there's a he's talking about there's a land beyond the river and some of us don't know anything more than just to believe in it but there's a place that a human being while yet here can be lifted up into that spot so there's a land beyond the river a lot of us just believe in it but then there's some people he says that get lifted up into that realm this place and he's relating to his own experiences of of highs and lows from inspiration and how hard it is to get inspired and come back down and he's actually given a testimony this is a 1951 he's given a testament about how healthy he is right now he says I've never weighed more than 130 pounds he says right now I weigh 155 so I figured if I put on 25 pounds I got quotes to support it and um and brother Bram said hey I'm healthy this is great because this this up and down this inspiration highs and lows takes a toll and again I'm wanting us to catch something from this like if and this way I look at it that there's something that could be inspired from it that we're we're not changing the meaning of anything and brother bear may not specifically be trying to say this but if this is what he's saying and you use first principles you can say oh well look at this this is what falls out this is what made this description these are all components of what he's describing he says now it is not a rejoicing time like you just lift it up into Joy I've seen much joy not enough real Solid Faith to cure a toothache so he's seen the enthusiasm he's seen the excitement so when he talks about being lifted up into this realm of inspiration he's saying it's it's not just to rejoice and be lifted up in Joyce and I've seen much joy not enough real Solid Faith to cure toothache he said that's the joy of the Lord not the power of the Lord he says I want more joy of the Lord so that's what I desire and that's what you have need of so again he makes this distinction of the joy of the Lord and the power of God and this may again this might seem to be a real subtle to you but this is what stood out to me because then he immediately goes to the story of Stephen Foster just a few statements about him he's the father of American music he's as the way he's regarded just with some of the the ballots he wrote little songs that may be very familiar to you but he refers to Stephen Foster's cycle of inspiration where he'd write these songs and then uh this dependence upon alcohol and alcoholism and I know that his foundation disputes uh the fact that he was an alcoholic and disputes some of the the ways that people believe that he died but it's believed that he died by Suicide there's different accounts for it but it's true that he had these moments of great inspiration and then these moments of real down times and brother bam refers to Stephen fostering talks about how look at this guy because he's saying there's a land beyond the river there's inspiration there's Ebbs and flows and he says look what can happen someone could be real inspired and then have these deep depths and then he uses William calper as an example his poet him writer that has a remarkable testimony and brother Branham talks about his cycle of inspiration and the depression and how ultimately he took his own life and it's showing this conscience of how man some people can get inspired and and write and express things and poetry and songs and get lifted up and then when that's gone they crash and they find themselves depressed and brother bam says now as long as the inspiration was on them they were all right but when the inspiration leaves that's what hurts will you say Amen to that all right so he's talking about this production cycle that exists Within These these inspired writers and these gifted people to where there is this uh temporary effect of inspiration and then once the inspiration is gone there's this crash right I've just described all of you who use caffeine right caffeine gives you this and they say that there's a huge drop off right because when it's gone it just leaves you and it says deal with this buddy and here's a headache to boot right there's a crash that comes and so that's kind of what this inspiration does is that if you just have this you have this level here and all sudden oh wow I'm inspired but when the inspiration is gone you don't come back to this Baseline you just crash right through it and and it brings you lower and the brother I was looking at that he says as long as the inspiration was on them they were fine but when it left there was hurt so now I don't think this is a huge pivot but joy can be inspired and joy is inspired and there's this human emotion and we're enthused oh I'm happy I'm excited this is great this is wonderful but what happens when it leaves what happens when that human emotion whether it be the human emotion because you're happy because your enemies are getting it or it's the human emotion that you get when the spirit of God moves what happens when that leaves or the inspiration is gone are do you come back to a positive base level or is there a crash what happens when it's gone brother Brown I'm in that story he's telling he says I I desire your prayers for me that I will maintain the strength he wanted to maintain this level he wanted to he didn't want the highs and lows the real extremes and I think that that should be desirable sometimes oh I just want Mountain Top Mountain Top Mountain Top and sometimes what comes with the Mountaintop so the really really low valleys and and I'm using I want to be careful my description but I believe that what we should have as Christians is a real steady trajectory no I I don't want to be the guy who's always sprinting to the top right and then falling down to the bottom and and finally real high and then real low we went on a family hike one time and uh one of our children just ah like come on let's do this and it was in sand and it was really hard it was in in Utah and I was like this is going to be a really it's one of these slot canyons like this is going to take us forever but one of the children just felt good that day it was a real cold brisk day and they started running circles around us right like come on guys you guys don't know what you're doing come on get those knees up we can do this and it's like kind of making a making us feel bad because this was really hard and five minutes later they were sitting down the ground I can't go anymore just come back and get me later right and and steady gets the job done right just be real plotting just be real disciplined be real perseverant and so there's there's this maintaining strength where there's progress It's not hot high and crashing and holy then perverted and then you know excited and then depressed that's what he that's what this is a principle that he begins to identify the difference between the joy of the Lord and the power of the Lord and then in the India trip report when he's given this report at a breakfast he says brethren we had the church's bubble dance long enough and so this bubble dance it's excited everything's exciting is hallelujah you're shouting praise and he's talking about this bubble dancing it's and and I wouldn't say that he's trying to say oh that wasn't the spirit of God that was just the devil no the spirit of God moves people bubble dance they get happy they Bounce Around they're bubbling they're bubbling the bubbling he says but we got to get down to Something Real them things are all right and I would say nothing against that but if it's if it's at the sake of losing something else and not having what's real then I don't want the bubble dance he said then things are all right it's the joy of the Lord many times instead of the power of the Lord so you see how brother Bradham is taking this Joy this human sentiment this human emotion he's saying we can have it it's great and it's all right but it's different from Power and in making that distinction and we look at it that way I say oh well there's a joy that can leave me there's a joy that is an enthusiasm that comes and it's temporary he says but there's a power of God and he begins to make this distinction to me that shows me that there's a joy that is available to us that we can participate in that comes and goes and comes and goes but there's a power of God that we want to have and so brother Branham is looking at and I'm going to take this to our our title today but look at the first first look at a cause and effect relationship so cause and effect there we go I've got some slides coming up that I'm going to try to navigate myself personally so I have a um a clicker up here so there's a cause and effect relationship now I think you're all very familiar with this principle but if there's a cause and effect relationship it's establishing a relationship between actions so they're with there's an action and there's a resulting action and so first action second action and a cause and effect to saying is asking did the first action cause the second and if the first action caused the second action then the second action is called the effect effect by the first action so a cause is the source of effects and if the one thing you can learn today is the difference between effect and effect that's the least be something but a cause is the source of effects and so the effect is the result or the consequence of a Cause so the effect is a consequence itself of a Cause and now this principle of cause and effect in many ways is what we try to teach our children from the moment they can begin to understand us right is if you do this this happens this is the cause this the effect this is the cause this the effect and hoping that if we can teach them these fundamentals of cause and effect then they can kind of extrapolate from that and begin to deduce from that that with action comes reaction with action comes second action and there's things that they do that can cause this and if you can have an understanding I I if you can in life identify the cause of things not just the effect but identify the cause then it deepens our understanding of things all right and that's uh maybe in some ways that's how our children are just boiling it down that's what their lives consist of at a certain point is it's they see something happen and they're going okay what caused that what what makes this happen why is this the way that it is and learning not just seeing the effect but knowing why it is that way and the cause of it is very very important and so the cause is the reason why something happened and the effect is what happened is that simple enough to look at its cause is the reason causes the what makes something happen and the effect is what happened and again having an understanding of causality cause and effect can form this a real strong basis to understand new things different things why things are different you can see an effect and you can say oh well that's the same thing but when you go back and find the cause you're us it is different and there's a lot of times when uh and again I find myself just being drawn to examples with our children where they see the same effect and they're not giving consideration to the actual cause and how different it is many times in terms of what was what was causing it and what was producing it I think a lot of times it's the debate that we have anymore and everyone being politically correct is they they take art they take the product and they they take it out of the context or the cause of it and they view it in the wrong concept the wrong realm and they use it to Great destruction so this understanding cause and effect is even a mark of maturity now I want to use a very simple examples and I think maybe these are all easy ones that we all know so that you could see this element of cause and effect and I'm realizing now maybe my examples aren't exactly uh on the nose for this but you've all maybe you've heard the phrase before you're using it incorrectly right are you you're using it wrong you're like how am I using it wrong I saw a clip one time of somebody with a drill an elect an actual drill and with a drill bit on it and they were using a hammer at the back of it and it was like you might get the done but you're using it wrong and there's a lot of things that to where you use something and and it has some utility and it has some use but you're using it wrong and there are so many examples of this that I just immediately grabbed just like the lowest hanging fruit very very simple things I was like man I could just do a whole series on this and we could just have life hacks part 1200. of all the things that were like you're using it wrong that's not you know why this is there and why this is it's like this and we're like I never knew that that's amazing right it's with everything we could just bring everyday items that we have with us right now and we could probably demonstrate to that's not how you use it right and so this idea if you're doing it wrong you're using it incorrectly is something that I want us to think in terms of cause and effect because we might be thinking Action Reaction we're thinking about just punching somebody in a bloody nose but this comes down to design it comes down to utility it comes down to understanding why things are the way they are what their purpose is and how they're to be used so there's some intent behind it because if you just look at God as just trying to produce an effect then we think well any means by any means necessary right that oh well all that matters at the end is is this veneer or this example or this certain thing as all God wants a book of Acts let's just have a book of Acts it says well no you got to go back and understand cause and effect otherwise you could produce something very similar but vastly different and so I want to use these examples of everybody recognize Reynolds Wrap right but did you ever know what those little things on the side are for hey they're hardly ever used in our house but you push them in and it's going to keep the roll of foil in the box right so when you're tearing out pieces of foil is spilling out and then the kids just roll it back up thinking oh we'll just we'll just use it later we'll just iron it uh and but you know you do that it's the same with uh Saran Wrap right there's these little things that you can pinch on there and it holds it in there and this is something that has been on these boxes of render wrap since they invented it in the ancient medieval times or whenever they invented it but yet a lot of people don't use it it's like you've been using foil for years and it's worked just fine but you know what there's actually a utility built into it to make it easier everybody anybody ever eat a banana we didn't have any good ones I didn't want to bring a rotten banana up here but I'm telling you probably most of you peel a banana wrong how many people just grab a banana take the stem and right but the easiest way to peel a banana is to take the end and just pinch it it just peels down very beautifully and it looks like this when you're done I mean that's how the animals that eat the bananas do it right but we're the animals right and we just rip the stem off and it gets all mushy and everything falls apart but there's it's like baked into it itself it's a feature not a flaw you just get this is the way that you can peel the banana and it works out great and this is the one for all the sisters we know what this is right sisters generic motor oil I didn't want to offend anybody I was like what's gonna have I put Pennzoil up there and you can have a whole whatever crowd some brothers leave the church because I can't believe brother Aaron doesn't use this there's a story one time where brother Brandon was overheard saying that's the only oil I use it's the best oil there is and this brother went and got all the oil he had and confined and he put it in his car and was using it for a while and it ruined the brother's engine completely destroyed the brother's engine the brother was just really confused I mean brother Branham went to him he said brother brand am I I overheard you say this oil was the best motor oil you used and I put it in my car and I blew my engine it ruined my engine said oh brother I was talking about for my boots and so there's a lesson there he might have went and ruined a good pair of boots too after that but this is generic motor oil now do you know how to pour oil in your car when you need well yeah you go down to Quick Lube and you pay somebody 90 bucks to do it but this bottle has this design to it and one of the biggest Pains of pouring oil in your car you used to have a car that burnt so much oil always had a case of oil in my carbs Pennzoil for those who want to know no and it would guzzle it and so you'd always have to be pour and oil in and if you don't get a big enough funnel you get oil everywhere right because what does it do gold glug glug glug and it's like these guys don't know how to design an oil can because this is how you pour it out right take it and you pour it out like this but that's the wrong way to do it it's actually designed so you pour it this way and it has something to do with science right where this is the way things work this is the way fluid works and air pressure works that when you do it this way you don't get the glug glug glug and it's made that way where's my man's from Brother Judah when I need them right this is the way that you pour oil in your car and it says it right on the bottle it's there on all just look next time it shows you on it how to hold it and so this is what I'm talking about when I say you're using it wrong in some ways it's written right in it and we keep trying to use it but we haven't taken time to get back to how does God want us to use it what is it used for could there perhaps be some very those subtle just examples and leadership in the word of God and if we could just clue in oh I know what we need we need all in the car this is and get all everywhere or you slow down say I need oil how do I need to put it in there right we don't want to just bubble dance and be enthusiastic and have a lot of fun because we think that's what the Bible says we need to have joy joy joy joy joy but there's got to be a way where we understand what it's for more life hacks to come and so on the sermon the mark of the beast and the Seal of God part one brother Ben I was talking about fundamentalists he said who understand positionally who they are and they under they've been taught right they understand maybe the instructions they've got a lot of teaching and he talked and the Pentecostals and he's saying well the fundamentalists understand their position and the Pentecostals have a lot of faith and they have a lot of enthusiasm I mean there's things and there's a lot of manifestation and he is he is in a lot of ways looking at um appearance right fundamentals understand the word of God but they may be very stayed very reserved there's not a manifest a lot of manifestation their meetings and their church services whereas with the Pentecostals a lot of enthusiasm a lot of rejoicing a lot of healing a lot of power got faith he says they got faith they got faith but what they really need is that teaching to be positionally placed so they can kind of fuse together and they could actually really get something done and make progress and brother Brown was looking at that and he's saying this of the Pentecostals he's talking about all that energy all that power he says they blow it all out the whistle with screams and shouts and runs so there's something there there's some enthusiasm there's a move there's even a power he said there's something there but they're blowing it all out with screams shouts and runs he said they could ever bottle it down you'd see a church standing her feet in power and Glory if there's a way that could channel that energy if there's a way that could channel that power if there's a way that they could harness it there's a it's kind of wildfire it's glug blood glug they're getting oil in the engine but they're not being efficient with it it's not it's leaving too much smoke afterwards or whatever it might be or whatever example you want to use they're eating the banana but they're ruining half of it and they're getting it everywhere they're ruining this roll of foil right all the edges are crimped there's just some inefficiencies there if they they could just understand the way God has designed it if they could come back to First principles and be established and positionally placed then you don't need to take away any power any faith or enthusiasm but you use these first principles and you can build into this Perfection you can get to the climax of Mount Zion so we use the example of music and we use the example of cooking like there's a way that even at his wonderful Fellowship on it that even when it comes to music we said plane by ear has a has this uh there's a there's something that a downside too or if you can only play by ear it means you can't read music but you know a lot of people can read music but they haven't really even understood what they're reading to the place where now they can write it they can chart it they can understand it they could even find where things need to go and how to even improve on things and have the building blocks to do these things themselves that's what we're talking about even in this cause and effect which will come do that there's more to be understood about the very things that we have so they'll stand on his feet in glory there'd be a book of Acts wrote behind it they take it out in Joy instead of power and faith hold that there and believe it it's God's word stay right with it so the way that he's kind of expressing this is they take the inspiration or they take this the the enthusiasm and they take that energy and they're releasing it in this joyful expression and the emotions instead of being able to channel it and hold it to the word of God and project it to the word of God and watch it rise up in power watch it grow their faith and stay with the word of God now to we're going to be reading from Matthew chapter 21 when Christ is entering into Jerusalem or coming into draw nine to Jerusalem and come to Bethpage and he's as he's near there he recites this we read the story in those first five verses of Jesus saying go into a village and grab these things it says so that it would be written that would be fulfilled with the prophet now in Zechariah Chapter 9 verse 9 now I'm using this as an example of this cause and effect to take us to recognize this subtle difference that I think I want that I'm wanting to show you in Zechariah Chapter 9 verse 9 says Rejoice greatly o Daughter of Zion shout o daughter of Jerusalem Rejoice be joyful be enthusiastic pray shout Rejoice Behold thy King cometh unto thee he is just and having salvation lowly and riding upon an ass and upon a cult the fowl of an ass so there's this is what they're to be doing to rejoice and shouting because your King is Coming and he's just and has salvation like this is this is this characteristics I believe are are connected to the praise connected to the rejoicing and he's described in a prophetic way he's lowly he's humble he's riding on the ass upon the cult the fowl of an acid it's like well why would a king ride in that manner why would he come in this way this is the prophecy given by Zechariah this is how it's fulfilled in Matthew 21 verses 6 to 11. the disciples went and did as Jesus commanded and brought the ass and the cult and put on on them their clothes and they set him thereon so now this is his Royal entry and a very great multitude spread their garments in the way if I could even say this that they're acting under the inspiration of Prophecy like Zechariah wrote it it has to be fulfilled and Jesus even says hey if you don't praise the Rocks who cry out so that's the power behind the prophecy that it's got to be fulfilled and it's going to have an effect and so now I want you just to imagine the great multitude spreading their garments in the way others cut down branches from the trees and strawed them in a way and the multitudes that went before and that followed Christ saying under the inspiration of Prophecy right Hosanna to the son of David blessed is he that cometh in the name Lord hosanna in the highest and what has happened is they're rejoicing they're shouting they're praising as the prophecies being unfolded and these are the rejoicings and the Praises that are being going and then as he comes into Jerusalem all the city was moved everybody was stirred everybody is finding that they've got they had an opinion they had to take they removed it was it was an attraction and the question was who is this this who is this causing the stern the multitude said this is Jesus the prophet of Nazareth of Galilee so now in this story in this event they brother random uses the phrase in different instances when he's telling stories of Christ whether it be with Zach um Zacchaeus and different ones that there was noise that there was this Gathering there was this Aurora that followed him and here's this worship here's this enthusiasm this is an exuberance there's a joy as it says Rejoice greatly o daughter of joy and that's an expression of Joy there to be joyful there to praise and as they're shouting Hosanna to the son of David blessed is he that cometh the name Lord hosanna in the highest this is a triumphal entry this is scripture being fulfilled this is peoples the Bible says they're throwing their clothes in the way they're cutting down branches from the trees and they're shouting and praising but how many knew what was happening how many knew this was Zechariah 9 9. how many knew that this was their Messiah and this is what you think of cause and defect what was happening with this I'm asking what what was taking place what was transpiring and the question could be asked is even says who is this why are you guys all excited I could say why why were they enthused if you saw somebody tearing down a palm branch and somebody's tearing it down and throw it in the way and you say why did you do that oh well this is the the Prophet this is this is a teacher this is a wise manner said well this this is exciting it isn't this great this is a new like ever you want to get all these answers even as Jesus probed his disciples who do you say that I am well this person says this and this is what they all think but who do you say that I am what what's your understanding brother Berman the sermon who is Jesus he's dramatizing the story of Zacchaeus and he's talking about his entry into his City he says and they were singing all kinds of songs and glory to God at our highest and all these fine hymns they were singing and some screaming and shouting he says isn't it strange where Jesus is there's always a lot of noise so when Jesus comes there's noise where Jesus is there's enthusiasm where Jesus says there's excitement so that means that Jesus could be present and he can be near and there can be a lot of residual effects from that but do you know why he's there [Music] do you know what scripture is being fulfilled is there is there a reason for your excitement do you recognize the attraction program described it this way people fanatically screaming pulling off Palm leaves off the trees throwing their clothes in the road screaming this is what's transpiring but how many of them yelled crucify him how many of them were willing how many at the end of the day are gathered in the up room how many were willing to Bear the reproach how many actually recognized what was happening how many of it were really in their hearts knew they were giving praise and adoration not only to their Messiah but to the Lamb of God how many fully recognized it and appreciated it brother Branham even says this exact statement about them at the time few recognized him to be the anointed word of that day despite all the praise all the accolades all the shouting all the rejoicing few actually recognized him for who he was a few very recognized him in his day they didn't recognize their day and its message but they were responding to events transpiring around them with great joy and enthusiasm and the sermon unbelief does not hinder God says but now to the Church of the Living God all those that are in Christ I would like to make this little statement do you realize the hour I could I maybe would just uh maybe fruitless and not even you know a convenient rhetorical exercise but if it's the church of living God that are in Christ you know what gives why do we need to figure out what time it is right I'm in Christ I'm saved I got the Holy Ghost that's all that matters but he says do you realize the hour so there's so many people when you get amongst just men like that and people that from different churches they're not spiritual enough to catch the discernment of it they don't get it and then this is a very striking statement they like to laugh and praise the Lord and Shout in the joy of the Lord and that's fine he's talking about people who just men people in the Church of the Living God the Christians he says they like to laugh they enjoy the joy of the Lord they like to praise like to shout he said that's fine but to get down and find out where that comes from get down and realize what that means let that let that statement stay with us a little bit he's saying oh we have the joy of the Lord and we want that we want worship we want praise we want enthusiasm uh there's there's no law against a shouting and dancing and praising and and where it's in the word we embrace it and so those things are wonderful and I'm certainly one I hope in the way that I teach this it doesn't put a damper on anybody's enthusiasm but there's a there's a maturity that comes when when enthused and when it happened when rejoicing he's saying that we want to have enough spiritual discernment to look at it and find out where that comes from and what it means where is the joy coming from what does this joy mean what is it connected because he says everything's set in order God he's right on time everything's set in order in God he's right on time so God has an order God's moving God's doing something there may be in a way where we see the spirit of God's being poured out people are manifesting certain gifts the Praises and shoutings are happening so oh you see this revival is happening here people are shouting the gifts are being restored all this is happening what you ought to do is have enough spiritual discernment to catch what it means have enough spiritual discernment to find out where it comes from and what it's for you and in this brother Adam is that well this is this is for me I I don't often like to just put it in the way that it strikes me but if I could say this way there was too much emphasis on the effect says they love to laugh praise the Lord shout in the joy of the Lord but they don't get down to find out where it comes from get down to realize what it means they didn't understand the cause there's a lot of bubble dancing but it's like what causes that and as he talked about the Pentecostal he says you got a lot of energy you got a lot of enthusia you've got a lot of excitement you ever asked yourself what that's for you if you asked yourself what all that burning is to do and what God wants you to say oh well it's to make this whistle go no no no the whistle is a byproduct of the the energy that's being produced to get the wheels in motion and you don't want to let it all out in the whistle you want to harness it enough to where it gets the train going gets the makes progress and so this is the part to me that we were like were you just you're trying to be very spiritual because he says they don't get spiritual enough to catch the discernment of it uh who should I is it okay if I continue who should I ask okay all right thank you my eyes landed on just the right person I know it's right we've been right at an hour um so we're entering the after hour stay with me I could stop right here but I don't want to but so if you're looking at this laughing praising shouting the joy of the Lord I'm brother Brandon saying they don't get down to catch the discernment of it to find out where it comes from what it means it begs the question is that the right result that if brother I'm saying that we we in taking all these things together and this is where we're looking at it together I'm wanting you to be a spiritual make it a spiritual exercise for yourself not just wow brother Aaron just tell me what the conclusion is I want you to be examining it yourself I want you to be taking these statements that brother branham's making I want you to begin to process it using the holy ghost in your life to consider these things and and have the Holy Spirit place it place it just right if you could have all these different manifestations and brother man said this is great this is fine but there's something that's greater there's something that has more to do with faith it's going to get us down the road that's going to exercise harness the energy and power that God gives for a particular purpose and get us down the road is the way that maybe they're using it wrong and maybe they're getting the result but is it the actual full result that God wants them to have in other words is it the total complete result in Matthew chapter 5 verse 45 I'm going to try to run through this we've got a few more scriptures and we'll maybe just leave in the middle of a thought but that's going to be fine he says they may and he says that you may be the children of your father which is in heaven for he maketh his son to rise on the evil and the good I'm just focusing on these last two phrases that the sun rises both on the good and the evil it's it's just this it's this element of nature he says and sendeth Reign on the just and the unjust very powerful statement for us to realize that God does not discriminate in terms of blessings and outpourings and the Sunshine and the rain that he allows it to go forth he allows it to come out and this is cause and effect because the sun shines and the rain falls and what happens the seed grows and brother Branham says this so often I'm only pulling a couple statements from 1965. where he's in Eves this phrase both rejoice and both grow the just and the unjust and he uses the wheat and the cocklebur of the weed and the true seed he says they both Rejoice they both get happy they built praise they both Shout they're kind of slumped down and they're thirsty and the blessings begin to pour and fall out and he says they they praise and they shout both and they both grow and they both Rejoice by he says by the same water it says in the sermon things that are to be the weed and the wheat Stand Together Rejoice just as much his head is down oh here it is this is where I get it from it's starving for a drink and when a rain comes the cockleberg can shout just as loud as the wheat can so we don't just go by who shouts the ladders right because it says the the conquerable can shout just as loud as the week can and so then it's I mean let's just use some deductive reasoning that means the the week can shout too can I get a shout right I mean the week can shout too and sometimes we're so afraid to shout because we don't want to be the confused as the cocklebur but don't let a cockle bar out shout you and he makes a statement he says over and over and over and over and over again it comes back to this statement but by the fruit she shall know them now that's interesting because now we have the fruit of joy shouting enthusiasm rejoicing he's saying they both can have it and he says by your fruit shall know they'll like but but isn't that I mean isn't that isn't that is that not one of the fruits I need to go by I need to figure this out so it's a this is a good question isn't it it's a really good question in the seat of discrepancy he revisits the same way and there's so many statements of this I know you're familiar with the same Spirit can fall in a meeting and everybody rejoice in it Hypocrites Christians and all together exactly right but what is it by their fruits they are known that's the only way it can ever be known so when he says by their fruits you will know them by the effect by what is caused this is I know this is an interesting way of thinking by their fruits you shall know them so by the effect you'll know them but not just by the human emotion not just by the expression of joy not just that effect but a fruit that's connected to the real purpose of the cause that there's there has to be more than oh well shouting dancing praising this is how the original church was and this is what we want but what is the spirit to do what is it to produce why why has it been given not just on the day of Pentecost but in the day and hour we're living in now why have the things happened that have happened why is it that God sent a prophet why is it he preached the things that he preached why is the spirit of God moving today and if he's sending an energy he's sending a power he's sending inspiration don't we want it to be used to get the wills to turn to make the progress so we can get out of here and not make the mistake of blowing it out of the whistle and just bubble dancing and to do that it takes us to mature in the first principles to say this is why he's given it this is why we have it so he says by their fruit you will know them you'll know when there's a fruit that is produced that is connected with the real nature of the cause the purpose of the cause you know somebody has read the oil can right when they say hey will you hold this for me I don't want to get oil everywhere so here let me just pour it for you smooth right just and they do like those teas that they do in India right because they know how to pour it in Hebrews chapter 6 verses 7 and 8 this just repeats this for the Earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh offon it and the Earth drink and in Rain brings forth herbs meat for them by whom it is dressed receive a blessing from God so it's in that producing this one Brothers is by the fruits you'll know them so the rain falls on the just and the unjust God Let the Rain Fall it produces Joy on both but it's only going to produce the original seed on one and he says it bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed receiveth blessing from God but that which is beareth thorns and Briars is rejected and is nine to curse and whose end is to be burned but yet coming from the same Earth growing by the same principles of Light and Water germatite being germanized it's growing but it's only can manifest so much as a briar thorn in a thistles he says it's rejected to nine to cursing whose end is to be burned so if I could say it this way when Jesus the rain falls on the just and the unjust but the rain has a specific purpose and there can be General benefits that come from the rain falling but it has a specific purpose it if we go back to and again this is where maybe I wish I had better examples homework assignment you find a better example than the three I used for this you're using it wrong that yeah you're getting something from it and it works great but that's actually not a door stop you can use it this way you can use it that way it has this function it has that function and there's a way we need to recognize oh there's so much more to this and I don't want to just get this and that and have the bubble dance and the shouting the dancing but when you recognize what the rain is really for then it can actually bring forth The Original Seed it can actually bring forth the fruit that the rain is specifically targeting all foreigns will grow weeds Will shout cockerborough will dance but the rain is specifically for the Original Seed it's part of God's design it's part of God's cause and effect where you have the seed and you have the fruit and it becomes food and God has a cause and effect he doesn't want the his Reigns just not falling to make it muddy the rain's not falling just so that the the plants Rejoice is to come spring forth fruit in the sermon excuse me not in the sermon in the scripture there's several scriptures that I bypassed today maybe we picked them up on Wednesday night Paul is talking about you you talk about a joy in one another and God talks about rejoicing in you and joy is actually used in the New Testament in the sense of the cause or occasion for joy this is how even the beginning this is what I was studying it from last week the cause of Joy the occasion of joy so it's Joy not for the sake of joy but joy that's connected to a greater purpose in the same way that love and Ophelia love that's love that's just of the base sentiments and feelings and emotions but then there's agape love which is love of a higher intelligence they're talking about I love a joy that is rooted in the cause that that is that has its connection it understands cause and effect and because of that it's not just the product itself but it understands what it's a part of it in Luke chapter 10 verse 20 it says notwithstanding in this Rejoice not that the spirits are subject unto you he'd be given them power to cast out he says Rejoice not that the spirits are subject unto you but rather rejoice because your names are written in heaven go ahead there's another homework assignment just run that out and start thinking about that the rejoicing and the praise again here's a place where he says Rejoice not in other words if you got happy because demons were subject to you and you got happy because you could cast out spirits and you were getting happy because you could lay hands on the sick and they recover and that was the reason for your joy he's saying don't do it you've got a greater cause for Joy you've got a ray a greater reason for Joy because your names are written in heaven and that's the real core that he wants you to have your joy from because your names are written in heaven and in the book of Nehemiah chapter 8 verse 10 we're just going to catch this last phrase of chapter verse 10 and maybe we'll amplify this greater in the next couple before this month is over then here he says then he said unto them go your way and this this might as well be my scripture for this holiday season eat the fat and drink the sweet and get me excited eat the fat and drink the sweet could anybody print that out on a nice hipster-looking Pinterest instagrammy thing so I can put it in my uh guest bathroom some nice pastels it says eat the fat and drink the sweet make a t-shirt and send portions into them for whom nothing is prepared the connections to this are so beautiful go back and read it we want to go into it deeper we're going to do it today and this felt led just to lay more detailed Foundation for this day is Holy unto our Lord neither be you sorry for the joy of the Lord is your strength I hope this phrase means something totally or means more not totally different but just like wow just a little bit more of an understanding the joy of the Lord is your strength so there this the joy of the Lord and even the joy of Salvation then are not just an emotional effect but it becomes cause and effect in other words where a fact is something that to have a fact it means to have an influence on uh to make a difference to so this is not just joy for the sake of Joy but this is Joy with the power itself this is joy that creates this domino in the Quantum of physics and there's a lot of theories now to where there's they're looking at it and and it's fun just to read how their heads are spinning and trying to figure it out but we say you have cause and effect but they say that there is they have this Theory when the effect actually becomes the cause and and as we talked about feedback loops in Christ my healer and that there's the negative feedback loops that can be very detrimental but there's a way where you get the Dynamo going right and that begins to spin and it's this omnipotence meeting and it creates this eternal energy that'll never stop perpetual motion because they're feeding off each other the right way here is a cause and effect Joy then becomes a cause when it's affected correctly that there's that when when the joy is the joy that God intends when the joy is the joy of the Lord when the joy is the joy of Salvation it's a joy that isn't just merely temporary but it's immutable from the cause it's it's indivisible from that which is spawned it and spurred it you can have the spirit of God moving a service and everyone ah and run themselves right out of the word of God but a joy that comes that you cannot Divide from the thing which caused it where I'm not just impersonating the fruits of the spirit I'm not just rejoicing because demons are subject to the name of Jesus but that I actually have my name joined together with his and it's an indivisible Union and this is the Revelation from which I'm stimulated where it's cause and effect that's Joy is more than just a human emotion the joy of the Lord then think of the joy of the Lord it's when your joy you rejoice in your pleasure is in the Lord see when he says the joy of the Lord is your strength is this is where you see if you could have just said this at about 10 10 40. like we we could have we really could have left but you have god let's say god pushing right God moving and joy right and there's this Joy that's not when when Nehemiah said oh don't be sorry feast and rejoice he's not saying This Joy you have is your strength he's saying the pleasure and joy you have in the Lord the one that's doing the pushing the one that's doing the inspiring the one that's doing the moving you join in him is your strength that's your strength when your joy is in him not when he's making you happy that's your strength but when your satisfaction your pleasure your joy your worth your value is in him not when you base your value on whether or not you danced you shouted you laid hands on the sick you manifested this and you manifested that but when my joy comes from him that's where there's real power that's when that's why we got to be careful not only not to rejoice when your enemies fall but be very careful that you don't zip your lip when the blessings are falling because when the blessings are fallen on others and this church is having a Revival and people are being healed and the gifts are manifested that's like my God that's what the spirit of God will do and you find your joy in him that's doing the moving not in the movement tearing down palm trees taking your clothes off but not being happy in the Messiah that's from whom my joy comes from the joy of the Lord is when your joy is in the Lord not just the joy he gives the joy of Salvation it's not the joy that's only caused by salvation but it is in Salvation it is in it that's where it is where I'm now no longer I've not taken a litmus test every day well are you happy are you excited little Melancholy today brother Aaron do you need to take your Boost Barone whatever you need to get this you take this you get on some uppers there you need some more caffeine how about a uh orange sickle rain or some whatever that flavor is that I thought was just a fun flavored drink one time at Luke's office I think I'm still working off of that and it's been months this is this is your joy I'm not basing it on all these Natural Things do you have salvation that's my joy that's my pleasure that's my excitement that's my enthusiasm not what it brings but it itself it's forever leaked to the cause where the fruit is pointing back to the seed not where all of a sudden ah yeah yeah yeah but Brother Band said spoken words The Original Seed it's not just yeah yeah yeah yeah but it's coming back what caused it why are we here what are the first principles Psalms 35 9 says and my soul shall be joyful in the Lord not my soul will be happy because the Lord made me happy but it will be joyful in the Lord you're finding your constant you're finding your absolute you're making this determination that he is my joy he is my happiness he is my pleasure not he gives me pleasure he makes me happy he is my happiness he is my joy he is my peace my soul shall be joyful Lord and it shall rejoice in his salvation what is our cause for joy Brothers if he'd come what is our what is our reason I even ask this what salvation are you rejoicing in a Stan
