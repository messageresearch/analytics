[0:00] going a step further this morning in the
[0:02] subject of the Kingdom looking at
[0:04] Heaven's mystery Earth's Glory you can
[0:06] already see some of those elements in
[0:07] this text and the scriptures that we
[0:09] just read this is the third part on
[0:12] worldly kingdoms and in looking at
[0:15] worldly kingdoms or wanting to identify
[0:17] the perversion that was sown into
[0:20] creation as we read here he says I
[0:22] created the earth I created man upon the
[0:25] Earth in the beginning God creates the
[0:27] heavens and the Earth and then kind of
[0:29] the culmination of God's creative
[0:30] process is the man and the woman framed
[0:33] there in God's Garden of delight God's
[0:35] pleasure garden and God creates that and
[0:38] so what we're looking at is how that
[0:39] perversion was sown into creation by the
[0:43] wicked one and brother Branham takes uh
[0:46] the the work of the wicked wood and
[0:47] identifies his power his sorcery as if
[0:50] we could say it that way and how that he
[0:52] doesn't have a seed of his own Satan
[0:54] does not have the power to bring forth
[0:56] life and so Satan has to work with
[0:58] something that God created did that
[1:00] would have the power to multiply or the
[1:02] power to replenish in order to have his
[1:06] own children to have his own seed or in
[1:08] order to have those that he could Reign
[1:09] Over and rule over because we identified
[1:12] how brother Brown said that Satan wants
[1:14] to enjoy man just like God does I said I
[1:17] want to be like the most high I want to
[1:18] rule over the stars of God so that's
[1:19] being Satan's ambition he couldn't
[1:21] create a people couldn't have his own
[1:23] creation he had to find a way to access
[1:26] a people and brother Benham uses the
[1:29] term poison and it's the best way to
[1:31] think about it how that it's something
[1:32] that poisoned what the original was when
[1:36] God's power to transform
[1:37] we may have read this Wednesday night he
[1:39] says but to make this point I want to I
[1:42] wanted to give you my analysis of what
[1:44] Satan done in Eden it's just a phrase he
[1:46] doesn't use very much but I love it that
[1:48] the prophet's going to analyze things
[1:49] and in this day of analytics I love to
[1:51] know that brother Branham we have a real
[1:53] scriptural prophetic analyst of things
[1:55] that Satan has done he says what Satan
[1:57] done in Eden sprayed horrible poison
[2:00] spray so he has to use the spray he
[2:02] can't create he has to use the spray
[2:04] in order to deform the original would
[2:07] you like to know what that spray was I
[2:09] can tell you I got the formula of it two
[2:11] words unbelief which is contrary to
[2:13] Faith sprayed unbelief doubt so notice
[2:16] the contrary nature that if there's
[2:18] Faith there's a there's something
[2:20] contrary and then this part to me is the
[2:23] widening of it and the the thinking
[2:25] about this and science filled its place
[2:29] so where poison corrupted something and
[2:31] created this cavity as he says where the
[2:33] cavity is that went into the seed so the
[2:35] seed's been deformed it created the
[2:37] space it hollowed something out Satan
[2:39] filled that cavity with knowledge and
[2:41] Science and civilization and it's
[2:43] deformed the whole entire creation of
[2:46] God now I'll make this point at this
[2:49] point that this is something that
[2:51] doesn't happen immediately in the moment
[2:53] but it's been sewn into creation and at
[2:56] a week in humanity and defile it and
[2:58] bring it low and so it the what began in
[3:01] Eve's mind and then begins to work its
[3:03] way in the natural it creates this
[3:05] vacuum and Science and knowledge fills
[3:07] its place and he's using this analysis
[3:10] for us to think about well what did
[3:12] Satan do this is what he did he sprayed
[3:14] a horrible poison spray and I just want
[3:17] to continue to amplify that image this
[3:19] morning I'm not going to go much further
[3:21] than just that that act of what Satan
[3:23] did in the beginning and so
[3:26] I I guess I'll say this but in doing
[3:29] that I don't want us to become experts
[3:31] on what Satan does even though to
[3:32] overcome is to recognize the devil in
[3:34] every one of his tricks but it's better
[3:36] or it's even just if not more important
[3:39] to know that greater is he that is in
[3:41] you than he that is in the world and is
[3:43] already overcome him so we can have that
[3:46] confidence we can have that uh uh faith
[3:48] not in that oh I know the devil I
[3:50] figured him out I know some people have
[3:52] kind of bragged about oh I got the
[3:53] devil's number and bragged about how
[3:55] well they could defeat the Devil and how
[3:57] well they knew him and what they could
[3:58] stand in and they were standing on the
[4:00] wrong knowledge
[4:01] and fails we want the plan and purpose
[4:03] of God if I could say the kingdom to
[4:06] become plainer that's the part of I want
[4:09] this to become more evident to us is not
[4:11] so much uh the kingdoms of this world to
[4:14] be magnified but by the law of contrast
[4:17] by identifying what is the what are the
[4:20] worldly kingdoms we're understanding
[4:21] better what is our domain
[4:23] and what God has called us to be and so
[4:25] we're going to be diving uh deep today
[4:28] and and maybe just we're not going to
[4:30] cover much ground but maybe just drill
[4:32] down very deep so I trust that you'll be
[4:33] able to focus now we've been reading
[4:35] from Matthew chapter 13. I've been
[4:38] taking this uh the text that brother
[4:40] Branham took in the sermon seat of
[4:41] discrepancy
[4:42] and the parable of the wheat and tears
[4:45] as it's called is about God's planting
[4:48] he said the son of man or God's planting
[4:50] and brother Ben I'm even in relating to
[4:52] this Parable says the seed is the word
[4:53] of God
[4:54] so the parable of the wheat and tares is
[4:56] about God's planting but not just God's
[4:59] planting but Satan's perverting or his
[5:02] poison spray of unbelief and doubt
[5:04] and let's look at verse 27 as it said
[5:07] you know the Kingdom of Heaven is
[5:08] likened unto this uh The Good Seed being
[5:10] sown but then the enemy comes and sows
[5:12] tears among the wheat uh and we've
[5:15] looked at what those tears are in detail
[5:17] and note this verse 27 to me is just a
[5:20] great point to ask using their question
[5:22] to build off this morning so the
[5:24] Servants of the householder came and
[5:26] said unto him because as the verse said
[5:27] that when the wheat sprung up so did the
[5:30] tares and said unto him sir if we could
[5:33] just put it in uh you know plain English
[5:36] you you planted good seed in your field
[5:38] right sir did this thou not not thou so
[5:42] good seed in thy field and it's just a
[5:44] rhetorical question because they don't
[5:45] wait for the answer but they said from
[5:47] Winston half the tears
[5:49] Lord I know that you sowed wheat you
[5:52] sowed good seed I know that you created
[5:53] and when you created you looked at
[5:55] creation and said uh this is good and
[5:57] this is very good and you had a lot of
[5:59] proclamations about it and you you felt
[6:01] a certain way about your creation and so
[6:03] Lord having to or to the the owner of
[6:05] the field the master the field or if you
[6:07] sowed good seed then why are there tears
[6:09] where did they come from and so when
[6:13] Jesus is using the parable and use it in
[6:15] a way of the Mysteries of the kingdom of
[6:17] heaven and speaking up as a parable to
[6:20] the public but it's given unto the
[6:21] disciples to know given unders to know
[6:23] the mysteries of the kingdom of God this
[6:25] Parable is raising the question and so
[6:27] he raises the question how did the tares
[6:29] get there but he's using the parable to
[6:31] ask the question uh but he's also
[6:33] answering the question of why there is
[6:35] wickedness in the world or why the world
[6:38] is wicked and we could look at it that
[6:40] way said this world is not my home and
[6:42] the things of the world and if you love
[6:43] the world and there's a lot of language
[6:45] that we use about the world uh that
[6:47] tells us well there is a world uh that
[6:49] is wicked and there's a world that's
[6:50] evil but then there's a world that God
[6:52] loves
[6:53] that he is acting to redeem and acting
[6:56] to save and that hearkens back to some
[6:58] of the things we took a lot of time on
[6:59] in preaching on uh God so loved the
[7:02] world and there was one who had visited
[7:05] and they heard one part of it and said
[7:06] that was a really really good sermon but
[7:08] we just I disagree with how he
[7:09] characterizes the world and I thought
[7:11] man if they only got my tapes they would
[7:13] have known that in the first three or
[7:15] four parts we used a lot of scriptures
[7:16] to try to explain that there's a world
[7:18] that God loves and there's a world that
[7:20] we're not to love and we can't love it
[7:22] and have the love of God in us so it's
[7:24] maybe it's a little bit of semantics but
[7:26] it helps us to understand there's a
[7:28] correct kind of love there's a wrong
[7:30] kind of love and there's a kind direct
[7:32] kind of object of that love and there's
[7:34] a way that that love is projected to
[7:36] things that aren't in the images they
[7:38] ought to be and so he this is helping to
[7:41] and I love how Jesus does it because
[7:43] everyone's maybe asking well why is
[7:45] there evil in this world and why is
[7:46] there Darkness everywhere everywhere
[7:48] instead of Jesus just answering the
[7:49] question he uses the parable to raise it
[7:52] why are there Wicked people why why is
[7:54] there evil why are there all these
[7:56] things and he's answering the question
[7:57] and his answers in verse 28 an enemy
[8:00] hath done this
[8:01] he's telling us the enemy have done this
[8:03] and he tells us later that the uh the
[8:06] tares are sown by the wicked one
[8:09] and so
[8:10] if I could say this as my summary and or
[8:15] and then I want to just prove this by
[8:17] the word of God God allowed Satan to
[8:21] pervert the kingdom
[8:23] and God allowed Satan to bring forth
[8:26] worldly kingdoms
[8:28] and and so I'm saying that he allowed it
[8:31] and and now maybe for my job now is to
[8:34] prove that by the word of God
[8:36] now in the sermon um see the discrepancy
[8:38] brother banham is teaching us that the
[8:40] tares are
[8:42] seeds of discrepancy sown by Satan so
[8:44] that's how brother Ram is characterizing
[8:46] the tares that are sown into the world
[8:48] he calls them
[8:49] seed the seed of discrepancy he says
[8:52] Satan sowed his seed from the beginning
[8:55] when God placed his first harvest of
[8:57] human beings upon the Earth so isn't
[8:59] that a beautiful characterization God
[9:02] sowed brought forth human beings pure
[9:05] humans Adam and the woman and then Satan
[9:07] sowed his seed the seed of discrepancy
[9:09] from the beginning after God had brought
[9:12] forth humanity and so I believe that
[9:16] this characterization by Brother Branham
[9:18] calling it a seat of discrepancy and
[9:20] this emphasis that he gives it is very
[9:22] important to catch because the same
[9:23] thing in the power of transformation
[9:25] God's power to transform he's wanting us
[9:27] to recognize what Satan does to pervert
[9:30] in order to produce his quote-unquote
[9:32] religious beautiful kingdom remember
[9:34] that's where he works it says oh
[9:35] spiritual wickedness and high places and
[9:37] we think oh the the agenda of the
[9:40] homosexuals and the agenda of the
[9:42] Satanist and if you're not watching out
[9:43] for the Illuminati you're going to miss
[9:45] it when in reality all that is probably
[9:47] just a red herring right it's just
[9:49] trying to distract us where where Satan
[9:52] is is in presenting himself as a
[9:54] messenger of light and an angel of Light
[9:56] and very religious and Polished and
[9:58] quoting the scripture and quoting the
[10:00] word and so when brother bam calls it a
[10:02] seed of discrepancy that is an important
[10:05] emphasis for us to catch and he defines
[10:08] it he's actually using Webster to Define
[10:10] it it means sewing Discord or being
[10:12] contrary he says as Webster says so in a
[10:15] Discord something different or
[10:18] being contrary to what's already been
[10:23] so this is to me it's just helped me so
[10:27] much as a Christian and and recognizing
[10:30] the heart of God and recognizing things
[10:31] that uh oppose the things of God but
[10:34] notice that it's not just
[10:37] a difference
[10:38] but it's a contradiction
[10:40] so you could have something that's
[10:42] different than the other uh but it's
[10:44] it's not a contradiction it's just
[10:46] different you could have sweet and sour
[10:48] right and in that if something's sweet
[10:50] and something sour you say well those
[10:52] those are just different and maybe
[10:54] they're opposites but this is just not a
[10:57] difference this is a contradiction
[10:59] and God we know is a god of variety
[11:03] but not a god of variance
[11:05] God Is Not A sower of Confusion And so
[11:08] his brother Ram defines it from Webster
[11:10] Webster says discrepancy is a conflict
[11:12] or variation as between facts figures or
[11:15] claims so a seated discrepancy is not oh
[11:19] well God sows a human and Satan sows
[11:22] this and and they're just different
[11:23] Satan so something that's against or
[11:26] contrary to the original
[11:29] and so that's that if you could think of
[11:31] it that way that what Satan is trying to
[11:33] accomplish not just something different
[11:35] because I mean if being different was
[11:37] wrong then
[11:39] come on
[11:40] some of us would be in a lot of trouble
[11:43] but it's not God's got a variety and he
[11:46] likes differences in different natures
[11:47] and temperaments and abilities and
[11:49] callings and so God has has a variety
[11:52] but he's not there's not a variance
[11:54] within it to where well I'm this way by
[11:56] the grace of God and you just have to
[11:57] deal with it and and well I'm this way
[12:00] by the grace of God and you're really
[12:01] going to have to deal with it and we
[12:02] just Embrace differences and we Embrace
[12:05] people are different but if it's
[12:06] contrary to the word of God if contrary
[12:09] one to another you say well that that's
[12:11] not the very that's not the variety that
[12:12] God's wanting to achieve
[12:14] so looking at it in the sense of not
[12:16] just being different but at variance or
[12:18] contradiction as President says that's
[12:20] important to recognize and and I'm going
[12:22] to begin to leave the thought in the
[12:24] seat of discrepancy uh because there's
[12:26] just so much depth there I want to give
[12:28] some more time to it that's the see the
[12:31] the stairs are the seed of discrepancy a
[12:34] contradiction not just a difference
[12:36] because the serpent was different than
[12:38] the man in the original
[12:40] but what what Satan does and brings
[12:42] forth is a contradiction to the original
[12:44] word
[12:45] so as we look at it in terms of good
[12:47] seed according to the parable that's
[12:48] sown by God that's just that's righteous
[12:51] that's pure even if there's a there's
[12:52] variety but The Bad Seed is sown by the
[12:55] wicked one and that's contrary
[12:58] uh as it as the parable tells us it's
[13:00] offensive it's against the kingdom of
[13:02] God
[13:03] and now God's original
[13:07] seed was by the spoken word God speaks
[13:11] the word and even if we say in the
[13:13] beginning God created the Heaven and the
[13:14] Earth that's some that's some thought
[13:16] taking shape some thought taking form
[13:18] and we had God creates by the spoken
[13:20] word he sows his seed by the spoken word
[13:22] we know the depth and the message of the
[13:24] hour according to that so then Satan the
[13:27] wicked one his discrepancied seed is by
[13:30] lies so God we say God's spoken word is
[13:33] truth God's not speaking the word and
[13:36] and lying about it and that's kind of
[13:38] what Satan implies a little bit to the
[13:40] woman and says well God doth no yeah
[13:42] yeah right he's trying to kind of create
[13:45] this confusion this poison spray of
[13:47] unbelief and doubt and so Satan sows The
[13:49] Bad Seed the poison or uh the the what
[13:53] produces the tares he sows it by lies it
[13:56] says in Genesis 3 4 and the serpent said
[13:58] unto the woman you shall not surely die
[14:01] that's a seated discrepancy why it's not
[14:05] just it's not something different where
[14:06] God says this in one place and says this
[14:08] and another says well that seems to be
[14:10] different and somehow someway they
[14:12] dovetail or they they match or they
[14:13] balance out they're from different
[14:15] perspectives as Paul says you're
[14:16] justified by faith James says by works
[14:18] when we think well that's a
[14:20] contradiction no that's just different
[14:22] perspectives that that depends on your
[14:24] Vantage Point and so here this is not
[14:26] something that says well we're just all
[14:28] looking at the mountain from different
[14:29] perspectives
[14:30] I'm looking at a mountain and and
[14:32] Satan's saying no that's not a mountain
[14:34] that's a canyon right that's not a
[14:36] different that's not a different
[14:37] perspective he's turned it upside down
[14:38] he says you shall not die and so this is
[14:41] the contradiction this is the
[14:43] discrepancy and so his lie then to the
[14:46] woman he sows that poison spray into the
[14:48] woman's mind and that lie led to an act
[14:51] that produced the tares in the world
[14:54] to understand that the tares being the
[14:57] mixed seed the mimic weed not pure human
[14:59] but not pure serpent it's just drawing
[15:02] that straight from the message of the
[15:03] hour so that brings us uh that can take
[15:07] us to the spoken word
[15:09] versus the spoken lie you have the
[15:11] spoken word you have the spoken lie but
[15:14] this is
[15:15] that this is now
[15:17] uh
[15:18] I want to make this statement correctly
[15:22] because my whole everything hinges on
[15:24] this moment
[15:25] so if it fails we can maybe go to lunch
[15:27] early because it's we're going to be
[15:29] wasting our time if I fumble this one
[15:33] a lie cannot exist on its own
[15:37] a lie a lie cannot it cannot just be
[15:40] alive I said well this is a lie you have
[15:41] to kind of you need some context okay
[15:42] what what makes it a lie sometimes we're
[15:45] asked a question and it contains five
[15:47] different assumptions and you really
[15:48] can't answer it without identifying the
[15:51] assumptions and what you I can't answer
[15:52] that because you've asked me several
[15:54] different things and the one phrase and
[15:55] if I answer yes or no I validate all the
[15:58] assumptions that are baked into the
[16:00] question
[16:02] and so one way if you're ever being
[16:04] deposed and you don't like the question
[16:05] you're asking there's really not a good
[16:07] way to answer it just say I'm sorry
[16:08] could you repeat the question you do
[16:10] that enough times opposing counsel is
[16:12] going to change the question enough to
[16:14] where it's safe to answer
[16:18] so the LA a lie does not exist on its
[16:22] own in other words it's dependent upon
[16:24] truth and that interesting way to think
[16:26] about it that when Satan goes to speak a
[16:29] Lie the original had to exist first so
[16:31] he could know how to contradict it
[16:34] so it's not like go ahead Satan tell us
[16:36] your story he's like well can he go
[16:38] first
[16:40] because I don't have anything original
[16:43] and and
[16:45] I don't want to be like a blind squirrel
[16:47] that finds a nut every once in a while
[16:48] and actually say something true so you
[16:50] go ahead and whatever you say I'm going
[16:51] to say the opposite
[16:55] now in the sermon God's power to
[16:56] transform again
[16:58] we'll just read from two different
[16:59] places that are pretty near to each
[17:00] other he says God is the Fountain of all
[17:02] Grace and Power
[17:03] again think a lie is dependent upon
[17:06] truth truth has to exist first before
[17:08] there can be a lie or if I could say
[17:10] this a lie only exists as a consequence
[17:14] of Truth
[17:16] and is not an original
[17:22] God is the Fountain of all Grace and
[17:24] power and of all Divine wisdom is in God
[17:26] so therefore knowing that he is the only
[17:28] Creator there is you thought you were
[17:30] going to be done hearing it last week
[17:31] I'm going to keep saying it over and
[17:33] over again there's none other Creator
[17:34] but God Satan cannot create where are we
[17:37] at on that number 19 at all he only
[17:39] perverts what's been created but God is
[17:42] the only creator
[17:45] so Satan cannot create only God can
[17:47] create uh 20 so paragraphs later he says
[17:50] now after it's all so well and set in
[17:53] order this is in the beginning after God
[17:54] created God felt sure now that this
[17:56] would be all right and then when he did
[17:58] then came in the enemy
[18:00] the enemy have done this he says and I'm
[18:02] going to call this fellow with power not
[18:05] to create again but he had power to
[18:08] deform not transform
[18:10] so when something is up
[18:13] changing and and there's some some
[18:17] transition that takes place you say oh
[18:19] well that's that's transformation this
[18:21] is this is uh a positive development
[18:24] this is good well no only God transforms
[18:27] to the kingdom Satan deforms uh to to
[18:31] his kingdoms so he says I'm going to
[18:32] call him a deformer now anything
[18:34] deformed
[18:36] is taken from its original state there's
[18:39] something that's gone wrong with it
[18:42] so there's something original that God
[18:44] has created and that's the material that
[18:46] Satan has to work with because he can't
[18:47] just create a deformity
[18:49] he has to take the original and find one
[18:51] way to change it or pervert it so the
[18:54] two powers in the beginning the power to
[18:55] create uh which we say would be Faith or
[18:58] the power to deform which is doubt and
[19:00] unbelief those are the two powers that
[19:02] exist faith and unbelief and doubt
[19:05] now I think that's sufficient there to
[19:08] kind of bring just kind of get was just
[19:10] set Satan right here and he's on trial
[19:12] right now and he's kind of twisting a
[19:14] little bit and this is what we're
[19:15] looking at is Satan in the beginning so
[19:17] turn to Ezekiel 28. let's catch the
[19:19] nature of the sower of the tares because
[19:21] God wants us to know
[19:23] God wants us to know these things now
[19:25] this is describing Lucifer we've read in
[19:28] Isaiah 14
[19:30] uh We've read in different places that
[19:31] recognize his ambition but notice this
[19:34] further characterization of Satan so
[19:35] that we can understand what this power
[19:37] to deform is Thou Art the anointed
[19:40] cherub that covereth
[19:41] and I have set these so so God did this
[19:44] that's what's on upon the holy mountain
[19:45] of God that has walked up and down to
[19:47] the midst of the stones of fire think of
[19:49] this characterization of him that was
[19:52] perfect in thy ways from the day that
[19:53] thou was created till iniquity was found
[19:56] in thee been reading a lot of the the
[19:59] Jewish history and the oral tradition
[20:00] about the creation and about Lucifer
[20:03] and what he would have been walking on
[20:05] and even the reasons why this was
[20:08] iniquity was found in him whether it had
[20:11] been and some right that he was he
[20:13] became jealous of creation became
[20:16] jealous of the very thing that God was
[20:17] creating that in some way he began to
[20:20] recognize the position and power of
[20:23] Michael a record recognized some vacuum
[20:25] or some place that God was feeling and
[20:28] so he had this ambition to have that and
[20:31] so he gets jealous of what God is doing
[20:34] and that's that's where it begins and so
[20:36] God's describing Lucifer the anointed
[20:39] cherub that covereth it says that he was
[20:40] made with tablets and he was made
[20:42] beautiful and and it says you were
[20:44] perfect the day you were created till
[20:48] iniquity was found in thee
[20:51] remember how brother Brown emphasizes
[20:53] over and over again sin did not begin on
[20:56] Earth it began in heaven and we're all
[20:58] like what
[21:00] right like how can that even be
[21:02] but if you could just to help us out a
[21:04] little bit God dwells alone all there is
[21:07] is God he feels there's no time or space
[21:10] it's just God
[21:12] so then when God creates
[21:15] and I I need to be I don't want to open
[21:17] up a door to
[21:18] some of these really awesome things on
[21:20] Elohim and now God takes that form then
[21:23] as he begins to create space in which he
[21:26] works and he creates Angels that's where
[21:28] sin began not in God but in what he's
[21:32] formed and brought forth and what he
[21:34] begins to create says I created you he
[21:35] created Lucifer the son of the Mormon
[21:37] the anoint of Cherub and so this is
[21:39] where sin begins you were perfect till
[21:41] iniquity was found in thee billabam says
[21:43] in the sermon and uh who can remarry did
[21:46] you know Satan was co-equal with God one
[21:48] day
[21:50] sure was all but a creator
[21:56] do I have to explain it for our visitors
[22:00] in the sermon marriage and divorce did
[22:01] you know Satan was co-equal with God one
[22:03] day sure he was all but a Creator he was
[22:06] everything stood at the right hand of
[22:07] God in the heavens the great leading
[22:10] cherubim
[22:11] so if he's equal with God
[22:15] in every respect and I'll read some more
[22:16] statements to this effect
[22:18] if he's equal to God in every respect
[22:21] except the power to create he had the
[22:25] power of self-will
[22:27] he has the power to choose so he is
[22:31] created he has every Power he can except
[22:34] the ability to create
[22:35] now think of how beautiful it is that if
[22:37] you have
[22:38] uh faith
[22:40] right and if deity is in you you've got
[22:42] power to create another world and go
[22:45] live on it
[22:46] amen no wonder no wonder Satan hated us
[22:48] right you mean you're going to give them
[22:50] what you need
[22:52] but he has full complete equality with
[22:57] God except the power to create and so he
[22:59] has this is I believe this is a direct
[23:02] implication what brother I'm saying he
[23:04] can choose his own way but he can't
[23:06] create his own way
[23:08] he can choose he can Rebel he can
[23:10] disagree and it's even something uh that
[23:14] we're quite honest about in our own
[23:16] family as we talk and as we grow and as
[23:17] I I don't know anything and my teenagers
[23:20] know everything uh that it's okay to
[23:22] disagree
[23:23] that's disagreements are expected and
[23:26] they're understood and so Satan had the
[23:28] power to disagree
[23:30] and I guess the distinction would be I'm
[23:32] certainly not God and so there's certain
[23:33] there's room to have a difference of
[23:34] opinion in our household but when it
[23:36] comes to God everything he says is truth
[23:38] everything he does is just but Satan had
[23:40] the ability the power of self-will
[23:43] Billy Ram says it again in the Seal of
[23:45] the Antichrist the right man hand man of
[23:47] the almighty God was Lucifer the son of
[23:49] the morning
[23:51] the first God granted him almost
[23:52] co-workers with him he was a co-worker
[23:55] partly equal with him only Satan could
[23:57] not create so again remember that just
[24:01] as man was given free moral agency there
[24:05] is a Freemore agency when it comes to
[24:07] Angels
[24:08] he's given this to Satan has a he's
[24:10] co-equaled with God and God has a will
[24:12] God has a desire God can choose God can
[24:14] create Satan is the same in every
[24:16] respect except he does not have power to
[24:18] create God is the only Creator but Satan
[24:20] took something that God created and
[24:22] perverted it back into something else
[24:24] eval
[24:26] and now notice when Cain and Abel very
[24:28] beautiful picture of it and I I left
[24:30] this in there because now notice how he
[24:31] projects forward Cain and Abel was
[24:33] nothing more than the pre-figure of
[24:36] Judas and Jesus
[24:38] was God not God was aiming to something
[24:40] right and and God was
[24:43] uh he was doing something in a way and
[24:46] brother loyal used a military term this
[24:47] morning on not being outflanked and so
[24:50] God was doing something and the devil
[24:52] was pursuing hard after it right well
[24:54] what was God doing little head fake
[24:56] right
[24:58] goes this way and the devil's like all
[25:00] in and where does he end up Judas and
[25:02] Jesus
[25:03] he says that this is the prefigure of it
[25:05] and so these are the seeds in the
[25:07] beginning that and their manifestation
[25:09] in the days of Christ and I'm wanting to
[25:11] get there in detail
[25:12] uh eventually so now you see the seed in
[25:14] the beginning produced an Abel and a
[25:16] cane and then we see it he says that's
[25:17] the pre-figure of Jesus and Judas
[25:22] so the the
[25:25] the point I wanted to build on now is
[25:28] Satan is equal with God except the power
[25:29] to create and that and he had the power
[25:32] of self-will
[25:33] so now as it says you were perfect until
[25:36] iniquity was found in thee let's watch
[25:38] this iniquity and Luke chapter 10 verses
[25:40] 17 to 20. it says the seventy returned
[25:43] again with Joy saying Lord even the
[25:46] devils are subject unto us through thy
[25:47] name so there's the power of the name of
[25:49] Jesus they recognize that devils are
[25:51] subject to this name why because this is
[25:54] on a higher order
[25:55] all right Satan can work within Humanity
[25:58] but now the name of Jesus evokes deity a
[26:01] new creation a new power the kingdom
[26:04] that's greater than all the kingdoms of
[26:05] this world and so they are subject to it
[26:07] just as Adam in the beginning was given
[26:10] dominion over All Flesh now the name of
[26:12] Jesus speaks of a kingdom that's greater
[26:14] than nature and greater than time
[26:16] greater than science greater than uh the
[26:18] laws of nature here they are casting out
[26:20] demons and the the response I want to
[26:23] read the whole response to verse 20. he
[26:26] says I beheld Satan as lightning fall
[26:28] from Heaven
[26:30] now catch that image I beheld Satan
[26:32] falling from Heaven as lightning or as
[26:35] lightning fall from Heaven
[26:37] now that's an interesting point to make
[26:40] but he says behold I give unto you power
[26:42] to tread on serpents and now he's
[26:43] connecting as I see Satan fall
[26:45] he says I give you power to tread on
[26:47] serpents and scorpions so now that the
[26:49] sting and the nastiness and the evil and
[26:52] over all the power of the enemy Satan
[26:55] has fallen out of Heaven he gives us the
[26:57] image of the serpent and scorpions and
[26:59] he says now I've given you power over
[27:01] all the giving you power over all the
[27:03] power of the enemy
[27:04] this is what you've been given you power
[27:07] over it by my name you're giving power
[27:08] so he's wanting to see that in View and
[27:10] nothing shall by any means hurt you but
[27:12] he says not we're standing in this
[27:14] Rejoice not that the spirits are subject
[27:16] unto you but rather rejoice
[27:19] Now Catch the contrast
[27:21] Satan is falling from Heaven he says
[27:24] Rejoice because your names are written
[27:26] in heaven so one has left his place one
[27:30] remains Satan is cast out of heaven but
[27:33] your names are in heaven so he's saying
[27:35] there's a greater representation don't
[27:37] just get all excited about what you
[27:38] could conjure up here on Earth and what
[27:40] you can do here on Earth and Cashing Out
[27:42] devils and speaking with tongues and all
[27:43] these different things he said I've
[27:45] given you that power it's the power
[27:46] that's in the name and and a lot of
[27:48] people can use it be saying the greatest
[27:50] thing is to happen all that your name
[27:52] your name is written in heaven
[27:55] like that that that's the point that
[27:57] he's saying this is what matters
[27:59] and Jesus then is contrasting different
[28:02] kingdoms he's identifying the kingdom of
[28:04] heaven and what we ought to rejoice in
[28:06] and worldly kingdoms
[28:08] and the whole and he's and I believe
[28:10] that the way he says this is all we're
[28:12] Cashing Out Devils or cash out Devils he
[28:14] wants to bring into view the entire
[28:17] economy of evil
[28:19] the serpents the Scorpions the the
[28:21] things that hurt and offend the Devils
[28:24] the spirits this entire economy of evil
[28:27] is tied to Satan falling from heaven
[28:31] behold I behold held Satan as lightning
[28:33] fall from Heaven remember in Isaiah 14
[28:35] 12 how about fallen from Heaven oh
[28:38] Lucifer son of the morning
[28:40] you are fallen from Heaven the scripture
[28:44] tell us Lucifer motivated by pride and
[28:46] by lust for power he chooses of his own
[28:50] self-will to pervert righteousness
[28:52] let's just read it in Revelations
[28:54] chapter 12 verses 3 4 5 and then verse 9
[28:57] and
[28:58] there's a lot of there's a lot of detail
[29:00] here a lot of depth in this he says and
[29:03] there appeared another Wonder in heaven
[29:05] and be held Behold a great red dragon
[29:08] having seven heads and ten horns and
[29:12] seven crowns upon his heads I said
[29:14] dragons aren't necessarily the cute
[29:16] cuddly things
[29:18] that we might think they are
[29:21] I think the whole
[29:22] uh babylon's
[29:26] book is How to Train Your Dragons
[29:33] nothing against it just
[29:36] just know a lot of people are squirming
[29:37] or laughing right now
[29:39] says so now notice what this great red
[29:41] dragon does and his tell Drew the third
[29:43] part of the stars of Heaven that notice
[29:45] the power that he has in his tail his
[29:47] tell Drew the third part of the stars of
[29:49] heaven and it casts them to the Earth
[29:51] and we know brother Branham tells us
[29:52] that it's the third part of the stars of
[29:54] heaven or a third of the angels fall or
[29:56] he gets them to rebel against Michael
[29:59] has told you the third part of the stars
[30:01] of heaven and did cast them to the Earth
[30:04] the dragon stood before the woman which
[30:06] was ready to be delivered for to devour
[30:07] her child as soon as it was born we see
[30:09] this image in Christ brother Brown
[30:10] relates it to the days of Herod and the
[30:12] slaughter of the the children two and
[30:13] under and she brought forth a man-child
[30:15] this is many to agree this is Christ who
[30:18] was to rule all nations with the rod of
[30:20] iron this is the Messiah the Jews were
[30:21] expecting day one it says and her child
[30:24] was caught up unto God into his throne
[30:25] so even though they try to try to kill
[30:28] him and Vanquish them he's caught up to
[30:30] God and he doesn't rule with the rod of
[30:33] iron but this Christ that comes forth
[30:34] and you can see those types tracking in
[30:36] that language so then it says in verse 9
[30:38] and the Great Dragon was cast out that
[30:39] old serpent called The Devil in Satan
[30:41] which deceiveth the whole world
[30:44] he was cast out into the Earth and his
[30:47] angels were cast out with him
[30:50] brother bam says Satan and his satanic
[30:52] religion are represented in the Great
[30:54] Dragon Satan in his satanic religion
[30:57] and in
[30:59] a
[31:01] in heaven if I could just put it this
[31:03] way I'm not going to put a period on
[31:04] this on the other application to this
[31:06] but in heaven Satan Lucifer Rebels
[31:10] against God's Kingdom
[31:12] he Rebels against the order he Rebels
[31:15] against the word and iniquity is found
[31:17] in him and he's he causes a third of the
[31:19] angels to fall and what God does is he
[31:23] cast him he's going to cast him to Earth
[31:25] I beheld Satan Fall Out of Heaven down
[31:28] to earth now watch this and I let your
[31:30] light so shine before men I want you to
[31:32] see that brother bam taught this and did
[31:34] you know the devil lives in class
[31:37] this isn't an argument against going to
[31:39] school he's talking about Society class
[31:41] right he says do you know what caused
[31:43] the first battle in heaven was when
[31:46] Lucifer set up a great class of people
[31:49] got a better class of angels He thought
[31:51] a big bigger Kingdom a more brighter
[31:53] shinier Kingdom than Michael had I can
[31:56] do this better
[31:57] all this power and potential that exists
[31:59] up here why don't we do this veteran I
[32:01] look at this and we ought to be flashy
[32:03] ought to be bigger ought to be brighter
[32:04] and he was kicked out of heaven
[32:07] so this is I'm always recognize saying
[32:09] that Lucifer was kicked out of heaven
[32:10] here's Heaven here's a domain and a
[32:12] realm that God has created that's
[32:13] invisible and he's cast out of that
[32:16] domain to the Earth he says and he was
[32:18] kicked out of heaven so where class
[32:19] comes where class comes from stay away
[32:22] from class again children we're talking
[32:24] about Prestige and social standing and I
[32:28] love this the hungry don't want class
[32:29] the hungry wants food
[32:31] yes sir the cold wants fire not a
[32:34] picture a fire and the hungering
[32:36] thirsting for God wants the gospel and
[32:38] power of Jesus Christ
[32:40] amen no matter how simple it is how
[32:42] unpopular it is with the world they want
[32:44] reality
[32:46] recognize how the devil can only offer
[32:48] things that look good but never satisfy
[32:50] it may
[32:52] bells and whistles and a lot of
[32:53] amenities but it's never going to
[32:54] satisfy that Soul thirst it's never
[32:57] going to give you what you need to
[32:58] overcome it may give you things to
[33:01] pretend you fit but it's not going to
[33:03] give you things to where you belong and
[33:05] are satisfied and I love how he says the
[33:07] hungry don't want class
[33:10] Hallelujah if you're not hungry you'll
[33:12] take class but if you're hungry you
[33:14] don't want class you want food
[33:16] Hallelujah
[33:18] so now just this is just skimming here
[33:21] quickly
[33:23] so when iniquities found in heaven it
[33:25] can't stay there
[33:29] so God cast iniquity Out of Heaven down
[33:31] to earth
[33:33] iniquities found well there can't be a
[33:35] rebellion in heaven and God like well
[33:37] I'll just draw a bigger Circle
[33:39] right God says oh okay you want to rebel
[33:43] he cast them down to earth
[33:45] because in John 1 5 God had God first
[33:48] John 1 5.
[33:49] this with God there cannot be evil
[33:53] he said this is the message we've heard
[33:54] from the beginning of declaring to you
[33:55] that God is light and in him is no
[33:57] Darkness at all
[33:58] so this Darkness could not exist with
[34:01] God
[34:03] this Darkness as this iniquity is found
[34:05] it causes this rebellion and trying to
[34:08] remember who it was I was fellowshiping
[34:09] with the son it was always my my
[34:11] father-in-law brother John Martin we are
[34:13] fellowshipping on things and it just
[34:14] struck me as he was sharing some things
[34:16] that Satan in the beginning or before
[34:19] the beginning in heaven when iniquities
[34:21] found in him and he begins to have this
[34:23] of his own will begin to disagree
[34:25] and and maybe begin this rebellion and
[34:28] this dragon is using his tail to cause a
[34:31] third of the angels to fall
[34:33] is it possible that he thought well if
[34:35] he's God how am I getting away with this
[34:38] right how come in the moment the moment
[34:42] I thought it I just
[34:44] right it just disappear
[34:46] so he begins to get lifted up in the
[34:48] fact that God's letting him get away
[34:49] with it
[34:50] and this is what you got to be careful
[34:52] we could we can do things and do things
[34:54] and do things and do things and do
[34:55] things I feel like lightning hasn't
[34:57] struck yet hey everything seems to be
[35:00] holding together pretty good and you
[35:01] think you're getting away with it and
[35:03] you're not
[35:04] and this is how this is why how the
[35:06] devil has the capacity to deceive the
[35:07] whole world is because he's deceived
[35:09] himself first
[35:10] the best kind of liars are the ones that
[35:12] believe their own lie right they're
[35:14] drunk on their own crown and they
[35:16] believe it I remember one time we met
[35:18] this guy and he told such outlandish
[35:19] lies that you'd be a fool not to believe
[35:22] him he's like nobody would say their dad
[35:24] is flying here right now in a helicopter
[35:26] to hand a certified check for a million
[35:29] dollars because you're like man I'm
[35:30] listening for blades right because your
[35:32] gig is up in about 15 minutes if not 15
[35:34] days like what happened to the
[35:35] helicopter well he got stuck in traffic
[35:37] all right I mean it's like your gig's up
[35:39] but somebody who really believes it will
[35:41] tell lies and that's what makes them
[35:43] convincing because they've somehow
[35:44] convinced themselves Justified of the
[35:47] veracity of it become very very
[35:49] convincing and usually give a lot of
[35:51] details to it when they do so and so
[35:53] this is
[35:54] Satan is now beginning to work and
[35:57] thinks he's maybe getting away with it
[35:59] but God has a plan to deal with it he's
[36:01] just got to let it he's got to let it
[36:02] manifest
[36:04] in Genesis 1 2 now
[36:07] God had a plan this is he said that God
[36:09] had a plan and he said well where did
[36:11] these things line up
[36:12] uh you know it's kind of hard to tell
[36:14] which comes first but we know what was
[36:16] at one point he says and God in the
[36:18] beginning God created the Heaven and the
[36:19] Earth in verse two and the Earth was
[36:21] without form and void
[36:23] in darkness was upon the face of the
[36:25] deep
[36:26] and the spirit of God moved upon the
[36:28] face of the waters so now this image I
[36:30] beheld Satan fall from Heaven is
[36:33] lightning oh Lucifer how I thought
[36:36] fallen from heaven and so there's this
[36:37] image of not just him rebelling but even
[36:40] this image of him brothers and him being
[36:42] cast to Earth
[36:43] so at some point after iniquity has been
[36:46] found in them God then whether the
[36:48] iniquities found after the Heaven and
[36:49] Earth in the beginning God created the
[36:50] Heaven and Earth
[36:51] and then Satan Rebels and then he's cast
[36:54] to Earth or there's this Rebellion then
[36:56] God creates however you'd want to line
[36:58] it up in your chronology we see that the
[37:00] Earth is without form and void and
[37:02] darkness was upon the face of the deep
[37:04] now this is a very contrary existence
[37:07] Jeremiah 4 23 I behold the Earth and low
[37:09] and it's using this to describe even the
[37:11] condition of Jerusalem it was without
[37:12] form and void and the heavens they had
[37:15] no light
[37:16] so God in the being creates Heaven and
[37:18] Earth but now there is
[37:21] if I could say this if but momentarily
[37:25] God creates the heavens and the Earth
[37:28] if just temporarily or for a moment
[37:31] it exists as the exact opposite of the
[37:34] kingdom of in the Kingdom which is
[37:35] invisible in heaven
[37:38] so you have God in whom there is no
[37:40] Darkness
[37:41] you have this Kingdom of Heaven this
[37:44] Dimension where Elohim and his angels
[37:46] and whatever whatever levels of the
[37:49] heavens you might have but we would
[37:50] recognize this that's light and and
[37:52] that's power and that's Beauty and
[37:54] that's all that's good and then whenever
[37:56] iniquity is found in Lucifer and he
[37:58] causes the third of the angels to Rebel
[37:59] that they're cast down to earth and then
[38:02] as God describes his first description
[38:04] after creating the heavens and the Earth
[38:05] there is a characterism of its without
[38:09] form and void darkness is on the face of
[38:12] the deep and then Jeremiah says the
[38:13] Earth is without form and void this
[38:14] emptiness
[38:16] uh and what it represents and and
[38:18] there's a lot of verbiage we could give
[38:20] to it a lot of amplification to these
[38:22] terms but it says in the heavens or dark
[38:25] the firmaments above the things that
[38:27] would be part of the creation Heaven and
[38:28] Earth being one creation and so in this
[38:31] moment with all its mass of chaos and uh
[38:35] turbidity and and everything without
[38:37] shape and all the darkness it exists as
[38:41] an opposite to heaven
[38:43] right where there's order there's light
[38:46] there's God now in this opposite chaos
[38:49] no form no or order
[38:52] and then in Job 1 7 I'm just using this
[38:54] to make a point about Satan being cast
[38:56] down to earth and the Lord said unto
[38:57] Satan with camisole then Satan answered
[38:59] the Lord and said from going to and fro
[39:01] in the Earth
[39:02] and walking up and down in it
[39:04] so what does this tell us this is where
[39:06] Satan has been cast
[39:08] when Satan is cast out of Heaven he
[39:10] comes to Earth and here he is entrenched
[39:12] in darkness now
[39:15] project a little bit when God cast him
[39:17] down to earth Satan might have been like
[39:18] oh this is this is my permanent Dwelling
[39:22] Place
[39:23] This Is My Punishment this is my
[39:25] Purgatory this is my eternal hell maybe
[39:26] the terms that we would use and God's
[39:28] casting to him down to that but that's
[39:30] where God cast Satan and All His angels
[39:32] and so darkness and Chaos become Satan's
[39:35] dwelling it's the realm that God
[39:37] relegates sin because God has a plan as
[39:39] soon as there's iniquity in heaven God
[39:41] cast it down to earth it's now with this
[39:43] great mass of chaos and darkness this is
[39:45] where Satan is walking upon the void and
[39:47] everything that's without form and this
[39:49] is where Satan's dwelling so it's the
[39:51] nature of Satan to walk upon this Earth
[39:53] is even said in First Peter 5 8 be sober
[39:56] be vigilant because your adversary of
[39:58] the devil as a Roy in line walketh about
[40:00] seeking whom he may devour
[40:02] but now he's in his own Eden
[40:05] I'm just I wanted to fast forward a
[40:07] little bit so that we don't lose track
[40:08] of what I'm the points I'm trying to
[40:09] make but if I said so Lucifer is on
[40:11] Earth today trying to work in the church
[40:13] to accomplish the same person purpose
[40:15] that he started before the foundation of
[40:17] the world
[40:20] he's still in the world today
[40:22] trying to work the same purpose that he
[40:24] started with in heaven
[40:26] to have a better Kingdom
[40:28] a brighter Kingdom in the sermon Oneness
[40:31] brother man says what is Satan anything
[40:34] contrary to the word
[40:36] he doesn't have salvation
[40:39] he doesn't have light
[40:41] his kingdom is Darkness the end thereof
[40:44] is death
[40:45] darkness and death is Satan's kingdom
[40:48] brother Brandon repeat it again what is
[40:49] Satan's kingdom anything contrary to the
[40:53] word
[40:54] so when Satan is in heaven and iniquity
[40:56] is found in him and he causes the third
[40:58] of the angels to rebel against Michael
[40:59] God cast them down to Earth but remember
[41:02] that's not God just dealing with it I
[41:05] said all right we're done don't have to
[41:07] worry about him this is his sandbox let
[41:09] him have fun God wants to deal with
[41:11] iniquity because God's purpose even for
[41:13] the Earth hasn't even begun to unfold
[41:16] we know the purpose that he created the
[41:18] Earth for but now recognize this nature
[41:20] of Satan as God is even foreshadowing
[41:22] the very beginning the Earth is without
[41:23] form and void it's chaotic it's dark
[41:25] there's no darkness in God but now
[41:27] there's Darkness upon Earth and that's
[41:28] where he put Satan that's where he's
[41:29] dwelling in anything contrary to the
[41:32] word is Satan's kingdom and his kingdom
[41:35] is darkness and death
[41:38] all right are you together with me to
[41:40] this point
[41:41] now in this the sermon job preached in
[41:44] Phoenix
[41:47] he says you know the old argument is
[41:50] like some of the unemployed are like I
[41:52] need to listen to that
[41:53] in the Book of Job
[41:55] and the sermon job he says you know the
[41:57] old argument is and come on
[41:59] haven't we thought this why couldn't God
[42:02] have bypassed all this and not had any
[42:04] of it
[42:06] why
[42:07] why create an angel that could choose
[42:10] oh why give it enough time
[42:13] given enough time is there not a war of
[42:15] attrition and one who's uh has self-will
[42:19] and given enough billions of years I
[42:21] mean that's what the scientists are
[42:22] banking on when it comes to uh evolution
[42:24] is I've given seven billion years I mean
[42:26] it's just conceivable that a single cell
[42:28] organism is going to go into us you know
[42:31] Buy cell whatever they call it you know
[42:33] it's a double sell uh amoeba like hey I
[42:36] know my language isn't right there but
[42:37] anyways neither is their reasoning
[42:40] they say well just given enough time you
[42:42] know something's gonna mess up
[42:45] and so there's he's saying well why
[42:47] couldn't God just put all of this
[42:49] you know could you kept this from
[42:51] happening
[42:52] but God now notice where he goes to
[42:54] answer this but God putting Satan almost
[42:56] co-equal with him
[42:58] Satan taking the things of God and
[42:59] perverting them into the evil thoughts
[43:02] and through there begin to pervert
[43:04] things into evil instead of good
[43:07] so in order for Satan to make evil he
[43:10] had to start with good couldn't
[43:12] organically create good
[43:14] God makes them co-equal someone said God
[43:16] couldn't God bypass all this and where
[43:18] do we where do we go if we have a time
[43:20] machine where do we travel back to to
[43:22] try to stop all this
[43:24] and he said well you'd have to go back
[43:25] when he created Lucifer you're like well
[43:27] man time travel is one thing right how
[43:30] do I go there
[43:32] so he says Satan was almost co-equal
[43:34] with him
[43:35] now this is a part where I hope to get
[43:37] some momentum and just to the end
[43:41] and
[43:42] as soon as the first thing was done
[43:46] now Satan self-will is going to Rebel in
[43:50] heaven
[43:51] soon as the first thing was done out of
[43:53] his great treasure chest of love he had
[43:56] a Plan of Redemption that quick
[43:59] because it's already in him
[44:01] so he's saying as soon as Satan did what
[44:03] he did and again this attacks The
[44:05] Narrative that God was responding to
[44:09] Satan
[44:09] all right there's a chess board set up
[44:11] and they're up there and Satan makes a
[44:13] move and God's like whoa
[44:15] that's a new opening
[44:17] hey and he's got to think about his next
[44:19] move as we said before God set up the
[44:22] pieces and walked away
[44:24] right because the devil's going
[44:26] going to the other side
[44:28] right
[44:29] and he thinks he thinks he's got I I got
[44:31] control of the board I'm going to win
[44:32] this no Donald he's gonna put himself in
[44:35] check
[44:36] hey how did this happen
[44:37] how did this happen
[44:40] so God immediately that quick had a plan
[44:42] all this is so good didn't have to sit
[44:44] down and think it all over how would it
[44:46] be he was God infinite he knew how it'd
[44:50] be he had it in his heart his great
[44:53] heart
[44:54] how he would bring all this about
[44:57] and then if he fore knew the church for
[44:59] a new Christ four knew the plan
[45:01] and set it all in order and the world
[45:04] turning around
[45:06] if I just pause on that when Satan
[45:09] rebelled in the beginning God didn't
[45:12] have a backup plan this was part of his
[45:15] plan
[45:17] and he he had a way of allowing by those
[45:20] who by self-will
[45:22] will reject him
[45:24] he would it first begins in heaven he
[45:27] says I've created something oh I think
[45:29] this is just so beautiful he creates an
[45:31] earth without form and void and he cast
[45:33] Satan and his demons into the Earth
[45:36] because he wants to use that to deal
[45:39] with him
[45:40] says oh my these created the Earth to
[45:43] deal with Satan he's decreed that
[45:44] created the Earth to destroy Satan well
[45:46] not just that
[45:49] he created the Earth to get a bride out
[45:51] of him
[45:52] and what a beautiful story he's going to
[45:55] get a bride out of it and she's the one
[45:57] that puts him under her feet
[46:02] Hallelujah and she fulfills kind of that
[46:04] final blow of Prophecy to place him
[46:07] under our feet in this end time
[46:11] culmination of Genesis 3 15.
[46:14] so God he says and notice how he
[46:16] empathize and you being dead to yourself
[46:17] dead in Christ and Alive After You're
[46:19] Dead Yourself alive in Christ God's work
[46:22] in all things together for the good to
[46:24] them that love him
[46:27] and how can you lose
[46:28] [Music]
[46:30] you just can't lose
[46:32] there's no way of losing
[46:37] Hallelujah
[46:40] you know how they say show me a good
[46:42] loser and I'll show you a loser
[46:44] I bet we don't want to be sore losers
[46:45] but he says you can't lose
[46:48] there's no way of losing
[46:51] why because God had a plan in his heart
[46:55] the threefold purpose of Christ
[46:58] and and this they think of this mystery
[47:00] that God had in his heart so then when
[47:02] Satan does this he says he had out of
[47:05] the treasure chest of his love he had a
[47:07] Plan of Redemption because he said he
[47:09] had it in his heart already
[47:12] God didn't go digging around in the
[47:14] treasure chest and say well how do I
[47:15] deal with Rebellion right he's not like
[47:17] gossip whenever something happens in our
[47:19] home we're like what do you do with this
[47:21] how do you do that I've never heard of
[47:23] this before
[47:24] how do you resp wait you said what I
[47:26] don't even know what to say to that
[47:28] right there's things that we don't know
[47:30] what to do we call upon God for wisdom
[47:31] God help us we get ourselves into
[47:33] situations and what do we ask for wisdom
[47:35] wisdom Lord how should I respond how
[47:37] should I act what's the right thing to
[47:39] do and we TR I trust your travilion that
[47:42] I hope that there's some sort of healthy
[47:44] suspicion of some of our first instincts
[47:47] right until his Instinct becomes first
[47:49] nature now when you say wait a minute is
[47:51] that of the Lord is this right is this
[47:53] scripture but God didn't have to do that
[47:56] he didn't say well I ought to uh you
[47:58] know what never mind let me go back let
[48:00] me cool out time out right
[48:01] Satan you go to your room
[48:04] I'm going to talk about this me and
[48:05] Michael need to talk
[48:08] mother Michael and I are going to
[48:09] discuss this
[48:10] figure out what your punishment's going
[48:12] to be
[48:14] but he doesn't do that he already has a
[48:16] plan
[48:18] so then God only allows something to
[48:22] happen
[48:23] that fits his plan
[48:26] Brothers as all things work together for
[48:27] the good in other words doesn't matter
[48:29] what the ingredients are God won't let
[48:32] anything be put in the mixing bowl that
[48:34] he can't use to make good
[48:37] so as soon as the devil goes to throw
[48:38] something in he'll go no not that
[48:41] double pick
[48:44] gotta say yeah that's fine
[48:46] hey and the devil thinks he got one over
[48:48] on him oh he has no idea and God's other
[48:50] going yeah whatever
[48:51] you have no idea
[48:53] because everything you put in that is an
[48:55] ingredient I can use for good
[48:57] all of it the devil's all they're just
[48:58] dumping things in complexes abuse some
[49:01] scars and this and that and I'm putting
[49:03] it in there God's like
[49:05] yeah okay and there's oh yeah you like
[49:07] that watch this just dumping it all in
[49:09] there and God said and as soon as the
[49:11] devil goes to do something say no
[49:13] you believe God does that for you I hope
[49:16] you do I hope you believe that God's
[49:18] watching out on the ingredients of your
[49:19] life and the ingredients of your spirit
[49:21] and listen this it's the confidence he
[49:23] wants to give us that if he allowed it
[49:25] no matter what it is if he allowed it
[49:26] he's saying if you'll surrender it to me
[49:28] I can use it because nothing happens
[49:30] unless I can use it and the Very things
[49:34] that might be working hard against us
[49:36] are the things that we haven't yet
[49:37] surrendered for him to use
[49:39] Hallelujah he had a plan from the
[49:41] beginning and when Satan did this he
[49:43] says God in his heart already had a Plan
[49:45] of Redemption so look at here in Isaiah
[49:48] 45 5-7 I am the Lord there's none else
[49:51] there's no God beside me I girded Thee
[49:54] thou has not known though thou has not
[49:56] known me
[49:57] that thou may know from the rising of
[49:59] the son and from the West oh my that
[50:01] there is none beside me I am the Lord
[50:04] and there's none else
[50:06] now this speaks
[50:08] of what God allows to fulfill his
[50:10] purpose and plan
[50:12] he says I form the light which means to
[50:15] predestinate or ordain
[50:17] and create Darkness that's the fashion
[50:20] or accomplish it
[50:22] so he says I notice he forms light he
[50:25] predestinates and ordains it but then he
[50:27] uses Darkness
[50:29] I make peace and create evil
[50:33] I the Lord do all these things
[50:35] amen so from this we see and I there's
[50:37] more that we could get into on this and
[50:39] I'm sorry if I keep hinting that I can
[50:41] get deeper man he's the most simple uh
[50:44] preacher we know who's always
[50:46] threatening to go deep
[50:48] hey it's like I just don't have the arm
[50:49] for it you know you know it's like let
[50:51] him do the fly route I'm just going to
[50:52] dump it off to the back on a swing round
[50:55] he says light so now light he forms
[50:58] light and he and he makes peace and the
[51:03] Darkness is created
[51:04] so light and peace these are if I can
[51:06] say this these are his eternal
[51:07] attributes
[51:09] these are Eternal attributes and
[51:12] darkness and evil then are only contrast
[51:14] to his glory
[51:16] now if I could even say this about I the
[51:18] Lord I make peace and create evil it's
[51:21] not it's not moral evil he's talking
[51:23] about
[51:24] he's some of the bad things that happen
[51:27] because it's he's talking about I'm the
[51:29] Lord
[51:30] I form the light and create Darkness I
[51:32] make peace and create evil he says I
[51:34] only allow it to fulfill my purpose
[51:38] but remember in the sermon sir we sir as
[51:40] we would see Jesus God's alone in
[51:41] creation the devil cannot create if you
[51:44] say the devil can heal then you make him
[51:46] a Creator then he's co-equal with God
[51:49] only God Only God Alone can create
[51:53] now this is
[51:56] this is at the heart of understanding
[51:57] what this poison spray is
[51:59] the material that Satan has to work with
[52:01] and how that if that a lie only exists
[52:05] in the context of Truth
[52:07] so he says the devil can only pervert
[52:10] what's already created what is
[52:11] unrighteousness it's righteousness
[52:13] perverted you get it righteousness
[52:15] perverted it's right for man to live to
[52:18] take his wife and be a husband and wife
[52:19] to live that way you know what he's
[52:21] meaning but what some other woman would
[52:23] could do the same act and it would be
[52:25] righteousness perverted which would be
[52:27] sin
[52:28] everything the devil can do is to
[52:30] pervert what God has created you get it
[52:31] so God Alone now he's talking about
[52:33] healing God Alone can develop cells that
[52:36] can heal he's the only healer for he's
[52:39] the only Creator God Alone Is A Healer
[52:45] now this is what strikes me in that God
[52:47] Alone can create the only thing the
[52:49] devil can do is pervert but God's A
[52:52] Healer
[52:54] so he's not going to create sickness
[52:57] but there's an enemy that'll take health
[52:59] and pervert it to sickness and that
[53:01] gives God an opportunity to be a Healer
[53:04] remember how we emphasize that if Adam
[53:07] had only known the Garden of Eden he
[53:09] could have known the creation really
[53:11] really well but he would have never
[53:12] known the Creator very well
[53:14] how do you remained in Eden
[53:17] without a fall there would be so much of
[53:19] God hidden behind the veil all the
[53:21] presence would be nice the fellowship
[53:22] would be sweet but God would be walking
[53:24] with him saying Adam if you only knew
[53:27] if you only knew how much I loved you
[53:30] if you only knew how much you mean to me
[53:31] if you only knew how much this Earth and
[53:34] creation meant to me and the only way
[53:36] the only way that he could ever know how
[53:38] much it meant is if something happened
[53:39] to it
[53:41] right there's people that we think are
[53:43] right we're like this right and then all
[53:46] of a sudden something happens and
[53:47] everybody's running away and like bro
[53:49] what's up
[53:51] hey where are you going this is the time
[53:53] I need your friendship see ya right
[53:55] the kids are saying these days it's kind
[53:57] of a call back you know Sia wouldn't
[53:59] want to beat you especially not in that
[54:01] condition and they're all running out
[54:02] right and you know your true friends are
[54:04] the ones that are running in
[54:05] bumping off all the ones are running
[54:06] away from you what do you need and they
[54:08] want to help you and that's what God
[54:09] wanted to be
[54:10] right he said you know you don't have a
[54:12] clue Adam
[54:13] of all that I am
[54:15] because in this he's saying that God
[54:16] creates Satan perverts and righteousness
[54:19] so evil is good mixed
[54:23] that's how you get evil
[54:25] lost my brother I just couldn't take
[54:27] took these out put them back into about
[54:28] put it again just going back and forth
[54:30] and felt unstable how many times I did
[54:32] it but it says the law in law having a
[54:34] shadow I want you just to catch this God
[54:36] created you to be perfect
[54:38] and Satan perverted you to imperfect
[54:40] God allow you to be your wife's
[54:42] sweetheart legally married but to love
[54:44] someone else is to pervert that true
[54:45] love that you should have for your own
[54:47] wife Satan does that
[54:51] where does it come from Satan does it
[54:53] does he create it no he perverts
[54:56] something
[54:57] he perverts the original in the sermon
[54:59] Faith say Satan perverts what God has
[55:02] made
[55:03] he made you to be a son or daughter to
[55:05] him
[55:06] and Satan perverted you Satan perverts
[55:09] what God has made and he made you to be
[55:10] a son of daughter to him and Satan
[55:12] perverted you
[55:13] changed your way of thinking change your
[55:16] mind change your appetite change your
[55:19] desire
[55:20] so sometimes these very things that
[55:22] maybe we lean on is this is who I am
[55:24] this is my personality oh God if it's
[55:27] not what you want me to be change me
[55:29] because God made me to be a Son of God
[55:31] but it's Satan that perverts my thinking
[55:33] changes my mind my appetite my desire
[55:36] God made me to be perfect but Satan's
[55:39] perverted me to imperfect the reason why
[55:41] I come a sinner the reason why I'm here
[55:42] Satan's done this and enemy's done this
[55:47] Hallelujah I'll try to go quickly in
[55:49] John chapter 9 verses one to three and
[55:52] Jesus passed by he saw a man which was
[55:54] blind from his birth now I want us to
[55:56] relate this to the image of all Humanity
[55:58] the image of us who was to be perfect
[56:00] but we're born imperfect God gave you
[56:02] eyes to see but you're born blind he
[56:04] gave your heart to feel and it's born
[56:05] callous all these different things that
[56:07] maybe we could say about the condition
[56:08] of humanity and notice the response of
[56:11] his disciples verse two master who did
[56:14] Sin this man or his parents that he was
[56:16] born blind all right we want to know why
[56:18] your life's the way that it is and we
[56:20] want to know why because they they have
[56:22] some idea especially in the law of
[56:24] consequence right and sins visiting
[56:26] successive generations and so their
[56:29] thought about this man's blindness is oh
[56:32] what did they do to get cursed
[56:35] so did the did the man did he sin uh
[56:39] he's blind from birth right I mean what
[56:42] kind of Hellion was he in the womb right
[56:44] he's born did this man sin or did his
[56:47] parents they said that he was born blind
[56:51] your question doesn't even make sense
[56:54] did this man sin all right I guess he
[56:56] could speak to by foreknowledge God knew
[56:58] you're going to steal the cookie out of
[56:59] the cookie jar so he smites you blind
[57:00] before you even born
[57:02] and so you break the cookie jar in the
[57:04] process
[57:06] he's trying to steal a cookie he says
[57:08] master who did the did Sin this man or
[57:10] his parents that he was born blind now
[57:12] think about how we rationalize sin we
[57:15] we're all Sinners and we've done this
[57:16] we've done bad and the consequence of
[57:18] sin and Satan's done this and all these
[57:20] things have happened Jesus answer says
[57:22] neither hath this man sinned nor his
[57:25] parents
[57:26] I mean let's not look at his this is a
[57:28] curse
[57:29] he's not blind because of punishment
[57:33] he didn't say anything about us we were
[57:35] born in this world as sinners
[57:37] right because of one man's disobedient
[57:40] sin is passed on we're all Sinners
[57:41] because of the Fall
[57:43] not of our own choice
[57:45] right we're born Sinners we're born uh
[57:48] uh estranged from God we as the Bible
[57:50] says and brother man who brings for
[57:52] different places you know we're strange
[57:53] from the womb and we we comes with the
[57:56] nature to speak lies this is the
[57:58] condition of man when he's born and he's
[58:00] like well was that my fault
[58:02] I mean there there's even people now who
[58:05] are suing their parents because they
[58:06] didn't give consent to be born
[58:11] lawyers
[58:13] but he says this man hasn't sinned nor
[58:15] his parents but that the works of God
[58:18] should be made manifest in him
[58:22] about this for a moment why all the evil
[58:25] why all the sin why does it why is this
[58:28] age as wicked as it is why is there
[58:31] adultery why is there murder why is
[58:33] there hatred why is there jealousy why
[58:36] is there depression an enemy's done this
[58:39] why is there cancer why is there other
[58:42] diabetes and migraines and Crohn's
[58:44] disease why are all these maladies and
[58:46] these sicknesses In the Flesh why are
[58:48] they there an enemy's done this
[58:52] why are there tears in this world
[58:55] when God planted good seed
[58:58] why well the enemy's done this
[59:01] an enemy's done this
[59:03] and then in John 11 after
[59:05] Lazarus had died all your your friends
[59:08] died he's dead and Jesus says this
[59:10] sickness is not unto death
[59:12] this sickness isn't for death
[59:16] but for the glory of God
[59:18] that the Son of God might be glorified
[59:20] thereby
[59:21] are you are you recognizing now can you
[59:23] put the pieces together why is there all
[59:25] this wickedness in the world why are
[59:27] things the way they are well yeah the
[59:28] enemy's done this but God in the
[59:30] beginning had a plan
[59:31] he said well what there's murder and
[59:33] there's malice and there's this and
[59:34] there's that oh yes it's evil it's
[59:36] wickedness but those are all
[59:38] opportunities for the work of God to be
[59:41] made manifest
[59:42] my prayer is where there's hurt where
[59:44] there's a fence where there's woundings
[59:46] where there's betrayal where there's the
[59:48] shedding of blood may have been
[59:50] opportunity for the work of God to be
[59:53] made manifest in me where there's loss
[59:55] may be an opportunity for gain where
[59:58] they're suffering may be an opportunity
[59:59] for Glory this sickness is not unto
[1:00:02] death but that the glory of God might be
[1:00:04] made manifest
[1:00:07] Brother Brad I'm in the sermon I know
[1:00:08] says and remember no matter how great
[1:00:10] the distress is Satan cannot take your
[1:00:13] your life until God is finished with you
[1:00:15] now we believe that right we absolutely
[1:00:18] believe that now let's just back up to
[1:00:20] the billion foot view of creation and he
[1:00:24] says there is nothing can happen to you
[1:00:26] unless God permits it
[1:00:29] there's no evil can come unless God
[1:00:32] permits it
[1:00:34] God could have stopped the iniquity and
[1:00:37] Lucifer's heart in the beginning but God
[1:00:40] permitted it God could have stopped them
[1:00:42] in the garden but God permitted it
[1:00:44] there's a lot of things God could have
[1:00:46] stopped he says and it's for your good
[1:00:49] he's working that he's only allotted for
[1:00:52] his glory he's only allotted for your
[1:00:55] good
[1:00:56] man Hallelujah God in the beginning knew
[1:00:59] exactly what he was doing the devil
[1:01:00] didn't get one over on them
[1:01:02] and God's not counting on his ability to
[1:01:04] make up the the distance in the last the
[1:01:07] last lap
[1:01:09] right all right because remember this
[1:01:10] Satan's racing himself
[1:01:13] God's played it all out there now I'm
[1:01:15] going to read a lengthy statement here
[1:01:16] we're just to write about an hour in
[1:01:18] preaching I want to read this lengthy
[1:01:20] statement because I used all this this
[1:01:22] morning to amplify this statement I
[1:01:24] wanted when we read this statement and
[1:01:26] it's entered into our hearts and we
[1:01:27] understand even if we don't understand
[1:01:29] all the ways that it works we just
[1:01:31] accept the Paradox of this truth that
[1:01:34] this is what God did
[1:01:35] he says but that life you talk about
[1:01:37] eternal life
[1:01:39] that life could not and would not be
[1:01:41] shared with any other than through the
[1:01:43] way of God manifest in the flesh
[1:01:48] remember God reserved that right alone
[1:01:50] to himself Satan wanted it but Satan
[1:01:52] can't do it
[1:01:54] so Satan had to create a hybrid creature
[1:01:56] had to use the serpent and create a
[1:01:57] hybrid that's how the devil enters Into
[1:01:59] the Heart of Judas why because that's
[1:02:01] the fruit of the seat of discrepancy in
[1:02:03] the beginning but God comes to dwell in
[1:02:05] his son because he's the fruit of the
[1:02:07] seed in the beginning of the Tree of
[1:02:09] Life
[1:02:10] and so this is God this modeling that
[1:02:12] brother Brown's showing us that this
[1:02:13] life cannot be shared except through God
[1:02:16] manifest In the Flesh not just a Son of
[1:02:19] God but the Son of God perfectly United
[1:02:23] with his son god with his son he said
[1:02:26] this was part of his eternal and
[1:02:28] predestinated purpose
[1:02:29] this plan which is the thing that God
[1:02:31] had in the beginning when Satan rebelled
[1:02:33] in heaven this plan was to be to the
[1:02:34] praise of the glory of his grace
[1:02:36] it was the Plan of Redemption
[1:02:39] now as we emphasized before it's not
[1:02:41] that Redemption is the goal it's that
[1:02:43] the word cannot be defeated so there
[1:02:45] must be Redemption
[1:02:47] Redemption is an absolute because the
[1:02:49] word cannot fail
[1:02:51] so that's the plan of redemption is not
[1:02:54] that oh I I want to redeem it's like
[1:02:56] what I want I will have therefore no
[1:02:58] matter what happens there's a law of
[1:02:59] redemption that'll bring it back this it
[1:03:02] says it was the Plan of Salvation
[1:03:05] now listen closely
[1:03:08] God being a savior
[1:03:10] it was necessary that he predestinate a
[1:03:13] man who would require salvation
[1:03:16] in order to give himself reason and
[1:03:17] purpose of being
[1:03:19] I know you know this we quote it we
[1:03:21] understand it we believe it but I hope
[1:03:23] that today what we've done is we're just
[1:03:25] placing this piece of the puzzle in this
[1:03:27] much broader picture just this one alone
[1:03:28] this morning it says in a period and
[1:03:30] this isn't the only one this is just the
[1:03:31] way of as we said before
[1:03:34] that I I'm not explaining truth we're
[1:03:36] just making observations about the word
[1:03:38] we're sharing with you what the word has
[1:03:40] already said these things in there and
[1:03:41] the the you you don't want an
[1:03:43] explanation you want the revelation of
[1:03:44] the observation so he says God it was
[1:03:46] necessary to predestin a man that
[1:03:48] required salvation
[1:03:49] being a savior he had to have someone
[1:03:51] who sinned
[1:03:53] in order to satisfy that purpose
[1:03:55] so the nature and character of God
[1:03:57] required that there be a a fall
[1:04:01] he said there's this is he says this is
[1:04:03] 100 correct
[1:04:06] and multitudes of scriptures bear it out
[1:04:08] as does the very pointed verse of Romans
[1:04:10] 11 36 I'm telling you this is the way
[1:04:13] the brother bam uses this blows my mind
[1:04:16] for of him and through him and to him
[1:04:18] are all things
[1:04:20] to whom be glory forever amen
[1:04:23] and this verse supports the proposition
[1:04:26] that God being a savior it was necessary
[1:04:29] that man be a sinner
[1:04:31] because it was for him through him and
[1:04:33] to him are all things to give him glory
[1:04:36] to whom be glory forever amen he says
[1:04:39] man could not directly come in partake
[1:04:42] of that tree of life in the midst of the
[1:04:44] garden
[1:04:45] in other words God would not permit it
[1:04:47] that eternal life of the tree had to
[1:04:51] become flesh first
[1:04:53] so when God said in the beginning bar
[1:04:55] the way to the tree of lifeless man
[1:04:56] partake of it he says because I I have
[1:04:59] this has to come in flesh first
[1:05:02] but before God could raise and save a
[1:05:04] sinner
[1:05:05] he had to have a sinner to raise and
[1:05:06] Save
[1:05:07] man had to fall
[1:05:11] the fall which would be caused by Satan
[1:05:14] had to have flesh to make fall
[1:05:16] Satan had to come through flesh also
[1:05:19] but Satan could not come through human
[1:05:21] flesh to make the fall as would Christ
[1:05:24] come in human flesh to restore the
[1:05:25] Fallen
[1:05:28] but there was an animal the serpent so
[1:05:29] close to man that Satan could get to
[1:05:31] that beast and through the Beast he
[1:05:33] could get to the human flesh and cause
[1:05:34] the fall
[1:05:36] and inject himself thereby into the
[1:05:38] human race
[1:05:40] That's what Satan does in the beginning
[1:05:42] then even as Jesus would one day come
[1:05:46] and inject himself into the human race
[1:05:49] into human bodies even to the extent of
[1:05:52] a resurrection wherein we would have
[1:05:53] bodies like unto his glorified one
[1:05:57] thus what God worked out here in the
[1:06:01] garden was his predestinated plan
[1:06:05] God had a plan
[1:06:07] I'm gonna deal with this I'm going to
[1:06:10] address this I and and this the and I I
[1:06:14] guess I'll say this
[1:06:16] because we're wanting to look and I
[1:06:17] think some of you've been doing this
[1:06:18] studying the sermon future home and
[1:06:21] listening to what brother Bama had to
[1:06:22] say in that sermon about the Earth being
[1:06:24] renewed and being an eternal attribute
[1:06:26] of God and that we're going to live and
[1:06:28] Reign on this Earth forever in the
[1:06:29] Eighth Day good the New Jerusalem is
[1:06:31] going to come back and settle on this
[1:06:32] renewed Earth and the annihilation is
[1:06:34] not like what we think Annihilation is
[1:06:35] why because purpose original
[1:06:39] right and everything that's going to be
[1:06:40] destroyed is a lie in anything that
[1:06:41] offends and so there this is I'll just
[1:06:44] kind of solve this seed out there that's
[1:06:45] why hell cannot be eternal
[1:06:48] and so now when God has created aloud to
[1:06:51] this to happen he said what he worked
[1:06:53] out in the garden was his predestinated
[1:06:55] plan and when Satan had brought about
[1:06:57] that which was necessary to the purpose
[1:06:59] of God
[1:07:01] then man could not get to the Tree of
[1:07:03] Life In The Garden he says certainly not
[1:07:05] it wasn't time
[1:07:09] Satan did what God when Satan worked out
[1:07:12] that which was necessary
[1:07:15] I hope you can recognize this in the
[1:07:17] scripture in the word of God now if I
[1:07:19] could just fast forward for a moment
[1:07:21] it was then that Satan works out now
[1:07:23] which is necessary in the Garden of Eden
[1:07:26] and then now think about Christ because
[1:07:28] he brought death on creation and now
[1:07:31] here's Christ who under the threat of
[1:07:33] death
[1:07:34] is trying to be is trying to uh forfeit
[1:07:37] his sonship
[1:07:40] and then we if I could say this on the
[1:07:43] cross Satan worked out that which was
[1:07:45] necessary
[1:07:47] because Jesus said to the pilot a pilot
[1:07:50] says in John 19 uh speak thou not unto
[1:07:53] me you know he's keeping his mouth shut
[1:07:55] no it's not thou not that I have power
[1:07:57] to crucify thee and a power to release
[1:07:59] thee
[1:08:01] and Jesus answered
[1:08:03] there could be no you could not have any
[1:08:05] power at all against me
[1:08:08] except that we're given thee from above
[1:08:12] did not say all power is given into my
[1:08:15] hands John 17 he has this power it's in
[1:08:18] his hands and so he's saying ah you say
[1:08:21] you have power to crucify me but he says
[1:08:23] you could have no power against me
[1:08:25] except it be given from above
[1:08:28] and isn't it beautiful that Jesus had to
[1:08:30] exercise self-will to accept God's plan
[1:08:34] he had to use and and win the battle and
[1:08:37] the mind and accept not my will be done
[1:08:39] but thy will be done to win the battle
[1:08:42] of the will to win the battle that was
[1:08:44] in heaven he's now wanted on Earth there
[1:08:47] and the dark chaotic time there in the
[1:08:50] garden but remember he said the spirit
[1:08:51] of God had left him there he is he's
[1:08:53] wrestling it out in that Humanity he's
[1:08:55] wrestling out within himself and he's
[1:08:57] saying no I will take God's way
[1:09:02] and so he could stand there before
[1:09:04] Pilate and say you don't have power to
[1:09:07] take my life I've got power to lay it
[1:09:09] down and take it up again and that power
[1:09:11] has been given to me by God so you
[1:09:13] exercise no power then that which God
[1:09:16] will allow to fulfill his great purpose
[1:09:18] so even in the death burial and
[1:09:20] resurrection of Jesus Christ when Satan
[1:09:22] had done that which was necessary for
[1:09:25] the plan of God
[1:09:26] why the Jews have a saying strength from
[1:09:28] below strength from the earth depends
[1:09:30] upon the strength from above
[1:09:33] it could have no strength except the
[1:09:35] heavens allow it
[1:09:38] so Isaiah 45 8.
[1:09:40] drop down ye heavens
[1:09:43] from above
[1:09:45] let the skies pour down righteousness
[1:09:48] go ahead musicians if you could come now
[1:09:51] and then notice this
[1:09:52] Heavens Heaven's opening up
[1:09:54] and righteousness has fallen this is let
[1:09:56] Earth open
[1:09:58] these are the seeds already sown into
[1:10:00] the Earth and let them bring forth
[1:10:01] salvation
[1:10:03] who are they them having an earth
[1:10:05] working together
[1:10:06] this this is redemption let
[1:10:08] righteousness spring up together I the
[1:10:11] Lord have created it
[1:10:15] Satan has deformed
[1:10:17] the world
[1:10:19] into his own Eden
[1:10:22] enter Eden of chaos and Eden of death
[1:10:25] and he's he's walking upon it now saying
[1:10:28] this is my creation
[1:10:31] this is what I have done
[1:10:33] and he's brought it right back into the
[1:10:36] state it was in the beginning
[1:10:39] without form and void Darkness upon the
[1:10:42] face of the deep we say oh no no no this
[1:10:43] is look at this is the glory of laodicea
[1:10:45] this is the most powerful the humanities
[1:10:47] ever been this look at the science look
[1:10:49] at the advancements but it is the
[1:10:51] brother bam takes it Genesis 1 in
[1:10:54] Revelations 3.
[1:10:56] takes the condition of man in Genesis 3
[1:10:58] and goes to Revelations 3. he's saying
[1:11:00] look at this naked blind naked wretched
[1:11:03] miserable don't know it
[1:11:04] darkness is upon the face of the Earth
[1:11:07] the Bible says in your Earth was without
[1:11:08] form I want you to catch this image of
[1:11:10] Eden the the Earth was without form and
[1:11:12] void Darkness was upon the face of the
[1:11:14] deep
[1:11:15] and the spirit of God moved upon the
[1:11:17] face of the waters every seed is already
[1:11:18] laying out there
[1:11:20] and it says he says and God said let
[1:11:24] there be light
[1:11:25] and there was light
[1:11:27] what the Mist
[1:11:29] the fog darkness is separate and God saw
[1:11:33] the light that it was good
[1:11:34] and God divided the light from the
[1:11:37] darkness
[1:11:38] and I just began to meditate on this
[1:11:40] last week how their Satan in darkness
[1:11:43] and chaos and also in the Wind
[1:11:47] and maybe the wind is moving and the
[1:11:49] Earth is shaking and there's things that
[1:11:52] are belching and then God speaks with a
[1:11:54] still Small Voice and light comes and
[1:11:57] Satan is watching everything transform
[1:11:58] around him
[1:12:00] and here he is moving to and fro maybe
[1:12:03] walking about even on the stones of fire
[1:12:05] upon the Earth in this molten lava and
[1:12:07] this chaos and this murky mod upon the
[1:12:10] Earth and nothing without distinction
[1:12:11] and now the light is coming in Satan is
[1:12:14] witnessing all this and as it's been
[1:12:15] created he's there dwelling in this as
[1:12:18] the Earth is being formed and light is
[1:12:20] coming from he's dwelling in this
[1:12:21] darkness and brother Bradham says in the
[1:12:24] rising of the Sun God had a reason to do
[1:12:26] that
[1:12:26] for down beneath the water there were
[1:12:29] seed that he had planted and it had to
[1:12:32] have that sunlight to live
[1:12:34] God had placed the seeds there in the
[1:12:36] earth and no matter how much Satan was
[1:12:38] there say no I want the chaos I want the
[1:12:41] darkness the demons love this this is
[1:12:43] what we like he knew God was speaking
[1:12:45] and there was nothing Satan could do to
[1:12:48] keep those seeds from coming forth there
[1:12:51] was nothing he can do to stop the spoken
[1:12:53] word from manifesting then and there's
[1:12:56] nothing he can do now to stop it from
[1:12:59] manifesting even though this may be his
[1:13:02] Eden just as he couldn't stop it in
[1:13:04] Genesis 1. he cannot stop it in the end
[1:13:07] brother Madam said and I believe that we
[1:13:09] are now living in that hour again that
[1:13:11] when God is separating light from
[1:13:13] darkness and he's pressing it to the
[1:13:16] other side of the world that the light
[1:13:18] may be manifested
[1:13:20] that's what God is doing and again it's
[1:13:23] the word of God say let there be light
[1:13:25] and where is the light you're holding it
[1:13:28] the seed has already been sown into the
[1:13:30] Earth and God is driving away by his
[1:13:32] word all the Mist all the darkness all
[1:13:36] the scars all the chaos he said come out
[1:13:38] of her come out of her I say Lord let
[1:13:40] this Earth open up let this Earth open
[1:13:43] up and let righteousness come from it
[1:13:48] let there let the skies pour down and
[1:13:51] the former Lottery Let it bring down let
[1:13:53] this Earth open up
[1:13:56] brother Branham says in this Fellowship
[1:13:58] by Redemption
[1:14:00] I they didn't use these slides
[1:14:03] but this is such a beautiful if you
[1:14:05] could just maybe focus on the words now
[1:14:08] he says when God made the first man
[1:14:10] he made the heavens and earth
[1:14:13] and when God stood back on the old
[1:14:15] creation and looked at it
[1:14:17] he didn't look upon it to judge it
[1:14:20] he looked upon it if I could even
[1:14:21] interject this this is me
[1:14:23] speaking for those who are listening on
[1:14:25] the podcast
[1:14:26] brother brother bear says he's looking
[1:14:29] at it
[1:14:30] God knew what what it would be
[1:14:32] he knew what would happen
[1:14:34] right and yet he doesn't judge it
[1:14:38] he says it's good
[1:14:39] he looked upon and said how good it is
[1:14:41] he admired it oh my
[1:14:43] you see it he looked and saw how good it
[1:14:46] was everything was perfect the trees and
[1:14:48] every the man of the woman it was all
[1:14:50] perfect
[1:14:52] and then he says it's very good
[1:14:56] but now Satan perverted that
[1:15:00] remember how we read the statement when
[1:15:01] brother Brown said you can't lose
[1:15:05] the God works all things together for
[1:15:06] good you can't lose
[1:15:08] he says Satan perverted that
[1:15:11] but if God could not condemn his first
[1:15:13] creation
[1:15:15] how much more is it impossible
[1:15:18] for him to condemn his second creation
[1:15:21] when you are created Anew in Christ
[1:15:23] Jesus
[1:15:25] Hallelujah if God would not condemn the
[1:15:28] first creation but he had a plan
[1:15:31] immediately to redeem it I believe God
[1:15:33] wants to Anchor you so deep in his love
[1:15:35] that as New Creations in Christ Jesus
[1:15:38] you will not live in fear you will not
[1:15:40] live in doubt that you will let these
[1:15:42] poison seeds of unbelief and doubt and
[1:15:45] say I have been inoculated against the
[1:15:47] spray if God would not condemn the first
[1:15:50] creation would he not preserve you
[1:15:54] those of the new creation
[1:15:56] those of you who are one as Christ was
[1:15:58] one
[1:15:59] oh Hallelujah God you're redeeming Me
[1:16:03] Lord
[1:16:04] just as you did the Earth
[1:16:06] just as you did not forsake the first
[1:16:08] creation but you had a plan I was a part
[1:16:10] of that plan all along and I believe you
[1:16:12] can have confidence today that no matter
[1:16:13] how ugly this world gets and no matter
[1:16:15] how bad your life may seem God has a
[1:16:18] plan of redemption for you
[1:16:20] you must you must anchor yourself in
[1:16:23] that you must believe that
[1:16:26] no matter what it is hey if I could if I
[1:16:29] could write this down and give it to you
[1:16:30] to say to me I need it this morning that
[1:16:32] I could look in the face of things and
[1:16:34] look right at the ugliest thing I could
[1:16:36] possibly think of and say Lord even in
[1:16:38] this there's good
[1:16:40] even in this hurt even in this pain even
[1:16:42] in this disagreement even in this uh the
[1:16:45] backsliding the Rebellion even in the
[1:16:47] separation even in the harm that I don't
[1:16:49] have to conjure up well this is the way
[1:16:51] that it has to end to be good I don't
[1:16:52] need to try to figure out my own ending
[1:16:56] listen as we read it brother Brown says
[1:16:58] well couldn't have God bypassed all of
[1:16:59] this
[1:17:00] could you imagine the disciples saying
[1:17:02] ha you sowed the Masters labor say well
[1:17:05] we know you sowed good seed what are
[1:17:07] with all the tears and they find out he
[1:17:10] allowed that
[1:17:11] what I'm not working for him anymore
[1:17:14] right like the but you have to recognize
[1:17:16] it God knows what he's doing
[1:17:18] so we read in Isaiah you're the one
[1:17:20] that's formed are you going to argue
[1:17:21] with him are you the one that's going to
[1:17:23] form say to the maker you have no hands
[1:17:26] it's about trusting God and we can come
[1:17:28] to the place to believe that I know I
[1:17:31] know is his son I know as his daughter
[1:17:34] that though if I hurt though if I'm
[1:17:37] rejected though if I'm sick it doesn't
[1:17:40] matter in the face of anything the devil
[1:17:42] can do God will only allow us to fulfill
[1:17:44] his purpose God will use it for good and
[1:17:48] be able to look in the face of anything
[1:17:49] and say I will serve God until the very
[1:17:53] end I will trust him into the Varian
[1:17:55] well what if it ends this way what if it
[1:17:58] ends that way God's the one that looks
[1:17:59] out after the end to be sure that it
[1:18:02] delivers what he desires and therefore I
[1:18:05] will live it until the end whatever that
[1:18:08] end may be
[1:18:10] conduct myself appropriately knowing
[1:18:13] knowing that God has a plan
[1:18:16] oh Hallelujah
[1:18:18] could you rise with me today
