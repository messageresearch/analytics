TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I'm going to conclude on the subject we started Sunday morning on unshakable and just bear with me as we reviewed just a little bit from Sunday I want to go back through Hebrews chapter 12 just a little bit add some more scriptures uh that we didn't get to on Sunday and I want this to kind of serve as a lead into going into Kingdom Life and in particular order and character and just not sure how we might break it up but I think there's a lot of things that are applicable to daily life even as Paul references how that we receive in a kingdom let's serve God acceptably let's do it right and let's do it with Godly reverence and a Godly fear so there's just a lot there for us to take into consideration and if you could just look at verse 22 there in Hebrews chapter 12 I don't have much to cover tonight just a little bit to kind of capture the feeling and some of the prophecies in Hebrews 12 and then come back to the unshakable nature that we're to have as being a part of this Kingdom and contrasting with Mount Sinai as he called it a terrible Mountain where they had come in Exodus 9 19 into Blackness and darkness and Tempest and and kind of the even as you continue in those chapters there in Exodus it arrives at God's judgment upon them but he's saying we haven't come to Mount Sinai but Mount Zion in verse 22 but year come unto Mount Zion and a note spelled maybe a little bit differently in the New Testament but this is Mount Zion and unto the city of the Living God the heavenly Jerusalem and to an innumerable company of angels to the general assembly in the Church of the firstborn which are written in heaven and you can see how that speaks of the body of Christ it speaks of that church that Jesus said that he would have that the Gates of Hell could not Prevail against it once it's founded upon the revelation of Jesus Christ and to God the judge of all and to the spirits of just men made perfect and to Jesus the mediator of the New Covenant and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of Abel he's saying you've come to the kingdom this is what he's describing all these different elements when it refers to Mount Zion that city of David the city of God there is all these different elements he starts referring to or just a way of him trying to describe something that's very very vast and in a lot of ways if I could say this summarize kind of the things he's been driving home through the first 12 chapters and 11 chapters and now he's kind of saying this is what we've come to and all these different things that kind of fit into it and tie into it you've come to the kingdom and the kingdom God of God we know is the word of God living in flesh the kingdom is made spirit and life in you and I so Paul's not just wanting them to think of a physical Mountain he's wanting them to think of a spiritual sense you haven't come to Mount Sinai that you couldn't touch but you're coming to something that is the kingdom of God that you are a part of and if I could even put it this way as you turn to Exodus chapter 19. he's saying you haven't come to Mount Sinai as a physical Mountain but you've come to the promise of Mount Sinai it was that it was at Mount Sinai that the law was given which pointed to Christ now Mount Sinai says I'll make you a peculiar treasure from out of the earth and I'll make you a kingdom I'm unto me it says in Exodus 19 5-6 now therefore if you will obey my voice indeed and keep my Covenant then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people for all the Earth is mine there's going to be a people that are a treasure out of the earth and ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation this is what Peter and the writers in the New Testament pick up on includes the Gentiles it's not just the Jews that you are a peculiar people you're a holy people a royal people a treasure these are the words which Thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel this is the prophecy that goes forth at Mount Sinai this is what Paul is wanting them to think about in type now Mount Sinai foreshadowed this great kingdom of God that now we've come to and we know that Mount Zion is of the city of God it says it right in there Mount Zion the city of the Living God it is the Heavenly Jerusalem mentioned it before that Paul sees it here at the beginning John sees it finished it coming down out of Heaven from God and this city as we've emphasized many times before represents the bride we'll set on Sunday Daughter of Zion refers to the rightful citizens of Zion even The Heirs The Joint heirs with the Messiah as they saw themselves as the daughters of Zion they would be related to the Messiah they would have this kinship and and reign with the Messiah in Psalm 78 verses 68 and 69 it says but choose but this is God but I chose the tribe of Judah the Mount Zion the Mount Zion which he loved think of that he chose the tribe of Judah the Mount Zion which he loved and he built his Sanctuary like high palaces like the Earth which he had established forever this is God's attitude towards Zion so when there's a reference to Mount Zion this is a very special place a lot of other significant mountains Mount Carmel Mount Transfiguration Mount Sinai a lot of other places where we see mountaintops but now there is this Mount Zion which signifies something climactic about God's desire it's the climax of The Kingdom you've come to Mount Zion Mount Zion which God loves and he built this Sanctuary like high palaces like the Earth which he hath established forever there's a another reminder that there's something about this Earth that'll be forever and then in Psalms 87 verses one to seven again just kind of bear with me as they We Lay this Foundation again from Hebrews 12 I believe we read this earlier this year it says a Psalm or song for the sons of Korah his foundation is in the Holy mountains the Lord loveth the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob this is God's attitude towards this Mount he loves the gates of Zion more than any other dwelling this holy city they call it the city of the Living God the Mount of God because this is a special place that God loves it says glorious things are spoken of the O City of God say Lord this is Zion again o city of God I will make mention of Rahab in Babylon to them that know me behold Felicity and tirey with Ethiopia this man was born there talking about Zion and of Zion it shall be said this and that man was born in her and the highest himself shall establish her this is this is incredible language I'm just going over very quickly tonight because we don't want to be long and it's it ought to get us to be thinking about how special of a designation it is to refer to Zion and even if we made this a very literal place and those that are actually born in Zion will be regarded as oh wow this man was born there and all Miami established this city well whatever it pertains to the Natural you are the Fulfillment of it in the spiritual and we use this uh in the past and maybe it was in a different series on our family tree how there's something about this place as it continues to write this man was born in her and we all ought to have this representation in the body of Christ not that we go to church that we've been born into the body of Christ the highest himself shall establish her the Lord shall count when he rideth up the people that this man was born there say long this is this is the body of Christ you have to be born into it this is the roll call in heaven the names written in the Lamb's Book of Life the Lord shall count who is he going to count those who have been born into the body of Christ those whose names are written in the Lamb's Book of Life and so Zion is God's dwelling it is his body it is his dwelling place it's a place that he loves above all other dwellings of Jacob and Paul as he's writing this that you've come not to a mount that might be touched and that burned with fire and Blackness and darkness and Tempest but you've come to Mount Zion if we could look at it in the sense that Paul has come to the base of it and is beholding it all from the base and look it up and saying this is what we've come to we've arrived at the Prophecies of the Old Testament we've come to that thing that has been spoken of before that the kingdom would come and that God would establish his presence in his people he says you've arrived at the base of Mount Zion at the foundation of the beginning the body of Christ even is in Exodus 19 had they traveled to the Mount Sinai they were at the base but they couldn't go to the top but it was at the top of the mountain that God came down and as it reads in verse 28 of Hebrews 12 we skip to this part and we'll come back to verse 25 here in a second just so you can see that this is this is the kingdom wherefore we receive in a kingdom which cannot be moved this is what he says Mount Zion is it's a kingdom that cannot be moved let us have Grace whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear for our God is a consuming fire that fire came down at the top of Mount Sinai there's something about these showdowns whether it be Mount Carmel Mount Transfiguration if you want to look at Mount Sinai in view too in this Mount Zion it's not the base where the activity happens it's at the top it's at the peak where the the fire came down and God was a consuming fire at the top of that mountain in Mount Sinai and Paul is seeing this in type in an image you've come to a kingdom so let us serve god with reverence and godly fear for our God is a consuming fire as he said you've come to Mount Zion the city of God and he begins to describe these elements into Jesus the media to the New Covenant he's introducing Mount Zion Christ as the foundation and as he introduces it he also prophesies of the finishing of the completion of Mount Zion so if you look at verse 25 I hope I'm not going too fast for you I apologize if my my pacing isn't just right in verse 25 it says see that you refuse not him that speaketh for if they escape not who refused him that spake on Earth much more shall not we escape if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven and and I'll say this now that what one of the things that Drew me to this is how that in Isaiah chapter 4 it says and it shall come to pass that he that is left in Zion and he that remaineth in Jerusalem Shall be Called holy and everyone that is written among the living in Jerusalem and it's speaking of those who have escaped the judgments those that have escaped the Wrath those that have escaped from the the times that are being mentioned of hear it even in the chapter three I've been drawing more from chapter three than I have chapter four and how there's there's this image of a Daughter of Zion that's judged but then there's those that have escaped and and the image that was before me is how you have Revelation 17 Revelations 18 and it's this beautiful church this powerful church and God calls the people out of it that they might escape the plagues that are coming down upon it and this woman that claims to be the Church of God God's going to judge her and there's going to be judgments upon her but there's a people that is the bride because God's calling a bride out of the church they're the ones that escape and as there is a voice that calls the bride out of Babylon it's that same voice that pronounces the Judgment upon it and here we have them saying that if you refuse The Voice How Can You Escape and there's there's just something that has impressed me about the end times and this message of the hour and I'm realizing now I took some scriptures out later in the day to where the with the voice of thundering and the voice of lightning the shaking of the earth and all these symbols that we see in under the open of the word and the open of the seals and the very same image that's coming up in the message of the hour verse 26 whose voice then shook the Earth so there on Mount Sinai it shook the Earth but now he hath promised saying yet once more I shake not the Earth only but also heaven and the language he's using uh you could use you see this here in a moment that there's there's some application to the Messiah making himself known in that day and that time but there's a forward-looking promise of this and shaking up the Earth only but also heaven and this word yet once more signify the removing of those things that are shaken once more again it's going to come again there's things going to be shaken that it's going to be shaken again so he's using this language to say that once more there's going to be a shaking and this word yet once more signify the removing of those things that are shaken as of things that are made that those things which cannot be shaken May remain it's going to be a blasting fourth there's going to be winds that that goal if whether you want to look at it the whether it be the Breath of God or the judgments of God or storms or agitation even as God says I'm going to send a strong delusion I'm going to allow things to come and it's going to shake those who can be shaken there's going to be an agitating causing people to teeter-totter it's going to be a shaking down there's going to be an overthrowing there's going to be people that are cast down and agitated and Disturbed but that's the the tearing down of those things that are made that the things that cannot be shaken remain in and whether we want to accept it or not I think this would be helpful for some of us maybe to look at it this way the agitation that takes place in our lives and the stirring and the teetering that's taking place that's God's way of getting all the things that have been made out of you so that the things that are perfect will remain and we're put into The Crucible sometimes and we're put on The Potter's Wheel and we go through difficulties and we go through uh tribulation and we go through Temptation and we go through great sorrows and testings but listen we've got to have that anchor that tells us I'm a Son of God I'm a daughter of God and nothing's going to change that and he's committed to me to see that I'll come forth tried but as pure gold and so there'll be a shaking so that the things that can be shaken will be shaken and when I am trying I'll come forth purged cleansed and whole he's Paul is speaking of how a voice shook the Earth and a voice shook the Earth when the law was given at Mount Sinai but if I could put it this way another Mount voice is going to shake again it's going to be a blast to go forth it's going to be the voice of God in the end times and it's going to cause a shaking in Earth and in heaven and Paul is drawing from haggai chapter 2 if you could turn there with me to haggai chapter 2 verses 20 to 23. it says again the word of the Lord came unto haggai and the four and 20th day of the month saying Speak to zerubulo governor of Judah now this is a type of Christ and there is an image of Christ that's in this and even the Jews and even the the teachers and their oral tradition they they seize the ruble as a type of the Messiah we see Christ being typified typified here speak to zerubbabel governor of Judah saying I will shake the heavens and the Earth you can see how Paul is using this very language I will shake the heavens and the Earth I will overthrow the Throne of Kingdoms I will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the heathen and I will overthrow the Chariots and those that ride in them and the horses and the writers shall come down Everyone by the sword of his brother now this is the this is the image the prophetic image that Paul is drawing from when he says once more I shake not the Earth only but also heaven and when he comes when he speaks of that he's he's hearkening to haggai chapter 2 verses 20 to 23 and to Hebrew this would have been something that hopefully they would have had in their minds that oh he's going to speak and when he speaks it's going to shake heavens and earth and it's going to overthrow kingdoms it's going to overthrow powers and there's there's a way that you can actually they say that you can break this up and recognize these different kingdoms the kingdom of the Heathen the Chariots the horse and writers and they'll try to break it up historically how there's been an overthrowing of these Kings and there's different ways that they could overlay this I I think some of that's fun to do but for this for these purposes I want you to recognize that Paul is pointing to a prophecy of the Old Testament bringing it Forward into the New Testament and as he says I'm going to shake uh Heaven and Earth that the things that can be shaken will be shaken the kingdoms of that they would have thought of Kingdoms the Throne of the Throne of Kingdoms and the strength of Kingdoms of the Heathen and their chair and those that ride them and the horses and the writers and everyone the sword of his brother that they would have thought of these kingdoms being destroyed so then when he gets to verse 28 says but you're part of a kingdom that's not going to be destroyed so they would have been thinking about heathen kingdoms worldly kingdoms the things of this world and in that day saith the Lord of hosts I will take the osiruba my servant the son of shittil saith the Lord and will make thee as a Signet this is a ring as a seal so this is this is a this is a ceiling this is a sign I have for I have chosen the saith the Lord of hosts and zerubbable is Christ the Messiah King this is who's spoken of here and this prophecy in haggai too is that all worldly kingdoms must be overthrown and Christ it's even spoken Christ says it himself in John chapter 12 31 now is the Judgment of this world now the prince of this world is cast out so he was using he was putting himself in the very language of haggai that this is what the Messiah is to do that I am I'm coming and by my death burial and Resurrection there's going to be a price paid there's going to be a loosening from the the chains of sin the price paid for the elect that they might be free from that spiritual bondage so we see this in Christ the Messiah that all worldly kingdoms must be torn down and the kingdom of God must prevail I was thinking about the word how brother Branham is using preeminence preeminence and and it has it has a royal Regal sound to it and that his eminence it would speak of one who's in royal power this the most Sovereign and Christ is to be preeminent and it's bringing into view the kingdom Christ is Mystery God revealed his centering us on the fact that this is the kingdom the headship declares that the king is here and so there is a the kingdom of God here must Prevail the Throne of Kingdoms of this world the strength of the kingdoms of the heathen they're all going to be tore down now this isn't necessarily happening in just an instant in a moment they're all banished because here we are in the time that we're living in now and we're living in an age that Satan would have showed Christ and said I'll give it to you if you'll worship me now I'm gonna try to swing here with this momentum as a type of Christ I hope that some of you been listening to a reading future home and I don't know how many times I've hinted at that uh but someone here recently told me that they just started reading it and listening to us like Well there must be a you know a certain uh tipping point where if you hit added enough and we know that one of the things that brother Brown has to me the uh the main theme of that that brother Brown keeps identifying is whatever God does to the Earth he's done to the individual and whether or not you we could look at it this way say oh well I'm Justified Sanctified sealed with the Holy Ghost and we see that type in The Believer brother Brahm is dropping down and showing that we can see the same things happening uh to the Earth and and this is a some of the stages of the earth it wasn't new theology to brother Branham but he takes some of the things that had been before and he actually places them correctly to see where the actual stages of the earth were and how it received what we received now if you could think of that for a moment what God does to the Earth he doesn't type to the believer and to the bride and then we have here in haggai a prophecy that I will overthrow the Throne of Kingdoms I will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the Heathen I will overthrow the Chariots and those that ride in them and the horses and the Riders shall come down Everyone by the sword of his brother if there's going to be a tearing down of Kingdoms upon the face of the Earth in only one remain then we have a promise that even in our lives every Kingdom can be destroyed every stronghold anything that's contrary any Veil that we've built up in our heart any partition between us and Christ that that ought to be our desire that that was at the heart and if it took me this long to finally say it but that was at the heart of the perfect love series I was on is I was realizing that I that the perfect love that I want to attain to is when he has my whole heart that there's just nothing between he and I there's nothing hidden there's nothing I'm hiding there's no pretense in my life but that he has my whole heart is a type of Christ of the Messiah and according to haggai and the book of Hebrews he is to shake and there's destructive power in this shaking the voice is going to thunder forth there's going to be a separating out there's going to be a destruction as it says I will overthrow kingdoms and the strength of Kingdoms and chariots and those that write in them this is the prophecy obserubbabel and the Very word zerubba will mean sown in Babylon again we see that image of the the Gentile bride the word to be sown into the hearts of a gentile bride Christ hid in a gentile woman Christ manifested in a gentile bride and this is Aruba which we see Christ the word as it's going to uh separate and destroy all that offends as we see that image in the parable of the tears and the Sea the seed that is song that I'm going to separate out all the worldly kingdoms I'm going to separate all the tears I'm going to bind them together there's going to be a purging so the wheat stands on its own as we've said before the same word that judges destroys separates binds together is the same word that heals restores perfects completes and and that's one of the reasons why we took the time in the devil's life and the truth of God is there's there's parts of the word of God that are judging judging the false church and and it's and if we are if we receive our judgment and we repent then there's a message for those who continue I didn't come to it but one thing that's remarkable to me in the scripture is when God judges and kadus barnia and numbers 14 he judges him and says those of a certain age you won't go into the promised land except Joshua and Caleb and says you're all going to die in the wilderness and then the very next chapter he says speak unto the children of Israel that when you go into the promised land in other words that message wasn't to those who were going to die in the wilderness it was to the generation that was going to possess the promise and so God is going to speak to those who can possess the promise once the judgments get given to those who can't pertain to it God's not going to shut his mouth and have you exist under this judgment message and this condemning and oh I guess we're all condemned and oh I guess the door is shut no there's a message to those who can receive it of life to the bride and so there's a there's a message that judges and separates and destroys but there's the same message that completes and perfects and finishes and heals and in the Bible zerubbable is the one that led the Jews out of Babylon and then laid the foundation of the temple now that that I've been studying on the temple and because I think it just fits so perfectly in the subject of the kingdom and in this image of the Tabernacle in the temple you can see Christ and his bride Heaven and Earth and so there's an image of king and queen in there and the bride in this Temple and so zerubbabel leads Jews out of Babylon and he lays the foundation of the temples and the Book of haggai that we read that God is saying what have you done you laid the foundation but now you haven't done anything else you haven't finished it so zerubbabel lays the foundation Christ is that Foundation Christ in his first coming that we see the foundation and the Cornerstone of Mount Zion doesn't just lay the foundation and in Zechariah Chapter 4 verses 7 to 10 I love it when the people listening are already way ahead of you and they're thinking we were wondering when when in the world you'd get to Zachariah but Zechariah Chapter 4 verses 7 8 9 and 10. it says then he answered and spoken to me saying this is the word of the Lord undeserable now remember in haggai he's gonna I'm going to shake the heavens on the earth I'm going to overthrow and durable is going to be a Signet he's going to be a seal and so this is a tearing down but notice this other side to it though this is the word of Lord undeservable saying not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the Lord of hosts and his word is spirit in his life what art thou o great Mountain and this is this is the worldly kingdoms these are the kingdoms of this world oh great Mountain before is Aruba Thou shalt become a plane and there's going to be a leveling out there's going to be a destroying and a tearing down and he shall bring forth The Headstone thereof with shoutings crying Grace Grace undo it now there should be so many things from the message that would just pop uh when we read that The Headstone the Capstone crying Grace Grace moreover the word of the Lord came unto me saying the hands of zeruba will have laid the foundation of this house his hands shall also finish it so the very one Christ who is the beginner the author of the Christian faith and he'll come in the end time and be the Perfecter of it he's going to be the finisher of it he said that this one who laid the foundation will finish it and thou shalt know that the Lord of hosts has sent me unto you for who hath despise the day of small things that's quite a statement as the pyramid is built up to its finishing there's a lot less work that goes on a lot of work is done in the lane of the foundation even the pre uh foundation work to dig things out and put in Footers and put in the plumbing and electrical and everything goes in and you lay the foundation and some of your greatest expense is in the very beginning and your hardest work and as it comes down to Perfection and finishing up into that final move and it's just maybe a piece of tape here a little bit of finish work there it may be small things but it's the perfecting I says who hath despise the day of small things for they shall rejoice and shall see the plummet that's the Plumb line that which is used to measure height and and depth is a measuring line which we know for the believer the only Plumb line is the word of God it's the only Plumb line we have we shall see the plummet in the hand of zeruble with those seven and they are the eyes of the Lord which run to and fro through the whole Earth if you come into the church ages in the Book of Revelation you'll see in these words an image of Christ in his bride but notice it's zerubbabel which is Christ with those seven it's a figure of Christ out together with the messengers to the church you have seven Messengers to the church but then remember the last Messenger to the church is the life messenger the Lord Jesus Christ himself is the one who has in his hand the measuring line the measuring stick the word of God therefore we see then as Paul is prophesying of Mount Zion and maybe there's a broad Foundation as the body of Christ is built up it gets narrower and narrower to the top remember as it gets narrower and narrower there's a certain way you have to walk certain way you have to live certain narrowing down I think you could think of those different statements that brother banham refers to that brother Bradham says this and God's only provided place of worship he says the lutherans this is I'm reading this this statement here a couple statements before we close it just kind of come back to being unshaken just to see how brother Brown places the capping in this end time and I'm wanting you to see this image in in Hebrews chapter 12 or hope that you can see it at least in type the lutherans under justification the feet raised it like that Wesley under sanctification the Pentecostals under the arms the works and deeds and so forth have the Armenian had to be legalist had to be Armenian had to be a legalist but now we come to the Head the Capstone brother Bam's laboring to get this point across quite frequently to see the work of God Through the Ages and to do so in a way to where we appreciate what has been and recognize that these are the things that were built on top of and I think there's a Temptation sometimes to want to kick away certain things but you have to be careful what you knock out from underneath you because if certain things haven't been right and haven't been correct then we have nothing to stand on so now we've come to the Head the Capstone what a statement We've Come To The Head the Capstone he brings in Zechariah 4 Grace Grace the Capstone cried The Headstone crying what Grace Grace from death and and and Creed into a Living Word of the Living God this is what we've done we've been called out of death we've been called out of Babylon we've been called out a dead denominationalism called out of organized religion you've passed from death and created into a Living Word of the Living God what a resurrection he said that was what a resurrection this is to be resurrected out of dark denominationalism he's saying this is The Headstone crying Grace Grace pass from death into life from a Creed into the Living Word of God he said God's only provided plan for his age his sons in the word age quickened by the spirit like a spark that's lit off of something to make it alive keep reading it if you have time it's beautiful poetry this is where we're living today and and for it don't get kind of caught up in the theological sense of it where you can kind of get your head lost in the types and Tabernacles and feasts and everything and just get dizzy reading the Old Testament but this is something that means something in our daily lives and power and overcoming the healing power of God the delivering power of God his sons in the word age his daughters in the word age quickened by the spirit like a spark that's lit off something to make it alive this is something living in this Capstone age this Capstone time the climax coming back to the sermon Christ is revealed in his own word but the bam is referring to Zechariah 14 7 it shall be light at the evening time he's really amplifying that when he says this pointing directly at those scriptures if I could say it this way he's putting his finger on Zechariah 14 he said that's the forming of the body from the feet coming up the light at the top of Mount Zion the Capstone coming to seal it at the end that's the format of the body from the feet coming up when he was here on Earth he was the Sun the lightness then he was killed the church took his place then martyrdom and went through the Dark Ages and began to build on the foundation coming out then where does the light the sight come from at the top of the head see that Vision Nebuchadnezzar see him going down from the beginning of the Gentile age before the blood was shed from them and made an atonement they were proselytes brought in but notice they went right down right down right down to the bottom in symbol see brought it down from the head to the feet now it started right back coming back the church coming back from the feet coming up now it's in the head time now notice the light you can't see with your hands yet it's part of the body you can't see with your ears yet it can hear you can't see with the nose yet it smells you can't see with the lips though it speaks see that was the Pentecostal age but now it's in the eye time and keep following here he says the scene now there isn't one moving faculty beyond the eye is that right so now when you have when you come to the prophetic time and the eye time after that Pentecostal time watch what what what comes next the next is the intelligence which is Christ itself who controls the whole body [Music] there has to come and that's what the the the role of the Prophet was in the ministry of Elijah as he's there to to introduce the intelligence there's this this crowning in the end time there Upon Our foreheads the intelligence there is a crowning of Mount Zion there's a capping of Mount Zion there's a there's an intelligence that comes to us at the open of the word the next is the intelligence it's Christ himself who controls the whole body from the head ship down this is the image he's bringing us through historically to see it in the Old Testament from head to feet now in the New Testament or the Gentile bride through church ages built on up to the Capstone the head the top of Mount Zion he says in the sermon the voice of the sign now if the Lord Jesus Christ the son of God who I've proven by the Bible promised that he would return in the last days and reveal himself in the fullness of his spirit just like the church coming up I know that's a you know another mouthful that maybe I'm just glossing over but that's that has some heft to it he promised to return the last days and reveal himself in the fullness of his Spirit just like the church coming up like it comes from a human being all the way from the feet come up the thighs Up To The Head and the head is the head of the body and the bodies come up ever since the first church come right on up in this in the reformations has come up till now it's come through justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost now there are ways that you could kind of cut this up and begin to look at it based upon the things that brother bam taught to where and I want to say this carefully but please help understand what I mean when I say this you can make the mistake that only the Holy Ghost is only given in this age but brother man said every age is the age of the Holy Ghost for the True Believer and there have been genuine members added to the body of Christ from the beginning through the true sill which is the new birth that's been happening throughout the church ages we don't want to change uh change the teaching of the message to say oh well now now under the message of the hour now we are the only ones the bride is having her Revival and it's the power of the god poured out by the baptism holy ghost in no other age had it no every age has been the age of the Holy Ghost for the True Believer and we're not just in the age of the Holy Ghost we're in the ages brother Graham said the Holy Ghost itself this isn't the age of just a baptism this just is an age of individuals being added this is something of an adoption age this is the word age this is the bride ages brother Brown calls it says it's come through justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost now it's the head Christ coming to the body the body of Christ he is the one who knows that's the intelligence it's the head coming to the body of the body of Christ he is the one who knows you could go back in Christ the mystery God revealed and see how these things he teaches through 63 64-65 connect back to these things he was preaching then he says my hand don't know how to act just by my head but he's the one who knows that's the reason he is the word it's come to the Head as Paul brought the church to the base the foundation of Mount Zion we've come to the climax we're coming to the finishing this is this is at the top and they're at the top you know the Capstone is a mini pyramid in itself and the pyramid had never been capped and now you have a a Capstone that comes and settles down this is the time we're living in right now the ceiling time the camping time and I share this with you to as brother bam said in Christ is revealed in his own work to stabilize you to see where we are in the end time to have confidence in what God is doing and and and I want to just close with a few statements here brother Adam says we're in the last days and the last hours of the days do you see him now in his word and all of his word made manifest right here before us this is this is what I'm wanting to see I know I've done it very quickly maybe I've done it um uh in a uh maybe in an immature way I don't know but maybe there's just been a lot that's kind of been pushed out there maybe it seems messy and maybe it's done in a way where there's a lot there to try to pick up and grab a hold of and if I've if it's been done in a way that's clumsy let me just say this I'm throwing a lot out there hoping that there's something that sticks in your heart that says God's fulfilling his word God's right on time prophecies are being fulfilled Zechariah 14 Zechariah 4 haggai 2 Hebrews 12. the word of God is just clicking right along things are being fulfilled and you are ordained to see it you ordained to see God fulfilling his word in the age that we're living in your a son and daughter of God in the word age to be quickened to be made Alive by the word of God this is the time we're living He says do you see him now in his word that's what I want you to be able to see is to see him now in his word to see him in the message of the hour to see him in the messenger to see him brought up to the church ages to see where we stand right now as his Gentile bride in this Union time he says do you see him made manifest right here before us so then with that he says oh Church of the Living God get to your feet believe him with all that's in you what a statement stand up on your feet uh don't be cast down don't be Dilly down around don't be laying around he says get to your feet believe him with all that's in you I hope that's something that we're learning through everything we go through through our ups and downs and our ins and outs and all our trials is that we're learning to believe him with everything that's in US he says hold to that little will if you could just think of that then hauled to that little will in the middle of the will he says Let It stabilize every move and every motion that you make let it stabilize every emotion that you make every thought that you have may it be controlled by this tower on the inside of you because God is sitting right in his word of this hour in the evening light showing forth the light sounds like for our God is a consuming fire that says let every thought be controlled by him which is on the inside of you church of living God he says get to your feet believe him with all that's in you hold to that little will in the middle of the will let it stabilize hold to something Beyond yourself yet within yourself let it stabilize every move every motion every thought that's where our stability comes that's that's where it must come from that's where we must find ourselves being fed my wife has been testifying to me and testifying how in her heart she had desire to know what it means that men shall not live by every by bread alone but by the word of God the bread of God the every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God said well what does even mean to live by that and and there's a there's there's a lot to think about in that statement that we can't live by bread alone and there's a lot that we could say is the bread but we got to know what proceeds out of the mouth of God because that's what we live by there's no systems there's no order there's no man-made nothing there's nothing of this world that feeds the flesh that we can live by that that in itself will give us the sustaining power that we need but we must have the word of God and it's it's sure on Christ the solid rock I Stand All underground you sinking sand brother Branham at the end of a sermon go wake Jesus I I don't have any more um slides I don't believe now so if you could just bear with me here for a moment he says I see two sisters sitting here tonight in wheelchairs I did it's I we're just making awesome time tonight in and out here we come we might be able to beat the Pentecostals there tonight maybe the Lord will have his way till midnight over there he says I see two sisters sitting here tonight in wheelchairs just listen to this just let this strike home see no doubt but then women has tried everything in the world to get well quite a statement and then he says there may be people here with cancer someone with heart trouble and the doctor's skill has worked everything they can to help you but you're at the end there's nothing can be done let's put ourselves in this position and then he says have we forgot who is with us who is this selling life solom Maine with us who is it to give the promise he is the word it's never been taken from us yet I want it so in my heart if they ever take this I got it here but the word is still with us here's the word and the things that the doctor can't remedy the things that the church world can't remedy we have the creator of all things with us Hallelujah it begins to go into the ecumenical council now the Pentecostals are going right into it and the Pentecostals kind of represent the that last stage of development in the plant and as they've grown up to the the that last stage of development and the restoration of the gifts brings it looks to be the full bodies brought back they go right back into air and there's a falling away I says they're going right into the Pentecostals they're going right into the ecumenical movement the World Council of churches he says now the others will speaking of all these denominations and organizations where Jesus said the two spirits in the last days would almost deceive the very elected if it were possible but the elected Ones Will no different the elected ones were no different there's your Matthew 24 24 but we're in a time of trouble where there isn't a minister in the world can stop our denominations from joining this ecumenical council they're already in it no matter how many things God did how blessed he was Among Us they went right into it anyhow you can't stop it that's just all there is to it they're going to do it and it's just an amazing parallel the physical sickness and the religious sickness the spiritual sickness the physical sickness just right there in parallel he says troubles that cannot be remedied by the church then as soon as we find out that you go to the doctor he'll say now if I can look at those two parallels spiritual sickness that the church can't remedy physical sickness that the doctors can't remedy you go to the doctor and say well I'm sorry to tell you but you have cancer he says well quickly that's all he's dead that's all there is to it or she there she they're gone the doctors say well that's parallelism and that's leukemia well right quick they're as good as dead right then this is how the world looks at it remember our caution about whatever you have a symptom we say don't Google it because it ends in one sentence you have cancer and you're going to die no matter what it is I I've been waking up with with uh with uh feathers in my bed and say oh well you probably have cancer and you're going to die right not thinking well what kind of pillows do you have what kind of comforter do you use the world just concludes cancer and you're gonna die and he says that's that's all there's nothing more science can do there's nothing more medicine can do he said fear sets in see but it shouldn't thank you let's just be honest tonight we don't have any cameras on anybody else but me fear sets in doesn't it whatever there's just a little bit of a whisper well it might be this and it might be that and and all it takes is just one uh one little thing to begin to move in your spirit and you feel suffocated you feel a little claustrophobic you feel like you can't get out you feel like you're locked in and that's all it takes just to get your heart rate up a little bit and before you know it you begin to have this field of oh no this is Doom oh no this is where it's going to be but he says you don't have to he says it but it shouldn't why why shouldn't it he says who is this that made the promise as he said earlier have we forgot who's with us who is it that gave the promise he says who is this that made the promise what are we living for why we are we the Church of the Living God why are we filled with the Holy Ghost let me say it this way why are we the Church of the Living God why are we filled with the Holy Ghost to remember in the time of trouble he's still here to remember in the time of trouble he is still here he stabilizes things when brother Bradham said the stabilizers have been put on the ship he saw one who could turn on the light he saw one who was present with us riding with us on the ship who could calm the Raging Sea he saw the very one it was the foundation who'd become The Headstone in the Capstone and he looked at the whole picture he says we don't have anything to worry about God has done exactly what he said he would do Fair sets in but it shouldn't I said who is this that made the promise why are we the Church of the Living God why are we filled with the Holy Ghost why do you have the Holy Ghost why did he give it to you so that you can remember to the time of trouble he's still here and he stabilizes things Christ is the stabilizer sister Elizabeth I hope you don't mind I'll just read your testimony here I just some time ago my wife was given a prognosis by a doctor through different uh visitations and exams and uh They concluded that she had some form of breast cancer and and my wife has wanted to read this she shared some of these testimonies I just feel impressed now I just happen to have it with me I feel impressed to share this I don't like to use our own testimonies ourselves uh because I'm very careful about how certain things get lifted up so I hope you give me a little bit of Grace tonight to share this the the the good side is it's my wife and I think it would be different if it was me he says I would love to give all she says I would love to give all thanks and praise to my Lord Jesus Christ for granting me Faith for a difficult test a few months ago I had a routine exam and a screening for breast cancer three separate tests all came back with abnormalities and ultimately the doctor ordered a biopsy due to his suspicions and he was he was suspicious and believed it it was some form of cancer he's from the day the doctor ordered the biopsy I watched God have his say at every turn and it was on a Wednesday that this happened and she comes to church that night she says the word come forth strongly for my need at the end of the preacher word my heart reached out in faith and grabbed my promise Revelations 21 6 and he said unto me it is done I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end I will give unto him that is the thirst of the Fountain of the Water of Life freely now I want you to see this in type how that brother Branham was looking at the beginning and he's looking at the end and when you see the beginning you see the end you can say oh it's done it's finished what do we have to worry about brother but I'm saying why why do we what have we forgot who's with us the very one who made the promises here to confirm the promise the very same satellite that established the church in the beginning he says comes again to finish it in the end it's the same s-o-n in the end he says why are you afraid Church why are you scared he says I am Alpha and Omega the beginning of the end he says it's done it's finished she says I said that's mine that is my promise and I held onto his word and I watched my faith become my eyes the devil tried to bring fear and doubt over the course of five weeks as the devil persisted in his lies each time the Lord responded with his Eternal Word and confirmed his presence with me this is what we ought to be looking for these are the things we ought to be building on Brother David when you were sharing with me last Wednesday night just the testimonies what God's done to declare his presence in the midst of what brother Theo is going through something welled up inside him and says this is how God works sometimes we're trying to look at the the scans and we're trying to look at the the measurements and trying to look at what the doctors say to find something in there that tells us we're healed when God all along is declaring his presence time and time again to take your eyes off what science sees and look to the Unseen and say it's finished the devil try it over and over again I know you all could just put yourselves in this and he says during this time Matthew 4 4 became my flesh became flesh in my walk men shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God his word sustained me during this Needy Time and my faith never strayed from his promise of it is done I never lost one night of sleep never had a moment of fear or ever doubted the outcome his word was my constant as my heart viewed every test through the faith he gave me this is just in the last week or the week before the biopsy came back completely normal and confirmed none of their concerns or suspicions it only confirmed my faith in his word I find myself just thanking him over and over for his grace he showed me to grant me Revelation in my hour of need God will have the final say let it let it just let her testimony be added to yours and the many of you who could testify I know you all if you could have time to write it out you could testify our God is real our the word is alive and it's powerful and as Believers in this end time we ought not to be behind in anything we ought not to live below any privilege but we've got to look to the word of God in the world alone to be our anchor who is it that made the promise what are we living for why are we filled with the Holy Ghost to remember in the time of trouble he's still here he stabilizes things we could have the musicians come brother Branham says in the world has fallen apart he says let's go to this Kingdom let's go we can find your things our thoughts are above where your inheritance lives let's go to this Kingdom let's go where we can find and live after that Kingdom this isn't this isn't a oh one day one day one day the kingdom will come we'll just if we could all just join in a circle and hold hands and sing Kumbaya or we'll work till Jesus comes and one day he's saying no let us go now where we can find and live he said then your thoughts are holy see as I read it earlier let it let it stabilize every move and every motion every thought that you have may be controlled by this tower on the inside of you there's a life that we could be living as believers I say well does that mean we won't ever be sick or you'll be sick but just look look at it through different eyes just look at it differently we just view it differently anything that happens we just view it differently because we can't let fear set in he said fear sets in and I hope I can minister to you in this way that there's Grace in that we know it fear What Fear feels like we've all felt it I've been experiencing some strange things just even this week right there's things that take place in your life and all of a sudden things seize upon you you know where's that coming from why why am I experiencing these distressing emotions why why are these things besetting me and you realize it's just this mind just this body it's susceptible to those things but I got a king on the inside of me there's one sitting on the throne and maybe I need sometimes I need to work my way start doing battle in my head battle with my spirit but I just think to myself let the king rise up brother Adam said oh Church of the Living God get to your feet and brave him with all that's in you I I want the real believer to stand up Let the real never stand up Let The King Stand Up let the bride stand up I say there's something inside of me in those moments I say let them arise let them arise Let It Rise Up oh and it cries out inside I'm distressed I'm I'm stressing out I'm panicking but let him rise oh Hallelujah let's all stand tonight [Music] oh Hallelujah
