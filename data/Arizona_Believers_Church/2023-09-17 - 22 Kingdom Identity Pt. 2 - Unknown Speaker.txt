TRANSCRIPT
========================================
so appreciate your attentiveness you are a wonderful congregation to minister to and we find quite often when ministers are here and they visit they always acknowledge and when they Minister they've always acknowledged just how well you pull on the word of God and just how welcoming you are to the word and it's a real compliment to you and your desire to hear from heaven I'm going to take a second part in this sermon Kingdom identity and again these things are kind of building together as we looked at character being expressed in our lives trying to put the emphasis on how that we live our daily lives and how that the interactions we have on a daily basis the relationships we share on a daily basis and just all the different ways that we live our lives and the different opportunities we have to accomplish things or be in interactions with other people that that's where Christ needs to be having preeminence brother Brandon makes the statement it writes at the very end of the church age book that not for one moment did he come to establish a church or that people would follow him but his interest was that a real relationship would be established between Christ and an individual and that through that individual Christ would be expressed and that really should be the emphasis as we have opportunities to gather together we want to emphasize Christ and lift him up and that he would have preeminence in your individual life so that's really at the heart of these things that we're looking at and as we speak about Kingdom identity it's using that phrase to talk about identifying the kingdom in our lives especially the order of our homes our manner of living as we've spoke about that the life that I live tells a story expresses something and how that our manner of living expresses the character of Christ and a life lived by the word is the word expressed now for the first um part here I want to pick back up some things from last Sunday we're looking at how that God identifies himself by his characteristics and if God identifies himself by his characteristics you need to know what those characteristics are in order to know that that's God and trust that that makes sense and God gave us his word to identify his characteristics and that would be maybe one of the most important aspects about the Bible one of the main things that brother Bradham emphasizes over and over again is this Bible is God in written form it tells us who he was yesterday tells us his mind his heart things that pertain to his desire and so we can always go to the word of God and the word of God tells us this is what God does this is how God thinks this is what God's going to accomplish and so we can learn of his attributes or characteristics from the Bible and then if we know his attributes and we know his characteristics then we can identify them when we see them if we said there's a God but we don't know what he's like and we don't know uh what he speaks about or how he feels or how he manifests himself then we would always be speculating then we'd be in the dark well I wonder if the son is the god and I wonder if that wind that can tear down trees is God and I wonder if fire is the god and there'll always maybe be this sense of we know there's something Beyond ourselves but can't quite put my finger on it but yet the word of God this Bible tells us the characteristics of God therefore we must know his characteristics in order to identify him we were looking at one characteristic in particular in First Corinthians Chapter 14 verse 33 for God is not the author of confusion but of Peace as in all churches of the Saints this is a prophet setting the church in order as he instructed the Corinthian Church uh to how to use the gifts and how to judge the gifts and how to order themselves how to deal with sin in their midst he is saying that God is and this is the prophet setting this church in order and it becomes a template of how that God's prophets set the age in order and he says he's not the author the beginner the establisher of confusion which is instability God is not the author of disorder or chaos but he is the author of Peace which is harmony or Accord it doesn't mean everything has to be the same but it means that differences harmonize and that if one is different here it's complementary to the other who's different over here and they just seem to work together like cogs in a will that they're they're not chipping one another they're not breaking apart they're not causing things to wobble but there's Harmony in accord even among the different sounds and the different voices and the different gifts and so we see that God is a god this is the main thing I'm still wanting to identify as God is a god of order God is the god of arrangement he puts things together and so when we see this in First Corinthians 14 that's a way of looking into the word and identifying a characteristic of God that God is a God not he doesn't author confusion but he authors peace he off authors order in the sermon the Feast of the trumpets I hope that this can kind of resonate in more ways than just uh uh emphasizing the point that if God is identified by his characteristics you've got to know his characteristics says we've come we've got to come to a place again to something that's going to introduce the Messiah let this really weigh Heavy in Your Hearts what he's trying to say here is he's talking about John the Baptist and now there's got to come something in this last days to introduce the Messiah he says and how will the people that's believe in him know it unless they're constantly in the word to know what he is how are they going to know the Messiah unless then there's got to be something to introduce the Messiah and if there's one introduced to the Messiah but you're not in the word to know what the Messiah is going to look like he's saying how are they going to know what he is Daniel said the wise shall know but the foolish the unwise wouldn't know they shall know their God now how he shall appear now this is him and his characteristics this is the word of God uh that's prophesied for this age being identified and God identified himself with those prophecies he says how he shall appear in the last days is to bring the people back to the word so that the bride will know her husband know her mate the revealed word so he manifests himself in a certain way in the last days and he's referring to how he shall appear in the way that identifies himself in the last days it says that the bride will know her mate now this is that's the first part I want you to catch from this is that God has identified in his characteristics and how are you going to know his characteristics unless you're in the word to know what he's how he's going to appear how he's going to make himself known but now join that with how he says that the word will reveal itself so that the bride will know her husband and he says that's why this has to happen it wasn't in the reformers wasn't in Luther Wesley in the Pentecostals and them scripture says it wasn't but it will come that is his promise for this age we're living in the age that his coming will be in very outstanding statements then he says she must be identified in him this is the second part I hope that kind of holds here for a little bit while we background some things so you can see just how important this relationship is the bride must be identified in him as how we'll say that there any woman must be identified with their husband for the two are one now if you were hoping that wasn't the case well we just ruined we just ruined your hopes because if you're married you're identified in your mate you're identified in your spouse and he's saying the woman must be identified with her husband the tour one and Christ's bride has to be identified with him for the two are one and he is the word not the denomination the word so the word is the Kingdom right here is the system the spirit and the life the kingdom is the the word and spirit made flesh in our lives and so there's an identification that comes when Christ unites with his bride in this end time and he said the bride must be identified with her husband and in the spiritual union between Christ and his bride there are certain characteristics and attributes that he's wanting to display through Us in ways that he wants to have preeminence in our lives and so we're in the process of yielding to that just as when a man and a woman get married uh it's not the love I believe is instinctive many times you just find that your love and you just can't help it the attraction could be instinctive but when two lives begin to blend together there there's a conscious yielding there's a conscience acknowledgment and adapting and learning as each one begins to understand the other person's Rhythm and and ways that they express themselves and what their likes and dislikes are so it's not that you just get married and immediately have it figured out you know there's and I think this is even true in parenting that you have to there's a lot of Grace maybe even we can have uh and as we grow in this message and we have third and fourth and fifth generation uh message families some of us need to take a step back and realize we weren't raised by parents who were raised with Truth uh they they came to truth it was zealous and sincere and begin to have children and they didn't have it all figured out what the standards of the word were and how to raise children and how to respond to difficulties and they did the best that they could with what they had and and the most outstanding characteristic you look for in a parent or any individual is not whether or not they have it all figured out but whether they're willing to learn and so there's an adapting there's a growing there's a there's a way that we're growing into this identification with Christ where we're learning to yield we're learning to Humble ourselves as we just sang and so the Bible says again Paul writing to the Corinthian Church let all things be done decently and in order I believe a marriage is an arrangement it's an order and let all things be decently in order identifying how that God is a god of order a god of a range and a god of setting things together let all things be done decently that means in proper form with becoming reverence in the Latin it speaks of some the Forma to be beautiful well-shaped and shapely in an appropriate way that there's a certain symmetry uh even naturally there's things that we see whether we would attribute it to a golden ratio or just certain things that we we identified as beautiful because of the Symmetry are there certain things you can do with photography and the the rule of thirds where you can frame things a certain way and it's naturally pleasing to the eye because order symmetry Arrangement colors and things there's a beauty to it and so God is a god of order he's a god of decency a god of beauty the proper Beauty and let all things be done in order it means a fixed Arrangement it do in the right order an orderly condition and brother Branham says put everything in its place and then operate in decency and in order and he's saying all gifts he says this about that put everything in its place and then operate in decency in an order you'll find God as a god of order and he will bring the right thing the thing right up then so a place for everything and everything in its place God is a god of order if you put it in its place God will bring the thing right up then he'll use it and these are a character this is a characteristic of God he's a god of order now let's look at Isaiah chapter four verses one to two and hopefully we could just add some notations here to kind of help a little bit as we read through this and I'm hoping to go a little bit further in Isaiah Chapter 4 verses 1 and 2. I hope they just get a hit on this very quickly it says in that day seven women shall take hold of one man now when you read this there's a lot of a lot of Truth to how this can be applied historically how the times of this judgment and the men that are falling by The Sword and the mighty are going to be dying in War uh that there's going to be a loss of men and not available husbands there's a lot of things that may be correct in a natural sense historically but we find that there's great type spiritually to this condition and even brother Branham identifying it in flashing red lights how that this is indicative of the last days it's in the last times and so there's a spiritual attitude that's also implied here and in that day seven women shall take hold of one man saying we will eat our own bread and wear our own apparel now this signifies that if we want to look at the context they were just desperate to be to to have a name or to be married there's not a respect for the union and that seven women are all happy just to have one man's name but let's just continue to live our lives they just want to be called by his name to take away their reproach now if I could just say that's confusion that's not the order or Arrangement that God established in the beginning this is chaotic and so this is a condition the seven women characterizes the time it characterized the society it characterized the age that Isaiah is writing in and it's describing the women who are described or it's the condition it's the actions of the women that are described in Isaiah chapter 3 which if I could summarize is very prideful very vain very self-shirt sir they're sticking their necks out uh they're very prideful their vanity about the Flesh and this is the condition of the age and the condition of the women the Bible is drawn in Isaiah chapter three and then it is Isaiah chapter 4 showing how the women represent the condition of Israel now if we could just uh get that in our minds this principle that God the Bible says that the men shall fall by the sword but when he's taking the temperature of Israel as a nation he describes the daughters of Zion and then he says these women I will take a hold of one man and he's using the women to describe the spiritual condition of all the people then the next verse in that day shall the branch of the Lord be beautiful and glorious and the fruit of the Earth shall be excellent and comely for them that are escaped of Israel this is the proper order this is the beauty and Arrangement this is the power in order and this is describing a warm women who are there's no pretense there's no hypocrisy they're perfectly in order and arranged and it's going to take the spirit of judgment to do that the spirit of discernment this is this verse would speak of the Bride who has had the word come and put her in her place and now we could see two different women portrayed the branch of the Lord which is beautiful in verse two and these seven women these chaotic women in verse 1. and brother Branham says in the invisible unit of the bride of Christ notice this character when you see women just going on the Rampage just doing anything they want to do watch the church is doing the same thing so we could see that the the modern Church which is a spirit parallels the modern women how that they act in their flesh it says when you see women in the natural going on a rampage wanting certain things doing certain things expressing themselves a certain way he said you know the church is doing the same thing now it may not be manifested itself in the same way that it is in the world but he said it's the same Spirit that's driving the two and this is a prophet saying when you see the world in society going after these things know that the church is also in the same condition so what is expressed naturally in society in entertainment and fashion in these things is the condition of the church nominally in a spiritual way so the church condition reflect is reflected in the condition of the women and the condition of the women is reflect they both kind of work together so if you look at the spiritual condition of laodicea then you know that that's going to be a natural temptation to the women in laodicea those things hold together he says in the sermon and knoweth it not just watch the way women act and I'll show you where the church is this is this is not not being able to say well watch women in the world they like to do this and sure enough you know here's the church here's the steeple open the door and there's all the people and they're doing exactly what the world's doing no sometimes it doesn't look just exactly like it but no that's the spirit operating in the church it'll manifest itself in different ways and that that can just that's that ought to sober us up quite a bit when we see the nonsense going on in the world today on and how much when we see it peeking its head up in the nominal churches and the denominations are saying well we are letting down the bars and we're going to accommodate this and we're going to change this and we're going to change that and they're becoming what they call more tolerant of certain things and we see the church world going that way that's just what's coming to the surface think about what really lurks underneath organized religion whether it has a Baptist name or some other name or independent name there is a spirit in the nominal Church working in the world we're working through the church religious system and organized religion that is also manifesting in the people in the age that we live in so there's those two he says watch the women there's the church he said the women morals is in laodicea in the world physically naked miserable blind and don't know it the people the woman of the world and the church is in the same stage there's brother random saying it that he's looking at a the Revelations chapter 3 this is what the angel is going to say to the church as he's diagnosis in a spiritual condition now he's saying that she's even naked and a physical condition stripping her clothes off and and acting in a certain way and he says you see the morals in the world it's laodicea so the world is morally in allowed to see an age and the church is spiritually in a layout of same age and always remind yourself that the spirit has not one good thing to say about laodicea so glad the prophet introduced us to a bright age which creates quite a paradox because brother man says this is a woman's age this is a woman's world but there's a way that Christ has made this a bright age so that you can recognize your place in him and the sermon does God ever change his mind about his word I want to use this kind of as a little bit of a fulcrum to shift more specifically into I'm going to use Jezebel to do so into more specifically my thought this morning says if you want to know where the church is standing watch the women I'm sure you all recognize this is a constant theme in the message of the hour where he's he's using the women in the natural to understand the spiritual condition of the church so he says if you want to know where the church is standing watch the women watch the morals among the women because she's a representation of the church now I feel just to preface this now so that there's a little bit of a uh you're you're thinking more balanced there's a way that this could be used as a club to bully women I'm it's been done for decades but no man can swing that club on a woman without indicting himself without having to examine himself first and if he's using it as a club it indicts him so no man using these things to bully a woman is absolved he's guilty himself of whatever it is he's beaten the woman up with if that's how he wants to use the word of God to put the woman in her place I did a series one time and it was titled putting the woman in her place and I used the title at the outset and I had to warn everybody just stay with me this isn't going where you think it's going to go and sure enough we had more visitors from the neighborhood that night than ever before and and I don't remember if they left early or not but there is there is a the man is not innocent if I could say this sometimes you just get so hyper focused on that we just feel men could just feel like yeah blame it on the woman and that's not what's being implied here it says watch the morals among the women because she's a representation of the church when you see the pollution amongst the women you find the pollution in the church could we not say the same in Isaiah chapter 3 that the women were a clear sign that the priesthood had let down their job that the women were clear sign that fathers were failing in their home the women were a clear sign that Israel had become untethered from the promises of God and were giving themselves over the wrong kind of influences when you see pollution among the women there's pollution in the church what she become a painted up Jezebel just exactly what the church has become now that's the truth and you know that if you want to know where the church is watch the morals among your women because she is the church is a woman and as he says uses the uh reference to paint it up Jezebel but the round takes Leo to see an age and he makes it synonymous with Jezebel religion and he says laodicea Jezebel he takes that statement in a few places where he's connecting them together so Jezebel is a type of the modern Church she's a type of even the Modern Woman brother Branham says this laodicea means woman in the Greek a time when women take over and I feel qualified to speak on this because I had the highest grade in my feminist political thought class When I Was An undergraduate to the you know I was hated hated by all these feminist starter kits who just couldn't stand the fact that maybe a born-again Christian who carried my Bob with a class every day had the highest grade in the class but I did it it's because I had I knew already from the message of hour I know I know what's going on here I have full disclosure the professor did think I was quite unfair to all the feminists we had to write about but she said my points were always well argued and well written and therefore I had the highest grade in the class does that make me a feminist so laodicea means woman in the Greek a time when women take over so this is the age and he says take over this is clearly alluding to leaving their place not being in a proper order or Arrangement now as he points to Jezebel I think this is a great place to kind of move forward to as we enter the 11 o'clock hour it says in First Kings chapter 16 verses 30 to 33 I think you're well versed in kind of the story of Ahab so hopefully we can just um touch on this very quickly and go forward and Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the sight of the Lord above all that were before him now that's quite a statement that Ahab at this point in history did more evil than everyone else before him and it came to pass as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of jeroboam the son of nebuch now what jeroboam did is he he worshiped God but used golden calves in doing so there was a I there was idolatry in the worship of the one true God but now the writer and the Hebrew is like as if it was a small thing what jeroboam did he aggravates it further and it's not just bringing idolatry into the worship of God this is even going full scale into idolatry it says that he took to wife Jezebel and the daughter of f Bell King of the zaida zydenians and went and served Baal and worshiped him this is important how they reference the fact that he married Jezebel and how she is a daughter of a heathen King an idolater she's an idolater herself this is not this isn't uh you know a story of redemption if I could just say that and he reared up an altar bill in the house of bill which he built in Samaria now this is not taking an inside or a symbol from The Exodus this is not taking elements and things that were tried to use to worship God and we're trying to worship God we're trying to worship the one true God and idolatry being expressed that way this is an abandonment of the one true God now it's overtly worshiping Baal and they have made a Grove and Ahab did more to provoke the Lord God of Israel to anger than all the kings of Israel that were before him this is quite a statement and what is Central to ahab's conduct is it's through the marriage to Jezebel that Ahab sinned greater than all others before him and it was critical that they recognized and I know there's more to the story of Jezebel where you can begin to recognize how cruel she was and how much she just wasn't saying well let me just worship Ahab just let me worship God in the way that I want to worship I know we're a blended family and and I'm a Jew and you're a Catholic and you know you can worship your God the way you want to and all it wasn't that she actually was cruel to where she wanted to murder and kill the prophets of God she wanted to impose her ideas and her religion and her attitude so there's more to this than just well a difference of opinion or a difference of theology but Jezebel means the exalted wife of Baal her very name identifies her as being a the wife of Baal she was identified with false worship she was overt about it it wasn't that she was the daughter of of of Israelite and Ahab marries her and findings out later that she was actually something else no this was clear she was a daughter of an idolter she was an open idolater she was very Brash about it she's very open about it and yet the King still married her the King still took her to wife despite the fact that he knew what she was at least on the outside now it is through his marriage to Jezebel that Baal worship is instituted in the Kingdom Jezebel's a type of laodicea where I want to emphasize for a little bit today is how that Jezebel through her her her idol worship and her attitude or hatred and her sorcery and her cruelty she actually reflected something in Ahab yeah I mean Ahab could have sat there said yeah I don't know I don't know what happened she was just so sweet when I met her and and she's she really was a good girl and I didn't see this coming at all and it's like her name was wife of Baal right she was a idol worship yeah I know I did you know I just thought you know I thought she had an accent I thought she was you know just like there's it wasn't there's no way that he could kind of wash his hands of all of it and say I I made a huge mistake it was something within Ahab that is now being highlighted in Jezebel and now as we say that trying to draw on some things we've ministered already laodicea as a church age of the laodicean church and the women of laodicea they reflect their designer who was Satan and in that design they ultimately in little cnh reject Christ it's a rejection of headship so here was one that was born uh to a an idol worshiping father and and she is raised in idolatry she's been given a name of idolatry and now she marries a king she has opportunity now to receive truth she has opportunity to worship the one true God but yet she does not Embrace God she rejects God and so Jezebel was openly an idolater that influenced Ahab to establish the worship of Baal now if I could start emphasizing this a little bit in spiritual Amnesia brother says we are identified with our families in this human life by marriage so our identification comes from family I don't know if any of you had this experience growing up with the last name McGeary that after after a while people said oh you're a megiri and they would always ask you about your brothers anybody else any mcgeary's here have that experience and so there'd be things that people would ask because there's a there's an identification with the name did you do you have a pet ducky and were you raised a Catholic and maybe there's a lot of name questions people ask you because there's an association with the family characteristics and I've always said there's just something about mcgeary's that stick out sticks out and so there's there's family characteristics that identify us so this program is just pointing to a very obvious truth we are identified with our families and by our marriages it says and with our wives we marry and our families identified by the union of our marriage I know this is stating the obvious but I think we ought to kind of lean into that a little bit and recognize that marriage is so critical to God it's so important that God instituted it in the garden it's a very precious thing and so through a union there's identification and individuals though they may have been separate before through a union it had there's this identification that takes place and it ought to be an amplification to where now we have a greater light we have a greater glory we have a greater reflection through that Union and so marriage who we marry the wives and the husbands to the wives in life we are identified by our marriages so Ahab was identified by his marriage to Jezebel people could have been speculating well we wonder what kind of King he's going to be we want to kind of man he is and we see traits in him good leadership traits and there's a there's this chance that maybe he can do better uh than than those they're aboam and these others that here's this chance uh maybe Omri was a good man and here's a chance for him to do this or he was an evil man and Ahab looks like he has a better opportunity well when he married that was a red flag and so ahab's character when I say character I want you to think of a lot of different things but whether we want to speak about what he's trying to accomplish in terms of his motives and his objectives what kind of Ambitions would he have what what things does he promote and like and his affections and what drives him so it's his character that led him character was a part his character was part of the process that led him to marrying her and then it was part of him allowing her to influence him trying to be uh very succinct in how I described that we could say that perhaps it was a character flaw that led him to Mary Jezebel and yet we could all just wait was it and now when she leads him and she be she she uh is wearing the male tunic in the family and she's leading things then it then we know oh it was a character flaw in him because her character's not changed there is no name change for her we're not reading the story of Redemption where it says in uh Ahab the son of Omri uh married this This Woman This daughter of f about King of the zydonians and changed her name and gave her a Hebrew name and changed her character and we don't see the story of redemption her character's not changed her worship is not changed but what we see rather is she exposes the poor character of Ahab and she encourages the poor character Ahab and now her as an idol worshiper and the son of the daughter of ethma she is now influenced Ahab to build Groves and to worship Baal so notice how the influence of the woman over the man the man had an opportunity in the marriage Union to bring out something better in Jezebel but now she brings out the worst in ahem and that's a lesson in any marriage sometimes you see people getting married and no we've never seen this and we've never said that that you know she was the worst thing for him we're just that just crazy thought right we've never said that about anybody but if you've ever said it and thought to it's because when you see somebody who has a weakness and they marry somebody who only encourages that weakness instead of covers it these are real challenges sometimes in our marriage we've got to be open to the things that were weak in what others are strong in and encourage one another in Proverbs chapter 12 verse 4 it says a virtuous woman is a crown to her husband but she that maketh ashamed is a rottenness in his bones I think we looked at this in the perfect love series we've looked at it a few other times recently a Godly wife would have been a crowning to ahab's throne had he married a Godly woman his brother Bradham says a Godly woman is a a good woman is a jewel in a man's Crown he says she should be honored so a good a virtuous woman is a crown to her husband as we said before kind of a coronation of the man she is she's a crowning glory to a man but she that maketh the shamed is the rightness in his bones the right kind of wife is a symbol of the husband's rule his dignity his honors the crown would represent Authority the right kind of woman is a represents his authority his honor his power his dignity his character but a woman that shames her husband strips him of his honor strips him of his power and for a woman to do that shames him but then also if a woman shames him in other ways it robs him of his power because it reflects what's in him and corrupts him marriage is intended to be a source of Honor marriage is intended to be a source of happiness far exceed in anything else that God could give outside of Christ says in the choosing of a bride when God gave a man a wife he gave him the best thing he could give him outside of Salvation he says that more than one time right so this places for for a man the woman is the best thing that God could give him outside of Salvation now that tells us something about God right could we not could we not take that principle that if God looks at a man and says the best thing I can give you outside of Salvation is a wife God not needing salvation has tipped his hand that the one thing he wants and the best thing he could have is a bride God gave a man a wife he gave him the best thing he could give him outside of salvation but when one goes to trying to take a man's place then she's about the worst thing that he could get a hold of now why is it that she could be the worst thing that a man could get a hold of because of the other side because she occupies such a wonderful position in the marriage Union that without the woman there is no Union there is no marriage and since she is a symbol of the husband's dignity dignity and Rule since she is a crowning to the husband it's saying that a woman that makes ashamed is rotness in his bones it robs him of power and vitality and happiness that strips away his honor and his power because she has no no one has any greater potential to raise a man up and to encourage a man like a wife she has the equal power and opposite to tear him down and corrupt him when man gave God man was given a wife by God it was the best thing but a woman who won't take the place that God gave her he says about the worst thing the Bible says in First Corinthians chapter 11 verses 7 8 9 for man indeed ought not to cover his head for as much as he is the image and the glory of God we know that Jesus Christ was in the image of God the express image of his person and that when God made man he made him in his image that's the that's man in the beginning that Paul says this this is very rich deep I would say theology or teaching or doctrine he says but the woman is the glory of the man God who is invisible whom we have not seen is made visible in Jesus Christ he declared to us the glory of God and we beheld his glory as the scripture tells us we can say visan is in the glory of the father but now Mankind in the beginning when God created Adam he was made in the image of God and therefore the male is in the image and glory of God represented in creation he says but the woman this is a great thought here the woman is the glory of the man for the man is not of the woman but the woman is of the man basically saying the man is not of the man but the one of the man is of the man because one man means of man so it's just it's really semantic saying the one who's of the man is of the man but the man is not of the man the man is the man for the man is not of the woman but the woman is of the man neither was the Man created for the woman but the woman for the man but then Paul says but the man is by the woman you keep reading so again there's there's always something in the word of God that's going to trip up the person is going to try to take it into extremes so the man is not of the one who's of the man but the woman is of the man and the man was not created for the woman but the woman for the man again man in the beginning being the image and the likeness of God and then the woman comes out of that one who is in the image of God now she is out of the man and she is the crowning of creation the woman crowned creation we know that when God was looking at it he comes to the conclusion that it is very good to it is not good and the reason why it was not good is because the best thing that God could achieve was a wife and hear a man in the image of God is without a wife and Adam as of yet not needing salvation the best thing God could give him and the coronation of who he was and the best thing that God could provide for him was one who was like him and complimentary to him and that was a woman and so that is God's the woman is the Bible says the glory of the man the woman was a gift from God 's first gift to his son was a wife one that was complementary to the man I I I I think there's so much positive we could take from this God is desirous to see that we have strong marriages that if there's any kind of weakness at all in our marriage then we ought not to take that as a sign say well I I love my wife or I love my husband or we're married we've got a certificate whatever it might be and he said well this is a union because we're both on the deed however you want to talk about it and then be discouraged because well it certainly doesn't look like what we're thinking over here and it doesn't look like the one that Christ has with his bride give you ought to have courage to know that the stability of that Union the strength of that Union the trajectory of that Union matters to God because in that Union is a very powerful reflection and that if there's any weakness in it humanity is sown and in it has been has sewn it into it and the devil's trying to exploit that it's not God who does it there's so much that could be said in this about the marriage itself we're wanting to kind of look at this uh the woman being a reflection of it the woman was a gift from God to man in Proverbs 18 22 who so findeth the wife findeth a good thing and obtain its favor of the Lord this is God's attitude towards a good wife this is God's attitude towards marriage that if a man finds a wife he finds a good thing and in being married that's the favor of God the Bible says a Prudent Wife is from the Lord and all the brothers said all right not bad the Bible says a Prudent Wife is from the Lord why this is something in God's original thought part of his original attributes part of something that was a very real to God and Central to God the marriage Union reflects the desire that God had in the beginning the woman was made to be a help meet co-equal but opposite complementary to be flesh bone and blood of Adam the woman is intended in the beginning and still as the Bible says the woman is the glory of the man she's intended to be an expression of the man's Glory she reflects the man's Integrity she reflects the man's honor when the Bible says the woman is the glory of the man she reflects upon a man's judgment the woman is the glory of the man this word Glory as it speaks of character she reflects upon a man's judgment the woman gives expression to the man's discernment to his wisdom to his opinion when a man marries a woman then then we are at least on a very superficial level saying oh well he must like such and such and he must like this and he must like that and there's certain things that we could try to extrapolate from that in the natural and now the Bible's bring it to a very real principle that when a man marries a woman it speaks about his opinion his discernment his judgment and when the Bible says because the woman is the glory of the man when the woman reveals a man's good opinion and his discernment it results in his praise and his honor the Bible says uh let your Works glorify your father you know let your light shine that when men would see your Works they glorify your father that when a woman operates correctly and humbly and obediently and when she's serving God and and she reflects upon a man's good opinion he gets the credit or the praise or he gets partial credit and gets praised likewise so a wife is to represent a man's strength and Excellence his dignity his majesty is Grace the words that are provided there in glory and in the sermon the chosen of a bride brother Branham is going to show us that a wife Mana is a manifestation of a man's thoughts it's a manifestation of his Ambitions and his motives what's kind of in his mind a reflection in his heart the chosen of a bride he says again the kind of woman that a man would choose will reflect his ambition and his character if a man chooses the wrong woman it reflects his character and what he ties himself to shows truly what's in him a woman reflects what's in the man when he chooses her for wife it shows what's down in him it's just kind of repeating that principle you see how Brad Graham's saying the woman that a man chooses to marry in the flesh says something about who he is in his Spirit or in his character and not just kind of his present state of mind but even his ambition now no matter what he says outside watch what he married I go to a man's office and he says he's a Christian I remember what we were ministering on Wednesday Pinups all around the walls the old Boogie Woogie music going on do we even know what that is I don't care what he says I don't believe his testimony because his spirit is feeding on them things of the world say if he would marry a chorus girl or what if he would marry a sex queen or just some pretty modern raquetta it reflects it shows what he has in his mind of what his future home is going to be because he took her to raise his children by the choosing of the Bride when God chooses his wife in this end time she reflects his future home she's a reflection of Revelation 21 she's a reflection of that New Jerusalem that Heavenly City it reflects it shows what's in his mind of what his future home is going to be but he's took her to raise children by because he took her to raise his children by and whatever she is that's the way she'll raise those children so it reflects what's in the man a man that takes a woman like that shows just what he's thinking of the future could you imagine a Christian doing a thing like that no sir I could not a true Christian will not look for such beauty queens and chorus girls and sex Queens he'll look for Christian character I know this is instructive to our young men that when they're looking to get married or they find that there's some sort of physical attraction that you want to look past the physical attraction and and and it's wonderful that it's there and and I would say that apart from the physical attraction there's really not a lot to get traction with right you don't just you don't see somebody who seems like a nice Christian and try to wheel yourself into wanting to marry him through prayer but there's a there's usually a spark there some sort of Attraction some way that God brings it together through those things but what we look for beyond the physical part is character Godly character Christian characters brother of Adam says it and the principle now is that when Ahab married Jezebel it reflected his character brother Adam says when a man chooses a woman and marries her that woman is a reflection of the man's character now this is not given as a just a litmus test one and done and if she's not a good girl you're a bad man and it's just kind of over and we just need to learn to deal with it going forward that's not it at all but it's saying something about how important and critical that marriage is saying something about how that when a man marries a woman that who she becomes and what she manifested and how she raises the children and what that home looks like is going to reflect on him I mean it's a man cannot you know say well you know that's my wife you know yeah I know those are my kids and that's my house but you know what that's my wife's job that's that's up to my wife and my wife did that my wife did that and my wife this and my wife that just kind of throw the wife under a bus remember one time I was uh preaching for a pastor and we're gotten this got in the car and I opened up the console or something or there was something standing there in the console and I picked them I go what kind of CD is this he goes brother this is my wife's car and uh we're just kind of joking around like man the bishop must be so blameless he's willing to throw his wife under the bus but there's you know there's a certain thing to a certain point because like oh well that's my wife's hey like when the when the when the woman when the man said hey you know I didn't send my wife did it right just kind of passing along I was like ah nice try how convenient that that's the first excuse I've ever given but there's a connection now through Union through marriage I want to read this statement to kind of to go to the next step I'm going to be reading in Ephesians chapter 5. verses 21 to 28 I know that's kind of maybe a usual place to end up but we're looking at the identification of the Kingdom the kingdom is king and queen marital Union the character of the king being expressed through his bride the power of the throne being made manifest in the lives of Believers now we're looking at identity in our own lives and our marriages become something that's reflecting the word of God or the kingdom and brother Graham says and serves we would see Jesus he says all these things are attributes of God just so that in the end the Bible said Jesus said you will know that I am in the Father the father and me I and you and you and me and that's the today he says that day is this day it's God becoming tangible we've used some quotes out of identification where it says God becoming tangible in our lives he says your own wife you and your husband is just a shadow a negative of God and his wife the church now if I could take it in the language he's saying you and your spouse are God though it's just a shadow it's God being represented it's God being identified it's God becoming tangible that through a union between a man and a woman that there's a reflection of God in that that in its place in operating in harmony with the mutual dependency and mutual accountability that God has expressed in that Union that there's a picture being painted in that your own wife you and your husband are just a shadow and negative of God and his wife the church it's just God's attributes being displayed in Shadows and types like the Old Testament was to the new so as the Old Testament foreshadowed what the New Testament Christ in the New Testament you now in the Natural Life are manifesting foreshadow reflecting what God and his bride are going to be through all eternity wow what a beautiful thing that our unions our marriages our homes Our God becoming tangible the word becoming flesh and and if I can say this now and I know you won't fault me if I repeated it towards the end do you see now why that's one thing the devil's always attacking is the strength of our unions and our marriages and the stability in our homes and going after the peace in our homes and going after the arrangement our homes because it has such a powerful and for lack of better terminology upside and the devil knows if he can get it upside down the downside is the worst it can possibly be I mean does not the Bible teaches you'd be better dwelling in a shack than a marriage that's out of order Ephesians chapter 5 verses 21 to 28 now with that in mind a union is God becoming tangible I feel like I'm covering a lot of ground today as we go forward Ephesians chapter 5 verse 21 I believe the scripture verse 21 is so critical to understand the rest submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of the Lord so there's a submitting to each other wives submit yourselves under your own husbands I'll just read to verse 23 as unto the Lord for the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body now the teaching is submitting to one another wives submitting to husbands and the teaching is the natural marriage relationship between a man and a wife and Paul's drawing from the spiritual relationship between Christ and the church to instruct and to teach the Union as Christ is the head of the church savior of the body so ought to the wife be subject to the head which is her husband therefore as the church is subject of the Christ so let the wives be to their own husbands in everything and all the brothers said everything so submitting yourselves one to another wives submit to your husbands as the church is subject unto Christ now submission and subjection reflect God's character this is this is a part of God as we talk about Kingdom identity and kingdom characteristics that this is way the way that God is God being above all God being in all God wanting to express himself chose to express himself through order we see it in the heavens we see it in Stars we see it even in the invisible Realm of the heavens where there's angels and there's seraphims and there's different roles and relationships and relationships to one another and fixed positions not just among stars and planets but even among the Angels there's roles and even to the point to where they could fall there from their place they could leave their place there's a great picture being painted in the character of God as we read the Bible so submission and subjection everybody feeling warm and fuzzy submission subjection these are part of God's character now I'm going to say this and emphasize this for some of the remaining moments we have together hopefully keep reminding of you this this does not create a carnal hierarchy this is not about saying one is um higher than the other and one is lower but it's about arrangement it's about order there's there is not a part if we even use the nomenclature that one is above and one is under one is on top one is beneath and we were to structure in such a way to where there was one low and one high we wouldn't we could not take away from that that that establishes order of importance order of necessity because you'd have to view them together though one may be uh under the other you have to look at them as what they're accomplishing and the sum is what is is greater the sum is more important and so I I do not want you to take away from this the idea of some sort of hierarchy has anybody ever called themselves the low man on the totem pole have you ever done that then you're the most important one because in a totem pole the bigger and the stronger always on the bottom I know the ones that hell you thought you were running me down you said you're just a low man on the totem pole and I just went right the low man on the tombow he's the one that held him he knows as it gets higher they get smaller and smaller and smaller right so in that those that false deities you had the big strong powerful one on the bottom so when you say you're the low man in the totem pole humble yourself right hum yourself a little bit but there's not it's not creating any kind of order in order to make one better or more necessary than the other Paul is even clarifying that in First Corinthians 11 though the woman is the glory of the man and the woman of the man and from the man the man came by the woman so submitting now carries with it the idea of cooperating or agreement and how that there is this assuming responsibility to one so it says wives submit yourselves to your own husbands there's some Assumption of responsibility to the husband and a man cannot marry and is not ready to take a woman to be his wife unless he's willing to assume the responsibility of being her husband to submit and even the word subject there in this passage or the same Greek word it means to place in a certain order or to arrange I I know that in the image and the word picture is to be under to submit but it's more importantly a saint to be placed or arranged in a specific order to mutually appoint or agree upon we could submit uh and offer something we could submit and we agree upon it and if submission and subjection just only mean to be under in a hierarchy to someone then we could never submit to each other I I know I'm not trying to be kind of janky with my semantics here if the Bible says submitting yourselves one to another if it just means to be under someone so that someone has the upper hand they have the power they have the premise they have the privilege and so I submit to you and that creates a power hierarchy and then you submit to me how does that even work how how is that how would that actually uh what would that look like in real life so submission and subjection is more than just creating some sort of forced structure submission subjection and Rule had been perverted to mean something that's not christ-like it's been taken out of context to say well the man is the head therefore it's the the ends the the ends is to make the man the head are you following me that in this day and age with some of the Gnar movement and a lot of the the the charismatic movements that are taking taking shape and even as it attaches itself to Christian nationalism and political uh movements that this figurehead of a strong male and we want a woman that's submissive or women saying I want a man that's strong and I want a man that's going to be a man Trump 2026 and 28 and 30 and 32 right and like yeah right you want a real man and they've got this image of what a man's supposed to be and and how a man's supposed to express himself and how he's supposed to live and how he's supposed to act but there is a submission a subjection in the rule that is nothing more than a perverted tool for man to rule over a woman in an ungodly way and they'll do it in Christian settings and they'll do it in other settings as well but brother Brown does say a man as a husband is the head of the woman he rules her so if a man rules a woman if a woman is to submit to a man if a if a woman is to subject herself to her husband as as the church is subject to Christ then I wanna there's a lot of there's a lot said in those statements there's a lot more to the scripture than just the man is the top he's the best he's the ruler he's the smartest he's the strongest you just listen to him there's a lot more being expressed in the whole image look how it continues in verse 25. husbands love your wives so it's not that the whole thing ends it's not you know the whole Bible doesn't end in Ephesians 5 24 right to a lot of people maybe they just ripped out the rest and said well stop here I like that good place to end honey devotion's over right right here but no there's more to it husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it I hope that you can recognize something here that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the wash in the Water by the word they might present to himself a glorious church not having spot a wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be whole and without blemish notice the implication is that's not the way he found her but that's where she finishes so I Aunt meant to love their wives as their own bodies he that loveth his wife loveth himself recognize the character of Christ This is laboring Love This is laboring Grace that though the the in our in the spiritual type in the very literal type when Christ found us we were flawed but through his love he's redeemed us and he's nurtured us and he's washed us and he's built us up this is Christ laboring to bring true character out of the Bride not because he saw it superficially when he married us not because he saw it charismatically or carnally in our flesh when he died for us but because of what was down on the inside and the potential the imprint and the soul the real character and nature that we had on the inside of us he had a way that he could bring it out and let me say this if Ahab had been a man of character though he married a jezebel Not only was her name could have her name been changed but her nature changed her character changed and she would have become a virtuous wife and queen he as an attribute and a crowning to Ahab the son of Omri and that's what Christ does for us is he loves the church and he gives himself he sanctifies he cleanses and that's how we ought to love our wives the Bible can or this chapter concluding so nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself and the wife see that she reverence her husband you realize that if we do not love properly as husbands we make it exponentially more difficult for our wives to reverence us that harshness reduces that respectful submission brother Paul alfontaine put it to me this way one time that a man's sinful tendency and Leadership is to be harsh and a woman's sinful tendency is to resist headship and and the and the the two now work against each other if a man wants to be I'm the husband I'm the head you get under my thumb you need to submit you need to subject yourself the wife just doesn't melt oh my goodness you're irresistible no it there's going to be something in the woman like what are you talking about you want me to do what you know I'm going back to Mama's or whatever it might be there's a certain attitude in the sense of no I don't think you're gonna no you're not gonna talk to me that way and so that's and and the men could say well I mean I told her to get under my thumb you know I told her I was the man she pucked up she left and you want you want the you want the pastor to give you a chest bump like yeah what's up man you really showed her it's like oh wait a minute that's not how this works right that you don't that's you're never gonna get a Godly woman you're not going to get The Godly part of that woman out of her when you meet her with that kind of obstacy and that kind of harshness and so it tells us man you could read all the scriptures you want and tell the woman to find her place but the best way for her to find her place is for you to build it and for you to make it available and for you to find the right kind of way in leadership for her to feel comfortable enough to step into that place and so I'm saying the men ought to take responsibility for it but I say also women you've got to recognize even your own Tendencies and how it's a little bit of harshness might cause you to be a little bit resistant and we've got to recognize that and do our part so that there's Harmony in our Arrangements the husband is the head of the woman he's brother bam says scripture saying this so submitting ourselves one to another I gotta go quick I'm gonna go really really fast so you can play this on half speed when you archive it First Peter chapter 3 verses one to five likewise your wives be in subjection to your own husbands that if any obey not the word they also May without the word be won by the conversation of the wives why they behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear that's a mouthful Peter is saying that the wives holy conduct can influence an unbelieving husband to Salvation but why she conducts herself and notice the conversation of the wives That's not how much you like to talk hey it's the conversation the way she lives the chaste conversation her manner of living her conduct coupled with fear that she in serving her husband and he says be subject to your husbands and he doesn't qualify to you to say wives be subject to your husbands if he believes the message the way you do he even goes so far as to say wise be subject to your husbands even if they're not saved because the way you serve your husband may be the means of saving him when they see your holy conversation your holy conduct and it may be the very gospel that's preached because it says without the word maybe they're not hearing the word maybe they're not the words not being preached over the pulpit maybe they're not absorbing what's being said but a wise conversation coupled with fear can be the very drawing power brother James Hayes was he fellowshipped with us in the beginning was here quite a bit just a real help and blessing in this church getting started he would live next door he was just uh he was a you know this isn't part of the story but it was a pilot it was capped with American Airlines that's not don't hyper fixate on that don't get nervous brother John but he wasn't serving the lord and he lived next door to a family that believed the message and they got to talking and the brother brother John Phillips was a wonderful brother he uh started going through the church age book with him and he started just breaking things down and after a while brother James whole family he gave his heart to Lord got saved the families completely revolutionized and brother John just went ahead and fired off a star into the Galaxy with his name wrapped up in it because he knew for sure it was the breaking down of the church ages and the great teachings he had done in these Bible studies that one brother James to the Lord so brother John one day maybe just need a little bit of Courage was like James just go ahead tell me what was it that led you to the message what was it that really caught you and bro James said that was your wife the way she served you you're a knucklehead right you're a brute and the way she just tumbled herself to you and the way she served in the home and the way she cooked and cleaned and the way she lived says that's what got our attention as a family that's what got my attention this day and age that there was something real and I don't know what brother John's response was and you might have said right answer and just moved on but that's what did it is the wife why because she identifies subjection if I could say this as we're reading these scriptures this is God's character the arrangement of the man and the woman together it's the order it's the position it's not to create one as being better than the other and though we could say scripturally that one is weaker and though we could say that one has certain opportunities that the other may not and we could identify these differences they're not done to create a division but to find the points of Harmony and where they complement one another and so God's character is expressed in this order in this position this word subjection it's such a a deeper word than just to put somebody underneath somebody but it means to submit to one's admonition or advice is to recognize one's Authority in place so when a wife submits herself to her husband it's not just the semantics of being underneath him or even the logistics of just doing whatever he says but there's just some recognition of this is what the man is this is what the woman is this is what the man does this is what the wife does this is what the wife does that's what the man does the mutual recognition to be subject here as we read this in the Bible it's a voluntary attitude of giving in and so a Godly woman is not beaten to submission a Godly woman is not intimidated into submission a Godly woman is not someone who's forced into following but a Godly woman is one who willingly yields herself to leadership she may even recognize that she has certain opportunities and certain gifts or ideas whatever it might be but she's one that yields herself recognizing God's order and God's pattern brother Branham in the church age book the thytering age this would be a good one to listen to an audiobook he says now a woman is not meant to have an iron disposition because what is this what is the scripture talking about why submit yourselves to your own husbands it's an attitude of giving in this iron disposition this is an attitude this is a character this is that's as harsh a stiffness a woman is not meant to have an iron disposition she is according to the Holy scripture to be submissive to the male that is commanded of her woman who is truly female all female will be of that disposition and no wonder they identify anymore as something other than female women who is truly female all female will be of that disposition that we could say that's the word and that's language that oh my goodness just tweet that out on x or X that on X this afternoon and watch what kind of reacts as you get to be submissive to the mill that's commanded of her and you keep reading not a doormat notice how brother Brahman said it's not something where she's under his feet no real male makes a female a doormat she will want to be under Authority and not rule over the mill for he is the head of the house if she breaks that image that God made for her she is perverted this is where this image comes up this expression this role if a man makes a woman a doormat he breaks the image if a woman tries to rule the man she breaks the image any male that lets the woman take authority has also broken that image and he is perverted that is why women cannot wear that which pertaineth to a man or cut her hair there's even the image in the way that we dress the way that we carry ourselves and conduct ourselves in women not cutting their hair men cutting their hair that's an image that's being expressed she is never to wear garments that pertain to a male or cut her hair when she does she's intruding into the male domain taking Authority and perverting herself remember in Isaiah chapter 3 when it says that there's going to be a scab upon her head that the very language in the Hebrew says it's taken away and stripping her way the identity that made her different than a man the very thing that distinguishes among the sexes she's entreated on a male domain taking Authority and perverting herself and when a woman invades the pulpit which is it is commanded she must not do she shows what Spirit she is of being a dominating female is Antichrist this is very challenging language iron disposition dominating female now that's the character of laodicea that's the character of Jezebel these things are the spirit that's on the age and what I would what I would Express is that's if I could say this to the sisters that's the spirit you fight against every day is iron dispositions and dominating females lesbian spirits on the churches women wanting to lead it's that dominating spirit and you war against it and if it has any impact on you at all it can warp your mental perception of things warp you in your spirit but there's a Godly character down on the inside by the new birth that is resistant to that and if there's any any wobbling at all or any struggling at all it's a matter of recognizing the very things that a war and against you that are trying to force an image make you hard-hearted make you a little bit calloused this iron disposition is not of God a dominating female is not of God but the Bible continues let the wives be in subjection to their own husbands that you might win your unbelieving husband through your Chase conversation coupled with fear and it says this about the women in verse three who's adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair and of wearing of gold or putting on of apparel notice how that hearkens back to Isaiah 3 and the attitude of the women he says but let it be the hidden man of the heart in that which is not correctable even the ornament that's the adorning an appropriate harmonious Arrangement or Constitution remember how that word meant order or government there's some sort of arrangement some decoration the arrangement of the stars in the heaven is the ornament of Heaven this is God's order this is where God's glory is shown this is why a family can be so powerful when the man is not treating his wife like a doormat when the man is loving his Christ Like Loving his bride like Christ loves the church when the woman who's adorning her Arrangement is the hidden man of the heart the adorning the ornament the arrangement of a Meek and quiet Spirit that's the different kind of disposition than the iron disposition of the dominating female which is in the sight of God of great price don't let it be the outward world of the things in the flesh but let it be that arrangement in your heart God loves this arrangement put everything in its place and then operate in decency in an order you'll find that God is a god of order and right this is where I realize maybe some of my Thunder's been stolen on social media already but that's what happens when you lay it all out there but at First Peter chapter 3 verse 5 as we continue for after this manner in the old time the holy women also who trusted in God Adorn themselves being in subjection unto their own husbands now Peter's drawing back on the Old Testament the women of old that and and the old time holy women who trusted in God adorned themselves not in the platin of hair not in the wearing of gold not in the putting of apparel not trying to dress to impress the husband let's just all admit it women dress for women hey that that's guys don't even remember what they wore right but the women they dress and sisters do it too they dress for one another and Paul said Paul's saying that it's not the outward of Jordan's going to get a man's attention it's not the planet of the hair it's not all those different things but it's that hidden the character let your adorning let your Arrangement be a certain disposition a certain attitude to a certain character and he's saying this is how the women of old who trusted in God they Adorn themselves they arrange themselves in subjection to their own husbands brother Brahm says is your life worthy of the Gospel women ought to look to Jesus Christ you ought to look to Sarah and them of the Old Testament this is what Peter's saying look to them look to their expression as we are ministering on this in Kingdom Worthy brother Branham is talking about the the character and how that we ought to you can't just say well you know I do this that and the other in the church and think you own the church and go out on Monday and steal and lie he said you take on the spirit of the world and don't belong to the church of living God when your life doesn't match up with the word of God and this is continuing that statement women ought to look to Jesus Christ you ought to look to Sarah in them in the Old Testament I was preaching the other night somewhere about women to obey their husbands and that was the I think the Sunday night before in flashing red lights the 23rd in the evening he says obey yeah that went out of the marriage ritual a long time ago but they ain't going to do that no sir they live in America and they let you know they are not going to obey but as long as you don't do it don't never try to call yourself a Christian because you're not I don't care how much you dance and speak with tongues if you don't obey your husband you are out of the will of God I know that's heavy language and and should I narrate to the listening audience and husbands are getting writing cramps they're trying to write that down so fast just write down a couple keywords you'll be able to find it later I don't care how much you dance and speak with tongues if you don't obey your husband you're out of the will of God as long as you don't obey don't ever try to call yourself a Christian because you're not I know that's heavy I know that's playing but let's think about what the emphasis is number one and then get down just a little bit into what is being expressed what does it speak to it speaks to God's desire it speaks to the word of God it speaks to the image that God thinks that ought to be expressed and not just so that the the semantics that could be observed but because of the power that's represented in that Union and what it can can accomplish musicians if you could come to your instruments what outstanding statements it brings the emphasis back down as we said Wednesday night brother Brandon when he's preaching is your life worthy of the Gospel he's really punching at trying to turn your church experience and what you experience at church into your identity and you're saying you can't do that brother Branham show such reverence and the scripture shows such reverence to the marital Union that Peter says you should be of subjection to a husband who's even not a believer and I'm glad that the message gives us great clarity on some of these things through specific questions that are asked but brother Brown was asked a number of times maybe we'll go through this in the future where he's asked my husband doesn't believe like us he doesn't believe any it's even the questions asked in such a way to say essentially he doesn't think you're a prophet brother Branham he doesn't believe the message of the hour and he goes to a different Church what should I do and brother bear says go to church with your husband you know I said don't be afraid you have nothing to be afraid of dear if you know the truth and you've got faith you've got nothing to be afraid of he says go and what does he what is he what is he doing in that moment he's not watering down how important it is to go to church he's not watering down how important the word of God is in truth he's lifting it up there's something expressed in that image there's something expressed in that marital Union that a woman has a better voice of the truth by doing what the Bible ought to in arranging herself to her husband in love than she does by saying be an obstinate in giving lip service to truth I want to read you a story that brother Bantam tells in the sermon water from The Rock he's telling the story I provided all the slides here just so you could see this conversation go back and forth It's kind of lengthy but I say it just to emphasize that identity and maybe it's a maybe it's not a real clear uh clear-cut picture this morning and how we've presented it so I know God will give us Grace but he says a lady come not long ago saying that someone told her that she had Seven Devils another person told her she only had five he said poor woman Plum gone nearly set in the room taken off her stockings pulled her feet up in the chair said I haven't eaten for several days and I'm I'm not going to eat till I find out what become of those devils said what are they I said I don't know I've never known nothing about it she said well one Minister told me I had seven devils and the other lady said I had only had five now there's two of them gone somewhere and stayed there about two hours in the house until God began to speak and said lady listen you come from St Louis yes how'd you know it your husband's on the police force that's right you used to be a lovely housekeeper not just notice what he zeroes in on you used to be a lovely housekeeper that's right recently your house looks like a Hog Pen that's right your daughter's over there now taking care of your husband now notice how the Holy Spirit identifies something's something's wrong used to be a wonderful housekeeper and now your house is a mess and your daughter is taking care of your husband this isn't how it's supposed to work that's right who told you that I just kept talking because it was in a vision you went down to a little place first you went to a doctor yes he'd give you shots yes those shots were called was called hormones yes you went down to a place they told you had Devils yes because you had a real funny feeling yes they sent you to California yeah and so man told you at Seven Devils yes you went to a woman she said you had five Devils yes and they told you to come to me yes that's right how did you know that the holy spirit said so now catch this is as you think about this image you haven't got any Devils to begin with that's right I haven't no ladies sure you know your mother went through the menopause it's the menopause something natural this is just the imbalance of hormones and things he says what do you think a home run shots are for I don't know for the change of life that's what it is no Devils at all it's just your condition of life she began to relax now I don't think this image is irrelevant my wife was cooking some bacons and bacon and eggs out there I suspect that the lady hadn't done it for several days good chance maybe she wasn't doing it at all cooking she began to look through the house and I said kind of hungry she refused to eat it first said yes she went out and ate three eggs a big bunch of toast two cups of coffee a lot of jelly [Music] for the more refined Jam I believe it is right she's just as happy as she could be she said brother Brown you're going to pray for me and cast it away I said cast what away the thing there's nothing to Cast Away well I never felt so good in my life and hold it here brother John said what must I do now this life This Woman's life's been pretty chaotic she's got funny feelings her hormones are she's through this time of life where there's bodies changing and this menopausal condition is causing certain manifestations of attitudes and there's a certain Rhythm to that and even throughout life and here she comes to this time of life where it's very pronounced and what she's going through it's very real to her she goes to the doctor and the doctor gives her shots and it's to deal with the imbalance the chemical imbalances in her body but yet she's all worked up and stirred up so she goes to a meeting and someone says well you've got Seven Devils she goes to a meeting in California and a woman says you've got five and instead of her just thinking oh we're doing better now she's worried where the other two went and and she's been told all these things and then finally says that you need to go to a real specialist go to brother Brandon he'll help you out and her life's chaotic she used to keep home now she doesn't anymore she used to take care of her husband now she doesn't anymore and maybe she had this excuse well I'm so out of sorts and I'm so torped emotionally and everything's out of whack and so now she wants to be delivered of these devils and brothers there's no Devil's delivery from I can't lay my hands on you and cast anything away there's nothing there to Cast Away and so now she's saying what must I do and what is it we can do and listen to what he says go home straighten up your house cook your husband a nice big apple pie about that thick I don't know I don't know how thick that is it says when he comes in tonight throw both arms around him and kiss him sit down and get on his lap and tell him you love him and live like the lady ought to and if husbands if you're on Carnivore and this happens eat the pie go home straighten up your house cook your husband a nice big apple pie about that thick when he comes home to end tonight throw both arms around him and kiss him sit down get on his lap tell him you love him and Live Like a Lady ought to he said that's exactly that's all there is what is brother Brandon bring it back to brings it back to living the life and the solution to the upheaval and the solution to everything that was going on is to come back to the channel where the life is being lived come back to doing the things you know you ought to do that's what we are affording the opportunity when we have children is to is to raise them in the fear of God to look out after their spirits to sanctify the home for their sake and there's a lot we can pour ourselves into for our children say there's a lot we can do for our spouses sake there's a lot that we can do in giving in serving and being what God wants us to be for the others that'll straighten up a lot of things that are out of place in our lives whether it be hormonal problems whether it be emotional problems or depression or unable to overcome in some area of your life get back to doing what you know you ought to do as a spouse wow go home and clean your house bake a pie [Music] he says all the pouring on of oil and The Stomping and kicking and all the loud hollering wouldn't do a bit of good it's the truth that makes you free that's true you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free what was the truth Live Like a Lady ought to there there's a lot emphasis in that that the truth was that she didn't have a devil still yet the solution brother Brandon said oh you don't have a devil well what must I do man you don't have a devil you ain't got seven or five you got none and brothers he didn't leave it at that he instructs her and the brother about him is here there's no doubt there may be things in our lives that he could just drill down into and expose and identify things that are out of place but don't you think it speaks to you already or it's not necessarily for there to be this kind of Razor Precision about how many days we haven't eaten and where we've gone to get our diagnoses but that we can look at ourselves and say I know I'm not doing what I ought to do as a man or as a woman and then there's the solution to my problems is living the life could you stand with me this afternoon
