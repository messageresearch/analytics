[0:00] continue on the subject of i am
[0:03] an open book
[0:04] and we on wednesday we were we felt it'd
[0:07] just be too exciting uh to be in the new
[0:10] place to just jump into a part four of
[0:12] something and so with the newness uh
[0:14] maybe be gone for some of us and the
[0:16] strangeness gone for some of us i just
[0:18] feel that liberty to go right back to
[0:21] where we were last sunday on this
[0:23] subject of i am an open book
[0:25] i'm going to read from the masterpiece
[0:27] to start this was the last
[0:30] statement i used last time
[0:33] on this subject and i want you to kind
[0:35] of catch this because we've been using
[0:36] statements of the bible became a new
[0:38] book when the seals are opened and so
[0:41] this is i'm not
[0:42] i've just kind of kept it open in my
[0:44] heart maybe to
[0:45] just follow the leading and take some
[0:47] liberty maybe to expound upon what my
[0:48] overall aim has been in looking at this
[0:52] and maybe this statement will
[0:53] open that up he says he speaking of
[0:56] christ fulfilled the old testament so
[0:58] christ
[0:59] is the fulfillment of the old testament
[1:00] now it's the new testament another piece
[1:02] to be fulfilled so we've looked at how
[1:05] christ fulfilled one part there's
[1:07] another part to be fulfilled
[1:09] you think about that the old testament
[1:11] may read like a historical record but it
[1:12] was actually prophecy
[1:14] the new testament in many maze many ways
[1:16] may read like a historical record but
[1:19] it's prophecy so he says see the new and
[1:21] the old is husband and wife i mean that
[1:23] just that really clarifies it right
[1:25] there the new and oldest husband and
[1:26] wife it took the old to for show the new
[1:29] christ come the masterpiece to fulfill
[1:32] that christ the masterpiece came to
[1:33] fulfill the old testament now his bride
[1:36] will fulfill everything that's in the
[1:38] new testament another masterpiece is in
[1:41] making that's quite a statement to take
[1:44] christ who is the masterpiece and then
[1:46] lift up the bride to the place of being
[1:49] another masterpiece in the making
[1:51] and and there's a lot of ways that that
[1:53] even that line of thinking can be uh
[1:56] uh
[1:57] criticized in the sense oh well that
[1:59] sounds like catholicism but realize
[2:01] catholicism took truth and perverted it
[2:04] and so this the thought and the premise
[2:06] that there is going to be a bride who's
[2:08] going to fulfill the new testament and
[2:10] going to be a another masterpiece in the
[2:12] making is just the culmination of paul
[2:15] saying that the church is his body
[2:18] it's the fullness of him that filleth
[2:20] all in all and so that's what i'm uh
[2:23] looking at in terms of i am an open book
[2:25] it's something that you can say
[2:27] and in what we see unfold to the old
[2:29] testament into christ i want you to
[2:31] recognize unfolds through the new
[2:33] testament into this last days when god
[2:35] raises up a bride
[2:37] now there's going to be some things i
[2:39] think there's going to be some
[2:40] scriptures that might be review
[2:42] that we've gone over before but i want
[2:43] to use hebrews chapter 1
[2:45] just to start
[2:47] our going further into this but keep
[2:49] that in mind the bride is the new
[2:51] testament
[2:52] she's the fulfillment of the new
[2:53] testament
[2:54] hebrews chapter 1 verse 1 we'll just
[2:56] kind of go through this to verse 5. i
[2:58] might make reference to a few other
[2:59] scriptures very quickly but says god who
[3:01] at sundry times and in diverse manners
[3:04] spake in time past unto the fathers by
[3:07] the prophets we're not going to get into
[3:08] what sundry times and diverse manners
[3:10] are what i want you just to recognize
[3:12] the past god spoke by the prophets
[3:15] and the words of the prophets were
[3:17] memorialized in their in the scrolls
[3:19] memorialized in scripture so the words
[3:22] of the prophet god's speaking by the
[3:24] prophets there's an oral tradition then
[3:26] there's a written tradition and there's
[3:27] actually a tren a writing down books are
[3:30] written the word lord moved upon
[3:32] the writers of these scrolls and these
[3:34] scriptures and to the jews they had what
[3:37] they called the book they had scrolls
[3:40] they had scriptures
[3:41] and jesus makes reference in matthew 26
[3:44] something transpires and he says that
[3:46] all this was done that the scriptures of
[3:48] the prophets might be fulfilled so think
[3:51] of that wording scriptures of the
[3:53] prophets the writing the
[3:54] the the memorializing the putting down
[3:57] into record it's the record of the
[3:59] prophets and then on the road to uh well
[4:01] then jesus in luke chapter 4 verse 21
[4:05] he takes the book and he takes the
[4:07] scroll of isaiah and he unfolds it he
[4:09] begins to read he says this day is this
[4:11] scripture fulfilled in your ears what
[4:13] was it the scripture of isaiah the
[4:15] writing the record of isaiah
[4:17] then on the road to emmaus it says that
[4:19] he took begin with moses and all the
[4:22] prophets and expounded to them in all
[4:24] the scriptures the things concerning
[4:26] himself so they had a written word that
[4:30] is rolled up in these scrolls it's this
[4:32] writing they believed in the prophets
[4:33] they believed that their words were
[4:35] inspired they believed that that was a
[4:36] record from god as the spirit moved upon
[4:39] the prophets to write it and they had we
[4:41] called the old testament but to them
[4:42] that was their book this was their
[4:44] scriptures these were their scrolls it's
[4:46] what the scribes transcribed and wrote
[4:48] down and copied over and over and over
[4:50] again and this is what pharisees became
[4:52] experts of and this is what even some of
[4:54] the oral traditions that begin to be
[4:56] added it's compared the sadducees and
[4:58] different ones comparing oral tradition
[5:00] to the written word
[5:02] and this was to them
[5:04] their book that they looked to to give
[5:06] them guidance to memorialize the works
[5:08] of god and his promises to them now when
[5:11] christ is standing there what i want you
[5:13] to realize is their written word had
[5:15] become living word
[5:17] because then the next verse then it says
[5:19] that god at sundry times spoke by the fa
[5:22] unto the fathers by the prophets that's
[5:23] what's given you their bible and he says
[5:26] hath in these last days verse 2 spoken
[5:29] unto us by his son
[5:31] whom he hath appointed heir of all
[5:33] things by whom also he made the world so
[5:36] this is hebrews chapter 1 verse 2
[5:39] who he hath appointed heir of all things
[5:41] by whom also he made the world he's
[5:43] speaking of jesus christ so now he says
[5:45] he at one time spoke by the prophets now
[5:48] he speaks by his son
[5:50] the son is now speaking and there's a
[5:52] timely timely slide there remember if
[5:55] you want to give
[5:56] we can start taking up more offerings
[5:57] even while i'm preaching hey first one
[5:59] to donate right now i'll take to lunch
[6:01] here we go
[6:03] smash that subscribe button make sure
[6:04] you turn on notifications oh look at
[6:06] this sister so-and-so just denied a
[6:08] thousand dollars
[6:10] let's turn it into a live uh
[6:13] twitch is that what it is
[6:15] twitch stream now
[6:17] monetize that this will be a real maybe
[6:19] a good platform we can switch to and
[6:20] monetize our services
[6:23] there's half in these last days spoken
[6:26] at us by his son so now he's comparing
[6:28] he spoke by the prophets before but now
[6:30] he speaks by his son
[6:32] the words of the prophets became the old
[6:34] testament
[6:36] but now when the sun begins to speak
[6:38] what i want you to realize and this is
[6:39] the part to me i just started really
[6:41] feeding on last week and energize me
[6:43] excited me now the spoken word because
[6:46] christ is now speaking because now he's
[6:48] speaking by the son now the spoken word
[6:50] complained the written word
[6:53] and these things are working together so
[6:55] he has they have the written word but
[6:57] now the spoken word comes and the spoken
[6:59] word will not contradict the written
[7:01] word
[7:02] the living word cannot contradict the
[7:04] written word the and so here's the
[7:06] written word now the spoken word is is
[7:09] is making plain the written word and
[7:11] this is what on the road to emmaus and
[7:13] we've used this previously so it just
[7:15] kind of gives us that cause uh just to
[7:17] refer back to it that after he had was
[7:19] made known in the breaking of the bread
[7:21] they said did not our heart burn within
[7:22] us
[7:23] while he talked with us by the way and
[7:25] while he opened to us the scriptures
[7:29] so here he's speaking
[7:31] and it's the spoken word making plain
[7:33] the written word and it's written it's
[7:35] there but now as he opens it up he takes
[7:38] something says but all this was done
[7:40] that it might be fulfilled as was
[7:41] written by the prophets and the
[7:43] scriptures of the prophets to be
[7:45] fulfilled this is remarkable because
[7:47] it's the spoken word and the living word
[7:49] making plain what had already been
[7:51] written
[7:52] so he hath in these last days spoken of
[7:54] this by his son
[7:56] and this is kind of the the unfolding
[7:58] now from he spoke by prophets now he's
[8:01] speaking by his son and then he says of
[8:02] the son who be in the brightness of his
[8:04] glory and the express image of his
[8:07] person
[8:08] and upholding all things by the word of
[8:10] his power when he had by himself purged
[8:13] our sins sat down on the right hand of
[8:14] the majesty on high being made so much
[8:17] better than the angels as he hath by
[8:19] inheritance attained a more excellent
[8:22] name than they this excellent name it's
[8:24] a concept that we could veer off into
[8:27] and explore to uh great benefit but this
[8:30] excellent name has to do with sun this
[8:32] position this relationship
[8:34] for under which of the angels said he
[8:36] had any time what angel did he ever say
[8:37] you're my son
[8:40] he says thou art my son this day have i
[8:41] begotten thee he never said it to an
[8:43] angel
[8:44] and again i will be a father to him and
[8:45] he shall be to me a son this is
[8:48] referring back to the prophecy to the
[8:50] written word
[8:51] and some of the psalms so christ now
[8:54] is the express image of god
[8:58] he is in the brightness of the glory of
[9:00] god that's one thing we've been trying
[9:01] to make this relation to you have the i
[9:03] am that spoke to moses now christ is
[9:06] that i am it's the same god now but
[9:09] christ is the express image of his
[9:12] person this is a complete
[9:14] different relationship than any prophet
[9:16] had to god this is a different
[9:18] relationship than any prophet had to the
[9:20] people he says he is in the express
[9:23] image of his person
[9:25] brother brahma in hebrews chapter 5 and
[9:28] 6 part 1 he said god then became in
[9:30] another type of a tabernacle and that
[9:32] tabernacle was who jesus
[9:35] and god was inside of jesus and he was
[9:39] hid amen
[9:41] god was inside of jesus and yet the veil
[9:43] the flesh hid god
[9:45] because they looked at him and it wasn't
[9:46] say oh of course god this is god veiled
[9:49] in flesh they said you being a man not
[9:51] over 50. it says that before abraham was
[9:53] i am and they took exception to him
[9:56] because his appearance and his physical
[9:58] stature but yet god was hid in that
[10:00] simplicity so he said he was hid but he
[10:03] was reconciling the world to himself
[10:06] by his expressions
[10:09] so this was the this was god expressing
[10:11] himself attributes were being displayed
[10:14] and the part i really want you to key on
[10:15] here is christ revealed god
[10:19] this is what christ did christ revealed
[10:21] god now i will come back to this
[10:24] prophets
[10:25] god spoke to prophets and god's works
[10:27] were made manifest to the people there's
[10:29] glimpses that they could get they could
[10:31] understand his heart and recognize he's
[10:32] certainly a god of detail because he
[10:34] asked him which
[10:35] fabric could mix with other fabrics and
[10:38] where they could wash these pots and
[10:39] what meats they could eat definitely a
[10:41] god of detail and they could extract
[10:42] things about god as a righteous god and
[10:44] certain things were an abomination to
[10:46] them but they the word of god was
[10:49] expressed to the prophets and there was
[10:51] a lot of foreshadowing in that of christ
[10:54] i want to come back to this a lot of it
[10:56] was pointing forward to christ who had
[10:58] come then when christ comes he reveals
[11:01] god that phrase christ revealed god
[11:05] i'm really feeding off the principles of
[11:07] christ is the mystery of god revealed
[11:10] so christ revealed god now in john
[11:12] chapter 14
[11:14] verses 5 to 9 we've been reading these
[11:16] scriptures
[11:18] lately often it says if you had known me
[11:20] you would you should have known my
[11:22] father also and from henceforth you know
[11:24] him and have seen him
[11:26] maybe a startling phrase when they know
[11:28] he's speaking of god so philip says lord
[11:31] show us the father and it sufficeth us
[11:34] he said if you've he's just said you
[11:36] have seen him but he says just show us
[11:37] he says have i been so long time with
[11:39] you and yet hast thou not known me
[11:42] philip he that have seen me have seen
[11:44] the father
[11:46] and how sayest thou then show us the
[11:47] father
[11:48] believeth thou not that i am in the
[11:51] father and the father in me i want you
[11:53] to recognize this relationship the words
[11:56] that i speak unto you i speak not of
[11:58] myself
[11:59] but the father that dwelleth in me he
[12:02] doeth the works
[12:05] this is a remarkable relationship he's
[12:07] saying the father that dwells in me he's
[12:09] creating this uh this connection and
[12:12] this union between the father and the
[12:14] son he's saying the father dwells in me
[12:16] there's this personal intimate fusion
[12:18] and connection he's the one that's doing
[12:21] the works god is in me
[12:23] veiled in my flesh god has hidden me
[12:25] he's doing the works so it's my works
[12:28] that are revealing to you who god is
[12:31] so he says believe me that i am in the
[12:33] father and the father in me or else
[12:34] believe me for the very work's sake
[12:37] believe me for my word's sake because i
[12:39] say so but also believe me for my very
[12:41] work's sake verily verily i say unto you
[12:43] he that believeth on me the works that i
[12:47] do shall he do also
[12:49] this is to him that believeth
[12:51] then he says and greater works than thee
[12:53] shall he do
[12:55] now how where are those greater works
[12:56] going to come from how are there going
[12:58] to be greater works because i go into my
[13:00] father
[13:01] so there is a work there's works that
[13:03] can be done because through faith and
[13:05] through belief
[13:06] but then and i'm wanting maybe just to
[13:08] kind of wet your appetite for the these
[13:09] scriptures greater works than thee shall
[13:11] he do because i go unto my father so
[13:14] there's greater works that are
[13:15] prophesied there's works that are done
[13:17] by faith then there's greater works
[13:18] because he goes unto the father
[13:20] that these scriptures are telling us
[13:22] something very striking and brother
[13:24] brahm looks at these scriptures and he
[13:25] says god became expressed in the person
[13:28] of jesus christ jesus was the express
[13:31] image of
[13:32] god jesus was the express image of god
[13:36] it's the father dwelling in me he does
[13:39] the work
[13:40] so now let's just with this scripture in
[13:42] mind and pondering this the father is
[13:44] dwelling in me he's doing the work so
[13:46] that whenever you've seen me you've seen
[13:47] the father something about christ
[13:49] standing there before him speaking
[13:51] acting living breathing performing
[13:54] miracles but also just living his
[13:56] everyday life
[13:57] we might focus more on the miracles oh
[13:59] he walked on water that's god but you
[14:00] realize god can make himself very very
[14:02] small and it was god in the
[14:04] interpersonal relationships it was god
[14:06] in the wisdom it was god in the eating
[14:07] it was god in his communications and his
[14:09] associations it's god making himself
[14:12] known
[14:12] because he does refer he does take
[14:14] phillip and he says we've been with each
[14:17] other for a long time and we can look
[14:18] into the scriptures and just see
[14:19] glimpses
[14:20] but he's saying i've been walking with
[14:22] you i've been living with you you've
[14:23] watched my manner of life you see the
[14:25] way that i speak you see how i treat
[14:26] people you know how i talk to you and
[14:29] how we commune one with another this
[14:31] you're experiencing god and you're
[14:33] experiencing his attributes when you've
[14:35] experienced me because i am the
[14:37] expressed image of god
[14:41] now i want to take a step back from that
[14:43] and and put it this way the old
[14:45] testament was a divine record of god
[14:47] dealing with israel
[14:50] it's a divine right it's an actual
[14:51] record it's the record the scriptures
[14:52] speak of uh the record of the prophets
[14:55] they have recorded this down
[14:57] and we understand that in this record of
[15:00] god dealing with israel there were
[15:01] shadows
[15:02] of things to come
[15:03] in the sacrifices
[15:05] types of things to come even in the
[15:07] feast days and there's all these
[15:09] different glimpses we have and there's a
[15:11] lot of pointing forward a lot of
[15:13] prophecy contained in the paschal lamb
[15:15] in exodus 12 and 13 when god institutes
[15:18] the passover feast and we that is that
[15:20] is god foreshadowing his son to come as
[15:23] a lamb as a sacrifice so these very
[15:25] specific detailed things that are in the
[15:27] word of god
[15:29] it's god pointing forward to a time
[15:31] where christ would come express image of
[15:33] god
[15:34] and i don't have this on the slide i
[15:36] just want to read it very quickly god
[15:37] brother bram says god who on occasions
[15:39] would manifest his presence by the cloud
[15:42] or pillar fire that struck fear in the
[15:43] hearts of men this god whose heart
[15:46] characteristics were made known only by
[15:48] revelation of words to the prophets
[15:51] now became emmanuel god with us
[15:54] declaring himself
[15:56] wow that's a write that down you know
[15:59] uh put a nice font on it and maybe some
[16:02] barn wood in the background a little bit
[16:03] add some depth put a nice filter over it
[16:05] and forward it to everybody right put it
[16:07] on your whatsapp status that's a
[16:08] statement this one god whose heart
[16:11] characteristics were only known by
[16:13] revelation of words through the prophets
[16:15] you could only know things about god as
[16:17] the prophet spoke by divine inspiration
[16:19] he says now he becomes not god above us
[16:21] but god with us
[16:23] in christ and now that god is indwelling
[16:26] in his son
[16:28] he says he's declaring himself
[16:32] and this there's there's this beautiful
[16:33] symmetry from the old testament to the
[16:35] new testament even from genesis to
[16:37] revelation as we took a lot of time to
[16:39] explore some time ago
[16:41] as a church and here in the it says in
[16:43] genesis 1 1 in the beginning god created
[16:46] the heavens and the earth what a
[16:48] beautiful revelation right there seed in
[16:49] it always from the beginning in the
[16:51] beginning god created the heavens which
[16:53] is the type of the bridegroom and the
[16:56] earth which is the type of the bride in
[16:57] the very beginning he's already telling
[16:58] us foreshadowing
[17:01] what his story is going to be in the
[17:03] beginning god created the heavens it's
[17:05] the opening of the old testament
[17:08] and then when john comes to write
[17:10] his record
[17:11] he says in the beginning was the word
[17:14] and so he connects the in the beginning
[17:16] of the old testament now he's picking up
[17:19] within the beginning was the word and
[17:20] the word was god and the word uh it was
[17:23] with god it's in the the word is god
[17:26] and and he says things he gives us kind
[17:27] of john the baptist and he comes to this
[17:30] uh
[17:31] this statement that it's that word that
[17:33] was made flesh in jesus christ
[17:36] it comes later says and the word was
[17:37] made flesh and dwelt among us
[17:40] and so this is in the beginning god now
[17:42] john says in the beginning the word and
[17:45] you have the old testament opens up with
[17:47] god the word but now the new testament
[17:49] is that word made flesh in jesus christ
[17:53] and brother bram says the very substance
[17:55] of god was made flesh and dwelt among us
[17:57] the great spirit god unto which no man
[18:00] could approach which no man had seen or
[18:02] could behold was now tabernacled in
[18:04] flesh and dwelt among men expressing the
[18:07] fullness of god to men
[18:09] moses and all his glory could not
[18:11] express the fullness of god to men david
[18:14] and even his heart which is like and
[18:16] unto god god's own heart
[18:18] i could not express the fullness of god
[18:20] to men but the substance of god who man
[18:23] could not approach who had not seen
[18:25] could not behold was now tabernacled in
[18:28] flesh
[18:29] among men expressing the fullness of god
[18:33] to men
[18:35] if you're jotting down notes put a
[18:36] little star do something to kind of
[18:38] highlight that because that's something
[18:40] i want you to be able to come back to
[18:41] later he's saying it's god the fullness
[18:43] of god in flesh
[18:46] among declaring the attributes of god to
[18:48] men
[18:50] and then as brother branham said
[18:52] emmanuel god with us was declaring
[18:54] himself john says it in john 1 18
[18:56] no man has seen god at any time the only
[18:59] begotten son which paul was saying which
[19:01] angel was ever called son
[19:04] the only begotten son which is in the
[19:05] bosom of the father he hath declared him
[19:10] that word there declare i often point
[19:12] out that it means to unfold as a
[19:14] narrative
[19:15] and it means to
[19:17] and and i use that to make you recognize
[19:19] it's not just like a paul revere right
[19:22] in the midnight hours saying the british
[19:23] are coming the british are coming
[19:25] and that one moment there's this
[19:27] declaration made but it's more to his
[19:29] life his manner of living the way that
[19:31] he uh his it's his whole the whole thing
[19:34] and to declare means to thoroughly
[19:35] explain and make clear
[19:38] he have thoroughly explained and made
[19:41] clear the father there's definitely a
[19:43] paradox there right because here he is
[19:46] declaring plainly god thoroughly
[19:49] explaining god and what do they do they
[19:51] crucify him so there's a paradox there
[19:54] but this is
[19:56] god manifested in his son and it's this
[20:00] culmination
[20:02] of
[20:02] the prophet's
[20:04] prophecies in first john chapter 1
[20:07] verses 1 to 3 it says that which is from
[20:09] the beginning which we have heard
[20:12] which we have seen with our eyes which
[20:13] we have looked upon this is the sun that
[20:16] paul talked about that god has spoken to
[20:17] us now in their days they're looking at
[20:19] very real john's ryan said i've heard
[20:20] them speak
[20:22] watched them live i've seen the miracles
[20:23] our hands have handled of the word of
[20:26] life
[20:27] we've heard the word of life we've seen
[20:29] the word of life we've looked upon it
[20:30] we've our hands have handled them the
[20:32] word of life says for the life was
[20:34] manifested and we have seen it and bear
[20:36] witness and show unto you that eternal
[20:39] life which was with the father and was
[20:40] manifested unto us
[20:42] beautiful dynamics because john could
[20:44] say i've been with him
[20:46] i've handled them this word of life life
[20:48] was manifested to us i've seen it now
[20:51] i'm bearing witness unto you and makes a
[20:53] statement and i show unto you that
[20:55] eternal life
[20:57] you can already see where this is going
[20:59] they've seen it now he's saying i shown
[21:01] you eternal life which is with the
[21:02] father and was manifested under us now
[21:05] he's a conduit he has this burning
[21:07] desire as life was manifested to me
[21:09] through the sun i likewise want to be
[21:11] faithful to show the same fidelity to
[21:14] god and his nature and characteristics
[21:15] and i also want to manifest to you this
[21:18] eternal life that was manifested unto us
[21:22] that which we have seen and heard
[21:23] declare we unto you what i've seen what
[21:25] i've heard i'm a true witness i declare
[21:27] unto you
[21:28] that you also may have fellowship with
[21:29] us
[21:30] and truly our fellowship is with the
[21:32] father
[21:33] and with his son jesus christ
[21:37] this is
[21:38] life was manifest this is god being
[21:39] revealed
[21:41] brother brahman said when god was truly
[21:42] revealed he was manifested in the flesh
[21:45] he that hath seen me hath seen the
[21:47] father
[21:48] when god is revealed he's manifested in
[21:50] the flesh
[21:51] you can't god is not an epiphany
[21:55] alone he's not just a thought he's not
[21:56] an imagination
[21:58] you say well i've had a i've had a
[22:00] revelation of god i've got this image of
[22:01] god well then it has to it has to
[22:03] manifest in flesh
[22:05] if i could just use it this way you ever
[22:06] get a revelation of your healing
[22:10] it manifests in your flesh
[22:12] yeah if you had a if you had a broken
[22:14] arm and you got a revelation all of a
[22:15] sudden it was going to be amended guess
[22:16] what it's going to be mended
[22:18] so it's when god is revealed it's
[22:20] manifested in flesh
[22:22] now just again pause let's look at it as
[22:24] from an overview again maybe coming back
[22:27] to what i said just a moment ago but the
[22:29] scriptures then the bible i want you to
[22:31] kind of catch on this thought
[22:33] the bible
[22:34] the old testament
[22:36] was made flesh in jesus christ
[22:39] so god inspired the written record
[22:43] now god is oh revealing that record he's
[22:46] he he makes it flesh in jesus christ his
[22:49] life the life of christ was an open book
[22:52] it was to explaining he had declared the
[22:55] father he's explaining he's making clear
[22:57] the father
[22:58] so christ and i want you to make this
[23:01] this make the connection of the
[23:02] israelites to
[23:04] uh their the old testament to the
[23:06] scrolls to the scriptures christ was the
[23:08] revelation of god
[23:10] to the people of the old testament
[23:13] right
[23:15] that shouldn't be maybe a foreign
[23:16] concept but christ christ is the
[23:19] revelation of god to the people that the
[23:22] old testament very quickly identifies
[23:24] you look at the beginning of the the
[23:26] book it kind of gives context as to why
[23:28] we're here
[23:29] and then well why did god uh call
[23:31] abraham well he he wanted to have a
[23:33] people and the old testament is a record
[23:35] of abraham and all his children all his
[23:37] seed after him because from him is going
[23:39] to come the seed of the woman prophesied
[23:41] in genesis 3 15. so that one comes to
[23:44] the people of that book
[23:46] he comes to those people of the old
[23:47] testament and that's a pattern for us
[23:49] then
[23:50] as the prophets were sent to israel as
[23:53] the promises were given to israel as the
[23:55] messiah was to come to israel as they
[23:57] were to have their physical possession
[23:59] in a physical land and receive a
[24:00] physical messiah it gives a shadow and a
[24:02] type and a pattern for us
[24:05] and we can say that even that coming of
[24:06] the messiah
[24:08] it unfolds through the the process of
[24:11] conception to birth even until the day
[24:14] that the holy ghost fell on pentecost
[24:16] this is all related to that that time
[24:19] and coming of christ
[24:21] and the purchase of salvation and the
[24:23] sending back of his spirit and his
[24:24] ascension into heaven
[24:26] it kind of encapsulates this whole thing
[24:28] that the prophets are pointing to about
[24:30] the messiah
[24:31] now
[24:32] i want to make this statement and i hope
[24:34] it becomes clear to you in these quotes
[24:35] i want to read
[24:37] the coming of christ was the climax for
[24:39] the jews
[24:41] if they didn't recognize it it was and
[24:43] there was it was one of those things
[24:44] where you wait you wait wait for the
[24:46] moment the great climactic moment
[24:48] and then all of a sudden you look away
[24:50] just for a moment and you look back and
[24:51] it's happened you missed it
[24:52] and that's what israel did they looked
[24:54] away
[24:55] they've been waiting for this they've
[24:56] been waiting for this they've been
[24:57] waiting for this and all of a sudden
[24:58] they look away and it's gone this was
[24:59] the coronation christ coming was the
[25:02] crowning of their scriptures
[25:05] all the scrolls that they had laid out
[25:06] and they had all these scrolls laying
[25:08] there christ comes as the climax i can
[25:10] say this way the capstone to everything
[25:13] the prophets had written
[25:14] amen
[25:16] it was their their capstone their
[25:18] crowning of their scriptures of their
[25:19] bible
[25:20] and paul is touching on this in
[25:22] galatians chapter 4
[25:24] verses 1 to 5.
[25:26] he says now i say that the heir as long
[25:29] as he is a child
[25:30] differeth nothing from a servant though
[25:32] he be lord of all
[25:34] but is under tutors and governors until
[25:37] the time appointed of the father now
[25:39] he's drawing from
[25:41] tradition
[25:43] of a son
[25:45] born into a family
[25:46] taught
[25:48] and trained
[25:50] until
[25:51] the father sets a time until a
[25:53] particular time that the father has
[25:54] designated that the child
[25:57] that he is adopted so it's not a change
[25:59] of relationship it's position it's
[26:01] placing
[26:02] so then he's speaking of the jews he
[26:04] says even so we when we were children
[26:07] were in bondage under the elements of
[26:08] the world
[26:10] but when the fullness of the time was
[26:12] come now he's speaking
[26:14] he's speaking in present tense for him
[26:17] he's speaking as historically
[26:19] jews speaking for those to whom the
[26:21] promises were given and he says but when
[26:23] the fullness of the time was come that's
[26:25] a remarkable statement god sent forth
[26:27] his son made of a woman made under the
[26:30] law
[26:31] to redeem that them that were under the
[26:34] law because they were under bondage to
[26:35] the elements of the law they were had
[26:37] tutors and governors until the time
[26:39] appointed father to redeem them that
[26:40] were under that we might receive the
[26:42] adoption of sons
[26:44] now this is
[26:46] there was an adoption that pertains
[26:47] israel it's important sometimes to make
[26:48] that difference between the adoption of
[26:50] israel and the adoption that brother
[26:52] branham teaches us in the message of the
[26:53] hour so here he's saying there's this
[26:56] and we read it last time there's an
[26:57] adoption that pertains to israel paul is
[27:00] talking about this that when christ came
[27:03] he was made of a woman made under the
[27:04] law to redeem those of us israel who was
[27:08] under the law that we might receive our
[27:10] placing in the word of god that was
[27:12] promised to us when we received the law
[27:16] that was promised us by the prophets
[27:17] that was promised to us in all the word
[27:19] that was written so we have these great
[27:21] wonderful precious promises given to us
[27:23] and he says in the fullness of time
[27:27] the fullness of time was come god sent
[27:29] forth the son the fullness of time is
[27:31] that time appointed by god because he
[27:33] says until the time appointed the father
[27:35] so he's making that connection there's
[27:37] this adoption until the time appointed
[27:38] the father so he says now when the
[27:40] fullness of time was come god sent forth
[27:42] his son
[27:43] the fullness of time is the end of a
[27:45] dispensation
[27:47] some time period where god is an
[27:49] administrative administration a
[27:51] dispensing of rules or authority or
[27:54] wisdom is that this in the fullness of
[27:56] time had come there's this end of
[27:57] dispensation
[27:59] so what paul is referring to
[28:02] is the end of the jewish church state
[28:06] paul is referring to the end of the law
[28:09] it says when the fullness of time was
[28:11] come this is the time that the prophet
[28:13] specified would come
[28:15] this is the time that god intended all
[28:17] those mosaic elements and institutions
[28:20] to reach he gave the sacrifices he gave
[28:22] the the feast he gave all these
[28:24] observances all these ordinances and he
[28:26] gave them to be to a particular time and
[28:29] god instituted them and said they'll be
[28:31] in full force and effect until this time
[28:33] but god had determined beforehand that
[28:35] they would go no further
[28:37] so i want you to can you catch that
[28:39] concept in your minds that god had
[28:41] determined the time now in this
[28:43] dispensation there's this jewish church
[28:45] there's there's the mosaic all there's
[28:47] sacrifices there's priesthoods
[28:49] and these things are going to be in
[28:51] effect and he says that until a time
[28:54] appointed the father so in this
[28:56] dispensation god had appointed that
[28:58] these things would be in effect but only
[29:01] until a certain time
[29:03] and then once you reach that time once
[29:05] you come to that point and you've
[29:07] reached this time he says it comes to
[29:09] here and it goes no further so paul was
[29:12] saying in the fullness of time we've
[29:14] spanned this gap we finished the course
[29:17] we've done what god said we had to do
[29:19] during this time period but now it
[29:21] reaches to here and it goes no further
[29:23] so paul's looking like it's filled up
[29:25] it's over it's finished now he speaks by
[29:28] his son
[29:29] now he sent forth his son
[29:32] and romans 10 4 says for christ is the
[29:34] end of the law
[29:37] there it is right there christ christ is
[29:39] the end of the law it says for
[29:40] righteousness
[29:42] to everyone that believeth
[29:44] because you know jew could argue right
[29:46] now no we keep the law we keep the law
[29:49] but christ is the end of the law
[29:52] for everyone that believeth
[29:54] now
[29:56] the end there the word there means the
[29:59] aim
[30:01] the purpose
[30:03] the end to which all things relate
[30:05] he he is the end of the law in that the
[30:07] law was related to him
[30:10] christ was the aim of the law
[30:12] christ was the purpose of the law
[30:14] remember we read in romans 15 that he
[30:16] was the confirmation of the promises to
[30:18] the prophets christ came and confirmed
[30:20] the covenant confirmed the promises
[30:22] christ was the very scope and the very
[30:25] aim of the
[30:26] the very design of the law it spoke to
[30:29] that if even if you just look at it this
[30:31] way the law was given so man could just
[30:33] try to live and i know maybe in a little
[30:35] different context but the law in one
[30:38] sense just spoke the fact that you
[30:39] needed a christ
[30:41] you needed a sacrifice you needed a
[30:42] redeemer no matter how you look at it if
[30:44] you're looking at it in the right way
[30:46] from whatever perspective this you have
[30:47] to see christ because he is the very
[30:49] design of the law
[30:52] christ is the end of the law the law was
[30:54] given to israel the law was given to the
[30:55] jews in the fullness of time there was a
[30:57] there was a point where a dispensation
[30:59] had ended
[31:01] brother branham says in the message
[31:03] god's eye what a remarkable title
[31:06] and
[31:07] he's the scripture romans 15 8 says he
[31:09] came and confirmed these promises
[31:10] confirmation he says then as jesus
[31:12] confirmed
[31:16] listen we are making great time today
[31:18] you'll have plenty of time to avoid all
[31:20] the uh
[31:21] the the uh weed killer
[31:23] uh
[31:25] this afternoon because we're making
[31:27] great time
[31:28] but recognize just how peculiar the
[31:31] statement is jesus confirmed that
[31:33] guiding i being with him in the days
[31:34] when he revealed himself to the jews
[31:38] before the ending of that church age for
[31:40] the jews
[31:41] or their dispensation
[31:43] he manifested by looking through the eye
[31:44] of god
[31:46] now that's that's remarkable
[31:49] we need to catch that
[31:50] he just said jesus confirmed
[31:54] he's confirming something in the days
[31:55] when he revealed himself to the jews
[31:58] so he's someone in his first coming
[32:00] before the ending of that church age for
[32:01] the jews now i know it's terminology
[32:04] and before you start thinking well i
[32:05] need to find the seven church ages book
[32:07] for the jews well it's the old testament
[32:10] yes right it's already written out it's
[32:11] already laid out there but he says it's
[32:13] the internet church it's for the jews he
[32:14] says or their dispensation because in
[32:16] using a different language we have seven
[32:18] church ages but it's just a break up and
[32:21] ordering of the dispensation of the
[32:23] gentile church
[32:25] and so it's the ending of that church
[32:26] age for the jews or their dispensation
[32:30] you're catching the language he's using
[32:32] then in the invasion of the united
[32:33] states he says in the old testament if
[32:35] the lord willing maybe the coming
[32:36] services i'd like to show how that the
[32:38] seven church ages typed out in the old
[32:40] testament
[32:42] we who
[32:43] that's pretty neat
[32:45] how he could type out the old testament
[32:47] the seven church ages in the old
[32:49] testament how that they began just like
[32:51] exactly like in the beginning of the
[32:53] church ages of the gentile church and
[32:54] went right down through a similar dark
[32:56] age and come out into the glorious time
[32:58] of pentecost
[33:00] he said think about these things think
[33:01] about these this order think about all
[33:03] these different things that happen he
[33:04] said i'd like to maybe take some time in
[33:06] the coming services and even though
[33:08] there's no place i can specifically find
[33:10] where he took time to use that
[33:12] nomenclature and those words of first
[33:14] age second age third age fourth age he's
[33:17] certainly using a language that in the
[33:18] ending of the church age for the jews or
[33:20] the ending of the jewish dispensation
[33:22] it's the end of the law it's the end
[33:25] it's the fullness of times as it related
[33:27] to the scriptures of the that the
[33:28] prophets wrote in the old testament you
[33:30] could point out the seven church ages
[33:33] typed out
[33:36] i like that at the beginning just
[33:37] exactly like at the beginning of the
[33:38] church edge of the gentile church went
[33:40] right down through the similar dark age
[33:41] and come out in the glorious time of
[33:43] pentecost at the fallen of the holy
[33:44] spirit in the early church in the jewish
[33:47] dispensation
[33:49] so he's he's saying that you could go
[33:51] into the old testament
[33:52] and see the same pattern
[33:55] to israel that you see in the church
[33:58] same pattern we we have it and and
[34:02] keep this in mind because i'm definitely
[34:04] this is what i'm tracking is the the
[34:07] seven church ages that are given are all
[34:09] prophecy
[34:10] those are forward-looking
[34:13] now in first kings chapter 16 verses 30
[34:15] to 33 i'm just going to pull this out as
[34:17] an example because brother brandon
[34:18] points to it of how you can begin to
[34:20] identify certain characteristics
[34:24] and
[34:25] abe ahab king ahab brought israel into
[34:28] their dark ages
[34:29] by marrying idolatry by marrying jezebel
[34:32] and marrying this balaamism and
[34:34] babylonianism in with the jewish church
[34:36] and so just exactly what you see happen
[34:38] in the christian church it already
[34:40] happened foreshadowing it in the jewish
[34:43] church and how it they entered their
[34:45] dark age it was the darkest worst time
[34:47] for them it was they're going into the
[34:48] ground as you could say they enter their
[34:50] dark ages under ahab which is the type
[34:52] of the dark ages of the gentile church
[34:54] that dispensation again be thinking
[34:56] revelations chapter one to revelation
[34:57] chapter five you can think about that
[34:59] whole narrative that's in there for us
[35:01] so it says and ahab the son of omri did
[35:04] evil on the side of the lord above all
[35:05] that were before him
[35:07] this is the the depths this is the
[35:09] darkness and it came to pass as if it
[35:11] had been a light thing for him to walk
[35:13] in the sins of jeroboam the sons of the
[35:14] but that he took to wife jezebel the
[35:17] daughter of ethbol king of the zidonians
[35:20] and went and served baal and worshiped
[35:22] him and he reared up an altar for bail
[35:24] in the house of bell which he had built
[35:26] in samaria and ahab made a grove and
[35:29] ahab did more to provoke the lord god of
[35:32] israel to anger then to anger than all
[35:34] the kings of israel that were before him
[35:37] this is this is the dark ages for
[35:41] israel
[35:42] this is the depths of of
[35:45] of satan's work against israel this is
[35:47] in their church age or dispensation of
[35:50] the jews he says i'd like to show how
[35:52] the seventh church they just typed out
[35:53] in the old testament i want you to see
[35:55] this as a type
[35:56] so in the sermon why we are why are we
[35:59] not a denomination
[36:01] he says if you'll notice at the
[36:02] beginning when god began to deal with
[36:04] the jews
[36:05] and they went through the golden age
[36:08] and then the darkest age of the jewish
[36:10] dealings god had with the jews was in
[36:12] the ray of ahab and if you'll notice
[36:15] reading those church ages there he gets
[36:18] right back to it again
[36:20] he said now a few things ago he and said
[36:23] he says now right in that dark age and i
[36:26] realized that what he's referring to
[36:28] is he pointing to the revelations
[36:30] chapter two of three or is he pointing
[36:32] back to first kings which one is he
[36:34] pointing to well both
[36:37] because he's saying that the the the
[36:38] israel church had golden age dark ages
[36:41] and the jewish readings he says then
[36:43] reading those church ages there he gets
[36:45] right back to it again so it was in the
[36:47] old testament here it is in the new
[36:49] testament it says 1500 years there or
[36:51] the time of ahab first and the jews the
[36:54] darkest age they had when ahab married
[36:57] jezebel and brought idolatry into israel
[37:00] and made all the people worship after
[37:02] ahab after jezebel's god
[37:05] so he's referring it to as a dark age
[37:07] he's talking about they're even their
[37:08] church ages
[37:09] and and i doubt that anybody here maybe
[37:12] was doing it but man how would brother
[37:13] aaron even make that stretch that ahab
[37:16] represented the dark ages to israel as
[37:18] the dark ages were to the church well
[37:19] it's because brother bram said it and so
[37:22] maybe reserve judgment until you know
[37:23] that i don't have a quote
[37:26] he says right there he makes that direct
[37:28] connection this this is their dark ages
[37:31] so think of the pattern i want you just
[37:33] to recognize the pattern of god remember
[37:35] the whole uh emphasis in the beginning
[37:37] of how i am an open book was to
[37:39] recognize god's pattern of unfolding
[37:41] himself
[37:42] god's way of making himself known so
[37:44] it's not that we have to go back and
[37:45] find a strict church age and go oh well
[37:48] the first king 16 is the dark ages then
[37:51] then this king must have been a type of
[37:53] luther and this king this time period
[37:55] must have been a type of wesley don't
[37:56] try it
[37:58] it's not this strict thing where you try
[38:00] to break it out and come up with seven
[38:02] strict church ages but it's an actual
[38:04] dispensation what i'm wanting to
[38:05] recognize an actual dispensation that
[38:07] has a beginning and it has an end
[38:10] and it's a period of time where god is
[38:12] dealing with israel as if they were his
[38:13] church
[38:15] dealing with israel as his chosen people
[38:18] so my
[38:20] using this
[38:21] language
[38:23] i want to put it this way christ came at
[38:25] the end of their church ages
[38:28] the end of the jewish church ages he
[38:30] comes at the end of their church ages
[38:32] and reveals the mystery of god
[38:34] christ revealed god
[38:36] at the end of their ages
[38:38] when the fullness of time had come when
[38:40] the time was right the time appointed
[38:41] the father he sent forth his son to
[38:44] fulfill everything that was being
[38:46] foreshadowed and portrayed in the old
[38:48] testament
[38:50] but i said god was manifest himself
[38:52] before the ending of the jewish
[38:53] dispensation so here he is it's going to
[38:55] come to close it's going to end so here
[38:57] he is standing there at the close of the
[39:00] jewish church ages it's going to be
[39:01] finished paul's going to say at the
[39:02] fullness of it's come to this point it's
[39:04] going to end it's going to transition
[39:05] we're all going to get out of here he
[39:07] manifest himself before the end of it
[39:10] and would it be wrong to say
[39:13] that old testament became a new book
[39:14] when he came
[39:16] i don't think so
[39:18] now not everybody maybe people stood
[39:19] strong on their traditions and held to
[39:21] their prior theologies and wanted to
[39:23] keep their their their oral traditions
[39:25] they wanted to be i'm a strict
[39:26] constructionist it reads this it has to
[39:28] be this way
[39:29] and and so they just they they cabbage
[39:32] down on certain things but the old
[39:33] testament became a new book
[39:36] because god was manifest himself
[39:38] and brother branham says in sirs we
[39:40] would see jesus he says now in closing i
[39:42] might say this this brother bram i'm
[39:43] saying that
[39:44] don't put words in my mouth
[39:47] brother abraham is saying that
[39:49] we could stand here all night but we'd
[39:51] never get to the end of it because it's
[39:52] just the whole bible
[39:54] just hugged right around there
[39:56] now remember that was the end of the
[39:58] jewish dispensation in the samaritans
[40:00] he's talking about the days of christ
[40:02] the signs of the messiah the things
[40:03] christ was doing he's like oh we could
[40:05] stay here all night why because it's
[40:06] just the whole bible what christ was
[40:08] doing it he says it just hugs around
[40:11] there that was the end of the jewish
[40:12] dispensation and the samaritans
[40:15] and he's speaking of christ and he's
[40:17] referring to christ and his attributes
[40:18] his characteristics his ministry
[40:20] and i'm he says
[40:22] that settled the jewish dispensation
[40:26] that settled the jewish dispensation
[40:28] after they had years of theology and
[40:30] teaching
[40:32] christ settled
[40:33] after years of interpretation years of
[40:35] tradition years of theology years of
[40:37] schooling years of groups i mean think
[40:39] of how many groups they had you had
[40:40] scribes that wrote down you had
[40:41] pharisees that disagreed with the
[40:42] sadducees you had the zealots you had
[40:44] all sorts of denominations through
[40:47] israel's
[40:48] belief system
[40:49] some believed in the resurrection others
[40:51] didn't
[40:52] right a lot of different
[40:54] churches and church splits and and and
[40:56] ways that they viewed things and ways
[40:57] that they believed about the rapture and
[40:58] the resurrection ways that they viewed
[41:00] messiah they had all those messiahs
[41:02] there's a lot of parallels to the church
[41:04] he says they had years of theology and
[41:06] teaching but christ comes and he settles
[41:08] the jewish dispensation
[41:10] the end of all arguments
[41:14] he says now the church is
[41:16] his gentiles
[41:18] now it's coming to their end
[41:20] the fullness of time came for the jews
[41:22] there's going to be a fullness of time
[41:23] for the gentiles
[41:26] and paul says in romans 11 25 for i
[41:28] would not brethren that you should be
[41:29] ignorant of this mystery
[41:31] unless you should be wise in your own
[41:33] conceits that blindness in part is
[41:35] happened to israel
[41:37] until the fullness of the gentiles
[41:40] become in
[41:42] it's not a different
[41:44] concept or idea the fullness of gentiles
[41:46] because there was the fullness of the
[41:47] jewish dispensation
[41:49] paul's writing and it's a language that
[41:51] a jew
[41:52] would understand that we're going to
[41:54] have this time of bondage we have this
[41:55] time of prophets we have these times of
[41:57] kings but one day a messiah is coming
[41:59] he's going to enter in a glorious reign
[42:01] of a kingdom that will know no end and
[42:04] all people will come to his light and
[42:05] peace will reign upon the earth they
[42:07] knew one day
[42:09] come and change everything
[42:11] and so paul when he uses the phrase
[42:13] fullness of the gentiles it's the same
[42:16] fullness of times that the jews believed
[42:18] in but now he's kind of divided it to
[42:20] where we have the fullness of the jewish
[42:22] dispensation oh but now there's another
[42:24] one and it's the fullness of the
[42:26] gentiles to come in
[42:28] it's the filling up of the gentiles it
[42:30] speaks of another time appointed by god
[42:34] just as the old testament spoke of
[42:35] christ's first coming now the new
[42:37] testament is speaking of another
[42:39] manifestation of god another climax
[42:42] another culmination another capstone as
[42:44] christ came and capped and ended the
[42:46] jewish dispensation there's going to be
[42:48] the same thing happen in the ending of
[42:50] the gentile dispensation and then paul
[42:52] saying hey don't be ignorant of this
[42:54] mystery that in part israel was blinded
[42:56] so that god could bring forth a
[42:59] dispensation of his bride to have a
[43:02] bride of his own choosing
[43:04] one of the mysteries of the old
[43:05] testament the mystery of god
[43:09] and so now that speaks the new testament
[43:11] speaking of another manifestation of god
[43:14] look at it through first corinthians
[43:15] chapter 13
[43:17] verses 9 to 12.
[43:21] first corinthians 13 9-12
[43:25] for we know in part and we prophesy in
[43:27] part
[43:28] paul is not speaking as a jew
[43:31] under their dispensation he's speaking
[43:32] this at the dawning
[43:34] of this fullness of the the dispensation
[43:37] of the gentiles
[43:39] before we not prophesy in part but when
[43:41] that which is perfect has come is he
[43:43] prophesying
[43:44] is he pointing forward
[43:46] is he saying that some perfect income
[43:50] no
[43:51] he's not saying christ isn't perfect
[43:52] he's not saying the holy ghost isn't
[43:54] perfect he's looking at god's plan
[43:57] and fullness completion aim a purpose
[43:59] but when that which is perfect he's come
[44:01] then that which is in part shall be done
[44:02] away
[44:04] does that mean the parts go away
[44:07] or does it mean the parts are assumed
[44:08] into the hole
[44:11] the part goes away because now it's
[44:13] whole
[44:14] and now it has its purpose it has its
[44:16] aim you just you see something laying
[44:18] out there and you're like what is that
[44:19] well i don't know it's just a part
[44:21] and then you take the part and you put
[44:23] it where it belongs and guess what the
[44:24] parts done away with
[44:29] so beautiful
[44:31] he says when i was a child as fake as
[44:32] the child i understood as a child as a
[44:34] child but when i became a man i put away
[44:35] childish things so what is that maturity
[44:37] growing purpose placing an adoption even
[44:41] for the gentile church
[44:42] and then he says comes back to it again
[44:44] we know in part we prophesy in part now
[44:45] we see through a glass darkly a riddle a
[44:48] mystery a reflection we know what it is
[44:51] but we don't see it quite perfectly it's
[44:52] an enigma it's a puzzle to us but then
[44:55] face to face then it's going to be an
[44:56] open book then it's going to be clear
[44:58] and now but now i and then now i know in
[45:01] part but
[45:02] i know even as also i'm known
[45:07] he's he's he's pointing to another
[45:09] mystery he's pointing to another
[45:11] unfolding he's pointing to the fact that
[45:12] yes there's things we have things we
[45:14] believe things that are very real to us
[45:16] things that we anchor our faith and as
[45:18] being a perfect coming of christ that
[45:20] has ushered us into a new and living way
[45:22] forever consecrating for us a
[45:24] relationship with god that nobody has
[45:25] ever had before but now this new birth
[45:28] has borne inside of us a living hope and
[45:32] a living expectation that our life is
[45:34] not merely to soldier and here for our
[45:36] days and then die and go into a grave
[45:39] and that cycle's not just to repeat
[45:41] itself until mankind completely
[45:43] abolishes himself and then god's gonna
[45:44] raise us all back up again but we're all
[45:46] building to a climactic end when one day
[45:49] even those that sleep are gonna be
[45:51] resurrected and even there will be
[45:52] people who are alive and remain and are
[45:55] changed in a moment in the twinkling of
[45:57] an eye he says that's what the new birth
[45:59] brings up inside of you a hope and an
[46:01] expectation
[46:04] just as a circumcision to the jews
[46:06] prophesied i'm part of a people i'm part
[46:08] of a country i'm part of a land that the
[46:10] redeemer is going to come to we too have
[46:12] the same experience actually
[46:16] so i'll say this the new testament must
[46:18] be opened
[46:20] in the same way
[46:22] that this mystery laid hidden
[46:25] and the old testament and christ came as
[46:28] a manifestation of it and declared it
[46:30] at the climax of their church ages
[46:33] then the seals upon this book must be
[46:35] loosed to bring forth full life
[46:38] was god with him yes he said he would be
[46:40] with them
[46:41] was god manifest himself was god
[46:42] speaking yes he did all those things but
[46:45] he had made a promise
[46:47] and when he fulfilled his promise
[46:49] it was the word of life that was
[46:50] manifested
[46:52] something broke
[46:54] something was opened up even there said
[46:56] there's gonna be a fountain opened
[46:59] gonna be living water it's gonna be
[47:01] bread of life
[47:02] it was an open up that which had been
[47:04] damped up that which had been sealed
[47:05] that access they couldn't have
[47:07] that would be the
[47:09] maybe one of the hearts cry of a jew i
[47:11] would just want to see god
[47:13] maybe when they sat around eating dates
[47:15] and uh
[47:16] and
[47:17] and fellowshipping they said oh man i
[47:20] just if i could have one thing i just
[47:21] want to see god
[47:24] and then the subject kind of changes
[47:25] says you never believe who i saw
[47:27] yesterday
[47:28] oh son of joseph
[47:31] out there rant you'll never believe what
[47:33] he had to say and this was what their
[47:34] dream would have been just want to see
[47:36] god
[47:37] and he starts using a language to the
[47:39] his disciples those closest to him when
[47:41] you've seen me
[47:42] now wouldn't that i if and i'm just
[47:45] sharing my heart with you
[47:47] maybe personally i just want to maybe
[47:48] make this like just myself
[47:50] trying to grasp this
[47:52] because i realize in preaching this this
[47:54] isn't just you know um it's the learning
[47:57] vowels
[47:59] there's there's something to this this
[48:01] isn't memorization this is this is just
[48:03] not repeating things that have been
[48:04] preached before this is trying to trying
[48:07] to grasp the greatness of god and what
[48:09] he's done for us
[48:11] and
[48:12] there's
[48:13] there's maybe you've experienced it in
[48:15] this way i just think myself that when
[48:16] somebody sees something
[48:18] maybe you're you're out on a hike and
[48:20] you're you're hiking and you're there at
[48:22] the
[48:23] the steps of her
[48:24] and and you're in this very rigorous
[48:27] hike you've been training for all
[48:28] morning
[48:30] and someone says oh my you see that ram
[48:32] over there
[48:33] like what a ram no it's just right over
[48:36] there it's not on that not only so it's
[48:38] the next one over and i had a friend
[48:39] text me a picture of a ram that he saw
[48:41] it wasn't on this desk but nearby he was
[48:43] on a hard hike and he saw he saw a ram
[48:47] there i mean it's a big horn sheep it
[48:49] looked like it's like what's this thing
[48:50] doing here you pranking me it wasn't
[48:51] april 1st
[48:52] and he said he saw it you know if you
[48:54] were ever in a situation where someone
[48:55] stan says do you see that out there
[48:58] and you go
[49:00] no i don't see it
[49:01] like no it's right there then when you
[49:03] know it's there
[49:06] and you believe them and you don't think
[49:08] they're just playing tricks on you're
[49:09] like
[49:10] wait i want to see it
[49:12] no show me where it's at no is it on
[49:14] this is it by this trees like that and
[49:16] you all said you get very interested
[49:18] like no i i don't i don't see it i
[49:20] understand that and there's situations
[49:21] in our lives where maybe someone tells
[49:23] us no do you see it and all of a sudden
[49:25] we get very concerned and very
[49:28] interested in seeing what they see
[49:30] or seeing what we want to see
[49:33] and and that's what i think it might
[49:35] have done in the heart of philip he says
[49:37] oh just show us the father
[49:39] and he said i am the father philip said
[49:42] from this moment on a purpose in my
[49:44] heart that if i'm gonna see anything i'm
[49:46] gonna see my father revealed in his son
[49:50] if i'm gonna get anything out of my days
[49:52] with him as a master and as a teacher
[49:54] let me see what he said he could show me
[49:57] that if i see him let me see the father
[49:59] listen don't get frustrated if you
[50:01] haven't seen it don't get frustrated if
[50:02] you don't understand it if the word of
[50:04] god tells you he's here to reveal
[50:06] himself and you haven't seen it then
[50:08] just get serious about it and say oh god
[50:11] let me see it
[50:13] if you haven't felt him if he moved if
[50:15] you see signs
[50:17] five signs and what miracles get
[50:20] frustrated don't doubt it just get
[50:22] serious about it and say if you're
[50:24] showing yourself i want to see you
[50:27] maybe let me get critical
[50:29] did you feel the move of god if you
[50:31] didn't feel it we just get critical ah
[50:32] nothing to it
[50:34] a bunch of fanatics well hold on slow
[50:36] down
[50:38] if it's god don't you want to see it
[50:40] amen
[50:43] here he is
[50:45] the book is being made alive
[50:48] and you can tell hey jews the books
[50:49] being made alive
[50:51] all that there would be a seed inside of
[50:53] one
[50:54] to say then i want to see it
[50:56] even if you don't see it i don't see it
[50:57] i don't understand it doesn't make sense
[50:59] to me i've been hearing i've been
[51:00] listening to it i've tried to study it
[51:01] try to figure it out but it keeps saying
[51:03] it over and over again if there's just
[51:04] something inside of you says it's there
[51:06] and you want it
[51:08] then get serious about it to god i want
[51:10] to see it
[51:13] now remember when we
[51:15] we read this i think it was part one
[51:17] souls that are in prison now
[51:20] the end of the church ages
[51:22] revealed the mystery of god
[51:24] that fulfilled the old testament we read
[51:26] at the very start of this service
[51:29] that's the old testament and he says
[51:31] there's a new peace to be fulfilled
[51:34] it's the new testament but it says when
[51:36] the seventh were opened that opened up
[51:38] the entire bible
[51:40] seven says it was sealed with seven
[51:41] mysteries and in these seven seals held
[51:44] the entire mystery of it
[51:46] he says and it was the book of
[51:47] redemption and then he says new
[51:48] testament not the old
[51:51] because there's a redemption to israel
[51:53] that that there's even still
[51:55] uh even in the 70 weeks daniel
[51:57] prophesies there's promises still to
[51:59] israel that's been interrupted that he's
[52:01] going to come back to but he can't do it
[52:02] until what we leave
[52:05] he says it only proclaimed for the new
[52:07] testament the revelation of the mystery
[52:09] of god the seven seals the open of that
[52:10] book held the entire mystery of if i
[52:13] could say this of the new testament now
[52:15] it's also in the old but what was the
[52:17] aim
[52:19] the name of the new testament wasn't to
[52:20] lift up and to promote the old testament
[52:25] it comes in the fulfillment of it it's
[52:27] the amplification of it
[52:29] old testament now is part of the new
[52:32] it took the old to foreshow the do
[52:35] it's the new that comes out of the old
[52:37] just as here christ comes the
[52:39] fulfillment of the old testament
[52:41] out of christ comes the bride now the
[52:43] christ comes the new testament so you
[52:44] can't separate them up and does that
[52:46] well this one belongs on blogs are there
[52:48] they're beautiful together but in the
[52:50] open of the seals what becomes a new
[52:52] book
[52:54] what that relates to us is this new
[52:56] testament book of redemption
[53:00] in the harvest time i'm just reading
[53:01] some quotations here to close
[53:03] brother braham says as noah moses and
[53:06] david reflected the coming of this
[53:07] perfect bridegroom
[53:10] so has luther wesley and pentecost
[53:12] reflected the coming of a perfect bride
[53:15] can be written into planer
[53:17] and
[53:18] if you could have just read that at the
[53:19] beginning we'd all be at chipotle right
[53:21] now
[53:30] noah moses david
[53:33] line them up
[53:35] isaiah jeremiah
[53:37] all of them reflected becoming a perfect
[53:40] bridegroom
[53:42] so has luther wesley and pentecost
[53:44] reflected the coming of a perfect bride
[53:48] in the old testament
[53:49] we read their names
[53:52] but in the new testament
[53:53] we read the symbols
[53:56] the jewish dispensation symbols we could
[53:58] see a golden age
[54:00] in the gospels
[54:02] we can say the institute we can see
[54:04] christ and the precious promises being
[54:06] given in the writings of paul and peter
[54:08] and john we see this new scroll being
[54:11] written
[54:12] new promises being given and then in the
[54:15] last book the book of revelation it
[54:17] tells us what's going to happen
[54:23] church isn't so much of a historical
[54:25] record which the old testament was
[54:28] we're given the prophecies and the
[54:30] symbols of our dispensation of our
[54:32] church ages in revelation
[54:35] and he says then luther wesley pentecost
[54:38] even those church ages reflect the
[54:39] coming of a perfect bride what another
[54:42] golden age
[54:44] another capstone age
[54:47] and
[54:50] it was the stubborn traditions
[54:53] of the jews that kept them from seeing
[54:56] the end of their
[54:57] that it kept him veiled at the end of
[54:59] their ages
[55:01] they were so staunch in the way that it
[55:03] had to be they were so adamant about
[55:05] what it would look like
[55:06] it was their stubborn traditions that
[55:09] they were so tied to and and took so
[55:12] much personal ownership of
[55:15] that and and pride
[55:17] of authoring ideas well we figured it
[55:20] out and it's going to be this way
[55:22] and and you can get you take so much so
[55:24] much ownership that's one of the um one
[55:26] of the dangers and getting very quick to
[55:29] defend certain things
[55:30] is you take ownership of a thought you
[55:32] take ownership of a position and an idea
[55:34] and you make it very very hard for your
[55:36] mind to ever change even in the presence
[55:38] of evidence that says you are wrong
[55:42] and that's exactly what they did
[55:44] they just were no they were so just
[55:46] latched onto it and it was their
[55:48] traditions and their ideas and their
[55:50] concepts that veiled him at the end of
[55:53] the jewish church ages
[55:55] did not has it not happened again
[55:57] amen
[55:58] brother says in looking under jesus
[55:59] that's the very reason that jesus was
[56:01] not understood when he came up to the
[56:02] earth
[56:03] if they would have only looked into the
[56:05] word of god
[56:07] instead of their tradition of that day
[56:09] they would have known he was the son of
[56:11] god
[56:16] glad it's up there so you could see this
[56:17] the bible plainly declared
[56:20] his full coming
[56:23] the bible plainly declared his full
[56:26] coming
[56:26] and he come in the full revelation of
[56:28] the word that's the old testament
[56:30] right the bible plainly declared his
[56:33] full coming and he come in the full
[56:35] revelation of the word so there's a
[56:37] written word
[56:38] that prophesied it now he comes and he
[56:41] plainly declares the spoken word plainly
[56:44] declaring the written word and it's the
[56:46] written word that becomes the living
[56:47] word there's how he's the full
[56:49] manifestation or the full revelation of
[56:52] their scrolls and of their scriptures so
[56:54] the revelation has to come
[56:56] he says and each generation reveals him
[57:00] in the full revelation that's lauded for
[57:02] that time
[57:03] i mean i love this what's that what's
[57:05] the revelation for our time
[57:08] we know that luther sanctification we
[57:10] could think or justification we could
[57:11] think of
[57:12] of wesley in sanctification we could
[57:14] think of other other ages that had some
[57:17] law something measured out to them some
[57:19] disposition he says this generation
[57:22] jesus christ
[57:24] that's revelation of him that's promised
[57:26] in the word must be revealed to this
[57:29] generation
[57:31] if the churches won't receive it
[57:33] somebody will rise up and do it
[57:36] and the churches didn't receive it and
[57:38] somebody has risen up to do it to what
[57:41] receive the full revelation if i could
[57:44] put it this way not just receive the
[57:46] full revelation but reveal it to this
[57:48] generation
[57:50] the churches can't do it but the bride
[57:53] has risen to what revealed jesus christ
[57:56] to this generation
[57:59] because that's what her calling is
[58:01] musicians please come
[58:04] my last statement is this
[58:07] and in this
[58:08] age
[58:10] laodicean
[58:13] the revelation of god will come in its
[58:16] due time
[58:18] it will not falter neither will it be
[58:21] premature
[58:23] think on this and heat it well
[58:25] if we are in the end time today
[58:28] i love it
[58:29] think on this and heat it well
[58:31] because we're in the end time today
[58:34] what does he want us to think about that
[58:36] the revelation of god will come in its
[58:38] due time
[58:39] he did well because it won't fail
[58:43] it won't be premature it may seem like
[58:44] oh where it took forever it took forever
[58:46] he said but it'll be there
[58:48] the revelation of god will come in its
[58:50] due time
[58:52] and then think about christ
[58:54] he come in the full revelation of the
[58:56] word and each generation reveals him in
[58:58] the full revelation that's lauded for
[58:59] this he says this generation must
[59:02] reveal
[59:03] jesus
[59:04] christ
[59:06] and somebody will rise up and do it
[59:09] because the revelation of god will come
[59:13] amen
[59:15] let's stand together
