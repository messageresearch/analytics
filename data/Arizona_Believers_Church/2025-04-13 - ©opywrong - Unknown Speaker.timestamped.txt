[0:00] Numbers chapter
[0:01] 32:es
[0:04] 5-15. Wherefore said they, if we have
[0:07] found grace in thy sight, let this land
[0:10] be given unto thy servants for
[0:11] possession, and bring us not over
[0:14] Jordan. So this is Reuben and Gad
[0:16] requesting that they not in dwell in
[0:19] God's promised land where he said he
[0:20] would dwell. And so in my Bible, this
[0:23] Thompson chain, the heading is do not
[0:25] bring God's wrath. And so Moses says in
[0:27] verse 6, "And Moses said unto the
[0:29] children of Gadon, to the children of
[0:30] Reuben, shall your brethren go to war,
[0:32] and shall ye sit here? And wherefore
[0:34] discourage ye the heart of the children
[0:35] of Israel from going over into the land
[0:37] which the Lord hath given them? Thus did
[0:39] your fathers when I sent them from Kades
[0:41] Barnea to see the land? For when they
[0:43] went up unto the valley of Escow, and
[0:45] saw the land, they discouraged the heart
[0:47] of the children of Israel that they
[0:49] should not go into the land which the
[0:51] Lord had given them." And the Lord's
[0:53] anger was kindled the same time, and
[0:56] swear, saying, "Surely none of the men
[0:58] that came up out of Egypt from 20 years
[1:01] and upward shall see the land which I
[1:03] swear unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto
[1:05] Jacob, because they have not," notice
[1:07] this, wholly followed me, save Caleb,
[1:10] the son of Jeffa, the Kennesite, and
[1:13] Joshua, the son of Nun. For they have
[1:15] wholly followed the Lord. Brother Rowan,
[1:18] you could appreciate this. Joshua had no
[1:21] father or mother because he's the son of
[1:23] none. Yeah. For they have wholly
[1:25] followed the Lord. And the Lord's anger
[1:27] was kindled against Israel. And he made
[1:29] them wonder in the wilderness 40 years
[1:31] until all the generation that had done
[1:33] evil in the sight of the Lord was
[1:34] consumed. And behold, notice how
[1:37] remarkable this is. You are risen up in
[1:40] your father'sstead. You have resurrected
[1:43] as a replacement of your fathers and a
[1:46] increase of sinful men to augment yet
[1:48] the fierce anger of the Lord toward
[1:50] Israel. For if you turn away from after
[1:52] him, he will yet again leave them in the
[1:54] wilderness and ye shall destroy all this
[1:58] people. My so so remarkable. Just trust
[2:02] that God could anoint these words to us,
[2:04] make them alive by revelation. You can
[2:06] be seated.
[2:09] I'm going to try to go slowly today and
[2:11] you're going to have to bear with me as
[2:13] I stumble through some opening things
[2:15] just to kind of peel back the curtain a
[2:17] little bit on where my mind's at and
[2:19] where we've been looking at this. For
[2:20] some of our visitors here who uh haven't
[2:23] been with us in the the series through
[2:25] the year to this point, we've been using
[2:26] different concepts in art and artwork
[2:28] and God is the ultimate artist. Just
[2:30] using these themes as a way of grasping
[2:32] principles of God's word, making them
[2:34] applicable today. My main uh theme has
[2:37] been what does Christ look like today in
[2:40] this uh 21st century that we're not uh
[2:42] we don't try to mimic ourselves after a
[2:45] first century believer what they would
[2:47] look like then but we want to be Christ
[2:48] today so that he can be recognized he
[2:50] can be handled and he can be felt and
[2:53] using a little bit of a play on words.
[2:56] This is a good dad joke but my title
[2:57] today is
[2:58] copyright. And I'm using just kind of
[3:01] the inverse of copyright. We're all
[3:03] familiar with copyright as it relates to
[3:05] the message. If you want to just even
[3:08] search out uh copy, copy and copyright
[3:11] in the message. Brother says a lot of
[3:12] good things about the work of the devil.
[3:15] Uh he says the work of the devil is
[3:17] trying to copy the work of the Lord. So
[3:18] that's that's uh at the heart of some of
[3:22] the things I'm looking at. And in the
[3:24] last few services, we've been looking at
[3:26] how unbelief can copy faith. Uh someone
[3:30] was sharing with me uh recently how they
[3:32] just learned what carbon copy means and
[3:35] and what blind carbing copy means. Was
[3:37] that was that us talking about that or
[3:39] that was me? Okay. Yeah, that trying to
[3:41] remember who that was. That was my
[3:42] little brother that he was 46 years old
[3:46] before he learned what CC meant. And but
[3:49] unbelief copies belief and in copying
[3:53] belief it becomes make believe. So
[3:56] there's three kinds of believers. But in
[3:58] that in that description of them,
[4:00] there's those that truly believe, then
[4:01] there's those that don't believe. But
[4:03] the makebeliever is really someone who
[4:04] doesn't believe pretending to believe.
[4:07] And so make believe is the wrong is is
[4:10] incorrect by copying uh and
[4:13] impersonating faith but not really
[4:15] possessing it. And I there's times when
[4:17] we being ordained to faith and go faith
[4:21] is a gift of God that within ourselves
[4:23] we can operate as an unbeliever and then
[4:25] within ourselves we can operate as a
[4:27] makebeliever but God has given you the
[4:29] gift of faith and that's where you want
[4:31] to operate and live within. So it's not
[4:33] so much trying to come up with a
[4:35] paradigm to judge others by but tools to
[4:38] overcome within ourselves. And so, put
[4:41] yourself in the word of God as we go
[4:42] through these examples because we're
[4:44] wanting us to we're wanting to learn uh
[4:47] the word of God, the promises to us so
[4:49] that we can overcome the time that we're
[4:50] living in. And how many here are
[4:52] familiar with legally what a copyright
[4:55] is? So, good. So, you don't need a
[4:57] lawyer to explain this to you, but it's
[4:59] a type of intellectual property that
[5:01] protects original works of authorship as
[5:04] soon as the author fixes the work in a
[5:06] tangible form of expression. So instead
[5:09] of you don't necessarily need to file
[5:10] for copyright protection but whenever
[5:12] there's an original work an artist a
[5:15] writer a musician a painter has created
[5:17] an original work as soon as they fix it
[5:19] in some tangible form of expression
[5:21] there is laws in our land that uh
[5:24] protect that original work. And so if a
[5:28] work is copyrighted then you cannot use
[5:29] it without the permission of the owner
[5:32] the artist the the author of that. And
[5:34] if you use it then they could enforce
[5:36] certain rights against you. Now I know
[5:39] all of you are thinking but what about
[5:40] the fair use doctrine brother Aaron and
[5:42] yes there is uh limited use of portions
[5:46] of a work that you can uh replicate or
[5:49] you could present or you could use. You
[5:51] can have limited use of portions of a
[5:52] work for certain purposes. And I'm
[5:55] wanting you to begin to look at it this
[5:56] way where there is uh this is going to
[5:59] really speak to some people, but uh
[6:01] there can be an original work and then
[6:04] there's fanfiction that's derived from
[6:06] it. I know you're all you know exactly
[6:07] what I'm talking about. And as long as
[6:09] it's not for commercial purposes, it's
[6:11] absolutely protected under fair use. And
[6:14] so what we have many times in
[6:17] Christianity is a fictional faith and
[6:20] it's fanfiction about the word of God
[6:23] about Christianity and about things of
[6:24] God without actually being the word of
[6:28] God. Brother Brandham said that
[6:29] Christian Christianity had become like
[6:31] little kids in school and how that
[6:34] they're trying to copy off the other and
[6:37] if the other's wrong then the whole
[6:38] thing is wrong and you have a whole
[6:41] bunch of them wrong. And he says, "Don't
[6:42] copy. Meet him yourself." And so he
[6:45] says, "Christianity has become copies.
[6:48] We're just copying off of somebody else.
[6:50] We're just doing what somebody else has
[6:51] done." And so in copying something that
[6:54] is right, we become copy wrong.
[6:57] We become wrong just by copying. Now, to
[7:00] make this a little bit more relevant,
[7:02] what I'm looking at and exploring is the
[7:04] subjects of the perfect will of God and
[7:07] the permissive will of God. And I'm
[7:09] hoping this is a way for us to further
[7:11] understand the difference between those
[7:13] two and what it means to be in the
[7:16] perfect will of God or to fulfill the
[7:18] perfect will of God versus being in the
[7:20] permissive will because we have that
[7:21] understanding. There's the permissive
[7:23] will and sometimes we're very particular
[7:26] that well I wasn't supposed to go do
[7:29] that but God allowed me to do it and I
[7:31] was just in his perfect his permissive
[7:33] will as some sort of loop. And we think
[7:35] very specifically about actual
[7:37] instances, but there's a way that we
[7:39] could be in the permissive and it's not
[7:42] as perfect in that there is an original
[7:44] word of God and what we're in is in a
[7:46] copy.
[7:48] We're we're in something that looks like
[7:50] uh um what's right or it looks like what
[7:52] we should be doing, but it's not
[7:53] actually what we should be doing. Now in
[7:55] Romans 12:2 it says, "And be not
[7:58] conformed to this world, but be ye
[8:01] transformed by the renewing of your
[8:03] mind, that ye may prove what is that
[8:07] good and acceptable and perfect will of
[8:11] God." So, Brother Brandham, I'm saying
[8:14] having been saved as we have and filled
[8:15] with the Holy Ghost as we have, we want
[8:17] to be transformed by the word of God, by
[8:19] the renewing of our mind to prove into
[8:22] that perfect will of God. So that's
[8:24] where we're at now as sealed believers
[8:26] is this transformation process into
[8:29] perfection. So we're to to prove that
[8:32] means to recognize as genuine after
[8:35] examination to approve or to deem
[8:37] worthy. When somebody submits an
[8:39] application for copyright protection, it
[8:41] goes through an examination process. You
[8:43] submit a proof and it's examined to
[8:45] determine whether or not there is
[8:47] original authorship. Whether or not this
[8:49] is something that passes the muster of
[8:51] being an original work of authorship
[8:54] that's in a tangible form of expression.
[8:56] So we are to prove what is that good and
[8:58] acceptable. A lot in those words, a
[9:00] mouthful in those words, a lot of deep
[9:02] meaning. It says and perfect will of
[9:04] God. That perfect there is of full age.
[9:07] It would speak of maturity to be brought
[9:10] to its end or finished. If something is
[9:12] perfect, it lacks nothing to be
[9:15] complete. Amen. So, we're to prove not
[9:18] just what is God's perfect will in
[9:20] certain instances or not just this is
[9:22] what God wanted me to do, but in this
[9:24] overall expression of God, we want to
[9:26] prove what is that perfect and complete
[9:30] will of God. As we know, even in the
[9:32] millennium, the bride and Christ will
[9:34] fulfill all that the man and the woman
[9:36] did not fulfill in the garden. There's
[9:38] to be a fulfillment, a completion, a
[9:39] summation of all of God's purposes and
[9:42] his will. So, we are to prove to prove
[9:46] to demonstrate this to deem worthy and
[9:49] to approve the perfect will of God. So,
[9:52] the perfect will of God, it's God's
[9:54] original complete works. It's what God
[9:56] originally intended with a very specific
[9:59] purpose, a very specific fixed form of
[10:01] expression. As there have been, there
[10:03] was one Christ, one Messiah, then many
[10:06] other copies or duplicates. So there was
[10:08] only one that was the perfect will of
[10:10] God. But the permissive will so we I
[10:12] think we know a lot the perfect will of
[10:14] God is his word. So what is his desire
[10:16] his there's a when God does something he
[10:18] has a reason why he's doing it. God
[10:20] pours out his spirit to accomplish
[10:22] something. He sends a message to
[10:23] demonstrate something to bring to people
[10:25] to a faith and then there that's his
[10:27] specific work. And then there can be a
[10:29] lot of benefits and blessings that come
[10:30] along with it. But that's not what his
[10:33] perfect will was to accomplish this. And
[10:36] there's a lot of things that he permits
[10:37] or allows in the process. So a
[10:40] permissive will is something that isn't
[10:42] part of that specific work or that
[10:45] complete work. Something that falls
[10:48] short somehow. It's outside of the
[10:49] frame. It's incomplete or just only
[10:51] partially accurate. Similac might be one
[10:55] way we could say where it's a copy of
[10:56] something that is original. It's a
[11:00] simulation of belief. It's simulated
[11:02] faith. So there's those that genuinely
[11:04] believe and there's others that are a
[11:07] similacra or a simulation or a copy of
[11:10] something genuine. And brother Bram says
[11:12] all of Christianity's become similacra.
[11:18] So God in his permissive will I think
[11:22] this is a real key point here that he
[11:24] will permit or allow the copy.
[11:28] He will allow the use of or the copy of
[11:31] his original work that's outside of his
[11:32] specific plan, outside of his elective
[11:35] plan, outside of that full expression
[11:37] and purpose. Why does God allow things
[11:41] to happen even divine healing and
[11:43] raising of the dead? Why would he allow
[11:45] it in circles where people deny the
[11:48] oneness of God? Why would he allow
[11:51] genuine signs and wonders in places
[11:52] where even maybe in a ministry where a
[11:54] man is unfaithful and living in sin and
[11:57] some of the things that we see in
[11:58] nominal Christianity and right within
[12:00] the message, signs and wonders and
[12:01] demonstrations, God permits it and God
[12:04] allows it. He could just stop it,
[12:08] right? God could just do things to where
[12:10] it's like, well, you know, whenever you
[12:12] see that, that's absolutely that's where
[12:14] God's at. Absolutely 100%. But that's
[12:17] not always how God does this. And so,
[12:19] Brother Brandham says in the sermon,
[12:20] "The seed shall not be heir with the
[12:22] shock." The kingdom of God which is in
[12:24] the earth today, and the kingdom says,
[12:27] "Amen." That's us. That's who we are.
[12:29] Which is in the earth today can never be
[12:31] set up justly or rightly correctly can
[12:33] never be set up on a permissive will.
[12:37] It's got to come back to his perfect
[12:39] will. Amen. I don't know if you recall
[12:41] when we've ministered on divine healing
[12:43] and signs and signs and those different
[12:45] things that there's many things that God
[12:48] allows in with respect to signs and
[12:50] wonders and miracles and divine healing
[12:52] even that is permissive will. But then
[12:54] there's perfect will. Amen. You've got
[12:56] to come back to perfect will. It can
[12:59] never be set up on permissive will. It's
[13:01] got to come back he says to his perfect
[13:04] will. Kingdom is established on the full
[13:07] word of God. Amen.
[13:10] the original complete works. It's got to
[13:12] be the complete. It's got to come out
[13:13] into the
[13:16] complete. So now if you'll look at I I
[13:19] don't have this, brother John, brother
[13:20] Jack, I apologize in these notes here. I
[13:23] didn't have this in my notes, but 1
[13:24] Corinthians chapter
[13:27] 10 verses
[13:29] 1-6. I just like to read this quickly as
[13:32] we transition to the Exodus again. And
[13:34] I'm reading this so that we can have
[13:35] this perspective that as we go through
[13:38] in great detail the the Exodus and I
[13:40] just I have a number of scriptures in
[13:42] front of me and I just want to walk
[13:43] through the stories in Numbers 32 and
[13:45] Numbers 14 again uh and kind of like the
[13:47] spirit and the origin behind it and it
[13:49] may seem like man you're just reading a
[13:50] lot of historical things. Oh, it's good
[13:52] to learn good to know where the
[13:54] scriptures are coming from and what it
[13:55] has to say. So there's even a benefit in
[13:57] that without this context. But I want
[13:59] this to be your context because we need
[14:01] to learn in this third Exodus the things
[14:04] that the devil was doing in the first
[14:06] Exodus that kept certain ones from
[14:09] experiencing the transformation so that
[14:11] we can receive the full inheritance.
[14:14] I believe that there's many that are
[14:16] filled with the spirit of God that go by
[14:18] way of the grave. And that is no defeat.
[14:21] But that last victory is going to be
[14:23] those that are alive and remain. And I
[14:25] want to be a part of that and I don't
[14:27] want to fall short of that. And so as I
[14:29] have my mind on that goal of living to
[14:32] the meeting in the air, I I want to
[14:34] recognize all those little things that
[14:35] could hinder me from being there. Amen.
[14:37] Maybe not take me out of the body of
[14:39] Christ, but hinder me from being there.
[14:41] So it says, "Moreover, brethren, I would
[14:42] not that ye should be ignorant. How that
[14:44] all our fathers were under the cloud and
[14:47] all passed through the sea and were all
[14:49] baptized unto Moses in the cloud in the
[14:51] sea." Did I give you 1 Corinthians 10:es
[14:54] 1-6? And did all eat the same spiritual
[14:57] meat? And did all drink the same
[14:59] spiritual drink? For they drank of that
[15:01] spiritual rock.
[15:04] Amen. I I'm not going to have the time
[15:06] today to go through it completely, but
[15:07] in uh Deuteronomy 32, and even my
[15:09] brother David mentioned it when I was
[15:11] fellowshipping with him on Friday where
[15:13] in the Exodus it says, "And your rock,
[15:15] capital R, is not their rock, little R."
[15:18] So think of the things they're following
[15:20] and they're fellowshipping in and what
[15:22] they're part of. That spiritual rock
[15:23] that followed them and the rock capital
[15:25] R was Christ. But it says, "But in with
[15:28] many of them, God was not well pleased
[15:31] for they were overthrown in the
[15:33] wilderness." So there was those that did
[15:35] not overcome in the wilderness. What
[15:37] happens in the wilderness uh kept them
[15:40] from entering into the promised land.
[15:42] And then Paul just gives us the context.
[15:44] Now these things were our examples to
[15:47] the intent we should not lust after evil
[15:50] things as they also lusted
[15:53] that and in that day how many of them do
[15:55] you think had a cell phone with no
[15:58] filters? How many of them think they had
[16:00] there was Jebusites and kinazites and
[16:03] all sorts of other zites? How many of
[16:04] them had websites? Right. What was it
[16:07] they were trying to overcome in that
[16:09] day? And it's it'll be very clear
[16:10] there's a spirit that is the ultimate
[16:13] power against the believer. Says these
[16:15] were our examples to the intent we
[16:17] should not lust after evil things as
[16:19] they also lusted. What it was was
[16:21] unbelief was at the heart of why they
[16:23] were overthrown. We learned from the
[16:24] scripture that they perished in the
[16:26] wilderness through unbelief. Amen. That
[16:29] is the ultimate sin.
[16:32] That is the sin is the sin of unbelief.
[16:35] Now let's look at Joshua chapter 32.
[16:38] Excuse me. Joshua chapter 13 verse 32.
[16:43] And I'm going way too slow today if I'm
[16:45] going to finish, but we'll I will
[16:47] finish, but I may not be able to get it
[16:49] to everything that I want to. But let's
[16:51] just look at this together. Joshua
[16:52] chapter 13 verse 32. Just summarizing
[16:55] some things here for you on the slide.
[16:57] These are the countries which Moses
[16:59] Moses did distribute for inheritance to
[17:02] Reuben, Gad, and the half a tribe of
[17:04] Manasseh. So those are the these are who
[17:06] they distribute them to. The in this is
[17:09] the description that God wants us to
[17:10] zero in on the plains of Moab on the
[17:13] other side of Jordan by Jericho
[17:16] eastward. And each one of these
[17:19] descriptions highlights a characteristic
[17:22] or an aspect of where they chose to
[17:24] settle. It's associated with Moab. It's
[17:26] associated to the other side of Jordan.
[17:29] It's associated with Jericho. And it's
[17:31] associated with eastern which brother
[17:32] Ram says east. that that represents a
[17:34] religious move and mo so the choice of
[17:38] these two and a half tribes is
[17:40] associated with these things wrong side
[17:42] of Jordan each one of these elements
[17:43] here and Moab means seed of his father
[17:46] and Moab is the son of Lot so Moab is
[17:50] the offspring of a makeeliever yeah
[17:52] that's right he's the offspring not of
[17:54] Abraham but he's an offspring h he's an
[17:59] offspring of Lot who has some
[18:00] relationship to Abraham some nearness to
[18:03] the promise, some nearness to the
[18:05] journey. But then there comes this
[18:07] dividing point between Abraham and Lot.
[18:09] And there's something that's exposed in
[18:11] Lot's desires that show he was he didn't
[18:14] mind. He he wanted to have the
[18:16] relationship with Abraham, but he he had
[18:18] it he had a different inheritance. Moab
[18:20] represents that denominational uh
[18:22] condition or spirit that do not wholly
[18:26] follow the Lord. That's right. That's
[18:28] the key there. Brother Brandham said the
[18:30] Moabites knew the truth whether they
[18:31] lived up to it or not. They know it.
[18:34] They know it whether or not they live up
[18:36] to it. And so what we see when we saw
[18:38] last time and and if you want to just
[18:40] kind of jot this down in a margin
[18:42] somewhere, kind of highlight it because
[18:44] I'm just bringing this back from last
[18:45] Sunday. They're cut out of the picture
[18:47] when they're not framed in the promised
[18:49] land. We saw how that they become just a
[18:50] a they they're hardly ever mentioned
[18:53] again, right? uh and they're the first
[18:55] ones that get that mention getting
[18:56] carried away and they're the ones uh and
[18:58] there's just a couple instances really
[18:59] where it mentions them as a whole and
[19:01] it's not in a positive light. So there's
[19:03] hardly any mention of it again. What
[19:04] happens is they become insignificant
[19:06] because they're not within the borders
[19:08] of the promise. They become forgotten.
[19:11] So there's this insignificance to Reuben
[19:14] Gad and this half-tribe of Manasseh.
[19:15] Remember all firstborn. And so what does
[19:18] that tribe of Manasseh demonstrate? That
[19:20] you've got to be born again. You got to
[19:22] enter into the promise.
[19:24] Joshua chapter 10 now verses 10
[19:27] to15. If you could just recognize this
[19:31] how that they choose this. This is where
[19:34] we're looking at this permissiveness.
[19:36] Then Joshua commanded the officers of
[19:38] the people saying pass through the host
[19:40] and command the people saying prepare
[19:42] you victuals. How many prepare victuals
[19:44] anymore? For within three days you shall
[19:47] pass over this Jordan to go in to
[19:50] possess the land which the Lord your God
[19:52] giveth you to possess it. This is to the
[19:54] nine and a half. This is to really all
[19:56] of Israel. This is the land that God has
[19:58] given you. But then he has a different
[20:00] message for these others to and to the
[20:02] Reubenites and the Gadites and the half
[20:05] tribe of Manasseh spake. Joshua saying
[20:07] remember the word which Moses the
[20:08] servant of the Lord commanded you saying
[20:10] this is that phrase that's very unique.
[20:12] The Lord your God hath given you rest,
[20:15] and hath given you this land. Your
[20:17] wives, your little ones, and your cattle
[20:19] shall remain in the land which Moses
[20:20] gave you on this side Jordan because
[20:23] they hadn't quite crossed over yet. But
[20:25] ye shall pass before your brethren armed
[20:27] and all the mighty men of valor and help
[20:28] them. So they had to enter into the
[20:31] land, fellowship, fight, be with them.
[20:33] But eventually they settle on the wrong
[20:36] side. So he says, "Until the Lord hath
[20:38] given your brethren rest as he hath
[20:40] given you, and that also have they
[20:42] possessed the land which the Lord your
[20:44] God giveth them, then ye shall return
[20:48] unto the land of your possession."
[20:49] They're going to go back and possess
[20:51] that land and enjoy it, which Moses, the
[20:53] Lord's servant, gave you on this side
[20:55] Jordan toward the sunrising. So here it
[20:58] says that Moses gave them that land. we
[21:00] saw earlier in verse 13 which says the
[21:02] Lord God gives you rest and has given
[21:05] you this land. So God gave these two and
[21:08] a half tribes this land on eastward by
[21:11] Jordan in the land of the Moabites by
[21:14] Jericho. He gave them this land. But
[21:17] this isn't God's perfect will. That's
[21:19] right. God's perfect will was always
[21:21] very precise. I want to bring you across
[21:23] Jordan. I want to bring you to this
[21:24] land. This is where I'm going to place
[21:26] you. This is your possession. So what
[21:28] happened was God permitted them. This is
[21:31] God's permissive will. So God's perfect
[21:34] will was in that if we could call it the
[21:36] word the promised land in the message in
[21:37] the this place where the prophet was
[21:39] leading them that the message had been
[21:41] declaring to them all those years and
[21:43] now the Holy Spirit's going to
[21:44] positionally place them in that promised
[21:46] land. And God says, "Okay, that's fine.
[21:48] You can have this land over here." And
[21:50] God permits it. But notice in Numbers
[21:53] 32:5, they asked for permission.
[21:57] Wherefore said they, if we have found
[21:58] grace in thy sight, let this land be
[22:00] given unto thy servants for possession,
[22:02] and bring us not over
[22:05] Jordan. So these two and a half tribes,
[22:07] they don't just take it uh uh without
[22:10] permission. They asked, can we have
[22:12] this? And they requested very
[22:15] specifically in the scripture that we
[22:17] have cattle. This is a place that's good
[22:19] for cattle. We want to have grass, green
[22:21] grass, and enough water to feed our
[22:23] cattle. We They requested permission to
[22:25] use that land for the benefit of their
[22:27] families and for their cattle. And in
[22:30] doing so, they disregarded God's promise
[22:32] that said, "If you'll serve me in the
[22:34] land, you'll have grass for your cattle,
[22:36] wine for your family. You have oil,
[22:38] milk, meat, you'll have everything you
[22:40] need if you serve me." So their decision
[22:42] to stay in the well-watered plains on
[22:44] the other side of Jordan was they didn't
[22:45] want to have to submit to the word of
[22:48] God and trust him. They wanted to have
[22:51] all that evidence outright in their
[22:54] face. So that it's really not faith
[22:56] anymore. That's right. Because in order
[22:58] for there to be faith, there has to be
[22:59] doubt or something uh something against
[23:02] it. Amen.
[23:05] And so this is their decision. They ask
[23:08] for permission and God grants it. Now,
[23:10] there's some that argue that these two
[23:12] and a half tribes made the right
[23:14] decision that in doing so, they're
[23:17] taking a step further to possess more
[23:19] land that God had given Abraham. And
[23:22] there is a factual truth to this. In
[23:25] Genesis 15:8, I was going to have a a
[23:28] map to show you here, but we won't show
[23:30] the map. It says, "In the same day, the
[23:31] Lord made a covenant with Abram." We
[23:33] went through some of the prior verses in
[23:34] this in that uh the fullness of the
[23:37] iniquity of the Amorites and God's
[23:38] covenant that they'll sojourn for 400
[23:40] years. They'll come to that place and
[23:42] into that land. And this is the land he
[23:44] gives. Unto thy seed have I given this
[23:46] land from the river of Egypt under the
[23:49] great river, the river Euphrates. You
[23:51] look at a map, it's from the coast all
[23:53] the way to the river Euphrates. It
[23:54] covers a lot of the Middle East and it
[23:56] would have held this ground that the two
[23:58] and a half tribes are saying they wanted
[24:00] to possess. So, we can actually look in
[24:03] the word of God and say, "No, it says
[24:04] right here to be baptized in the name of
[24:06] the Father and the Son and of the Holy
[24:08] Ghost." It says it God said he would
[24:10] give them the land all the way to the
[24:12] river Euphrates. And so God, there's a
[24:15] place that they could put their finger
[24:16] on said, "No, God gave this to us. This
[24:19] is part of our inheritance." But God had
[24:21] taken them out of Egypt to bring them to
[24:23] a specific place under a specific
[24:26] promise for that age. Amen, for that
[24:30] time. So there's things we can look at
[24:32] says, "Well, God says that we're going
[24:33] to be able to do this and God says we're
[24:35] going to be able to do that or God said
[24:36] we should do this and God said we should
[24:37] do that." Says, "But that was a promise
[24:39] for another age or that's a promise in
[24:41] the future." Brother Brandham said that
[24:43] most of the church or most Christians
[24:45] are looking for his third coming. A and
[24:48] that's the coming they're looking for.
[24:50] And you know what happens is they miss
[24:51] his revealing in his coming today
[24:53] because of that very thing. So there's
[24:56] something I'd like for you to take into
[24:57] consideration as we're addressing
[24:59] perfect will and permissive will.
[25:01] There's five musts that brother Benham
[25:03] taught us. And in these five musts, he
[25:05] describes them different ways. In
[25:06] following God, keeping his commandments,
[25:08] or to do anything right for God, to do
[25:10] God's service correctly, there's five
[25:12] musts. It must be in his time. Must be
[25:16] in his season. Boy, there's a division.
[25:19] That's right. Not just the season, but a
[25:21] time. Must be according to his word.
[25:23] Must be the man. must be the person he
[25:25] chose to do it and it must be
[25:27] vindicated. And how is it vindicated? It
[25:30] kind of it vindicates vindicated by the
[25:32] word. So the five
[25:34] must be in its proper time, its suitable
[25:37] occasion, its its right moment, the
[25:39] appropriate time must be in its season.
[25:42] So there could be this argument. Well,
[25:44] Gad and Reuben and half a tribe of
[25:45] Manessa, they're claiming that land that
[25:48] God had given Abraham. But the question
[25:50] is, is it the right man?
[25:52] Is it the right season?
[25:55] Is it the right time? Is it according to
[25:57] the word? And the word would say, well,
[25:58] there is a time for it. But this word of
[26:00] this age, the word of this moment is to
[26:03] cross Jordan and possess this land and
[26:05] to drive out the enemy from before you.
[26:08] Because the very uh process was I won't
[26:10] give it all to you at once, but by
[26:12] little and little. And to think maybe
[26:15] hypothetically or just conjecture that
[26:17] had they done everything God asked them
[26:20] to do that once they possessed those
[26:21] borders completely and holy then the
[26:24] kingdom begins to expand to possess all
[26:26] the land just as we will rule and reign
[26:28] over the entire earth in the millennium.
[26:30] There could have been a natural
[26:32] demonstration of how that all that God
[26:34] was going to give them could have been
[26:35] possessed but it had to be according to
[26:37] the season. Amen.
[26:40] So their desire to take that
[26:44] land is not God's perfect will. Now I
[26:48] want you to know I want you to see this
[26:49] in scripture. Not just because I'm
[26:51] saying this. So they request permission
[26:53] to settle across Jordan. And this
[26:55] request to have this land that God gives
[26:58] them according to the scripture is in
[27:00] the spirit of the Kades Barnea
[27:02] rebellion. The rebellion at Kadesh
[27:04] Barnea is now brought back in image
[27:07] again. So in numbers 32 14 and 15. And
[27:10] behold ye are when they request this.
[27:12] This is the prophet's response. So this
[27:15] is a discerning of the spirit. You are
[27:17] risen up in your father'sstead an
[27:19] increase of sinful men to augment yet
[27:21] the fierce anger of the Lord toward
[27:23] Israel. For if ye turn away from after
[27:26] him, he will yet again leave them in the
[27:27] wilderness, and you shall destroy all
[27:30] his this people. If they don't go into
[27:33] the promised land, there's nothing but
[27:34] death left for them. Amen. and you have
[27:37] risen up as an increase of sinful men.
[27:41] This is an increase of unbelief.
[27:44] Increase caused you to stumble and fall
[27:47] at Kadis Barnea. And now it says you
[27:49] have been res uh risen up in your
[27:53] father'sstead. You're committing the
[27:55] same sins of your father.
[27:57] Think of it. If we're to be restored to
[27:59] the faith of the fathers, then there is
[28:01] a very specific faith that we're to
[28:04] receive and to have. And then think
[28:06] about all those who fell
[28:09] at that time. You have Joshua and Caleb
[28:11] who do not fall. How many other fathers
[28:13] are there? And we think, well, we're
[28:15] just this is another book of Acts or
[28:17] this is the faith of the apostles. And
[28:19] what you've become is a faith of the
[28:20] impersonators,
[28:22] a
[28:23] copying numbers 14:1. Now, let's look at
[28:27] this Kades
[28:28] Barnea. They've sent the spies over. And
[28:30] remember, God said, "Moses, you send 12
[28:33] spies so that they can see for
[28:36] themselves that everything I've told
[28:37] them is true." And what did he tell
[28:40] them? It's a land full of wonderful
[28:42] fruits and evidences, a land flown with
[28:43] milk and honey and full of enemies.
[28:46] And it came back and they had this
[28:48] report. It's exactly how God said it
[28:50] would be, full of milk and honey and
[28:53] enemies. And instead of that thoroughly
[28:55] vindicating the prophet's message, they
[28:58] cabbage down on their perception of the
[29:00] enemy
[29:02] and failed to see them as God saw them
[29:07] and only speculated as to how the enemy
[29:09] saw them.
[29:11] Says, "And all the congregation after
[29:12] these 10 spies lifted up their voice and
[29:14] cried, and the people wept that night,
[29:15] and all the children of Israel murmured
[29:17] against Moses and against Aaron. Oh, how
[29:20] true. The whole congregation said to
[29:22] them, "Would God that we had died in the
[29:24] land of Egypt or would God we had died
[29:27] in this wilderness." My goodness
[29:29] gracious. This is Kades Barnea. They'd
[29:31] rather die in the wilderness or go back
[29:35] to Egypt than to even dare take God at
[29:38] his word. Seems ridiculous, but that's
[29:41] exactly what they're doing. Amen. God
[29:43] said, "You know what? There's enemies,
[29:44] but I'll take you there. I'll drive them
[29:46] out from before you. might be hard,
[29:48] might be difficult, but it's all just
[29:50] exactly as I said it would be. And
[29:51] instead of instead of taking God at his
[29:53] word and trusting him, they would rather
[29:55] have what they knew. That's right. We
[29:58] know the wilderness. We know Egypt. We
[30:01] know what it's like to do this and like
[30:02] to do that. And they refused to go
[30:04] further, accepting the familiar instead
[30:07] of trusting God. Wherefore hath the Lord
[30:10] brought us into this land to fall by the
[30:12] sword that our wives and our children
[30:14] should be a prey? Were it not better for
[30:16] us to return into
[30:18] Egypt? And so what do they do? They try
[30:21] to mimic God's pattern. And they said
[30:22] one another, "Let us make a captain and
[30:25] let us return into Egypt so that we
[30:28] could have a time and a season and a
[30:32] man.
[30:34] We want to check all the boxes we can to
[30:38] go back to Egypt, the very thing they
[30:40] were called out of." We could say that's
[30:42] going back to the world. But what
[30:44] happens when the same spirit resurrects
[30:47] in Numbers 32? It's not necessarily
[30:49] going back to the world. It's going back
[30:51] to the thing God called them out of, the
[30:53] wilderness of religion, the wilderness
[30:55] of Leodysia, and all that it's
[30:57] associated with. Sure. So in response,
[30:59] God says this in verse 22, "Because all
[31:02] those men which have seen my glory and
[31:03] my miracles, which I did in Egypt, and
[31:05] in the wilderness, and have tempted me
[31:08] now these 10 times, and have not
[31:10] hearkened to my voice, surely they shall
[31:12] not see the land which I swear unto
[31:14] their fathers, neither shall any of them
[31:16] that provoked me see it." Remember how
[31:18] we read in Numbers where he said, "Those
[31:19] that are 20 and over, they're not going
[31:21] to see this land. They're going to
[31:22] perish in the wilderness." And he says,
[31:24] "But my servant Caleb, because he had
[31:27] another spirit with him and hath
[31:30] followed me fully." Amen. How had he
[31:33] followed him fully to that point? All he
[31:35] had done is taken God at his word.
[31:39] He didn't go in there and kill anybody.
[31:41] That's right. You know, he didn't put
[31:42] earnest money down on any plot of land.
[31:45] He hadn't settled in the promised land.
[31:46] He believed God that he would do it. And
[31:49] that's how he had fully followed. What
[31:50] is How can we work the mighty works of
[31:52] God? Believe. Believe. That's the only
[31:55] way that we can fight the fight of faith
[31:57] is to hold on to belief. Him will I
[32:00] bring into the land where into he went
[32:02] and his seed shall possess it.
[32:06] So there's your contrast. Perfect will
[32:09] of God. And yet there's this permissive
[32:11] will that we're looking at. So God says
[32:13] in verse 33 to35, "And your children
[32:16] shall wander in the wilderness 40
[32:17] years." God says there's got to be 40
[32:19] years now and bear your whoredoms until
[32:22] your carcasses be wasted in the
[32:23] wilderness after the number of the days
[32:25] which you search the land even 40 days
[32:27] each day for a
[32:29] year. I hope we can't do the math and
[32:32] figure out just how much exploring and
[32:36] unbelief is done and how much God has
[32:38] demonstrated perfectly that this message
[32:40] is correct and people fail to embrace it
[32:42] and now we're going to serve a year for
[32:44] every
[32:44] day. Over how many days did God preach
[32:47] the seals there? And that
[32:51] one shall you bear your iniquities each
[32:54] day for a year, even 40 years, and ye
[32:56] shall know my breach of
[33:00] promise. I the Lord have said, I will
[33:03] surely do it unto all this evil
[33:05] congregation that are gathered together
[33:07] against me in this wilderness. They
[33:08] shall be consumed, and there they shall
[33:12] die. That's what God said.
[33:15] Now think of this from this perspective.
[33:17] Go possess the land and go in and spy it
[33:21] out. And so to this moment to numbers
[33:23] 14, he said God comes back and two of
[33:25] them like no calm down people. We're
[33:27] more than able. We're more than able.
[33:28] And then 10 others say, "No, you're not.
[33:29] No, you're not Joshua. No, you're not
[33:31] Caleb." And guess what? God vindicated
[33:32] that Joshua and Caleb were. And those 10
[33:34] spies were lies because those 10 spies
[33:36] and everyone over 20 really with them
[33:38] died in the wilderness and perished in
[33:39] the wilderness. And Joshua and Caleb
[33:41] cross over. But at that very moment when
[33:44] this sentence is passed and judgment
[33:45] comes, the people could have said, "Oh,
[33:47] no, no, no, wait a minute. Oh, now that
[33:50] we think about it, we don't want to die
[33:52] in the wilderness." And but God would
[33:54] say, "No, no, my word says you have to
[33:58] stay and wait." So, catch the spirit
[34:01] that works within these people. They've
[34:03] already clearly rejected the word. And
[34:05] so, the word pronounces judgment or a
[34:07] sentence or he says something. And
[34:09] notice how they still yet resist
[34:12] correction. Yeah, it's not wrong to it's
[34:16] not wrong to be wrong. That'll make a
[34:18] sermon. It's okay to be wrong. As long
[34:22] as when you find out you're wrong,
[34:23] you're willing to get right. We compound
[34:26] our error when God says, "That was a
[34:28] lying spirit. You shouldn't have done
[34:29] that. That's wrong." And we start to
[34:30] say, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa," and we
[34:32] start to justify ourselves. We can just
[34:34] say, "God, I'm sorry. Please forgive me.
[34:36] I want to go forward."
[34:38] And so it's okay and we should not be
[34:40] afraid of discovering that we have been
[34:43] wrong. That's right. What we should not
[34:45] do is be stubborn about we don't care if
[34:48] we do wrong. But we should be willing to
[34:50] discover that we have been wrong so that
[34:52] we can be right. And not be arrogant to
[34:55] say, well, I don't mind if I make a
[34:57] mistake. I don't care if I if I do it
[34:59] wrong. No, we ought to care. But
[35:01] whenever we find out we have been wrong,
[35:03] we should be willing to humble ourselves
[35:04] to be right. But notice the spirit
[35:07] associated with Kadis Barnea that comes
[35:09] back up in Numbers 32.
[35:11] If you're looking in your Bibles, this
[35:13] to me is so absolutely remarkable. We
[35:16] stopped reading at verse 35. You could
[35:17] read the next five verses, but just five
[35:20] verses later in verse 40. God has said,
[35:23] "You will remain here for 40 years
[35:25] before you cross the Jordan." And they
[35:27] rose up early in the morning, what are
[35:29] they trying to do? They're trying to
[35:30] mimic
[35:31] something. And get them up in the top of
[35:34] the mountain, saying, "Lo, we be here,
[35:38] and we will go up under the place which
[35:40] the Lord hath promised, for we have
[35:43] sinned." Notice the image. They've been
[35:45] brought to the top of a mountain. From
[35:47] the mountaintop, they can see the land,
[35:48] and they say, "We're here on the wrong
[35:50] side of the promise in the land of Moab,
[35:52] but we're going to possess the land that
[35:54] God has given us." And Moses said,
[35:57] "Wherefore now do ye transgress the
[35:59] commandment of the Lord?" Wait, we're
[36:02] going to go into the land. We want to
[36:03] possess it. We We want to We want to
[36:05] take God at his word. We want to We want
[36:07] to uh say amen to every word of God.
[36:09] This is what we want to do. We want to
[36:11] be a a genuine God-filled, Holy Spirit
[36:13] filled church. We want to do it. He
[36:14] says, "You're going to do it against
[36:15] God's commandment." So, but isn't this
[36:17] what God said? But it shall not prosper.
[36:21] Go not up, for the Lord is not among
[36:23] you.
[36:26] That's it. Look at this. We're We want
[36:28] to do this because this is what God
[36:30] said. And you do it, but God's not even
[36:32] with you.
[36:34] This is how we're going to do it. This
[36:36] is where we're going to be. This is how
[36:37] it's going to happen. But God's not even
[36:38] with you. That you be not smitten before
[36:40] your enemies. Don't go. God's not with
[36:42] you. You're going to die before your
[36:43] enemies. For the Amalachites and the
[36:45] Canaanites are there before you, and ye
[36:47] shall fall by the sword. This is the
[36:49] prophet's answer, right? God does the
[36:52] same warning in the message of the hour.
[36:54] He warns us of venturing. He warns us of
[36:57] trying to fulfill God's word according
[36:59] to our own interpretation or own time or
[37:01] own season. There's this warning. You've
[37:03] turned away from the Lord. So, you're
[37:04] going to fall by the sword of sword of
[37:06] your enemies. Because you turned away
[37:08] from the Lord, therefore, the Lord will
[37:10] not be with you. There has to be a
[37:13] humbling ourselves to the word of God
[37:15] and not this rationalization. Well, it's
[37:17] in the message and brother Benham said
[37:19] it and God did this and God did that.
[37:20] There has to be a humbling. But they
[37:22] presumed to go up under the hilltop.
[37:24] Amen. That's it. Nevertheless, the ark
[37:26] of the covenant Lord and Moses departed
[37:28] not out of the camp. The word stayed.
[37:30] The Holy Spirit stayed. The word was
[37:32] where it was. You followed the word and
[37:34] they're going to go possess the land.
[37:36] God said we could have it. God said we
[37:37] could do this. Then the Amalachites came
[37:38] down and the Canaanites which dwelt in
[37:40] that hill and smote them and
[37:42] discomforted them even unto
[37:45] Hora. Do you see what happened?
[37:48] God said they would enter the land, but
[37:50] now they're doing it without the word.
[37:53] They're doing it without the ark.
[37:55] They're doing it without the prophet.
[37:58] But they're going to fulfill the
[37:59] prophet's message. They're going to be
[38:01] able to accomplish what God said. I
[38:03] wonder if they wanted to do it without
[38:05] having to say Moses said, "Oh my, come
[38:09] on." But God had said it would be 40
[38:11] years before they could enter. The word
[38:14] said it would be 40 years. If there
[38:16] could have ever been an attitude check,
[38:18] that was their opportunity. He said,
[38:19] "You know what? God said 40 years, Lord,
[38:22] let me not be like one that would perish
[38:23] in the wilderness. If it's going to be
[38:25] 40 years, don't let me make the same
[38:26] mistake as my fathers. Don't let me make
[38:28] the same mistake that I made there at
[38:30] Kadis Barnea just earlier this week,
[38:32] Lord. Oh, God, forgive me. Fall pour
[38:34] yourself on his mercies and say, Lord, I
[38:36] don't want to go back to Egypt. I don't
[38:37] want to die in this wilderness. I'm
[38:38] willing to take you at your word, Lord.
[38:40] Could it be that I can make it across
[38:41] that river?" Yes. And maybe even say,
[38:44] "Lord, if I can, I don't want my
[38:45] children to make the same mistake I
[38:47] made." But what did they do? They set an
[38:49] example to their children so that when
[38:51] their children were of age and could
[38:53] have taken the promise, they fell in the
[38:55] example of their fathers by deciding to
[38:57] go against the word of God.
[39:00] Amen. Brother Brandham says in the
[39:02] message thirst let this be a warning to
[39:04] the Pentecostals Lord across the land.
[39:07] How that Moses a prophet came down into
[39:09] Egypt to fulfill the word of God to
[39:12] bring the evening light to them. How
[39:14] they seen the great miracles of God. How
[39:16] they followed him crossed the Red Sea
[39:18] and were baptized unto him went into the
[39:19] wilderness and eat angels food that fell
[39:21] from heaven and then refused to take all
[39:25] the word. Amen. When they came back from
[39:28] Kades Barnea from the promised land.
[39:30] That's right. And they said, "They're
[39:31] like
[39:32] giants. We can't do it." When God said,
[39:36] "I've already given you the land."
[39:38] Borderline. That's right. Jesus said,
[39:41] "They are everyone perished. They are
[39:42] dead, lost, without God, though they did
[39:45] all these things." Amen.
[39:48] This
[39:50] is this is the the caution.
[39:56] Sorry that I didn't give you some of the
[39:57] summaries of this statement here, but he
[39:58] says they saw miracles, enjoyed, danced
[40:01] up and down the sea coast with Miriam
[40:03] when they beat the tambourine, and only
[40:06] two out of two million went in.
[40:10] And what was the difference?
[40:13] All could do that.
[40:17] Anyone can do that. You know what it
[40:20] takes to do that? Be human. That's
[40:23] right. Right. But what what becomes
[40:27] divine? To take God at his word. That's
[40:29] right. What resonates with the heart of
[40:30] God to take God at his word. Anyone can
[40:32] do the other.
[40:34] But only the elect can truly take God at
[40:37] his word.
[40:40] In this very moment, God's word was
[40:42] leading them to an inheritance in the
[40:44] promised land.
[40:47] And they rejected God's man, God's
[40:49] season, God's time. Yeah. And so then
[40:52] God establishes this new time frame. He
[40:55] says, "You got to wait 40 years." And
[40:57] they got up and said, "Well, God gave it
[40:59] to us. Let's go. Let's do it." You catch
[41:01] the example now?
[41:04] Because there are not only three must or
[41:07] five musts, but there's three must
[41:08] notss. That's right.
[41:11] There's three must notss in scripture or
[41:13] when using God's word because if we do
[41:15] any one of these things, it causes chaos
[41:17] and confusion. You must not misinterpret
[41:20] the word. You must not misplace the
[41:23] word. You must not dislocate the word.
[41:27] So what had they done? They took the
[41:30] word and misplaced it. They dislocated
[41:33] it. That's right. What did it cause?
[41:34] Death. Confusion. That's right. They
[41:36] were destroyed. This is the spirit of
[41:39] their fathers at Kadish
[41:42] Barnea. This is the attitude. What did
[41:45] they do? They went up on top of a
[41:46] hilltop and said, "Behold the land that
[41:48] God has promised and we want to possess
[41:51] it."
[41:52] Now, if you look at Deuteronomy chapter
[41:54] 32:es
[41:56] 48-52, we're making absolute wonderful
[41:59] time. I love this. We're going to be
[42:00] able to have a youth meeting this
[42:03] afternoon. Deuteronomy 32:es 48-
[42:07] 52. Really zero in on this. These things
[42:10] were written for our example that we
[42:12] would not go lusting, that we would not
[42:14] lust after evil things as they did and
[42:16] they perished in the wilderness. We're
[42:17] learning from this. We want to take all
[42:19] the promises of God. We want to take the
[42:20] full word of God. Total obedience to the
[42:22] full word of God entitles us to the
[42:25] display. That's right. The framing.
[42:27] That's right. The rapture.
[42:30] And the Lord spake unto Moses that self
[42:31] same day, saying,
[42:34] now
[42:36] what? Well, I have to draw from some
[42:38] things that we've taught here in the
[42:39] past at great length.
[42:42] Moses struck the
[42:45] rock
[42:47] and acted in a time when God wanted to
[42:51] demonstrate a greater faith. Remember,
[42:54] God wanted Moses to demonstrate the
[42:56] perfect will of God through the word and
[42:59] the word only. He reverted
[43:01] back to striking the rock.
[43:05] And in doing so, he failed to glorify
[43:07] the perfect will of God. And that was
[43:09] enough for God to tell this prophet
[43:13] after the decades of suffering.
[43:16] Think of all the 40s he had to go
[43:18] through.
[43:20] And then finally, I got a birthday card
[43:22] yesterday and they said, "Hold this over
[43:23] your head so you can say you're under 50
[43:26] for for the last time."
[43:28] And so there was something to be there
[43:31] was something in that moment that God
[43:32] was wanting to demonstrate the word, the
[43:35] perfect will of God, the original word
[43:36] of God, original way of God. Take God at
[43:39] his word. This was important in order to
[43:41] possess the land. But Moses demonstrated
[43:43] at a very critical moment that going
[43:45] back to reverting back, going back to
[43:48] what's familiar, going back to certain
[43:50] things that was part of a glare of
[43:51] another age. And so God, the punishment
[43:54] was you won't cross over. Now, that
[43:56] seems harsh, but God had to do it as an
[43:59] example. There's going to come a time
[44:01] when you've got to meet the mark
[44:03] perfectly, and nothing else will get you
[44:06] there. Amen. The Lord spake unto Moses
[44:08] that selfs same day, get thee up into
[44:10] this mountain, Abram, unto Mount Nebo,
[44:14] which is in the land of Moab, that is
[44:18] over against Jericho. Notice the direct
[44:20] the point at which he's going to bring
[44:22] him to in the land of Moab over against
[44:25] Jericho right eastward the wrong side of
[44:29] Jordan. Take it all all again from
[44:31] Joshua 13. And behold from there you
[44:35] could see the land of Canaan it says and
[44:36] behold the land of Canaan which I give
[44:38] unto the children of Israel for a
[44:40] possession. He doesn't say nine and a
[44:42] half tribes. Doesn't carve anybody out.
[44:44] He says I this is what I'm offering to
[44:46] all 12 or to all the all the tribes and
[44:50] die. He says come behold in verse 50 and
[44:53] die in the mount whether thou goest up
[44:55] and be gathered under thy people as
[44:57] Aaron thy brother died in mount
[44:59] and was gathered under his people. I'm
[45:00] not superstitious that this is the 50th
[45:04] verse. Why? Because ye trespassed
[45:07] against me among the children of Israel
[45:08] at the waters of Meabakadesh in the
[45:10] wilderness of Zen. Because you
[45:12] sanctified me not in the midst of the
[45:13] children of Israel. God wasn't
[45:15] glorified. Who was glorified? That's it.
[45:17] The prophet, the action, the activity,
[45:19] the preacher, not God. That's right.
[45:22] Amen. Yet thou shalt see the land before
[45:25] thee. You'll see
[45:27] it. But thou shalt not go thither into
[45:30] the land which I give the children of
[45:32] Israel. I'll let you see it, but I won't
[45:35] let you enter.
[45:37] And then there's even those. You
[45:38] remember how the twins gets narrowed
[45:40] down to where then it's the same father,
[45:43] same womb produces twins. Moses can't.
[45:46] He can see it, but he can't enter. But
[45:48] then there's actually going to be two
[45:49] and a half tribes that enter, fight, and
[45:52] go right back.
[45:55] There they stood in the land of Moab
[45:58] on top of a mountain looking into the
[46:00] land of Canaan. And God tells the
[46:02] prophet, "Because you've sinned, you
[46:03] can't possess it." I'm not trying to
[46:05] bring out any types to this other than
[46:06] just look exactly what the scripture is
[46:08] saying. And just in Numbers 14, the same
[46:12] men had walked up to a mountaintop and
[46:14] said, "Behold the land. We're going to
[46:15] take it." After they had disobeyed God,
[46:18] and what did God say? You can't have it.
[46:21] He reinforces once
[46:24] again what unbelief is and what sin will
[46:27] do. What failure to take God at his word
[46:30] will do. He's got He wants to
[46:31] demonstrate these things. Give an
[46:32] example.
[46:34] But this very thing that they do in
[46:36] Numbers
[46:38] 14 and what God demonstrates even in
[46:40] Numbers 32 to an extent is the very sin
[46:43] of
[46:43] Lot. Genesis 13 10 and 11 when there was
[46:48] strife that rose up between Abraham and
[46:50] Lot. Abraham gave Lot the choice where
[46:53] do you want to be? And it says and Lot
[46:54] lifted up his eyes and behold all the
[46:56] plain of Jordan that was well watered
[46:59] everywhere before the Lord destroyed
[47:01] Sodom and Gomorrah. even as the garden
[47:04] of the Lord, like the land of Egypt, as
[47:06] thou comest unto Zor. There's your
[47:09] geographical reference point. Then Lot
[47:12] chose him all the plain of Jordan. And
[47:13] Lot journeyed east.
[47:16] Where is it? He's going the other side
[47:18] of Jordan or the other side Jordan.
[47:20] Wrong side of Jordan, eastward.
[47:22] And they separated themselves, the one
[47:25] from the other. Abram dweld in the land
[47:28] of Canaan.
[47:30] Abram's in the promised land. Lot dwelt
[47:33] in the cities of the plain and pitched
[47:34] his tent toward Sodom. But the men of
[47:37] Sodom were wicked and the sinners before
[47:38] the Lord exceedingly.
[47:41] Lot when he stood upon the mountain and
[47:44] saw a choice between Canaan and Moab, he
[47:46] chose Moab. Now that sounds odd since
[47:48] that was his his grandson, son, half
[47:51] son, half grandson. Anyways, right when
[47:54] he looks out, he chooses that land that
[47:58] becomes associ with Sodom and Gomorrah.
[48:01] Right? The land that is not within
[48:03] Canaan, Abram's dwelling place is in the
[48:05] land of Canaan. Lot upon a mountaintop
[48:07] sees the well-watered plains and doesn't
[48:09] trust God as he gave the message to
[48:11] Abraham. He chooses his own land.
[48:14] This is the spirit. When when Moses
[48:18] rebukes the two and a half tribes, he
[48:21] says, "You've risen up in your
[48:22] father'sstead of the sin of Kades Barney
[48:25] of
[48:26] unbelief to choose the land of Moab."
[48:29] Moab is named after Lot's son.
[48:33] Moab is named after make believe. Moab
[48:36] is identified this land they wanted to
[48:39] settle in. It was something that their
[48:41] spirits were had affinity to because
[48:44] it's associated with not going all the
[48:46] way.
[48:48] Amen. It's a copy. It's close. Good. It
[48:52] looks the same.
[48:55] It would maybe look well it's Jordan
[48:56] Jordan River. It's got this. It's got
[48:59] that. It says, "But if you look closely
[49:01] enough, it's not a mirror. It's not the
[49:04] exact thing mirrored. It's a fake copy.
[49:07] It's an illusion. It's a fictional
[49:10] faith." And I I'd like to be able to end
[49:13] it with this thought in Genesis 19:es 15
[49:17] to
[49:19] 26. And in doing so, hopefully we
[49:24] can bring it to our
[49:29] day. The Bible says as it was in the
[49:32] days of Lot. Amen. Let's just look at
[49:34] the days of Lot again. Genesis chapter
[49:37] 19 15 to 26. And when the morning arose
[49:41] at the rising of the sun, the angels
[49:44] hastened lot, saying, "Arise, take thy
[49:46] wife and thy two daughters which are
[49:47] here, lest thou be consumed in the
[49:49] iniquity of the city. Come out of her,
[49:51] my people. Get out. Have nothing to do
[49:52] with. Be not partakers of flesh. Don't
[49:54] go back like a dog to its vomit. Don't
[49:56] go back like a hog to its waller. Uh uh
[49:58] this is a this has opened up a different
[50:00] lane for us, a different place, a
[50:02] different plane. Let's go. Let's go."
[50:04] And while he lingered, the men laid hold
[50:05] upon his hand and upon the hand of his
[50:07] wife and upon the hand of his two
[50:09] daughters, the Lord being merciful unto
[50:11] him, and they brought him forth and set
[50:13] him without the city. Even a what
[50:15] appears to be a supernatural happening.
[50:19] Think of what Lot could testify to. We
[50:21] the enemy surrounded us and in a moment
[50:23] we were brought out of the city and
[50:24] there we were all of a sudden.
[50:27] So there's something supernatural. Even
[50:28] the to the Hebrews and the uh the
[50:30] rabbins, they look at this as something
[50:32] remarkable.
[50:33] And it came to pass when they had
[50:35] brought them forth abroad. So they're
[50:36] escaping Sodom and Gomorrah. Remember
[50:39] how brother Bram said that Lot's wife
[50:41] started out as an overcomer.
[50:45] Escape for thy life. Look not behind
[50:49] thee. Neither stay thou in all the
[50:53] plain. Escape to the mountain, lest thou
[50:57] be consumed. This is very specific.
[51:00] Amen. If you want to live, I set before
[51:03] you blessing or cursing, life or death.
[51:05] That's what he set before Micadas
[51:06] Barnea. To choose life would be to take
[51:08] God at his word and enter the promised
[51:09] land. To choose death would be to not
[51:12] trust him and whether die in the
[51:13] wilderness or in
[51:14] Egypt. That's what he was putting before
[51:16] them. This is life or death. Wrong side
[51:18] of Jordan, death. Other side of Jordan,
[51:20] life. Here it says, don't stay in the
[51:23] plane. Go to the mountain. Don't look
[51:26] behind you. Those are the three things
[51:28] you have to do. Go all the way to the
[51:30] mountain. Whatever you do, don't stay in
[51:32] the plane. Whatever you do, don't look
[51:33] back. Does that seem pretty clear?
[51:36] And Lot said unto them, "Oh, not so, my
[51:40] Lord. Behold, now thy servant hath found
[51:42] grace in thy sight, and thou hast
[51:44] magnified thy mercy, which thou has
[51:45] shown unto me in saving my life." Could
[51:48] Could we read again? Here it is in
[51:51] Numbers. If we have found grace in thy
[51:53] sight, let this land be given unto thy
[51:55] servants for possession. Bring us not
[51:57] over Jordan.
[51:58] That's it right there. Like were they
[52:00] were they reading Lot's biography? Like
[52:03] had they just stumbled on his Wikipedia
[52:05] page? Like that's a good phrase.
[52:09] If I have found grace in thy
[52:13] sight, and thou has magnified thy mercy
[52:16] which thou has shown unto me in saving
[52:18] my life. I cannot escape to the
[52:21] mountain. Wait a minute. Is this numbers
[52:23] 14?
[52:25] Lest some evil take me and I die. Amen.
[52:29] Behold now, this city is near to flee
[52:32] unto. I'm a city guy. I'm not really a
[52:34] country guy. Behold, these lands are
[52:36] good for cattle. Behold now, this city
[52:39] is near unto me and is it is a little
[52:41] one. Think about how many times we
[52:43] rationalize and justify not obeying
[52:45] God's word because well, it's just a
[52:47] little error. It's just a little levan.
[52:51] Amen. And it is a little one. Oh, let me
[52:53] escape thither. Is it not a little one?
[52:56] He says it again. It's almost
[53:00] comical. It It's a little one. And then
[53:03] he wants confirmation. Is it not? Huh?
[53:06] Don't Don't you think it's good? Nice.
[53:07] Nice and charming church. Got a little
[53:09] culde-sac here. My soul shall live. And
[53:12] he said to him, see, now the angel says,
[53:15] this is where it comes right down to
[53:18] perfect will, permissive will. What did
[53:20] God's word say? That's it. Good. Go to
[53:23] the mountain.
[53:25] What did Lot say? Could you give me
[53:26] permission to live in the plain? And
[53:29] what does God say? I've accepted thee
[53:31] concerning this thing also that I will
[53:33] not overthrow this city for the which
[53:35] thou has spoken.
[53:37] Why doesn't God destroy
[53:39] them? Why doesn't God uh close the
[53:42] doors, wipe them off the face of Why
[53:44] does God let these things be a and rise
[53:46] up and exist? Why doesn't he just prove
[53:49] and vindicate? Why does it seem as if
[53:51] God has permitted and allowed and maybe
[53:53] in our eyes blessed this
[53:56] in the plane when he clearly said not to
[53:58] do that
[54:01] hast thee escaped thither hasty escape
[54:04] thither for I cannot do anything till
[54:06] thou become thither therefore the name
[54:09] of the city was called
[54:12] Zor entering Zor was God's permissive
[54:16] will
[54:18] God's word said go to the mountain.
[54:20] That's it. Lot requested permission to
[54:23] stay in the plane. God said you may.
[54:26] Yeah.
[54:28] The message said escape to the
[54:31] mountain. Lot refuses to fully follow
[54:34] the Lord. And it says he settled in
[54:35] Zoir. As I studied this over the last
[54:38] few weeks, every single possible
[54:40] location is east of Jordan.
[54:43] Different scriptures I read different
[54:45] maps, things trying to find it. And you
[54:46] know what Zor means? insignificance.
[54:52] Lot chose insignificance. Come on. At
[54:57] the rising of the sun. Yeah. When he's
[54:59] told to go to the top of the mountain,
[55:02] we're not at the base. We're not at the
[55:04] beginning. We're not we're not in the
[55:05] Ephesians uh the Ephesians church age.
[55:08] Uh we're going all the way to the
[55:09] climax, the top, the pinnacle. This is
[55:11] the perfection of Mount Zion. This is
[55:14] when God yet speaks again. Go all the
[55:16] way to the top, the climax.
[55:19] Don't stay in the plane. At the rising
[55:22] of the sun, sun Lot chooses
[55:24] insignificance.
[55:26] It's at that moment that the church ages
[55:28] are rejected. Christ is put out of the
[55:30] church. You got to come up high. You got
[55:32] to come into the capstone revelation.
[55:34] Amen. The rest is insignificant. It's
[55:36] rejected. What did the two and a half
[55:38] tribes become? Insignificant. What was
[55:40] the spirit? They were driven by a spirit
[55:42] that settles in Zoir. Insignificance.
[55:50] At the rising of the sun,
[55:53] the sun was risen upon the earth. At
[55:55] that moment, as it begins to rise, at
[55:57] the rising of the sun, Lot chooses his
[56:00] place. Then the Lord rained upon Sodom
[56:03] and upon Gomorra, brimstone and fire
[56:04] from the Lord out of heaven. And he
[56:06] overthrew those cities and all the plain
[56:08] and all the inhabitants of those cities
[56:10] that which grew upon the ground.
[56:13] That's that's that's cursed
[56:15] ground. That wasn't ground to be
[56:18] picking. Now Lot has asked for
[56:21] permission to settle short.
[56:24] But his wife looked back from behind
[56:26] him. And she became a pillar of
[56:29] salt. Why would she look back?
[56:33] You're all thinking, is this is this the
[56:35] moment where we all discuss?
[56:39] A lot of things, brother Benam says to
[56:41] identify the spirit behind it. But how
[56:44] easy had Lot made it
[56:47] for her to look back when he didn't go
[56:50] all the way. That's right.
[56:53] Blame the woman. Blame the woman. Blame
[56:54] the woman. But now the man, Amen. the
[56:56] man was told to go to the mountain so
[56:58] that your daughters and your wife would
[57:00] live. Had he gone all the way, could it
[57:02] be that the woman would never have been
[57:04] tempted to look back? If if we as men in
[57:07] our households, if we as ministers can
[57:09] continue to point to the destination,
[57:11] the destination, and what God has called
[57:13] us to, maybe we wouldn't give the
[57:15] churches and the women and the believers
[57:16] and the young people enough time to look
[57:18] back. That's right. That's right. But
[57:21] she looked back behind herself and she
[57:23] became a pillar of salt. Amen.
[57:28] Likewise, as it was in the days of Lot,
[57:30] Luke 17:es 28-32, they did eat, they
[57:33] drank, they bought, they sold, they
[57:35] planted, they
[57:36] builded, but the same day that Lot went
[57:38] out of Sodom, it rained fire and
[57:39] brimstone from heaven and destroyed them
[57:41] all. Even thus shall it be in the day
[57:44] when the Son of Man is revealed. Amen.
[57:46] In that day, he which shall be upon the
[57:48] housetop, and his stuff in the house,
[57:49] let him not come down to take it away.
[57:51] And he that is in the field, let him
[57:53] likewise not return back. Don't turn
[57:55] back. Don't go back to carnality. Don't
[57:58] go back to the well-watered plains.
[58:00] Don't go back to churchism. Don't go
[58:02] back to Pentecostalism. Don't go back to
[58:04] things familiar. You got to trust God.
[58:06] Take him at his word. Go all the way to
[58:09] the mountain. Go all the way to the top.
[58:11] Go all the way to the change. Go all the
[58:13] way to the word. Take God at his word.
[58:15] Only believe.
[58:17] He says, "Remember Lot's
[58:20] wife." Because Lot's wife under the
[58:22] wrong example. Even though the Bible
[58:24] says that brother Brandham says she
[58:26] rejected the headship of her husband.
[58:31] She looks back. Maybe she lost the
[58:33] confidence in him. Well, if you're not
[58:35] going to follow the message holy, then
[58:36] I'll just go back in the world. How many
[58:38] times has that been repeated? We use the
[58:40] hypocrite. We use the makeeliever as our
[58:42] reason for walking away.
[58:47] Amen. Remember Lot's wife. It's not a
[58:50] warning. It's a prophecy.
[58:54] She must
[58:56] be I probably said this before, but I
[59:00] was preaching one time many many years
[59:02] ago and on the subject of Lot's wife and
[59:04] said she's found that she's the only
[59:05] woman that's mentioned both in the Old
[59:07] Testament and New
[59:08] Testament and we don't know her
[59:12] name. And then there's I think there's
[59:14] maybe the Queen of Sheba is another one
[59:16] that is maybe using reference to that.
[59:18] And then after I preached the pastor got
[59:19] up and said, "We know her name." I was
[59:22] like, "Oh, great. How did I miss this?"
[59:24] I hadn't been preaching very long then.
[59:25] I was like, he goes, "Her name was
[59:28] Anita." Because she she need a lot. I
[59:32] was like, "Oh,
[59:37] okay." Remember Lot's wife at the rising
[59:41] of the sun, the way the scripture
[59:44] unfolds, Lot enters into insignificance
[59:47] and Lot's wife becomes a pillar of salt.
[59:51] But look at Genesis 19
[59:55] 27. And Abraham got up early in the
[59:58] morning to the place where he stood
[1:00:01] before the Lord. Amen. At the rising of
[1:00:05] the sun, Lot's wife is turned into a
[1:00:07] pillar of salt. Lot is entering in
[1:00:09] significance. But at the rising of the
[1:00:11] sun in the promised land in the land of
[1:00:14] Canaan, Lot is is is entering into his
[1:00:17] destination. He's declaring his fruits.
[1:00:19] He's showing who he is. Lot's wife is
[1:00:21] falling away. But at Abraham at the
[1:00:23] rising of the sun stands in the presence
[1:00:26] of the Lord. Stands in God's presence.
[1:00:30] Brother Brandham says in proving his
[1:00:31] word, don't you see in shadows? Stop
[1:00:33] here a minute. In the last days, there's
[1:00:35] got to be a place prepared for the word
[1:00:38] to be made manifest. And we're now
[1:00:40] living by the evidence of the new land,
[1:00:42] the son of man.
[1:00:45] This isn't the wilderness. This isn't
[1:00:46] Egypt. This isn't church ages. This
[1:00:49] isn't le oysia. We're living by the
[1:00:51] evidence of the new land. It's
[1:00:53] represented by the son of man. It's not
[1:00:56] dead carrying. It's not the glare of
[1:00:58] another age. We're walking into his
[1:01:00] presence. We've entered into the holiest
[1:01:02] of holies.
[1:01:05] We're now living in the new land of the
[1:01:07] son of man. Amen. Amen. Brothers, if you
[1:01:10] could come to your instruments at the
[1:01:13] rising of the sun, I want to be found
[1:01:16] doing everything I can to enter in. I
[1:01:18] want to be standing before the Lord.
[1:01:24] But there were false prophets also among
[1:01:26] the people. Second Peter chapter 2 verse
[1:01:28] one. Even as though there shall be false
[1:01:32] teachers among you, who privilege shall
[1:01:33] bring in damnable heresies, even denying
[1:01:36] the Lord that bought them and bring upon
[1:01:38] themselves swift destruction. And many
[1:01:40] shall follow their pernitious ways by
[1:01:42] reason of whom the way of truth shall be
[1:01:44] evil spoken of. And through covetousness
[1:01:47] they shall with fain words make
[1:01:48] merchandise of you, whose judgment now
[1:01:52] of long time lingerth not, and their
[1:01:54] damnation slumberth
[1:01:56] not. What was it that was Lot was doing?
[1:01:59] He got permission, but it wasn't the
[1:02:00] original.
[1:02:02] What was the two and a half tribes are
[1:02:03] doing? They got permission, but it
[1:02:04] wasn't the original. Wasn't the full
[1:02:06] word. They copied. They didn't have a
[1:02:10] copyright. They were copy wrong. But God
[1:02:14] said, "I could do it." Brother Brandham
[1:02:15] told woman told him, "God called me to
[1:02:16] preach." She says, "I'm not saying he
[1:02:17] didn't.
[1:02:21] God could tell us all sorts of things to
[1:02:23] do." Remember the prophet who was told,
[1:02:26] "Go do this. Don't stop. come back.
[1:02:29] Young prophet, he had to do what he was
[1:02:31] supposed to do. God told another prophet
[1:02:34] to stop him and tell him not to do it.
[1:02:35] That's it. He had to do what he was
[1:02:37] called to do. That's right. Don't let
[1:02:39] somebody else stop you
[1:02:42] with a word from the Lord and an
[1:02:44] interpretation of this message. Amen.
[1:02:46] You do what God told you to do.
[1:02:48] Hallelujah. You go do exactly what he
[1:02:50] said.
[1:02:53] Amen.
[1:02:54] It says, "And turning God judgment now
[1:02:57] and turning the cities of Sodom and
[1:02:58] Gomorrah into ashes condemn
[1:03:01] them with an overthrow, making them an
[1:03:04] example unto those that afterward would
[1:03:07] should live ungodly." Amen.
[1:03:11] And then the paradox, but delivered
[1:03:15] Lot because it vexed his righteous
[1:03:18] [Music]
[1:03:19] soul. There's a perfect will. Yeah. And
[1:03:23] there's a permissive will. Amen. He
[1:03:25] said, "These are those that have, like a
[1:03:28] dog, gone back to its vomit,
[1:03:31] like a hog to its
[1:03:34] wallow. Let us not be like
[1:03:37] those." So, I would even go as hard to
[1:03:39] say, you can't be like those. God has
[1:03:42] ordained it. It's going to happen. Stop
[1:03:44] fighting it. Stop kicking against it.
[1:03:48] Embrace it. Lean into it. Take God at
[1:03:50] his word. Well, I'm worried about this.
[1:03:51] I'm worried about it. He said he'd take
[1:03:52] care of it. And that's the lesson we
[1:03:55] learn is that they went lusting after
[1:03:57] evil things. What were the evil things?
[1:03:59] Maybe not as evil as we think they are.
[1:04:01] A lot of it did manifest in uh false
[1:04:03] god, worship of false gods. We'll look
[1:04:05] at this the next service we minister on
[1:04:06] this subject on this religious spirit
[1:04:10] that rises up in this
[1:04:12] land and how it's a resurrection of this
[1:04:14] rebellion, even a resurrection of
[1:04:15] Numbers 14:40. Let's go into the land. a
[1:04:19] resurrection of a spirit that would try
[1:04:21] to destroy the children of Israel and
[1:04:22] keep them from possessing their land.
[1:04:24] It's all in these stories. It's all
[1:04:26] written in there for our
[1:04:27] example. So, we got to use it and take
[1:04:29] heart to realize that whatever comes
[1:04:31] against me, whatever affront, I want to
[1:04:33] know what the word of God says and I
[1:04:35] want to amen it. I want to stick to it
[1:04:37] and I want to manifest in my life. Amen.
[1:04:40] I don't want to use it by permission.
[1:04:42] That's right. I want to be the perfect
[1:04:44] expression. That's right. I I don't want
[1:04:47] to I don't want to have a right to use.
[1:04:49] I don't want to have a right to be
[1:04:51] associated with. I don't want to ask God
[1:04:52] to give me something and he'll give it
[1:04:54] to me and it's his per permissive will.
[1:04:57] And this is to me how it it just settled
[1:04:59] to in a way for me to understand more
[1:05:01] what permissive will is. Permissive will
[1:05:03] is just anything that's not the complete
[1:05:05] will. That's right. So if I am in this
[1:05:08] in the journey and I stop short and I
[1:05:11] come right to the doorstep and I never
[1:05:13] go all the way in that is still yet
[1:05:15] permissive.
[1:05:17] Amen. Because the perfect is the
[1:05:21] complete. My prayer is God help me
[1:05:23] personally. Amen. As I can learn from
[1:05:26] the example of Lot. I can earn for the
[1:05:27] learn from the example of Ruben and
[1:05:29] these different ones. Lord I don't want
[1:05:30] my own falling short to be the excuse my
[1:05:32] kids use. Oh yeah. I don't want to cause
[1:05:34] my wife to stumble. I I don't want to
[1:05:36] cause you to stumble. I don't want
[1:05:38] because what I point to as a minister, I
[1:05:41] cause you to stop short.
[1:05:44] God help us. Amen. To go fully into the
[1:05:48] new land. It's open up to us a whole new
[1:05:51] field. Amen. That's where we want to be
[1:05:53] living. That's where we want to be
[1:05:54] feeding. That's where we want to stay.
[1:05:58] Somebody who's been fighting alongside
[1:05:59] you for years wants to go and settle
[1:06:01] somewhere short of the promise. wish
[1:06:03] them their best, but you stay where God
[1:06:05] has revealed himself. Let's stand to our
[1:06:09] feet. Let's pray together with you
[1:06:11] today. Just a wonderful, wonderful
[1:06:13] anointing that's upon the people. It's a
[1:06:16] tremendous atmosphere. If we could just
[1:06:18] pray.
[1:06:20] Heavenly Father, today Lord, as we will
[1:06:22] soon dismiss our
[1:06:24] service, fellowship one with another.
[1:06:28] And I pray, Lord, express virtuous
[1:06:32] things and testify of your goodness.
[1:06:35] I ask, Father, that you
[1:06:37] would keep the thought of this sermon
[1:06:42] alive that we would
[1:06:46] learn not so much the caution of where
[1:06:49] we could end up, but so much more the
[1:06:53] tactics of the enemy and what we're
[1:06:54] fighting against and maybe what's
[1:06:56] hindering us and what's keeping us from
[1:06:58] progressing and what's affected our
[1:06:59] children or caused us to not be able to
[1:07:02] live completely in victory.
[1:07:05] And so Lord, my prayer is that we would
[1:07:08] look at this from a real positive place,
[1:07:10] positive
[1:07:12] perspective that none of us here are
[1:07:14] Lot's wife. None of us here are with the
[1:07:15] two and a half tribes. None of us are
[1:07:17] Lot or a Moab or a Balum. None of us are
[1:07:21] of those fathers in Numbers 14. Nor are
[1:07:23] we any one of us the false fathers in
[1:07:26] Numbers 32. But we are your elect. We
[1:07:28] are your children. We are Joshua, Caleb.
[1:07:31] We are your bride. We will possess every
[1:07:34] promise. And what we are up against is
[1:07:36] this spirit of
[1:07:38] mimicry. This spirit of impersonation,
[1:07:41] this copy wrong that claims to have a
[1:07:45] copyright that fights
[1:07:48] us and tells us we're in his will. But
[1:07:51] if we look at it according to your word,
[1:07:52] it's
[1:07:54] permissive. I want all that you have for
[1:07:56] me, Lord. I want the full word of God
[1:07:58] and nothing else. I don't want a cheap
[1:08:01] imitation. I don't want a knockoff. I
[1:08:02] don't want the false. I don't want the
[1:08:04] bogus. I don't want to be just right up
[1:08:07] next to the river where I can see it and
[1:08:10] I can see the ruins of Jericho and
[1:08:11] rejoice of great victories. I can look
[1:08:13] across the river and see all the battles
[1:08:15] won and all the enemies we defeated, but
[1:08:17] still find I've settled on the wrong
[1:08:19] side of the promise. Take me all the way
[1:08:22] into the holiest of holies, Lord. Let me
[1:08:24] live there. Let me abide there. It's
[1:08:26] what David was meaning when I should
[1:08:27] dwell in the house, Lord, forever. He
[1:08:29] didn't want to come and go and come and
[1:08:30] go. He wanted to permanently abide in
[1:08:32] your perfect will. Grant that we could
[1:08:34] do that, Lord. There's healing there.
[1:08:35] There's bread there. There's provision
[1:08:37] there. There's grass for our cattle.
[1:08:38] There's rain for our crops. There's oil.
[1:08:40] There's
[1:08:41] wine. There's everything. Pleasure,
[1:08:44] provision, protection. Everything in
[1:08:47] this land.
[1:08:48] Healing, signs, wonders, gifts, power,
[1:08:52] rejoicing. It's in the land. We need not
[1:08:56] go anywhere else for it. Amen. We just
[1:08:58] need to trust that you'll bring it your
[1:09:00] time according to our obedience
[1:09:03] to think Lord that through obedience we
[1:09:05] can actually produce the evidence of
[1:09:07] your
[1:09:08] blessing to find grass for our cattle
[1:09:10] and wine and all sorts of evidences but
[1:09:12] yet we did it without humbling ourselves
[1:09:14] to the word of God and we're
[1:09:16] blessed Lord as we could continue to

[1:09:20] after scripture see that we are blessed
[1:09:21] but it's your permissive will not your
[1:09:24] perfect will to be in your perfect will
[1:09:26] Lord teach Father, to follow in your
[1:09:28] steps to do that which is right. And
[1:09:31] Lord, I would desire that there'd be a
[1:09:33] hunger for the full word of God to dig
[1:09:34] into these things to find what the
[1:09:37] prophet was pointing to there in 63 64
[1:09:39] and ultimately in ' 65 at the end of his
[1:09:41] ministry is trying to orient us to the
[1:09:43] son of man in this rapture season, the
[1:09:45] bride age. Grant it Lord I pray in the
[1:09:47] name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
