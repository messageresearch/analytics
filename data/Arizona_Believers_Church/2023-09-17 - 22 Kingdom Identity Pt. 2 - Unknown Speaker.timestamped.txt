[0:00] so appreciate your attentiveness you are
[0:03] a wonderful congregation to minister to
[0:05] and we find quite often when ministers
[0:08] are here and they visit they always
[0:10] acknowledge and when they Minister
[0:11] they've always acknowledged just how
[0:13] well you pull on the word of God and
[0:15] just how welcoming you are to the word
[0:17] and it's a real compliment to you and
[0:18] your desire to hear from heaven I'm
[0:21] going to take a second part in this
[0:22] sermon Kingdom identity and again these
[0:27] things are kind of building together as
[0:28] we looked at character being expressed
[0:30] in our lives trying to put the emphasis
[0:32] on how that we live our daily lives and
[0:35] how that the interactions we have on a
[0:37] daily basis the relationships we share
[0:39] on a daily basis and just all the
[0:41] different ways that we live our lives
[0:44] and the different opportunities we have
[0:46] to accomplish things or be in
[0:48] interactions with other people that
[0:49] that's where Christ needs to be having
[0:51] preeminence brother Brandon makes the
[0:54] statement it writes at the very end of
[0:55] the church age book that not for one
[0:57] moment did he come to establish a church
[0:59] or that people would follow him but his
[1:02] interest was that a real relationship
[1:04] would be established between Christ and
[1:06] an individual and that through that
[1:08] individual Christ would be expressed and
[1:10] that really should be the emphasis as we
[1:12] have opportunities to gather together we
[1:14] want to emphasize Christ and lift him up
[1:16] and that he would have preeminence in
[1:18] your individual life so that's really at
[1:20] the heart of these things that we're
[1:21] looking at and as we speak about Kingdom
[1:23] identity it's using that phrase to talk
[1:26] about identifying the kingdom in our
[1:28] lives especially the order of our homes
[1:30] our manner of living as we've spoke
[1:32] about that the life that I live tells a
[1:35] story expresses something and how that
[1:37] our manner of living expresses the
[1:39] character of Christ and a life lived by
[1:42] the word is the word expressed now for
[1:45] the first
[1:46] um part here I want to pick back up some
[1:49] things from last Sunday
[1:51] we're looking at how that God identifies
[1:54] himself by his characteristics and if
[1:57] God identifies himself by his
[1:59] characteristics you need to know what
[2:01] those characteristics are in order to
[2:03] know that that's God
[2:05] and trust that that makes sense and God
[2:07] gave us his word to identify his
[2:10] characteristics and that would be maybe
[2:12] one of the most important aspects about
[2:13] the Bible one of the main things that
[2:15] brother Bradham emphasizes over and over
[2:17] again is this Bible is God in written
[2:19] form it tells us who he was yesterday
[2:21] tells us his mind his heart things that
[2:23] pertain to his desire and so we can
[2:26] always go to the word of God and the
[2:27] word of God tells us this is what God
[2:29] does this is how God thinks this is what
[2:31] God's going to accomplish and so we can
[2:33] learn of his attributes or
[2:35] characteristics from the Bible and then
[2:37] if we know his attributes and we know
[2:39] his characteristics then we can identify
[2:42] them when we see them if we said there's
[2:44] a God but we don't know what he's like
[2:46] and we don't know uh what he speaks
[2:49] about or how he feels or how he
[2:51] manifests himself then we would always
[2:53] be speculating then we'd be in the dark
[2:55] well I wonder if the son is the god and
[2:57] I wonder if that wind that can tear down
[2:58] trees is God and I wonder if fire is the
[3:01] god and there'll always maybe be this
[3:02] sense of we know there's something
[3:04] Beyond ourselves but can't quite put my
[3:06] finger on it but yet the word of God
[3:08] this Bible tells us the characteristics
[3:10] of God therefore we must know his
[3:12] characteristics in order to identify him
[3:15] we were looking at one characteristic in
[3:17] particular in First Corinthians Chapter
[3:18] 14 verse 33 for God is not the author of
[3:22] confusion but of Peace as in all
[3:25] churches of the Saints this is a prophet
[3:28] setting the church in order as he
[3:30] instructed the Corinthian Church uh to
[3:33] how to use the gifts and how to judge
[3:36] the gifts and how to order themselves
[3:37] how to deal with sin in their midst he
[3:40] is saying that God is and this is the
[3:42] prophet setting this church in order and
[3:44] it becomes a template of how that God's
[3:46] prophets set the age in order
[3:48] and he says he's not the author the
[3:50] beginner the establisher of confusion
[3:52] which is instability God is not the
[3:55] author of disorder or chaos but he is
[3:57] the author of Peace which is harmony or
[4:00] Accord it doesn't mean everything has to
[4:03] be the same but it means that
[4:04] differences harmonize and that if one is
[4:07] different here it's complementary to the
[4:09] other who's different over here and they
[4:11] just seem to work together like cogs in
[4:13] a will that they're they're not chipping
[4:15] one another they're not breaking apart
[4:16] they're not causing things to wobble but
[4:18] there's Harmony in accord even among the
[4:20] different sounds and the different
[4:22] voices and the different gifts and so we
[4:24] see that God is a god this is the main
[4:27] thing I'm still wanting to identify as
[4:29] God is a god of order
[4:31] God is the god of arrangement he puts
[4:33] things together
[4:34] and so when we see this in First
[4:36] Corinthians 14 that's a way of looking
[4:38] into the word and identifying a
[4:40] characteristic of God that God is a God
[4:43] not he doesn't author confusion but he
[4:45] authors peace
[4:47] he off authors order
[4:49] in the sermon the Feast of the trumpets
[4:51] I hope that this can kind of resonate in
[4:53] more ways than just uh uh emphasizing
[4:57] the point that if God is identified by
[4:59] his characteristics you've got to know
[5:00] his characteristics
[5:02] says we've come we've got to come to a
[5:04] place again to something that's going to
[5:06] introduce the Messiah let this really
[5:08] weigh Heavy in Your Hearts what he's
[5:10] trying to say here is he's talking about
[5:11] John the Baptist and now there's got to
[5:13] come something in this last days to
[5:15] introduce the Messiah he says and how
[5:17] will the people
[5:18] that's believe in him know it unless
[5:21] they're constantly in the word to know
[5:23] what he is
[5:24] how are they going to know the Messiah
[5:26] unless then there's got to be something
[5:27] to introduce the Messiah and if there's
[5:30] one introduced to the Messiah but you're
[5:31] not in the word to know what the Messiah
[5:33] is going to look like
[5:35] he's saying how are they going to know
[5:36] what he is Daniel said the wise shall
[5:38] know but the foolish the unwise wouldn't
[5:40] know
[5:41] they shall know their God now how he
[5:44] shall appear now this is him and his
[5:46] characteristics this is the word of God
[5:48] uh that's prophesied for this age being
[5:50] identified and God identified himself
[5:52] with those prophecies he says how he
[5:54] shall appear in the last days is to
[5:56] bring the people back to the word so
[5:59] that the bride will know her husband
[6:01] know her mate the revealed word
[6:04] so he manifests himself in a certain way
[6:06] in the last days and he's referring to
[6:09] how he shall appear in the way that
[6:11] identifies himself in the last days it
[6:13] says that the bride will know her mate
[6:16] now this is that's the first part I want
[6:18] you to catch from this is that God has
[6:20] identified in his characteristics and
[6:22] how are you going to know his
[6:23] characteristics unless you're in the
[6:25] word to know what he's how he's going to
[6:28] appear how he's going to make himself
[6:29] known but now join that with how he says
[6:32] that the word will reveal itself so that
[6:35] the bride will know her husband
[6:37] and he says that's why this has to
[6:40] happen it wasn't in the reformers wasn't
[6:42] in Luther Wesley in the Pentecostals and
[6:44] them scripture says it wasn't but it
[6:47] will come
[6:48] that is his promise for this age we're
[6:51] living in the age that his coming will
[6:53] be in very outstanding statements then
[6:56] he says she must be identified in him
[6:59] this is the second part I hope that kind
[7:01] of holds here for a little bit while we
[7:03] background some things so you can see
[7:04] just how important this relationship is
[7:07] the bride must be identified in him as
[7:09] how we'll say that there any woman must
[7:12] be identified with their husband for the
[7:14] two are one
[7:16] now if you were hoping that wasn't the
[7:18] case well we just ruined we just ruined
[7:21] your hopes because if you're married
[7:22] you're identified in your mate you're
[7:24] identified in your spouse and he's
[7:25] saying the woman must be identified with
[7:27] her husband the tour one and Christ's
[7:29] bride has to be identified with him for
[7:32] the two are one and he is the word not
[7:34] the denomination the word
[7:36] so the word is the Kingdom right here is
[7:38] the system the spirit and the life the
[7:41] kingdom is the the word and spirit made
[7:43] flesh in our lives and so there's an
[7:45] identification that comes when Christ
[7:48] unites with his bride in this end time
[7:50] and he said the bride must be identified
[7:53] with her husband
[7:54] and in the spiritual union between
[7:56] Christ and his bride there are certain
[7:58] characteristics and attributes that he's
[8:00] wanting to display through Us in ways
[8:02] that he wants to have preeminence in our
[8:04] lives and so we're in the process of
[8:06] yielding to that
[8:07] just as when a man and a woman get
[8:09] married uh it's not the love I believe
[8:12] is instinctive many times you just find
[8:13] that your love and you just can't help
[8:15] it the attraction could be instinctive
[8:17] but when two lives begin to blend
[8:19] together there there's a conscious
[8:21] yielding there's a conscience
[8:23] acknowledgment and adapting and learning
[8:26] as each one begins to understand the
[8:29] other person's Rhythm and and ways that
[8:31] they express themselves and what their
[8:32] likes and dislikes are so it's not that
[8:34] you just get married and immediately
[8:36] have it figured out
[8:37] you know there's and I think this is
[8:39] even true in parenting that you have to
[8:42] there's a lot of Grace maybe even we can
[8:44] have uh and as we grow in this message
[8:46] and we have third and fourth and fifth
[8:48] generation uh message families some of
[8:50] us need to take a step back and realize
[8:52] we weren't raised by parents who were
[8:54] raised with Truth uh they they came to
[8:57] truth it was zealous and sincere and
[8:59] begin to have children and they didn't
[9:01] have it all figured out what the
[9:03] standards of the word were and how to
[9:04] raise children and how to respond to
[9:06] difficulties and they did the best that
[9:08] they could with what they had and and
[9:11] the most outstanding characteristic you
[9:13] look for in a parent or any individual
[9:14] is not whether or not they have it all
[9:16] figured out but whether they're willing
[9:18] to learn
[9:19] and so there's an adapting there's a
[9:20] growing there's a there's a way that
[9:22] we're growing into this identification
[9:24] with Christ where we're learning to
[9:25] yield we're learning to Humble ourselves
[9:27] as we just sang
[9:29] and so the Bible says again Paul writing
[9:31] to the Corinthian Church let all things
[9:33] be done decently and in order
[9:37] I believe a marriage is an arrangement
[9:38] it's an order and let all things be
[9:41] decently in order identifying how that
[9:43] God is a god of order a god of a range
[9:45] and a god of setting things together let
[9:48] all things be done decently that means
[9:49] in proper form with becoming reverence
[9:52] in the Latin it speaks of some the Forma
[9:54] to be beautiful well-shaped and shapely
[9:57] in an appropriate way that there's a
[10:00] certain symmetry uh even naturally
[10:02] there's things that we see whether we
[10:04] would attribute it to a golden ratio or
[10:06] just certain things that we we
[10:07] identified as beautiful because of the
[10:10] Symmetry are there certain things you
[10:12] can do with photography and the the rule
[10:13] of thirds where you can frame things a
[10:16] certain way and it's naturally pleasing
[10:18] to the eye because order symmetry
[10:20] Arrangement colors and things there's a
[10:23] beauty to it and so God is a god of
[10:26] order he's a god of decency a god of
[10:29] beauty the proper Beauty and let all
[10:31] things be done in order it means a fixed
[10:33] Arrangement it do in the right order
[10:37] an orderly condition
[10:40] and brother Branham says put everything
[10:41] in its place and then operate in decency
[10:44] and in order
[10:45] and he's saying all gifts
[10:47] he says this about that put everything
[10:49] in its place and then operate in decency
[10:50] in an order you'll find God as a god of
[10:52] order and he will bring the right thing
[10:55] the thing right up then
[10:57] so a place for everything and everything
[10:59] in its place God is a god of order if
[11:03] you put it in its place God will bring
[11:05] the thing right up then he'll use it
[11:08] and these are a character this is a
[11:10] characteristic of God he's a god of
[11:12] order
[11:13] now let's look at Isaiah chapter four
[11:16] verses one to two and hopefully we could
[11:19] just add some notations here to kind of
[11:21] help a little bit as we read through
[11:23] this and I'm hoping to go a little bit
[11:24] further in Isaiah Chapter 4 verses 1 and
[11:27] 2.
[11:28] I hope they just get a hit on this very
[11:30] quickly
[11:31] it says in that day seven women shall
[11:34] take hold of one man
[11:37] now when you read this there's a lot of
[11:39] a lot of Truth to how this can be
[11:40] applied historically how the times of
[11:43] this judgment and the men that are
[11:45] falling by The Sword and the mighty are
[11:47] going to be dying in War uh that there's
[11:49] going to be a loss of men and not
[11:51] available husbands there's a lot of
[11:53] things that may be correct in a natural
[11:55] sense historically but we find that
[11:57] there's great type spiritually to this
[11:59] condition and even brother Branham
[12:01] identifying it in flashing red lights
[12:03] how that this is indicative of the last
[12:05] days it's in the last times and so
[12:07] there's a spiritual attitude that's also
[12:09] implied here and in that day seven women
[12:12] shall take hold of one man saying we
[12:14] will eat our own bread and wear our own
[12:17] apparel
[12:18] now this signifies that if we want to
[12:22] look at the context they were just
[12:23] desperate to be to to have a name or to
[12:26] be married there's not a respect for the
[12:28] union and that seven women are all happy
[12:30] just to have one man's name but let's
[12:33] just continue to live our lives they
[12:35] just want to be called by his name to
[12:37] take away their reproach now if I could
[12:39] just say that's confusion
[12:41] that's not the order or Arrangement that
[12:43] God established in the beginning this is
[12:45] chaotic and so this is a condition the
[12:48] seven women characterizes the time it
[12:50] characterized the society it
[12:52] characterized the age that Isaiah is
[12:54] writing in and it's describing the women
[12:57] who are described or it's the condition
[12:59] it's the actions of the women that are
[13:01] described in Isaiah chapter 3 which if I
[13:04] could summarize is very prideful very
[13:06] vain very self-shirt sir they're
[13:08] sticking their necks out uh they're very
[13:11] prideful their vanity about the Flesh
[13:13] and this is the condition of the age and
[13:18] the condition of the women the Bible is
[13:19] drawn in Isaiah chapter three and then
[13:21] it is Isaiah chapter 4 showing how the
[13:24] women represent the condition of Israel
[13:27] now if we could just uh get that in our
[13:29] minds this principle that God the Bible
[13:31] says that the men shall fall by the
[13:33] sword but when he's taking the
[13:35] temperature of Israel as a nation he
[13:37] describes the daughters of Zion and then
[13:39] he says these women I will take a hold
[13:41] of one man and he's using the women to
[13:43] describe the spiritual condition of all
[13:46] the people
[13:48] then the next verse in that day shall
[13:50] the branch of the Lord be beautiful and
[13:51] glorious and the fruit of the Earth
[13:52] shall be excellent and comely
[13:54] for them that are escaped of Israel this
[13:56] is the proper order this is the beauty
[13:58] and Arrangement this is the power in
[14:00] order and this is describing a warm
[14:04] women who are there's no pretense
[14:06] there's no hypocrisy
[14:08] they're perfectly in order and arranged
[14:10] and it's going to take the spirit of
[14:12] judgment to do that
[14:13] the spirit of discernment
[14:15] this is
[14:17] this verse would speak of the Bride who
[14:20] has had the word come and put her in her
[14:21] place
[14:24] and now we could see two different women
[14:26] portrayed the branch of the Lord which
[14:28] is beautiful in verse two and these
[14:29] seven women these chaotic women in verse
[14:32] 1. and brother Branham says in the
[14:34] invisible unit of the bride of Christ
[14:36] notice this character
[14:38] when you see women just going on the
[14:40] Rampage just doing anything they want to
[14:42] do watch the church is doing the same
[14:45] thing
[14:46] so we could see that the the modern
[14:49] Church which is a spirit
[14:51] parallels the modern women how that they
[14:54] act in their flesh it says when you see
[14:55] women in the natural going on a rampage
[14:58] wanting certain things doing certain
[15:00] things expressing themselves a certain
[15:01] way he said you know the church is doing
[15:03] the same thing now it may not be
[15:05] manifested itself in the same way that
[15:07] it is in the world but he said it's the
[15:09] same Spirit that's driving the two and
[15:11] this is a prophet saying when you see
[15:13] the world in society going after these
[15:15] things know that the church is also in
[15:18] the same condition so what is expressed
[15:20] naturally in society in entertainment
[15:23] and fashion in these things is the
[15:25] condition of the church nominally in a
[15:27] spiritual way so the church condition
[15:30] reflect is reflected in the condition of
[15:32] the women and the condition of the women
[15:33] is reflect they both kind of work
[15:35] together
[15:36] so if you look at the spiritual
[15:38] condition of laodicea then you know that
[15:41] that's going to be a natural temptation
[15:43] to the women in laodicea those things
[15:45] hold together he says in the sermon and
[15:48] knoweth it not just watch the way women
[15:49] act and I'll show you where the church
[15:52] is
[15:53] this is
[15:54] this is
[15:55] not not being able to say well watch
[15:57] women in the world they like to do this
[15:59] and sure enough you know here's the
[16:03] church here's the steeple open the door
[16:04] and there's all the people and they're
[16:06] doing exactly what the world's doing no
[16:08] sometimes it doesn't look just exactly
[16:10] like it but no that's the spirit
[16:12] operating in the church
[16:14] it'll manifest itself in different ways
[16:17] and that that can just that's that ought
[16:19] to sober us up quite a bit when we see
[16:22] the nonsense going on in the world today
[16:24] on and how much when we see it peeking
[16:27] its head up in the nominal churches and
[16:29] the denominations are saying well we are
[16:31] letting down the bars and we're going to
[16:32] accommodate this and we're going to
[16:34] change this and we're going to change
[16:35] that and they're becoming what they call
[16:37] more tolerant of certain things and we
[16:39] see the church world going that way
[16:40] that's just what's coming to the surface
[16:43] think about what really lurks underneath
[16:46] organized religion whether it has a
[16:48] Baptist name or some other name or
[16:49] independent name there is a spirit in
[16:52] the nominal Church working in the world
[16:54] we're working through the church
[16:56] religious system and organized religion
[16:58] that is also manifesting in the people
[17:00] in the age that we live in
[17:03] so there's those two he says watch the
[17:05] women there's the church he said the
[17:07] women
[17:08] morals is in laodicea in the world
[17:11] physically naked miserable blind and
[17:13] don't know it the people the woman of
[17:15] the world and the church is in the same
[17:17] stage there's brother random saying it
[17:19] that he's looking at a
[17:22] the Revelations chapter 3 this is what
[17:25] the angel is going to say to the church
[17:27] as he's diagnosis in a spiritual
[17:28] condition now he's saying that she's
[17:30] even naked
[17:32] and a physical condition stripping her
[17:34] clothes off and and acting in a certain
[17:37] way and he says you see the morals in
[17:39] the world it's laodicea
[17:41] so the world is morally in allowed to
[17:43] see an age and the church is spiritually
[17:46] in a layout of same age and always
[17:48] remind yourself that the spirit has not
[17:51] one good thing to say about laodicea
[17:55] so glad the prophet introduced us to a
[17:57] bright age
[17:59] which creates quite a paradox because
[18:01] brother man says this is a woman's age
[18:03] this is a woman's world
[18:05] but there's a way that Christ has made
[18:07] this a bright age so that you can
[18:08] recognize your place in him
[18:10] and the sermon does God ever change his
[18:12] mind about his word I want to use this
[18:15] kind of as a little bit of a fulcrum to
[18:17] shift
[18:19] more specifically into I'm going to use
[18:22] Jezebel to do so
[18:25] into more specifically my thought this
[18:27] morning says if you want to know where
[18:28] the church is standing watch the women
[18:30] I'm sure you all recognize this is a
[18:32] constant theme in the message of the
[18:34] hour where he's he's using the women in
[18:36] the natural to understand the spiritual
[18:38] condition of the church so he says if
[18:40] you want to know where the church is
[18:41] standing watch the women watch the
[18:43] morals among the women because she's a
[18:46] representation of the church
[18:49] now I feel just to preface this now
[18:52] so that there's a little bit of a
[18:54] uh
[18:56] you're you're thinking more balanced
[18:59] there's a way that this could be used as
[19:01] a club to bully women I'm it's been done
[19:04] for decades
[19:06] but no man can swing that club
[19:10] on a woman without indicting himself
[19:12] without having to examine himself first
[19:14] and if he's using it as a club it
[19:15] indicts him
[19:17] so no man using these things to bully a
[19:20] woman is absolved he's guilty himself of
[19:23] whatever it is he's beaten the woman up
[19:24] with if that's how he wants to use the
[19:26] word of God to put the woman in her
[19:28] place I did a series one time and it was
[19:30] titled putting the woman in her place
[19:31] and I used the title at the outset and I
[19:33] had to warn everybody just stay with me
[19:35] this isn't going where you think it's
[19:36] going to go and sure enough we had more
[19:38] visitors from the neighborhood that
[19:39] night than ever before
[19:41] and and I don't remember if they left
[19:43] early or not but there is there is a
[19:46] the man is not innocent if I could say
[19:50] this sometimes you just get so hyper
[19:51] focused on that we just feel men could
[19:53] just feel like yeah blame it on the
[19:55] woman and that's not what's being
[19:56] implied here it says watch the morals
[19:59] among the women because she's a
[20:00] representation of the church when you
[20:02] see the pollution amongst the women you
[20:04] find the pollution in the church could
[20:06] we not say the same in Isaiah chapter 3
[20:08] that the women were a clear sign that
[20:10] the priesthood had let down their job
[20:12] that the women were clear sign that
[20:14] fathers were failing in their home the
[20:15] women were a clear sign that Israel had
[20:18] become untethered from the promises of
[20:19] God and were giving themselves over the
[20:21] wrong kind of influences when you see
[20:23] pollution among the women there's
[20:24] pollution in the church what she become
[20:27] a painted up Jezebel just exactly what
[20:30] the church has become
[20:31] now that's the truth and you know that
[20:34] if you want to know where the church is
[20:35] watch the morals among your women
[20:37] because she is the church is a woman
[20:42] and as he says uses the uh reference to
[20:45] paint it up Jezebel but the round takes
[20:48] Leo to see an age and he makes it
[20:49] synonymous with Jezebel religion and he
[20:51] says laodicea Jezebel he takes that
[20:54] statement in a few places where he's
[20:55] connecting them together so Jezebel is a
[20:58] type of the modern Church she's a type
[21:01] of even the Modern Woman
[21:04] brother Branham says this laodicea means
[21:07] woman in the Greek
[21:10] a time when women take over
[21:14] and I feel qualified to speak on this
[21:16] because I had the highest grade in my
[21:18] feminist political thought class When I
[21:19] Was An undergraduate
[21:22] to the you know I was hated hated by all
[21:27] these feminist starter kits who just
[21:30] couldn't stand the fact that maybe a
[21:32] born-again Christian who carried my Bob
[21:33] with a class every day had the highest
[21:35] grade in the class
[21:38] but I did it it's because I had I knew
[21:41] already
[21:42] from the message of hour I know I know
[21:44] what's going on here
[21:45] I have full disclosure the professor did
[21:47] think I was quite unfair to all the
[21:49] feminists we had to write about but she
[21:51] said my points were always well argued
[21:52] and well written and therefore I had the
[21:54] highest grade in the class
[21:57] does that make me a feminist
[22:01] so laodicea means woman in the Greek a
[22:04] time when women take over so this is the
[22:07] age
[22:08] and he says take over this is clearly
[22:10] alluding to leaving their place
[22:13] not being in a proper order or
[22:15] Arrangement now as he points to Jezebel
[22:17] I think this is a great place to kind of
[22:19] move forward to as we enter the 11
[22:21] o'clock hour it says in First Kings
[22:23] chapter 16 verses 30 to 33 I think
[22:26] you're well versed in kind of the story
[22:27] of Ahab so hopefully we can just um
[22:30] touch on this very quickly and go
[22:32] forward and Ahab the son of Omri did
[22:34] evil in the sight of the Lord above all
[22:37] that were before him now that's quite a
[22:39] statement
[22:40] that Ahab at this point in history did
[22:43] more evil than everyone else before him
[22:45] and it came to pass as if it had been a
[22:48] light thing for him to walk in the sins
[22:49] of jeroboam the son of nebuch now what
[22:52] jeroboam did is he he worshiped God but
[22:55] used golden calves in doing so there was
[22:57] a I there was idolatry in the worship of
[23:00] the one true God but now the writer and
[23:02] the Hebrew is like as if it was a small
[23:04] thing what jeroboam did he aggravates it
[23:07] further and it's not just bringing
[23:09] idolatry into the worship of God this is
[23:13] even going full scale into idolatry it
[23:17] says that he took to wife Jezebel and
[23:21] the daughter of f Bell King of the zaida
[23:23] zydenians and went and served Baal and
[23:26] worshiped him
[23:28] this is important how they reference the
[23:31] fact that he married Jezebel and how she
[23:33] is a daughter of a heathen King an
[23:37] idolater she's an idolater herself this
[23:39] is not this isn't uh you know a story of
[23:44] redemption if I could just say that
[23:46] and he reared up an altar bill in the
[23:49] house of bill which he built in Samaria
[23:51] now this is not
[23:53] taking
[23:55] an inside or a symbol from The Exodus
[23:58] this is not taking elements and things
[24:00] that were tried to use to worship God
[24:02] and we're trying to worship God we're
[24:04] trying to worship the one true God and
[24:06] idolatry being expressed that way this
[24:07] is an abandonment of the one true God
[24:09] now it's overtly worshiping Baal
[24:13] and they have made a Grove and Ahab did
[24:16] more to provoke the Lord God of Israel
[24:18] to anger than all the kings of Israel
[24:21] that were before him
[24:23] this is quite a statement
[24:25] and what is Central to ahab's conduct
[24:29] is it's through the marriage to Jezebel
[24:32] that Ahab sinned greater than all others
[24:34] before him
[24:36] and it was critical that they recognized
[24:39] and I know there's more to the story of
[24:41] Jezebel where you can begin to recognize
[24:42] how cruel she was
[24:44] and how much she just wasn't saying well
[24:46] let me just worship
[24:47] Ahab just let me worship God in the way
[24:49] that I want to worship I know we're a
[24:51] blended family and and I'm a Jew and
[24:53] you're a Catholic and you know you can
[24:55] worship your God the way you want to and
[24:56] all it wasn't that she actually was
[24:59] cruel to where she wanted to murder and
[25:01] kill the prophets of God she wanted to
[25:04] impose her ideas and her religion and
[25:07] her attitude so there's more to this
[25:09] than just well a difference of opinion
[25:11] or a difference of theology but Jezebel
[25:14] means the exalted wife of Baal her very
[25:17] name identifies her as being a the wife
[25:20] of Baal she was identified with false
[25:23] worship she was overt about it it wasn't
[25:26] that she was the daughter of of of
[25:30] Israelite and Ahab marries her and
[25:33] findings out later that she was actually
[25:34] something else no this was clear she was
[25:36] a daughter of an idolter she was an open
[25:38] idolater she was very Brash about it
[25:40] she's very open about it and yet the
[25:43] King still married her
[25:48] the King still took her to wife
[25:51] despite the fact that he knew what she
[25:54] was at least on the outside
[25:58] now it is through his marriage to
[26:00] Jezebel that
[26:02] Baal worship is instituted in the
[26:04] Kingdom
[26:06] Jezebel's a type of laodicea
[26:09] where I want to emphasize for a little
[26:11] bit today is how that Jezebel
[26:15] through her her her idol worship and her
[26:19] attitude or hatred and her sorcery and
[26:22] her cruelty she actually reflected
[26:24] something in Ahab
[26:26] yeah I mean Ahab could have sat there
[26:29] said yeah I don't know I don't know what
[26:30] happened she was just so sweet when I
[26:32] met her and and she's she really was a
[26:35] good girl and I didn't see this coming
[26:37] at all and it's like her name was wife
[26:39] of Baal right she was a idol worship
[26:42] yeah I know I did you know I just
[26:44] thought you know I thought she had an
[26:46] accent I thought she was you know just
[26:48] like there's it wasn't there's no way
[26:49] that he could kind of wash his hands of
[26:51] all of it and say I I made a huge
[26:54] mistake it was something within Ahab
[26:57] that is now being highlighted in Jezebel
[27:01] and now as we say that trying to draw on
[27:04] some things we've ministered already
[27:05] laodicea as a church age of the
[27:08] laodicean church and the women of
[27:09] laodicea they reflect their designer who
[27:12] was Satan
[27:13] and in that design they ultimately in
[27:16] little cnh reject Christ it's a
[27:19] rejection of headship so here was one
[27:21] that was born uh to a an idol worshiping
[27:24] father and and she is raised in idolatry
[27:27] she's been given a name of idolatry and
[27:30] now she marries a king she has
[27:33] opportunity now
[27:35] to receive truth she has opportunity to
[27:37] worship the one true God but yet she
[27:40] does not Embrace God she rejects God
[27:44] and so Jezebel was openly an idolater
[27:48] that influenced Ahab to establish the
[27:50] worship of Baal
[27:52] now if I could start emphasizing this a
[27:55] little bit in spiritual Amnesia brother
[27:57] says we are identified with our families
[27:59] in this human life by marriage so our
[28:01] identification comes from family I don't
[28:04] know if any of you had this experience
[28:06] growing up with the last name McGeary
[28:07] that after after a while people said oh
[28:10] you're a megiri and they would always
[28:11] ask you about your brothers anybody else
[28:13] any mcgeary's here have that experience
[28:15] and so there'd be things that people
[28:17] would ask because there's a there's an
[28:20] identification with the name did you do
[28:23] you have a pet ducky and were you raised
[28:24] a Catholic and maybe there's a lot of
[28:26] name questions people ask you because
[28:28] there's an association with the family
[28:30] characteristics and I've always said
[28:32] there's just something about mcgeary's
[28:33] that stick out sticks out and so there's
[28:36] there's family characteristics that
[28:38] identify us so this program is just
[28:40] pointing to a very obvious truth we are
[28:42] identified with our families and by our
[28:44] marriages it says and with our wives we
[28:47] marry and our families identified by the
[28:49] union of our marriage I know this is
[28:52] stating the obvious
[28:54] but I think we ought to kind of lean
[28:55] into that a little bit and recognize
[28:57] that marriage is so critical to God it's
[29:00] so important that God instituted it in
[29:03] the garden it's a very precious thing
[29:04] and so through a union there's
[29:06] identification and individuals though
[29:09] they may have been separate before
[29:11] through a union it had there's this
[29:13] identification that takes place and it
[29:16] ought to be an amplification to where
[29:19] now we have a greater light we have a
[29:21] greater glory we have a greater
[29:22] reflection through that Union and so
[29:25] marriage who we marry the wives and the
[29:28] husbands to the wives in life we are
[29:30] identified by our marriages
[29:33] so Ahab was identified by his marriage
[29:37] to Jezebel
[29:38] people could have been speculating well
[29:40] we wonder what kind of King he's going
[29:41] to be we want to kind of man he is and
[29:43] we see traits in him good leadership
[29:45] traits and there's a there's this chance
[29:47] that maybe he can do better uh than than
[29:51] those they're aboam and these others
[29:53] that here's this chance uh maybe Omri
[29:56] was a good man and here's a chance for
[29:57] him to do this or he was an evil man and
[29:59] Ahab looks like he has a better
[30:01] opportunity well when he married that
[30:03] was a red flag
[30:05] and so ahab's character when I say
[30:07] character I want you to think of a lot
[30:09] of different things
[30:10] but whether we want to speak about what
[30:12] he's trying to accomplish in terms of
[30:14] his motives and his objectives what kind
[30:16] of Ambitions would he have what what
[30:18] things does he promote and like and his
[30:20] affections and what drives him so it's
[30:23] his character
[30:25] that led him
[30:27] character was a part his character
[30:31] was part of the process that led him to
[30:33] marrying her
[30:35] and then it was part
[30:38] of him allowing her to influence him
[30:41] trying to be uh very succinct in how I
[30:45] described that
[30:46] we could say that perhaps it was a
[30:49] character flaw that led him to Mary
[30:51] Jezebel
[30:52] and yet we could all just wait was it
[30:55] and now when she leads him
[30:57] and she be she she uh is wearing the
[31:00] male tunic in the family and she's
[31:02] leading things then it then we know oh
[31:05] it was a character flaw in him
[31:07] because her character's not changed
[31:11] there is no name change for her we're
[31:14] not reading the story of Redemption
[31:15] where it says in uh Ahab the son of Omri
[31:18] uh married this This Woman This daughter
[31:23] of f about King of the zydonians and
[31:26] changed her name
[31:28] and gave her a Hebrew name and changed
[31:31] her character and we don't see the story
[31:34] of redemption her character's not
[31:36] changed her worship is not changed but
[31:39] what we see rather is she exposes the
[31:41] poor character of Ahab and she
[31:42] encourages the poor character Ahab and
[31:45] now her as an idol worshiper and the son
[31:48] of the daughter of ethma she is now
[31:51] influenced Ahab to build Groves and to
[31:55] worship Baal so notice how the influence
[31:58] of the woman over the man the man had an
[32:00] opportunity in the marriage Union to
[32:02] bring out something better in Jezebel
[32:04] but now she brings out the worst in ahem
[32:07] and that's a lesson in any marriage
[32:10] sometimes you see people getting married
[32:13] and no we've never seen this and we've
[32:15] never said that that you know she was
[32:16] the worst thing for him we're just that
[32:18] just crazy thought right we've never
[32:20] said that about anybody but if you've
[32:22] ever said it and thought to it's because
[32:24] when you see somebody who has a weakness
[32:25] and they marry somebody who only
[32:26] encourages that weakness instead of
[32:28] covers it
[32:29] these are real challenges sometimes in
[32:31] our marriage we've got to be open to the
[32:32] things that were weak in what others are
[32:34] strong in and encourage one another
[32:38] in Proverbs chapter 12 verse 4 it says a
[32:40] virtuous woman is a crown to her husband
[32:43] but she that maketh ashamed is a
[32:45] rottenness in his bones I think we
[32:46] looked at this in the perfect love
[32:48] series we've looked at it a few other
[32:50] times recently
[32:52] a Godly wife would have been a crowning
[32:54] to ahab's throne
[32:56] had he married a Godly woman his brother
[32:59] Bradham says a Godly woman is a a good
[33:01] woman is a jewel in a man's Crown he
[33:03] says she should be honored
[33:05] so a good a virtuous woman is a crown to
[33:09] her husband as we said before kind of a
[33:11] coronation of the man
[33:13] she is she's a crowning glory to a man
[33:15] but she that maketh the shamed is the
[33:18] rightness in his bones the right kind of
[33:20] wife is a symbol of the husband's rule
[33:22] his dignity his honors the crown would
[33:24] represent Authority the right kind of
[33:26] woman is a represents his authority his
[33:28] honor his power his dignity his
[33:30] character
[33:31] but a woman that shames her husband
[33:34] strips him of his honor
[33:36] strips him of his power
[33:38] and for a woman to do that shames him
[33:40] but then also if a woman shames him in
[33:42] other ways it robs him of his power
[33:44] because it reflects what's in him
[33:47] and corrupts him
[33:49] marriage is intended to be a source of
[33:51] Honor
[33:52] marriage is intended to be a source of
[33:53] happiness
[33:55] far exceed in anything else that God
[33:57] could give outside of Christ
[33:59] says in the choosing of a bride when God
[34:01] gave a man a wife he gave him the best
[34:04] thing he could give him outside of
[34:05] Salvation he says that more than one
[34:07] time right so this places for for a man
[34:11] the woman is the best thing that God
[34:14] could give
[34:15] him outside of Salvation now that tells
[34:18] us something about God
[34:20] right could we not could we not take
[34:22] that principle that if God looks at a
[34:24] man and says the best thing I can give
[34:26] you outside of Salvation is a wife God
[34:29] not needing salvation has tipped his
[34:31] hand that the one thing he wants and the
[34:33] best thing he could have is a bride
[34:35] God gave a man a wife he gave him the
[34:37] best thing he could give him outside of
[34:38] salvation but when one goes to trying to
[34:40] take a man's place then she's about the
[34:42] worst thing that he could get a hold of
[34:44] now why is it that she could be the
[34:47] worst thing that a man could get a hold
[34:48] of because of the other side
[34:51] because she occupies such a wonderful
[34:53] position in the marriage Union that
[34:55] without the woman there is no Union
[34:56] there is no marriage and since she is a
[34:58] symbol of the husband's dignity dignity
[35:00] and Rule since she is a crowning to the
[35:02] husband it's saying that a woman that
[35:04] makes ashamed is rotness in his bones it
[35:06] robs him of power and vitality and
[35:08] happiness that strips away his honor and
[35:09] his power because she has no no one has
[35:12] any greater potential to raise a man up
[35:15] and to encourage a man like a wife she
[35:18] has the equal power and opposite to tear
[35:20] him down and corrupt him
[35:23] when man gave God man was given a wife
[35:26] by God it was the best thing but a woman
[35:28] who won't
[35:29] take the place that God gave her he says
[35:32] about the worst thing
[35:34] the Bible says in First Corinthians
[35:35] chapter 11 verses 7 8 9 for man indeed
[35:38] ought not to cover his head
[35:40] for as much as he is the image and the
[35:42] glory of God we know that Jesus Christ
[35:44] was in the image of God the express
[35:46] image of his person
[35:47] and that when God made man he made him
[35:49] in his image that's the that's man in
[35:52] the beginning
[35:53] that Paul says this this is very rich
[35:55] deep I would say theology or teaching or
[35:58] doctrine he says but the woman is the
[36:00] glory of the man God who is invisible
[36:03] whom we have not seen is made visible in
[36:06] Jesus Christ he declared to us the glory
[36:08] of God and we beheld his glory as the
[36:10] scripture tells us we can say visan is
[36:12] in the glory of the father but now
[36:14] Mankind in the beginning when God
[36:16] created Adam he was made in the image of
[36:18] God and therefore the male is in the
[36:21] image and glory of God
[36:23] represented in creation he says but the
[36:25] woman this is a great thought here the
[36:27] woman is the glory of the man
[36:30] for the man is not of the woman but the
[36:33] woman is of the man basically saying the
[36:36] man is not of the man but the one of the
[36:39] man is of the man because one man means
[36:41] of man
[36:42] so it's just it's really semantic saying
[36:44] the one who's of the man is of the man
[36:47] but the man is not of the man the man is
[36:48] the man
[36:51] for the man is not of the woman but the
[36:53] woman is of the man neither was the Man
[36:56] created for the woman but the woman for
[36:58] the man but then Paul says but the man
[36:59] is by the woman
[37:01] you keep reading so again there's
[37:03] there's always something in the word of
[37:04] God that's going to trip up the person
[37:06] is going to try to take it into extremes
[37:08] so the man is not of the one who's of
[37:10] the man but the woman is of the man and
[37:13] the man was not created for the woman
[37:15] but the woman for the man
[37:17] again man in the beginning being the
[37:19] image and the likeness of God and then
[37:21] the woman comes out of that one who is
[37:22] in the image of God now she is out of
[37:26] the man and she is the crowning of
[37:28] creation
[37:29] the woman crowned creation we know that
[37:31] when God was looking at it he comes to
[37:33] the conclusion that it is very good to
[37:36] it is not good and the reason why it was
[37:38] not good is because the best thing that
[37:40] God could achieve was a wife and hear a
[37:43] man in the image of God is without a
[37:45] wife and Adam as of yet not needing
[37:47] salvation the best thing God could give
[37:49] him and the coronation of who he was and
[37:51] the best thing that God could provide
[37:52] for him was one who was like him and
[37:55] complimentary to him and that was a
[37:57] woman and so that is God's the woman is
[38:01] the Bible says the glory of the man
[38:05] the woman was a gift from God
[38:07] 's first gift to his son
[38:10] was a wife
[38:13] one that was complementary to the man
[38:17] I
[38:18] I I I think there's so much positive we
[38:20] could take from this
[38:22] God is desirous to see that we have
[38:24] strong marriages
[38:25] that if there's any kind of weakness at
[38:27] all in our marriage then we ought not to
[38:30] take that as a sign say well I I love my
[38:32] wife or I love my husband or we're
[38:34] married we've got a certificate whatever
[38:35] it might be and he said well this is a
[38:37] union because we're both on the deed
[38:39] however you want to talk about it and
[38:41] then be discouraged because well it
[38:43] certainly doesn't look like what we're
[38:44] thinking over here and it doesn't look
[38:45] like the one that Christ has with his
[38:47] bride give you ought to have courage to
[38:50] know that the stability of that Union
[38:52] the strength of that Union the
[38:53] trajectory of that Union matters to God
[38:55] because in that Union is a very powerful
[38:58] reflection
[38:59] and that if there's any weakness in it
[39:01] humanity is sown and in it has been has
[39:04] sewn it into it and the devil's trying
[39:06] to exploit that it's not God who does it
[39:09] there's so much that could be said in
[39:10] this about the marriage itself we're
[39:12] wanting to kind of look at this uh the
[39:14] woman being a reflection of it the woman
[39:16] was a gift from God to man in Proverbs
[39:19] 18 22 who so findeth the wife findeth a
[39:22] good thing and obtain its favor of the
[39:24] Lord
[39:25] this is God's attitude towards a good
[39:28] wife this is God's attitude towards
[39:30] marriage that if a man finds a wife he
[39:32] finds a good thing and in being married
[39:34] that's the favor of God the Bible says a
[39:37] Prudent Wife is from the Lord and all
[39:39] the brothers said
[39:40] all right not bad the Bible says a
[39:43] Prudent Wife is from the Lord why this
[39:46] is something in God's original thought
[39:48] part of his original attributes part of
[39:50] something that was a very real to God
[39:53] and Central to God the marriage Union
[39:55] reflects the desire that God had in the
[39:58] beginning
[39:58] the woman was made to be a help meet
[40:01] co-equal but opposite complementary to
[40:04] be flesh bone and blood of Adam
[40:07] the woman is intended in the beginning
[40:09] and still as the Bible says the woman is
[40:12] the glory of the man she's intended to
[40:14] be an expression of the man's Glory
[40:17] she reflects the man's Integrity she
[40:20] reflects the man's honor
[40:22] when the Bible says the woman is the
[40:24] glory of the man she reflects upon a
[40:26] man's judgment
[40:27] the woman is the glory of the man this
[40:30] word Glory as it speaks of character she
[40:32] reflects upon a man's judgment
[40:35] the woman gives expression to the man's
[40:37] discernment to his wisdom to his opinion
[40:41] when a man marries a woman then then we
[40:44] are at least on a very superficial level
[40:46] saying oh well he must like such and
[40:48] such and he must like this and he must
[40:50] like that and there's certain things
[40:52] that we could try to extrapolate from
[40:53] that in the natural and now the Bible's
[40:55] bring it to a very real principle that
[40:57] when a man marries a woman it speaks
[41:00] about his opinion his discernment his
[41:01] judgment
[41:05] and when the Bible says because the
[41:06] woman is the glory of the man
[41:08] when the woman reveals a man's good
[41:11] opinion
[41:12] and his discernment it results in his
[41:14] praise and his honor the Bible says uh
[41:16] let your Works glorify your father you
[41:19] know let your light shine that when men
[41:21] would see your Works they glorify your
[41:22] father
[41:23] that when a woman operates correctly and
[41:26] humbly and obediently and when she's
[41:27] serving God and and she
[41:30] reflects upon a man's good opinion he
[41:34] gets the credit or the praise or he gets
[41:36] partial credit and gets praised likewise
[41:40] so a wife is to represent a man's
[41:42] strength
[41:43] and Excellence his dignity his majesty
[41:45] is Grace the words that are
[41:46] provided there in glory
[41:49] and in the sermon the chosen of a bride
[41:51] brother Branham is going to show us that
[41:54] a wife Mana is a manifestation of a
[41:56] man's thoughts
[41:57] it's a manifestation of his Ambitions
[41:59] and his motives what's kind of in his
[42:01] mind a reflection in his heart
[42:03] the chosen of a bride he says again the
[42:05] kind of woman that a man would choose
[42:07] will reflect his ambition and his
[42:08] character
[42:09] if a man chooses the wrong woman it
[42:12] reflects his character
[42:13] and what he ties himself to shows truly
[42:17] what's in him
[42:19] a woman reflects what's in the man when
[42:21] he chooses her for wife it shows what's
[42:24] down in him it's just kind of repeating
[42:26] that principle you see how Brad Graham's
[42:29] saying the woman that a man chooses to
[42:31] marry in the flesh says something about
[42:32] who he is in his Spirit or in his
[42:34] character
[42:35] and not just
[42:37] kind of his present state of mind but
[42:39] even his ambition
[42:41] now no matter what he says outside watch
[42:43] what he married I go to a man's office
[42:45] and he says he's a Christian I remember
[42:47] what we were ministering on Wednesday
[42:49] Pinups all around the walls the old
[42:50] Boogie Woogie music going on do we even
[42:52] know what that is
[42:53] I don't care what he says I don't
[42:55] believe his testimony because his spirit
[42:57] is feeding on them things of the world
[43:01] say if he would marry a chorus girl or
[43:03] what if he would marry a sex queen or
[43:05] just some pretty modern raquetta it
[43:08] reflects
[43:09] it shows what he has in his mind of what
[43:12] his future home is going to be because
[43:15] he took her to raise his children by
[43:18] the choosing of the Bride when God
[43:20] chooses his wife in this end time she
[43:24] reflects his future home
[43:26] she's a reflection of Revelation 21
[43:28] she's a reflection of that New Jerusalem
[43:30] that Heavenly City it reflects it shows
[43:32] what's in his mind of what his future
[43:33] home is going to be but he's took her to
[43:36] raise children by because he took her to
[43:37] raise his children by and whatever she
[43:39] is that's the way she'll raise those
[43:41] children so it reflects what's in the
[43:43] man a man that takes a woman like that
[43:46] shows just what he's thinking of the
[43:47] future could you imagine a Christian
[43:49] doing a thing like that no sir I could
[43:51] not a true Christian will not look for
[43:53] such beauty queens and chorus girls and
[43:55] sex Queens he'll look for Christian
[43:57] character
[43:59] I know this is instructive to our young
[44:01] men that when they're looking to get
[44:03] married or they find that there's some
[44:04] sort of physical attraction that you
[44:06] want to look past the physical
[44:07] attraction and and and it's wonderful
[44:10] that it's there
[44:11] and and I would say that apart from the
[44:14] physical attraction there's really not a
[44:16] lot to get traction with
[44:18] right you don't just you don't see
[44:20] somebody who seems like a nice Christian
[44:21] and try to wheel yourself into wanting
[44:23] to marry him through prayer but there's
[44:25] a there's usually a spark there some
[44:26] sort of Attraction some way that God
[44:28] brings it together through those things
[44:30] but what we look for beyond the physical
[44:32] part is character
[44:35] Godly character Christian characters
[44:37] brother of Adam says it and the
[44:40] principle now is that when Ahab married
[44:42] Jezebel it reflected his character
[44:45] brother Adam says when a man chooses a
[44:47] woman and marries her that woman is a
[44:50] reflection of the man's character now
[44:52] this is not given as a just a litmus
[44:54] test one and done and if she's not a
[44:56] good girl you're a bad man and it's just
[44:58] kind of over and we just need to learn
[44:59] to deal with it going forward that's not
[45:01] it at all but it's saying something
[45:03] about how important and critical that
[45:05] marriage is saying something about how
[45:08] that when a man marries a woman that who
[45:11] she becomes and what she manifested and
[45:13] how she raises the children and what
[45:15] that home looks like is going to reflect
[45:16] on him
[45:18] I mean it's a man cannot you know say
[45:21] well you know that's my wife you know
[45:23] yeah I know those are my kids and that's
[45:25] my house but you know what that's my
[45:27] wife's job that's that's up to my wife
[45:28] and my wife did that my wife did that
[45:30] and my wife this and my wife that just
[45:32] kind of throw the wife under a bus
[45:33] remember one time I was uh preaching for
[45:36] a pastor
[45:37] and we're gotten this got in the car and
[45:39] I opened up the console or something or
[45:41] there was something standing there in
[45:42] the console and I picked them I go what
[45:43] kind of CD is this he goes brother this
[45:45] is my wife's car
[45:46] and uh we're just kind of joking around
[45:48] like man the bishop must be so blameless
[45:50] he's willing to throw his wife under the
[45:51] bus
[45:52] but there's you know there's a certain
[45:53] thing to a certain point because like oh
[45:54] well that's my wife's hey
[45:57] like when the when the when the woman
[46:00] when the man said hey
[46:02] you know I didn't send my wife did it
[46:04] right just kind of passing along I was
[46:06] like ah nice try how convenient that
[46:08] that's the first excuse I've ever given
[46:11] but there's a connection now through
[46:13] Union through marriage
[46:16] I want to read this statement to kind of
[46:18] to go to the next step I'm going to be
[46:21] reading in Ephesians chapter 5. verses
[46:24] 21 to 28 I know that's kind of maybe a
[46:26] usual place to end up but we're looking
[46:28] at the identification of the Kingdom the
[46:30] kingdom is king and queen
[46:32] marital Union the character of the king
[46:33] being expressed through his bride the
[46:35] power of the throne being made manifest
[46:36] in the lives of Believers now we're
[46:39] looking at identity in our own lives and
[46:41] our marriages become something that's
[46:43] reflecting the word of God or the
[46:45] kingdom and brother Graham says and
[46:46] serves we would see Jesus he says all
[46:48] these things are attributes of God
[46:51] just so that in the end the Bible said
[46:53] Jesus said you will know that I am in
[46:54] the Father the father and me I and you
[46:56] and you and me and that's the today he
[46:57] says that day is this day it's God
[47:00] becoming tangible
[47:02] we've used some quotes out of
[47:04] identification where it says God
[47:06] becoming tangible in our lives he says
[47:08] your own wife you and your husband is
[47:10] just a shadow a negative of God and his
[47:13] wife the church
[47:16] now if I could take it in the language
[47:17] he's saying
[47:19] you and your spouse
[47:22] are God though it's just a shadow it's
[47:26] God being represented
[47:29] it's God being identified it's God
[47:31] becoming tangible
[47:33] that through a union between a man and a
[47:36] woman that there's a reflection of God
[47:38] in that that in its place in operating
[47:41] in harmony with the mutual dependency
[47:43] and mutual accountability that God has
[47:46] expressed in that Union that there's a
[47:48] picture being painted in that
[47:50] your own wife you and your husband are
[47:52] just a shadow and negative of God and
[47:54] his wife the church it's just God's
[47:56] attributes being displayed in Shadows
[47:58] and types like the Old Testament was to
[48:00] the new
[48:02] so as the Old Testament foreshadowed
[48:04] what the New Testament Christ in the New
[48:06] Testament you now in the Natural Life
[48:09] are manifesting foreshadow reflecting
[48:11] what God and his bride are going to be
[48:13] through all eternity
[48:14] wow what a beautiful thing that our
[48:17] unions our marriages our homes Our God
[48:20] becoming tangible the word becoming
[48:22] flesh
[48:24] and and if I can say this now and I know
[48:26] you won't fault me if I repeated it
[48:28] towards the end do you see now why
[48:30] that's one thing the devil's always
[48:32] attacking is the strength of our unions
[48:34] and our marriages and the stability in
[48:36] our homes and going after the peace in
[48:38] our homes and going after the
[48:39] arrangement our homes because it has
[48:42] such a powerful and for lack of better
[48:44] terminology upside and the devil knows
[48:46] if he can get it upside down the
[48:48] downside is the worst it can possibly be
[48:52] I mean does not the Bible teaches you'd
[48:54] be better dwelling in a shack
[48:57] than a marriage that's out of order
[48:59] Ephesians chapter 5 verses 21 to 28 now
[49:03] with that in mind a union is God
[49:05] becoming tangible
[49:07] I feel like I'm covering a lot of ground
[49:08] today
[49:10] as we go forward Ephesians chapter 5
[49:13] verse 21
[49:17] I believe the scripture verse 21 is so
[49:20] critical to understand the rest
[49:21] submitting yourselves one to another in
[49:23] the fear of the Lord
[49:25] so there's a submitting to each other
[49:28] wives submit yourselves under your own
[49:29] husbands I'll just read to verse 23 as
[49:31] unto the Lord for the husband is the
[49:33] head of the wife
[49:35] even as Christ is the head of the church
[49:38] and he is the savior of the body now the
[49:41] teaching is submitting to one another
[49:44] wives submitting to husbands and the
[49:46] teaching is the natural marriage
[49:49] relationship between a man and a wife
[49:50] and Paul's drawing from the spiritual
[49:52] relationship between Christ and the
[49:54] church to instruct and to teach the
[49:57] Union
[49:58] as Christ is the head of the church
[49:59] savior of the body so ought to
[50:01] the wife be subject to the head which is
[50:03] her husband
[50:04] therefore as the church is subject of
[50:06] the Christ so let the wives be to their
[50:08] own husbands in everything
[50:12] and all the brothers said everything
[50:16] so submitting yourselves one to another
[50:17] wives submit to your husbands as the
[50:19] church is subject unto Christ
[50:21] now submission and subjection reflect
[50:24] God's character
[50:26] this is
[50:28] this is a part of God as we talk about
[50:30] Kingdom identity and kingdom
[50:31] characteristics
[50:32] that this is way the way that God is
[50:36] God being above all God being in all God
[50:38] wanting to express himself chose to
[50:40] express himself through order we see it
[50:43] in the heavens we see it in Stars we see
[50:45] it even in the invisible Realm of the
[50:47] heavens where there's angels and there's
[50:49] seraphims and there's different roles
[50:50] and relationships and relationships to
[50:52] one another and fixed positions not just
[50:54] among stars and planets but even among
[50:56] the Angels there's roles and even to the
[51:00] point to where they could fall there
[51:01] from their place they could leave their
[51:03] place there's a great picture being
[51:04] painted in the character of God as we
[51:07] read the Bible so submission and
[51:09] subjection everybody feeling warm and
[51:11] fuzzy submission subjection these are
[51:15] part of God's character
[51:17] now I'm going to say this and emphasize
[51:19] this for some of the remaining moments
[51:20] we have together hopefully keep
[51:21] reminding of you this this does not
[51:24] create
[51:25] a carnal hierarchy
[51:28] this is not about saying one is
[51:32] um higher than the other and one is
[51:34] lower
[51:35] but it's about arrangement
[51:38] it's about order
[51:40] there's there is not a part if we even
[51:44] use the nomenclature that one is above
[51:46] and one is under one is on top one is
[51:48] beneath and we were to structure in such
[51:50] a way to where there was one low and one
[51:52] high we wouldn't we could not take away
[51:55] from that that that establishes order of
[51:58] importance order of necessity because
[52:01] you'd have to view them together though
[52:03] one may be uh under the other you have
[52:06] to look at them as what they're
[52:07] accomplishing
[52:09] and the sum is what is is greater the
[52:12] sum is more important
[52:14] and so I I do not want you to take away
[52:16] from this the idea of some sort of
[52:19] hierarchy has anybody ever called
[52:21] themselves the low man on the totem pole
[52:24] have you ever done that then you're the
[52:26] most important one
[52:27] because in a totem pole the bigger and
[52:29] the stronger always on the bottom I know
[52:32] the ones that hell you thought you were
[52:33] running me down you said you're just a
[52:34] low man on the totem pole and I just
[52:36] went
[52:37] right the low man on the tombow he's the
[52:39] one that held him he knows as it gets
[52:40] higher they get smaller and smaller and
[52:42] smaller right so in that those that
[52:44] false deities
[52:46] you had the big strong powerful one on
[52:48] the bottom so when you say you're the
[52:50] low man in the totem pole humble
[52:51] yourself right
[52:53] hum yourself a little bit but there's
[52:55] not it's not creating any kind of order
[52:57] in order to make one better or more
[52:59] necessary than the other Paul is even
[53:01] clarifying that in First Corinthians 11
[53:03] though the woman is the glory of the man
[53:05] and the woman of the man and from the
[53:07] man the man came by the woman
[53:10] so submitting now
[53:12] carries with it the idea of cooperating
[53:16] or agreement
[53:18] and how that there is this assuming
[53:21] responsibility to one so it says wives
[53:24] submit yourselves to your own husbands
[53:25] there's some Assumption of
[53:27] responsibility to the husband and a man
[53:30] cannot marry and is not ready to take a
[53:32] woman to be his wife unless he's willing
[53:34] to assume the responsibility of being
[53:37] her husband
[53:38] to submit
[53:40] and even the word subject there in this
[53:42] passage or the same Greek word it means
[53:44] to place in a certain order or to
[53:45] arrange
[53:47] I I know that in the image and the word
[53:49] picture is to be under to submit but
[53:51] it's more importantly a saint to be
[53:53] placed or arranged in a specific order
[53:55] to mutually appoint or agree upon
[53:59] we could submit uh and offer something
[54:02] we could submit and we agree upon it and
[54:05] if submission and subjection just only
[54:07] mean to be under in a hierarchy to
[54:10] someone then we could never submit to
[54:12] each other
[54:14] I I know I'm not trying to be kind of
[54:17] janky with my semantics here
[54:19] if the Bible says submitting yourselves
[54:22] one to another
[54:23] if it just means to be under someone so
[54:26] that someone has the upper hand they
[54:27] have the power they have the premise
[54:28] they have the privilege and so I submit
[54:30] to you and that creates a power
[54:33] hierarchy and then you submit to me
[54:37] how does that even work
[54:39] how how is that how would that actually
[54:42] uh what would that look like in real
[54:44] life so submission and subjection is
[54:47] more than just creating some sort of
[54:49] forced structure
[54:51] submission subjection and Rule
[54:55] had been perverted to mean something
[54:57] that's not christ-like
[54:59] it's been taken out of context to say
[55:01] well the man is the head therefore it's
[55:03] the the ends the the ends is to make the
[55:07] man the head are you following me that
[55:10] in this day and age with some of the
[55:12] Gnar movement and a lot of the the the
[55:17] charismatic movements that are taking
[55:18] taking shape and even as it attaches
[55:21] itself to Christian nationalism and
[55:23] political uh movements that this
[55:25] figurehead of a strong male and we want
[55:28] a woman that's submissive or women
[55:30] saying I want a man that's strong and I
[55:33] want a man that's going to be a man
[55:36] Trump 2026 and 28 and 30 and 32 right
[55:40] and like yeah right you want a real man
[55:43] and they've got this image of what a
[55:45] man's supposed to be and and how a man's
[55:48] supposed to express himself and how he's
[55:49] supposed to live and how he's supposed
[55:51] to act but there is a submission a
[55:53] subjection in the rule that is nothing
[55:55] more than a perverted tool for man to
[55:58] rule over a woman in an ungodly way
[56:01] and they'll do it in Christian settings
[56:03] and they'll do it in other settings as
[56:04] well but brother Brown does say a man as
[56:07] a husband is the head of the woman he
[56:08] rules her
[56:10] so if a man rules a woman if a woman is
[56:12] to submit to a man if a if a woman is to
[56:15] subject herself to her husband as as the
[56:18] church is subject to Christ then I wanna
[56:22] there's a lot of there's a lot said in
[56:24] those statements there's a lot more to
[56:25] the scripture than just the man is the
[56:27] top he's the best he's the ruler he's
[56:29] the smartest he's the strongest you just
[56:30] listen to him there's a lot more being
[56:32] expressed in the whole image
[56:35] look how it continues in verse 25.
[56:38] husbands love your wives so it's not
[56:39] that the whole thing ends it's not you
[56:42] know the whole Bible doesn't end in
[56:44] Ephesians 5 24 right to a lot of people
[56:47] maybe they just ripped out the rest and
[56:49] said well stop here I like that
[56:51] good place to end honey devotion's over
[56:54] right right here but no there's more to
[56:56] it husbands love your wives even as
[56:59] Christ also loved the church and gave
[57:02] himself for it I hope that you can
[57:04] recognize something here that he might
[57:06] sanctify and cleanse it with the wash in
[57:08] the Water by the word they might present
[57:10] to himself a glorious church not having
[57:12] spot a wrinkle or any such thing but
[57:13] that it should be whole and without
[57:15] blemish notice the implication is that's
[57:17] not the way he found her but that's
[57:19] where she finishes
[57:21] so I Aunt meant to love their wives as
[57:23] their own bodies he that loveth his wife
[57:25] loveth himself recognize the character
[57:28] of Christ This is laboring Love This is
[57:30] laboring Grace that though the the in
[57:34] our in the spiritual type in the very
[57:36] literal type when Christ found us we
[57:38] were flawed but through his love he's
[57:40] redeemed us and he's nurtured us and
[57:42] he's washed us and he's built us up this
[57:44] is Christ laboring to bring true
[57:47] character out of the Bride not because
[57:49] he saw it superficially when he married
[57:51] us not because he saw it
[57:53] charismatically or carnally in our flesh
[57:55] when he died for us but because of what
[57:57] was down on the inside and the potential
[58:00] the imprint and the soul the real
[58:02] character and nature that we had on the
[58:04] inside of us he had a way that he could
[58:06] bring it out and let me say this if Ahab
[58:08] had been a man of character though he
[58:11] married a jezebel Not only was her name
[58:13] could have her name been changed but her
[58:15] nature changed her character changed and
[58:18] she would have become a virtuous wife
[58:20] and queen he as an attribute and a
[58:23] crowning to Ahab the son of Omri
[58:26] and that's what Christ does for us
[58:30] is he loves the church and he gives
[58:32] himself he sanctifies he cleanses
[58:35] and that's how we ought to love our
[58:36] wives
[58:38] the Bible can or this chapter concluding
[58:40] so nevertheless let every one of you in
[58:42] particular so love his wife even as
[58:44] himself
[58:45] and the wife see that she reverence her
[58:47] husband
[58:49] you realize that if we do not love
[58:50] properly as husbands we make it
[58:53] exponentially more difficult for our
[58:54] wives to reverence us
[58:57] that harshness reduces that respectful
[58:59] submission
[59:00] brother Paul alfontaine put it to me
[59:02] this way one time that a man's sinful
[59:04] tendency and Leadership is to be harsh
[59:06] and a woman's sinful tendency is to
[59:08] resist headship
[59:10] and and the and the the two now work
[59:13] against each other
[59:14] if a man wants to be I'm the husband I'm
[59:16] the head you get under my thumb you need
[59:19] to submit you need to subject yourself
[59:20] the wife just doesn't melt
[59:23] oh my goodness you're irresistible no it
[59:26] there's going to be something in the
[59:28] woman like
[59:30] what are you talking about
[59:31] you want me to do what
[59:33] you know I'm going back to Mama's
[59:35] or whatever it might be there's a
[59:38] certain attitude in the sense of no I
[59:39] don't think you're gonna no you're not
[59:40] gonna talk to me that way
[59:42] and so that's and and the men could say
[59:45] well I mean I told her to get under my
[59:46] thumb
[59:47] you know I told her I was the man she
[59:49] pucked up she left
[59:52] and you want you want the you want the
[59:54] pastor to give you a chest bump like
[59:56] yeah what's up man you really showed her
[59:59] it's like oh wait a minute
[1:00:01] that's not how this works right that you
[1:00:04] don't that's you're never gonna get a
[1:00:06] Godly woman you're not going to get The
[1:00:08] Godly part of that woman out of her when
[1:00:11] you meet her with that kind of obstacy
[1:00:12] and that kind of harshness and so it
[1:00:14] tells us man you could read all the
[1:00:16] scriptures you want and tell the woman
[1:00:18] to find her place but the best way for
[1:00:20] her to find her place is for you to
[1:00:22] build it and for you to make it
[1:00:24] available and for you to find the right
[1:00:26] kind of way in leadership for her to
[1:00:28] feel comfortable enough to step into
[1:00:30] that place and so I'm saying the men
[1:00:32] ought to take responsibility for it but
[1:00:34] I say also women you've got to recognize
[1:00:37] even your own Tendencies and how it's a
[1:00:40] little bit of harshness might cause you
[1:00:41] to be a little bit resistant and we've
[1:00:43] got to recognize that and do our part so
[1:00:45] that there's Harmony in our Arrangements
[1:00:48] the husband is the head of the woman
[1:00:50] he's brother bam says scripture saying
[1:00:52] this
[1:00:53] so submitting ourselves one to another I
[1:00:55] gotta go quick I'm gonna go really
[1:00:56] really fast so you can play this on half
[1:00:58] speed when you archive it
[1:01:00] First Peter chapter 3 verses one to five
[1:01:03] likewise your wives be in subjection to
[1:01:06] your own husbands
[1:01:08] that if any obey not the word they also
[1:01:10] May without the word be won by the
[1:01:12] conversation of the wives
[1:01:14] why they behold your chaste conversation
[1:01:16] coupled with fear that's a mouthful
[1:01:20] Peter is saying that the
[1:01:22] wives holy conduct can influence an
[1:01:25] unbelieving husband to Salvation
[1:01:27] but why she conducts herself and notice
[1:01:29] the conversation of the wives That's not
[1:01:31] how much you like to talk hey it's the
[1:01:35] conversation the way she lives the
[1:01:37] chaste conversation her manner of living
[1:01:39] her conduct coupled with fear that she
[1:01:42] in
[1:01:44] serving her husband and he says be
[1:01:46] subject to your husbands and he doesn't
[1:01:48] qualify to you to say wives be subject
[1:01:51] to your husbands if he believes the
[1:01:53] message the way you do
[1:01:56] he even goes so far as to say wise be
[1:01:59] subject to your husbands even if they're
[1:02:01] not saved
[1:02:02] because the way you serve your husband
[1:02:04] may be the means of saving him
[1:02:07] when they see your holy conversation
[1:02:09] your holy conduct and it may be the very
[1:02:11] gospel that's preached because it says
[1:02:13] without the word maybe they're not
[1:02:14] hearing the word maybe they're not the
[1:02:16] words not being preached over the pulpit
[1:02:17] maybe they're not absorbing what's being
[1:02:19] said but a wise conversation coupled
[1:02:21] with fear can be the very drawing power
[1:02:25] brother James Hayes was he fellowshipped
[1:02:28] with us in the beginning was here quite
[1:02:30] a bit
[1:02:31] just a real help and blessing in this
[1:02:32] church getting started he would live
[1:02:34] next door he was just uh he was a you
[1:02:37] know this isn't part of the story but it
[1:02:39] was a pilot it was capped with American
[1:02:40] Airlines that's not don't hyper fixate
[1:02:42] on that don't get nervous brother John
[1:02:43] but he wasn't serving the lord and he
[1:02:46] lived next door to a family that
[1:02:48] believed the message and they got to
[1:02:50] talking and the brother brother John
[1:02:52] Phillips was a wonderful brother he uh
[1:02:55] started going through the church age
[1:02:56] book with him and he started just
[1:02:58] breaking things down and after a while
[1:03:00] brother James whole family he gave his
[1:03:02] heart to Lord got saved the families
[1:03:03] completely revolutionized and brother
[1:03:06] John just went ahead and fired off a
[1:03:07] star into the Galaxy with his name
[1:03:08] wrapped up in it because he knew for
[1:03:10] sure it was the breaking down of the
[1:03:12] church ages and the great teachings he
[1:03:14] had done in these Bible studies that one
[1:03:15] brother James to the Lord so brother
[1:03:17] John one day maybe just need a little
[1:03:19] bit of Courage was like
[1:03:20] James just go ahead tell me what was it
[1:03:22] that led you to the message what was it
[1:03:24] that really caught you and bro James
[1:03:26] said that was your wife the way she
[1:03:28] served you you're a knucklehead right
[1:03:30] you're a brute
[1:03:32] and the way she just tumbled herself to
[1:03:34] you and the way she served in the home
[1:03:36] and the way she cooked and cleaned and
[1:03:37] the way she lived says that's what got
[1:03:40] our attention as a family that's what
[1:03:42] got my attention this day and age that
[1:03:43] there was something real
[1:03:45] and I don't know what brother John's
[1:03:46] response was and you might have said
[1:03:48] right answer
[1:03:49] and just moved on but that's what did it
[1:03:52] is the wife
[1:03:53] why because she identifies
[1:03:58] subjection
[1:04:01] if I could say this as we're reading
[1:04:03] these scriptures this is God's character
[1:04:05] the arrangement of the man and the woman
[1:04:07] together
[1:04:08] it's the order it's the position it's
[1:04:10] not to create one as being better than
[1:04:13] the other and though we could say
[1:04:14] scripturally that one is weaker and
[1:04:16] though we could say that one has certain
[1:04:18] opportunities that the other may not and
[1:04:20] we could identify these differences
[1:04:22] they're not done to create a division
[1:04:24] but to find the points of Harmony
[1:04:27] and where they complement one another
[1:04:29] and so God's character is expressed in
[1:04:31] this order in this position
[1:04:33] this word subjection it's such a a
[1:04:35] deeper word than just to put somebody
[1:04:37] underneath somebody but it means to
[1:04:40] submit to one's admonition or advice
[1:04:42] is to recognize one's Authority in place
[1:04:46] so when a wife submits herself to her
[1:04:48] husband it's not just the semantics of
[1:04:51] being underneath him or even the
[1:04:53] logistics of just doing whatever he says
[1:04:55] but there's just some recognition of
[1:04:57] this is what the man is this is what the
[1:04:59] woman is
[1:05:00] this is what the man does this is what
[1:05:02] the wife does this is what the wife does
[1:05:03] that's what the man does the mutual
[1:05:05] recognition to be subject here as we
[1:05:07] read this in the Bible it's a voluntary
[1:05:09] attitude of giving in
[1:05:12] and so a Godly woman is not beaten to
[1:05:14] submission a Godly woman is not
[1:05:15] intimidated into submission a Godly
[1:05:18] woman is not someone who's forced into
[1:05:20] following but a Godly woman is one who
[1:05:22] willingly yields herself to leadership
[1:05:25] she may even recognize that she has
[1:05:27] certain opportunities and certain gifts
[1:05:29] or ideas whatever it might be but she's
[1:05:31] one that yields herself recognizing
[1:05:33] God's order and God's pattern
[1:05:35] brother Branham in the church age book
[1:05:37] the thytering age this would be a good
[1:05:39] one to listen to an audiobook he says
[1:05:41] now a woman is not meant to have an iron
[1:05:43] disposition
[1:05:45] because what is this what is the
[1:05:47] scripture talking about why submit
[1:05:48] yourselves to your own husbands it's an
[1:05:50] attitude of giving in
[1:05:52] this iron disposition this is an
[1:05:55] attitude this is a character this is
[1:05:57] that's as harsh a stiffness a woman is
[1:06:00] not meant to have an iron disposition
[1:06:02] she is according to the Holy scripture
[1:06:04] to be submissive to the male that is
[1:06:07] commanded of her
[1:06:09] woman who is truly female all female
[1:06:11] will be of that disposition
[1:06:14] and no wonder they identify anymore as
[1:06:16] something other than female
[1:06:18] women who is truly female all female
[1:06:20] will be of that disposition that we
[1:06:23] could say
[1:06:25] that's the word
[1:06:27] and that's language that oh my goodness
[1:06:29] just tweet that out on x
[1:06:31] or X that on X this afternoon and watch
[1:06:34] what kind of reacts as you get
[1:06:38] to be submissive to the mill that's
[1:06:40] commanded of her and you keep reading
[1:06:42] not a doormat
[1:06:44] notice how brother Brahman said it's not
[1:06:46] something where she's under his feet
[1:06:48] no real male makes a female a doormat
[1:06:52] she will want to be under Authority and
[1:06:54] not rule over the mill for he is the
[1:06:56] head of the house
[1:06:58] if she breaks that image that God made
[1:07:00] for her she is perverted this is where
[1:07:02] this image comes up this expression this
[1:07:06] role if a man makes a woman a doormat he
[1:07:08] breaks the image
[1:07:10] if a woman tries to rule the man she
[1:07:12] breaks the image any male that lets the
[1:07:16] woman take authority has also broken
[1:07:18] that image and he is perverted that is
[1:07:20] why women cannot wear that which
[1:07:22] pertaineth to a man or cut her hair
[1:07:23] there's even the image in the way that
[1:07:25] we dress the way that we carry ourselves
[1:07:27] and conduct ourselves in women not
[1:07:29] cutting their hair men cutting their
[1:07:31] hair that's an image that's being
[1:07:32] expressed she is never to wear garments
[1:07:35] that pertain to a male or cut her hair
[1:07:36] when she does she's intruding into the
[1:07:39] male domain taking Authority and
[1:07:41] perverting herself remember in Isaiah
[1:07:43] chapter 3 when it says that there's
[1:07:45] going to be a scab upon her head that
[1:07:47] the very language in the Hebrew says
[1:07:49] it's taken away and stripping her way
[1:07:50] the identity that made her different
[1:07:52] than a man
[1:07:54] the very thing that distinguishes among
[1:07:56] the sexes
[1:07:57] she's entreated on a male domain taking
[1:07:59] Authority and perverting herself and
[1:08:01] when a woman invades the pulpit which is
[1:08:03] it is commanded she must not do she
[1:08:05] shows what Spirit she is of being a
[1:08:08] dominating female is Antichrist
[1:08:12] this is very challenging language
[1:08:14] iron disposition dominating female
[1:08:18] now that's the character of laodicea
[1:08:21] that's the character of Jezebel
[1:08:24] these things are the spirit that's on
[1:08:26] the age
[1:08:27] and what I would what I would Express is
[1:08:30] that's if I could say this to the
[1:08:32] sisters that's the spirit you fight
[1:08:33] against every day
[1:08:35] is iron dispositions and dominating
[1:08:38] females lesbian spirits on the churches
[1:08:41] women wanting to lead it's that
[1:08:43] dominating spirit and you war against it
[1:08:46] and if it has any impact on you at all
[1:08:49] it can warp your mental perception of
[1:08:51] things warp you in your spirit but
[1:08:53] there's a Godly character down on the
[1:08:55] inside by the new birth that is
[1:08:58] resistant to that
[1:09:00] and if there's any any wobbling at all
[1:09:02] or any struggling at all it's a matter
[1:09:03] of recognizing the very things that a
[1:09:05] war and against you that are trying to
[1:09:07] force an image make you hard-hearted
[1:09:09] make you a little bit calloused this
[1:09:11] iron disposition is not of God a
[1:09:13] dominating female is not of God but the
[1:09:16] Bible continues let the wives be in
[1:09:18] subjection to their own husbands
[1:09:20] that you might win your unbelieving
[1:09:22] husband through your Chase conversation
[1:09:24] coupled with fear and it says this about
[1:09:26] the women in verse three who's adorning
[1:09:29] let it not be that outward adorning of
[1:09:32] plaiting the hair and of wearing of gold
[1:09:33] or putting on of apparel notice how that
[1:09:36] hearkens back to Isaiah 3 and the
[1:09:38] attitude of the women he says but let it
[1:09:39] be the hidden man of the heart in that
[1:09:42] which is not correctable even the
[1:09:44] ornament that's the adorning
[1:09:46] an appropriate harmonious Arrangement or
[1:09:48] Constitution remember how that word
[1:09:50] meant order or government there's some
[1:09:52] sort of arrangement some decoration the
[1:09:54] arrangement of the stars in the heaven
[1:09:56] is the ornament of Heaven this is God's
[1:09:59] order this is where God's glory is shown
[1:10:01] this is why a family can be so powerful
[1:10:03] when the man is not treating his wife
[1:10:05] like a doormat when the man is loving
[1:10:08] his Christ Like Loving his bride like
[1:10:09] Christ loves the church when the woman
[1:10:11] who's adorning her Arrangement is the
[1:10:14] hidden man of the heart
[1:10:16] the adorning the ornament the
[1:10:17] arrangement of a Meek and quiet Spirit
[1:10:19] that's the different kind of disposition
[1:10:20] than the iron disposition of the
[1:10:21] dominating female which is in the sight
[1:10:23] of God of great price
[1:10:26] don't let it be the outward world of
[1:10:29] the things in the flesh
[1:10:31] but let it be that arrangement in your
[1:10:34] heart
[1:10:35] God loves this arrangement
[1:10:37] put everything in its place and then
[1:10:39] operate in decency in an order you'll
[1:10:40] find that God is a god of order
[1:10:44] and right this is where
[1:10:47] I realize maybe some of my Thunder's
[1:10:49] been stolen on social media already but
[1:10:51] that's what happens when you lay it all
[1:10:52] out there
[1:10:52] but at First Peter chapter 3 verse 5 as
[1:10:54] we continue
[1:10:56] for after this manner
[1:10:59] in the old time the holy women also
[1:11:02] who trusted in God
[1:11:04] Adorn themselves being in subjection
[1:11:06] unto their own husbands
[1:11:09] now Peter's drawing back on the Old
[1:11:11] Testament the women of old
[1:11:14] that and and the old time holy women who
[1:11:17] trusted in God adorned themselves not in
[1:11:21] the platin of hair not in the wearing of
[1:11:22] gold not in the putting of apparel not
[1:11:25] trying to dress to impress the husband
[1:11:27] let's just all admit it women dress for
[1:11:29] women
[1:11:31] hey
[1:11:32] that that's guys don't even remember
[1:11:35] what they wore right
[1:11:38] but the women they dress and sisters do
[1:11:40] it too they dress for one another and
[1:11:44] Paul said Paul's saying that it's not
[1:11:45] the outward of Jordan's going to get a
[1:11:47] man's attention it's not the planet of
[1:11:49] the hair it's not all those different
[1:11:50] things but it's that hidden the
[1:11:52] character let your adorning let your
[1:11:54] Arrangement be a certain disposition a
[1:11:57] certain attitude to a certain character
[1:11:58] and he's saying this is how the women of
[1:12:00] old who trusted in God they Adorn
[1:12:03] themselves they arrange themselves in
[1:12:06] subjection to their own husbands
[1:12:09] brother Brahm says is your life worthy
[1:12:11] of the Gospel women ought to look to
[1:12:12] Jesus Christ you ought to look to Sarah
[1:12:15] and them of the Old Testament this is
[1:12:16] what Peter's saying look to them
[1:12:19] look to their expression as we are
[1:12:21] ministering on this in Kingdom Worthy
[1:12:23] brother Branham is talking about
[1:12:25] the the character
[1:12:28] and how that we ought to you can't just
[1:12:30] say well you know I do this that and the
[1:12:32] other in the church and think you own
[1:12:33] the church and go out on Monday and
[1:12:35] steal and lie he said you take on the
[1:12:38] spirit of the world and don't belong to
[1:12:40] the church of living God when your life
[1:12:41] doesn't match up with the word of God
[1:12:43] and this is continuing that statement
[1:12:45] women ought to look to Jesus Christ you
[1:12:47] ought to look to Sarah in them in the
[1:12:48] Old Testament I was preaching the other
[1:12:49] night somewhere about women to obey
[1:12:51] their husbands and that was the I think
[1:12:53] the Sunday night before in flashing red
[1:12:55] lights
[1:12:55] the 23rd in the evening he says obey
[1:12:58] yeah that went out of the marriage
[1:12:59] ritual a long time ago but they ain't
[1:13:02] going to do that no sir they live in
[1:13:04] America and they let you know they are
[1:13:07] not going to obey
[1:13:09] but as long as you don't do it don't
[1:13:11] never try to call yourself a Christian
[1:13:13] because you're not
[1:13:15] I don't care how much you dance and
[1:13:17] speak with tongues if you don't obey
[1:13:18] your husband you are out of the will of
[1:13:20] God
[1:13:21] I know that's heavy language
[1:13:23] and and should I narrate to the
[1:13:26] listening audience and husbands are
[1:13:28] getting writing cramps they're trying to
[1:13:29] write that down so fast
[1:13:31] just write down a couple keywords you'll
[1:13:32] be able to find it later
[1:13:34] I don't care how much you dance and
[1:13:36] speak with tongues if you don't obey
[1:13:37] your husband you're out of the will of
[1:13:38] God as long as you don't obey don't ever
[1:13:41] try to call yourself a Christian because
[1:13:43] you're not I know that's heavy
[1:13:46] I know that's playing but let's think
[1:13:48] about what the emphasis is number one
[1:13:50] and then get down just a little bit into
[1:13:53] what is being expressed what does it
[1:13:57] speak to it speaks to God's desire it
[1:14:00] speaks to the word of God it speaks to
[1:14:02] the image that God thinks that ought to
[1:14:04] be expressed and not just so that the
[1:14:06] the semantics that could be observed but
[1:14:09] because of the power that's represented
[1:14:11] in that Union
[1:14:12] and what it can can accomplish musicians
[1:14:15] if you could come
[1:14:16] to your instruments
[1:14:18] what outstanding statements
[1:14:24] it brings the emphasis back down as we
[1:14:26] said Wednesday night brother Brandon
[1:14:28] when he's preaching is your life worthy
[1:14:29] of the Gospel he's really punching at
[1:14:31] trying to turn your church experience
[1:14:32] and what you experience at church into
[1:14:35] your identity
[1:14:37] and you're saying you can't do that
[1:14:40] brother Branham
[1:14:42] show such reverence and the scripture
[1:14:44] shows such reverence to the marital
[1:14:46] Union that Peter says you should be of
[1:14:48] subjection to a husband who's even not a
[1:14:50] believer
[1:14:52] and I'm glad that the message gives us
[1:14:54] great clarity on some of these things
[1:14:56] through specific questions that are
[1:14:57] asked but brother Brown was asked a
[1:14:58] number of times maybe we'll go through
[1:14:59] this in the future where he's asked my
[1:15:01] husband doesn't believe like us he
[1:15:03] doesn't believe any it's even the
[1:15:05] questions asked in such a way to say
[1:15:06] essentially he doesn't think you're a
[1:15:09] prophet brother Branham he doesn't
[1:15:11] believe the message of the hour and he
[1:15:13] goes to a different Church what should I
[1:15:14] do and brother bear says go to church
[1:15:16] with your husband
[1:15:18] you know I said don't be afraid you have
[1:15:21] nothing to be afraid of dear if you know
[1:15:23] the truth and you've got faith you've
[1:15:25] got nothing to be afraid of he says go
[1:15:28] and what does he what is he what is he
[1:15:31] doing in that moment he's not watering
[1:15:33] down how important it is to go to church
[1:15:35] he's not watering down how important the
[1:15:38] word of God is in truth he's lifting it
[1:15:40] up
[1:15:41] there's something expressed in that
[1:15:43] image
[1:15:44] there's something expressed in that
[1:15:45] marital Union that a woman has a better
[1:15:48] voice of the truth by doing what the
[1:15:51] Bible
[1:15:52] ought to in arranging herself to her
[1:15:53] husband in love than she does by saying
[1:15:56] be an obstinate
[1:15:58] in giving lip service to truth
[1:16:01] I want to read you a story that brother
[1:16:03] Bantam tells in the sermon water from
[1:16:05] The Rock
[1:16:07] he's telling the story I provided all
[1:16:08] the slides here just so you could see
[1:16:11] this conversation go back and forth It's
[1:16:13] kind of lengthy but I say it just to
[1:16:15] emphasize
[1:16:17] that identity and maybe it's a maybe
[1:16:21] it's not a real clear uh clear-cut
[1:16:23] picture this morning and how we've
[1:16:24] presented it so I know God will give us
[1:16:27] Grace
[1:16:28] but he says a lady come not long ago
[1:16:30] saying that someone told her that she
[1:16:31] had Seven Devils
[1:16:33] another person told her she only had
[1:16:35] five
[1:16:36] he said poor woman Plum gone nearly
[1:16:39] set in the room taken off her stockings
[1:16:41] pulled her feet up in the chair said I
[1:16:43] haven't eaten for several days and I'm
[1:16:45] I'm not going to eat till I find out
[1:16:46] what become of those devils
[1:16:48] said what are they
[1:16:50] I said I don't know I've never known
[1:16:52] nothing about it
[1:16:53] she said well one Minister told me I had
[1:16:55] seven devils and the other lady said I
[1:16:57] had only had five now there's two of
[1:16:59] them gone somewhere
[1:17:01] and stayed there about two hours in the
[1:17:03] house until God began to speak and said
[1:17:05] lady listen you come from St Louis yes
[1:17:08] how'd you know it your husband's on the
[1:17:10] police force that's right you used to be
[1:17:12] a lovely housekeeper not just notice
[1:17:14] what he zeroes in on
[1:17:16] you used to be a lovely housekeeper
[1:17:17] that's right recently your house looks
[1:17:20] like a Hog Pen
[1:17:21] that's right
[1:17:23] your daughter's over there now taking
[1:17:24] care of your husband now notice how the
[1:17:26] Holy Spirit identifies something's
[1:17:27] something's wrong used to be a wonderful
[1:17:30] housekeeper and now your house is a mess
[1:17:33] and your daughter is taking care of your
[1:17:34] husband this isn't how it's supposed to
[1:17:36] work
[1:17:37] that's right who told you that I just
[1:17:39] kept talking because it was in a vision
[1:17:41] you went down to a little place first
[1:17:43] you went to a doctor yes he'd give you
[1:17:44] shots yes those shots were called was
[1:17:46] called hormones yes you went down to a
[1:17:48] place they told you had Devils yes
[1:17:49] because you had a real funny feeling yes
[1:17:52] they sent you to California yeah and so
[1:17:54] man told you at Seven Devils yes you
[1:17:56] went to a woman she said you had five
[1:17:58] Devils yes and they told you to come to
[1:18:00] me yes that's right how did you know
[1:18:02] that the holy spirit said so
[1:18:05] now catch this
[1:18:07] is as you think about this image
[1:18:11] you haven't got any Devils to begin with
[1:18:13] that's right
[1:18:15] I haven't no
[1:18:17] ladies sure you know your mother went
[1:18:18] through the menopause it's the menopause
[1:18:20] something natural this is just the
[1:18:21] imbalance of hormones and things
[1:18:23] he says what do you think a home run
[1:18:25] shots are for I don't know for the
[1:18:28] change of life that's what it is no
[1:18:30] Devils at all it's just your condition
[1:18:32] of life
[1:18:34] she began to relax
[1:18:36] now I don't think this image is
[1:18:37] irrelevant my wife was cooking some
[1:18:39] bacons and bacon and eggs out there I
[1:18:41] suspect that the lady hadn't done it for
[1:18:43] several days
[1:18:44] good chance maybe she wasn't doing it at
[1:18:46] all cooking she began to look through
[1:18:48] the house and I said kind of hungry she
[1:18:49] refused to eat it first said yes
[1:18:52] she went out and ate three eggs a big
[1:18:54] bunch of toast two cups of coffee a lot
[1:18:55] of jelly
[1:18:57] [Music]
[1:18:59] for the more refined Jam I believe it is
[1:19:01] right
[1:19:02] she's just as happy as she could be she
[1:19:04] said brother Brown you're going to pray
[1:19:05] for me and cast it away
[1:19:07] I said cast what away
[1:19:09] the thing
[1:19:12] there's nothing to Cast Away
[1:19:17] well I never felt so good in my life and
[1:19:19] hold it here brother John said what must
[1:19:21] I do
[1:19:22] now this life This Woman's life's been
[1:19:24] pretty chaotic
[1:19:25] she's got funny feelings her hormones
[1:19:28] are she's through this time of life
[1:19:29] where there's bodies changing and this
[1:19:31] menopausal condition is causing certain
[1:19:33] manifestations of attitudes and there's
[1:19:35] a certain Rhythm to that and even
[1:19:36] throughout life and here she comes to
[1:19:39] this time of life where it's very
[1:19:41] pronounced and what she's going through
[1:19:42] it's very real to her she goes to the
[1:19:44] doctor and the doctor gives her shots
[1:19:46] and it's to deal with the imbalance the
[1:19:47] chemical imbalances in her body but yet
[1:19:49] she's all worked up and stirred up so
[1:19:51] she goes to a meeting and someone says
[1:19:53] well you've got Seven Devils she goes to
[1:19:55] a meeting in California and a woman says
[1:19:57] you've got five and instead of her just
[1:19:59] thinking oh we're doing better now she's
[1:20:00] worried where the other two went and and
[1:20:02] she's been told all these things and
[1:20:04] then finally says that you need to go to
[1:20:05] a real specialist go to brother Brandon
[1:20:07] he'll help you out and her life's
[1:20:09] chaotic she used to keep home now she
[1:20:11] doesn't anymore she used to take care of
[1:20:13] her husband now she doesn't anymore and
[1:20:15] maybe she had this excuse well I'm so
[1:20:17] out of sorts and I'm so torped
[1:20:19] emotionally and everything's out of
[1:20:20] whack and so now she wants to be
[1:20:22] delivered of these devils and brothers
[1:20:23] there's no Devil's delivery from
[1:20:25] I can't lay my hands on you and cast
[1:20:27] anything away there's nothing there to
[1:20:29] Cast Away and so now she's saying what
[1:20:31] must I do and what is it we can do
[1:20:35] and listen to what he says go home
[1:20:37] straighten up your house cook your
[1:20:40] husband a nice big apple pie about that
[1:20:42] thick I don't know
[1:20:44] I don't know how thick that is it says
[1:20:46] when he comes in tonight throw both arms
[1:20:47] around him and kiss him sit down and get
[1:20:50] on his lap and tell him you love him and
[1:20:52] live like the lady ought to and if
[1:20:54] husbands if you're on Carnivore and this
[1:20:55] happens eat the pie
[1:20:58] go home straighten up your house cook
[1:21:00] your husband a nice big apple pie about
[1:21:02] that thick when he comes home to end
[1:21:03] tonight throw both arms around him and
[1:21:05] kiss him sit down get on his lap tell
[1:21:07] him you love him and Live Like a Lady
[1:21:09] ought to he said that's exactly that's
[1:21:11] all there is
[1:21:13] what is brother Brandon bring it back to
[1:21:15] brings it back to living the life
[1:21:18] and the solution to the upheaval and the
[1:21:20] solution to everything that was going on
[1:21:22] is to come back to the channel where the
[1:21:25] life is being lived come back to doing
[1:21:27] the things you know you ought to do
[1:21:28] that's what we are affording the
[1:21:30] opportunity when we have children is to
[1:21:32] is to raise them in the fear of God to
[1:21:35] look out after their spirits to sanctify
[1:21:37] the home for their sake and there's a
[1:21:39] lot we can pour ourselves into for our
[1:21:41] children say there's a lot we can do for
[1:21:43] our spouses sake there's a lot that we
[1:21:45] can do in giving in serving and being
[1:21:48] what God wants us to be for the others
[1:21:50] that'll straighten up a lot of things
[1:21:52] that are out of place in our lives
[1:21:53] whether it be hormonal problems whether
[1:21:56] it be emotional problems or depression
[1:21:58] or unable to overcome in some area of
[1:22:00] your life get back to doing what you
[1:22:02] know you ought to do as a spouse
[1:22:05] wow
[1:22:07] go home and clean your house
[1:22:10] bake a pie
[1:22:11] [Music]
[1:22:13] he says all the pouring on of oil and
[1:22:15] The Stomping and kicking and all the
[1:22:17] loud hollering wouldn't do a bit of good
[1:22:20] it's the truth that makes you free
[1:22:23] that's true you shall know the truth and
[1:22:25] the truth shall set you free
[1:22:31] what was the truth Live Like a Lady
[1:22:34] ought to
[1:22:35] there there's a lot emphasis in that
[1:22:37] that the truth was that she didn't have
[1:22:39] a devil
[1:22:40] still yet the solution brother Brandon
[1:22:42] said oh you don't have a devil well what
[1:22:43] must I do
[1:22:45] man you don't have a devil
[1:22:47] you ain't got seven or five you got none
[1:22:50] and brothers he didn't leave it at that
[1:22:53] he instructs her
[1:22:55] and the brother about him is here
[1:22:56] there's no doubt there may be things in
[1:22:57] our lives that he could just drill down
[1:22:59] into
[1:23:00] and expose and identify things that are
[1:23:03] out of place but don't you think it
[1:23:04] speaks to you already
[1:23:06] or it's not necessarily for there to be
[1:23:07] this kind of Razor Precision about how
[1:23:10] many days we haven't eaten and where
[1:23:11] we've gone to get our diagnoses but that
[1:23:13] we can look at ourselves and say I know
[1:23:14] I'm not doing what I ought to do
[1:23:17] as a man or as a woman and then there's
[1:23:19] the solution
[1:23:21] to my problems
[1:23:25] is living the life
[1:23:29] could you stand with me this afternoon
