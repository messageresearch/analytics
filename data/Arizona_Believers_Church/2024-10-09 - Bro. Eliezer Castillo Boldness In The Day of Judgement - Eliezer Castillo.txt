TRANSCRIPT
========================================
what a beautiful scripture um this this scripture it's it's talking about fear which I think we can all understand in one aspect or another about fear um but it's talking about a specific fear this is not just talking about spiders or a general anxiety it's not talking about phobias you know you can have a fear of balloons people have fear of clowns and it's just irrational phobia sometimes it's not social fears you know coming up here and speaking you know people might be afraid um I know it's it's a nerve-wrecking thing um performance anxiety uh fear of the unknown acute and chronic fears development fears post-traumatic fears there's many fears that are in our lives and and um but this is a specific fear even though with all of those fears there's so many fears in our lives that can pop up whether it's it's like it says acute an acute fear or a chronic fear something that was uh you grew up having this kind of fear God deals with every fear God will go and you can go into the scripture and you'll see how he will deal with every single fear in our lives whether it's anxiety whether it's it's feeling like you're not worthy enough feeling certain fears God will deal with it right there's um I I heard somebody say that the most common phrase in the whole entire Bible is do not fear that you know what that helps me out a lot because it could be a common fear I mean a common phrase could be anything but for God to tell his people do not fear and it was for many aspects of people's lives whenever they saw Jesus on the water they feared when they saw uh the big storm happening and Jesus sleeping they feared for their lives so there was there was fear of uncertainty there was fear of death there was fear of turmoil there was fear of so many things and God coming through the Old Testament all the way to the new saying do not fear what an insurance for each and every one of us but um here it's talking about a specific fear and and brother brandham says that that there's two elements in in the world it's either faith fear that that these two elements will control Nations they control denominations they'll control people these two elements brother brandham called them elements the these are are real things that will come and they will take over our life whether it's fear or faith but here is it specifies a certain fear and this is the fear of judgment let's read um first John again it says here is our love made perfect that we have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world there is no fear in love but perfect love cast out fear because fear hath torment he that fearth is not made perfect in love we love him because he first loved us now first he's showing future tense that he he goes back and forth from from the future to the present to the past to the Future to the present and here he says our love has been made perfect when we have boldness in that day no not today in that day that our our love has been matured brother Aaron he's been talking about how perfect means a maturity or a completion so now he's talking about this certain love that we have towards God that our love has been made matured or complete whenever we go onto that day and we have boldness in that day and we can see him and there is no fear now this is this is an amazing Revelation that Paul or that uh John gives us the fact that that this day the day of judgment is the most terrifying day we can have fears for everything we can be have fear of death but the fear of judgment in Revelations 2011 it says I saw a white saw a great white throne and in and him that sat on it whose face the Earth and Heaven fled away and there was no place found for them so even at the face of this person whenever the Earth and and Heaven saw this man they fled away it it's a terrifying day because because just like I said there's people that have fear of Torment there's people that have gone through many things but Jesus says do not fear the ones that can can kill the body but that can destroy the soul and send it to hell and that word hell is I I think gaha or it's the Lake of Fire so that there's this fear of this person this ultimate person that can not only just take us to another dimension but it's going to completely annihilate us this is the most terrifying day yet John is saying that there is a Perfection of love that there there is an amount of love that God gives us because he first loved us that's why we can do this and there's there's an a confidence that we can have that we can stand in the day of judgment in the most terrifying day and and be bold in that day that's amazing that's amazing that he gave us that confidence now here in in in 1 John 4:18 he's dealing with this kind of fear now presently now see he said that we're going to have boldness in that day but now in 18 he's talking about this fear that there is no fear in love but fear cast out fear because fear hath torment he that fearth is not made perfect in love now he's talking about today that that this thing called Fear Can a Believer today even though the Judgment Day is in that day in the Lord's day one of these days we're going to stand there our love is going to be made perfect but today sometimes this crippling fear goes on a believer that hey I'm not good enough this this fear of condemnation this fear of I'm not saved and the way John writes it it it almost shows that that this is final that if you don't have love then you're you or if you have fear then you don't have love but he's showing that there there's a progression and maybe it causes people to interpret that if you have fear you don't have love maybe it means that you're not saved but I I encourage everybody to listen to a a beautiful message from a brother Aaron that is perfecting love and he explains this that he explains that this is not a final thing that you either have love or you don't but that there's a perfe perfecting in you see God's love it doesn't grow and grow and grow God's love is already perfect but what we're doing is we're perfecting ourselves why by how by the knowledge of God more you know him the more you love him and as you progress more into him the more confidence you have for him and that fear begins to diminish and diminish and diminish until it says until that day where your love is made perfect you'll have confidence in that day and this part of the scripture might seem like the most dividing part whether you have love or not but it says that he that fearth is not made perfect in love and actually for me that's where the hope lies amen because now we're understanding that every Sunday and every Wednesday that Perfection is a condition of maturity so Perfection is not a modification right Perfection is not something that is just you blink on or or you have it or you don't and then if you don't have it then there's you don't have love you don't have this no a perfecting love amen so it says that that if if he that fearth is not made perfect it means that we're perfecting it means that we're growing that if there is fear in you that means that we're not to that point where we can stand in the day of judgment and we can look at him face to face and not have any fear so that he that he fearth that means we just we have room to grow that that means we There's Hope still that means there's still potential you know I I love potential potential means there's still power in the engine there's still more in the chamber there's still more of God to give to me yeah I I love potential God is potential God is not a a finite thing where there's a period there even when God created all the heavens and the earth when God he said let there be this let there be that he didn't say okay I'm done no he had more to give and when he gives he still has more to give and when he gives it all he still has more to give why because he is potential amen that's why he's the I'm omnipotent one all powerful why he has all potential in him he has everything so whenever we say ah I'm not where I'm supposed to be that means there's more God to give that there is more love to give to us there's more love that can be perfected within me when I say oh I'm not who I used to be and I or or what's that saying is uh I'm not what I ought to be I'm not what I want to be but I'm sure glad I'm not who I used to be and and you know what for me the I'm not what I ought to be and I'm not what I'm supposed to be that's my hope that that I'm still going that there's still room to grow I don't ever want to get to a point where I say I'm finished I'm done I'm good cuz even Paul even Paul had this struggle in his flesh this he called it an indwelling sin with him that he had to fight every single day to the day he died so so this Perfection we're growing into it yeah the Perfection of love the getting to know who this person is named Jesus Christ now now where does this fear stem from this this odd fear because it plagues everybody but where the devil wants to hit it is the believer see a person can fear God and then they'll just get away you know the Bible says that that the word was the light Jesus was the light and it says men rather love Darkness than light why because their deeds are evil the light was the unveiling or the uncovering of your sin it's the word shedding light in our hearts showing oh man I'm not where I'm supposed to be and then so people rather love Darkness than the light because they don't want to know so what do they do they flee away from it but us we want to know Lord what can I do how can I get closer to you so he sheds light in our lives and if we're not careful the devil's right there ready to give us a condemning thought ready us ready to give us a fear that will a Believer where did come from if you'd like to turn with me to Genesis 3 uh: 6 to1 I'll just read from 8 to 10 and this is this is where the sin happened this is where the woman she saw the fruit she ate it she gave it to her husband we know what the Act was and then their eyes were open their eyes eyes were open and and they tried to cover it up they tried to hide themselves they tried to make fig leaves and now now they have been impacted by a wrongdoing or a sin in their lives and in verse 8 it says and then they heard the voice of the Lord Walking In The Garden in the cool of the day now now remember this is the same God God never changes his love never changes his disposition for his children never changes but something changed here it says that uh that uh walking in the cool of the day Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the Trees of the garden and the Lord God called unto Adam and said unto him where art thou and he said I heard thy voice and I was afraid because I was naked and I hid myself what happened Adam's sin he or Adam's response to God reveals the impact of sin in a person's life that fear came where does Fear stem from from from a sin in our lives right so when sin hit his life there was was a sense of inadequacy a sense of unworthiness a sense of of dread of judgment from God to where he feared fear came to his life and he like brother bam says human nature kicked in and he ran away and all of the earth that's what they do they run away from the presence of God why because there is a sense of fear that's why people try to disprove the Bible people try to uh hate the Bible so much why because when it's spoken out it starts uncovering their sin and they don't like it so they they have to find a way to disprove it they have to find a way to say no everything is all good and they'll find their own God and make him the way they want him why there there's a fear and and you know what this fear is Justified because um his sin just alienated him from God right and it transformed him when he hears the voice of God he expresses fear and desire to hide saying I was afraid cuz I was naked and I hid myself this re reaction ill illustrates a fundamental shift in his original state his original state of innocence and his communion with God now this is a contrast between Adam's initial State and his post-fall condition it scores the transformal effects of sin in our human nature what does it do it creates barriers in our lives when there there never was any it leads us to a state a deep stated desire to escape from the very Source of Life the thing is God never changed right the thing is God is not this scary being he is still Aba father he's still god brother brandham he says in in Jehovah Gyra he says the very nature of him in the Garden of Eden as soon as he sinned it should have been Adam well now now focus on it should have been Adam right running up and down through the garden crying father father Where Art Thou but it was God going through the garden crying Adam Adam Where Art Thou and was hiding and that is his nature today man's nature is not to come out and confess his sins it's to hide behind something and they're still doing it it should have been Adam when when we sin it should be us saying father father but because sin there's a fear that comes and because of fear there's a lack of confidence and what happens our love begins to degrade God's love is always perfect but but what happened in the Garden of Eden it was a transformative power to where his love his confidence his Joy his peace all of that begin to degrade till he became a separated alienated being from God and that's what Jesus came to do to restore all of that to restore to con make us perfect but he remained the same God's love is perfect and that that's why that's why God did what he had to do the greatest one of the greatest and one of the well-known scriptures is for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life amen God loved us God looked for us we were the ones hiding that's right we were when we out of our mother's womb we are ready to run from God we don't have anything to do with God it's God the one calling God is the one seeking God is the one crying out for his people and and and the Beautiful Thing is the greatest act that God ever demonstrated was Jesus dying on that cross coming down to this earth to save the world and by that act conviction comes into our hearts that that's the amazing thing because sometimes in our mind fear has to be the driving point to come to Christ a lot of times fear is the one that makes us want to do right fear is the one that we have to be perfect so we begin to modify we begin to act we begin to be right when fear is the one that pushes us away in the first place yes good so so we have to understand that the reason why we have a desire for God is because he first loved me he first came down and he died for us and now he's knocking at the heart of the people and because of that love conviction comes in and then his word comes in opens up the heart and says hey man I'm not where I'm supposed to to be but there there's no condemnation there the next verse he said he didn't come to condemn the world he didn't come to cause condemnation that was the greatest act and it brings conviction to the heart it's not rules it's not preaching fear Into the Heart of the people people should not be brought by fear of condemnation a lot of times that that's how we're brought in not nobody even has to tell us sometimes we just do it ourselves we're the best preachers to ourselves we begin to think uh condemning thoughts on how unworthy we are and we try to become a Christian when it'll never work we try to become perfect where it'll never work it has to be by the grace of God in Romans 2:4 it says or despises thou The Riches of the goodness and forbearance and longsuffering not knowing that the goodness of God leadth thee to repentance so your the start of your Christian walk is God's goodness the reason why we repent from our sins is because of the goodness of God brother Bram he says in from that time he says that's why many people join churches because they fear hell and they come and put their names on the book and they go out and they think that settles it but it doesn't it's not long lasting all those things are temporal but there is a time when a certain thing can happen and from then on it's different really different that's when man meets God things change when man meets God so that's there there's the difference there that that we can never come to God or we can never be perfected we can never be matured through fear it'll never happen through a fear of condemnation through a fear of imperfection we we have to understand that this perfecting Love Is it is a confidence toward God and not looking within me and not looking overanalyzing and becoming OCD of my Christian walk but it's looking towards him it's getting a relationship and what is this every time you read your Bible every time you hear the word every time the word opens to you there's a deeper a deeper and a deeper love towards him the more you're in his presence the more you know him now now there there's a difference between the impact of sin and inherited sin see I was thinking about Adam how he he sinned and that was an impact of sin but he was still the Son of God he was still a direction of God he was spoken out of the words of God but what got him and what crippled him was the impact of sin but from him to people After the flood a complete different kind of people because now these people people are not only just direct sons of God but they're made like brother Brandon would always say uh what is it born in sin shaped in iniquity come to this world speaking lies they inherited sin through the seed through a corrupted seed so now it's it's completely different it's a completely uh different thing and and you can see the difference and a lot of times you could see Adam and that's sometimes how a born again believer acts because now when somebody is Born Again they're a direct son and daughter of God they're not just from the corruptible seed but they're they're from an Incorruptible seed now but if we don't be careful our First Act is to hide run fear get scared and and also there there's a a difference between struggling with sin and and being a slave or giving into sin here if you'd like to turn with me to Romans 78 and we'll read to 23 and the whole chapter is just a chapter of just golden nuggets and I'm sure we've all heard it brother brenham's preached about it he says for I know that in me that is in my flesh dwell no good thing so that's one first thing that we got to know that in me that is my flesh dwelleth no good thing for to will is present within me for how to perform that which is good I find not for the good that I would that um that I would I do not but the evil that I would not that I do for if I do that I would not it is more it is no no more I that do it but the sin that dwelleth in me so you got to remember you're not talking this is not a a novice re writing this to us now this is not somebody that just gave their heart to the Lord you're talking about the prophet of the age the Apostle and he says it is not me that I do that that does this but it's sin that dwells in me that's why we love that story about the Indian they said well how does it feel after you receive the Holy Ghost two dogs right that dwell in me so we always have to understand sin dwells in me he said but the sin that dwelleth in me I find then a law that when I would do good evil is present with me for I Delight in the law of God after the inward man but I see another law in my members Waring against the law of my mind and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members now first of all like I said Paul is speaking autobiographically he's talking about himself demonstrating that there is a struggle of sin within even the greatest Christians that every Christian now this is breaking news every Christian struggles with sin we can't say oh I'm perfect every Christian struggles with sin now like I said there is a difference between struggling and giving in he said that which I do not like in other in other versions that which I hate I do and that which I desire I don't do so so there's a difference between giving in because a lot of Sinners and unbelievers and professed Christians can come and say oh I'm going through the same thing yeah sin dwells in me pretty bad but they love it oh they love that sin they love doing those things but a Christian one of those green trees as brother Aaron was talking about somebody that has been bought into the body of of Christ right somebody that is a child of God that is growing up to the maturity they hate sin and they're not just giving into sin they we understand that sin dwells in us but there's a fight there's a struggle there's a war going on in US am there's a struggling that's why Paul he's you can see how torny he is oh Wretched Man that I am who's going to deliver me right he he's telling us this whole situation saying there there's a struggle of sin and this is showing that there that Christians Believers Sons and Daughters of God are in a progression to maturity to adoption there's a progression so there's always going to be a fight progression doesn't it means that there's still sin there and it doesn't mean oh well well there's sin well what can we do no we we see the sin in our lives and and we're fighting for dear life there there's a Waring against the the spiritual man and the carnal man it's not a green light to say okay it's fine but there's there's it's a wrestling with sin and and it's revealing that Christians they hate sin and desire righteousness shows a progression to Perfection that it's it's not anything else but a growing and and a putting away of our lives and and sometimes now we're going back to condemnation the result of the fact that the Christians struggle with sin when I say struggle we're fighting right sometimes that's what causes the feeling of condemnation feeling inadequacy feeling like Adam see Adam that was justified for him to fear but now we inherit sin now it's in our flesh brother B says we we have a culber nature we can it means it's I don't know if you've ever seen a cber it's sticky you you get CL close enough to the world it's going to jump on you so so now now we're fighting with this flesh now we're fighting with these things and a lot of times the the understanding that we are struggling with sin causes condemnation saying oh God I'm not worthy oh God I'm still being tempted Temptation Jesus was tempted but sometimes we feel like the Temptation that's where condemnation comes and and we always we have to understand the difference between conviction and condemnation yes amen we have to understand that every time God will convict your heart is to bring you closer and if if we ever get a condemning thought we have to understand that's not coming from God if we ever hear the word we ever hear the gospel and we feel condemned we're hearing the wrong gospel right if we ever feel condemned from hearing the word something's wrong because the Bible says Jesus didn't come to condemn but he came so that we might be saved condemnation judgment is for that day there is a judgment going on but if there's there's a conviction if there's a light over our sin God's always going to find a give you a way back he's always going to give you a way to overcome he's conviction is a reproof or a shedding light of sin saying hey we're wrong but this is the way to go this is the way to go conviction is not always just hurting but it is being led by the spirit of the Lord we're not careful we we what happens is we we start basing our religion in a condemn based religion punishment judgment based religion and what happens is that's where Works come in I I believe that's where uh how the Pharisees they perfected the law why because it's like we're going to we're going to create another law and we're going to do this and what happens is we try to perfect ourselves and and and for for a while we're feeling condemned but we get good enough at it we become a Pharisee we say if if they can't live up to what I live they're not they're not saved that's what happened to the Pharisees they said if they can't live up to our Traditions if that person can't live up then they're not saved what were they they were creating laws to perfect themselves they were self-modifying their perfection and a lot of times if if if we go in this D demned based relationship or religion that's what will end up happening if we get good at it we get good at trying to fix ourself trying to be better trying to be better but this this is Grace this is a a process of knowing the Eternal one a process of knowing him and then you become him condemnation is the definition is to be judged to be found guilty and has already been sentenced there's no way out Paul begins to explain the impossibility of self-modification in Romans 7:14 he says for we know that the law is spiritual but I am carnal sold under sin that tells you everything brother brandham says that Jesus didn't come to destroy the law but he came to magnify the law that's right it doesn't mean that he added more all what is a magnif magnifying glass it just brings it closer he said you thought if you go and you stab somebody you've murdered somebody but he's like no if you hate them it goes so deep it goes into our very thoughts so so the the law is so spiritual and my body is so carnal I am sold under sin I cannot live this life I cannot modify myself to be perfect I need somebody he says in 7 721 so he's talking about this law the law of God then he says in seh Romans 7:21-23 he says then I find a law he's talking about another law laws are what principles guidelines rules that's why we can think about the law of gravity you cannot go against the law of gravity there's laws there's principles within that and it's the same thing with the laws of God the they principles or things that you can't go but now he's saying there's different kinds of laws here now he says then I find a law that when I do good evil is present with me yeah for I Delight in the law of God after the inward man but I see another law in my members Waring against the law of my mind bringing me into the Captivity to the law of sin which are in my which is in my members now that he's showing why there's a struggle with sin because there's a law within us we can never live up because we can't go past those guidelines of our flesh there's a law within our flesh don't that does not allow us to live up to the law of God it doesn't allow it there there's a struggle that's warn against the inward man and those two laws are always going to fight against one another and the reason why I'm saying this is so that we can understand that sin dwelleth in us that there is a struggle but we can look forward and we can have confidence in God we can have confidence in his love showing that yes we are always going to see the mirror and we're going to see imperfection but when God sees us there's a Perfection there amen he says but remember this even as we are if You' like to turn in John 4:17 this is what what I I truly love here he says herein is our love made perfect that we have boldness in the day of judgment that's future tense then he goes into present he says because as he is so are we in this world so we look in the mirror we see imperfection we look within ourselves we're going to see faults we're going to see indwelling sin but here John is saying so as he is we are in the world so whatever condition Jesus Christ is in today even though we're imperfect even though we're probably a little anger fit's going to hit or or maybe we'll do a white lie without even knowing maybe we'll we'll something will happen where we'll Fall Again One Way or Another as he is there so are we that we are reflecting the very character of him right now even though we we are imperfect even though we are in a progression we're still when they see us they see him there's still something that looks like him doesn't merely encourage us to inspire to be like him but he asserts that we already are by virtue of our faith while we might not be perfect copies every Christian inherently Bears some kind of resemblance to Christ we're going to Bear Christ one way or another I started to think about that and um I don't know if anybody's ever heard the private interview of of sister Bruce um where he's talking to the sister and in her she feels condemned and brother Brenham is explaining to her who she is here brother brandham he says I believe with all of my heart that you are a real Born Again believer sister Bruce imagine hearing the prophet say that you're a real born born again believer sometimes we need that confidence we need that reassurance how could how could that Spirit just leave when you get sick when you get weary and when you're nervous type of person sister Bruce says yes see and you get those things on your mind see little bitty things and it just keeps building up both ways and you get somebody on your heart and you want to pray for them and get and uh get up and pray for it you can't rest until that person's prayed for that's you then take on the other side Sayan might present something um that you and out this way see then God your nature God works Satan works then Satan tries to make you believe that you are not see you keep building this and maybe this and this see you don't look at yourself sister Bruce remember so he's telling her like this is how how it works and sometimes Satan's going to come around and go into that character and go into that little gift of yours he's talking about a gift that she has that she just not settled until she gets to pray for somebody but then he says on the other hand Satan will come and say o you're not that person you're saying to be you're not saved good and and he goes on and he says I'm going to pray for you now and and he's telling her all of these things and she goes back and tells him sister Bruce says I make so many mistakes imagine somebody assuring you and still say saying wait hold on but I'm still imperfect somehow I make so many mistakes and I fail so many times brother brandham goes back and he says that's why Christ had to die so that you with your mistakes wouldn't be lotted to you seeu he took your mistakes your desire in your heart is to serve him brothers sisters that's the key he says oh there's indwell ing sin in me but I desire the law I desire to do right even though my members which is my body sometimes doesn't want to but yet my desire that's what makes you different from the rest of the world is your desire and and if you continue on the devil's going to try to make you fall but remember Lord you know my desire Lord you know my heart he says that your desire in your heart is to serve him sister Bruce says yes all right that's what he died for so you could serve him see not your mistakes are not looked not lotted to you see he's your propitiation see he's your sin offering your sins are not known you're not a sinner praise God you're not a sinner praise God I'm just growing sometimes we fall but we're growing and just like I I've been rejoicing with those those messages because the youngans have to grow up we're going to fall but we grow into a maturity into a confidence into a perfecting Faith perfecting love all of these complexes breaking away until one of these days we're stepping into the day of judgment with boldness right oh God oh that's that's what I want that's what we're walking towards he says you're not a sinner before God Christ took your sins and he became you cuz your desire is to serve him first John 3:20 20 uh and 21 it says for our heart if our heart condemns us he is greater than our heart and knoweth all things amen if our heart condemns us he's greater he actually he actually started to tell sister Bruce he said sister Bruce you think I he said you you think I you you have been under the vision that's what he says you've been under a vision I know who you are and sometimes we have to understand that God is a perfect and better judge than our own conscience that our our conscience is going to condemn us but we have a better judge and he's saying don't you think I know who you are don't you think I know that you're struggling with this but your desire is this he is a better judge it's the difference between an imperfect judge called her conscience and omniscience you cannot compare your cons with him if our hearts condemn us remember he knows our heart he knows who you are if the conscience condemns us it verdict is neither infallible nor final right we can still appeal to God who's greater than our heart because he's the maker of it am he has the power over it and the management of it and his hands and um and it's in his hands and he is the Searcher and tri of it he is a greater witness than the conscience and a superior judge than it he's greater than our conscience he's greater than our heart he's greater than what we think we are so that fear sometimes it it's a self-imposed fear because God remember there is no condemnation there is no condemnation through Christ Jesus to those that are in Christ Jesus here in 1 John 4:17 he says I'm just going to reread it he says here in is our love made perfect that we have boldness in the day of judgment now brother brandham he says and if you look at Revelations 1:17 John was transmitted to the aisle of Patmos in the spirit over in the Lord's day this is the day of men men are fighting but the day of the Lord will come when these kingdoms will become the kingdoms of our Lord and of his Christ and there will be a great Millennium the Lord's Day the day of his coming his judgment that'll be the Lord's day so now you're talking about this man that he said that we hearing our is made perfect it's been matured that we have boldness in the day of judgment then two two books after that you see them transmitted into that very day in front of the very judge and Revelations 1:17 he says and when I saw him this one that had the white wig the one with the eyes as flames of fire the ones with the feet of brass now he's standing in front of him let's see how he acts let's see if he has boldness he says when I saw him I fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying fear not he's saying fear not I am the first and the last so even though John he said one day we'll be perfect where we can stand right in front of the judge he stood in front of the judge and he fell condemnation hit him fear hit him because he was in front of the judge but he is a greater judge than we are so then he reassured him and he says fear not John don't you think I know who you are he says I am the greater judge I am the ultimate judg even though John felt condemnation even though he felt fear and fell at his feet or fell at his face John or God he put his right hand on him and he said fear not brother brandham he says in closing he says no human could stand the full V the effect of the vision his strength utterly Gone John fell at his feet though as dead but the hand of the Lord in love touched him you're talking about the most terrifying form of God you're talking about the most terrifying day yet when he touched him it was in love why because John was somebody no because he was his child that's how God deals with us he says but the hand of of the Lord in love touched him and the voice of blessing said fear not don't be afraid I am the first and the last and I am he that liveth and was dead and behold I am alive Evermore what is to fear the Judgment fell upon him at the cross at the grave and when he descended it was for us he absorbed the full brunt of the wound of sin and there and um there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus see for the shity our attorney is our judge he is both attorney and judge as judge the case is settled it is finished now there now therefore no condemnation why should the church fear what promise has he ever failed to manifest before us why should it fear punishment or death it has been overcome he he is the mighty conqueror and first John if You' like to T stand with me First John 3 21 it says beloved if our hearts condemn us not then we have confidence toward God if it condemns us he's greater but there's a point where if our hearts do not condemn us we have the confidence towards God brother Branham he says now watch Jesus with the bride as the king and queen sat at the throne the white Throne judgment the books were open and the books of the Sinners and the books and another book was open which was the book of life and every man was judged thus by the bride know ye not taking these little matters before the law know ye not that the Saints shall judge the Earth see see all right will'll be there and we'll be like him we see him and we're not going to fall like John see John was still in the progression but there'll be a point where we'll be we'll see him we'll take his hand and we the Saints will judge the Earth let us bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord I just ask that you bless each and every person here you take this these little words of encouragement and just strengthen the faith of the believer father that we know that Satan will come just as the accuser and the father of lies and try to disarm a child of God by lies and by by certain things but father you have given us the the defense of your word father you have given us the confidence showing that you loved us and because you loved us we can love you that everything that we are is not because of ourselves but because of you every progression that we've made is Because of You Lord every maturity is because of your help Father and I ask Lord that you continue Lord and continue and continue to bless your people and touch them in a mighty way father to that day Lord touch our pastor father father as he's homesick and those that are not here father I ask that you just send a special blessing to those that are not feeling well those that are going through certain things Lord Jesus in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen amen God bless you God be with you
