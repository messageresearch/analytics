TRANSCRIPT
========================================
In Colossians 1:26-27, it says, "Even the mystery which hath been hid from the a from ages and generations, but now is made manifest to his saints, to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of the mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory." Amen. You may be seated. Now, I'm sure um if not all of us, most of us have listened to uh Christ is the mystery of God revealed. And brother Brandham really expands on this um scripture and um goes into how Christ is in all things. He's all in all and um and how throughout the whole ages, God was trying to express something to the people, but it was hidden through the ages. this mystery and and finally here it's saying that this mystery that was hidden to the Gentiles now is given to the Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope of glory and um I I want to hit in this subject of hope the hope of glory um it's honestly one of my um something that I've always thought of for years and years and years just this thought of hope and um how you know me as a Christian in my Christian walk how I've thought of hope in my life and and how I've always felt like sometimes when I wasn't feeling the greatest in my faith where I felt like I was trying to reach for something um it a thought came to me I was thinking well you just you just have hope and you just have this this weaker version of faith &gt;&gt; and and you can't grasp what you want because you're just wishing and you're hoping and you're trying to be optimistic and um and and it is true there is there is a version of of faith that that here in the English version we use hope as an optimism something that that we wish we want something to happen and a lot of times we put that in front of our faith and we think that's a faith we begin to imagine that that that is faith that is driving us yet it's it's there's doubt all over it and brother Brandham he he goes really deep into that um here in the in the message uh mystery explained my ministry explained he says and 90% of the people that comes to the line have hope instead of faith now hope is one thing and faith is another so he's he's making them distinct things, two different things. He's saying faith is a positive sense. It's not a guesswork. You don't just imagine it. So, so this hope that he's talking about, it's something that we're we're guessing, we're presuming, we're imagining it. &gt;&gt; He says it's just as real as any other sense of your body. Just the same as sight. Sight is real. He's talking about faith. How faith there is a substance there. there's something um uh real there. So, human hope, it's often reduced to a mere optimism, a positive outlook um based on your personal desires or expectations or or how we founded this hope in the first place. It's it's based on things around us. &gt;&gt; We we hope that we do something or or we're always hoping for something. Brother Brandham, I'm going to um read a few quotes if you don't mind just because brother Brandham really goes into this. He says in perseverant, he says, "Yeah, if you it it it'll happen, but see most people has hope and wish." So he's putting hope and wish together and so forth. It becomes weak. Oh, very very weak when you go to speaking in terms of faith. So he's saying that there's this hope. It's very very weak when you try to put it in in the aspect of faith. We're hoping for something but we really don't have the substance of it. In another um script another quote he in my redeemer liveth he says it can be filled. Now he's talking about this true experience. He says it can be filled um with that felt with the inner charge that's inside of a human body called the new birth. the soul has has been magnetized unto him and once in a while you'll let your mind your minds be concentrated on him believing on him after a while something a reality you can feel something sweep over your being that's the vindication of his resurrection &gt;&gt; then he says it's not a guess so &gt;&gt; it's not a I hope so how many times have we used that word I I hope so there's very a lot tones and context that we use I hope so for optimism hope where it says well are you going to be here or or are you going to get the job I hope so right we a lot of times we use the cautious and the tentative tentative hope where it's more subdued and and it shows a little doubt where it's um well do you think the surgery will go well people say well I hope so right I hope so what what brother says This reality is not a guess or I hope so. &gt;&gt; But a lot of times we walk in with I hope so. Polite acknowledgement which in some cases when when they say well um are you going to be there or or am I going to see you? Well, I hope so. Right? Sarcastic where they say, "Well, um do you think they're going to fix the issue?" I hope so. Right? So, we're using this I hope so. But brother Ben Brandham says it has no it's weak. &gt;&gt; It it's there's there's no substance in there. &gt;&gt; And honestly, that's how the world is today. They're in this this cycle of hope. We I'm sure many many people in this world seen that that uh tsunami. They were afraid. They were but they they maybe had a little bit of optimism. Right. Oh, I hope the tsunami doesn't hit us with the earthquake. All the things at war, all the rumors, all the things that going on, the the world is is afraid. Nations are afraid. People are scared and and they're they're holding on to a I hope so. Brother Brandham says in the message confirmation of commission, he says the whole world is scared to death. And the whole world, even our nation, is like a little boy going through a graveyard at night whistling to keep himself from being afraid. We know it lays at the door. &gt;&gt; That's optimism. That's human hope. &gt;&gt; That's a I hope so. When we're we're whistling trying to make ourselves feel okay, say, you know what, there's there's hope. I hope this is going to happen. Right. &gt;&gt; I hope this is going to be brother Brandham. The reason I wanted to go through this because then brother Brandham goes on and he he says in many many messages how and the scripture also says it where we're going to we're going to see how you have hope as one of the greatest witnesses that a Christian has today. So, so this and the reason why I wanted to talk about this weak hope because that is a natural hope. That is an optimism that people have. But there is a true godly hope that a Christian should have every single day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They they they're standing and they're waiting on a hope. Their their faith is on a hope. I believe there's I forgot how much but it's over I I believe 158 times hope is used in the Bible about 50some times in the New Testament. So, so a lot of times when I was a young person I would look at these scriptures and I'd be like well try I don't know how how to deal with this because my version of hope was this weak weakling of of of of a thing. Sure. &gt;&gt; So, so now your your scripture is chocked full of this word hope. Yet, if if you don't see it in the right lens, you're going to kind of push it to a side because hope is a weak version of faith. It's a weakling. It can't get you there. It can't get you to the promise. But then, brother Brandham, he says in in um here him, he's talking about Jesus and and how he has his three witnesses, Peter, James, and John. And he says, "Now as Jesus God taken up his son to the mount transfiguration before three witnesses," he doesn't call them their names. He says love, hope, and faith. He says those three elements. Now, an element is a distinct part. &gt;&gt; It's its own thing. It's not a weaker version. It's a distinct part. So these three things are elements, distinct parts. He says those three elements the sufficient elements to work out every problem the church has. &gt;&gt; So every Christian should have these three things hope faith and love. Well how are they positioned in our lives? Brother Bram says those three elements will work out every single problem the church has. You let faith, hope, and charity get among the people in a church and watch what takes place. He says, so he manifested his son before these great these great elements, hope, faith, and charity. Now, I want you to notice now under the cloud. Now, he talks about um Elijah and Jesus and and Moses, how under the cloud there was three more witnesses. But but um brother these these are distinct parts. These are things that are needed. Brother Brandham says these are the greatest witnesses are needed in a church to fix any problem. &gt;&gt; And we know that we are a temple. We are a church within ourselves. So we're we need that need hope, faith, and love. So every issue that we have, we rely on these three things. In in Job 27:8, it says, "For what hope do the godless have when God cuts them off?" And now this is the New Living Translation. And just so that it'll be more um understandable or it was more understandable to me, but it says, "For what hope do the godless have when God cuts them off and takes away their life?" So, so without God when there is a cutting away from God, hope is lost. So, hope is is needed or God is needed for the hope to be there. Hope is an element. That's why in 1 Thessalonians 4:13 and 14 it says, "But I will not have you ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not even as others which have no hope." So there's a hope in Christ. There's a hope in a believer. For if we believers that Jesus died um no no for for if we believe that Jesus died and rose again even so them which are asleep in Jesus will God bring with him. That's our hope in as a Christian. &gt;&gt; Without God, without Christ, we have no hope. We have no expectation. That's what hope is. It's a sure expectation of something that is coming. And one of the greatest expectations that Jesus showed from his time all the way to re revelations all the way to the end of the book of revelations is I will come quickly. I will be there. These things will happen shortly after this. This will happen. So there has to be an element of expectation and that's where the Christian stands with his hope. &gt;&gt; And if that's taken away, you're you're cut away from God. And um and so this this hope it's a Greek word and and in Hebrew there's a lot of words. There's tikva and um uh well there's many more that I don't remember but there's a lot in Hebrew which is used for hope which means waiting expectation waiting on the Lord. In Greek, there's this word elpus and it signifies this positive expectation or anticipation of something good in the future. It's not just a vague wish like like a like human hope, but it's a confident hope based on faith, &gt;&gt; faith and trust. And now you have alpito, which is kind of the verb derived from alpis, and it's used the act of hoping. So that's what the Christian hope is. It's an expectation of the future. &gt;&gt; Now here um brother Brandham continues on with these three witnesses. He says now just so that we can see how important these witnesses are. He says in spiritual adoption he says the three God's speaking to them now the three is a confirmation. He's taking um with him Peter, faith, James, hope, John, charity, faith, hope, and charity. These three, if you can have faith, hope, and love, you're near the kingdom. Then these three great things. Now, you he always had these people in um his great events. He had them in the transfiguration. He had them with uh Jarius's daughter, and he had them at the Garden of Gethsemane. And if you want to just look at it a as a Christian, if you look into the Bible, you start seeing why these three elements needed to be there. Why these three people needed to represent love, faith, and hope that these things where where Jesus, he was showing what love in the mount transfiguration, but he was showing a hope of a resurrection. &gt;&gt; Where Jarius's daughter, he was showing the faith. Right? &gt;&gt; And with the Gethsemane, he was showing love for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son. And you can continue on and see so much more how God uses these three elements or these three witnesses in those great events. So he used him. So as a Christian, whenever we're going through things, whenever faith is needed, whenever there there's a healing needs to be done, love, faith, and hope is there. Whenever there's a glorification, love, faith, and hope is there. And whenever you're going through the darkest times of your life, love, faith, and hope has to be there. Those three elements in a Christian's life. &gt;&gt; So he he says, he continues on in spiritual adoption. And he says, "Under these three uh under the witness of hope, under the witness of faith, under the witness of love, God placed his son positionally in the public of all three greatest manifestations, hope, faith, and love that the world will ever know." So these are elements, the greatest witnesses, and he says the three greatest manifestations, love, faith, and hope. Now, in the scripture, if you'd like to turn with me to um 1 Corinthians 13:3, here is where Paul he he starts to explain this. And of course, we know 13, he starts talking about love, talks about charity, how it never fails, and and how it's greater. But then then he starts talking about something amazing that we see in our time today. He says in uh 13:9, 1 Corinthians 13:9, he says, "For we know in part and we prophesy in part. But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be a done away with, done away. When I was a child, I spake as a child. I understood as a child. I thought as a child, but when I became a man, I put away childish things. For for now we see through a glass darkly, but then face to face. Now I know in part, but then I shall know even as I am um even as also I am known. And 13 he says and now. So he's talking about the perfection to come which we know through the word is here. &gt;&gt; He said a perfection was going to come. We know in part but one day we'll know in full. And we know that that as the time as the ages, God was hiding a mystery. &gt;&gt; And now it's revealed to us. &gt;&gt; But but he says as these things are going on as these things cuz if I would want a raise of hands, who's perfect today? We we nobody would raise their hand. Even though perfection is here, &gt;&gt; we're still walking into those things, &gt;&gt; we're still walking into a perfection, being fully known by God &gt;&gt; and fully knowing God. So, so as we are walking into this perfection that has already been provided for us, here it says, "And now abideth faith, hope, and charity." these three but the greatest of these three is charity. So, so hope is not a weak version of faith. It works with faith. &gt;&gt; Just as faith works with love. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham, he says an amazing quote here in says in the message he swore by himself. He says, "Watch three. Everything in the Bible is three. Three blends to a one. see the father, the son, um the the father, the son, holy spirit, not three gods, one. &gt;&gt; So you have these three elements or these three distinct parts, but it's one person. &gt;&gt; Then he says faith, hope, and charity. Not three different things, but all the essence of one love. So they're all flowing from love. They're all flowing from something. Now, now I'm understanding what what the prophet was was saying, how some people have hope and not have faith. And how some people have this optimism or or this expectation, but yet they don't have faith because they have one or the other when you need all three. here um in in 1 Corinthians 13:2 how he was talking about love, Paul explains it. He says, "And though I have the gift of prophecy and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and though I have all faith so that I can remove mountains and have not charity, I am nothing." So hope without faith, you're nothing. Faith without love, you're nothing. It all is incapac or incompassed with one love. &gt;&gt; If you have hope without having love or without having faith, then you're going to be there wishing and hoping and and not having the substance of things hoped for. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Same thing with faith. We always talk about it how, oh, we got faith to move mountains. We got faith to heal the sick. We've got faith. But we don't have love for one another. &gt;&gt; Amen. We don't have love for God. &gt;&gt; Then it becomes what? Nothing. Void. &gt;&gt; It's absolutely nothing. So, brother Brandham, he says in the message desperations, he says, and the same thing that is we must have love before we can have faith. And faith when we have genuine love, what does it do? It pushes our faith out on the battlefront for God. So when you love the Lord, when and how do we love the Lord? The Bible says, "For he loved us first. I love him because he first loved me." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So there has to be this thing where as Jesus says uh um no man could come to me unless the father draws. So if you have love, it's because God has already called you. &gt;&gt; And if you have love for God, even if it's you you feel it's not enough, it's not sufficient, it's love, then faith begins to work. The Bible, Brother Brandham says that faith pushes or or love pushes faith out to the battlefront for God. See, gen God, a genuine godly love for God and his word and his people will push faith out there. Love just takes a hold of faith and and just come on, let's go. And it goes cuz that's what love does. John 14:23, Jesus says, "If a man loves me, he keeps my word." Now, you can't keep his word without having faith in what he said. So see, if he loves God, then he keeps his word. If he said, "I'm the Lord that health thee," he believes that love makes him believe it because love dominates it all. &gt;&gt; So you you now we're we're understanding that they can't be apart. And if love is apart from all of them, don't worry. Faith is going to come. hope is gonna come because love that is God. John says God is love. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; So love is the essence of your faith and your hope. You seek for God first. You seek for the love of God. You seek for the Holy Spirit. Then you'll see your faith stand. And then when you see these future events, when you see the the world shaking, when you see all those things and you're still in your human body, you can hope for a better future. &gt;&gt; You can expect for something better because your faith is standing there. In Galatians 5 uh 5-6, here we see this correlation between all three. He says, "For we through the spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith. For in Jesus Christ, neither circumcision avaleth anything nor uncircumcision, but faith which workketh by love." &gt;&gt; So, so love like brother Brandham says pushes faith or it energizes faith and it working fa So faith is working through love. So true faith is alive and active only when it's rooted in love for God and for others. So you first have that then faith what does it do? It sustains your hope. What is your hope? your eager awaiting because the Bible says in in uh I believe it's uh Proverbs 23 4:23 it says hope that that uh doesn't come it makes you sick that that something if hope doesn't manifest something is wrong. So you have to have faith to sustain your hope. He says by uh by faith we eagerly await for the hope of righteousness. It's by faith. Faith trusts in God's promise and hope expects their fulfillment. Now that's why you know seeing this scripture hope in in uh uh Hebrews 11:1 it says now faith is the substance of things hoped for and the evidence of things not seen. Now you can see it and separate it as as hope not having faith and and it has no substance but then you can see it in the other way where it's working with each other. &gt;&gt; Faith is the assurance of things that you hoped for. It's the convictions of the of the things that not are not seen. Faith is present oriented. It's trust in God's word and hope is a future confidence in God's promises. So faith what it does it apprehends the promises and hope anticipates their fulfillment. Faith is the root and and and and if you like to say hope is the seed or the flower. Whenever whenever um somebody is healed, brother Brandham says your healing is the earnest of your resurrection. That's what he said in the Easter Seal. Your healing, the Holy Ghost, everything that God does for you is the earnest of your resurrection. &gt;&gt; And how did you get your healing is by your faith &gt;&gt; because you believed in God. You believed in his promises. And when you receive that healing, whenever you were completely healed, when you saw those things go away, then you have the hope in a resurrection. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Saying, Lord, because you did this, I know I've got the earnest. &gt;&gt; I know I've got the rope. I've got the token. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That there is going to be a greater day. There's going to be a resurrection. &gt;&gt; So faith is that substance. It's that earnest of what you're hoping for. Romans 5:2, it also says, "By whom we we also by whom also we have access by faith into his grace wherein we stand and rejoice in hope of the glory of God." If you like to turn with me in Romans um 4:18, it's I I love this scripture here. Paul is talking about Abraham and Abraham's situation, how he was a hundred years old and and here it says who against hope. Romans uh 4:18 it says whom against hope believed in hope. Now that that's a contradiction there against hope believed in hope that he might become the father of nations according to what which was spoken. So shall thy seed be. And Paul, he intentionally uses the same word alpus. And there I understand that this same word taken out of faith and using our own human reasonings and using our own optimism, it becomes void. We can lose hope real quick. And and in in um if you think about it in in Abraham's situation, he had no wiggle room of hope. Th this this hope it it arises this human hope it arises from an um observable rational expectations, right? our see, taste, feel, smell, and hear. What we know of the of what we know of science and all these things, our rational expectations. It's grounded in the laws of nature, human reasoning, and probability. For for Abraham, natural hope has run its course. Think about it. He was 100 years old and Sarah was well past childbearing age. According to human um logic, the possibility of having a child was zero. So there was no hope. There was no hope for this man. But he says that against this hope, against no hope, he believed in hope. &gt;&gt; So what is this hope? It's a spiritual or supernatural hope that arises only. It can only arise through faith. &gt;&gt; He believed he had faith in this hope. &gt;&gt; So this hope comes with faith. It arises from the faith in God's promise independent and visible uh independent of the visible evidence that was there. It's rooted in the trust of God's character, his faithfulness, his word. So this hope, it'll persist and not only persist, but it will grow stronger. Against hope, against all reasoning, against everything. When somebody says it's too late, it's done for you. You believe. Even though everything in your mind says it's too late for for me to be healed, it's for too late for this, it's too late for that, it's for too late for me to be saved. Against all hope &gt;&gt; against all human reasoning, against all voices. &gt;&gt; I still believe in hope. &gt;&gt; I still believe in the word. &gt;&gt; This hope is rooted in faith. It comes from God's word. &gt;&gt; Amen. So against hope, it's this recognition of absolute impossibility. In hope is placing trust in God's word, &gt;&gt; in his promises. That is true hope. Having trust in God. Well, it hasn't come in yet. It doesn't matter. It It's going to come. &gt;&gt; It's going to come. Why? Because I believe. I have faith in his word. So I know I have hope in the future. &gt;&gt; I hope have hope in the things even though everything looks glim even though everything doesn't look right. Even though everything's working against me, I have hope. Why? Because God told me so. Brother Brandham, he he explains this. He in wisdom versus faith. He says, "Against hope yet believed in hope. &gt;&gt; Hopees is all gone. Yet he believed in it when hope was uh done dead to him. Hope was dead to every scientific search, every resource of wisdom. Hope was gone. But still he believed in it. What was it? Faith in it. Faith in hope. When hope wasn't there. H he says, I'd like to linger on that for a while. faith in hope when there was no hope there. Yet he still believed in hope. See, because he said, "He told me, so shall thy seeds be." That's amazing. And and that's the Christian's hope. It It's something has to be rooted in here first. And if we go back to Colossians 1:27, he says, "To whom God would make known the riches of his um glory, of his mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, &gt;&gt; the hope of glory." &gt;&gt; So what's the hope of glory? He just didn't say which is the hope of glory. He says Christ in you &gt;&gt; is your hope of glory. Christ in you is your expectation. &gt;&gt; Christ in you is your confidence in Christ. &gt;&gt; He says in Christ the mystery of God revealed. He says notice next. Now I I just want to um show what this Christ in you is. And he explains it here. He says notice next. Secondly, the manifested Christ in you, the hope of glory, the great manifested God in Christ, now Christ manifested in you says we'll hurry. Look, what um what um was once God's great secret, great mystery secret in his mind is now put in the heart of the believer. &gt;&gt; That is the body of Christ. What was it once great secret in his mind before the foundation of the world is now made manifest. &gt;&gt; So this this word all these promises all of these things that God hid gave it to you. &gt;&gt; And because you have it because you have Christ in you have a hope of glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. So where Jesus is called our hope, this phrase emphasizes that Christ is the foundation of our certain hope for eternal life there it like like says when God cuts somebody out there is no hope. &gt;&gt; Even Paul where he says not like us not like others that sorrow because they have no hope of the resurrection. He says, "But you, Christ, you're tethered to him." As the brother said, &gt;&gt; you're you're anchored. &gt;&gt; In Hebrews, it says, "Hope is an anchor of your soul." &gt;&gt; When you're anchored, when Christ is in you, you have hope &gt;&gt; of a better life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not only something way out in the future, you have hope of restoration now. Amen. &gt;&gt; You have hope of something great now that God is giving and he's unfolding every single day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There is a hope. There's an expectation. &gt;&gt; So it's it's this certain hope, but yet it's amazing because it's hope is something of the future, but he says Christ in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So it's this certain hope of eternal life, yet it's the source of our spiritual life now. Christ in you. Now &gt;&gt; see this hope isn't some imaginary. It's not a guess so. It's not a I hope so. It's not a a wish. &gt;&gt; It's something here now waiting for something over there. &gt;&gt; So this phrase Christ in you, the hope of glory in Colossians 1:27, it means that that Christ is dwelling in us. And and in in uh Ephesians 3:17, it says it's dwelling in the Gentiles by faith. It says in Ephesians 3:17, it says that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith that ye be rooted and grounded in love. There you go, all three. And in Colossians, it says Christ in you. So this dwelling in you is by faith. That's so faith is the substance first. Faith brings Christ to you and then love is what establishes you. It's the foundation. It says it's the root. &gt;&gt; It's what hold it. It's the essence of all three of them. But first you have to have your faith. Faith in the one that loves you. And when you understand he loves you, then he'll take your faith. He'll take intellectual faith. He'll take the hope that you have and he'll wrap it around. And he says, "These are the greatest witnesses. These are the greatest elements in your life. Wherever you go, you have love for God and the brethren. You have faith to to for whatever comes in front of you presently and you have hope in every promise &gt;&gt; that he's given you. &gt;&gt; So this Christ in you it it's it's by faith. Christ in you the hope of glory. Now Christ in you the hope of glory. It's the source of your confident hope of a future heaven, of a future eternity. And that that's despite all of our past, despite all of our degradation, despite of everything, us being called a gentile, despite all of that, &gt;&gt; we have a confidence. Amen. &gt;&gt; Ephesians, it says Ephesians 2:12, it says that that at that time ye ye were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers of the uh from the covenant of the pro promise, having no hope, and without God in the world. &gt;&gt; So, we were separated from him. Now by faith, Christ is in us, rooted in love. Now we've got hope. &gt;&gt; Against all hope, against everything against everything against you, we have hope. &gt;&gt; We have hope. So he says this mystery that was hidden before the ages. So is he's saying that now the the mystery now reveal revealed it elevates you to a glorious hope. Now that we have this mystery, we have a hope. &gt;&gt; It's showing that those without the mystery, maybe there's a false hope, maybe there's conception that they have, maybe there's something that they think they have. But when the mystery is given to you, it says the mystery was hidden throughout the ages, now is revealed to the Gentiles, which is Christ in you. That's your hope of glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. So the mystery now revealed elevates you to the glorious hope Christ in you and it refers also to your current hidden spiritual life. So you have your hope, you have your spiritual life, Christ in you. Colossians 3:3 it says, "For ye are dead and your life is hid with Christ in God." Galatians 2:20, it says, "I am crucified with Christ. Nevertheless, I live uh nevertheless I I live yet not I but Christ that liveth in me. That the life which I live now that I I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the son of God who bel who loved me and gave himself for me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So now I live with Christ in me. Now today I have that mystery. So this is an amazing thing. It means that that the mystery made known amongst the men uh Gentiles. It's precisely this. It's Christ present in you assuring your future glory. As simple as that. Christ in you now, &gt;&gt; working in you now, in your life now, &gt;&gt; assuring you for a better future. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I love that. I I love that. I I feel more confident when brother Brandham talks about the token &gt;&gt; talking about the earnest how how by faith we have this token. We have this Christ in us and that token is showing is it's giving a signal to everyone around us saying I have the hope. This ship is falling but I have the life vest. &gt;&gt; That's what it is. It's a hope, brother Brandham. He he says in Christ is the mystery of God revealed. He says, "Now listen close. I don't want you to fail fail this." Now, he's going to explain that it's only this that God looks for. He says, "I I don't want you to fail to get this. No other church, no other sign, no other fellowship, no other government, no other testimony, no other creed, no other denomination is acceptable outside of this. God accepts nothing else but Christ in you, the hope of glory. &gt;&gt; The only thing God recognizes, no fellowship, no church, no creed, no denomination, no nothing. Everything else is dead. It's fragments that has to be cut off, pruned away from the thing that Christ might live with preeminence in you. &gt;&gt; I I started to think about that. Um I'm not going to hold you too long, but I started to think about that how Christ in us that is our hope by faith rooted in love. And now we have hope that that that is the the flower. That's the last thing of this hope. I mean this faith or this love, faith and hope. We have hope because we have love because we have faith. And started to think about Rahab, how God gave Abraham a promise. God told Abraham, "I'm gonna give you a land, and this land, it's going to be yours. But before I give you this land, your people are going to have to be souljourners &gt;&gt; in another land for four generations." He says, he says, "And after that, he says, for the iniquity of the Amorites, when they it it's full, that's when I'm going to give you the land." But he says, "The iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full." This is in Genesis 15:16. So, so he's giving them a promise, but he's saying the sin has to be so bad in that land that the very land is going to spew them out. And in Leviticus, I'm not going to read it, in Leviticus 18:24, it shows how how before they're going to walk into the land, he begins to tell them that don't defile yourself like these people. that these people are are are defiled people and the land is going to spew them out and you I don't want you to do anything with them. That means don't don't spare one all man, woman and child. I want them gone. Why? Because the the iniquity of the Amorites is full. So that's that's what they do. Of course they they failed the first time in Kadesh Barnea. They failed. But now you've got Joshua and he sends two two spies and he they go into Jericho and they find this woman that the most unlikely woman. &gt;&gt; She she had no glory in herself. She's if you want to I could see myself in her because we are Gentiles, aliens from God, &gt;&gt; unworthy, having no hope. And now you see this woman. She she's walking around. Not only that, but Jericho is in the same condition that maybe United States is in today, having no hope. &gt;&gt; The iniquity of the Amorites. They're full and and they heard of the judgments coming and they're scared. There's no hope. But then she sees these men and by faith, the Bible says, Hebrews 11:31, it says, "By faith the harlot Rahab perished not with them that believe not." When she had received the uh the spies with peace. I don't know how it happened, but she saw them and maybe she, you know, how they they kind of a Airbnb, but she was worse than that. But she she had her home out there and she said, "Stay at my place." She received him with peace by faith. It says, &gt;&gt; "So first her faith had to be activated." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; First she had to believe. &gt;&gt; Maybe she had to believe in these promises. Maybe they were saying something and and she was just says, "You know what? These people are different. You know what? What what do I have? What hope do I have in this world? We know that the Israelites are coming. We know judgment is coming. We have no hope. &gt;&gt; So by faith she went. James, it says, "Likewise, James uh 2:25, likewise also Ray Rahab also was not Rahab um the harlot justified by works when she received the messengers and had sent them out another way." So by faith she received him. She began to work and she brought him in. She began to tell them, "We we know we know your God. We believe. We know how great he is. We know what he did at the Red Sea. We know what all all these things happened. We we know who you are." and and and because of that her her her desperation, she began to say, "Show kindness to to me and my family." Even there was a point where the king came down and he realized that she was harboring these people and and she was sent forward and and she had to lie for them. And when she went back, she says, "You know what? I'm risking my life, but but you are my only hope. &gt;&gt; You are my only hope of salvation. do something for me that that you can save me and my family. They said, "You know what? Our life is in your hands." And as as um she she lied to those people and they went out, she sent the spies away and she told them what to do and she sent them out out of her window with a scarlet robe rope. And as they went down, they said, "You know what? Leave this rope down here. Leave it hanging. And if we see that rope, we know not to mess with this house. We know to save every single person that is in this house, we're going to save these people. So, anybody that you have, friends, family, anybody that you have, bring them in. &gt;&gt; At first, she was the outcast. I'm sure she was the one that was no good. She was the sinner, but now she has her faith and now she has a string coming out and and she has the the the place of hope. That word, the reason why I'm saying this is because it was very uh interesting to me because that Hebrew word for line or rope is the word tikva. And and it's very strange because it could either be used as cord, rope, or hope. And so so she what she did was by faith she threw down that rope. And what was she doing? She was displaying the token. She was displaying. She had faith in what those people were saying. And now she's displaying the hope. She's showing I have hope that when they come nothing is going to happen because that is there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's like us Christ in me. You take Christ in. Doesn't matter what we've done. No matter what the past is, no matter if we were alienated from God, you take Christ in. You take his promises in. &gt;&gt; Now, that is your scarlet rope. &gt;&gt; That is your token. &gt;&gt; And that token is your hope of glory. &gt;&gt; And that's that's what she did. As they came, she brought everybody in and she was saved. And the amazing thing is she becomes the great great grandmother of David. &gt;&gt; Even though maybe she she thought she was nobody, because she believed and she acted on her hope, acted on her faith, she was saved. &gt;&gt; Amen. Romans 15:13 in closing it says if you guys would like to stand and and the musicians come up says now the God of of hope I I like that. See I I can't I can't scrub that off of the the Bible. I can't say oh that's that's a weak version of faith. He is the God of hope. &gt;&gt; He he produces it. &gt;&gt; It is him. He is the God of all good expectations. &gt;&gt; Everything good, everything that is the word, it has to come to pass. And that's why he is the God of hope. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing that ye may abound in hope through what? Through the power of the Holy Ghost. How do we have hope? It's through the power of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Why do we have hope? Because Christ in you, the hope of glory, brother Barham, he says we have a token today. And also, we're safe as long as we stay under that scarlet cord, the blood of Jesus Christ. As an individual, not a group, an individual, we each must stay under the scarlet cord of the blood of Jesus Christ. That is our hope. We stay under him. I don't care what comes. I don't care what we have to go through, what this body has to suffer, what this mind has to go through. &gt;&gt; I'm in Christ. My life is in Christ. And because of that, I can hope for a better day. &gt;&gt; I know that something greater is going to happen. Let us bow our heads brother. Heavenly Father, Lord, I just ask, Father, that even now, Father, that you may relay your your word and in our hearts to realize that that you've set the greatest things in our lives that yet we're not perfect. Yet maybe some some are. No, in part, but now abideth. Now abideth. Now for the journey we have hope, faith and love. Those things one day they they're going to pass away because hope is only for something that we're waiting for. Faith is something that is an evidence of not seen. But one day we will see. We will be there. We will know as we are known. And it'll all be engulfed in your love &gt;&gt; because your love is from eternity to eternity, Lord. One day we'll be there. But as we walk in this life, Father, we ask, Father, that you strengthen our faith, &gt;&gt; strengthen our love, strengthen our hope, &gt;&gt; make our hope more clear as a vision, Father, as as eyesight, seeing the far future, Lord, knowing, Father, that it is coming and it is here. We thank you, Jesus. The name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen and amen. God bless
