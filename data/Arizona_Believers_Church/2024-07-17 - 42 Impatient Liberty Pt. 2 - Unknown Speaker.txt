TRANSCRIPT
========================================
everybody if not every single person here this evening was with us on Sunday so we'll be able to just jump right into the subject this is part two on impatient Liberty and on this subject and use in this title what we're wanting to look at and examine is how that we can use Liberty as an excuse to act out of order to act out of the nature and the character of the word of God and we say that we're we're free and we're where the spirit of the Lord is there is liberty so we kind of take that as a that we can do whatever we want since we have the Holy Spirit whatever we say whatever we do however we act the steps of the good man are ordered of the Lord and uh it must have been God's will because he allowed it to happen so there's a lot of things that we use to justify it and namely we are looking at the Simplicity that is in Christ we're looking at how that God wants to make us a home how we want our families to be homes we want our church to be a home and some of those dynamics that keep it from being so so Simplicity has been what I've been studying on and it's opened up these different channels I think we can make uh make some time to be very deliberate about applying this in a practical way to our home lives but using this Liberty that we have in Christ as a justification or the reason why we do certain things or manifest certain things and we saw when we went through the scriptures of the Temptation in the garden the Temptation in the wilderness and just in different various places how Satan wants us to act out of order or out of season we realize that God's word has to be in season and there can be things that we could um emphasize or stress or things that we could try to make very very important or this is what the word is this is what the message is and it'd be out of season if we were trying to manifest the Millennium now on Earth and we were wanting to uh make certain things come to pass or Express certain things uh it that God is going to rule and reign in a bodily form in his son and in his bride on Earth for a thousand years but to try to enforce that now to act that out now in in a literal fulfillment of those things would be out of season though it's according to his word and in the same way we can try to manifest and express things that are of another age manifest certain things that were given in other ages as this is the age and this is the ultimate and it's with the word of God but it's not what it's not what Christ is stressing now it's not what the emphasis or the rhythm is now and there's uh a lot that we could say in that but he wants us to act out of season through impatience we get anxious we want things to be a certain way and so we we try to make it happen if we're impatient we have this feeling that we want something to happen or we want to possess something now want to happen as soon as possible and a lot of people if you're in if you work or you're in the service industry or you have an employer whenever they give us a job or a task that we need to do and we say when do you want it and they always say yesterday and that indicates some measure of impatience I want it I want it yesterday get it done as soon as possible and that's a a good way of looking at uh that restlessness that comes or this feeling I've got to have something now but that it's that Restless desire that's what's at the heart of impatience it's a Restless desire for excitement a Restless desire for Change and that lack of rest is maybe the most significant application or uh characteristic of this impatience you've you're not at peace you're not at rest things aren't quiet and since you lack patience and you're Restless you are you have this energy this desire to change your state and oh if this could just happen I'll feel plated if this is just happens I'll I I I'll be at rest and so there is this element of doubt that exists whenever we're impatient we don't trust God that he's going to do it so we we feel like oh oh oh I need to get I need this to happen and maybe what we do is we make the mistake of conflating desperation with impatience and and we cannot take this principle of desperation a and use it that W I'm just desperate I'm just desperate when in fact you're just impatient so Satan schemes to produce a Restless longing or that anxious desire we saw it in the woman he even was trying to provoke this in Jesus Christ we were walking through spoken word is the original seed I'd like to touch on a few more things in that sermon maybe tonight but just from a little bit different perspective but this is a a statement where he said what she what is she trying to do and he's really talking about the church Pentecostal Church the L Dey and church age those of Le Dey are characterized with this oh she manufactures a little jumping on the platform not making fun of it it's all right now there's manifestations of the spirit that are given to profit uh all there are gifts of the Spirit that God gives in measures and it works it's the same Spirit working in different individuals in different ways and there's ways that humans react to the stimulus of the spirit that's different some people weep some people silently bow their heads and cry others can be a little bit more um charismatic and I do think it's amazing sometimes if you just look at how the spirit manifest itself among certain people that it's just weird how sometimes it's almost geographical don't know how that works but so there but and there's nothing wrong with it brother Ram says it's all right but the issue is she's manufactures she manufactures something else why to to get members in the church so pride is at the heart of this I want to say this money women and popularity is at the heart of this lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life are at the heart of this what's the matter she just can't wait so I'm just using this to summarize many things we read from the message of the hour and from the sermon about this impatience that was in the woman and this impatience to get things done she just can't wait she can't wait for God to do it they got to get members in there somewhere so they tell them you have to do that W in other words I mean what a ripe field for the Pentecostal church when the Methodist and the Baptists and everyone uh they're not manifesting these things so in order to get members in their Church they say well if your church isn't do doing this you need to leave your church it says you have to do that and away they go he said there's the seed coming right up you have to do it this isn't the Original Seed coming right up but this is that seed of impatience this is that seed of discrepancy it's even the seed of the false Vine which impersonating the True Vine and they turned something that would be um an expression of Faith or expression of Joy expression of enthusiasm from the heart of a Believer when the presence of God moves upon them they've turned it into a Hal to as a litus test as to whether or not God is moving and now it's become an Evidence of the Holy Ghost or an evidence that you're in the bride the evidence that you're right and then they say you have to do that and he said that's the wrong kind of seeden and in she can't wait that's what motivates people to do this I do believe that there is a Vindication that God is going to uh put upon the bride he will vindicate her he will avenge her speedily a and all we can do is call upon God for it and live the word of God and he will do the rest but when we try to vindicate ourselves or avenge ourselves or prove ourselves we we get into dangerous territory now in Revelation 3:1 on Sunday uh one of the brothers was actually quot quoting uh this to me or began to quote it and I finished it because it had been in my notes to use uh uh but in Revelations 3:1 he says because thou Hast kept the word of my patience I also will keep thee from the hour of Temptation which shall come upon all the world to try them that dwell upon the earth now remember how that the Temptation at the end brother B says watch when you get to the end where this temptation come and we know that he says that the bride will be Tried by the word and that this age is evil it is wicked it is Satan's Eden to prove that you are not like that woman and so you will have to be tested and tried or tempted with the whole word doesn't that seeming odd tempted with the word of God and so the word is going to be offered to us uh the word says to do this and in doing so we act and and we're tempting God and so there's a temptation to us and there's a temptation to God and so the Temptation in the end will be like it was in the garden with the woman and it'll be like it was in the wilderness with Christ and so there's going to be a Temptation that comes upon the whole world to try them and it says keeping the word of my patience causes us it gives us power in the hour of Temptation to be kept so what is it that keeps us kept in the hour of Temptation keeping the word of his patience now brother bradam writes this in the Philadelphian Church age he says what does he mean by the word of of his patience Hebrews 613 to15 for when God made promise to Abraham because he could swear by no greater he swear by himself saying surely blessing I Will Bless thee and multiplying I'll multiply thee and so after he had patiently endured he obtained the promise you see the spirit is speaking about the word of God which is given to us so the word of my patience is the word of God if Satan can make us impatient we can't be in the word of God right if he can make us impatient this Restless longing if we can see that the tree is to be desired to make one wise if he can just get our perceptions a little off get us acting in the flesh getting us wanting to do God a service without it being his will acting out of season not being the right man for the job he said then we cannot be in the spirit fulfilling the word of God the spirit is speaking about the word of God which is given to us to wait for the Fulfillment of that word required patience even as it did in the case of Abraham so there's where we mentioned it Sunday that the word it requires patience for the word of God to be fulfilled he endured is seen him who is invisible been studied on the the union of the visible and the invisible he was patient and then the word finally was fulfilled this is the way God teaches his PE people patience now uh really zero in on this and think as we talk about being impatient you think well what's wrong with a little impatience maybe they get the job done squeak squeaky will gets the grease and so there's this uh thought that maybe if if I can just get a little ansy and push the envelope a little bit maybe we'll make things happen but he says if he why this is the way God teaches his people patience why if he fulfilled his word in physical manifestations the very instant you prayed you would never learn patience but would become even more impatient with life I want to do the uh shocked face emoji the blow we should just maybe have a a keypad up here I could just punch it and just and emoticon just pops up the Unicorn the shock unicorn this is that's amazing that when we want to see something manifest if it happens what does it do it just creates more impatience because you see this law of diminishing returns this nasty cycle we get in if church services were always this particular way and then after a while you begin to get impatient if it doesn't happen or if this doesn't happen if that doesn't happen one of the greatest thing God wants to teach us is patience and that's why we can't get in the mind that we always need to be satisfied with some feeling or sensation or have God move immediately when we ask him to because that's not God's nature if he fulfilled his word and physical manifestations every time you ask for it you would get impatient and we we can say that is nothing but but the truth brother brandom even talked about how in certain circles where certain things are emphasized there's more backbiting and jealousy and there's more emotion and intensity and it all relates to that edge that gets on somebody when they need to see physical manifestations they begin to have a little bit of an impatient nature and therefore they lack grace and patience for other people let alone God or God let alone other people however you want to say that but patience is such an incredible virtue in James 1: 2 3 and 4 my brethren count it all joy when you fall into diverse Temptations how are we going to overcome Temptation by keeping the word of his patience so he says count it all joy when you fall into these many different Temptations knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh patience the woman's Faith was being tried Christ's Faith was being tried he was being tempted with the word to tempt god with the word but he had to keep the word of patience the angels of the Lord eventually came and ministered to him just as they would have if he left off the temple just as he was trying to accomplish by turning the stones into bread and the Lord is G going to give him all kingdoms and dominions he just had to wait to do it God's way the Trine of your faith worketh patience and he says but let patience have her perfect work the word of my patience the word of my patience is the the the word of my patience is the word that God has given to us so let the word of patience let patience have her perfect work that you may be perfect and entire wanting nothing amen through impatience we we get more impatient and it gets worse and worse and worse and it creates this negative feedback loop where it just has to become an echo chamber that Cycles around and there's a lot of cognitive dissonance and there's a lot of emotion and a lot of rallying in order to keep things afloat but let patience have her perfect work and that's how the bride is perfected Abraham's testimony demonstrates patience demonstrates that patience is required to fulfill the word he waited for the Fulfillment of the word now just to give us a little bit of Grace let's look at Abraham and see we see that in Abraham it Beed out that ultimately patience brought forth the promise and it required patience he didn't tell Abraham I'm going to give you seed and and he God speaks to him he says I'm going to give you children and Seed and he wakes up in the morning stretches and walks outside of his tent and every goes ABA ABA father father and he's like whoa what is this where are your sons that would have been really creepy uh but that's that's not the way that it happened it took time and God had to unfold in that process and I'm so glad that Abraham's life reveals Supreme faith in Genesis 15:4 it says behold the word of the Lord came unto him saying this shall not be thine Heir this is the one born of his own house he said lo and behold there is a son born to a servant in my household a slave in my household maybe he's the one but he says no this is not your Heir but he shall be but he that shall come forth out of thine own bows shall be thine Heir so God is just bringing it to more Precision Abraham didn't doubt the promise but he thought well since I'm not able to have kids maybe he could be the heir and it's not that Abraham doubted but yet you notice even Abraham in a sincere doesn't understand the promise that God had given him and he's saying oh you told me I would have an heir in my house maybe he's it that's Faith speaking in a way right saying oh well I'm not going to think it has to come any particular way maybe this is the one that it is and God says no it's going to be from yourself and then in chapter 16 and Sarah said unto Abraham behold now the Lord hath restrained me from bearing I pray that go in unto my maid it may be that I may obtain children by her and Abraham hearkened to the voice of Sarah what has happened Abraham thought maybe it was the son of his servant now Sarah with the understanding that it's going to be Abraham she offers her handmade her servant as a wife to Abraham and says maybe if she brings forth this child that I will obtain children by her and we know that Abraham did go unto her and that she conceived and brought forth the son I want you to see how brother brand identified what factors were working in the heart of Sarah to do this brother bam said Sarah tried to give God a little bit of help by herself right wow a little bit of help by herself it was that promise just being slightly doubted she thought she could give God a little help oh he said you're going to have a son well let's just make this work he said in the seed is not air with a shuck and Sarah thinking that God would not be able to keep all of his promises true she told Abraham to take Hagar what she thought is that God would not be able to keep all of his promise true wow the reproach for the cause of the word now you say how do you how do you gather that well her own actions showed that there was some uncertainty where she's now thinking well Abraham's not able to have children by me maybe he can have children by somebody else we'll see if this isn't going to work and he says it was the doubt thinking God wouldn't be able to keep his promises in the reproach for the cause of the word he said they were trying to manufacture something hegar and Sarah to help Abraham Abraham helped God to make his promise come true they were trying to help God do it now again it's this Paradox of well you believe it you think God can do it you want him to do it so why don't I just help you why don't I just help you do it you can't do that there's no way at all of doing it it's against everything God's word is going to happen anyhow you've just got to stand right on the word and say it's this way and keep the word now watch to manufacture something to take the place of his word we think we're fulfilling the word but it's actually impatience it's actually thinking that we can make it come true and you manufacture something that you would say God said you'd have a son he had a son but manufactured something to take the place of his word he said we could hold snakes and they wouldn't harm us but you've manufactured something to take the place of his word you drink poison because he says you shall drink a deadly thing and it won't harm you but you've manufactured something to take the place of his word it's an impostor it's a twin now in the example of Abraham with Hagar this impatience produced the wrong results the Bible says that the child shall come from thine own vows so it did come from Abraham it was the right seed but the wrong womb and though it was the right seed it being in the wrong room womb at the wrong season and it was born out of this idea of trying to manufacture something it could not produce the right results it did not produce the promised son we see the same thing with the woman e whether it be with the serpent or with Adam in Genesis chapter 6 16:2 and this is the ishmail that was born to Hagar and he will be a wild man his hand shall be against every man and every man's hand against him and he shall dwell in the presence of all his Brethren I want you to consider the results that happen when we manufacture something when it's a put on when it's a replacement for God's promised word when we begin to have some sort of uh we want to help God fulfill his word we lean into this idea of you have to do it and the Liberty is lost because you ought to do it and it's not doing what is right it's not doing what is correct it's not fulfilling the word of God it's a certain Optics to make us feel like we're doing something and accomplishing something saying yep word of God is being fulfilled notice the nature it begins to produce within people he will be a wild man his hand will get be be against man and every man's hand against him brother Brenham says in Hebrews chapter 6 part 3 now anytime you disbelieve the naked word of God and adopt some other way it'll be a thorn in your flesh from there on wow so anytime you swap out the naked word of God for some other way it is a thorn in your flesh so it will make you uncomfortable right it'll make you act in ways that you don't need to be acting it'll make you anxious and agitated it'll make you walk in pain it'll change the way you walk it'll change the way you think it'll change your desires you'll get desperate to lose it you'll think that you could just lean into it more and get used to it but anytime you swap out the naked word of God for a manufactured something it will be a thorn in your flesh he said you just take what God said if he said it that's just the way he means he says oh bless be his name just take the word that's what ishmail was when the right seed went to the wrong womb what happened when the woman received the wrong seed evees impatience birthed an ill-tempered selfish sensu sensual murderer that's the kind of son he was in Jude 11 it says wo unto them for they have gone in the way of Cain the way of Cain is also put in line in the greedy they ran greedily after the heir of balum for reward and perish in the gains of Kora this isn't good company if God's word has a Hall of Fame this is a hall of Shame they've gone in the way of Cain motivated by jealousy motivated by hatred motivated by popularity motivated by gain motivated by feelings and emotions they have gone in the way of Cain ishmail was a Wild Man Cain was a murderer he was sensual he was uh uh Ang easily agitated brother bandam says in the sermon identification and the word is the place to defeat the enemy that's what you give Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden to defeat the enemy and when Eve reasoned with it and projected reasons with the word it fell apart and sin entered truly Lord that's been the downfall of men Through the Ages to try to inject something with the word remember we read the statement twice in the last couple Services how you try to inject something in the word to make yourself something Sarah tried the same thing to inject something to take in Hagar to bring the child but it fell through this is what Sarah was doing this is what the woman was doing they injected something in there she just couldn't wait she thought maybe God needed help there's this manufacturing of something now you realize the continuity with a lot of the statements we've been reading about manufacturing something so that's kind of a constant them that I hope is uh connecting these things together he said it's always been that way father you can gather from this that he's praying we just want your word and that alone nothing added to it or taken from it just the way it is and you are this word we don't want to project reasons we don't want to reason with it we don't to inject something in it to make ourselves something we just want your word and that alone we want the word only we want the word alone nothing added to it or taken from it we want the word it's your safety zone and when we get impatience we always want to add an addition we want to remodel the house we oh if we can just do this might improve the value the curb appe pill just do this doesn't say it's wrong just do this but just stay with the word now turn to Galatians 4: 21-31 read through this uh there's a lot of stopping we could do there's a lot of emphasizing that we could do but I think that just reading this read it it's in the seed is not air with the shook or the seed shall not be air with the shook I think those few times that brother brand preaches on this I know two in particular right now off hand this theme of the Bond woman ishmail and Isaac and Isaac being a type of Christ and we're talking about the subject of Liberty impatient Liberty I'm free I'm a Christian I'm a Believer but we begin to get impatient and that becomes bondage we lose our Liberty and we use our freedom to choose to be in bondage because you're free I I can do whatever I want in other words I can join myself to this Harlot I can join myself to this idea I can join myself to this theology this ideology I can continue to support something that is contrary to the word you're free to do that so Paul when we read in Galatians we find and I'm realizing now I just I think I left out some um critical scriptures here Paul is telling them that in this entire book how they've gone back into bondage again that they had been made free and now you've gone back into bondage and it all had to do with outward works of the Flesh and and circumcision and all these traditions of men that Christ had made them free and they're going right back into bondage again and he says this in verse 21 tell me ye that desire to be under the law do you not hear the law for it is written written that Abraham had two sons the one by a bondade and the other by a free woman and he who was of the Bond woman was born after the flesh now that's a key characteristic fleshly sensual uh uh you know the the the feeling of things but he of the free woman was by promise which things are an allegory for these are the two covenants the one from Mount sini which G which gendereth to bondage which is Hagar so this Hagar the inject something to manufacture something this work of impatience genders bondage it's under the law it's you have to do it you ought to do it it's not where the spirit of the Lord actually is for this AAR is Mount Si in Arabia and answer to Jerusalem which now is and is in bondage with her children but Jerusalem which is above is free which is the mother of us all for it is re written Rejoice thou bear and that beest not break forth and cry thou that travail us not for the despite for the desolate hath many more children than she which hath a husband now we Brethren as Isaac was are the children of promise now think about the ishmail think about the canes think about that seed that brother bam said you don't you have to do that there's the seed you have to do it there's the seed the the the injecting of something produces a nature notice what it does but as he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the spirit even so it is now are you listening you making application it's the impatient that begin to persecute the patient it's those that manufacture it's those that are sensual it's those that are getting worked up it's those that have gone in the way of Cain that begin to persecute those that are patient because he that is born after the flesh persecutes him that's born after the spirit even so it is now nevertheless what saith the scripture cast out the Bond woman and her son for the son of the Bond woman shall not be air with the son of the free woman so then brethren we are not children of the Bond woman but of the free Stand Fast therefore in the Liberty this is the opening of chapter 5 but we understand it because of the close of chapter four Stand Fast therefore in the Liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free and be not entangled again with the Yoke of bondage he will persecute he will squeeze he will Bluff he will intimidate he will bully he will do all sorts of things to try to move you from your Liberty but stand fast in the Liberty where Christ has made you free and be not entangled again with the Yoke of bondage there's this idea that gendereth bondage if it gendereth bondage there's a seed there's a covenant that has a seed of discrepancy there's a covenant that has a seed of you have to do this there's a covenant of trying to manufacture something there's a covenant of a false impersonation there's a covenant of a false Vine there's a covenant of death [Music] but then there's a covenant of life which is Liberty Stand Fast in the Liberty where with Christ hath made us free amen that's what I want in Luke chap 1: 31-35 now we realize that under the third pole there's going to be a squeeze there's going to be a persecution it's going to come from pretty close within and we see this example in Scripture that it's the twin that persecutes the real wow it's the so close it's the make believer it's it's it's that that one that falls for the supernatural offer it's the one who here is born after the flesh born after Hagar born after Mount siai born after the the builds his house upon the sand all the different images we could come in with that that idea that begins to be perpetuated they are the ones that will persecute the True Believer Luke chapter 1 vers we just do 30 3 I think it is to 35 I want start with did I not give Luke Chapter the yeah let's just go back to Galatians if that if it's not there let's just we'll come back to that here in a moment says in Luke chapter 1: 33 and behold Thou shalt conceive now this is this I want to give this example as I close I'll be closing here in just a minute or or several I mean I I'll be able to do it it'll be some minute or some second that I do it I guess I'm not one that usually tres to justify the uh I'm closing phrase um it's just a Trope that I just fell for I apologize but I want to use with uh the example of Mary as a contrast to the woman in the garden and Hagar or Sarah and even the church that brother B talks about on the day of Pentecost eventually the Antichrist Spirit was able to move her away from the truth so Christ would have come to that church but before he could come to her he found that she had left left her first love so now Mary let's look at Mary cuz brother rown uses her as this example in spoken word is the Original Seed uh my son Elliot is listening to that sermon and I was like well you better better pack a lunch he's like man that's a that's a long one says and behold Thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and shall call his name Jesus and he shall be great and shall be called the son of the highest and the Lord shall give unto him the Throne of his father and he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever and his kingdom shall be no end and and then Mary said okay now Mary it knows this is something Supernatural she's she's kind of taken back by wow this is amazing and then notice her initial response how shall this be seeing I know not a man the instinct is to be very natural the instinct is to think that oh this is what's going to happen then it has to happen maybe as it did with Abraham after the flesh maybe it has to happen this way because this is the way that it's always happened so she's thinking well in order for this to happen maybe I need to do something and the angel answered and said unto her the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also that Holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called The Son of God God is saying in this declaration of the angel that it will be the holy ghost that does it you will not need to inject something into your womb you will not need a man to help you bring this to pass but I have made the promise I have chosen you and according to the time of life I will make this happen of my own brother bam says it this way if you could just think about this Instinct of hers knowing how that seed would have to comes forth in the natural brother Braham says in the spoken word is the original received the womb Eve received the wrong seed word now listen real close now we're going to drive this right down if the Lord willing she received the wrong word what did it do it was Satan's lie said she would be wise well she could belong to the big church well she be well thought of in the city why she'd be like the rest of the people sure that's exactly what Jehovah's bride believed that's exactly what Satan would have tried to said when the word come to Mary Now Eve Sarah the church all these women that doubted that got impatient got emotional tried to move things along he said but he try and said when the word come to Mary but she shook him away she said how can this be the angel said the Holy Ghost will overshadow you it's the word of God she said be it unto me according to Thy word that br brought the life there you are well do you know Satan said they'll all laugh at you that little Rosy cheek girl didn't pay any attention to that right up in Judea she went you know I'm going to have a baby are you listening before she felt anything because the word had already been set there that was all she didn't have to go through the prayer line the second time you know no no no sir no sir she believed it she didn't have any sign of life she never had no sign of pregnancy at all she never felt nothing everything had been just like it was but she went telling everybody I'm going to have a baby why God said so what is that the Royal Seed of Abraham Hallelujah that's where we've got to be as the Bride of Jesus Christ before we feel anything we don't have to go through a prayer line you don't have to go through it a second time you don't have to have a sign you don't have to have any sign of pregnancy just believe God Amen take him at his word amen verse 37 for with God nothing shall be impossible and that brings that brings her to attention with god with man it is impossible but with God nothing shall be impossible behold the handmade of the Lord beat unto me according to Thy word and that was enough I believe that the angel perhaps just speculated maybe he would have stayed with her until she could accept it according to his word so well let's just spit ball on this a little bit let's huddle let's talk about this because I'm I'm not sure how this is going to work but she just said you know what before I feel anything I don't need a sign I don't need anything to happen I'm going to take you at your word and the angel departed from her could you just put yourself in her shoes in a a culture where Society is religion itself the people are built around promises they're their life their discipline their their very cultural identity is is their religion it's their their church is their home their church is their this is the Jews and they have this promise that a messiah is going to come and there's some obscure prophecies in the Old Testament that the Jews didn't necessarily zero in on that a virgin would conceive and that this would apply to the Future Messiah but could you imagine her saying the angel Lord came to me and said I'm going to have a baby without being preg impregnated by a man and how wild and crazy that would be like you sorry that just doesn't work that way and that's what Satan is saying they'll they'll laugh at you they're going to laugh at you but she said be it unto me according to Thy word and someone could have said well the Bible said this would happen and the theologians said well that's not what that means she said but I know what my faith tells me I know what God's revealed to me and I know where I'm standing and instead of being trying to make it happen and sneak around and inject something to it and ruining the word of God she just said be it unto me according to thy word and the seed shall not be air with the Shu I'm going to use this statement to kind of just bring that clein that home and then I have one more quotation to read before we close he said the true seed come forth from Mary but it was not her seed it was the promise of God that she said behold the handmade of the Lord the carriers of Life were the women but now Mary the seed so much closer Hagar had to receive it in a perverted way Sarah doubting the thing brought it to just a natural seed sexual desire but Mary without any sex at all believed the word and the Word was made flesh remember how brother Bram said one of the Mysteries is to receive the Holy Ghost without sensation and the next part is the word doing what it said it would do and so it's the word doing what it ought to do the word that he's promised for the season that you're in the promise coming for the hour that you're living not the Pentecostal idea of injecting something and Performing something and doing something and trying to make it look a particular way but the Holy Ghost in This Hour you can receive the Holy Ghost without sensation and brother bam use that to connect it with the desires and the lust and the longings of the flesh there's the without sensation without the impatience without the Restless longing and desire in order you can have an experience that satisfies you don't have to have a litmus test did you shout did you cry did you make it a mess on your own listen if we just say well a bir's a mess you know what we can just make it real messy I remember oh some of you Ohio winds helped me out that guy in Cincinnati that preacher who not a message Preacher Man I wish I could remember his name he had a pretty big voice I he may I never mind I but I remember one time he was preaching and he said that that Legion that demon he was all messed up he was all messed up and he got all messed up he was just talking about being messed up so you know about 15 minutes later he was everybody's getting really excited dancing around he's like come on everybody get messed up in here I was like okay well they know exactly what they're talking about that that it is that sensation has to be tongues or it has to be shouting it has to be dancing and it has to be this it has to be that has to be the word that's what it has to be a a and if if someone right now uh the Holy Ghost struck them and they were paralyzed and they couldn't move and they just stood there in the presence of God who are we to say that's not God but if we say well the word of God says that they all fell down and if you're not falling down you're not in the word well okay well just show me show me in the word where it's you have to cuz I know you have to be born in the uh bornn again you must be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ there are certain things in there that you must do things that you ought do it's correct but we add to the word when we say you have to and we take away when we say you shouldn't because brother say there's nothing wrong with it Brothers come to your instruments please brother bandam writes this in the church age book there're the Philadelphian age after he made the statement about Abraham's patience he said God gives us exceeding great and precious promises he has promised to fulfill them he will but from the time we pray until the time we get the answer we must learn to receive patience into our souls for only in patience do we possess life may God help us to learn this lesson even as we know the people of this sixth age learned patience we read the history of the lives of these great Christians what a contrast we see between their lives and ours for they were so patient and quiet and today we are all but overcome in over impatience and haste brother B said time and time again we're the ones in a hurry God's not in a hurry be still and know that I am God they that wait upon the Lord we we're the ones that get in a hurry oh oh no this hasn't happened this hasn't happened I it's to even you know sometimes say well look at the where the message is it's going to be 2025 and it's been so many years since the messenger went off the scene and are we any better off and we've never taken a Rapture and this hasn't happened we've tried to do this and we've tried to do that and then so what do we try to do we try to do something else thinking that if we just shut the church doors and stay home maybe that'll do it or if we just start making church a little bit more excitable maybe that'll do it when whatever what we have to do is just stay with the word stay with the word I believe that God has promised us the supernatural I believe that God has set things in his church that we should be at liberty for the Holy Ghost to exercise and to use I believe that God is confirming himself amongst us with signs and wonders but our emphasis has to be right and our our our ought to ought it should must be correct yes amen that's right otherwise we'll make the mistake of being tempted to tempt God we'll get impatient then we'll get jealous then we'll get murderous we'll get thorns in our flesh we'll be unwilling uh to just follow the will of God for our lives we'll be unwilling to get along and it'll be one unhappy mess I wish I could remember that preacher's name don't get messed up
