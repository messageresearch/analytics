[0:00] And we're going to start. We're going to
[0:01] take a couple lengthy
[0:03] readings to try I want to a thought came
[0:07] to me here a month or so ago and was
[0:11] listening to something and the thought
[0:13] is what if could it
[0:16] be? I know you're like, "What? That
[0:18] don't sound like a message title." Well,
[0:20] that's all right. We'll see what God has
[0:23] for us and uh and you'll see as we get
[0:25] going what we're talking about here.
[0:29] Luke 24 starting at verse 13. Familiar
[0:34] scriptures. And behold, two of them went
[0:36] to the same day to a village called
[0:39] Emmas, which was from Jerusalem about
[0:42] three score furlongs. And they talked
[0:44] together of all the things which they
[0:46] had happened. And it came to pass that
[0:48] while they communed
[0:50] together, and reason, Jesus himself drew
[0:54] near and went with him. But their eyes
[0:57] were holden that they should not know
[0:59] him. And he said unto them, "What manner
[1:02] of communications are these that you
[1:03] have one to another as you walk and are
[1:07] sad?" And one of them whose name was
[1:09] Cleopus answering said unto him, "Art
[1:11] thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and
[1:14] hast not known the things which are come
[1:16] to pass there in these days?" And he
[1:19] said unto them, "What things?" And they
[1:20] said unto him concerning Jesus of
[1:23] Nazareth. Now think about what they're
[1:25] as we read what they're saying because
[1:27] now they're telling Jesus of the
[1:31] prophecies concerning
[1:34] himself. And yet they are blind to the
[1:37] fulfillment of the prophecy that they
[1:40] are talking about. And he said unto them
[1:43] what things? And they said unto him
[1:44] concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was
[1:46] a prophet mighty in deed and word before
[1:48] God and all the people, and how the
[1:51] chief priests and our rulers delivered
[1:53] him to be condemned to death, and have
[1:56] crucified him. But we trusted that had
[1:58] been he which should have redeemed
[2:01] Israel. And besides all this, today is
[2:03] the third day since these things were
[2:05] done. Yay. And certain women also of our
[2:08] company made us astonished which were
[2:10] early at the sele. And when they found
[2:12] not his body, they came, saying that
[2:15] they had also seen a vision of angels,
[2:18] which said that he was alive. And
[2:20] certain of them which were with us went
[2:22] to the suppleure, and found it, even as
[2:25] the women had said, but they but him
[2:28] they saw not. Then said he unto them,
[2:32] "Oh fools, and slow of heart to believe
[2:35] all that the prophets have spoken. Ought
[2:38] not Christ to have suffered these things
[2:41] and to enter into his glory? And
[2:44] beginning at Moses and all the prophets,
[2:46] he expounded unto them in all the
[2:48] scriptures the things concerning
[2:51] himself. Father, as we come before you
[2:54] truly, Lord,
[2:55] we just pray that you have accepted our
[2:58] praise and the songs, Father, and the
[3:00] worship as we come here to give back to
[3:03] you, Father, what little we can for the
[3:05] things that you've done for us. And we
[3:07] just pray now, Father, that you would
[3:08] come break the word of life to us.
[3:11] Father, do your part in this service.
[3:13] Father, speak to us. Speak to our
[3:14] hearts. You know what each person has
[3:17] need of and the way that they can
[3:20] receive. We just pray, Father, that you
[3:22] would just come down. Move the speaker
[3:24] aside. Move the hearers aside, Father,
[3:27] and just take control. We love you. We
[3:30] appreciate you. And we ask it in Jesus'
[3:32] name. Amen. So, if you been you can be
[3:36] seated. And if you notice and we know
[3:39] these things that as they were walking
[3:41] along and they were we're going to turn
[3:43] to Matthew 17 if you would. As they were
[3:46] walking
[3:48] along, they missed
[3:51] the whole message.
[3:53] They were believers for three and a half
[3:56] years, probably longer than that because
[3:59] they believe they were Jews. They
[4:01] believe what was in their
[4:05] Bible. They they could tell you the
[4:07] prophecies, but yet now the prophecies
[4:10] are
[4:11] fulfilled and they missed it. And what
[4:14] did Jesus do? He went back through,
[4:17] starting at Moses, he went back through
[4:20] the prophecies to explain to them who he
[4:24] was. God bless you, Brother Ellas.
[4:30] That was my thought. What if could it
[4:33] be? Could we have been around this so
[4:35] long and have
[4:37] missed what the message was all
[4:41] about? Okay. Now, let's turn to Matthew
[4:44] chapter
[4:48] 17 and we'll read another familiar one.
[4:51] They should be familiar. If you're
[4:53] saying, "Man, I never read that before."
[4:56] You need to be reading your
[4:58] Bible. Amen. You need to be listening to
[5:01] the message and hearing the
[5:03] voice, right? We know these things. Are
[5:06] we all believers? Is there any
[5:09] um uh
[5:12] visitors? All right. You know, because
[5:14] brother Bram said when you're preaching
[5:16] to believers, you can preach all night.
[5:21] Oh, yeah. That I'm pretty sure he said
[5:23] that. I'm getting old, but I'm pretty
[5:25] sure he said that I like to use these uh
[5:29] little cough drops and you know they
[5:32] take a little while to uh dissolve and
[5:34] then you know when to quit and I've been
[5:36] to Africa quite a few times, lots of
[5:39] times actually and I would do this and
[5:42] they'd always, man, why are you quitting
[5:43] already? Why are you quitting?
[5:46] and came back for the evening service
[5:49] and there was like a whole pile sitting
[5:51] on the
[5:53] desk because but you know in Africa they
[5:56] don't they don't have anything. They
[6:00] have to depend on the Lord. I go to
[6:01] Malawi a lot and at one time they had
[6:04] 75%
[6:06] unemployment. So if it wasn't for you
[6:08] know for God they depend on him a lot.
[6:12] But that's why things happen in Africa
[6:15] because they can they know how to depend
[6:17] on God. Okay, let's keep going. Matthew
[6:21] 17 and we're going to start reading at
[6:24] verse one. And after six days, Jesus
[6:28] taketh Peter, James, and John his
[6:30] brother, and bringeth them up into a
[6:32] high mountain, and was transfigured
[6:35] before them, and his face did shine as
[6:37] the sun, and his raignment was as white
[6:40] as light. And behold, there appear
[6:43] appeared unto him Moses and Elias
[6:45] talking with him. Then answered Peter,
[6:47] and said unto Jesus, Lord, it is good
[6:49] for us to be here. If thou wilt, let us
[6:52] make here three tabernacles, one for
[6:54] thee, one for Moses, one for Elias.
[6:57] While he yet spake, behold, a bright
[6:59] cloud overshadowed them. Behold, a voice
[7:02] out of the cloud, which said, "This is
[7:03] my beloved son in whom I am well
[7:05] pleased. Hear ye him." And when he had
[7:09] the disciples heard it, they fell on
[7:11] their face and were sore afraid. And
[7:13] Jesus came and touched him and said,
[7:15] "Arise, be not afraid." And when they
[7:17] had lifted up their eyes, they saw saw
[7:20] no man save Jesus only. And as they came
[7:23] down from the mountain, Jesus charged
[7:25] them, saying, "Tell the vision to no man
[7:28] till the Son of Man be risen again from
[7:29] the dead." And his disciples asked him,
[7:32] saying, Why then say the scribes that
[7:36] Elias must first come? And Jesus
[7:40] answered and said unto them, Elias truly
[7:43] shall first come and restore all things.
[7:46] But I say unto you, you missed
[7:48] it. Elias has already come. And they
[7:52] knew him not, but have done unto him
[7:54] whatsoever they listed. Likewise shall
[7:57] also the Son of Man suffer them. Then
[8:00] they understood he spake of them of John
[8:02] the
[8:04] Baptist. So here it was
[8:06] again. They knew the scriptures. We know
[8:10] the message and the message was
[8:12] fulfilled before them. They missed it,
[8:16] right? Because now they see Jesus coming
[8:18] in his glory and everything. They're
[8:20] like, "Hold on, hold on. We know what
[8:22] the message says." And Elias is supposed
[8:25] to come back before all this happens.
[8:30] Yeah. And Jesus. Yeah. But you guys
[8:32] missed it. What? We missed it.
[8:35] Ah, I see. What if I wonder if it could
[8:37] be that same
[8:39] way? Because I think a lot of times, and
[8:42] I'll show you here in a second, just
[8:44] like this. They were looking when they
[8:48] seen that, they were looking at
[8:51] men, right? Oh, let's lift up the
[8:54] prophets. Oh, there's Moses. We're going
[8:57] to build an altar. There's we're going
[8:59] to build these
[9:02] altars. And that was happening in our
[9:10] day. I'll show you here in just a
[9:12] second. I got to get to it first. I was
[9:14] looking for a picture of the cloud, but
[9:16] I didn't see one back there. So, I have
[9:18] to use my small one.
[9:20] So for from
[9:24] 1963 when brother Random stood in the
[9:27] pyramid with all the angels coming
[9:31] down and do you ever notice that it
[9:35] wasn't until the first I can find and
[9:38] I've looked and I've looked and I've
[9:40] looked. It wasn't until
[9:43] 1965. Brother Brandham was always
[9:46] pointing, "Oh, look at the angels. Oh,
[9:48] look at this and this is happening and
[9:50] all those angels came down and I was
[9:52] standing in front of him.
[9:56] Not down n the prophet didn't catch it.
[10:00] 1965 finally brother Random said the
[10:03] spirit came to him and said turn it
[10:05] right. What?
[10:07] What do you mean turn it
[10:09] right? Am I not looking at this
[10:12] right? Turn it to the right. And when he
[10:18] did, now the message was coming into
[10:23] view just like here. But they missed it.
[10:26] Why? Finally, they were looking and all
[10:28] of a sudden what? Everything disappeared
[10:31] except for Christ. Why? Because the
[10:35] message is Christ. Amen. You
[10:39] see what if we could it be that we've
[10:42] missed the very purpose of the
[10:48] message. Pretty interesting when you
[10:50] start thinking about it. So here and
[10:53] then we know brother Brandham talked
[10:55] about and preached on the subject many
[10:58] times modern events made clear by
[11:00] prophecy.
[11:02] But I'm thinking now as we look because
[11:05] we know, but our prophecies have been
[11:09] made clear by modern events.
[11:14] Have we missed some things and we don't?
[11:16] You'll see as we get going as
[11:20] we looking for something that has
[11:22] already happened because it I've showed
[11:24] you a couple places in the
[11:26] Bible that they were message believers.
[11:29] what we would call message believers and
[11:32] they missed the very message that they
[11:35] were claiming to believe.
[11:38] Okay. So, second Peter 1:18:19. I'm
[11:41] going to read just read this to
[11:44] you. And this is Peter given his
[11:48] testimony. And this voice which came
[11:50] from heaven, we heard when we were with
[11:53] him in the holy mount. But we also have
[11:56] a more sure word of prophecy.
[12:00] Where unto you do well that take heed as
[12:02] unto a light that shineth in a dark
[12:04] place until the day dawn and the day st
[12:08] star star arise in your hearts. So now
[12:11] Peter here was talking about mount
[12:14] transfiguration but I'm talking about
[12:16] our modern prophecy what was given to us
[12:20] and that word sure here means steadfast
[12:24] something that we know these things are
[12:26] the truth. We know the things that the
[12:29] prophet prophesied aren't are going to
[12:32] happen. They're they're steadfast. And
[12:35] dayar I I like that day means
[12:38] lightbringing or illumination. We've
[12:42] we've been illumin Have you been
[12:43] illuminated? Has your eyes been open to
[12:46] what God has done in this day? And not
[12:49] just done, but what God is doing? Right?
[12:52] Because we know for us, we
[12:55] have seven visions that the prophet had
[12:59] back when he started into the ministry,
[13:02] right? It was Mussolini, uh, Hitler, the
[13:04] three isms, um, science, the
[13:07] self-driving cars. I mean, man, they're
[13:10] all
[13:11] around, right? A woman's
[13:14] world. And then the last one
[13:18] was, well, then there was Romanism. And
[13:21] then the last one was what? America laid
[13:24] waste. Amen.
[13:28] Okay. Sorry, I'm a old school guy. I
[13:32] don't know how these guys get up here
[13:33] with their iPad stuff. That's
[13:36] Yeah. Okay. So, out of the message, a
[13:38] sign of his coming. Moses and his sign,
[13:42] God-given sign, scriptural sign. Do you
[13:44] believe Moses sign was scriptural? How
[13:46] did Moses know? How did Moses know it
[13:49] was God? When he went down there, he
[13:51] understood, being born a prophet, he had
[13:54] the word of the Lord, he knowed. So, he
[13:57] goes down there to deliver Israel and he
[14:00] found out he was out of date. The Now,
[14:03] don't think, well, we're not prophets
[14:04] because that's not what the prophet said
[14:07] in the church age book. Do you got your
[14:09] church age book? He said, "It's going to
[14:10] take a people with prophetic
[14:15] insight to see what God is doing in our
[14:18] days." See, the people didn't want him.
[14:21] A prophet can never deliver his message
[14:24] unless the people want to hear it. So,
[14:26] God just called his prophet in the
[14:28] wilderness. Sure. Took him out there and
[14:30] let the people suffer a little longer
[14:33] till they was ready. Moses was ready.
[14:38] God was ready, but the people
[14:42] wasn't. Ain't that something? You see,
[14:45] it happens. Just like brother Brandham
[14:47] said when his vision of the second bear,
[14:50] he said God fulfilled his part, but he
[14:52] wasn't ready, so he missed it.
[14:57] Man, we need to be ready.
[15:00] We need to be ready. He said they stayed
[15:04] 40 years
[15:07] longer because they wasn't ready. That's
[15:10] exactly right. And I'm one as I read the
[15:14] message in many, many places, Brother
[15:17] Brandham said the rapture should have
[15:19] already taken
[15:22] place. But are we in the same place?
[15:26] Because not that we've rejected
[15:29] Moses, but what we're not seeing the
[15:33] prophecy being
[15:35] fulfilled in order to go. Now, I know
[15:38] some people like, well, you know, the
[15:39] rap the rapture is a process and it's
[15:41] this the shout and I'm sorry when I hear
[15:44] people preach on the rapture, my mind
[15:46] goes to that c that moment, that change
[15:50] of our body, that catching away when
[15:53] we're going to see him.
[15:55] That's what I'm looking for.
[15:58] And so I believe this is me by reading
[16:01] these things that we should have. I want
[16:03] to get out of here. I don't want to be
[16:06] here another millennium or another
[16:08] century. It, you know, it's time to go.
[16:12] So now in the church age book, Brother
[16:13] Brham's talking about the time is at
[16:15] hand. The time was not at hand
[16:17] previously in the wisdom and economy of
[16:20] God. This mighty revelation though fully
[16:23] known to God could not come forth
[16:25] hither. Thus we immediately learn a
[16:29] principle the revelation of God. You
[16:32] know, and I know people say, well, you
[16:33] know, God knows every Yeah, God knows
[16:35] everything, but it doesn't mean that
[16:38] that wasn't God. When God sent Moses,
[16:41] that was their time, but God knew the
[16:43] people were rejected, but God still has
[16:46] to do and stay, we'd say, in his
[16:49] timeline. Even though God isn't in
[16:51] timeline in time, but he has sequences
[16:55] that he needs to fulfill.
[16:59] Okay? So the revelation of God for each
[17:02] age can come in that age
[17:05] only and at a specific
[17:08] time. Look at the history of Israel. The
[17:11] revelation of God to Moses only came at
[17:15] a specific time of history. and even
[17:19] more
[17:20] specifically. So now he goes from a
[17:22] specific time to something that's now he
[17:26] says it's even more specific than the
[17:28] specific time that God was sending Moses
[17:31] there. He said even more specifically it
[17:35] came as the people cried unto God. Jesus
[17:40] himself came at the fullness of time
[17:43] being the complete revelation of the
[17:46] Godhead.
[17:48] I wonder if we're crying about the wrong
[17:52] things and not crying about God
[17:57] come right, you know, and don't get me
[18:00] wrong and I know we go through a lot of
[18:04] things and we have a lot of problems
[18:07] just like the children of Israel did
[18:09] with the task maskers and being beat and
[18:12] stuff. But one day they
[18:14] realized calling or trying to relieve
[18:17] that pressure wasn't going to happen
[18:21] until God came and delivered them.
[18:27] You see, are we looking at it the wrong
[18:30] way? Are is our thoughts not going to
[18:35] what we really need to be go
[18:39] doing? Right? Because we have you know
[18:42] you we have to suffer brothers and
[18:44] sisters.
[18:45] Why? Because we know we are to rule and
[18:48] reign on the other
[18:50] side. But power what without character
[18:53] is satanic. So the only way you can get
[18:56] charact what learned obedience by the
[18:59] things
[19:02] not by the flowery bed of ease but by
[19:05] the things that he suffered.
[19:08] So we have to suffer. we're going to
[19:10] suffer. So, we need to learn a
[19:13] principle. I think that one, God has a
[19:15] part.
[19:17] But then two, we also have a part,
[19:21] right? And we know that because the
[19:22] prophet told us that we have a part. God
[19:25] needs to fulfill his part.
[19:28] How? By us. My feet, my hands, my lips,
[19:32] my
[19:33] ears. That's what he's going to use to
[19:36] fulfill his part. Okay.
[19:39] I'll get down into how I got this
[19:41] thought and was listening to these
[19:43] things. He says, 'Don't you never fear
[19:45] communism? Communism is a godless move.
[19:48] But you hear some of these preachers
[19:51] stand in the pullpit condemning
[19:53] communism. Communism. I don't believe in
[19:56] it either, but and tell their church,
[19:58] "Oh, we're going to be swallowed up. The
[19:59] whole world is going to become
[20:01] communist." That's contrary to God's
[20:03] word. There's no place in the Bible for
[20:06] that. But the Bible says that the
[20:08] Romanism, the Catholic Church will
[20:11] swallow the world. Take Daniel and find
[20:14] out the head of gold, King
[20:15] Nebuchadnezzar, Babylon kingdom, Mes and
[20:17] Persians succeeded them, the Grecian
[20:19] Empire, and then Rome went to the end.
[20:21] The 10 toes run into every nation.
[20:24] There's an iron curtain, there's a
[20:25] bamboo curtain, there's a purple
[20:27] curtain, but don't you fear the rest of
[20:29] them, but watch the purple
[20:33] curtain. Now listen to what he says
[20:37] here. She, in other words,
[20:40] Rome is sitting right here on the throne
[20:46] today in this country.
[20:53] Huh? But I
[20:58] thought I mean, wait for a moment.
[21:04] She, the Catholic
[21:07] Church, he said, is on the throne today.
[21:10] And that quote was
[21:14] 1962. You see, what if, brothers and
[21:17] sisters, could it
[21:19] be? But every time we have an election
[21:22] in
[21:23] America,
[21:24] believers are looking for a woman
[21:27] wearing a purple outfit to be sworn in
[21:31] as president.
[21:34] But he just
[21:37] said
[21:38] she is
[21:41] already on the
[21:45] throne. What
[21:46] if it's already been fulfilled? Could it
[21:50] be
[21:51] we've like those on the road to
[21:54] Emmas and haven't caught the prophecies
[21:58] that were fulfilled by modern
[22:02] events? You see,
[22:04] because brother Brandham didn't live in
[22:08] the same realm as
[22:10] us, right? He was like John. He what?
[22:14] Lived in the past. He lived in the
[22:16] present. and he lived in the future.
[22:19] You know, I don't know and hopefully
[22:20] it's all right to say it here, but uh if
[22:23] you've ever listened to brother Biscll's
[22:26] testimony and he talks about when he him
[22:28] and brother Brandham were a by
[22:31] themselves talking in
[22:34] 1961, brother Brisco says, brother
[22:36] Brandham asked him, he said, "Brother
[22:39] Eddie, have you heard my message I
[22:43] preached on false anointed ones?
[22:48] Well, that wasn't preached till like
[22:50] what, 1965?
[22:52] But in
[22:54] 1961, he's already seen himself as
[22:57] preaching that
[23:00] message. I know you're thinking, well,
[23:02] you know, but brother Brown said this
[23:05] and see what if? That's the question.
[23:09] What if? Could it be that we keep
[23:12] looking for something that has already
[23:15] happened and so we're missing the whole
[23:18] uh prophecies being fulfilled and seeing
[23:21] where we're at and so we get caught up
[23:24] into the daily things of life when we
[23:27] should be so far past that.
[23:30] So Times magazine article back in uh
[23:35] concerning JFK when he was
[23:37] president. I thought this was pretty
[23:40] cool. The the the um uh the name of the
[23:43] article was the presidency the backdoor
[23:47] no longer. And so the article goes on to
[23:50] say even after we have seen it, the act
[23:55] of bringing a pope in the front door of
[23:58] the White House, just like he was an
[24:00] Arab with oil or state chairman with
[24:03] delegates, it's nothing short of a
[24:06] miracle.
[24:09] Wow. The Pope walked right in the front
[24:11] door and took over and we missed it.
[24:15] We're still looking for the woman in
[24:19] purple. You see this? Then, so Brother
[24:22] Bram says, "Then in the sixth vision,
[24:24] there arose up." Now, listen to how he
[24:26] says this. "Then in the sixth vision,
[24:29] there rose up in America a most
[24:31] beautiful but cruel woman. She held the
[24:35] people in her complete power. I believe
[24:38] that this was the rise of the Roman
[24:41] Catholic Church, though I knew it could
[24:44] possibly be a vision of some woman
[24:47] rising in great power in America due to
[24:50] the popular vote by women. But see, he
[24:53] says he believed it's the Roman Catholic
[24:56] Church. And here we can see by modern
[25:00] events they walked in the front door and
[25:02] took
[25:05] over. So some you like statistics
[25:09] they're pretty cool. So some government
[25:12] statistics here. So the total number of
[25:15] Catholics in Congress increased by two
[25:18] members from 148 in the last Congress to
[25:23] 150 in the new one. The the percentage
[25:27] increased slightly from 27 to
[25:32] 28.2%. Catholics remain the largest
[25:35] Christian denomination represented in
[25:39] Congress. Yeah.
[25:42] Wow. So, who's in
[25:45] control? According to Pew's numbers, 126
[25:49] members of the House, 24 senators are
[25:52] Catholic. The majority of Catholics in
[25:55] both chambers are are Democrats. 70 in
[25:58] the House, 13 in the Senate. There are
[26:00] 56 Catholic Republicans in the House and
[26:03] 11 in the Senate. So they go on to say
[26:06] that the uh the largest representation
[26:10] of religion is the Catholic Church in
[26:13] our
[26:14] government right now. What are we
[26:16] waiting for?
[26:19] There are
[26:21] 459 incumbent members of Congress who
[26:25] are returning with 129 of them belonging
[26:29] to the Catholic Church, which accounts
[26:32] for
[26:33] 28%. There are 73 new members of
[26:36] Congress, 21 of them are Catholic, which
[26:39] accounts for 28% of the freshmen. And
[26:43] did you know that a more than onethird
[26:46] of Trump's cabinet are Catholic?
[26:51] I
[26:52] mean, what if that vision portion's
[26:55] already fulfilled? Could it be that
[26:58] we've missed
[27:00] it? This one is
[27:03] really This is pretty cool. are not
[27:06] pretty cool. But so did you know, and I
[27:09] didn't know either, that during Trump's
[27:11] first
[27:12] term, the first time in history, a
[27:15] Catholic mass was performed in the White
[27:19] House? I mean, who's in control
[27:23] besides
[27:24] God? Now, this is something also. Did
[27:28] you know that in the Supreme
[27:31] Court that six of the nine current
[27:34] justices are
[27:36] Catholic? That's the most
[27:38] ever. Who's in
[27:41] control? Who rose to control in
[27:45] America? So Kennedy and
[27:47] Biden, they were have been the only
[27:50] Catholic presidents. So, we just had a
[27:54] Catholic President Biden and now the
[27:57] last trump is
[28:00] sounding. And so if you look in the
[28:02] Bibles as you go in the Bible as you go
[28:05] through and we call them in our day and
[28:08] time or language superpower nations
[28:12] which at the moment we're the only ones
[28:14] left but the superpower nations like
[28:17] Egypt, Babylon, all these ones coming up
[28:20] they had one thing in common and that is
[28:23] they always are involved with
[28:26] Israel. And so America being the last,
[28:30] think about it for a minute. America
[28:32] being the last
[28:34] superpower, what happens is they become
[28:38] so
[28:39] powerful that they become a law unto
[28:42] themselves, right? What they get a uh a
[28:46] feeling of
[28:48] invincibility. I mean, we get that way.
[28:50] We're from America. Nobody can, you
[28:53] know, we'll we'll take over if we have
[28:55] to.
[28:57] See, it kind of trickles down, don't
[29:00] it?
[29:01] So, think about it for a moment. Like
[29:05] Trump getting out there with not talking
[29:07] politics, but trying to bring through
[29:10] modern events, showing the prophecies
[29:13] that we're at. But so, Trump puts out
[29:15] there all of these uh he's going to redo
[29:18] the tariffs and and all of that. And so,
[29:21] what happened? Everybody at first goes,
[29:23] "What? Oh, we can't do that." But you
[29:26] know there up to what almost a hundred
[29:28] nations
[29:30] now have called Trump to say
[29:35] okay let's do something
[29:38] here. Why? Because they know as being
[29:42] the only
[29:44] superpower. Because what happens when
[29:46] you get to that
[29:47] status you can decree whatever you want
[29:51] to decree. Why? because nobody else is
[29:54] strong
[29:57] enough to make you back
[30:00] up. Can we read something else here?
[30:02] Let's just turn for a moment to Daniel
[30:04] chapter 8.
[30:16] and we'll read uh start at verse
[30:20] 23 and we'll read a couple verses here.
[30:25] So, and in the latter times of their
[30:27] kingdom, when the transgressors are come
[30:29] to the full, a king of fierce
[30:31] countenance and understanding, dark
[30:33] sentences shall stand up, and his power
[30:36] shall be mighty, but not by his own
[30:38] power. And he shall destroy wonderfully,
[30:41] and shall prosper and practice, and
[30:43] shall destroy the mighty and the holy
[30:45] people. And through his policy also he
[30:49] shall cause craft to prosper in his hand
[30:52] and he shall magnify himself in his
[30:54] heart and by peace shall destroy many.
[30:57] He shall also stand up against the
[30:59] prince of princes but he shall be broken
[31:02] without a hand. So what is craft? What
[31:05] is Daniel talking
[31:06] about?
[31:08] Manufacturing. What do you think all of
[31:10] this is all about?
[31:12] Manufacturing. What is it going to do?
[31:14] So, I think it's going to bring this all
[31:16] up and start causing
[31:20] manufacturing to come more than what it
[31:23] is now. People will start just like it
[31:26] says here through peace he's going to
[31:28] destroy. You could hear it even I don't
[31:31] know about here but believers before the
[31:33] election. Oh, if Trump gets in the
[31:35] office there we'll have peace and okay.
[31:40] Are you not catching what you're talking
[31:43] about?
[31:45] Why? Because they see some great
[31:47] economic things going to happen for
[31:49] America and everybody's going to get
[31:51] rich. Yet the Bible says when they say
[31:55] peace,
[31:57] peace, peace, what know that sudden
[32:00] destruction, right? And so the people,
[32:04] us, we need to not get caught up into
[32:07] that, but see what the fulfillment of
[32:12] prophecy and how close we really are.
[32:17] Uh, I want to go home. I don't know
[32:19] about the rest of you. It's time to go
[32:22] home and not just pass from this life
[32:24] waiting. I It's time for the rapture to
[32:27] get out of here.
[32:29] I mean, we shouldn't this. It's, you
[32:32] know, like brother Brandham said,
[32:33] horriblest nation there is, but I'm glad
[32:35] I live here.
[32:38] Because we still have some freedoms.
[32:41] But the problem is, what does it do? It
[32:43] I think it bl it gets we get scales over
[32:47] our eagle eyes because things are too
[32:51] easy. So, okay.
[32:55] So what is it then that we already did
[32:58] that about Trump and his magna make
[33:00] America great what does that do national
[33:04] pride and that's what all n you can see
[33:07] in a candidate oh we don't want to we're
[33:08] not going to be another state we're the
[33:10] okay but we as believers are not
[33:14] supposed to be caught up in that right
[33:16] because even though we're American per
[33:20] se but my church age book tells us what
[33:23] we are supposed to reflect the spirit of
[33:26] the world of our rebirth.
[33:30] And this is not our world. You know,
[33:32] like people always say, wanting to my
[33:35] favorite little thing is, you know, is
[33:37] there alien life out there?
[33:41] Is there aliens among us? Yep.
[33:44] Yep. I'm not from this world. I'm from a
[33:47] different world, right? I'm just passing
[33:50] through till I can get to the other
[33:53] side. There's been aliens here for
[33:54] thousands of
[33:57] years. Amen. So, we just don't want to
[33:59] get caught up into these things. So,
[34:03] think
[34:04] about
[34:06] man, think about these things here now.
[34:09] So, Brother Brandham says,
[34:11] "Look, it could happen at any
[34:14] time. There's not one thing left, but
[34:18] the coming of the Lord is at hand."
[34:21] Well, if there's not one thing
[34:25] left, why are we looking for a woman in
[34:28] purple? I'm just going back to this that
[34:31] she's all the Catholic Church has
[34:33] already took over. It's already
[34:35] done and we've missed it and we're not
[34:38] catching the fulfillment of the
[34:41] prophecies that we are supposed to be
[34:43] looking at. like the two on the road to
[34:46] Emmas. Jesus, you know, brother Bram
[34:48] says they were their disciples and he
[34:50] told them, "Yeah, they're going to take
[34:51] me. They're going to kill me, but guess
[34:53] what? In three days, I'll rise again."
[34:55] Oh, he's gone. What are we going to
[34:59] do? What are you going to do? Believe
[35:01] prophecy?
[35:03] Right. It it was fulfilled. I know. But
[35:07] you know it was the sister said that the
[35:10] tomb was empty and it was a sister and
[35:14] uh you know man I don't know if I should
[35:19] believe that or
[35:21] not right why because you know we're
[35:25] we're good Bible uh uh what would you
[35:28] say Bible not just believers but we like
[35:31] to do what the Bible says and the Bible
[35:33] tells us that every man's right in his
[35:35] own guys, right? Just ask
[35:38] them. Yeah, I know everything. Just ask
[35:42] me. You know,
[35:45] it's I wonder sometime our oldest son is
[35:49] handicapped and so he has to live with
[35:51] us forever.
[35:54] And but you ask him, I mean, he's
[35:58] handicapped. He's like a 12-year-old.
[36:00] And is there any 12-y olds in here? But
[36:02] you talk to him. He knows everything.
[36:05] Just ask
[36:06] him. He knows everything. And I always
[36:09] look
[36:10] like, "Sorry, Lord. I know I know
[36:12] everything, but is that how you look at
[36:14] me?" Like, uhhuh.
[36:16] Yeah.
[36:18] Okay. You know, because we got to get
[36:20] away from those things, right? What part
[36:23] of being a Christian is what? We
[36:26] self-sacrifice. We lower ourselves. We
[36:29] want God to come in and take over.
[36:31] Because remember, if there's any speck
[36:33] of us here, God can't deal with us. I
[36:37] mean, God can't use us fully the way
[36:40] that he wants to use us, right? Isn't
[36:43] that part of what brother Brandham said?
[36:44] What the uh mystery, you know, Christ,
[36:46] the mystery of God revealed the three
[36:48] things. God wants preeminence. That
[36:50] means he takes over
[36:54] for us,
[36:56] right? So when we go through trials and
[36:58] we go through things, we don't focus on
[37:00] those. We we have to know that God is
[37:04] doing it for a purpose.
[37:06] And to get away from all it's hard, but
[37:09] to get away from those things and focus
[37:12] on what we're really supposed to be
[37:14] doing. And what is that? Displaying the
[37:17] word to a lost
[37:21] generation. You know, I mean, where are
[37:23] we at? It probably be a good time to go
[37:25] back and listen to
[37:27] um souls that are in prison
[37:31] now. You know, you could hear it in
[37:33] brother Brandham's voice. He thought it
[37:35] was over that nobody else could be
[37:38] saved, right? Like, man, I he was like,
[37:41] I got
[37:43] children. Is Is this it? Or is this no
[37:46] more? Why? Because he was living in a
[37:49] different realm than us. He's looking
[37:51] out over here, seeing where we're at
[37:54] today. But we're just
[37:55] like, you know, I like to stay with the
[37:59] things. We're all like, "Hey, man, let's
[38:00] build a bigger church. We need some more
[38:02] chairs." Jesus was never like
[38:05] that, right? He looked around and man,
[38:08] he's seen 82 preachers. He's like, "Man,
[38:11] that's too
[38:12] many. That way too many preachers,
[38:15] right? Well, unless you eat the my
[38:18] flesh." What? Okay. Now hold on
[38:22] here. First you call yourself the son of
[38:25] God for and then you're and now you want
[38:27] us to do what? Yeah, we can't handle
[38:30] this, right? And they walked away. What
[38:34] was pretty amazing though. Only 12
[38:36] stayed and yet the devil was still
[38:37] there.
[38:42] He's here.
[38:44] Why? Because he wants our worship.
[38:48] He doesn't want their worship.
[38:50] He wants to be what? Worship like God.
[38:53] And we're the only ones who know how to
[38:55] worship God the way that God wants to be
[38:59] worshiped
[39:01] in spirit and truth. Not just the
[39:03] singing the songs and all that, but he
[39:05] wants truth. Our lives are supposed to
[39:08] show forth that truth because that's
[39:10] what he's looking for. Okay. So, okay.
[39:14] So, he says there's not one thing left.
[39:17] The coming of the Lord is at hand. We
[39:19] see in the hangers of Russia and all the
[39:21] different worlds bombs and things that
[39:23] would destroy the complete world in one
[39:26] snap. The world could not stand it. And
[39:28] before that takes place, the church is
[39:32] going to glory. Remember, before any
[39:35] rain ever fell, Noah was in the ark
[39:38] safely. Before any fire ever fell, the
[39:42] angel said to Lot, "Get thee hints. Get
[39:44] out cuz I can do
[39:46] nothing until you've gone hence. Got
[39:49] away from here. What about us? We need
[39:52] to get away from this world, the things
[39:53] of this world, the everything that has
[39:57] to do with this world before God can
[39:58] come in and destroy this world. It
[40:02] sounds cruel, but that's what it's going
[40:05] to happen,
[40:07] right? You know, it wouldn't do us no
[40:09] good to start praying, "Oh, please God,
[40:12] don't drop California in the ocean."
[40:16] Oh, but prayer changes things. H not
[40:20] everything, right? Why? Because it's
[40:22] been spoken. It's going to happen. If
[40:25] God speaks anything, it has to happen.
[40:31] Amen. So, brother Bram says here in
[40:33] recognizing your day and its message, he
[40:36] says, "As a minister of the
[40:39] gospel, I can't see one thing left but
[40:43] the going of the bride." But hold it. I
[40:46] thought the church, Roman church, was
[40:48] going to take
[40:50] over. There's not one thing left. That's
[40:53] what I
[40:54] believe. Let me finish reading this
[40:56] here. And the bride has to be taken away
[41:00] before they can recognize talking about
[41:03] the Jews. What's happened? They were
[41:05] bound, scattered. I mean, they were
[41:07] scattered, blinded, and now garner
[41:09] gathered. What's left? The bride has to
[41:13] be taken out of the
[41:15] way. So, does that mean we're in the way
[41:19] for all this to happen for them to
[41:22] recognize that they crucified him?
[41:29] Amen. I think the bride's in the way a
[41:32] little
[41:32] bit because we're not recognizing the
[41:36] prophecies that have been fulfilled and
[41:39] we're waiting for something to happen
[41:41] that's already
[41:43] happened. Amen. I that's the way I
[41:46] believe it. waiting for the going of the
[41:48] bride so their prophets of Revelation 11
[41:52] can call them to the feast of the
[41:54] trumpet to make them to recognize what
[41:57] they have done. Amen. So, we've been
[42:00] reading these things. Not one thing
[42:02] left. These things have happened yet
[42:05] we're still here. I think we need to
[42:07] get, like I said, get away from
[42:09] everything and start focusing. Lord
[42:11] Jesus, come quickly.
[42:13] It's It's time. Lord, get me out of the
[42:15] way. If I'm in the way, take it out of I
[42:18] it's time to
[42:20] go. Time to go. Okay. So in the third
[42:26] Exodus, so brother Brandham says that
[42:29] she re appears in Revelations 13 America
[42:32] number 13. And remember, it raised up
[42:36] like a lamb, freedom of religion. But
[42:38] then it received power from the beast,
[42:42] an image like it, and spoke with all
[42:45] authority and done the same rotten
[42:47] things that the beast did before him.
[42:50] Then tell me it's not prophesied of this
[42:53] nation. The Amorite condition is just
[42:55] about right because they've already been
[42:58] working in it. So what does the beast
[43:02] do? It makes superpowers out of the
[43:06] image. That's where we're
[43:09] at, right? Because we know that the
[43:11] prophet told us that what the uh um the
[43:15] pope can call if he wanted to, he could
[43:18] call Russia and Ukraine together and
[43:20] say, "Okay,
[43:23] stop." Oh, no, he could. Yes, he could
[43:25] because the prophet said he could. Don't
[43:28] you believe what the prophet said? Well,
[43:29] you know, but see, that's why we're
[43:32] still in the way because we're still
[43:34] trying to think with these canary
[43:37] brains instead of just only believe what
[43:40] the prophet has said and read how he
[43:43] said it. You see, because Rome controls
[43:48] the world and we've already read,
[43:51] brother Bram said she's already
[43:52] controlling this
[43:54] nation, right? Why do you think they're
[43:56] always consulting with the pope, the
[44:01] presidents? What happens behind closed
[44:04] doors that we don't
[44:06] know? So he says the iniquity wasn't
[44:09] fulfilled full yet of the Amorites. So
[44:13] they had to linger and wait before the
[44:16] Exodus. I mean, man, the things that are
[44:20] going on in this nation and it's not
[44:21] full yet every not even every year. It's
[44:24] like every month you're like it can't
[44:27] get any worse and it's
[44:29] something you're just like pull your
[44:32] hair out. You know, I remember when they
[44:35] you know like okay we're going to let
[44:37] the homosexuals marry one another and
[44:40] you know even preachers in the oh that's
[44:43] so yeah we know those things are it's
[44:45] against the word yes but these things
[44:47] have to happen. If these things don't
[44:50] happen the cup doesn't get full and we
[44:52] don't get out out of here.
[44:54] You know, so we know those things are
[44:57] wrong, but that's not supposed to be our
[44:59] focus. Our focus is Jesus come
[45:02] quickly. So he said, "So when the
[45:05] iniquity is filled, then there come a
[45:08] spiritual or natural exodus to lead the
[45:10] people to a natural land where a natural
[45:13] Amorite had once dwelt, called that
[45:15] their land. And so the iniquity of the
[45:17] Amorite denominations has called
[45:19] themselves the church. So long till
[45:22] their iniquity is about fulfilled. So
[45:26] there's coming an exodus where God will
[45:30] show who he
[45:35] is. You know how he's going to do that?
[45:38] Short quick work. That's what he said. A
[45:42] short quick work to show who he is. And
[45:45] then where the church
[45:47] itself, the bride of Jesus Christ will
[45:50] be exodused out into the land that's
[45:54] their promised in my father's house are
[45:56] many mansions in this place. You don't
[45:59] have to go there and fight like they
[46:00] did. It's already prepared. If this
[46:03] earthly tabernac dwelling is dissolved,
[46:06] we have one already waiting that where I
[46:09] am, you'll be there also. So, we're
[46:11] going from a spiritual exodus into a
[46:14] natural exodus
[46:16] because that that
[46:18] city more
[46:21] real than all of this and that is our
[46:26] inheritance is that
[46:28] city is to see our Lord. We should want
[46:32] to go there more and more. Amen. But
[46:36] what happened? They waited 40
[46:38] years. Why? Because they the people
[46:42] remember he said weren't
[46:43] ready man am I Lord am I not
[46:47] ready what am I missing here what what
[46:50] do I need to do right that we all need
[46:53] to be God am I in the am I the one
[46:55] causing it I pray that a lot God is in
[46:58] me I don't want you know I want to get
[47:00] on the other side and say well you know
[47:02] guys if for brother Ray you guys would
[47:04] have got out of here 10 years ago man
[47:06] you know and you're like brother Ray
[47:10] man, you know. So, where are
[47:13] we? Where are we? Okay, so brother
[47:16] Brandham says in the first seal, just
[47:18] going through some of this. And in doing
[47:21] this to get it, she'll compromise with
[47:23] the Jews and make a covenant. It's
[47:27] talking about Rome again. And when she
[47:28] makes the covenant with the Jews, now
[47:32] remember, I'm taking this from
[47:33] scripture. Where does this and makes
[47:36] this covenant? We notice Daniel 8:23 and
[47:39] 25. She will cause craft to prosper and
[47:43] craft is manufacturing in his hand. So
[47:47] that's why in my mind, why is
[47:51] Trump trying so hard to redo all these
[47:54] tariffs and bring all this manufactur?
[47:56] He says to bring it back here to make it
[47:59] prosper for
[48:01] us. Why? Because Rome is in control and
[48:07] they know what they're doing. You see,
[48:09] did we miss something? What if? Could it
[48:12] be? Have we been waiting for something
[48:16] that has past tense already
[48:20] happened? Just like the two on the road
[48:22] to
[48:23] Emmas, they were so caught up in what
[48:26] they thought was supposed to happen and
[48:28] it didn't happen. And now what's going
[48:30] on? We don't understand.
[48:33] Is that how humans? Well, that is how
[48:35] humans think and we need to get away
[48:38] from that, right? God, let your thoughts
[48:40] be my thoughts, right? Let the mind that
[48:42] was in Christ be in each of
[48:46] you. Amen. I know some preachers don't,
[48:49] you know, but what was the rest of that
[48:52] scripture? Let the mind of Christ be in
[48:55] you
[48:57] who this is a whole another thing but
[48:59] who being in the form of man thought it
[49:04] what not robbery to be
[49:07] what equal with
[49:12] God doesn't make us like
[49:15] Jesus but brother Bram said if we have a
[49:19] spoonful of the
[49:21] ocean we don't have the whole ocean. But
[49:24] what do we have? Everything that's in
[49:26] the ocean's in this small
[49:29] little
[49:31] spoonful, right? What do you
[49:33] think? The pillar of fire at the
[49:39] beginning, the
[49:41] baptism, what was it? That was that
[49:43] spoonful portion of God going into each
[49:48] believer. Why? Because she is him.
[49:53] We are what? Bone of his
[49:57] bone. Flesh of his
[50:00] flesh, right? That's why
[50:04] you our communion
[50:07] scripture. Do you think it's, you know,
[50:09] well, we know it's not the little round
[50:11] thing and that's not, you know, Christ
[50:14] and the Bible says that or the scripture
[50:17] says what many are
[50:19] sick and weak among us. Why? Because we
[50:23] don't discern the body of the Lord. Is
[50:25] it that little piece of
[50:29] thing? The body of the Lord. I'm looking
[50:31] at it. I like to do I go everybody.
[50:33] Everybody want to touch God. Oh yeah.
[50:35] Everybody raises their hand. Okay, give
[50:36] your hand up. Are you ready? Oh, put
[50:39] your hand up. Said if you want to touch
[50:41] God, this is all you have to
[50:45] do. That's why we are sick. That's why
[50:48] we don't get what we need. Because we
[50:51] don't recognize it's God sitting next to
[50:54] you. Why? Because you guys know each
[50:58] other. You go to church with each other.
[51:00] You fellowship with one another. Oh, and
[51:02] I seen brother Elias last week. Yeah. I
[51:05] don't know about that. So, we don't have
[51:08] no confidence in what the scripture is.
[51:12] Okay. Sorry. Let me keep going. So, did
[51:14] we miss
[51:16] something? Is it we've been waiting for
[51:18] something that has already happened? And
[51:21] it is that why when you listen to the
[51:24] especially after the word was open, how
[51:27] admit that the the prophet was that the
[51:31] coming was at any moment. And what was
[51:34] he always saying? He finally got away
[51:36] from that. But he was always saying,
[51:37] "Come out from among them. Get to your
[51:40] position. Get to where you are supposed
[51:42] to be." Why? Because he's coming any
[51:45] moment. He can be here now,
[51:49] right? Do you come to church thinking,
[51:50] "Man, we're going to rapture tonight.
[51:53] That preacher's going to preach like and
[51:54] we're gone."
[51:56] already like,
[51:58] man, it's Wednesday night and we got a
[52:01] new preacher and we never heard, you
[52:03] know, I hope he's not one of them
[52:04] African guys
[52:06] and you know 10:00 and I don't know what
[52:10] to do
[52:12] and right or you're like okay is this it
[52:15] is this moment are we are is something
[52:18] and we're out of here are you that it
[52:21] and I just can't get and
[52:25] right? You remember how it was
[52:28] when you first came in, man? You
[52:31] couldn't wait to get to church. You were
[52:32] on the front row, man. You're sitting
[52:34] there waiting, right? Now it's like, oh
[52:38] man, six o'clock comes early in the
[52:41] morning. What's this guy doing? I wish
[52:42] he'd hurry up and get out of
[52:45] here. You
[52:47] see? But we got to have that mindset,
[52:51] right? I remember when I for man I
[52:53] didn't even get out of bed in morning
[52:55] even use the restroom till I grabbed my
[52:57] Bible and read
[52:58] it. Why? Because that's you know you
[53:01] that excitement that you had and that
[53:04] you wanted. Why? Because you wanted to
[53:06] know him. You were uh thankful for what
[53:09] he did for you. Called you out of that
[53:11] world. Called you out of the sin and you
[53:14] know all he was doing was showing you
[53:15] who you
[53:16] are. All right. You know we go that's
[53:19] another one. But we get our minds so set
[53:22] on the way the world looks at things.
[53:24] You know, one of my pet peeves is how we
[53:28] have to get
[53:30] saved. You guys, did you know a believer
[53:33] doesn't have to get
[53:34] saved like they get
[53:38] saved, right? You we're that prodal son.
[53:42] He was
[53:44] always, right? He was always a son. And
[53:47] you don't think his dad knew exactly
[53:48] where he was
[53:50] at, but what had to happen? The Bible
[53:53] said he had to come to himself to
[53:57] recognize who he was to what? Come back
[54:01] to his father. And brother Brandham told
[54:04] us that. He said God know knew exactly
[54:07] where you were. He knew exactly how old
[54:10] you would be. He knew exactly what time
[54:12] it was that you would
[54:14] accept who you are. Amen. And then he
[54:18] showed himself to you and here you are.
[54:23] You see, because we know the prophet
[54:25] told us that a real believer could never
[54:28] be lost.
[54:29] You know, he said that right in the
[54:31] church age book. He said, "There's a
[54:33] group of people, I love this, that no
[54:36] matter what they do, their name can
[54:39] never be taken off the book of life."
[54:41] Oh, I know. But last week, I I don't
[54:44] care. I don't care. The prophet said,
[54:48] "It doesn't matter what you do." But you
[54:51] know how you know that you're one of
[54:52] them? Because when you do that, you're
[54:55] back repenting, saying, "God, I'm sorry.
[54:58] I should not have done that.
[55:00] forgive me.
[55:03] Right? And then next week, Satan,
[55:06] because I love to fish and so does
[55:08] Satan, he's out in the sea of
[55:14] forgetfulness. Oh. Oh. Oh, look. What?
[55:17] Brother Ray. Brother Ray,
[55:21] look. It's the truth. Know you think,
[55:23] "Well, that sounds goose." No, but it's
[55:25] the truth. Because Satan hasn't
[55:27] forgotten what he's made you do.
[55:30] Right? It's not you doing it, it's him
[55:32] doing it. But as long as he can think
[55:35] you did it, then here we are. Right? You
[55:38] know, that's why we were I like that
[55:41] song. We were singing the the peace of
[55:44] God cover us. But you know what's better
[55:45] than the peace of God was that wedding
[55:48] band of grace that he slipped on your
[55:50] finger before the prophet said before
[55:53] you left heaven, God slipped out.
[55:57] So, you're already there
[56:00] and so we're going back. So, how are you
[56:02] ever not going to be there? But Satan is
[56:06] so good at his job to get us to not
[56:10] believe that,
[56:12] right? You know, I like how brother
[56:14] Brandham said, "When the weakest of
[56:15] Christians gets on their knees to
[56:18] pray, who
[56:21] trembles?" Satan trembles. Why? Why do
[56:24] you ever think about why he trembles?
[56:26] trembles because most of the time it's
[56:28] on your knees when God reveals himself
[56:31] to you. And when God reveals himself to
[56:35] you, then it's solid. I can sit here and
[56:38] oh man, it's Oh yeah, brother Ray, that
[56:40] sounds really good. And oh, I believe
[56:41] that. But until God reveals it to you,
[56:44] Satan can take it away. But when God
[56:45] reveals it to you, Satan's powerless.
[56:50] Satan is powerless. That's why brother
[56:52] Bram always healing. When God reveals to
[56:54] you that God are when God reveals to you
[56:56] that he you are healed not he has healed
[56:59] you are healed past tense you are healed
[57:03] Satan can do nothing now he'll be there
[57:05] the next day and he'll be oh I was not
[57:08] no that's the very sign that you've
[57:13] received what you asked for and if you
[57:17] hold to that see if you have the
[57:20] revelation then you hold to that and
[57:22] Satan can't do your heal it. It's over.
[57:25] He has to leave. I don't know how we got
[57:27] on healing. Hopefully, you guys all look
[57:29] uh pretty healthy here today. So, but we
[57:33] got to remember that it's all
[57:36] ready. Okay. So, waiting for the cup of
[57:42] the of the iniquity of the you know,
[57:44] that's pretty good. I still got
[57:45] threequarters of this
[57:47] left. We can just keep on going.
[57:51] So, we're waiting for the cup of the
[57:53] iniquity of the Amorites to be
[57:55] fulfilled. And we
[57:58] are so we're looking also, you know, oh,
[58:00] one day they're going to um close our
[58:03] doors and we're not going to be able to
[58:04] worship and all that.
[58:08] But in West Cavina, West Los Angeles,
[58:12] the group there, they couldn't find a
[58:16] It's not that they couldn't find a
[58:18] church, but the laws they have in in in
[58:21] uh Los Angeles and the they were telling
[58:25] me that the um application and stuff
[58:27] that they have to fill out, they didn't
[58:29] qualify as a church.
[58:32] So, they weren't allowed to get their
[58:33] own church. So they had to rent a church
[58:36] from, you know, rent time from another
[58:39] church to have
[58:41] services. You see, those things are
[58:44] already there. And we're are we that's
[58:46] my whole question. Are we looking for
[58:48] something that's already done?
[58:50] And until, like you said, until we can
[58:52] get past that and figure these things
[58:55] out, we're still here
[58:58] because we're looking for something
[58:59] that's already done. Remember like
[59:02] brother random said, God cannot heal
[59:04] you.
[59:07] Why? He's already healed you. He said if
[59:11] Jesus was standing up in my suit in that
[59:14] he could not heal you.
[59:17] You see? So, but we're looking. So, I
[59:19] don't know why I'm getting on this.
[59:21] We're looking for, you know, when I pray
[59:24] for people, I don't go, "Oh, God, this
[59:28] poor brother, man, he's just suffering.
[59:30] I pray you come down and heal him. Can't
[59:33] do
[59:33] it. But I say, Lord God, this brother
[59:37] needs faith
[59:39] to believe what you have already done.
[59:43] Please increase his
[59:45] faith. You see, do we pray right? Are we
[59:50] praying wrong? You see, it's just a
[59:53] little checkup. Go home and check up,
[59:55] man. God, am I doing everything the way
[59:57] I need to be doing it? You know, because
[1:00:00] like you said, God's a gentleman. He's
[1:00:02] not going to force you. But if you ask
[1:00:05] him to show you, to lead you, he will.
[1:00:09] And that's what he wants to do. Okay,
[1:00:12] let me hurry up and finish up. We're
[1:00:15] getting thrown out here pretty
[1:00:18] soon. So now, the only way that iniquity
[1:00:22] can be filled up is God has to what?
[1:00:25] First speak the word through a prophet.
[1:00:28] We've had that, right? Then what has to
[1:00:31] happen? Then the word that the prophet
[1:00:34] spoke has to start being manifested in
[1:00:38] the people,
[1:00:41] right? Then what do they do when they
[1:00:43] start
[1:00:44] manifesting that word? Then they start
[1:00:48] on their journey to their inheritance.
[1:00:53] What is your
[1:00:54] inheritance? Every
[1:00:56] word that's in this Bible is our
[1:01:01] inheritance. Why? Because we are the
[1:01:03] bride. That it's for us. You see, we So
[1:01:08] everything that this Bible tells us,
[1:01:11] that's what we want. Our
[1:01:14] portion. So
[1:01:16] then but what happens is we get just
[1:01:20] like natural Israel brother Bram said is
[1:01:24] a type of spiritual pride and what
[1:01:26] happened to them? They came
[1:01:30] out came out of dark
[1:01:33] denominationalism. Israel came out of
[1:01:36] Egypt but what then they failed
[1:01:39] to I mean it just comes down to belief.
[1:01:42] They failed to believe Moses and they
[1:01:45] wandered in the wilderness for 40
[1:01:49] years. So now here God sent Moses. They
[1:01:53] didn't accept him. They were in Egypt
[1:01:55] for 40 years. Now they finally like,
[1:01:58] "Okay,
[1:01:59] God, take us out of here." So God took
[1:02:02] him out and they disbelieved God again
[1:02:04] in another 40 years.
[1:02:07] So from the time that God said the
[1:02:09] raptures to take place and the time they
[1:02:12] went into their inheritance was 80
[1:02:19] years. I hope we don't have another 15
[1:02:23] years because we didn't catch what the
[1:02:27] whole message was
[1:02:29] about, right? Because what we just going
[1:02:31] around and around the same
[1:02:34] mountain. But it was when the elected
[1:02:36] turned to cross
[1:02:39] Jordan. Oh man. Okay, this might be a
[1:02:42] little
[1:02:45] hard. But you know, those that initially
[1:02:50] came out under
[1:02:52] Moses, those that were elected to cross
[1:02:56] over had to leave them
[1:02:59] behind. That's right. They had to
[1:03:02] believe them. They had to leave them
[1:03:03] behind.
[1:03:06] Why?
[1:03:07] Because that's what God called for. You
[1:03:10] know, I always get that uh tell people
[1:03:13] and sometimes they're like, "What? What
[1:03:14] do you mean?" But you see those little
[1:03:16] things they have of Jericho and you see
[1:03:19] them, you know, marching around Jericho
[1:03:23] and bunch of old men with long white
[1:03:26] beards. Did you know that's not true?
[1:03:30] Did you know that uh Joshua's generals
[1:03:35] were only 18 and 20 years old?
[1:03:40] What? Because it was only that
[1:03:41] generation that was allowed to go in,
[1:03:44] right? The fourth, if you figure it out,
[1:03:46] it's the fourth
[1:03:47] generation. And where are we at in this
[1:03:50] message? It's time to cross over. Amen.
[1:03:57] And then what happens as we keep going,
[1:04:00] sorry, it's time to close. But now what
[1:04:03] happens then is the third
[1:04:07] pull has to be
[1:04:09] manifested. He said, "Well, sure, you
[1:04:12] know, it's been manifested." Brother
[1:04:13] Brandham spoke, you know, the squirrels
[1:04:15] and then he he he spoke about his wife
[1:04:18] and he did these five things. Brother
[1:04:19] said that was just to show us,
[1:04:23] just to show us what the third pull was.
[1:04:27] Now, we know this is another one. Sorry,
[1:04:29] there's a lot of things you can come
[1:04:31] into this,
[1:04:35] but I just want to get out of here.
[1:04:37] Sorry, I'm just getting old and I just
[1:04:39] more and more I think about it. It's
[1:04:40] time to get out of here. But we know
[1:04:43] also that he said, "Watch the squeeze.
[1:04:46] Watch that uh that resistance. And then
[1:04:50] you'll really see the third pull.
[1:04:54] Why? Because they come against the
[1:04:57] manifestation of the
[1:04:59] word. And then God what? Judges that
[1:05:04] nation. Like we said, God's going to
[1:05:06] show who he is. What? When he lifts the
[1:05:10] bride up and say, "See, that was me."
[1:05:14] You see the spoken word into I know
[1:05:17] people this is me again I guess but you
[1:05:20] know the Bible says all of creation is
[1:05:22] what
[1:05:23] groaning for the
[1:05:26] manifestation of the sons of God.
[1:05:30] You won't have to have a manifestation
[1:05:32] when you're on the other side.
[1:05:35] Do you know every time you walk out here
[1:05:37] that cactus, that palm tree, that tree?
[1:05:40] Oh
[1:05:41] man, when Oh man, if he only knew who he
[1:05:44] was, they can see who you are. If they
[1:05:46] just knew who they was and we could get
[1:05:48] out of here and I wouldn't have to have
[1:05:49] these little stickly things on me and I
[1:05:51] wouldn't have to the leaves fall off
[1:05:54] and they know who we are. How come we
[1:05:57] don't know who we
[1:05:58] are? Right? There was a brother years
[1:06:01] ago, brother Mike. He was first came in.
[1:06:04] I think we need to get back to our first
[1:06:06] love as what brother Brandham talks
[1:06:08] about in the complaint of God. But he
[1:06:10] when he first came in and he was just
[1:06:12] all on fire. He said one day he was at
[1:06:14] the grocery store and he was standing in
[1:06:16] line to to to check out back when you
[1:06:18] used to have to do that and you could
[1:06:20] talk to somebody, not the computer. And
[1:06:23] he said he's
[1:06:25] looking he's looking
[1:06:27] here. He's looking at these people. He
[1:06:30] said in his mind, he thought, "I wonder
[1:06:33] if they know who they're standing
[1:06:35] by. A son of
[1:06:39] God."
[1:06:41] Amen. That is us. We're Do you believe
[1:06:44] you're a child of God? Amen. Son and
[1:06:47] daughters of God. That what you came
[1:06:48] from God. You're going back to God.
[1:06:52] Right. Where were you? You always was.
[1:06:54] Brother Bram said. And but that's
[1:06:57] another one. I mean, sorry. I just I
[1:06:59] love the church age book because brother
[1:07:01] Brandham says learn this one
[1:07:06] thing. Are not the thoughts of God real?
[1:07:11] He says this isn't like a blueprint that
[1:07:15] someday God's trying to put together and
[1:07:17] make this and make that. It's already
[1:07:19] done.
[1:07:20] It's not someday you going to be a son.
[1:07:22] You always were, son.
[1:07:25] And you what? You were in the beginning.
[1:07:27] Brother, I just love this
[1:07:31] message. Cuz brother Bram says you are
[1:07:34] eternal
[1:07:35] life. There is no other eternal life but
[1:07:40] right here. I know you think, man, I'm
[1:07:43] eternal life. And you know what?
[1:07:45] Tomorrow Satan's going to make you prove
[1:07:49] it. You said, man, that was so good
[1:07:51] message. Man, I'm a son of God. I'm
[1:07:54] gonna and he's gonna, you know,
[1:07:56] sometimes he thinks, man, if I just be
[1:08:00] quiet and maybe Satan won't come my
[1:08:06] way, right? I mean, it's like, where's
[1:08:09] he at? Let me see that guy. Where's
[1:08:12] Satan
[1:08:13] at?
[1:08:15] Like, things are going good right now.
[1:08:18] Don't do
[1:08:19] anything. Right. But you know, Satan
[1:08:22] reads us when I was young, way back in
[1:08:25] that other
[1:08:28] millennium. I used to like to box. That
[1:08:31] was my sport. And for some reason, I
[1:08:34] like to get
[1:08:35] hit.
[1:08:38] And I know it sounds that's probably why
[1:08:40] I'm as goofy as I am now, but I mean,
[1:08:44] when I was in got out of sixth grade, I
[1:08:48] was the biggest person in school. not in
[1:08:50] my
[1:08:51] class in school. I was bigger than the
[1:08:54] principal. I was bigger than all the
[1:08:57] teachers. So, I've always been pretty
[1:08:59] big. So, back then, we used to have a
[1:09:02] lot of uh uh professional boxing
[1:09:06] fighting in Anchorage and we actually
[1:09:08] had some uh back then way back in that
[1:09:12] millennium, you would know some of the
[1:09:13] names. Even got to meet a guy that
[1:09:15] became the heavyweight champion of the
[1:09:17] world. And so I was 15 years old, like I
[1:09:20] said, and I was pretty
[1:09:21] big. And so the only people I had to
[1:09:24] spar with were actual professionals that
[1:09:27] were adults and all of that. And they
[1:09:30] were just as big as I was because we
[1:09:32] were heavyweights. So we would spar all
[1:09:35] of that and and I'd go,
[1:09:38] "Man, we almost I was about to quit.
[1:09:42] This was just too tough." And they go,
[1:09:44] "Wow, you really said because we didn't
[1:09:50] know." Because the one thing about
[1:09:53] fighting spiritually too, the one thing
[1:09:56] about fighting, you would watch your
[1:09:59] opponent. You would watch their eyes.
[1:10:02] You would watch their
[1:10:03] expressions and you could see if
[1:10:05] somebody was hurt. But I learned how not
[1:10:09] to do that.
[1:10:11] You see, we need to do that in the
[1:10:12] spiritual because Satan watches
[1:10:15] you. He throws something your way and he
[1:10:17] watches you. Is it affecting
[1:10:19] them? Can I go more? Can I go
[1:10:22] harder? You see, you got to quit being
[1:10:25] so uh expressive. Every time something
[1:10:28] happen, oh man, it's just the worst
[1:10:30] thing in the world. You won't believe
[1:10:31] it. He's watching you,
[1:10:37] right? He's watching you. Just remember
[1:10:40] that. Just throwing that in at the end.
[1:10:41] Just remember, he's watching you. Don't
[1:10:44] show
[1:10:45] everything. Don't complain about
[1:10:49] everything. You don't even need to
[1:10:51] complain to God. Satan's
[1:10:54] listening. All right? So, don't you know
[1:10:57] when you get
[1:10:59] down,
[1:11:01] right? Let God tell you how to
[1:11:04] pray. And you know how you pray. It's
[1:11:06] not for yourself. Sorry.
[1:11:09] pray for the other person, you
[1:11:12] know, because you'll find out if you
[1:11:14] start praying for somebody else's
[1:11:16] problems and needs, you'll find out
[1:11:17] yours weren't that
[1:11:19] bad, right? You know, it's always amazed
[1:11:21] me because the Bible says that
[1:11:24] everybody in this whole world, believers
[1:11:26] and non-believers, go through the same
[1:11:28] things. Now, we are privileged because
[1:11:31] we have a peace that we can go to. We
[1:11:34] know who holds our life in their hands.
[1:11:38] But man, I see some of that stuff out
[1:11:40] there and I think I could never go
[1:11:41] through that. I could ne I you know,
[1:11:46] losing one of my kids is dying or
[1:11:47] somebody steal. I could not go through
[1:11:50] that, you
[1:11:53] know. So pray for somebody else and our
[1:11:57] stuff won't look that bad. Father, we
[1:11:59] just appreciate you, Lord. We thank you,
[1:12:01] Father.
[1:12:03] You're always so good to us, Lord.
[1:12:05] And Father, just this thought, what if
[1:12:08] could it be, Lord? Have we missed a few
[1:12:11] things,
[1:12:12] Father, just like them on the road to
[1:12:14] Emmas, not
[1:12:16] seeing what has been fulfilled already
[1:12:19] by the events that have happened in the
[1:12:22] world, just like they knew, Father, they
[1:12:24] knew that the uh that Jesus, he said,
[1:12:27] "Destroy this temple. I'll raise it up
[1:12:30] again in three days." And there they
[1:12:32] were. What? Lord, three days later,
[1:12:33] they're walking. Yet, they didn't
[1:12:36] recognize that scripture had been
[1:12:38] fulfilled when it was right before them.
[1:12:40] Lord, help us, Father, to search these
[1:12:44] things and see where we're at in the we
[1:12:48] would call it the timeline of the
[1:12:50] message or the timeline of what we think
[1:12:53] prophecy needs are being fulfilled to
[1:12:57] see where we're really at. Lord, is it
[1:12:59] us as we we know brother Brandham wasn't
[1:13:02] per se talking about the bride being in
[1:13:06] the way of Israel getting out of here,
[1:13:08] but because the bride is still here, you
[1:13:11] can't send those two prophets to Israel
[1:13:14] to recognize for their atonement, Lord.
[1:13:18] But if we are in the way, help us, Lord.
[1:13:20] Open our eyes to see, Father. Open our
[1:13:23] eyes, Lord, to
[1:13:26] recognize who we are and why we're here.
[1:13:29] Father, help us to recognize, Lord, we
[1:13:32] we have to go through these things in
[1:13:34] life. We're going to have trials. We're
[1:13:36] going to have tribulation, Lord, and
[1:13:39] we're going to have heartache and these
[1:13:42] things are always going to be there,
[1:13:44] Father, but it's for a purpose. And yet,
[1:13:47] there's a greater purpose why we're
[1:13:48] here, Lord. Father, we just love you. We
[1:13:51] appreciate you. and just praying for
[1:13:54] brother Aaron.
[1:13:55] And that they'd have just a good time of
[1:13:58] relaxation, Lord. And we know he said
[1:14:01] he's coming back tomorrow, Father, as
[1:14:03] they journey back that you would keep
[1:14:04] them safe, Lord. And that he'd just be
[1:14:07] renewed in spirit,
[1:14:09] Father, and renewed in body, Lord. We
[1:14:12] love you. We appreciate
[1:14:15] you. Just be with us now, Father. just
[1:14:18] pray you take these jumbled up words and
[1:14:21] just place them in the heart of each
[1:14:23] person. Lord, I always feel when I
[1:14:26] preach like brother Bram told that story
[1:14:29] of that boy that somebody he was down in
[1:14:32] the field praying and all he was doing
[1:14:34] was reciting his ABCs and they're like,
[1:14:36] "What are you doing?" And so I don't
[1:14:38] really know how to pray, but I figure
[1:14:41] God will be able to take the letters and
[1:14:42] form the
[1:14:44] words. And father, you said it was the
[1:14:46] foolishness of preaching. And they're
[1:14:49] your people, Lord. They're you know how
[1:14:52] to speak to them and to bring those
[1:14:53] things together. We just love you. We
[1:14:56] appreciate all that you
[1:14:58] do. Help us, Lord. And we ask it in
[1:15:01] Jesus name. Amen.
