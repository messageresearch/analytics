[0:00] ruth chapter one we'll start with verse
[0:01] 15
[0:03] and then read to verse 18. and she said
[0:06] behold this is naomi speaking behold thy
[0:08] sister-in-law
[0:09] is gone back unto her people and unto
[0:12] her gods and that's a
[0:13] kind of important phrasing there return
[0:15] thou after thy
[0:16] sister-in-law and the ruth said and
[0:19] treat me not to leave thee or to return
[0:21] from following after thee
[0:23] for whether thou goest i will go and
[0:25] where thou
[0:26] lodgest i will lodge thy people shall be
[0:28] my people and thy
[0:30] god my god where thou diest will i die
[0:33] and there will
[0:33] i be buried the lord do so to me and
[0:36] more also if ought but
[0:37] death part thee in me
[0:40] when she saw that she was steadfastly
[0:43] minded to go with her
[0:45] then she left speaking unto her
[0:48] you can be seated and she saw that she
[0:51] was
[0:52] steadfastly minded she let the
[0:54] conversation end
[0:56] and let it go last time we spoke on a
[0:59] showdown
[0:59] i'm just going to use a few statements
[1:01] here at the outset
[1:02] to um kind of collect where we were at
[1:05] that time
[1:06] and even kind of picking up over the
[1:08] last several services in the showdown
[1:10] ruth
[1:10] is facing her condition even in some
[1:13] ways the condition she's currently in
[1:15] her
[1:15] her expectations her idol worship her
[1:19] upbringing her nature and her nurture
[1:21] and so she's facing her condition
[1:23] and then she's also facing her
[1:25] opposition as she comes to bethlehem
[1:27] she's not there yet
[1:29] she's at this critical juncture where
[1:31] she's nearing that and even if some
[1:33] people
[1:33] look at the story she may have been just
[1:35] right at that borderline
[1:37] and so she's facing her condition she's
[1:39] facing her opposition
[1:40] in what brother branham called a
[1:42] showdown he said this was a showdown for
[1:44] ruth
[1:45] and so orpah as we looked at her last
[1:48] time she walks in the steps of lot's
[1:50] wife
[1:51] now that we saw before in genesis 19
[1:53] that lot's wife
[1:54] started out as an overcomer she was that
[1:56] borderline believer that make believer
[1:58] she came so far and then turned around
[2:00] and went back
[2:01] and this is the this is in the lineage
[2:03] this is in the nature of moab and here
[2:05] orpah
[2:06] in the nature of her father and the
[2:07] nature of her her mother so to speak she
[2:10] takes that step back and she goes back
[2:12] into moab which was her homeland
[2:14] and then she's orpha's walking in the
[2:16] image of the prophecy of remember lot's
[2:19] wife in luke chapter 17
[2:21] verse 32 that in the time that the son
[2:23] of man is being revealed
[2:24] there is going to be a turning back
[2:27] those that turn back and go back
[2:28] we see that orpah walks into that uh
[2:31] walks in that pattern
[2:33] but it's not satisfactory to identify
[2:36] orpah because we don't identify with her
[2:38] at all we might feel that we can
[2:39] see that nature and we can see that
[2:41] instinct but who we identify with
[2:43] is ruth and ruth begins to walk in the
[2:45] steps of not
[2:46] lot's wife but sarah how sarah was there
[2:49] with abraham she
[2:50] stayed with her husband and and who is
[2:52] that father of faith and how she
[2:54] she was there with the promise of her
[2:55] own and so ruth is walking in the steps
[2:58] of sarah or the faith of abraham and she
[3:01] also portrays those who are captured by
[3:04] the faith of the son of man in luke 17
[3:06] 30. so there's this
[3:07] process that's unfolding we see orpah go
[3:09] one way we see ruth going another
[3:12] brother bran mccall did a showdown
[3:14] we read this statement a few services
[3:15] ago services ago and what was the holy
[3:17] ghost given for
[3:19] and it says orpha she said that she
[3:21] would return back to her country to her
[3:23] gods and to her church
[3:24] and to her people but the band used a
[3:26] very strong language she kissed christ
[3:28] goodbye she kissed
[3:29] the message goodbye and naomi tried to
[3:32] get ruth to go back
[3:33] but she said your people are my people
[3:36] your god is my god where you die
[3:38] there i'll die where you're buried there
[3:40] i'll be buried and i will not turn back
[3:42] and he uses this phrase this is kind of
[3:44] what caught me that's when
[3:46] a person's caught a vision so there's
[3:48] something
[3:49] that ruth is catching there's something
[3:51] that's very deep inside of her
[3:53] and i want to express that it wasn't in
[3:55] technicolor at the time it wasn't
[3:57] perfect and she didn't say
[3:59] oh i just know there's a really rich man
[4:01] i'm going to marry and
[4:02] and bethlehem judas so everything's
[4:03] going to work out it wasn't that
[4:05] everything was just spelled out
[4:06] perfectly in this in this instance
[4:09] but she something was drawing her
[4:11] something very deep and
[4:13] and what i'm wanting to come to once we
[4:15] get into ruth chapter 2
[4:16] is how that we could see that there was
[4:18] this unfolding of this revelation though
[4:20] ruth is walking in this promise
[4:22] and ruth is coming to bethlehem judah
[4:24] and ruth is going to of necessity
[4:27] begin to glean and there's provision and
[4:29] there's inspiration there's faith that's
[4:31] guiding her
[4:32] there it leads to this point and i'm not
[4:34] trying to hide this at all but this is
[4:36] really what i have as my
[4:37] vision to come to and speak about is how
[4:40] that
[4:40] one day in this process the revelation
[4:43] comes to her that
[4:44] this is more than just you know a place
[4:47] to live
[4:47] and a place to eat this is your kinsman
[4:50] redeemer
[4:51] this is salvation this is christ and we
[4:54] have the similar
[4:55] experience in the message of the hour we
[4:57] come to it we begin to fellowship in it
[4:59] the word begins to open to us
[5:01] but then there comes a time when
[5:02] revelations begin to break and unfold
[5:04] like wow
[5:05] i just thought it was different or i
[5:06] just thought it was another way of doing
[5:08] this or
[5:08] i thought god had just sent a prophet
[5:10] but then you begin to see the scriptures
[5:12] that are being fulfilled
[5:13] and it completely changes the whole your
[5:16] whole perception of what god had been
[5:17] doing from the moment you begin to leave
[5:19] moab
[5:20] and so at the time that ruth is in this
[5:22] place of saying
[5:24] i'll i'll go where you go and how large
[5:26] were you large
[5:27] she's caught a vision and and it's not
[5:30] perfectly spelled out to her to where
[5:32] naomi said now go back but if you don't
[5:34] i can find you a husband under according
[5:36] to our law
[5:37] in israel that wasn't the promise but
[5:38] something was anchoring deep inside of
[5:40] her
[5:41] and so that's a person who's caught a
[5:43] vision don't make any difference what
[5:44] her people said
[5:45] you're going over there becoming a holy
[5:47] roller or something that didn't make any
[5:49] difference to ruth there was a purpose
[5:50] of god to be fulfilled
[5:52] and so it's something deep inside of our
[5:54] faith that begins to rise up it's a
[5:57] revealing of the son of man for us
[5:58] it was a faith that began to swell up
[6:00] for her even if she didn't know exactly
[6:02] at the time what it was
[6:04] so in giving when brother banham uses
[6:05] the phrase the phrase
[6:07] and and i didn't go back and use these
[6:09] uh quotations and maybe i
[6:10] would have had time to do it but i just
[6:12] wanted to make reference very quickly
[6:14] how brother brown called this a showdown
[6:16] it became a showdown for ruth
[6:18] and showdown when i began to look at the
[6:20] etymology of it where the phrase began i
[6:22] couldn't find anywhere
[6:24] where it had a use or reference other
[6:27] than
[6:28] that its origin was in it was slang for
[6:31] laying your cards down face up
[6:33] and it came a time in this in playing
[6:35] cards or poker
[6:36] that there was and we don't endorse
[6:37] those things uh but that
[6:40] you would come to a point where there
[6:41] would be a showdown and everyone has to
[6:43] lay their cards face up and everyone
[6:45] knows then what hand you're holding
[6:47] and that becomes kind of like what they
[6:49] call a final confrontation
[6:51] uh the games are over and you can't you
[6:53] can't bluff anymore and you can't
[6:54] pretend i don't have a good hand or you
[6:56] can't
[6:57] be you know bluffing uh that you're that
[6:59] you have a good one but you have a poor
[7:01] one everyone lays their things out
[7:03] in front and so it was slang for laying
[7:05] your cards out face up for everyone to
[7:07] see
[7:08] and then it kind of turned into this
[7:09] idea of a confrontation a final
[7:11] confrontation
[7:12] something that's going to end that play
[7:14] or that hand and so now we use the
[7:16] phrase showdown as a test
[7:18] or a confrontation that's meant to
[7:21] settle a matter
[7:22] if it's coming to a showdown it's like
[7:23] things are going to be decided now
[7:25] things are going to come to their
[7:26] coming to a head so it's an event that
[7:29] forces an issue
[7:30] to its conclusion that when it comes to
[7:32] this point
[7:33] it's a showdown so it's a test that's
[7:35] meant to settle a matter a confrontation
[7:37] that is uh intended to conclude
[7:39] something it's an issue
[7:40] an event that forces an issue to its
[7:42] conclusion it's an act that brings
[7:44] matters to a head
[7:45] or acts as a conclusion so this is a
[7:48] showdown
[7:49] now when we say a showdown we're we're
[7:51] wanting to
[7:52] kind of give this understanding things
[7:54] unfold and there's other junctures and
[7:56] there's other things that transpire
[7:57] but this becomes kind of a dividing
[7:59] point between moab and bethlehem judah
[8:02] it's at this point that ruth is going to
[8:03] begin to enter into a journey
[8:05] and a process that ends in her bringing
[8:08] forth a son that's in the lineage of
[8:09] jesus christ
[8:10] and so this is the like a watershed
[8:13] moment this is a showdown
[8:14] where ruth is separating herself and
[8:16] it's this climactic event at this point
[8:18] it's an act that brings a matter to a
[8:20] head
[8:21] it is uh it is a test that settles this
[8:24] matter for ruth because now
[8:25] at this point there's no going back
[8:27] seemed like it for orpha maybe she had
[8:29] crossed that
[8:30] across the rubicon so to speak and she
[8:32] had had this moment where now there's no
[8:34] turning back you've got to go forward
[8:35] but
[8:36] she she she went back but for ruth
[8:38] there's going to come a showdown
[8:40] and so i want you to kind of imagine
[8:41] this we're at the border now we're at
[8:43] the borderline we're near this crossing
[8:44] over between the promise
[8:46] and moab that's where we are tonight
[8:48] because we just we had read before how
[8:50] orpah kissed her mother-in-law we're at
[8:52] this borderline orpah kisses her
[8:53] mother-in-law
[8:54] and she goes back and now orpah
[8:57] fades into obscurity right she's
[8:59] excommunicated she's never mentioned
[9:00] anymore
[9:01] uh even though it's kind of the language
[9:04] that we see in the message that she's no
[9:05] longer the church is no longer a
[9:07] mouthpiece
[9:08] uh even we see the insignificance a lot
[9:10] entering into insignificance
[9:11] so orp is fading off the scene if we
[9:13] could just view this as a transition
[9:15] in this great story this drama orpah
[9:17] fades away and now the story is going to
[9:19] focus solely on ruth
[9:21] you say well there was a limoulic and
[9:23] there was his two sons and naomi and
[9:24] then there was
[9:25] uh then elimelech gone and it's naomi
[9:28] and her two sons who married these two
[9:29] girls and
[9:30] you find the story is narrowing down
[9:31] it's at this point that we should
[9:33] realize
[9:33] it's not so much about naomi it's about
[9:36] ruth
[9:37] the focus begins to zero in on ruth
[9:40] and so ruth comes to a showdown
[9:43] she comes to a place of deciding and i
[9:46] know you're all
[9:47] message students so you're familiar with
[9:48] how brother branham identifies
[9:50] that there was four stages or even
[9:53] phases i think is a word that he uses
[9:55] of ruth there's ruth deciding serving
[9:58] ruth resting and ruth rewarded and i
[10:00] think even maybe scofield may bring that
[10:02] out
[10:03] in his headings in a schofield bible
[10:05] that you have
[10:06] you have ruth deciding and then once she
[10:08] makes her decision
[10:09] you have ruth serving and then once she
[10:11] serves she's
[10:12] she's resting on the promise of boaz and
[10:14] then there's the reward
[10:16] and brother ma'am actually uses those
[10:17] different uh stages or phases in
[10:19] different ways how
[10:20] ruth deciding is justification ruth
[10:22] serving his sanctification
[10:24] ruth resting is the baptism of the holy
[10:26] ghost and so
[10:27] these things don't become real hard and
[10:29] fast doctrines like no
[10:30] this is what it is brother branham we'll
[10:32] use them in different ways about the
[10:34] decision
[10:35] about the rest and the reward but we can
[10:37] just see these types
[10:38] in this great drama and this story
[10:40] that's unfolding in the book of ruth
[10:42] and so there is ruth that is deciding
[10:45] and that's kind of the point that
[10:46] this showdown comes in she's she's
[10:48] deciding
[10:50] and in revelations chapter 5 part 1
[10:53] when brother branham is preaching the
[10:54] church ages he says ruth
[10:56] deciding she was deciding whether she
[10:59] would make the decision or not
[11:01] to go back into the homeland just like
[11:03] the church
[11:04] and so that i don't have this the
[11:06] quotation for you on a slide but
[11:07] ruth is deciding and he says she's
[11:09] deciding whether she would make the
[11:11] decision to go or to stay
[11:12] to go back into homeland to go with
[11:14] naomi and he says to go back into the
[11:15] homeland so what is that going back into
[11:17] her comforts
[11:18] going back to her church going back to
[11:20] her way of thinking going back to her
[11:21] god as
[11:22] as as the bible says she's naomi says
[11:24] she's gone back to her people she's gone
[11:26] back
[11:26] to to her gods is what she's familiar
[11:28] with what she's comfortable with
[11:30] she's gone to a place that she knows
[11:31] that she can she can exist and she can
[11:33] get by and he says just like the church
[11:36] so there's that again that overlay of
[11:38] orpah representing the church but ruth
[11:40] now is representing the bride
[11:42] and she comes to a show now where she
[11:43] has to decide
[11:45] and now is we know what she says and
[11:47] we'll read it here in a moment in ruth
[11:49] chapter one
[11:50] but as you as we find ruth on this
[11:52] borderline
[11:53] to leave moab and and where she was
[11:57] in the land now to cross back over
[11:59] jordan to the promised land
[12:00] i want you to catch a parallel of the
[12:02] children of israel
[12:04] in the book of joshua chapter 24 where
[12:07] where joshua is now commanding them uh
[12:11] uh they're they're now being settled
[12:13] they're being established
[12:14] they're going to find themselves in this
[12:15] promised land and just
[12:17] how uh joshua challenges the people and
[12:20] i want you to use this because i know
[12:21] you're very familiar with the scripture
[12:22] reading
[12:23] i want to use it as so just to see the
[12:25] symmetry
[12:26] between what ruth actually says to naomi
[12:28] and what joshua says to the people
[12:31] in in joshua 24. now this is a very
[12:33] familiar scripture to all of us in verse
[12:35] 14
[12:36] now therefore fear the lord and serve
[12:38] him in sincerity and in truth
[12:41] and put away the gods which your father
[12:43] served on the other side of the flood
[12:45] and in egypt so now he's referencing
[12:47] this other land this other time this
[12:49] other period and how there's been a
[12:50] there's a decision that's happened
[12:52] this watershed moment this transition
[12:54] into the promised land and now make a
[12:56] choice are you going to serve god in the
[12:58] promised land
[12:58] or are you going to go back to the way
[13:00] you lived and believed before and he
[13:02] says if it
[13:03] seem evil unto you to serve the lord
[13:04] choose you this day whom you will serve
[13:08] so he's this is the decision this is
[13:10] israel deciding if we had
[13:12] israel deciding so that they can they
[13:14] can enter to this promise and enter into
[13:15] their rest he says choose you this day
[13:17] whom you'll serve
[13:18] whether the gods which your father
[13:20] served that were on the other side of
[13:21] the flood
[13:22] or the gods of the amorites and whose
[13:25] land you dwell
[13:26] and this language caught me because what
[13:28] was that last bit of land that israel
[13:30] had found themselves in before they
[13:32] crossed over
[13:33] the land of the amorites which the king
[13:34] of the amorites had taken from who
[13:36] moab and so there's this parallel he's
[13:40] saying do you want to go back to serve
[13:41] the gods
[13:42] of the amorites you want to go back to
[13:43] serve the gods of the moabites do you
[13:45] want to go back to what we've just come
[13:47] out of and on the other side of the
[13:48] river on the other side of the flood you
[13:50] want to go back
[13:51] to be moabites and amorites and serve
[13:53] these other gods
[13:54] he says but as for me and my house we
[13:56] will serve the lord
[13:58] we've sung it we believe it we it's one
[14:00] of those things that are
[14:01] we we do in a very uh a shabby chic font
[14:04] with a nice uh
[14:05] barn wood background and we put it on
[14:07] above our couch in our living room right
[14:09] as for me and my house will serve the
[14:11] lord it's very very well known scripture
[14:13] but this is something very very profound
[14:16] something very sober and he says that's
[14:18] for me and my family that's what he
[14:19] means
[14:20] we're going to serve the lord we have a
[14:21] choice to make we can be like the world
[14:23] we can serve the world we can continue
[14:25] in our ways of thinking and our ways of
[14:26] living our ways of raising
[14:28] our ways of processing things but we've
[14:30] come to a point we've got to decide i'm
[14:31] going all the way with the lord i'm not
[14:33] going to stay the way that i've been
[14:35] i i'm going to serve god and i'm going
[14:36] to serve him holy with my whole heart
[14:39] and when we say as for me and my house
[14:40] i'll serve the lord let's not just think
[14:42] in some terms of
[14:44] the confession that jesus christ is my
[14:46] savior
[14:47] and i have a walk with god and it's some
[14:49] sort of cliche that we can just merely
[14:51] feel
[14:52] by checking the box on a few different
[14:54] disciplines that we can do and going to
[14:56] church and believing in jesus christ
[14:58] it's more to it than that so he says
[15:00] whether the gods which your father
[15:02] served that were on the other side of
[15:03] the flood or the gods of the amorites
[15:04] and whose land you dwell
[15:06] but as for me in my house we will serve
[15:08] the lord
[15:09] verse 16 and the people answered and
[15:11] said
[15:12] god forbid that we should forsake the
[15:14] lord to serve other
[15:16] other gods and notice what their
[15:18] response is
[15:19] because joshua's bringing him to a
[15:21] showdown to a decision
[15:23] serve god or go back to egypt serve god
[15:26] or go back to the land of the amorite
[15:28] serve god or go back on the other side
[15:29] of the flood serve god now in the
[15:31] present truth or go back to the way
[15:33] things were before and they say
[15:34] oh god forbid that we forsake the lord
[15:36] to serve other gods for the lord verse
[15:38] 17 the lord is our god
[15:41] the lord for the lord our god they say
[15:43] for the lord our god
[15:45] he is that brought us up here it is that
[15:47] brought us up
[15:48] and our fathers out of the land of egypt
[15:50] from the house of bondage
[15:52] and which did those great signs in our
[15:53] sight and preserved us in all the way
[15:55] wherein we went
[15:56] and among all the people through whom we
[15:58] passed and the lord drave out from
[16:01] before us
[16:01] all the people even the amorites which
[16:04] dwelt in the land this is even regards
[16:06] to those that would have dwelt within
[16:07] the promised land so you see there's a
[16:09] driving away of moab there's a driving
[16:10] away of the amorites
[16:11] it's god that has done this therefore we
[16:13] will serve the lord
[16:15] he is our god giving
[16:18] you're saying hey it's god that's done
[16:20] this this has been the promise of the
[16:21] lord he is our god
[16:22] in an answer to joshua's challenge
[16:25] they're like nay
[16:26] we will not forsake him. now it's
[16:28] interesting
[16:29] because in the book of ruth or you know
[16:31] orpah uh
[16:32] kisses her mother-in-law and says
[16:34] goodbye but what did ruth do
[16:36] she claimed to naomi so then in this
[16:39] scene you kind of see how joshua
[16:40] challenges them oh
[16:42] why don't you go back go back to your
[16:44] other gods naomi saying go back to
[16:46] your country and you'll find new
[16:48] husbands and you'll find children
[16:50] and you'll be comforted and you'll be
[16:52] successful and orpa says all right
[16:53] fine see you later and ruth cleaves to
[16:56] naomi and then this is the people now
[16:58] they say no we will not forsake our god
[17:00] but then notice what joshua says and i
[17:03] feel
[17:04] that it's so close to verse 15 and that
[17:06] she says oh your sister-in-law has gone
[17:07] back
[17:09] why don't you go back also joshua said
[17:11] to the people you cannot serve the lord
[17:13] for he is a holy god that's quite a
[17:16] statement he says you can't do it
[17:19] he is a jealous god he will not forgive
[17:20] your transgressions nor your sins
[17:22] if you forsake the lord and serve
[17:24] strange gods then he will turn
[17:26] and do you hurt and consume you after
[17:28] that he have done
[17:29] you good this is prophecy
[17:32] because we know this is exactly what
[17:34] happens but they're challenged kind of
[17:35] rebuffed well why don't you go back
[17:37] why don't you go back like orpah did and
[17:39] the people said unto joshua nay but we
[17:41] will serve the lord now what joshua was
[17:45] doing
[17:46] he was bringing them to make a very
[17:47] conscious and deliberate decision
[17:50] it wasn't like hey this is great here we
[17:52] are let's make this work but he wanted
[17:53] them to make a very deliberate and
[17:55] conscious decision
[17:56] in that they had to disavow their formal
[17:58] ways of doing things they had to even
[17:59] acknowledge
[18:00] that there was some idolatry that they
[18:02] had brought with them
[18:03] certain things they'd picked up certain
[18:05] habits and certain ways of viewing
[18:06] things and certain ways of believing in
[18:08] certain ways they felt things should be
[18:09] done
[18:10] and there'd been kind of a mixing of the
[18:11] amorites and moabites and these
[18:13] different
[18:13] ideologies and bailism into into their
[18:16] thought process and into their worship
[18:18] and into their home
[18:19] and so he wanted to bring the very very
[18:21] conscious decision that wait a minute
[18:23] here we are in the message of the hour
[18:25] here we are serving god
[18:26] in the present truth and i've got to i
[18:29] can't mix
[18:30] i can't mingle i can't be divided i need
[18:32] to make a very a clear-cut decision a
[18:34] very conscious decision about what i'm
[18:36] doing
[18:36] very alert and aware of these things
[18:38] that are taking place around me and it's
[18:40] got to be a deliberate
[18:41] choice now to serve god and forsake
[18:43] everything else
[18:45] and that's what joshua's challenging to
[18:47] do and that's exactly what they did
[18:49] and brother branham this is just a quick
[18:51] statement i'll share with you from the
[18:52] message why little bethlehem
[18:54] and if you've been kind of jotting down
[18:55] these notes and paying attention uh
[18:57] maybe to these titles you'll find i'm
[18:58] quoting a lot from just a few sermons
[19:00] because brother graham doesn't talk
[19:01] about ruth a lot and we've just been
[19:03] reading in those places where he
[19:04] preaches on ruth and it's very easy to
[19:06] just
[19:06] look over those sermons in total and not
[19:09] be constantly having to search because
[19:11] it's very
[19:11] just very few places where he focuses in
[19:13] on this and the message why little
[19:15] bethlehem he says that's what god wants
[19:17] it's not that borderline halfway but an
[19:20] absolute full surrender to the kingdom
[19:22] of god he's making reference to ruth's
[19:25] decision he says that's what god wants
[19:26] it's not borderline it's not halfway but
[19:28] it's an absolute full surrender to the
[19:31] kingdom of god
[19:32] this is what joshua was calling the
[19:34] people to do hey you're in the promised
[19:35] land now but are you going to serve the
[19:36] gods from the other side of the flood
[19:39] or will you let this become the
[19:40] habitation of the lord to holy follow
[19:42] him
[19:42] and to cling to him and to only serve
[19:44] him
[19:46] and so there's this parallel i trust
[19:47] that you're kind of seeing that this
[19:48] parallel between
[19:49] the decision that joshua brings the
[19:51] people to and the decision that ruth is
[19:53] making
[19:53] and let's just read it very quickly
[19:55] again in verses 15 to 18
[19:57] notice how well this parallels with the
[19:59] people's response
[20:00] joshua's challenge and the people's
[20:02] response and she said behold my
[20:04] sister-in-law has gone back unto her
[20:06] people and unto her gods return thou
[20:08] after thy sister-in-law
[20:10] you cannot serve the lord he's a holy
[20:12] god you're not going to be able to do it
[20:13] and
[20:13] why don't you just go back and serve the
[20:15] gods on the other side of the flood and
[20:17] if you think it's evil then just turn
[20:18] back go back and she says
[20:20] and i want to read it all and then break
[20:22] it down entreat me not to leave thee
[20:25] or to return from following after thee
[20:28] for wither thou goest i will go on where
[20:29] thou largest i will lodge thy people
[20:31] shall be my people and thy god my
[20:34] god as the people said we will serve the
[20:36] lord and he
[20:37] is our god there's one god will serve
[20:39] him he's the lord verse 17
[20:41] where thou diest will i die and there
[20:43] will i be buried
[20:45] the lord do so to me and more also if
[20:47] ought but death part v and me
[20:50] when she's and so this is her that's the
[20:52] great declaration of ruth
[20:54] as we've mentioned several times are
[20:56] very familiar it becomes now
[20:57] a vow that's being made from ruth
[21:01] to naomi it's a vow that's expressed in
[21:04] marriage vows that there's this
[21:06] union that's taking place and and it's
[21:08] used in that context because the
[21:10] language is so beautiful and it speaks
[21:11] of a commitment
[21:12] but i want to slow down a little bit
[21:13] tonight and ponder what she's actually
[21:15] saying
[21:16] and what she's vowing to do because you
[21:18] could just take anyone that says to
[21:20] somebody wherever you go i'll go
[21:22] whatever you do i'll do wherever you
[21:23] sleep i'll sleep
[21:25] and you say wow that's quite a
[21:26] commitment and what have you signed
[21:27] yourself up to do
[21:29] go wherever they go do whatever they do
[21:32] die wherever they die and you can ponder
[21:34] that a little bit and say well
[21:35] you would only make that promise
[21:38] to certain people or into in a
[21:40] particular situation and really realize
[21:42] i could only make that vow to the lord i
[21:45] could only make that vow to christ
[21:47] he's the only one that i can follow
[21:49] unreservedly he's the only one that i
[21:50] could commit to
[21:51] without without any inhibitions and so
[21:55] it may be used in this marital without
[21:56] context but i want you to think that
[21:58] even in that contest
[22:00] even in that situation it has a greater
[22:02] context
[22:03] as to why you can make that vow why you
[22:05] would even express those things
[22:07] and so then naomi recognizing that this
[22:10] declaration of ruth and when she saw
[22:11] that she
[22:12] was steadfastly minded to go with her
[22:14] then she left speaking unto her
[22:17] now we've read it twice now and i want
[22:19] to read it a third time
[22:20] but this time i want to slow down and i
[22:23] want to go statement by statement
[22:25] and if you're thinking oh great how many
[22:26] months is that going to take you
[22:28] to do since it took us forever to get
[22:30] out of ruth chapter verse 1
[22:31] chapter 1 verse 1. it's i think i can do
[22:34] it tonight
[22:35] i'm going to do it tonight but i want to
[22:37] look at in a particular way by taking it
[22:39] from a translation
[22:41] and it's from the targum translation
[22:43] where that is actually target it means
[22:45] translation or interpretation
[22:48] and it's a it's a translation of the
[22:50] hebrew bible
[22:51] into aramaic and so they took the the
[22:54] the hebrew bible
[22:55] and the and the different uh
[22:58] uh the penthouse and these different
[22:59] writings and the hebrew writings the
[23:01] things that made up their scrolls and
[23:02] their law
[23:03] and made up the hebrew bible as we call
[23:05] it these hebrew writings that were so
[23:07] precious to
[23:08] judaism and to the jews it had been once
[23:11] the jews were exiled into babylon they
[23:13] all began to speak
[23:14] aramaic and for a lot of them they
[23:17] couldn't read the hebrew bible
[23:18] they had actually lost their language in
[23:20] the language of their fathers and they
[23:22] and so it was necessary after the
[23:24] babylonian exile and bondage to the
[23:26] chaldeans and different ones
[23:27] that the the bible was translated from
[23:29] hebrew into a more common language that
[23:31] they could understand and we realized
[23:32] we're even taught that jesus
[23:34] probably would have spoke aramaic and
[23:35] that and so there's a different
[23:37] language that's being spoken amongst the
[23:39] jews and so they took the old writings
[23:41] in hebrew
[23:42] and they translated them into what's
[23:44] called the targum or the interpretation
[23:46] which is an aramic translation
[23:48] of the hebrew text and what's unique
[23:50] about it is it's not just a literal
[23:52] translation that with the king james
[23:54] bible
[23:54] they're taking the hebrew they're taking
[23:56] the greek and it becomes a literal word
[23:58] for word translation
[24:00] but in many of the places in the targum
[24:02] it contains interpretation
[24:04] uh um and explanatory notes that even as
[24:07] you're reading it it could say
[24:08] uh even in the in the book of ruth it
[24:10] says that the two
[24:12] that mahlon and kulian took to them
[24:14] wives
[24:15] of of moab contrary to the law that was
[24:19] given to them in marriage and it
[24:20] actually
[24:20] breaks down what law they're they're
[24:22] they're uh violating
[24:24] in uh in the way that it's being
[24:26] transferred so it gives these
[24:27] explanatory notes and these
[24:28] interpretations
[24:30] and i'm going to read it from the targum
[24:32] because it's it interprets these this
[24:34] verse that we read here verses 16 and 17
[24:37] and it interprets it and breaks it down
[24:40] into a conversation
[24:42] and brother branham in the message
[24:44] redeemer redemption says
[24:46] talks about the story of redemption in
[24:48] ruth
[24:49] and he uses the phrase that it gives out
[24:51] the very lines
[24:52] of redemption and so what struck me
[24:55] is that it became it became like a
[24:58] screenplay or a play like a play and a
[25:01] drama
[25:02] and so i went ahead and i just created a
[25:04] script
[25:05] and actually says a showdown presented
[25:07] by arizona believers church
[25:09] i couldn't say it was by me i did i
[25:11] didn't write i didn't write the book of
[25:12] ruth i didn't translate the
[25:14] targum and so i've actually laid it out
[25:17] uh and sister elizabeth asked me if we
[25:19] were gonna have people acted out tonight
[25:21] i said no
[25:21] i wish i had thought of that ahead of
[25:22] time it could have could have made this
[25:24] a lot of fun
[25:24] but it's like a script because i've
[25:26] broken it down using this
[25:28] translation into a script and so
[25:31] in looking at it this way and looking at
[25:33] as a script and looking as like a
[25:35] screenplay or
[25:36] a play that's being dramatized the very
[25:38] lines of redemption says the lines
[25:40] redemption
[25:40] it's like a story you have a character
[25:42] that says something a dialogue a
[25:43] screenplay
[25:44] in different events and you have the
[25:46] narration it gives out the very lines of
[25:48] redemption
[25:49] in this story of redemption and in
[25:51] looking at it this way as a conversation
[25:54] it helps us to understand really what
[25:56] ruth was deciding
[25:58] because it's not ah well i guess i've
[26:00] gone this far i don't want to be without
[26:02] you naomi
[26:03] there's something that unfolds in this
[26:04] conversation to me that's very very
[26:06] beautiful
[26:07] and it reveals just how deep the
[26:09] conversation is
[26:11] so we'll set the scene now it fades in
[26:13] and we're looking at a showdown
[26:15] and so here and i've kind of set it up
[26:17] to it looks just like it would
[26:18] if you were handed a script and i wish
[26:20] maybe brother travis was here to kind of
[26:21] clean it up beforehand
[26:23] as him sure he knows how to put together
[26:24] a script a lot better than me
[26:26] but now it says this this scene opens
[26:28] and i don't have it written in front of
[26:30] me when i do actually i have the
[26:31] original script i'll autograph it for
[26:32] anybody who'd like a copy
[26:34] orpa has turned back to moab so we're
[26:36] just setting the scene again
[26:38] and naomi's told ruth to do the same
[26:41] now that's our that's to say this is a
[26:43] showdown we're fading into this showdown
[26:45] and here's here's how it goes from here
[26:47] and ruth says
[26:48] do not urge me to leave you to go back
[26:51] from
[26:52] after you for i desire to be
[26:55] a proselyte this is how it's written
[26:58] from in
[26:58] into the from hebron to aramaic and so
[27:00] she's saying i desire to convert to
[27:02] judaism
[27:04] i want to now be bound to the to all
[27:07] your doctrine
[27:08] i want to be bound to the precepts of
[27:10] your faith that when she makes this
[27:12] statement
[27:12] that i don't don't encourage me anymore
[27:15] don't tell me
[27:16] and she says and treat me not to leave
[27:17] thee or to return from following after
[27:19] the
[27:20] she's saying i want to now convert
[27:23] i no longer want to be a mobile i want
[27:25] to convert and brother adam takes this
[27:26] phrase and he says
[27:27] the gentile church first seeing the
[27:30] promise of god
[27:32] making the statement to sell out from
[27:34] everything to follow jehovah god
[27:36] so guinea see this the gentile church
[27:39] even there in the beginning as it's
[27:40] leaving its ideology and its heathenisms
[27:43] and the reprobate
[27:44] and being the stranger and the gospel is
[27:46] turning to
[27:47] to gentiles and be brought to them by
[27:49] peter and paul
[27:50] and it's the gentile church being
[27:52] confronted with the promises of god
[27:54] in making the statement to sell out from
[27:56] everything to follow
[27:57] jehovah god and declare themselves to be
[28:00] converted to truth
[28:02] not to do judaism but to christianity to
[28:05] christ
[28:06] but here ruth and like figure saying do
[28:08] not urge me to leave to go back from
[28:09] after you for i desire to be a convert
[28:11] to your
[28:12] to your faith to to accept your
[28:14] doctrines to accept your precepts of
[28:16] faith
[28:17] and at the time there was different
[28:18] levels uh how you could be a
[28:20] uh uh be converted to the jury
[28:23] they're in the promised land but she's
[28:25] she's committing herself now saying
[28:27] i desire to follow thee not just i'm
[28:30] gonna go where you go
[28:31] and and and hopefully they you know
[28:33] hopefully i can get a green card no she
[28:35] wanted to become a full-fledged citizen
[28:38] and naomi said i catch this this is to
[28:41] me where this drama
[28:43] gets very very rich
[28:46] and naomi said you want to be a
[28:48] proselyte you want to come
[28:50] you want to join our church you you want
[28:51] to follow in this truth you want to be a
[28:53] convert
[28:54] we are commanded to keep sabbaths in
[28:56] holy days
[28:57] says that we may not walk more than two
[28:59] thousand cubits
[29:01] you find in the book of acts it said
[29:02] they went uh a sabbath day's journey
[29:04] from jerusalem back it was these two
[29:07] thousand cubits it's even the
[29:08] the measurement that joshua gave that
[29:10] they should follow behind the ark and so
[29:12] the the rabbis and through the rich
[29:14] tradition and teaching they came up with
[29:16] this distance that you could travel on
[29:18] the sabbath day
[29:20] and so this is the conversation that
[29:22] they're given in this translation
[29:24] you you want to be a convert well we are
[29:26] commanded to keep sabbath days and holy
[29:28] days
[29:28] such that we cannot journey or travel
[29:30] only so far
[29:32] and in exodus chapter 16 verse 21 it
[29:34] says see
[29:35] for that the lord hath given you the
[29:37] sabbath therefore he giveth you on the
[29:39] sixth day
[29:40] the bread of two days abide ye every man
[29:44] in his place let no man go out of his
[29:46] place
[29:47] on the seventh day this is the shabbat
[29:50] being instituted we're not to travel on
[29:52] the seventh day
[29:53] we cannot go out and collect bread on
[29:54] the seventh day it's the day holy unto
[29:56] the lord it's a day of rest
[29:57] and so naomi's telling ruth you want to
[30:00] be a convert well this is what our word
[30:02] says
[30:03] you want to follow after me you want to
[30:05] you want to do
[30:07] you want to say i don't argue with me
[30:09] anymore i'll go where i i
[30:11] don't try to argue with me and tell me
[30:13] to go back i want to be a convert he
[30:14] says if you want to be a convert
[30:16] we're commanded to keep the sabbath day
[30:18] holy even to the point where we can only
[30:20] travel so far
[30:20] and ruth says wherever you go i will go
[30:25] so it wasn't just her just rattling off
[30:27] you know hey don't tell me not to go
[30:29] wherever you go i'll go wherever you
[30:30] sleep i'll sleep and she's just kind of
[30:31] riffing
[30:32] dropping this little freestyle all of a
[30:34] sudden to ruth or to naomi and just
[30:36] coming up with things that sound good
[30:37] this was a conversation and i'm just
[30:39] using this uh as they amplify and i
[30:42] think it helps us to understand what
[30:43] ruth was declaring
[30:44] and to me it's it's likely that this
[30:47] unfolded more as a dialogue
[30:50] because now she's being provoked well
[30:51] you can only go so far and ruth says
[30:53] well i don't know enough but wherever
[30:55] you go i'll go
[30:57] whatever you're bound by i'm bound by
[31:00] now this is
[31:00] and i said well it kind of actually fell
[31:03] into the the trap i'm wanting you to
[31:04] avoid
[31:06] she was very specific in this instance
[31:08] if that's what you're bound by then i'll
[31:10] be bound by that so she says wherever
[31:13] you go
[31:14] i will go it wasn't without reference in
[31:18] other words this is what i'd like to
[31:19] emphasize to you it was not an
[31:21] abandonment to whatever
[31:24] but ruth's declaration was a a
[31:26] commitment
[31:27] to obey the word it was a declaration of
[31:30] obedience to the word of god to for her
[31:33] it was a declaration of obedience to the
[31:34] law that oh if that's in the law then
[31:36] i'll do that
[31:37] it wasn't well whatever you say naomi
[31:39] i'll do what you say but naomi said well
[31:41] our
[31:41] law says this and ruth said amen to that
[31:45] because when we give this declaration
[31:47] and we give this vow we're not just
[31:48] saying oh well whatever we'll do
[31:50] whatever
[31:51] such they say well we're committed
[31:52] brother aaron whatever wherever you go
[31:54] we'll go okay well let's not go to
[31:56] church anymore i would expect you to say
[31:58] sorry brother aaron that's where we part
[31:59] ways
[32:01] now you can let's not go to church
[32:03] anymore you can go wherever you want
[32:04] just be sure you send your ties to me
[32:07] none of you laughed why because you know
[32:08] it's true it happens
[32:11] or actually pastor will tell people you
[32:12] can go to another church you can go
[32:13] fellowship there you take your family go
[32:15] there stay there remain there
[32:16] terry there fellowship there become a
[32:18] part of it but why don't you keep paying
[32:19] your tithes
[32:20] ties to me that if there's got to come a
[32:23] point we realize what we're following
[32:24] is not man not personality not just
[32:28] family we're following the word of god
[32:30] so whatever the word says
[32:31] we say amen to so ruth and her response
[32:34] saying
[32:35] when she said wherever you go i will go
[32:37] the targum says that she says
[32:38] oh well you want to be a convert then
[32:40] you can't travel on the sabbath and even
[32:42] then you can only go so far and she says
[32:44] then wherever you go
[32:45] i'll go then naomi said
[32:49] we are commanded not to lodge with
[32:51] gentiles
[32:54] this is this is the this is the drama
[32:56] we're watching this is how it unfolds
[32:58] the very
[32:58] lines of redemption in acts chapter 10
[33:00] verse 28 it says and he said unto them
[33:02] you know how that it is an unlawful
[33:04] thing peter speaking
[33:05] an unlawful thing for a man that is a
[33:07] jew to keep company
[33:09] or to come unto one of another nation
[33:11] but god has shown me that i should not
[33:13] call any man
[33:14] common or unclean so peter makes
[33:16] reference to
[33:17] a law that says that it was unlawful for
[33:20] a jew
[33:21] to keep company with a stranger to come
[33:24] in and habitate with and we're not
[33:26] talking about having relations we're
[33:27] just talking about being in the same
[33:28] house
[33:30] do you find even in the book of john
[33:31] they would not go into the house of
[33:32] judgment unless they defiled themselves
[33:34] during the time of the passover
[33:35] and so they had to keep themselves even
[33:37] out of the house of a gentile
[33:39] i'm sorry i can't go in there are you a
[33:41] gentile sorry
[33:43] i can't even go in your house this is
[33:45] how strict the law was so
[33:47] here's naomi saying well we're commanded
[33:49] not to lodge with the gentiles and ruth
[33:50] said were you law java lodge
[33:53] see when you begin to look at how what
[33:55] she says wherever you go i'll go
[33:58] and where you lodge i will lodge it
[33:59] wasn't without some reference or
[34:01] it wasn't just some kind of comment just
[34:03] saying i'm completely abandoned
[34:04] wherever you go i'll go whatever
[34:06] wherever you lodge i'll lodge
[34:08] but there was some word attached to this
[34:10] declaration
[34:12] that if you can't travel on the sabbath
[34:13] then i won't travel on the sabbath if
[34:15] you can only go 2 000 cubits on the
[34:17] sabbath then i'll only go 2 000 cubits
[34:19] if you can't sleep in a gentile's home
[34:21] then i won't sleep in a gentile's home
[34:23] if that's what the word requires if
[34:25] that's what it takes to be a jew
[34:26] then i'm willing to do what it takes
[34:30] i think it makes i make i think it makes
[34:32] this vow in this declaration this
[34:34] clear-cut decision that we read in
[34:35] verses 16 and 17
[34:37] even more precious than if it was just
[34:38] hey whatever you do i'll do
[34:41] right because otherwise it could just be
[34:43] like someone who's just resigned
[34:45] you know we never get to go where i want
[34:46] to go anyway so what have you picked
[34:48] that's fine
[34:49] right this was deliberate as joshua gave
[34:53] made it
[34:53] brought him to a very conscious and
[34:54] deliberate decision in the showdown
[34:57] this is also naomi making ruth very
[34:59] aware
[35:00] look you want to be a convert it's not
[35:03] like you're going to be able to go back
[35:04] into bethlehem judah and keep doing
[35:05] everything you've ever done before
[35:08] and just we're going to hang out and
[35:09] it's all everything's going to be fine
[35:10] and dandy
[35:11] no this is different there's a different
[35:14] requirement so naomi said
[35:16] as we're kind of looking as we're
[35:17] commanded to keep the sabbaths well
[35:18] where you go i'll go and
[35:19] we're commanded not to lodge with the
[35:20] gentiles where you lodge allah comes
[35:22] back again
[35:23] we are commanded to keep 613
[35:26] commandments it's the mitzvah
[35:31] or the law of moses as it says in
[35:33] deuteronomy 33 4
[35:35] moses commanded us a law even the
[35:37] inheritance of the congregation of jacob
[35:40] and they say that moses gave 611
[35:42] commandments to uh to israel and then
[35:44] there's the
[35:45] two of the first commandments that god
[35:47] gave them
[35:49] when he spoke to them and they heard
[35:50] those two commandments that gives you
[35:51] 613 commandments that they've
[35:53] traditionally
[35:55] aggregated to believe that these are 613
[35:58] commandments that we must follow
[36:00] say when naomi ruth said ah i want to be
[36:03] a convert
[36:04] she says well you can only go certain
[36:06] places then i'll go where you go
[36:09] well you can only lodge certain places
[36:11] than all lodge where you lodge
[36:13] well we have to keep 613 commandments
[36:16] and it's interesting when you begin to
[36:18] look at these different commandments
[36:19] traditionally there's 365
[36:22] commandments to abstain from certain
[36:24] acts 365
[36:26] commandments not to do something and
[36:28] they say that's one for every day of the
[36:29] year
[36:31] and so there's 365 commandments they
[36:33] call them negative commandments
[36:35] not to do something and then there's 248
[36:37] commandments
[36:38] to perform an act so 365 which would
[36:41] represent
[36:41] every day of the year not to do
[36:43] something the negative commandments
[36:45] or 248 commandments to perform an act
[36:48] which they say is a positive commandment
[36:51] and so
[36:51] what's the 248 well i found where the
[36:53] jews say that it's a combination of
[36:55] the number of bones in our bodies and
[36:57] the main organs in our body
[37:00] so you have a negative commandment for
[37:02] 365 days 365 negative commandments that
[37:05] covers
[37:05] every day of our year and then you have
[37:07] these positive commandments 248 which
[37:09] covers every bone in your body
[37:11] and every main organ in your body 613
[37:14] commandments in total
[37:15] that you must keep in order to be a jew
[37:20] and ruth said whatever your people keep
[37:22] i will keep
[37:23] as if they were my people from before
[37:26] this
[37:28] so when she says your people will be my
[37:30] people
[37:33] it's more than just you know kind of
[37:36] they'll be my cousins i'll call him
[37:38] cousin i'll call him brother i'll call
[37:40] him sister no it was like you realize
[37:42] you're gonna have to keep 613
[37:43] commandments
[37:45] isn't it wonderful that when we came to
[37:47] christ it wasn't that we understood at
[37:49] all
[37:50] all the things we'd have to do all the
[37:52] things we'd give up
[37:53] all the things that would be expected of
[37:54] us maybe we could kind of read the room
[37:56] a little bit go it looks like i might
[37:57] have to wear a skirt to church
[37:59] looks like maybe i might have to grow my
[38:01] hair out guys look pretty normal i mean
[38:03] i might be all right my wife this can be
[38:04] tough on earth and isn't it just great
[38:07] that you just fall in love with him
[38:09] and it's something deep and something
[38:11] real so that whenever the
[38:12] the the word comes and says you ought
[38:15] not to do this you go well then i won't
[38:16] do it
[38:18] whenever the word comes and says that
[38:20] you ought to do this you say well then i
[38:21] will do it
[38:23] because that's what ruth did in this
[38:25] conversation in verses 16 and 17
[38:27] she gives this tremendous vow and
[38:29] declaration of
[38:31] uh where you go i will go where you
[38:33] lodge i will lodge and your people
[38:35] shall be my people there's there's a
[38:38] there's this
[38:38] in this other translation into the
[38:40] aramaic there's this conversation that's
[38:42] given this drama that's unfolding it's
[38:44] homolytic to where that's like well this
[38:45] challenge and that challenge and this
[38:47] statement and this response and she says
[38:49] your people will be my people as if i
[38:51] was raised in this
[38:52] as if this was my culture this was my
[38:54] belief if there's 613
[38:56] positive and negative commandments then
[38:58] for 365 days a year and with every bone
[39:01] and organ in my body
[39:02] i'll do the same that's beautiful
[39:07] naomi said we're commanded not to
[39:10] worship
[39:10] foreign gods in exodus 20 verses 3 to 5
[39:14] thou shalt not have other gods before me
[39:17] thou shalt not make unto thee any graven
[39:19] image or any likeness of
[39:21] anything that is in a heaven above or
[39:22] that is in the earth beneath
[39:24] that is in the water under the earth
[39:25] thou shalt not bow down thyself to them
[39:28] nor
[39:28] serve them for i the lord thy god am a
[39:30] jealous god visiting the iniquity of the
[39:32] fathers upon the children to the third
[39:34] and fourth generation
[39:35] of them that hate me i'm doing this to
[39:38] show you that with each
[39:39] interjection by naomi there's a word
[39:42] that it's attached to
[39:44] what it wasn't like naomi saying hey
[39:45] look if you're going to live in my house
[39:47] no corn fed beef right if you're going
[39:51] to live in my house then you know you're
[39:52] not you're not going to be able to
[39:54] drink diet coke we're pepsi only here
[39:57] that wasn't it
[39:58] right brother obed pepsi only that
[40:00] wasn't what that wasn't the declaration
[40:02] that was being made
[40:03] it was it could come back to the word it
[40:06] wasn't naomi laying down the house rules
[40:08] for how that they would get along and
[40:09] cohabitate
[40:10] in bethlehem judah well if you're coming
[40:12] with me then this is the way you're
[40:13] going to realize right now i get the
[40:14] master bedroom
[40:15] and you're not going to do this and
[40:16] you're not going to do that and you're
[40:17] going to have to do your own year and
[40:19] we're going to split the utilities
[40:20] you're going to pay half the rent
[40:21] she just kept coming back to the word
[40:23] and with each one as i read from exodus
[40:25] and the book of acts and deuteronomy and
[40:27] again in exodus thou shalt have no other
[40:29] gods before me when naomi said
[40:31] and we are commanded not to worship
[40:33] foreign gods that's the word coming up
[40:35] before roof
[40:37] naomi even representing this word
[40:39] challenging ruth leading ruth geinerth
[40:41] and ruth says your god is my god
[40:46] are you i is this opening up to you and
[40:49] maybe just a small
[40:50] way just maybe a little bit more a
[40:52] different angle a different side to it
[40:54] just to see when she says and treat me
[40:55] not to leave there or to return
[40:56] from following after thee where you go
[40:58] i'll go where you lodge outlaws your
[41:00] people shall be my people and thy god my
[41:02] god there's so much more
[41:04] that ruth is declaring in this moment
[41:09] verse 17 naomi said
[41:13] this one i thought was very interesting
[41:14] we have four death penalties for the
[41:16] guilty
[41:17] i've just told you that you can't travel
[41:19] so far on the sabbath
[41:21] you should remain in your place you can
[41:25] you can't lodge with the gentiles
[41:27] there's 613 commandments that you must
[41:29] follow
[41:29] and you can't worship any foreign gods
[41:32] and
[41:32] by the way we have four different types
[41:34] of death if you violate these things
[41:37] stoning with stones burning with fire
[41:39] execution or beheading by the sword
[41:41] and strangulation are hanging on a tree
[41:45] and i actually began to find all these
[41:47] places in the old testament
[41:49] where it talked about burning and
[41:50] stoning and being killed at the edge of
[41:52] the sword
[41:54] and wow there's some pretty remarkable
[41:57] stuff out there
[41:58] that they ride into the and deep dive
[42:00] very very deeply into these things and
[42:02] actually some that has
[42:03] worked its way into court cases and
[42:05] arguments of what was
[42:06] neces what's correct for capital
[42:08] punishment and what manner of death
[42:10] ought to be used to execute the guilty
[42:12] so very
[42:13] very interesting maybe from a legal
[42:14] standpoint even a theological standpoint
[42:16] but i don't feel there needs to be much
[42:17] amplification of it we know their
[42:19] stonings
[42:20] for the guilty we know that there was uh
[42:23] burning
[42:24] of the guilty a priest daughter she
[42:26] defiled herself she was to be burned
[42:28] there was that execution with the edge
[42:30] of the sword the beheading we know that
[42:32] there was hanging strangulation
[42:33] that each one of these capital
[42:34] punishments were given and naomi
[42:36] how what a sweet conversation at the
[42:38] borderline right
[42:39] we're getting ready to go through
[42:40] immigration do you have your passport
[42:42] ready just want you to know
[42:43] before you present your papers you could
[42:45] be hung if you worship another god
[42:48] it's very sober and we always wait right
[42:50] to the right before you you're going to
[42:51] cross
[42:52] paths through immigration and you're
[42:53] going to be showing your papers like you
[42:54] better straighten up don't say anything
[42:55] don't laugh
[42:56] don't joke around let me answer the
[42:57] questions right
[42:59] if they ask if we have anything in our
[43:00] suitcases let me answer the question
[43:02] and this is the time everything's
[43:03] getting you know everything's getting
[43:04] serious now it's all burnt up
[43:06] and this is exactly what naomi's doing i
[43:08] guess just to create
[43:09] this great excitement for roof right
[43:11] you're looking forward to bethlehem
[43:13] judah did you know you could be
[43:14] there's capital punishment four
[43:15] different ways
[43:17] you know what ruth says how you die i
[43:19] shall die
[43:21] if that's what your word says then
[43:23] that's what your word says
[43:25] it wasn't just when she's given this
[43:28] declaration
[43:29] where thou diest will i die it was how
[43:31] you die
[43:33] what by whatever means you're judged
[43:36] by whatever determination is made
[43:40] by your god then i accept that
[43:43] she says how you die i shall die and so
[43:46] naomi said
[43:47] we have a cemetery three cubits
[43:51] we have very specific rules our house of
[43:53] burial there's a way that we're buried
[43:54] you say you're going to die how i die
[43:56] did you know you just can't be buried in
[43:58] any way in our religion that it not only
[44:00] does it govern
[44:01] with the negative commandments 365 days
[44:03] a year and the positive commandments
[44:05] every bone and organ in your body
[44:07] and not only can you not worship any god
[44:08] you want and not only can you only
[44:10] travel two thousand cubits on a saturday
[44:12] and you can be killed if you violate
[44:13] certain provisions in our law and then
[44:15] once you're dead you have to be buried a
[44:16] certain way
[44:19] i mean just in this few statements it's
[44:21] covering everything
[44:24] your entire life ruth is going to change
[44:27] everything how you live how you die
[44:30] and if you think it ends then even how
[44:32] you're buried
[44:34] and so what does ruth say and there i
[44:37] will be buried
[44:40] then fine that's where i'll be buried
[44:44] i'll go where the word says go
[44:48] i'll serve with the word says serve i'll
[44:50] obey what the word says obey
[44:52] i accept the consequences if i don't i
[44:55] will suffer the death
[44:57] that's required and then wherever it
[44:59] buries me i bury it buries me
[45:02] that's selling out that's what brandon's
[45:04] talking about uh
[45:05] someone making a decision not just kind
[45:06] of halfway borderline it's like i'm all
[45:08] in
[45:10] here it is if we're going to use a
[45:13] showdown all my chips are in
[45:15] these are my cards here whatever the
[45:17] rules are
[45:18] here i am judge me i'm willing to do it
[45:20] and there will i be buried and then she
[45:22] says
[45:22] and do not say anymore and to me this is
[45:25] kind of what
[45:26] amplifies the the dialogue here we have
[45:28] four death penalties well where you die
[45:30] all dying
[45:30] you're going to be buried in a certain
[45:32] place then bury me where i'm supposed to
[45:33] be buried she says
[45:34] do not say anymore may the lord do thus
[45:38] to me
[45:38] and more against me if even death shall
[45:41] separate me from you
[45:44] the way that it's translated it's not
[45:45] even a separation in death
[45:47] it's not till death do we part it's may
[45:50] i suffer
[45:51] may he inflict any of these punishments
[45:53] on me and any worse punishment
[45:57] if i ever separate from these things no
[46:00] matter what it is
[46:02] it's not even till death we part but
[46:03] even in death if i am not
[46:05] buried where you're buried according to
[46:07] your word according to your law
[46:09] according to your customs then may the
[46:11] lord inflict any punishment on me
[46:13] and any worse punishment than these
[46:14] things that you have said of these death
[46:16] penalties of stoning and
[46:17] burning and beheading and strangulation
[46:20] let him inflict any of these punishments
[46:22] and worse on me
[46:23] if i would ever deviate from this word
[46:27] quite a declaration that when we read it
[46:30] entreat me not to leave thee or to
[46:31] return from following after me
[46:33] for wither thou goest i will go and
[46:34] where thou law just i will watch
[46:36] thy people shall be my people and thy
[46:38] god my god where thou
[46:39] die will i die and there will i be
[46:41] buried the lord do so to me and more
[46:43] also
[46:43] if ought but death part thee in me
[46:46] can i just read it again as this
[46:48] dialogue do not urge me to leave you to
[46:50] go back from after you for i desire to
[46:52] be a proselyte
[46:53] well we're commanded to keep sabbath's
[46:55] holy days such that we may not walk more
[46:57] than 2 000 cubits then where you go i'll
[46:59] go
[47:00] well we're commanded not to lodge with
[47:01] gentiles where you lodge our laws we're
[47:03] commanded to keep 613 commandments
[47:06] what your people keep i will keep as if
[47:08] they were my people from before this
[47:09] well we're commanded not to worship
[47:11] foreign gods your god
[47:12] is my god we have four death penalties
[47:14] for guilt for the guilty
[47:15] stoning with stones burning with fire
[47:17] execution by the sword
[47:19] and hanging on a tree how you die i
[47:21] shall die well we can only be buried in
[47:23] a cemetery of three cubits
[47:25] then there i'll be buried and do not say
[47:28] any more
[47:29] may the lord do thus to me and more
[47:30] against me if even death shall separate
[47:32] me from you
[47:35] and then it says in verse 18 when she
[47:37] saw
[47:39] that she was determined to go with her
[47:41] she ended the conversation
[47:43] with her showdown
[47:47] when she saw okay all right maybe the
[47:50] sabbath day
[47:51] yeah maybe someone would say well i
[47:53] won't go to the store on the sabbath day
[47:54] all right fine i can only go two
[47:56] thousand cubits
[47:57] okay well i know i'll only worship one
[47:59] god but with each one
[48:00] there was nothing in the word that
[48:02] caused ruth to stumble
[48:04] she just kept saying amen to the word
[48:07] and so then in this showdown at this
[48:08] point
[48:09] when naomi saw that she was determined
[48:12] when in our king james version it's
[48:14] steadfastly minded courageous strong
[48:17] convinced when she saw that she was
[48:20] determined to go with her this could be
[48:21] the narrator
[48:22] she ended the conversation with her and
[48:24] the scene fades out
[48:26] there's the end of the showdown this is
[48:28] the point at which ruth has made the
[48:30] declaration
[48:31] she has sold out she has committed she's
[48:33] going all the way
[48:35] she was determined steadfastly minded
[48:38] as they made reference in the beginning
[48:40] and we're just gonna we'll just close
[48:41] here on this brother micah wants to just
[48:42] get ready
[48:44] in hebrews chapter 11 verse 8.
[48:49] hebrews chapter 11 verse 8 it says by
[48:50] faith abraham
[48:52] when he was called to go out into a
[48:54] place which he should after receive for
[48:56] an inheritance
[48:57] obeyed what was he told in the scripture
[49:00] get up and go
[49:02] to land that i'll show you here after
[49:04] and what did abraham do
[49:06] tell me where i'm going first
[49:10] he just upped right he got up
[49:13] he did it by faith when he was called to
[49:15] go into a place which he should after
[49:17] receive for inheritance get up and go to
[49:18] a place i'll show you here after
[49:20] says he obeyed and he went out not
[49:22] knowing whether he went
[49:25] and i want to use i want to use the
[49:27] faith of abraham
[49:29] as the faith that ruth had because fruth
[49:32] is making this decision
[49:34] by faith and and even as she makes this
[49:38] declaration orpah says
[49:39] goodbye naomi see you later orpah
[49:42] cleaves to naomi
[49:44] and it's this instinct no no
[49:48] i want to go with you she says no no my
[49:51] daughter-in-law
[49:52] just go back your sister's gone
[49:55] now you go she says oh no no please
[49:58] please
[50:00] uh i'll be i want to be a jew i want to
[50:02] be like you naomi and she says oh really
[50:05] well did you know we have a law that on
[50:07] the sabbath you can only go 2 000 cubits
[50:09] where you go i'll go well did you know
[50:11] you can't even sleep with your family
[50:12] anymore that you you'll have to separate
[50:14] from your family you can't even lodge
[50:15] you can't even go in the house you can't
[50:16] even dwell
[50:17] with the gentile where you lodge a lodge
[50:21] oh did you know you can't worship any
[50:22] other gods i'll have no other gods
[50:24] before me your god will be my god did
[50:26] you know
[50:26] there's 613 commandments you'll have to
[50:29] follow that's 365 with every bone and
[50:31] organ in your body
[50:33] i'll serve your god as if it was the way
[50:36] i was raised your people would be my
[50:38] people
[50:38] well did you know there's four different
[50:40] penalties if you don't keep them
[50:41] then i'll die how your word says i die
[50:44] and then if you die you have to be
[50:46] buried a certain way then bury me the
[50:47] way your words just bury me
[50:50] it was an unfolding thing but in it
[50:53] there was nothing
[50:54] that could stumble ruth because it was
[50:56] by faith
[50:58] there wasn't a point at which name it
[50:59] could say oh and by the way you can't
[51:01] mix your cottons with your linens
[51:03] and ruth is like that's it i'm out i'm
[51:06] very bohemian
[51:07] i like to dress how i want to dress and
[51:09] that's not going to work for me
[51:12] hold wait for me if that's what the word
[51:15] says
[51:16] i'll do it that's what the word says
[51:18] i'll do it
[51:19] that's what abraham said god you want me
[51:20] to get up you want me to go then i'll go
[51:23] and by faith he went out he obeyed by
[51:25] faith by instinct by faith
[51:27] not knowing whether he went brother
[51:29] makes this statement about
[51:30] ruth it's so beautiful and why little
[51:32] bethlehem but ruth said i will not go
[51:34] back and notice what he identifies faith
[51:36] rooted grounded perfect faith had come
[51:40] unto ruth's heart
[51:42] that's what i want you to recognize
[51:43] tonight it was what rooted in faith's
[51:45] heart
[51:46] was perv it was faith that's what had
[51:49] come into ruth's heart
[51:51] because truly as this conversation and
[51:53] targum relates it ruth doesn't really
[51:55] know all that awaits for her
[51:58] she doesn't know what her days hold she
[52:00] doesn't know what promises
[52:01] are there for her she doesn't know what
[52:02] remedies are available to her she
[52:04] doesn't fully understand all 613
[52:06] she doesn't understand everything that
[52:08] may be necessary but as she goes on this
[52:10] journey it makes this declaration
[52:12] naomi begins to share with her and what
[52:14] is it that meets the challenge in every
[52:15] single instance
[52:16] faith does because what it rooted and
[52:19] grounded in her heart
[52:20] was faith and if it's a perfect faith
[52:23] let me just say it this way
[52:24] perfect faith is the faith that you need
[52:26] for the moment of the showdown that
[52:28] you're in
[52:29] it's the faith that meets the challenge
[52:31] that you're in she exhibited a faith a
[52:33] perfect faith for that moment but we'll
[52:35] see as she goes forward
[52:36] her faith keeps answering the bell her
[52:39] faith keeps answering the challenge
[52:41] and her faith brings her to that union
[52:42] and that conception
[52:45] and your faith is going to do the same
[52:46] for you why because it's not just
[52:49] a faith it's not just a moab thing it's
[52:51] not just a family thing it's not a
[52:52] personality thing
[52:53] but it's something rooted in your heart
[52:56] it's coming to your heart
[52:58] and ruth doesn't know what awaits her
[53:01] but as we said last time this is the
[53:02] thought that just struck me at the very
[53:04] beginning
[53:05] a couple weeks ago when i began to look
[53:06] at a showdown is the only justification
[53:09] that ruth had for what she was doing
[53:11] was faith that's the only justification
[53:14] she had
[53:15] orpha could say i don't know ruth have
[53:17] you thought about this
[53:19] right they kind of orpah kind of looks
[53:21] over at ruth
[53:23] they kind of slow down a little bit
[53:24] naomi kind of gets a little bit ahead
[53:26] and oprah's
[53:30] remember some of those things our
[53:31] husbands talked about if you noticed
[53:34] really
[53:34] how naomi lives like it was always so
[53:37] different
[53:38] like are you ready are you real i mean
[53:40] don't you think it's a little funny
[53:42] yeah i mean yeah it was what our
[53:44] husbands believed but they didn't even
[53:46] really fully believe it or they never
[53:47] would have married us
[53:48] this conversation begins to unfold and
[53:51] and ruth could be like
[53:52] yeah you know it's a good point
[53:56] what were they doing anyways in moab and
[53:58] now why do we even need to go back
[53:59] doesn't this seem like there's a bunch
[54:00] of inconsistencies here
[54:03] and with quebec yeah yeah i mean i see
[54:06] what you're saying but
[54:07] i think i'm gonna go upon what basis
[54:14] faith i don't have anything else to go
[54:17] on orpha
[54:19] i just know that something inside of me
[54:21] is stirring me
[54:23] something inside of me is moving me this
[54:25] is home to me this is real this is truth
[54:28] this is where i belong i i'm i'm willing
[54:30] to go all the way well i don't think i
[54:32] can go all the way with you
[54:33] that's fine but i'm gonna go
[54:38] and the only justification ruth could
[54:39] give was faith
[54:40] [Music]
[54:42] faith was drawing her in its faith that
[54:45] justified her
[54:47] never forget that ruth never forget that
[54:51] it's your faith that's drama
[54:54] let's stand tonight a showdown
[55:08] [Music]
[55:19] let's just offer a prayer thanksgiving
[55:21] to him tonight
[55:23] that it's his faith his faith
[55:26] that's kept us what a grace by grace are
[55:29] you saved through faith
[55:31] and both are gifts of god heavenly
[55:35] father
[55:37] i thank you that
[55:40] we've had these highlights given to us
[55:42] these nuggets that have been
[55:44] laid before us that point us to truths
[55:48] [Music]
[55:50] and i've zero in on certain things about
[55:52] this great story and we've been able to
[55:54] identify ourselves in it
[55:58] and lord i know that the people gathered
[56:00] here tonight those that are listening to
[56:01] the archive or even streaming live
[56:04] identify so perfectly with ruth tonight
[56:10] in their own journey in their own path
[56:13] they realize that all along when they
[56:15] didn't have answers even when they
[56:17] thought they had answers that all along
[56:18] it was faith that justified them
[56:22] it's faith that alone is their
[56:23] justification for following
[56:27] for ask how else could ruth accept 613
[56:31] commandments that she didn't even know
[56:34] how else could she conceive the shabbat
[56:38] and 2000 cubits
[56:41] how else could she accept four different
[56:43] types of capital punishment how much
[56:45] could she accept
[56:46] a certain manner of burial unless faith
[56:48] said
[56:50] if it's the word i accepted
[56:53] unless somehow deep inside her faith had
[56:55] rooted a perfect faith it grounded in
[56:57] her
[56:58] heart and said that this is
[57:01] truth this is right this is
[57:03] righteousness this is
[57:04] what i long for this is what's going to
[57:06] make me whole whatever it is this
[57:08] bethlehem judah whatever's required of
[57:10] me whatever awaits me i accept it
[57:12] and i'll receive it
[57:15] and lord i believe that we as believers
[57:18] have caught a vision of this message
[57:21] as it's presented itself to us we've
[57:23] continued to say amen
[57:25] and in our journey we've had difficult
[57:26] conversations with the orpah
[57:29] i learned it when we it got separated at
[57:31] the end of the day and all got laid out
[57:32] on the table and there was a showdown at
[57:34] the end of the day we just simply said
[57:36] i believe i believe by faith i believe
[57:40] christ is leading me
[57:43] i believe at the end of day that he's
[57:45] speaking to my heart that he's given me
[57:47] this blessed promise it's his voice
[57:49] i hear lord this is not just a blind
[57:52] adherence to a man who says i'm a
[57:56] prophet of god
[57:57] and we say oh you're a prophet we'll go
[57:59] wherever you go and we'll sleep wherever
[58:00] you sleep and
[58:01] we'll believe whatever you believe but
[58:03] no lord he showed us the word
[58:05] and we said we believe that and then he
[58:07] showed us the word we said we believe
[58:09] that
[58:09] and it hasn't just some it's not some
[58:11] blind loyalty to an ideology it's not a
[58:14] blind loyalty to a personality
[58:16] it's not a blind loyalty to a church
[58:18] it's an individual commitment to truth
[58:21] and i believe that's what's represented
[58:23] here at arizona believer's church i
[58:25] believe that's what's represented within
[58:26] these four walls
[58:27] of this hilton garden inn is not a
[58:29] discipline to one another not a
[58:31] commitment to a church name
[58:32] not a not a union of a family but
[58:35] individual
[58:36] commitments to obey your word and it's
[58:38] your word that's leading us
[58:40] and it's your spirit that has actually
[58:41] brought us together
[58:44] and that's why we can have fellowship
[58:48] and lord is ruth stood there that day in
[58:51] a showdown
[58:54] she answered each
[58:57] objection with the word of god
[59:01] an amen an amen and an amen
[59:06] lord may we do so may we do so lord as
[59:10] your bride
[59:13] respond in a showdown just like she did
[59:17] not to reason well naomi
[59:21] what is 2000 cubits and where does it
[59:23] begin and just how far can i go
[59:26] do you really need to keep it is that
[59:27] just a man's idea and is this just
[59:29] something some man came up with she said
[59:31] amen
[59:34] lord she didn't she didn't try to trifle
[59:36] with it and argue and try to figure out
[59:39] where it came from and whether or not it
[59:40] was substantiated faith answered each
[59:42] time
[59:42] where you go i'll go where you lodge all
[59:44] lodge your people be my people
[59:47] your god will be my god how you die i'll
[59:50] die
[59:51] how you're buried i'm buried
[59:54] i've made my decision
[59:58] i've decided may we have a
[1:00:01] rekindling of that decision tonight
[1:00:04] give us a renewed vigor lord for the
[1:00:07] choices that we've made
[1:00:09] we're not gonna waver as a church lord
[1:00:12] we're not gonna waver wavers individuals
[1:00:13] are not going to waver
[1:00:15] lord if we run into difficulties and and
[1:00:17] circumstances
[1:00:19] inhibit us in some way lord we know
[1:00:20] we've made our decision
[1:00:22] what a weighted roof was difficult
[1:00:24] journeys and passages maybe even thieves
[1:00:26] along the way and a hard road to follow
[1:00:29] and the heat and whatever the elements
[1:00:30] may have been that would be attacking
[1:00:32] them in this harvest time
[1:00:33] that would keep them from making their
[1:00:35] making it at their destination she had a
[1:00:36] steadfast
[1:00:38] decision and she had a made-up mind
[1:00:42] she was gonna make it and may we today
[1:00:44] have a rekindling of the vision that we
[1:00:46] have we've caught a vision
[1:00:48] we've got a made up mind we're going all
[1:00:50] the way with you lord
[1:00:52] bless us tonight i pray may this be an
[1:00:54] encouragement to your people
[1:00:55] in the name of the lord jesus christ we
[1:00:57] pray amen
