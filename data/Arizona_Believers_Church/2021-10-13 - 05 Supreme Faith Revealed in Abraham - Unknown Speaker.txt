TRANSCRIPT
========================================
genesis chapter 22 i'm going to read verses 8 to 12. i'm not planning on reading these verses again um so i want this just to be another reminder of what we're looking at in that abraham's faith reached its fullest supreme expression when he offered up isaac as a sacrifice so genesis chapter 22 verse 8 and abraham said my son god will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering so they went both of them together and they came to the place which god had told him of and abraham built an altar there and laid the wood in order and bound isaac his son and laid him on the altar upon the wood and abraham stretched forth his hand and took the knife to slay his son and the angel lord called untim out of heaven and said abraham abraham and he said here am i and he said lay not thy hand upon the lad neither do thou anything unto him for now i know that thou fierst god seeing thou hast not withheld thy son thy only son from me let's pray jesus we're so grateful to be gathered together this evening in your presence and we are especially encouraged that by way of worship it washed our spirits and it encouraged us and despite whatever heaviness that we might have experienced or even the things that of tomorrow that seemed to encumber our minds we just felt a little bit of relief in praising you and worship in you and we're grateful for that father and as you have come and made your presence felt tonight we ask that you'd now take the bread of life and rightly divide it to our hearts and we need encouragement lord we need instruction we need direction and we're living in a time where it just seems as if we're not able to outrun the shadow of the pandemic we're not able to find um all the positive markers in the economy things are very confusing right now in the world whether it be markets or economies or social issues entertainment lord whatever it might be it's a very confusing time and where we find our strength lord is in the clarity of your word we ask father that we can just turn our eyes away from all the things that are messed up in laodicea and just look to you in this bright age for clarity for comfort and for strength we commit this time to you now father as you your presence has been felt we believe you've received our worship now father speak to us through your word we pray in jesus name amen you can be seated tonight i'm trusting that i'll be able to um kind of wrap up the foundation foundational thought on the subject of supreme faith revealed in abraham and what we've been looking at even from the very beginning even though we might not have expressed it in these terms is how that his faith is an example of rapturing faith and the very simple theme that i'm wanting to identify is how that his faith progressed through the routine of daily trusting god's god's word to him god's promises to him and so his his faith became strong and it increased by just taking god at his word day by day and though we just see his life over the span of several chapters and we have a lot of significant events that are recorded and visitations of god that are recorded there's a way that you can look into abraham's life and realize that he's living a life which is very much like the lives of families that would have been existing at the time but what made him different was this presence of god in his life in this following the supernatural promise and following this supernatural being and we're looking specifically how that his obedience in genesis chapter 22 was his faith coming to his perfection and we've been identifying how the especially in that his faith is an example of rapture and faith is that his obedience was based on a revelation of god's character that he was not just merely obeying god because of the authority and i'm very careful in expressing this because i'm really wanting hoping that at this point realize we're looking at a matured time in abraham's life whereas he might have initially obeyed god because he recognized this to be something beyond him a supernatural being he begins to obey and you obey because of the authority but then through time you you should begin to understand what is in the heart of the one who has the authority what is in the heart of the one that is getting given me this command and so abraham wasn't just blindly following god but by the time he offers up his son upon the altar to sacrifice him he has a revelation of god's power and what he's able to do and abraham believed specifically he believed that god was able to resurrect isaac so he wasn't just going there saying well god told me to kill my son so i guess i'm just going to kill him he understood something about the nature of god's promises to him and the nature of god to there was this resurrection and this power over death that he had before him and he could go saying i've already written witnessed according to scripture we could say that abraham's testimony would have been i've already witnessed a resurrection in my own dead body i've already witnessed a resurrection in the dead womb of my wife sarah so and god said it's going to be through isaac that this seed is going to come and isaac without any progeny and isaac uh without any in those that would inherit his legacy he just knew according to the revelation that isaac would have to be resurrected that god was able to reckon that god would be able to raise him from the dead and what preceded abraham's walk up mount moriah this this climax this showdown of his faith was that god had been visiting him and making himself known and that's why jesus says in john chapter 8 that your father abraham rejoiced to see my day he had this longing expectation to see the time that the messiah would be revealed to his seed but then he says and he saw it and was glad so there's something about the experience of abraham that allowed him to actually see christ and see a manifestation in revelation of jesus christ and it caused him to rejoice it gave him excitement and we asked the question on sunday what did abraham see and jesus is going to say that um he he rejoiced to see my day and he saw it and was glad what did he see he saw melchizedek in genesis 14. uh he saw the lord come to him in the plains of memory there in the days of lot in genesis 18. and these are scriptures that we ought to be familiar with and i think we are very familiar with them and and we're going to be actually reading from a couple spots just very kind of kind of just going over um just on the surface level that the lord would lead us to go deeper i would absolutely love that but i just want to kind of cover just the tops of it here's the lord making himself known in genesis 14 in melchizedek then it's the lord appearing to him in genesis 18 in the days of lot there in the plains of memory and this is how jesus can look back and say abraham saw me he saw this manifestation of god and so in the sermon who is this melchizedek brother man says when abraham met him he was melchizedek and then he makes this statement and i think this statement is um kind of follows in the channel of maybe a dozen statements by now that we've read where brother said he's an example he was an example his life typifies something he says he unfolds here what all the attributes and you're an attribute of god right what all the attributes will do in the final day every son of abraham so every bride member can see what's going to be done unto them what will be hap but they'll see what they'll witness what they'll experience in the end it's unfolding in the life of abraham every son of faith will absolutely do the same thing he's going to have this experience to see this revelation but i want to watch how we have to come and so there's a process where he's saying this is what's going to happen and he's somehow we have to come and he even gets into and i wanted to use the statement tonight how he's looking at the life of abraham and he says we see here our journey and where we go when we die and we see our whole journey from election and predestination death burial resurrection it's all typified and seen in the life of abraham but he identifies it and points it out that we are going to be walking in this pattern of abraham in the end time and when we look at genesis chapter 18 and i know this is review but even uh when i looked at a lot of the things i wanted to share tonight i'm finishing up what we didn't get to on sunday um the service just kind of went a direction well i didn't really finish what i had on my heart to finish so i'm kind of recapping some of these things and i appreciate just the welcoming spirit to be able to do this uh but in genesis chapter 18 verse 14. the question is asked the lord appears unto abraham and he says is there anything too hard for the lord that gives us comfort in a time of trouble the day that we're living in now when everything seems to be absolutely impossible and it's very difficult for us to believe for small things and minor things and just simple things let alone a body change he says is anything too hard for the lord he says at the time appointed i will return to thee according to the time of life and sarah shall have a son and here's the promise of visitation of the lord he's making himself known to abraham and he says that according to the time of life and an appointed time a time for resurrection a time for change a time for the deadness of abraham's body to be overcome a time for the deadness of sarah's womb to be revived i'm going to come when deadness is conquered and the promise that i've made to you is going to be fulfilled i'm going to visit you and i'm going to see this promise through and so in these statements that we've been looking at in the from the message of the hour and the pattern of the scripture or the statements in scripture we're looking at how the abraham's life has a pattern of the rapture of the bride it holds this pattern we can begin to look and i'll say this now because i've been kind of looking at it that when i say it holds the pattern i i we don't want to get very just try to type everything out say oh well then when god said abram that's when i came to the message and then when i moved then when i did went over here when i was in this church i was i was kind of there still with my father and my brother uh in this other in in on and and then when i separated from that and i went into this other church and there i was in the promised land but then i got mixed up in this and i had to separate from my nephew and and try to just walk it all out chronologically it's not going to work right and i think sometimes when we do that we find we justify why we find ourselves in babylon we say well abraham went to egypt and and so we're not trying to strictly unfold it chronologically but what we see is different things manifest in the life of abraham not necessarily chronologically but different things are manifest and even with the change of his name being a type of adoption and we see these different things happening and and we can pull these things out from different vantage points and perspective and see that it's a mosaic of the way that god deals with his children and it can actually be placed in an order for us where we are today but we're not just trying to say from day one to the end of his life we're all following the same pattern but there's glimpses and types and ways that god dealt with abraham that we see unfolding for us and so this is a hit we see a pattern of the rapture in the life of abraham and so tonight i'm just kind of tying up some loose ends and hoping to finalize um the foundation on this we're saying supreme faith revealed in abraham the supreme faith is rapturing faith and he's an example of our faith in the end time in this that faith is specifically a rapturing faith because we've got to have that kind of faith in this end time that's what's required and it being required we're looking at how that's kind of looking at the life of everything in the life of abraham these events in genesis chapter 22 express a type of the bride's rapturing faith but what my desire to do and it might just be a couple services where we do it is look at abraham more from the human perspective and the things that he went through and identify how this faith increased and i want to read one more statement before we step forward in this brother bram says our bodies will have to be changed as we're looking as life is a pattern of the rapture our bodies will have to be changed we just can't turn back to young men and women we've got to have a different kind of body so you can be caught in the air to receive the promised son brother branham revisits the same issue i believe in true easter seal and touches on it in another place to where he's saying that it's not just a matter of all of us all of us sudden us just kind of being young again but they're actually we need something else something has to take place so this body has to be changed so you can be caught in the air to receive the promised son that's what the church is waiting for now the true church so what we're waiting for now is the change of our bodies there's got to be some faith come because think about it this way rapturing faith is faith to what brother taught us faith to change your body you'll have to have power to change your body then we meet the lord in the air so when you recognize this pattern in this order it's and i don't want you to be uh uh be very strict in your thought process to catch what i'm trying to say that we're not we we don't have a faith just waiting for the lord to come in this and what we might call the second coming and then jesus is coming and we see jesus coming and that kind of and even especially i'm referring to maybe more denominational idea of what the coming of the lord will be like and then that's going to instigate rapturing faith when we see the lord in the air and it's going to kind of instigate this faith to change our bodies when you see the order as we are taught it in the word of god there has to come a faith for our bodies to be changed then we go to meet the lord in the air and so he's saying this is what the church is waiting for so there has to be something come to produce the faith for the change but then he says every manifestation what he did to abraham he's done to his seat after him leaving one thing out that's the rapture of the church now statement like that kind of includes the way that he revealed himself to the natural seed of abraham in the days of the messiah when he revealed himself in flesh to to his the seed of abraham and he's just saying that how god manifested himself to abraham he does to the seed of abraham and so what he does to abraham he does to the seed of abraham and we as the royal seed of abraham have a promise to us and then he says leaving one thing out one thing has not happened he says the rapture of the church this is this climax and the summation of the ages and so he when he says every manifestation what he did to abraham he's done every manifestation there are specific promises and i feel very comfortable that this falls on a wednesday night because you're you know these things being in message yourselves there's certain manifestations that are promised to the royal seed certain prophecies in the scripture that we believe to be very dear to our hearts things that we've recognized things that have been manifested to us things that we desire that would still be recognized by others things things that people need to grasp and they need to kept catch a true revelation of these things but they're specific promises of a manifestation of god to the royal seed and this is what he's referring to and so there's a promised revealing reveal unto the son of man there's a promise unfolding even if you want to say a promise to visitation uh before the meeting in the air before our bodies are changed and in genesis chapter 14 i read from genesis chapter 14 hebrews 7 and also genesis 18. when he says every manifestation i just want to quickly look at these manifestations of god to abraham and realize that in some way we need to have these same type of revelations and he says in genesis chapter 14 verses 17 to 19. i'm just going to skip over kind of the background for it but abraham takes 318 servants and he goes out and defeats five kings uh quite a pretty good group of uh a servants um and he's returning from the slaughter of the kings he's returning from this great uh battle this great victory of rescuing lot and the king of sodom which is the king of burning went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter uh kerala dalmar and he says and the kings that were with him at the valle chavez which is the kings dale and melchizedek king of salem now this is not the king of sodom but the king of salem melchizedek king of salem brought forth bread and wine here the king of salem is serving him communion the man talks about how this is a type of how after the battle we'll sit down with him in the wedding supper he'll service melchizedek king of salem brought forth bread and wine and he was the priest of the most high god and he blessed him and said blessed be abraham of the most high god possessor of heaven and earth and so here is melchizedek king of salem and let's just read quickly hebrews chapter 7 verses 1 to 2 just to see how paul comes back to it and visits who this melchizedek king of salem is for this melchizedek king of salem priest of the most high god who met abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him to whom also abraham gave a tenth part of all first being by interpretation king of righteousness and after that also king of salem which is king of peace so who is this melchizedek who is it that abraham meets in genesis chapter 14 this melchizedek king of salem it wasn't there what jerusalem didn't exist at this time and it's this uh very striking figure that abraham meets and he's blessed he's the priest of the most high god this is before any kind of priesthood has been instituted and he says that and we're taught that jesus christ paul teaching that jesus christ was made a high priest after the order of melchizedek and so who is this melchizedek it's the lord this melchizedek is it's the lord it's god himself this is who abraham meets after this slaughter and he has it's characterized and described in this interaction but here melchizedek king of salem comes and makes himself known to abraham and he blesses him and abraham's giving tithing he's giving a tenth part of all um to him instead of him taking what the king of sodom wanted to offer here's abram giving a tenth part to the king king of salem melchizedek and then he's described also as the priest of the most high god king and priest who is this it's the lord it's god himself and he makes this appearance to abraham then in genesis chapter 18 verse 1 and it says and the lord appeared to him in the plains of mammary the lord appeared to him in the plains of memory i'm just using this first part of this verse in verse 3 abraham sees him and says my lord he's calling him adonai he calls him lord and it's the lord that makes himself known in genesis chapter 14 and now it's the lord that's making himself known clearly evidently we would believe that genesis chapter 14 is god himself in some form manifest himself to abraham now in genesis 18 it's the lord it says the lord appears to him and he's making this appearance in flesh to abraham and this is why the language is used and and these two uh appearances are kind of combined together to refer to melchizedek because this is a name he's not given a name here in genesis 18 but he was given a name in genesis 14. so we say when we talk about melchizedek he's not called melchizedek in genesis 18 but it's the same god appearing the form of god making himself known to abraham and in this one in genesis 18 he's specifically opening up something to abraham and saying this blessing that i'm going to give you and this blessed be abraham of the most high god this god who possesses heaven and earth he's now saying he's now going to get very detailed and very specific in genesis 18. and so it's unfolded these promises are given promises are given and now it's coming right down to where sarah is going to have a son and i'm going to visit you according to the time of life this specific time it's coming very soon it's very imminent and as you continue to read you'll see that the two other angels that came with this angel go down into sodom but it it's clear in the scripture that the lord stays with abraham why sodom is being dealt with why judgment is coming the lord stays back with abraham and discloses things to him that the other two angels didn't didn't have a message for and discloses things to abraham and it signifies this tremendous type of the bride at the end time who's gathered under a message and things are being disclosed to her and revelations are being made known to her at a time of soon coming judgment and so melchizedek makes himself known to abraham in genesis 14 it's the same god in flesh making himself known in genesis 18. and when brother brown is preaching who is this melchizedek he says praise god for these opening seals is my prayer and i will say these are my words praise god for the opening of the seals he's not saying praise god for something future for the seals being open and he said for all seven seals are open and all things are ready for those who can receive it and we receive it he said for these opening seals is my prayer to know these things praise god for the seals being opened to know these things he's talking about melchizedek he says now the true revelation of melchizedek comes into view so now at the opening of the word there is a true revelation of melchizedek that comes into view remember how paul when he's teaching on melchizedek says hey there's a lot of things i want to say about melchizedek he says but i can't say them now seems you become dull of hearing and have need to be taught again what be the the foundational truths again and so paul wanted to bring out more melchizedek but it's withheld at that time but now in the end time the gentile bride the christians in this last day have the privilege of once again the true revelation of melchizedek coming into view he's made flesh before abraham in the book of genesis he's made flesh before the children of israel in the days of jesus christ and then in the end time there's another manifestation of god in flesh in the stream of human beings in the lives of his people with by revelation which is bringing forth another manifestation of god if god he says the true revelation of melchizedek is coming into view once again at the open of the word and so god making himself known to the royal seed of abraham what is he doing in this time he's confirming a promise that he had made to the elect a covenant think of a covenant he's going to recognize the covenant recognize the promise he made this promise to abraham he makes this vision to abraham to confirm it and say i'm with you and i'm staying with you until this is fulfilled it's going to happen i'm going to bring it to pass because this is a covenant and a promise i made to you at the beginning when i called you and here i am at the end i'm gonna i'm gonna see this promise through i'm gonna make this promise firm i will perform what i promised to you and brother branham is making this this statement and i'm not uh finding a feather and building a chicken but the statement he makes here may seem so slight and so small but this is what's happened at the open of the seals this is what the revelation of jesus christ is all about is god making himself known to his people to confirm his promise and to fulfill it and so it's to bring to bring forth the supreme faith in the bride that's what these things are for the open of the word they open the seals and i uh maybe in my mind i'm thinking i would save this for later but again i just need to inject this don't get weird right oh the opening of the word the seven seals the seven thunders it it is really awesome right i mean this mount zion showdown is amazing seven thunder seven seals and third pull and all these things but it's very very practical right when you start to catch the revelation of it and so these manifestations of god the openly seals the revelation of jesus christ the reveal of the son of man the coming lord how whatever language you need to use whatever scriptures you identify as being fulfilled they have a practical outworking in your life just like it did in abraham's just like we read about abraham and it's not abraham musing over and over again sharing with you these deep things in genesis 12 to genesis 25 is abraham just telling you all these wild types he came up with right tell him oh did you know that noah had this and this happened and he's just rearranging the events of the first 11 books of the bible and wow in your minds with the knowledge he has about all the numerology in the garden of eden it had a practical outworking in abraham's life it's going to do the same for us so just as these manifestations brought forth supreme faith and abraham it's to do it for us now to the point on the open of the seven seals notice what brother brahm says in the first seal it says at the end of the pentecostal age what is the pentecostal age micah can you play the jeopardy theme in g for me the pentecostal age is the laodicean age but the man made him one in the same it's important to recognize that the pentecostal age at the end of the pentecostal age we're supposed to receive according to the word as god help me tonight to show you through here that we're to receive a messenger that'll take all those loose ends out there and reveal the whole secret of god for the rapturing of the church so there's a there's a revelation that comes forth and it's for the specific purpose of rapture in the church and there's coming forth seven mysterious thunders that's not even written at all that's right and i believe that through those seven thunders will be revealed in the last days in order to get the bride together for rapturing faith i'm reading this not so much to identify when this came at the end of the layout of the scene age or what messenger this was which we know who it was and and and what the whole secret was the seven mysterious thunders i'm wanting just to identify the purpose is the rapture he says because what we got right now we wouldn't be able to do it the faith we have right now is saying where the church is at it's going to need something else something else is going to have to happen and if we can think about abraham god gave him the promise he's obeying god he's obeying god but whenever whenever abraham had a need to go a step further in the promises of god god was there to speak to him and give him an experience and give him an encouragement and take him a step further your abram your abram your abram then he changes his name he's like no you are going to be a father of many nations i'm going to change your name he said i'm going to give you i'm going to give you a son i'm going to give you a sentence then he comes around he says no i'm not going to give you any sense it's going to be through sarah his name's going to be isaac things got more precise and he's visiting he's given him in the time when something had to happen something had to happen he's there for him so he says we don't have what we need right now because there's something we've got to take a step further remember the foundational quote we're using in balm and gilead we need to step into the supreme faith he says to do that we have to perfectly know what we're doing he says we got to move up to supreme faith and it's the same language here we've got to have a it says we can't there's something we've got to step farther we can't have enough faith for divine healing hardly what i'm kind of sewing some see breadcrumbs out there some seeds out there so you know what my mind where my heart has been what is divine healing the type of the resurrection says we got to have enough faith to be changed in a moment and be swept up out of this earth we have to have that we'll have to have power to change our bodies listen we are not waiting i don't think this is controversial and trust that it's not we are not holding on hoping that kova doesn't get us until the time that brother branham can come back and speak to us new bodies brother braham didn't teach it it's not what we're waiting for i believe that you as individual members of this bride through your relationship with jesus christ are going to receive the faith that you need not only to change your bodies but to make it day by day because you as the bride of jesus christ not me as the pastor you as the british christ have been given power to bind the greatest to the least you really just need to have your faith loose to exercise it got to have enough faith to be changed in a moment he says well fine after a while lord willing where it is written then all the judgments of these evildoers says now see down to the ages these seals have been breaking until now the last seal is broken the events hid under these seals unfolded through all these ages now in the end he says the last seal is broken and as things are being made known and i and i i recognize immediately uh where there are certain things that people might find difficult to accept but brother ma'am is identifying things that are related to the seven seals being opened and he's saying these things are very relevant to the time we're living in for the purpose of a rapture again he says in the first seal he's referring to revelations chapter 10 the mystery of the seven thunders this uh angel coming down covenant angel coming down with the book open and he's talking about these mysterious thunders he says we don't know what they are yet but my opinion they'll be revealed right away and when it does it'll give faith for that rapturing grace for that church to move out again i'm reading these statements to identify how that brother branham is pointing out a revealing a manifesting a fulfillment of god's promise that's written in his word and the the direct result of this manifestation this revealing the scriptural promise being fulfilled is it produces rapturing faith in you and he's identified coming back to it over and over again rapturing grace to move out we just moved through everything that we know of through all the dispensations we've watched everything we've seen the mysteries of god we've seen the great gathering together the bride in the last days but yet there's something in there that we just can't lighten ourselves with there's something another there's got to be something a step further as he says earlier but imagine when the mysterious when the mysteries begin to come forth god said hold it back now wait a minute revelations chapter 10 it'll reveal in that day don't write it at all john because they'll stagger over it just let it go but i'll reveal it in that day when it has need to be done when they need it he said well why did they make these things no men they didn't need it why didn't they make it known then they didn't need it why does he make it known now we need it that's why it's made known now and this happened in abraham's life as we mentioned a moment ago whenever he needed an extra uh shot of faith whenever he needed another unction a reminder another encouragement something to hold on to and he's staggering not through unbelief but as he makes it through his daily life and things happen and things transpire and he needs something from god god gives him a revelation god revealed himself to abraham when he needed it we find the king of salem the priest of the most high god coming to abraham after the slaughter of the kings in a moment to commune with him and to encourage him and it's because of that visitation and the other visitations that intervene that abraham we find abraham in genesis 18 readily identifying the lord and welcoming him to commune with him in his tent there outside his tent with sarah on the inside these are visitations of god growing abraham's faith in the time that he needs it and abraham's life and his faith testify of the bride's supreme faith for a rapture and how they when abraham needed it god made himself known and maybe when i when i'm when i'm putting these statements together it makes perfect sense then i say it i'm like well there might be a huge hole missing for them i don't know but i'm reading these things from the first seal to identify and there's many many more statements we can read how that those events transpired ultimately for rapturing faith that's the ultimate it's ultimately what it's for so we're not feeding on these things to become more churchy become more religious uh to be more organized to be more succinct in our doctrine to be more doctrinally uh um precise and uh there's just there's a lot of things that we could do that that more promote organization and cohesiveness of beliefs when what these things were for is that if there's just one person just one that's going to go in a body going a rapture that's what it was for and i believe that our churches exist for the purpose of facilitating rapture and faith in individual members that's what we exist for we exist to facilitate rapturing faith in your heart and in your lives so that you can you can be at that meeting in the air and abraham's life is such a beautiful story of how he comes to this expression of faith in genesis 22 which is a type of the bride's supreme faith for rapture this rapturing grace to move out the power to change our bodies it's represented in abraham and he got to genesis 22 through a process abraham's faith began in an election god chose them i think we said it sunday god chose them out of multitudes of people i don't know how many millions would have been on the face of you but god in the sea of everyone just said abram and that's where it began and that's where ours begins there's a grace on a lot of us that we were actually born into what we call the message we're born into it that's a that's an extreme grace that's wonderful it's a tremendous opportunity i'm grateful that my children have that opportunity to be born in a home uh that honors the word of god and has a desire to serve god in the in the light of the truth in this hour and i was privileged to be born in a home with first generation message parents and raised in that truth and and to have the the truth expressed to us from from the word of god in this hour that's a tremendous grace but it still all begins with god calling your name by election some of us didn't have that privilege to be raised in church let alone in a message church or in a family that believes the word of the end time but still it's god's grace god called your name god called you out god identified himself and called you and it began the same way out of tunes here you are there's a lot of other people around you but somehow someway god calls your name and that's where his faith began and then it grew as god revealed himself to abraham it begins an election then it grows through revelation and the revelations were manifesting the character of god to abraham and he was learning to trust this one more and more and more he was learning something about his promises to him he was learning something about the impact and the and the implications of those promises and it was a it was something beautiful that unfolds in the life of abraham we should not make it so sterile towards his god called abraham told him to do this abraham just obeyed and this is what it resulted in but it was a life lived with god a walking with god it was something that unfolded with him and his faith increased and he gets to a mount moriah experience over decades of walking with god and brother branham involvement gail he had when he's talking about coming to the supreme faith i'm using this to kind of sum up our foundation in this after you've trusted in him and watched him do so many things until it becomes just like a regular routine remember the acts of faith you tell me tonight you're going to go home that's an act of faith you tell me you're going to meet somebody tomorrow for lunch that's an act of faith these little repetitive everyday acts of faith brought abraham to supreme faith he says that's the condition i think the church will be in just before the coming of the lord after you've trusted him watch him do so many things you're now in the routine of trusting him you're in the routine of following him not on the routine of once a year or during special meetings trying to get your life right with god but in the routine of trusting him in the routine of follow him and he says so the rapture will just go right on that way i mean he has placed the rapture in the language of regular routine and think about that the rapture is going to be a regular routine the rapture's a revelation so if you're in the regular routine of receiving revelation it's pretty good iller iteration that's coming on here if you're in the regular routine of receiving revelation one day in the regular routine of receiving revelation you're going to receive the rapture of the revelation right that that's that's the order and he says the rapture is going to be the same way so there is a i wanted to do two things number one keep us from being stagnant right he's kind of waiting around you know hoping for some climactic event to take place we realize okay we've been given enough that god's done something in my life and this is real and i want to sir i want to enrich my experience with christ i want to be more real and more living and more abundant i want to be thriving in my relationship with the lord and i want the scriptures to be alive to me and i want the message to be unfolding to me on a daily basis and i want to believe god in small things and i want to look at these acts of faith in my family life in my work life and my professional life in school and all these different touch points where god can be a part be a part of your life and doing things in your life and then it becomes this regular routine of god making himself known to you and in fulfilling his word and so many things happen so one day the regular routine results in a rapture and that's what happens when you you get out of this we're just going to have church until the rapture comes no we're going to have church uh because we're in a rapture and it's going to be moments like this that's reminding you keep doing what you're doing and keep striving and keep pressing and go out there and find the lost sheep here in maricopa somewhere because we want to get out of here finding myself more and more responding to things that my wife mentions just saying even so come lord jesus come like let's just meet the lord let's get out of here well i don't want to wait to see how these things are going to fall out i want to get out of here so this is the urgency he says so the rapture will go on that way it'll just be a regular routine of following the scriptures and the plans of god that's what the rapture is going to be a regular routine of following the scriptures in the plans of god let's get into the regular routine of god revealing himself to us because our rapturing faith will arise it'll raise up within us by simply believing and obeying it's in the simplicity of god hiding himself in simplicity we're gonna have to hear the word believe the word and obey the word you have to act on it and it's in that that in hearing the word of god and and i'm i mean this when i'm talking about the revelation of the seven thunders i mean this is talking about the revealing of the son of man i mean this is not the lord himself shall descend from heaven with with the shout i this those are the things i'm thinking about when i say this that we hear the word we believe it and we obey the word and these things are transpiring to have a practical outwork in our lives so as i mentioned before don't try to be weird with this don't try to make yourself out to be some kind of mysterious uh character or something to be uh ultra uh ultra religious and mysterious and and fanatical deep things when they don't have any practical outworking in your life two statements i want to read very quickly and how that uh and i'd love to expand upon this in greater detail in the future brother branham says in the seventh seal he's talking how the seventh seal is revealed in these different parts and there's one part that's kind of being withheld he says it will be revealed in that day in the hour that it's supposed to be revealed in so he said it's going to be revealed it says so the thing for us to do is to be reverent before god and serve him and do all that we know how to do and live good christian lives now there's some who take this this very statement to say oh then forget about what's going to be revealed i just want to be a simple christian that's not what he's saying it's going to be revealed when it needs to be revealed and the thing what we need to do in light of the revelation that's coming or has come we should do all that we know to do to serve him and live good christian lives the revelation of the seven seals did not exempt us from living good christian lives as a matter of fact it's the one thing that allow us to truly live good christian lives not just be a mimic not just be an impersonator not just kind of put on the front of the pretense of a message believer but actually live a good christian life visit it that morning on question and answers on the seals now take my advice as your brother don't put your interpretation to anything your own interpretation anything you just go on and live a good christian life because you'll only wind yourself away from the real thing when you do it when you try to be odd you try to be different and you try to do this and you try to do that try to be mysterious he says you wind yourself away from the real thing when you do it why because the real revelation of this will actually make you a good christian it actually has this outworking in your life where it moderates your behavior as a man it moderates your behavior as a woman it puts you in your place as a husband to put you in a place as a father put you in your place as a wife and as a mother these are the things that actually come to bear upon your character because you're learning the character and nature of god more and more and more for these things being revealed or not to make us top heavy where we know so much more about the word than all these little pentecostal pennies running around everywhere but we have something that enlarges our hearts and gives us a great wisdom and a connection to the nature and spirit of christ and we tap into an overcoming power who we can conduct ourselves above strife and jealousy and difficulties and hurts and heartaches and estrangements why by the power that's been unloosed just by the true revelation of melchizedek here he is el shaddai in our hour what ministering to us in our journey from election to the body change in however it's working out for you right now very literally he says you'll just wind yourself away from the real thing when we try to be odd and separate ourselves and and do things different i want to close on this thought i think it's just uh it's a very large a thought but i just want to hit on it very very quickly as i close and the supreme faith of abraham our supreme faith revealed in abraham even in death he was testifying of the resurrection as he went to offer up isaac we've looked in the scripture how he had experienced the resurrection his own body he see the resurrection of the womb of sarah and there's other things that we know in the message that show these changes happening in them to be able to bring forth a child but then when he is offering up isaac it's a direct that obedience is directly connected to a revelation that he had of the power of god to raise the dead and the promise that he would and he knew that god would have to raise up isaac and so he actually gave isaac in symbol a foreshadowing in a type a resurrection and he was expressing this on mount moriah but when ev when abraham faces death in his family he faces it with the resurrection and view and i don't have these scriptures on here but i want to just read through them very quickly to close this but in genesis chapter 23 reverses one and items skip to four and then skip to verse 19. so sarah was 107 and 20 years old 127 years old these were the years of the life of sarah and sarah died in kerjafarba the name the same is hebron in the land of canaan they say it was the the valley of four the city of the four and there's um kind of a etymology of that or a legend or a story as to why it had received that name but it's it's identified with hebron in the land of canaan this is part of the promise given to abraham and abraham came to mourn for sarah and to weep for her abraham stood up from before his dead and spake unto the sons of heft saying i am a stranger and a soldier and are with you give me a possession of a burying place with you then i may bury my dead out of my sight and he transacts with them to buy a piece of land here in in hebron near hebron there he says in verse 19 and after this abraham buried sarah his wife and the cave of the field of macpilla before mamrie remember it was in the plains of memory that god visited him in genesis 18. and now he buys a cave of the field of macpela before mamrie in the same as hebron in the land of canaan it mentions it again and this is the place where abraham we realize now abraham by this point has walked with god knew the promises were eternal abraham's very mature in his faith he's seen certain things still yet unfold before him in his advanced age here and his wife dies before he does and now he's going to bury his wife and when he does he buys a piece of land in the cave of the field of machpelah before mamrie and he buries his wife there then in the next two chapters later it says in genesis chapter 25 verses 8 9 then abraham gave up the ghost and died in a good old age an old man and full of years and was gathered to his people and his sons isaac and ishmael buried him in the cave of machpelah in the field of ephraim the son of zohar the hittite which is before mammary and so you find that not only is sarah buried there but abraham is buried there and then when they come into the land of egypt and israel goes into egypt he makes one he makes one request he says don't bury me in egypt and he and he speaks to me in genesis 49 he's speaking to them my father was buried there and he said am i uh or not my father abraham was buried there sarah was buried there and he starts to go through the list of all that was buried there and she says you swear to me that you won't bury me here in egypt but take me and bury me there in the same place and he makes this statement in genesis 49 31 they were buried there they buried abraham and sarah his wife there they buried isaac and rebecca his wife and there i buried leah notice how he's going through jacob now he's going through each one of these steps to say this is where abraham and sarah barrett isaac and rebecca there israel speaking i buried leah now so you take my body put me in the same place it's important to realize now to a jew where everything is natural and it relates to a geographical promise something very important about being buried in that place it says in genesis chapter 50 verse 13 for his sons carried him now he is being carried israel's being carried into the land of canaan and buried him in the cave of the field of machpelah which abraham bought with the field for possession of a burying place of ephraim the hittite before memory they're all going to be buried in the same place when it says that it was the king of the city of the four one of the legends is that it was this it's the place where adam abraham isaac and jacob are all buried and those are the four that they referred to and that's why they said this is the why this land or this region is called the city of the four and then even you find that joseph gives a commandment to his people he says one day god's gonna visit you and when he does you carry my bones out of egypt and you bury me in the same place of my fathers now what why would it matter why would it matter to them to have their bones buried in a particular place these days we cremate bodies and we scat them over baseball fields or in the ocean or favorite fishing pond or you know or we just keep them on the altar and we don't really maybe think much about the exact location where we bury them why because we believe one day things are going to change or we're going to have changed by they're going to resurrect but today to abraham and i want to start with abraham he is so intent on being burying sarah in the right place and then he also is buried there and each one who's in this line of the promise because who is the god of god of abraham isaac and jacob they're all buried in the same place with their wives this is an important thing and brother adam says they knew the first fruits of the resurrection were coming up from that land so abraham is even when he goes to bury his wife it's not indiscriminately it's not just ho-hum it's well i've got to find a place to bury her but he's doing it with the revelation and his revelation is not testifying of well i just want some place close to me where i can mourn at her grave his revelation is one day there's going to be a resurrection and it's going to be in this land and i want to be in that place where the resurrection is brother said look at those prophets back there even says job is buried in that place says they know knew in a literal sense that the first resurrection the first fruits would be in palestine abraham bought a place and he buried sarah how did he do it by revelation knowing that there was going to be a resurrection so that even listen to this even in death abraham is acting according to a revelation of the resurrection and we too can have the same kind of disposition in the face of troublesome times and even in the face of death listen there is no shame if a loved one goes by way of the grave there is no shame if a believer goes by way of the grave because we can die in the faith with the face knowing that one day there will be a resurrection because i've been buried in jesus christ and that's where the resurrection is he says and they did buried there in this one place they did because being prophets they understood that the first fruits of the resurrection would be in palestine that amazing that even when it came to burying the dead there's something about his actions that testifies and speaks of believing in a resurrection believing in the power over death that was the supreme faith revealed in abraham abraham held the revelation and then his life laid the pattern and i believe you can look at his life and see that his example holds a type let's stand to our feet tonight a type of rapturing faith in this end time we've looked at the end and we've looked at the type of the change of our body a type of the climactic moment when death is swallowed up in victory that that spot where it's swallowed up mortality is swelled up by immortality as i even as i minister right now the thought strikes my heart that when we go to the meeting in the air anytime i've ever heard it preached or even when you have it dramatized in the message the questions we're going to be asked and the the thing that stands out the most about the people who are alive and remain is it's not like so what was it like to have your body changed right has anyone ever dramatized that like we're going to be in the meeting there and peter's going to hunt us outside so tell me what was it like to have your body changed he's going to have a body just like ours you have a body just like his you know he you there those in their theophy is going to pick up a glorified body we who are in this body going to be changed and meet our theophanies and we're all going to be in the same makeup in the same body liking of the glorious body that christ has and we're all going to have that experience but you know what they're going to want to know about how did you overcome laodicea isn't that how it's always dramatized and the kind of the the way that it's expressed to us is it's not so much man man how did you do it how did you how did you change your bodies and how did you they're gonna look at a life and maybe they don't ask how did you change their body because they realized the mystery isn't how you overcame laodicea it's not so what what were you doing when your body changed i mean i was just i've been waiting for you for this to happen for so long and what happened in that moment so how did you overcome laodicea how did you overcome the evil day by day by day because we were all cheering you on knowing that it was going to be you in the regular routine of the scriptures and god revealing himself that was going to bring to you the rapturing revelation and and it unfolds day by day by day i think i trust i desire especially brother wes before service at a minimum my desire when i minister is that we create into you a greater appetite to get into the message and find out what your what's been taught at a minimum if i could accomplish one thing it'd give you a greater appetite to dig into the word of god and find out more and uh and some may critically say every time i hear you preach i just want to go and find out really what was said you know what at a minimum i hope that's what's happening because there's there's there's critics there's critics that stream the services because they want to find something to criticize and uh and guess what no offense i'm not preaching to you but at a minimum i'd hope that you get a hunger in your hearts uh for more of the word and to find out what brother bannon really taught and what what what does the bible say about this what does the word say and then i would say that my burden for you is to just feel a lightening of your spirits and a losing to realize you're in the right you're in the pattern you're in the cadence you're in the rhythm things are marching on nothing's out of control the stablers have been put on the ship god knows exactly what he's doing we just need to completely yield to his presence completely yield to his desire for our lives and begin to live out whatever whatever agenda he has for us whatever challenge he has before us realize that it's in these small things and in these uh uh in these little individual challenges we have that don't seem to be so great that christ can make himself known to us in the regular routine of everyday life that maybe it could give the regular routine just a little bit more uh excitement much more important stories these small things that i'm being asked to do are really really important god bless you tonight we love you very much we appreciate your attentiveness and your patience and allowing us the opportunity to wrap up this foundation do you have a need tonight is there any need you might have does anybody have a need in their body need a touch of healing right now he's here [Music] the angel of the covenant is here and there's divine healing in that covenant the the angel the top the one the the atonement all that's in the atonement it's for you right now do you have anybody that's been experiencing a kind of like a melancholy just kind of a a little grayness in their lives and just kind of a malaise and can't seem to quite get out of a fog if you've been experiencing that i believe he can deliver you right now if you want to take him at his word and believe it if you have an emotional need in your hearts where you've been anxious you've been bound you don't know why he's here right now to release your cares if you have a relationship that's a little bit out of cater and you can't seem to find a way to get it back on track he's here right now to give you the wisdom to humble your heart you guys sometimes in our lives we come up against a problem and we know there's a huge issue but and it's very very important to us and god can come on the scene and effect change but he won't do it until you humble yourself to be changed yourself and a lot of times just what it is is for us just to really get that and resistance and that pride you know exactly what i'm talking about it's just something some ugliness right there that hinders you and stops you and what you need is god just to break that down let me just explain it this way so you it can be identified what you're wrestling with you know when you you know you ought to compliment somebody but you don't want to do it because there's something in there that just won't let you say that's a really beautiful engagement ring but you don't want to say it because you're jealous or it's bigger than yours you don't like them or something happen and there's just something in there that's keeping you from being honest being real and saying the right thing that's what i'm talking about you need god to take that away he's here to do it i believe we can just open our hearts to him could we all do that together as family tonight say here i am lord deal with my heart you know what i have need of tonight [Music] do it personally now as we are all together you can even begin to pray yourselves as i just encourage you and exhort you to pray and to believe all things are possible do you realize abraham would have had prayers just like this where he struggles and he wrestles with certain things even condemned by his decisions haunted by the pastor strife whatever it might be [Music] abraham had conversations with god a lot like what you're having right now and supreme faith is not a faith that has never been hindered and that has never been weakened or never been up and down supreme faith is a faith that has [Music] identified weaknesses and challenges and been raw and been honest and accepted god's help notice how he said we read it it'll be revealed when it has need to be done if you have a need tonight i believe he wants to reveal himself to you a gracious heavenly father [Music] come by the hearts of your people tonight and touch the needs of the people what may be in their hearts lord it could be varied and even in individual hearts there could be many different things that someone is wrestling with but i pray lord that you could come and reveal yourself as healer as deliverer savior as encourager [Music] as humbler whatever would need tonight lord i pray that you would meet the people in their need lord as i pray i'm just struck with the image of how that sometimes we enter into role-playing as christians and we play certain roles within families and within churches we're always trying to fit a particular narrative or play a particular part and somehow that informs us and we operate within this construct of what other people see about us and think about us and what our parents said about us and kind of who i am as a person it has kind of been shaped over many many different years and we just kind of take on this persona [Music] maybe it enters into a realm of one who's always going through difficulty and one who's always troubled or maybe it's kind of the person of one who's always sick or maybe it's someone who's just always strong and never going through troubles but lord the problem with all those personas is it becomes a very thick layer that we live behind that keeps you from dealing honestly with our hearts and lord tonight we lay it all aside and we say as abraham did over and over again here i am lord [Music] here i am here stands tonight aaron not the image of what i think others think about me not the image that i think of myself not what i want to be not what i used to be but just who i am here i am lord and in our honesty father we're asking for help lord we pray for those that are sick [Music] families in our church that are traveling some while traveling are sick and i believe that all fear should be crossed out we see you working in a very mighty way very powerful way [Music] and in doing so father it has increased our faith and given us courage that no matter how dark it gets and how tough things are getting we can believe that you're you're doing something so miraculous and so profound and so powerful that we believe that we are living through every challenge and every difficulty even sickness in our body the pandemic that's wagging its tongue in our face and trying to tempt us to doubt lord we believe you're doing great things and we're going to rise above these challenges and live through it it may give faith to the believers who are present tonight to believe for the salvation of family to believe for the change of their hearts to believe for the change of circumstances i believe that you can do it lord we're claiming this these promises committing the people to you now in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen
