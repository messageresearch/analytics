[0:00] And Revelations 22 17 to 21. And the
[0:04] spirit and the bride say come. Let him
[0:07] that heareth say come. Let him that is a
[0:10] thirst come. Whosoever will let him take
[0:13] the water of life freely. Take it
[0:16] freely. For I testify unto every man
[0:18] that heareth the words of the prophecy
[0:20] of this book. If any man shall add unto
[0:22] these things, God shall add unto him the
[0:24] plagues that are written in this book.
[0:27] And if any man shall take away from the
[0:29] words of the book of this prophecy, God
[0:31] shall take away his part out of the book
[0:33] of life. And out of the holy city, and
[0:35] from the things which are written in
[0:37] this book, he which testifith these
[0:40] things saith, surely I come quickly.
[0:43] Amen. Even so come, Lord Jesus. The
[0:46] grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with
[0:48] you all.
[0:50] Amen. God bless you. You can be
[0:53] seated. If you could uh just focus with
[0:56] me a little bit at the beginning here, I
[0:58] wanted to share uh two things. Number
[1:00] one, my title, the complete
[1:03] works. And in this uh using that phrase,
[1:07] the complete works, I could have titled
[1:09] it the complete works of God or uh the
[1:12] complete works of Christ, referring to
[1:15] what might be used in in art of an
[1:18] entire collection or as one that would
[1:21] be the collection of all the artists
[1:22] work. Uh, and the the body of work might
[1:25] be a phrase that's used actually in art.
[1:27] It's catalog
[1:29] reson. That's my French for the day.
[1:31] Huh? But catalog reson. And it would be
[1:34] the uh the it's a catalog of everything
[1:36] that was done. And I'm looking at this
[1:39] idea of something being complete and
[1:41] rendered whole. So the complete works. I
[1:44] want us to really think about something
[1:46] being finished. Now on Wednesday, we
[1:49] ministered on the subject of framed. And
[1:51] some people begin to think maybe with
[1:53] all the uh uh podcast on true crime that
[1:56] they binge, they thought maybe it was
[1:58] about being framed for something they
[1:59] didn't do. But it was how God was
[2:01] intentionally using the Jordan River as
[2:04] an entry point into the promised land
[2:06] but also a border. So that framing was
[2:09] very very important. And in Hebrewsap
[2:13] 11:3 he says through faith we understand
[2:16] that the worlds were framed by the word
[2:19] of God so that things which are seen
[2:21] were not made of things which do appear.
[2:23] Remember how in the beginning that God
[2:25] framed creation even with a commandment,
[2:28] a positive commandment and a negative
[2:29] commandment and he put them up behind
[2:32] the wall, an invisible wall, but a frame
[2:34] and a wall of the word of God and even
[2:37] planted a garden eastward in Eden where
[2:39] it's a very specific local with a
[2:41] condition. And so it's those walls that
[2:43] were compromised that caused mankind to
[2:46] sin. And here he says the worlds were
[2:48] framed by the word of God, made perfect.
[2:51] They were perfectly joined together. So
[2:54] when he framed the world by the word of
[2:56] God, it was to put it in order to fit or
[2:59] to frame for oneself. So there's a
[3:01] completion that's taken place. And I
[3:04] know that this wouldn't necessarily
[3:06] apply in a lot of different situations.
[3:08] And even they find that with modern art
[3:10] and a modern movement in art, the frame
[3:12] was kind of disregarded and it was
[3:14] considered to be uh inhibiting. But the
[3:17] act of framing is something that would
[3:18] typically or in many cases completes or
[3:21] finishes a work of art for display and
[3:25] me having kind of a uh a love for art or
[3:29] at least an interest in it and certainly
[3:30] don't claim to be an artist. I am not
[3:32] one but we have one in our midst. Uh and
[3:35] I may not be able to view it or
[3:36] appreciate it myself but I at least
[3:38] pretend to. And uh I have fallen down
[3:42] the rabbit hole of frames and uh and
[3:44] reading you're thinking what is a rabbit
[3:46] hole of frames but just the reading and
[3:49] studying and finding so many beautiful
[3:51] things about the act of framing and it
[3:54] is something that is
[3:57] uh an integral part of the piece of work
[4:00] and I believe that God has done the same
[4:01] thing that the whole work of art the
[4:04] phrase is the whole work of art the
[4:06] painting and the frame and we can't lose
[4:08] sight of God when he gives us something.
[4:10] He creates something. He does something.
[4:11] What is his framing? What is the
[4:13] context? God has a purpose when he does
[4:15] something. With everything that God is,
[4:17] every design, everything he says,
[4:19] everything he does, we have to try to
[4:21] take a step back and realize what is it
[4:22] that God's wanting me to focus on? What
[4:24] is it that God actually portraying in
[4:26] this? And as God wants to put Christ on
[4:30] display and even ourselves, the token is
[4:32] putting Christ on display, there needs
[4:35] to be a a framing of that. What does it
[4:37] mean in the time and age that we're
[4:39] living in? When I ministered on 21st
[4:41] century Christ, uh it was what how is
[4:44] God going to express his attributes in
[4:46] this hour? So there's context to that.
[4:49] Even when we were looking at the thought
[4:50] myself on uh the concept of photography,
[4:53] a closed composition is when
[4:55] something comfortably fits within that
[4:57] the borders of an image. And this is
[5:00] what God has done with the description
[5:02] of Palestine, Israel, Canaan, the
[5:04] promised land. the borders where God's
[5:06] framing say zeroing in on this. This is
[5:09] this is part of him finishing even the
[5:11] Exodus. It's part of him pointing to the
[5:13] fullness of redemption that in here is
[5:14] where I'm going to do this
[5:16] work. Now in Revelations 22:e
[5:20] 19 as we understand that God wrote the
[5:23] Bible. Brother Bam even talks about it
[5:25] is God's work of art. He is the artist.
[5:28] The Bible says here that if any man
[5:30] shall take away from the words of the
[5:31] book of this prophecy, God shall take
[5:34] away his part out of the book of life
[5:36] and out of the holy city and from the
[5:37] things which are written in this book.
[5:40] If anyone would take away and we know
[5:42] that it also says if any man would add
[5:45] to. So God's word is set forth. I
[5:48] believe this Bible set forth is a closed
[5:50] composition. It is a a complete work in
[5:53] itself in and of itself and it is not to
[5:56] be added to nor taken away. If you add
[5:58] to it, that's not the picture. If you
[6:00] take away from it, that's not the
[6:01] picture. If you try to adjust the frame
[6:03] to include something else, what's going
[6:05] to happen? That's not the original work.
[6:08] And so, this is something that we do
[6:11] with the word of God, even the
[6:13] prophecies of this book, and we say the
[6:15] complete works. We're looking at the
[6:16] whole picture. The that that whole
[6:18] picture finished, perfect, framed just
[6:21] right, not trying to move uh uh the
[6:23] paradigm, not trying to shift things
[6:24] around to include something else or to
[6:27] take something away. A lot of times, I
[6:29] guess there's a danger on both sides to
[6:31] add to the word of God, but then there's
[6:32] also the danger of uh taking away. Now,
[6:37] Numbers chapter
[6:39] 34:es 12 and
[6:41] 13. I I think this some of this is still
[6:44] review from Wednesday night. And um if
[6:47] you think that I'm actually overlapping
[6:49] so much because I don't have anything
[6:51] anymore anything more to say, that is
[6:53] certainly not the truth. But I could
[6:54] still learn to do better if I'm
[6:56] repeating myself too often. And the
[6:58] border shall go down to Jordan, and the
[7:00] things going out of it shall be at the
[7:02] sea. This shall be your land with the
[7:04] coast thereof roundabout. And Moses
[7:07] commanded the children of Israel,
[7:08] saying, "This is the land which ye shall
[7:10] inherit by lot, which the Lord commanded
[7:12] to give unto the nine tribes and to the
[7:14] halftime." I know that sounds odd
[7:15] because we think 12 tribes, but here
[7:17] it's just nine and a half. And he's
[7:18] saying, "This will be your land from the
[7:22] Jordan River, which we can see outlined
[7:23] here in red under the sea. And and this
[7:26] is going to be the land that God will
[7:28] give you. This is your inheritance." And
[7:30] so this Jordan River, as we've tried to
[7:32] highlight it here, this stretch of
[7:34] river, it is a geographical border, but
[7:37] it's more than just and and it's
[7:39] featured quite a bit in scripture in
[7:40] very literal events, but it's also holds
[7:43] a great symbolic type because the
[7:46] promised land is in this phrase on this
[7:49] side of Jordan. Now, there's a phrase
[7:51] where it says this side Jordan where
[7:52] they're wanting to point to wherever
[7:54] they are, wherever they're oriented. But
[7:56] on this side of Jordan, it's a place of
[7:59] safety. It's a place of rest. It's a
[8:00] place of God's presence that God
[8:04] outlined this this land here to be the
[8:08] Palestine, Canaan, the promised land.
[8:11] But this side is not the land that he's
[8:13] speaking to Israel here in the Exodus
[8:15] that they would inherit. In Numbers
[8:18] chapter 34,
[8:19] 35:34, he said, "Defile not therefore
[8:22] the land which ye shall inhabit wherein
[8:24] I dwell." So God's going to live within
[8:28] these borders. God is going to dwell in
[8:31] this place. For the Lord, for I the Lord
[8:33] dwell among the children of Israel. And
[8:35] he says, so he says, "This land don't
[8:37] defile. Don't make it unclean. Don't
[8:39] make it impure. Do not make the land
[8:42] unfit. Whether it be your attitude
[8:44] towards it or what you do in it, you
[8:46] should uh appreciate this land. You
[8:48] should honor this land. You should
[8:50] hollow this land as something that I've
[8:52] given you as an inheritance and a place
[8:54] of even my rest. For this is the place
[8:56] where I bring you that you would dwell
[8:58] with
[8:59] me. Leviticus chapter 18 24-
[9:03] 29 covers quite a bit of ground here and
[9:06] there's a lot that we could get into.
[9:07] But notice this. It says, "Defile not
[9:10] yourselves in any of these things." And
[9:12] there's a litany of things that he had
[9:14] listed that they were not to to to not
[9:16] do. For in all these nations are
[9:18] defiled. For in all these the nations
[9:21] are defiled, which I cast out before
[9:23] you, and the land is defiled. So what
[9:25] they did in the land defiled the land.
[9:27] Therefore, I do visit the iniquity
[9:29] thereof upon it, and the land itself
[9:32] vomitth out her inhabitants. Strong
[9:34] language. But God is saying, "It's
[9:37] because they're evil and their
[9:38] wickedness that I'm going to punish
[9:39] them." I believe God is a just God and
[9:41] he's not just punishing them
[9:43] willy-nilly, but their wickedness and
[9:44] their evil. God says, "I'm going to
[9:47] visit their sins upon them and they're
[9:49] going to be cast out of this land." It's
[9:53] not out of the earth or out of the world
[9:54] at this point, but out of that land. Ye
[9:56] shall therefore keep my statutes and my
[9:58] judgments, and shall not commit any of
[10:00] these abominations, neither any of your
[10:02] own nation, nor any stranger that soldth
[10:04] among you. So, if you're going to live
[10:06] in this land, got to keep his statutes.
[10:08] You can't live wickedly for all these
[10:10] abominations have the men of the land
[10:13] done which were before you and the land
[10:15] is defiled. So wickedness, sin,
[10:17] disobedience, disregarding of God and
[10:20] the and the perversions amongst
[10:21] humanity. He has said that this is the
[10:23] reason why the land vomitth out her
[10:26] inhabitants. So verse
[10:28] 28 that the land spew not you out also
[10:32] when you defile it as it spewed out the
[10:34] nations that were before you. This land
[10:36] is a holy land. And those that do commit
[10:39] wickedness or disobedience or
[10:40] perversion, they're thrust out of that
[10:42] land. For whatsoever shall commit any of
[10:43] these abominations, even the souls that
[10:45] commit them shall be cut off from among
[10:48] the their people. To be cut off, it
[10:50] means to fail or to be destroyed, to be
[10:52] taken away. So they would no longer be
[10:54] connected with God's covenant of promise
[10:56] to that land. That if you're in this
[10:59] land and you're obedient, I'll send you
[11:00] rain. If you're in this land and
[11:01] obedient, I'll keep your enemies from
[11:03] you. that if you'll stay here and not do
[11:05] wickedness, there's blessing. But if you
[11:06] do wickedness, you're cut off from God's
[11:08] covenant and you are actually destroyed
[11:11] from among the people, you're put out
[11:13] of, he's saying here, even the land.
[11:16] Just as the inhabitants were kicked out
[11:18] of uh Israel or kicked out of Canaan
[11:20] because of their sin that there's this a
[11:23] type of not dwelling in the land as
[11:25] being a result of unbelief.
[11:28] Deuteronomy
[11:30] 11:31. This being so of this land, for
[11:33] ye shall pass over Jordan to go in to
[11:36] possess the land which the Lord your God
[11:38] giveth you, and ye shall possess it and
[11:41] dwell therein. Possess means to seize
[11:43] and to occupy. It's this process of of
[11:46] being placed by God in their full
[11:48] inheritance that this is where I'm
[11:49] leading you. This is where I'm taking
[11:51] you. This is where everything has been
[11:52] moving and building to this point. And
[11:54] so enter thou in to the land, dwell in
[11:57] this land, possess it, dwell therein at
[12:01] the cross Jordan to do this. So if you
[12:04] were on this side of Jordan, you're in
[12:07] this place of rest, this place of
[12:08] safety, this place of where God
[12:12] dwells. But beyond
[12:14] Jordan, on the other side of Jordan, if
[12:17] we could say that, was the wilderness,
[12:18] which is full of sin and wickedness.
[12:20] It's where the casto from the land would
[12:22] go to dwell. If you can't be in here,
[12:24] you need to go on the other side. Now,
[12:26] you couldn't go into the sea, but you
[12:27] could be cast on the other side of
[12:28] Jordan, and that would be that
[12:30] wilderness that would open up that great
[12:32] expanse, which was not that place that
[12:33] God said he would dwell. The other side
[12:36] of Jordan represented for Israel a place
[12:38] of wondering. It even represents death.
[12:40] To be beyond Jordan is to be on the
[12:43] wrong side of life and death. It's what
[12:46] God told him in Deuteronomy. I set
[12:47] before you, life and death. Choose life.
[12:50] Choose the promised land. Choose Canaan.
[12:52] choose to cross that river that you can
[12:54] dwell in life and not death. But verse
[12:58] 14 of Numbers 34 tells us a little bit
[13:00] different story. Says, "For the tribe of
[13:03] the children of Reuben, according to the
[13:04] house of their fathers, and the tribe of
[13:06] the children of Gad according to the
[13:07] house of their fathers have received
[13:09] their inheritance, and the half and half
[13:12] the tribe of Manasseh have received
[13:13] their inheritance."
[13:15] The two tribes and the halftribe have
[13:17] received their inheritance on this side
[13:20] Jordan near Jericho eastward toward the
[13:24] sun rising. This was our thought I
[13:26] believe it was last Sunday on cosmetic
[13:28] Christians. They are the ones who do not
[13:30] enter into God's rest through unbelief.
[13:32] They don't enter into the promised land.
[13:34] They look the part until ultimately
[13:36] where they choose to settle. Even if
[13:38] they are with them in the journey, they
[13:40] cross over. They fight battles.
[13:41] ultimately where they want to be and
[13:42] where their eyes are and where their
[13:43] hearts are is to be what this size here
[13:46] says here on the other side this side of
[13:48] Jordan on the east side of Jordan toward
[13:51] the sun rising as the sun rises in the
[13:53] east that's where they choose to be what
[13:56] we were emphasizing even then is how
[13:58] that the
[14:00] uh the the cosmetic Christian forms a a
[14:04] barrier if you were traveling and all of
[14:06] a sudden you ran into all the you know
[14:08] the half tribe of Manasseh and you were
[14:09] there with Gad and Rome oh Brothers,
[14:11] sisters, this is awesome. This is great.
[14:13] This is where this is the promised land.
[14:14] This is where the word is. This is where
[14:16] God wants us to be. And there would be
[14:18] maybe a rally in there. But God says, I
[14:20] want you to go across the Jordan. They
[14:23] form a false border. It's a distraction
[14:25] or even an actual barrier to those who
[14:28] are wanting to enter as the Bible says
[14:30] cross Jordan and possess it.
[14:34] And these tribes of Reuben, Gad, and a
[14:36] half Manasseh chose to settle or take
[14:38] their inheritance outside the land that
[14:40] the message had been leading them to all
[14:42] along. When God gave the promise to
[14:45] Abraham, as we'll see here in a moment,
[14:46] he said, "For 400 years, they're going
[14:48] to soldier in an estrange land." And the
[14:49] prophecy was that you will go out of uh
[14:52] Canaan and you will be brought back into
[14:54] Canaan and 440 years. You would say
[14:57] roughly if you just added 400 plus the
[14:59] 40 years of wondering, you say this is
[15:02] what it's been all about all along.
[15:05] The Exodus with all its signs and
[15:07] wonders really didn't have any meaning
[15:09] without the entrance.
[15:12] And that's why they kept notice this is
[15:13] where the complaint always, did you
[15:15] bring us out here in the wilderness to
[15:16] die? It would be better if we were in
[15:18] Egypt. And that's exactly the truth.
[15:21] If all God was doing was bring them to
[15:23] the wilderness, then they would have
[15:24] been better off in Egypt. But what are
[15:26] they missing in that? The complete
[15:28] promise. God didn't bring them into the
[15:30] wilderness for them to die. He brought
[15:32] them out of Egypt and they had to go by
[15:34] way of the wilderness to get into the
[15:36] promise. So, they had to endure the
[15:37] wilderness.
[15:40] The wilderness then it kind of forms
[15:42] that area where if you get into the
[15:44] wilderness without the the uh the
[15:46] promise of the destination, then you're
[15:48] either going to try to cabbage down in
[15:50] the wilderness and well, we'll just make
[15:51] this work. Glory to God. or you want to
[15:53] go back to Egypt in Exodus chapter 8
[15:56] verses 27 and
[15:58] 28 it's kind of one thing if you read if
[16:01] you're reading in the Exodus and how
[16:03] that Moses initially asked you know let
[16:05] us go worship a three days journey in
[16:08] the wilderness and that wasn't what they
[16:10] wanted all along God actually told them
[16:12] to do it because he would show the
[16:13] hardness of Pharaoh's heart and how
[16:15] Pharaoh wouldn't even relent on that he
[16:18] says and so we will go three days
[16:20] journey into the wilderness and
[16:21] sacrifice the Lord our God as he shall
[16:22] now command us. So it's kind of this
[16:24] this is what will you let us do it and
[16:26] this shows what's in the heart of
[16:28] Pharaoh and Pharaoh said I will let you
[16:29] go that you may sacrifice to the Lord
[16:31] your God in the wilderness I want you to
[16:32] catch even the heart of Satan only you
[16:36] shall not go very far away entreat for
[16:39] me worship in the wilderness was never
[16:42] God's perfect plan worship in the
[16:44] wilderness was never what God's
[16:46] objective it wasn't what he wanted them
[16:48] to ultimately do that was only a
[16:50] temporary thing even in the It was only
[16:52] to show the hardness of Pharaoh's heart.
[16:55] And this is the attitude that Pharaoh
[16:56] has. I don't mind if you worship God.
[16:59] Just make sure you do it right on the
[17:01] edge.
[17:02] Do it close enough to where there's no
[17:04] distinction. Don't go all the way into
[17:06] the promise. Just remain somewhere
[17:08] between Canaan and Egypt.
[17:11] This is the This is the proposition that
[17:13] Satan's going to give you is I want you
[17:15] to worship. I don't mind if you worship,
[17:17] but don't stay close enough
[17:20] to where I'm
[17:22] at. This is what they chose when they
[17:25] chose
[17:27] to settle on the east side
[17:30] of Jordan as they were outside the
[17:34] promise. We'll read a few places here in
[17:36] Deuteronomy chapter 2 through the
[17:38] remainder of the service and you'll see
[17:39] that this is something God repeats over
[17:40] and over again. and Deuteronomy 2:es 4
[17:44] and 5. And command thou the people,
[17:46] saying, "Ye are to pass through the
[17:49] coast of your brethren, the children of
[17:51] Esau, which dwell in Seir." That's
[17:54] horror and shock. They shall be afraid
[17:56] of you. Take ye good heed unto
[17:58] yourselves, therefore, meddle not with
[18:00] them. What did Paul say? A good soldier
[18:02] doesn't entangle himself with the
[18:04] affairs of this world. For I will not
[18:06] give you of their land. No known, not so
[18:07] much as a foot breath, because I have
[18:09] given Mount Ser unto Esau for a
[18:12] possession. Esau is a type of the
[18:15] makebeliever,
[18:17] that firstborn of that union, though he
[18:20] was a twin. He's the first one. He's
[18:22] that type of our firstborn nature, that
[18:24] worldly nature that we have. And he
[18:27] said, I haven't given Canaan to Esau.
[18:30] I've given him this land that you're
[18:32] going to pass through. So he tells them
[18:34] very specifically, don't meddle with
[18:37] them. Don't try to settle down. Don't
[18:39] dwell here because I haven't given you
[18:41] the land of Esau for your inheritance.
[18:45] This this one, this
[18:47] firstborn, and it's very interesting if
[18:49] you study the histories of Reuben, Gad,
[18:51] and Manasseh, they're all firstborn of
[18:52] their mothers.
[18:54] That
[18:55] firstborn, ye must be born again.
[18:59] And only half the tribe of Manasseh
[19:01] fulfills God's desire that though you be
[19:04] of the firstborn. Though it's firstborn,
[19:07] you are to be born again, enter into
[19:09] that
[19:10] promise. You are to pass
[19:13] through and not settle because I haven't
[19:16] given you even so much as a foot breath.
[19:19] I said, I I don't even want you to get
[19:21] have this margin like an easement, some
[19:25] common ground that you can both share.
[19:27] He says, "No, I've given that to Esau
[19:29] for possession, but for you, I give you
[19:31] the promised
[19:33] land." Now, in Joshua
[19:37] 13:32, these are the countries which
[19:40] Moses did distribute to for inheritance
[19:42] in the plains of Moab on the other side
[19:45] of Jordan by Jericho eastward.
[19:49] This is the
[19:50] land that Reuben, Gad, and a half of
[19:54] Manasseh
[19:55] chose over what God destined for them.
[19:59] Think of this description now as they
[20:01] had received their inheritance on the
[20:03] east side of Jordan toward the
[20:04] sunrising. The Bible is very clear in
[20:07] these distinctions. Moses distributed
[20:09] for an inheritance even though God said,
[20:11] "This is what what I have given you."
[20:13] And in another place, it says the Lord
[20:15] did give them this by Moses, but what is
[20:17] it? It's his permissive will. He's
[20:20] allowing it. He's permitting it to
[20:22] distribute the inheritance. Notice these
[20:24] features in the plains of Moab on the
[20:27] other side of Jordan by Jericho
[20:31] eastward. In Jericho, it brings to us
[20:34] the image of a city that they were to
[20:35] conquer, first city conquered upon
[20:38] crossing Jordan. And what they would
[20:40] have done then to reverse course is to
[20:42] go past a reminder that God would
[20:45] vanquish all of their enemies within
[20:47] this land. Even in Joshua chapter 6 26,
[20:50] and Joshua adjured them at that time,
[20:52] saying, "Cursed be the man before the
[20:54] Lord that ra riseth up and buildeth this
[20:56] city Jericho. He shall lay the
[20:58] foundation thereof in his firstborn, and
[21:00] in his youngest son shall he set up the
[21:02] gates of it." Cursed be the one that
[21:04] builds this city.
[21:07] Jericho even represented that fullness
[21:09] of iniquity that it was God was just in
[21:12] judging it because their sins were so
[21:14] wicked and so
[21:17] great, something cursed. It's something
[21:19] forbidden. Don't build it back
[21:21] up. But notice how they settle like the
[21:25] nearest uh nearest city. The Bible says
[21:27] that they're they they're near Jericho
[21:30] eastward. They're on the other side of
[21:32] Jer Jordan by Jericho. keeps bringing
[21:34] this cursed symbol up before
[21:38] them. Genesis 15
[21:41] 12-6. I want you to catch what this
[21:44] destruction of Jericho would symbolize
[21:47] that God is taking wickedness and
[21:49] ridding the land of wickedness,
[21:51] completely separating out all unbelief,
[21:53] spewing out, vomiting out the
[21:55] inhabitants thereof. So in Genesis 15
[21:59] 12-6 is everybody doing good this
[22:01] morning? You're doing every You answer
[22:03] for everybody. I like that. Everybody's
[22:06] positive confession. You're doing good.
[22:08] You're doing good. You're We're all
[22:10] doing
[22:10] good. Uh oh, I'm starting to sound like
[22:12] one of those Bible
[22:14] churches. Uh those Bible churches. I I
[22:19] believe that God is with us. I'm feeling
[22:21] good today. And I know that you're
[22:23] listening. So, I'm not I'm not too much
[22:25] worried about how much feedback I get
[22:28] and responding. I know you're listening
[22:30] and very intent on this. I must have
[22:32] grabbed your attention um as I was told
[22:35] told that
[22:36] uh listening to me preach is likened to
[22:40] that struggle between the python and the
[22:42] alligator or something who were in these
[22:43] death throws. Anyways, I'll have to have
[22:45] my memory refreshed by brother Barry
[22:47] just exactly whatever kind of compliment
[22:49] that was, but I know it can be intense
[22:52] when you're listening. Now, notice this.
[22:54] This is very important scripture.
[22:55] Genesis 15 12-6. And when the sun was
[22:59] going down, a deep sleep fell upon
[23:01] Abram, and lo, a horror of great
[23:03] darkness fell upon him. This is a very
[23:05] significant moment in Abram's journey.
[23:08] And he said unto Abram, "Know of
[23:09] assurityity that thy seed shall be a
[23:12] stranger in a land that is not theirs,
[23:13] and shall serve them, and they shall
[23:15] afflict them 400 years." This is a
[23:18] prophecy to Abram that his seed would be
[23:22] slaves servants in bondage in Egypt.
[23:25] That's where it's fulfilled. So it's
[23:27] upon this prophecy that they built their
[23:30] uh expectation that God would take them
[23:32] out of this land of bondage. He said
[23:34] also that nation whom they shall serve
[23:36] will I judge and afterward they shall
[23:39] come out with great substance promise of
[23:42] an
[23:43] exodus. And thou shalt go to thy fathers
[23:46] in peace. Thou shalt be buried in a good
[23:47] old age. So now he realizes that it's
[23:50] not going to live this um this full
[23:51] time. But in the fourth generation they
[23:53] shall come hither again where to the
[23:56] land of promise inside these borders
[23:58] inside that promise that even very
[24:01] precisely in that western part of what
[24:03] God had promised Abraham he says when is
[24:06] this going to happen what's the point at
[24:07] which they're going to see this for the
[24:08] iniquity of the Amorites is not yet
[24:11] full in other words at the time when the
[24:14] wickedness is complete it's the fullness
[24:16] of sin unbelief has ripened in that land
[24:21] God is going to bring the children of
[24:23] Israel out of Egypt and they're going to
[24:25] enter into the land and God's going to
[24:27] judge that wickedness. I know there's a
[24:29] lot of types and patterns to even the
[24:31] time that we live in now where in
[24:33] Leodysia when it's as wicked as it's
[24:34] ever been, the darkest days there's ever
[24:36] been. It's a type of what happened in
[24:38] the days when Christ came when the the
[24:39] wickedness and evil in that day and it
[24:41] was a dark and evil day and God rose up
[24:44] light there in Palestine. Now we see it
[24:46] even in the Exodus the iniquity of the
[24:48] Amorites was full and that's the time
[24:51] that they would come to enter to the
[24:53] promised land.
[24:55] So it says they will I will distribute
[24:57] for an inheritance in
[25:00] uh an area that's by
[25:02] Jericho, a cursed city. That's the
[25:04] nearest uh symbol that God has destroyed
[25:07] wickedness in that land. And you want to
[25:09] live in a place that the wickedness
[25:11] still dwells. And it says in the plains
[25:14] of
[25:15] Moab. Moab was a land of idolatry, a
[25:18] land of
[25:20] ungodliness. It was a place that had
[25:22] been cursed by God, placed under a curse
[25:24] prophetically in Exodus. Numbers 24 17
[25:28] and 18. Balam
[25:31] prophesying, I shall see him, but not
[25:33] now. I shall behold him, but not nigh.
[25:35] There shall come a star out of Jacob and
[25:37] a scepter shall rise out of Israel and
[25:39] shall smite the corners of
[25:41] Moab. He wasn't supposed to say this,
[25:44] but here Moab is is judged. He's being
[25:47] placed under curse and destroy all the
[25:49] children of Seth. And Edom shall be a
[25:51] possession. Say also shall be a
[25:53] possession for his enemies. And Israel
[25:55] shall do
[25:57] violently. As I was pondering this
[26:00] scripture last
[26:02] week and I was drawn to it because
[26:04] specifically this is where Moab is
[26:06] cursed.
[26:09] But then Balum even in his language here
[26:11] it says that there's going to be there'd
[26:13] be a time when Israel would possess even
[26:15] these greater borders because even these
[26:17] borders was in the original land that
[26:19] God promised to Abraham which was a much
[26:21] larger expanse but it wasn't the
[26:25] season. We are going to rule and reign
[26:27] the entire world. In the millennium,
[26:30] there's going to be a new heavens and
[26:32] new earth. But even in that new heavens
[26:33] and new earth, there's a b there's a
[26:35] boundary that certain ones can't cross,
[26:38] there's a there's a certain order. And
[26:40] so, even though we could take this as,
[26:42] oh, well, this land ultimately, it's all
[26:43] God's land. It's all God's creation. But
[26:45] no, God God has brought a division for a
[26:47] reason. Amen. And to disregard it, to
[26:50] mis apply the word, to take God's word
[26:52] out of context, out of framing, out of
[26:54] season, to misapply it is to change its
[26:57] meaning.
[26:59] But here, Moab is under a
[27:03] curse. Deuteronomy chapter 2:9, we've
[27:05] already read verses four and 5 where he
[27:07] says, "Don't meddle with the children of
[27:08] Esau, nor settle in their land because I
[27:11] give and say air to them as a
[27:13] possession, but you, I haven't even
[27:14] given you a foot breath in it." Verse 9.
[27:16] And the Lord said unto me, "Distress not
[27:18] the Moabites, neither contend with them
[27:20] in a battle in battle. We should take
[27:23] this to mind. Don't distress them. Don't
[27:24] vex them. Don't fight with them. For I
[27:27] will not give thee of their land for
[27:30] possession. Because I have given unto
[27:33] the children of Lot for a
[27:37] possession. He has given this land of
[27:39] the Moabites to the children of Lot."
[27:42] The children of Esau, the children of
[27:44] Lot. They have been given the land on
[27:47] the other side of Jordan or the wrong
[27:49] side of Jordan for a
[27:51] possession. So for Reuben and Gad and
[27:54] the halftribe of Manasseh to desire to
[27:56] settle in this land of the Moabites, it
[27:58] shows that what they wanted falls fall
[28:01] short of God's promise. They weren't
[28:04] trusting God's promise. They didn't see
[28:06] that God's promise in itself would would
[28:09] uh give them what they desired. Right?
[28:12] So they fell short of fully trusting as
[28:15] the Bible says that Joshua kept they had
[28:17] wholly followed the Lord. They didn't
[28:20] trust God's promise nor fully obey God's
[28:22] command. So they're choosing an
[28:25] inheritance. They're choosing a final
[28:26] resting place that is identified with
[28:30] Esau,
[28:31] with
[28:32] Lot, and most strikingly not Abraham.
[28:36] Right?
[28:39] Notice how he says, "I have given this
[28:40] land of the Moabites to Lot for a
[28:43] possession." All these that could claim
[28:45] this is our land. This is our homeland.
[28:47] Uh uh this my land is my land. This land
[28:49] is your land, you know, east of Jordan,
[28:52] you know, to this to that. And and
[28:54] they're all really really happy. And
[28:56] they all sing God bless Moab, right?
[29:00] Land that I love. This is the land that
[29:02] they have. But the land that God had
[29:04] given specifically to the seed of
[29:05] Abraham is not this
[29:09] land. Genesis chapter
[29:16] 19. I might have written 16 on this and
[29:19] I have 19 in my notes. So somebody fact
[29:22] checked me later
[29:25] uh on whether or not I think it's 19.
[29:27] It's verse 19 actually. But Genesis 19,
[29:30] not 16. And it says in verse 36, "Thus
[29:33] were both the daughters of Lot with
[29:35] child by their father." I want you to
[29:37] just look at Lot for a second. Genesis
[29:39] 19. So we know we're post destruction of
[29:41] Sodom and
[29:43] Gomorrah. This is the history. I'll tell
[29:45] you, this is the history of
[29:47] Moab. These are the countries that Moses
[29:50] distributed to Reuben, Gad, and half
[29:53] Manasseh in the plains of
[29:57] Moab. Who is Moab? What country is this?
[30:01] It's a land that God has given the
[30:03] children of Lot for possession. And the
[30:05] both the daughters of Lot were with
[30:06] child by their father. And the
[30:08] firstborn, there's your firstborn again,
[30:10] bear a son, and called his name Moab,
[30:13] the same as the father of Mo, the
[30:15] Moabites unto this
[30:17] day. So Moab and the land of the
[30:20] Moabites, has its origins in Lot. Moab
[30:23] is a son of Lot, Abraham's nephew.
[30:27] And there's a a meaning there's a
[30:28] certain meaning and symbolism attached
[30:31] to Reuben, Gadam, half Manasseh choosing
[30:34] the land of the
[30:35] Moabites as I show you here that Moab
[30:38] means seed of his father. So choosing
[30:42] Moab signifies something. It exposes
[30:44] this wrong desire.
[30:46] Now, we've taken some time in in series
[30:49] past to go through a number of places,
[30:50] just volumes of statements by brother
[30:52] Brandham where he identifies that Moab
[30:54] is associated with organized religion.
[30:57] Represents a denominational spirit, an
[30:59] organizational condition. Those man-made
[31:02] systems that keep the people back from
[31:04] going completely into God's promises.
[31:07] Those man-made systems that hold the
[31:08] people in bondage with this semblance of
[31:11] truth, but really holds them in bondage.
[31:14] So Moab, this land of Moab, you go
[31:16] studied out of the message, look at it
[31:18] scripturally, even in terms of what God
[31:20] called Ruth out of a a and what Orpa
[31:23] went back into was all that
[31:25] denominational thinking.
[31:28] And so the promised land was a type, a a
[31:31] type of the
[31:33] bride. The bride called into that. So
[31:36] Egypt represents the world, the
[31:37] wilderness, even the church. But the
[31:39] bride's to go all the way into go all
[31:42] the way into
[31:44] the promised land. So in type, Moab
[31:47] represents the natural church, the
[31:48] carnal
[31:50] church, carnal religion, political
[31:53] religion. Lot being the nephew of
[31:55] Abraham shows there's some kinship, some
[31:58] association there. They're not heathens,
[32:00] but they're really close to the truth.
[32:05] And Moab and Israel, as you see, even in
[32:07] the testimonies of Balum and the history
[32:09] of Balum and their worship, they may
[32:12] have understood one another's language,
[32:15] worshiped very similarly, had similar
[32:17] beliefs. Brother Bam said, "Israel and
[32:19] Moab were
[32:21] related. The Moabites knew the truth
[32:23] whether they lived up to it or not."
[32:27] Catch that.
[32:29] Moabites knew the truth whether they
[32:32] lived up to it or not. He says of the
[32:35] Moabites and does God change his mind?
[32:37] He says we find here that this carnal
[32:39] impersonation that Moab had, he saw this
[32:42] prophet among Israel that was able to
[32:43] bless, curse, lead and so forth. So he
[32:45] tries to match it by politics. That's
[32:48] what's taken place in churches today.
[32:50] They have tried to match it with some
[32:52] kind of system.
[32:54] So Moab is this this impersonation, this
[32:57] false
[32:58] twin. And it's the Bible is telling us
[33:01] that Reuben, Gad, and half of Manasseh
[33:04] were given an inheritance in the plains
[33:06] of Moab on the other side of Jordan by
[33:09] Jericho, eastward. They wanted to remain
[33:12] eastward of Jordan. This should tell us
[33:14] this is a falling away from the full
[33:16] word of God. Eastward we've seen in the
[33:19] scriptures type is a rel as a type of
[33:22] religion. It's a fabrication of God
[33:25] planting a garden eastward in Eden. It's
[33:27] an impersonation trying to set up a
[33:29] system that would look like what God set
[33:31] up in heaven. Try to set up a system, a
[33:33] carnal system of what God had ordained
[33:35] in the g in the garden. One of the
[33:38] phrases I was thinking of over and over
[33:40] again that's kind of inspired some of
[33:41] these prior services is it's a fictional
[33:44] faith. True.
[33:47] It's a fictional faith that they're
[33:48] trying to establish in Moab. It's a it's
[33:51] a mirage of belief. And this fictional
[33:54] faith is first seen in the acts of Cain
[33:56] in Genesis 4 where he builds what? An
[33:59] altar of unbelief. Not an altar of
[34:00] revelation, an altar of
[34:02] unbelief. And when Cain's worship is
[34:06] exposed as bloodless, given an
[34:08] opportunity to obey, he can't humble
[34:10] himself to the word of God. What does
[34:12] Cain do? He goes and he tries to build a
[34:15] system. Genesis 4:16. And Cain went out
[34:18] from the presence of the Lord and dwelt
[34:20] in the land of Nod on the east of Eden.
[34:23] Not is this. It's described. That word
[34:25] there means the land of wondering,
[34:27] commotion, exile,
[34:30] unrest, but it's east of
[34:33] Eden. Brother Brandham in the power of
[34:35] transformation says see how religious it
[34:37] was. It went around to the east side. So
[34:40] on the east of Eden shows it's a
[34:42] religious move. It's not a repudiation
[34:44] of God, not a rejection of God, not a
[34:46] rejection of the message, but it is
[34:48] something that's trying to stay very,
[34:49] very close, but it's all man-made,
[34:54] eastward. Notice that it says that the
[34:56] children of Israel, these nations, these
[34:58] two and a half tribes wanted to settle
[35:01] eastward. God was calling as the sun
[35:03] rises from the east to the west. God was
[35:05] wanting to bring it to a place of
[35:07] completion, a place of finality. They
[35:09] wanted to go back to something
[35:12] else because God had given the land of
[35:16] promise on that coast, that eastern
[35:18] border of the sea. They're wanting to
[35:20] move the margins a little bit. God said,
[35:22] "Not even a foot breath." So look at
[35:25] Genesis 13:es 10 to 11.
[35:29] This is where Abraham and Lot. And I
[35:31] know I'm just zeroing and focusing in
[35:33] very quickly on some of these stories
[35:35] because there's strife that had risen up
[35:36] between Abraham and
[35:38] Lot. And there's a hey well we can't we
[35:41] can't continue to be so close together.
[35:43] And so it's that strife that's going to
[35:45] bring that separation. And Lot is given
[35:47] the opportunity to choose. And Lot
[35:49] lifted up his eyes and beheld all the
[35:51] plain of Jordan that it was well watered
[35:53] everywhere before the Lord destroyed
[35:56] Sodom and Gomorrah. even as the garden
[35:58] of the Lord, like the land of Egypt, as
[36:00] thou comest unto
[36:02] Zor. Then Lot chose him all the plain of
[36:06] Jordan, and Lot journeyed
[36:09] east. Notice the separation that takes
[36:11] place, this religious shock, separating
[36:14] from the sea, and they separated
[36:15] themselves, the one from the other.
[36:17] Abram dwelt in the land of Canaan, the
[36:20] land of promise. And Lot dwelt in the
[36:23] cities of the plain and pitched his tent
[36:26] toward Sodom. Notice the nearness to
[36:29] this wickedness. But the men of Sodom
[36:30] were wicked and sinners before the Lord
[36:33] exceedingly. Can you see the image of
[36:36] the two and a half tribes? Now, when
[36:38] they began to look east, they beheld, as
[36:40] we'll see again here in a moment, I know
[36:42] I'm circling back to some of these
[36:43] things over and over again, they beheld
[36:45] the well-watered plains.
[36:47] where before the destruction and maybe
[36:49] the advent of the Dead Sea and the sea
[36:51] of salt that here they look and they see
[36:54] all these well-watered plains and grass
[36:56] and they choose this side east of
[36:59] Jordan. It's the same choice that Lot
[37:01] makes
[37:04] and he pitches his tent towards
[37:06] Sodom shows his inclination
[37:09] eastward shows his inclination towards
[37:12] wickedness. The Bible says the men of
[37:14] Sodom were wicked and sinners before the
[37:16] Lord
[37:17] exceedingly. And
[37:19] Lot by definition, the word lot means
[37:24] covering to envelop
[37:27] envelope. What was Lot doing? He was the
[37:29] wrong
[37:30] frame. He he he's covering something.
[37:34] His journey east is a religious has
[37:36] relig religious motives. It's a
[37:37] religious influence. Brother Brand, I
[37:40] mean, God hiding himself in simplicity.
[37:41] Says, "In the beginning, when man
[37:42] sinned, it showed the nature of man.
[37:44] He's always trying to hide from God and
[37:46] make himself a way that he can feel
[37:47] justified, a religion." That's been a
[37:50] religion. It means a covering. That's
[37:53] what Lot
[37:55] represents. Man-made belief, man-made
[37:58] theology, man-made movements,
[38:00] representing that lukewarm religion. Lot
[38:03] is the epitome of Leodysia.
[38:08] You have the unbelieving
[38:10] sodomites on one end, the elective
[38:12] Abraham on the
[38:14] other, and the makebelieving Lot right
[38:16] in the
[38:17] middle. The lukewrab doesn't mind
[38:20] getting as far away from
[38:22] it. And he's not going to go down and
[38:24] and Lot doesn't at this time doesn't
[38:25] seem like he's going to go into Sodom,
[38:27] but he's right there make
[38:29] believing. It's Le Oysia.
[38:35] This is what those two and a half tribes
[38:37] say in Numbers 32:5. Wherefore said
[38:39] they, if we found grace in thy sight,
[38:41] let this land be given unto thy servants
[38:43] for possession, and bring us not over
[38:47] Jordan. They make the same choice that
[38:50] Lot
[38:51] made. They fall short of the full word
[38:53] of
[38:56] God. And I believe I may uh I changed
[39:00] some things uh yesterday.
[39:03] Just realizing how lengthy this sermon
[39:05] might get and want to want to be sure
[39:07] that we have plenty of time for our
[39:08] fellowship this afternoon. Kind of
[39:10] implies that I'm capable of preaching to
[39:12] three, but that's not what I mean. But I
[39:15] don't want it to get too
[39:16] lengthy. Just maybe point to it. After
[39:20] they choose, these tribes choose to
[39:22] settle on the wrong side of Jordan,
[39:24] they're hardly ever mentioned again.
[39:28] Look them up. Try to find more history.
[39:30] There's a lot of nice uh strings and and
[39:33] different forms of things. People trying
[39:34] to explore the history, figure things
[39:35] out, make connections, figure out
[39:37] whether or not there's a lot of rich
[39:38] theology that argues that they made the
[39:40] right choice and that there was a reason
[39:43] in them doing this. But there's such a
[39:46] small mention of them. And two of the
[39:49] mentions are in one's in
[39:52] Deuteronomy. Actually, let me before I
[39:55] get there, let me just read from
[39:56] Deuteronomy chapter 18 and
[39:58] 19. This will tell us again how that
[40:00] they chose don't bring us over Jordan.
[40:03] The Bible says, "Thou art to pass over
[40:05] through air to the coast of Moab this
[40:07] day. And when thou comest nigh over
[40:09] against the children of Ammon, distress
[40:11] them not, nor meddle with them." I'm not
[40:13] re I'm not reading the same same verse
[40:15] that I read before. This is the third
[40:17] time in this chapter that he's saying,
[40:19] "These lands, these people, don't meddle
[40:21] with them. Don't fight with them. For I
[40:23] will not give thee the land of the
[40:25] children of Ammon for any possession,
[40:28] because I've given it unto the children
[40:29] of Lot for a possession. There's an
[40:31] inheritance for the children of Lot.
[40:33] There's an inheritance for the children
[40:34] of Abraham. There's an inheritance for
[40:36] Israel. There's an inheritance in
[40:38] Canaan. There's an inheritance in the
[40:39] promise, but there's this land. I have
[40:41] not given it to you. So, notice that
[40:43] these two and a half tribes are
[40:44] specifically saying, "We want a portion
[40:47] of Lot's inheritance, a covering." Moab
[40:50] means the seed of his father, the seed
[40:52] of a religious covering, the seed of
[40:54] man-made
[40:57] religion. And by doing this, they're cut
[40:59] out of the picture. Hardly have ever a
[41:01] mention of them again. They become
[41:03] insignificant. They become forgotten.
[41:05] One of the few mentions of them is in 2
[41:07] Kings 10:es 32 and 33. And in those
[41:10] days, the Lord began to cut Israel
[41:12] short, began to cut them off. and has
[41:14] all smoked them in all the coast of
[41:15] Israel. Ahazio, and from Jordan
[41:18] eastward, all the land of Gilead, the
[41:20] Gadites, and the Reubenites, and the
[41:22] Manassites, from Orer, which was by the
[41:25] river Arnon, even Gilead and Bashon. God
[41:28] is specifically saying, I'm cutting them
[41:32] off. Going to cut off the land of Gilead
[41:35] from Jordan
[41:36] eastward. the Gadites, the Reubenites,
[41:39] the Manassites, these are going to be
[41:41] cut
[41:41] off in 1 Chronicles 5:es 25 and 26.
[41:45] These are one of the few mentions.
[41:47] There's some uh uh men of these tribes
[41:50] of Gad that were part of David's mighty
[41:52] warriors, but you'll find if anyone has
[41:54] a testimony, a real
[41:55] testimony in the Bible, they had to
[41:58] leave the Easter Jordan and make a name
[42:01] for themselves, right? be connected with
[42:04] the the the God in
[42:07] Canaan. We can see here that they were
[42:09] carried away and they were mixed through
[42:11] marriage with the
[42:12] heathen and they transgressed against
[42:14] the God of their fathers and went a
[42:16] whoring after the gods of the people of
[42:17] the land whom God destroyed before them.
[42:19] Think of what they were to do before. Do
[42:22] not defile the land. Leviticus says, "Do
[42:23] not defile the land." And God the God of
[42:25] Israel stirred up the spirit of Paul,
[42:27] king of Assyria. And the spirit uh the
[42:30] king of Assyria, I'm not going to list
[42:32] my way through that. Uh it sounds like a
[42:34] be a beer. Tilgath
[42:36] Pilzner. And he carried he carried them
[42:40] away, even the Reubenites and the
[42:41] Gadites and the half tribe of Manasseh
[42:43] and brought them under Halah and Habore
[42:46] and Harrah into the river Goan unto this
[42:48] day. These are the ones that are carried
[42:51] away. These are the ones that are
[42:52] destroyed.
[42:54] They're mixed among the heathen, the
[42:58] Assyrians, into these other
[43:00] nations. They weren't
[43:03] safe where they
[43:08] dwelled, become a mixed
[43:11] country. The the the history is that
[43:13] they would have been outside the
[43:15] promise. They would have intermarried.
[43:16] They their traditions and their beliefs
[43:18] would have been mingled with a lot of
[43:20] these other nations on the other side of
[43:23] Jordan. and to see what kind of nature
[43:26] they take on. We really want to expose
[43:29] uh kind of what's at the heart of this
[43:32] kind of unbelieving
[43:34] spirit. Next service hopefully we'll get
[43:36] into how that this attitude that they
[43:38] took was in the image and the spirit of
[43:40] those at Kadesh Barnea. So it's a spirit
[43:43] that's always wanting to stop short,
[43:45] right?
[43:47] It can experience certain things, have
[43:48] certain things, but it stops short. So
[43:51] if you go and read in in Mark chapter 5
[43:53] or or Matthew 8 and also in the book of
[43:55] Luke, the story is told. But it says,
[43:58] "And they came over into the side of the
[43:59] sea into the land of the Gatherines, the
[44:02] land of Gad." It's on the the side of
[44:05] the sea that would have been east of the
[44:08] sea, east of Jordan. It's the land of
[44:09] the Gatherines, the place that the
[44:11] Gadites and the tribe of Gad had
[44:12] settled. And there Jesus finds one among
[44:15] the tombs and among the dead, one named
[44:17] Legion, who was possessed with many
[44:18] devils. That's right. And Jesus heals
[44:22] Legion in this land of Gad. And then
[44:25] verse 16 says, "The people round about
[44:28] they saw and they saw it and they run
[44:30] into the city and they run into the town
[44:32] and they run around and begin to tell."
[44:34] And it says they saw they that saw it
[44:36] told them how it befell him that was
[44:38] possessed with the devil and also
[44:39] concerning the swine.
[44:42] An interesting note that these Gadites
[44:45] who knew the truth but didn't live
[44:48] it, they're supposed to be Israelites,
[44:50] right? Why are they hurting swine,
[44:54] right? Why why would what what use would
[44:56] they have for it?
[44:58] They were entrepreneurial. They said,
[45:00] "Well, we're growing this for the other
[45:02] people who use it." I'm not doing the
[45:04] drugs. I'm just selling
[45:06] them. And so, there is this
[45:09] disobedience.
[45:10] They hear of the swine. They hear of the
[45:12] miracle. This man that they all knew
[45:13] that was possessed with the strength
[45:15] that was beyond human. He's cast out.
[45:18] And then Matthew 8:34 says, "And behold,
[45:21] the whole city came out to meet Jesus."
[45:23] Now follow this. They hear of their
[45:26] miracles, they go to meet him. And when
[45:28] they saw
[45:30] him, Matthew 8:34, this is important
[45:33] way. It's described. They come out to
[45:35] meet him. The testimonies, the miracles
[45:37] attract them. They come out to meet him.
[45:39] And when they saw him, they besought him
[45:40] that he would depart out of their
[45:42] coasts.
[45:45] They may be drawn to him. They may hear
[45:48] of something. You won't believe what
[45:49] just happened down in the tombs. You
[45:50] won't believe this happened. You
[45:51] remember this. You remember that. And
[45:53] there's this buzz. There's this thing.
[45:54] They come out to meet him. But then the
[45:56] the spirit of Cain, the spirit of Lot,
[45:58] the spirit of Esau, the spirit of the
[46:00] Moabites is resurrected in the tribes of
[46:02] Reuben, Gad, and half of Manasseh. And
[46:05] when they see Christ, they don't want
[46:07] him.
[46:10] and they ask
[46:12] Christ to
[46:14] depart from their borders.
[46:17] Catch that.
[46:19] Christ has actually come on the other
[46:21] side of the Jordan. Christ is on the
[46:24] other side of the sea. He's going out
[46:26] and he's manifest himself. He's
[46:28] declaring himself. He's revealing
[46:29] himself. But they don't want to have
[46:30] anything to do with it. And that's the
[46:33] spirit that that is associated with this
[46:35] attitude. It's always borderline,
[46:38] always just outside of the frame, always
[46:40] trying to move the focus. It's less
[46:45] to the core.
[46:47] Not all in, but not all out.
[46:51] They might want some of the works, but
[46:52] not the complete works.
[46:55] This is what Leodysa rejects when they
[46:57] kiss uh they kick Christ out of the
[46:59] church and give him a a Juditarian kiss.
[47:04] This is what that spirit of
[47:05] Pentecostalism that exists in that
[47:07] Leodysian age that doesn't want you to
[47:09] go further. That's what Pentecostal is.
[47:12] No uh nothing more, nothing less.
[47:14] Pentecostalism is either intellectualism
[47:15] or emotionalism that keeps you from
[47:17] going all the way into the full word.
[47:21] This is what they didn't want was
[47:25] Christ. Get out of our
[47:28] coast. Something had attracted them.
[47:30] They're drawn to it. But now in the
[47:32] final, they're saying, you know what? We
[47:33] don't want this. We're happy where we
[47:34] are, the way we
[47:39] are. Let's look at Deuteronomy
[47:43] 11:es 13-15 and then Numbers 32:es 1 and
[47:47] 5. Let's look at these
[47:48] together and go through this maybe side
[47:51] by side. And it shall come to pass, if
[47:54] you shall hearken diligently unto my
[47:55] commandments, Deuteronomy 11 13:14 and
[47:59] 15, if you'll hearken diligently unto my
[48:02] commandments, which I command you this
[48:04] day, to love the Lord your God, and to
[48:05] serve him with all your heart and with
[48:06] all your soul. That's those that hear.
[48:09] Not just having ears and not hearing,
[48:11] but hearing and obeying that I will give
[48:14] you the rain of your land in his due
[48:16] season. And the first rain and the
[48:18] latter rain, that thou mayest gather in
[48:19] thy corn and thy wine and thy oil. And I
[48:22] will send grass in thy fields for thy
[48:25] cattle that thou mayest eat and be
[48:28] full. They would have whatever they
[48:31] needed.
[48:33] corn, grapes, olives, grass for
[48:38] cattle. I was thinking about this. The
[48:41] things a land flowing with milk and
[48:42] honey. Could you imagine if you gave
[48:45] your children the choice? Would you want
[48:48] heavy whipping cream and honey? Would
[48:49] you want milk and honey or garlic and
[48:51] leaks? What are they going to choose?
[48:54] Well, help me out here. Milk and honey.
[48:58] Chase, what would you want? Okay. I'm
[49:00] kind of I like onions, but it's uni,
[49:03] right? Honey. They chose onions and
[49:06] leaks. That's what they wanted instead
[49:07] of milk and honey. Something's wrong
[49:08] somewhere, right? But this is what God
[49:11] promised. He said, "Promise them
[49:12] things." He said, "I will be there if
[49:14] you believe God's presence, provision,
[49:16] protection. We'll be with you. I will
[49:18] give you the first, the former rain, and
[49:20] the latter rain. You'll be able to grow
[49:21] your wheat. You'll be able to grow your
[49:23] corn. You'll be able to grow your
[49:24] grapes. You'll be able to grow your
[49:25] olives. And not only that, you'll have
[49:26] enough grass to feed your cattle wherein
[49:28] you'll have your milk and you'll have
[49:29] your you'll have your uh uh your meats.
[49:33] My what a promise.
[49:36] But at the very moment that this tribes
[49:39] of Reuben and Gad notice and then I want
[49:41] you to see it that's where it starts and
[49:43] it influences half the tribe of
[49:44] Manasseh. Verse one of Numbers 32. Now
[49:46] the children of Reuben and the children
[49:47] of Gad had a very great multitude of
[49:49] cattle. And when they saw the land of
[49:51] Jazer and the land of Gilead, that
[49:52] behold the place was a place for cattle.
[49:57] Just as Lot had looked at the very same
[49:59] plains and said, "These are well
[50:01] watered, lot of provision here. I'll
[50:03] take my flocks here." They're now acting
[50:06] in the very image of Lot. and they see
[50:08] this and instead of remind remember
[50:10] remembering what the messenger said
[50:13] instead of recognizing that there was
[50:15] going to be a whole new field opened up
[50:17] that they realized that there was going
[50:18] to be the revealing of Christ and this
[50:20] new land of the son of man opened up and
[50:22] that there they would have all these
[50:24] things rain former and latter corn wine
[50:27] oil you name it salvation divine healing
[50:31] signs wonders miracles all in that land
[50:34] they
[50:35] stop and they see something that will
[50:37] suit what they have. And they say in
[50:40] verse 5, wherefore said they, if we
[50:42] found grace in thy sight, let this land
[50:44] be given unto thy servants for
[50:45] possession, and bring us not over
[50:47] Jordan. Now, let me ask you
[50:50] this. Did they believe what God
[50:54] said? When God said, "I will give you
[50:56] rain for your land and grass for your
[50:59] cattle," did they just not believe him?
[51:04] Or was it they didn't want the
[51:08] consequences of
[51:11] it? Remember, the rain for their
[51:14] land and the grass for their cattle
[51:17] would mean they'd have to accept the
[51:19] full word of God.
[51:21] It would change things.
[51:24] Might not look as good and welcoming as
[51:26] the other side. The grass was greener on
[51:28] the other side in this case. It was
[51:31] already there. They didn't want to look
[51:32] at a barren field and trust that God
[51:34] would send his word and by the word
[51:37] bring forth fruit.
[51:41] That's the question I'm posing today.
[51:44] Did they just not believe
[51:46] God or in their heart of hearts did they
[51:49] not really want him?
[51:52] Did they not really love
[51:54] him and asked to
[51:57] settle outside the full word of God and
[52:00] the word
[52:01] only because they didn't want the
[52:04] consequences of taking God at his word
[52:06] fully trusting and obeying.
[52:12] And this has great significance to the
[52:14] time you're living in now.
[52:16] Very tremendous symmetry. Appropriate,
[52:19] applicable. I know for some of us you
[52:21] may think, well, it seems like I'm
[52:23] picking up a theme on some of the things
[52:24] that brother Aaron's teaching on these
[52:26] last uh year or so. And I would say that
[52:29] absolutely there are things that are
[52:31] going on h around around the message
[52:34] that are designed by Satan to distract
[52:37] us to take away from the message that
[52:40] God sent us that we have a message. It
[52:42] was complete. It was perfect. We're not
[52:44] looking for something else to happen uh
[52:46] uh to unfold uh uh uh to to point us to
[52:49] Christ or to do something. It it it's
[52:50] come. It's happened. It's finished. Now,
[52:52] there's a people that are to take that
[52:54] message and fully possess the land
[52:55] that's been given them. And there's a
[52:57] spirit that wants to drag us back to
[52:59] something else. Keep us on the wrong
[53:01] side of the promise, going back to the
[53:02] things that had been done before. Live
[53:04] in the glare of another age.
[53:09] And and if and if you haven't been
[53:11] touched by that, I thank God. I'm always
[53:13] very reluctant to bring things up that
[53:15] might expose us to things going on and
[53:17] if we have nothing to know about it a
[53:20] and it's never been mentioned before.
[53:21] I've had conversations with brothers uh
[53:24] that I admire that I I look up to and
[53:26] would want them to minister but because
[53:28] of the things they have a tendency to
[53:29] try to bring up. I say, "Hey, my people
[53:31] don't need to hear that."
[53:33] I said, "Well, I I don't know that
[53:34] that's something I do." Okay. Well, you
[53:39] do. But there's a a man of God is
[53:42] commissioned to block so things out of
[53:44] your so far away from your mind that
[53:46] when these things come up, try to split
[53:47] families, try to lead people astray, you
[53:49] say, "Wait a minute, wait a minute,
[53:50] that's not the word of God."
[53:53] In Revelations 22 17 to 21, I want to
[53:57] read this again because I want to just
[53:58] use this to bring it down to the day
[54:00] that we're living in now. And the spirit
[54:02] and the bride say, "Come." The bride are
[54:05] saying what the spirit said. Come. not
[54:09] stop short. The spir spirit said, "This
[54:12] is the land that I'll give you for an
[54:14] inheritance." And the bride says, "I
[54:16] want it."
[54:18] The bride is placed in that land. And so
[54:20] she says that the spirit says, "Come."
[54:21] This is the land of promise. Let him
[54:23] that heareth say come. And let him that
[54:25] are thirst come. And whosoever let him
[54:27] take the water of life freely. This is
[54:30] not just a tasting. This is drinking it
[54:32] in, eating it up. And then it says, for
[54:34] I testify unto every man that heareth
[54:36] the words of the prophecy of this book.
[54:38] If any man shall add unto these, God
[54:40] will add unto him the plagues that are
[54:41] written in this book. If you shift the
[54:43] focus, you say, "Well, that's the land
[54:46] plus Pentecost plus whatever it is they
[54:49] call it these days, redefine what the
[54:52] the true revival is for the bride of
[54:54] Christ. If any man will add to these
[54:56] things, he's adding to himself the
[54:57] plagues. And if any man shall take away
[54:59] from the words of the book, we can't
[55:01] take away. Can't go into something where
[55:04] we start cutting uh dividing the
[55:06] atonement in half.
[55:08] If you take away from the words of this
[55:09] book of this prophecy, God shall take
[55:11] away his part of the book of life out of
[55:14] the holy city and from the things which
[55:15] are written in this book a lot of layers
[55:18] to that and what are we taught the words
[55:21] of that book are him
[55:24] different ways it's described and all
[55:25] that is all that is in there is the
[55:28] believer the book of redemption that
[55:30] marriage certificate your identification
[55:33] that's what this book is
[55:36] so if you take the promised land and you
[55:38] take Canaan and say this is where God
[55:40] said he was leading all of his people
[55:42] and then you just try to try to add to
[55:45] it a little bit right say well but it
[55:48] also included this you're adding too but
[55:52] then to try to take it away and narrow
[55:53] it down to just a sliver or to this you
[55:56] are taking to adding adding to or taking
[55:58] away from the words of the book
[56:02] we're living in a time Revelations 10:7
[56:04] that the mystery of God is to be
[56:05] finished amen
[56:07] The opening of those seals is the
[56:09] mystery of God that's going to be
[56:10] complete. Brother B said he will now
[56:12] fulfill through his bride that work
[56:13] which he left for this specific time.
[56:16] There's this invitation at this time to
[56:18] take the book and eat it to possess it.
[56:22] Amen. God's hidden mystery. The complete
[56:24] works will be revealed will be
[56:26] manifested. He says Christ revealed in
[56:28] his own word. The complete body of
[56:29] Christ is revealed in the form of a
[56:30] bride. The full word born into
[56:33] manifestation. It's the complete
[56:37] works. That's the time that we're living
[56:39] in now.
[56:41] It's not itchy ear theology. It's not
[56:44] emotionalism, not intellectualism. It's
[56:46] the reality that God is framing a bride
[56:49] for a rapture.
[56:51] In that land was where that resurrection
[56:53] was going to be. Joseph said, "Don't
[56:54] bury my bones. Don't leave them in
[56:56] Egypt. I want to be there in that land
[56:58] of resurrection, that land of promise.
[57:02] I'm going to compl a complete work.
[57:05] Philippians 1:6, being confident of this
[57:07] very thing,
[57:10] that he which hath begun a good work in
[57:12] you will perform it until the day of
[57:15] Christ. Perform it. Well, I know when we
[57:19] say perform something there, there's if
[57:21] it's a performance, we might think
[57:23] theatrical, we might think art or or a
[57:25] play, a a piece of music. He's going to
[57:29] perform it. It almost has this ongoing
[57:31] sense. He's going to keep working, but
[57:34] it means to perfect it. It's going to
[57:36] finally come into completion.
[57:39] He which has begun a work in you will
[57:42] complete it.
[57:46] In the day of Christ, he's going to
[57:48] finish it. Hebrews 12:2 says that he is
[57:51] the author. I He's the author. He's the
[57:53] one that wrote it and finisher.
[57:57] He's the author of our faith. He's also
[57:59] the complete, the finisher of our faith.
[58:00] The God who wrote the
[58:02] Bible is the author, the creator of your
[58:05] faith, and he will be the one that will
[58:06] complete his work. You're part of this
[58:09] complete work.
[58:11] Psalms 138:8 says, "The Lord will
[58:13] perfect that which concernth me. Thy
[58:15] mercy, oh Lord, endureth forever. He
[58:18] will perfect you." Amen. He will do it.
[58:23] You know, it's fine right now if we just
[58:24] accept that in my flesh dwelleth no good
[58:26] thing.
[58:28] that I am I'm not good enough. My
[58:30] righteousness is filthy rags. My mind
[58:32] struggles. I make mistakes. My body gets
[58:35] sick. I'm weak in all these things. But
[58:37] he which hath begun a good work in me,
[58:39] he will finish it. He is the author and
[58:42] the finisher, the perfector of my faith.
[58:44] The Lord will perfect that which
[58:47] pertains to me. So therefore, I cry out,
[58:51] "Oh Lord, endure, forsake not the works
[58:54] of thine own hands." Amen.
[58:57] Forsake not the works of thine own
[59:00] hands. You are a work in progress. You
[59:04] are the works of his hands.
[59:06] For whatever reason, those two and a
[59:08] half
[59:09] tribes stop short of the promise.
[59:13] Whatever they r whatever their rationale
[59:15] was, whatever was working within each
[59:16] one of those leaders minds to say,
[59:18] "We're not more. We're not able to take
[59:20] it. I don't know. The ground doesn't
[59:21] look good. I'm afraid that our cattle
[59:23] are going to die out here. We're not
[59:24] really olive farmers. we're not really
[59:27] we this is a better place for us
[59:30] whatever the reason
[59:34] was. They settled outside the
[59:38] picture. And I want us to be so
[59:40] confident that God's going to finish
[59:42] this
[59:43] not for one moment will we let go of the
[59:46] promise.
[59:48] Brothers, if you could come to your
[59:50] instruments in the statement from the
[59:52] events made clear by prophecy, brother
[59:53] Brandham said, "It's the
[59:55] complete body of Jesus
[59:58] Christ and in Christ being the male, the
[1:00:01] groom, the bride is represented in him
[1:00:02] also and these two are one. At that day
[1:00:05] you'll know that I am in the father, the
[1:00:06] father and me and I and you and you and
[1:00:08] me." He says, "What a complete picture."
[1:00:14] And the true believers in this word who
[1:00:16] accept it that way believe it and with
[1:00:19] patience wait for its prophesied
[1:00:21] promises every one of them to be
[1:00:23] manifested in its age. That's what we
[1:00:26] need to do. Don't get nervous. Don't get
[1:00:29] worried. Don't
[1:00:34] fret instead of doubting what the
[1:00:36] prophet said. Instead of doubting God's
[1:00:39] promises and trying to be a revisionist
[1:00:41] and say, "Oh, well, maybe it means this
[1:00:42] and maybe it means that." Just because
[1:00:44] things get slow down or things aren't
[1:00:46] happening like we think they should, God
[1:00:48] is testing us.
[1:00:50] Take me at my word. Believe that all
[1:00:52] things are
[1:00:54] possible. True believers will accept it,
[1:00:57] believe it, and with patience wait for
[1:00:59] it to be manifested in its time and in
[1:01:02] its season. Amen. The complete works,
[1:01:05] which you are a part of. You're the
[1:01:07] completion of this mystery. If Christ is
[1:01:09] the mystery of God revealed, you have
[1:01:11] become the mystery of Christ. The
[1:01:13] mystery of God finished complete. God in
[1:01:17] the beginning who was
[1:01:18] invisible made himself fully manifested
[1:01:21] in son now fully manifested in you the
[1:01:23] bride to complete the picture.
[1:01:28] where we may be
[1:01:29] weak, where we may be anxious or
[1:01:32] nervous. 1 Thessalonians 3:10, Paul said
[1:01:35] of th them night and day, I'm praying
[1:01:36] exceedingly that we might see your
[1:01:38] face and might perfect that which is
[1:01:42] lacking in your
[1:01:44] faith. Lord, I believe. Help thou my
[1:01:46] unbelief.
[1:01:48] Lord, perfect what is lacking in my
[1:01:50] faith. when I ministered on uh unbelief
[1:01:54] the first service in these few services
[1:01:56] about
[1:01:57] uh what is sin and it's
[1:02:01] unbelief
[1:02:02] [Music]
[1:02:05] and it had a deep impact with some of
[1:02:07] the ones that I fellowshipped with it it
[1:02:09] really resonated even with
[1:02:11] me because I in my heart even for myself
[1:02:15] I want I want to take God at his
[1:02:17] word even in my moments of weakness or
[1:02:20] my past mistakes, I still want to
[1:02:22] believe God's word. That those have no
[1:02:25] power, those things have no power over
[1:02:27] me. That if it be chronic illness, by
[1:02:30] his stripes, I'm healed. If it be a
[1:02:33] frequent uh uh uh discouragements, he's
[1:02:36] my joy. And not ex except for a moment
[1:02:40] that any one of those things have to
[1:02:42] become a permanent uh uh uh bondage to
[1:02:45] me.
[1:02:47] that any one of those things have to
[1:02:48] become something for me to fear
[1:02:54] and instead of looking at it from the
[1:02:56] standpoint of well if you do this and I
[1:02:58] think this could become real for a lot
[1:02:59] of us if you do this that's an attribute
[1:03:01] of sin that's an attribute of unbelief
[1:03:02] and therefore convince ourselves that
[1:03:04] we're unbelievers convince ourselves
[1:03:06] that faith is more than enough and that
[1:03:09] I have I recognize that that thing is
[1:03:13] what I need to overcome and it's the
[1:03:15] evidence of unbelief But faith is the
[1:03:17] victory.
[1:03:18] Unbelief is not the victory. It's not
[1:03:20] going to have power. It's not greater
[1:03:22] than my faith. And so though I might see
[1:03:25] something that seems to be a stronghold,
[1:03:26] I give myself over to it. It's a
[1:03:28] weakness. That faith is the victory. And
[1:03:31] that I've got to have confidence that
[1:03:32] greater is he that is in me than he that
[1:03:35] is in that world. Greater is he that is
[1:03:38] in the promise. Greater is he that is in
[1:03:40] you than that the Moabites, than the
[1:03:42] Lot, than the Esau. Say, "Well, I got an
[1:03:43] Esau in me. I got a lot in me. I got a
[1:03:45] Moabiti in me. I've got these struggles.
[1:03:47] I got these weaknesses. God is greater.
[1:03:50] And that in Christ, you're more than a
[1:03:51] match for it. That this is what if
[1:03:54] that's what you need to overcome and you
[1:03:56] keep falling and you keep falling. You
[1:03:58] keep falling. That's the attributes of a
[1:04:00] misapplying faith.
[1:04:02] [Music]
[1:04:03] So you have faith and you need to
[1:04:06] perfect what is lacking in your faith
[1:04:07] and you need to believe that God in you
[1:04:11] has o already overcome it. Amen. It's
[1:04:15] dead. It's defeated. It's on the wrong
[1:04:16] side. It's been spewed out of the lamb.
[1:04:18] If you land, if you have been led into
[1:04:20] Christ, if you're in this promised land
[1:04:22] of the baptism of the Holy Ghost, then
[1:04:24] fight for every inch of ground. No
[1:04:26] Philistines are allowed in here. No
[1:04:28] Moabites, Ammonites, uh you name it. Not
[1:04:31] allowed in there.
[1:04:34] Find yourself fight with them. Wake
[1:04:35] yourself up. Say, "No, I'm not going to
[1:04:37] settle on the wrong side of Jordan where
[1:04:39] all the wickedness has been spewed out
[1:04:42] and now dwells. I want to get into
[1:04:44] Revelations 4. I want to come up a
[1:04:45] little bit higher. An entrance has been
[1:04:47] ministered unto us. I want to go all the
[1:04:49] way into the full word of God. And I
[1:04:50] want to believe that Christ has already
[1:04:52] overcome all these things. I believe for
[1:04:55] it
[1:04:56] and I'm going to hold on to faith.
[1:04:59] Amen. Fight for every inch of
[1:05:02] ground because that's what you are.
[1:05:04] You're a believer,
[1:05:06] not a
[1:05:08] makeeliever. and bring under subjection
[1:05:11] even as Paul says that there was given
[1:05:13] to me a messenger of Satan to buffet me
[1:05:17] but grace was sufficient.
[1:05:20] You might have a lot of thorns. We might
[1:05:21] have a lot of have a lot of necessary
[1:05:23] evils in our lives but don't ever don't
[1:05:25] ever let them make you think you're a
[1:05:27] makebeliever. Don't ever let them poke
[1:05:30] you to the point to where you'll settle
[1:05:31] on the wrong side of the promise. Have
[1:05:33] that kind of bulldog faith to take God
[1:05:36] at his word and believe whatever it is.
[1:05:37] If it's deliverance, if it's healing,
[1:05:39] whatever it is, believe for it cuz
[1:05:42] that's what's going to take for a
[1:05:43] rapture
[1:05:45] is to keep believing. God bless you.
[1:05:47] Let's stand
[1:05:49] today. I believe we'll be very soon
[1:05:51] going into our fellowship and our
[1:05:55] lunch. God is so good to us. Let's bow
[1:05:59] our heads in a word of
[1:06:02] prayer if we could. My prayer for myself
[1:06:06] is Lord perfect that which is lacking in
[1:06:08] my faith. Your word doesn't lack. Your
[1:06:12] faith doesn't lack. Perfect what's
[1:06:13] lacking in my attitude, my approach, my
[1:06:16] spirit. Lord, perfect anything that may
[1:06:19] be lacking. If that's your prayer, you
[1:06:20] could just pray together. If you have a
[1:06:22] need today, just lift your hand before
[1:06:24] the Lord. He sees your heart. He knows
[1:06:25] your
[1:06:26] need. Our gracious heavenly father,
[1:06:28] Lord, today as we bow our heads and our
[1:06:31] hearts before you. We thank you for your
[1:06:33] kindness towards us. The graciousness
[1:06:36] with which you inhabit our
[1:06:40] lives. We don't feel bullied. We don't
[1:06:43] feel
[1:06:44] defeated. We don't feel that we're
[1:06:47] inconvenience in
[1:06:50] you. Lord, I was pondering
[1:06:53] it even this morning, Lord. how the
[1:06:56] Bible says you go everywhere or brother
[1:06:58] Brandham taught that you go everywhere
[1:06:59] you're invited
[1:07:01] even if you're not
[1:07:04] welcome and Lord have we invited you but
[1:07:08] not made you
[1:07:10] welcome and Lord if we made you
[1:07:12] unwelcome you just you sit there like a
[1:07:16] [Music]
[1:07:18] wallflower but Lord I'm so thankful for
[1:07:20] the ones
[1:07:23] who come to your feet and and they pour
[1:07:25] out their tears and they anoint your
[1:07:27] feet and they begin to worship you and
[1:07:29] their lives are so
[1:07:31] fragrant that it reminds us of what's
[1:07:33] valuable and what's
[1:07:35] true and Lord is set instead of sitting
[1:07:38] a far off as a Pharisee or a scribe or a
[1:07:41] priest and
[1:07:44] criticizing I want to join that one at
[1:07:46] your feet
[1:07:47] today. I want to choose that good part
[1:07:50] which will not be taken away from me.
[1:07:52] And I want to sit at your
[1:07:55] feet. I want to drink of the waters of
[1:07:57] life
[1:07:59] freely. I want to rest in your
[1:08:02] presence. I want to trust you for all
[1:08:04] things.
[1:08:06] Lord, if there be in in us a wicked
[1:08:08] heart of unbelief,
[1:08:09] Lord, that shadow in our minds, that
[1:08:12] ghost of our
[1:08:14] past that would cause us to look at the
[1:08:16] promise and say, "You're not able to do
[1:08:18] it and not believe you." Or would cause
[1:08:20] us to look at the promise and think the
[1:08:21] cost is too
[1:08:23] great. To fear the
[1:08:26] consequences to maybe want the blessings
[1:08:29] without the true
[1:08:32] presence. Forgive us, Lord. Forgive
[1:08:36] us, Lord. We love you today. We're so
[1:08:38] thankful for your presence. Be with us
[1:08:40] now as we fellowship, as we're
[1:08:42] together. And these moments that we have
[1:08:45] may seem to be a lot of activity here at
[1:08:47] the beginning of the year, but as the
[1:08:48] heat wears
[1:08:49] on, we'll subside in some of these
[1:08:51] afternoon gatherings. So, may we enjoy
[1:08:53] it while we have the opportunity, Lord.
[1:08:55] We love you. We ask all this in the name
[1:08:56] of Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
