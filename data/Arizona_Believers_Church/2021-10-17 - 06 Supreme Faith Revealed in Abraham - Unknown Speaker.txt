TRANSCRIPT
========================================
genesis chapter 12 i'd like to begin with verse 9 and read to verse 13. and abraham excuse me and abram journeyed going on still toward the south and there was a famine in the land and abram went down into egypt to soldier and therefore the famine was grievous in the land and it came to pass when he was come near to enter into egypt that he said unto sarah his wife behold now i know that thou art a fair woman to look upon therefore it shall come to pass when the egyptians shall see thee that they shall say this is his wife and they will kill me but they will save thee alive say i pray thee thou art my sister that it may be well with me for thy sake and my soul shall live because of thee you may be seated i hope to come to these verses uh fairly quickly this morning and i have a very uh i think a very uh brie uh i'm trying to think of the right way to say it so i don't create unreasonable expectations but just a very uh compact thought a very simple not maybe very broad or cover a lot of ground but just a very direct succinct compact thought to share with you today and it's continuing on the subject of supreme faith revealed in abraham and the last few services we were looking at the offering of isaac upon the altar in genesis chapter 22 and how james remarked that this was where abraham's faith was made perfect and it was in that act that supreme faith was expressed and we've been looking at how that it was connected with rapturing faith or the belief that god had power over death or could preserve life and so we've been making this point and i want to start kind of blend now to continue to emphasize that particular aspect that we've been looking at the last few services but now kind of begin to look at his life as a journey because his life holds a pattern for us and his example shows a type for us and especially for rapturing faith and especially he has been set forth and determined to be an example for the believer today in this hour that we're living now in in a laodicea in a third exodus in a time of a rapture and we've been using a statement from baum and gilead where brother branham said that we've got to move up into supreme faith and he says to do that you have to perfectly know what you're doing and he talks about how there's these regular acts of faith that we do every day and that that's the way that it is with god that there's you trust god on a daily basis and you trust him so much and he comes through and fulfills his word so often that it just becomes he says regular routine and he says that's the way the rapture is going to be just being in the regular routine of following the scripture and god's plan so we look at abraham's faith and we see that it grew as he routinely trusted god's promises to him his faith grew as he as a matter of routine as a matter of habit and discipline he believed whatever god said he watched god fulfill it and that grew his faith and he could arise to meet the next challenge and you'll also begin to see even today as we read we'll begin in genesis chapter 11 that there is uh he hears the word and he obeys and there's acts of obedience and there's acts of worship and and there was overt acts and obvious acts of worship where he's building an altar and he's expressing a different worship contrary to the prevailing worship of the time that he was living in and so this is where i want to kind of reset on some things that we said at the very outset when we began to minister several parts ago is that with abraham he was an ordinary man he was there was nothing about his lineage nor was there anything about his life that stood out to where god would say you're righteous man you're a worthy man but god chose him by grace and so he's an ordinary man whom god elected and then makes an unconditional promise to him and this is different than the promise he made to adam it's different than the promise he made to noah he now chooses and we can say with adam you can say there's an election involved but he's the involved but there's only one man and then you can say with noah he makes a covenant with noah and you say well there's there certainly is a grace and an election involved but when he makes the covenant there's only one patriarch there he's the he's the father who carries his family over on the other side of the flood and those covenants were were a conditional if you will i will but with abraham something we've got to recognize is that god makes an unconditional promise to him and he chooses abraham out of multitudes of people by election and this is this will be my theme today something an underlying theme that i hope to visit uh a few times as we go forward in the scriptures today abraham is the father of our faith he's a legend in scripture he's the father of the nation of israel he's the father of faith to the spiritual seed and the royal seed of abraham he is the he's even the father of islam and he's looked to by billions of people in the world today as the father of their faith and their religion and his faith is memorialized in the new testament and he's constantly referred to by jesus and even those in the days of of christ who defended themselves we are of our father abraham and he has such extraordinary faith and his record uh especially once you get to the new testament is pristine and he believed god and he staggered not in unbelief and so being our father of faith we almost can make him an idol of our faith just something that we venerate and admire and look up to but we never feel that we could walk in those steps and so we make his faith impossible to achieve or impractical in the time that we're living in but what i want to do today is begin to make his faith relatable to where we begin to look at his life and then his faith and be able to relate and say oh well abraham's responding and we won't be exhausted today but he's responding to certain situations maybe in the same way i would and then yet you see that his faith comes on the scene open uh ultimately and then we can have courage that our faith will arise and meet the challenge whenever we're put in a situation that we need it so we want to make his faith relatable and then also encourage our faith to grow now if you'll take your bibles and look at genesis chapter 11 or take your eyes your bifocals your glasses your slideshow your ipad your phone however it is you'll take the scriptures today but if you'll take your bibles and turn to genesis chapter 11 i want to begin reading in verse 29 and then continue into chapter 12 for several verses i think maybe 13 verses or so in chapter 12 just to kind of read this narrative and pick up on a specific theme in the text that we read or a particular incident so it says in abram and nehor took them wives the name of abram's wife was sarah and the name of nehor's wife milka the daughter of haran the father of milka and the father of iska it's interesting that a number of people commentators believe that iska was also sarah but um it's kind of difficult maybe to come to that conclusion but it reads really that milka and iska are um children of haran so nehor's wife is milka the daughter of haran you see that there's half siblings that are marrying and then in verse 30 it says but sarah was barren she had no child and that's very interesting as you read this but it is setting us up as an important context to abraham's life and his mindset and his family life and and even things that were natural or things that were physically possible for him abraham has a wife but his wife is barren she has no children he has no children and then it just kind of continues in the narrative but i want you to notice how the scripture even before we really learn uh see what's taking place almost in this genealogy it's no abraham has no children and that sarah herself is barren and tara took abram his son and lot the son of haran his son's son and sarah his daughter-in-law his son abra abram's wife and they went forth with them from ur of the chaldees to go into the land of canaan now it's we understand that abram's the one that's called terror going with him as the father is giving kind of the credit as the leader but yet we know according to uh the new testament and other places that it's god that called abram in ur and it's his move that kind of attracts his father and other family members to go with them and they came unto haran and dwelt there and the days of terror were 205 years and terra died in haren so that kind of gives us some background to the life of abram he marries his half-sister sarah he's leaving with his brother and his wives and he's leaving with his father and they leave ur and they go into haren and it's believed that abraham was about 70 years old when god called him out of her and he moved to haran and he's in haran for about five years so he's there for about a five year period before god then moves him out of haran and as he moves out of her end the scripture wants us to recognize that his father stays behind and ultimately his father dies in haran so abram is called further they all go out together five-year period and haran then abram's called further his father remains behind and his father passes away but what we read in genesis 11 and even one thing that kind of reinforced my desire and the inspiration to use these scriptures at the outset is these are the first steps of abraham's progressive obedience to god's promises when we read this these are the first steps of his journey of faith and so it may not seem to be very extraordinary and it may even just seem to be a little bit not of a direct line and maybe not fully in compliance with what god asked him to do as we see here in a moment these are the first steps and we're going to read in genesis chapter 12 what god asked him to do but no matter how small they may seem or how much in the wrong direction it may seem that he's going or how much of time it took for him to take the step and finally find the place that god would show him these are the first steps of abraham's progressive revelation and progressive obedience to god's word and we look at it and liken it to a journey of faith and so abraham is in a journey of faith and we want to make that relatable to us that we are in a journey of faith and and you see different people's uh ministries or their lives their testimonies and we start because we're wired to compare we start comparing and trying to measure up and maybe your testimony doesn't seem as extraordinary as somebody else's but i tell you it will be just as ordinary as abraham's because god speaks to him and he begins to obey and whatever small measure it is in in whatever way that he can obey it however else it progressed i believe that it can become relatable now the scripture tells us that lot his nephew leaves with abraham and i just feel to point this out because it um it's part of a theme in abraham's life that it doesn't seem to be wrong on its faith face that lot would leave with him but as you read the next verses you'll see how god had asked him to separate and god isn't going to further unfold his promise nor is he going to bless abraham until he fully separates that's an important part to recognize so then in verse 1 of chapter 12 now the lord had said and this is if we just kind of took the chapter out of it this we kind of just read together as it's saying that abram leaves er he leaves quran he's coming down he's going to be coming down south then this is why because god had spoken to him now the lord had said unto abram get thee out of thy country in from thy kindred and from thy father's house unto a land that i will show thee let's recognize this is god's calling he calls abram by election this is his calling this is him singling him out this is god speaking to him but then it's also important for us to recognize that this is god's command god has given him a command leave your country leave your father's house leave your people and he had left the country but yet as he journeys to haran he still has his father there he has his nephew there he has his kindred and family there and then as he begins to leave her on his family is still following yet he's walking by faith as we see here unto a land that i will show thee he's walking by faith to an unknown land and if you looked at it on a map and you saw his journey from ur of the caldis and you saw his journey it would look to be maybe the most logical geographical route to take into canaan and following along a river and following a a easier geological path uh than maybe any other way that he could go so he's following in the right path and ultimately five years later so he's making his way now he's going to begin to journey down south as it says that um abram is is goes forth from ur and then he comes to iran and he's going to be there for so long and he's going to be called out so it says abram get thee out of that country this is god's command this is god's calling now verse two to me is uh i want this just to be absorbed you absorb it and really think about the implications like if god made this promise to you what could you immediately begin to assume it says and i will make of thee a great nation and i will bless thee i'm going to make you a great nation and think of this i will bless thee and make thy name great and thou shalt be a blessing and i will bless them that bless thee and curse him that curseth thee and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed there's a lot this is a mouthful there's a lot here that you could just cabbage down on for a very very very long time but this is the first covenant of god with abraham and it's the foundational promise what's contained here is the foundational promise that abraham seeks after the very things that god says here i'll make you a great nation and i will bless thee i'll make your name great you're going to be a blessing and then to say that all the families and the earth are going to be blessed this is what abraham is following after and seeking from the very moment that god speaks to him and when he says i'll make thee a great nation it means i'm going to cause you to be a father of a great nation i'm going to cause you to be a father of many descendants now we read this and we immediately go back to genesis 11 30 that says but sarah has no children abraham has no children he has one wife he has no children but yet now god is promising abram that i'm going to make you a father of many descendants you're going to be a great nation and it's it's not just saying a large family but you're going to be such a you're going to be so great that you will have multitudes of people multitudes of families that are going to be identified as a nation many many descendants and then he makes this statement so i want you to recognize this a lot of children a lot of offspring a lot of descendants enough to be a nation and then he says all families of the earth will be blessed so this speaks to just the breadth and and how broad and pervasive this promise was all families of the earth will be blessed he's when this is spoken to abraham he this ought to have resonated with him to think wow i'm just one man living here living in this part of the country having left the counties i've come to haran and or as god speaks to him in ur he thinks of himself how how is everyone in the world going to be blessed by me how could in this time in this day in this age uh uh all families of the earth uh be blessed in in me through me and so this speaks to just how expansive and how huge god's promise is to abram so abram he's hearing this and he would have had this liberty to begin to think of what the implications were okay you're gonna you're gonna give me many descendants i'm gonna have many children then it would have been fair for him to assume that he was gonna have at least a son right would have been fair for him to assume that that the the things that his seed would do and even through him that it would touch on all of humanity all families in the earth would be blessed abram would not have been out of line to begin to think of wow what does this mean in practice what does this mean in outcome and so it says so abram departed verse 4 as the lord had spoken unto him and lot went with him so god is speaking to him he's departing he's even going out of haran now and it says that he departed as god had spoke to him you find it mentioned again time and again that abraham's doing according to what god told him to do and he's answering by obedience to the things that god asked him to do and then it gives us this context and abram was 75 years old when he departed out of haran so when he's leaving haran he is 75 years old and abram took sarah his wife and and lot his brother's son and again you could recognize that he was told to get away from his father's house told to get away from his kindred but yet they're still kind of hanging around and all their substance that they had gathered these would be their possessions and the souls that they had gotten in haram this would speak to livestock and cattle and animals but also any servants that they might have had in hurren and they went for to go into the land of canaan so now it seems it's kind of crystallizing we read it now because uh we've read the choose your own adventure and we've gotten to the end and we've read all the scenarios and we know what canaan is it's the promised land we recognize the borders and so when we read this you mean like oh this is it this is the land but to abram it would have it would have just been the next thing god had showed him and he's entered into canaan and it's not at this point it's not necessarily apparent that abram shows up and cain is like i own this this is mine and starts telling all the canaanites to get out but yet he arrives at this place that is going to be very very significant and it says and into the land of canaan they came so they go forth into to go into it so there's a pro it's even speaks to process it speaks to progress it's they're in a journey and they go they're leaving to go into it and it says and into the land they went and into the land they came and now it speaks further this journey and abram passed through the land under the place of shechem under the plain of mora and the canaanite was then in the land so there was a people that dwelled there very evil people wicked cruel fierce people so he passes through the land to the place of shechem under the plain of mora and there's people there's other inhabitants there and the lord appeared unto abram a very significant event and said unto thy seed will i give this land they recognize this there's people living there he's just showed up he doesn't have any family there history there he comes from he comes from beyond he's one that's crossed over and he's given this promise unto thy seed will i give this land and then abraham's response and there builded he an altar unto the lord who appeared unto him it's critical to recognize how the one he's worshipping is the one who makes himself known to him he's not worshiping an unknown god he's not worshiping a god that can be seen by natural eye in a false image or in the sky but it's a god who's made himself known to him the god who appears it's important to kind of catch this uh this reference or this characterization he built an altar to worship the god who appears unto him who's made himself known unto him so this is the statement that god makes to him he's already told him in genesis the first few verses there of the chapter get out of your country from that kindred from the father's house unto a land i'll show you and i'll make you a great nation and i will bless thee and in thee shall all the families of the earth be blessed and now he identifies the land he said i'm going to show you later but now he says unto thy seed will i give this land in this statement unto thy seed it means unto thy offspring so as we've already been told abram is married and his wife is unable to have children abram and sarah do not have children but yet god's promise to him is i'm going to make you a great nation you're going to be the father of many descendants and he says unto your offspring unto your descendants i'm going to give this land so he's confirming to him that he will bring forth many descendants even though he doesn't have any children presently he said you're going to have children so abram had to believe that he was going to have children and then he says this land when he says i'll give this land the promise comes into view this was the land i told you that i was going to show you remember when i called you in chaldea and i called you out and you were to travel to a land that i was going to show you now the promise unfolds further this is the land that i was going to give you this is the place of promise this is where you're going to dwell and he says this is the land that i give to you i'm going to give you this the lord is going to give him this land as a possession it's going to be yours though there be canaanites here this land is going to be yours and your seed are going to possess it unto thy seed will i give this land now remember that promise and how that could have worked upon abraham's understanding and what it would have meant to him i'm going to have children and we're going to possess this land verse 8 and he removed from fence unto a mountain on the east of bethel he's still journeying he comes to a place of shashim and the plain of mora but he still journeys still traveling in this land of canaan he moved from fence into a mountain on the east of bethel and pitched his tent having bethel on the west and high on the east and there he builded an altar unto the lord and called upon the name of the lord in his journey he's continuing to worship in his journey he's not is he obeying but he's worshipping and his worship is uh uh external even to build an altar others could observe him worshiping and so he's not just this secret follower of god and he's kind of this well this secret person is speaking to me but he's not afraid to be identified with this unseen god and he says and he called upon the name of the lord it's not that he just verbalized lord or adonai but he invokes the name of jehovah so it shows that there's there's a deeper understanding that's coming to abram as he walks that he he worships the god who appears unto him now he worships again but now as he worships to him he begins to call upon the neighbor he's going to invoke jehovah and as invoking jehovah it's as if there's an understanding even we look at it now and it's like my it's almost as if he is now beginning to invoke the the the revelation of the messiah that in all and these shall all the families of the earth be blessed and he's having this understanding begins to invoke jehovah and yahweh and he's declaring this this unction of they're going to there's a jehovah and there's a god who who has these characteristics and these attributes so this is a this is a circumstance where it indicates a deeper understanding that abram has as he walks with god verse nine and abram journeyed going on still towards the south you see kind of a theme with him he leaves her and he goes to haran he's there for five years but now he's going to go he's leaving to go into canaan and then he goes into canaan and then he continues to travel in kane into bethel now going further south and there was a famine this is verse 10 to me is kind of where it starts to get more detailed and specific and there was a famine in the land and abram went down into egypt to soldier in there because for the famine was grievous in the land so recognize this and i realize i'm kind of maybe telling a story and as we go through this and reading it chronologically because i'm wanting to now begin to kind of set the scene for what it stands out to me as i read these things famine is what causes him to leave the land of promise it's famine that does it it it the bible is making it very clear that he's following the command of god to go into canaan even as he journeys south he's worshipping the lord and he's building an altar but now as his fam famine comes and it's letting us know that now abram is perhaps being motivated by different factors than the voice that spoke to him when he was in earth and he's looking at different circumstances so famine causes him to lead leave the land that was promised him as a possession to him and who his offspring say this is your land they give it to you and your seed after you but now other things begin to happen and he's looking at this famine and it causes him to leave now this is where i want us to be able to relate to abraham a little bit and if you felt like well you know help me relate to abraham by the fact that he was so strong in faith and never doubted well i kind of want to make you make him more relatable so we can kind of see where his weaknesses are and if that's not encouraging i apologize maybe i should have just said you're all super men and super women and you have the faith of abraham but i want to make him relatable by just looking at his progress and he came into certain crises and situations and he didn't always handle him perfectly and so god think about this god had already made a promise to him we could even say it this way that he'd promised him blessings i will bless you i'm going to give you this land and i'm going to give you children and they're going to have this land as well so abram was sitting there going god's going to bless me jehovah's going to bless him i've called upon the name lord wherever he went in his journey he's built altars and worshiped uh and i'm kind of just maybe going off of just maybe assumption right now but i don't recall him building an altar in egypt and worshipping and so now he's he's deviating from his journey he's deviating a little bit from his path but yet god said i'll bless you i'm going to give you children i'm going to give you a land and this land is so much yours it's to your seed after you and because of this promise to him he didn't need to fret about this terrible famine that was in the land ponder that for a moment the bible tells us there was a famine that came up in the land and then abraham went down into egypt to live there for a while soul journey is going down there temporarily for because the famine was grievous so why did abram leave the land of promise and leave canaan and go down into egypt because there was a famine in the promised land but yet knowing what god had spoken to him he had no reason to fear the famine no matter how bad it was in the land he had no reason to fear the threat of death why would you leave when there's a famine you're afraid you won't be able to be sustained you're afraid you won't be able to provide and so he had no reason to leave because god's promise assumed preservation think about it god's promise he says i'm going to bless you and i'm going to give you children if abram was sitting there without any children he could say you know what this famine can't take me because i don't have kids he could have made he could have come to certain conclusions based upon the promise that god gave him so this is what i want you to begin to think about this moved into egypt indicates some uncertainty on his part or at the very least a lack of understanding concerning the promise that he's he's been he's been placed in the land that's his with the promise of blessing that that assumed preservation and he starts looking at all these other things going on around him and he panics a little bit and he goes down into egypt and i'm suggesting that there was some uncertainty or he didn't fully understand what the promise meant and so when abram leaves the promised land and goes into egypt it creates a danger zone for him but now he's left the land god says leave and go into a land that i'll show you and what he says to abram never it's never spoken in what we read to say and kind of hang out for a little bit and things get tough abandoning it it doesn't tell us that god gave him a backup plan it doesn't tell him to travel and continue south and then as you continue south there's going to be a famine but you're going to continue to go down into egypt and hang out there for a while and since we don't see this explicitly in god's commandment to him it's it's we could assume that he may be deviating from god's explicit commandment and leaving the place of promise the place of protection the place of pleasure the place of provision and as he leaves this he puts himself in a danger zone and this is the lesson for us that when we leave where he promises to bless us where we leave the place that he's called us we enter into a danger zone where his blessings can be withheld and blessings being withheld opens us up to difficulties and triumphs and i would say that as we examine this in the life of abraham that the lesson would be trust god trust trust his promise that he's made to you if he says i've given you this land i've placed you here this is where i want to bless you i've opened these doors i've set you in this situation then no matter what gets taken away or how bad it gets or how much of a famine or things aren't quite working a while out the way that you thought they were go back to the promise go back to what he showed you trust his promises and yield to his process abram had every reason to look around and say there's a famine here this is getting tough god you promised to bless me god you promised that there would be seed after me therefore there has to be substance to sustain these bodies and to keep me and my wife alive but in leaving it created a danger zone and the message recognizing today and its message brother bam says god never blesses israel outside of the land abraham went outside the land was condemned so these are his words as he expresses this and he's talking about how israel is back in its homeland he's showing how what great things are transpiring in the hour that we're living in how the israel's back in his homeland and there's where god can make himself known to her there's where god can bless her but then he introduces us to this thought abraham went outside the land was condemned everyone that leaves the land is condemned now i want you to think about that everyone who leaves the land anybody who leaves the place that god has put them and promised them blessings condemns themselves everyone that means you if god has placed you somewhere and has promised you a blessing to leave that place opens you up to difficulties and trials and hardships and persecutions um beyond what you are would if you were just suffering for well-doing it says everyone that leaves the land is condemned god can only bless israel when she stays in her homeland and she's there now as a nation and then he makes this statement and i'm leaving this i left this in even though it kind of seemed like it uh it's speaking more to the situation for israel in present day but i want you to relate to abraham he says the church is called she's just only waiting for the rapture of the bride taken out israel before god can deal with her further is waiting for you to be to be raptured the bride has been called she is waiting for the climax of the rapture the change of body to meet the lord in the air that's where things are and he says the seals are open it's revealed to us these very things are opened up to us it's the seals are open it's revealed to us i want you to recognize this as your homeland i want you to recognize the seals being opened to you opened up to you a whole new land of promise it's the promised land of the son of man it is a revelation to us it is his promise and it's the bride's possession and i want there to be a caution that's where god is placing his bride and he can't bless you if you leave that revelation if you try to add to it you try to take it away you begin to start trying to doubt it or or modified or have some kind of revisionist history then you're removing yourself from the place that god has blessed you because as the church progressed god opened up these things as the bride's possession and it's there that god is going to bless you and it's there that the blessing of rapture is promised but abraham went outside the land as we're looking at him in this journey we'll look at verse 11 now as we continue genesis 12 11. he went outside the land and he's condemned so i there's a lot of other statements i could use to verify how that abraham isn't necessarily marching perfectly in the will of god when he goes down into egypt and it came to pass when he come near to enter into egypt that he said unto sarah his wife behold now i i know that thou art a fair woman to look upon therefore and she was 10 years younger than him and and was on the account of good living in good air and they say the mountainous air and different things they there's a lot of speculation as to why she would have been so beautiful but abram recognized realizes that you're fair to look on and he says therefore it shall come to pass when the egyptians shall see thee that they shall say this is his wife and they will kill me but they'll save thee alive in other words they had enough decency about them to kill her husband in order to take her as a wife so i know that's some respect or what it is but yet he realized that they're going to want you and they won't take you to be a wife unless i'm out of the way so they're going to kill you and he says say i pray thee thou art my sister that it may be well with me for thy sake and my soul shall live because of thee i i just want to get right to the point he's afraid of death abram's afraid of dying and being afraid of death he instigates the lie and he wants his wife to lie and it be in her lie and him joining being complicit with her in the life that by a lie his soul is going to be saved through sarah now think about it we know the promise the promise to abraham is going to be through sarah she'll be through her womb that the promise to him is rescued and the promise to him unfolds and comes to further blessing but look at how he's looking at it now he's saying hey we need to lie that my soul may be saved because of thee he's motivated i want you to catch this very simple this is how compact my thought is today he's motivated by the fear of death and he lies to spare his life and he encourages his wife to lie to spare his life and what he does is he resorts to his own wisdom he resorts to his own approach and he he's put in this position to lie because he left the land had he stayed in in canaan he wouldn't have not been in a situation where all of a sudden he's looking at all these egyptians look at his wife says hey you're a rare beauty here they're gonna want you why don't we lie and say that you're my sister so that they don't kill me to take you in other words let them take you but don't let them kill me because you're just my sister and that way i'll live so listen i hate to call abraham out on this but he doesn't care if they take her he just didn't want to die right it's kind of like when you're hiking in the wilderness with your wife and you're told that there's bears the only thing you worry about is whether or not you're faster than your wife and and so there's this abraham's not really concerned so much about her well-being he's not thinking through this completely but he's resorting to this uh uh you know lying and his own wisdom and doing his own thing let's let we're down here in egypt and let my soul be preserved that my soul may live let's lie and misrepresent the truth so that we can survive all right so i just want you to catch that genesis chapter 12 we get we're this is the most uh as a matter of fact i mean this is the first time we're really hearing abraham talk right what's he doing lying i want to introduce you to abram hi um this is my sister full sister 100 my sister not my wife this is this is your introduction to the character of abram as he comes down through here and he offers this excuse of this lie to save his life now i want to quickly cover very quickly cover several chapters because there's a lot that happens in abraham's life over a nearly 25-year period after this after this instance in genesis chapter 12 how that uh even i i took it out to read could have read all the way to verse 20 how that pharaoh's house is plagued and so the remainder of the chapter uh kind of deals with how god deals with pharaoh's house because he took abraham's wife and how the abraham gets his wife back and then he's going to he's going to return back out of egypt in chapter 13. but there's so there's a lot that transpires in the next several chapters god appears in genesis 13 to him and he confirms the con the promise genesis chapter 13 the very next chapter abraham and lot separate and god renews his covenant with him and he gives more detail when he renews his covenant with them after a lot separates he gives them more details the promise that he'd given to him before genesis chapter 14 it's the battle of the kings and lot is captured and then and he rescues uh he a rescues lot and then he meets melchizedek melchizedek blesses abraham that happens in chapter 14. in genesis chapter 15 the lord appears to him in a vision and he says this after these things the word of the lord came unto abram in a vision after melchizedek appears to him and he says fear not so now he's renewed the covenant there's a lot of events that are taking place milk and he goes out and he rescues his uh his nephew lot with 318 trained servants and now god wants to speak to me appears to him in a vision and he speaks to him and he says fear not so he's addressing something in abraham's heart he believes god but now he's wanting to address a need that's deep within his understanding deep within his spirit fear not abram i am thy shield and thy exceeding great reward he's telling him that i am your defender i am your cover i am your protector don't fear abram and look we can look back and see how he feared for his life already and and then how you know kind of an odd change of events and out of character a man who's afraid of the egyptians now is really ready to take 318 servants and run after a bunch of kings to rescue a servant lord and he's saying listen you have reason to be bold you have reason to be courageous i am your shield i am your exceeding great reward fear not don't be afraid remember in genesis 12 he was afraid for his life but now god is addressing the fear in his life but then abraham answers in genesis chapter 15 what can you give me when i have no children very interesting response i'm your shield by exceeding great reward don't fear he goes but what can what what is it you can bless me with that's going to mean anything if i don't have children and he makes the suggestion behold i have a servant in my house who has a son maybe his son of born in my house since he's my servant maybe the promise is to him and god says in verse 4 and behold the word of the lord came unto him saying this shall not be thy heir the son of your servant but he that shall come forth out of thy own bowel shall be thine air now god's being very precise to abraham more it unfolded in chapter 13. now he's being more precisely understands this is not going to be a servant this is not going to be a relative it's going to be someone that comes from your own body and then he wants him to understand once again how how big this promise is and he brought him forth abroad so there's a very supernatural take something supernatural taking place it says look now toward heaven tell the stars if thou shall be able to number them and he said unto him so shall thy seed be very remarkable now don't fear abram i am thy shield and thy exceeding great reward well what is it you can give me when i don't even have a child maybe ellie's your son maybe he's the one that the blessing is going to come through he says no it can be a child from your own body listen to that a child from your own body is going to be your heir and he says come here i want to show you something look at the stars and we can have some pretty incredible skies here in arizona especially if you get out of the city lights and i'm like wow count those stars so here's abram with no light pollution at all looking up the stars he says count him and he's kind of like he realizes this is rhetorical i mean abraham would want to obey god he's like you're joking right i don't literally have to count the stars but he says you can't even count them so this is how your seeds going to be seed from your own body your own child your own progeny your own offspring and it says in verse six now as as hard as it would be for him to believe with the wife who is barren and his own body at that point him not knowing if he could bring four children to look at the stars and like yep that's how my seed's going to be you know what the next verse says he believed god and he believed in the lord and then he i capitalized it in my notes but in the in the scriptures it's not necessary capitalized but he god counted it to him for righteousness that abraham was standing there that night outside the tent looking at the stars with god what a beautiful scene believed him and thought yeah my seed gonna be numbered like this he just believed him he's like i believe you god and god saw that faith and attributed righteousness to him because they're standing out with there without a child he believed in genesis chapter 17 god appears to him again reaffirms the promise to him further unfolds the promise and gets into more detail we kind of skip over verse 16 where hagar is given to abram i'm just kind of looking at these many different events that take place genesis chapter 16 is hagar and the birth of ishmael chapter 17 god appears he's reaffirming the promise to him then more details are given in the promise he changes his name from abram to abraham and then he specifies in chapter 17 that sarah he changes her name to sarai to sarah and then he promises the son specifically through sarah because now he's saying it's not only your body but it's not going to be through hagar it's not just your from your bowels alone but your bowels with sarah's womb so he's not being more precise it's got to be from her womb and so he's confirming the promise and he gives a name to the child sarah your wife is going to bear a son and his name is going to be isaac more specific promises are given genesis 18 god veils himself and flesh again to visit abraham confirms the promise again and what vows to return these are the things that happen over a nearly 25-year period from the time that abraham lied down in egypt to where he is in genesis chapter 18 genesis chapter 19 gets into more the details of the angels visiting lot and the the destruction of sodom and gomorrah and the birth of lot's children then verse 20. it kind of seems to be taking place at about the same time that uh uh sodom and gomorrah are burned but now let's look at chapter 20 genesis chapter 20 verses 1 to 11. and i'm just going to i'm going to read through this as you would just read in your bible and i want you to recognize what's transpiring again and abraham journeyed from fence toward the south country and dwell between cadis and shear and sojourned in gerrard this is a philistine land a philistine holdout it's closer to egypt and abraham said of his sarah his wife she is my sister here he goes again she is my sister and abimelech king of gerard sent and took sarah but god came to abimelech in a dream by night and said and behold thou art but a dead man for the woman which thou has taken for she is a man's wife but abimelech had not come near her this is abraham's deceived abimelech because he there's some sort of inquiry who's this beautiful woman he's like uh my sister once again take her not me right here she is it says she this is my sister lord he goes lord will thou slay also a righteous nation said he not unto me she is my sister she even herself said he is my brother they had rehearsed this years before right and in the integrity of my heart and my innocence of my hands have i done this and god said unto him in a dream yay i know that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart for i also withheld thee from sinning against me therefore suffered i thee not to touch her now therefore restore the man his wife i i love this he's just found out he's been deceived by this man and he says for he is a prophet and he shall pray for thee and thou shalt live you know the guy that lied you and put your life in danger and i told you you're going to be a dead man because you took a man's wife because he told you it was his sister yeah that guy i want him to pray for you and if thou restore her not know that thou shalt surely die thou and all that are thine so to have her his wife meant death for him but he says he's a prophet this is very important for us to recognize that god is recognizing abram as a prophet he begins to establish even how god further unfolds how god deals with his prophets he already disclosed things before him to him in genesis 18 how can i withhold this from my servant so he does operate in this office of a prophet and he says have him pray for you that you live even though he made a mistake it didn't validate the fact that he was a prophet didn't validate the fact that it would be his prayer that would rescue him and cause him to live because make him pray and thou shalt live therefore abimelech rose early in the morning and called all his servants and told all these things in their ears and the men were so afraid then abimelech called abraham and said unto him what has thou done unto us and what have i offended thee that thou has brought on me in my kingdom a great sin thou hast done deeds upon me that ought not to have been done and abimelech said to abraham what sayest thou that thou hast done this thing no i want you to catch again abraham's logic abraham said because i thought surely the fear of god is not in this place and they will slay me for my wife's sake did you catch it still afraid of death 25 years later he takes his wife who god has said will be her womb that brings forth the son from your bowels and here he finds himself in garrar and he says this is abraham justifying why he lied i thought that you guys didn't fear god and i was certain that you would kill me to take my wife still afraid of death still having to lie to preserve his own flesh and save his soul and then he says and yet indeed she is my sister a little bit of a half truth she's the daughter of my father but not the daughter of my mother and she became my wife sounds like a riddle and this is this is his justification and it continues there's there's more to this story how abimelech then blesses abraham and restores to him sarah's wife but i want you just to recognize this that abraham is still afraid of death and him being afraid of death i i hope that you can catch this part his actions and his words aren't fully lining up with the promise can we accept that and i'll say this one if it's just so simple that you don't feel like it deserves an amen for my sake amen it if you believe it here he is worried about death in gerar just like he was 25 years earlier nearly 25 years earlier in egypt he's like you're a beautiful woman they're going to kill me to get you and he's verbalizing this and justifying his actions and i want us to recognize that what he's saying and what he's doing doesn't mix and doesn't jail and doesn't harmonize with the word god spoke to him and listen how brother branham characterizes i'm just just using one place and christ revealed in his own word abraham because he's talking about how perfect the bible is and how it's a book of god not man because he said if man wrote it he would never record his mistakes hey and it's true you might notice that whenever whenever i read a quote and i'm reading it here and you're reading it there and there can be a the wrong verb or the wrong word or wrong conjugation there might be some stuttering in there and i'll skip right over it and i'll say it just the way that might make more sense if he he says uh uh if he says r instead of is i might read it the way that i would grammatically say it why because that's just me and my human nature wanting to correct something that maybe is not grammatically correct but we know that god is not afraid to record the mistakes of man man wants to come back and revise and change things and mix things up and try to polish things over he says if man was the one responsible for writing the book you wouldn't know one mistake of the prophets because that's the carnal side of man i don't make any mistakes i never make any mistakes there's never anything wrong everything's perfect everything's less than the lord and god's like you know what i'm going to preserve it so precisely and so specifically so that you know the difference between man and god god don't make mistakes he says do you think he says abraham for instance he's called the father of the faithful do you think abraham would have wrote the book on himself of his own cowardness cowardliness how do you think he would have wrote that he lied to the king that morning and said that it was his sister when it was his wife it's a lie nonetheless even though it was a half truth she is my sister but not not of my mother but of my father but she is my wife he's trying to you know there's a half truth but he's spoken with the intent to deceive and he says would it write of his cowardly deeds that he's done that he done surely he'd never done that so notice in this one place this characterization of cowardliness lying to the king and cowardly deeds and these his cowardly deeds in his lines signified that although he believed there was still a greater depth of understanding that he could have according about the promise can you can you ponder that for a moment just let this this is the simple thought that i'm wanting to get across to you the in the time that god called abram out of er his understanding had deepened the details to the promise had further unfold god had appeared to him a number of times god had confirmed his promise got more precise through your own bowels not your servants through your own wife not somebody else this is your son and this is going to be his name and your seed is going to be like the stars of the heaven and this is going to be the land they're going to live in and abraham had all these promises and abraham believed god but yet still we can see that in his life there still was a greater depth of understanding what he believed that he could achieve his revelation of the promise pointed to the power of god to preserve life his revelation of the promise it was trending to this it was pointing to this at every single instance and every single confirmation and everything god was given them fear not i am thy protector i am that coveter cover i'm your defender you don't need to resort to other things you should be afraid of a famine i'll bless you you shouldn't be afraid of man i'll keep you and there was this promise that god had given him and everything he was speaking to him pointed to this promise that god was able to preserve life or at least raise it up as it said in genesis 15 16 and he believed in the lord and he counted it to him for righteousness but even though he believed god all these many years there was still a greater potential penetration of that revelation he believed it it was there was in his soul but there was still some deeper penetration there was a greater practical outworking or impact and sufficient impressing of that revelation that he could have i want to say i don't want to say anything that would belittle his revelation wouldn't want to say anything that would belittle his faith but yet when we see him in this circumstance there was still more of that faith that could unfold or further manifestation that would cement that faith and anchor that faith and put him in a position to where he could say death has no more hold upon me and this is where i want us to relate our faith justifies us our faith alone makes us righteous yet we can still be weak in our mind we can still be weak in our our spirits and weaken our understanding and and weaken our doubtings and weaken our and our flesh and when we're weak in our flesh we see the frailties of our physical body when we experience the uh just the quagmire of emotions and this vacillating between confidence and fear and uh courage and doubt and all these different things this weak mind this weakness in our mind can cause us to doubt and then through this weakness of our body or our flesh we can fail to conduct ourselves according to the word that's been revealed to us amen we're believers right we're christians we're sealed with the holy ghost we believe his word we believe his promises and we're willing to admit that not all the time do my words and my actions line up with the very things that i know i believe in my heart i i'm not always exhibiting the confidence and we have let me just i'll just tell them myself all things work together for the good we know this we believe this and i'm over here and all the time what's happening is everybody doing this how can god let this happen and why because it hasn't really fully dawned on me in this there's good put your shoulders back put your chin up stop complaining and whining and crying about all the things that are bad that happened how you're mistreated how this takes place and how that takes place you are promised blessing and those that curse you he curses so instead of all these people cursing me wait a minute he's gonna bless me he's made he's promised me if you have to at least think about the fact that someone who curses you is setting himself up for a cursing to get out of your e or mindset listen we don't always conduct i don't always conduct myself in such a way that testifies aaron believes that all things are working together together for the good aaron believes that this misdeed and that bad thing and this person and that person who did this and did that aaron believes that it's all part of god's plan to bring out the best in him and put him in the position that god wants him to be in he doesn't always live that way can you say a man about me i want a man about you necessarily you leave it to yourselves but i'm confessing this that my conduct does not always line up with my revelation but with abraham ultimately his faith was justified by his works though in this moment in genesis chapter 20 we're reading about him lying and what's the reason why did he lie because he was afraid he was going to die it ultimately his works justify his faith and we could say his faith was expressed by his works no it's ultimately what he said and what he did lined up with what god promised it's like it's like inside he he had this he had this promise that that was at a hundred and his revelation of that was just creeping up incrementally and then his conduct in his words as a revelation comes up it starts to and one day it hits to where it all lines up his actions line up with his revelation which lines up with the fullness of the promise and everything's lining up and therein is his faith made perfect and i want to look at it very quickly in genesis chapter 22. i'm just headed very closely to a close here verses 8 to 10 and abraham said my son because isaac's going up this mount moriah to offer sacrifice and isaac knew enough to say dad what are we going to kill up there and instead of lying instead of resorting to his own wisdom he says my son god will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering so they went both of them together you could even back up and say that when the language he used to his servants when he left him on the base of the mountain and left him to the side he said the language that implies i am the lad will return he's using a language very differently than what he is in genesis 12. using the language very differently than the language that we see him use in genesis 20. my son god will provide himself a lamb for burnt offering so they went both of them together and they came to the place which god had told them of and abraham built an altar there he's not withholding through doubt through fear through hesitancy he he he's not walking and gets up said silly me this isn't mount moriah it's the one over there let's go you know he's not trying to delay there's no delay he's right to the place that god told him to go and he builds an altar lays the wood in order and then he's not hesitating this is what needs to be done this is what needs to be done he's following through and he binds isaac his son lays him on the altar upon the wood again there's no hesitation and abraham stretched forth his hand and took the knife to slay a son what what what do i want you to see in this very image this abraham takes the hand back to slay a son he is no longer afraid of death abraham is declaring that his belief in the promise or we could say his actions are declared that his faith in the promise has finally imposed itself on his actions that god had made a promise he had a revelation but his actions always kind of seem to meddle in this area and things kind of leveled and leveled and leveled up a little bit but now finally abraham act in a way that supremely declared a congruency and a harmony with what god spoke to him in the beginning in other words i'm willing to slay you because god paid me a promise that through you isaac will all families in the earth be blessed and if he wants me to kill you the same god that raised up my body and raised up your mother's womb is the same god that'll keep your life or raise it up again and he was no longer afraid of death hallelujah look at the faith of abraham through these crises it comes to a place where his his faith imposed itself on his perception of reality wow hebrews 11 19 are counting that god was able to raise isaac up even from the dead this is his understanding can we recognize just how different his revelation is in genesis chapter 22 from his understanding in genesis 12. and if he's really afraid he was going to be killed he'd go down in egypt and say hey they're going to kill me try to take you to his wife i don't know how this is going to work out but i'm going to get raised again so find me i'll be outside the city i'll be in a grave wherever they're gonna put my body follow close behind because they're gonna want you because you're beautiful but god made me a promise honey and he's either gonna keep my life he's gonna raise it up you know what paul said that we were we were pressed beyond measure we were gonna die but we believed in the god who would raise the dead that's the faith that paul had that's the faith that abraham ultimately comes to because in genesis chapter 20 he's still lying again why he's afraid of his own flesh and he wanted his life to wife to lie in order to preserve his soul but now the very one whom is the embodiment of the promise he's not rationalizing trying to come up with a lie trying to come with half worship not trying to come up with religion religion trying to justify well i know that god said this but then and i know the bible says this but that i know brother branham said this but that but he's willing to just do exactly what god said because he was no longer afraid he acts in harmony with the truth of god's promises to him he acts in harmony with the understanding of god's promise to him is he raises that back he's a god that can preserve life or raise it up again he's a god that gave me an eternal promise this is an eternal possession he's an eternal god to you and me isaac everything that god said he believed so his actions lined up with the deeper understanding of the promise what he does on that mountain it's a manifestation of the maturing of abraham's faith it's a manifestation of a more perfect understanding where it really anchored and now he's realizing this promise i've always believed in wait a minute i believe that and if i believe that then this has to be true and this has to be true and this has to be true the faith that he comes to on top of mount moriah it's a faith that was produced by god appearing to him time and time again it's a faith that rose up within him as god time and time again confirmed his promise to him it was a faith that rose up in abraham because god fulfilled the promise that he gave him not a blind trust it wasn't just abraham got it right and god he called god's bluff but this was a process wherein abraham walked with god and things transpired and god appeared and made himself known and he confirmed the promise and fulfilled his word and it put him in a place on that mountain that day to where his actions now lined up with the revelation that lined up with the promise and therein did his faith reach its full and supreme expression because now his conduct in crisis can match the truth that was given to him it was the results of a regular routine of receiving revelation right the regular routine of receiving revelation and then the outcome things are things happen god gave me this promise god gave me the promise he was in this routine brother baby says in one place that god spoke to abraham nearly every day that's quite a statement but it means day on a daily basis there were some means by which god made himself available to abraham to make his presence felt to know that he was near you ever been in a situation where before where you're seeking an answer from god you need a very specific answer very specific answer and you want him to tell you is it true or false or is it true or false and he never gives you an answer but he just makes himself known just let you know i'm mindful of you he does things supernaturally he speaks to your issue without answering it and he's what is he doing he's declaring his presence to you he's daily wanting to speak to you and commune with you even if it doesn't seem to be answering this big huge question that you have he's wanting to confirm his presence with you why because he knows it's a process if god wanted to give you third pool squirrel speaking into existence rapturing body changing faith in manifestation on day one he could have done it the power apart from character satanic and so god says i want a process of character development i want a process of harmony communion getting to know one another god's ways are beyond our ways and he knows it's a process and when abraham offered up isaac upon the altar it was the outcome of a full trust in god and an awakened trust a fully alert revealed revelated trust it was an understanding for abraham was not willing to kill isaac because god said so but he had a revelation that god would preserve him and i want to point this out in genesis chapter 21 there was one thing that happened i think this is where we can make it relatable for us if we're just if we were a bunch of people today that answered you know a flyer that was placed under our windshield wiper at fry's we're like oh i want to go do this has anyone ever thought that oh i want to do this thanks for you know thanks for putting this on my windshield wiper i feel compelled to go get this you know eyebrow pick or you know whatever they start they're advertising on your windshield but we're not all here today because we answered some flyer or because the nigerian prince emailed all of us and promised us great wealth here today if we showed up at the hilton garden inn or free dinner you have to just listen to my seminar right take you all to lunch you just have to listen to what i have to offer you if you all sign up and get everyone give me 500 and you can go out and get find somebody else to give you 500 you can be rich like me that's not why we're here that's not how we made it here how is it that we enter into this journey of faith there's something that god does it's so beautiful how abraham's journey of faith is remarkable how this invisible god is making him these promises but there's something more firm in the promise that he makes to us there's something more complete and how he wants to deal with us that we have the benefit of abraham's example and we have the benefit of the seed promised to him because in genesis chapter 21 verses 1 to 3 and the lord visited sarah as he had said now this is beautiful he doesn't ever say this before but now he visits her and the lord did unto sarah as he had spoken for sarah conceived oh it's such beautiful language such beautiful poetry god visits her as the lord said unto her and he did unto her what he said he would do for sarah conceived and bear abraham a son in his old age when at the set time of which god had spoken to him everything's lined up i will return according to the time of life in a specific season i will visit sarah and i will do to her what i promised to her and i will give you a son through her and his name will be isaac everything's just lining up perfectly to what he promised and it said and abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him whom sarah bore to him isaac and it may it may seem it may not you may not be able to make the connection it may just seem very obvious like well you're just reading the story brother aaron but i want you to recognize that it was this manifestation of the promise that made the difference for abraham if this part was missing and there was another visit down into egypt perhaps i know i'm speculating but perhaps abraham would still would be compelled to try to save his own skin but it was the re it was the bringing forth the manifestation of the promise this manifest manifestation of the promise in genesis 21 that makes this huge difference in abraham's walk his walking with god matured his faith little by little but then it matures it to a faith to where he was no longer afraid of death it matured his faith to a point to where he believed that even if this body is dead it still has to bring forth life even if my wife's womb is dead it still has to bring forth life and that's what the process of walking with god and the regular routine of following the plan of god and the routine of the promises that god gave him in these revelations these appearing it brought abraham to a place to where he believed that his body would bring forth a son named isaac through the womb of sarah and so he no longer regarded the deadness of his body he no longer regardless that regarding the deadness of sarah's womb and he believed in life and through his crises and through his ups and downs and his detours and everything he went through his faith was obviously growing stronger through every difficulty every strife every turn of events everything he went through even these detours into egypt and then later into gerard he his faith was growing stronger so he finally came to a place where he could believe for a son and then his faith rises to a place to now whereas he was afraid of his own death earlier and try to save his life and his wife's life now he wasn't afraid of death anymore the bible says in romans chapter 4 verses 19 to 21 and being not weak in faith the weak in the flesh being not weak in faith he considered not his own body now dead when he was about 100 years old so this is where he comes to this understanding my body is dead as it is at hundred about a hundred years old my my faith has come to this place to believe for this son neither yet the deadness of sarah's womb and you know what i believe that she can have a child he he obviously had a child with hagar right hey you know it's not i'm not the problem but here still as many years pass later on he still comes to this place where he believes and notice this tremendous memorialization of his faith he staggered not at the promise of god through unbelief he staggered not at the promise of god through unbelief if we're to if we were to characterize abraham as staggering he didn't stagger through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to god and being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able to perform being not weak in faith though he might have been weak in his flesh and even in his emotions his faith what the bible said his faith ultimately prevailed under the strain of the final crisis under the strain of the nearness now the imminence i'm going to visit you according to the time of life and this time of next year you're going to have a son under the strain of this crisis he did not succumb but in faith rose above it even as he came to offer up isaac upon the altar and he reckoned that god was able to raise him up even in that moment he he he his faith rose to the challenge but even to have a son he refused to consider his physical weaknesses his physical deficiencies his physical disabilities which really in reality made god's promises impossible okay god said that i am going to have a son through sarah and her womb is dead and my body is now old and physically it was impossible but he didn't he looked at the physical impossibilities and he did not allow it to diminish the power of god's promises the bible is even suggesting that he stared down these impossibilities as it were looked at the deadness of his body he looked at the deadness of sarah's womb and he looked at it and he began to weigh it a dead womb and a dead body the promise of god a dead woman a dead body the promise of god and what he did is he looked right at him and he turned away from him and chose to believe god's promise over everything else that said it was impossible he confidently decided that the word of god must stand in the face of your opposition he looked at him he didn't say oh i'm going to bury my head and say oh no no no no no no i'm not my woman's not dead this is that he looked and said you know what this may be so but god's word will stand this may be so but god's word would stand way the promise that god gave him against the flesh he confidently decides that god's word was enough and this is where i want i'll say this in closing i want us to relate to abraham a little bit more whatever our present state of whatever our present state is whatever our current weaknesses are whatever our current temptations are by faith you can rise above it doesn't mean you have to deny the weaknesses deny the temptations deny all the things that happen like oh well i really don't have a problem or this really isn't happening but you can look at them and you can wail and you can let them you can even let it sink in what it means and what its implications are and then you can say oh if this is true it means god's word will fail and then you look at god's promises you say you know what your promises never fail so in the face of opposition in the face of all these things against it i still believe and it can be said that abraham believed in the lord we do not look down at our weaknesses as abraham could have nor do we look back at our past failures as abraham could have because think about it 25 years later here he is on the door of of sarah conceiving and he could have looked back and been like such a failure i've been waiting 25 years for this son and even looked at his most recent example in egypt or in gerar i'm like why am i still lying here all these years later after god made the promise and i tried to save my own skin and all these things taken place in my life and all these times that god's confirmed it abraham didn't look down at his own body know that he looked back at his own past he just looked to the promise and he said if that's his promise this is what it means the bible says in james chapter 1 verse 12 musicians if you could come james chapter 1 verse 12 blessed is the man that endureth temptation for when he has tried this this is the language he comes to abraham in in a couple chapters but this language is very specifically applicable to abraham blessed is the man that endureth temptation remains steadfast under trial perseveres when tempted blessed is the man that endure temptation for when he has tried he shall receive the crown of life which the lord hath promised to them that love him think about this not not just a promise of eternal life but a crowning of it the climax of it a coronation of it that if if unbelief and sin can can have a process where it it it's received it conceives and ultimately brings forth dead and it's crowned and death then the life that we've received by faith through the baptism of the holy ghost which is the new birth he's saying blessed is the man abraham i will bless you he didn't say he wouldn't try him but he said he'd bless them and abraham's blessing he received as he endured trials and in the end his testimony was crowned because if he was went back in the tent there in genesis chapter 15 and he went back in the tent and he laid down and sarah said honey what was that he goes there you see those stars that's how many children we're going to have in our family in our nation try to count them and she's like how he's like no really going to be that way baby told lot lot you go ahead you've got children now mine are coming but you go ahead and pick since you have children now but mine are coming maybe testified his whole life this is what the truth is this is the truth this is the truth and maybe he felt really really discouraged as he left guerrero again like man i just when's it going to happen when's it going to happen and there was another visitation when god visited abraham and he crowned his faith with life it was the promised son and when the promised son was born when the promised son came into that it changed something in abraham because now the promise that god had pro the promise he made and how it unfolded that sarah will have a son named isaac now he held him [Music] and it was the personal revelation of the promised son that made all the difference in genesis chapter 22 because now he knows the son now he knows the promise and because he knows the promise and he knows the son he's not afraid of death not even the death of the son right because isn't that revelation we get of jesus christ that he was he was a sacrifice to be offered he was to die but it wasn't just a promise of death it was a promise that he'd be raised up again and therefore for us those of us who have a longing for god those of us who loved him love him we've been promised a crown of life how in do we have this promise to be crowned with life how is it that we have heirs in life it is through jesus christ and it's through the prayers personal revelation of the promised son if that revelation that gives wings to our faith and that's why in the end time there is a revelation of jesus christ that comes to his elect because that's what abraham needed to have belief that death was powerless in a time of trouble and that's what we needed to believe that death is powerless in a time of trouble and this is a lesson that we learned from abraham fear not and there was this outworking in this process in his life that brought him to a place to trust god and to believe all things were possible could we stand together today the bible says i can do all things through christ which strengtheneth me [Music] who will deliver me from the body of this death i thank god that he will through jesus christ our lord it's through him and isaac being the embodiment of that promise and a further unfolding manifestation of the promise that god had given abraham even though he only had a son and even though he he wasn't beginning to number the stars and see this great nation unfold around him it was enough to change it for him he wasn't still fretting and still worried he said well i i i god how could i offer isaac upon the altar he's not even married yet doesn't have any children can we wait until he least has a couple sons so at least we know that he has sons that can continue the lineage nope wasn't afraid anymore he wasn't looking to how he can naturally button things up and fix things and well if isaac dies now it's going to be too late and i need to lie to preserve my own soul and he tries to wiggle the way out of it it was enough and i want you to know today the personal revelation of jesus christ to you is enough we just need that to mature and to grow he is enough do you believe he's enough i know there's a there's a way that satan tries to take the word of god and and manipulate you with you we manipulate you with it and use it just enough to we always feel compromised we always feel weak and we always feel needy and it's kind of used like we're always chasing something that it's never going to come and so we always feel like we're in egypt trying to preserve our own souls we always feel like we're in gerar in the land of the philistines trying to preserve our own lives and there's always this kind of this carrot that's dangled out before us well you're not quite there yet you're not quite there yet you need you need this you need that and listen i believe that god wants you as an individual bride member to have confidence in his promise to you alone that he made the promise to you and you believe that he's able to keep it and walk with him in that promise believe i can do all things through christ who gives me strength i can do this through christ and that we have our own genesis 21 experience where christ is made alive to us you realize in type that's the season we're living in now where the full word is being born into manifestation again as jesus christ was the manifestation of the promise given to abraham because when he said these seed he spoke of christ not even isaac and so it was born into manifestation of days of jesus christ and now the full word is being born into manifestation again we're living in a season for the gentile bride as it did for israel in her day when christ came that time that's the season we're living in so we ought to have a mount moriah faith to believe that god made a promise and he's able to keep it and i'm no longer afraid of what man can do to me i'm not afraid of the grave i'm not afraid of death i'm not afraid of what man can do unto me but i've got confidence in god's promises because he said this and if he said that it means this i'm willing to look at whatever staring me in the face and say oh okay yeah that doesn't look good but this looks really good and i'm sorry you're terrible and you're awful and you're really really loud and you're really really scary but you know what i'm just gonna take this instead i'm just gonna listen i'm sorry i'm just gonna take this all right now you can stay there that's fine but i'm gonna i'm over here and i'm turning my eyes on jesus and whenever you remind me this i don't know if you recognize greater is he that is in me than you no matter how big and bad you are no matter if you literally speak scientifically speak to the impossibility of me being able to have a son god said i'd have one and there i stake my my soul let's bow our heads today i feel a a a large faith bank that's built up you have a need in your life right now you want to take god at his word you know the need in your life take them right now claim it claim a promise you are the seed of abraham and you have a right to possess the gates of your enemy and you have a right right now if it's a loved one if it's a if it's a relationship if it's a promise whatever it might be you've got a promise from god you've got a word on it you've got a scripture you have every right to stand there just as bold as abraham did on mount moriah and draw that arm of faith back and believe god you said and regardless of the deadness regardless of the circumstances regardless of the symptoms the facts and figures god is able do you believe he's able the bible says that abraham believed in the lord i asked you today i'm not asking you to believe in and politics and believe in this person and that person and this minister and that this movement do you believe in the lord then take him at his word today heavenly father we stand in your presence today in all of you we sense your nearness we know that you're here and i've asked the people to respond in faith to the word by claiming a promise and i believe that if it relates to a husband or a wife physical body the deadness of a womb if it relates to healing if it relates to emotional difficulties a chemical imbalance if it relates to eyesight or foot pain if it relates to internal organs if it has to do with estrangement and the family if it has to do with financial hardships or direction that one must go or selling a house or making a mortgage payment whatever it might be i pray that you as you visited abraham in chapter 12 and chapter 13 and chapter 15 and 17 and 18 and lord you visited him time and time and time again would you visit us once more and give us give us another appearing lord to strengthen our faith lord as we look at it in type how that abraham received a revelation of the son lord i pray that there would not be one person here whether it be in my own family i have a son 13 years old lord i have a daughter that's been baptized i know there's other young people here who've been baptized and i know there's family situations and new christians here lord may not one of us be outside that that personal experience of the new birth it makes all the difference lord may that be our portion to even receive it and accept it today lord it's part of lot's character to go after family that's lost it's not part of lot's character to plead for the souls that are lost lord may we have a faith that begins to achieve these levels and these benchmarks to believe all things are possible to believe for salvation of souls to even believe in the healing of our body and lord i pray today that his hands are lifted up identifying particular needs in the flesh may you now father confirm your promise to the seed of abraham and bring it to pass lord may we take this lesson from abraham and may his faith become even more relatable relatable in the sense that we're not bringing abraham's faith down but relatable in the sense that we identify with his journey and then can believe that our faith too as abrahams will reach supreme faith and in crisis in the moment that we need it one day we too will be able to have a mount zion experience just as he had a mount moriah experience bless your people i pray in the name of the lord jesus christ amen
