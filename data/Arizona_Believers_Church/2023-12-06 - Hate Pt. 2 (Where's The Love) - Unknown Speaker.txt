TRANSCRIPT
========================================
continuing on the holiday subject of hate and the Christmas subject of hate and tonight we're going to ask the specific question of where is the love and it's continuing on what we were ministering on on Sunday we spoke on where is the Peace we connected how that peace is associated U with hatred in terms of being an opposite and I'll say this at the outset tonight I want you to grab a hold of this from the very very beginning because I I have a lot that I want to cover and I think a lot of it may be things we already know nothing that's going to be really surprising like oh wow I didn't know that was there I think it's all going to be just bringing it to remembrance but what I would like you to be able to do is number one acknowledge that hatred is an emotion that we struggle with as human beings uh it and it's something that we wrestle with as Christians and what I'm wanting to do is consider the origin and nature of hate so as we look at the origin and nature of hate I want you to be able to think about what that means in your life if you have this kind of hate in your spirit or in your heart and and think about it how that it had a beginning and so it has a Genesis and it has a nature and so that if we have that and we wrestle with it or or experiencing it to to have more of an Enlightenment of what that's akin to or where it comes from so that we can have the right attitude towards it now as we Define hate at the outset we're going to use the same definitions we had on Sunday it's an intense negative emotional response towards someone or something I'm glad that we could use that negative in there because many times we have intense emotional resp responses and we might say that it's hatred but I want us to all realize that it can be a negative this hatred that we're talking about is a negative and it's intense it's emotional and it's toward someone or something and it has its roots when we talk about hate and we even use that word in our English language we're talking about something that relates to maliciousness so it's not just U something oh I hate that restaurant well I mean really you want to burn it you want to torch it at night you know there's some things we say we just use it as a term I hate to say this or I hate to keep you long and we're really not meaning that it's malicious or full of spite but this hate I'm talking about is more than just a phrase we use as human beings and a term of convenience to express dislike but it's something that's rooted in Malice something that's rooted in spite it is a to regard something with extreme ill will it to have a pass passionate aversion to where you recoil from something and you can't stand it and I find that this kind of all begins to funnel into one view that when you hate something it's essentially your enemy or you treat it as an enemy if you hate something you would not want to see it succeed if you hate something you would not want to see it flourish or you wouldn't want to participate in it you wouldn't want to see it you wouldn't want to talk to it you wouldn't want to have it and so it's something that you would push away or you'd want to see destroyed and that's where that malice is in that Spite is and if I could put it this way and this might just be kind of a larger theme tonight so that we're contined distinguish uh uh between love and hate but also be more particular about the hate we're addressing uh in this beautiful Christmas font with the snowflakes around it it's a hate that is not of God right we're looking at a hate that is not of God so that we could say there is a hate it's a hate that's doesn't have a higher origin it's a hate that is not connected with some higher purpose that when there's a hate and it's got reason behind it and it's got some sort of comprehension behind it we're talking about a hate uh that is this purely human and carnal and if I could do so as we did on Sunday in looking at peace as kind of an opposite to hate I know that this is uh maybe very obvious but I want to look at love as the opposite of this hate we're talking about a hate that's rooted in Wrath or expresses itself in disgust or it's it's a hate that is solely based upon human perception and Human Experience and and and I hope to uh hope to show that there's a difference between or that this love is an opposite to hate maybe the best way to express this and I think this will make some sense that love is indeed the opposite of hate when it's with respect to the same thing does that make sense and because there's some things I can say man I I I really I really love apples and you say man I hate clowns and you be like I didn't realize apples were clowning and you say there's that's not an opposite it's not a comparison that's just another sentiment that's really not the opposite of my sentiments for this or and I'm not necessarily saying that I love apples how you like them apples maybe is what it is we like apples we don't love or hate them but there's a there's a hate that is the opposite of love and we could see that with respect to human language when it comes to the same thing and even in the Ecclesiastes chapter 3:8 we could just look at this in terms of the writer showing uh not Point Counterpoint but uh opposites he says a time to love we know there's a lot more in these several verses around here but says these there's times for this there's a time for happiness it's a time for weeping a time to love and then kind of this counterpart a time to hate and I know in reading that we say oh see there's a time to hate and we could say yeah but that would if we're going to say that's what it's about that it's saying there is a time to love and there's also an appropriate time to hate we'd want to know what that appropriate hate is it's showing there's a time to love there's a time to hate then even as partners to this a time of war and a time of Peace so love and peace are are are kind of connected together this hatred and warfare connected together and the writer saying there's a time for love and then in the opposite way there's a time for hate and there's a Time For Peace kind of a companion to love and but also in an opposite a time of War 1 John 4:16 it says and we have known and believe the love that God hath to us God is love the Bible expressing God in terms of love I want to use that again to show this hate as an opposite cuz God being love that word there's the gape love as we say it it and we've mentioned this several times it's a love of intelligence not human intelligence but it's a love of reason and comprehension so there's there's a basis for it it's connected to something even as it's written in the Lexicon it's corresponding and coupled with a corresponding purpose it's a love uh that is vastly higher than human love that when we talk about agape love we said that's the love of God that's a higher love because it has Intelligence it has reason it's joined with the higher purpose it it's not without basis it's not without reason it has a it's governed by a higher conscience so we say that God loves God knows all things and loves God understands the end from the beginning and loves and so that kind of love sees the big picture that kind of love is associated with a higher purpose the will of God and God's God's righteousness but when we talk about a human love I know this is simplistic language because this word is even used of God but when we talk about aelio love it's a love of affection personal affection a love of of passions or liking and it doesn't necessarily have a higher intelligence behind it it doesn't necessarily have a purpose behind it so there's a love which we say is of God and there's a love which we say is of human emotion in the same way I want to say that there's a hatred that is related to God and there's a hatred which is of god and there's also a hate that is of the world there's a hate that we can see that is associated with perfect love we can see that there's a hate that corresponds to a higher purpose but then there's also a hate and that's the one that we're wanting to address that is of the world and is solely of the world in John chapter 15: 17 18 and 19 he says these things I command you that you love one another and in provoking this love one to another he brings out this contrast if the world hate you you know that it hated me before it hated you so this is a hate that was in the world this this is a hate that we can say this exists within the heart of the unsaved this is a hate that exists in those who are opposed to Christ this this this is putting hatred in an arena in an area we're using a language of hate that says this is a hate that's in the heart of those that hate Christ if you were of the world the world would love his own if you were of the world the world wouldn't hate you as it does it would love you but because you are not of the world but I have chosen you out of the world therefore the world hateth you that's Jesus putting it in terms of love and hate there's love on the one hand there's hatred on the other and there's this animosity and this opposition between Christ and the world where the world hates Christ and because you are of Christ and not of the world it doesn't love you in a worldly sense but it hates you in a worldly sense God it says it this way God be in love John had said it this way in 1 John 2:15 love not the world neither the things that are in the world if any man love the world the love of the father is not in him so there's this association between a love for God and having a love for God meaning we don't love the world say oh I'm full of the love of God and I love this and I love that and I love the world and I love this and I love that and I just love everything well that would be a perversion of the love of God because God's love requires a the appropriate perception of evil and the distance from it where you would asso it you would push it away and not embrace it when you love something you look after it you care for it you would uh even if you would correct it and chastise it because you love it it's seeking to redeem it and improve it and approve it standing you don't do that with evil you say well I hate it that everyone talks so bad about evil I want to draw it in close to me I want to give evil a good name you wouldn't do that you say I I want to have nothing to do with it and so this love and hate is expressed as opposites I came across a statement today and I felt to share this brother says if it it's talking about a heart and individual says if it hates the world and loves God you don't have to sign a card to go to church and make pledges you'll be there when the door opens so those of those of you are not here tonight you just don't love God oh if if you hate the world and love God it's brother bam just kidding with that uh there's if you if you look at in those terms if there's a heart that hates the world that hatred is only right because it loves God and and he's saying that because that love for God is there we don't come to church because we hate the world and we hate Leo DEA and we hate Democrats and we hate the direction this world is going and we hate this and we hate that and that's the reason why we find ourselves in a in in a conservative leading ideology Church no we do it because we love God now in Romans 12:9 and again we're going to keep repeating this theme if we're going to be looking at hate and then now love is this opposite or where ask the question where's the love wanting us to recognize that hate finds place where love is absent this negative hate we're talking about in Romans 12:9 again a lot of this is reviewed tonight let love be without dissimulation abhor that which is evil cleave to that which is good this is an often repeated scripture uh by myself I realize that that love is to not be hypocritical and in order to have a love that is pure and correct and not hypocritical we must abhor that which is evil as we mentioned Sunday this is not a justification for anger this isn't a justification for outrage or some sort the spiteful treatment of others I'm just a wh match what is evil no this is a a to abhor means to hate but it's not a justification for anger or for wrath to abhor means to dislike to have a of it comes from the word hated or detestable and recognize how Paul is saying let love be without dis dissimulation hate that which is evil so it's connected with the gape he saying if you're really going to have pure perfect agape love you have to hate with that that which is evil as we mentioned on Sunday and we did earlier in the year when we spoke on Love and Hate he Paul said excuse me David writing through thy precepts I get understanding therefore I hate every false way Psalm 11914 through thy precepts I'm getting understanding and the more that I learn about your nature the more I learn about your way the more I hate the wrong way the more I learn about your heart the more I hate the heart that's against you and so this is a hate that is connected with the love and nature of God not a hate that we find within ourselves because we disagree not a hate because the way we've been treated not a hate because the way something makes us feel U external to us but it's a hate that's connected with the more I know your word the more I know the more I know truth the more I hate a lie the more I know about righteousness the more I hate wickedness let's say this in the scripture in Psalms 11: 5-7 the Lord trith the righteous but the wicked and him that loveth violence his soul hateth now this is uh just reading it from the King James some people don't like it but it's in the Bible he said the Lord trith the righteous but the wicked and him that loveth violence speaking about the Lord his soul hateth what a statement God tries the righteous the Lord uh tests them and proves them and the the Lord tries the righteous but when it comes to the wicked and him that loves vence it says the soul of God the soul of Lord hates them that's strong language upon the wicked shall he reain snares fire and brimstone and a horrible Tempest this shall be the portion of their Cup this is upon the wicked because he hates them now it's not to be examined independently of this verse for the L the righteous Lord for the Lord the righteous Lord loveth righteousness the Lord is righteous and loves righteousness the right righteous lord loves righteousness his countenance doth behold the upright then we can look at it this way when God speaks about punishing the unrighteous or punishing the wicked his punishment for wickedness is proportional to his love for righteousness his punishment to wickedness is proportional to his reward for righteousness his punishment for lying is proportional to his reward for telling the truth so there's some it's it's this counterpart or this opposite measure or extreme only because love exists it's not a God that spiteful and vengeful and God that's hateful and God that's mean and a God that's judging apart from a God that's a rewarder and a God that gives and a God that's kind and a God That Forgives the wicked that he that he hates them that loves violence he hates because the lord loves righteousness Amen in Psalms 37:28 for the Lord loveth judgment and forsaketh not his Saints they are preserved forever but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off why because God loves righteousness it's not that God just hates wickedness for wickedness sake but his his hatred for evil is connected with his love for righteousness are you connecting this I think it's very important as we look at the subject of hate that we know very clearly in our hearts whether or not we have the right kind of disdain for evil a a and and that it's joined with the right kind of love otherwise we can find ourselves gripped with the hatred that has been is untethered unhinged and not connected at all with the grace of God Proverbs 6: 16- 19 19 the these six things do the Lord hate yay seven are an Abomination unto him I like how that he's writing and he still has to kind of say six no wait seven we would just backs space and say seven wait seven but these six things that the Lord hate this is now giving God the language and the attribute of this emotion towards something and it's going to name them and as I name them I want you to recognize that the reason why these things are hated is because they're the opposite of something that God loves a proud look that would be the opposite of humility a lying tongue one that would tell truth and hands that shed innocent blood other than preserving it or preserving life a heart that deviseth Wicked imaginations feet that be Swift and running to Mischief a false witness that speaketh lies and he that Seth Discord among the Brethren the Bible says these things are an Abomination that means something that God detest and something that God hates God hates these things he detests them not because he's like oh I hate that I just don't like it I hate it I detest it but it's because of what he loves it's very important I think for us to recognize this St Thomas aquinus in his uh his writings in the summary of theology he's he's talking about how that love it's necessary that love precedes hate that you first have to have love and I in and in this this way I know that what I've read of his writings on this I I agree in this regard as I see in the message of the hour that this that the kind of hate what we're talking about here with God God hating this and God hating wickedness and aboring that which is evil love has to come before that he says and nothing is hated except through being contrary to a suitable thing which is loved and hence it is that very hatred and hence it is that very that every hatred is caused by love in that way in this way hatred is caused by love that if I abhor that which is evil I have to first have this love in my heart for God I can't take the scripture and these attributes God is a vengeful God and God is the wrath of God Is Spoken of and The Temper The Tempest of God before him and God hating evil and God uh judging this and judging that and we kind of pull all these righteous uh this righteous indignation of God and we kind of create this idea of what we think God is and then we try to do some God cosplay as being this angry vengeful hater of evil Avenger of righteousness and we're just mirroring and mimicking some attribute of God that is no longer associated with the nature and character of God because in order to have the hatred of God you have to have the love of God in your heart because his love agape love precedes this hate in John chap 15: 23 to 2 as we read this in the beginning I'm already getting the yawn so we'll try to hurry he that hateth me hateth my father also if I had not done among them The Works which none other man did they did not have they had not had sin but now have they both seen and hated both me and my father now if we look at that you realize Paul said because I speak the truth to you I become your enemy and Jesus saying it's because of what I've done if I never did what I did they wouldn't hate me so if we can just kind of distill that down and maybe just a general proposition truth which Jesus Christ was is being expressed and that becomes the impetus for hate that's what provokes the hate had he never said anything and spoke truth they would have just treated him like another Carpenter son or another Carpenter but because he's expressing and manifesting the true nature of God and the true nature of love and the true nature of the word that provoked a hatred inside of them and then he brings it to Psalm 69:4 but this cometh to pass that the word might be fulfilled that is written in their law they hated me without a cause now just even in that language suggests that oh is that where their error was is they didn't have a cause a true cause or justification for their hatred and we could say that sounds true I guess I could even say myself that's exactly what he's saying is they had hate but it was the wrong kind of hate they had they they rejected me but not for the right reasons because we couldn't say that the opposite of Love or the opposite of hate is to accept everything and the opposite of rejecting something is to accept it no this is to say that we if we're trying to isue evil there is a rejection of evil he said but they rejected me the truth and they hated me and he says that's not right you can't hate truth as the psalmist wrote it this way they that Hate Me Without a Cause Jesus using that very word they hated me Without a Cause but he says Be Mine enemies wrongfully to hate without a cause it's hatred without a love hatred without a Divine Purpose hatred without the right kind of power behind it if there was an actual hatred for something then the the true hatred having the love preceded and it's Genesis being in love then if there's hatred love will project to redeem that which is hated love will project to restore that which is disagreeable love will project to correct that which is wrong but when you take love out of it hate just wants to destroy what it disagrees with so to do it without a cause this was hatred without love they didn't hate Christ because he was contrary to the word they hat him because he was contrary to their interpretation of the world he says word he's like you've got it wrong to be enemies wrongfully they were my enemies wrongfully and and David even writing so I restored that which I didn't take away it's saying that I was falsely accused I was maligned I was misjudged wrongfully so I I in order to have peace I restored what was what they accused me of taking away just so that I could have peace but it's saying is I was their enemies wrongfully through lies and misunderstanding and not truth I became their enemy because someone lied on me I became an enemy because they misunderstood me I became an enemy because they disagreed with this he say it was wrong it was wrong for me to be an enemy because it wasn't based upon truth are you catching I hope they catching some small way while I'm taking a lot of time to talk about love and hate and even acknowledge that there is a hatred which is of god which is joined with the love of God of a higher purpose a hate which is a consequence of loving God how can I how can I love God in and love the world and so we're looking at the origin of Love excuse me the origin of hate and we as we mentioned it on Sunday and we were trying to show this on Sunday and I hope it becomes clear tonight when we hate we lose our peace because when we hate we go to war and you may never actually declare war you may never draw your sword you may never you know key somebody's car pop their tires or poison their coffee but in some way when you hate somebody you might in some ways going I I sure hope their Tire blows out on the i7 tomorrow right there might be something you say and it's like do you realize what you just said do you realize what you want do you realize what you're wishing upon them and so when we hate we lose our peace we relinquish it we let it go as soon as we begin to hate whatever peace we have in our heart we nudge it out and hate takes its place and and now if with that in mind I don't want you to lose sight of that that when we we hate we lose our peace but we hate because we've left love we hate because we've left love we've lost sight of it we have love in our hearts then and we can hold that love in our hearts then there's there's some sort of there's a right kind of hatred that we can have but when we lose when we begin to lose that kind of love and it loses Center and it creates some space in our spirit there's some space in our spirit for us to once we've left love then hate comes in as soon as hate comes in the next thing it does is pushes away our peace and I'm hoping I'm giving you a template to examine your life sometimes when you find yourself completely in an upheaval and you're and you're restless and things aren't working out the way you want it to and your heart and in your spirit and your temperament and be able to do some sort of forensics and say wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute let me back through this I'm at War I'm I have no peace I've lost my peace and hatred has filled that Gap I need to go back and realize how we got that to that place you realize I've left Center of God's love amen that that that to me is just a good a good template to look at as we turn to Genesis chapter 3 love is left and once you leave love hatred fills the void and once hatred gets in there the next thing it kicks out is peace now looking at the origin of hate this is obvious my wife and I were fellowshipping on this last week and she immediately began to mention this scripture and I think this is a good place to start she was mentioned in Genesis chapter 3 and I want this to be a good place to start again I know this is review it's a great time to do it on a Wednesday night you're all well taught you're at every Service uh and you've been doing so for decades so there's a lot of material we can just quickly grab for and be on the same page in Genesis CH 3: 7 to10 it says now this is after the man and his wife the man and the woman we come to know her as Eve later that she has partaken and that which was forbidden and she then brings to Adam now in the the anal ology of taking fruit they've both now partaken it says and the eyes of them both were opened and they knew that they were naked and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons I'll read this and I'll come back maybe to trying to look at the 10,000 foot View and they heard the voice of the Lord God Walking In The Garden in the cool of the day if we could somehow try to put ourselves in their shoes prior to that moment to a prior cool of the day right and what kind of emotions must they have experienced when this God was making himself known through his voice and his voice would come walking in the garden in the cool of the day and brother Brown dramatizing this is something that he would have done in that evening time in the cool of the day his he would have declared his presence with his voice and come walking in the garden and this might have been something that they would have looked forward to and embraced and it would have been that special time of the day it says and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the Trees of the G Garden that'd be like if somebody was being accused of uh tagging uh something with some graffiti hiding themselves in a spray can uh closet right probably not probably wasn't fruit of a tree that they actually partook in because then to hide yourself in the cookie jar when you bit accused of eating cookies it's not a smart idea but here they hide themselves from the presence of the Lord and the Lord God calls them to Adam and says to him where art thou God's not you know God's not like seriously this is a genu in Game of hideand-seek and God doesn't know where they are but it provoked something from Adam and he said I heard thy voice in the garden and I was afraid because I was naked and I hid myself so much that we can draw from this even in the future to use this to Central on this idea of fear but as we look at this and we try to look at in the bigger picture we know that Adam and the woman lived in a world of perfect love brother Bram describes it that way and there was perfect peace all around him there's no fear of death there's no fear of judgment this is the world that God loved and every evening God would come down in the cool of the evening have fellowship with his creation fellowship with man and the woman this would have been something that they looked forward to that they would have embraced that they would have run to but now because sin enters in it now sin precedes fear and sin preceding fear there's a dread or a tear in their heart and now they are viewing God incorrectly towards like oh I'm naked I got to hide myself I don't want to put myself at the mercy of God I want to hide from him I don't want to beg for his forgiveness I want to avoid them altogether and this fear drove them away from God who was and still is love love Came walking into the garden that evening love came that way and it was this love that was being projected and they ran from it hid themselves from it and I want you to look at this this is the origin story of hate in this very moment where there's sin which is preceded by fear it's this very situation that is then going to be the origin story of hate for Humanity maybe we'll come back to some of these elements later on fear but now as we continue to read brother brah says that God came down in this great big funnel called love and you're all familiar with that when brother man talks about how it's love that's being Spoken Here in Genesis 3 when there's a curse being given it says and the Lord God said unto the serpent because thou Hast done this Thou Art cursed above all cattle and above every beast of the field upon thy belly shalt thou go and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life and I will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel this is a prophecy of Jesus Christ these are the very things that the angels are pointing back to and they say on Earth peace and Good Will to men because now love has come down and it's going to it's brought forth a baby and a manger and the birth of Christ is on Earth peace peace and Good Will to men it is the Fulfillment of this prophecy that there will come the seed of the woman who's going to crush the Serpent's head but it's going to bruise his heel this is a prophecy of redemption this is love but right as love is being expressed through the promise of a redeemer he introduces the word hatred right I will put hatred between thee and the woman and hatred between thy seed and her seed the word there enmity is simply hatred comes from the Hebrew to be hostile to to be an enemy to I will put hostility hatred I will make thee an enemy to the woman and between thy seed and her seed there's going to be Warfare there's going to be opposition there's going to be animosity there's going to be disagreement there's going to be hate now I hope I'm not presenting something to you that you feel to be after I already said nothing new right now I'm going to present present something to you that I hope isn't so foreign or put it in a way that seems that is foreign to you but it's not that God it isn't that God is making them hate right but love is leaving When God Says When God says I'm going to put enmity it's not that God's going to you know reach into his bag of hate and put that in the serpent and it's not that God's going to reach over here and and pass out you know pass out more hatred you know kind of as the story goes for me when God was passing out noses I thought he said hoses and I asked for a long one it wasn't that God was giving out hate at that moment it was God saying now that you have done this you're going to be subject to your base nature and your base instincts whatever can influence you you're going to be subject to it you're no longer going to be connected to a higher power your channels are no longer going to be completely clear where you're in tune with the Divine you're going to become unhinged from this higher purpose and so it wasn't that God was going to make them hate but because his love was leaving he knew they would be subject to the worst Humanity would be untethered from a higher purpose and therefore they'd have to fight against hatred fight against competition and jealousy because it's not that this competition or this Warfare began in the garden it says in Revelations 12: 7 8 and9 and there was war in heaven Michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought and his angels and prevailed not neither was their place found anymore in heaven their place found anymore in heaven so now this Warfare which began in Satan this Warfare that began with his pride in his own self-estimation it's detesting the will of God it's now can no longer be in heaven it's cast down to earth and the Great Dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and Satan which deceiveth the whole world he was cast out into the Earth and his angels were cast out with him this is now the very influence behind behind the serpent what began as a war in Heaven Is Now cast down to earth so when Jesus When God says I will put enity between thee and the woman this is a declaration of war on Earth between God's kingdom and Satan's kingdom verse 15 say there's going to be war on Earth there wasn't a war on Earth in the beginning before man fell but now that man falls God's saying there's hatred now I I I I don't need to necessarily take the gene of hate and put it in you it's it's sowed it's there and this hate then is the fruit of this hostility this opposition in this Warfare now I I realize just how quickly I I may be just brushing right over that that's the origin story for hate the hate we experience today which is spiteful and malicious and mean-spirited and vindictive and jealous comes all the way back to this now it may not seem like in a lot of ways we might feel that we're justified in our hate or well it has a different story but when we begin to experience these overwhelming emotions of this negative impulse and this visceral reaction to something and we grit our teeth and we want to see something destroyed or we want to burn something up or throw a moltov cocktail into that restaurant uh that we hate we got to that's that's something that came from this here because hate is the fruit of this Warfare that God declares in Genesis 3:15 but starts out there if I can put it this way there's and and we'll look at it in the scripture there's this very specific Warfare wherein hate is an El of Satan's kingdom against God's kingdom but it it just it doesn't stop there it becomes chaotic where hate just pervades everywhere it's like and Hate Now Satan just realized he's the master of chaos if I can just get everybody hating my job is successful in Genesis 4: 5-9 we watch this hate come up as the both Abel and Cain offer sacrifices to God and Abel's is recognized by God and God shows respect and vindicates his offering Cain experiences this these emotions and what the Bible does not say I think we should read into it doesn't say that Cain got depressed and he's very Solen and began to reflect inwardly and begin to develop low self-esteem and and doing so became very uh subservient to Abel his older his younger brother and from that day on looked up to Abel as a hero and Abel manipulated him from that day forward there's a lot that it doesn't say and I think we could read into that by show showing that the very thing that ha that uh Cain experiences is this anger towards his brother right and says that the Lord Cain God did not have respect unto Cain in his offering and says and Cain was very wroth and his countenance fell he's angry and the Lord said unto Cain why are you angry why is your countenance Fallen why are you so sad if thou doest W now here's an outlet here's an Escape Thou shalt not shalt not be accepted and if thou doest not well sin lith at the door and unto thee shall be his desire and thou shalt rule over him God is now kind of provoking gain do you recognize what's happening you're angry you're upset why are you angry why are you mad why are you hating unel all you have to do is do well I I I really do want the Holy Spirit to do with your hearts to recognize that in this situation in this instance something has happened Cain is experiencing his very real emotions this very intense negative feeling and it's and it's I'm I'm suggesting tonight that his anger is being projected not just to God but to Abel and that he's developing this hatred this animosity this bitterness of my younger brother and he did this and he did that and and now he's building up this big complex towards his brother and after God has now tried to provoke him said consider what's going on here all you have to do is do what's right let go of the anger let go of the bitterness let go of the comparison let go of the fact that I Vindicated this one and not you just do what's right you'll get your just reward and you and your Vindication but he can't do it so the Bible says and Cain talked with Abel his brother why did he go talk with Abel because that was that was part of the object of his hate he was angry with Abel I don't know what it was that he said but we know it's an expression of his anger that came to pass when they were in the field that Cain rose up against Abel his brother and slew him here's this murderer in the beginning and the Lord said un to Cain where is Abel thy brother God has this habit of asking questions when man has sinned he asked Adam where are you in face of fear now he's asking Cain where's your brother in the face of hate and notice the response is this not telling and he said I don't know am I am I My Brother's Keeper do I have to look out after him am I am I the one that's supposed to be watching out over him am I the one that has to answer for him it shows the hate that he had in his heart I think it's been said in a number of different places as I've been studying on hatred it comes up quite a bit but it's been said that indifference is the opposite of hate and I could see that in the sense that indifference would almost be as just as dismissive or indifference is the opposite of Love might be the other way of putting it like when you if you really don't like something just being IND different towards it I I could see the Nuance to that I could see the argument but here Cain's hatred is expressed an indifference what do I have to look out after him so maybe maybe we need to challenge ourselves that when we really don't care if we're saying well I'm just kind of cold on it and there's really no feeling and there's no real unction there's no real prayer or burden or you feel kind of neutral about something maybe it's worth challenging ourselves whether or not it's rooted in hate or is it really just Indi difference and so here he is disavowing his brother brother he is angry he murders his brother with hatred and he's just indifferent disavows it am I My Brother's Keeper comes across says it does hey I I wouldn't even know because I don't even care about him and there's a lot of places we could draw from to express this I think this statement says it well and does God ever change his mind about his word he's talking about the difference between Jacob and Esau Jacob his whole soul was to get that birth right and that's what God recognized him in his spiritual in him spiritual brother Bren in the preceding paragraphs is talking about how that uh Esau was probably a better man and a better person in some ways by certain metrics and integrities and things and say well he probably would have made a better son or a harder worker but there was something about uh Jacob's attitude towards the birthright that pleased God and so in some it has something to do with your affections your desires what you put preeminence on and and and again God it says God hates Esau and then this he's showing how where Jacob had his desire towards one thing and how it pits him against Esau notice and it's always caused the natural to hate the spiritual it caused Cain to hate Abel it caused Kora to hate Moses it caused Judas to hate Jesus and on and on it goes now this is the origin story of hate now we may not have the same spiritual justifications we may not be expressing in terms of well they hate me because I'm super spiritual even though you've probably all said that it's not that we're put in spiritual terms but we're talking about hate that resides even in the hearts of Believers that the Lord's wanting to root out and wanting to help with us with it has its Genesis in this origin story of Cain hating Abel says and on and on it goes It causes the natural to hate the the spiritual just as Cain at the beginning hated Abel the one that God received the Sacrifice from and tries to destroy them hate tries to destroy it says even they try to destroy the influence they try to destroy everything because it's nothing but jealousy it started in Cain and proved that it was jealousy and it's still the same thing today when the natural the carnal and the spiritual meet together it proves it Satan no other way because jealousy comes from Satan I hope you're catching this that to where we might feel that in our lives there's something benign or even Justified where I have this intense hatred for this person because of this situation and where there is that hatred that has Affinity to Satan we got to recognize how it's built into fear and jealousy and these other things and how we've actually allowed ourselves for evil to overcome Us in the face of evil because in Romans as we read it don't let be don't let uh respond to evil with evil and don't over try to don't be over overcome with evil in your response because evil can if we're not careful provoke an evil response of hatred within us and it's easy to rationalize because of the way we've been made to feel and we way that the way that begins to come up in our hearts but remember the Genesis of hate is in the heart of Cain and we could say would it been would Cain have been just in murdering a Cain would Abel have been just to murder Cain I said well that just seems like a real silly question find out whatever Paradigm you operate by you might find that there could be some reflex in you to be like Cain was wrong to kill Abel but Abel maybe he would have been just to kill Cain in the heart of this he said it started in Cain hatred it proves it's Satan he's saying and then he says it because jealousy comes from Satan and then causes an impersonation of the truth somebody to try to impersonate something that isn't and they're not ordained to do how much of that we have seen in these last days oh my how much of it he's talking about impersonation but kind of the the the path to impersonation is through hatred and jealousy and hatred the path is through that competition that Spite that desire to overthrow something the to be better than something the desire to be presented as more spiritual the desire to be presented as better it doesn't have its roots in wanting to please God it has its roots in hatred and and Malice and spitefulness and envy Bible addressing this headon as it has its origin in the original sin in Leviticus 19: 1718 Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thy heart isn't it amazing it's having to tell you not to do it why would it have to say thou shalt not kill because man in his Fallen nature rationalizes about murder we also do the same when it comes to hate so the the God has to say you shall not hate your brother in thine heart Thou shalt not in any wise rebuke thy neighbor and not suffer sin upon Him Thou shalt in any wise rebuke thy neighbor and not suffer sin upon him what beautiful balance Thou shalt not avenge nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people but Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself I am the Lord amen High Praise this is where it got the Jews in trouble because they said wow who is Thy Neighbor why did they begin to split hairs about who their neighbor was is they wanted to justify hate for a group of people so they wanted to be able to carve out whether not they were actually a neighbor I want to love this one I want to love that one and I want to love my neighbor but I want to hate this one and say well isn't he your neighbor no not technically not technically my neighbor he lives across the street it's the ones that live on the side of me that are my neighbors there was just some way of trying to trying to distill water down and make a distinction so they could justify their hate justify their lack of care well who who is my neighbor oh really who you know who is it in order to cover up malice but here as God is challenging the Israelites writing this in their law don't hate your brother in your heart because it's not right don't avenge don't bear a grudge love thy neighbor as thyself as Jesus said you've heard it before love thy uh brother and hate thy enemies he says but no do good to them that despitefully use you trying to wrap this up on this origin of hate let's look at 1 John chapter 3 veres 10 to 19 this is a long several scriptures notice how John now is writing this he says in this the children of God are manifest and the children of the devil whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God neither he that loveth not his brother so if you don't love your brother whom you have seen he said you can't be of God for this is the message that you heard from the beginning that we should love one another that's that's consistent with what Christ taught it's consistent with what we see in the Old Testament not as Cain in bringing this distinction of the kind of love that we ought to have in our hearts and I would like to say not just the love that we have for our brother but the love that we have for our neighbor he is saying Cain unlike Cain who is of that Wicked one and slew his brother and why did he murder him now this is I'm getting I'm wanting to introduce all this and tell them the origin story of hate to recognize how that it also begins in us he says he hated him because his Works were evil and his brothers righteous it was by means of comparison that caused Cain to hate his brother says Marvel not my breth if the world hate you now he just kind of brings it right into what Christ was saying we know that we have passed from death into life because we love the brother he that loveth not his brother abideth in death whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer whether you raise a knife or whether you raise a stone whether you actually take life or shed blood if you hate your brother you are a murderer you are related to the emotions of Cain in the beginning and you know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him that is strong language if you hate your brother You're a murderer and you can't have eternal life very strong I hope that moderates the language of our children siblings when they say to one another I hate you and just how what that's associated with he says hereby perceive with the love of God because he laid down his life for us we ought to lay down our lives for the Brethren but who so hath this world's good world's good and seeth his brother have need and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him how dwelleth the love of God in him my little children let us not love in word neither in tongue but in deed and in truth and hereby we know that we are of the truth and shall assure our hearts before him and he begins to talk about if our hearts condemn us but this is quite an exposition in this the children of God are manifest and the children of the devil we've gone to Great Lengths this year in dealing with perfect love to not turn a turn perfect love into a litmus test that we use to dechristianize ourselves or push us out of the faith but as a challenge uh to raise the standard of the love of God in our hearts to challenge ourselves to free the love of God in our hearts and so I wouldn't want to read this in any way where you say I have very strong intense hatred for this person then I must not be a Christian I must not have eternal life but it's to challenge us in our own instincts and inclinations to realize that if I do have hatred in my heart perfect love hasn't worked its way into that spot to push it out brother Bram said it this way in the church as the children of this world controlled by the devil hate the children of God who are controlled by the spirit so hatred had this kind of animosity this kind of uh spitefulness and maliciousness I'm using the word hate to cover so many different emotions a brother shared with me this week how hatred has so many different other names and representations and it's very very true so this kind of emotional expression and however way it works its way out into other emotions and feelings it's something controlled by the devil to be used by the devil against the children of God and so when we begin to pick up that tool I want you to catch this when we pick up that tool we're using an instrument of the devil which is hatred to bring an offense to against the children of God so it's not a tool a child of God needs to use and why does it exist because love was left left in the beginning amen as we look at all these things I realize now I need to kind of fill in all some of these gaps to try to close that hatred found place when love left yeah when love isn't operating we give an opportunity for hate to work and once hate gets to work peace leaves and we find it here as Jesus deals with it as we see brother Benham talking about it when the Bible in Leviticus 19 all these different places you notice where it talks about love and it talks about hate why because as long as you have strong love it can it can it can produce the right kind of hate but as soon as that starts to leave the wrong kind of hate festers unless you think I'm trying to accuse all of us of hate I'll just say the wrong kind of hate can Fester hate came because the love left I want to just uh I want to go a little bit further tonight I think we've done well on time and we have the time to do it brother B writes this in the church age book he says elect cannot person elect elect cannot harm elect it is the reprobates that persecute and destroy the elect oh those reprobates are religious they are smart they are of the canline the serpent seed they build their bables they build their cities they build their Empires and all the while calling on God wrong kind of Kingdom Builders they hate the true seed and will do all they can even in the name of the Lord to destroy God's elect ones I want you to recognize that hatred is related to Cain that hatred is born from the sin in the beginning and God says I'll put enity between thy seed and her seed the seed of the woman and so hatred exists because the love of God lost its place this perfect world had become fallen and where you find hate first rearing its head in act in activity and action against another it's embodied in Cain it's now in the flesh of Cain and he's wroth and he's angry and he acts on his anger to take his brother's life and John picks it up and says if you hate your brother you're acting like Cain who's a murderer because if you hate your brother you are a murderer so this hatred is from Cain they hate the true seed to me I it makes sense in my mind but I realize it's kind of a concept that's hard to express I wanted to put it this way that hate is what it is and it begins its original use in utility and the reason why it even exists in the world today is because of sin and so this kind of hatred we're talking about is kind of very really Niche or Niche however you want to say it you know this is what it is but now we've co-opted it to use it in all other ways I got to hate for this I got hate for that I got hate for this I got hate for that it's like really that hatred that you now have for all these other people and all these other things and all these other ways and this hatred that's really eating you up do you realize that that hate is designed in the beginning for murder right that that hate in the beginning was fashioned in the heart in the heart of Cain by Wicked influence and now it exists in everyone's heart but it really it's a tool for murder really what it is is a tool to destroy it's a tool to hate and so if you hate Then You're a murderer and I'll say this and come to it later if you're you say well I haven't killed anybody you're killing yourself that's good amen yes because they hate the true seed this is what the Hate's used for you say why I hate this person I I hate him as a holy spirit filled person you hate him yes I hate him you have in your heart that which is in the heart of Cain on it doesn't belong in your heart it has no place in a believer's heart that kind of hate is for one purpose to destroy the truth and so it destroys you brother Brandon writes this in this moury in church age he really covers this a lot in chapter four of the church age book and and he says and when this Satan centered group was formed in this age he says it began to hate and to fight the True Believers it's just their nature they quarrel they fight when you become a a a friend of God when you become a Son of God when you become a Christian uh you don't you don't make a bunch of enemies you don't declare war on sin the war is declared on you you've taken your place and you've you've sided with truth and so it's this it's it's in them to hate you become a Christian Your Instinct isn't like one day you're just kind of hanging out with your buddy and you guys are you know doing some lines or whatever it is you do and you get the Holy Ghost and the next day you see your friend I hate you you druggy usually what you do is you're like man I want you to be free like I'm free I don't want you to be bound by that and where the hatred comes from is usually from those you're trying to love CU they misunderstand you they feel like you feel like you're better than them so let's not let the hate be enough us but it begins to hate and to fight the True Believers insisting that they the aliens were the church of god notice how organization breeds hatred Ponder think of this organization breeds hatred so we begin to have our movement organized that's it it breeds hatred why because when you become organized other organizations or anything else outside your org right Pros a threat right and so therefore just by organizing it breeds hatred within the ranks within the Empire within the city brother BR talks about the build their Bibles their cities their Empires and hate Rises up within that that petri dish of an organization it's part of the culture it must exist in order to survive in order to defend itself it hates and because organization breeds hatred it says it destroys Fellowship it makes bitterness that is what myrr means this is what but Smyrna was full of bitterness a root of bitterness defiles many I want you to look at how he brought it first to hate it began to hate organization breeds hate hate destroys Fellowship the destruction of Fellowship breeds bitterness so more and more defilement was coming in every age would feel its scars the scars of what hatred right and we could show by the word of God and from a number of statements that just inspired me as I've studied this that the hatred has increased to its Max in this age the hatred of this false Vine This Satan group this hatred of Cain it's not it's not narrow it's not narrow just in religion and say oh boy the Catholics really hate the Christian and the Pentecostals really hate the message believer and and it's not just hate in this these microcosms of disagreements theologically it's the whole world the hatred is increased and we say it's the hatred of the false find it's the hatred of came but now it's in the the one who denies God now it's in the one that doesn't even believe in Jesus Christ it's the hatred that began in the beginning now pervades everything says in 2 Timothy 3: 1-5 this know also that in the last days perilous times shall come Fierce times difficult times for men shall be and this whole language to me is so descriptive men shall be lovers of their own selves Covetous boaster proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful Unholy without natural affection truce Breakers false accusers incontinent Fierce despisers of those that are good haters of those that are good the Hebrew word the way it's written is it's against the hate their enemies to those that are good traitors heady high-m minded lovers of Pleasures more than lovers of God having a form of godliness but but denying the power thereof from such turn away hatred is increased in this hour whatever seeds it begin with in Cain I'd say it's coming to its fullness in Satan's Eden Satan's Eden is an Eden of hatred if God's Eden was an Eden of perfect love Satan's Eden is an Eden of this imperfect hatred brother Bram said in Satan's Eden Now by unbelief in no taking all of the word and not taking all the word has brought a seed of unbelief Unholy sinful hatred and eternal death is in this sinful intellectual Church age he mentions it in several places about the hatred being associated with this in rejecting the word it's brought unbelief it's brought Eternal death it's brought things that are Unholy and sinful it's brought the hate this hatred it begins where there is no love that's why I'm asking the question where's the love brother BR I'm writing in the church age book Brothers you could come to your instruments he says those who fight the humble of God and scoff and Destroy let them do it and do it they will all in the name of God and religion and if I could say this to us as Believers just let those who fight the humble of God let them scoff and Destroy we don't need to let them do it and they will do it and all in the name of God and religion but they lie they're not of God they're of their father the devil they by their deeds against any people expose themselves for what they are now think of this this is to me very very rich let them organize and repudiate the little flock they're exposing themselves for what they are how do they expose themselves he's saying they organize they repudiate the little flock a lot of things that we could look at here is markers we're looking for a marker of something that shows what they are they but further reveal to all that they are of the devil devil they are false Vine the vine that murders and what proves it their hatred proves who they are what at the end of the day proves who they are hatred the nickan Antichrist church is who they are and whether they Nam themselves as such and you say well the Church of Satan this formal organization that's a theyve proved who they are by what they named themselves you identify Yourself by whether or not you have hate those who fight the humble of God and scoff and Destroy identify who they are by their hatred they're of their father the devil and they prove themselves by their hatred the false Vine is known by its hatred is that sobering is it sobering to think that when I have bitterness in my heart and I have animosity and I have resentment and I have this fear and this horror of something whatever it might be however it might present itself in your heart and we could kind of trace it back take its DNA look at its fingerprints and say oh wow at the core of it is this hatred is it so when to realize that has no place in my heart that's right that at the end of the day that's a mark of Satan that that's a mark of the Antichrist that's a mark of a nian spirit that that's not how God motivates and that's not the real love of God and I can no longer use religion to justify and I can't say well God's a holy God and God's a vengful God and God's a god of righteous and God God of this and God God that and we're using God as an excuse to actually hate apart from perfect love it's worth challenging ourselves I share this in closing it's also in that part in chapter 4 the church age book there's so much to read from in that I I would really encourage maybe some to go back and read it in these paragraphs I've cut out quite a bit but he's talking about how in the Old Testament the worshipper would offer sacrifice and be identified with his sacrifice and still leave with the same feelings in his heart you could be jealous against your neighbor you could have offended you could have done all these things the Bible says don't hate your neighbor don't hate your brother and you could have all this guilt in your heart so you go and you offer sacrifice and your sins have been atoned but you'd walk away a hater says but in the New Testament it's not so our dying lamb is the Son of God who gave his blood a ransom for many by faith we walk up and place our hands upon that lamb we see him with the bloody wounds the lacerated back the cruel Thorns tearing his brow we feel his pain and hear him cry my God my God why hast Thou forsaken me hatred did that hatred put him on the cross hatred crucified him he said what happened the life that left that broken blood cell came back upon the repentant one you the life that was in him come back upon us we go back with no more desire to sin and now we possess a hatred for the works and lust of the Flesh and just in an odd twist one of those works of the flesh is hatred so when we really come under the influence of the work of redemption we hate hate that's what I that's what I hate I possess a hatred for the works and the lust of the flesh it it's a hatred that God has because he loves righteousness it's a hatred that I possess because of the work of the Cross and the grace that was in my life and when I have that kind of hate and it's centered because of the grace IED in Calvary when I have that kind of hate because it's centered in the Forgiveness I've experienced in the shedding of his blood when I have that kind of hate it cannot work evil it will not work malice it will not work jealousy it will not try to destroy or to tear down or injure in some sort of malicious spiteful way when I have that kind of love I can have the right kind of hate so God help me with the love of God in my heart if I can find that love then I can really find the right kind of hate and maybe I can begin to hate hate right and as odd as it may sound and paradoxal as it may sound say I hate it when I hate as it was said the the only thing we have to fear is fear itself and there seems to be some Paradox in that but yet it expresses this truth says we ought to detest hatred this hatred which is not of God a hatred that only exist in the absence of love the right kind of love the love of God so much more to get into keep praying that God would give us the right kind of Direction in this I know the Lord's dealing with hearts I know it's good for us Merry Christmas amen have the Lord have his Spirit just wash us or just as as brother uh Micah plate I think was creating me a clean heart when we were worshiping last Sunday it it's recognizing yeah there's this this spot in me that hates that resents which is which causes other emotions because there's a domino effect we've already looked at it already how brother BR begins to piece some of these things together for us and I want you to do that in your own heart as you let the Holy Spirit examine you say Lord just examine my heart I don't want to be guilty of the this kind of hate because this kind of hate we're talking about began in the wrong place I hope you could appreciate the origin story of hate let's stand together tonight
