[0:00] Romans chapter 12 verses
[0:03] 4-6 Romans chapter 12 verses 4-
[0:09] six enjoy the lovely music and
[0:11] Leadership of the worship tonight just
[0:14] uh would
[0:15] be uh easy just to kind of sit there and
[0:18] sing from one song to the next and just
[0:19] get lost in the presence of the Lord
[0:22] Romans chapter 12 we're going to begin
[0:24] with verse four uh Paul says in verse
[0:26] three though I didn't include in part of
[0:28] my text he's uh speaking that man not to
[0:30] think more of himself than he ought to
[0:33] and he's going to speak of the context
[0:34] that one would have within the body to
[0:36] be sure that they're sober and uh and
[0:39] conscious that uh God has dealt
[0:41] different measures and different gifts
[0:43] so we shouldn't think more than what we
[0:44] ought to and certainly we can't think
[0:46] bigger than the body no one member is
[0:48] bigger than the body Romans chapter 12:4
[0:51] for as we have many members in one body
[0:53] and all members have not the same office
[0:56] so we being many are one body in Christ
[1:00] and everyone members of another having
[1:03] then gifts differing according to the
[1:05] grace that is given to us whether
[1:07] prophecy let us prophesy according to
[1:10] the proportion of faith and then he
[1:12] continues on Ministry and exhortation
[1:15] but I wanted just to use this as our
[1:17] text today and we'll come to it here in
[1:19] a few moments and we desire that God
[1:21] would bless the Bible which we read we
[1:23] know that it's infallable and inspired
[1:25] and we trust that God will just amplify
[1:27] it to us by Revelation you may be seated
[1:32] I'd like to start by reading a statement
[1:34] that we ended with on
[1:36] Sunday and it it's uh quite a heavy
[1:39] statement I think and we were looking at
[1:41] how God's first Masterpiece was a family
[1:44] not just one man but that it was
[1:46] comprised of man and woman under a
[1:48] commandment to have seed to have
[1:51] children and he says notice the Great
[1:53] Masterpiece of the family and then he
[1:56] begins to kind of describe the elements
[1:58] that would pertain to family the husband
[2:00] and wife cannot truly be truly a family
[2:03] unless they are one they have to be if
[2:06] they're not they're not a good family so
[2:09] this language he begins to use uh is a
[2:12] masterpiece a Great Masterpiece of a
[2:14] family now we have a contrast and then
[2:17] even truly a family then a contrast of
[2:19] not a good family he says wife pulling
[2:21] one way and the husband another that
[2:24] would make an awful family so he's using
[2:26] some very strong language bringing up a
[2:28] very Stark contra
[2:30] between families he says but in
[2:32] agreement with love one to another
[2:34] that's a family and that was God's
[2:37] masterpie and now all the true family
[2:40] here portrays that and so we could take
[2:44] what brother bam is saying here and I
[2:46] believe that we could make the statement
[2:48] that a true family is a picture of
[2:50] Harmony and love it says all in
[2:52] agreement and love one to another that's
[2:54] a family and so with that uh with that
[2:57] image before us all in agreement
[3:00] uh uh in with uh love one to another a
[3:03] he says all true family here portrays
[3:05] that Harmony portrays that love so we
[3:07] get this picture of m a true family is
[3:09] one that's in Harmony and one that's in
[3:11] love in love with one another and all
[3:13] these parts are working so well together
[3:16] and then brother brandham introduces
[3:17] this other language on one hand you have
[3:19] not a good family or an awful family and
[3:21] then we have uh truly a family a true
[3:24] family or a masterpiece family and just
[3:27] in reading that I know that there's
[3:29] every single one of us will interpret
[3:30] this differently and we'll kind of begin
[3:32] to digest it but we filter it through
[3:34] our own experience we filter it through
[3:36] what we see and and how we feel and just
[3:38] by reading this statement immediately we
[3:40] can start think well I don't always get
[3:41] along with my spouse and well I'm I I
[3:44] I'm aranged from a family member and we
[3:46] start thinking about our own family
[3:47] history and it we can paint a very
[3:50] different picture of what our family
[3:52] circumstance is than what's being
[3:54] presented here in this statement and so
[3:57] the title that I want to have for the
[3:59] service to tonight is true
[4:01] family Ash no
[4:04] filter and and maybe for some this is
[4:06] just right over their heads for others
[4:08] it might be a little bit beneath them
[4:09] now but eventually all of us will be
[4:10] caught up on the use of a hashtag but
[4:14] this this title I I I wanted to have
[4:16] significance in using this because we
[4:17] have a true family uh that we're wanting
[4:20] to lift up that brother bam says is a
[4:22] picture of Harmony a picture of love a
[4:24] picture of agreement but I'm using this
[4:27] this hashtag even in my title uh to
[4:29] address what the expectations we have
[4:32] when we think about family and maybe
[4:34] more particularly when we the
[4:36] expectations we begin to form when
[4:38] someone's preaching on family or we hear
[4:40] certain F ideal about family because
[4:43] when we read the statement or we start
[4:44] thinking about family we hear certain
[4:45] things preached about family we form a
[4:47] picture in our mind of what family what
[4:50] we think the word says or what this
[4:52] preacher says a family should look like
[4:54] and we immediately begin to compare it
[4:55] to our own family portrait and we begin
[4:58] to compare ourselves to the image that
[5:00] we see uh in people's opinions or what
[5:02] we're processing it what we perceive it
[5:03] to be and we can have even unreasonable
[5:06] expectations about what a true family is
[5:09] and having those expectations it put pre
[5:11] puts pressure on us we think well I have
[5:13] to behave a certain way I have to act a
[5:14] certain way and so I'm using this uh no
[5:17] filter thought uh to kind of address
[5:20] those expectations um to bring to our
[5:22] mind that there are pressures that we
[5:24] place upon ourselves there's pressures
[5:26] that are placed upon us externally about
[5:28] how our family looks how it acts how we
[5:30] raise our children how we interact with
[5:32] one another within a family and then
[5:34] maybe even in some ways we're addressing
[5:36] our perceptions of other people uh how
[5:39] we form those perceptions and how those
[5:40] perceptions themselves will place
[5:42] pressure on us and I find this that as
[5:45] soon as you uh mention uh you it doesn't
[5:47] happen all the time and I'm certainly
[5:49] not trying to put this on you if you
[5:50] haven't done so but we can get nervous
[5:52] when people talk about families uh I
[5:54] even will say that even for sister
[5:56] Elizabeth she she's uh encouraged me
[5:59] well remember we have single people in
[6:00] the church and remember we have those
[6:02] who don't have family and so it just
[6:03] expresses how sometimes we can get
[6:05] nervous are you going to leave somebody
[6:06] out and what about grandparents and what
[6:08] about those who are single and what
[6:10] about those who are difficult situations
[6:12] and so all of us uh uh we could for some
[6:15] reason or another we can begin to get a
[6:17] little bit nervous like oh boy where is
[6:18] this headed and then I'm also very
[6:21] conscious of the fact that things like
[6:22] this it's uh you really set yourself up
[6:24] for a Target I've personally endured a
[6:26] lot of criticism uh for preaching on
[6:28] family and typically the comments are
[6:30] we'll just wait till he has teenagers
[6:33] and so let me just say up front if
[6:35] anything I say gives you the impression
[6:36] that I think I'm an expert on this uh I
[6:39] I I apologize and stop me uh after
[6:42] service and say look when you made that
[6:43] comment it gave everybody the impression
[6:45] that you get it got it figured out and I
[6:47] will print a full retraction in the
[6:48] morning and the next time I get up
[6:51] behind the pulpit I will clarify I in no
[6:53] way was uh uh pretending to be an expert
[6:57] on the subject matter I preached on
[6:59] father Hood one time and I titled the
[7:01] message the seven bad habits of a highly
[7:03] in ineffective father because I didn't
[7:06] know what the good habits were I'd only
[7:07] learned by experience what the bad
[7:09] habits were so I could speak from
[7:11] experience what the bad habits of a
[7:13] highly ineffective father were but I can
[7:15] say this as a as a a servant of the Lord
[7:18] a as one that studies the Bible in the
[7:20] message of the hour that we have re a
[7:22] resource in the word of God that we can
[7:24] teach from that that puts forth
[7:27] excellent examples of parenting and and
[7:30] how to behave as children and teenagers
[7:32] and a lot of lot of things in the word
[7:34] that deal with these things so some may
[7:36] be critical of it but I don't believe a
[7:37] minister setting himself forth with his
[7:39] opinion impostering himself as somebody
[7:42] that should be looked to as an authority
[7:43] but I trust that in looking at this we
[7:45] point to the word of God and you know
[7:47] that that's what I'm derived these
[7:48] teachings from and it can give you
[7:50] confidence that if it's a word of the
[7:51] Lord then there's a power of God to come
[7:53] behind it to help you fulfill it and so
[7:56] as we teach on this and we have this
[7:59] subject object of no filter my object is
[8:03] not to create a complex uh for anyone as
[8:06] uh certain images are lifted up as we
[8:08] said in a moment ago you say family
[8:10] immediately begin to think well that
[8:11] means a man and a woman with children
[8:13] and you may not fit that moment uh you
[8:15] may not have that particular dynamic in
[8:17] your life so these things when they're
[8:18] spoken of they're not done in a way to
[8:20] cause a complex or immediately begin to
[8:22] make you feel self-conscious well uh how
[8:25] do we raise our are we raising our
[8:26] children right and if we do this and if
[8:28] we do that and it we begin to get a
[8:30] little bit nervous and a little bit too
[8:32] self-conscious about the things we're
[8:33] saying and the way we're and the way
[8:35] we're acting and we do so because we
[8:37] might feel more like an awful family
[8:40] that brother brandham identifies than we
[8:42] do a true family say man husband pulling
[8:44] this way wife pulling that way and we
[8:45] just might immediately begin to see
[8:47] ourselves that way but I would hope that
[8:49] anytime a subject is addressed it could
[8:51] come forth in a positive way and being
[8:55] and having a positive gospel it would
[8:56] there would be no condemnation in it
[8:58] there would be no h no beating you up
[9:00] and making you feel worthless and
[9:02] tearing down your experience but finding
[9:03] resources and material to build you up
[9:05] to encourage you to strengthen you and
[9:08] give you the tools that you need to
[9:09] succeed as a Christian as a as a family
[9:12] member and I'm using this uh hashtag no
[9:16] filter which is a social media hashtag
[9:19] to address what some of our instincts
[9:21] are when it comes to the subject of
[9:23] family and what some of our
[9:24] misconceptions are because this hashtag
[9:27] no filter it's used um it's a common
[9:30] hashtag especially on Instagram I
[9:31] believe that's where it gained its
[9:33] traction and was used uh first and it
[9:35] was used for pictures that had not been
[9:38] altered uh with any filter or were
[9:40] supposed to have no visual enhancement
[9:42] no filter anything editing no
[9:44] photoshopping so it was presented as
[9:46] this is exactly how the image struck the
[9:48] lens uh either suggesting that the
[9:51] scenery itself the person itself had
[9:53] this uh this innate Beauty and it was
[9:56] perfect in the way that the image struck
[9:58] the lens or it was just a a photographer
[9:59] who knew just exactly how to utilize
[10:01] light and to frame a picture just right
[10:04] it was used to say hey what you're
[10:05] looking at is what it is the image
[10:08] hasn't been manipulated at all it's not
[10:10] something's not being conveyed to you
[10:11] that the one who was standing here uh uh
[10:13] didn't behold with his naked eye you're
[10:15] seeing it just as it
[10:19] is and my my point to use this filter is
[10:23] that we would all just be honest with
[10:25] ourselves and that even in ministering
[10:28] we would be honest about about the
[10:29] struggles that we all have when it comes
[10:31] to being a family the difficulties that
[10:34] come with raising children having
[10:36] Harmony in marriage uh the challenges
[10:39] that uh we face in family whether it be
[10:41] extended family or with in-laws or even
[10:43] our own parents and be honest about how
[10:46] even as Christians and message Believers
[10:48] it's not that we somehow Exempted
[10:50] ourselves from difficult relationships
[10:52] and we've just kind of found that Groove
[10:53] where everybody loves us and we all get
[10:55] along and we don't talk about politics
[10:57] over Thanksgiving that's not the reality
[11:00] right if you're afraid that someone's
[11:02] going to hear you say Amen don't you
[11:04] know maybe just move your eyebrows very
[11:06] fervently so I could at least you know
[11:09] know that you're in agreement or aent or
[11:11] just keep one raised so I at least know
[11:12] you're questioning what I'm saying but
[11:14] you're hearing it and we there's uh we
[11:17] want to be honest with ourselves just
[11:19] about the reality of
[11:21] life that not uh that uh though we
[11:25] preach that our marriages should be in
[11:26] Harmony and husbands should love their
[11:28] wives as Christ loves the church we
[11:30] realize that as husbands we do not
[11:32] always love our wives we probably
[11:34] constantly question ourselves what does
[11:36] that even mean how could I even do that
[11:38] how can I love perfectly and and and how
[11:41] can I be loved perfectly and we realize
[11:43] these are very difficult standards that
[11:44] the scripture elicits and we feel very
[11:47] woeful woefully short and fall short of
[11:49] what these standards are and so we're
[11:51] not going to try to pretend that
[11:53] everything's perfect and you need to get
[11:54] perfect and you need to have this
[11:55] perfect picture but rather this idea of
[11:58] no filter
[11:59] is used to just at the very beginning if
[12:02] the Lord would lead us to teach on this
[12:03] subject maybe for a few Services maybe
[12:05] in great detail or maybe just every once
[12:07] in a while we' realize that we want to
[12:09] do it with an honest look and not with
[12:12] the purpose of trying to create some
[12:14] kind of image that we're all striving to
[12:16] attain that doesn't first acknowledge
[12:18] that it's very difficult doesn't first
[12:20] acknowledge that things are messy
[12:21] doesn't first acknowledge that we all
[12:23] have different experiences and come from
[12:25] different directions and we'll have a
[12:26] different expression of what a true
[12:28] family looks like
[12:30] and so the purpose is to encourage not
[12:33] discourage and in no way should I
[12:36] believe the word be used uh to create a
[12:39] pressure a carnal pressure so that we
[12:41] conform to a carnal image and we can we
[12:45] do that without the pressure but then
[12:47] there's certain ideals and certain
[12:49] things that are done and certain uh uh
[12:52] Endeavors that some families might have
[12:54] and it might be even indicative of how
[12:55] one would preach and how they would want
[12:57] to raise their family and then there can
[12:58] be PR pressure that if somebody uh would
[13:01] would never let their children do this
[13:03] and uh and that becomes kind of a
[13:05] standard to someone I would never let my
[13:07] children do this we wouldn't want to
[13:09] become feel the pressure to conform to
[13:13] the image that that family has
[13:14] established for them and their children
[13:16] just by virtue of peer pressure or
[13:18] whether there be some kind of authority
[13:20] associated with it and we all kind of
[13:21] feel like well I guess we should all put
[13:23] our kids in Taekwondo because they're
[13:25] doing it and before you know it you're
[13:27] doing things that you're very
[13:28] uncomfortable with
[13:29] and so there shouldn't be this pressure
[13:31] just because one person does something a
[13:33] certain way and really one of the things
[13:35] that happens even when it comes to the
[13:36] word of the Lord God can begin to move
[13:38] someone can choose to be baptized and it
[13:40] puts a pressure on somebody else oh well
[13:42] I'm the same age and I see them getting
[13:44] baptized and you should never obey the
[13:46] word of God because of external pressure
[13:48] nor should you ever just do something
[13:51] and follow something that someone else
[13:52] is doing because you feel the pressure
[13:54] to conform to a particular image and so
[13:57] we can experience external pressure
[13:59] while this is the way things are done
[14:00] well you know brother Aaron and sister
[14:02] Elizabeth homeschooled their kids listen
[14:04] don't ever think that because we
[14:05] homeschool our kids we think that you
[14:09] should I don't think that just because
[14:12] uh uh we would choose maybe uh to do
[14:14] something and make a particular decision
[14:17] that means we've got this judgment upon
[14:18] everybody else well they're doing this
[14:20] with their kids and they let their kids
[14:21] do this and they let their kids do that
[14:22] hey away with that kind of stuff we use
[14:25] the word as our Plum line we go by the
[14:27] word of God if the word of God says to
[14:28] do do something then that would be your
[14:30] expectation that would be your measuring
[14:32] stick but if if we homeschool our kids
[14:34] we don't have this expectation that
[14:36] everybody else should because we realize
[14:38] that's a personal decision it's an
[14:39] individual decision and there's a lot
[14:41] more factors that go into it than just
[14:43] wow there's some bad influences at
[14:44] school right there's more that goes into
[14:47] it and so and maybe I'm just being very
[14:49] personal with our church tonight and I
[14:51] hope that's
[14:52] okay and because I realize there can be
[14:55] external pressure based based upon
[14:58] activity or standard ards or or certain
[15:00] things that are done let's not pressure
[15:02] ourselves the external pressure is bad
[15:04] enough that we start internalizing
[15:05] things and begin to put pressure on
[15:07] ourselves and so we would desire that in
[15:10] what we would preach and any standard
[15:12] that we might point to in the word of
[15:13] God or any example that we might use and
[15:16] if we use a personal example our desire
[15:18] would and even especially if I could
[15:20] bring it back to this idea of not having
[15:22] a
[15:22] filter and we'll go into it in more
[15:25] detail to where it may make more sense
[15:27] but you take a p picture
[15:29] and you filter it to where you remove
[15:31] hey I got a bad cold sord could you
[15:33] remove that in the picture you know my
[15:34] hair was could you add more hair back
[15:36] there like you're kind of catching my
[15:37] bald spot so then you see the picture
[15:40] and it's nothing like what the reality
[15:41] was and we don't want to paint the
[15:44] picture of family to where you're
[15:45] looking at it's always perfect it's
[15:47] always nothing's out of place and
[15:49] everything seems so Rosy and and it it
[15:51] creates this pressure on you so when
[15:53] speaking about difficult subjects and
[15:56] and even lifting up a standard in the
[15:57] word of God a family a truth family is a
[15:59] picture of Harmony and love and and we
[16:01] work together and we let Christ have
[16:03] preeminence and the tokens applied we
[16:05] would just be Desiring to inspire uh um
[16:08] that there'd be it inspire you to be
[16:11] genuine inspire you to to be honest with
[16:15] yourselves and so that ultimately we
[16:17] would all just strive to be better
[16:19] Christians that we' realize that we
[16:21] could always challenge ourselves to do
[16:23] better and that we can do better as
[16:26] Christians we can do better in our
[16:27] relationships and we can do better as it
[16:29] within our family and as a member of a
[16:31] family that that's what we want we want
[16:32] to be genuine we want to be honest we
[16:34] want to strive to do better and we never
[16:36] want to become arrogant and we never
[16:37] want to become legalistic but that's
[16:39] what these teachings are to do is to uh
[16:41] allow us to be genuine uh in our
[16:43] approach to the word of God to be honest
[16:45] with ourselves and what God's requiring
[16:47] of us so that we would have be at
[16:49] Liberty to strive to do better and not
[16:52] because we feel that we're being forced
[16:53] or we have to conform or I guess this is
[16:55] just the way that it should be but
[16:57] rather God genuinely dealing with the
[16:58] part of an individual to come into His
[17:02] Image and so using this image of no
[17:07] filter we're obviously looking at um a
[17:10] habit of social
[17:12] media and I'll say this at the beginning
[17:15] I just was kind of wrestling just with
[17:16] order maybe to structure my
[17:18] thoughts but I'll say it now and I hope
[17:21] you could hold through this thought
[17:22] through the next um few slides I want to
[17:24] use because it might seem like I've
[17:26] completely departed from uh preaching
[17:28] and then going into who knows what you
[17:30] think might think it might be but keep
[17:32] this in mind that this would be kind of
[17:34] my my my title or my thesis statement
[17:36] for this next segment of the sermon is
[17:39] that church should not create the same
[17:42] negative dynamics that Social Circles or
[17:44] social media
[17:46] do like church should not create in
[17:48] teachings the teachings of a church what
[17:50] standards that we teach in the message
[17:52] even a standards the church should have
[17:54] a and certain requirements that you
[17:55] would have for offices within the church
[17:58] those teaching and those requirements
[17:59] and those expectations should not create
[18:02] the same kind of negative dynamics that
[18:04] Social Circles do because you could have
[18:06] a Social Circle and it's the peer
[18:08] pressure when everybody does something
[18:09] wrong you want to do something wrong
[18:11] with it or everybody's forcing you to
[18:12] act a certain way because it's part of
[18:14] the social structure and we ministered
[18:16] on this in this subject of who is my
[18:17] neighbor how it's this pressure to
[18:19] conform and that sway to follow the
[18:21] crowd and we emphasized how church
[18:23] should not operate under those same
[18:25] Dynamics but there should be a higher
[18:27] power motivating the individuals to be
[18:29] part of a local assembly where it's God
[18:31] that's working in the individual parts
[18:33] and we're moving according to how God
[18:35] deals with us by Revelation it's a holy
[18:37] spirit at work and we don't fall for
[18:39] these uh these traps of of pressure and
[18:41] legalism and abuse and control to get
[18:44] everyone to kind of line up and create a
[18:46] very clean neat picture and like whoa
[18:48] isn't that church isn't everything just
[18:50] right and in place and so we do not want
[18:53] Church to create the same negative
[18:55] dynamics of that come with social media
[18:58] that's what I'll start to look at here
[19:00] for a few moments is how our interaction
[19:02] with social media and the way that we
[19:04] engage with it tends to promote more of
[19:07] a negative feeling than it does a
[19:08] positive
[19:09] one and I think that has just been so
[19:12] absolutely proven and even if you just
[19:13] went by your own experience I think that
[19:15] you would uh would agree with that but
[19:19] these carefully and I want to use a very
[19:21] deliberate phrasing as we talk about how
[19:23] a true family is a picture of Harmony
[19:26] and love when you think about about a
[19:29] social media post these carefully
[19:31] curated uh meticulously planned a a and
[19:34] heavily eded posts that are placed on
[19:36] social media they ultimately just
[19:39] deceive because you look at something
[19:42] and it's kind of like oops didn't mean
[19:43] to take that picture and and and you're
[19:45] led to believe that this is just them in
[19:48] in the Raw State and this is just how
[19:50] their their backyard looks every sunset
[19:52] and and this is what their kitchen looks
[19:54] like when they're done cooking dinner
[19:56] and you look at it you're like my
[19:58] goodness I wish had a kitchen like that
[19:59] and man you see that guy's office and
[20:02] and and you think about their family
[20:03] outings and their vacations and you see
[20:05] pictures of some of family vacation on
[20:07] Instagram you're like how come we don't
[20:09] have vacations like that right and very
[20:13] rarely do you see the hotel room right
[20:16] or the car but they're they're planned
[20:19] very meticulously uh they're carefully
[20:21] curated you don't see the whole film
[20:23] roll you just get the one that finally
[20:25] was cropped enough and filtered enough
[20:27] and was just the right angle and edited
[20:29] enough to where it's like this is what I
[20:31] want other people to think I'm seeing
[20:33] and I'm doing and really it deceives the
[20:36] one who's looking at
[20:38] it and so could you just show hands if
[20:41] you know what I'm talking about amen if
[20:43] you're not on social media have you ever
[20:45] used Airbnb or Trip Advisor and you saw
[20:48] the photos of the hotel and you're like
[20:50] booking that baby you're like that thing
[20:53] is spacious you see the size of the the
[20:55] hot tub that comes with the room and it
[20:57] just looks amazing and then you get
[20:59] there and you're like man they should
[21:00] pay this photographer a million
[21:02] bucks because they figured out all the
[21:04] force perspective and the Angles and
[21:06] everything to make you think everything
[21:07] was spacious and it was clean you didn't
[21:09] realize the pictures were 10 years old
[21:11] and you didn't realize it this every
[21:13] it's all because of
[21:15] photography they're able just to do it
[21:17] in just such a way to where it strikes
[21:18] the eye wow this is awesome this looks
[21:20] great and you look at man look at that
[21:22] antique furniture look at all those nice
[21:24] uh monochromatic this is like Pinterest
[21:26] at its best this is inst grammable I
[21:29] want to stay there and you get there and
[21:30] everything's dirty and everything's from
[21:32] Ikea and it's nothing like you thought
[21:34] so you don't have to be on Instagram to
[21:36] relate to what I'm talking about it's
[21:37] just be tricked by a picture before and
[21:40] that's what we're talking about and so I
[21:42] want to move on because there's so much
[21:44] that we could get lost in a lot of this
[21:45] and I found myself just getting pulled
[21:47] different directions this week and I
[21:48] want to stay very deliberate in a very
[21:50] narrow vein in looking at this phenomena
[21:53] but social media images are very
[21:56] influential not just because we see see
[21:58] them but because we interact with them
[22:02] be one thing just to see an image but
[22:03] social media somehow draws Us in to
[22:06] where when we see an image we like it we
[22:08] upvote it we we uh we comment on it we
[22:10] link to it we repost or retweet there's
[22:12] certain things that we do so we're not
[22:14] just a casual Observer of something but
[22:16] we're kind of drawn in and asked uh uh
[22:19] um um to hit that like button and we're
[22:21] we're we're prompted to subscribe and
[22:23] we're prompted to comment and we're kind
[22:25] of drawn into it and sometimes they they
[22:27] get us to engage in that's like comment
[22:28] and you may win a free trip wow I I
[22:31] better subscribe I better um get an
[22:34] account I better subscribe I better
[22:35] comment because I want to I want to win
[22:37] this new iPad I want to do this and what
[22:39] is it it's prompting you to interact and
[22:41] to engage on the platform so the images
[22:44] and the videos and the things that are
[22:46] uh uh the content that's created it's
[22:48] not just something you're beholding
[22:49] casually but you're kind of drawn in and
[22:51] it's in more influential because you
[22:54] interact with
[22:55] it and then there's a pressure that
[22:57] comes with it
[22:59] and if anybody's felt this before they
[23:01] might just give me a real hearty
[23:03] amen but if you engage on the platform
[23:06] especially as a content creator there's
[23:09] a pressure to get content out there and
[23:13] you say well I I I mean I just I just
[23:15] post pictures of of myself I just post
[23:18] pictures of my family once you get into
[23:20] it and you see how it works you can't
[23:22] just take that candid photo anymore of
[23:25] your baby playing with Legos right
[23:29] you got to make sure they're wearing
[23:30] that one onesie right with the colors
[23:32] just right you got to be sure that that
[23:34] really nice vintage blanket is draped
[23:37] over the couch the just right way and
[23:39] and you really start put listen if
[23:41] somebody feels like I'm talking their
[23:42] language no I just know how it is or
[23:44] talking about you I'm not talking about
[23:46] you and uh I don't have a vintage
[23:49] blanket and I don't know what the right
[23:50] colors are for the onesie so I'm not
[23:52] talking about myself but it's the images
[23:54] you see and you see what gets traction
[23:56] and what people like and what goes viral
[23:58] and and so even if you're just a regular
[24:00] Joe so now I'm St talking to brother Joe
[24:03] there's pressure to now I don't want to
[24:06] just post a family picture I don't want
[24:08] to just post a picture of my kids I
[24:09] don't just want to post a picture of the
[24:11] cake but I want all the lighting to be
[24:13] right I want the filter to be right I
[24:14] want the background to be right I want
[24:15] the mess all to be clean up and it puts
[24:17] pressure on the one posting to where
[24:19] it's got to be good or you won't get the
[24:21] likes you won't get the comments and at
[24:22] the really at the heart of it I won't be
[24:25] portraying the image that I want
[24:26] everyone to perceive about my
[24:31] cakes and then not only is there
[24:33] pressure on the one that's posting
[24:35] pressure to produce the pressure to
[24:37] refine the pressure to make it perfect
[24:39] but then there's a pressure on those who
[24:40] are following to
[24:41] participate and then by virtue if it's
[24:44] more of a social thing and not so much
[24:45] someone who's trying to make a living on
[24:47] social media then it becomes this well
[24:49] they posted this then I want to post
[24:50] that and I want to reply and I want to
[24:52] link to it and you kind of want to have
[24:53] this camaraderie that you know I've got
[24:55] cute kids too and I've got a vintage
[24:57] throw as well and I've a onesie just
[24:59] like that right me personally with feet
[25:02] and everything and so it it draws you in
[25:05] and there becomes a real it's becomes a
[25:07] real cycle of pressure and then you're
[25:11] listen that applies I'm not even talking
[25:13] to Christians I I could probably get
[25:15] eight more amens if I was just talking
[25:16] to the the lunch crowd at the
[25:19] mall so to redeem this I might try it
[25:23] tomorrow but as Christians I maybe it
[25:27] should ring a a little bit more true
[25:29] that there's a pressure that's put on us
[25:30] when we engage in social media and
[25:33] somebody asked me when we do you have a
[25:34] mission statement drafted yet I'm like a
[25:36] Miss I mean what goes into this I mean I
[25:38] got got so much work to do and I said no
[25:41] but I have a social media policy drafted
[25:44] was one of the first things the Lord
[25:45] dealt with me on and and and I I will
[25:48] say this not as a means to articulate it
[25:50] more perfectly but to help you
[25:52] understand the background that I'm
[25:53] coming from is that I realized that if I
[25:56] if we as a church wanted to have a a
[25:58] visible presence on social media then
[26:00] that can become a Gateway or means by
[26:02] which we all begin to participate on
[26:05] certain platforms and there's a pressure
[26:07] that comes with the platform there's an
[26:09] expectation that comes with it and then
[26:11] there's more points of contact and
[26:12] engagement that would go outside of just
[26:14] what the church is doing and then the
[26:16] pre the pressure is not only on the
[26:18] person who's in charge of the church
[26:19] Instagram account the pressure is not
[26:21] only on the people who are there to find
[26:23] out if service is being canceled but you
[26:25] make other contacts you begin to like
[26:26] other people and it kind of snowballs to
[26:28] where just one effort of a church to
[26:30] engage an audience can put pressure on a
[26:33] lot of bit a lot of different people and
[26:34] I would just as soon avoid it all
[26:38] together and so anybody recognize this
[26:44] Instagram I almost used the retro logo
[26:46] but going with the the more modern
[26:49] one kind of odd maybe to speak of
[26:52] Instagram being retro
[26:54] but when Instagram was originally and
[26:57] this is where that not filter is
[26:59] probably the most predominant when they
[27:01] were initially conceived and begin to
[27:04] establish itself they made very uh
[27:07] deliberate and conscious choices in
[27:09] their
[27:10] design and and the way that this is
[27:12] summarized is they made this these
[27:14] design choices that led to what they
[27:16] call a culture what was called a culture
[27:18] of perfection so this is something in
[27:20] the intent of these th those that
[27:23] conceived this platform and and how the
[27:26] users would engage in it what would be
[27:28] promoted and certain choices they made
[27:30] about what could be posted and how it
[27:31] would look and It produced a culture of
[27:34] perfection and in doing so it signal to
[27:36] the users and those who' engage on this
[27:38] platform and post pictures it told them
[27:40] kind of signal to them that the users
[27:42] that to post on Instagram is to enhance
[27:46] and in turn to
[27:48] deceive now this is not these are not my
[27:51] words like wow brother aon's really
[27:52] highlighting some of his conclusions
[27:54] here this is what the the
[27:56] autobiographers this is what this the
[27:58] writers had to say this is what uh
[28:00] people who studied Instagram and the
[28:01] founders of Instagram had to say about
[28:03] themselves it created a culture of
[28:05] perfection and it signal to those who
[28:06] would be posted on the platform that if
[28:08] you post on Instagram you
[28:10] enhance you've got to make it look
[28:13] better you got to make it look strong
[28:15] you got to make it look more bold and
[28:16] they even provided uh filters as a part
[28:19] of the product and the whole point was
[28:20] in turn to
[28:23] deceive and they say that it gave users
[28:26] permission to present their re reality
[28:29] as more beautiful than it actually was
[28:32] so you were being enabled and you were
[28:33] being encaged look I mean if you're
[28:35] going to be taking a picture that corn
[28:36] dog there's a way that you can do this
[28:38] where everybody begins to crave a corn
[28:41] dog and so they and they they gave you
[28:43] the permission they gave you not only
[28:45] the tools but they felt you they made
[28:46] you feel comfortable that I can present
[28:48] the reality of of of of my day to the
[28:51] reality of my of my room and my cozy
[28:53] place and all these I can present it in
[28:55] a way that might be somewhat deceiving
[28:57] because it's going to convey it in in a
[28:59] reality that seems more beautiful than
[29:01] it actually
[29:02] is you ever tried to take a picture of a
[29:05] full
[29:06] moon like man that is so beautiful and
[29:09] you go out there with your camera dtin
[29:11] and you go what I mean what happened
[29:15] right it doesn't come out quite exactly
[29:17] like you're seeing it and so maybe the
[29:19] opposite is true in how sometimes they
[29:21] take a picture of the some their room or
[29:23] their or theirselves and the Selfies and
[29:25] it looks so amazing and so stunning but
[29:27] really in real ity is nothing close to
[29:29] it in
[29:32] reality and so we are misled in many
[29:35] ways about the reality of the images
[29:37] that we're looking at we're misled we're
[29:40] we're caused to think something a
[29:42] certain way and believe a certain way
[29:44] about these images being posted on
[29:45] social media and there's a lot of ways
[29:47] that we're deceived by it this was said
[29:50] specifically about this app itself and
[29:52] this platform Instagram itself is that
[29:55] it was designed it was not designed
[29:59] as a neutral
[30:00] technology where you could just download
[30:03] it and use it to upload photos or you
[30:05] know share photos of the grandkids uh to
[30:07] grandparents but it was not designed to
[30:09] be neutral but it was a carefully
[30:11] crafted
[30:13] experience designed to shape behavior
[30:16] and create emotional
[30:19] attachment this is the the purpose
[30:21] behind uh Instagram and I guess as I'm
[30:23] preaching it I realize I might have been
[30:25] a little bit naive to think that there's
[30:27] no way this is going to come off as
[30:28] preaching against Instagram I wasn't
[30:30] even wanting to preach about Instagram I
[30:32] was just wanting to use these ideals of
[30:34] posting things in the image that's
[30:36] created because let's go back to the
[30:37] beginning we have a picture of an awful
[30:39] family or we have a picture of a true
[30:41] family and we have the pressure that's
[30:42] placed upon us when we hear the ideals
[30:44] of scripture and the the the the
[30:46] quotations and and the and the Paul
[30:49] saying how husbands should love their
[30:50] wives and wives respect their husbands
[30:52] and we get this image of a family
[30:54] perfectly and Holiness and everything
[30:55] neat and clean the token applied and we
[30:58] have this image but we're going to be
[30:59] honest with ourselves and say' look
[31:01] we're not going to filter Our Lives
[31:02] we're not going to filter things there's
[31:03] no filter we're going to look at our
[31:05] lives honestly and we want to be
[31:06] authentic in how we live our lives but
[31:08] we want to be striving for excellence we
[31:10] want to be striving for a walk with God
[31:12] for the token to be app applied to be a
[31:14] true family that's our aspiration to be
[31:16] a true family but we don't want to just
[31:17] to try to apply a filter to create the
[31:20] image that we think everybody should see
[31:22] in our marriage and in our family that's
[31:24] right and we've learned this by the way
[31:26] that we've engaged in social media the
[31:28] way that we post to Facebook the way
[31:29] that we post to Instagram the way that
[31:31] we use Snapchat the way that we use any
[31:33] platform let me just capture all of us
[31:35] the way that we use
[31:37] Google+ um that there's a way that it's
[31:40] we're misleading ourselves there's a way
[31:42] that we're engaging in an experience
[31:44] that's carefully crafted that's used to
[31:46] shape behavior and create an emotional
[31:50] attachment this is actually very
[31:52] explicit in the uh in the purpose of
[31:55] Facebook that they have designed find it
[31:58] and implement it and change it so that
[32:00] they can increase the frequency with
[32:02] which you visit Facebook and then
[32:04] increase the duration of the visit and
[32:08] they would be happy to do it to increase
[32:10] it to the point to where you're always
[32:12] there
[32:13] 247 they want you going there as often
[32:16] as possible and staying as long as
[32:17] possible that's the goal and the design
[32:19] behind it I thought this statement was
[32:22] very profound Kevin's sister co-founder
[32:25] of Instagram said Instagram is not for
[32:27] half eaten sand
[32:29] sandwiches why it's got to be intact
[32:32] it's got to be perfect you take the
[32:33] picture before you start eating you make
[32:35] sure you use the right filter you make
[32:36] sure you frame it just right on the
[32:38] plate make it look better than the
[32:40] menu there's listen let's all just say
[32:42] Amen there's Foods we don't even like
[32:44] but we've seen a picture of like I would
[32:46] eat it absolutely right down the goet
[32:49] I'd have two of them like and I don't
[32:50] even like oysters right but it just
[32:52] looks so good the way they do it I don't
[32:55] mind oysters myself I was just
[32:57] dramatized in somebody else who's not an
[32:58] oyster
[32:59] lover but this is the ideal behind it
[33:02] Instagram is not for half eaten
[33:05] sandwiches why the point that he's
[33:07] trying to make is we we don't just take
[33:09] the candid we don't just use the raw we
[33:11] don't use the unfiltered it needs to be
[33:13] thought out it needs to be planned it
[33:14] needs to have the it needs to create the
[33:17] kind of image that people would crave
[33:19] and desire to have the same thing or
[33:21] make them feel really really bad about
[33:23] the sandwich they're eating because
[33:25] that's ultimately what happens you're
[33:27] eating lunch you see a picture what
[33:29] somebody else eats is eating and you get
[33:31] this Envy Food Envy you begin to get
[33:33] jealous oh man I wish I was eating that
[33:34] I wish I could be at that restaurant I
[33:36] wish I could have that food that's the
[33:37] danger of these perfectly curated and
[33:40] crafted and edited and Polished photos
[33:42] that we post on social
[33:45] media Ecclesiastes chapter 1:8 says all
[33:49] things are full of Labor man cannot
[33:51] utter it all the things that are in the
[33:53] world and even as he's uh bringing it to
[33:55] the thought that the things that are in
[33:56] the world are vanity there's all sorts
[33:58] of Ambitions and Endeavors and desires
[34:00] and things that we do and things that we
[34:01] accomplish that the labor of man and
[34:03] what he has done is so great that man
[34:05] cannot really utter it all or explain
[34:07] what he is doing yet I would impose this
[34:10] yet in there yet the eye is not
[34:11] satisfied with seeing nor the ear filled
[34:14] with hearing that the world is full of
[34:16] Labor and all things are full of Labor
[34:18] and all the things that man does and all
[34:20] the things that he accomplishes and all
[34:21] the things that he would produce yet he
[34:23] still the eye is not satisfied in seeing
[34:25] what is done nor the ear filled with
[34:27] with hearing that by Nature it's dealing
[34:30] with the fact that we by Nature are
[34:32] constantly Desiring greater
[34:34] fulfillment if you have one you want
[34:36] another if you have two you want three
[34:39] if you've experienced this you want to
[34:40] experience more and it speaks to the
[34:41] nature of man that there with certain
[34:43] things you can't see enough of it you
[34:45] can't hear enough of it the more you see
[34:48] the more you want the more you hear the
[34:49] more you want and that you never
[34:51] actually get to the place like oh you
[34:53] know I've had enough of that I'm done
[34:55] you just get drawn more into it you
[34:57] don't you can't ever play the game
[34:59] enough you're like I've had my fi go
[35:00] ahead delete it I don't need anymore you
[35:02] need more of it and you engage and you I
[35:05] want more of it and it speaks to this
[35:07] this downside of human nature that can
[35:10] become addicted to something that the
[35:11] appetite becomes insatiable and that's
[35:13] how these social media platforms and the
[35:15] posting of pictures and the liking them
[35:17] and following the pursuit of them
[35:19] becomes addictive is because the eye has
[35:21] never satisfied with seeing nor the ear
[35:23] of
[35:24] hearing creates an insatiable desire
[35:28] in Proverbs chap
[35:29] 31:30 think about this then in the
[35:32] context of this phenomena favor is
[35:35] deceitful charm Acceptance in some
[35:38] translations it's Grace but it's not
[35:40] speaking of the grace of God but more
[35:42] the way that one would conduct
[35:44] themselves charm acceptance favor is
[35:47] deceitful which is fraudulent fake leads
[35:50] to disappointment favor is deceitful and
[35:52] beauty is vain Beauty speaks of the
[35:55] Elegance of shape it's the external
[35:56] image the C
[35:58] of features the proportion of Parts this
[35:59] is what is meant in the Hebrew favor is
[36:01] deceitful beauty is vain vain is this
[36:04] emptiness this is what it's describing
[36:06] you think about a woman who who would
[36:08] have a certain way about her and a
[36:09] certain way of acting and presenting
[36:12] herself and then even the beauty the
[36:14] image of her her physical shape it's
[36:15] this Elegance the Symmetry the
[36:17] proportions that that is Vanity so it's
[36:19] deceitful and it's vanity just use that
[36:21] in the image that we create could be
[36:23] about people could be about things but
[36:25] this is the same thing when it comes to
[36:26] images when it comes to our person it's
[36:29] especially relevant because that's what
[36:30] it's speaking to but a woman that fearth
[36:32] the Lord she shall be
[36:35] praised so the fear of the Lord is above
[36:38] all above the appearance and the charm
[36:41] and the Symmetry and the beauty that
[36:43] would be external because the Bible is
[36:45] saying that beauty and favor give a
[36:47] false
[36:48] representation of what's really down on
[36:50] the
[36:51] inside favor is deceitful it causes you
[36:54] could think that with this person's
[36:55] Elegance the way that they carry
[36:56] themselves or this beauty that this
[36:58] person has you begin to think about oh
[37:00] this person is a certain way but it says
[37:02] it's Vain and deceitful so these things
[37:05] actually convey an image that's not true
[37:08] certain elements certain looks certain
[37:09] ways of carrying themselves the Symmetry
[37:11] and proportion of Parts the the natural
[37:13] or even artificial Beauty the Bible
[37:15] saying it's vain it's empty and not only
[37:17] is it Vain and empty but it's
[37:19] deceitful why they could hide
[37:21] things hide a bad temperament hide a an
[37:25] Unfaithful action a a depraved mind even
[37:30] Beauty itself the Bible teaches and we
[37:31] real it's just fleeting even the the
[37:34] pleasure that you might derive from
[37:35] something like that it's not lasting
[37:36] it's fleeting it's something that you
[37:38] don't you're not going to gain the the
[37:40] long-term satisfaction it's just a
[37:42] moment it's just a picture it's just a
[37:44] it's just an image there's really no
[37:46] weight or anything you can carry that it
[37:47] just goes away as soon as the as as soon
[37:49] as the camera's turned
[37:53] off this is what the Bible's telling us
[37:56] about ay
[37:58] an image that's not
[38:00] real and how a image that's not real
[38:03] provokes this base Instinct the eyes
[38:06] never satisfied with seen the ear with
[38:07] hear with
[38:10] hearing and so there's
[38:13] a so there's there was this I don't know
[38:16] when it was and maybe I could have been
[38:18] a better student of it but you certainly
[38:20] have to be very careful and uh
[38:23] navigating social media but because
[38:26] everything was uh filtered and presented
[38:29] in such a way there was a kind of a push
[38:31] back against the filtered post and
[38:34] that's how the hashtag of no filter
[38:36] begin to be used because somebody would
[38:38] post a picture of themselves and and
[38:40] they would post a picture and they would
[38:42] filter it and everything would look real
[38:43] beautiful and the hair color just
[38:44] stunning and the eyes just unreal and
[38:47] and then it would be presented as this
[38:49] as reality so then there's a movement of
[38:51] people say We'll post things and we'll
[38:52] say hash no filter because this is kind
[38:54] of a push back against this filtering
[38:57] that's on the these platforms and people
[38:58] editing their photos and cropping them
[39:00] and doing it in such a way where where
[39:02] it conveys an image that's not true they
[39:03] want you to think that when they use the
[39:05] hashtag no filter that they are in fact
[39:07] just presenting to you the image just
[39:10] raw the way that it is but really
[39:12] there's a no filter
[39:14] fallacy they did a study of tens of
[39:16] thousands of different pictures and they
[39:17] found that 12% of all the no filter
[39:20] pictures posted that are posted are
[39:22] filtered some of them were of food most
[39:25] of them are of people so when you kind
[39:28] of extrapolate the data and you could
[39:29] conclude that of the millions and
[39:31] millions of hundreds of millions of
[39:32] photos that are posted to Instagram
[39:34] there's tens of millions of them that'll
[39:37] say this is raw this is unedited this is
[39:39] unfiltered when in fact it is so now
[39:42] they're really trying to deceive you
[39:44] they want you to say oh no this there's
[39:45] no filter there's no trickery going on
[39:47] here this is the way that it is and
[39:49] what's happening we are being duped into
[39:52] thinking that this is the way that it is
[39:54] we're being duped into thinking that
[39:56] this uh that be or the the very effort
[39:59] of people using no filter is they want
[40:01] you convince you that this is their
[40:03] natural beauty this is the natural state
[40:06] that you're perfect and completely
[40:07] natural in that image with no AIDS
[40:11] whatsoever what does that do creates
[40:13] pressure on the one who's looking I said
[40:14] I wish I could have hair like that I
[40:17] wish my vacations could be like that I
[40:18] want a dog like that let's go get a dog
[40:21] doesn't that dog look so cute why no
[40:23] filter hey this is what it is ruff ruff
[40:25] this is this is life this is raw this is
[40:28] unfiltered isn't it beautiful isn't it
[40:30] easy isn't it wonderful but yet they are
[40:33] perpetuating a lie because they want you
[40:36] to think this is without a filter when
[40:37] in fact it
[40:38] is so it just continues to perpetuate
[40:41] the reality
[40:43] Distortion that's taking place with
[40:45] people being able to use just Snippets
[40:47] and little images of their life telling
[40:50] you a story that everything's perfect
[40:51] everything's great no trouble here and
[40:54] then we believe it
[40:58] and so the social media
[41:01] climate just blurs the line between
[41:04] reality and
[41:06] Fabrication we begin to like things that
[41:08] are completely fabricated we begin to
[41:10] think certain things are idealistic that
[41:12] are completely fabricated and we want to
[41:14] achieve certain results that were
[41:17] achieved through
[41:20] trickery achieved through through um
[41:23] editing that it's not really a reality
[41:25] it's not presented to you correctly and
[41:26] you say well want to achieve that and
[41:28] I've tried and I've tried and I've tried
[41:29] there's even been with respect to music
[41:31] where there was some kind of guitar Rift
[41:33] that was used and musicians for decades
[41:36] have tried to figure it out and finally
[41:37] the guy who did it says oh I recorded it
[41:39] then played it
[41:41] backwards and like oh we were chasing
[41:44] something that could never be done or it
[41:46] was sped up in post- production and
[41:48] people are trying how do you do it how
[41:49] do you do it it's impossible it's
[41:50] impossible we can't figure it out why
[41:52] because it's been produced to be that
[41:53] way it wasn't the actual track it wasn't
[41:56] the way that it was originally done and
[41:57] people spend their whole lives trying to
[41:59] replicate something and it's all built
[42:01] upon a
[42:02] lie beat themselves up we want to do
[42:04] this we want to do this we want to do
[42:06] this we want to do this and it's just a
[42:07] a fabrication why because the lines
[42:10] between fact and reality have been
[42:12] blurred through these images that are
[42:15] that we perceive or that are
[42:18] presented even in photojournalism I'd
[42:21] come across it and I was going to maybe
[42:23] use some pictures and I I I think I had
[42:25] a little bit of foresight to know I'd
[42:26] run out of time tonight so I don't have
[42:27] them but I kept the note where in
[42:30] photojournalism there's this great
[42:32] debate that edited photos create and
[42:33] they use this phrase questions of
[42:35] objectivity truth ethics and deception
[42:39] just even with respect to
[42:41] photojournalism so you're looking at the
[42:42] cover of Newsweek or you're on
[42:45] newsweek.com and you see a picture of a
[42:48] protest in Iran and and it's a very
[42:50] striking image and it's very engaging
[42:52] and the color just right right and
[42:54] everything's very very nice but you look
[42:55] at the original image and you're like
[42:56] well was kind of dark a little bit muddy
[42:58] that's not as not as inviting and not as
[43:00] spectacular but they use an editing post
[43:03] editing process a post- production
[43:04] process to produce something that's a
[43:06] little bit more bold a little bit more
[43:07] striking and there's even a debate
[43:09] within photojournalism that this is
[43:12] dishonest that this isn't ethical and
[43:14] that this we we're really blurring the
[43:16] lines of what's objective and what's
[43:18] truthful why because it's the way that
[43:20] the audience is being engaged and then
[43:22] tricked in their
[43:25] engagement the United Kingdom Public
[43:27] Health in 2017 they named Instagram the
[43:30] worst app for mental health for young
[43:32] people for these very reasons mental
[43:35] health experts for years for decades
[43:36] have shown concern of the harmful impact
[43:39] of unrealistic images on the the of
[43:42] people how it impacts
[43:45] people they found through their research
[43:47] that editing selfies and editing photos
[43:49] of yourself are associated with body
[43:51] image uh uh uh difficulties or
[43:54] disturbances and and associated with
[43:55] eating disorders when the person's
[43:58] editing their own
[44:00] photos they say that posting and
[44:03] filtered and edited versions of yourself
[44:05] lower
[44:07] self-esteem you're doing it to try to
[44:09] make yourself look better but you're
[44:11] only making yourself feel
[44:13] worse you only have more anxiety about
[44:15] the picture that's being taken how
[44:17] people are perceiving it whether or not
[44:18] they're liking it pressure on you to con
[44:20] to convey the Right image anybody agree
[44:23] anybody know what I'm talking
[44:25] about I mean we felt this pressure
[44:27] before there were selfies before there
[44:28] was the internet but now it's just
[44:30] Amplified uh many times over and those
[44:33] who take pictures of themselves and try
[44:35] to get the right filter take the picture
[44:36] again try to edit it try to slim this
[44:38] try to do that they're just putting more
[44:39] and more pressure on themselves and the
[44:40] people who may be able to present to you
[44:43] that they're beautiful they're Dynamic
[44:44] they're rich they have all these things
[44:46] they are lying to you and they know it
[44:49] and their self-esteem gets lower and
[44:50] lower and lower they get more anxious
[44:52] more depressed and you think they live a
[44:54] Charmed
[44:56] Life but it's somebody else's
[44:59] Lamborghini right it's just a movie St
[45:01] set not their own
[45:08] jet so you might ask yourself brother
[45:11] Aon ask me rather how what in the world
[45:14] does this have to do with
[45:16] church what in the world does this have
[45:18] to do with family remember we said at
[45:20] the very outset Church the teachings of
[45:22] a church should never create the same
[45:24] negative dynamics that social media and
[45:25] Social Circles do
[45:28] these elements and these things that
[45:29] have made social media uh um
[45:34] effective and and so captivating that's
[45:36] not what church is all
[45:38] about church isn't about creating just
[45:40] the right Lighting on the platform and
[45:42] and an engaging worship band and
[45:44] everything just be so perfect where it's
[45:46] like well who wouldn't enjoy that who
[45:48] wouldn't enjoy the the syncopation who
[45:50] wouldn't enjoy uh the Rhythm who would
[45:52] enjoy this who wouldn't enjoy that and
[45:53] it's like you just you could hey come to
[45:55] church if you're a music lover you'll
[45:56] get you like it right that's that's not
[45:58] the goal that's not the aim that's not
[46:00] the the the the the purpose of it all
[46:03] and so how does this relate to church
[46:05] how does it relate to family I would say
[46:06] this we're not striving for visual
[46:09] Perfection we're not striving to produce
[46:12] the image that's postable in the end for
[46:15] social
[46:17] purposes and teaching on family or
[46:19] presenting a scriptural image of family
[46:21] is not an exercise of somehow posting a
[46:24] filtered image of what a family should
[46:26] be
[46:28] that we are not and we should not
[46:30] ourselves or I should not as one
[46:32] teaching it none of us should create
[46:34] unrealistic expectations based upon what
[46:36] we perceive to be the desired result in
[46:38] the end well if this is what it needs to
[46:41] be then we create these unrealistic
[46:43] expectations well I guess I got to look
[46:44] like this I guess I guess I got to be
[46:46] like that listen it can be a very true
[46:49] aspiration it could be the very goal
[46:51] this is what family should look like
[46:52] this is what family should be like but
[46:54] you're not going to get there overnight
[46:57] I mean take the stature of a perfect man
[46:58] take the image of a godly man take the
[47:00] example of Jesus Christ take the
[47:02] humility of our Prophet you say well I
[47:04] want to be more humble and you say well
[47:05] somehow I'm going to get there by the
[47:06] morning listen this is something we can
[47:08] see and we can Inspire to be but not
[47:10] create these unreasonable expectations
[47:12] that if I'm not it tomorrow I guess I
[47:14] can't ever be it if my family's not that
[47:17] way now then I guess my family can never
[47:19] be that way if my marriage isn't that
[47:20] way within a week or so then I guess
[47:22] it'll never be that way get rid of the
[47:24] unreasonable expectations get rid of the
[47:25] carnal way of say oh I see what you're
[47:27] trying to do God let me just take a hold
[47:28] of that and make that happen just put
[47:30] the word before you as an aspiration and
[47:33] say God I'll never get there without
[47:35] your help but I'm setting my eyes
[47:37] towards
[47:39] it we can create unreal unrealistic
[47:42] expectations based upon the perception
[47:44] that we have of what an ideal family is
[47:47] oh the perfect family does this the
[47:50] perfect family all wears matching
[47:53] clothes and plays putt putt on thir
[47:56] Thursday evenings and be sure everyone
[47:59] sees the pictures of it this is what our
[48:02] family does and our family created a
[48:04] compliment jar and every time you create
[48:07] you say a compliment we put this in it
[48:09] and then once the jar is full you get to
[48:11] use that money on something for your
[48:14] sibling and it's encouraging them to
[48:16] compliment and and we're like we got to
[48:18] get a compliment jar we've got to do
[48:21] this what happens it works one day and
[48:23] then you come by six months later and
[48:25] there's a quarter in the compliment jar
[48:28] like how in the world did all those kids
[48:30] buy socks for their siblings with the
[48:33] compliment jar that's a complete madeup
[48:36] thing by the way just made it up off the
[48:38] top of my head if anybody wants to run
[48:39] with it just let me patent this real
[48:41] quick let me you know create it take
[48:44] some ownership of it all right I've
[48:46] already got the the trademark on
[48:48] compliment
[48:49] jars and we because this is what someone
[48:52] was doing and we said this is what a
[48:54] family does this is what families do
[48:55] this is perfect this is is great all
[48:57] because we hear somebody else is doing
[48:59] it and sometimes we just have to be
[49:01] honest with ourselves so did you like it
[49:03] did the compliment jar work was wasn't
[49:05] that great in your family getting along
[49:06] like no it didn't work for
[49:08] us I guess we just don't have authentic
[49:10] enough mason
[49:15] jars and maybe with a little levity some
[49:18] of these things won't hit uh the wrong
[49:21] way or too hard we got we've got to be
[49:23] very
[49:25] careful about church ideation the
[49:27] concepts we have of church uh um the the
[49:31] the the ideologies the ideation we have
[49:33] of church and family very careful with
[49:37] that the thoughts and Concepts that we
[49:39] associate with church we have to be very
[49:41] very careful about the church or the
[49:43] families church or family
[49:46] idolization wherein we idolize a
[49:48] particular image of a church we idolize
[49:50] particular families within a church we
[49:52] have to be very careful I would just say
[49:54] this don't idolize any of them
[49:57] don't idolize a church don't idolize a
[49:59] family you could look up to one you
[50:01] could get certain uh encouragement from
[50:03] one or see an example and we ought to be
[50:04] that as families we ought to be that as
[50:06] a church but we have to be very careful
[50:08] with these family ideations these church
[50:09] ideations and then very careful because
[50:11] it's so easy sometime to idolize
[50:14] families to idolize
[50:17] church and I as I Ponder this and I'm
[50:19] just just looking at my the quotations
[50:21] and statements I have before me just to
[50:23] uh just to know kind of which way we're
[50:25] going this is coming across a lot more
[50:27] slowly than
[50:29] anticipated but we can Envy somebody and
[50:32] say I wish I had a marriage like
[50:35] them and think about the data points
[50:38] you're basing that
[50:40] on you base it upon what you see one day
[50:44] a
[50:45] week with just certain glimpses for just
[50:47] a little bit of time and then they leave
[50:48] and they go and maybe it's maybe it's
[50:50] influenced a little bit by social media
[50:52] but I hope we've kind of tore that
[50:53] construct down a little bit maybe we do
[50:56] it when we go over to to their home and
[50:58] what do you do when you have somebody
[51:00] over for dinner the house is
[51:03] clean you cook something you know is
[51:07] good and you leave and you're like I
[51:10] wish my house was always that
[51:11] clean I wish I could cook and they just
[51:14] assume wow they eat like that every
[51:16] night her house is always like that no
[51:20] no what do you do you get the house
[51:23] clean you cook the thing you know you
[51:25] can really cook right unless you're
[51:28] really really close with them then you
[51:29] don't care and those are the dinners you
[51:31] really
[51:33] enjoy and and and that's really when
[51:35] your families you're not worried about
[51:37] pretense and impressing somebody you
[51:38] just enjoy
[51:39] them and that's what church should be
[51:41] about that's what family should be about
[51:44] that's what our friendship should be
[51:45] about but we see somebody and we Envy
[51:47] them like oh you know what I wish we had
[51:49] a marriage like them I wish we had a
[51:51] home like them and you have no idea the
[51:54] hell that might exist in the home
[51:57] you have no idea just how difficult the
[51:59] marriage might be why it's just a
[52:02] picture it's all a facade it's just an
[52:04] image but yet we'll desire to be like
[52:06] somebody and have no idea just how
[52:08] horrible that life may
[52:10] be you can sometimes en a situation oh I
[52:13] wish I had that job I wish I had that
[52:15] brother schedule I wish I had that house
[52:17] one time we were on a road trip we drove
[52:19] by there beautiful setting it was out in
[52:21] the country or way off the regular roads
[52:24] and we were driving this great big
[52:25] expans of a property in a beautiful
[52:27] white house with black shutters and a
[52:30] black roof and Elizabeth said oh I wish
[52:32] I had a house like that and I said do
[52:34] you want the two marriages that came
[52:36] with
[52:39] it do you want the the the the mortgage
[52:41] or whatever it might be do you want the
[52:43] heartache do you want what comes with
[52:45] it sometimes we look at a situ I wish I
[52:47] had a house like that I wish I had cars
[52:50] like that I wish I had land like that I
[52:52] that's what I want Lord and you come to
[52:54] talk to the guy who got says well I tell
[52:55] you what you got to do what I did it
[52:56] took me three marriages before I figured
[52:58] it
[52:58] out uh never mind I don't want the house
[53:02] I don't want the
[53:03] cars because it's it's just the opt it's
[53:06] something that we see visually we oh I
[53:07] really want that we can desire a certain
[53:10] lifestyle I wish we could live that way
[53:12] I wish we could vacation that way I wish
[53:13] we could have nice things but you don't
[53:15] know the sacrifice it took for those
[53:17] people to be there to get
[53:19] it I I might have been conceiving this
[53:21] thought for later but sometimes we take
[53:23] our beginning and we compare it to some
[53:25] people's middle
[53:27] here we are at the start of a family
[53:28] here we are at the start of a job the
[53:30] start of a career and we're looking at
[53:31] somebody who's 30 years into it that's
[53:32] what I want that's what I wish I had and
[53:35] you see somebody's success you see
[53:37] somebody's possessions you see
[53:38] somebody's lifestyle go I want that I
[53:39] want that I want that but you have no
[53:41] idea the pain the sacrifice the
[53:43] suffering and everything that went in in
[53:45] a positive way to get to where they
[53:47] were and so what we want to do and we do
[53:50] it by uh uh there's certain cities that
[53:52] we've lived in and lived near where
[53:54] people say oh that's that's the rich
[53:55] part of town and you know the reality
[53:57] that's not the rich part of town that's
[53:59] two two income families that are that
[54:02] have high debt loads where they have a
[54:03] high mortgage they got high car payments
[54:05] on both their cars and it may look
[54:07] desirable they might have the square
[54:08] footage they might have the right zip
[54:09] code they might drive the right cars and
[54:11] they might have the right kind of image
[54:12] but there's a lot of debt and there's a
[54:14] lot of less time with family and there's
[54:15] a lot of working to maintain it and it's
[54:17] all a facade you think Scottsdale's got
[54:20] money no a lot of it's just fake amen
[54:22] you got to go to Paradise Valley for the
[54:23] money
[54:26] because it's image it's keeping up with
[54:29] the zip
[54:31] code and so you may desire something and
[54:33] you know you have no idea what the
[54:34] suffering is that comes with
[54:37] it and so when we would lift up a
[54:41] particular uh scriptural
[54:45] principle and we would speak on family
[54:47] or we try to encourage you and and
[54:49] assist you in these things through
[54:51] teaching we're not promoting a
[54:53] particular parenting Style
[54:56] we're not trying to set up a particular
[54:59] Family Image is more desirable than the
[55:01] other but our sole goal is to equip you
[55:03] with resources and encourage you with
[55:05] those resources in the word to be what
[55:08] God wants you to
[55:10] be because the Christian life is not a
[55:14] is not one of
[55:16] competition I want you to ponder this
[55:17] very deeply I'm running out of time
[55:19] tonight and I and I I I regret that but
[55:22] I want to emphasize some of these points
[55:24] the Christian life is not a life of
[55:26] competi
[55:28] comptition and it is not one of
[55:32] comparison and this goes with every
[55:34] aspect of family Holiness standards
[55:37] activities the way that you the the
[55:41] there's so much that can be involved I
[55:42] could give very blatant specifics but if
[55:45] we get caught up in the thing of
[55:47] competing and Counting and qualifying
[55:49] and quantifying and trying to figure out
[55:51] ways to measure success and we come up
[55:53] with our own saber metrics when it comes
[55:55] to church and it comes to Holiness and
[55:56] it comes to family and our you got to
[55:58] get rid of this whole idea the Christian
[56:00] life is not one of competition it is not
[56:02] one of
[56:03] comparison Paul in 1 Corinthians 14:26
[56:06] I'll just kind of paraphrase it he's
[56:08] like why in the world is it that every
[56:09] single one of you comes with something
[56:11] on Sunday one has a Doctrine one has a
[56:13] Pongal one has a tongue one has a
[56:15] revelation one has an
[56:16] interpretation he says let all things be
[56:18] done for edifying and Paul is pointing
[56:21] out this attitude where people showed up
[56:23] and they all had something they want to
[56:24] contribute but they were making a
[56:26] showing of
[56:27] talent oh you think your Revelation was
[56:30] good just wait till you hear these
[56:32] tongues right and it become a
[56:35] competition who can outp spiritualize
[56:37] the next person who can sing better than
[56:39] the next person and and there's
[56:41] competition and there's this uh that
[56:44] begins to crop up and this is very real
[56:45] still in churches this is very real in
[56:47] relationships with in-laws and family
[56:49] members this life is not one of
[56:51] competition this is not one of
[56:54] comparison we are not in NO phase at all
[56:57] are we in competition with each other or
[56:59] anyone
[57:00] else we have one goal the goal is Christ
[57:04] and that goal does not compete with
[57:05] anyone but it competes against the
[57:08] agenda of Satan our goal is Christ I'm
[57:10] not in competition with my brother I'm
[57:12] not in competition with his assets I'm
[57:13] not in competition with his education
[57:15] I'm not in competition with their
[57:16] cooking or what kind of things that they
[57:18] have where they live what they drive how
[57:20] they dress what kind of gifts they have
[57:22] and and what they present in terms of
[57:24] their family identity we are are not in
[57:26] competition with each other we are not
[57:28] in competition with anyone we are not in
[57:31] competition with other churches our goal
[57:33] is Christ our goal is a Rapture amen
[57:36] what are you trying to achieve brother
[57:37] Aaron with your family I want us all to
[57:39] go in a Rapture I want that token to
[57:42] have so much preeminence where I have my
[57:44] right as a father to see that my
[57:47] children are caught up into a meeting in
[57:49] the air that's our aspiration that's our
[57:51] goal I'm not in
[57:55] competition and we're not in competition
[57:57] as a
[57:59] church in Romans 12:
[58:02] 4-6 again let me just paraphrase he
[58:05] saying we're all members of the same
[58:07] body but we don't have the same
[58:10] office so he says if you have different
[58:12] gifts according to the grace that's
[58:13] given you then minister in those gifts
[58:17] according to that which has been given
[58:18] to you by
[58:20] God as you behold that scripture I want
[58:22] you to think about what is being
[58:23] presented in this it's saying be
[58:28] yourself do what is best for you do what
[58:31] is best for your family is God leads you
[58:34] now I'll say it as a caveat there
[58:36] there's you couldn't you couldn't make
[58:38] this bold claim well God's led me to go
[58:41] ahead and have another wife in the home
[58:43] because my wife really needs help and we
[58:44] just believe bless God this is what's
[58:46] really going to solve some of our
[58:47] domestic problems and I can say well if
[58:50] you feel led to do it I'm not saying
[58:52] God's not leading you but I can say it's
[58:54] contrary to the word amen
[58:56] and I can I can apprise you of what
[58:58] you're headed to and the difficulties
[59:00] that may be and I can even express maybe
[59:02] as a friend or a counselor I don't see
[59:04] this in the word of God you could be
[59:05] making a grave mistake be certain to
[59:07] pray about it so I realize that there's
[59:09] certain Avenues and certain things we
[59:10] can say and do brother and I feel really
[59:12] LED of God to go rob a
[59:14] bank and what do a lot of men tell you
[59:17] well you told me you felt led to do it
[59:18] so my hands were tied I couldn't say
[59:20] anything because you told me you felt
[59:22] led what they're just copping
[59:24] out I don't have enough gut to say
[59:27] brother I want you to stop for a minute
[59:29] you mean to tell me that God has led you
[59:31] and you're going to go in the name of
[59:32] the Lord to go rob a bank brother I'm
[59:34] sorry I don't see that according to the
[59:37] word I mean there there there's that's
[59:39] certainly within the purview of a
[59:41] Christian the one of a brother a friend
[59:42] to somebody a minister to stand on the
[59:44] word of God and if you have some kind of
[59:46] unction you have some kind of feeling
[59:47] brother that's right that's fine you
[59:49] feel led to do it let's talk about it
[59:51] let's make sure you're making the right
[59:52] decision I want to I want to promote the
[59:54] leadership of the Lord in your life
[59:55] let's go through this what are you
[59:56] looking at what are the factors you're
[59:57] seeing tell me how God's dealt with your
[59:59] heart and then you can come to a
[1:00:00] conclusion well you know what I think
[1:00:01] you're right the Lord seems to be
[1:00:02] leading you that way or say brother I
[1:00:04] see some real red flags let's go before
[1:00:06] the Lord let's put it before the Lord
[1:00:07] let's agree together that God will make
[1:00:08] his PL plan for you uh plain so I
[1:00:11] realize that when I begin to talk about
[1:00:13] these things be yourself and do as you
[1:00:15] feel led I'm not going into the area the
[1:00:18] critics will do it and people try to
[1:00:19] have a hey day with these things but
[1:00:21] listen what we're promoting is Christ
[1:00:23] having preeminence in your life and not
[1:00:26] people's
[1:00:28] opinions Christ having preeminence you
[1:00:31] make the decision that's best for you
[1:00:33] and your family according to the word of
[1:00:35] God this is what one of the translations
[1:00:38] says since we find ourselves fashioned
[1:00:40] into all these excellent formed and
[1:00:41] marvelous functioning Parts in Christ's
[1:00:43] body let us just go ahead and be what
[1:00:45] we're made to be without endly or
[1:00:48] pridefully comparing ourselves with each
[1:00:50] other or trying to be something we
[1:00:53] aren't
[1:00:58] comparing anybody seen this
[1:01:01] before it's not Ohio spelled wrong H yoh
[1:01:05] H I don't know I kind of stumbled on it
[1:01:08] assumed there might be a few hikers here
[1:01:09] in Arizona it means hike your own
[1:01:12] hike this saying it's real popular the
[1:01:14] Appalachian Trail and I find it to be
[1:01:15] with some other ones that they would
[1:01:17] tell hikers look hike your own hike how
[1:01:20] somebody else hikes this Trail you don't
[1:01:22] have to try to pattern yourself after
[1:01:23] them you don't have to go at their pace
[1:01:26] you don't have to do the things they do
[1:01:27] hike your own it's your hike it's your
[1:01:30] life it's your family it's your
[1:01:34] responsibility it's your
[1:01:36] duty you live your life you do as you
[1:01:39] feel led to do be what you were made to
[1:01:41] be be yourself do what you feel led to
[1:01:43] do and be what you were made to be
[1:01:45] without comparing yourself to other
[1:01:47] people or trying to be something you're
[1:01:49] not Mark Twain I believe said comparison
[1:01:52] is the death of joy
[1:01:55] it was uh Roosevelt Theodore Roosevelt
[1:01:58] who said comparison is the thief of
[1:02:00] Joy I may be the first preacher ever to
[1:02:03] quote Roosevelt and Mark Twain in the
[1:02:05] same
[1:02:06] service but either way they're both
[1:02:08] saying comparison can really really mess
[1:02:10] up your joy either they kill it take it
[1:02:14] away and Paul said those that compare
[1:02:16] themselves to other people are not
[1:02:19] wise because we have a human nature
[1:02:21] instinct to compare ourselves compare
[1:02:23] our possessions to compare our
[1:02:24] situations and what can happen when we
[1:02:27] do that you're comparing apples and
[1:02:32] oranges says in Galatians chapter 6: 3
[1:02:34] to 4 for if a man think himself to be
[1:02:36] something when he's nothing he deceiveth
[1:02:39] himself I thought that had such
[1:02:40] tremendous application to some of the
[1:02:42] things we labored on in the beginning
[1:02:43] about Instagram and The False Image and
[1:02:45] the filtering of things but let every
[1:02:48] man prove his own work and then shall he
[1:02:50] have rejoicing in himself alone and not
[1:02:53] in another
[1:02:56] it's saying that Joy will come to you
[1:02:58] real happiness real contentment will
[1:03:00] come to you when when you are doing what
[1:03:03] God wants you to do and when God is at
[1:03:06] work in your own life that's God that's
[1:03:08] do not by comparing yourself to somebody
[1:03:10] else I can't remember what translation
[1:03:12] this was in but it says let everyone be
[1:03:14] sure that he's doing his very best this
[1:03:16] is how this is put in the in in a modern
[1:03:18] translation let everyone be sure that
[1:03:19] he's doing his very best for then he
[1:03:21] will have the personal satisfaction of
[1:03:23] work well done and won't need to compare
[1:03:26] himself with someone
[1:03:27] else you know what has been the death to
[1:03:30] some people's growth spiritually is they
[1:03:31] begin to compare themselves to where
[1:03:33] other people are spiritually well at
[1:03:35] least I go to Every
[1:03:37] service
[1:03:40] right and we feel somewhat Justified
[1:03:42] well I'm at every service it's like well
[1:03:44] you know this did you find out this
[1:03:45] brother did such and such and that
[1:03:46] brother did such and such and you've got
[1:03:47] worse skeletons in your closet you're
[1:03:50] doing a lot of other worse things but
[1:03:52] you somehow feel more Justified because
[1:03:54] you've come up with the scale of
[1:03:56] spirituality and because you do these
[1:03:58] things more visually that are better
[1:03:59] you're like well I'm a little bit you
[1:04:00] know I feel a lot better and that's the
[1:04:02] depth of spirituality to spiritual
[1:04:04] growth when you begin to compare we have
[1:04:07] one goal Christ amen Christ being our
[1:04:10] goal we're constantly reassessing
[1:04:11] challenging ourselves I aspire to be
[1:04:13] Christlike I don't aspire to be non
[1:04:15] brother John
[1:04:17] likee like if I if I'm just as long as
[1:04:20] I'm not like brother Lucas I feel all
[1:04:23] right and what happened you'd kill
[1:04:25] yourself spiritually there's never going
[1:04:27] to be any growth he becomes your
[1:04:32] ceiling or at least your
[1:04:37] attic so let me just bring it to this as
[1:04:39] Paul is saying with you can just prove
[1:04:41] your own work do your own job do what
[1:04:43] you're led to do use the resources God
[1:04:45] has given you then you sh you can have
[1:04:46] rejoicing in the work of God in your own
[1:04:48] life without having to compare it to
[1:04:50] somebody else or somebody else get all
[1:04:53] the
[1:04:54] credit well you know why
[1:04:56] successful they're just doing what we do
[1:04:59] just following our
[1:05:02] pattern who gets all the credit who gets
[1:05:04] all the praise you know your Mentor your
[1:05:07] the one who's telling you what to do the
[1:05:08] one that's coaching you the one that's
[1:05:09] handling your social media
[1:05:12] account so I'm try to wrap this
[1:05:17] up let me bring it to the uh the point
[1:05:20] that we've been
[1:05:21] using on this no
[1:05:24] filter relationships are
[1:05:27] messy right come on just we're just
[1:05:31] family here tonight let's be honest no
[1:05:32] filter on our
[1:05:34] amens family Dynamics are
[1:05:37] complicated they can be very
[1:05:39] unique people can be have different
[1:05:41] family situations H and certain Dynamics
[1:05:45] to the family they're vastly different
[1:05:46] than the ones that you have and and it's
[1:05:48] easy for us to judge based upon
[1:05:50] appearances and and let's just be honest
[1:05:51] with ourselves that relationships
[1:05:53] themselves can be very unique can be
[1:05:54] very challenging family Dynamics can be
[1:05:56] very complicated they can be messy they
[1:05:58] come with great challenges and when I'm
[1:06:00] using this at the very beginning true
[1:06:02] family no filter it means there's no
[1:06:05] judgment that means there's no pretense
[1:06:08] it means there's no competition there's
[1:06:09] no
[1:06:11] comparison and there's no personal or
[1:06:13] political pressure on people to conform
[1:06:16] you don't put it on yourself and let not
[1:06:17] put it on others where there's some sort
[1:06:19] of external pressure being placed on
[1:06:21] certain ideals and certain ways we do
[1:06:23] things and this is what we do here and
[1:06:24] this is how we Act and this is how we
[1:06:26] dress and this is where we go and this
[1:06:27] is the image that we want to have
[1:06:29] because everyone's watching and they're
[1:06:30] looking at you and they're going to
[1:06:31] judge us and they're going to give us a
[1:06:32] bad name that's not what we lift up
[1:06:35] there's no judgment there's no pretense
[1:06:37] there's no politics there's no Cult of
[1:06:39] Personality all that goes out the window
[1:06:41] Christ has
[1:06:46] preeminence there's no
[1:06:49] competition so I I realize we're in the
[1:06:51] after hour but probably there's nothing
[1:06:53] better just to get you to perk up and
[1:06:54] just kind of stick with me
[1:06:56] maybe showing a really nice family
[1:06:59] picture and this is where I'd really
[1:07:01] like to uh this work let's see oh there
[1:07:03] you go this is where I'd really like to
[1:07:05] bring this in
[1:07:07] um bring this whole this whole thought
[1:07:10] into
[1:07:11] view here's a really nice family picture
[1:07:13] Sister Ann Loval took these pictures for
[1:07:15] us I hope that's not a a plug that she
[1:07:19] do want but uh she took these
[1:07:22] pictures and you think my I mean I
[1:07:25] certainly do think this is a beautiful
[1:07:28] family uh maybe you could take some
[1:07:30] issue with a little bit of overexposure
[1:07:31] here or something but and the glare
[1:07:33] coming off this guy's head but there's
[1:07:34] not a lot to absorb
[1:07:36] there but you have you have what is a
[1:07:39] very beautiful image and this comes in a
[1:07:42] a Christmas card and you look at like oh
[1:07:43] what a perfect family what a perfect
[1:07:45] picture and the image that strikes you
[1:07:48] this is what you see and this is the
[1:07:49] image you have of the family and this is
[1:07:51] what you're carrying in your thoughts
[1:07:53] around the holidays is this beautiful
[1:07:55] perfect family picture but it only shows
[1:07:57] you the end
[1:08:00] result I mean don't fool yourselves
[1:08:02] anybody here have family
[1:08:04] pictures I raise your hand if you've had
[1:08:07] family pictures and how many of you grit
[1:08:09] your teeth when you talk about having
[1:08:11] family pictures all you Brothers say
[1:08:14] Amen all you kids say Amen all the
[1:08:18] bribes all the Twisted ears all the
[1:08:22] pinches we needed filters to get rid of
[1:08:24] the tear streaks
[1:08:26] the we all need it why because this is
[1:08:30] just the one that's chosen among dozens
[1:08:33] if not
[1:08:34] hundreds this is the one that at the end
[1:08:36] you say well it's not perfect but this
[1:08:37] is better than all the others and it
[1:08:39] doesn't tell the full story why because
[1:08:41] there's other
[1:08:43] pictures I mean there's this is what we
[1:08:47] see but this is what happens before and
[1:08:49] look this is what you
[1:08:51] have I
[1:08:53] mean Elliot's gone he's not even in the
[1:08:58] picture this is a perfect this would
[1:09:00] have been the best family picture
[1:09:01] because it's just Jack this is Jack all
[1:09:03] the time and then don't know what else
[1:09:06] is going on here I mean they got their
[1:09:07] own thing going on she doesn't look
[1:09:09] happy with him he looks totally beat
[1:09:11] down and I'm hiding behind Elliott
[1:09:13] because I don't want you to see my look
[1:09:15] but these are the outakes this is on the
[1:09:17] same film roll but this is what's
[1:09:20] happening you you got the what do you
[1:09:22] thinking look they're just looking up to
[1:09:25] me as usual Preston's just lost in he's
[1:09:27] on the lake fishing right now
[1:09:29] daydreaming but these are the other
[1:09:31] pictures this isn't the one you got in
[1:09:33] the card is it you didn't see these did
[1:09:36] you which one did you
[1:09:39] get you got you got this one right
[1:09:43] because it it doesn't present the chaos
[1:09:46] of these
[1:09:47] pictures but this is probably a better
[1:09:49] family
[1:09:51] picture this would present us more
[1:09:53] accurately you be like why in the world
[1:09:55] did they choose that one hey no filter
[1:09:57] in 2021 we just want you to know this is
[1:09:59] who we are as MCAS this is what our day
[1:10:02] looks like this is how things are I'm
[1:10:04] listening to Eliza's G uh complaints
[1:10:06] about her brothers pran's thinking about
[1:10:10] fishing Elizabeth's wondering if any of
[1:10:12] these pictures are going to come out
[1:10:14] right and this one should have been the
[1:10:16] one this should have been the picture
[1:10:18] that made
[1:10:20] it I'm
[1:10:22] eating Elizabeth's dusting jack off
[1:10:25] right but this isn't what you get what
[1:10:27] do you get you get
[1:10:29] that you didn't even get this one
[1:10:31] because we picked the wrong
[1:10:32] one it was too similar to the other one
[1:10:35] the one we ruled out no don't do that
[1:10:36] you know head positions aren't right but
[1:10:39] this is the one you
[1:10:41] got what what point am I trying to make
[1:10:43] in all this we didn't hear back from you
[1:10:45] about whether or not you liked our
[1:10:46] picture we want more feedback for next
[1:10:48] year the musicians would come now that
[1:10:50] my no I'm just kidding I'm I'm just
[1:10:52] joking let me wrap this up but what
[1:10:54] what's the point I'm trying to
[1:10:57] make the picture doesn't tell the whole
[1:11:00] story it's a beautiful picture it's a
[1:11:02] beautiful
[1:11:04] family but it doesn't tell the story of
[1:11:06] all the shopping weeks in advance to get
[1:11:07] the right
[1:11:09] outfits doesn't it's comical in one
[1:11:12] sense but it's the reality all the
[1:11:14] returns all the fitting sessions right
[1:11:18] all the stressing the coordinating on
[1:11:21] the date and the time and the planning
[1:11:23] of the lighting and the location and is
[1:11:25] it going to be cloudy that day and is
[1:11:27] the cloud is is it is it going to have
[1:11:28] the right lighting are we doing it the
[1:11:29] right time of day is there going to be
[1:11:30] hikers on the
[1:11:32] trail are we going to be able to make it
[1:11:33] to that spot and there's weeks and weeks
[1:11:36] that go into it for some people I know
[1:11:37] some of you just kind of pull one off
[1:11:39] the photo real real candid shot this is
[1:11:41] just our family every day we wake up
[1:11:42] this way and you put it on your
[1:11:44] Christmas card but for a lot of people
[1:11:47] there's so much that goes into it where
[1:11:50] you don't see the pressure you don't see
[1:11:51] the arguing you don't have the the the
[1:11:53] bribes that are taking place and the
[1:11:54] threats of punishment and all the crying
[1:11:57] and all the pressure that goes into
[1:11:58] family
[1:12:00] pictures
[1:12:02] right right Brothers we don't look
[1:12:04] forward to it right man some some some
[1:12:07] of you just woke up bless God brother
[1:12:10] Aaron preach
[1:12:14] it so the goal of teaching on family we
[1:12:16] introduced this subject last Sunday the
[1:12:18] goal of it is not to paint a picture of
[1:12:20] a perfect
[1:12:22] family but the goal is to lift up
[1:12:24] scriptural promises
[1:12:26] the goal is to point out very word very
[1:12:28] word principles on which we can place
[1:12:30] our faith as parents place our faith as
[1:12:35] spouses set before you word that gives
[1:12:38] us a plain path to walk in I know this
[1:12:40] is a way that I can go I know this is
[1:12:42] something I can walk these are ideals in
[1:12:43] the word of God these are teachings in
[1:12:45] the word of God that that directs my
[1:12:47] path shows me the way that I go and
[1:12:49] something that it gives us a place a
[1:12:51] destination that we can walk towards but
[1:12:53] remember remember always that it's a
[1:12:55] work in
[1:12:57] progress I remember one of the things
[1:12:59] that uh in Ministry stands out to me and
[1:13:02] I'd never forget it is I was asked to
[1:13:03] give a speak a a devotion at a men's
[1:13:06] meeting back in like 2001 or something
[1:13:08] like that and being the young Minister I
[1:13:09] was and you know the young Christian I
[1:13:11] was like brothers just think with all
[1:13:13] this great teaching we have on being men
[1:13:16] we can come next time in six months and
[1:13:18] we're going to be these spiritual Giants
[1:13:20] and we're going to be creating squirrels
[1:13:22] and we're probably going to be speaking
[1:13:24] new bodies for our families and grow in
[1:13:26] Limbs and it was just like this this if
[1:13:29] we're getting this kind of teaching just
[1:13:30] think where we're going to be in six
[1:13:31] months and brother Lonnie Jenkins got up
[1:13:33] the next morning was like I don't know
[1:13:34] what that guy was talking about last
[1:13:36] night whatever his name was but listen
[1:13:38] guys this is a
[1:13:40] race this is a work in progress we're
[1:13:43] not going to arrive because we have a
[1:13:46] particular meeting because we have a
[1:13:47] particular Doctrine this is something
[1:13:48] where there's endurance it's a work in
[1:13:50] progress there is no put it in my to
[1:13:52] there is no final shot
[1:13:55] there is no perfectly framed picture
[1:13:57] with no filter isn't this a beautiful
[1:13:59] family but there are
[1:14:01] moments there will be moments there'll
[1:14:03] be times when things are being done
[1:14:05] right there'll be milestones in our
[1:14:06] families instances where we achieve
[1:14:08] something our permanent change is
[1:14:09] achieved we turn a corner we get rid of
[1:14:11] things we apply the token there will be
[1:14:13] Milestones there will be moments but
[1:14:14] we're not striving to create this
[1:14:16] perfectly unfiltered picture that's
[1:14:18] framed in a way that we say this is
[1:14:20] we're perfect we're here it's always
[1:14:22] going to be a work in progress
[1:14:26] and let me just end with this our family
[1:14:29] ambition I would trust this would be our
[1:14:31] church ambition is to please God not
[1:14:35] people as it says in Galatians 1:10 for
[1:14:38] do I now persuade men or God or do I
[1:14:40] seek to pleased men for if I yet pleased
[1:14:43] men I should not be the servant of
[1:14:45] Christ the way that it reads it's as if
[1:14:48] maybe Paul was being criticized that
[1:14:49] he's preaching to gain followers am I
[1:14:52] preaching just to gain followers am I
[1:14:54] doing this just to have a crowd am I
[1:14:56] doing this just to please men and he's
[1:14:58] saying no because if I did it just to
[1:15:00] please men I'm a man's servant and I
[1:15:04] wouldn't be a servant of Christ so we
[1:15:06] strive for biblical Excellence as a
[1:15:08] church as families as individuals not to
[1:15:10] impress people not to impress the people
[1:15:12] who are looking in not to impress the
[1:15:13] crowd that would come to our website or
[1:15:15] impress those that would stream our
[1:15:16] services we don't aspire to achieve
[1:15:18] anything that we might give an image
[1:15:21] that men would be impressed with but our
[1:15:23] we strive for perfection in the script
[1:15:25] we trive to be strive to biblical
[1:15:27] families and have the Excellence of the
[1:15:28] word of God to please
[1:15:30] God that's what we desire to do if we
[1:15:33] make our decisions whether it be certain
[1:15:35] standards or promote certain ideals or
[1:15:37] do certain things for the eyes of men or
[1:15:39] the way that people are looking at us
[1:15:40] then we become their prisoners what's so
[1:15:43] and so going to think what's so and so
[1:15:45] going to think and as I was by Pastor
[1:15:48] brother Barry coffee in the time that we
[1:15:50] were able to spend there over the past
[1:15:52] year some of the best Council he's just
[1:15:55] counseling us through this transition
[1:15:57] and this process was that he identified
[1:16:00] you that this
[1:16:02] instinct to think about to worry too
[1:16:05] much about what other people
[1:16:07] think and it mattering too much and
[1:16:11] because it matters it has weight to it
[1:16:12] it has Force to it and it was shared
[1:16:16] this with me and it became very very
[1:16:17] impactful for me because I realize if I
[1:16:19] was ever going to follow in the vision
[1:16:20] that God had for me if I was ever going
[1:16:22] to do the things that God wanted me to
[1:16:23] do I had to stop let in what everybody
[1:16:25] else would think or the the ideas I put
[1:16:27] in their minds even if they didn't have
[1:16:29] the thoughts I'm thinking them for them
[1:16:31] it couldn't
[1:16:32] matter it's okay to care but it can't
[1:16:34] matter know it can't change your
[1:16:37] decision what other people think should
[1:16:38] not influence you to be more holy what
[1:16:41] God thinks should influence you to be
[1:16:42] more holy do we just please men do we
[1:16:44] just try to please the world we try to
[1:16:46] make it palpable for Sinners to come no
[1:16:48] we want to please God and in the
[1:16:49] pleasing of God Christ is promoted and
[1:16:51] it'll draw all men unto him
[1:16:55] our goal is Harmony and love in our
[1:16:57] marriage and in our families from the
[1:16:59] inside from from something deep within
[1:17:01] us not this it something that's
[1:17:03] unfiltered it's going to come real it's
[1:17:05] going to be genuine it's going to be
[1:17:06] authentic I don't want to just create a
[1:17:08] facade I don't want to create a perfect
[1:17:10] instagrammable moment I want to be real
[1:17:12] before God I want to please God am
[1:17:14] here's a scripture that might seem odd
[1:17:16] to use in this place and I I I I realize
[1:17:18] it's a very very very lengthy sermon on
[1:17:20] a Wednesday night but in 1 Peter chapter
[1:17:22] 3: 3 and 4 he says this and it's
[1:17:26] speaking to women and how they would
[1:17:27] present themselves let your let your
[1:17:29] beauty your adorning let it not be that
[1:17:31] outward adorning of plating the hair and
[1:17:33] of wearing of gold or of putting on of
[1:17:37] apparel he says but let it be the hidden
[1:17:39] man in the heart in that which is not
[1:17:41] corruptible even the ornament of a Meek
[1:17:43] and quiet Spirit which is in the sight
[1:17:45] of God of great price that's something a
[1:17:48] picture won't
[1:17:51] convey there's all sorts of ways that
[1:17:53] you could try to present yourself as
[1:17:55] beautiful and as elegant as the
[1:17:58] scripture is saying that beauty is vain
[1:18:00] and this Grace this charm this Elegance
[1:18:03] is
[1:18:05] deceitful but this meek and quiet Spirit
[1:18:10] you can't achieve it with the
[1:18:12] filter you can't achieve it with the
[1:18:15] picture and what Peter's doing is he's
[1:18:17] not giv a
[1:18:19] strict uh prohibition on the platting of
[1:18:22] hair or wearing of jewelry or wearing
[1:18:24] certain in the Peril but he's cautioning
[1:18:26] against being consumed by how you look
[1:18:29] outwardly this is certainly instructive
[1:18:31] to sisters and how they would dress
[1:18:33] themselves and brothers likewise how
[1:18:35] consumed we can get with how we look and
[1:18:37] the type of clothes we buy and the brand
[1:18:40] loyalty that we might have but he's
[1:18:41] dealing with the being consumed with the
[1:18:44] outward appearance when what we ought to
[1:18:46] be more concerned about is what's
[1:18:48] internally happening the right kind of
[1:18:51] attitude the right kind of character the
[1:18:53] right kind of inward work Let It Be the
[1:18:55] hidden man of the Heart Lord let us be
[1:18:57] responsible for what the inside is let
[1:18:59] us create the right promote the right
[1:19:01] kind of things in our family let us have
[1:19:02] the right kind of spirit the right kind
[1:19:04] of attit towards each other let us in
[1:19:06] your sight oh God be pleasing let what
[1:19:08] we have in our hearts and the
[1:19:10] aspirations we have let it be pleasing
[1:19:12] in your sight let us have a Family
[1:19:14] Vision to please you not
[1:19:16] men it would be a lot
[1:19:19] easier a lot easier just to put on a
[1:19:21] facade and live a lie in the few
[1:19:23] instances that we have together together
[1:19:25] but that's not what we're trying to do
[1:19:27] is Trick you when we have you over for
[1:19:29] dinner into thinking that life is
[1:19:30] perfect but what we want to do is live a
[1:19:32] life that's pleasing before
[1:19:34] God to be real in his sight to be honest
[1:19:38] before
[1:19:39] him not to persuade men but to please
[1:19:43] God musicians if you would come please
[1:19:55] I want my life to be a song to
[1:19:59] him with no
[1:20:03] autotune I don't want to be
[1:20:06] manufactured I want it to be real I want
[1:20:08] it to be
[1:20:10] genuine and my
[1:20:12] whole burden tonight I thought it would
[1:20:14] be very short and just very quick and to
[1:20:16] the point but my whole burden is just to
[1:20:19] convey convey a thought and a
[1:20:22] feeling that
[1:20:24] the word presents a picture of
[1:20:28] perfection but let's not make it
[1:20:32] carnal let's not make it
[1:20:35] humanistic let's consider the origin of
[1:20:37] the one who's making who's requiring it
[1:20:40] of
[1:20:41] us who is the one that ask of us to do
[1:20:44] certain things it's the Lord by whose
[1:20:47] power do we want to accomplish it by his
[1:20:50] it's so beautiful in the scripture some
[1:20:53] of the plainest language we have of the
[1:20:55] standard that we should carry within our
[1:20:57] hearts as Jesus says be ye therefore
[1:20:59] perfect Matthew 5:48 be perfect no
[1:21:02] wiggle room there right well be perfect
[1:21:05] in the Greek perfect means average nope
[1:21:08] not
[1:21:10] true we're told be ye therefore perfect
[1:21:13] but Jesus uses a language that both
[1:21:15] challenges us and then in the same way
[1:21:17] encourages us be therefore perfect as
[1:21:21] who your heavenly father
[1:21:25] which is in heaven is
[1:21:28] perfect he doesn't leave it without
[1:21:30] context well you just need to be perfect
[1:21:31] he says be therefore perfect even as the
[1:21:34] one that births you and nurtures you is
[1:21:39] perfect so then I can yield to a process
[1:21:43] as a Son of God I can yield to a promise
[1:21:45] as a daughter of God to say Lord I am
[1:21:47] being challenged by the word to be
[1:21:49] perfect but it's not disassociated from
[1:21:51] life it's not disassociated from seed
[1:21:53] it's not disass iated from power but I'm
[1:21:55] to be perfect as my heavenly father is
[1:21:57] perfect that means I've got the DNA of
[1:21:59] perfection within me the nature of
[1:22:02] perfection is there and that if I yield
[1:22:03] to the perfect nurture of the Holy Ghost
[1:22:05] then whatever the image of perfection is
[1:22:07] for me I know that you can achieve
[1:22:10] it and remember in the very very end
[1:22:13] last time as we read that statement
[1:22:14] about a true family and loving one
[1:22:16] another and being in harmony brother man
[1:22:17] said it's a picture of redemption it's
[1:22:19] always about Redemption so let's strive
[1:22:21] not to see ourselves as buzzards when it
[1:22:23] comes to the word of God strive not to
[1:22:25] see ourselves as those that are lacking
[1:22:26] well I don't have family I don't have
[1:22:28] this my marriage is broken this happened
[1:22:30] that happened listen we're not looking
[1:22:31] at all those things we're looking at the
[1:22:33] promise of God that says he is with you
[1:22:36] will never leave you nor forsake you and
[1:22:38] we use whatever principle it may be
[1:22:40] that's expressed in the word of God to
[1:22:41] be challenged by it and say Lord I want
[1:22:43] to become more like
[1:22:46] you there's so many ways we can express
[1:22:49] Express Christlike virtue even if we
[1:22:51] remain single the rest of our lives so
[1:22:54] many ways we can express Christlike
[1:22:55] virtue within a family setting even if
[1:22:57] we never have children there's so many
[1:22:59] ways that Christ can have prence without
[1:23:01] trying to fit ourselves in a particular
[1:23:02] mold well the family is husband and wife
[1:23:05] with two and a half children a white
[1:23:06] picket fence and a and all no no no no
[1:23:09] no no no it's not the carnal things it's
[1:23:11] the spiritual
[1:23:13] things that's what we're trying to
[1:23:14] promote that's what we're wanting to
[1:23:16] point you to is not comparison not
[1:23:18] competition but Christ that's where
[1:23:20] you'll be
[1:23:21] happy is when you know Christ is pleased
[1:23:25] I remember it's always a work in
[1:23:27] progress so no matter where you're
[1:23:29] starting now you know that just by
[1:23:32] little and little I want the Lord to do
[1:23:34] a work in my life as an individual as a
[1:23:38] man as a as a husband as a wife as a
[1:23:41] father as a mother as a friend as a
[1:23:44] brother as a sister as a member of a
[1:23:47] local body Lord just do do your will in
[1:23:51] me Lord let's stand
[1:23:57] [Music]
[1:24:01] let's bow our
[1:24:02] [Music]
[1:24:15] heads our gracious heavenly
[1:24:19] father as we close our service
[1:24:22] tonight I thank you for a
[1:24:25] a congregation that is so hungry for
[1:24:28] your word and so
[1:24:31] attentive and Lord
[1:24:33] their understanding and
[1:24:35] forgiving and Lord the Liberties that I
[1:24:38] take father may they never
[1:24:40] be displeasing to you or frustrating to
[1:24:44] them in the breath of this sermon
[1:24:47] tonight we're delivering a burden that I
[1:24:49] felt should be expressed at the outset a
[1:24:52] good place to start at the beginning of
[1:24:54] the
[1:24:55] year that regardless of what would be
[1:24:57] taught regardless of what subject matter
[1:24:59] we might
[1:25:02] approach that we should never let
[1:25:04] carnality intervene never let
[1:25:07] personality grab a hold of a scriptural
[1:25:09] precept and
[1:25:11] perverted so father as it is in my heart
[1:25:14] and the burden that I
[1:25:16] have to speak on
[1:25:20] relationships whether it be in the
[1:25:22] church or family
[1:25:24] the interactions with each other Lord
[1:25:27] continuing on the subject of who is my
[1:25:29] neighbor in so many
[1:25:31] ways just to deliver some Grace
[1:25:37] tonight that we do not want to present
[1:25:39] to the people an unrealistic
[1:25:42] picture of what their lives should have
[1:25:44] been what their lives ought to be and
[1:25:48] what they already know it
[1:25:50] isn't but be honest with ourselves that
[1:25:53] marriages
[1:25:55] can be
[1:25:57] difficult relationships can have ups and
[1:25:59] downs and weak
[1:26:03] moments there can be even separations
[1:26:06] and rejoining Lord there's so many
[1:26:08] different things that if we let
[1:26:10] condemnation take a hold of it carnality
[1:26:12] take a hold of it then all of a sudden
[1:26:14] there's this image of what a perfect
[1:26:15] family looks like and we realize there's
[1:26:17] no way we could ever be
[1:26:19] that whether it be history or just fact
[1:26:22] Lord of
[1:26:25] loss of loved ones and separations and
[1:26:28] so many different factors Lord Lord we
[1:26:30] can never be in that image Lord let us
[1:26:32] lay aside the filtered
[1:26:36] picture let us lay aside the carnal
[1:26:38] representation of what a family should
[1:26:40] look like and let's just let you paint
[1:26:44] the
[1:26:45] picture we want you to start with us
[1:26:48] tonight Lord begin with
[1:26:52] me oh Lord I think I think how many
[1:26:54] times a family photo is ruined because
[1:26:58] everyone at the same time looks at the
[1:26:59] one kid and says
[1:27:02] smile and when he finally does
[1:27:04] everyone's looking down at the kid
[1:27:08] and what happened is everyone was so
[1:27:10] worried about that one person's part
[1:27:12] they didn't do their
[1:27:13] part Lord let me take my position let me
[1:27:16] take my
[1:27:17] stand let me do my part
[1:27:20] Lord I could do my part makes their
[1:27:23] parts easier to
[1:27:25] do it'll let your picture that's being
[1:27:28] painted come out right so I pray Grace
[1:27:31] upon the people tonight A Grace to
[1:27:34] apprehend the things which have been
[1:27:35] shared a Grace to internalize them
[1:27:38] appropriately a Grace to receive them to
[1:27:40] understand
[1:27:42] them and a Grace to live
[1:27:45] it we commit the people to you in the
[1:27:47] name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray
[1:27:49] amen amen
