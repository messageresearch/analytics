TRANSCRIPT
========================================
We are continuing on the subject again on the year in preview is part seven we've taken it to say that we know the will of God for us this year because his word has planned the way there's a way that God wants us to go and he's telling us the way he's pointing us the right way and then his word his plan so many of the details for us there's a lot of details that he's already been able to cover and in this we've looked at on our Wednesday nights we've approached how God's will for me this year as it relates to my personal life is that I sanctify my home gather around the word and live for others and I encourage you if you're not here on Wednesday nights I do encourage us as a body and as a church to make some effort if you don't that's fine there's no way that we're taking a grade or auditing your YouTube activities to know whether or not you're doing this but I do encourage you to go back into the archives and watch the Wednesday night services because they're always kind of a companion to what we're ministering on Sundays and these have been what we've been covering on Wednesday nights and this last Wednesday night we've ministered on living for others and it's just such a beautiful subject matter that brother Brown approaches and it's such a great subject within the scripture and so the we're looking at in sanctifying the home you're creating creating a Haven away from the influences of the world and gathering on the word you're giving the Lord his due in our lives and giving him a place and this living for others we we've phrased it as the best form of family entertainment because living for others is eternal life and brother mam said the Holy Spirit entertains the church with eternal life and I believe it's a form of family entertainment and keeping the family busy and active and our serving Christ and what we identify as our serving Christ requires us to serve one another and to serve others we cannot be self-serving and be serving Christ that in your love and Devotion to Christ it causes service to other people and that's really how we tried to bring that out and look at it on Sundays we we've looked at how this is the will of God for us as a church or our participation in church is that we would assemble ourselves together we see that as the will of God today we're going to look at contributing tithes and offerings this is the will of God for us and I'm just not going to have the time to get into the missions aspect but I I really believe that's a strong part or that is a critical part of a strong church and even a critical part of your Spiritual Development is to have a mind for Missions and a heart for Missions and we've already identified how these are God's will for us actually brother John I'm going to let you take over this at this point and we'll just leave hold it there and then once we get to that scripture in second Corinthians I'll just I'll just let you run with it so I can uh be better be better up here instead of multitasking uh we touched on it how a symbol together is God's will that we do so as much as that we are as we are able and we were last Sunday we're identifying how this consistent voluntary behavior is a strength for you spiritually and also it should be our testimony because God has a purpose in it and we identified how it's more than just the the act of going to church but God has something behind it and it's important to recognize that it is voluntary um children don't answer this but how many of you were dragged to church today right the adults have done it of their own free will now you may have dragged yourself but you had the choice this isn't compelled by the government it's not compelled by the threat of ostracization or a you know a penalty of some sort this is something that you do of your own free will and that voluntary Behavior has a purpose and it speaks something to God and God has a benefit and a blessing when you do it it's part of God's plan to build up the believer and to edify the believer to promote our spiritual growth the Foster love these are the themes that we saw in the scripture and I really do believe and I'm kind of using this language art that regular Church attendance is important for our Spiritual Development as individuals but also the spiritual well-being of our families so your attendance to church isn't I that my concern as a pastor isn't that you attend church so that the church is healthy not at all because if you do attend church in one sense that makes a healthy church but if you're only attending church to attend church and we're not providing you resources that promote your Spiritual Development and protect and the spiritual well-being of your family then that is all you're doing and my desire is not that we would attend church regularly so that our church can be real robust and healthy because we are only as strong as your families we are only as healthy as you are spiritually healthy and so we don't eat until we don't live to eat we eat to live and we don't live to go to church we go to church to live and to be spiritual spiritually well so your attendance to church is not for the local church it's for you it's for the Believers that you edify in your attendance and it's for your Spiritual Development and well-being now now we're going really slow today is this progress if I'm going slow uh and you might be saying no you haven't even got you're not going to slow Yet brother Aaron you're just taking too long but on this subject of contributing tithes and offerings this is God's will for us and I would say that it's God's will that we we give consistently happily and generously because that consistent happy giving is God's will in the scripture and I will say this and I want you to know that in all of this I recognize that it's voluntary just like church attendance I mean just like even the things you do in your home we do not have regular home audits to make sure that your home is Sanctified we do not uh have a star board where we put stars next to your name if you're gathering around the word on a regular regular basis we have no other we don't have any means of keeping track of these things in a way that we could penalize you for not doing it so I recognize this is voluntary of your own heart as you see fit in the Lord that I believe it is God's will that we do these things now in second Corinthians chapter nine verses five and six it says therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brethren that they would go before unto you and I'm going to go through this quickly go before unto you and make up beforehand your Bounty that's a word that's used of blessing it could have been said blessing but he's specifically referring to a collection of money and resources that are going to be distributed so he says make up your Bounty beforehand wherefore ye had noticed before that the same might be ready as a matter of bounty as a matter of blessing as a matter of giving and notice of covetousness so he's recognizing that the recipients aren't coveting it Paul's not covering it nowhere are you acting out of covetousness in withholding but you're willing to give I want to bring together this bounty and then this this next phrase Paul is saying this principle that is so important for us but this I say he which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully Paul is clearly trying to encourage in them to not give a little and to not be Covetous to not be stingy but to give as you are able and to give as much as you're able recognizing that that's different for every person generosity is not a certain amount but generosity has a lot to do with a person's means and their ability uh just as Jesus taught us that the Widow that gave two mites was more generous than people that gave exponentially more than she did and so it's in that thought and in that image that he's trying just to encourage and we're going to end this service today this afternoon at this rate on a very clear thought in the scripture that to me just distills it up for me and inspires me to do to be my best at giving and not necessarily attach any particular Mountain to it but just to be a giver Paul is supporting that their Free Will offerings be generous and and that they'd be abundant like bring it together don't don't be sparingly don't be stingy don't uh don't withhold but give because he's saying if you do give and it's important to recognize this theme as we go forward if you do give whatever you give to whatever measure you give you get back that there's a there's a reciprocation that you can't out give God in other words if you give he's got a way of bringing it back your way and Paul's wanting him to think about that in terms of their giving and I'll say this that as well later we'll talk about Jesus when he addressed different elements in the law and how that um under the law he was speaking of the spirit of the law Paul is not eliciting any particular amount to them because it wouldn't have been better if in the second Corinthians chapter nine if he just said hey if everybody could give 50 bucks the need would be met so then everybody could give 50 bucks and to some people who 50 bucks they spend that at Starbucks in one day like you know I can make my own coffee today and other people may have to really scrounge and collect and save just to be able to do that but something's lost as soon as you come up with a number then everybody feels that they've complied by just meeting that number and if I've shared this example with you before it's not doesn't require an amen because it's just a point in the law there's certain laws that I I deal with at a regular basis in my practice of law to where you have to make a determination whether or not um a company is called a shell company and the definition this is really good anybody wants to get into the practice of law Securities that the deafnesses of cell company is no or nominal assets or operations no no or nominal assets or operations well just tell me what's nominal and the SEC refuses to do it because they recognize that as soon as you place a dollar value that becomes the threshold that every company that wants to be a shell but technically not be a shell they just have to have to put this much money in the bank and if it was five million dollars in there trust me there's people that would just put five million dollars nominally into a bank account just so that they comply with the rule and the SEC recognizes in doing so they would be in violation of the spirit of the law therefore they make it a determination of whether or not it's only their nominally regardless of the amount so I've had clients that I've successfully argued they weren't shells who had nominal assets because they were just a software company and they didn't have a lot of assets they just had a bunch of coders you know and that's all they had and they had two MacBooks and some guys banging on keyboards a room full of monkeys on keyboards or turning out apps it's like you can't judge this the same way you would a mental a middle uh oil company or something like that and so you're like brother Aaron this is a Sunday not a Monday to wake up sorry I got carried away on my CLE requirements no I say it to say that Paul is not telling us an amount and the New Testament is silent on any specific threshold of 500 or certain percentages it's because we don't ever want to be guilty of just doing just enough just enough to get by oh that's the minimum you mean I only have to do a three-minute speech I I can I'd only have to write a 800 word essay right and so you go through and everything is and you add in a bunch of adverbs and things just to get to the amount that's not what God wants he doesn't want technical compliance he wants obedient hearts who are giving and therefore when you give if you don't meet what other people can give and there's no specific threshold you're still in God's eyes just like that widow woman who's given her all and so in verse 7 as we continue he is expressing this in such a beautiful way every man so if you sow he's saying so bountifully he says so every man according as he purposeeth in his heart so this is your own free will as you judge and discern in your heart so let him give and the only requirements and qualifications he puts on this besides being generous or Bountiful and of your own free will is to not do it grudgingly or of necessity feeling compelled that you have to don't give against your conscience like if you don't want to give don't give right don't do it don't do it against your conscience and it's it's what happens in a lot of different relationships when someone feels compelled to do something they feel like they have to do it and when I I have this saying a lot of times and people say oh brother Aaron you didn't have to do that that was so nice I always say well I felt like I had to hey and uh and I'm just joking but they might have thought I was serious like that was really weird but it's something that if you knew that someone did it because they felt like they had to immediately it's kind of like well it kind of cheapens it right you know with all these birthdays going on I mean if somebody got a gift and like well they just felt like they had to because you go to church together they felt like they had to because they got something for you it changes the whole tenor of all of it the whole feeling and meaning behind it so Paul is saying don't give against your conscience giving shouldn't be painful you shouldn't be uneasy in doing it and so I think it's good even though I guess in some ways you'd think that if you are relying upon giving in order to maintain a church and pay the bills and make a living that by any means necessary just twist their arms even if it hurts give but I don't think in the long run that's healthy I don't think that's healthy for any of us uh to be giving against our conscience so I commend you if you're only giving as you feel led and it's up to you to determine whether or not that also pleases God but he's saying don't do it grudgingly or of necessity for God loveth a cheerful Giver so he's saying you ought to be generous you ought to be willing you ought to be cheerful and happy and giving and God loves someone who willingly gives and takes pleasure and giving you'll find this theme as we'll touch on it through the scripture that this that kind of giving heart that willingness to assist and to Aid is something that pleases God it's part of the character of God in his nature and now I believe and I want to start with looking at the New Testament I believe the teaching is clear on this point that Christians should be givers and in particular they should be givers of their increase to support the work of the Lord and I bet I believe just even in all areas of Our Lives Christians should be unselfish they should be givers and that how they ought to be characterized we ministered on this last April April 25th 2022 sermon number 158 if you're counting on worship it's called total worship teaching on Christian giving so I would actually encourage our home folks here to go back and to access the archives on that and I'll be able to tell whether or not the views budge at all um so any of you are doing it unless there's some bootlegs out there of my sermons and you guys are hey we need 158. anybody got 158 on vinyl and so the the total worship teaching on Christian giving and the principle behind that is that your pain of your tithes and offerings was an act of worship and it was an act of praise to God it's part of our religious service it's part of our worship and the Very theme behind giving of your increase the act of giving of your increase is an act of worship to God in praise to God and we should never disassociate that that and I would believe that it would even be fair that as you do unto others and as you give unto others and as you do good unto all men especially those of the household of faith you do it as unto the Lord from whom you know your reward comes from and so that in your service to others it's an act of worship to God not a beautiful way to look at how you could even humble yourself to those who are mean to you do things for people that that don't can't really accept it because you're like at the end of the day Lord I'm doing this unto you as I wash their feet I see myself as washing your feet as I bear their burden I see myself as bearing your burden so I'm not just doing this uh for self-glorification and so that I could let people know that I you know I got my personal best this year in giving but I do it as an act of worship and praise to God in Proverbs chapter 3 verses 9 and 10 it says honor the Lord with thy substance glorify God out of your increase because it says and with the first fruits of thine increase so shall thy barns be filled with plenty and thy presses shall burst out with new wine this is and if you if this is connected with the general theme of giving unto the Lord and praising the Lord this isn't this isn't necessarily a call to obedience to the law but a call to something that's in God's heart and the Heart of the believer to honor the Lord with your substance and with your increase glorify God worship God honor God and this is an endless a gratitude offering to God where you have substance and increase an endless offering of gratitude to God by honoring him with these things and it says as of promise that it will lead to increase and it'll lead to blessing and plenty so this is one of the scriptures I believe we used last time to emphasize it's a form of worship that comes with a blessing and God promises to bless us and in this if you honor the Lord with your substance and with the first fruits I increase we recognize that whatever God provides through substance or increase or income that it is always there's always a part reserved for God it has been provided by God therefore I'm singling out something that I give back to God and I love uh how brother Garcia preached it and this is what I was told how brother Garcia appreciate he said that we say 10 is God's but no all or he said 10 is just the part that God asked for back and so this is how he taught it that you haven't even given yet unless you give more than 10 because that's just the 10 that he requires back and then you the rest is anything you give additionally is really giving and but another way of also looking at is that he's all it's all gods he's only asking for 10 back so he recognize this is all from God and so part's going to be reserved alone for God and it Bears to say that based upon this scripture that when we give that part the remainder of what we have given whether assets or income or increase or substance is blessed that when we give that part the remainder that we are still stewards over God says here in this scripture that I will bless that part your barns will be full and your presses will burst with new wine it says in second Corinthians chapter 9 verses 8 9 10 and God is able to make all grace abound towards you that ye always have in all sufficiency in all things may abound to every good work what is Paul saying just he said God loveth the cheerful Giver one that gives bountifully when it gets cheerfully willingly and bountifully that consistent happy generous Giver he's saying that God as he's already said if you so bountifully you rebountifully it's exactly what Proverbs is saying he said God is able to make all grace abound towards you so in in the image of giving he's saying that don't ever think that whatever you've given out you're always going to be in deficit to that amount or less that amount because God is able to make grace abound to you so you'll always have sufficiency in all things I mean that's the promise that I would highlight so much that it bleeds through to the next page that he is saying that if I give us unto the Lord he's going to make sure that he provides my needs that I'll have all sufficiency in all things and so then he quotes the scripture as it is written he have dispersed abroad he had given to the poor his righteousness remaining forever now he that ministereth seed to the sower both Minister bread for your food and multiply your seed sown and increase the fruits of your righteousness God promises to bless those who willingly and happily and generously give it's been written in the Old Testament Paul affirming it in the New Testament that those who give us unto the Lord and give in a Godly way God promises that they will have sufficiency in all things he'll bless those who give according to his word and so it could be said that if we withhold God's part whereas there's a part reserved for God and we do not give and we do not obey then there's a limit on our entire increase I think some would put it in these terms and you're tempted to put in these terms and I'll clarify later why I reserve this but some would say that if you don't give there's a curse on the rest of your assets and income and and I would say that if there is any curse it's probably related to something else involved in not just your lack of giving there's maybe something else at work but I would say that your failure to give limits your bountifulness it limits your increase it limits uh there's a there's a cap on your sufficiency there's maybe a shortcoming in your wealth and your possessions and so I believe that we're instructed according to the word of God that we ought to manage our possessions manage our increase in a way not to please ourselves but to glorify God that I'm not merely managing my asset so that I'm in a better position to borrow money I'm not merely trying to do this so that I can recognize when I've made a million dollars or there's certain benchmarks when I can become an accredited investor when I'm no longer a shell person because I'm more than nominal assets and operations it's not that kind of value system we manage our wealth we manage our assets we manage our time we manage our our bodies we manage everything not to serve ourselves to be self-serving or to please ourselves but to glorify God is that not true that everything we do we want to do it to glorify God and not just to be self-serving so Paul continues in verse 11 being enriched in everything to all bountifulness which causeth through US Thanksgiving to god notice how that your giving glorifies God and causes others to glorify God for the administration of this service not only supplyeth the want of the Saints but is abundant also by many thanksgivings unto God whilst by the experiment of this menstruation they glorify God for your professed subjection unto the gospel of Christ and for your liberal distribution unto them and unto all men I know maybe it's written in a little bit of an Old English language and maybe using some heavy heavy phrasing and you could go back and read this in the Amplified Bible or the living Bible and and actually I have a Bible called The Message Bible not the message you're thinking about it's a little bit different but there's ways it's written in more plain English so you could kind of grab a hold of it and recognize what's being said but he's saying that you're giving your liberal distribution your willingness to give to Aid the Believers to support certain causes and to help people in need and I would say this about the church here in all you're given and your Aid to support Believers and their distresses when we take up special offerings and things it causes them to glorify God because they recognize that the Lord has provided for you and so not only is your giving an act of worship and praise to God but it causes others to give Thanksgiving to God and Paul is recognizing that Christians ought to be givers and that in giving you worship God and you glorify God and your generosity and your consistent and given and your happiness and giving and this attitude of a giving believer it just has this resounding praise that's offered unto God and then anybody impacted by that praise and worship then also Echoes out their own Praise And so there's just this thundering chorus of gratitude and Thanksgiving and worship that is offered to God through your giving some of you may not like to sing loud and worship and raise your hands in certain ways and you like to sing movie more quietly and soberly and that's an act of worship and praise and maybe you wish that you could do more to praise God well given is the way of resounding praise and causing others to praise and it's a praise that's unending Jesus touches on it this way in Luke chapter 6 verse 38 give and it shall be given unto you I want you to recognize how that God invites us to give with the promise of a reward if we give for his sake like this is Jesus teaching to be given to be givers give and it shall be given unto you good measure pressed down and shaken together and running over shall men give into your bosom the the the image there is as one would have a cloak and it would have and this cloak could be used to carry something that the whole idea of this grain or these Dry Goods it's referencing the measure of dried Goods being poured into your bosom just how much you'd be able to carry and in this giving give and it shall be given unto you what's going to be given to you so think of it this way whatever you give God you something's going to be given to you and Jesus is saying that this reward for giving is pressed down shaken together and running over it's it's it's if any of you have ever gone somewhere and maybe I don't know if it's Chipotle that you can draw this analogy from but you go and you ask for something you're like boy you really went easy on the meat there pal right like what are we measuring this thing in anymore like just one little fajita thing on the you're like what that ain't three ounces all right we want all our ounces and and you go some places and and you get a you you order a a cup of a green tea and you get it and you look at you like they didn't even fill the cup halfway and and Ryan you've all I got to find some ways for you guys to relate to what I'm saying maybe I should have said coffee and you get your coffee and it's not it's you know half of its foam and once you get all that out it's like hey they shorted me it's exactly what Jesus is referring to he's referring to if you're going to be receiving something you're not going to get cheated or shorted and it's not just going to be in there real fluffy and lightly packed so that it says oh it looked like it was a lot but that once you really started once you got all the ice out of it you had this much iced coffee no he's saying it's going to be pressed down shaken so that everything settles and then running over all right so if you ever packed something with dry goods there's a way you just kind of put it in there be something shaking it settling it get it pressed down make it as much room as you can and then get it to a point where it flows over so that there's no question that whatever measure you wanted you get it and exceed it it's a reference to being given Dry Goods and so it says for with the same measure that you meet out with all shall be measured to you again and I love just how beautifully Jesus instead of encouraging people to give press down shaken together and running over he says just give and it shall be given to you in good measure pressed down and shaken together and running over and so then he says so whatever measure you give at is the measure you'll receive so when we give we want it pressed down shaken together overflowing we want to be generous God is saying uh give and I would even say this give to whatever measure you want to receive from God that's exactly the image that's being expressed in the scripture is what do you expect to receive from God how many of you want 20 from God 30 can I have a 40 50. you want a hundred right we want that's what we want we want a hundred or is it handy is that what we say we want 100. and if that's what you want then you got to give a hundy right you can't just be given 50 and expecting 100. you've got to give it all you got to get a hundred percent and so this is what if whatever measure you want to get back from God and receive from God give to God because it's giving and I just I I think in the scriptures and how they're aligning themselves and and the thought of How It's a praise and an act of Thanksgiving I just want to make reference to this even though I was studying it more on this to bring it out that your act of giving it's an expression of gratitude to God that when you give back to God it's a way of saying hey you know what thank you that's right right and I think there's times when people may give us a gift they give us something and because they gave it to us they're the first person that maybe we allowed to partake in it uh and if someone maybe gives you a gift of food sometimes say Hey you have the first piece or you get the taste it because of the way of showing Thanksgiving and it's an expression of gratitude to God and if I could say this and I hope this really has an impact gratitude the expressing gratitude gratitude is an antidote to insecurity that an expression thing expressing Thanksgiving there's a little bit of vulnerability in that right when you say thank you to somebody else you say thank you you're acknowledging they've done something for you that maybe you that you needed and that was a benefit and so saying thank you is an antidote to insecurity and it's an antidote to this self-serving protection and so if we give if we give and this expression to God and we give unto the Lord it's an act of gratitude and this is an antidote uh to some personal insecurities and things it says in Acts chapter 20 verse 35 I've showed you all things how that so laboring you ought to support the weak and remember the words of the Lord Jesus how he said it is more blessed to give than to receive this is the only place we read this as being attributed to the Lord but somehow Paul knew that Jesus said it's more blessed to give than to receive I believe that he could have gathered that from Luke chapter 6. but it's done as a statement it is more blessed to give than to receive giving is a cure for selfishness it's anecdote to insecurities it's a cure for selfishness it's a guard against greediness that there's a way of hoarding and Gathering and and you're keeping things and you want to keep things and and you want to have it makes it a lot harder to get well I'm trying to reach a certain level and I want to have a certain thing and it's real easy to get stingy and so this act of giving I'm sorry that you guys are getting exhausted with this but this act of giving is a way of of cure making sure that I I'm not always hoarding and I'm not always just self-serving that I do trust the Lord because I'm willing to give because I have this understanding if I give if I give a certain amount he's promised that he's going to make that up press down Shake him together and running over so I shouldn't be fearful to guard against greediness and there's a lot of ways that we can be raised and a lot of things we can experience and have a lot of complexes where we don't ever want to give it could be that way with your emotions and your affections and your and your heart and your time and you don't want to be vulnerable because you've been hurt before and you've been taken advantage of and that can carry over into a lot of areas of our lives so I'm so glad that God provides us a safe way to give and it gives us this opportunity where we can love him without fear of reprisal we can love him without a fear of being unrequited we can serve him without the fear of being abandoned and he gives us this Outlet in this channel where we can be unreserved and unguarded because we're doing it under the Lord and it's such a healing power and a protection even being in the habit of giving increases increases the moderation of your heart's desire right like it's a it's a guard against uh just giving over to certain emotions and being plagued by certain habits in the sermon actually in the question and answers part four this is the question brother Branham has asked when a person realizes he has an inferior complex of some sort of complex how may he overcome this oh this is getting deep or some sort of complex how may he overcome this should it should it be if he was the only child caused this in his early youth I mean there's a lot here right I mean it kind of may be one of those things that when the person put in this question it was read they were going I wonder if he knows if this is about him right because they have somebody in mind somebody in particular I think it might because they're an only child and the only child the people who are in a family and they were the only child maybe there's certain things here you can relate to but it's like if someone has an inferiority complex uh if they're only if they have some sort of habits that have been cultivated since they were a child and an only child how can we handle it brother says take exactly the opposite now and I'm using this in the idea that giving is an expression of your attitude giving moderates hearts desires so if there's a selfishness there if there's a stinginess there if there's a luxury in certain things and we need more moderation that are giving to the Lord and giving to others as a way of moderating that and so brother bam says take exactly the opposite now notice the example he says if you're always wanting your way and that one little brat that wants to always have everything your way well don't sugarcoat it brother bran I'm just I mean what not clear how you feel about this turn right back around and give everything you got the other way all right so if you if you just want everything your way he's saying just turn it right back around the other way if you're selfish and you want to hold everything then start giving away what you got just go vice versa that's the way to overcome anything is an antidote what's an antidote it's a remedy against poison to counteract something and nullifies it and voids its Effectiveness so he's saying that if there's something in us that tends to the greed tends to selfishness tends the wrong way doing the opposite or what would be counter-intuitive to that is the balance or the cure to that and so if there's if there's bad I'll say this and I guess maybe I haven't thought through this uh and so this isn't necessarily stream of Consciousness but if you have bad financial habits began being disciplined in your giving unto the Lord is a start to reigning in bad financial habits and even if it's just because you don't have as much as you used to have to gamble right because now that I'm giving to the Lord I have much less to gamble with and at least you know that's secure and can never be lost right so just even in that effort to say hey I am going to go and I'm going to I want I'm very bad at this and I'm very unrestrained in this or I I make bad decisions financially make the ones that you know are good right and then I can begin to guard against the heuristics in our lives or the biases in our lives that cause us to make bad financial decisions so this is uh this is all related to giving in Matthew chapter 6 verses 19 to 21 lay not up for yourselves Treasures upon Earth where moth and rust doth corrupt and where thieves break through and steal but lay up for yourselves Treasures in Heaven where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt and where thieves do not break through nor steal for where your treasure is there will your heart be also there's for where your treasure is there will your heart be also something because your treasure something becomes your treasure Whenever you set your heart on it it's something that you you set your affections on and you say you value something and that's how that's why some things one man's junk is another man's treasure it's not necessarily because of the inherent value right it's because the affections that are set on it for where your treasure is there will your heart be also it has this uh kind of inversion to it as well and by giving and this is when Jesus is saying lay it not up your Treasures in Heaven by giving whether it be of your money or service or your time giving as God asks we learn to treasure the things of God more because as we give something that is of a value to us to the things of God there's a transfer of affection there's a transfer of attention there's a transfer of value and ownership and when you give is unto the Lord I'd like to say this when you give is unto the Lord that gift is registered in heaven and secure and nothing can devalue that or diminish it as it relates to your giving as unto the Lord through tithes and offerings and support of missions I believe that if you were to give um a thousand dollars to a missionary to support the work of the Lord to buy a motorcycle to evangelize and to build a church and you find out later that they they used it all on something else your gift has not been devalued in the eyes of God your blessing is secure when you give us unto the Lord and you pay your tithes and you pay your offerings there is no detriment to you in your giving if the person who receives it is Unfaithful in their stewardship and that's the security you can have because sometimes we take ownership of it even after we've given it it's like here this is a gift but I want you to use it this way right and these are the qualifications on it and this is how you can use it this way and you can use it that way and then it's kind of like you know what why don't you just keep it because it sounds like you've got all the ideas of how you want to use it right and retaining ownership over it or being able to call it back you haven't really given it right but when you give us unto the Lord Jesus is saying that you're laying up Treasures in Heaven and the stewards of your gift will answer to God for how they use it and it will be upon them their loss and to their detriment how they've handled your voluntary gift so I want you to know that your gift remains pristine and unsullied and perfect in the eyes of God to whatever measure you gave it it remains as treasure stored in heaven to think that even at the Judgment when those who are not even elected to eternal life gave right some Act of service The Eyes Of God nothing nothing after that act of their own accord that they did diminish the value of that act to one of the children of God because they gave and the Lord received it in heaven and it could not be corrupted now for the part you all were waiting for the Old Testament and I want to address this in a little bit different light than we did before the Old Testament law regarding giving was very detailed and compulsory and it's there's a lot of details to it towards since it was a nation it was government there was a union of church and state in Israel right I mean this is there was only one religion there was only one God there was only one temple one place of worship and this was you know this is by nationality by religion it was all unified and Blended so there's a lot of different details and consequences uh that could be held in the Jewish religion but the Old Testament the law was very detailed on giving it was mandatory but yet it still holds a type for us absent some of the same details are the compulsion we looked at it last time I don't know if there's a slide there is there no there's not let me go back I thought maybe I had a slide on this we looked at the three different gifts or offerings or tithes in the Old Testament there's a tithe for the Levites there's a tithe for the annual festivals which is their feast offerings and then there was ties for the poor and we identified that very plainly in scripture the division of offerings that was belonged to the ministry in the Old Testament that belonged to the function of the Tabernacle and the worship and then the offerings that would be given to Aid the stranger the Immigrant and for those who did not have and some of you do you remember that can we go back nine months ago to that time we realized the scripture broke out each one of these tithes and then in Hebrews chapter 10 verse 1 it says for the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of things we could then see in parallel that new testament teaching the New Testament teaching on giving draws from this shadow in the Old Testament that even though it's not following it's strictly the same tithe to the Levites and tie this and all the same percentages and everything being very precise because numbers to where even Jesus and we'll get to in a moment was recognizing that they knew the number that this person ought to give and they measured these things and there was certain omers and ways that they valued what a house ought to be given and what they would need for their house but the law then gives an example of this image a shadow of tithe to the ministry offerings for the church and our gifts to missions and I want to address this not that it would be an elephant in the room and some of you may not even be familiar with this but many argue that tithing is not a new testament principle and that it only applies under the law that under the law and to this church and state Union to the Jews and even in Israel today that they would acknowledge that this only applies to Israel this only applies to those who are under the law and if the law has been superseded by a New Covenant then tithe in is no longer um allowed or tithing is no longer something that God expects from us but it's important to note that tithing or giving an offering to the Lord from your increase originated before the law right and I'll just reference them very quickly in Genesis chapter 4 Cain and Abel made offerings unto the Lord from their increase from their first fruits so it mankind the First Act that we see from mankind post fall so that we can all relate to this isn't Garden of Eden condition this isn't Israelite a covenant tradition this is the condition of Fallen Humanity Abel receives a revelation that God wants first fruits that God wants something reserved for him and praise and worship and as an offering to the Lord and this offering here in Genesis 4 is a gift or a tribute a present something to worship God and so the image of giving of your increase was pre before the law but just uh memorialized and canonized and and ratified in the law like that's where it was just it was put in what God required and what God expected they just put was put in the written law but it wasn't that that's where it started and that's where it ends because in Genesis chapter 14 in the Bible says that Abraham gave him tithes of all to Melchizedek not by law not by compulsion amen but by worship as an act of Thanksgiving he did it so it shows that the the unction to give and the desire to give from what we have is not a legal requirement and it's not something that is inspired by the law but it's something that was prior to the law that God receives and will blast even after the law has been perfected and if you look for the word tithing in the New Testament you won't find it in New Testament teaching of the writers of the letters and some argue that tithing is not in the New Testament uh despite the explicit teaching to get be give to to give and so and you say well where do you learn about this stuff I talk to people I occasionally research and in that you'll find a lot of hot opinions on tithing right a lot of really strong forceful arguments about it's not even god-like it's not even Christian you know anyway it tells you ought to tithe is of the devil and just trying to take advantage of you and um and so there's a there's a real strong opinions in this area and they'll say that it that the New Testament is clear you ought to give you have to give generously they're quick to identify all the places that God says to give and even some of them are even willing to acknowledge that Paul clearly identifies that giving to him and giving to the ministry in feet and giving to the ox that labors and everything is that form of tithing it's the same thing that would be referenced in the Old Testament they said but tithing is not a new testament principle but in Matthew chapter 23 verse 23 this is the only place you'll find tithe in the New Testament I believe and I I say I believe just because I preached a sermon one time and I made the comment that Lot's wife is one of the only women in the Bible that's mentioned in both the Old Testament the New Testament we don't know her name I think it was one of two and then I was done preaching this masterpiece at 21 years old or whatever it's one of my first few sermons and the preacher got up behind me and says we actually do know lot's wife's name and I'm like how did I miss this and he said it was Anita I need a lot and I was like oh okay all right like are you a dad because that sounds like a dad joke and so this um I said I was 21 years old couldn't have been 21. I was older than that but um I definitely wasn't a dad so I didn't get the joke now it's hilarious but it's so in Matthew chapter 23 verse 23 this is an important scripture for us to acknowledge he says woe unto your scribes and Pharisees Hypocrites for you paid tithe of mint and anise and cumin and have omitted the weightier matters of the law judgment mercy and Faith now here's an opportunity for Christ who's magnifying the law to disavow this law this is his opportunity to say but I say unto you don't tithe anymore this is his opportunity to let us know and signal to us as Christians who will be following him in the New Covenant what his attitude is towards tithing and he says these ought you to have done and not leave the other undone so when given an opportunity to explicitly disavow tithing he affirms it and he's saying that you ought to have tithe you ought to have given this you ought to have done and to do the other showing his brother Brenham often does on the subject of tithing and attending church because in a lot of the quotes where he says you should tithe you should go to church he's saying but that doesn't make you a Christian and in one moment I've caused all of you to be like well wait a minute what because there's this other part to it be inoculated first be filled with the Holy Ghost don't and I think we started that in the very beginning we said this is all based upon the understanding that you have been sealed into the kingdom of God and now he wants to set your path straight now he wants to establish your going so having been filled with this Holy Spirit and I'm not doing this to make myself a Christian I'm doing this because I am a Christian I'm not doing this to be a beneficiary of God's grace I'm doing this as a recipient of God's grace then this is something we do so he's saying that this is this giving now is I I am not doing this to make myself a Christian I'm not doing this to just check the box Jesus saying but you ought to do it because it's required of you to pay tithe and to do all these other things these things you ought to have done not just do the one and leave the other undone now the argument is that this very statement the scriptures before the institution of the New Covenant now how many can just very easily recognize the danger in doing that he affirmed tithing before the institution of the New Covenant I would say it's ill-advised because everything he taught that practically was before the institution of the New Covenant so I say wow this is before he died and rose again this is before his Spirit was sent back then it kind of just gives us this white out that we can begin to use over so many things that Jesus taught that were before the institution of the New Covenant and if you lean that way it becomes a means of rejecting any teaching of Christ prior to his death and Resurrection so when it comes to the law then Jesus says in Matthew 5 17 think thought that I'm come to destroy the law or the prophets I'm come to I'm come not to just I am not come to destroy but to fulfill so he's not come just to tear down the law and destroy it but to give it to make sense of it to fill it up to place it to give it purpose he came not to take the law and destroy it but what did Paul do in Romans and Hebrews he it made sense of the law it made sense of the sacrifices and the arrangement of the temple it all began to make sense once Christ came that these were all shadows and pre-figures and so Christ didn't come to abolish the law destroy the law we often say that he came and magnified the law in Matthew chapter 6 and The Sermon on the Mount he addresses six different Old Testament laws I say unto you Thou shalt is said unto you before time thou shall not kill and then what do you say hey if you if you even uh if you say something the wrong way and speak against your brother and you call him a fool you're in danger of Hellfire if said before thou shall not commit adultery but if any man look upon a woman to lust after he has committed already what did Jesus do he didn't abolish the law he found the intent and the spirit of the law because the Jews could be very good at technical compliance but their heart being far from God so in other words Paul Jesus breaks this down if you go and read the sermon on the mountain you read all these references to the laws read it this way that Jesus is eliciting the spirit of the law not just the letter so you read the letter of the law he's saying now what I want you to see Jesus in other words he's saying that he's opening up and revealing the intent of the law the real meaning of the law in other words Jesus is saying this law was not meant to for technical compliance but it's meant to address our hearts and our actions so the letter of the law we may say is abolished but the spirit of the law survives there's some things in law that we don't we don't apply by letter and Jesus acknowledging this says it has been said before Thou shalt not do this thou shall not do this or Thou shalt do this and as much as the law was going to transition and change into Grace Jesus saying the spirit of the law survives under grace and as one of the one of the things you'll find in what Jesus addresses is he never addresses the law of tithing because it wasn't even an issue it wasn't even debated there was no question they're so explicit under the law the teaching of it and the reasons for it and the meaning behind it but one thing we can say for sure there's absolutely zero New Testament teaching that rejects the law of tithing so now it it kind of had come to our home stretch to finish here and I appreciate your attentiveness despite the the fluctuation of the temperature uh you there it's not because we have the heat on because we broke the thermostat and the heat don't work so I know it's not because well unless the all of a sudden it's working uh but uh I'd like to ask this question to you then or maybe this begs the question well then how is the New Testament giving and teaching the New Testament giving different from the Old Testament and and I want to look at it in one regard that under the Old Testament law there are penalties for not tithing so there was a direct consequence explicit consequence in the Old Testament when God gave the law to Israel there was direct consequences if they did not give in their annual tithes their ties for Levites their ties for the feast offerings their tithes for the poor just go to Deuteronomy 26 27 28 and just look at all the curses and punishments that are given for not obeying the law and God is basically saying if you do not make Commandments this is what's going to happen to you the Malachi picks it up Malachi chapter 3 verses 8 9 will a man rob God and how is it they robbed him in their tithes and offerings you have yet Rob yet you have robbed me but you say where and have we robbed the in tithes and offerings and because of that these are the words of the Lord you are cursed with a curse for you have robbed me even this whole nation now this is under the law and this is to Israel that in their failure to pay tithes and offerings they are cursed because their failure to pay tithes and offerings robbed god of what he legally required under the law but then God brings out the other part and Malachi didn't want to spend too much attention on this but try me give and this is not just a matter of me not cursing you I'll pour out a blessing upon you that you cannot contain because that's the real emphasis that God had in the law to begin with is honor the Lord with your substance honor him with your increase and your barns will be full and your wine press is overflowing just give and I'm going to give this is God God loves a cheerful Giver just give but there was consequences under the law and there was a curse that they failed to give and Jesus did what Paul teaches us in Galatians that Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law so I believe in having studied the message I do not find anywhere where brother Branham is using the explicit language that you better tithe or you'll be cursed but he does say that if you give try me try me this is a blessing this is a promise that comes with the blessing this is God saying try me I will pour out a blessing that you cannot contain and I would say but the blessing remains under grace and is established in the New Testament teaching as we've already seen and I'll say this and this may come as a relief to a lot of you as a church there is no mechanism to enforce tithing or punish those who don't right why did you wait till 11 45 to tell us this there's just there's just no way there's there's no mechanism this church doesn't have it and when I say that there's no I don't have I don't have the right to for intimidation or or to make you feel ashamed that's not my right and I'll and and you hold me accountable if I ever try to shame you in doing something for God call me out on it because I don't have that right just don't have it try to bully you intimidate you make you feel uncomfortable use what we call the the spirit has always been there and the actions have always been there but now it has new label of cancel culture churches have practiced canceled culture before the politicians ever figured it out we were the we invented it Christians invented cancel culture and so we've experienced it in the message in Christianity how quickly we can ostracize somebody and kick somebody out when they don't align with us exactly the way we want them to this church doesn't have that ability we simply do not have at our disposal enforcement mechanisms and ways of punishing people who don't pay their tithes truthfully I would say that in some ways that we we count on your disclosure when you give your offerings and you give your tithes to give you a receipt at the end of the year and to know who's giving tithes but there's no means by which we can access the you know your your yeah send a I guess legally I could probably figure out some way to Garner your wages right and and legally I have to have 10 of his salary so hey you know sorry Joel but you know whenever your employer calls me I'm like um I have this uh subpoena here to Garner 10 of his wages and you know just like Hey listen you guys object to vaccines on a religious basis why not let us as a church take 10 of your grows for religious reasons right think about it I think we're getting somewhere with this today now we don't have that means of auditing so if you whatever you give you're the one that knows that you're giving generously giving consistently given from the as to the Lord we don't have a means of getting your income tax statements unless you want to run for public office we just won't see them we won't be able to verify it so you there's nothing in this church where we have some mechanism that they had in the Old Testament to be able to enforce this giving brother Brown even answers it this way and God being misunderstood he's asked this question can a Christian go to heaven if he or she does not pay tithe I could not say yes or no to that it's a very good very good answer he says but I do I do believe that every Christian is obligated to pay tithings because it is a commandment of the Lord and blessed are they that do all his Commandments that they might have a right to enter into the life the tree of life now what an amazing connection he just makes now I do believe that tithe pain is essential to a Christian experience you'll find that this Echoes his sentiments from 47 to 65. he echoed the sentiment over and over and over again but when asked about whether or not it would keep somebody out of the kingdom of God he says I couldn't say yes or no to that why because there's a whole lot more to it than just paying your tithes a whole lot more to it and what brother Branham identifies is that the failure to give limits God's blessings now you're saying Hey give it's a commandment and you'll have this right there's a blessing that comes with it and we do recognize and I want to address this very quickly before we try to wrap this up that that the only consequence of your giving is if you limit your giving or don't give at all then it can limit your ability to be a blessing to people you limit your ability to be a blessing to church limit your ability to serve limit your ability to participate limit the the blessing that you are to other people because this is I share this as the standard that we hold at this church and the placing of deacons brother remember says in the church are those because he's talking about placing of deacons he says and the church are those who come and support the church with their presence with their tithes and offerings and he says those are the ones that have a legal say so in the voting of or in the placing of such or deacons so those who attend church regularly and those that pay their tithes and offerings are the ones who have a right to vote on the placing of deacons and trustees in any office that would be voted for he comes back to it later when he's actually wanting the vote he says every member of this church that comes here regular and supports it with your tithe and offerings which is considered a member of this church and so this is what's required to vote so you say well is there a penalty for not paying tithes or offerings then this is not necessarily a penalty but it's a lack of privilege that those that attend regularly and pay their tithes and offerings they are the ones that are given the opportunity to vote and I would say this is what we require as a church to vote and it's very beautiful that if you would be that's what's required to vote that's the requirement to hold an office right that's what's required to serve in a official capacity and maybe the Lord will give me opportunity maybe it's in the month of February we'll start talking about the next level because everything we're talking about now is just entry level the entry level requirements these are things that we all must be doing if you've had a new birth experience you attend church regularly you pay your tithes and offerings you support missions you sanctify your home you gather around the world you live for others you're putting yourself position then to go to the next level because those first seven that's what every believer has that's what every believer does but then you have this opportunity for your own particular gifts and your own particular callings and the Very things that God wants to do in your life though that's when you have an opportunity to move into Ministry move into service and move into other areas where God wants to take these special unique gifts that you have and use them for his glory and that's the best way for them to be used the best way for your gift to be a curse to you and to others is to not have these other seven in your life and try to use it and I know some of you seen it there's some people that don't go to church unless they going to be playing an instrument or don't go unless they're preaching or singing or something and they only show up when they want to serve but they don't have these other disciplines and habits in their lives and it only limits the effectiveness of this beautiful gift they have because giving shows support demonstrates a confidence and Trust not just not just in the church you're a part of but in God and consistent giving demonstrates faithfulness brother Branham the sermon let us see God he says I feel like this that a member of a church their first obligation is with their tithe and offerings is to support their Church if you're members of These Fine churches that's represented here you support your church that's your first duty to God something brother Branham is consistent and mentioned over and over and over again support your church that's your first duty to God because if you're not if you're not attending service regularly and I apologize if me saying these things you say well that really goes without saying brother Aaron you don't need to say it I just feel compelled to say it that in these things that not doing these things could indicate a lack of faith like why why does why do some people not participate in feet washing and communion it could be a lack of faith why don't they attend church regularly why don't they go to church it could indicate a lack of faith or it could show a lack of confidence or an unwillingness to support so these are things that at least it begs the question right like well it's not fair to say just because I never go to church and never pay my tithes I don't support you it's like well you could at least forgive me if I thought that right I don't come to church because I don't like you brother Ernest I don't like Christ I'm like oh okay I feel better now not really but it really does indicate a lack of support or lack of faith does that not make sense and so if you're looking for people who have common vision and common goals and wanting to support something and support a cause and and and you feel that love and that we're in this together and whatever challenges come up when all this need is arising you know there's other like-minded people you can bind together and you can share one another's family there's such a a a there's such a confidence that comes when someone indicates faith in the word of God by being obedient to his word and then support for the things of God where you're laboring by doing the same thing brother Brandon the sermon why and I actually think I know this one is from from Phoenix and the last one may actually have been or one of these other ones may have been in Phoenix he says but I believe that every person should join the church I absolutely believe that every person should stand at their post of Duty when their pastors there preaching or evangelist or something I think they ought to stand at their post of Duty they so if uh if it's whether it's me preaching or a visiting minister or another minister of the part of our body is preaching we consider this our post of Duty in other words if the pastor is not preaching you're not relieved of your post to duty you don't all of a sudden freelance now you're all welcome to visit other churches and I love it that our church has that Liberty to visit and some of you are uh do more uh more regularly have places you visit and you show support and you have that Liberty to go to meetings um there's even people who aren't here this morning I believe that are visiting other churches and showing that uh that that kindness I think it's beautiful I think it's great I think it's great if we have that testimony as Believers is that we can fellowship and we can have harmony with other people and and we could find some common ground and but yet there's still this sense that it should never be that oh well if the pastor is not preaching our loyalties then are we can be anywhere we want there should always be this thought in our heart that this is my that's where I belong this in its home because that's where I end up back when I'm done visiting but he says support that church with everything they have to stand to positive they ought to support that church with everything that got in them with their ties with their offerings with anything that they're called on to do be willing and happy it says if your pastor asks you to do something in your church you should do it that's good all right everybody write that down here comes the ask I'm learning to be a Salesman right there's got to be an ask I'm just kidding I'm a horrible salesman I can't even return a steak you know that hasn't been cooked right because I just I'm really backwards about them like Elizabeth say something tell him my steak's overcooked I'd I would be poor if I had to rely on sales I just can't I can't do the ask but be well and happy if your pastor asks you to do something in church you should do it that's good I believe that this I think this indicates if I could just kind of wrap it up the Old Testament had explicit curses and punishments I believe the Old Testament is just full of blessing and privilege that if you give God will bless you and measure to what you give and it opens up Privileges and opportunities you otherwise don't have the otherwise that you wouldn't even be given except for your participation in God's economy and that these things show what side you're on and who and not necessarily that your loyalty is into a particular manner to a church but that this is your your loyalties to God and this is what God would expect of you and so I believe that the Bible teaches us to be consistent happy generous givers as unto the Lord and we do that in part through our tithes and offerings it says in first Timothy 6 18 and I'm closing here with just two more scriptures so that they do good after this there's only two more so three if you include this one that they do good that they be rich in Good Works ready to distribute willing to communicate policy and be free givers ready to give and not cleaving to possessions that if you have if you have and God gives and have some sense of that I'm willing to give of what I've been given Paul said I I will gladly spend and be spent and what we have we have from the Lord our position sister Elizabeth and I are our vision and our position here is uh in this church and our leadership in the church is that whoever God sends here we take full responsibility in serving them and and looking out after them spiritually and praying for them and willing to provide in whatever way that we possibly can we're willing to spend and be spent but we take no ownership such that if God would take them and move them on they go with our blessing and there is no loss and there's not we have not been deprived because we never owned them to begin with and that Believers here have absolute autonomy and Liberty to serve God as they would see fit and if they feel led to move and God moves them then though there could be some sense of loss and sorrow in our heart that's not what we own and it's not our possession so even in that we are willing to give that others could be blessed and I could say that about everyone here that if God would lead you to attend another assembly I could say they are going to be blessed and we have a part in it because we ought to be free givers even as a church I found it interesting as I studied all these that God get God could have required giving in the New Testament under the New Covenant as compulsory mandatory and explicit even to a certain amount could have done it but what God did is he allowed it to be done of your own free will it's written that way and it's remarkable as I studied and I studied the message and Brother Band is very forceful on it he's very particular and then I read the I read the Old Testament and I read the New Testament and I find that God is very clear that you ought to be givers and and some argue that there's no such thing as a cash uh cash giving or giving of money and it's like I guess they don't believe the Old Testament either because in the Old Testament there was always the means by which you could give through cash and so I think we've even read it before how there was those who could not have and partake and provide through some sort of substance could actually give of their money and the the money that they would have or the assets of currency that they would have they could give there's even a Leviticus that if you is the law is so amazingly detailed that if you are required to tithe a certain percentage of your grain you could actually buy back your offering redeem it by paying a percentage of it so if the value was a thousand dollars and that's what you owed in actual grain if you needed to keep that grain you could buy it for like twelve hundred dollars and and that would count as an offering so the whole idea that offerings and uh givings and first fruits is not meant to be cash in the Bible or even in the New Testament is just uh I believe it's it's just the wrong interpretation of scripture but God wants us to give of our own free will and but there's some if he could I believe God requires it but he doesn't make it mandatory if you I may I don't know if I'm saying it maybe the right way he could have made it by force he could have made it legally but he does it to be done of your own free will and so as your pastor I encourage you to give of your own free will as generously as you are able and to the Lord and I want to close with this in second Corinthians chapter eight I wanted to maybe make this part of our um our text and teaching but I just want to refer to this part so much more in here that could be um referred to he says therefore is ye abound in everything in faith and utterance and knowledge and in all diligence and he's talking about the Macedonian example of giving and the love uh the the love that Titus has for the Corinthian Church and so he's using the the example of others giving to encourage the Corinthians to likewise be givers he says as you have abounded everything in faith and utterance and knowledge and all diligence and in your love to us see that you abound in this Grace also and the grace he's talking about is in giving as you abound in these other things abound in this so that you may prove that your love is real and it goes beyond mere words he says I speak not by commandment but by occasion of the forwardness of others and to prove the sincerity of your love so he's asking them I can't compel You by law I'm not speaking this by commandment but I'm saying you're so faithful in these all these other areas why don't you abound in this Grace also by being givers so they may prove Your Love he says for you no and then it gives this example for you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ that though he was rich yet for your sakes he became poor that ye through his poverty might be rich do we not say that for God so loved the world he gave his only begotten son have any of you ever just thought about how God could have dealt with our sins I mean could he not have just said okay they're gone I mean he's God he orchestrated all this but yet God is one who makes himself known to the actions of others that it's just part of his essential character that if God wants to be a blessing to someone here and he's really wanting to bless you we could almost to 100 say that he's going to use somebody to do that there's going to be some means there's going to be some action there's gonna be somebody if somebody needs a burden bore then there's going to be somebody's going to do something to bear that burden so it's going to come through somebody's actions Brother Bear talks about a Revival he says the reason why we've had these healings and the reason why we've had the move of God such we have and he and he pulls back a curtain says because this person praying here where he talks about this person sitting there around a campfire praying all night and it's the act of that one person is what brought the Revival and you think well if God wants to have a Revival can't he just have a Revival if God wants to bless me can it just be poof it's there but even when it came to atoning for our sins God himself gave he gave and Jesus Christ himself gave and became poor that we might be rich therefore it necessitates that in order for God's generosity and God's love and God's charity and his love even for you and for others has to be expressed through us our overt actions and we prove that God's love is real when we abound in disgrace also and Paul's specifically talking about giving and then he says this and this is I'm closing on this thought and so as far as our preaching part we've just been about an hour and 15 minutes it says a second Corinthians chapter 8 verse 15 now as it is written he that had gathered much had nothing over and he that had gathered little Had No Lack almost reads like a riddle go back and read it in the scripture the miracle in Exodus 16 18. it was in the Gathering of manna and they went out to gather the manna and it says in that verse 18 essentially this he that gathered much had nothing over and he that gathered little little Had No Lack think about that Paul is using this this miracle to get the attention of the Corinthians as he continues in chapter nine and there's so much uh so much in here that he's expressing to them about giving and giving and giving and the if you even followed the track of Paul uh in his teaching it's the giving part that builds even to the weapons of our Warfare and how God is uh and and having discernment about false teaching and different things it's a critical part of Christianity and he uses this phrase this scripture this miracle of collecting the Manna and so the what happened in Exodus chapter 16 is the the Omar that was required and the the measure that each man needed to feed his family he's saying that as they in the scripture when they went out and gathered there was people who gathered a lot and they seem to have so much abundance and there was people who went out and gathered much smaller amounts but when they went to measure them each one had the exact amount they needed for what was required and this was a miracle only God could do this because people are out there trying to get and grab and have as much as they can and then oh wow look at how much he has well let me measure this it's like he doesn't have one piece of Mana more than what he needed to defeat his family and the one that got just a little bit it wasn't like oh man you're short you needed more no he had just as much as he needed for what he had so whether they had gathered a little they had just enough for what they needed whether they had gathered a lot they had just enough for what they needed and if I could say it to you this way based upon the miracle in Exodus 16 and upon this this example of Christian giving in second Corinthians chapter 8 that God has ordained for us a certain measure a certain measure of increase and a certain level of joy that this is what God has ordained for us and beyond that you will not find happiness this miracle of the Manna is what it teaches us that when a man gathered the miracle was that all that he gathered was what he need whether little or a lot and so what we gather and what we have beyond what you need will not bring you happiness and so if there's a measure of increase in a measure of Joy if you're always trying to get beyond that that's when you're going to feel a little less satisfied because whenever we keep or whatever we keep Beyond those measures and whatever we try to attain Beyond those measures it'll not only satisf not only will it not satisfy but it'll cause us to be uneasy it'll cause our emptiness and sometimes we express feelings of emptiness and dissatisfaction because we feel that we don't have enough but sometimes it's because we've tried to keep too much and what we've kept does not give us the satisfaction that we need and the only way that you'll achieve the stasis achieve the joy and achieve the sense of satisfaction is when you give enough to balance the measure does that make sense that God has ordained for us a measure of increase he's ordained that he has this way of saying that this is what you ought to have this is what you need and when we have The Sensational appetite to keep beyond what we need that's what actually causes the more to become a negative and cause us to be less satisfied and why is it when I was making this much money I was happier when my income was exponentially increased is because you're trying to use it for your own purposes in hoard it for your own purposes and that'll never make a Christian more happy because be gone beyond what God measures for us will never make us happy and whatever we keep Beyond it will never satisfy but actually cause emptiness so I encourage you as a church to be givers give us unto the Lord be willing be happy be generous from A Generous Heart and I promise you the Lord will bless you thank you for your patience today musicians you could come we can all Stand Together
