TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Acts chapter 16 veres 1 to5 and uh pretty remarkable story as I was studying it this week um and I think it'll be a blessing to you just these few verses Acts chapter 16 verse1 then came he to Derby and lra and behold a certain disciple was there and he's speaking of Paul and this is actually Luke writing so he has a very unique way of uh expressing certain details and behold a certain disciple was there named Timothy the son of a certain woman which was a Jewish and believed but his father was a Greek which was well reported of the of by the Brethren there that were at lra and Iconium him would Paul have to go forth with him and took and circumcised him because of the Jews which were in those quarters for they knew all that his father was a Greek and as they went through the cities they delivered them to the decrees for Te keep that were ordained of the Apostles and Elders which were at Jerusalem and so were the churches established l in the faith and increased in number daily let's bow our heads and pray our gracious Heavenly Father Lord we are standing in your divine presence today there's those that would look at us and say I think you're mistaken you're standing in a hotel conference room but Lord we believe that we're in your presence we believe that we as your sons and daughters come boldly before the throne of grace though we do not enter into a physical hall pass down Regal corridors or stand within a palatial throne room but yet we believe that we stand before the almighty and that we come before you with a heart uh full of faith and Assurance knowing that you're rewarder and that father having diligently sought you we could ask and not ask a Miss Lord I pray that you bless the many that have gathered this evening you know the unique circumstances that they've uh departed from this evening to be here you know the circumstances that await them you know the anxieties that they hold the trials that they endure and I pray that you would bless them and strengthen them and encourage them Lord there's no desire of condemnation or judgment upon them Lord we just desire that your will would be done that you would lift them up give them those things that they have need of and may we be willing to acknowledge that it's in your word Lord there's provision so father we ask that you bless the word which we have read the time that we spent together around your word we commit all things to you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen may be seated I'm continuing on the subject that we began last week uh true family no filter and uh I actually thought that maybe I'd opened up a little bit of a can of worms by using a hashtag in a mixed audience and uh maybe it would be more appropriate for a youth meeting but we're using that hashtag to uh uh in conjunction with true family and it's a social media uh tool we're utilizing it to address misconceptions when it comes to family and when you say we want to speak on a family and then we even use this statement where brother brandham says that this masterpiece family husband and wife All In Harmony in agreement and love and then makes a statement you know all true family here portrays that and so we ask ourselves well are we really a true family uh and then so it kind of puts this sets this bar for family relationships family Dynamics and even the image that our family is in and how we live our lives and how this is expressed and manifested to others and so we're using this hasht tag no filter to kind of deal with some of the misconceptions we make about ourselves misconceptions we make about teaching some of the conclusions that we draw and to use a hashtag which would be uh you know a pound sign or a sharp symbol in music and uh you know maybe different ways that you might look at it but to use that in the context I'm using it is it's used uh basically as a a way to label a post label a picture label content that's posted to many different uh forums or or different ways of disseminating information and it allows for searching you can search by hashtag it allows for connecting certain topics or getting people's attention organize certain things or to promote things and so it's something you would use on your Instagram account if you wanted to invite everybody to church you'd say uh we're having church Sunday at 10:00 a.m. at the Courtyard by Marriott and say hash having fun or something like that and people who want to have fun could search that hashtag and sister Elizabeth I I came up with a hashtag for Gettysburg a few years ago hashtag never gets old because you just you go and it's always beautiful you always enjoy it so just kind of a way of of modifying something or or amending something and so that's what it's that's what its use is and I didn't want to mislead anybody wanted to kind of throw that out there that maybe there's some actual utility within uh the social media context but then this phrase no filter hash no filter is used when posting photos and to give the impression or at least suggest that the image itself has not been manipulated or changed in any way so I took this picture this Sunset is exactly what you're scene is what hit the lens and if it looks beautiful that's compliments to the camera it's compliments to the photographer it's compliments to the framing and the lighting and everything that they were able to achieve naturally without using a filter to enhance certain colors or or photoshop to get rid of certain people say this is just raw this is what it is and so to say true family # no filter it conveys the idea that that I'm challenging you as an individual to not create a carnal image of what a family is supposed to be in other words brother Brown makes a statement oh well then I guess my family has to be this way and since my family can't be this way then I guess I can't I can't be a true family or or uh any kind of teaching you just kind of draw this conclusion it can only be this way and since it has to be this way and I don't fit the mold then even what's being taught isn't relevant to me so you can take uh certain things that are said and then filter it and create the wrong kind of picture and then also we're challenging us as individuals to not try to filter our lives and just use something artificial to gain a particular expression but just let the Lord live through me I want it to be authentic I want to be genuine I want him to be working from the inside out and just be who I am and there was a number of different statements that we used to express that and we took this statement from the Masterpiece how the brother bam is saying a true family is a picture of Harmony and love then if that's the picture of a true family I don't want to carnally grab a hold of that picture and then fabricate a representation of that image whether to wrestle with the teaching or to try to produce that in my own life and if we do that if we filter things the wrong way and I pondering a lot on brother bram's teaching on a thinking man's filter and how that there's a proper filter that we ought to use and there there's a way that we ought to filter things from the world and we have that word filter but then the word we we don't filter it through our own ideas we don't filter it through man's understandings we just take the word raw we just let it come we let Faith grab a hold of it and so if we use a filter on certain things then what it does is it creates a pressure and we were using this in light of just the phen social media phenomena it it puts a pressure to achieve a visual Perfection I want my family to look the part I want I want my as a couple we want to looked AP part we want everything to be in order and so we kind of have this pressure to always have visual Perfection or maybe we're even pursuing the wrong image it has to be this way it must look this way and so it creates pressure and then not only can It create pressure but it can create paralysis and uh and I guess I'm speaking to everybody who's always motivated but there's times when the pressure Rams up but instead of getting a job done you get paralyzed there's so much pressure you can't get anything done and then it happens to all of us and some of us are overachievers and some of us are very ambitious and some of us have never had a sad day in our lives and we get out of bed and we just start knocking down the to-do list but there's times in our lives for some people that we can be so overwhelmed that even if we don't have a lot to do we get paralyzed and we can't do anything and so the wrong kind of filter the wrong kind of expectations the wrong kind of understanding of teachings and scriptures and quotations can not only produce pressure but it can produce a paralysis where you just can't even do anything and you can't go forward and so I'd like to just connect the things that we were speaking on on Sunday with what we spoke last Wednesday and say at its foundation or if you just boiled it down to a basic or its single most important component the true family is one that puts God first and if you're doing that if you're doing that at whatever level of Faith you have if you're doing that in whatever circumstance you're in if you're doing that in the in the path that you're presently in that's the most that you could ask from somebody you can see some individuals that are very far down the road in their walk with God and we use the the idea of hike your own hike and you see somebody who's serving the lord and surrendering to God and they have many years of experience and they could be at a particular place in their walk with God and here you're just starting out you're just starting your journey to begin to compare yourself to somebody at that stage can produce discouragement but if you're putting God first if you're walking in the light that he's shown you that's really all that you can do and so true family is one that puts God first the word is first we want Christ to have preeminence and we use the scripture we use the story of the Widow of Zar F on Sunday morning and how that here she was caught in this scene of Elijah's Ministry and a time of famine and she was out grabbing two sticks to make bread for her and her son and then they were going to die and Elijah comes and says get me water and she instinctively went I'm going to go get him water and he says and also make me a cake and she said I'm being honest with you I was getting ready to go make a cake one last meal for me and my son and we were going to die because that's all we have left is a little bit of Mill and a little bit of oil and Elijah said I tell you what make me one first and then one for you and your son and she did exactly that and by at the word of the Prophet she had provision and she was sustained and it said in First Kings chapter 17:9 arise get ye to zerath which belongeth to ziden and dwell there behold I have commanded I have appointed I have ordained a widow woman there to sustain thee and the simple image I wanted to draw from this though we view her as a widow and we view it with somewhat of a distance this story being thousands of years old to us I want just to kind of take it and unfilter it but look at it within its context and realize that this was a single mother here she she's a single mother she was a victim of circumstance and she's not the image that we imagine a true family to be in like who would be worthy to sustain the messenger who would be worthy to be identified with Elijah who would be worthy cuz God told him go and dwell there and they figure it was about 2 years that he dwelt with this family and we say well the prophet he's got to stay with royalty he's got to stay with somebody of a particular status and it's got to be this situation or that situation but this is who God chose a single mother was appointed by God to preserve the prophet and his ministry this is who God chose a woman in unfortunate circumstance he chose her and she was going to want be the one that had the initial resources that God could use and now her testimony is great and we're encouraged by her testimony and we we gain uh great comfort in seeing the hand of God but I want you to look at it in that sense that maybe just looking at it optically we'd say well this is a single woman we don't know the exact circumstances of how her husband died but here she is a mother of a child she's uh maybe we could take exception that she hasn't been able to manage the meal well and manage the oil and she's given up and she thinks she's going to die but this is who God chose say man this woman was a mess but God said I've ordained her I've commanded her and brother Bram said she put God before her children she put God before anything else she taken the kingdom of God first and really that's all that we can do that that's the first thing that we must do is individually now uh we talk about families but what makes up a family individuals it's not this body that we kind of melt into and we lose our individuality but it's something that individually we must do we must put the word first Christ must have preeminence in our individual lives because if not the family unit isn't some Dynamic that overcomes all other Dynamics as an individual we have to take our place as an individual we operate within the dynamic of the family and so just to by way of trying to summarize some of the things that have been burdened my heart last Sunday uh last Wednesday but then just to kind of marry it with putting God first and and seeking him first and family not being greater than the word of God I want to say in this context that as a woman she as just as an individual she could not change her past and I might just maybe chasing this idea for the remainder of the service all she could do she couldn't change her past all she could do is just set the word before her as her aim all she could do is she could she could tell she could tell the prophet well my husband died and and this person took advantage of me and I had someone break into my home and steal my meal and and the first batch of oil I got was spoiled and and she could have just had a whole bunch of explanations to them and really there's nothing you could do there's nothing she could do about her past be relevant to understand her situation and give context but her if she's going to place her faith on anything she couldn't Place her hope in that her past would change but she could put her faith in a path towards change she could look she could put the word before her as her future and just go forward and I was pondering it this week and I just and even last week I was like my there's just so many different examples you can use when you put it in this context but really the Bible as you read from Genesis to Revelation it gives us an unfiltered story of redemption it just gives it to us just exactly the way it is and uh and you read of different ones and why I mean it seems like the story about Tamar I mean maybe they could have just put it in a little bit different context uh but yet you read that story you're like okay this is it's getting real and then you read in other places you're like oh my goodness could they just I mean brushed over that but God allowed the writers of the Old Testament and even the New Testament to kind of just give to us the way that it was and it was written that way to give us hope we read about somebody like David who's a man after God's Own Heart and we read about his failures and his weaknesses and what he goes through and it's done not so that we could justify ourselves but it's done to give us hope as human beings that there's Redemption out of our mistakes there's Redemption from a horrible past and that even God can use a Tamar can use a Rahab can use a bath Sheba in the very lineage of Jesus Christ and so the Bible is really an unfiltered Raw Story of redemption and you think that if we're going to sit down and write a book we try to cover this and cover that make everything match but God allowed it to come forward in a way to give us confidence that the same God who made the promise is the same God who's working in our lives because none of us have a perfect narrative so what has God done in the Bible he's preserved mistakes and blemishes and even the failures of his people for our edification and so I believe that it's an encouragement to us because God would not write that so that we could make M uh make mistakes and then justify them and listen there's a there's a there's a way that God wants to comfort us and there's a way that God wants to redeem us from our mistakes and encourage us about a path forward in our failures and the things in our past but there comes a point where we can no longer just wallow in the past and our complexes and what somebody else did to us there's a point where God's going to say hey it's time to move forward I've given you a promise for that I've given you examples of that I've touched you I've done something for you and you could see that Moses would be an example of that God trains him for years establishes uh vindicates his ministry establishes his presence with Moses and it finally got to a point of God nurturing him through all these years he finally said hey stop crying just speak and thank God that's not what he did in the beginning and that's not what he does to us in the beginning but I mention that now to say if we're looking at um our Brokenness if we're looking at weaknesses and failures and mistakes and saying hey you can't change your past let's go forward I don't want to phrase it in such a way to ref feel that you can always play that card or call back on well I was abused as a child or well I've never sat uh I've never had this opportunity and this has happened and that's happened and kind of always use as an excuse for where you are now that it's because of my past I am where I am now but rather take it as God gives you a Grace God knows those things God will deal with those things and then at some point using the momentum of God vindicating his presence in your life say Lord I can go forward from this I'm not going to be a prisoner to my past I'm not going to be a prisoner to mistakes that I've made so regardless of the situation God can take our Brokenness God can take our mistakes and make something beautiful out of it it's remarkable he's the only one that can do it only God could say I can work all things and not qualify it to the good so looking at this in Acts chap 16: 1 to5 and we'll kind of read through this uh just wasn't sure exactly how to attack it so I just have the scriptures before me and it's speaking of Paul and Silas and they come to uh uh Derby and Lyra and behold a certain disciple was there named timotheus and this is Timothy and it says he's a disciple so he was already believing and it says he was the son of a certain woman now that's remarkable that they want to identify who he is and he was the son of a certain woman and it seems to be a peculiar phrase uh we would we would just assume he was the son of a certain woman and not just a bunch of women but it's phrased this way to give us this idea that this woman was significant or report there was something about her that uh that Luke is alluding to and it says which was a Jewish so she was Jew a Jew and she believed so now think about Timothy now this Timothy we're talking about is the one that Paul writes later Paul says you're like a son to me and this is the one that Paul establishes as one that's going to take the church forward and says many many complimentary things to him and says many things to Timothy that um are so well you could just say they were so important for us to understand that God memorialized these letters to Timothy in the scripture as instructive to us so now this is Timothy's life now his mother was a Jew and she believed so she was a Jew that had become a Christian so it says and believed this is a Jew that's converted to Christianity but his father was a Greek so we know his father was not a Jew which was well reported of by the Brethren that were at lra and Iconium so maybe his testimony the conversion of his mother and the fact that his father was not a Believer him would Paul have to go forth with him this is the one that Paul chose to travel with him become an understudy to become a student and took and circumcised him because of the Jews which were in those quarters for they knew all that his father was a Greek kind of now feels like Luke's trying to make a point I don't know if you caught this the first time but his dad was a Greek I don't know if you caught this the first time but his dad was a gentile wasn't a Believer and as they they went through the cities now Timothy's a part of this they delivered them the decrees for to keep that were ordained of the Apostles and Elders which are at Jerusalem and now Timothy this believer and so were the churches established in the faith and increased in number daily this is part of the ministry that Timothy's called to and begins to engage in now if we look at it as it's presented here in the scripture Timothy has a very unique family structure and let's just look at it for what it is he's the product of a mixed marriage between a Jew and a gentile his mother was a Jew his mother was a Believer but he was not raised a Jew because Paul now has him circumcised so here he's the son of a Jew and the son of a gentile so he's in a mixed he's in a mixed family one's one's a Jew of the faith of the Jews one that would was called that God was sent the Messiah to and you see that she has followed uh uh his mother has followed in this pattern of of conversion from being a Jew to being a Christian but then the dad he he he remains unconverted so Timothy comes you say maybe a mixed family not maybe a broken family in the sense that there being a separation but here's the mom who's a Believer the dad who's an unbeliever and the son becomes a Believer and a follower of Christ and Paul chooses him to go with him into the field into Ministry and becomes a very Dynamic figure in the New Testament and so if you look at his family situation he's not coming from the Upper Crust he doesn't have the pedigree that maybe sometimes we require of certain people when we come in contact with with them in the message here he is coming from this this situation now this is how that is how the Luke wrote it but then Paul may be KNN a little bit more about the situation says it this way in 2 Timothy chapter 1 Excuse Me 2 Timothy 1:5 says when I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith the sincere faith that is with thee now notice how Paul begins to identify and amplify this Faith Timothy you have a sincere Faith you have a genuine faith and this faith that is with the first dwelt or dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois in thy mother Eunice and I'm persuaded that it's in thee also that in thee also so Paul once again now Luke was quick to point out the fact that his father was a Greek we've heard it twice Paul just kind of Skips over it Paul doesn't even mention it and it's suggesting that his father remained an unbeliever so you have now a a little bit deeper picture here's the grandmother Lois she would have been a and now she becomes a Christian Lois becoming a Christian by her witness converts and maybe I'm just telling the story because Paul says it dwelt first in the grandmother having first dwelt in the grandmother now she becomes a Christian now there's places in the New Testament where the couples are identified a and and the the husband and wife being Believers they're given they're identified and Paul could have done so here but he doesn't make mention of the grandfather so I'm just going to say it let's just make the Assumption and I'm not saying it's true but that the grandpa wasn't a Believer and so now the Grandma's a Believer and here's a family of believing and unbelieving and maybe she was a Jew married to a Jew maybe she was married to a gentile but now she comes from a Jew and she converts to Christianity and I could just see the grand Paul saying well make up your mind what are you circumcised uncircumcised reprobate or Jew is your father Abraham is your father Jesus who is it sure there could be some conflict in the house my grandpa voice is going to ruin my voice excuse me but uh so now it's Lois the grandma who by her witness to her daughter Eunice converts her daughter to Christianity and now her son Timothy is being raised in the faith it wasn't a Jew you could say that he was being raised in a mixed family he wasn't raised as a Jew but now it says at first dwelt in your grandma then this is a faith that your mother Eunice had Lois Eunice and now Timothy has this what's the point I make it's very simple God took a son who is a product of a mixed marriage a marriage between a gentile and a Jew a marriage of believing and unbelieving unbelieving and made him a leader in the New Testament Church that's an example of how that God could take a situation that on the surface it's like yeah I don't know about that but yet God can take it and still use it and this and there's so many other instances in scriptures that we could use but not only does does the scripture take care to share this example to us in Acts chapter 16 and then Paul mentioned in 2 Timothy chapter 1 but the New Testament self addresses many different uh difficult issues and one in fact Paul goes ahead and says hey look there's situations where there's going to be believing and unbelieving and he does it to the Corinthian Church in First Corinthians chapter 7:14 says for the unbelieving husband is Sanctified by the wife and you could just read it as the believing wife because in this setting he's saying hey if they if they're pleased to dwell together let them dwell together so he says the unbelieving husband is Sanctified by the wife and the unbelieving wife is Sanctified by the husband else were your children unclean but now are they holy Paul is Paul is is not hiding it this is not a varnished view of what Christianity is but it it goes ahead and kind of opens up acknowledges that there's going to be situations where husband and wife may not be in harmony they may not be in agreement but it it gives you the word of God and the mind of God a and God's wisdom on how to handle these situations says not everybody's going to be able to be in a perfect family my title I was going to give tonight is pobody's nerfect right I mean nobody's perfect little spoonerism there and so in that we realize that God in the scripture takes Timothy from a unique situation Paul admonishing believing wives and believing husbands to not despair if they have unbelieving spouses he said' look these things are going to happen and in the day and age we're living in we live in a time when there's very unique things that are going to happen at the church I went to in Texas and uh there was uh in one particular service we noticed that there was a couple at the back of the church with a young baby and they just come in from the neighborhood and we found out uh that they were unmarried but they had a a baby together they're raising a baby and we noticed that through time uh the boy would come with the baby and the girl wasn't coming and uh they sat down at one time with the pastor p and asked you know we'd like to have the baby dedicated and and it's like well you know we need to know a little bit more about your situation and then uh the pastor was out of town and so as the the associate I got a phone call said hey uh I need you to counsel with so and so this morning I said well I said okay what's the situation he says well he's actually a she and it was a young girl who's dressing and pretending to be a man and was trying to raise this baby uh with this with his or her I they them baby situation the as a as a girl she was wanting to live and identify as a boy and was and ra raising this baby and they were living together and comes over with this baby and she sits down and she wants to talk about how that she's come to church and the word just begin to wash her and she no longer wants to live this life and she just begin to change she turned into a very beautiful young lady and uh shortly after that that we didn't see her anymore and then we got uh I I one one Sunday morning service at the end a lady came up to the front and she said do you remember do you remember my daughter so and so yes we remember she said she was murdered last week and she said but I wanted to come here because she said this is where her life changed and I wanted to thank you for changing her life and there a very there's a lot of details that we could share but that's a really complicated situation how many of us would be willing to uh believe for redemption in a case like that how many of us would be willing to let someone like that uh uh walk Within These doors a and let the word of God make a difference let the word of God wash them let the love of God be expressed and those are the kind of situations you deal with in the day and age that we're living in and these things have always been but there's a lot of uh difficult marriage situations a lot of difficult personal situations and we got to lead a lot leave a lot of opinion and personal judgment aside and believe in a God who can amen and that's what we can get from this realizing pobud is nerfect that God can use dysfunction for his glory that God could take situations that are certainly not ideal and broken and hard to understand and very difficult and he can use it for his glory if we will yield ourselves to him so what I want to challenge you with tonight is we're trying just to sum up these initial thoughts on the family is from this moment on as individuals just purpose in our hearts that I will take your picture God I will take your picture and I'll walk towards it in faith what you would desire to me to Lord unfold this image before me let me walk in this image that you have for me and I'm not going to keep looking back I'm just going to look forward to what you have for me I'm not going to rationalize I'm not going to make excuses but Lord take me as a vessel now I yield myself to you and I want to walk forward in a plain path and I want to walk into that image that you have for me now in Luke Chapter 9:62 it says and Jesus said unto them no man having put his hand to the plow and looking back is fit for the kingdom of God using this idea this image of one who is sewing and one who's plowing one who's plowing and sewing with the purpose of uh reaping this the one that sews seed his eyes looks toward the fruit of his labor he can't second guess he can't go back and try to change things once the things that have happened you just have to keep going forward and no man who's going to work and going to labor and go forward with Christ you can't keep looking back there can't be reluctance there can't be regret there's we apologize we make mistakes we ask for forgiveness but it's some point we got to ask God to forgive us we have to acknowledge our mistakes and our transgressions before the Lord if we have to make something right with somebody we do that we say Lord I'm going forward now say Lord help me with my memory help me with my affections help me with the things that drag on to me but we got to lay aside the weight I wanted to really amplify that scripture this evening and I just I took it out of the notes for time sake but if we're going to be looking towards Jesus who the is the author and finisher of our faith we must lay aside the weight and the thoughts and the memories the reasons and the affections that so easily beset us and say Lord I'm coming toward you I'm walking towards you I'm going to grow in your grace and I don't want all this baggage to hold me back so a farmer as Jesus uses this image he labors with the Harvest in view he's not doing all the work in the winter uh without the knowledge that there's a harvest in the in the in the fall all his labor all his work is with the Harvest in View and if you think about one on the plow and you're plowing a field if you begin to look back what's going to happen to your line you look back your Line's going to vary you're going to deviate from the path you're going to cause the rose to not be in line so he says if you're going to put your hands to the plow if you're going to go forward if you're going to serve Christ if you're going to take his grace from this moment on and go forward with a new start and a new beginning if you're going to confess and believe that we're new creatures in Christ Jesus all things have become new then what we want to do is put our hands on the plow put our eyes on the word and just go forward brother Bram makes this statement in the message how can I overcome and there's another part here I don't believe I provided the quote but I I'll I'll come to it in a moment to provide some context he says whatever you do who is listening now or who will listen Hereafter the hour is very late and you do have good intention but be caught inside he's talking about how those in the days of Noah were caught outside the ark and so you could have good intentions be sincere but make sure you're in that word you're in that body by one baptism we're baptized into the body of Christ Christ now he says this because we have this uh this yielding and or well we want to be new creatures we want to be seal with the Holy Ghost which is the new birth this is what we want God to do for us and then he identifies you want to be caught inside but then we you don't want to make this the wrong kind of effort he says now don't struggle not him that willth or him that runneth but God he says just let God just yield yourself to him and walk on with the perfect satisfied faith that what God is promised he is able to perform so it's not it's not up to you to try to filter your past to make sense of it it's not up to you to try to figure out how to make the picture work going forward Lord I am what I am I I I've made mistakes I can't change that even some things I can't help being what I am because of this circumstance or that circumstance Lord I acknowledge this this is who who I am this is where I am but Lord I'm going to trust in a God he says that has made the promise and he's able to perform it and what is perfect is my satisfied faith I'm going forward what God has promised he's able to perform and he and then he just relates it to all the things we try to do not joining one denomination another denomination it's not going to fix it just because you join a church running this that or the other trying this all these little things we may try to do he says just yield yourself to God and walk with him peaceful quiet not interrupted wow I like that where what what app do I need to download for that just yield yourself to God walk with him peaceful quiet not interrupted just keep on walking with him attending to the Lord without distraction keeping him first that's right he says that's what I told our brother that just had the breakdown now I'm going to go ahead and just do it maybe a little bit I just want to stop there he says that's what I told our brother that just had the breakdown so you can keep that this statement up there and maybe you're reading the head but I'll just read what brother Bram says earlier paragraph eight of how can I overcome just went into the room just now and a brother about my age and his wife sitting there and the Holy Spirit there came down amongst us in the room and just think making mention of a healing service there he was and he told this brother all about what he had done and what he had been doing and what caused his trouble and where he come from and all about him so we can say the Holy Spirit read his life story and knew what he had been doing his past says and there was a great Dark Shadow hung in the room and then it started getting lighter lighter lighter lighter lighter than the Holy Spirit took hold they come from around near Yakima Washington and drove in and he's a minister of the Gospel but just to see the grace of God there where the man had been in the institution had treatments and everything the Holy Spirit revealing all this when the doctors trying hard to do everything that they could perhaps for the man but it just took that certain little touch from God to turn the tide shock treatments is all right but that's kind of what we'd call a shot in the dark you know it might make you worse cuz you'd forget everything you ever knew when they put that medicine in you but the Lord God how his grace and mercy even before I ever offered a word of prayer for him it was already over just took that certain something of God that certain touch to do it now there's a lot that you could read into this but it was all he had done what he had been doing what caused his trouble where he come from and all about him and all it took was for God to touch him for him to come on the scene that little certain touch from God and it turned the tide of everything that he had done what he had been doing what causes trouble where he come from and all about him and so brother bandam is not saying look you've done a lot of dirt you've done a lot of damage you've done a lot of different things we know where you've been we know what you've done uh we know where you come from and all about you so there's going to be some kind of qualification on your faith going forward as a result of all the stupid things you've done before that's not what God said that's not how God dealt with the individual that's not how God was saying well you're going to have to pay the price but he says it just took a certain something from God in that touch to he say it was all already over so notice how brother brandham puts it in these words I find this just so beautiful and and it's something you want to write down and remember he says that's what I just told our brother that just had the breakdown just yield to him he's here he knowed what you have done and what caused your being and doing this way and all that look at it from a the the the 55,000 foot view in the sense that he knows the makeup of your nature he knows the kind of nurture you've been under he knows the relationship ship you've had he knows the sufferings that you've had by the hands of people he knows the lies he knows the failures he knows the failed expectations he knows all the lies you've told he knows your ins and outs and your ups and downs he knows everything you've done what caused your being what to be that way doing this way and all that he knows all about you and now he's just told you back just what to do and what is he to do only thing you have to do is just go do it okay that is forget all about the Past walk live for the future in the glory and presence of God could you do that tonight forget about the past From This Moment On you're not trying to revise history not trying to even not even trying to make sense of History not trying to connect the dots say God I know where you've called me to this point now I know where I am now and and I I I'm not I can't change the past and there and I can't go back and redo certain things so here I am today say Lord I'm going to yield to you you take it from here and in this very passage brother brandham uses the example of a child trying to put on the coat and how they struggle with the arm and say just this is what we do as Believers we say Lord you go ahead and do it and this is the only thing you have to do and so you should just go do it and you say well this sounds easy forgetting is very hard to forgive is human to forget is divine right often we say to a is human but even to forgive is something that we ought to do as humans it's God who says he can forget but yet this is something that we must try to practice is there some sort of forgetting or letting go of the past and then don't just let go of the past and just kind of sit there staring at it looking at it rehashing it he says walk live for the future in the glory and the presence of God this is what we can do when we've uh had these things in our past these circumstances and these difficulties and maybe we haven't started out right in our marriage maybe we haven't started outright in our families maybe it's too far gone for us to restore a marriage and and things have broken down but we say Lord from here on I know I can go forward and I can't keep looking back and dwell in the past I want to live for the future in the glory and the presence of God and I'll say this and believe under Supernatural expectation that great things are going to happen that all the promises of the fruits of the spirit are yours you can walk in joy you can walk in peace and that you can be used of God to do many exploits forget about all that's in the past walk live for the future in the glory and the presence of God Philippians chapter 3: 3- 14 says Brethren I count not myself to have apprehended Paul didn't count himself as being perfect then I'm not going to count myself as being perfect and he even goes so far as to say and those who are perfect still think this way still be thus minded but this one thing I do forgetting those things which were be which are behind and reaching forth under those things things which are before I press toward the mark for the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus so this is the one thing he did the one thing I do brother B says there's only one thing you have to do only thing you have to do is just go do it the only thing you have to do is forget all about the Past walk live for the future in the glory and the presence of God this is what Paul is saying this one thing he does it's I press toward the mark for the prize of the whole High Calling of God in Christ Jesus that's the one thing he does I press toward the mark That's the distant goal I press towards the mark there's something that it has in view the very word I think that is used H is even the Greek that we would use for scope he he scoped it out he zeroed in on he's bringing it into Focus it's in view it's his aim this one thing I've scoped it's this one thing that's a distant goal to me this is the one thing that I've set before me I'm pressing towards what I've set before me is the mark and I'm going to press towards that Mark but then he amplifies it that he could not accomplish that one thing unless he first forgot about the past and reached forward so this one thing I do I press towards the mark for the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus and if I'm going to be able to do that I've got to forget the things which are behind and not making any qualifications He suggests that we're not just going to sit back in glory in the Glory Days I remember this and remember that and remember this and remember that past or good we got to keep our eyes forward focused on what God the in the presence of God now in the glory and presence of God now I'm going to live for the future walking forward I'm going to set this Mark before me for the prize of this High Calling and so I've got to forget the things which are behind and then I begin to reach forth to the things which are before me the promises of God the future The Joy which is set before us that's what we are to do we're to go forward so the preaching of the word if it's to if the preaching of the word would to bring up anything from our past then it's po it's it's possible that the word would do that so that you could make it right I forgot all about that I need to make that right you told a lie on somebody and maybe it's just last week you lied and the words being preached and you remember that lie you don't go forgetting those things which are behind forgetting those things which are behind I I press towards the mark now you'd say well you know what I need to make that right so there's times when the word of God preached actually deals with us in an emotional way to bring us to the place and God will use our emotions to be able to say I'm sorry to acknowledge certain failures acknowledge mistakes or or to make things right and so God will God will do that and then once once that that has been processed and once we go through that that dealing of the Holy Spirit they've got to go forward we can't wallow in that Misery we can't we can't a woe is me because I made this mistake let's go forward let's March forward this one thing I'm going to do forget the things which are behind me I'm going to take the momentum of the good and go forward and I'm going to take all the bad and bury it in the sea of God's forgetfulness I've been forgiven I'm putting it under the blood I'm going forward knowing that God's with me brother B says in the message Shalom we're not going to have a rearview mirror Affair I like that rearview mirror only looks back to see where you've been we're looking forward to see where we're going we don't want to have a rearview mirror Affair it it that that we can't always have that instinct to where we're always just kind of looking over our shoulder and always look back behind us and always wondering about the past and I I know what it's like to have a mind that just won't shut down you're constantly going back over things that are said things that are done and you'll go so far back in your past and all of a sudden you begin to experience the shame and the embarrassment of something you did 20 years before why you're mining for that you're going back searching it out you're thinking about you're oh this and that and this mistake and that mistake and before you know it you have this ability of resurrecting feelings you start feeling it all over again and so this can be something very difficult to stop the mind and and put it off but we need to be able to just rest in God and say Lord I can't keep looking back it only causes me anxiety it only causes me fear it only brings me down lord I want to start new in you I want to look forward not looking in the review mirror I want to look forward I know you've got great things for me I see you working in my life I see the hand of God in my life I see it in my marriage I see it in my family I see it in my church I hear it in the testimonies of the believer I want to look forward to see where we're going cuz if you look back you end up going back we got to go forward and I believe that we we should be positive and we should be forward looking for ourselves and others and I I I I could say it this way it's easier to believe for others we could be going through difficulty and be burdened and be anxious and really suffering from trial and somebody visit the church and say I'm just going through the worst time of my life I'm just despairing from life you're listen God's with you he's for you you don't doubt you just go forward he's going to do great things for you you know what you should do you should just take all that sorrow and just put it behind you the joy of the Lord is your strength and you could just really witness to them and encourage them and they just kind of take you at your word and just believe and they just go forward enjy and you walk away and someone says how you doing brother I'm just really going through it right because it's it's easier to believe for somebody or at least it's easier to tell somebody else what to do and and though that's true I I think we should be positive for ourselves forward looking for ourselves in other words not a riew m fair but looking to where we're going what God is doing the great things he has in store for us but do it not only just for ourselves and for members of our family and those we have relationships with but for the others that God wants to bring in our midst God is has brought together a group of people that he wants to use to minister to others to to be there as a strength to those that need ministering who need support who need friendships you need a family because they otherwise don't have one we can become that family and we want to believe for them we want to be positive and someone comes say well where are you from well I'm I'm from Peoria oh that's great that's wonderful what part I'm from there you say so do you have a job yeah I've got a job so tell me a little bit about yourself and they start they said we're so glad you're here just God's really moving and and we really believing and we just begin to testify and they said well so tell me about yourself and they start telling their story and you start going um you know there's other churches um I mean well that's a that's a pretty difficult case I think I might have mentioned it over the pulp recent where that one Minister that someone came up and really had a demon they said call the authorities this person really does have a demon all a sudden we just I don't know if God can help you man I don't know that's that's a really rough situation we want to have faith for those who need God to intervene for them I I just let me read this statement this is a very lengthy but I just I want to share this so our faith could be raised I think we're doing okay on time I just had a couple statements to read before I closed I hope this doesn't interrupt the flow here brother R's in a prayer line says how do you do young man do you believe me to be the servant of God I don't have the uh this on the slides many other servants are here but I'm his servant immediately there's a spirit pulling from this young man this boy is in trouble he's deeply in trouble this boy is suffering from a mental disorder you just come from an institution I see them giving you it's it's a shock treatment they give you shock treatments and you have a an a phobia that is you you see a face before you all the time and it's your mother's face that you see this is very interesting uh something that he's going through something he's suffered uh maybe even in his familyes he says it's his mother's face that's before him he says you're a married man you have a wife and two children Jesus Christ that come along and delivered the man of gdor is here tonight to deliver you from this and take that phobia from from you and drive the devil devil from you that you can return to your home well this is somebody who for whatever reason had a mental disorder the fact that he brings his mother into this something maybe he's had through his lifetime it's the phobia he says now I want to pray that this would drive this from you do you believe that do you believe that he sent me to do this for you would you bow your heads and be reverent this is very treacherous and dangerous keep your head bowed till you hear my voice say raise your head come here young man before I ask this blessing I'm going to ask you something will you obey as his servant and do as I tell you to do you're going to get well the time of Deliverance is at hand this is a devil doing this young man he would drive you Stark mad keep you that way the rest of your life but God can restore you in your right mind and right mental conditions I see another thing you've been to psychiatrist somebody tried to talk to you but that's the I that's not the idea it takes more than that for you it takes the power of the Living God you understand me if you don't you will in a moment moment bow your head in reverence believe that God raised up his son Jesus to deliver you and listen to this prayer Heavenly Father this young man standing here fine looking young fellow standing here in the stature of Young Manhood and Satan has come to tear up his home break up his family and drive this young man out into the Wilds but oh God now think about what that home life must have been like mental disorder phobia and shock treatments and Mental Hospitals and psychiatrist but oh God who made the heavens and the Earth who created all things through Jesus Christ I come as your servant in prayer of faith for this young man knowing that just now he can't have faith for himself because of his conditions wow that's remarkable that's remarkable so then I and this this gives me this I believe this gives us charge as Believers that there can be times in our lives where we need to have faith for those who can't have it these difficult situation these dark situations these times of Despair where it's so easy for us to get judgmental and get condescending and lose our patience and have no Grace but think Lord can I have the faith for this person right now because they don't seem to have enough Faith Lord hear the prayer of your servant and Satan is haunting at him and making him his life a misery but the Lord Jesus that set the maniac free that was Far Beyond this boy you can make this boy well tonight and Satan you who bound him you've escaped the psychiatrist you've escaped the Medical Treatments but you can't escape the power of God Amen Hallelujah they can escape a lot of different things but they can't escape the power of God come out of him in the name of Jesus Christ go for him go from him young man look here now it's over you're healed now he says don't smoke anymore live like a real Christian go giving God praise and sing his Praises day and night raise up your hands and give him thanks for your healing you feel all right now don't you the boy says he's feeling fine everything's gone when it went an evil spirit went away went that way God in heaven knows I'm not a fanatic I'll be judged at the day of judgment the thing whed away passed out of the boy going in that direction it even felt like a wind going that way when it left him the evil Powers left the boy go get to your wife and family and rejoice and be happy rejoice in the Lord live like a real Christian go give him praise and sing praises day and night I want to have this kind of faith for myself and for others for those who may not have it because that's what God positions maybe a lot of this is uh I found it just being an extension of the question we asked ourselves who is my neighbor to believe all things are possible with men this is impossible but With God all things are possible and where someone's Faith may not be able to believe may we create the kind of atmosphere to loose their faith we're in a family situation where the wife is uncertain and the kids begin to get a little bit nervous Lord let me have the faith to believe when they can't do it looking forward to see where we're going having a positive Faith being forward looking for our families for ourselves and for others what is it it's it's having a faith that he's working all things for the good now this statement I want to read from why Christ speak I think you're mature enough to be able to do this he's using the very specific example but I want you to be able to identify these mechanisms that brother R refers to in lot and even Moses and how that we may not be in the exact situation that lot's in and using the same kind of viewpoint to hinder our faith but I want you to look in the sense of what the image we put before us the things we idolize the things that we desire to achieve the filter we have the image we have or even the things that we idolize how it all gets us off the wrong track and it doesn't feed our faith doesn't help us go forward but it holds us back or even causes us to fall fall back he says now we find out that Moses's Faith led him to watch what would be not what was that's the faith the that that I want to have I want to have the faith that leads me to believe what will be not what's been I don't even need Faith to know what I've done I don't need Faith to know that I've made mistakes I don't need Faith to know that I I I backslid I don't need Faith to know that I I was raised in the message and I took seems like I wasted a lot of wonderful opportunities I don't need Faith to believe that I just need a memory amen and he's saying now this he had the F he had the kind of faith that led him to watch what would be and not watch what was but he says look at tomorrow instead of today guess there's not supposed to be a butt there so look at tomorrow instead of today look at the promise instead of the glamour I thought that was very unique so you're looking at tomorrow instead of today you're looking at the future future instead of yesterday then he says look at the promise instead of the glamour some kind of idea something be presented to you something some kind of fantastic that would distract you he says look at the people instead of the organization God did that and now he uses lot as a contrast to Moses he says lot could see the glamour of prosperity down in Sodom now let's use that as a mechanism where we ought to not look at what has been and even what is but have a faith that leads us to watch what will be according to a promise we're living for the future as brother says we're looking forward to see where we're going says let's forget about the past walk live for the future and the glory and presence of God that's what we're supposed to do but now we can see the glamour of something else some other image some other filtered picture where we we're not really seeing if you want you see the glamour of Sodom but if it's filter to you don't look at all the bad things that come with it lot could see the possibilities of a lot of money it's the pretense it's the prestige it it's the it's the visual Perfection lot could see the possibilities when he looked over to Sodom and he could maybe become being that he was a Hebrew he might become a great man there because he was a great intellectual figure and the nephew of Abraham so he chose to go towards Sodom lot's intellects led him to see the glamour of prosperity lot's intellects led him to see the blessing of Glamour now as I'm challenging you to have no filter a true family with no fil filter and to not filter the word of God with our intellects with our thought processes with our imagination and our affections and our reasons and those things we want to take the word of God as it's taught and see it for what God wants to do yield ourselves to say Lord you produce the image of what this seed is to produce and not put pressure on ourselves to conform to a particular idea and and be a a cookie cutter family and try to get everybody to eat at the same place I'm realizing Ros is becoming very popular because I keep mentioning it but we're not trying to drive everybody like battle to all conform and be the same way and drive the same car and do the same thing with their kids but we want to be what God's called us to be and avoid these biases where lot saw his intellect led him to see the glamour of prosperity his intellect led him to see the blessings of Glamour so there's a drawing power of these filters a drawing power of these images that are all carnal he says but his faith was paralyzed by it but his faith was so paralyzed by it he didn't see the fire that was going to destroy that sort of life and that's the way the people are today they see the possibilities of belonging to a great organization it it's achieve a social standing my role socially within a particular social dynamic or Social Circle let's not measure ourselves by that whatever we do let's not just become that and see the possibilities of having social standing with the people of the city but they don't see their faith is paralyzed let me repeat that so it won't be misunderstood in other words when you get your eyes on the wrong thing the glamour you get the P the the wrong kind of picture being painted that kind of expectation that kind of ambition will paralyze your faith so he says women today they want to act like the movie stars the men today they want to act like the television comedians now let's just put it within uh the context today what it is it's the influencers the Instagram Stars the Tik Tok Stars the the YouTube celebrities those are the things that we can I the movie stars the social media Stars men today want to act like the television comedians they say television comedians we don't have a TV okay you want to act like Dude Perfect all right come on somebody can I get an amen there's things you begin to idolize there's certain things you begin to want to pursue things you want to do and brother bam says they paralyze the little faith that they did have by putting your eyes on the wrong things by glamorizing the wrong image he says it can't can't work said now Moses give away to that what did Moses do he led him to watch what will be not what had been not where he was Moses gave way to that and his faith paralyzed the world did you catch that others the world paralyzes their faith but Moses had an ambition who for knowing that this was a reproachful thing but he knew there was a reward knowing the riches of Christ were greater than all the things had to offer the world had to offer he could set his eyes on the future not worried about his past and he could look forward to the things which were before him so he gave away to the things of the world the Glamour the intellects the filters all the things that tried to paint this pretty picture to get you to run after it and his faith paralyzed the world either your faith will paralyze glamour or either the glamour will paralyze your faith you have to take one or the other I believe we ought to have the kind of faith that paralyzes the glamour that when the wrong image is being set before us we have the kind of Faith to believe when the devil says well if you're not this if you can't be this you can't be anything say I believe in a God who can I believe in a God who that may not be what I'm called to do in this life we're taught time and time again even with respect to Ministries that you may never go overseas and preach you may never Lay Your Hands on the sick brother man talks about and feel that charge of God raise a dead person up or heal somebody's limb but we all have a part to play and we can't make the mistake of elevating certain manifestations and certain gifts and certain H mannerisms as being more Dynamic and more powerful and more necessary than others we're all working together we all have a hike that we need to hike we all have a role that we need to play we all have a life that we need to live and I want to walk in the path that he's called me to walk in I want to Ho the road that he's asked me to hoe if he wants me to plant potatoes I want to plant my potatoes if he wants me to build a house I want to build a house I want to live the life do what he's called me to do and have the kind of faith that paralyzes the wrong filter that that puts puts away and pushes away all the wrong kind of ideas that try to make me feel condemned and make me feel unworthy or make me uh just cause me to like I don't feel like I can go forward anymore let my faith paralyze the glamour I love how he says his faith paralyzed the world that's what I want just a faith taser now the world just comes at me the world just drops doubt unbelief fear drama just have the kind of faith that just puts it at Bay he says it's either going to paralyze your faith or you're going to paralyze it well I'm just going to choose to have paralyzing Faith a faith that paralyzes I don't want my faith to be in a wheelchair I believe this faith is strong it's got muscles invite the musicians to come why we just stand to our feet as I was um pondering these things today that song The Winds of Faith came on my heart and that's what we can do we can just set our wings to The Winds of faith and he said Lord I I could choose now brother man says you could choose two different ways you can either have your faith paralyzed or your faith can paralyze the world say Lord I'm going to choose the one by faith I'm going to choose a pathway that believes for the impossible I'm going to choose a pathway that listen let's just be honest regardless of what it holds there's joy in it regards to what the circumstances may be there's peace I'm going to commit to that that's what I'm going to believe for and I realize and I've been very disappointed with myself over even over the last few years where there's still anxiety and there's still pain there's still bitterness despite all the the promises you believe in the things you even preach yet you fret over hurts and you fret over estrangement you fret over difficulty you fret over uh things that are said and done and and it's a you believe those things have happened you believe they're wrong and you couldn't be moved from it but what you really need to do is take your faith that so perfectly can explain what's happened and how it's really wrong but take some of that same conviction and faith and believe that God you can turn things around for the better that even this Lord I believe in this there's good and then I want to take my faith and put it out before me and live for the future forget all about the Past walk live for the future but you're going to lose this you're going to lose that you can't have this you can't have that you should have invested in Bitcoin when you had the opportunity a few years ago I'm not worried about it anymore you should have waited to sell your house you should have taken that opportunity you should have done this hey those things are in the past I can't change them that's right I'm not going to spend my time wondering if there really is a time machine I'm not going to spend my time wondering well maybe if I get in now and say Lord I'm just going to yield to you if I missed it then and I was supposed to do it it would have only been because I wasn't fully surrendered so Lord I don't want to make the mistake now of not fully surrendering I so brother Brandon makes this statement in the message of super sign and I I was reading around this at the end of the year last year and up to our watch Night Service and he makes mention in this month prior or during that same month different things as dedications and things is very extraordinary and this is I I read this now before we go to prayer because you we're just saying I'm going to start right now from this moment on I'm going to put this the the word before me and by faith I'm going to walk towards it forget all that's behind me live for the Future walk walk in the glory and presence of God this is what I'm going to do then I think we can just consecrate ourselves tonight make a new dedication he says after I made a new dedication my own self and my wife so this is this is instructive to US December 27th 1959 I've made a new dedication of myself my wife and I we've rededicated ourselves we've noticed things so different around home just a rededication a reconsecration can make things different at home now I hope you can really let these words sink in not as nervous as we were shaky and jumpy you know how you're just on edge and you don't have the patience you should have with children who are just being innocent they're just being inquisitive that they really need something you're the one that has the answer you've always told them if you ever need this come talk to me and then the moment they do it's like I'm busy like oh you had just told me if I ever really needed you wa you're jumpy you're shaky he says we won't get this we won't get that goes we just go at it just quietly and get more done he says just yield yourself to him walk on with the perfect satisfied Faith just yield yourself to God and walk with him peaceful quiet not interrupted this is what you can do when you make a new dedication you're less shaky and jumpy we won't get this we won't get that we just go at it just quietly and get more done so now there's a coming new year and we don't believe in turning new pages and how is this relevant yet we're here at the beginning of a new year we're also looking at something we want to go forward in the word of God our past calls to us as a a hindering Force to keep us looking back and looking back he says we don't believe in turning new pages we just believe in burning the old I'm just going to drop kick the old book Into the Fire today just put it in the fire so just keep yourself consecrated to God through the coming year that's all that we can do so let's do this together as a body of Christ let's have a new dedication we have we have uh dedicated ourselves individually we don't have a we've dedicated this place of worship and we could say that there's church dedications and moments where we rededicate ourselves but let's make a new dedication of ourselves individually tonight let's make a dedication as a body of Believers that we're going to go forward without filters go forward without judgment go forward without pretense go forward without without personality and without politics Lord I just want to go forward and make a new dedication and pray this pray this for yourself I don't want to be a shaky and jumpy I want things to be different at home I want to go just quietly and I want to get more done amen that's what I want I want to get more done let's bow our heads in prayer if you'd like this to be your prayer why don't you just joined with me raising hands and say Lord this is my prayer I'm making a new dedication to myself that's wonderful you could raise your hands the young ones you could raise your hands say Lord I'm making a new dedication of myself I want to yield to you now Lord just as the prophet instructed us to do it our gracious heavenly father I make a new dedication of myself tonight to you I yield to you Lord my ambitions I yield to you my health my mental health my physical health I yield to you my desires as a man I yield to you our family bucket list I yield to you Lord Our Family Vision and Endeavors Lord there's many things that we lift up to do I want to do this and I want to do this with my family and I I want to see this happen I want to see that happen and we can get really excited about it and we can do a lot of things to try to achieve it but Lord I want to dedicate myself to you your goal your ambition and I want to do what you would want me to do Lord I pray that you could take our humility tonight as each one has raised their hands and surrendered to you and receive us under you as we dedicate ourselves to you we consecrate ourselves to you we choose the path of Faith tonight we're forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth to those things which are before we're doing this one thing pressing towards the mark because we know there's a prize Lord may we walk in this High Calling I pray that you give Liberty heal hurting Hearts set the captive free seal these things in our hearts Lord just even maybe as a summary of these things we've been preaching on and in the beginning and and who is my neighbor and the family Lord may we now take a step forward as a church take steps forward as husbands and wife and fathers and mothers men and women Lord committing things to you now father I pray that you bless your people as we are dismissed may your presence go with us in the name of Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen
