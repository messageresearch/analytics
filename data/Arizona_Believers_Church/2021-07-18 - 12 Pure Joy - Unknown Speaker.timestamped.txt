[0:00] nehemiah chapter eight i'd like just to
[0:02] read one
[0:03] um one verse verse 10
[0:06] and uh realizing that there's some
[0:08] things maybe that we might
[0:10] be missing a little bit by not reading
[0:13] verses one two 14 which is kind of what
[0:17] i've been looking at and studying
[0:19] but we'll just read verse 10 for time's
[0:21] sake this morning
[0:25] nehemiah chapter 8 verse 10.
[0:30] then he said unto them go your way eat
[0:33] the fat
[0:34] and drink the sweet can we say amen to
[0:36] that too many fat free things and no
[0:38] sugars anymore
[0:40] brother vincent hey man right we just
[0:41] claim it we accept it go your way eat
[0:43] the fat and drink the sweet
[0:46] and send portions unto them for whom
[0:48] nothing is prepared
[0:49] for this day is holy unto our lord
[0:52] neither be
[0:53] sorry for the joy of the lord
[0:56] is your strength for the joy of the lord
[0:59] is your strength god bless you you can
[1:01] be seated
[1:07] if you look at the title slide we're
[1:08] preaching today on pure joy
[1:11] and you say brother aaron you've been
[1:12] preaching on pure joy for the last
[1:13] several services well
[1:14] today we're finally preaching on pure
[1:17] joy
[1:18] we first begin to look at it god dealt
[1:19] with the hearts on different subjects in
[1:21] terms of
[1:22] uh i think invert always invert i hadn't
[1:24] really premeditated
[1:26] doing a little bit of a review but maybe
[1:28] we'll just do it as it comes to mind and
[1:30] then we
[1:31] spoke on the joy of motherhood and then
[1:34] on vietnam
[1:35] and the victory ahead is victory now and
[1:40] then
[1:40] over the last few when we preached on a
[1:42] clean conscience
[1:44] and then over the last few services we
[1:46] had been preaching on being wide awake
[1:48] and each one of those elements
[1:49] uh dealt with the conditions for pure
[1:52] joy
[1:53] but what initially inspired this thought
[1:56] on pure joy is really what
[1:57] i'm going to be preaching today and in
[1:59] doing so maybe throwing a lot of things
[2:01] out there for us to digest and to ponder
[2:03] and to think about
[2:05] and i trust that you could just be real
[2:07] attentive
[2:08] and uh and just open in your hearts
[2:11] because
[2:11] it might be easy to hear some things and
[2:13] then kind of try to put them in a
[2:14] particular category and say oh well
[2:16] this is the point that's being made
[2:17] there if you begin to quote brother
[2:20] branham a lot sometimes there might be a
[2:21] tendency think oh well this is the
[2:22] direction he's going there
[2:24] but if you're a christian today if you
[2:26] are a believer in your heart then you
[2:28] can say god
[2:29] you desire to speak to me
[2:32] and that's the vessel that's standing
[2:34] there today to speak
[2:36] so you use him to speak to my heart and
[2:38] you just have that confidence in that
[2:40] dynamic that it's not about
[2:41] vindicating brother aaron it's not about
[2:43] confirming whether or not arizona
[2:44] believers church is
[2:46] is the right thing but rather as far as
[2:48] you as an individual in your
[2:49] relationship with christ
[2:51] there's a there's a man standing before
[2:53] me today with the bible open before him
[2:55] who's going to be preaching the word of
[2:57] god
[2:57] therefore as a believer and as a son or
[2:59] daughter of god then you use that to
[3:01] speak to me because that's what's most
[3:03] important
[3:04] is your individual relationship with the
[3:06] lord and how he speaks to you
[3:07] and directs you so i gonna just take
[3:11] this subject
[3:11] and actually i'm just gonna start with
[3:13] the statement from this third seal
[3:15] and i think yourselves you can maybe see
[3:17] who've been here through several
[3:18] services
[3:19] see all these things connect together
[3:22] brother branham is talking about how
[3:23] that the church
[3:24] has as god dealt with the church through
[3:26] the church ages
[3:28] there had been this birth of the
[3:29] christian church then the scriptures
[3:31] teach us that the antichrist spirit
[3:33] comes into the church defiling it making
[3:35] it lukewarm and powerless
[3:37] and eventually gets to the place where
[3:39] it goes into the ground and dies
[3:41] and then god's going to bring it back to
[3:42] a process of reformation
[3:45] and in doing so it's going to bring back
[3:46] certain elements and things into the
[3:48] church
[3:49] but it in this process of restoration
[3:51] and this reformation
[3:53] it comes to a place where it still has
[3:55] not yet received that life
[3:57] messenger and hasn't received that final
[3:59] climactic restoration
[4:01] back to what god had envisioned the
[4:03] church to be in the very beginning
[4:06] so he's identifying that even through
[4:08] what seems to be a reviving in building
[4:10] back of the church
[4:11] god's sending a message god bringing
[4:13] back certain truths and god
[4:14] establishing certain things within the
[4:16] within the church that there had not yet
[4:18] been
[4:19] a prophetic a fulfillment of things
[4:21] promised to come to the church
[4:23] and he makes this statement in the third
[4:25] seal now that's what's the reason today
[4:28] that the revivals we're supposed to have
[4:30] we have denominational revivals we have
[4:32] not had a real
[4:34] stirring so think of that phrase i want
[4:35] to come back to it stirring
[4:37] we've had revivals denominationally
[4:39] qualified as a denominational revivals
[4:41] but not a real stirring
[4:42] no no no no sir don't think we got
[4:46] revivals
[4:46] we haven't oh they got millions and
[4:48] millions of church members
[4:50] but not a revival nowhere that that
[4:53] instructs us that
[4:54] we do not we're not counting church
[4:57] members to determine whether or not god
[4:58] is moving
[5:00] i could you imagine if we use those
[5:02] metrics today we would look at jesus
[5:03] with 12 disciples and say
[5:05] failure right you only got 12 people
[5:08] that want to follow him
[5:09] you think of we you think in the upper
[5:11] room after jesus's ministry
[5:12] and everything that he had said and done
[5:14] you think 120 people in the upper room
[5:16] we'd say
[5:17] that's nothing that doesn't even get
[5:19] into message mega church category
[5:22] that that's we would we would just begin
[5:24] immediately begin to have a lot of
[5:25] different judgments but he says
[5:26] it's not the church members he says no
[5:29] no so it's seven
[5:30] times that he's making this uh a
[5:32] reference that there's not has not been
[5:34] a real stirring or real revival and then
[5:37] he qualifies it this way the bride has
[5:39] not had a revival yet
[5:41] so the church he's going to maybe
[5:43] background a little bit more well
[5:45] you see how he says it here the the
[5:48] church
[5:48] has had revivals denominations have had
[5:51] revivals
[5:52] but as far as the bride's revival that
[5:54] has not come yet
[5:55] there has been no revival there and then
[5:58] he says
[5:58] he kind of defines revival this way no
[6:01] manifestation of god
[6:03] to stir the bride yet said real stirring
[6:07] now there's been no manifestation to
[6:08] stir
[6:09] the bride yet we are looking for it he
[6:11] says
[6:12] it will take those seven unknown
[6:14] thunders back there and he's referring
[6:16] to the
[6:16] seven unknown thunders that are
[6:18] prophesied in the book of revelation to
[6:20] wake her up again
[6:22] he will send it he promised it so
[6:25] there's
[6:25] there's a lot here i want you to hold in
[6:27] your minds and again
[6:29] don't try to make this theology or even
[6:31] history please don't just make it
[6:32] history
[6:33] and don't make it these mysterious
[6:34] things and the symbols in the book of
[6:36] revelation
[6:37] that you just lead leave to the
[6:39] theologians but make this very personal
[6:40] how god would want to strike this in
[6:42] your heart
[6:43] but brother branham is saying that the
[6:45] seven thunders are the manifestation of
[6:47] god that wakes up the bride
[6:50] and so now that may seem to be oh the
[6:52] seven seven thunders uttered their
[6:54] voices when each seal is open there's a
[6:56] a thunder that goes forth there's a way
[6:58] that we begin to think
[6:59] historically or theo as far as theology
[7:02] and it can become something that's much
[7:05] bigger in our minds
[7:06] and detached from something very
[7:08] personal but i want you just to
[7:10] take the language and not attach
[7:11] anything to it but just say well lord
[7:13] what does that mean to me personally
[7:15] and so once that those thunders as he
[7:18] called the seven mysterious unknown
[7:20] thunders
[7:20] once that wakes up the bride she now has
[7:23] a spiritual consciousness
[7:25] to see the word unfold as long as she's
[7:29] slumbering and
[7:30] sleep as long as she's laying there
[7:31] remember there was a stimulating cry
[7:33] that goes forth and the parable of the
[7:34] ten virgins
[7:36] and it's at that stimulating cry that
[7:38] the wise virgins
[7:39] wake up and that they have oil in their
[7:42] lamps and they can go out and meet the
[7:43] lord so there's
[7:44] something that wakes her up and then
[7:46] even when you read it and i had this
[7:48] discussion one time with another
[7:49] a number of different ministers and and
[7:51] i i kind of just made the point
[7:54] it doesn't say that the stimulating cry
[7:56] wakes up the foolish it just says there
[7:58] was a stimulating cry
[7:59] and all of them awoke and it was the
[8:01] wise who had oil on their lamp and
[8:03] and and they're the ones that are
[8:05] stimulated and have the right materials
[8:07] and the things necessary to go out and
[8:09] meet the lord
[8:10] so once that cry goes forth and wakes us
[8:13] up and
[8:13] and causes us to raise to our feet then
[8:15] we have a spiritual consciousness
[8:17] of the things that unfold thereafter it
[8:19] wasn't like an
[8:20] alarm went off and they wake up like all
[8:22] right what are we doing kind of like
[8:23] sometimes we'll we forget to change our
[8:25] alarm or set it to where
[8:27] it doesn't go off on a saturday and our
[8:29] alarm goes off and we wake up we're like
[8:31] oh i got to get oh no
[8:32] it's not work today what am i up for why
[8:35] am i awake oh i forgot to set my you
[8:36] know turn my alarm off
[8:37] and there's really no purpose now for
[8:39] waking up they are awake to then
[8:41] understand what what's taking place next
[8:44] and where they needed to be next and so
[8:46] this is
[8:46] kind of the process that begins to
[8:48] unfold in type here how there's a
[8:50] awakening up of the bride think
[8:53] individual members
[8:54] now and then they have a consciousness
[8:56] of what god is doing
[8:57] what god's will is and what he desires
[8:59] for your personal life what he's doing
[9:01] with the bride and then walking in that
[9:04] unfolding word
[9:05] is what's going to be the bride's
[9:07] revival or the bride's joy
[9:09] being woke up it's not a dream this
[9:11] message is not a dream
[9:14] and in this world we may say it's a
[9:16] nightmare and it's chaos but our reality
[9:18] is something very very great something
[9:19] very very wonderful
[9:21] what we believe in what we're
[9:22] fellowshipping in is not imagination
[9:24] uh what we believe is not fables and
[9:26] stories and i hope so
[9:28] and so when we wake up it's we're waking
[9:30] up to a spiritual reality that we can
[9:32] begin to walk in
[9:33] even in the midst of laodicea in the
[9:35] midst of chaos
[9:36] and then that becomes our joy walking in
[9:39] the word of god
[9:40] and so that's ah that's you gonna be
[9:42] your satisfaction
[9:44] if i could say this that there's a
[9:46] there's a god wants to wake us up to the
[9:48] word of god
[9:49] and in waking us up he wants to then
[9:51] teach us and cause his word to unfold
[9:54] and then walking in this now don't make
[9:55] that something very
[9:57] weird and strange it's just your daily
[9:59] life
[10:00] him him living through you fulfilling
[10:02] the word of god that's what we're
[10:04] talking about
[10:04] you say well does that mean i i got to
[10:06] go overseas and raise the dead in an
[10:08] evangelistic
[10:09] missionary trip no just do what god
[10:10] called you to do right in whatever zip
[10:12] code you're in
[10:13] that's what we mean about walking in the
[10:15] word of god and watching unfold and
[10:16] that's how you're going to be satisfied
[10:19] there there's there's sometimes there's
[10:21] this emptiness and this longing in our
[10:23] hearts
[10:23] things just aren't right and things just
[10:25] start lining up and and we feel that
[10:26] maybe something is wrong
[10:28] and really we just need we can keep
[10:30] doing what we're doing
[10:31] we just need to get into the channel of
[10:33] god's word and reestablish a connection
[10:35] with jesus christ it's like oh
[10:37] i don't need to quit my job oh i don't
[10:38] need to move over here i just needed to
[10:40] be in that channel where the word of god
[10:42] is feeding my heart
[10:43] and then then life becomes more
[10:45] fulfilling can anybody say amen to that
[10:48] that there's things that maybe don't
[10:49] dramatically change in the outside
[10:52] but something changes on the inside and
[10:54] then everything feels right
[10:56] that's what we're identifying a
[10:57] satisfaction and a fulfillment that
[10:59] comes to the believer
[11:01] and as the children of god we're we're
[11:03] moved by
[11:04] the word of god as the children of god
[11:06] were ant animated and
[11:08] moved by the spirit of god and it's in
[11:11] being
[11:11] moved by the word of god being excited
[11:14] and inspired by the spirit of god
[11:16] that is what becomes the source of our
[11:19] happiness
[11:20] when we know that we've done the right
[11:22] thing when we know we have this
[11:23] consciousness
[11:24] of the things around us a spiritual
[11:26] conscience that kind of directs us and
[11:28] says
[11:28] this is the right thing to do and then
[11:30] when we've done that regardless of what
[11:32] everyone else has to say about it
[11:34] we have a sense of satisfaction and it's
[11:37] when you're uncertain about what you're
[11:38] doing
[11:39] whether it's right or whether it's
[11:40] pleasing to the lord that's when the
[11:42] critics seem to have some weight
[11:45] it's when you're uncertain but when you
[11:46] know you've done the right thing you can
[11:48] let family reject you you can let
[11:50] friends forsake you
[11:51] you can let a lot of things begin to
[11:52] happen in the world around you
[11:54] and you say lord i know i pleased you
[11:56] and that's what really that's what
[11:58] thrills me and makes me feel good
[12:00] just as jesus said he said my meat when
[12:02] he's speaking as the son of god my meat
[12:04] is to do the will of him that sent me
[12:06] that's what fulfills that's what
[12:08] satisfies that's what energizes
[12:10] and i believe that we as spiritual sons
[12:12] and daughters of god
[12:13] need to have that kind of attitude that
[12:15] at the end of the day my
[12:16] substance my my thrill my enthusiasm my
[12:20] ambition
[12:20] is to do god's will we know that we're
[12:24] taught very well in the word of god in
[12:25] terms of identifying whether or not
[12:27] it is god's will and we can look to the
[12:30] word first and if it lines up with the
[12:31] word
[12:32] we begin to check our motive and
[12:33] objective but it's when those things are
[12:35] when we're abiding in that and we're
[12:38] in continuity with the word of god in
[12:40] harmony with the spirit of god that's
[12:41] when we can smile
[12:43] and have a real smile not something
[12:46] synthetic or
[12:46] man-made i want to identify two
[12:49] different terms stirring and revival
[12:52] because they are kind of central to the
[12:55] statement brother bannon is making in
[12:56] the third seal about how the church
[12:58] hasn't had a
[12:59] real stirring it hasn't had the and he
[13:01] says the bride hasn't had a revival yet
[13:04] stirring means a beginning to move
[13:07] when you say that um are the kids up
[13:09] well they're just beginning to stir
[13:10] there's something they're beginning
[13:12] to move it means to be an active motion
[13:14] it speaks to being animated or arousing
[13:16] up these are just the words that it
[13:17] means
[13:18] even in its etymology that it's this is
[13:20] the idea and the thought behind a stir
[13:23] beginning to a stirring it's a beginning
[13:25] to move it means to move or to excite
[13:28] so this is a moving there has not been a
[13:30] real moving yet there's got to be a
[13:32] moving
[13:32] an animation emotion as we read in the
[13:35] book of ezekiel that there was
[13:36] there was activity in that these dry
[13:38] bones begin to
[13:40] assemble themselves back together in sin
[13:42] you and muscle and flesh begin to be
[13:44] added to it
[13:45] to where you could look at and says now
[13:46] these are bodies
[13:48] and so there's been a move and there's
[13:50] been activity but it says
[13:51] that the question was can they live not
[13:54] just can they reassemble and look like
[13:56] they're living not can it just look like
[13:58] a body not can it just look like a
[13:59] church
[14:00] and function as a church but can these
[14:02] dry bones live
[14:03] and then when the word of god this
[14:05] prophecy goes forth and it's life that
[14:06] comes into it the prophecy of the word
[14:08] of god
[14:09] life comes into these these bodies that
[14:12] look like their bodies maybe look like
[14:14] they're sleeping life comes into it
[14:16] and they raise upon their feet what an
[14:18] exceeding great army
[14:20] that's the stirring not the adding to
[14:22] the bones and muscle insinion those
[14:23] things
[14:24] but when there's something that animates
[14:25] it and gives it life it moves it and
[14:27] excites it
[14:28] and it stood on its feet and exceeding
[14:30] great army
[14:32] that's that's the thoughts of a story in
[14:34] a moving
[14:35] to have a revival it's an awakening
[14:38] it's the act of reviving a revival is
[14:40] the act of reviving it so
[14:41] it speaks of living again and having
[14:44] life again
[14:45] and sometimes we as individuals and and
[14:48] i want to say this very tenderly
[14:50] we as born-again christians go through
[14:52] circumstances in our lives where we come
[14:54] up against a wall
[14:55] and we feel like we just want to live
[14:57] again any
[14:59] anybody ever felt that way before where
[15:01] it's like man i just
[15:02] i want to feel alive again i want to
[15:05] feel enthusiasm i i want to be excited
[15:07] and i've lost my enthusiasm for this and
[15:09] i've lost my enthusiasm for that
[15:11] and the word of god says that when and
[15:13] i'm saying this on a sunday to people
[15:15] who came to church today and overcame
[15:16] many obstacles so i'm not preaching to
[15:18] you i'm talking to the people on the
[15:19] internet
[15:20] where you read where god says that you
[15:22] know when the church doors are open you
[15:24] should be there
[15:25] and you find yourself just it's
[15:27] difficult sometimes and you just don't
[15:28] have the enthusiasm and you begin to
[15:30] think about all the things that keep
[15:31] your way
[15:32] and so the word of god which ought to be
[15:34] an encouragement just does what just
[15:35] seems to bury you even more
[15:37] and you find yourself just i'm just
[15:38] wanting to feel again and live again and
[15:41] enjoy
[15:41] again and have excitement and and enjoy
[15:44] the word of god and fellowship with one
[15:45] another
[15:46] and that's what god offers to you
[15:48] through the word of god
[15:50] don't despair of your election don't
[15:52] begin to doubt that god has been there
[15:54] dealing with your heart don't doubt the
[15:55] experiences you've had with the word
[15:57] don't doubt the experiences you've had
[15:59] with the holy ghost sometimes what we
[16:00] want to do is go back and re-experience
[16:02] something else
[16:03] but god says you've had that experience
[16:05] i've got something new and different for
[16:07] you
[16:08] our prayers just to be lord i want to
[16:09] live again
[16:11] help me to feel again let me live again
[16:13] but but not maybe
[16:15] something i've been before but may it be
[16:17] this time of maturing
[16:19] and a growing up that's what reviving is
[16:23] it's
[16:23] it's to regain consciousness
[16:26] sometimes it's a little bit of an
[16:27] amnesia that the spirit needs to drive
[16:29] away
[16:30] to revive it means to recover health
[16:33] speaks of
[16:34] a restoration of restoring so he says a
[16:36] real stirring and a revival it's an
[16:38] awakening it's a beginning to move it's
[16:40] an activity it's a motion
[16:42] and in the message the invisible union
[16:44] of the bride the
[16:46] heavily invisible unit of the bride of
[16:48] christ he says some of you people
[16:49] that really believe this to be the truth
[16:53] think of how we're saying this some of
[16:54] you people that really believe this to
[16:56] be the truth
[16:57] that we are entering another age
[17:01] that's a that's uh for people who are
[17:03] well read that all of a sudden becomes a
[17:05] very interesting statement
[17:07] we're entering the rapture age you know
[17:10] the church can't go in its condition
[17:11] and it can't get any better it must get
[17:13] worse i think of the parallel now to
[17:16] where the church in its condition
[17:17] it's just going to get worse he says how
[17:19] many knows that say amen it's got to get
[17:21] worse in other words
[17:22] no matter how good it is it doesn't have
[17:24] what it takes to get gooder
[17:26] right it's just going it's bad getting
[17:29] worse
[17:30] so there there has to be the crossing of
[17:33] something
[17:34] and the moving beyond something entering
[17:36] into something else to where it's
[17:38] it's all it's good getting better it has
[17:40] to be that way he says it can't go like
[17:42] this
[17:42] it's god and he he's and you say where
[17:44] do you get that from well i kind of read
[17:46] beforehand
[17:47] i know where he's going with this he
[17:48] says how many knows that say amen it's
[17:50] going to get worse it can't go like
[17:52] it's got to be something so there's
[17:55] something coming there's
[17:56] got to be something that comes to the
[17:58] church and it's moving
[18:00] right now friend this is exciting
[18:03] it's on the move is on for the bride
[18:06] that's the truth i love this that thus
[18:09] saith the lord we have thus saith the
[18:13] lord that the
[18:14] move is on for the bride
[18:17] we're not sitting around waiting for it
[18:19] we have thus
[18:20] saith the lord taking place the
[18:23] something had come this is the truth
[18:27] we entered into another time in another
[18:30] season
[18:30] the move is on for the bride what is it
[18:32] it's a real stirring
[18:35] it's the bride's revival this this he's
[18:38] saying
[18:38] has come do you believe that
[18:42] you believe that god has made available
[18:44] to you today
[18:46] an opportunity to be stirred to be
[18:48] enthused to be excited
[18:49] about the things of god now as brother
[18:52] branham is using this language he's
[18:54] saying how the seven thunders hold
[18:57] this revelation of jesus christ to give
[18:59] life to give
[19:00] joy to give peace this is all these
[19:03] fruits of the spirit and these
[19:05] wonderful things that we read about in
[19:06] the word of god that there's a
[19:08] there's a discipline that we have to
[19:10] have in the scriptures
[19:12] that when we see god doing something and
[19:14] he's fulfilling the word of god we
[19:16] you have to recognize that there's
[19:18] things that are in the word of god that
[19:19] are permanent
[19:20] and there's things that must proportion
[19:23] and when god begins to move and to do
[19:25] something
[19:25] and we're entering a rapture age engine
[19:27] of the rapture he's doesn't mean we're
[19:28] leaving divine healing behind
[19:30] could you imagine that i was having this
[19:33] fellowship with brother tim pruitt here
[19:34] recently
[19:35] and how that when i was in the uh when i
[19:37] raised in the message we believe in
[19:39] divine healing
[19:40] and so whenever you read in the uh in
[19:42] the word of god where it says and that
[19:44] denying divine healing and believing
[19:46] the days of miracles are passed it's
[19:47] like well we believe in miracles we see
[19:49] miracles
[19:50] how can there be a people that believe
[19:52] the days of miracles are passed and then
[19:54] the more you
[19:55] learn and the more you understand in the
[19:56] in the economical world and the in the
[19:58] secular world and the world around us
[20:00] and then even sometimes it begins to
[20:02] kind of creep into those we fellowship
[20:03] with
[20:04] to think that well because this has
[20:05] happened the days of miracles are past
[20:08] and we have to we have to be very
[20:10] disciplined in the word of god to say
[20:12] let's just say that god there's a
[20:14] prophecy in the word that
[20:16] billions of people are looking to that
[20:18] this is going to be fulfilled this is
[20:20] one day going to happen
[20:21] when it begins to dawn on us that god is
[20:23] fulfilling his word
[20:25] we have to realize that this fits within
[20:27] the context and the whole of god's word
[20:30] and so when we talk about oh the word of
[20:31] god in the last days
[20:33] whatever's in the word of god is a part
[20:35] of that word
[20:37] and we can't we don't want to separate
[20:39] ourselves from the fruits of the spirit
[20:40] and in life and joy and peace and
[20:43] overcoming and holiness and
[20:45] sanctification
[20:46] and those things are all part of this
[20:48] great climactic move of god
[20:50] to translate your body into a brand new
[20:53] one
[20:55] and so it's those may seem to be real
[20:58] spiritual real theological these seven
[21:01] thunders which reveal jesus christ
[21:03] but in revealing him it gives you life
[21:05] and reveal him it gives you joy
[21:07] and revealing him it gives you peace but
[21:10] ram says on the first seal and i don't
[21:12] believe i have this statement there
[21:13] because it's a real short man
[21:14] short statement i believe that through
[21:16] those seven thunders will be revealed in
[21:18] the last days
[21:19] in order to get the bride together for
[21:21] rapturing faith
[21:23] i think that's just real good summary
[21:24] language to say well uh
[21:26] you're taken out of context well this is
[21:28] a statement it's very direct he's given
[21:30] us a definition
[21:31] seven thunders will be revealed in order
[21:34] to or for the purpose of getting the
[21:35] bride together so
[21:36] the revelation contained in that word
[21:39] gathers the bride together
[21:41] and it brings rapturing faith
[21:46] now this is i've been saying this uh
[21:49] a few times already don't get mysterious
[21:52] with it don't try to make yourself
[21:55] different
[21:56] think very practical think very
[22:00] practical
[22:00] think about the things that matter to
[22:02] you in this life think about the things
[22:04] that weigh upon your soul think about
[22:05] the decisions you're having to make
[22:06] think about
[22:07] raising your children loving your wife
[22:10] think about uh uh
[22:11] all the things that relate to this
[22:12] natural life and instead of getting in
[22:14] your minds that there's some sort of
[22:16] virtual reality that we're trying to
[22:18] enter into and i'm just gonna detach
[22:20] myself
[22:20] from laodicea and i'm gonna live in this
[22:23] fake that's not fake
[22:24] but this world of my faith imagine faith
[22:27] and this hope
[22:28] and i'm going to live detached in this
[22:29] realm over here and somewhere in there
[22:31] all the sevens line up and all the
[22:33] threes line up and then we enter into an
[22:35] eight and then we have this and we have
[22:36] that
[22:37] and it's just this some other world over
[22:39] here very ethereal
[22:40] that we're trying to live inside of and
[22:42] then we're missing the whole point in
[22:44] the whole thing
[22:44] it's very very practical
[22:47] it's very practical these things when
[22:49] you begin to talk about the seven seals
[22:50] and the open of the word of god and the
[22:52] third poll
[22:53] in the reveal and the son of man we go
[22:55] wow
[22:56] that's really really deep well it's very
[22:58] very practical
[22:59] extremely practical and so don't don't
[23:03] so think practically today if you've had
[23:05] a prayer if you've had a need if you
[23:06] have something in your life that you
[23:08] feel that god
[23:08] needs to address he's going to do it
[23:10] through the word of god
[23:12] and he's going to do it through opening
[23:13] up the word of god to your hearts and
[23:14] giving you understanding
[23:16] in the word of god so there's a lot it
[23:17] goes into it and i say well you know i
[23:19] really want to understand the seven
[23:20] seals but i'm really having a hard time
[23:22] knowing how to raise my kids
[23:23] if you could just somehow not think of
[23:25] those being two separate things
[23:27] but realizing what you really want at
[23:29] the end today is the mind of christ how
[23:31] to address
[23:32] emotional needs in your family and how
[23:34] to address rebellion or hardness
[23:36] of heart and your children and what you
[23:37] really need at the end of the day is the
[23:39] revelation of jesus christ
[23:41] to come and connect with your love of
[23:43] god you have for your children
[23:44] and give you the direction that you need
[23:47] and those aren't two separate things
[23:49] one's a need and the other's the
[23:51] solution
[23:53] and these things can harmonize and line
[23:55] right up maybe we've created this
[23:57] dichotomy in the message where you have
[23:58] the deep preachers and you have the
[24:00] practical preachers wow
[24:01] let those brothers do the marriage
[24:03] banquet let them do the men's meetings
[24:05] let them do the marriage counseling
[24:06] and then we've got these brothers over
[24:07] here that can dig into the deep things
[24:09] listen
[24:09] the time has come to where they are one
[24:12] and the same
[24:13] and there's not a dichotomy where it
[24:15] comes to where the word of god is
[24:16] leading and where the spirit of god is
[24:18] leading
[24:18] is because we need that revealed word to
[24:21] come to bear on the things that
[24:23] matter
[24:27] and there's not a separation maybe we
[24:28] need to kind of change our attitude a
[24:30] little bit towards certain ministries
[24:32] that really emphasized certain truths
[24:34] and certain things
[24:35] and maybe we put these in the chat oh
[24:37] they're just a deep preacher well
[24:38] they're just a simple preacher
[24:39] maybe you begin to realize that the deep
[24:40] preachers dealing with simple things
[24:42] and the simple preachers making a deep
[24:44] impact in people's lives and not make
[24:46] them two different camps or two
[24:47] different approaches
[24:48] but all the word of god for the benefit
[24:50] of the bride to come to rapturing faith
[24:54] now revisiting again the message
[24:56] invisible union we had read from
[24:58] paragraph 379
[25:00] i'm going to read from two places
[25:01] paragraph 49 and then paragraph 202
[25:04] just so you can see how some things that
[25:06] we will read in the message of the hour
[25:08] where it appears as if brother branham
[25:10] even late in his ministry
[25:11] is saying something that projects
[25:13] something way into the future
[25:14] so we could take that steps oh well
[25:16] brother man said we're looking for it
[25:17] and this was in november of 1965
[25:20] and you find that within the same
[25:21] message he kind of closes that loop
[25:24] and and the very thing is trying to
[25:26] condition the people to open their eyes
[25:27] to consider and see
[25:28] he closes it at the very end and says
[25:30] and what i told you you were
[25:31] looking for in the beginning do you see
[25:34] it now in the end
[25:35] he brings that out so he says but watch
[25:37] when the spiritual bride when she begins
[25:39] to have a
[25:40] revival now he says it later on in
[25:44] paragraph 379 the move is
[25:46] on for the bribe her stirring her move
[25:49] her awakening
[25:50] the move is on for the bride so earlier
[25:52] in the message he says when that
[25:53] spiritual bride when she begins to have
[25:54] revival
[25:55] when she begins to come back and
[25:58] line herself up with the word of god
[26:01] that's all it takes for you to have a
[26:02] revival in your life
[26:04] just line yourself up with the word of
[26:05] god you've been praying for revival
[26:07] then ask yourself where do i know i'm
[26:09] not lining up with the word of god and
[26:11] just line yourself up
[26:13] that's all it takes for revivals someone
[26:14] the other day confessed to me they said
[26:16] they they they said that they were
[26:17] backslid i'd asked them a very simple
[26:19] question they said i'm backslid i'm like
[26:20] whoa
[26:21] tmi i was just wanting to know i had a
[26:24] simple question and now you really
[26:25] opened up to me
[26:26] but the reality was they confessed that
[26:28] because they were doing they were not
[26:29] doing
[26:30] one thing that they knew god wanted to
[26:32] do they were backslid and you know
[26:33] what's so awesome about that
[26:35] if they want to have revival all they
[26:37] have to do is do what they know they
[26:38] should do
[26:39] and it can bring a revival so this is
[26:41] part of the bride's revival coming back
[26:44] and lining ourselves up with the word of
[26:45] god when that happens watch
[26:47] then again you see how the scriptures at
[26:49] that time there'll be a message sweep
[26:51] out
[26:52] to catch that bride catch that woman
[26:55] elect
[26:56] so there's a message that catches as he
[26:58] says it's going to be those
[27:00] uh seven known unknown thunders that
[27:02] wake her up again and give her that
[27:03] revival it's the seven
[27:05] thunders that gather the bride together
[27:08] get the bride together for rapturing
[27:09] faith he's saying it's the message that
[27:11] goes out and catches
[27:13] so paragraph 49 it seems to be kind of
[27:16] future looking
[27:17] that when she begins when she does
[27:20] there will be but now notice paragraph
[27:22] 202 remember
[27:24] what time is it sir how many ever heard
[27:26] it he's going back to what he preached
[27:28] at the end of 62 and i had some
[27:29] statements from that sermon but i
[27:30] realized
[27:31] i i don't need to substantiate that in
[27:33] great detail we'll just make reference
[27:35] say say amen if you heard it what was it
[27:37] exactly
[27:38] and in that he's talking about the seven
[27:40] thunder's coming to gather
[27:42] together the elect he says then we've
[27:43] got now how he says it
[27:45] then we've got the revelation in the
[27:47] last days for the message of the lord
[27:49] god to gather his bride together
[27:52] he says in one hand it's going to come
[27:55] and now he says we've got it we've got
[27:58] the message of the lord god to gather
[28:00] his bride together
[28:01] so the elements that are necessary to
[28:03] gather the bride together are not a
[28:05] future promise in that we're still
[28:07] waiting for a point in time in a
[28:10] juncture to pass to where
[28:11] once time has come to this place and we
[28:13] begin to enter this rapture and age
[28:15] that's when this is going to be made
[28:16] available but it's just like it was when
[28:18] he told the disciples to go
[28:19] and tarry in jerusalem until and what
[28:23] did they have to wait until
[28:24] until the day of pentecost because that
[28:27] was a particular junction in time and
[28:29] then so they waited until that time and
[28:31] then once that time came
[28:33] the spirit of god was poured out upon
[28:35] them from that moment on it became
[28:37] from then on until the rapture the age
[28:39] of the holy ghost for the true believer
[28:41] and nobody has ever been waiting for a
[28:44] day on the calendar in that sense
[28:46] ever again because the fullness of time
[28:49] had come this time had come
[28:50] where it reached this point where now
[28:52] god says now i'm transitioning and he
[28:54] poured out a spirit
[28:55] from that point on you can walk in that
[28:57] now we could say that there's many
[28:59] came along and then the gospel turned to
[29:01] the gentiles and there was times where
[29:03] other people came into the revelation of
[29:04] it
[29:05] and it's in that same sense i know i'm
[29:07] going really fast but i'm inspired
[29:08] it's in that same sense that there comes
[29:11] a point in time where we say we've
[29:12] entered into a new dispensation
[29:14] the message has come to gather the bride
[29:16] together and though it took
[29:18] decades before we were gathered the time
[29:21] had come
[29:22] and the season was now and we're walking
[29:25] in that
[29:25] and living in that and i believe there's
[29:29] others that need to hear
[29:31] about the gathering and can benefit from
[29:33] it
[29:35] so he says we got the revelation the
[29:37] move is on thus saith the lord the move
[29:39] is on for the bride
[29:40] he says in the fourth seal there's a
[29:41] power now this is where i realize now
[29:44] in my mind it makes perfect sense but
[29:45] now i want to connect this back
[29:47] to he says there's a revelation in the
[29:49] last days
[29:50] and i'm wanting to see this as a child
[29:52] of god what inspires you
[29:54] what thrills you if you felt like
[29:55] something's been lacking in your heart
[29:57] it might just be simply understanding
[30:00] something
[30:01] again nothing needs to change you just
[30:02] need to understand i'm looking
[30:04] too much to the natural things for my
[30:06] joy i'm looking too much
[30:08] to natural signs and natural wonders i'm
[30:10] looking too much to natural factors
[30:12] when i can just look to god fulfilling
[30:14] his word
[30:15] and that stimulates me
[30:18] job may never change raise may never
[30:20] come
[30:21] borders may never open that vacation you
[30:24] paid for to go to europe
[30:25] may never may never be used all these
[30:27] other things may never happen
[30:29] but when you see god with fulfilling his
[30:30] word then there's something a deep
[30:32] contentment
[30:33] a deep satisfaction saying lord i know i
[30:36] know you're with me
[30:37] but tomorrow i don't have any word on
[30:39] the lord about vacations or europe so
[30:40] you just whatever god's
[30:42] whatever before i know he loves to
[30:43] travel and i think they got a vacation
[30:44] coming up you know i hope the lord makes
[30:46] a way for you
[30:47] but that's the way we have to be right
[30:49] hey even if all these other things
[30:51] aren't happening when we can see that
[30:52] the word of god is being fulfilled that
[30:54] brings my contentment
[30:55] that brings my joy and he says it this
[30:57] way there's a lot more that can be
[30:58] shared in this but i just wanted to
[30:59] say it just to bring that impact there's
[31:01] a power of the revelation of the word
[31:03] that gives stimulation of joy to the
[31:05] believer
[31:07] there's this access to something there's
[31:09] the power of the revelation of the word
[31:11] that gives stimulation
[31:12] of joy to the believer stimulation of
[31:15] satisfaction
[31:16] the stimulation that it's vindicated
[31:18] it's proved
[31:20] have you ever watched somebody and maybe
[31:22] this could be said more to us um
[31:24] our the boring parents those of us here
[31:26] who don't connect with the youth of
[31:28] today
[31:28] and we see them doing something like you
[31:31] enjoy
[31:32] that that's fun and like oh yeah this is
[31:35] just amazing this is awesome
[31:36] you just kind of look at it going i i
[31:39] don't
[31:40] i don't see what's in it i i don't get
[31:41] it but people can just be
[31:43] enthus enthusiastic about it really
[31:45] really loving it doesn't have to be
[31:46] the kids i think sometimes the kids look
[31:48] at us adults like you like that
[31:50] that's boring anyways different people
[31:53] could be stimulated by different things
[31:54] and entertained by different things like
[31:56] oh
[31:56] i'm gonna go bird watching and i'm gonna
[31:58] sit around and watch birds and they got
[32:00] the binoculars and they got the book and
[32:01] they're part of the national autobahn
[32:02] society and they just they just love it
[32:04] right and like yeah i mean i i'm part of
[32:08] the grass growing society i love to
[32:09] watch grass grow and some people just
[32:11] have different things that excite them
[32:13] enthu
[32:14] and give them enthusiasm but notice this
[32:16] there's a power of revelation of the
[32:17] word
[32:18] this is for every believer there is a
[32:21] stimulation
[32:22] there is a source of enthusiasm there's
[32:24] a source of ambition there's something
[32:26] that can give you get you out of bed in
[32:28] the morning no matter what you're going
[32:29] through
[32:30] there's a power of the revelation of the
[32:31] word of god there's a lot like what
[32:33] a natural body that gives stimulation of
[32:36] joy to the believer
[32:37] stimulation of satisfaction the
[32:39] stimulation that it's vindicated it's
[32:41] proved
[32:43] praise the lord i believe sometimes what
[32:46] the devil wants to do with us is not
[32:48] merely
[32:49] uh not just completely destroy our lives
[32:52] but just give us this sense
[32:53] of accepting delayed joy
[32:57] and lord you can't you can't convince me
[32:59] this isn't right you can't convince me
[33:01] that this is
[33:01] not a promise you can't convince or this
[33:03] is a promise that's not for me there's
[33:05] just a way that maybe the devil says
[33:06] well i'm going to leave you alone in
[33:08] that but if there's just a way that he
[33:09] can get us to this place of
[33:11] your joy is delayed
[33:15] your hope is delayed what what you're
[33:18] wanting what you're looking for what you
[33:20] want to have what you want to see
[33:21] well it's it's not going to happen for a
[33:23] while and since it's not going to happen
[33:24] for a while then you can't receive the
[33:26] benefit of it
[33:27] you can't be happy about it you can't uh
[33:29] you can't be enthused
[33:31] you realize in the scripture paul
[33:33] preaches and he says he talked about the
[33:34] joy
[33:35] and the uh of the of the coming of the
[33:38] lord and a joy
[33:39] that they ought to have just expecting
[33:41] it there was a joy and enthusiasm that
[33:44] the believer could have
[33:45] just expecting the promise to come so
[33:48] if if something has not yet come and
[33:50] you've received it faith is the evidence
[33:52] of it
[33:53] right faith being the evidence of it
[33:55] gives you substance that you can
[33:56] celebrate
[33:57] of with and you can be happy of just as
[34:00] abraham and sarah could have just been
[34:02] just
[34:02] as excited that a baby was coming
[34:04] without any evidence of it
[34:06] and been happy and joyful and encouraged
[34:08] and looking forward to it
[34:09] that's the way that we ought to be and
[34:11] not allow the devil
[34:12] to get us to accept some delayed joy
[34:16] because when he does that we become
[34:17] unsettled we come become a little bit
[34:19] restless and i think what satan tries to
[34:22] preach sometimes to us is someday
[34:25] has anybody heard his sermon someday
[34:28] recently
[34:29] have you heard anybody heard his sermon
[34:30] someday he preaches it to us all the
[34:32] time
[34:33] i mean he's on part 100 billion
[34:36] right i mean brother donnie reagan's got
[34:38] nothing on the devil when it comes to
[34:40] continuing a series i mean this is this
[34:42] is somebody
[34:43] who preaches it all the time someday
[34:46] someday someday
[34:53] now i want to look at nehemiah chapter
[34:57] nehemiah chapter 8
[35:00] and let me just give some real quick
[35:03] summary language about the
[35:04] nehemiah it's a time of revival
[35:07] children of israel in bondage exiled
[35:10] in babylon and now they're granted this
[35:14] leave to come back and build back the
[35:16] walls of jerusalem
[35:18] and there's it's an incredible story of
[35:20] god restoring and building back
[35:23] and i believe it's even some say that
[35:25] the book
[35:26] like the book of esther is you know in
[35:28] this chronology it fits there between
[35:30] the sixth and seventh chapter so you can
[35:31] see that there's a time
[35:32] when children are in babylon they're in
[35:34] captivity
[35:35] these are the things that are taking
[35:37] place uh uh
[35:38] the walls have been torn down they were
[35:40] worshiping false gods and false idols
[35:42] they've been taken captive because of
[35:43] that so as a direct result of their
[35:45] disobedience
[35:46] that they're made captives in babylon
[35:47] but god just grants this moves upon the
[35:50] king's heart and they're allowed to go
[35:51] back
[35:52] and begin to build back the walls and
[35:54] there's a there's people that oppose it
[35:57] there's these three different ones is
[35:58] sambaloft and these different ones are
[36:00] coming against them trying to intimidate
[36:01] them and threaten them and
[36:02] uh and sending letters and wanting to
[36:04] get them to meet in the valley of
[36:06] of oh no and all these different ways
[36:08] that they're trying to come against them
[36:10] and so what we we're seeing in the book
[36:12] of nehemiah is a restoration
[36:14] restoration of the things of god it is a
[36:16] revival it's the people coming back to
[36:19] the word
[36:19] and lining up with the word of god and
[36:22] as we've read already how that there's
[36:24] going to be a message that gathers the
[36:26] people together this
[36:27] verse 1 stands out to me it says in
[36:29] nehemiah chapter 8 verse 1 and all the
[36:31] people gathered themselves together as
[36:33] one man into the street
[36:35] that was before the watergate and they
[36:37] spake unto ezra the scribe to bring the
[36:40] book of the law of moses
[36:41] which the lord had commanded to israel
[36:44] now when you read this
[36:45] i want this to stand out to you it just
[36:47] says all the people gathered themselves
[36:49] together
[36:51] when you read that it
[36:54] is only the people that are mentioned
[36:58] and then the people speak to ezra to get
[37:00] the book
[37:02] so the gathering this is a supernatural
[37:04] gathering
[37:06] this is a gathering that is not inspired
[37:08] it's not done
[37:10] it doesn't say it was done by nehemiah
[37:11] it doesn't say it was done by ezra but
[37:12] this was a gathering that was done by
[37:14] god
[37:14] he caused the people to be gathered
[37:16] together and the desire of the people
[37:17] was that the word would be brought forth
[37:20] bring us the word anything that we've
[37:21] lost anything that's been taken away
[37:23] anything that's been hid the people
[37:25] gather themselves together
[37:27] as one man that's got to be a
[37:30] supernatural gathering
[37:31] where people could come together as one
[37:33] and then something is moving in their
[37:34] hearts they're all in
[37:35] one spirit in one accord and they're all
[37:37] gathered together one heart one mind one
[37:39] accord
[37:40] all gathered together as one man and
[37:42] they've got thousands of this place
[37:43] this is god that's bringing them
[37:45] together
[37:46] and you'll find a parallel prophecy in
[37:48] zephaniah chapter 3
[37:50] verses 14 to 20. and when i read this
[37:53] just pick up on the principles because i
[37:55] just want to read through it as we run
[37:56] out of time
[37:57] saying oh daughter of zion and brother
[38:00] brown says in one place zion is the
[38:01] bride
[38:02] always the bride is what he says in that
[38:04] one place a daughter's eye shout o
[38:06] israel be glad and rejoice with all the
[38:09] heart
[38:10] oh daughter of jerusalem the lord hath
[38:12] taken away thy judgments he have cast
[38:14] out thine enemy the king of israel even
[38:16] the lord is in the midst of thee
[38:18] oh praise the lord thou shalt not see
[38:20] evil anymore
[38:22] in that day it shall be said to
[38:23] jerusalem fear not and to zion
[38:26] let not thy hands be slack
[38:29] take this as prophecy to you as an
[38:31] individual prophecy to the bride
[38:33] be glad and rejoice with all your heart
[38:35] because the lord is in the midst of thee
[38:37] let these hands that have been bound and
[38:39] been hanging down let them be raised
[38:41] verse 17 the lord thy god in the midst
[38:44] of thee is mighty
[38:45] he will save he will rejoice over thee
[38:48] with joy
[38:49] he will rest in his love he will joy
[38:52] over thee with singing this is the
[38:54] attitude of a bridegroom to his bride
[38:57] he will rest in his love he will rejoice
[39:00] over thee with joy
[39:02] he will joy over thee with singing what
[39:04] will that produce in you a same joy
[39:06] the same rest the same love and he says
[39:09] i
[39:10] will gather them not man not man's
[39:12] revival not
[39:13] teaching not organization not ecumenical
[39:16] moves
[39:16] i will gather them that are sorrowful
[39:18] for the solemn assembly who are
[39:20] who are of thee to whom the reproach of
[39:22] it was a burden
[39:23] behold at that time i will undo all that
[39:26] afflict thee
[39:27] i will save her that halteth and gather
[39:30] her
[39:30] that was driven out and i will get them
[39:33] praise and fame in every land where they
[39:34] have been put to shame
[39:36] at that time will i bring you again
[39:39] the lord bringing against zion restoring
[39:42] back the bride
[39:43] bringing her back for her revival even
[39:46] in the time that i
[39:48] gather you says the people gather
[39:51] themselves together this was god doing
[39:53] it
[39:54] this was god bringing them back for the
[39:56] restoration of the temple
[39:58] the restoration of these walls i will
[40:00] bring you again
[40:01] for i will make you a name and a praise
[40:03] among all the people of the earth when i
[40:04] turn
[40:05] back your captivity before your eyes
[40:07] saith the lord
[40:09] and just as we see in the scripture
[40:11] nehemiah chapter 8 that the
[40:12] they were gathered together as one man
[40:15] and we see in zephaniah that it
[40:16] prophesies that he will bring you again
[40:18] and gather you together
[40:19] it's the exact language that god is
[40:21] using this end time that there's going
[40:22] to be a message to gather the bride
[40:24] together
[40:26] maybe there was a time we thought we'd
[40:28] all gather in some particular place
[40:29] right
[40:30] well everyone's going to move to tucson
[40:31] or everyone's going to move to lima
[40:33] everybody's going to move here it's not
[40:35] geographical saints it's not
[40:38] geographical maybe the borders shut down
[40:39] just so that we don't get in our minds
[40:41] that we're all got to end up
[40:42] somewhere in some place and that's where
[40:44] the bride has gathered she's gathered in
[40:46] christ
[40:47] she's gathered the entrance is
[40:49] ministered unto her no matter where she
[40:50] is in the jungles
[40:52] of south america if she's in the the
[40:54] deserts of africa whatever it may be the
[40:56] word is going to find her
[40:58] and bring her to the place where the
[41:00] bride is gathered
[41:04] and so as they gather together as one
[41:06] man
[41:08] the word of god gathering them to the
[41:09] word to himself
[41:11] it says in verse five and ezra opened
[41:14] the book and the sight of all the people
[41:16] for he was above all the people it says
[41:17] he opened the book everyone saw that the
[41:19] book was opened
[41:21] you catch that that's exactly how this
[41:24] had to be when they were all gathered
[41:25] gathered together as one man and god
[41:27] brings the spiritual gathering
[41:28] ezra opened the book inside of all the
[41:30] people and everyone could agree
[41:32] he opened the book is open there was
[41:35] nobody beginning well
[41:36] no i don't think he's opened it they did
[41:38] it in such a way god when they brought
[41:39] him together and they seated everybody
[41:41] and raised him up
[41:42] they could see that he had opened it and
[41:44] it was once they
[41:45] knew the book was open all the people
[41:48] stood up
[41:49] take these things into your heart today
[41:51] and make spiritual application yourself
[41:53] this is such a beautiful scene when ezra
[41:55] who is a scribe and a priest he comes
[41:56] and he opens the book
[41:58] and as people's book was opened that's
[42:00] what caused them to
[42:02] stand to their feet maybe someone was
[42:04] talking at the time and they were just
[42:06] saying well i don't know did we bring
[42:07] enough bread or what you know this is
[42:08] really neat look at all the oh so-and-so
[42:10] is here in that gray
[42:11] someone's here people start standing up
[42:12] and like man why is why is everybody
[42:14] standing up and then you look up you see
[42:15] the book's been opened
[42:16] and so you stand up too
[42:21] and as the as you continue to read this
[42:24] in this particular chapter ezra reads
[42:26] the books of the law
[42:28] and then the teachers teach from the
[42:30] book of the law
[42:32] and the word is made plain and it's made
[42:35] plain to them as they read
[42:36] genesis exodus leviticus numbers
[42:39] deuteronomy they were there
[42:41] for a long time as you read in the bible
[42:42] they were there listening to the word
[42:44] being read now think of it if you could
[42:45] somehow put yourself in their position
[42:48] they here they are exiled into strange
[42:50] lands these things they believed have
[42:52] been lost they're not worshiping in the
[42:53] temple anymore they're worshiping
[42:55] strange gods
[42:56] and then they're being restored back and
[42:57] they're building up the walls of
[42:58] jerusalem
[42:59] and then god supernaturally gathers them
[43:00] together and they say go get the books
[43:02] of the law of moses
[43:04] get what our prophet had written want to
[43:06] hear it and they start reading
[43:08] genesis exodus leviticus
[43:11] numbers deuteronomy these books start to
[43:13] be read out to the people
[43:14] and they start hearing the book of the
[43:16] law and as they're being reading these
[43:18] things
[43:18] he's actually telling them their church
[43:20] history
[43:22] and actually showing them the prophets
[43:24] that god had sent to him the prophet
[43:26] he sent and the judges that they had and
[43:27] the different things that are taking
[43:29] place
[43:29] and how god is dealing with their hearts
[43:30] and brings them out and they're learning
[43:32] everything god had established to bring
[43:34] them to the land of
[43:35] their promise so they could see now
[43:38] their church history
[43:40] they could see the word that they were
[43:41] given and how their fathers had fallen
[43:43] away from it
[43:44] and now they could understand why they
[43:45] were in bondage well we could never
[43:47] figure out why we're in babylon
[43:48] now we know god sent a prophet he gave
[43:50] us a word he had a word that we had
[43:51] abide by
[43:52] and the word actually says if you don't
[43:54] keep this i'll allow your enemies to
[43:55] come and drag you into bondage and now
[43:57] they can begin to see this is what the
[43:59] word says
[43:59] this is what happened and this is where
[44:01] we are it's as if they're hearing their
[44:03] church ages read out to them
[44:05] they're hearing their church history
[44:07] they know exactly where they are and one
[44:09] thing to notice here
[44:10] this book of nehemiah comes and malachi
[44:13] is a contemporary to nehemiah
[44:14] this has come at the very end of the old
[44:16] testament even though it may be in your
[44:18] bibles
[44:18] kind of front loaded this has happened
[44:20] at the very end and it's their failure
[44:22] after this that requires malachi to
[44:25] prophesy
[44:26] god will turn to the gentiles
[44:29] and the book of malachi is actually the
[44:31] strongest argument
[44:32] of the gospel turning to the gentiles of
[44:35] any book in the old testament because
[44:36] it's malachi chapter 1 that says my name
[44:39] is going to now be great among the
[44:40] gentiles and that becomes the prophet
[44:43] that turns
[44:43] everything back to the gen or to the
[44:46] gentiles
[44:46] and that's why the that very book ends
[44:49] with prophecy
[44:50] to a gentile people behold i send you
[44:53] elijah the prophet so these are the
[44:55] things that are taking place
[44:56] they can stand there and they hear and
[44:57] they understand oh
[44:59] this is why we are where we are this is
[45:01] what's happened to the ages this is
[45:03] what's happened through these
[45:04] years and the response to the people was
[45:05] to mourn
[45:07] as you read in the bible you said they
[45:08] weep and they lament there's a lamenting
[45:10] that takes place
[45:11] and they're sorry oh what have we done
[45:13] what have we done
[45:15] look at what's happened but god desired
[45:17] something otherwise
[45:19] you would think that that god would be
[45:21] like yeah you better you better repent
[45:24] you better weep you better you better
[45:27] beat yourself up and
[45:29] and and let me know you mean business
[45:32] i don't think you're serious until you
[45:34] start crying no god wasn't going to let
[45:36] him wallow in it he desired something
[45:37] different
[45:39] because he understood what it
[45:40] represented he knew he knew that this is
[45:42] this is how the person
[45:44] that when you come and begin to line up
[45:45] with the word of god it's the revival
[45:47] not a pity party
[45:51] you find some times that when they when
[45:52] they find out you you it and
[45:54] i think this happens with correcting our
[45:56] children that there's a point at which
[45:58] you correct them
[45:59] and then they can just wallow in the
[46:01] sorry it's like no no no
[46:03] no no we've corrected it we've addressed
[46:05] it let's go forward let's do it right
[46:08] and we could be the same way as
[46:09] christians that we we realize we're
[46:11] wrong and maybe we
[46:12] we enjoy the fact that we were able to
[46:14] finally repent
[46:16] look i realize it now i'm sorry forgive
[46:18] me lord i've done wrong and we enjoy
[46:20] that feeling so we kind of want to nurse
[46:21] that a little bit and feel sorry for
[46:23] ourselves and really
[46:24] lean into it yeah i'm really sorry yeah
[46:26] i'm really and there's a point in which
[46:28] god says
[46:28] yes you brought fruit meat of repentance
[46:31] you're sorry you're repentful
[46:33] but there's got to come a joy that
[46:35] follows
[46:36] there's a recovery from that there's a
[46:38] moving forward don't stay in that
[46:40] condition all the time
[46:41] don't stay in that place all the time
[46:43] listen if god wanted us to live at the
[46:45] altar
[46:45] he would tell us to live at the altar
[46:47] but what we do is we come to an
[46:49] altar to make things right to to have
[46:51] that time with god but then he wants us
[46:53] to take him
[46:54] from the altar back to where we live
[47:05] and so he says in verse verse 9
[47:08] and nehemiah which is the tashatha and
[47:09] ezra the priest the scribe
[47:12] and the levites that taught the people
[47:13] said unto all the people because in
[47:14] verse eight they're
[47:15] lamenting they're crying they're willing
[47:17] oh it says
[47:18] this day is holy unto the lord your god
[47:21] mourn
[47:21] not nor weep for all the people wept
[47:25] when they heard the words of the law
[47:26] so as the word was being restored back
[47:28] to them their instinct was right to weep
[47:31] they ought to have been sorrowful like
[47:33] if they would have said yeah we've had
[47:34] this figured out yeah that was easy yeah
[47:35] we knew that ah this is old news and god
[47:38] would not have been pleased but yet they
[47:39] had this contriteness
[47:41] but now the message is okay you've heard
[47:43] it you recognize you're not there
[47:45] but recognize your day that you're
[47:46] living in this is not a day of mourning
[47:48] this is not a day of weeping
[47:50] it says so don't don't don't mourn nor
[47:53] weep then he said unto them verse 10
[47:55] go your way eat the fat and drink the
[47:57] sweet
[47:58] and send portions unto them for whom
[48:00] nothing is prepared this isn't a time
[48:02] of woe is me and we're so sorry this is
[48:04] a time of feasting this is a time of
[48:06] celebrating
[48:07] this is a time to enjoy the many
[48:09] benefits of god
[48:10] and he says this he says for this day
[48:14] the lord this day is holy unto our lord
[48:17] he's sorry don't be sorrowful don't be
[48:20] crying
[48:21] don't be cast down for the joy of the
[48:23] lord is your strength
[48:25] his happiness his excitement his
[48:27] enthusiasm
[48:28] his love his passion his zeal is your
[48:31] strength
[48:33] as it said the lord thy god is in the
[48:35] midst of thee he is mighty
[48:36] he will save he will rejoice over thee
[48:39] with joy he will rest in his love
[48:41] he will joy over thee with singing then
[48:43] it's the joy of the lord that is our
[48:45] strength
[48:45] as he rejoices over us with singing as
[48:48] he rests in his love
[48:49] as he rejoices over us with joy that
[48:51] becomes our strength
[48:54] it please god to see them call be
[48:56] brought together
[48:57] ask for the word of god to be expressed
[48:59] of their hearts every single one of them
[49:01] understand and begin to repent and that
[49:03] please god he says now
[49:05] now that you've repented now that you
[49:06] have eyes have now that you've been
[49:08] clothed
[49:09] now that you have gold come unto me and
[49:11] fellowship with me
[49:12] behold i stand at the door and knock
[49:14] don't always just be wallowing
[49:16] in the sins of laodicea but now there
[49:18] comes something
[49:19] where we enter into a different time of
[49:21] fellowship
[49:23] hallelujah he says the joy of the lord
[49:26] is your strength
[49:28] and then the levites they answer the
[49:29] same thing they don't have a different
[49:31] message
[49:32] they answer the same thing saying hold
[49:35] your peace for the day is holy neither
[49:36] be you grieved
[49:38] and all the people went their way to eat
[49:39] and to drink and to send portions
[49:42] and to make great mirth
[49:45] we use that phrase all the time right
[49:47] what are you guys doing all we're just
[49:48] making great murph
[49:50] what is that vegan
[49:55] you're making great mirth great joy
[49:59] because they had understood the words
[50:01] that were declared unto them
[50:04] they rejoiced in understanding it even
[50:06] though even though it might have exposed
[50:08] a shortcoming
[50:10] even though it might have exposed the
[50:11] heirs of their fathers they they rejoice
[50:13] because now they knew it now they
[50:15] understood it now they could do it
[50:18] and if you continue to read this and i
[50:21] reference this very quickly in nehemiah
[50:22] chapter 8 verse 14
[50:25] as it says and they found written in the
[50:27] law which the lord had commanded by
[50:28] moses that the children of israel should
[50:30] dwell in booths
[50:31] in the feast of the seventh month the
[50:34] sukkot
[50:35] the the feast of booths the feast of
[50:37] tabernacles
[50:38] they immediately restored the feast of
[50:40] tabernacles according to the law of
[50:41] moses
[50:42] because it happens at that very time
[50:46] it's taking place in that very time and
[50:48] when they read it and they recognize the
[50:49] moment they're living in
[50:51] and they realize and god had ordained
[50:53] this he allowed the walls of this temp
[50:55] this the temple to be restored
[50:57] and the people would supernaturally get
[50:59] men gathered they didn't necessarily
[51:00] even know
[51:02] because it's not until it was read that
[51:03] they understood do you recognize the day
[51:05] this is
[51:07] do you recognize the season that he told
[51:09] us that on the seventh day of
[51:11] the seventh month and these different
[51:12] things that this is the feast that we're
[51:13] supposed to have
[51:15] and it's in leviticus 23 40 and you
[51:16] shall rejoice
[51:18] before the lord your god seven days this
[51:21] is the feast of the tabernacles
[51:23] rejoice before the lord your god seven
[51:25] days
[51:26] another name for the feast was actually
[51:28] the season of our joy
[51:31] so notice how god says look don't be
[51:33] sorry
[51:34] because do you realize that the time and
[51:36] the season that you're living in
[51:38] according to my word is not the season
[51:40] of mourning and repenting it's the
[51:41] season of joy
[51:42] it's a season of celebration and joy is
[51:45] actually referenced several times many
[51:47] many times in reference to
[51:48] the feast of tabernacle or the feast of
[51:50] booths in deuteronomy chapter 16 verse
[51:52] 15.
[51:53] i'm reading this from a different
[51:54] translation i found three or four
[51:56] different translations that use the same
[51:57] language
[51:58] for seven days you are celebrate in the
[52:00] presence of the lord your god
[52:02] at the place where the lord will choose
[52:04] because the lord your god will bless you
[52:06] in all your
[52:07] harvest and in everything you do and
[52:10] your
[52:10] joy will be complete wow so powerful
[52:14] this is the season when they are wanting
[52:15] to lament and they're wanting to cry
[52:17] and they're wanting to be sorry and
[52:19] they're wanting to beat themselves up he
[52:20] says you've got to recognize your day
[52:22] and it's message
[52:22] this isn't a day of repenting this isn't
[52:24] a day of sorrow
[52:26] this is the feast of the tabernacles
[52:28] this is a time of celebration
[52:30] brother makes not very many statements
[52:32] about feasts of the tabernacles
[52:34] or feast of tabernacles he just
[52:35] references it a few times but one place
[52:37] he says that's where we're
[52:38] fellowshipping now
[52:40] and then he says that's what we'll be
[52:41] fellowshipping in the millennium
[52:44] this is where i could just add this
[52:45] caution
[52:47] that when it comes to the children of
[52:48] israel they work by a calendar
[52:52] and then we work from the types of that
[52:56] so we don't we don't try to get in this
[52:57] very rigid counter well the day of
[52:59] pentecost came and then this feast and
[53:00] then once you
[53:01] once you start doing that you'll start
[53:03] your head will start getting dizzy
[53:05] and you'll have to subscribe to some
[53:06] man's explanation on it
[53:09] in order to make sense of all of it and
[53:10] be able to place well if that was
[53:12] pentecost
[53:12] then so many days later is this and then
[53:14] the next year's that and then you try to
[53:16] make sense of all the dates and get the
[53:17] calendar line up
[53:18] we don't go by a calendar we go by the
[53:21] word
[53:23] okay so there's types that we draw from
[53:25] feast of the trumpets
[53:26] the tabernacles uh feast of pentecost
[53:28] there's a lot of types that we draw from
[53:30] it
[53:30] but for them it was by the calendar
[53:33] and so since they were in that september
[53:35] time they were in that time of that
[53:37] season
[53:37] and it fit with leviticus 23 and
[53:39] deuteronomy 16. they were
[53:41] they they did what was required of them
[53:43] at that time
[53:44] and it's this very same feast the feast
[53:46] of the tabernacles that came up
[53:48] in the dedication of the first temple it
[53:50] was at the very time of the feast of the
[53:51] tabernacles
[53:53] not because they said all the temples
[53:55] built let's have the feast
[53:56] it fit in the calendar so now as
[53:59] gentiles we don't go by a rigid calendar
[54:01] in that way
[54:02] we go by what god is revealing and doing
[54:05] in our lives at the time
[54:06] and we see the truth in our lives this
[54:08] is what we're doing this is a time of
[54:10] celebration
[54:10] this is the time of exaltation this is a
[54:12] time where god's going to be translating
[54:14] us into what
[54:15] new tabernacles new bodies
[54:18] and so we can see that type in it and
[54:21] this is how significant the feast of
[54:22] tabernacles were
[54:25] this time when they dedicated the first
[54:26] temple
[54:28] it comes at this time in nehemiah as
[54:30] they're rebuilding the walls of
[54:31] jerusalem
[54:32] but notice how he said that it's god
[54:34] will bless you in all your harvest
[54:36] they actually called it the harvest
[54:37] festival
[54:39] so notice the type then for the bride
[54:41] it's called the harvest festival
[54:42] they actually called it the feast of the
[54:45] inn gathering
[54:47] why because it was a time for gathering
[54:48] in for them it was a calendar that
[54:51] related to a natural harvest so it was
[54:52] the feast of the inn gathering where
[54:54] they brought in now we're living
[54:55] spiritually in a time of a gathering
[54:56] where god is gathering his bride
[54:58] together for what a rapture
[55:00] a harvest harvest time and in every day
[55:04] of the celebration
[55:06] in the feast of the tabernacles the
[55:09] priest would perform what was called the
[55:10] water libation ceremony
[55:12] and the priests would actually walk down
[55:14] travel down to the pool of shalom
[55:16] and they would actually get buckets of
[55:18] water and have to bring them all
[55:20] the way back to pour it out upon the
[55:21] altar now to them this spoke of
[55:24] it to them it spoke of the the just not
[55:26] only a cleansing of the altar but it was
[55:28] done in a way of prophecy
[55:30] because the word the language in isaiah
[55:32] and other places in the psalms it was
[55:34] the well of salvation you shall draw
[55:36] from the well of salvation and it was
[55:38] the wells of joy and happiness
[55:40] and one day that's going to come and
[55:41] they went through this exercise
[55:43] pouring out this water as a as a symbol
[55:46] of the messiah that was going to come
[55:50] i trust i'm not i'm not losing anybody
[55:52] at this point i know it's
[55:53] it's a little hot right but we woke up
[55:56] in
[55:57] maricopa right we're in the valley i
[56:00] don't know
[56:00] anybody came down from flag but the
[56:02] other day it was 100 degrees in flag
[56:03] that's hot
[56:04] if i was in flagstaff it was 100 degrees
[56:06] i would go to phoenix to cool off
[56:09] because that's hot in that in that
[56:10] elevation where i don't know it's hot in
[56:12] here right
[56:13] maybe a little bit muggy but we all
[56:14] realize we're in phoenix and i know that
[56:16] i'm going along
[56:17] i'm just right at about an hour already
[56:19] and i just want to finish this thought
[56:21] on pure joy
[56:22] i really really want to finish it and
[56:24] i'm just kind of hitting a highlight on
[56:26] this
[56:26] but it's real beautiful stuff if you
[56:27] just ponder it these are all little
[56:29] things you could branch out from
[56:31] but here as these priests would do this
[56:33] every day if these seven days during
[56:35] this time of feast of the tabernacles
[56:36] they took the water and poured upon the
[56:38] altar in the temple
[56:39] then in john chapter 7 at the beginning
[56:42] of the chapter it says
[56:44] now is the time for the feast of the
[56:45] tabernacles and the disciples
[56:47] and that was one of the three feasts
[56:48] that everyone was commanded to do in
[56:50] jerusalem
[56:51] you had to go you had to go to jerusalem
[56:52] remember the jews work by calendar and
[56:55] they work by geography
[56:57] the bride doesn't do that she goes by
[56:58] the word and she goes by the spirit
[57:00] so it's not geography and it's not
[57:02] calendar so this is there's this
[57:03] difference in what god does to the jews
[57:05] and what he does to the gentiles
[57:07] so in their season in john chapter 7 the
[57:09] disciples were going to go to jerusalem
[57:11] and jesus says well i'm not going to go
[57:12] but the bible says he went up in secret
[57:15] what a beautiful type for the time we're
[57:17] living in now when he comes up and he
[57:19] goes up in secret
[57:20] and it's then in the very notice verse
[57:22] 37
[57:24] in the last day the great day of the
[57:26] feast jesus
[57:27] stood and cried saying if any man thirst
[57:31] let him come unto me and drink
[57:34] that the spiritual significance of this
[57:37] don't let's not miss it
[57:38] brother bam talks about it in broken
[57:39] cisterns and then one other place
[57:41] the spiritual significance of jesus
[57:43] standing up on the last great day of
[57:45] that feast
[57:46] in the feast of the tabernacles while
[57:48] every day these priests were going down
[57:50] getting a bucket of water
[57:52] from the pool of siloam and walk into
[57:54] the altar and pouring out this water
[57:55] and they're doing this as a symbol
[57:57] symbolism and that the messiah is going
[57:59] to come
[58:00] and then the messiah comes in secret and
[58:02] stands amongst them and says
[58:04] i am that living water
[58:08] i am that fountain of joy i'm the one
[58:10] that if you come and take of me
[58:12] out of your belly will flow living
[58:15] waters
[58:16] and you won't have to trudge down to
[58:17] that pool and come back to this physical
[58:19] altar
[58:20] one day there will be a birth in your
[58:22] heart that will not bind you by calendar
[58:24] not bind you by geography but out of
[58:26] your heart and out of your belly
[58:28] will flow living water and it's then
[58:32] at the feast of the tabernacles that
[58:34] christ speaks of himself
[58:36] and says i am alone the source of your
[58:38] joy
[58:40] i am the source of living water that's
[58:43] what happens in john 7
[58:45] it's at that very time in nehemiah 8.
[58:48] it's at that very time when they solomon
[58:50] built the temple and dedicated it
[58:52] it was that very time in leviticus and
[58:53] deuteronomy that god established it
[58:55] and when you begin to recognize that
[58:56] continuity would it not be the same
[58:58] today
[58:59] when god is building again zion
[59:02] restoring his temple which is his
[59:04] body and brings us to that place of
[59:05] habitation where the headstone is
[59:08] uniting together again
[59:09] it's a season now where it's not don't
[59:12] weep anymore
[59:13] don't lament don't cry i am
[59:16] singing over you with joy i love you
[59:19] i'm rejoicing over thee with joy now is
[59:22] the time that i favor you
[59:23] now is the time to rejoice now is the
[59:25] time to sing
[59:26] not because one day it's coming but i
[59:29] the lord am in your midst
[59:32] fulfilling your word i am your source of
[59:34] living water
[59:36] i i it's not going to ask for permission
[59:38] i'm just going to try to go
[59:39] go with some expediency and speed uh
[59:42] very very quickly there's several
[59:43] scriptures that we could use this to
[59:44] emphasize this but
[59:46] joy is always connected with the
[59:48] revelation of jesus christ
[59:50] it's connected with his presence and in
[59:52] this first coming you see this theme in
[59:54] luke chapter one
[59:55] as it said that when elizabeth when mary
[59:58] came to elizabeth
[1:00:01] and and i don't know if i have these
[1:00:02] scriptures in there in luke
[1:00:04] but mary comes to elizabeth and he sees
[1:00:06] her says for lo
[1:00:07] verse 44 for his low as soon as the
[1:00:09] voice of thy salutation
[1:00:11] sounded to my ears here's elizabeth
[1:00:13] being approached by mary
[1:00:15] and it says the babe which was elijah
[1:00:18] leaped john the baptist in the spirit of
[1:00:20] light of the babe leaped in my
[1:00:22] womb for joy upon thy salutation
[1:00:26] what was your salutation when mary began
[1:00:28] to declare
[1:00:29] how an angel came to her and gave her
[1:00:31] this message
[1:00:32] and that she would conceive of the holy
[1:00:34] ghost and she would have a child
[1:00:36] who would be the messiah and his name
[1:00:38] would be jesus
[1:00:39] that announcement that salutation
[1:00:42] caused the forerunner in the womb of
[1:00:45] elizabeth
[1:00:46] to leap for joy it was something that a
[1:00:49] mother could recognize would be
[1:00:51] different
[1:00:51] she felt that sensation that this child
[1:00:54] now was moved
[1:00:55] it was animated and it began to leap and
[1:00:57] be excited for joy
[1:00:58] and what the excellent the salutation of
[1:01:01] mary
[1:01:02] about the coming messiah why because
[1:01:04] he's associated with joy
[1:01:06] and then mary responds in verse 46 and
[1:01:09] mary said my
[1:01:10] soul doth magnify the lord and my spirit
[1:01:13] hath rejoiced
[1:01:14] in god my savior why because that's what
[1:01:16] the messiah brings
[1:01:18] is he brings joy and in luke chapter 2
[1:01:21] verse 10
[1:01:24] when this the shepherds are just stunned
[1:01:26] at this awesome
[1:01:27] spectacle that they're witnessing and
[1:01:29] says the angel said to them fear not
[1:01:31] for behold i bring you good tidings
[1:01:35] of great joy we shall be out to all the
[1:01:38] people
[1:01:39] the revelation of jesus christ is
[1:01:40] associated with great joy
[1:01:43] the word we received is good tidings
[1:01:46] that's that's that's what we emphasize
[1:01:49] let me express this to you
[1:01:51] if you've taken the approach with your
[1:01:52] co-workers and your family and your
[1:01:54] friends
[1:01:54] who don't know this blessed truth to sit
[1:01:56] there and point out to them
[1:01:58] the judgment that's awaiting laodicea
[1:02:00] and the judgment upon their sin
[1:02:02] and how perverted the world is and how
[1:02:04] it's sodom and gomorrah
[1:02:06] that's wonderful but don't miss the
[1:02:08] revealing of christ
[1:02:09] which is love which is joy which is
[1:02:11] peace which is satisfaction
[1:02:13] which is the stimulation of joy which is
[1:02:16] the release from the bondage of
[1:02:17] depression which is the tearing down of
[1:02:19] thoughts of suicide which is the healing
[1:02:21] of the body of the mind
[1:02:22] we can make them realize all day long
[1:02:24] how dark the world is by using the
[1:02:25] message of the hour
[1:02:27] but don't forget to show them how bright
[1:02:29] the light is shining in the time that
[1:02:31] we're living in
[1:02:33] this message is one of good tidings of
[1:02:35] great joy
[1:02:37] that's what we share not judgment to
[1:02:38] laodicea judgment to sodom
[1:02:40] judgment to gomorrah judgment to the
[1:02:42] democrats judgment to the liberals
[1:02:43] judgment to this and judgment to that
[1:02:45] not life and peace to the sons and
[1:02:47] daughters of god
[1:02:50] brother abraham says in christ is a
[1:02:51] mystery god revealed they're singing
[1:02:53] take the name of jesus with you and you
[1:02:56] realize it's even as they're singing i
[1:02:57] said i don't know if you recognize the
[1:02:58] spiritual significance it begins to
[1:03:00] point these things out
[1:03:01] he stops and he says the threefold
[1:03:03] revelation hope and joy of heaven
[1:03:06] revealed in him the hope of earth and
[1:03:10] joy of heaven
[1:03:11] is he singing in that song he says the
[1:03:13] hope of earth and joy of heaven it's
[1:03:15] revealed in him
[1:03:16] everything is manifested in christ god
[1:03:19] the church everything else
[1:03:20] is manifested in christ the bible is
[1:03:22] christ the bible is the written word
[1:03:23] which he is the word
[1:03:24] it's manifestation to me this is the
[1:03:26] revival its manifestation
[1:03:28] is the evidence of the life coming into
[1:03:30] the flesh of the word to manifest it
[1:03:34] this is this is what revival is it's the
[1:03:36] word of god working in the life of god
[1:03:38] of an individual according to the spirit
[1:03:40] of god by the spirit of god the word of
[1:03:41] god working in your hearts
[1:03:42] the manifestation is the evidence of the
[1:03:44] life coming to the flesh of the word
[1:03:45] to manifest it the hope of earth and joy
[1:03:48] of heaven who is it
[1:03:49] jesus christ it's revealed in him
[1:03:54] and brother brown says excuse me in
[1:03:55] psalm 16 11. i don't
[1:03:58] amplify these things very much to you
[1:04:00] but just to throw these things out there
[1:04:02] for you to ponder
[1:04:03] this prophecy psalm 16 11 that will show
[1:04:06] me the path of life
[1:04:07] in thy presence is fullness of joy
[1:04:11] in the feast of the tabernacles it says
[1:04:13] god will bless you in your harvest and
[1:04:14] everything you do
[1:04:15] your joy will be complete this is the
[1:04:18] bride's revival today
[1:04:20] god's saying that i will bless you in
[1:04:22] your harvest and i will bless everything
[1:04:24] you'll do
[1:04:24] and your joy will be complete how can we
[1:04:27] have the fullness of joy
[1:04:29] and complete joy unless he hath shown us
[1:04:32] the path of life
[1:04:33] and his presence is with us
[1:04:37] in thy presence is the fullness of joy
[1:04:38] at thy right hand there are pleasures
[1:04:40] forevermore
[1:04:41] that's where i want to be brother
[1:04:44] brandon says in the message shalom it's
[1:04:46] breaking day church
[1:04:47] think about this beautiful imagery it's
[1:04:49] darkness upon the people
[1:04:51] but it's good morning to the church it's
[1:04:54] darkness upon the age gloom sadness
[1:04:56] depression anxiety fear
[1:04:58] perversion upon the people but at the
[1:05:00] very same time the paradox is
[1:05:02] as there's a setting sun upon laodicea
[1:05:04] as it descends into darkness and chaos
[1:05:06] and is completely blacked out
[1:05:07] spiritually there's been a rising of the
[1:05:09] sun
[1:05:10] and so he doesn't say good night to the
[1:05:12] bride he says good morning
[1:05:14] he says shalom good morning to the
[1:05:17] church
[1:05:18] christ is peering is appearing
[1:05:21] among us shalom peace
[1:05:25] this is why sometimes when i get a phone
[1:05:27] call or see somebody it doesn't matter
[1:05:28] what time of the day it is
[1:05:29] i say good morning not because i'm mixed
[1:05:32] up to my time zones but
[1:05:34] to the bride it's good morning
[1:05:37] christ is appearing among us shalom
[1:05:41] peace he said it's good morning
[1:05:45] psalms 30 verse 5 for his anger and
[1:05:47] dearth but a moment
[1:05:50] in his favor is life thou shalt show me
[1:05:52] the path of life
[1:05:53] in his favor grace grace coming to the
[1:05:56] bride in his favor his life
[1:05:57] weeping may endure for a night
[1:06:01] but joy cometh in the morning we weep
[1:06:04] because we still feel that we're in the
[1:06:05] night
[1:06:06] you're weeping even still yet now
[1:06:08] because you feel that you're in the
[1:06:09] night time of a situation a difficulty a
[1:06:11] problem that you're going through
[1:06:12] and as long as you're in the weeping
[1:06:15] because weeping takes place in the night
[1:06:17] but joy comes in the morning should we
[1:06:20] not be praying for the rising of the sun
[1:06:22] in our lives lord let me see your light
[1:06:24] shine let me see the sun come up
[1:06:26] lord even though it may seem dark in
[1:06:28] these other areas of my life
[1:06:29] that's just the darkness settling on the
[1:06:31] people that's darkness upon
[1:06:33] natural things but oh lord let me
[1:06:35] recognize that it is shalom
[1:06:37] it is good morning and if i know that
[1:06:39] it's good morning
[1:06:40] and i know that it is the rising of the
[1:06:42] sun then i know my joy has come
[1:06:46] i have a place of rest i have a place of
[1:06:48] sanctuary i have a place that i can hide
[1:06:50] and listen it's not a place where you
[1:06:52] just sit there going oh whoa it's me
[1:06:53] oh whoa it's me oh well good morning oh
[1:06:56] what was me
[1:06:58] good morning no it's then that you say
[1:07:00] yes there's darkness
[1:07:02] but hallelujah shalom peace joy
[1:07:05] thanksgiving rejoicing shouting blessing
[1:07:09] honor praise glory be unto his name
[1:07:13] why because joy comes in the morning
[1:07:25] the two link these quotations from the
[1:07:27] message shalom
[1:07:29] and then a man running from the presence
[1:07:31] of the lord it's 11 43.
[1:07:34] if some of you are regretting not having
[1:07:35] your watch today
[1:07:37] it's 11 43 you know exactly what time it
[1:07:39] is the temperature is
[1:07:41] warm and and we're uh
[1:07:44] i was getting kind of picked on this
[1:07:46] weekend by a deacon from another church
[1:07:48] you know
[1:07:49] we were eating dinner and i said well i
[1:07:51] think we're getting ready to leave was
[1:07:52] haha you know listen those preachers
[1:07:53] getting ready to close we got another
[1:07:55] two hours guys
[1:07:56] and i say well it's just like a deacon
[1:07:58] to pick on the preacher
[1:08:00] i said i guess this is the time for you
[1:08:01] guys to go off in the foyer and start
[1:08:02] talking right
[1:08:05] i mean if you want to tell preacher
[1:08:06] jokes we got deacon jokes
[1:08:09] but um i'm not saying i'm fixing to
[1:08:11] close i just have two two lengthy
[1:08:12] quotations to read you here they are
[1:08:14] those of you with really good eyesight
[1:08:15] brother martin you can see that you
[1:08:16] probably read it for us
[1:08:17] with that uh 520 vision it's just two
[1:08:20] lengthy quotations
[1:08:22] if you're feeling good at all about just
[1:08:25] having this left the entire sermon to
[1:08:28] this point
[1:08:29] has been this so
[1:08:33] if we've been an hour and 20 minutes
[1:08:34] i've gotta i don't know maybe i got
[1:08:35] about
[1:08:36] 40 minutes here 45 50 minutes in just
[1:08:39] one page
[1:08:42] all right enough let's read this this is
[1:08:43] from shalom and i do want to wrap this
[1:08:46] up before noon
[1:08:47] in the message shalom listen to this
[1:08:50] just i want to read it through i just
[1:08:51] felt compelled to read this whole thing
[1:08:52] just exactly like you showed us the
[1:08:54] seven church ages
[1:08:56] think of how they would have experienced
[1:08:57] this in nehemiah chapter eight
[1:08:59] what would come just exactly what he
[1:09:01] showed us what would come and when he
[1:09:02] set that light up there in the
[1:09:04] revelation to it to show the world
[1:09:06] when he sent the seven angels to reveal
[1:09:07] the seven messengers that had been down
[1:09:09] through here
[1:09:10] there and show the loose ends each angel
[1:09:12] coming each day and
[1:09:14] revealing the loose ends that luther
[1:09:15] left and wesley left and pentecost left
[1:09:18] is all represented in there
[1:09:21] you can see all the different symbolisms
[1:09:22] that have been expressed at that point
[1:09:24] and in the very type and shadow of the
[1:09:26] great shalom
[1:09:28] jehovah jvhu exactly
[1:09:32] throated in the skies and there is the
[1:09:34] mechanical eye
[1:09:36] taking a picture of it thank the lord
[1:09:40] now without getting into that i mean
[1:09:41] just what he described there to that
[1:09:43] point
[1:09:44] is a lot of stuff right but again let's
[1:09:48] make it very very very practical so he
[1:09:49] does for us
[1:09:50] shalom peace listen listen this is god's
[1:09:54] message to you he wants you to hear this
[1:09:55] don't be weary jesus is here his great
[1:09:58] light has come to us and we're thankful
[1:10:00] for it
[1:10:01] yes his word the great mystery here he
[1:10:04] is today
[1:10:05] manifesting himself doing the same as he
[1:10:07] did then
[1:10:08] just the same doing the very same we are
[1:10:11] creatures of time he's the god of
[1:10:13] eternity
[1:10:14] we try to press ourselves we try to make
[1:10:16] something different all this
[1:10:18] has got to be now that's that's a lot
[1:10:20] too
[1:10:22] and then he says remember he knows all
[1:10:23] about it it's going to happen anyhow
[1:10:26] let him do it just commit yourself to
[1:10:30] him all this has got to happen this has
[1:10:32] got to take place no
[1:10:33] he knows all about it whatever he said
[1:10:35] is going to be is going to be
[1:10:36] you just let him do it commit yourself
[1:10:38] to him look up and shine with joy of the
[1:10:40] lord
[1:10:41] to know that you've been privileged your
[1:10:43] eyes have come open
[1:10:44] and see this day trust him
[1:10:48] for the future
[1:10:52] let's do that from this moment on trust
[1:10:54] him for the future how can i trust him
[1:10:56] you've seen him vindicate his word in
[1:10:58] days past
[1:10:58] he that vindicated his word in days past
[1:11:00] and made all these other things happen
[1:11:01] just exactly to the hour that we're
[1:11:03] living everything exactly to the seventh
[1:11:05] angel's message
[1:11:06] both showed it in the heaven and on
[1:11:08] earth made it known their way
[1:11:09] in three ways so there can't be no slip
[1:11:11] up remember he promised he'd come again
[1:11:14] hallelujah that word will be vindicated
[1:11:16] god's promised word
[1:11:18] with two thousand years of waiting he
[1:11:19] will arrive on time
[1:11:21] don't be weary he'll be here as he have
[1:11:23] vindicated his word in every age the
[1:11:25] church ages show the same thing
[1:11:27] and revealing of our lord by the seventh
[1:11:29] message and so forth
[1:11:30] god revealed it manifested it and proved
[1:11:32] it and in among us today
[1:11:35] he showed himself here with us and
[1:11:37] proved and
[1:11:38] vindicated his word so will he
[1:11:43] what is the great stimulation of joy to
[1:11:45] the believer the stimulation
[1:11:46] that it's vindicated it's proved he says
[1:11:49] he shows himself here
[1:11:50] proved and vindicated that's the source
[1:11:54] of our joy
[1:11:55] i'm not gonna i'm not gonna listen to
[1:11:56] another one of satan's podcast called
[1:11:59] someday
[1:12:00] i'm i've unsubscribed i've blocked him i
[1:12:02] don't
[1:12:03] i don't follow his sermons i don't go to
[1:12:05] his website
[1:12:06] my time is now
[1:12:10] this is the time
[1:12:13] this is the season this is the moment
[1:12:17] when god reveals his word to his people
[1:12:19] is a time for joy
[1:12:23] they called it the season of our joy
[1:12:24] when god reveals his word to his people
[1:12:26] it's a time for joy and rejoicing not
[1:12:29] weeping or mourning
[1:12:30] and he says he's among us today what did
[1:12:32] zephaniah say i'm in the midst of thee
[1:12:36] be glad and rejoice with all the heart
[1:12:40] and the message man running from the
[1:12:41] presence of the lord
[1:12:43] by the mic if you'd come and begin to
[1:12:46] play
[1:12:47] as you feel led this is the my final
[1:12:52] uh the final statement
[1:12:55] to close this series on pure joy and
[1:12:57] he's praying it as a prayer
[1:12:59] i pray dear god for each one of these
[1:13:03] these dear people that i stood yandere

[1:13:20] heavy statements heavy sermons

[1:13:25] series of february 65
[1:13:28] and as he had sought the lord there
[1:13:30] outside of tucson and i think
[1:13:31] even when the school children gather and
[1:13:33] saw that column of fire going up and
[1:13:35] down

[1:19:36] i can look in my own life and identify
[1:19:38] that you've called me as a
[1:19:39] a man therefore i i have a labor to
[1:19:42] perform i have a work to do
[1:19:45] you giving me opportunities
[1:19:46] professionally or giving me an education
[1:19:49] when it comes to my flesh and i haven't
[1:19:51] i have a job to do
[1:19:53] as a man and in doing that job lord i
[1:19:57] i have a sense of fulfillment
[1:20:00] and then falling in love with the
[1:20:02] daughter of god i invite her to be a
[1:20:04] part of my life
[1:20:04] and part of my vision and then i i enter
[1:20:06] into that office of a husband
[1:20:10] and then i i have responsibilities to
[1:20:12] her as a husband
[1:20:14] then as an expression of our love we
[1:20:16] begin to have children and then my
[1:20:18] i enter into a new office and lord i'm a
[1:20:21] father
[1:20:24] and then when i begin to challenge
[1:20:26] myself well what should i do and what
[1:20:28] should i be doing
[1:20:29] this rapture this gavin together lord i
[1:20:32] realize that there's this season where
[1:20:34] you're making yourself known in your
[1:20:36] word and connecting with my heart in a
[1:20:37] very personal way
[1:20:39] not that i would have very lofty ideals
[1:20:41] and very lofty revelations but that i
[1:20:43] could live a very salty life
[1:20:46] that in knowing you i become a better
[1:20:47] man and knowing you i become a better
[1:20:49] husband and knowing you i become a
[1:20:50] better father
[1:20:52] and that it's in living that life as
[1:20:55] man lawyer husband father
[1:20:58] pastor walking in the calling and
[1:21:01] yielding my gift
[1:21:03] that i personally am getting closer to
[1:21:06] that change
[1:21:09] lord there may be young sisters here and
[1:21:12] young brothers who
[1:21:13] in this season of life begin to wonder
[1:21:15] what's it all about and if there's a
[1:21:16] rapture what does that mean for me and
[1:21:18] do i need to do this and do i need to do
[1:21:20] that lord we will not
[1:21:21] take that last step unless we're walking
[1:21:26] unless we're doing the things that we're
[1:21:27] called to do so i pray lord that you
[1:21:29] could wake us up from our slumber
[1:21:31] begin to lead us and guide us in our
[1:21:33] lives to be where you want us to be to
[1:21:35] do the things that you want us to do
[1:21:37] lord if it be in terms of education and
[1:21:40] profession and job and who we're gonna
[1:21:42] marry and
[1:21:42] where we're gonna go to church may these
[1:21:44] things begin to be quickened to us
[1:21:46] as we walk in your word that we can take
[1:21:47] a step further in your grace and in your
[1:21:50] goodness
[1:21:50] knowing that we're living in a different
[1:21:52] season at a different time that we've
[1:21:54] entered the rapturing age and just
[1:21:55] because we're in the rapture and age
[1:21:56] doesn't mean we've just laid all our
[1:21:58] utensils down and our service down and
[1:22:00] our calling down and our gifts down
[1:22:02] and we're just all kind of waiting for
[1:22:03] something climactic to happen
[1:22:05] lord the move is on for me
[1:22:09] may those who stand in your presence
[1:22:10] today say thus
[1:22:12] saith the lord the move is on for me
[1:22:15] and may we be up and doing may we take
[1:22:17] heart lord
[1:22:18] and go forward and to fight and just
[1:22:20] persevere
[1:22:21] and do the things that are necessary and
[1:22:23] may we lord love you with all of our
[1:22:25] hearts love you more than anything else
[1:22:27] pour into us the oil of gladness may we
[1:22:30] see the word made manifest in our life
[1:22:32] and father we trust you for the future
[1:22:36] and may your word fulfilled be our joy
[1:22:40] bless your people i pray in the name of
[1:22:42] the lord jesus christ
[1:22:43] amen amen
