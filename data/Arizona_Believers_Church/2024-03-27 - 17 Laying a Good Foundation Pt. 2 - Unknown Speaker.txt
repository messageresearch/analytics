TRANSCRIPT
========================================
reading in all these places uh you know all these verses on the building of the house of the Lord we've been using this example the house of the Lord to cover a number of different subjects and I'm hoping that tonight as we just go through this a little bit more um you'll be able to piece together some of the uh the thoughts that we've used in the past as we've been building on a lot of things a lot of things connecting together and right in the middle of this series we kind of started venturing into um the concept of headship and uh the roles of fathers and husb husbands and looking at families and family life and home life and that was not uh a mistake that wasn't an accidental exit it's been kind of um before me even on some of these other series that we've ministered on over the last year and a half there a lot of things that we've been addressing um in this S series that we've uh been thinking about a lot in our hearts that God had been dealing with us on so I'm very happy to come into these areas and then uh the subject of the house Lord is just so vast there's so many different ways that you could explore these things that uh you may you might even yourselves just see some tempting areas to go into and things to look at and I've enjoyed the fellowship that I've had with each of you on this I want to continue on this thought of laying a good foundation and using that word foundation even to look at h a founding the beginning of something when it starts and I know that we look at things we say a foundation and a a house that has a foundation or building that has a foundation that would be some uh some uh UND structure that you get touch you could feel but a foundation can even speak to how something starts the way that it starts its timing the manner in which it begins and so we're looking at how something is established how something is set forth and also uh using that solid base of a structure to be an example to us of the beginnings and of the things that we do as Christians and as we were going through it on Sunday we could see in just a number of different scriptures and tonight we'll draw from the message in just a couple places and see just how much the word demonstrates the importance of a foundation whether it be the physical structure that solid base of a structure or even the beginnings of something or the very things that support something and guide something we know that foundations are significant just by how God treats it in the scripture we use Psalms 104:5 on Sunday it speaks of God that uh the Lord as it speaks in verse one uh oh Lord my God Thou Art very great is what he declares in verse one this great God who laid the foundations of the earth that it should not be removed forever his uh he has established it by his power and in establishing it by it P his power upon these foundations it cannot be removed I may be shaken but it can't be removed and this the creation of the earth is compared in this way to building a building and how that you'd begin with the foundation it's got to start off with a solid foundation that it can remain and not be carried away or destroyed he says God laid the foundations of the earth and look at all those times in Scripture that God talks about the foundations the scriptures talk about the foundations of the earth and it's the his foundation that he builds for the Earth that's why the Earth won't be removed forever it's because he put it on a solid basis his word but his foundation manifest his wisdom and power that God just didn't create but in the way that God created he was uh even evolutionary and he and he built and he raised up and he set it upon certain foundations and he supported it with certain laws and this was all so that his creation would exist and subsist and continue on we we concluded our service on Sunday with these verses here in 1 Timothy chapter 6 vers 17 18 and 19 now I'm not sure if brother Andrew did such a tremendous job that you all forgot everything that I had said that morning if so that's all right uh my part was archived his wasn't and you can always go back and catch it uh later just to be refreshed but in first Timothy 6: 17 to 19 says charge them that are rich in this world that they be not high minded nor trust in uncertain riches now he's admonishing a certain kind of attitude and a certain kind of action so it's the attitude it's the activity these are things that he's addressing and admonishing and I want you to take from that that Paul is saying do this think this way have this attitude and and think about these things and notice what he comes to that you would trust in a living God who giveth us richly all things to enjoy and then this is part of the activity that they do good that they be riched in good rich in Good Works ready to distribute willing to communicate laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come that they may lay hold on eternal life so this this attitude and activity that he's encouraging in The Believer is for this reason that they can lay up in store for themselves a good foundation and he says against the time to come in other words for later for what might happen in the future you say well why should I uh trust in a living God and why should I do good and these different things it's very specific and uh precise here we could bring in a lot of other scriptures to show that God is asking you to do these things not necessarily for that very moment that it's somehow some sort of magic potion that whenever you do it's like oh wow isn't that neat but you're doing it because you there's a future and there's things that are going to happen later on down the road so you're doing things now that God asked you to do because God sees all things and he asked you to do something do it now because he sees something coming or he knows the way that we think or the way that we're bit bent a little bit so he's like do these things now and it'll be for you later on when it says that you may lay a good foundation lay a foundation for what for the time to come in other words for what may happen in the future do some do things today for what may happen tomorrow there's going to be a future there's going to be time as brother bam said that there's going to be a future and we have a duty to train our children as if there will be a future think about how maybe some of us were raised in the message during the the 70s and there was just this idea that comes 1977 we're all going to be gone and when that didn't happen I thought well maybe his calendar is just a little bit different than ours and there's no building to a future cuz they didn't think we'd even be here but we have are taught in the word of God that we we plant our potatoes and we live our lives as if we're always going to be here and that's kind of the secret to getting out of here when we have this idea well I think he's coming in the morning or he's already come or whatever it is and we're just kind of Lo you know Blas well we're just going to wait till this happens or waiting for Brother brand to do this wait for that like well then it's never going to happen and and if it does you're going to miss it but so it's like kind of this activity and this attitude of of preparing and working and laboring because God and this is kind of what wanting to express World God is visionary God sees the long term so we're not just kind of twilling our thumbs until we get to the end we're working our way to that if I could say this way knowing what's coming you've got to do things now for that time and so laying a good foundation for the future is what he's saying and we were using that and a lot of the things that we talked about and building on that threshing floor and all the history the rich history of the location of the temple to see that the beginning of something requires great effort I would it maybe even suggest greater effort that as a as something is built and you get to the end whether you're building a house or it's in a project those who work on projects there might be a lot of activity a flurry of activity at the end but when you look at the beginning of something whether it be the planning and whether it be the actual laying the foundation for it like that's when all the really the hard work is done the thoughtfulness and the considering and the planning that's where a lot of these things are worked out and taken into consideration and then when you get to there's just a lot of finishing that's taking place a lot of the expense and the greatest work is in the beginning of something so it says do this to lay a good foundation that's useful suitable commendable admirable genuine approved it's excellent and it's nature and character that good foundation so that it's well adapted to its end and that it's uh it's it's suitable and can be used for its purpose in other words all these things that we're asked to do are a foundation for something that's coming and if you do it you're laying a good foundation and this good foundation requires sacrifice it requires work it requires I said investment in giving that's the kind of the image I'm wanting us all to think and I don't mind if you start to sweat a little bit or get anxious thinking about it because this is the Christian Life is a rugged life and though our souls are at rest and our hearts are at ease in Christ uh he's he's called us to work he's called us to to work and War to to build and to fight and so this this life here is about building things and fighting the devil who's trying to stop what you're building and so we can't uh we can't get lazy and if you start to think man I I didn't realize there was so much effort that we had to put into this of course it's what's going to make the Millennium so much fun is we've already put in the work and so there's some things that uh we've got to do now in a spiritual sense uh because there's a time to come now in 2 Chronicles chapter 8:16 we this scripture I just love how it summarizes so much it says now all the work of Solomon was prepared and we're looking specifically at his labor to build the house of the Lord now all the work of Solomon was prepared unto the day of the foundation of the house of the Lord and until it was finished so all the works prepared in from the foundation to the finishing and then it says so the house of the Lord was perfected this is a process that brought it to its Perfection and the building of the house of the Lord I'll just repeat this over and over in case you forget why we're uh taking our time to examine these things it's an example to us whether we see ourselves in a three- room house or whether we see that our bodies are a temple our home should be a temple the this church is the house of the Lord that all those different types and examples because the house of the Lord is an example that's we want to draw from even the construction of the house of the Lord and Solomon's planning in to see something about ourselves and the foundation of the temple and even the foundation of the earth as we've looked at those things they share similar descriptions and they're how solid they are and how they can't be removed and how permanent they were and it says all the work of Solomon was prepared now if you turn to First Kings chapter 5 I'd like to read verses 1 to 12 this is part of that lengthy reading and when I do this those of you who listen for it you can you can listen for my lisp and get all giddy when I hit it uh but this is uh this is this is Solomon's work and I'm wanting to see all this work was prepared and it has this picture of saying it was well ordered that he knew what he was doing he did it with wisdom he did it with foresight so let's look at the details and just think maybe in bigger picture not so much the foundation right now but bigger picture all the things that are happening even before maybe one thing looks like it's happening on site everything is helping happening in preparation for what is going to happen and look at this wisdom this well ordering and this foresight this Sol has and hyam king of Tyree sent his servants unto Solomon for he had heard that they had anointed him King in the room of his father for ham was ever a lover of David and Solomon went to ham saying thou knowest how that David my father could not build a house under the name of the Lord his God for the wars which were about him on every side until the Lord put them under the souls of his feet but now the Lord my God hath given me rest on every side so that there is neither adversary nor evil occurrent and behold I purpose to build a house unto the name of the Lord my God as the Lord spake unto David my father saying thy son whom I will set upon thy throne in thy room he shall build a house unto thy name so this is Solomon in response to Ham's you know uh congratulations and this Affinity that he had to the family and he and he's sending him uh this uh greetings from his servants he saiding now that I've come to this this is the prophecy that was given and I've purposed in my heart to build so he says now therefore command thou that they heue me cedar trees out of Lebanon and my servant shall be with thy servants and unto thee will I give higher for thy servants according to all that thou shalt appoint for thou knowest that there's not among us any that can skill to Hue Timber like under the sidonians and so this is him realizing we're going to need these things you've got it could you help us in it and I'll provide for you and it came to pass when heard the words of Solomon that he rejoiced greatly and said blessed be the Lord this day which hath given unto David a wise son over this great people so there's something about Solomon's preparation and his foresight in this building to say you know what we've been tasked to build a house but maybe we don't have all the resources and skills that we need to accomplish this and he's willing to ask for help and to get the things he needs and pays for him so he says I see this wisdom and ham sent to Solon saying I have considered the things which thou sentest to me for and I will do all thy desire concerning the timber of Cedar and concerning the timber of fur now I know that when we read this it reads as a story in a way that it's conveying enough information for us to recognize that even if it's politics and these communications but there must have been more that Solomon provided more that Solomon said that this king is now saying oh these are the plans this is what you're doing and now he's thought out how he's going to get all these materials to him because he says my servant shall bring them down from Lebanon unto the sea and I will convey them by sea and floats into the place that thou shalt appoint me and I will cause them to be discharged there and thou shalt receive them and thou shalt accomplish my desire in giving food for my household there's I think there's almost enough elements here for a contract there offer acceptance essential terms a meeting of the minds you're I'm going to give you Timber it's going to be Cedar it's going to be fur this is the way I'm going to deliver it and you're going toay pay me for it this is where it's going to be uh all these things are being thought out beforehand and Solomon gave ham 20,000 measures of wheat for food to his household and 20 measures of pure oil thus gave Solomon to ham year by year so it wasn't just a onetime thing this was some this is something that's going to take some time to finish and the lord gave Solomon wisdom as he promised him and there was peace between ham and Solomon and they made a league together this wisdom that is spoken of here is part of how that Solomon all that was prepared that Solomon prepared the work this is the work of Solomon if I say go hearken back to that scripture this is the work of Solon that was prepared and part of that work was in working together with this neighboring King and Kingdom and saying we have need this is what we want to do and he used wisdom in having peace he used wisdom in taking advantage of those relationships and this wisdom that God gave Solomon he used to acquire and to pay for and to achieve the Timber that was going to be needed in the temple temple of SE this the timber of Cedar and defur he was able to get these things that he needed because of his wisdom that God had promised him and as you could see even in First Kings chapter 5 just all the even in these few verses we've read the details that go into building this Great temple says all the work of Solomon was prepared it also speaks that it was carefully considered and accounted for beforehand it was well ordered and it had showed wisdom and foresight and it was prepared means that all the materials were acquired anything that was necessary was fabricated beforehand it was it was procured it was furnished and completed beforehand so that they knew they had everything necessary to finish the building before they even started and to do this that that would take a lot of effort in the beginning Not only would you have to understand what you're building and understand the work and understand what was required and even the engineering you'd have to know this is what we're building this is how big it's going to be built this is how much is required to do this how much is required to do that and it would take considerable uh uh I I would even say Manpower and wisdom and understanding to be able to acquire and accumulate all the resources you need so you can say it's all there we've got the land we've got the Manpower we've got all the tools and building materials we need we can finish this structure God allowing God's Will and God's time will never lack for provision and so they knew God's will they knew it was God's time and they saw the provision so like let's go to work let's build this and if God would show us Grace we have enough to complete it maybe it could have been instructive to them if you're like well we don't have everything we need then it's not time to build we don't have everything it's not time to build there's a a piece that I have as a pastor I think there's a piece that maybe the trustees have that if there's a point at which we feel like these facilities aren't going to be uh big enough for our church that God's going to provide and that the resources will be there in the time that we needed and if if the resources aren't there right now I've got this piece and just believing that it will be if the if the opportunity comes God will provide because God's will and his time will never lack for provision so to be well prepared it's to look and have foresight beforehand this is something that's been part of the the language I've been using maybe for the last few services this foresight this discern The Watchman who sees things I'm wanting to draw on that and speak to the hearts of the parents and the elders that there ought to be some sort of wisdom and understanding that we've acquired in our experiences with God that prepare us for this moment right now for those who are going to be facing the things that we're going to see in the future uh those of us who've been through courtships and we've gotten married and we started to have kids and we've tried to make make ends meet and we've made decisions to move and whatever it might be we've been there so we realize now I can teach something to my children so that they can have the benefit of the wisdom that I've been given by God and hopefully make their path a little bit better I would I would find No Greater Joy than to see my children far exceed me at any juncture in their life than where I was if if my children drive better cars if they get better grades have a better education if they preach better sermons whatever it might be I if they start a church just within five miles from here and it's a better church and the word is pure and the people are pure I would be happy to see that whatever labor we had propelled them and was a foundation for them to far exceed what I was able to do as a parent I can't think of a greater compliment than to see your children outdo you and I I say that humbled by my children's daily efforts to outdo me in everything amen now in Luke 14: 28-30 I think we've read this recently and I I keep F of myself looking at this scripture over and over again like man there's just so much to say here but then it's like he says it all in the verses it's not like a lot of commentary you can give to it but it's not going to stop me from trying for which of you intending to build a tower sth not down first and count at the cost whether he have sufficient to finish it this is a question that is rhetorical in nature assuming that nobody is going to start building something with without first knowing they have everything they need to build it otherwise they're going to start verse 29 let's happily after he had laid the foundation and he's not able to finish it in other words you can say oh well I've got X number of dollars here and I've got this much material said then you lay the foundation you didn't realize just how much work went into the foundation just how much can be poured into the cost of the slab just how much goes into the lumber and you get the you get the shell you get the beginning but then you don't have enough to finish it so he's actually kind of making the point that real wisdom before anything is undertaken slows down and says do I have sufficient not just to lay the foundation but to finish the superstructure and have it all finished he says otherwise people will begin to mock him saying this man began to build and was not able to finish it he was he wanted to build and he had some things to work with and he started and he laid did this good and he did that good and he had everything but he lacked La planning he lacked that discernment that Visionary aspect that foresight or that planning the preparation in other words Solomon went to build the temple Jesus is referring to man to build a tower and in the same way that Solomon built the temple and think of that the greatest thing we could think of maybe by way of physical structure the very identity of the Jews the temple the temple the temple the Temple mount the very center of Creation The Very Dwelling Place of God the way in which Solomon approached building the Temple is the same way you would approach building a simple Tower good you would think about it beforehand you say well what does it take I want to build a tower but I don't want it to be on Wheels I want to be able to have it the permanent location and this is what's going to take for the foundation this is what you're going to need for the superstructure I would even I would even argue that this is pretty good instruction for those who like to use Legos and Playmobile or building blocks whatever it might be I mean sit down and consider do this is what I want to build in my mind do I have sufficient to finish to build can I can I see in my my vision of what I want to build can I see where what kind of materials are going to be used in this and know that I have sufficient to finish it let me just remind you you can do all things through Christ that gives you strength now consider and so it says in First Kings chapter 6:7 and the house when it was building was built of stone made ready before it was brought thither so that there was neither Hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house while it was in building this that's a mind-blowing scripture and uh too bad they can't figure this out for all the building projects that take place in our subdivisions like yeah can't they just get this all done ahead of time so I don't have to hear the beeping and the hammering and the drilling but they were actually able to Fashion the pieces that were needed and of these Stone and even it's the Timber and those things as you read in other places and actually this is maybe a good point to say this there's so many in uh different places that some of these things are mentioned in Scripture that there a a volume of things you could read in and the Kings and Chronicles and different places to see even in the Psalms there a lot that you can gather from about the building of the temple in the house of the Lord but it's say the stone was made ready there was not a hammer or an axe or a tool heard in the house while it was building it was all done beforehand and they didn't just go build a brick bring it lay it down and go okay let's build another one like this go build it and bring it it was as if they knew already what it was going to look like and how it was going to fit together and they did all the work beforehand and they were to bring it in and silently place it Brick by Brick Stone by Stone this was the wisdom that Solon exhibited in building the house of the Lord this was the planning that was required it wasn't well bless God I want to do this and I'm just going to try I'm just going to try and see what happens no there was uh there was wisdom that was exercised so let's consider the the vastness of this building construction and if you want to call it a project or um an undertaking and think of that again we're talking about building the house of the Lord so it's not just a tower it's not just a Grainery it's not you know an outbuilding this is the place that God would dwell in First Kings chap 6: 11 to14 it gets more particularly as we've already read in uh these first 10 verses and maybe we could just track that a little bit how it was telling us the house of the Lord is going to be made of this length and this length and there's going to be out rooms and things round about it's quite a uh a campus I think the entire thing once it was finished covered like 17 Acres uh um not just the temple building but everything related to it and and as it began to build and grow there on the Temple Mount these things had to be interconnected they relied upon one another so it's a pretty vast project and as we're reading how that they they're building these Chambers and there's going to be a middle chamber it says in verse 11 and the word of the Lord came to Solomon saying concerning this house which Thou Art in building so this is in the in the time of its being built it's in this process if thou wil walk in my statutes and execute my judgments and keep all my Commandments to walk in them then I will perform my word with thee which I spake unto David thy father and I will dwell among the children of Israel and will not forsake My People Israel he was coming to that place in the building where now it's not just just going to be outer Court inner court but now it's going to be that most holy place the house within a house within a house the three room house however you want to look at three houses or three rooms those different ways that we looked at it in the very beginning of the year says if you will do this thing right and you'll walk before me this is where I'll dwell this place you're getting ready to build this holy of holies this Most Holy place I will come and dwell there and it says so Solomon built the house and finished it in reading these I find he built the house he built the house he built the house you find there's all these little houses that are all working together to make one great beautiful thing it's it it it's recounted here in 2 Chronicles chapter 3 I'll read verses 5 to 17 and the greater house this is the most holy h of holies this is that most holy place the holiest of holies now just think of how this room this house within a house is described and the greater house which Solomon built and finished the place that God said that he would dwell he sealed with fur tree which he overlaid with fine gold and set there on palm trees and chains this is a Wayne's coating this is wood paneling this is finishing it out just beautifully and he garnished the house with precious stones for Beauty and the gold was gold of paravan and he overlaid also the house the beams the post the walls thereof and the doors thereof with gold and Grave cherubims on the walls and he made the most holy house the link whereof was according to the breadth of the house 20 cubits and the bread thereof 20 cubits and he overlaid it so that perfect square and he overlaid it with fine gold amounting to 600 Talons and the weight of the nails was 50 shekels of gold and he overlaid The upper chambers with gold and in the most holy house he made two cherums of image work and overlaid them with gold and the wings of the cherubs were 20 cubits long One Wing of one cherub was five cubits reaching to the wall of the house and the other was likewise five cubits reaching to the wing of the other chair now do you see how it's How much this is covering and how even big now how big the room is the square now these cherubs if you start doing the Matthew these things are touching out and reaching this whole thing and very vast says in verse 12 and One Wing of the Cherub was five cubits reaching the wall of the house the other Wing was five cubits joining to the wing of the other cherub the wings of these cherubims spread themselves forth 20 cubits and they stood on their feet and their faces were Inward and he made the veil of blue and purple and crimsom and fine linen and wrough the cherubims thereon and he made before the house two pillars 30 and five cubits High and a chaper that was on the top of each of them was five cubits and he made chains as in the Oracle and put them on the heads of the pillars and he made a hundred pomegranat and put them on the chains and he reared up the pillars before the temple one on the right hand and the other on the left and called the name of that on the right hand jashen and that the name of that on the left Boaz and other words it shall be established in his powers I think what those names are referring to and this is just some of the detail details of this one part of the house of the Lord the one specific chamber room and some of the the porch are associated with it some of the little uh building a little bit further out these are just some of the details of the construction and there's more details that you can come in here and begin to read in chapter 7 uh uh and over and over again all these different things that start to happen on this place where he's building and it just the breadth of the structure the details of it everything that's being thought out beforehand it says in First Kings chapter 6:38 and the 11th year in the month bull which is the 8th month was the house finished throughout all parts thereof and according to the fashion of it it's the original way it was envisioned and all the ways that it was to be done in order to be in service because one of the things that doesn't happen is they don't begin to offer Worship in there until it's done until it says the house was perfected so it was finished throughout all the parts according to the fashion of it the use of it what it was used for it wasn't one of these things and I know we do this sometimes in our natural lives where we we get we get it built so far then we move into it where you're able to do that certainly probably not anywhere around Phoenix or Maricopa County but uh if you lived out in Ohio somewhere I I knew people who built things and lived in their garage until they could finish the rest of it I'm not going to name names don't get nervous and and and that was just because you could do it and it was a great way to save some money and then there but it's say we won't we won't get our per we're not going to move in we're not going to do anything here until it's finished because that's the use of it we don't want to do anything halfway it's going to be established by his strength he has established it he has established it by his power these pillars all these details you can go through the colors you can go through the pomegranates The Palms the cherubims all these things pointing back to the T the Tabernacle of witness and the Wilderness back to the image that Moses saw in heaven how they all have some sort of representation and meaning all these details and all these things are finished it says so he was seven years in building it of course it was seven right seven years in building it so it's completion this Perfection of it now with again I know I'm I'm reading a lot of scriptures here so let's just think about all those details the breadth of it the weight of it I think well the foundation the foundation of this Temple what was going to be built on it and what would be uh what it would be supporting you read about all this gold all this material all this thought going into uh this Most Holy place and the porches of it it's pretty detailed would you agree from the beams to the post to the walls to the curtains to the pillars uh to the things above the pillars a 100 pomegranates he puts on the chains just how detailed they'd have to be and the pillars and one on the right and left and he gives them even names and there's things on top the heads of the pillars this is a lot of detail so this is what you see this is the finished project project in all of its Grande but if you don't put that thing on the right kind of foundation these things won't last and I would like to again remind you think about our own lives think about our families think even about our church and and the kind of vision that we might have the goals well I want to accomplish this I want to accomplish that there may be some here that have a vision to be something when they get older go to school and do this and and it's always kind of off in the future I want to go to college and I want to get this degree and I want to do this or I want to become this I want to become that or I want to get married and I want to have children I want to all these V visions and dreams that we have all these Ambitions they're going to be built upon whatever you're doing right now your future is going to be built upon whatever it is you're doing right now and now that might cause a pure panic and some people to think where I'm standing right now is built on everything I've been doing for the last 49 years I need to get insurance I mean there and that's the truth iiz I'm the product today of things that have happened in my life and things that bring me to this moment but I think it's nice to know that if the Lord carries I can start doing things now with a vision with the heart to accomplish things for God say well then I may not be able to go to college now I may not be able to get that dream job but what can I do today what can I be doing today to meet that goal later kind of like uh what what they do University Michigan go Blue they have a thing like what are you doing today to beat Ohio State well whatever they've been doing the last few years is working and that's the kind of that's the way that they attack every day as football players what are you doing today not going to wait till the game right I had to bring Sports into to wake a few people up it's it's not waiting until the time comes I'm a football player well I'm this and I'm that I'm a man I'm gonna be a husband I'm I'm going to be a father I'm gonna be a leader I'm gonna be a preacher I'm gonna be this what are you doing today what are you doing today to make you get you in a place where God could use you later brother Braham talks about our Consecration and our surrendered life that hidden life so that you can find yourself welcome back brother Michael uh you could find yourself in a place where God knows where you are when he wants to use you so it's not so much just well I'm just going to wait till he wants to use me put yourself in position to be used he's going to be reaching for a tool so as a tool get in your place somebody goes to find you he's got the tool he needs to use and this is this is part of the idea that I'm wanting to present in the image of the foundation laying a good foundation what's going to be built in your lives what is it you're dreaming of what is it you're wanting to be used for what is it you're going to be supporting what's going to be in the future then that what you're doing today is supporting what's going to be in the future so the foundation of this Temple was important as much detail as we see here in 2 Chronicles 3 as much detail in chapter 5 and chapter 6 as much detail as we can glean out of the scriptures there there there's things that are said about the foundation that are so important to catch because everything else and its weight and its Grandeur and its beauty is all seted on something that might not even necessarily be seen in First Kings chap 5: 13 to 18 we stopped at verse 12 earlier Solomon's wisdom that God had given him was being manifested in the way that he's procuring the the Cedar and the fur says and King Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel we're going to read verse 13 to verse 18 and the levy was 30,000 men and he sent them to Lebanon 10,000 a month by courses a month they were in Lebanon and two months at home and adoram was over the levy so here he's thinking I need to send laborers we need to we need to have rotation we're going to think through this we're going to be we're going to think about well how good would it be to send the men away for a long time and keep away from their wives and family so let's do rotations let's not burn anybody out Solomon had three score and 10,000 that bear burdens and four score thousand huers in the mountains beside the chief of Solon officer which was officers which were over the work 3,300 which ruled over the people that wrought in the work a lot of details here the labor force that's necessary now let's look at the foundation and the King commanded and they brought great Stones costly stones and huge stones to lay the foundation of the house and Solomon's Builders and Ham's Builders did Hue them and the stone quars so they prepared Timber and stones to build the house so when it came time to build the house he wasn't just getting good wood he wasn't just getting good gold he wasn't just getting good materials to furnish and finish it out and fur it out and make it all look real beautiful but he said I want to have great Stones as my Foundation they brought great stones and not just big but costly hu prepared beforehand just as it's prophesied of Christ I'm going to lay a foundation stone and four foundation stone it's going to be a precious stone it's going to be a tried Stone it's going to be a sure Stone it's the same thing here costly great hued things were shaped beforehand tried shaped carved out to be set in it and the Builders of Solomon and and heram and the the stone cores they prepared the timber they prepared the stones as we read later well beforehand to fit into the temple and the description of the foundation great costly cut shaped Stones that's how our foundation has to be great it's got to come with the price it's got to come with sacrifice shaping a cutting down and the sermon Fellowship by Redemption I didn't provide any of the quotations tonight on slides apologize just a lack of maybe energy and time today it says and I'm believing that the day that we're living now the most essential thing that I could think of any Minister speaking of is to get the people people back to the general principles of the Gospel coming back to a place coming back to bedrock to absolutes to things that we know are sure you are built upon the foundations of the Apostles and Prophets The Chief Cornerstone being Christ himself there's no other Foundation that can be laid than Jesus Christ so we got to come back to these things one of the most essential things that we could be preaching are the general principles of the Gospel that there could be a little bit of a temptation of saying well we we want to get into the deeper things and we want to get into the uh the the the real weigher things of the message of the hour and those things but those things are built upon the foundational things do you realize listen and I if I say this wrong forgive me and and give me a decade maybe to refine the way I'm saying it but do you realize 1963 from Seals post to 1965 is resting upon the foundation of 47-63 it's not like brother Bram just showed up and said now turn to Revelations chapter 5 like go ahead Mr brandham whoever you are young guy go ahead break break it down for me just the his entire life and his suffering and and his testimony up to the time that they start recording sermons we're where are we if we just start pushing play on God hiding himself in Simplicity it's built upon his entire Ministry and the Vindication and all those things tied together so that we're not just cherry-picking stories and testimonies and prayer lines we realizing that God laid a great foundation and did a lot to invest himself in this prophet's Ministry so that when it came to these great things that he would be breaking these great Revelations it would be built upon something else we'd have a foundation so brother say the most essential thing is this getting back to general principles of the Gospel in other words you need to know your ABCs to do your algebra for if you're not built upon the right foundation it's just it's no good what's the use of building upon a foundation that's already been condemned this takes some wisdom in our own lives to realize if we need to shape anything up and say well things aren't the way they should be in this home if things aren't the way they should be in my life and we go to just start remodeling our lives but we didn't recognize it was condemnation of the substructure it was calling out the foundation there might be some things you've built that are good but you tried to build them on the wrong kind of foundation she she says what's the use of building on something that's already condemned what would be the use of trying to paper and paint an old building that the government government had condemned paper and paint that might amount to what a lot of people do with their lives they try to paper and paint something that's already condemned and that's what many people are trying to do today by reforming trying to reform we'll start a church we'll turn a page we'll try to do a little different than what we used to do there's so many examples of this where even situations that don't quite work out whether it be in families what some people uh recently well I need to be very careful what I say here I won't even say it oh you should have heard it though but there's things that happen there's situations that transpire and people are upset with what it is and they go and they start something new and they just replicate what they left and they set themselves up to experience the same thing again because they they just tried to change the Optics and put a lot of paper pain and they didn't realize the foundation was wrong to begin with he says that they're just trying to reform just start a new church turn a page we'll try to do a little different than we used to do just a little different you'll never get nowhere like that it's just foolish to even try you're just only wasting time hope you're hearing this make it applicable what I'm reading in this sermon Fellowship by Redemption there were several part passages in here that were just speaking so specifically to foundations and I realized brother saying a lot that can be applied in a lot of different ways and and coming back to the gospel rebuke of denominations but I'm wanting us to glean from it this General principle of Foundations and beginning work and what things are resting upon and not just trying to paper and paint the the current Optics of something but asking myself is it on the right kind of Bedrock maybe you bought the paper and the paint and you're wanting to build later and you you're wanting to do something later and you're early on in your life recognize now before you ever start applying paper and paint what can I do now to be sure that I'm not wasting my time later it's foolish to even try you're only wasting your time you say well now I believe if we would just quit if I would just quit me li My Lying and me lying and stealing my lying and stealing and all the he says if that if I could just stop doing bad things my me interjecting there he says all those things as good as they are you're still a million miles off the road you've got to start back to the foundation you got to build a new place not patch up the old one build a brand new one you got to come back start right that's the reason you see so many faulty mistakes so many people indifferent people who profess Christianity now that might sound like a really harsh rebuke but it's actually just a beautiful correction the reason why we see mistakes indifference in people who profess to believe this message is because they didn't get on the right foundation to me in a lot of ways you could just extrapolate this out realize that's why a lot of people fall apart and a and their lives they backslide or they leave or they get bitter towards the message they didn't they weren't built on the right foundation and in many cases it's not necessarily their fault they were being taught and given things that weren't good for a foundation legalism the worship of a man uh culture politics Church identity uh uh a lot of lot of things to build well we're standing on this we're standing on this you just kicked that chair right from out of under him and their whole house of cards falls apart and like man I don't have anything to do with the message it's just theater it's just a house of cards it's just a bunch of hypocrisy and know they're actually right about what they experienced and they didn't have the right kind of foundation because a lot of other people experien the same blows and they notice their house of cards fall down but they realized they had good Bedrock they had good foundation but they had made the mistake of building the wrong things on it and they got down to base and they said you know what my identity in this Foundation this is a revelation not some sort of Fascination and I can't I can't change where I'm at but I got to build differently going forward you can't just you got to build a new place not just patch up the old one it speaks to us of the importance of laying a good foundation I have to confess I've been doing my best to preach a two-hour sermon lately and I can't even get to an hour and so tonight I'm just determined I actually just started adding stuff in later just asking chat GPT here's my sermon what would be good at the end for another 30 minutes and it just starts spitting a lot of good stuff out I'm just kidding I didn't do that I'm just vamping to get more time the importance of laying a good foundation it it's so necessary and as we've talked about the kingdom we've talked about the future home and we've looked a lot at the the things in the future a lot of those things over the last few years we've been looking at the beginning of things things and the end of things and that's just kind of how how we've been doing the overview but as we even look at the the New Jerusalem the city of God it's it speaks to how the importance of laying a good foundation Revelations CH 21:14 and the wall of the city had 12 foundations and in them the names of the twel Apostles of the Lamb so it just didn't build a wall but had foundations for the wall there's so much that goes into things you you you may look at a straight wall and like oh I I I want a wall just like that and you go by the stone and you go by the brick and you and you buy everything that you see and then and then you begin to uh lay them try to lay them straight and make yourself a wall I'm willing to bet that that wall is going to look like talk about Serpentine right I mean this thing just weaving in and out and leaning this way leaning that way because it takes it takes a a Mason it takes someone who knows what they're doing to to build a wall and one of the things that happens first is well what's going to be holding up all this brick and is the ground strong enough how high is it going to be how much is it going to weigh it once it once it begins to settle is it going to stay upright so sometimes you may see a wall and you think wow okay so they used tin bricks and they did this and they did that and you don't realize that they had to dig six feet deep right lay down railroad ties and every 10 ft lay a dead man in there and dig it out to hold it all together and you never actually see see any of that but the rest of it's built on top of it and here you could see uh uh walls oh my look at these walls but what about their Foundation they had 12 foundations Verse 18 and the beginning the building of the wall of it was of Jasper and the city was pure gold like under Clear G GL glass and the foundations of the wall of the city were garnished with all manner of precious stones then this is not just the garnishing this is the Foundation the First Foundation was Jasper the second Sapphire the third calcy the fourth and emerald the fifth sardonix the sixth sardius the seventh chrysite the eighth Burl the ninth topaz the 10th choperas sis the the 11th ajacent the 12th and Amethyst these are these are the actual foundations it's not that they just kind of kind of hued a stone and said give me a sapphire dink isn't that nice to got a little no this is God and what I I love to just imagine is how that God when he created the heavens and the Earth like where are these materials coming from when he did in the beginning he laid certain things in the earth if he laid the Cornerstone in you before the foundation of the world he's laying the very Foundation of even the New Jerusalem when he begins to create you were there the city was there the stones were there the very wood of that tree that Christ would be crucified on he sewed into the Earth in creation and begin to grow trees knowing that one day a tree would come forth that the Savior would be hung on the very iron that made the nails that H that nailed him to the cross and fastened the Son of God to a cross as we begin to think about the res the crucifixion and Resurrection this week God put the ore in the earth when he created it man didn't mix that in a in in an ear he didn't have some sort of formula in Minecraft to be able to build you know uh to build nails to crucify the Messiah God put it in there in the beginning and each precious stone was not just an ornament but a pillar itself the Foundation itself of the walls this is the importance of laying a good foundation I am going to make maybe the risk pulling you right now individually but is this going all right Hunter am I doing is this okay do you approve just kind of some tur lips told you I was taking a risk especially asking a young guy like this he's like sorry bud but it I I trust it's going okay for you because it's very simple I'm just want you to think about what it takes to lay a foundation you want to have a good future what does it take have a good found what is it going to take a a good foundation yeah you want you want your family to go the right way good foundation you want your children to go in the way that they should go train them up in the way that they should go there's work that you put in in the beginning the this is the importance of laying a good foundation even in building his own house if you want to turn to First Kings chapter 7 Solomon did the same thing with his own house the palace that would just be there next to the temple that's part of this great big huge complex that was being built it's got to have foundations that's got to have Bedrock First Kings 7: 1-12 I'm not going to try to preach two hours tonight I'm just trying to at least get to an hour says and all these were of costly Stones according to the measure of the hu of hug Stones I wanted to uh read more in this but in verse one but Solomon was building his own house 13 years and he finished all of his house and he built the house of the forest of Lebanon and he begins to describe the length of it and the windows and the doors and the post and the porch and the pillars a a and the porch within and and then the house he built for Pharaoh's daughter there's so much that's being built here but now it says this is kind of the the foundation all these were of costly Stones according to the measures of HW Stones sawed with saws within and without even from the foundation unto the coping and so on the outside toward the great Court everything's costly expensive and the foundation was of costly Stones even great Stones he's not sparing any expense in the foundation if I could say this if you're going to skimp don't do it in the foundation don't go to build as they said that I think the temple around 2,700 square feet or something like that can't remember just what they say about that say well you know we're going to have gold and gold pomegranates and gold palms and gold chains and gold this and gold that and it's just going to be so rich and Majestic so we we since we're going to put a bunch of money in that why don't we just kind of sweep sweep The Rock off a little bit and just clear a patch no they had to go with costly Stones great Stones stones of 10 cubits and stones of eight cubits and above were costly stones after the measure of hug stones and Cedars and the great Court round about was with three rows of huge stones and a row of Cedar beams both for the inner Court of the house of the Lord and for the porch of the house and what are they all resting upon this costly strong Foundation Solomon laid a good foundation for the house of the Lord Solomon laid a good foundation for his house he laid the foundations of very deep in the ground he used hard durable Stones H uh stones that were Humane that could stand the pressure could stand the test in other words I I want to make a foundation that'll last that'll be there I remember when we built a house in Texas and we had to drill the these pillars these footings and they had to go like I can't remember how many feet over 20 feet maybe 30 feet there's like 18 of them or 20 of them and they had to drill them until they got to bedrock and and and Bally the engineer when they were done says well this whole area can get flooded and your house will just be standing on stilts because you you put enough in it you're like this house isn't going anywhere this this is not going to settle this is not going to shift at least that's what we told the buyers no but you use durable Stones they they had their own inspections stop the tape that the stones they used this was a part that I found remarkable as I was studying this they were to become part of the Earth itself no more the days of just a temporary Tabernacle in the wilderness but the foundation stone were to be United with the Earth itself so that the structure itself was United with the Earth in the base the the these pillars these structures upon that they became the basis the foundation the sheer foundation for the superstructure to be built the pillars as brother talks about them being the support of the superstructure and it to build I'm wanting to read a statement in close to build the foundation you had to take into consideration the complete the vastness of the temple itself for Solomon to build the right foundation he had to take into consideration what uh uh to build his house he had to take into consideration when he built the foundation for his house he had to know what he wanted his house to look like the temple was going to be grand it was going to be heavy it was going to be strong expensive of great imp importance and if it was going to house God that's where he was going to dwell he didn't want to cut Corners he didn't want to just build it any way the foundation had to be laid correctly I'm asking you what are you building what is it you want to look like what do you want to accomplish what do you want to succeed and I'm I I I'm wanting to challenge you with this thought of whatever you want your future to look like then you have to give thought to what you're doing today that that what it will be present then is built on your past which is now right and you got to know will it fit whether it be through indolence or Indulgence you just lay around and you don't do anything you're not trying hard you're not working well the product in the end is probably going to reflect the laziness the Indulgence and things of the world the lack of foresight the lack of care and concern as a family we are listening to a sermon this past week where brother bam says I think it's in the sermon job where brother bam talks about I'd like to use some of these statements maybe coming up brother bam says it's a shame that parents don't take interest in their children anymore they they're not thoughtful about the time that they're spending with other things they're not spending time with them they've been kind of lulled to sleep and so many things are happening not realizing before you know it it gets away from you and they're gone like what did I do what how did I did I did I prepare him for life so this Temple was important so what it rest upon was very important in the sermon Fellowship by Redemption brother bam again he's kind of connecting on the well I want to stop this I'm going to try this I'm G to try that I'm going to go to church and and all those things that we could try to do that's if I can say it's the paper and the paint but the question is what's it built on he says and these are fine all these other things are all right I have nothing against it but that's still not the basis don't build upon that alone intellectual Faith come back to the basis here get it in here and I would say that not being present I say that it doesn't it can't be intellectual here it's got to be a revelation here the Revelation is the rock the Revelation is the stone upon which you are built it's the stone upon which the church is built the Chief Cornerstone Christ is the revelation of Jesus Christ the new birth is the personal revelation of Jesus Christ to you you've got to be built on that it's something that we realize even in raising our own children we want to teach them we want to teach them in a way where they can have integrity and they can have character but if they're ever going to be real genuine Christians they've got to have an experience themselves he says you want to have have it inhere to fellowship with him to talk with him and then build on these other things bring these other things under that foundation so if you got to love these other things there that's great that's fine but really they don't work until they come back to the foundation they're designed for for man think about all these things that were going to be in the temple pomegranates Palms made of gold chains made of gold all these things all these really nice things if they just kind of set them up uh uh in some spot just set them up on the threshing floor of Ora if they would have had that there and be like oh okay this is Nate this is great all the same elements would not have been as functional and would have not been what God wanted and they could and and it would have been oh this thing's a mess but take the same things and put them on the right foundation like now that's that's what we're looking for I say that too especially to those of us here on a Wednesday night man I would say coming to church on a Wednesday night doesn't save you not even any indication that you are saved and a and it's not necessarily A should be a feather in your cap or something that you get puffed up about but doing this is a good brick this is a good brick this is a good uh element a resource this is a a great thing in your wall but you got to be sure that the foundation's there so that bricks like this fit together and Wednesday night after Wednesday night is Brick by Brick amen building something that'll last he says bring these other things on the right foundation but you're trying to bring these fundament fundamental truths upon a foundation that has nothing to do to it he says brother wood somewhere in the building is a contractor well what good it to him to take an old building that's worm eaten termites have eaten the building down and it's rotten to the foundation and go out and get some of the best Lumber that he could find good Dy season Redwood tack it on the house go out there and get paint That's recommended by the highest paint company in the world he said look at here preacher I can show you that this is the real genuine Redwood I'd say yes brother wood that's right now can you make this personal just this analogy he's using how is it applicable in our own lives where we're bragging about real good Redwood we're bragging about the best kind of paint but our foundation isn't right all the Optics and pretense sometimes that we can engage in his message Believers well brother Bram said it you know brother Bram said it say right here I can print it out for you well what what are you building all these quotes on what's the basis what do you want it to look like in the end you got the best paint you got the best Redwood you got all the best quotes he says he says but look at here here's the seal of approval that this is the best paint that could ever be put on a house that's right brother wood but your foundation is wrong it's got to come down wow you mean I can have all the best Redwood can have all the best paint I can have all the best um understandings of the message and I can have all the best quotations and scriptures and all these personal experiences and have all these things but if the foundation's not right the rest of it has to come down he said that's what's the matters we read earlier he said that's what's the matter with faulty mistakes and indifference in people who profess Christianity the foundation's not right he says your foundation's wrong it's got to come down everything you've been building up now let me caution this the Redwoods good maybe the paint job's good said but you got to bring it down and he says take all those things that you've built and put them on the right foundation that's what's the matter reading the scriptures right preaching the gospel is right but your foundation's wrong tear out your mental conception of things and get God In Your Heart by the shedding of the blood and then build from there your wood is all right if you've got it on the right foundation there you are I I I I know as I said earlier that the things he's saying has a very specific application in terms of even salvation and coming to the Bedrock of a the shed blood of Christ re washing the cner and being born again but it's a principle that we can apply over and over again as we go forward is this is today built upon the right foundation of yesterday and if yesterday wasn't the right foundation do today what you should have done yesterday so that the next day you can do what you were supposed to do with the right kind of foundation don't try to play catchup and get it all done today no get on the right kind of basis today it W's all right if you got the right foundation there you are just don't be angry with me now may cut a little bit but this is the truth this is what helps you go back to the right foundation to the fellowship oh it's beautiful encourage you to listen to that Fellowship by Redemption there's a number of number of other places I would have liked to have read different examples where brother bam talks about a foundation what's what it's built on but let me close with this Brothers you can come to your in instruments in Psalms 11: 3 and 4 it asks this question if the foundations be destroyed what can the righteous do the Lord is in his holy Temple the Lord's Throne is in heaven his eyes behold his eyelids try the children of men what an image to talk about the Lord in his holy Temple the throne which is in heaven and now we see this mirror on Earth the throne room the most holy place the greater house the Holy Temple the outer Court the inner Court the outer court all this all these things his eyes that do Behold The Children of Men to try them and the question is asked if you destroy the foundations what happens to the righteous again these foundations are not just physical it's not that all the righteous were kind of standing on a slab and if you destroyed that where would they go what would they do but it's the principles upon which something is built the laws by which something is governed I wonder sometimes I'll just say this to us as individuals I wonder sometimes if we don't start removing things from the message of the hour because we don't think it's essential and because the time that we're living in and we don't realize that we're kind of shedding away the foundation foundations of Holiness the foundations of decent see and abstaining from the things of the world the foundation of how a man ought to a man ought to look and a woman ought to look the foundation of our marriages and what they're built upon and just seems like anymore it's not uncommon to find this brother divorced that sister divorced them getting married together and and everybody acting like well I mean it's 2024 what do we do and we're not reminding ourselves you know what there's a there was a basis that we had that formed the foundation of this message and though people might find themselves in difficult situations they lose their way for a little while and things happen and I get it and I'm certainly not wanting to be condemning of any particular situation but let's not forget the Bedrock upon which we're built and think that we could just kind of kick out the whole thing and be a Capstone just a hovering Capstone like this is some sort of magic like a an unidentified flying object just hovering in Maricopa Valley but it's a pyramid it's perfect no it's got to rest upon a base Faith's final resting place is on the word of God it's got to have solid foundation if the foundation be destroyed what's going to last the principles that were built upon the laws by which something is governed whether we say the principles of vindication and the prophit the the the very things that we're built upon the very things that H have got us to where we are today in a positive sense if the the the scripture here the foundations be destroyed it's a lot that's being alluded to in in the psalm but it said if the foundations of what's good and right the foundations of order and the law and Justice is destroyed what will last this kingdom is built upon principles this kingdom was built upon an order and and the word of God and a certain attitude towards righteousness I if you get rid of that it's Lawless it's chaos nothing will succeed and what does it say if the foundation be destroyed and I express this to all of us if you got a good foundation if you lose lose that what's going to how how can you last and if things are teetering and things are being shaking and you realize man I haven't been putting in the work I don't have a foundation lay for yourself a foundation a pattern of good works the scripture says this is it becomes part of your foundation start doing things right now right now amen start doing things right right now there's are things that we can do and I I want to convey in a way that delivers a lot of gra to say to not think man I've been married so many years I've been raising my children so many years I've been in the messes so many years and you look back and it's chaotic and it's not a good foundation you've got mixed up in this you got mixed up in that you might feel where you are now you're just completely starting all over you don't have anything it's charred ruins it's like brother bradam says it's all termite eaten tore down and and God's not saying yeah it's all condemned just give up he's saying if I could put this way and and I'm glad he's maybe not as cruel as we can be sometimes but he'd say wellow I mean what what did you expect Aaron you weren't building where I told you to build yeah you had a lot of good Redwood you had a lot of good paint but you got to build on the foundation and if you'll just build on the foundation it'll come up right and it's not too late to make sure our foundation is right brother Ram even in his own Ministry come off the field was coming to the end of the year he was going to quit preaching he was going to go get his old job back and he's like I'm a failure told his family I'm going to quit preaching I'm go see my old boss I want to get my the job I used to have back I'm not going to preach anymore and he laid in bed that night feeling like a failure like I've blown it the Miracles the signs and wonders here he is after all these years almost 30 years of just Dynamic Miracles and around the world so so many times and now he goes back to Jeffersonville little house of nobody and he's going to quit he lays in bed that night thinking about what the next year is going to hold he's like yeah I'm going to be back just in the workforce felt like a failure what was it all for what did it all amount to it's as if as if it was all for not and God gives them a vision three different parts culminating in a cathedral like Tabernacle Temple the vision we call maybe the tent Vision it was going to be the crowning the culmination the climax of his ministry and nothing was wasted God promises he'll use all things and to think that some of your garbage and some of your mistakes and some of the things you've done you might feel like I've made a mess God looks
