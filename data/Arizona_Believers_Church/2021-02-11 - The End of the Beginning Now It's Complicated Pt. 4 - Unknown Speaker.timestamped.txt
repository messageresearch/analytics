[0:02] deuteronomy chapter 30
[0:03] verse 6 it reads and the lord thy god
[0:06] will circumcise thine heart
[0:08] and the heart of thy seed to love the
[0:10] lord thy god with all thine heart
[0:12] with all thy soul that thou mayest live
[0:15] and the lord thy god will put all these
[0:17] curses upon thine enemies and on them
[0:19] that hate thee
[0:20] which persecuted thee and that thou
[0:22] shalt return and obey the voice of the
[0:24] lord and do all his commandments which i
[0:26] command thee this day
[0:28] and the lord thy god will make thee
[0:29] plenteous in every work of thy hand
[0:31] in the fruit of thy body and in the
[0:33] fruit of thy cattle and in the fruit of
[0:35] thy land for good
[0:36] for the lord will again rejoice over
[0:38] thee for good as he rejoiceth
[0:40] over thy fathers if thou shalt hearken
[0:42] unto the voice of the lord thy god to
[0:44] keep his commandments and his statutes
[0:46] which are written in this book of the
[0:47] law and if thou turn unto the lord thy
[0:49] god with all thine heart and with all
[0:51] thy soul
[0:52] for this commandment which i command
[0:53] thee this day it is not hidden from thee
[0:56] neither is it far off
[0:57] it is not in heaven that thou should say
[0:59] who shall go up for us to heaven and
[1:01] bring it unto us
[1:02] that we may hear it and do it neither is
[1:04] it beyond the sea that thou should
[1:06] say who shall go over the sea for us and
[1:08] bring it unto us that we may hear it and
[1:10] do it
[1:11] but the word is very nigh unto thee in
[1:13] thy mouth
[1:14] and in thy heart that thou mayest do us
[1:16] it see i have set before thee this day
[1:19] life and good and good and death and
[1:22] evil
[1:22] i want to just focus on that contrast
[1:25] life and good
[1:26] and death and evil and that i command
[1:28] thee this day to love the lord thy god
[1:29] to walk in his ways and to keep his
[1:31] commandments
[1:32] and his statutes and his judgments that
[1:34] thou mayest live and multiply
[1:35] and the lord thy god shall bless thee
[1:37] not in the land whether thou goest to
[1:39] possess it
[1:40] but if thine heart turn away so that
[1:41] thou will not hear but shall be drawn
[1:43] away and worship other gods and serve
[1:45] them
[1:46] i denounce unto you this day that ye
[1:48] shall surely perish
[1:49] that ye shall not prolong your days upon
[1:52] this land
[1:52] upon the land whether thou passeth over
[1:54] jordan to go possess it
[1:56] i call heaven and earth record this day
[1:58] against you that i have set before you
[2:00] life and death
[2:01] blessing and cursing therefore choose
[2:03] life that both thou and thy seed may
[2:05] live
[2:05] that thou mayest love the lord thy god
[2:07] that thou mayest obey his voice
[2:09] and that thou mayest cleave unto him for
[2:11] he is thy life
[2:13] and the length of thy days that thou
[2:15] mayest dwell in the land which the lord
[2:16] swear unto thy fathers to abraham to
[2:18] isaac
[2:19] and to jacob to give them amen you may
[2:22] be seated
[2:27] continuing on the subject of the end of
[2:29] the beginning
[2:30] and the title includes
[2:34] the phrase now it's complicated i'm
[2:36] hoping to
[2:38] wrap up this particular part on now it's
[2:41] complicated
[2:42] but just to use a few things here at the
[2:45] outset
[2:46] to recapture where we were on sunday
[2:48] morning
[2:49] we were examining how we're not living
[2:51] in an innocent world
[2:52] and i think that that's uh that's a
[2:54] phrase that has a lot of
[2:56] meaning to it innocent not just in the
[2:59] the likeness of an innocent child but
[3:00] rather just in terms of things being
[3:02] very simple being very straightforward
[3:05] so we're not living in an innocent world
[3:07] it's a world with dishonest motives
[3:09] and we looked at that how questions can
[3:11] be asked and things can be done it's a
[3:13] world that has dishonest objectives
[3:15] and we are taught that behind everything
[3:17] there is a spirit
[3:19] motive and objective and that is
[3:21] anything
[3:22] everything and there's not very many
[3:24] things even though they may be inanimate
[3:26] in themselves if they're a product of
[3:28] the creative process if it's something
[3:30] that man has invented or something that
[3:32] man has designed
[3:33] then there's some motive spirit and
[3:35] objective behind
[3:36] that so there's many different traps and
[3:38] pitfalls that we have to avoid
[3:40] and at the very least there's a lot of
[3:42] distractions there's a lot of things
[3:44] that kind of get our attention and kind
[3:45] of get us
[3:46] excited so we have to be very careful in
[3:48] the day and age that we're living in
[3:50] to not reach that tipping point or that
[3:52] spot where we spill over on the other
[3:54] side
[3:54] of modesty or moderation or give
[3:56] ourselves into things that can distract
[3:58] us and we've been
[4:00] uh wanting to emphasize this in the last
[4:02] couple services a few services that we
[4:04] face
[4:05] choices and when we whenever we make a
[4:08] choice as a consequence
[4:09] so we're facing choices and subsequent
[4:11] consequences that are the product of the
[4:14] end of the beginning that when genesis
[4:16] chapter 3 when man was tempted and fell
[4:19] or the woman was tempted and mankind
[4:20] fell we now today are facing many
[4:23] different choices and the consequences
[4:25] from our own decisions
[4:27] that go back to that time and instance
[4:29] in the beginning
[4:30] and maybe to some of us it's kind of an
[4:33] obvious statement but then for others it
[4:34] might be like well how can you
[4:36] tie everything back to that the life
[4:38] that we're living now
[4:39] is not the same life that were live they
[4:41] were living in genesis one and two
[4:43] and so there's something that has been
[4:45] brought upon mankind by virtue of the
[4:47] fall
[4:48] and we're reminded that we're living in
[4:49] satan's eden not god's eden
[4:52] and not just the beginning of satan's
[4:55] eden that we can read in genesis 4 even
[4:57] through
[4:58] chapter 12 and 11 and there where we can
[5:01] begin to see just the unfolding
[5:03] after um after the garden of eden we're
[5:06] not living
[5:06] in those times we're living not in the
[5:08] beginning of satan seeing but in the
[5:10] climax of it
[5:11] where everything that mankind has been
[5:13] doing is accumulating and maturing and
[5:15] growing and it's coming to a particular
[5:17] place here in the end where the uh the
[5:20] satan's eden is blooming it's blossoming
[5:23] it's coming to
[5:24] its climax and to its fullness and
[5:27] so we want to keep that in mind we're
[5:29] not living in god's eden we're living in
[5:31] satan's eden
[5:32] and satan's approach in the garden was
[5:34] to use a question
[5:35] kind of and it's used symbolically in
[5:37] scripture but yet he opens it up
[5:38] with the questions the serpent
[5:40] approaching him of the woman and using a
[5:42] question to provoke thought to kind of
[5:44] provoke a conversation
[5:46] and the language of that question is
[5:48] used symbolically in the scripture
[5:50] and then he follows up the question with
[5:52] a lie so he uses a question he uses a
[5:55] lie
[5:56] and he's offering all knowledge as we
[5:57] said last time without context
[6:00] he's using he's using knowledge now in
[6:02] such a way to where
[6:04] uh he wants to ask a question he wants
[6:06] to get thoughts maybe provide a few
[6:07] facts but he's doing it without the
[6:09] proper context
[6:10] that if she acts upon this this is
[6:13] actually what's really going to happen
[6:15] and he kind of hides that part from it
[6:17] and he frames it in a way that's a
[6:18] little bit more easy to swallow
[6:20] and if he did that then in the beginning
[6:22] how do you think things are now
[6:24] if that was his drive in the beginning
[6:26] if that was his approach in the
[6:27] beginning that was the way he was going
[6:28] to go about in the beginning
[6:30] then we're kind of reaching the age
[6:31] where satan feels like he's kind of hit
[6:32] his stride
[6:34] and it feels like he's hit his groove
[6:35] and and he's got it figured out he's
[6:37] been studying mankind for 6 000 years
[6:40] and so he's using these same tactics and
[6:42] the world is trained in these tactics
[6:44] to bring confusion and complication to
[6:46] people's lives
[6:48] and i want we've wanted to look at the
[6:50] challenge that the woman faced in the
[6:52] garden this way
[6:53] the woman was presented with the choice
[6:55] that she never had to
[6:56] was never supposed to make she had been
[6:58] given the word of god and god had made
[7:00] the choice for her the word of god had
[7:02] told her
[7:03] don't you eat of it for that day that
[7:05] you eat thereof that's the day that you
[7:07] die
[7:07] so she was not supposed to be put into
[7:09] the position where she would consider it
[7:12] she wasn't supposed to be in the
[7:13] position to even ponder it
[7:15] so satan put her in the place where now
[7:17] she's considered an alternative she's
[7:19] beginning to wonder about it she's
[7:21] trying to figure her way out through
[7:22] this
[7:23] and it's through that question and the
[7:24] subsequent lie attached to it that she
[7:27] begins she gets ensnared she's trapped
[7:29] we use the word entangled and so is
[7:32] looking at things as complicated we're
[7:34] talking about things that are not clear
[7:36] or confusing
[7:37] even things that seem unpredictable or
[7:38] irrational there's no consistency to it
[7:41] there's no clear rules of approaching it
[7:43] no order to approach it
[7:45] and so when we look at something that's
[7:47] complex it may be confusing to us it may
[7:49] seem complicated to us
[7:51] but yet somebody who knows the organism
[7:53] somebody that knows that flight deck as
[7:54] we use the example on sunday
[7:56] we have that dreamliner flight deck
[7:58] there for you brother james for you to
[7:59] take a look at
[8:00] in the slide that we used that you could
[8:02] look at it and immediately to a captain
[8:03] they're like oh look everything's just
[8:05] right where it needs to be isn't this
[8:06] nice
[8:07] and to us it could be explained as to
[8:09] where we may be able to begin to
[8:10] understand
[8:10] oh well that's why they put that there
[8:12] and that's why they put that there
[8:14] and that's the difference between
[8:15] something that can be complex whereas
[8:17] something's complicated
[8:18] study it all you want if somebody's made
[8:20] it complicated you may not be able to
[8:22] figure it out
[8:23] if it's intentionally meant to be
[8:25] deceiving there may be no rationale at
[8:27] the end of the day that you come to and
[8:28] say
[8:29] well i figured it out and i'm sure
[8:31] you've experienced that before where
[8:33] um you're asked to do something and it's
[8:34] based upon some
[8:36] assumptions or you assume certain things
[8:38] about it and you begin to take place
[8:40] in figuring it out or putting it
[8:41] together or doing something you realize
[8:43] oh well i didn't have all the pieces to
[8:45] the puzzle i didn't have
[8:47] i didn't have all the information that i
[8:49] needed to have in order to begin in this
[8:51] and that's what makes things complicated
[8:53] when things are incomplete things are
[8:55] not prese not as they are presented to
[8:58] you so
[8:58] rules and order and structure and the
[9:00] word of god is meant to put us
[9:03] to bring though it may be complex and
[9:06] there's many facets to it it's to give
[9:07] us something to be very simple towards
[9:10] something we can believe in and walk in
[9:12] to remove all the complexity of life
[9:14] and to avoid the complications and the
[9:17] very word complicated means to weave
[9:19] together
[9:19] like a web or to entangle and we looked
[9:22] at scriptures how that the affairs of
[9:23] this life
[9:24] seek to entangle our minds and our
[9:27] attention and draw away our
[9:28] resources and what's the conclusion in
[9:30] ecclesiastes
[9:31] vanity the things that entangle us the
[9:34] things that dominate our minds the
[9:35] things that draw
[9:36] us away from what is important those
[9:37] things are vanity
[9:39] and so that's the world that we're
[9:40] living in we're living in a world that's
[9:42] not innocent but our minds are not
[9:43] innocent
[9:45] our minds and emotions can betray us our
[9:47] feelings can deceive us and there's
[9:48] things
[9:49] that we really really want because we
[9:50] think we're going to enjoy it we don't
[9:52] enjoy it when we get it
[9:53] or things that we thought were
[9:55] beneficial and things that we thought
[9:56] were harmless can eventually be
[9:58] not to our benefit and actually harmful
[10:01] and that's our feelings and our emotions
[10:03] and our passions
[10:04] that betray us we could just do a simple
[10:06] memory experiment right now tonight just
[10:08] to show how often our memory fails us
[10:11] they did a study and they asked i think
[10:12] it was thousands of people they asked
[10:14] them to describe
[10:15] the moment that they saw the the first
[10:18] plane on september 11
[10:19] 2001 strike the uh the towers
[10:22] and hundreds of them if not thousands
[10:24] could distinctly remember on september
[10:27] 11th
[10:28] viewing and watching the first on tv
[10:30] watch the first airplane strike the
[10:32] towers
[10:32] now i could do the test right now and
[10:34] ask how many remember that
[10:36] on september 11th watching that first
[10:38] plane hit the tower
[10:39] and you all are very very wise to not
[10:41] raise your hands
[10:42] because that video didn't come out till
[10:44] later but
[10:46] your memory fails you it turns it into a
[10:48] fill room and they'll take a snippet of
[10:49] something later and insert it into
[10:51] another member and you create a film on
[10:53] september 11th oh i remember i was there
[10:55] at starbucks and i remember they had it
[10:57] on the screen
[10:58] and we all gathered around and watched
[10:59] the first tower strike the first plane
[11:01] strike the tower and you don't even
[11:03] realize how kind of crazy that was that
[11:04] you all got around the tv at that moment
[11:06] you know to watch it the first plane hit
[11:08] the towers but yet our minds
[11:10] fail us it tricks us it confuses us and
[11:13] so those are some things that we were
[11:14] mentioning on sunday just how much that
[11:16] our minds
[11:17] uh entrap us and betray us and so we
[11:19] have complicated a world
[11:21] and a complicated heart and this
[11:23] complicated heart it's for it's very
[11:25] easy to get wrapped up in many different
[11:27] issues and problems
[11:28] and questions and scenarios that just
[11:30] create tension
[11:31] it becomes a dilemma to us and
[11:33] ultimately results in our unhappiness
[11:36] can you say amen to that these are the
[11:38] things that happen in a world that's
[11:39] very complicated
[11:41] and then we have hearts that are
[11:42] complicated and we were looking at a
[11:44] statement that brother branham made
[11:46] at the very end of the message on that
[11:48] we were ministering on sunday
[11:50] now that brother branham says that every
[11:52] hospital every siren song every death
[11:54] that ever died every struggle
[11:55] every man on the battlefield every poor
[11:57] little sick afflicted baby
[12:00] was caused by disbelieving just one word
[12:03] of god's word
[12:05] and we want to take the opposite in that
[12:07] if we believe in our hearts that the
[12:09] the fall of mankind began by
[12:11] disobedience to the word and dis
[12:13] believing god's word and really i mean
[12:15] that's a comfort level just put it in
[12:17] that way because
[12:18] all of christian christendom will admit
[12:21] and at least confess
[12:22] that the fall in the beginning can be
[12:24] characterized as disobeying god's word
[12:27] so if disobedience to god's word caused
[12:30] every sickness every heartache every
[12:32] difficult situation that we face today
[12:34] then that
[12:35] is the clue to us how to make it through
[12:38] to overcome or to resolve
[12:40] every sickness every difficult situation
[12:42] every heartache
[12:43] is through believing the word of god so
[12:46] god actually
[12:47] uses the fall as a lesson to us that if
[12:50] the fall is caused by disbelieving
[12:52] if the fall is caused by disobedience
[12:54] then our access to peace and our access
[12:56] to joy and our
[12:58] access to overcoming the complexes of
[13:00] this life will be found
[13:02] in believing god's word taking god at
[13:05] his word and obeying his word
[13:07] but ever since the fall as you see the
[13:09] different things that brother branham
[13:11] mentions here
[13:11] hospitals and death and struggles and
[13:13] battlefields
[13:14] this is a fallen world and with the
[13:16] fallen mind we're trying to navigate
[13:18] through
[13:18] the minefield that is life and it's just
[13:21] a complicated maze
[13:24] life becomes a complicated maze because
[13:26] as soon as it seems like you're done
[13:27] with one task there's always another
[13:30] i was thinking of even the the greek
[13:32] fable where the one
[13:34] the scythian that had to push the rock
[13:36] up the hill
[13:38] only for it to roll back roll back down
[13:39] again and what did he do he did that
[13:41] repetitively
[13:42] and it really is that fable is really
[13:44] speaks to the truth of humanity where
[13:46] that's what we're stuck
[13:47] doing day after day after day as soon as
[13:50] even one task seems to be finished and
[13:52] you've accomplished it
[13:53] and then you roll that rock up the hill
[13:55] if you get it up the hill there's
[13:56] another task
[13:57] there's another one that you have to
[13:58] face and you have to accomplish that's
[14:00] this
[14:01] now it's complicated that's the life
[14:03] that we live now
[14:05] and we were looking at john chapter 12
[14:07] and luke chapter 10
[14:08] and mary and martha and the curious
[14:10] question of judas is maybe a way i'd
[14:12] like to refer to it
[14:13] how you had these different actors in
[14:14] this drama even lazarus being one that
[14:16] sat at the table to fellowship with
[14:18] jesus
[14:18] but you had mary in her home martha in
[14:20] her home and
[14:21] martha offering this worship to jesus
[14:24] and breaking this expensive ointment and
[14:26] pouring it
[14:26] out onto his feet and using uh using
[14:30] this worship of this spike nerd
[14:32] and judas asking the question of you
[14:34] know we could have sold that for 300
[14:36] pence and that 300 pence could have
[14:38] supported a poor family
[14:39] for an entire year don't you think we
[14:42] could have made better use
[14:44] of that oil and if we just measured it
[14:46] on the basis of what was logical what
[14:48] would do the most good to the greater
[14:50] the greater number of humanity which is
[14:52] ethics usually strives to resolve
[14:54] what's the best option and they've come
[14:56] up with this rule that whatever would do
[14:58] the greater good to the greater number
[14:59] is the most
[15:00] most ethical outcome and that guides a
[15:03] lot of disciplines because
[15:04] you're faced with the task what should
[15:05] you do have you any of you been
[15:07] challenged with the
[15:09] the railroad scenario where you have a
[15:11] train
[15:12] go a a train going down a particular
[15:15] track
[15:16] and it's lost its brakes and if it stays
[15:18] on that track it's going to run into a
[15:19] very crowded area of a city center
[15:21] that's going to kill hundreds of lives
[15:24] but if you change its direction it's
[15:25] going to go down a track that's being
[15:27] worked on
[15:28] and there's a maintenance crew of four
[15:29] people that are working if you change it
[15:31] then the train will be redirected down
[15:33] that path and only four people will die
[15:35] and you're the one that's responsible
[15:37] for switching for throwing the switch
[15:39] and determining which way it goes
[15:41] now what would you do and in order to
[15:44] try to figure that out you'd have to
[15:46] start rationalizing well
[15:47] if it just stays on the track it's going
[15:49] that's the outcome that would have been
[15:51] if i don't intervene
[15:52] so is it more ethical to allow things
[15:54] just to continue to unfold
[15:56] as it has been and let the consequences
[15:59] be what they may
[16:00] or should i intervene is a morally am i
[16:02] morally required as a
[16:04] greater ethics to change the direction
[16:06] of it and only allow a few lives to
[16:07] perish
[16:08] in saving the many has anybody heard
[16:10] that uh that
[16:12] ethical challenge before i think they
[16:14] might teach it and even in in just
[16:17] middle school and it's a very
[16:18] challenging ethical question and
[16:20] i think it's resolved by saying that
[16:22] some of the philosophers resolved it by
[16:23] saying that
[16:24] what you would do is you make the
[16:25] decision that would result in the
[16:27] greater good for the greater number of
[16:29] people
[16:30] and judas in some ways is even dealing
[16:32] with that ethical dilemma like wouldn't
[16:34] it been better to do this
[16:35] and you could quickly get sucked into
[16:37] that argument and agree
[16:38] wow we should support the poor we should
[16:40] visit the widow and
[16:42] and the fatherless and their affliction
[16:43] and we ought to give and these are
[16:44] things that we're required to do as
[16:46] christians and
[16:47] so maybe what we do is we just tell
[16:48] martha to cool it a little
[16:50] bit don't use as much sell the rest and
[16:52] support a family
[16:53] but what you don't realize is you've
[16:55] been tricked into questioning one's
[16:57] worship of jesus christ
[16:59] you've been tricked into questioning
[17:00] what one ought to give to the lord
[17:02] you've been tricked into questioning and
[17:04] devaluing what is the right thing and
[17:06] what is the good thing
[17:07] and so the world re is represented by
[17:10] judas who kind of asked that question
[17:12] not because he cared about the poor
[17:14] but because he was a thief because he
[17:15] had ulterior motives he had something
[17:17] else he was trying to accomplish
[17:19] and then marth mary would represent even
[17:22] excuse me now that if
[17:23] um mary's the one that uh then in luke
[17:26] chapter 10
[17:27] martha's the one that's washing his feet
[17:29] martha's the one that's pouring out the
[17:30] worship
[17:31] and if you look at chapter 10 luke
[17:34] chapter 10 we'll just kind of
[17:35] go through it very quickly so we can
[17:36] make a little bit better time tonight
[17:38] the question that mary asked is the
[17:41] question
[17:43] that our hearts can ask so judas would
[17:46] represent the world trying to provoke
[17:47] our hearts to reason and
[17:49] science and knowledge and facts but then
[17:51] also our hearts can become encumbered
[17:53] and it tells us that when jesus had come
[17:56] into their home
[17:57] it was mary who was cumbered about much
[17:59] serving
[18:00] and she went about trying to serve and
[18:02] get the dishes ready get the meal cooked
[18:04] and get everything ready and all the
[18:05] all the duties that would come with
[18:06] domestic life and hosting a very
[18:09] important guest and she goes to jesus
[18:11] and she asked a different question jesus
[18:13] do you not
[18:14] care that my sister has left me alone to
[18:16] serve
[18:17] but yet she sits at your feet not
[18:19] helping and even this question from our
[18:22] heart seems to
[18:23] uh would be one that we could wrestle
[18:25] with and say yes domestic duties must be
[18:27] done and
[18:28] household affairs have to be attended to
[18:30] and there's
[18:31] things that we've got to be conscious of
[18:33] and things that we have a moral duty to
[18:35] this is our own hearts that can now be
[18:37] provoked to ask a question
[18:39] but jesus rebukes her and says martha
[18:41] martha this is in verse 41
[18:43] thou art careful and troubled about many
[18:45] things
[18:47] many things not just even the household
[18:49] order not just even serving she
[18:51] was cumbered which means she was drawn
[18:53] away she was distracted in her mind when
[18:56] she was cumbered about much serving
[18:58] it was a duty that she was required to
[19:00] do but it
[19:01] it had entangled her she was not just
[19:04] busy
[19:04] she became too busy and when you when
[19:07] you're busy that's fine we're all busy
[19:09] but when you get
[19:10] too busy that means it's at the expense
[19:12] of something else that's more necessary
[19:14] it's when something else is suffering as
[19:16] a result of the busyness and he
[19:18] he says you're troubled about too many
[19:19] things he says but one
[19:21] thing is needful one thing is necessary
[19:24] it's actually the thing that he's saying
[19:25] there's only one thing necessary
[19:27] and mary have chosen that one thing that
[19:30] is necessary
[19:31] mary have chosen that good part and it's
[19:33] that good part the one thing that is
[19:34] needful the one thing that is necessary
[19:36] which shall not be taken away from her
[19:40] and so she had chosen the proper thing
[19:42] she had chosen
[19:43] the right way she had she had martha had
[19:46] taken the thing which was the most
[19:48] important
[19:48] and had done that first and this is what
[19:51] what mary struggled with is uh the much
[19:54] serving and the demands of life and it's
[19:56] applicable to us in our lives
[19:58] to choose the better part to choose the
[20:00] right thing to put god first
[20:02] to take that simple faith towards the
[20:04] word of god first and then let that
[20:06] kind of become the barometer for you or
[20:08] the the needle that you're following the
[20:09] thing that
[20:10] has given you your direction and i read
[20:13] a statement here recently
[20:15] by a philosopher democrities who said
[20:18] the cause of sinning is ignorance of
[20:20] what is better
[20:21] the reason why man sins is because he's
[20:23] ignorant
[20:24] of what is best the reason that man
[20:27] stands is because he forgets is not
[20:29] knowledgeable
[20:30] or conscious of and not remembering what
[20:32] is better the cause of sin
[20:34] is ignorance or failure to remember or
[20:36] to recall what is best and it says here
[20:38] that martha had chosen the one thing
[20:40] that was necessary
[20:41] or the better part the good part the one
[20:45] thing necessary
[20:46] and so we sin we fall short of the word
[20:48] of god when we forget
[20:50] what is necessary we fall short of the
[20:52] word of god when we forget the one thing
[20:54] that is needful or the better part
[20:56] and so considering our complicated world
[20:59] and our complicated hearts
[21:00] it's very important that we know the
[21:02] word of god that we know the will of god
[21:04] or that we know and hold to the good
[21:07] part
[21:08] that we know and hold good hold fast to
[21:10] the one thing
[21:11] that is necessary now that has just been
[21:14] some things just to kind of catch us up
[21:15] to where we were
[21:16] sunday morning and i'd realize now i
[21:19] took a great portion of this evening
[21:20] service to do that
[21:22] but we stopped at luke chapter 8 verse
[21:24] 14
[21:25] and we wanted to use this as an example
[21:27] sunday morning
[21:28] and we ran out of time so we're just
[21:30] going to pick up here
[21:32] and jesus is giving the parable of the
[21:34] sower we know the sower is
[21:35] the word in this particular instance the
[21:38] word is sown
[21:39] and the word being sown finds place in
[21:41] different types of ground
[21:43] the word seed when it gets in good
[21:45] ground it grows to perfection
[21:47] the other places of the uh the the
[21:51] by the wayside and the stony ground
[21:52] those represent certain complications
[21:56] certain dispositions of the heart
[21:58] certain circumstances
[21:59] that did not allow the seed to come
[22:01] forth but when it comes to the ground
[22:03] which had
[22:04] with thorns in it it's important to note
[22:07] that it wasn't so much about what was in
[22:09] what the ground
[22:10] the type of ground but what else was in
[22:12] the ground
[22:14] so it i want you to view it it's
[22:15] otherwise good ground but yet something
[22:18] else is in that ground that competes
[22:19] with the good word
[22:21] and so it says that which fell among
[22:22] thorns which we know is the word is the
[22:24] seed the seed which fell among thorns
[22:26] are they when they which when they have
[22:28] heard go forth
[22:30] and are choked with cares and riches and
[22:32] pleasures in this life
[22:33] and bring no fruit to perfection so
[22:36] there's nothing wrong with the seed
[22:38] there's really nothing wrong with the
[22:40] ground
[22:40] there's just the presence of other
[22:42] things in the ground where the seed is
[22:44] growing
[22:44] the word is growing that competes with
[22:47] the nutrients the life
[22:48] the light and the water for that seed to
[22:51] come to its perfection
[22:53] and so jesus just paints a beautiful
[22:55] picture of our own lives
[22:56] by bringing this image before us of seed
[22:59] being sewn into the ground
[23:00] but there being other seeds that are
[23:02] already present in it
[23:03] that compete against the word and make
[23:06] the word ineffective
[23:08] because i'd like you to think of this
[23:09] way there's nothing wrong with your
[23:10] ground
[23:11] in itself because it's ordained of god
[23:13] and there's nothing wrong with the word
[23:15] so if you don't see fruit don't question
[23:17] the word don't question
[23:19] your own heart or your own calling or
[23:20] your own election you can begin to look
[23:22] elsewhere and identify
[23:23] where are the thorns where are the
[23:25] foreign things in my garden that are
[23:27] competing with the word
[23:28] that are defiling my ground because if i
[23:30] can deal with those then i can deal with
[23:32] the things that are hindering the true
[23:33] expression of the word
[23:35] and so he lists these three three things
[23:38] i was looking at even today of this
[23:39] an unholy trinity of the cares
[23:43] and riches and pleasures of this life
[23:46] the cares and riches
[23:47] and pleasures of this life i believe
[23:49] it's in mark or matthew where it's
[23:51] referred to as
[23:51] the the deceitfulness of riches
[23:54] so it's not just riches but the
[23:56] deceitfulness of it
[23:58] and the care speaks of anxiety and
[24:00] stress it even the word that you use
[24:01] means you're divided
[24:02] so you you feel that you're being
[24:04] stretched out you fee you're being
[24:05] pressed
[24:06] you need you should be doing this you
[24:07] should be doing that so the cares
[24:09] is like a division of all your energy
[24:11] and all your efforts in all your mind
[24:12] you just feel
[24:13] you feel pressed and riches it speaks of
[24:16] an abundance of possessions
[24:18] and pleasures it's the the desire for
[24:20] more a lust for more
[24:22] so jesus is saying that good word is
[24:24] sowed into good ground
[24:25] but stress and anxiety abundance of
[24:28] possessions
[24:29] and the desire are lust for more compete
[24:32] against the word that's trying to grow
[24:34] in our hearts
[24:35] and cause it to bring no fruit to
[24:37] perfection
[24:39] and so full maturity of our christian
[24:41] character the full maturity of this word
[24:42] which we received into our hearts
[24:44] it's important to resolve these things
[24:47] that are in our hearts and in our lives
[24:49] the cares the riches and the pleasures
[24:50] of this life
[24:51] that inhibit the growth of the true
[24:53] nature and character of christ
[24:56] and this is so for every single one of
[24:58] us that that uh that receives the word
[25:00] of god these things are fighting against
[25:02] us
[25:02] and they may have different
[25:03] manifestations in other people's lives
[25:06] you know some people may be very rich
[25:07] and a lot of us don't have that
[25:08] privilege
[25:10] or curse however you want to look at it
[25:12] somebody told me the story one time are
[25:13] we
[25:14] familiar with the story that brother
[25:15] branham said that he was offered a
[25:16] million dollars and he said no and
[25:18] turned it down and this brother was
[25:19] saying i couldn't handle the temptation
[25:21] and i thought well i might want the
[25:23] chance you know i don't know i mean just
[25:25] just let's just see how i do and if it's
[25:27] not going good take it take a hurry
[25:29] but that's that's just our carnal
[25:31] thinking but yet so different things
[25:33] could
[25:33] reflect differently in different
[25:35] people's hearts so this anxiety and
[25:36] stress this
[25:37] being divided and even these abundance
[25:40] of possessions and the desire for more
[25:42] now notice let's look now at what
[25:44] brother branham wrote in the church age
[25:45] book
[25:47] and i'll just i'll just make a public
[25:49] apology i'm just still maybe not quite
[25:51] used to our new surroundings so if i
[25:53] seem nervous
[25:54] or fidgety or i'm just not quite hitting
[25:56] the mark in my delivery pray for me i'm
[25:58] still getting used
[25:59] to our new surroundings i'm kind of like
[26:01] maybe a dog in a new house
[26:03] just not right not sure where to go and
[26:05] i'm still sniffing everything
[26:07] right eliza kind of little nervous like
[26:08] a dog in a house
[26:10] new house a new home trying to get used
[26:12] to it so i'm sorry
[26:13] if i'm making you uncomfortable with my
[26:14] nerves uh
[26:16] but we've we looked at this statement
[26:19] last week
[26:20] and maybe even the week before each age
[26:22] had its pressure
[26:23] pressures for example a great burden of
[26:25] the last age is
[26:26] the pressure of riches soft living and
[26:30] nervous tensions in a complex age that
[26:32] we seem
[26:33] unfitted to live in i remember this is a
[26:36] toxic combination for deceitful hearts
[26:38] this is something that for our own
[26:40] hearts as they're made and deceitful
[26:42] above all things and
[26:43] desperately wicked and can mislead us
[26:46] here we have a very toxic combination
[26:48] that we live in a world with the heart
[26:49] that's easily
[26:50] impressionable a heart that longs a
[26:52] heart that remembers a heart that can be
[26:54] deceiving and lead us in the wrong path
[26:56] and it is desperately wicked it's sick
[26:57] it's longing it desires to have things
[27:00] in this age this burden that we carry in
[27:02] this age then
[27:03] is pressure of riches soft living and
[27:05] nervous tensions
[27:07] and i see them as leading one to another
[27:10] you have the pressures of riches the
[27:12] things you want to acquire and
[27:13] accumulate
[27:13] and as we accumulate them it increases
[27:15] our soft living
[27:17] we rely more upon them and maybe just to
[27:20] use harmless example
[27:21] a harmless example just so that we can
[27:23] begin to think about how easily we're
[27:25] impacted by this
[27:26] but just think of how you would live
[27:28] without air conditioning in the valley
[27:31] and really there's some people that
[27:32] would testify i think brother paul
[27:34] lovell could give us a lesson or two
[27:35] about how when they first moved here to
[27:37] the valley there was no air conditioning
[27:38] and they lived just out in the desert
[27:40] and they didn't they didn't have those
[27:41] things and we're thinking
[27:42] how could you do it well the reason why
[27:44] it's so hard on us let's just admit it
[27:46] it's probably soft living
[27:48] right we've gotten used to it our money
[27:50] can buy it it's something that
[27:51] has acclimated us to a different climate
[27:53] even when it's really really hot out
[27:55] and so the pressure of riches the more
[27:57] things we acquire the softer we're
[27:59] living
[27:59] and then that creates the nervous
[28:01] tensions because you're always worried
[28:03] about
[28:03] whether you're going to miss out on
[28:04] something else whether or not you have
[28:06] enough or
[28:07] am i living as soft as i can could i
[28:10] live
[28:10] softer is there a way to make my life a
[28:12] little bit easier
[28:14] and we may have never asked ourselves
[28:16] the question when we pondered whether or
[28:17] not we should upgrade to the new the new
[28:19] cell phone
[28:19] but in some ways we're a little bit
[28:21] worried about whether or not our life is
[28:22] getting harder
[28:23] because of the device we're carrying in
[28:25] our hands and we could make it a little
[28:26] bit easier if we just upgraded
[28:29] right if i just had a little bit bigger
[28:31] house if i just had a little bit more of
[28:33] that
[28:33] and so these things kind of connect to
[28:35] one another and then they have this
[28:37] perfect parallel
[28:38] to what jesus says that the the word of
[28:40] god is being choked out by cares
[28:43] nervous tensions the riches the pressure
[28:46] riches and
[28:47] soft living the pleasures of this life
[28:49] these things have a perfect parallel one
[28:51] with another
[28:52] even to the pride of life the lust of
[28:54] the eyes and the lust of the flesh
[28:56] the temptations in the garden the
[28:57] temptation to jesus this unholy trinity
[29:00] which all that is in the world is the
[29:01] lust of the eyes the lust of the flesh
[29:03] and the pride of life jesus says the
[29:05] cares and riches and the pleasures of
[29:07] this life
[29:08] are all things that fight against the
[29:10] word and the perfection of it
[29:12] i would even say it this way the perfect
[29:14] manifestation of it because i wouldn't
[29:16] question
[29:16] i wouldn't want to question your
[29:17] experience your faith and the seed of
[29:19] god that's inside of you
[29:20] and the word that you're feeding on it's
[29:22] going to come to perfection
[29:24] but we can we can kind of shake
[29:26] ourselves and waken ourselves to realize
[29:28] if we're not seeing it it's because
[29:29] things are intervening
[29:31] things are pressuring it things are
[29:32] complicated things are getting in the
[29:34] way of that perfect expression of the
[29:35] word
[29:37] we saw that even mankind because of
[29:39] their endless questions
[29:41] ecclesiastes 7 29 i believe it was
[29:43] they're endless questions
[29:45] endless meddling of questions and
[29:47] figuring things out jesus saying cares
[29:49] riches and pleasures of this life the
[29:51] the the
[29:52] pressures of riches the soft living
[29:54] leads to nervous tensions why because
[29:56] it's
[29:56] a desire for more we need to have we
[29:58] need to stay abreast we need to keep up
[30:00] we need to be in the know
[30:01] it causes these endless questions and i
[30:04] mentioned it a few times on sunday and i
[30:06] really wanted to amplify it in a greater
[30:08] detail and i feel that i'm just going to
[30:09] mention it
[30:10] and kind of hit the top of it and skip
[30:11] on but the power of the fear of regret
[30:14] is overwhelming this is a tremendous
[30:18] power it's called the fear of missing
[30:20] out it's also called the fear of a
[30:21] better option so fomo or fobo
[30:24] or the fear of regret those are the
[30:26] different ways that it's referred to
[30:28] and it's so powerful that it overwhelms
[30:30] us
[30:31] and in many ways the very thing that
[30:33] struck the heart of the woman it was an
[30:34] emotion she had never experienced before
[30:36] but satan caused the fear of missing out
[30:40] the fear of a better option the fear of
[30:42] something better something
[30:43] on the other side that god had hidden
[30:45] her from that he didn't want her to know
[30:47] and caused this wrestling in her heart
[30:49] and that was all he had to do
[30:50] to get her to act because she was afraid
[30:53] she'd be missing out
[30:54] and this phenomena is pervasive across
[30:57] many people's lives especially as we
[30:58] become more connected
[30:59] through social media is you have this
[31:01] perpetual endless fear of missing out
[31:04] because somebody else is doing this and
[31:05] somebody else is doing that and you're
[31:07] no longer oblivious to it they're
[31:08] telling you about it you're hearing
[31:10] about it you're connected to it
[31:11] and you see so much of the world and you
[31:13] hear so much about what's being
[31:14] discussed you hear so much about what's
[31:16] being
[31:16] offered and what's available and you
[31:18] become gripped with this fear am i
[31:20] missing out socially
[31:22] am i missing out on friendship and we
[31:24] can be afraid
[31:25] to do what we know the word of god says
[31:28] we should do but we don't act because
[31:30] we're afraid of what we'll lose when we
[31:31] do it
[31:33] it's the fear of loss and that's a very
[31:36] very powerful force
[31:37] that's connected with this fear of
[31:38] regret i don't want to risk it
[31:40] losing what i have so i'll just stick
[31:42] with what i've got
[31:44] even in that parable of the talents that
[31:45] one that was given the one
[31:47] he said well i knew you were an austere
[31:49] man i knew that you would be
[31:50] you would really get me if i lost it so
[31:52] i just put it to the money chain or i
[31:54] just
[31:55] buried it and made sure that i had the
[31:57] one you gave me when i gave it back what
[31:59] did he do he was afraid of losing
[32:01] something
[32:01] so he wouldn't even do what he knew what
[32:04] he knew
[32:05] his master would have wanted him to do
[32:07] he said you should have just given it to
[32:09] the money changers and i could have got
[32:10] interest on it
[32:11] and so this fear of missing out this
[32:13] fear of losing friends this fear of
[32:14] losing fellowship this fear of losing
[32:16] money this
[32:17] fear of losing an opportunity and the
[32:18] fear of not getting the promotion oh
[32:20] i could just keep going on and on and on
[32:22] until i get everybody to say amen so
[32:23] here's your chance everybody
[32:25] in unity amen all right you want me to
[32:27] move on i get it
[32:28] but the fear of whatever it might be
[32:30] will keep you from moving keep you from
[32:32] acting
[32:33] because you're afraid of what you'll
[32:34] lose it's exactly what caused the woman
[32:37] to act
[32:38] in disobedience to the word of god is
[32:40] that fear of missing out so it can
[32:42] paralyze you to obey god's word or it
[32:44] can motivate you to disobey god's word
[32:47] such a powerful powerful force
[32:51] and as it worked with the woman in the
[32:54] garden
[32:56] as jesus is mentioning as even martha
[32:58] wrestled with it
[33:00] this confusion or this lack of knowledge
[33:03] of what is best
[33:04] this confusion on what is best this
[33:06] confusion on what is good this lack of
[33:08] knowledge of what is better
[33:09] or more needful or more necessary for
[33:11] happiness is where we fail
[33:14] jesus is touching on it in luke chapter
[33:17] 8 it's touched on in luke chapter 10
[33:19] even i would say that's what this
[33:20] philosopher said the reason why man sins
[33:23] as because he doesn't know what is best
[33:26] so i said god help us to recognize how
[33:28] these this unholy trinity
[33:31] is pressing on us choking on us and
[33:33] confusing us
[33:34] i know it's very very simple but yet
[33:36] once you begin to look at it it becomes
[33:38] very very practical
[33:40] and if we believe that we have been
[33:41] given a word that's going going to lead
[33:43] us to
[33:43] triumph and overcoming and victory
[33:47] and and matured sons and daughters of
[33:49] god to fulfill the promises of this age
[33:51] then it's very practical to look at the
[33:53] things that keep this word
[33:54] from expressing itself it should give us
[33:58] a lot of grace for people that we know
[33:59] that profess to believe truth
[34:01] who don't always act appropriately and
[34:03] we could just have grace saying there
[34:04] just must be a lot of weeds
[34:05] weeds not weed a lot of weeds in their
[34:07] life
[34:09] that just must be what it is there just
[34:11] must be some things that are choking it
[34:12] out
[34:13] they can't be christ-like they can't get
[34:15] out of their own way they can't show the
[34:16] love of god
[34:17] they can't do the things they're right
[34:18] they can't humble themselves just have a
[34:20] grace to say you know what
[34:21] just with a little bit more gardening
[34:22] just a little bit more weeding a little
[34:23] bit more work
[34:24] may god just have his way in that
[34:26] person's life until we can start seeing
[34:28] that
[34:28] sensitivity of christ the humility of
[34:30] christ the love for the word
[34:32] and that maturing that we long for
[34:33] ourselves and we have the grace for
[34:35] others to meet the same mark
[34:41] and so this as it's mentioned in the in
[34:43] the one place in the bible
[34:46] of the deceitfulness of riches choke the
[34:48] word of god so that it brings no fruit
[34:50] to perfection
[34:51] cares riches and pleasures of this life
[34:54] notice how it's dealt with in
[34:56] revelations chapter 3 verse 17
[34:59] because the deceitfulness of riches and
[35:01] these cares and pleasures
[35:04] it's the it's they have an emptiness
[35:08] that will never fulfill their promise
[35:11] that's why it's the deceitfulness of
[35:12] riches that's why solomon said i had it
[35:14] all and it didn't work
[35:15] and i had my wisdom and it still didn't
[35:17] work just as it happened to the full it
[35:18] happened to me
[35:19] so riches are deceitful because we may
[35:22] even right now be thinking
[35:24] that the promise of this benefit of
[35:26] three thousand dollars per person
[35:28] once a year or another stimulus check or
[35:30] or a raise
[35:31] we could be telling ourselves if i could
[35:33] only get that things will be better
[35:36] and i will walk with you at least in
[35:38] that to some degree yes
[35:39] that may help and that may be may make
[35:42] things better
[35:43] but it won't be the best or what you
[35:45] need unless you recognize
[35:47] and are founded upon the one thing that
[35:48] is needful
[35:50] unless you have chosen the one thing
[35:52] that is necessary and if you have chosen
[35:53] the one thing that is necessary
[35:55] then god could take a small seed of a
[35:57] stimulus check he could take a small
[35:59] seed of a promotion
[36:00] he could take a small seed of your own
[36:02] discipline to honor the word of god and
[36:04] make a difficult decision in your home
[36:07] and remove things from your life that
[36:08] you know are toxic you can honor that
[36:10] decision if you've received the one
[36:12] thing that is necessary
[36:14] to bring blessings to you and multiply a
[36:16] fruit in your life and really
[36:18] really lead you and guide you and you
[36:19] can experience a joy from that but if
[36:21] you don't have the one thing that is
[36:23] necessary
[36:23] those things can either be wasted or
[36:25] become curses to you
[36:28] and so these these deceitfulness of
[36:30] riches and this this emptiness of
[36:32] pleasure they never fulfill the promise
[36:35] and and i love to think of it this way
[36:37] they never will truly ever satisfy a
[36:39] child of god
[36:41] and that's why sometimes david would
[36:43] even ponder and those that
[36:44] that wrote the psalms they would always
[36:46] think you know what it's just
[36:48] it's just really remarkable how that
[36:51] this works for others but it doesn't
[36:52] work for me
[36:54] how can they glory and how can they have
[36:55] this and how could they have that
[36:57] it's it's god god has orchestrated it as
[37:01] such
[37:01] ultimately your satisfaction is going to
[37:03] come through him and him alone
[37:05] because he wants it that way and you say
[37:07] well that doesn't that doesn't seem
[37:08] right that doesn't seem fair well
[37:10] whatever god says is truth and whatever
[37:13] god does is just so if he wants to have
[37:15] you he's going to have you and that's
[37:16] fair
[37:17] we just agree to that and so that's if
[37:18] that's what god wants it's fair
[37:20] and it doesn't operate by our rules of
[37:23] of engagement and our rules of warfare
[37:25] and our world rules of economy it's
[37:27] whatever god wants
[37:28] so he's he's put you in a particular
[37:30] he's made you in such a way to what the
[37:32] world can get away with you may not be
[37:34] able to get away with it
[37:38] even a young brother in our church here
[37:40] had a situation where he bought
[37:42] he bought a um he bought a cell phone um
[37:46] from on offer up or something like that
[37:47] and they were he was told it was a
[37:49] it wasn't stolen it would work the
[37:50] number wasn't black listed he got it it
[37:52] worked for a little bit and then
[37:53] certain thing it stopped working and
[37:55] then he
[37:56] they found out that it was blacklisted
[37:58] and so this phone is no longer going to
[38:00] work
[38:01] and someone said well just how did you
[38:03] get the phone i bought it on offer up
[38:04] well
[38:05] then just sell it again on offer up
[38:08] if that's what happened to you just do
[38:09] it again and he was convicted in his
[38:11] heart he's like well no i don't want to
[38:13] i don't want to be dishonest i at least
[38:15] know for sure now that this isn't going
[38:17] to work maybe the first
[38:18] guy didn't really know i'll give him the
[38:19] benefit of doubt but i can't be clear in
[38:21] my heart
[38:22] to turn around and perpetuate fraud on
[38:24] somebody else
[38:25] and that's the that's the kind of uh uh
[38:28] things that a child of god learns that
[38:31] they that they're to do
[38:32] and the ways to honor god and you know
[38:33] what somebody in the world can do it and
[38:34] get away with it but i tell you a son of
[38:36] god do that it'll haunt them
[38:38] it'll chase after him you you can't you
[38:41] can't skim and get by and cheat and try
[38:43] to do
[38:43] do work i we're even experiencing this
[38:45] with respect to home schools things as
[38:47] simple as homeschool
[38:48] you think you can get away with skating
[38:50] by and not doing your work as a son of
[38:52] god it
[38:53] will daughter god it will haunt you
[38:56] you wonder why things are so chaotic
[38:59] because you know deep down inside the
[39:00] dishonesty
[39:01] the lack of integrity the truthfulness
[39:03] haunts a child of god
[39:06] it's almost as if the world doesn't have
[39:07] that ear
[39:10] they become more callous they become
[39:12] more crude they become more dishonest
[39:13] because they don't have that
[39:15] consciousness
[39:16] of conviction so it says here because
[39:18] thou sayest i am rich and increased with
[39:20] goods
[39:21] and have need of nothing and know us not
[39:23] that thou are wretched and miserable and
[39:25] poor and blind and naked
[39:27] this is how humanity this age the
[39:29] laodicean age
[39:31] boast of itself we see ourselves i want
[39:34] you to take this phrase
[39:35] i am rich and increased with goods and
[39:37] have need of nothing this is the boast
[39:39] of the laodicean age
[39:40] this is the boast of all humanity in the
[39:42] world we're living in now
[39:43] all governments all politicians all
[39:45] economics all societies
[39:47] this is the spirit upon the entire age i
[39:49] don't care if you want to find me a
[39:50] civilization
[39:52] uh living out in the middle of nowhere
[39:53] the spirit pervades
[39:55] they are materially wealthy and they are
[39:57] ethical they're more ethical
[39:59] they're more they're more equipped and
[40:02] better able to make decisions
[40:04] we are rich increased with goods and
[40:06] have need of nothing
[40:09] rich brother branham talks about how
[40:11] this is wealthy in the things of this
[40:12] world
[40:14] that's what he characterizes it as when
[40:15] he examines this phrase they're wealthy
[40:17] in the things of this world
[40:18] i am rich i'm wealthy in the things of
[40:20] this world i'm abounding in material
[40:22] uh resources and possessions i have a
[40:24] lot
[40:26] i have a lot that characterizes this age
[40:30] increased with goods now brother banner
[40:31] takes this and looks at it
[40:33] in a little bit different light and the
[40:34] words that are used in the greek would
[40:36] even suggest
[40:37] uh this meaning that the world is
[40:39] looking at their spiritual riches
[40:41] now not with the capital s like the
[40:43] godly riches and godly wisdom but the
[40:45] spiritual riches
[40:46] riches that relate to religion and and
[40:48] formal worship and even
[40:50] a better morality they have spiritual
[40:52] riches that as men
[40:53] we've obtained to a better morality we
[40:55] are more ethical
[40:57] we look back on ages past and look how
[40:59] they treated this person and look at how
[41:01] society
[41:02] perpetuated genocides and look how
[41:04] minorities were treated
[41:06] and they look at the evils that man have
[41:07] perpetuated on other men throughout
[41:09] generations and thousands and thousands
[41:11] of years
[41:11] and now they assume themselves to be
[41:14] more ethical
[41:15] and and have higher spiritual
[41:17] attainments to where now they can
[41:18] rightly divide between what is just and
[41:20] what is unjust
[41:21] and we can defend the poor and we can
[41:23] defend the minorities and we can defend
[41:24] those
[41:25] uh and look don't look at differences
[41:27] and so they're feeling that they're more
[41:29] superior ethically
[41:31] they have a higher sense of justice this
[41:33] is the age that we're living in
[41:34] they have a better morality higher
[41:36] spiritual attainment now this is so
[41:38] within the christian dome and they feel
[41:39] that they have more spiritual services
[41:41] they have better wisdom and better word
[41:43] and uh and i i don't mean to make
[41:46] brother joel kind of a focus
[41:48] focus of the sermon tonight but he sent
[41:50] me brother joel rose sent me a
[41:52] a picture this past week of how i don't
[41:55] know where it came from but it was a
[41:56] particular church that said what the
[41:58] bible is not and they had an
[42:00] x next to it's not the word of god and
[42:03] an
[42:03] x next to it's not infallible and x next
[42:06] to these different things that you would
[42:07] say well
[42:08] okay that's interesting that's exactly
[42:09] what the bible says it is
[42:11] so and then they and then they begin to
[42:13] describe it in such a way to her now it
[42:15] became more of a
[42:16] guide something that was more of a
[42:18] community text and we all kind of
[42:19] participate in it because it's
[42:21] instructive to whoever we are regardless
[42:23] of our belief system and
[42:24] how we really want to live and what
[42:25] challenges we face so it's just kind of
[42:27] a community text that we
[42:28] we can use to help navigate this world
[42:31] and this is how the world even in
[42:33] christian gym and nominal christianity
[42:34] feels that they're even more spiritual
[42:36] now because they've let go of certain
[42:38] things in the word of god they let go of
[42:40] certain
[42:40] controversial things and they've
[42:42] attained to something that's more
[42:43] harmonious
[42:44] or homogenous that we can all kind of
[42:46] fellowship in and we can have services
[42:48] where you just come as you are stay as
[42:50] you are live how you are believe what
[42:51] you are
[42:52] we're just kind of getting together to
[42:53] hang out for 45 minutes
[42:55] hope you like the music right and that's
[42:58] all it's become
[43:00] and he says i have need of nothing so
[43:02] here's i'm rich increased with goods and
[43:04] have need of nothing it means i have
[43:05] everything
[43:06] or i don't want any more that's what it
[43:10] means i have everything i don't want
[43:11] anymore
[43:12] now what's remarkable about this these i
[43:14] am rich increased with goods and i have
[43:16] everything or i don't want any more
[43:17] they're deceived in this proclamation
[43:19] that i don't want anymore
[43:21] because the bible says you don't know
[43:23] that you're wretched miserable
[43:24] poor blind and naked they think they're
[43:28] rich increase with goods and have need
[43:29] of nothing but they don't know that in
[43:30] fact they're naked
[43:32] blind poor wretched and miserable they
[43:34] don't have that knowledge
[43:35] of even the better part that they would
[43:37] be clothed and that they would be able
[43:38] to see
[43:39] so they're deceived when they say that
[43:41] either i have everything i've had enough
[43:43] or i don't want any more
[43:44] because their actions don't fit their
[43:46] confession
[43:49] they're constantly being driven for more
[43:53] constantly desirous of more constantly
[43:55] trying to pursue things
[43:56] to have more pursuit to have more
[43:57] pursuit to have more and solomon had
[43:59] every material possession or comfort
[44:01] that man could desire
[44:02] but still he felt empty
[44:06] and the bible says no it's not you're
[44:07] not fully aware that you're driven by
[44:09] emptiness you're driven by nakedness
[44:11] you're driven by what you lack you have
[44:12] an insatiable greed for more
[44:14] don't you know that you're poor
[44:16] miserable blind and naked and it's
[44:18] actually those things that motivate
[44:20] their action
[44:22] that's why a man who could have so much
[44:24] have so much abundance
[44:26] but still prey on the vulnerable to get
[44:28] more
[44:29] because no matter what how much he has
[44:31] in his possession
[44:32] he still desires to take away from the
[44:34] other what motivates him
[44:36] the reality that he's poor the reality
[44:38] that he's miserable the
[44:39] reality that he's blind and naked not
[44:41] i'm rich i don't need anything else
[44:43] be it they act contrary to that
[44:45] confession because they they're full
[44:47] of greed full of a desire a lust for
[44:50] more
[44:52] if this was true we'd kind of just stay
[44:53] right where we were at the beginning of
[44:54] the
[44:55] 20th century and we wouldn't have gone
[44:56] as far as we have because man would have
[44:58] been satisfied i'm rich i'm increased
[45:00] with goods i have needed nothing we just
[45:01] kind of would have been been holding
[45:03] where we were in the roaring twenties
[45:05] right we'd have to be experiencing yet
[45:08] another roaring twenties
[45:11] but the first part had not supplied the
[45:14] second part
[45:16] the first part i'm rich increased with
[45:17] goods and have need of nothing has not
[45:19] placated the second part
[45:21] the nakedness the miz the misery the
[45:24] poorness
[45:25] and it cannot the first part cannot
[45:27] bring fulfillment it cannot bring
[45:28] happiness
[45:30] so brother brenda makes this conclusion
[45:33] as he's examined revelations chapter 3
[45:34] verse 17
[45:35] it cries that it has a great amplitude
[45:39] of all things
[45:40] but it keeps burning with desire like an
[45:43] unsatisfied fire
[45:46] is that not the age we live in it cries
[45:50] it boasts it brags that we have an
[45:51] amplitude of all things we have so much
[45:54] we have so much
[45:54] but yet it keeps burning with the desire
[45:56] like an unsatisfied fire
[45:59] why don't they just make a phone that
[46:01] never slows down that once you spend a
[46:03] thousand dollars for it
[46:05] as long as you don't break it it'll work
[46:07] that way forever
[46:09] why doesn't it work that way because the
[46:10] one making it wants to make more
[46:12] money so they actually build within the
[46:15] device itself a ticking clock
[46:18] that through regular updates eventually
[46:20] it'll be operating so slowly and can't
[46:22] work with new apps
[46:23] and can't even work on its own operating
[46:25] system that the company designed it for
[46:29] to where you need a new one and it
[46:30] creates this desire in you i'm missing
[46:32] out i gotta have more i gotta have the
[46:33] next one and you get sucked into the
[46:35] upgrade cycle
[46:37] why is it that mankind mankind can't be
[46:40] happy with the amplitude of all things
[46:42] because he's burning with an unsatisfied
[46:44] fire
[46:47] abraham maslow said man is a perpetually
[46:50] wanting animal
[46:53] man is a perpetually wanting animal
[46:57] that's what mankind is perpetually
[47:00] wanting
[47:05] all right i'm going to skip i'm going to
[47:06] skip more
[47:10] to try to uh
[47:14] to keep from being lengthy tonight i i i
[47:16] feel that there's such a
[47:17] just a wonderful uh wonderful atmosphere
[47:21] i enjoy the uh i enjoyed the pool and
[47:24] the expectation that you have when you
[47:25] come to church and as i've said before
[47:27] i'm still getting used to it
[47:28] to calibrate just how lengthy these
[47:30] things go these things what a way to
[47:32] refer to a
[47:32] church service but the preaching of the
[47:35] word
[47:36] and so i'm going to skip a little bit
[47:37] and i want i'm going to read this
[47:38] statement that brother brandon makes
[47:40] because he says how that
[47:42] this burning with an unsatisfied fire
[47:46] and so the things that i'm skipping let
[47:48] me just say this maybe just to kind of
[47:50] and don't pull me into it i don't want
[47:51] to get to it it's going to be too
[47:52] lengthy if i do
[47:54] but we're no longer living in what i
[47:57] would call the information age alone
[47:59] but now it's coming into the age of
[48:00] experience
[48:02] where information has sucked us into a
[48:05] mode where now we want to experience the
[48:07] things that we're being learning about
[48:09] the things that's being presented to us
[48:11] and so there's different statements that
[48:12] brother vanna makes and things that we
[48:14] could share with you
[48:15] to see that how satan's knowledge
[48:17] without the wisdom of the word
[48:19] is destructive it's deceiving and that
[48:22] it brings forth this
[48:23] even as it worked within the woman it
[48:25] created a lust of knowledge
[48:27] and then once she had this knowledge
[48:29] lust excited within her
[48:30] the knowledge was not enough it was a
[48:32] lust for experience
[48:35] and it brought her into a particular way
[48:36] of acting and so i want you to deeply
[48:39] ponder that and consider that that
[48:40] satan's motive
[48:41] is to create a lust for knowledge and
[48:43] gaining knowledge it creates a lust for
[48:45] the experience
[48:48] now if you can consider that very deeply
[48:49] for a moment and just think
[48:51] how could you ever crave something and
[48:54] want something
[48:56] if you never knew of its existence
[48:59] and he said well brother aaron i could
[49:00] still have a craving for something
[49:01] because the needs there and the desire
[49:03] is there
[49:03] i concede how could you ever fulfill it
[49:06] until you found the thing that could
[49:07] fulfill it
[49:09] and so satan has a means of making you
[49:12] aware of something
[49:13] and now becoming aware of it begin to
[49:15] work within your mind
[49:17] to try to bring it to a place that now
[49:18] that i know that it's there i want to
[49:20] just i desire to
[49:21] to enjoy it i desire to have it i desire
[49:24] to want it
[49:25] and that's that's the problem many times
[49:27] in just the casual conversations that we
[49:29] can have with people
[49:30] that if we're not careful you can
[49:32] glorify sin or glorify
[49:34] something even your own past you begin
[49:36] to talk about the effects of a
[49:37] particular drug
[49:38] and on somebody who's not born again
[49:40] they can start think does it really do
[49:42] that
[49:44] wow that is pretty trippy
[49:48] and by knowledge of it now
[49:51] the devil can begin to work upon them to
[49:53] experience it
[49:55] and if you begin to look at your life
[49:57] and the things that you wrestle with the
[49:58] things that you struggle with and even
[50:00] the
[50:00] the standard that you want to keep in
[50:02] your own home and the way that you want
[50:04] to
[50:04] measure your your relationship to your
[50:06] wife and to your children
[50:08] that satan's immo is to give you
[50:09] knowledge of it and then to want to give
[50:11] you the lust to experience it
[50:13] and i say let's just keep it clean
[50:16] let's keep it clean so that he's not
[50:18] giving us the knowledge therefore we're
[50:20] having to bite
[50:21] fight in the battleground of experience
[50:23] and trying to hold off on the experience
[50:25] and it's
[50:26] it's that that scenario of actually just
[50:28] putting the cake there in front of you
[50:29] and telling you
[50:30] don't eat it don't eat it don't eat it
[50:31] don't eat it how about just get rid of
[50:32] the cake
[50:35] wasn't that god's wisdom in the
[50:36] beginning in the exodus in exodus
[50:38] chapter 12
[50:39] he said you can't eat any leaven thing
[50:41] don't eat in 11.
[50:42] now all of us in our wisdom would just
[50:43] take the leaven and put it on a shelf or
[50:45] we would just have a big sign
[50:46] on the refrigerator and on the oven and
[50:48] on the fire everything says no leaven no
[50:50] lemon we would have it everywhere no
[50:52] leaven
[50:53] but as long as leaven was accessible
[50:57] as long as leaven was nearby and it was
[50:59] able to be used somebody could loathe
[51:02] the preparation of the bread and long
[51:04] for that leaven and as long as it was
[51:05] accessible the knowledge of it being
[51:07] accessible could
[51:08] then be one step closer to experiencing
[51:10] the leaven and god said if you
[51:12] experience the leaven you're cut off
[51:13] from israel
[51:14] the wisdom of god is just to get rid of
[51:16] the leaven
[51:17] get it out of the house altogether get
[51:19] it away from you so that no one
[51:21] innocently or otherwise tempted even has
[51:23] opportunity and access to make the
[51:25] mistake
[51:28] and so this lust creates this greed this
[51:30] insatiable desire
[51:32] this is exactly what happened in the
[51:34] beginning brother branham says in the
[51:35] easter seal
[51:36] and i believe i'm skipping at least
[51:39] three or four slides there to the easter
[51:40] seal
[51:41] he says every human being comes right
[51:44] back to the same place
[51:45] to make our choice but that greed that's
[51:49] always been
[51:50] and he says right and wrong this is so
[51:52] amazing
[51:53] wrong trying to overthrow the right
[52:03] he says it started in eden what did
[52:05] greed
[52:07] and the greed excuse me the greed of
[52:09] wrong
[52:11] trying to overthrow the right it started
[52:14] in eden
[52:16] and has come down through the ages it's
[52:19] come down till it's entered into
[52:20] national affairs
[52:22] it's come down into church affairs it's
[52:25] come down into home life
[52:28] those may be three different ways of
[52:29] trying to say it's everywhere
[52:33] everywhere what greed
[52:37] and the battle between wrong and right
[52:40] and the greed of wrong trying to
[52:42] overthrow that which is right
[52:43] it came down it started needing it's
[52:45] come to the ages it says greed think of
[52:47] the way he
[52:47] applies this greed trying to rule or
[52:50] ruin
[52:52] trying to overpower push out and we see
[52:54] the thing working
[52:56] everywhere and it always has the same
[52:58] thing
[52:59] trying to overrule or overrun
[53:02] what's doing it greed this desire as it
[53:06] said this
[53:06] uh the the cares and riches and
[53:08] pleasures of this life and
[53:10] and i'm rich and increased with goods
[53:11] and have need of nothing it's this greed
[53:13] it's this insatiable desire
[53:14] it's the desire to want to have more
[53:17] greed it means you're eager to obtain to
[53:19] have something
[53:20] what is it the world we live it's a
[53:22] money-loving world
[53:23] and and money's taken on a different
[53:25] meaning now
[53:26] because when we say money it's it's
[53:28] money is not just in the cash
[53:30] the scratch the moolah or whatever it
[53:32] was you want to call it it wasn't just
[53:34] in the green in the coin
[53:35] and the currency of the country you're
[53:37] living in now to be money loving can
[53:39] represent many different things that
[53:41] have purchased power
[53:43] it can be representative now to where
[53:44] you have cryptocurrency you have things
[53:47] that are
[53:47] not that are digital you have things
[53:49] that maybe be that are intangible
[53:51] become possessions and become assets and
[53:54] have a great vast wealth associated with
[53:56] it so we can be a money-loving world we
[53:58] can be a money-loving person we can be
[54:00] very greedy
[54:01] and the love of money being the very
[54:02] root of evil that's in our hearts and
[54:04] you realize now
[54:05] how the bible could make that conclusion
[54:08] that the love of money is the root of
[54:09] all evil and you go all the way back to
[54:11] the garden of eden
[54:12] and the woman didn't even have a purse
[54:14] right
[54:16] she didn't have a wallet to keep a
[54:17] credit card there wasn't even a there
[54:18] wasn't even a
[54:19] terminal to make a transaction but
[54:22] somehow
[54:23] the love of money encompasses something
[54:25] that was sown into mankind in the
[54:28] beginning
[54:29] something that was shocked into humanity
[54:31] something that humanity has been
[54:33] wrestling with
[54:33] something that humanity has been
[54:35] fighting ever since
[54:36] that comes down to the end and is
[54:38] exhibited in greed and commercialism
[54:40] and overzealous capitalism and all these
[54:43] things that just
[54:44] harbor uh or that bring a bondage and
[54:46] and
[54:48] harm to so many individuals it's now
[54:50] climaxed in the age that we're living in
[54:52] he says it's greed trying to rule in the
[54:54] ruin overpower
[54:55] and push out
[55:00] it's an inordinate desire this greed
[55:02] it's a craving it's a longing
[55:05] and when you read genesis chapter 3
[55:06] verse 6 i don't know if i put it up
[55:08] there
[55:09] genesis chapter 3 verse 6 and when the
[55:11] woman saw that the tree was good for
[55:13] food
[55:16] and that it was pleasant to the eyes
[55:23] that means it was pleasant
[55:27] it means lust covetousness
[55:30] in a bad sense when the woman now is
[55:34] greedy
[55:35] the woman now is loving to have
[55:38] something more
[55:39] to have something which she thinks is
[55:40] better to go beyond that curtain of
[55:42] what's being promised on the other side
[55:44] when the woman saw that it was good for
[55:46] food and that it was pleasant
[55:48] covetousness he awakened to lust in her
[55:51] what was it a lust for knowledge that
[55:52] was only going to be satisfied through
[55:54] the lust of experience
[55:56] that's that's the age we're living in
[55:58] now so how is it i'm wanting to present
[56:00] this to you
[56:01] and what's the point if that's how
[56:04] innocence was lost
[56:06] if that's how the end the beginning
[56:08] ended
[56:10] if that's what's brought in sickness and
[56:13] death and
[56:13] confusion and lies and murders then it's
[56:16] at its
[56:17] peak now that tactic
[56:20] that that hook within flesh this
[56:22] challenge that mankind faces
[56:24] and we've got to recognize then that god
[56:26] has given us the remedy for all that is
[56:28] complicated for all that is complex he's
[56:30] given us the remedy to be able to
[56:32] overcome everything that has reached
[56:33] this climax in this age
[56:35] and he actually spells it out to the
[56:36] laodiceans he says i counsel thee
[56:38] to buy of me gold tried in the fire that
[56:40] thou mayest be rich
[56:42] in white raiment that thou mayest be
[56:44] clothed and that the shame of
[56:46] thy nakedness do not appear and anoint
[56:48] thy eyes with eyes have
[56:50] that thou may see they i'm rich i'm
[56:53] increased with goods i have need of
[56:55] nothing but yeah you're really
[56:56] poor miserable blind and naked and so
[56:59] what is god's answer
[57:00] i counsel you here's my wisdom
[57:04] buy of me gold tried in the fire get
[57:06] your gold from me
[57:08] that you may be rich get your white
[57:10] raiment
[57:11] from me that you may be clothed in the
[57:14] shame of my nakedness do not appear
[57:15] and anoint your eyes with the i said
[57:17] that i can give that you may actually
[57:19] see
[57:21] there's there's the trinity the answer
[57:23] the three answers to the three
[57:24] other three his gold his reignment
[57:27] his wisdom this is the answer the
[57:31] council of the lord is the answer to the
[57:32] world's chaos the council to the world
[57:34] is the answer to the world's confusion
[57:36] he said brother aaron you're harping on
[57:37] it you're harping on it i understand
[57:38] that i get it
[57:40] i'm a harp eagle right now but i'm still
[57:42] an eagle
[57:44] and i'm i'm wanting to express this to
[57:45] you i really do believe with all my
[57:47] heart it is that simple
[57:49] and as you face your particular
[57:50] challenges as you have things arising in
[57:52] your life and you're facing situations
[57:54] and you don't know which way to go
[57:55] and you can conspire this and you can
[57:57] try to prepare for that
[57:58] and you try to figure out all the other
[58:00] ways you can bolster your your
[58:02] opportunity and take advantage of this
[58:03] and take advantage of that you've got to
[58:05] be resting in jesus christ
[58:08] you've got to come back to the simple
[58:09] truth that the word is right
[58:11] that you understand the time and the age
[58:13] that you're living in that there's been
[58:14] a promise given to you
[58:15] that's to lead you and guide you and see
[58:17] you through this complexity so you can
[58:18] get you on the other side of it and just
[58:20] rest
[58:22] and that's what god wanted to get you to
[58:24] and so it's just
[58:25] it may seem very empty and shallow just
[58:27] to say no it's the council of the lord
[58:28] it's the wisdom of god that's the answer
[58:30] to everything that's going on in the
[58:31] world today
[58:32] but when i say that it doesn't mean it's
[58:33] not without depth
[58:35] this word is very deep it's multifaceted
[58:38] there's height to it there's depth to it
[58:40] there's width to it
[58:40] there's breath to it there's so much to
[58:43] this word but therein lies your answer
[58:46] proverbs 19 21 there are many devices in
[58:48] a man's heart
[58:50] what is that inventions perceptions
[58:51] calculations thoughts instincts
[58:54] many devices many values many judgments
[58:58] many things that have been sown into
[58:59] mankind
[59:00] they've sought out many inventions
[59:01] meddled with many questions that's what
[59:03] caused a man to go to straight the
[59:04] complicated man the complicated heart
[59:06] has created a complicated world a
[59:08] non-innocent world but nevertheless the
[59:10] council of the lord
[59:11] that shall stand amen now what it what
[59:14] what is
[59:15] what is raised in the contrast by using
[59:17] this language
[59:18] the devices in our hearts lead to
[59:20] failure
[59:23] relying upon the devices in our hearts
[59:25] lead to things that crumble underneath
[59:26] us that don't last that don't give us
[59:28] the joy
[59:29] and the contentment that we think they
[59:30] will but the council lord it says that
[59:32] shall stand
[59:34] he's wanting to bring this competition
[59:35] between something that stands versus
[59:37] something that strays or fails
[59:38] the council lord stands it'll uphold you
[59:41] it'll work
[59:42] but the deceitfulness of our heart and
[59:44] the in the devices
[59:46] in our hearts it leads us to stand in
[59:47] places that ultimately cause us to
[59:49] wander or they ultimately fall out from
[59:51] underneath us and that's what leads to
[59:52] failure
[59:55] and the anxieties that we face the
[59:57] things that we go through the stress
[59:58] that we feel the depression we fight
[1:00:00] with
[1:00:00] the dissatisfaction our longing for more
[1:00:03] comfort the longing for more
[1:00:04] communication
[1:00:05] the longing to have certain things and
[1:00:07] begin to find it in the world as the
[1:00:08] product of the accumulation
[1:00:10] of complications things just building
[1:00:14] the stress the confusion we face it's
[1:00:16] the accumulation of complications
[1:00:18] that we have been that have been brought
[1:00:21] by knowledge
[1:00:22] and by experience and we will
[1:00:25] only we will only find rest
[1:00:29] in the word it's the only place you'll
[1:00:32] find it
[1:00:34] you'll only be able to make sense of the
[1:00:35] world to the wisdom of the world
[1:00:37] i may i may be able to pick up on this
[1:00:39] on sunday i was wanting maybe to contin
[1:00:41] discontinue uh this particular naming
[1:00:44] convention of now it's complicated
[1:00:46] and i really would like to get into
[1:00:48] things that are very practical on how we
[1:00:49] can simplify our lives from a word
[1:00:51] perspective
[1:00:52] taking the revealed word of the hour and
[1:00:54] simplifying our lives
[1:00:56] what for brother aaron so we can get out
[1:00:57] of here
[1:01:00] so that we don't need gatherings like
[1:01:02] this anymore and are you still looking
[1:01:04] for a building yeah i'm looking for a
[1:01:05] body
[1:01:07] it's called a new one and that if we can
[1:01:10] focus on that objective who knows maybe
[1:01:11] we don't need a new building
[1:01:13] because the new body gets here first and
[1:01:15] so we want to i want to
[1:01:17] by god's grace perhaps share things that
[1:01:19] are very practical that we can apply in
[1:01:20] our daily lives
[1:01:22] that will enable the word of god to have
[1:01:24] preeminence
[1:01:25] so that we can see the word being
[1:01:27] effective in our lives
[1:01:28] and i may be able to bring some of these
[1:01:30] other things into it
[1:01:32] and share some of these other things but
[1:01:34] i wanted to use just some examples of
[1:01:35] the word and some examples how that
[1:01:38] a lot of information without proper
[1:01:41] wisdom or analytics is useless
[1:01:45] or leads to a greater problem than if
[1:01:46] you didn't have any information
[1:01:49] and so you could have a lot of data but
[1:01:51] without the ability to properly
[1:01:53] analyze it and get value out of it and
[1:01:55] benefit from it the data can either be
[1:01:57] nothing
[1:01:58] or very very damaging and more people
[1:02:01] have gotten into bigger trouble because
[1:02:02] they gained a little bit of knowledge
[1:02:05] than even if they had just been ignorant
[1:02:08] and the information age and the google
[1:02:10] age that we live in sometimes just gives
[1:02:11] us just enough information to be
[1:02:13] dangerous
[1:02:14] and that's why we can say i can handle
[1:02:16] this i stayed at a holiday inn express
[1:02:18] last night
[1:02:19] right we've gained just a little bit of
[1:02:20] an advantage by googling and we feel
[1:02:22] that we're up to the task and i can
[1:02:24] figure this out and i know what to do
[1:02:25] when we've abandoned our faith in god
[1:02:29] we've entered into areas that we ought
[1:02:30] not to venture into but it's only
[1:02:32] through the word of god to the wisdom of
[1:02:34] god that we can make sense of this world
[1:02:41] let me if you could turn to deuteronomy
[1:02:43] chapter 30
[1:02:45] i'm going to try to find a way just to
[1:02:46] bounce through this real quick to close
[1:02:57] think of it this way the woman in the
[1:02:58] beginning
[1:03:02] we're using the phrase was offered
[1:03:03] complication through knowledge
[1:03:07] and through the question and the lie
[1:03:09] she's actually brought to the door of
[1:03:11] death
[1:03:13] and she's enticed to enter
[1:03:16] and i really i admit i'm using my
[1:03:18] language that fits within the
[1:03:20] the construct of the sermons that i've
[1:03:21] been preaching so it fits very nicely
[1:03:23] kind of settles in real well with what
[1:03:24] i've been saying over the last three
[1:03:26] services
[1:03:26] but i have the luxury of doing that
[1:03:28] because i'm the one preaching the fourth
[1:03:29] one
[1:03:30] but i do want you to ponder that though
[1:03:32] that in that in that way to think of how
[1:03:35] that satan through a
[1:03:36] question and a lie brought the woman to
[1:03:39] the door of death
[1:03:40] and enticed her to step into that death
[1:03:44] that's what happened in the end of the
[1:03:45] beginning now in the end
[1:03:48] now in the end what is going to take
[1:03:50] place in the end
[1:03:52] what's being offered to us in the end
[1:03:54] through simplicity
[1:03:56] not complication but simplicity is being
[1:03:59] offered to us through revelation
[1:04:01] a word of god is being offered to us so
[1:04:03] just as the woman through a question and
[1:04:05] a lie
[1:04:05] was brought to knowledge and then a lust
[1:04:07] for experience was brought to the door
[1:04:08] of death now in the end
[1:04:10] a very simple word through revelation
[1:04:12] the revealed word is bringing a woman to
[1:04:14] the door
[1:04:15] not of death but life and we're not
[1:04:18] we're not so much trying to be enticed
[1:04:20] to go in but we have a
[1:04:21] spirit of god that's driving us into
[1:04:24] that place
[1:04:26] and the contrast of the end of the
[1:04:27] beginning and now the ending
[1:04:29] of the church ages and the ending of
[1:04:31] time brings us to this great beautiful
[1:04:33] door that is set before us
[1:04:35] to where now we are we have entrance
[1:04:37] that's being ministered unto us
[1:04:38] and just as the woman stood at the door
[1:04:40] of death and was enticed to step in
[1:04:42] we have the privilege of being brought
[1:04:43] back to simplicity by the revealed word
[1:04:46] to be
[1:04:46] sent before the door of life with a
[1:04:49] desire to step into it
[1:04:51] and that life means something very
[1:04:53] different than what this life wants to
[1:04:54] tell you that it is
[1:04:55] because this entire world all of its
[1:04:57] commerce all of its societies all of its
[1:05:00] economies
[1:05:00] all of its politics all of its religions
[1:05:02] have become amazed
[1:05:04] all of it all of it has become amazing
[1:05:07] it's sad to say that even this message
[1:05:08] which i believe to be the absolute truth
[1:05:10] has become complicated and amazed who
[1:05:13] done it man done it
[1:05:16] and people look at it and i say i didn't
[1:05:18] it didn't do anything for me i just kept
[1:05:19] running into a dead end
[1:05:21] who put that dead in there man did who
[1:05:24] put him in that maze who put him in that
[1:05:25] collar who put him in that bondage
[1:05:27] man does that but this word of god it
[1:05:29] perfectly blends in harmony with the
[1:05:31] scripture of god
[1:05:32] and i feel this confidence say all
[1:05:34] commerce all economies all politics all
[1:05:36] religion
[1:05:36] all these denominations every idea every
[1:05:39] theology
[1:05:39] it's become a maze and if you sat here
[1:05:43] today and you purposed in your heart
[1:05:44] that the only way that i'm going to be
[1:05:46] able to achieve happiness
[1:05:47] is to somehow be able to figure things
[1:05:50] out through
[1:05:50] the philosophical idea of resolving
[1:05:52] complexes
[1:05:53] things that are complex and resolving
[1:05:55] things that are challenges and figuring
[1:05:57] everything out and
[1:05:58] i'm going to start from a blank slate i
[1:05:59] don't know anything that's right so i'm
[1:06:01] going to figure everything out and
[1:06:02] through that pursuit to finding truth
[1:06:04] and figuring everything out
[1:06:05] i will achieve nirvana and i'll be
[1:06:07] satisfied and where are you going to
[1:06:09] start
[1:06:11] think about all the things you have to
[1:06:12] figure out all the ways of life all the
[1:06:15] ways of living there's people tell you
[1:06:16] know where i found simplicity
[1:06:18] i found it on a mountaintop i love to i
[1:06:20] love to climb mountains and i'm just
[1:06:22] living on the side of a hill and
[1:06:23] and it's simply guarding and it's simply
[1:06:25] doing this and
[1:06:26] you're going to have to pursue all these
[1:06:28] things how could you ever do it
[1:06:30] what does that mindset even set before
[1:06:32] you how are you going to figure out
[1:06:33] everything in the world and find kind of
[1:06:35] begin to find the place where you belong
[1:06:38] i think we can just cut to the chase god
[1:06:40] is in control of this
[1:06:42] as it says in deuteronomy chapter 30
[1:06:46] i believe we we started with verse 6
[1:06:49] but i want to i only want to reference
[1:06:51] it to say this
[1:06:53] he says i'll circumcise your heart
[1:06:56] now immediately that should get our
[1:06:58] attentions he's going to circumcise my
[1:07:00] heart
[1:07:01] that means he's going to change this
[1:07:02] heart of mine he's going to give me a
[1:07:04] different heart he's going to put his
[1:07:05] he's going to give me a new birth which
[1:07:07] is the baptism of the holy ghost i'm
[1:07:08] going to circumcise your heart
[1:07:11] and then he says the heart of thy seed
[1:07:12] that's a promise i believe we should be
[1:07:14] holding to today as parents
[1:07:16] that we don't just give up and say well
[1:07:18] whatever will happen but believe that
[1:07:19] we've been given a promise
[1:07:21] and it says that thou mayest live
[1:07:25] not just that you might you know get
[1:07:27] through life
[1:07:29] not that you would just have breath but
[1:07:30] notice how he begins to describe what it
[1:07:32] means to
[1:07:33] have life let's look at verse 8 you
[1:07:35] shall return and obey the voice of the
[1:07:36] lord and do all his commandments which i
[1:07:38] command to thee this day
[1:07:39] and the effect of walking in his
[1:07:41] commandments it makes me plenteous
[1:07:43] in every work of thy hand and the fruit
[1:07:45] of thy body in the fruit of thy cattle
[1:07:47] and the fruit of thy land for good for
[1:07:50] the lord will again rejoice over thee
[1:07:52] for good it brings me back to the very
[1:07:54] view that god had of the man and the
[1:07:55] woman in the beginning it is very good
[1:07:57] as he rejoiced over thy father's as he
[1:07:59] rejoiced over creation as a rejoice of
[1:08:01] the man and the woman in the beginning
[1:08:02] said it is
[1:08:03] very good now god is saying that once i
[1:08:05] have circumcised your heart
[1:08:07] and you walk with me and obey my voice
[1:08:08] and obey my commands this is when you're
[1:08:10] really going to have life
[1:08:12] this is when you're really going to
[1:08:14] begin to live for this commandment
[1:08:17] he's talking how if you will hearken to
[1:08:19] the voice of the lord keep his
[1:08:20] commandments and his statutes
[1:08:22] that will return the lord thy god with
[1:08:23] all thy heart and all thy soul verse 11
[1:08:25] for this commandment which i command
[1:08:27] thee this day think of this
[1:08:28] it is not hidden from thee neither is it
[1:08:31] far off
[1:08:32] think of what we've had the privilege of
[1:08:33] receiving in this hour the word is not
[1:08:35] far away from us
[1:08:37] we're not left with all the questions of
[1:08:38] 62 we're not left with all the
[1:08:40] wonderings of 1906
[1:08:41] we're not left with all the philosophies
[1:08:43] of our forefathers we have been set
[1:08:45] before us today it is not hidden from us
[1:08:47] it's not a far off we don't need to have
[1:08:49] someone go into heaven who can find it
[1:08:50] and bring it down to us so we can hear
[1:08:52] it and do it it's already happened
[1:08:54] neither is it beyond the sea that one
[1:08:56] would go over the sea for us and find it
[1:08:57] and bring it to it that we may hear it
[1:08:59] and do it listen
[1:09:00] god has sent the word to us we have
[1:09:02] received it
[1:09:03] so he says in verse 15 i have set before
[1:09:05] thee this day
[1:09:06] life and good and death and evil
[1:09:11] it's the very thing that was set before
[1:09:12] the man and the woman
[1:09:15] life and good and death and evil in that
[1:09:18] i command thee this day to love the lord
[1:09:19] thy god to walk in his ways and to keep
[1:09:21] his commandments and his statutes and
[1:09:22] his judgments that thou mayest live and
[1:09:24] multiply
[1:09:25] and the lord thy god shall bless thee in
[1:09:27] the land whether thou goest to possess
[1:09:28] it
[1:09:29] verse 17 contains the curse if they do
[1:09:32] not follow it as we run out of time
[1:09:34] verse 19 i call heaven and earth to
[1:09:36] record this day against you
[1:09:38] that i have set before you life and
[1:09:40] death blessing
[1:09:41] and cursing therefore choose life that
[1:09:44] both thou
[1:09:45] and thy seed may live
[1:09:49] and it's not just a reference to the
[1:09:51] expiration of breath
[1:09:53] but enjoy life to have life more
[1:09:56] abundantly
[1:09:57] to have a life that's worth living to
[1:09:59] have a reason to live
[1:10:01] that regardless of what someone's estate
[1:10:02] would be and regardless of where they
[1:10:04] would be they would have this
[1:10:04] contentment that have purpose and living
[1:10:07] this is true for those that would live
[1:10:08] in phoenix or those that would live in
[1:10:10] zimbabwe those that would live in south
[1:10:11] africa
[1:10:12] those that would live in even some
[1:10:13] impoverished place if they live in india
[1:10:15] and they're not on the v they're in the
[1:10:16] very bottom of the caste system
[1:10:18] whether it be someone who's dirt poor or
[1:10:20] rich if they can come to this place
[1:10:22] to have chosen the good part to find the
[1:10:24] one thing that is necessary
[1:10:26] it gives you purpose and reason to live
[1:10:30] it'll get you out of bed in the morning
[1:10:33] and he's saying that if you will do this
[1:10:35] and cleave to him he says in verse 20
[1:10:36] for he is thy life
[1:10:38] in the length of thy days the one thing
[1:10:41] that is needful the one thing that is
[1:10:42] necessary
[1:10:43] he is our life
[1:10:46] so i i i'll just sum it up in this and
[1:10:49] i'll share this as i close
[1:10:51] and and if we want to bring in some of
[1:10:53] these things that we've skipped i
[1:10:54] believe the lord will just find a way to
[1:10:55] weave it in later
[1:10:57] in the beginning there was one god
[1:11:00] there was one garden there was one world
[1:11:03] there was one man
[1:11:04] there was one woman and there was one
[1:11:06] word to keep
[1:11:08] that's what it was and brother brahma
[1:11:10] said they had god's word and kept it
[1:11:12] they were alive and safe in god's eden
[1:11:15] with no death around them at all
[1:11:17] and had they kept that one word had they
[1:11:20] kept the word that god had given him we
[1:11:21] would all be living in the perfect eden
[1:11:23] today
[1:11:24] amen had they kept it i just believe i
[1:11:27] would have come forth
[1:11:29] i believe my family would have come
[1:11:31] forth and today we'd be living
[1:11:32] in a perfect paradise without any
[1:11:34] imperfection
[1:11:36] but brother brahm said satan got eve to
[1:11:38] listen to the gospel of theology
[1:11:40] the gospel of knowledge higher schooling
[1:11:42] higher ethics better civilization higher
[1:11:44] education and so forth
[1:11:45] then when he got her to stop and listen
[1:11:48] to him a minute
[1:11:49] to his reasonings stopping
[1:11:53] to listen is what brought in he says the
[1:11:56] gospel of theology the gospel of
[1:11:58] knowledge the gospel of a higher school
[1:11:59] in higher ethics better civilization
[1:12:01] higher education
[1:12:02] was it more more better better but
[1:12:04] contrary
[1:12:06] to the best that god had given
[1:12:09] it may be better to your understanding
[1:12:10] but it can't be better than the best
[1:12:14] and this fall is still deeply rooted in
[1:12:17] all of our wonderings
[1:12:18] all of our confusions all of our
[1:12:20] perplexities this fall when woman the
[1:12:22] woman listened to this false gospel in
[1:12:24] the beginning
[1:12:25] this still resides very deeply within
[1:12:27] our humanity
[1:12:28] because god had given them and it's
[1:12:30] beautiful the way deuteronomy sets it up
[1:12:32] because it's a parallel to what happened
[1:12:34] in the garden
[1:12:34] when it says i've set before thee this
[1:12:37] day life
[1:12:38] and good in death and evil
[1:12:41] god had given them a knowledge or
[1:12:43] concept of
[1:12:45] of he had given them a revelation of
[1:12:47] life and
[1:12:49] to some degree a knowledge of and a
[1:12:51] concept of
[1:12:53] evil and death because he told them not
[1:12:55] to eat of the tree which contained evil
[1:12:57] because if you ate it you would die
[1:12:59] so god had set before them life and
[1:13:01] death
[1:13:02] good and evil but he had done it by his
[1:13:04] word
[1:13:07] and then he has this death and evil or
[1:13:10] even
[1:13:10] symbolized life is symbolized by the
[1:13:13] tree of life and death is symbolized by
[1:13:15] the tree of knowledge
[1:13:16] and what are they they're opposites
[1:13:19] i hope you're thinking very deeply with
[1:13:20] me right now to where you live today not
[1:13:22] that you'd be tempted by a snake holding
[1:13:24] an apple
[1:13:25] and not that we're talking about
[1:13:26] temptation to the original sin i'm
[1:13:28] talking about what's the shock that
[1:13:29] still resides
[1:13:31] within fallen humanity of how the world
[1:13:33] will work on you and warp you
[1:13:35] and cause discontentment and
[1:13:36] dissatisfaction and makes life so
[1:13:38] complicated
[1:13:40] how that god symbol symbolized what god
[1:13:42] had given them in the beginning
[1:13:44] life and good death and evil he had
[1:13:46] given them
[1:13:48] their context by the word of god and
[1:13:50] these things were opposites
[1:13:52] and it was not necessary that the man
[1:13:54] and the woman
[1:13:55] experience evil and death
[1:14:00] it wasn't necessary that they
[1:14:01] experienced it it wasn't necessary that
[1:14:02] even really know what it was
[1:14:04] god had put it in there before them to
[1:14:06] where they were not even to be
[1:14:07] it wasn't necessary that they have it it
[1:14:09] wasn't necessary that they know it
[1:14:11] and that's why god prohibited it if it
[1:14:14] had been necessary
[1:14:15] god would have gave them opportunity in
[1:14:18] his time
[1:14:19] to experience it can you
[1:14:22] just help me a little bit here because
[1:14:24] i'm trying to close
[1:14:25] and and i just feel such a a zeal to
[1:14:29] express
[1:14:29] this think about it that in the
[1:14:31] beginning
[1:14:33] that when god prohibited the tree of
[1:14:35] knowledge of good and evil
[1:14:37] to keep them from death it was because
[1:14:39] it wasn't necessary
[1:14:42] they didn't have to experience the
[1:14:44] opposite
[1:14:45] if there was the potential for more or
[1:14:48] something else it wasn't necessary
[1:14:50] to further their experience to have full
[1:14:52] life to really
[1:14:53] understand and to be like god so god
[1:14:56] prohibited it
[1:14:57] because it was excess god prohibited it
[1:15:00] because it wasn't efficient it got
[1:15:01] prohibited because it wasn't expedient
[1:15:03] the prohibition was because it was not
[1:15:05] necessary for the man or the woman to
[1:15:07] experience it
[1:15:10] and so man ought to have stayed with
[1:15:12] life
[1:15:14] the woman ought to have stayed with that
[1:15:15] what's that which was good
[1:15:17] but what happened wondercotter
[1:15:21] i wonder if
[1:15:24] and so i i end with this choose life
[1:15:29] that you and your family may live
[1:15:32] choose life choose the good part choose
[1:15:35] the one thing that is necessary
[1:15:38] you say how do i do that challenge
[1:15:40] yourself to take a step back from the
[1:15:42] knowledge
[1:15:44] and ask yourself what's necessary
[1:15:48] what's needful thank you for your
[1:15:50] attention tonight let's stand
[1:15:53] choose life
[1:16:12] i want to choose that better part the
[1:16:14] best part
[1:16:15] the good part
[1:16:19] that i may live i don't i don't mean
[1:16:22] that
[1:16:22] that i'm afraid of dying
[1:16:25] but i want to i want to live a life
[1:16:27] that's above the sorrow
[1:16:31] and the sadness the melancholy the
[1:16:34] anxiety
[1:16:36] the worry the fear the dread
[1:16:39] to where you can be at complete liberty
[1:16:42] to engage in the things that you know
[1:16:43] you ought to
[1:16:45] without all the fears in the complex
[1:16:47] that inhibit you
[1:16:49] it's remarkable how we can know exactly
[1:16:51] what is right
[1:16:53] and and even want to do it but being
[1:16:56] given the opportunity
[1:16:57] our own emotions paralyzes
[1:17:01] and we just find that we can't it's that
[1:17:04] dread that heaviness that cloud we can't
[1:17:06] quite get through it
[1:17:08] to even do the things we ought to do
[1:17:09] with our family to even enjoy recreation
[1:17:11] that we otherwise would normally enjoy
[1:17:13] we become paralyzed and so it's not just
[1:17:17] a matter of well i don't want to die
[1:17:18] tomorrow i want to do what's right
[1:17:20] choose life that you may live be free
[1:17:23] free from bondage free from fear
[1:17:26] free to follow the leadership of the
[1:17:27] holy spirit in your life free to express
[1:17:30] christ without the uh without worrying
[1:17:33] about what other people are going to say
[1:17:34] about you all they're going to think i'm
[1:17:35] soft or they're going to think i'm doing
[1:17:36] this i'm thinking
[1:17:37] that just be be christ-like live the
[1:17:38] word of god
[1:17:40] we shouldn't fear about what this word
[1:17:42] is going to produce
[1:17:43] let it produce what it's going to
[1:17:44] produce somehow they want to start
[1:17:46] telling you oh well you're getting off
[1:17:48] track and you believe in this and you
[1:17:49] believe that
[1:17:50] and you have less of this and less of
[1:17:52] that say i just want the word to have
[1:17:54] preeminence
[1:17:55] let god let god have control so i choose
[1:17:58] life tonight
[1:18:00] i've been pondering that scripture as
[1:18:01] for me and my house
[1:18:03] as for me and my house that is the only
[1:18:05] thing i have control over
[1:18:06] as for me and my house we will serve the
[1:18:09] lord
[1:18:10] that's what we're going to do we're
[1:18:11] gonna choose life
[1:18:13] as for me and my house our gracious
[1:18:15] heavenly father tonight as we close this
[1:18:17] service as we dismiss your people
[1:18:20] we pray lord that you would sum up these
[1:18:22] lengthy things
[1:18:24] some may describe it as just a lengthy
[1:18:26] narrative a ted talk or
[1:18:27] just a speech but lord those would just
[1:18:31] be aspersions being cast on a
[1:18:33] supernatural word
[1:18:35] those would just be the critic
[1:18:37] criticisms of a
[1:18:40] man with his own complexes or a woman
[1:18:42] who's who's struggling with their own
[1:18:44] weaknesses to cast
[1:18:45] uh any kind of dispersion or any kind of
[1:18:48] discreditation on these things which are
[1:18:49] expressed for lord they came from the
[1:18:51] word
[1:18:52] i believe they are the word of god and
[1:18:54] though they may have a little bit of my
[1:18:55] own flavor in my own
[1:18:57] uh manner of delivery father i pray that
[1:19:00] the holy spirit
[1:19:01] take the the substance of what was
[1:19:03] expressed tonight
[1:19:05] place it within the heart and the minds
[1:19:08] of your people today
[1:19:10] and may it bring forth good fruit lord
[1:19:14] lord we are challenged on every side we
[1:19:16] are
[1:19:17] bombarded on every side we're afflicted
[1:19:19] in every arena of life health and mind
[1:19:21] and wealth and
[1:19:23] possessions and directions and
[1:19:24] profession lord
[1:19:26] it's it's it's everywhere lord we're
[1:19:29] being
[1:19:29] just as we could just express it this
[1:19:31] way lord if the whole world
[1:19:33] one day politically and militarily will
[1:19:36] turn upon israel to beset them on every
[1:19:38] side
[1:19:39] as it were with guns and nuclear weapons
[1:19:41] and it would be political chaos and
[1:19:43] political pressure and
[1:19:45] uh military pressure
[1:19:48] and the might and the economies and the
[1:19:50] politics and social pressures and
[1:19:52] everything
[1:19:52] would come upon israel naturally one day
[1:19:55] lord
[1:19:56] that's what we're facing today
[1:19:59] without the military without the
[1:20:02] national identity
[1:20:04] but in our spirits and in the warfare
[1:20:06] that we face lord we're beset repressed
[1:20:08] everything's crushing in upon us and
[1:20:11] lord if we're trying to scramble upon
[1:20:13] our walls to figure out ways to keep the
[1:20:14] enemy at bay and fire this and fire that
[1:20:17] and put out this fire
[1:20:18] inlay and take care of this and take
[1:20:20] care of that lord we get so stretched
[1:20:21] out
[1:20:23] along all our walls to where our
[1:20:25] defenses begin to wane and
[1:20:26] somewhere somehow
[1:20:30] the devil gets to us
[1:20:33] lord tonight i want to retreat into your
[1:20:35] presence
[1:20:38] and i'll hide myself in that rock
[1:20:41] and i want to be simple towards your
[1:20:42] promise that i want to believe you and
[1:20:44] take you at your word
[1:20:46] and i do not want father to make the
[1:20:48] mistake of
[1:20:51] trying to do these things on my own and
[1:20:53] figure it out
[1:20:54] engaging in wrestling with questions and
[1:20:56] scenarios
[1:20:57] or how many times have we been robbed of
[1:20:59] our peace because we
[1:21:01] in our own minds begin to indict a
[1:21:03] matter and think about it and ponder it
[1:21:05] and figure it out and
[1:21:06] see if it would see if it happens this
[1:21:08] way if it happens that way and in doing
[1:21:09] so lord we just leave ourselves with
[1:21:11] more fear
[1:21:13] lord we maybe just take the rubik's cube
[1:21:15] of life and give it back to you
[1:21:17] say lord when you gave it to me it was
[1:21:19] it was perfect all i had to do is just
[1:21:21] enjoy
[1:21:22] its beauty but i've twisted it up in so
[1:21:25] many different ways lord i can't figure
[1:21:26] it out
[1:21:28] would you lord just take the rubik's
[1:21:29] cube of my life
[1:21:32] and make it all fit that's our prayer
[1:21:35] tonight lord as we
[1:21:37] cry unto you tonight lord we're choosing
[1:21:39] life as for me and my house we'll just
[1:21:41] simply
[1:21:41] serve you and i know there's a lot that
[1:21:44] that means
[1:21:45] but i just want to serve you bless your
[1:21:48] people tonight
[1:21:50] lord i pray that you be you just be a
[1:21:54] present lord i pray help us
[1:21:57] commit ourselves to you as we always do
[1:21:59] lord bless us as we are dismissed soon
[1:22:01] in the name of the lord jesus christ we
[1:22:02] pray amen amen
