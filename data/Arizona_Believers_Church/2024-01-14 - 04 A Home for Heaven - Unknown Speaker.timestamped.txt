[0:00] we're continuing on the subject of the
[0:01] house of the Lord and I've just had a
[0:05] few services in this subject so far each
[0:07] one I believe stands on its own in terms
[0:09] of the subject matter that we are
[0:11] expressing uh the first one was taken
[0:13] from psalms 27 where David says one
[0:16] thing have I desired and we were looking
[0:17] at whether or not we have that Central
[0:20] focus and aim as a Believer the one
[0:22] thing desired that I may dwell in the
[0:24] house of the Lord all the days of my
[0:26] life and so kind of set the scene for
[0:29] just how important the house of the Lord
[0:31] is and something to be desired and then
[0:33] we looked at it from the standpoint of
[0:35] um seeking after that place by him that
[0:38] place where we could see him and then on
[0:40] Wednesday night we were looking at a
[0:42] home with three rooms and some of those
[0:44] things that brother brandham said that
[0:45] God dwells in a free room house so kind
[0:47] of those pieces there I think this
[0:49] morning it's not necessary that you have
[0:51] heard the last three services to get
[0:53] anything out of this one but I
[0:55] definitely am building and tying some
[0:56] things together and today I want to
[0:59] speak on a home for heaven that might be
[1:02] a little bit uh strange in the wording
[1:04] there but you'll understand just exactly
[1:06] the emphasis by the time we're finish
[1:08] today a home for heaven as we've been
[1:11] looking at the house of the Lord we've
[1:13] looked at it as a Tabernacle in the
[1:15] wilderness also the temple in Jerusalem
[1:17] when the Bible refers to a tabernacle
[1:19] the word is a tent so it's a Dwelling
[1:21] Place a place that someone would live
[1:24] when it's referred to as a temple and
[1:26] this place uh where they worshiped it
[1:28] speaks of a sacred sacred ground or
[1:31] sacred place and so as we're looking at
[1:33] a tabernacle and a temple and those
[1:35] things I want you just to keep this
[1:36] thought in mind a home for heaven and
[1:39] how these things might relate together
[1:42] now in Hebrews chap 10:5 it says
[1:44] wherefore when he cometh into the world
[1:46] he saith sacrifice and offering thou
[1:48] wouldest not but a body hast thou
[1:51] prepared me now this statement of a body
[1:55] that's that has prepared me as we're
[1:56] ending Wednesday night we're pointing
[1:58] out how that God did desire a building
[2:01] made with hands it wasn't his ultimate
[2:03] wasn't the tent in the wilderness the
[2:05] ultimate wasn't even the temple in
[2:07] Jerusalem he didn't want a Dwelling
[2:09] Place made by man but he actually wanted
[2:10] to dwell in man he wanted man himself it
[2:14] wasn't what man could do but it was man
[2:16] himself that God wanted and so as we see
[2:20] the ultimate desire that God had we
[2:22] realize then that the Tabernacle and the
[2:24] temple and the elements thereof uh God
[2:26] is using to tell the story of the
[2:29] Redemption of mankind we say well the
[2:31] Tabernacle this was a wonderful thing
[2:33] and the temple what a wonderful thing
[2:35] and all the elements and all the types
[2:36] and all the Shadows if we just look at
[2:39] it as itself as being an entity and an
[2:42] end all that we're missing that God was
[2:44] wanting to portray his ultimate desire
[2:47] in those things even as brother bradam
[2:49] says that the Creator expresses himself
[2:51] back through creation and so God was
[2:54] expressing himself in Genesis 1 and 2
[2:57] then God is expressing himself in those
[2:59] things that he asked man to build in the
[3:01] temple and the Tabernacle and I forgot
[3:03] to mention it's good to see the Martins
[3:04] back you made it you don't look lay
[3:06] overed or anything you look fresh and
[3:08] spry and ready to go so God bless you
[3:10] welcome back uh welcome home so God is
[3:14] using the house his house on Earth as a
[3:18] way of telling us a story and portraying
[3:20] something it says in Exodus 25:8 and let
[3:24] them make me God speaking now let them
[3:26] make me a sanctuary that I may dwell
[3:29] among them build me a house so I can
[3:32] live with you build me a place on Earth
[3:35] so that I'm a God that you worship I'm a
[3:37] God that you're aware of I'm a God that
[3:38] has made himself known and it may seem
[3:40] as if I come and go and I visit or I'm
[3:42] up on top of a mountain and the prophet
[3:44] has come to see me and uh there's
[3:46] different things that kind of Express a
[3:48] uh Express itself uh as God visiting but
[3:52] now he's saying make me a place so that
[3:54] I can dwell among you make me a place
[3:58] among you and brother brandom so if I
[4:01] could say this then before we go further
[4:02] maybe his review when he's asked him to
[4:05] make a sanctuary he lays it out in a
[4:07] very specific way and we were looking at
[4:09] on Wednesday night how that the
[4:10] Tabernacle and the temple were a house
[4:13] which has divisions in its Arrangement
[4:16] It's Not A House Divided but there is an
[4:18] outer Court there's a holy place and a
[4:20] Most Holy PL place and so you'd see that
[4:22] there's this outer court that is
[4:24] actually sets a perimeter and within
[4:26] that was a tent and that tent had two
[4:29] comp apartments and we looked at that
[4:31] there's like three rooms in this house
[4:33] and brother Brandon piggybacks off of
[4:34] that distinction that God made in this
[4:38] Sanctuary that he would dwell and
[4:40] brother bramman the sermon Fellowship
[4:41] says you only live in a three- room
[4:42] house God lived in a three- room house
[4:45] right soul body and spirit God lived in
[4:48] a three room House Father Son and Holy
[4:50] Ghost so we have three rooms God has
[4:52] manifested in these three offices father
[4:54] Son and Holy Ghost he pointed out uh how
[4:58] that even in Christ that was there's
[5:00] three rooms to him and you live in a
[5:02] three- room house the spirit comes to a
[5:04] three room house justification
[5:05] sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost
[5:08] and you live in a three room house
[5:10] natural first you have the kitchen next
[5:12] you have the Parlor next you have is the
[5:14] bedroom notice the young couple before
[5:16] they complete in that fial love what's
[5:18] the first thing they make a promise one
[5:19] to another they get married and they
[5:21] live in this three room house now you
[5:24] might have two bedrooms you might have
[5:25] an extra dining room was it Wednesday
[5:27] night he said you might have eight
[5:28] kitchens or something like that and I
[5:31] just love that hyperbole just to get our
[5:33] attention but he says you might have an
[5:35] extra dining room but you still only
[5:36] live in three rooms it's kind of
[5:38] dividing that the place you eat the
[5:40] place you Fellowship the place you the
[5:42] private place the place you sleep he's
[5:43] just showing that there's essentially
[5:45] says one place no matter how many
[5:46] pantries you have you only live in a
[5:47] three- room house he says but you only
[5:50] live in three rooms you're living in
[5:51] this body is a three room house soul
[5:53] body Spirit everything anywhere you want
[5:56] to go through nature or whatever more it
[5:58] all comes to those three God is
[6:00] perfected in that number three amen so
[6:04] God dwells in a three room house and
[6:05] where God says make me a sanctuary that
[6:07] I may dwell among you there's something
[6:09] to that Arrangement and so there there
[6:11] is something that God wants to express
[6:13] in us to us in that pattern if I'm
[6:16] dwelling in a three- room house it it
[6:18] must mean something even as uh it wasn't
[6:21] until Moses had erected the the tent
[6:24] around and the walls around the outer
[6:26] court that the Holy Ghost came down and
[6:28] God came down and to that Holy place and
[6:31] identified himself and the glory of the
[6:32] Lord filled up the sanctuary once that
[6:35] structure was complete why did why
[6:37] didn't God just do it as soon as the Ark
[6:38] of the Covenant was in there it had to
[6:40] come into that Arrangement so that God
[6:42] could be signaling something to us and
[6:44] foreshadowing something us that there's
[6:46] something in this picture that I'm
[6:48] trying to tell
[6:50] you now in John chapter 14 now we'll uh
[6:55] take a step further in in our subject
[6:57] those are some things just to get us all
[6:58] on the same page he says in verse one
[7:00] John 14:1 let not your heart be troubled
[7:03] ye believe in God believe also in me now
[7:06] this outstanding statement in my
[7:08] father's house are many mansions if it
[7:11] were not so I would have told you I go
[7:13] to prepare a place for you and if I go
[7:17] and prepare a place for you I will come
[7:20] again and receive you unto myself that
[7:23] where I am there ye may be also and
[7:26] whether I go you know and the way you
[7:28] know now there's the what prompted
[7:30] Thomas to ask this the question the I
[7:32] don't know where you're going I don't
[7:33] know the way but now Jesus says in my
[7:36] father's house there many mansions he
[7:38] starts talking about preparing a place
[7:39] and this phrase that where I am there ye
[7:41] may be also and that's kind of the
[7:42] ultimate to be
[7:44] together and when he says In My Father's
[7:46] House brother Brandon shows us how that
[7:48] in my father's kingdom is the original
[7:51] intent In My Father's House in my
[7:53] father's Kingdom and this place that he
[7:55] goes to prepare I'd like to take a few
[7:57] moments to show that this
[8:00] this place and the father's Kingdom it
[8:03] it includes an eternal Heaven there
[8:06] there's something Eternal about this
[8:08] there's something about the future that
[8:10] he's bringing into view because he says
[8:11] don't be troubled you believe in God
[8:13] believe in me uh and he begins to point
[8:16] them to this future I believe brother
[8:18] brand and things that are to be is using
[8:19] this text and we're going to be drawing
[8:21] heavily from that sermon I and I think
[8:24] even future home he's using some of
[8:25] these elements so it gets us forward
[8:27] looking to the Future and he says in the
[8:30] sermon Satan's Eden he says in my
[8:32] father's house are many and he says or
[8:34] my father's
[8:35] economy in my father's plans as many
[8:38] palaces now I I like that statement in
[8:42] my father's economy so there's something
[8:45] about this economy HH that we think
[8:47] about and he says in my father's plan is
[8:50] many palaces I'll go to prepare a place
[8:52] look how long it is 1500 square miles
[8:55] now he's drawing from the the New
[8:57] Jerusalem say where is it at he has gone
[8:59] to prepare it he is Creator remember
[9:02] this he is Creator he creates all that
[9:04] gold the streets are transparent he is
[9:07] Creator he is making a place brother bam
[9:10] here is pointing to this holy city the
[9:13] New Jerusalem that comes down from God
[9:15] out of heaven in Revelations 21 John saw
[9:17] the holy city New Jerusalem coming down
[9:20] from God out of Heaven prepared as a
[9:22] bride adorned for her husband and heard
[9:24] a great voice out of Heaven saying
[9:26] behold the Tabernacle of God is with me
[9:29] men now remember the Bible says here
[9:31] that there is no Temple
[9:33] there because we see um now the full
[9:36] realization we preach there no more
[9:38] Shadows the full realization of what the
[9:40] temple and Tabernacle represented and he
[9:42] will dwell with them and they shall be
[9:44] his people and God himself shall be with
[9:46] them and be their god notice how much
[9:49] that answers to what Jesus is saying in
[9:51] John 14 uh know that I am in the father
[9:53] and the father in me a a and there's
[9:55] this idea of that's coming together this
[9:57] permanence this future that's pointing
[9:59] to the Future so brother bam is taking
[10:02] in my father's economy or in my father's
[10:05] plans he's a Creator who's going to
[10:08] bring forth this holy city the New
[10:09] Jerusalem where God will be resident
[10:12] with man forever and this is an eternal
[10:15] heaven in the sermon God hiding himself
[10:18] in Simplicity than revealing himself in
[10:19] the
[10:22] same he's speaking of this time in the
[10:25] eth day then the true son of David will
[10:27] then come to his Temple the temple of
[10:29] God the real Tabernacle which is gone
[10:31] away to construct now I get you thinking
[10:34] about some things for he said in John 14
[10:36] in my father's house are many mansions
[10:39] and I will go what did he mean by that
[10:42] it was already for ordained I'll go to
[10:44] prepare a place for you and will return
[10:47] back to receive you unto myself and of
[10:50] course we know that'll be in the great
[10:53] age to come this this is showing us that
[10:55] future that Eighth Day that Eternal day
[10:57] the unending day and the true seed of
[11:00] David will take the throne which is
[11:02] Jesus Christ and there will reign over
[11:05] the church as his bride in the house
[11:07] with him over the 12 tribes of Israel
[11:10] throughout all
[11:11] eternity this is the brother brand I'm
[11:14] taking John 14 and showing us that when
[11:17] it begins to talk about in my father's
[11:19] house are many mansions that it brings
[11:22] into view something that is permanent
[11:25] that is forever and that is ultimately
[11:27] realized in that Eternal Eternal home in
[11:32] heaven now still focusing on this
[11:35] statement in my father's house we know
[11:37] that
[11:38] heaven is associated with God in my
[11:41] father's house are many mansions so we
[11:43] think of God in heaven we think of
[11:45] Heaven in eternity and so this Heaven is
[11:48] associated with God It's associated with
[11:50] our future we often we think about
[11:52] heaven it's a it's a place in the
[11:54] chronology that we go to later right
[11:57] when we think of Heaven it's something f
[11:59] future in Luke 11:2 and I was going
[12:02] through all the places which in where
[12:05] Jesus said uh my Father which is in
[12:07] heaven which is in heaven the Father in
[12:09] Heaven Father in Heaven God in heaven
[12:10] over and over and over again so we
[12:12] associate heaven with the place that God
[12:14] dwells in Luke 11:2 he's teaching how to
[12:17] pray he says when you pray say Our
[12:19] Father which art in heaven Hallowed be
[12:22] thy name thy kingdom come thy will be
[12:25] done as in heaven so in Earth amen so
[12:29] there's God who is in heaven who has a
[12:32] will that is going to accom be
[12:33] accomplished the way things are he says
[12:36] thy kingdom come thy will be done as it
[12:39] is in heaven let it be in earth as
[12:41] things are in heaven let it also be in
[12:43] Earth and when he says Our Father which
[12:45] art in Heaven uh uh it's the Greek word
[12:49] is uranos and it's so speaking to uh
[12:52] speaks of elevation for the sense of
[12:53] something being elevated translated to
[12:56] sky or air it's the idea of elevation
[12:59] and that's something and I don't want to
[13:01] get sidetracked on this but we
[13:03] know the God God is associated with the
[13:06] mountains and and even the temple is
[13:09] built on the mountain Mount Mariah and
[13:12] it's called The Temple Mount or the
[13:13] mountain of the Lord so there the the
[13:16] the rising and the ascending of a
[13:18] mountain is significant uh just in the
[13:21] Jewish culture and it it's the pill the
[13:23] Bible speaks of the pillars and so it's
[13:25] as if these mountains are the pillars of
[13:27] the earth supporting heaven so it's the
[13:29] it's the mountains that go up this idea
[13:31] of elevation that the heavens are beyond
[13:33] that and so Our Father which art in
[13:36] heaven in this sky or this air or it's
[13:38] more of the idea that he's higher than
[13:40] us he's not on our level he's not we're
[13:43] not looking at him face to face as it
[13:45] were so this is a God who is above he's
[13:47] elevated and brother bman the sermon the
[13:49] future home of the Heavenly bridegroom
[13:51] and the Earthly bride think let your
[13:52] will be done in heaven as it is in as it
[13:54] is in heaven let it be in Earth he
[13:56] quotes again John 14 in my father 's
[13:59] house are many mansions in my father's
[14:01] Kingdom there many palaces there's him
[14:04] bringing in that uh emphasis his Christ
[14:07] is there under the construction of this
[14:10] New Jerusalem now now listen close don't
[14:12] move don't don't miss this Christ is in
[14:15] heaven today preparing the New
[14:19] Jerusalem there is there is then in the
[14:23] sense of time where he says this now
[14:26] that you set thinking of what has been
[14:28] what is and what will be he says don't
[14:30] miss this Christ is in heaven so it's a
[14:33] sense that it's Dominion higher than the
[14:35] one we're in one that we can't see one
[14:36] that we can't touch one that we don't
[14:38] even enter into by physical means or
[14:40] distance but he's saying Christ is in
[14:42] heaven preparing the New Jerusalem so
[14:44] then we see that there is a heaven that
[14:46] we have a future in because Christ is
[14:49] there preparing the future home he's
[14:51] preaching the future home and this is
[14:53] what we're looking forward to and this
[14:55] is why we as Christians have a language
[14:59] when we say I have a home in
[15:01] glory and and that we have a desire to
[15:04] go to heaven and we begin to speak about
[15:06] a translation and we speak about the
[15:08] eighth day and we speak about eternity
[15:10] and and we sing and The Poets have
[15:12] written and we say here maybe mentioned
[15:14] every once a while oh I want to make
[15:16] Heaven my home one day when I go home to
[15:19] heaven and when I reach that Shore and
[15:20] when I cross over and I'm there at the
[15:22] Jordan and it's all this idea of this
[15:25] journey and this progress out of time
[15:27] into eternity and the ultimate and I and
[15:30] I want you I I would hope that you would
[15:32] agree that there is this desire to be in
[15:37] heaven there's this desire for what is
[15:39] future I'm not not necessarily wanting
[15:42] to be in heaven now uh uh in in time
[15:45] just kind kind of continue I want the
[15:47] permanence I want the eternity I want I
[15:49] want to leave this earth and be in that
[15:52] Eighth
[15:52] Day this is this is a desire that we
[15:56] have brother B talks about how with with
[15:58] our five senses of our body it contacts
[16:01] our Earthly home so we make our way
[16:03] through Earth through these five senses
[16:05] and then we kind of understand Nature by
[16:07] the five senses of the spirit but then
[16:09] he says we have this sixth sense of
[16:11] Faith down in our soul and that's given
[16:13] to us to contact our Heavenly home so we
[16:18] have things that relate to Earth as a
[16:20] home but then we have a faith which is
[16:22] kind of translates us into another
[16:25] dimension he says and and and we're kind
[16:27] of translated High
[16:29] and now we have faith that believes that
[16:31] there is a home in heaven that this
[16:33] faith is contact in a realm beyond the
[16:35] one that I am now and that I want to be
[16:38] at home in glory I I want to I want to
[16:41] go to heaven which is my home I don't
[16:43] belong here that's my
[16:44] home brother man talking about the
[16:46] believer says inwardly when you're born
[16:48] of the spirit of God you become a
[16:49] supernatural being in there and that
[16:52] supernatural being hungers and thirst
[16:54] for its Heavenly Home Yonder so this
[16:57] this natural person may be concerned
[16:59] about what we eat what we drink what
[17:01] we'll put on where we're going to sleep
[17:02] how the house is going to be arranged
[17:05] and what kind of furniture we have and
[17:06] the things we have in our wall and how
[17:08] clean the house is and and that's just
[17:10] what we do CU these five senses contact
[17:12] this Earthly home and help us navigate
[17:15] it in this body but faith is longing he
[17:18] says for a Heavenly
[17:20] Home Faith isn't connected so much with
[17:23] the Earthly house it's not connected so
[17:25] much with the the elements of Earthly
[17:27] things but faith is connect Ed he says
[17:29] with the Heavenly Home
[17:30] Yonder in the sermon things that are to
[17:37] be I may try to slow down a little bit
[17:40] here in the because I if you can go back
[17:44] if you have time to listen to this
[17:46] brother Bram is talking about how that
[17:49] just before this and he continues to
[17:51] amplify it a little bit later too that
[17:53] when a mother is expecting and a mother
[17:55] and father are expecting a child they
[17:57] make preparation for that that child's
[17:59] arrival and they get the room ready and
[18:01] they buy certain things and and they're
[18:02] preparing themselves for that child's
[18:04] arrival into this world to into its
[18:07] Heavenly home and and he begins to talk
[18:10] about how that God is anticipating your
[18:14] arrival and that in things that are to
[18:17] be that God has sought out very
[18:19] carefully the things that are to be that
[18:21] future home anticipate in your arrival
[18:24] and that there is and he said he said
[18:26] think about it how God put the mountain
[18:28] Mountain out here and arranged nature
[18:29] and how some of you like it this way and
[18:31] some like it that way and God was even
[18:33] thinking about this that God was
[18:36] providing why you were here and if you
[18:37] provide the beauty you love and enjoy
[18:39] and things you enjoy here how much more
[18:41] has he not already been proactive and
[18:44] and forward looking to prepare things
[18:47] for you that you're going to love things
[18:48] that are to
[18:50] be and and and he's using that example
[18:52] of Parenthood begins to think and
[18:54] prepare before even the arrival and he
[18:57] says we should behave ourselves and act
[18:59] like Christians our conduct should be
[19:01] like Christians because we are aliens
[19:03] here this is not our
[19:05] home no we're just put here
[19:08] temporarily we've got to go every one of
[19:11] us tonight now think if God in his Mercy
[19:14] has the mother before the little baby's
[19:16] born it's craving for some vitamin and
[19:20] the mother's words speak forth dad I
[19:21] want canalou or watermelon I want
[19:23] something another so he's referring to
[19:25] how that the woman will crave certain
[19:27] things eat a certain way and it's all
[19:29] for the development of the the baby
[19:33] that's inside of her and there's this uh
[19:36] she craves and she Longs so she's
[19:38] nurturing and feeding this baby and says
[19:41] wow he'll do everything he can to get
[19:42] that because he knows that he wants his
[19:44] child born as perfect as it can be he'll
[19:46] do everything that he's able to to get
[19:48] it now there's the the the the natural
[19:52] Mom and Dad anticipating the arrival of
[19:55] this child into this realm into this
[19:57] earth into its heav and its Earthly home
[20:00] but brother Ram's using it maybe in an
[20:02] interesting way he's using the sense
[20:03] that here we are in the womb of the
[20:05] world in the womb of natural life and
[20:07] but one day we're going to be translated
[20:09] into Eternal born into an eternal realm
[20:11] Eternal Kingdom Eternal home he says how
[20:14] much more
[20:16] abler is he to get
[20:18] it all right if we'll do the things that
[20:21] we need to and the prenatal care and all
[20:23] the things ensure that the baby is born
[20:25] healthy and we're so concerned about it
[20:28] how much more abler think of all the
[20:30] things that a mom will do and a family
[20:32] will do to make sure that that baby is
[20:35] is going to be healthy on not can't eat
[20:37] can't eat um deli meat too much of
[20:39] nitrates in it and can't do this and
[20:41] can't do that what it's looking out
[20:42] after the baby as it develops so that it
[20:44] arrives perfectly and if we do that in
[20:48] the natural and we spend so much money
[20:50] and do so much care and take all these
[20:52] classes and we get a birthing plan and
[20:54] we go to the hospital and there's a lot
[20:55] of things that maybe we do cuz we want
[20:57] the baby to be were born right he said
[20:59] how much more
[21:00] abler how much more abler is God as he
[21:04] anticipates our arrival into this other
[21:06] dimension and these things that are to
[21:08] be he says he's a
[21:10] Creator I remember how we read earlier
[21:13] how brother Brandon was saying he's
[21:14] Creator In My Father's House in my
[21:17] father's economy in my father's plans
[21:19] he's gone to prepare he's Creator he's
[21:22] making a place he said here he says he's
[21:24] a Creator now think how able he is to
[21:26] prepare us a body to live like his own
[21:29] glorious body if we want to
[21:32] live and now he brings it to us there's
[21:35] something in US calls to
[21:38] live and there's something in us that
[21:40] calls to do right that's why he says as
[21:42] Christians we have to live and act right
[21:44] and because we have that desire as the
[21:47] mother would say oh get me cantaloupe
[21:49] dipped in pickle juice and smothered
[21:50] with peanut butter or what however it is
[21:52] we exaggerate those things today uh that
[21:54] there's this idea that the craving is
[21:57] going to meet some need now he's saying
[21:58] that we cry out and he says then God
[22:01] will call somebody on the platform or
[22:03] the pulpit that'll preach the absolute
[22:06] truth so what is it God is doing when he
[22:09] uses the man of God behind the pulpit
[22:11] answering to even your unknown
[22:14] Cravings answering to what you have need
[22:17] of to make it to that Eternal home
[22:20] perfect the preaching of the word here
[22:22] is equal to and is it like a mother who
[22:25] watches out over what she eats knowing
[22:27] that the baby is going to be fed that
[22:29] nutrients and wants a perfect arrival in
[22:32] that into this world how much more abler
[22:35] is God to know what you need and the
[22:38] preaching of the word is God answering
[22:40] to what you need not so much even today
[22:44] but tomorrow in the
[22:47] future
[22:49] wow preach the absolute truth why it
[22:51] shows you the absolute truth shows
[22:54] you so then if you're a real child of
[22:56] God you begin to cry out God God take it
[22:58] away from me circumcise me from this
[23:00] take these things away from
[23:02] me this is a
[23:05] preparation for the translation for that
[23:07] to go to that Heavenly home as he's
[23:09] calling it here says it's need he says
[23:12] why it's needed for your heavenly home
[23:14] that you're going to where he's gone on
[23:17] to prepare amen you've got to be a real
[23:20] word bride of
[23:22] Christ and because we've got to be a
[23:24] real word bride of Christ the word is
[23:26] preached and then even as some on some
[23:29] level of maturity cuz listen we know
[23:31] that when we were first hearing the word
[23:32] of God we might have been standing there
[23:34] holding something the word of God came
[23:36] and just gone it's gone what happened
[23:40] the Holy Spirit just starts to cut away
[23:42] but there comes a certain point in our
[23:43] journey with God where he just says Let
[23:45] It Go and you're going okay yeah yes
[23:50] Lord I'll let it go right and he's not
[23:54] going to he's not going to rip it out of
[23:55] your hand he's not going to do it yeah
[23:58] the word's going to come and then you're
[23:59] going to have to say Lord get take these
[24:00] things away from me I'm I'm
[24:01] relinquishing I'm letting go because
[24:03] it's needed now we're not talking about
[24:06] how to win your way to a new birth says
[24:09] it's needed for your heavenly home so
[24:11] the preaching of the word is God
[24:14] answering to what you have need of now
[24:16] as a son and daughter of God to be in
[24:19] that Heavenly home that you're going to
[24:22] the word now is matching what he's gone
[24:24] to prepare there's still a preparation
[24:27] for the people that he's preparing the
[24:29] place for so if the it's a word Kingdom
[24:31] there that we're going to there's a word
[24:33] here now building the kingdom in your
[24:35] heart giving you the things that you
[24:37] need so that you can fit there because
[24:39] that's where you belong because you're
[24:41] not going to be there temporarily you're
[24:43] only here temporarily and so the things
[24:46] that he's given you that are Eternal are
[24:47] more important than the temporary
[24:49] elements that we feed on to make our
[24:51] lives comfortable in a temporary realm
[24:54] so it's the word that we're feeding on
[24:56] that's making us a real word bride of
[24:58] Christ and we ought to have an attitude
[25:00] say that's really what I
[25:04] need preach the absolute truth to show
[25:08] me what I need not so much to have a
[25:11] good Monday everybody hates Mondays I
[25:13] think is what they say but there's a
[25:15] it's it's not just to have a good Monday
[25:18] it's have a a good Eternal
[25:21] day and and and I hope in and speaking
[25:23] it this way it's kind of changing even
[25:25] the whole point and as we ministered on
[25:28] uh uh the Heaven's mystery and Earth's
[25:30] Glory was this idea of kind of getting
[25:31] us to think more about the reality of
[25:35] this life what it means in the next life
[25:37] so to where we're just not on a
[25:39] treadmill here I we're just well I'm
[25:41] just living you know H home yeah just
[25:42] trying to make it through and the
[25:44] rewards going to come one day and one
[25:46] day one day one day well when you just
[25:48] this statement alone is enough to kind
[25:49] of shatter that Paradigm there is an
[25:52] eternal Heaven There is an eternal home
[25:55] and right now God's preparing me so that
[25:59] I'll fit there you say well I got a
[26:01] perfect Soul that's right but you're a
[26:03] three- room house you don't want to have
[26:05] a really really nice uh as one person
[26:08] said the crown jewel is the powder bath
[26:09] in any home you don't want to just have
[26:11] a perfect powder bath to all the
[26:13] visitors to see that's his house he
[26:16] wants it right not only on the inside
[26:18] but on the inside of the inside the man
[26:21] within the man of the man that three
[26:23] room house he wants it all right and so
[26:26] he's not going to judge you if it's not
[26:28] right he's going to send the word to
[26:29] make it
[26:31] right
[26:34] Hallelujah so Jesus says I go to prepare
[26:36] a place for
[26:37] you a place he's saying where I am with
[26:41] you that where I am there you may be
[26:44] also it's pointing to this heavenly
[26:46] condition as brother bam said we're just
[26:48] put here
[26:49] temporarily even as Israel would have
[26:51] seen this God coming down the mountain
[26:54] and different instances where it seemed
[26:55] as if God was visiting the children of
[26:56] Israel now when Jesus says that where I
[26:59] am there you may be also it's to remove
[27:02] this idea of a yoyo and he visits and he
[27:04] goes and he visits and he goes and we
[27:05] see him now he's gone but it's this idea
[27:07] of a Heavenly permanent
[27:10] condition now having establish that
[27:14] let's look at the Tabernacle and the
[27:17] temple in Exodus 15:1
[27:24] 17 because he says I got to I go to
[27:26] prepare a place for
[27:28] you this
[27:33] place there's as even Moses said show me
[27:38] thy
[27:39] glory and God said there's a place by me
[27:43] in the Clift of a rock in this PL secret
[27:45] place in this elevated place that
[27:48] there's this uh there's so
[27:50] much uh tradition that they could just
[27:53] wrap up into this idea a place where he
[27:57] is
[27:58] it says in Exodus 15:1 17 Thou shalt
[28:01] bring them
[28:02] in and plant them in the mountain of thy
[28:05] inheritance in the place oh Lord which
[28:08] thou Hast made for thee to dwell in in
[28:11] the sanctuary oh Lord which thy hands
[28:13] have
[28:14] established now there is Israel would
[28:18] dwell within uh the children of Israel
[28:20] would dwell within Palestine within
[28:22] those
[28:23] borders there's ways that you could even
[28:24] type out how that would there's even a
[28:26] and I think there's ones that
[28:27] constructed this way were this the
[28:29] element of even Israel Jerusalem
[28:33] Tabernacle of those that arrangement of
[28:35] you have the whole Promised Land then
[28:37] you have the holy city then you have the
[28:39] the temple therein and but yet here we
[28:42] see that there's a place that is made
[28:44] for God to dwell in the sanctuary which
[28:47] thy hands have
[28:48] established it's a place that God dwells
[28:50] there's a number of scriptures we could
[28:51] have used but I want to kind of zero in
[28:54] on this idea that God chose a place on
[28:56] Earth make me a sanct uary make me a
[28:58] house that I may dwell among you then
[29:01] the Bible says in Psalms 11:4 the Lord
[29:03] is in his holy Temple the Lord's Throne
[29:06] is in
[29:06] heaven the idea of a king the king a
[29:10] king and priesthood being brought
[29:12] together the idea of the palace and the
[29:14] temple being brought together the Lord
[29:15] is in his holy Temple his holy Temple we
[29:18] could even say is represented by that
[29:21] little room inside the tent of the the
[29:24] tent of meeting the Tabernacle there
[29:26] I'll I'll meet you
[29:28] and it says the Lord is in his holy
[29:30] Temple but it says the Lord's Throne is
[29:31] in heaven this idea again of associating
[29:34] god with heaven and his Temple and his
[29:37] Tabernacles is Heavenly and that's where
[29:38] he is so when God was made a place in
[29:42] the land of uh Israel or in the promised
[29:45] land he made a was made a sanctuary that
[29:48] Tabernacle that was there in the
[29:50] wilderness and then in uh Israel and the
[29:53] temple that Solomon built it represented
[29:55] now an image of Heaven and Earth that
[29:59] the Lord is in his holy Temple his
[30:00] throne is in heaven that we would see
[30:02] this shadow the the that would see the
[30:05] shadow of God who's in heaven uh his
[30:07] throne is in heaven but now he's in his
[30:09] temple in Earth and it's just it's the
[30:11] bringing together of Heaven and Earth
[30:14] the holy of holies is then even a a
[30:16] shadow of
[30:18] heaven and we went through this and
[30:21] great detail U at some point last year I
[30:23] can't remember when I think it was last
[30:25] year how that the structure of the
[30:26] tabern corresponds to the structure of
[30:29] Heaven and Earth to an Israelite this is
[30:30] in their their their MRA they're writing
[30:33] the midra they're writing about these
[30:35] I'm trying to remember now just exactly
[30:37] which one that it's in they're said the
[30:38] structure the structure of the
[30:40] Tabernacle corresponds to heaven and
[30:44] earth and the holy of holies is
[30:47] represented as heaven now I I hope I
[30:51] hope I can get this far this morning now
[30:53] catch this you have the outer Court
[30:56] where everyone can go the car get ation
[30:57] can go then you have the tent that has
[31:00] uh a holy place where only the priests
[31:02] can
[31:03] go and then you have the most holy place
[31:07] where no one goes but the high priest so
[31:11] a you have this General realm where
[31:13] everyone can be but then there's those
[31:15] who leave that realm and they go into a
[31:16] holy place and then there's only one
[31:18] that can leave that other place and go
[31:19] into the most holy place the holy of
[31:21] holies so the holy of holies then
[31:23] represents that that heaven where God is
[31:26] amen and in that place where God is it's
[31:29] catch this part it's sealed off from you
[31:32] from all the outsiders from all those in
[31:34] the outer Court they can't just go right
[31:37] and look into the most holy place you
[31:39] know there's no peing it's sealed off
[31:41] from View and in that way we we know we
[31:46] know there's a heaven just as an
[31:48] Israelite knew there was a Most Holy
[31:49] place but they don't ever they've never
[31:51] seen it they never gone into it they're
[31:52] not even allowed to go in there they
[31:53] can't go in there and so for us we
[31:58] the same way that heaven is sealed off
[32:00] from our view we don't see heaven we
[32:02] don't know heaven we don't enter into
[32:03] heaven but the holy of holies was the
[32:06] dwelling place of God on Earth where he
[32:09] visibly manifested his glory in Exodus
[32:12] chapter 25
[32:14] again verses 21 to 22 and thou shalt Put
[32:17] The Mercy Seat upon the AR above upon
[32:19] the ark and in the ark Thou shalt put
[32:22] the testimony that I shall give thee and
[32:25] there I will meet with thee and will
[32:27] commune with thee from Above The Mercy
[32:30] Seat from between the two cherubims
[32:32] which are upon the Ark of the testimony
[32:34] of all things which I give thee in
[32:36] commandment unto the children of Israel
[32:38] and for H School assignment I want the
[32:41] uh elementary school kids to diagram
[32:43] that
[32:45] sentence so he says there I will meet
[32:48] with thee and will commune speak declare
[32:50] utter forth command promise even warn
[32:53] it's really very multifaceted what he
[32:55] means but it says there I will meet with
[32:58] thee it's a place of meeting where has
[33:01] he told us he'll meet not in the Holy
[33:04] place not in the outer Court not outside
[33:06] the court but there is a place that I
[33:08] will meet you and it becomes a sacred
[33:10] meeting place between the
[33:13] cherubims Psalms 80 vers1 give ear oh
[33:16] Shepherd of Israel thou that leadest
[33:18] Joseph like a flock thou that dwellest
[33:21] between the cherubims shine forth think
[33:24] of that there is this sacredness to that
[33:27] uh that area above the ark Above The
[33:29] Mercy Seat that's where the presence of
[33:32] God is amen I I think it's just a
[33:36] language that we hear so often that
[33:37] maybe we don't take time to really think
[33:39] about maybe even how kind of Mystic that
[33:42] seems you know there just and there's
[33:45] just you know God is dwelling between in
[33:49] this place but this is what God says now
[33:52] there's a reverence to that to the Jews
[33:53] said we believe that God this this
[33:55] Supernatural one this endless one dwells
[33:58] there in the most holy place in the holy
[34:01] of
[34:02] holies and this is an image of Heaven
[34:05] yeah in heaven God has manifested in his
[34:07] full Glory he's worshiped endlessly even
[34:11] literal cherubs and the the worship that
[34:13] he's given and if I could say this the
[34:17] maybe say this way the reason why it's
[34:19] called Heaven is because God is there
[34:22] there's no God there it's not heaven we
[34:24] might actually call that
[34:25] hell but we make our bed in hell if it's
[34:28] us that's there there he is with us he
[34:29] says so there's this idea that this is
[34:32] what makes it Heaven Every Mountain Top
[34:35] isn't Heavenly unless we would say that
[34:37] there was like heaven or we could say
[34:39] God is on the mountain that makes it a
[34:41] lot like heaven and so God in heaven is
[34:44] manifested in his full Glory worshiped
[34:47] endlessly and so God dwelling above the
[34:49] mercy seat and the holy of holies is
[34:51] receiving worship even in the the the
[34:53] gold that's being laid over and the Cher
[34:55] Bone's being expressed it's an image of
[34:57] heaven and it was there in the holy of
[34:59] holies that he received an offering he
[35:01] received worship so this made the Temple
[35:05] of the Tabernacle What's called the most
[35:07] holy place or the holiest of holies it
[35:09] made it heaven on Earth or Heaven in
[35:13] Earth it would have this type or this
[35:16] image and I I don't even want to water
[35:18] it down by just saying well it's a type
[35:20] it's a type no God was there so when
[35:23] that high priest once a year passed
[35:25] through that Veil into heaven or into
[35:28] the most holy place it was an image of a
[35:31] man cleansed and prepared with the
[35:34] bloody sacrifice going into heaven
[35:37] before God to present the offering that
[35:39] was required this is the way that they
[35:41] even viewed
[35:42] it so Leviticus
[35:45] 16:30 says for on that
[35:48] day the day of atonement the
[35:51] priest on that day shall the priest make
[35:54] an atonement for you to cleanse you
[35:57] that you may be clean from all your sins
[35:59] before the Lord so as we've looked at
[36:02] before the day of atonement cleansed the
[36:04] Tabernacle itself the place but then
[36:07] it's for the cleansing of the people so
[36:10] there was a preparation for the place
[36:12] and for the people of that place the
[36:14] people that would come into that outer
[36:15] Court those who would come for offerings
[36:17] to be made and what's being described in
[36:19] Leviticus 16 is that day of atonement
[36:21] when the high priest entered the holy of
[36:24] holies through that Veil The Veil
[36:27] Between Heaven and Earth as it were to
[36:28] present the
[36:30] sacrifice it was as if the high priest
[36:32] now was entering into
[36:34] heaven to show the sacrifice had been
[36:37] made before God for the cleansing of the
[36:40] people so that Paul says in Hebrews
[36:43] chapter 9: 11 and 12 but Christ being
[36:46] come a high priest of God excuse me high
[36:48] priest of good things to come by a
[36:51] greater and more perfect
[36:53] Tabernacle not made with hands that is
[36:55] to say not of this building yes amen now
[36:59] that that to the Jews the Tabernacle the
[37:01] Tabernacle the temple the temple the
[37:02] temple but now a more perfect
[37:05] Tabernacle for Christ is not entered
[37:07] into the hly place places made with
[37:10] hands well excuse me I'm skipping I'm
[37:13] skipping later it says neither by the
[37:14] blood of goats and calves but by his own
[37:18] blood he entered once in once into the
[37:21] holy Place having obtained Eternal
[37:24] Redemption for us now he doesn't mean
[37:27] that Christ slipped down off the cross
[37:29] and snuck into Jerusalem and went into
[37:32] the most holy place and RI the veil of
[37:33] the temple no he entered into heaven and
[37:37] there as the lamb in the same image as
[37:40] the whole the the high priest would have
[37:41] taken the sacrifice in behind the veil
[37:44] and sprinkled the blood and presented it
[37:46] before the Lord now the lamb has become
[37:49] a high priest that's just it's all
[37:50] coming together it's all coming together
[37:52] Amalgamated together accumulating up cuz
[37:54] now the high priest is the second
[37:56] sacrifice the blood the sacrifice the
[37:59] priest every element being expressed
[38:01] he's entered into the holy
[38:04] Place verse 23 it was therefore
[38:07] necessary that the patterns of things in
[38:09] the heavens should be purified with
[38:12] these so they this is the showing that
[38:15] they purified the elements and the
[38:17] utensils and the things in the
[38:18] Tabernacle which were a pattern of
[38:20] heavenly things they purified it with
[38:21] blood but the Heavenly things themselves
[38:24] with better sacrifices than these
[38:27] for Christ is not entered into the holy
[38:30] places made with
[38:32] hands there's your whether you're
[38:34] talking Temple or
[38:36] Tabernacle whether you're talking Shiloh
[38:38] or
[38:39] Jerusalem which are the figures or the
[38:42] shadow Shadows of the true but Christ
[38:46] has entered into heaven
[38:48] itself now to appear in the presence of
[38:52] God for
[38:53] us Christ as the high priest as the lamb
[38:56] as the bleeding sacrifice when he
[38:58] entered into heaven he went in Beyond
[39:00] the Veil and was presented this
[39:03] conquering king of glory entered into
[39:05] heaven to say it is
[39:07] finished that I have done I I must be
[39:10] about my father's business and business
[39:12] is finished I've made it now into the
[39:14] holy of holies not made with hands but
[39:17] now I've entered Beyond the Veil and now
[39:18] I'm in eternity and as a figure of
[39:21] everything that had been now he's the
[39:23] substance of the Shadow and now he is as
[39:26] it was on Earth the most holy place now
[39:29] he's entered into the most holy Place
[39:32] Heaven made it Christ has entered into
[39:35] heaven
[39:38] itself in the presence of God for
[39:41] us so God is in heaven we see him as
[39:44] above us Christ now becomes our access
[39:48] to God because he's in the presence of
[39:49] God for us sacred meeting place we don't
[39:52] have to go to Jerusalem we don't have to
[39:54] go to Jeffersonville we don't have to go
[39:55] somewhere some special Tabernacle or
[39:58] Temple he says he has appeared for us is
[40:00] in the presence of God for
[40:02] us so in Hebrews chapter 10: 19 and 20
[40:05] having therefore Brethren
[40:07] boldness all right amen are you awake
[40:11] you follow me think about what Christ
[40:13] did he appears in the presence of God
[40:15] for us he's entered not into the holy
[40:17] places made with hands not in the blood
[40:19] of bulls and goats but he has now by his
[40:21] own blood entered into the most holy
[40:24] Place heaven to attain ET obtain Eternal
[40:27] Redemption for us so we see Tabernacle
[40:29] Temple and all the sacrifices and all
[40:31] the ceremony were were a telling the
[40:33] story of redemption Christ has now
[40:35] brought the full substance of the Shadow
[40:38] amen and we accept that with
[40:40] Christ but now brothers and sisters
[40:43] having therefore boldness to enter into
[40:46] the holiest by the blood of
[40:49] Jesus H okay Christ has entered but now
[40:54] we have the boldness to enter into the
[40:57] holiest Christ has entered not into a
[40:59] holy Place made with hands but into
[41:01] heaven itself into the holiest of holies
[41:04] the most holy place now he says we have
[41:07] boldness to enter into the same place by
[41:11] the blood of Jesus by a New and Living
[41:14] Way which Heath consecrated for us
[41:17] through the veil that is to say his
[41:19] flesh I go to prepare a place for you
[41:22] and he says the way you know and where I
[41:25] go you know I am the way the truth the
[41:27] life no man cometh to the father but by
[41:30] me Christ becomes the way into the
[41:32] presence of God into heaven itself as it
[41:37] were
[41:39] Hallelujah brother Brandman telling that
[41:41] story how a woman craves
[41:44] things to bring forth the child in a
[41:46] perfect condition for its Earthly
[41:50] home how much more abler is God to do
[41:53] it because he's a creator I'm G to pick
[41:56] up where we
[41:57] stopped he said it's needed the word he
[42:01] brings he says it's needed for your
[42:03] heavenly home that you're going to going
[42:05] to where he's gone on to prepare now
[42:08] again we've kind of approached this from
[42:09] the idea that in my father's house there
[42:12] many mansions and we think future we
[42:14] think
[42:16] eternity he says you got to be a real
[42:18] word bride of Christ immediately he says
[42:21] I was preaching a few nights ago on the
[42:22] sacrifice in the days of the atonement
[42:25] now we all in the same place
[42:26] kind of see these things kind of now
[42:28] intersecting and weaving together I was
[42:30] preaching on God's provided place of
[42:32] worship God's only provided place of
[42:34] worship I was preaching on the only
[42:37] place that
[42:38] God the only church that God will meet a
[42:41] man in and that's in he said the place
[42:45] that he put his
[42:48] name he said I won't meet them in any
[42:51] other place but the place the gate that
[42:54] I put my name in
[42:57] now he don't meet you in the Methodist
[42:59] gate Baptist gate or Pentecostal gate or
[43:02] any of them I'm not going to make a
[43:05] statement I'm going to ask a
[43:06] hypothetical you can discuss them
[43:07] amongst yourselves would he meet in a
[43:09] brandom
[43:11] gate I mean what Gates does he meet
[43:15] in but he put his name in his
[43:20] son he said I came in my father's name
[43:26] let's pause for a moment take this in
[43:28] come on take it in think about what he's
[43:31] saying here think of all the element all
[43:33] the things we're thinking about now he's
[43:34] saying the place where I put my name and
[43:36] we just think maybe Arizona believer's
[43:40] Church there it is right in our minds
[43:43] we're thinking the name we're thinking
[43:45] of a name we give a place and we try to
[43:48] think of a way to memorialize it be
[43:50] saying in the place that I put my name
[43:51] brother said that God prepared himself a
[43:53] body in the form of the Lord Jesus so it
[43:56] says I where I the place that I put my
[43:59] name and we're just thinking name tag
[44:03] appalation nomination we're just
[44:05] thinking of something that we use
[44:06] linguistically to identify someone as
[44:08] being not being someone else right like
[44:11] I think George Foreman named all his
[44:13] kids Georges and georginas or something
[44:15] like that it's like so there's probably
[44:16] a name he's also given them so he can
[44:18] know all the Georges differently in the
[44:20] georginas and that's what we think a
[44:22] name is but there's so much more to the
[44:25] name go back and read it don't have time
[44:27] to do it today and and I took some of
[44:29] these verses out and maybe we could
[44:31] expound upon it in a future service but
[44:33] in Deuteronomy chapter 12 he said when
[44:35] you entered the promised land you tear
[44:36] down every Grove every Idol every Church
[44:39] everything to a false idol he says the
[44:41] place where they put their names and so
[44:44] there there's something to a place of
[44:45] worship that it's named the idol this is
[44:47] where the idol is this is where the idol
[44:49] is this is where the God is and he says
[44:51] but you know what I'm not the same
[44:53] way you can't just direct the an altar
[44:56] anywhere you want to for me you can't
[44:58] just hang something on a tree and say
[45:00] you're worshiping me no I'm not the same
[45:03] way like these other guys who can just
[45:05] hang up a shingle anywhere and claim to
[45:07] be worshiping God you can't worship me
[45:10] anywhere but where I put my
[45:12] [Music]
[45:13] name so Deuteronomy 12:11 then shall
[45:16] there shall be a place which the Lord
[45:19] your God shall choose to cause his name
[45:23] to dwell there amen now that's
[45:27] different place we put your name you're
[45:28] just going I slap a name tag on it right
[45:30] it's like when you sit down to eat and
[45:32] you haven't quite prayed yet but there's
[45:33] a really good piece of meat there that
[45:35] you want or piece of pie and you have to
[45:37] sing Happy Birthday per first or
[45:38] whatever it is so you go I want that one
[45:40] right there right you kind of named it
[45:42] you've claimed it you've identified it
[45:44] you've done something to mark it so we
[45:45] kind of thinking a name is just kind of
[45:47] like I think one of my brothers did one
[45:49] time they went out and bought a thing of
[45:50] milk and some cereal and they put on it
[45:52] my milk my cereal nobody touched and my
[45:55] dad was kind of like
[45:56] I could have been doing this the whole
[45:58] time right I didn't know I could do that
[46:02] and that's what we think about name but
[46:03] now it's used in a different way cause
[46:06] my name think more about a name than
[46:09] just a Aaron you got to think more about
[46:11] it cause my name to dwell there and
[46:14] there you shall bring all that I command
[46:16] you there you bring your burnt offerings
[46:18] and your sacrifices there you bring your
[46:20] tithes and the heave offering of your
[46:21] hand and all your choice vows which you
[46:23] vow unto the Lord this is the place he
[46:25] says the place that I put my name is not
[46:28] just some place where I snap SLA the
[46:30] first church of whatever or I called it
[46:32] a tabernacle I called it a believing
[46:34] Church no the place that I put my name
[46:37] that means the place that I dwell
[46:41] because it has my name because I'm
[46:43] there how why is heaven called God's
[46:46] home because he's there and the reason
[46:48] why he put his name there cuz he's
[46:52] there cuz the false gods they could just
[46:54] put a name on any tree right didn't
[46:57] didn't matter if they were there or not
[46:58] cuz they're not real so he said the
[47:01] place that I dwell this is my
[47:04] household the place that I put my name
[47:08] so when Jesus said I came in my father's
[47:10] name it's not that we get kind of hung
[47:13] up on the idea of well it's just the
[47:16] name as we were reading the other day
[47:17] writing in the book of Acts says that
[47:19] Josh Jesus brought him into the promised
[47:20] land and he's just using the Greek for
[47:24] Joshua but Jes Jesus Christ was the
[47:27] substance of the Shadows of the
[47:30] temple it was God in flesh God in a body
[47:34] and how is it that he came in his
[47:35] father's name because he dwelt
[47:39] there Jesus said he came in his father's
[47:41] name but if the father never came to
[47:43] dwell in them it's a false
[47:45] Temple it's a false idol just as empty
[47:47] empty as all the other Groves and all
[47:49] the other buildings and all the other
[47:50] altars but the place that he puts his
[47:52] name is the place where he
[47:54] dwells
[47:57] and Jesus says I go to prepare a
[47:59] place brother BR says he's pointing to
[48:01] God's economy our father's economy with
[48:03] many
[48:05] palaces and we
[48:07] think our Heavenly
[48:10] home but where we stopped reading in
[48:12] John chapter 14 is if you ask anything
[48:14] in my name I'll do
[48:16] it and and he's saying you believe that
[48:18] I'm in the father and the father in me
[48:20] the works that I do shall you do also
[48:21] then brother B says Greater Works where
[48:23] it's an end time promise end time
[48:24] prophecy
[48:27] John chapter 14:1
[48:32] 15 beautiful brother we'll read verse 15
[48:36] to 23 because now Jesus
[48:39] continuing he's told him believe in me
[48:42] let not your heart be troubled now we
[48:43] all start looking one day we're looking
[48:46] to the future he says if you love me
[48:47] keep my
[48:49] Commandments and I will pray the father
[48:51] and he shall give you another
[48:53] comforter that he may abide with you
[48:56] forever even the spirit of Truth whom
[48:58] the world cannot receive because it
[49:01] seeth him not neither knoweth him now
[49:05] what do you see there the
[49:08] temple the world can gather in the outer
[49:13] court and some out of that could even be
[49:15] in the Holy place but only those elected
[49:19] and ordained the high priest once a year
[49:21] had a right to see what was behind the
[49:24] veil in the Holy of holies and Jesus
[49:27] says the world does not see him just
[49:29] like nobody else could peer into the
[49:31] holy Place nobody else could peer into
[49:33] the most holy place he says the world
[49:36] seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye
[49:39] know
[49:40] him for he dwelleth with you and shall
[49:44] be in
[49:46] you I will not leave you comfortless I
[49:49] will come to you yet a little while and
[49:52] the world seeth me no more but ye see me
[49:56] amen Brethren having therefore boldness
[49:59] to enter into not a tabernacle made with
[50:03] hands not the outer Court of the
[50:05] Tabernacle in the wilderness not the
[50:06] outer Court of Solomon's Temple not even
[50:08] the holy place of the temple in the
[50:10] Tabernacle not even the holiest of the
[50:11] holies of the house made with by hands
[50:14] but into heaven
[50:16] itself which you see and the world does
[50:18] not
[50:20] see World seeth me no more but you see
[50:22] me because I live ye shall live
[50:24] also
[50:26] you don't have to worry about that high
[50:27] priest who would go in behind the veil
[50:30] and could
[50:31] die at that day ye shall know that I am
[50:34] in the father and ye in me and I in you
[50:36] brother B said that day is this day that
[50:38] Christ is the mystery he that hath my
[50:40] Commandments and keepeth them he it is
[50:43] that loveth me and he that loveth me
[50:45] shall be loved of my father and I will
[50:47] love him hopefully you can come back to
[50:49] this concept this idea of Love there and
[50:52] will manifest myself to him
[50:56] Judas saith unto him not a scariot lord
[50:59] how is it that thou will manifest
[51:01] thyself unto us and not under the world
[51:04] isn't that kind of what the whole Temple
[51:05] Tabernacle thing was all about a place
[51:09] where he would manifest
[51:10] himself arranged in the middle and all
[51:13] the Israel is arranged in orientation to
[51:14] the
[51:15] Tabernacle not to the world the world's
[51:19] all on the outside outside the camp and
[51:21] then Israel's arranged out of and now
[51:23] this Temple this Tabernacle is now in
[51:24] the midst of it
[51:26] I says how is it he says ' if a man love
[51:28] me he'll keep my words and my father
[51:31] will love
[51:32] him and we will come unto
[51:36] him and make our
[51:39] Abode with him
[51:42] amen John 14:2 in my father's
[51:46] house are many mansions house Kingdom
[51:49] domain in my father's house there are
[51:51] many
[51:53] mansions now he says we will come un him
[51:56] and make our Abode with him maybe it
[51:59] doesn't come as any surprise to you but
[52:00] that word is we'll make our
[52:03] mansion with
[52:06] you it's the same
[52:08] word a dwelling a staining and
[52:13] abiding so Jesus is saying there is a
[52:16] place that we're going to but lest you
[52:19] be discouraged unless you get your mind
[52:21] too much looking onto the future this
[52:23] home he's talking about and we'll make
[52:25] our home with him or we'll make our
[52:27] Abode with him in my father's house are
[52:29] many mansions but if you love me my
[52:32] father loveth you and we will make our
[52:35] Mansion oh Hallelujah one day you're
[52:37] going to a mansion but will before you
[52:40] ever get there we'll make our mansion in
[52:45] you that's not a far
[52:47] Kingdom that's not way off down the line
[52:50] that's not just a longing and a hope so
[52:52] and one day it'll be yeah that might be
[52:55] so as this Soul Longs for the eighth day
[52:58] but I hope it kind of gets turned around
[53:00] a little bit he says there is we will
[53:02] come to you and make our mansion in
[53:06] you you catch
[53:08] it though he speaks of a house of many
[53:11] Mansion or a a kingdom with many
[53:14] mansions and a
[53:16] future home there's a present
[53:21] home good in the Old Testament God made
[53:23] his home in the Tabernacle yes he made
[53:26] his home in the temple yes there in the
[53:30] wilderness there in Palestine there in
[53:32] Jerusalem in the New Testament as we
[53:34] spent some time looking at and we've
[53:37] already alluded to we'll do a little bit
[53:39] today God's home is his
[53:41] church in eternity Christ and his bride
[53:44] in the New Jerusalem there the future
[53:47] home will be
[53:49] where
[53:50] hereen on earth in every instance God
[53:55] makes a home on
[53:57] Earth you know what Eden was yes God's
[54:01] home on Earth why did he make it some
[54:04] even speculate in the Jewish tradition
[54:06] that the uh Garden of Eden was a
[54:08] mountain in
[54:09] Paradise there a place where where man
[54:12] dwelt with
[54:13] God it was Heaven in
[54:15] Earth so if I can say this as we bring
[54:18] this around to just our closing
[54:20] Lane making Heaven our home is a high
[54:23] ambition right
[54:25] it's a great aim it's a worthy goal
[54:28] something we're aspiring to it's
[54:30] something we realize is actually taking
[54:32] place when the word is preach say God
[54:34] preaches the word to us because he sees
[54:36] what we have where we're going and what
[54:38] we have need of to meet go there perfect
[54:40] and and Def fit and belong as we use our
[54:43] senses here to contact our Earthly home
[54:46] if if a baby was born into this world
[54:48] missing a sense then it's something's
[54:49] going to be missing in this Earthly home
[54:52] so God now is making this proper
[54:54] development of our faith and the full
[54:56] Perfection of our faith so that when we
[54:57] get there we can perfectly relate and
[54:59] have that perfect realization in our
[55:01] Eternal home so that is a a wonderful
[55:04] ambition it it it it must be in our
[55:08] hearts but let me say this there must be
[55:12] another goal right we've got to have
[55:16] another
[55:17] ambition and that is to be a home for
[55:24] heaven
[55:26] in Ephesians chap 2:
[55:30] 19-22 I'll read this maybe we'll just
[55:32] expand on it on another time now
[55:34] therefore you are no more strangers and
[55:35] foreigners but fellow citizens and
[55:37] Saints and of the household of
[55:40] God and to a Jew they you know they
[55:43] could kind of rub their curls and they
[55:44] could you know yeah that's right we
[55:46] understand how that a gentile can can
[55:49] can become a proelite to our our
[55:52] religion being the family of Faith as it
[55:55] were but then it's like Paul just has
[55:57] this
[55:58] way pushing a little bit step further
[56:01] and are built upon the foundation of the
[56:03] Apostles and
[56:05] Prophets Jesus Christ himself being the
[56:08] Chief Cornerstone so thinking okay we
[56:09] can see the images here we can see in
[56:12] whom all the building fitly framed
[56:15] together groweth unto an Holy Temple in
[56:19] the
[56:21] Lord in whom ye also are build it
[56:25] together for inhabitation of God through
[56:28] the spirit what is Paul trying to convey
[56:31] and express to us as we said that in
[56:34] this new testament and in this time and
[56:36] age that we're living in now in this
[56:38] Gentile dispensation the bride is God's
[56:40] dwelling
[56:41] place that we are now we are God's
[56:46] habitation we are a holy Temple we are
[56:49] built to be a habitation of God we're
[56:51] not just the household of God as a
[56:53] family but you are to be the very place
[56:55] that God dwells in my father's economy
[56:58] there's a plan for many homes that's his
[57:01] household that's his family but right
[57:03] now Peter said ye are Lively Stones
[57:06] built up a spiritual house and he says
[57:09] not just the temple but also the
[57:11] priesthood a holy priesthood to offer up
[57:14] spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God
[57:16] by Jesus Christ am 1 Peter
[57:20] 2:5 as Lively Stones Living Stones your
[57:23] spiritual house amen now we begin to see
[57:25] another image that you have well you
[57:27] have you have the temple and you have
[57:30] the sacrifice and you have the high
[57:31] priest you have these different elements
[57:34] and you have the most holy place has to
[57:35] come before the altar the throne as it
[57:37] were the mercy seat and so there was
[57:40] something slain one who slew it one who
[57:42] takes the blood of it and presents it
[57:44] into heaven but now you have Christ both
[57:47] lamb and high priest comes into
[57:50] heaven to offer up sacrifices andless I
[57:53] get kind of lost in this part here but
[57:55] now you actually have
[57:57] you in whom dwells the high priest
[58:00] washed in the blood of the lamb now you
[58:03] are the temple and you are the priest
[58:06] and you are the kings and God is now
[58:08] just combining every image and element
[58:11] of the Kingdom into his
[58:13] bride I can say this we should we should
[58:16] desire
[58:18] heaven we should have a Rapture bust
[58:20] mentality we should have a longing to
[58:22] leave but let me say this we need conf
[58:27] context David the one thing we can't
[58:29] just have one thing desired and we have
[58:31] this idea I just want to go in the
[58:32] Rapture and and I know that sounds right
[58:35] and it is right but without proper
[58:37] context what do you
[58:38] mean is that why you're driving 100
[58:40] miles an hour with no seat belt right is
[58:43] that why you're ingesting 800 milligrams
[58:45] of caffeine before lunch you know you
[58:47] just want to go to Heaven by any means
[58:49] necessary there's a point at which you
[58:51] realize well maybe it's not just I want
[58:53] to get to heaven
[58:56] we could all just drink Kool-Aid if
[58:57] that's what we were
[58:59] thinking but we we must have
[59:03] context and this is the context I want
[59:05] to give it now and I know I I said this
[59:07] is kind of still building this
[59:09] closed we only desire Heaven listen to
[59:13] me we only desire heaven and we only
[59:17] desire to be in eternity even as natural
[59:19] creatures because God first desired to
[59:22] have a home if God didn't first desire
[59:26] to make man his home then man can never
[59:29] desire to have Heaven as a home God
[59:32] desired man to be his Temple God desired
[59:36] man to be his place of rest and if God
[59:38] had never desired a home you could never
[59:42] desire a heaven as the Bible says we
[59:44] love him because he first loved us our
[59:47] love to him is only born from the fact
[59:50] that he loves us that deep calling to
[59:53] him is only there because the Deep
[59:54] already called to us
[59:57] first brother bam said we're going to
[59:59] life and real eternal life we're going
[1:00:01] to a heaven we're going to a paradise we
[1:00:03] couldn't desire it if it wasn't already
[1:00:05] there but now I want you to think the
[1:00:08] heaven that was already there it's
[1:00:10] heaven and it's not that it longs to
[1:00:12] remain in heaven but it was longing for
[1:00:16] something and as much as we ought to
[1:00:18] desire and long to go to heaven let me
[1:00:21] say it must be the utmost in a sense
[1:00:24] that we've got to have that desire but
[1:00:26] let me say this it is only exceeded by
[1:00:28] God's desire for a
[1:00:31] home Lord and our desire to make a home
[1:00:35] for
[1:00:37] heaven should at least be as great as
[1:00:40] our desire to
[1:00:41] leave amen or something's
[1:00:45] missing you listening let that weigh a
[1:00:48] little bit our desire to leave whatever
[1:00:52] that is our desired to make a home for
[1:00:56] heaven beautiful must at least be the
[1:00:59] same
[1:01:01] amen David said one thing have I desired
[1:01:04] of the Lord Psalms
[1:01:07] 27:4 that will I seek
[1:01:09] after that I may go to home to
[1:01:12] Heaven sit on a cloud playing a
[1:01:17] harp David doesn't say that that I may
[1:01:20] dwell in the house of Lord all the days
[1:01:21] of my life he in this he says that
[1:01:24] speaks of the land of the living he's
[1:01:26] not thinking afterlife he's not thinking
[1:01:29] of Eternity he's not thinking of Heaven
[1:01:31] it chases his Catholic mentality that
[1:01:33] we're just here to pay do Penance we're
[1:01:35] just here to suffer Walk On Our Knees to
[1:01:37] their bloody give all this to the church
[1:01:39] and do all sorts of things and this life
[1:01:40] is just a life of slavery and drudgery
[1:01:43] and pain and all the self-inflicted
[1:01:45] things and misery and backslides listen
[1:01:47] the most consistent theme with modern
[1:01:49] worship music today is I'm sorry I
[1:01:51] smoked a blunt last night and cheated on
[1:01:53] my wife but I'm just so glad that you're
[1:01:54] a beautiful God and you're so
[1:01:56] amazing right they're more concerned
[1:01:59] about having a house of
[1:02:01] worship than they are themselves being a
[1:02:04] sacred meeting place of the Divine and
[1:02:06] it more glorifies and lifts up the the
[1:02:09] cycle and the ups and downs but oh one
[1:02:11] day we're going to go to heaven where I
[1:02:13] don't have to worry about this anymore
[1:02:15] and I don't have to make mistakes we've
[1:02:17] got to get out of this mentality and
[1:02:19] this idea that I'm here until I die and
[1:02:22] have this attitude that David did one
[1:02:24] thing have I desired of the Lord and now
[1:02:27] will I seek after that while I'm living
[1:02:30] I can dwell in the house of the Lord to
[1:02:33] inquire in his Temple to behold his
[1:02:36] Beauty Hallelujah why cuz brother bam
[1:02:39] said the Earthly things only express
[1:02:41] what the Eternal things are and that
[1:02:43] this Earth that we live in today being
[1:02:45] so great as we love it and love to live
[1:02:47] and breathe the air and see the flowers
[1:02:49] and things if that if this here is the
[1:02:52] expression of one that's dying it's only
[1:02:55] expressing one that's
[1:02:57] Eternal Hallelujah that's more real than
[1:03:00] this one we're in
[1:03:02] now then what ought we to have is a
[1:03:05] desire not just to go to heaven but to
[1:03:08] make Heaven a
[1:03:11] home I don't just want to make Heaven my
[1:03:13] home I want to be a home for heaven now
[1:03:17] amen Brothers if you could come to your
[1:03:19] instruments last statement from the
[1:03:20] sermon presence of God
[1:03:23] unrecognized you know what the trouble
[1:03:25] today there's people many
[1:03:30] people with the people there's people
[1:03:33] many people with the
[1:03:35] people that belongs and just go to
[1:03:37] church and have a Creed that's it they
[1:03:39] just go to the house of the Lord they go
[1:03:40] to a house of worship see they've seen
[1:03:43] so much just false so much just
[1:03:46] statues and so much of a big fine
[1:03:50] buildings could it be that that's really
[1:03:53] no different than all the altars and
[1:03:54] Groves and places of worship that
[1:03:56] littered Palestine before God told them
[1:03:59] in Deuteronomy 12 go and tear them all
[1:04:01] down and not every man can just erect
[1:04:03] his own altar there's going to be one
[1:04:05] place I put my
[1:04:07] name brother says let's never get off in
[1:04:10] that kind of a
[1:04:13] tantrum God don't dwell in big
[1:04:16] buildings he dwells in your
[1:04:19] heart God don't dwell in intellectual
[1:04:22] education he's far from it so if you
[1:04:24] thought I was reading this just to
[1:04:26] justify this church building which even
[1:04:29] a guy short like me look at
[1:04:31] that uh these are 12T ceilings for those
[1:04:34] who watching online I just so you know
[1:04:37] I'm not reading this to justify myself
[1:04:39] you don't dwell in intellectual
[1:04:41] education this is not he's far from it
[1:04:45] he dwells in humility
[1:04:48] Simplicity God dwells in humility in
[1:04:51] your
[1:04:52] heart he dwell in his word and his word
[1:04:55] comes into your heart and speaks itself
[1:04:57] out and
[1:04:57] declare he interprets his own word
[1:05:00] through
[1:05:01] you he's trying to find somebody he can
[1:05:05] get a hold of to
[1:05:07] show that he is still
[1:05:10] God and not just God of the
[1:05:13] mountain not just the god of Jacob not
[1:05:15] just the god of William brandham the god
[1:05:19] of the Bible the god of Heavens but a
[1:05:22] God who wants to get a hold of
[1:05:24] you because he wants your heart to be
[1:05:28] his
[1:05:30] home and yes we want to go to heaven and
[1:05:33] we can sing brother when we get to
[1:05:35] heaven won't we be glad we can sing when
[1:05:37] we all get to heaven When the Saints Go
[1:05:38] Marching In and we can sing a lot of
[1:05:40] songs about making Heaven our home and I
[1:05:42] got a home in glory land but all of that
[1:05:45] is nothing but an empty Altar and false
[1:05:48] worship unless we're making a home for
[1:05:51] heaven now in our hearts amen
[1:05:54] and hopefully Wednesday night we'll
[1:05:56] expound upon a little bit of where these
[1:05:58] how much more we can do this but we've
[1:06:00] got to have the
[1:06:02] context I only want to go to heaven
[1:06:05] because God wanted to come to
[1:06:07] Earth and make his home in me not just
[1:06:09] with me but in me let's make that our
[1:06:12] ambition stand with me today and we'll
[1:06:15] pray together
