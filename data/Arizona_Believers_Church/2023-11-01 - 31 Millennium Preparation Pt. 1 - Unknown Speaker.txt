TRANSCRIPT
========================================
title tonight is Millennium preparation Millennium preparation I I'm using that title because I wanted to um take in that idea of being prepared for the Millennium and a millennium preparation and that there's something about the Millennium that takes that goes through a process or something about the Millennium that stands for something and so this preparation is going to look at the preparation for the Earth but then also for us and so there's um a lot of types we're still draw wanting to draw from for ourselves as we've been looking at the sermon future home and I will be drawing a lot from the sermon future home tonight in that sermon brother B talks about the three-stage process for the Redemption of the Earth or the Plan of Redemption is in a three-stage process we could just say that in general a three-stage process for Redemption and just because Redemption is a three-stage process we don't just boil everything down to threes we realize that this uh uh Manifest this Redemption manifest in great ways in ways that are so uh far beyond our language in ways that we say well this is part of the Plan of Redemption and these are Redemption benefits and all the blessings and benefits of redemption are included through that sta three-stage process and we know that the Redemption of the earth brings forth a perfect and eternal Paradise that's what we've been reading about in Revelations 21 and there the Earth will be full of Glory it'll be full of light I have no need of the Sun in that City the lamb will be the light the glory of the Lord will be the light it'll be full of the knowledge of the Lord and that's describe in an eighth day a perfect condition and so we've been using as brother bradam does the Redemption of the earth to show a type of the work of the holy spirit in us right now as we see the Earth go through a three-stage process that final stage being burnt with fire brother brand type in that to the baptism of the Holy Ghost on your soul and we realize that the Earth is going through a process and will manifest something then my soul having already gone through that process then can manifest right now in this earth right now we can see that there's Redemption that's expressed and so our Redemption is multifaceted it go it comes to a three-part process uh to redeem the soul but then we have Redemption of the mind we have Redemption of the body and so there's a lot that goes to this Redemption a lot of types that you can use but at the end of the day we just say God's going to redeem us totally redeem us completely and as we mentioned before the purpose of the Holy Spirit right now is to expand the kingdom of God in our lives I have the holy ghost in my soul I I don't want it just to be a confession I don't want it just to be a mystery of faith alone but I want my faith to be shown by my works I want the fruits of the spirit in my life I want the power of God operating in not only way that I live by myself but in how I treat others and so the purpose of the Holy Ghost indwelling in your soul is that he can manifest himself through his people we looked at those scriptures of the knowledge of the Lord growing and increasing and just pushing out that's what uh that's what is at the heart of this taking the scripture the whole Earth shall be full the knowledge of the Lord and if we have the knowledge of God in our souls and we have the teacher inside teacher to teach us and we're calling upon God for Revelation more than anything then let it just keep pushing out pushing out and pushing out and that scripture we used to end the service last time in Proverbs 24:5 a wise man is strong yeah a man of knowledge increaseth strength knowledge is power is what we took from that some of the translations and so as we increase in the knowledge of God it looses our power as we increase in the revelation of Jesus Christ it manifest in power it manifests wisdom and righteousness and discernment and we want that in our lives our everyday lives now if you could look at verse 9 and Isaiah chapter 11 and we'll go uh we'll start with this and then we're going to uh move quickly to Isaiah chapter 65 but I want to recapture some things that we've looked at on this it says they shall not hurt nor destroy in all my Holy Mountain we've read how the wolf and the lamb shall lie down together and and the cow and the bear feed together and the young one shall lie down together it's such an incredible thing a lion shall eat straw like an ox so it's describing this Millennial condition and it says they shall not hurt nor destroy in all my Holy Mountain for the Earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the Sea full of his knowledge is full of his judgment full of his opinion full of his discernment and so if there's going to be uh the earth going to be full of his knowledge it's going to be reigned by a correct understanding of things there's going to be a a peace that Reigns there's going to be a righteousness that Reigns and it's coming through the knowledge of the Lord there's going to be a knowledge of the character of God there's going to be a submission to the character of God there's going to be an intimate understanding of God's will and I want you to put yourself in that relationship say that's going to be through me that I as a son or daughter of God on the earth I'm going to be full of the knowledge of God I'm going to be in his character I'm going to have the mind of Christ to know what he wants done with the word uh I'm going to there's going to be no chance for evil there's going to be no lying there's going to be no stealing there's going to be a reign of per perfect character and we know that all things unkind and Unholy and unhappy and and unrighteous and wicked stem from the lack of knowledge of God the knowledge of God stems from an ignorance we looked at the Perils of ignorance before as Hosea said my people are destroyed for the lack of knowledge so when Isaiah is describing this time of no unkindness and no selfishness and no destruction and no Wars and and peace he said the Earth's going to be full of the knowledge of God and I'm want us to make a direct connection that it's because the knowledge of the Lord has preeminence that all unrighteousness and everything else is vanished away and so this reign of righteousness that Isaiah is describing this reign of righteousness and peace it's in the Millennium what's being described here in Isaiah 11 is in the Millennium so it's not eternity or it's not the Eighth Day and the part that we've been emphasizing and building on is that there will be a kingdom and there is a king there will be a kingdom of power there will be a kingdom of knowledge we know in the eth day but as we see this type in scripture there will be a power of God in the bride there will be a knowledge of God in the earth there will be a a glory of God in the earth before the Earth full Redemption I just to spell it out plainly as I look at it that as the Earth is going to be full of the knowledge of God full of the light of God full of the glory of God and we see that this is a characteristic of the Earth in Revelations 21:22 and that's after the entire Earth is renovated and changed through the baptism of fire and I'm wanting to point this out that if that's what's going to transp transpire after the Earth's Redemption and before it's uh surface is changed then we in type can experience a growing and increase of the knowledge of God and the glory of God and the power of God in us now prior to our body change amen that there's a growing there's an increasing there's a rain of the Holy Spirit on our lives even before full Redemption even before the Millennium there's a there's a measure that we're to manifest and so I want to if you could turn to Isaiah chapter 65 I want to examine what this Millennial condition means to us and and to the Earth if I could say that and what it means to us now actually by looking at what it'll mean to the earth I want start with a Isaiah chap 65: 17 to2 5 he says for behold I create new heavens and a new Earth and the former shall not be remembered nor come into mine there's a lot that's a mouthful there's so much in that so much that we could think about the former shall not be remembered nor come into mine that that's a pretty uh heavy statement there but he says for behold I create new heavens and a new Earth I'm not going to get to it tonight I may reference it a little bit but I'm just kind of careful just how far I go how long I go tonight but we know that scripture can have compound meaning it can be conf fulfilled in compound ways we say see some scriptures that refer back to a historical event but yet it's prophesying of a future event we see some scriptures that are fulfilled literally to the Jews spiritually to the Gentiles we see some scriptures that can actually be fulfilled in one way fulfilled in another way so there going to be compound meaning and compound types to scriptures and as I read this there's two different ways you could look at it and and see that there is a fulfillment in one way and a greater fulfillment in another but verse 17 refers plainly to a new heavens and a new Earth we know Revelations chap 21 John says I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth second Peter 3 refers to the same that we're we're looking for a new Heaven and a new Earth where things will be changed and burnt up and so there is these references to a new world that has changed and as we took time to go through some of these scriptures we found out the change of the Earth was not a total Annihilation or an abandonment of the earth and a creation of a new Earth but it was the world that was being redeemed completely to be that place where the new city comes down out of Heaven from God and comes up out of the Earth or comes down to the Earth however you look at it and manifest on the earth for all eternity and that is a new Heaven and new earth and as it's described here I I created a new Heaven and new earth brother mam takes the future home of the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly bride he says so it's just a great Mountain as he describes that new city in Revelations 21 and uses second Peter chapter 3 to show us how it's formed like the pyramid and the city is on the mountain Glory there you are there is the paradise of God the light of the world that perfect Kingdom not the seventh day the Eternal one not the Millennium the new Earth now this is what he taught very plainly that this New Jerusalem and the new Heaven and new earth described in re Revelation 21 is the paradise of God it is that perfect Kingdom he says it's not the Millennium he calls it the a day so as we begin to read in verse 18 to verse 25 it begins to describe what we would refer to and what brother Brandon refers to as the Millennium or the kingdom age of the Millennium and not the Eternal perfect age now we could look at some of these scriptures and say well no doubt there are certain things that are going to be manifested in that time that will also be manifested in eternity you're going to be in a glorified body in the Millennium you're going to have a glorified body on the eth day there's going to be things that'll be true in the Millennium that will also be true throughout all eternity but there's also things here that we read that clearly point to a time which is end time and not eternity as I continue to read but be you glad and rejoice forever in that which I create for behold I create Jerusalem a rejoicing and her people a joy now think of yourself in this think of types of the Bride think of what this Millennial Kingdom could be and what it foreshadows in eternity and I will rejoice in Jerusalem and joy in my people and the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her nor the voice of crying there shall be no more than an infant of days nor an old man that hath not fulfilled his days for the child shall die a 100 years old now catches our attention because it's talking about a child dying and that would catch our attention I think now that couldn't be uh after death is destroyed as we'll come to it in a little bit this is an this is a unique statement describing this and The Sinner being hundred years old shall be accursed special time special dispensation it's placed by the message of the hour in the Millennium and they shall build house and inhabit them they shall plant Vineyards and eat the fruit of them they shall not build and another inhabit they shall not plant and another eat which is their experience in the promised land as Israel's experience when they would plant crops the enemy would come and take it they'd build houses that they'd be overtaken and they'd be come strangers and driven to foreign lands they shall not plant another eat for as the day of the tree are the days of my people and my elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands they shall not labor in vain nor bring forth forth for trouble for they are the the seed of the Blessed of the Lord and their offspring with them and it shall come to pass that before they call I will answer and while they are yet speaking I will hear incredible descriptions the wolf and the lamb shall feed together and the lion shall eat straw like the bulock now we see some symmetry to Isaiah chap 11 and the dust shall be the Serpent's meat they shall not hurt nor destroy in all my Holy Mountain saith the Lord Brother Bram refers to this uh scripture in the sermon the future home and we're looking at how it also is using this in Isaiah 11:9 they shall not hurt nor destroy in all my Holy Mountain brother Bram takes this scripture and in future home he says speaking of the Millennium that thousand years of rest for the people of God As It said In Isaiah uh 11:10 and there the his rest shall be glorious this is described in a millennial time Millennial means a thousand years right we understand that a thousand year reign on the earth in Revelations 20:6 says blessed and holy is he that hath part heart in the first resurrection on such the second death hath no power but they shall be Priests of God and of Christ and shall reign with him a thousand years now if you could with me help me tonight uh just to minister this I know it's teaching and maybe uh more more kind of preaching Manner and preaching style uh kind of lends itself maybe to a little bit more response and so as you can help me tonight if it sounds familiar to you and and you can amen it just kind of encourage me a bit I know it'll help me but as we read this we recognize this very plainly that the second death hath no power over the blessed and holy and they shall be priest of God and of Christ and they shall reign with him a thousand years this thousand year reign is what we call the millennial Reign or the Millennium that's where we get the term thousand years from and this is a millennial reign of Christ the King and the bride the queen this is a special time for them uh for them upon Earth and God has a very specific purpose in it now if I could do something that that's very difficult for me summarize about 20 services in just a few statements in the eighth day as we might call it I want to call that the Eternal Reign because there's going to be an eternal Reign we say a millennial Reign for a thousand years it doesn't mean he abcots his throne and we start all over and it's chaos again but there'll be an eternal rain and that Eternal rain we could call the Eighth Day brother brandom calls it our future home we could call it the perfect Eden the very thing that all things foreshadowed the thing that God are the fruits of all the seed that were swn it is the perfect Kingdom it is the perfect age Without End though we could say about the Millennium that there's a Perfection and there's something Sublime about it and there's a beauty in it but yet that is going to have an end in order to move on into that perfect day which is featured and expressed in that Eighth Day so that's an eternal Reign then the millennial reign as we read it here they shall be Priests of God and of Christ and shall reign with him a thousand years it's the seventh day in TI it is not the perfect Eden but a restored Eden you may be very familiar with this language but brother Bram calls it the honeymoon that Christ and his bride are going to spend a Thousand-Year honeymoon on Earth might see well that's kind of peculiar why would he do that well man we could save a lot of money if we could figure out why we have honeymoons and whether or not we need them it might be too late for some of us but maybe we could save the trouble for others but there's this honeymoon where Christ wants to spend a thousand years on the earth that was created for the purpose of getting a bride out of it the Earth that Adam had full demeaning and control over but yet did not live out the thousand years he wants to come back with his bride and live out that day that Adam and the woman never lived out and fully possess and Reign and manifest what could have been the full power and potential of the man and the woman in the garden and so it's going to be a honeymoon it's going to be a rest as God rested on the seventh day and while he took his rest is when Satan snuck in and caused the fall there is going to be a rest wherein there will be no fall during that f th years and what we must understand is it's called a thousand years it's still in time it's not eternity so it's distinctly different from the Eternal Reign right everybody with me so far I hope your ears aren't bleeding hope it's okay tonight now in the sermon the future home I'm going to read from several places and this is where I have a lot of lot of quotes to read and I just felt such a peace to be able to do it with you all knowing that you're you understand these things already and knowing that if there's anything that the Holy Spirit can do to place scripture more perfectly and place the word of God more perfectly it's always helpful to us we've been getting some good questions on these things and um I'm not going to quite be able to get to it tonight but a lot of people who know the message have heard things that have been taught and they read things in the seals and they they're piecing this picture together and as we've been going through this very very slowly a greater picture begins to develop there and some of us may realize oh I had this placed here but now I realize it's over here and oh I I hadn't even thought about that I didn't even think about those things so tonight if we share something you haven't thought about before just put it before the Lord I weigh it out in your heart and I know he'll give you understanding but some of these things if not all of them you've heard before but I want you just to take some time to see how brother bam places all these future events now in the sermon the future home he says now perfectly Noah was a type of those carried over I know there's a lot that we could express in this subject in these types he says remember when Noah came out ham was with them sin was still in there sin went right on over through the ark unbelief doubt went over in the ark carried over above the Judgment but Enoch went higher than the ark and he went on into the presence of God so now he's kind of tracking different types and so Enoch is a type of the Bride that's going to bypass tribulation now brother BR is identifying that after tribulation there's going to be the Earth and he's looking at a different kind of type he says but Noah went through and come out and there was still sin type of the Millennium of the world's condition I I would caution the urge sometimes to take the type and just keep expanding that and figure out the type instead of just looking at the what brother Ram's pointing to what he's wanting us to understand in the type is that well there's still going to be sin that's going to carry over that sin is not completely done away with he's wanting us to recognize how in this time of the Millennium it's a special time and that there's still sin uh to be dealt with later if I could put that way says the Millennium is not the end of it there will still be time after the Millennium the Millennium is a space of time but not the new Earth no indeed notice in that we'll get to it after a bit see the Earth redeemed goes back to its original owner again he took it from Satan he pulled taking the Earth away from Satan just like he took you away from Satan now that's is the parallel once again says like he took the little woman at the well away from Stan and this is in that sermon he uses that great principle of how when the seed is in you and and the word comes by something's flashing back something responds back there was no darkness in that woman at the Well's Soul so when the word came her way it redeemed her she was a redeemed attribute of God he said but yet the same thing manifested to the priest it reflected back Darkness that's what he teaches at that sermon so he says and they that little woman he took her away from Satan there stood the priest though he was with God he had nothing nothing reflected back now what a incredible type he's saying God's going to take back this Earth from Satan that this is the part of God taking it back just as he took you back from Satan those are those processes parallel and as he shows us but he says the Millennium the thousand years is not the end of all things if I could even say this if when he took you back from Satan it wasn't the end of everything and it wasn't the end of everything and you could just imagine what those things are but you realize it was the end of some things but maybe not the end of all things so there is there's this thing that happens it's permanent but yet there's this unfolding of other things uh not just temporal but leading out into great Glory now he takes it again so I want you to see that type of Noah because we want to come to it again he says this Millennium Reign the thousand years is not the new Earth the Millennium Reign is a different Reign that's what we go into the Millennium but that isn't the new Earth the new heaven no no that's just a resting place a rest period not all the new heavens and the new Earth not at all the new heavens and and Earth for you see in the Millennium we have things that we would not go into to that that would not go into that it's a type of the old seventh day out of Eden the seventh day after he made the world the seventh day he rested in Eden and the Millennium catching this how brother B's teaching this how that the millennial Reign is a different Reign from what he's calling the new Heaven and new earth through Revelations 21 completely different days the Millennium is a rest period not at all the new heavens and new earth and when he's saying that he's very specific about that final outcome in the third stage the seventh day he rested in Eden this is a type of the Millennium and he says there's things that would not go into that there's things that will not that would that still exist that won't go into that Eighth Day is what he's saying says and another place I think this is chronologically in the sermon notice not the perfect world this mum it's a type of the seventh day now catch the order then comes the white Throne judgment see we still have judgment so there's a perfect world rep presented after the baptism of fire in the 8th day Revelations 21 now in Revelations 20 we see they shall reign with him a thousand years a lot of these scriptures Isaiah 65 brother Brandon points out is describing a millennium a type of the seventh day and he said after that comes white Throne judgment he says we still have judgment so that puts scriptures in there that still have to be manifested this day of Judgment of God says we we're still in time in the lennium it's a day 10,000 years it's a time element no don't get that mixed up with the new Earth now cuz it's not you recognize again brother bradam showing that this new Earth that he is talking about in the scripture and in this sermon represents a very specific time but yet the Millennium represents a different time they all they're all working together these aren't competing ages now which one's better you think you think the Millennium the seventh day Seven's a pretty good number I mean it's not there's a debate between the seventh and the eighth they're Le one leading into the other now in question and answers part four and I realize this part may be a little bit backwards because I have I'm quoting from the evening question and answers and I'll quote from part three from the morning here in a moment this is the order brother B shows us the Millennium the white throne and then the new Earth so we see this here in 1964 he says the bride when she's taken from the church then the church age will cease leod deia goes into chaos now I would I would suggest just really chewing on that one really thinking about what kind of levels what what the Imp ation are when brother talks about this when the bride when she's taken from the church because there's a message to call her out of the church in this age so there's a lot of spiritual application here and then a very lot of literal things when the bride goes into Rapture leot deia goes into chaos the bride goes to glory these are just some orders that he's going through very quickly the tribulation period sets in upon the sleeping virgin for three and a half years while Israel is getting its prophecy then tribulation sets in upon Israel and then comes the battle of Armageddon which destroys all things so there's a destruction and then the bride returns back with the groom for a thousand years the millennial Reign after that comes the white Throne judgment after that comes the new Heavens A New Earth and the new city coming down from God out of Heaven eternity and time Blends together see how this is uh brother BR is just laying this out there's a lot of scriptures here there's a lot of things that uh maybe Merit a lot of time and a lot of study for some but this is Brother R giv us a quick overview of things that are going to transpire and we know that there's a message calling the bride out of Leo deia right now that you've heard you've heard from your theophany you're feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man and that word your feet on is going to carry you to your unseen bridegroom and when this bride leaves the Earth there's no more purpose of the Holy Ghost because now full redemption's complete for the bride there's no more Holy Ghost left in the earth and tribulation sets in on all those that are left behind after this tribulation period brother talks about the battle of Armageddon this destruction of all things and then the bride returning back we we use it in Malachi in the uh in maybe next Wednesday night on how we'll return and walk on the ashes of the wicked so there's some destruction there's some chaos uh some judgment that's happening in the Earth but says they return back for a millennial Reign after that Reign is white Throne judgment then the new Heaven and new earth so you see brother Bram bringing these things out uh from future home which was just earlier that month now he's laying it out kind of bullet points there in the evening here of August 30 1964 he addresses it in the morning he says we got a thousand years after the church has gone home and comes back upon the Earth then time ceases in the new heavens and and new earth there's a lot of questions on well it's time over and where are we and what's happening and I know that there's there is a false teaching that said that claims are in the Millennium now and wow what a sad teaching I mean just what a what an absolutely sad teaching could you just imagine you thinking you're in the Millennium now you just go up to you know the line hey lion come here buddy right well guess what guess who's not eating straw yet there's a there's be huge disappointment to think that this is the Millennium that was prophesied but yet you could see how so much of what that Millennium represents has already begun in you as a believer in your soul and that that what that Kingdom represents and what's being transpired that there's almost this this moving along on these different tracks where there's a millennium rising up within you right now and then once this body is changed you know you're going to come right back and being a perfect body in a millennium on Earth living out a thousand years and yet you know then that the Earth is going to receive its baptism of fire and everything see everything just keeps spinning on Redemption to Redemption to Redemption to Redemption Perfection to Perfection to Perfection shining to that perfect day where the lamb will be the light so there's so there's these things that just keep unfolding while the thousand years after the church has gone home and comes back to the Earth then time ceases the new heavens and new earth now the Millennium is not the new heavens and new earth there will still be sin after the Millennium the Millennium is a type of Noah going in the ark and carried over and brought ham and them on the other side sin even come out of the Ark but Enoch the translated one was a type of the Bride that went up not the one that was carried over so sin will still be on the other side of the Millennium but not during the Millennium during the Millennium is peace but sin will be dealt with the other side of the Millennium and then time f Fades out so this full fading out of time is waiting it's waiting still yet for a second Resurrection even to where this first resurrection is encompassing and even this coming to the Lord we could even identify is encompassing this Millennial Reign even now as he makes reference to Noah in these different places and these types let's look at second Peter chapter 3: 6 and 7 well I'm wishing I would have brought more notes tonight I just going pretty quick here so in second Peter chapter 3: 6 and 7 whereby the world that then was being overflowed with water perished so the world that then was is we use in type of the world that was before the flood but the heavens and the Earth which are now by the same word are kept in store reserved UND fire against the day of judgment and predition of ungodly men brother baham says there's still judgment we still have judgment we still have sin that will be dealt with on the other side of the Millennium so the Earth uh the the Heaven and Earth that are now are kept in store reserved under fire fire that's going to come on the day of judgment when there's judgment upon sin the predition of ungodly men that's going to be that baptism of fire that brother talks about that completely renovates the Earth and her whole Serv has changed and and it's changed entirely and completely representing what happens to your soul Peter is saying this is how the transformation happens he talk about the Earth melting with fervent heat and everything being changed Peter's identifying something here that there is going to be the the the world that is now is saved to be changed completely and he's identifying something about the new Heaven and new earth in Isaiah 65 and even elsewhere because we know that the Millennium represents here a perishing of the world that is because he says whereby the world that then was being overflowed with water perished but there's going to be a new Heaven and new earth wherein the Heaven and Earth now perish right you see those things in the scripture so this Millennium that is going to be ushered in as we read in Isaiah 65 represents a perishing of the world that is if I can say this there's a premillennial change as we read it that the new Heaven and Earth shall be passed away that word means to pass from one state to another talk about a regeneration and a renewal it's not taking the Earth it is and saying oh you're gone you're done and burn it up toward it completely uh dissipates and everything just gone it's no longer there and then God brings down a new Heaven A New Earth and creates a new Heaven A New Earth though we might read this and says oh I'm creating behold I created a new Heaven and a new Earth and and these things are passed away and these things are no more it's not a total annihilation of the earth we know that in the eth day but now I want you to recognize something about this Millennium that comes cuz brother B says there's going to be something that destroys all things and just as the Earth this parished world that emerges from the flood there's going to be a new Earth that's going to emerge for the Millennium can you catch that I I'll I'll maybe I'll take more time in the and kind of rearrange some things here on the Fly or just give some more emphasis later but this perished world that emerged After the flood is a type of even the Earth after the Millennium it's not the new Heaven and new earth but there's a change that takes place well I I think we can we'll be able to bring it to a spot I think that'll satisfy uh well it'll satisfy in two ways it give you enough to kind of lean towards but then maybe enough for you to think okay all right I I want to get into my Bible a little bit I want to read the message a little bit find out where brother Aaron's going so you can get in all the questions before I preach this again now let's go back to Revelations CH 20: 6 Peter brother bram's talking about how this after the Millennium is a type of the CH the Noah coming in after the flood and I and I recognize what he's saying there and maybe uh it would be nice if he expounded more on it but when we look at the scripture the Bible says the Earth perished but yet it just emerged differently after the water and now there is going to be an earth that emerges in the Millennium and it says blessed and holy is he that hath part in the First Resurrection on such the second death hath no power but they shall be preached of God and of Christ and shall reign with him a thousand years now we just looked at this aspect of the Thousand-Year Reign but notice what is emphasized here on such the second death hath no power the second death has no power over the blessed and holy it has no power over those that Reign catch this this is very important I believe just to catch this he says blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection on such the second death hath no powers first resurrection is for a specific group of people prior to the Millennium right and it says that the second death has no power on them so it refers to a special class of people that will be doing the ruling and doing the reigning during the thousand years because it says they shall reign with him a thousand years they're not the ones being ruled not ones being reigned over they wouldn't represent any other class of people as the Bible says that the center of a 100 will be accursed it it's not referring to uh any other class of people that we might imagine could be there anyone that comes across through the out of tribulation or anyone that's raised up to be judged him we're talking about a special class of people over which the second death has no power brother Bram says now the next thing left is the translation of the church so question and answers the return of Moses and Elijah that's where we see the tribulation the Millennium Reign upon the Earth with the bride and groom for a thousand years and then the judgment bar and then a total annihilation of sin it'll never be no more at that time now there is if you can think of that there's everything's going to be dealt with ultimately completely gone but there will be a class of people over which death has no power and since death has no power over that class of people this is a description blessed and holy are they which take part in this first resurrection they're bypassing tribulation they're bypassing this destruction C and they're going to come back with Christ upon the Earth and they're going to reign with him a thousand years it's the people who have part in the first resurrection now we are we're new creatures in Christ Jesus right the Bible says I created a new Heaven and a new Earth former is passed away we could see that in type speaking of the Revelation 21 there's some that even placed that scripture saying that's referring to Revelation 17 excuse me Isaiah 6517 is referring to Revelation 21 and then the preceding verses refer to the Millennium I can see that but I can also see in the word of God that there's going to be something that happens to the Earth that renovates it and changes it for the Millennium before its complete total change and the description of the people that will rule and Reign Over which the second death has no power to me is very important the Bible says in second Corinthians 5:1 17 therefore If any man be in Christ not in the Millennium not in the eth day but if any man be in Christ he is a new creature so you're a new creation old things are passed away behold how many things old things are passed away behold all things are become new Bible says all things became new now if you want to take issue with that I would caution you against it because I know that we might say I believe I'm a new creature in Christ old things have passed away and all things have become new but there's still a lot of things that ain't new there's a lot of things that keep transpiring there's a lot of things that I could say are just the same old same old over and over again and we can make that point in a lot of ways but yet the Bible says you're a new creature the Bible says old things are passed away the Bible says all things have become new why because there's something represented in the transformation of your soul to say that's Redemption of the person connected with eternity beyond the the time the curtain of time and all things have become new it's because there's been a perishing of one thing a re regeneration of another we have been recreated all things are new even before this change right behold all things have become new it didn't mean that we got a glorified body when we were born again but yet there's a newness behold all things are become new now in Revelations 20: 10 to 15 I want to look at this on such a second death have no power the as you could see yourself what God has done to you all things are new there's going to be a newness to the Earth even the Millennium that you can relate to now as a Believer because we have been made new creatures old things are passed away all things have become new it says and the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone where the Beast and false prophet are and shall be tormented day and night forever and ever now this is that span of time and I saw a great white Throne this is what brother B keeps telling us there's a millennial Reign on the earth bride and Grom for a thousand years then judgment bar we've read Le in at least three places where brother Bam's setting that up as the next thing so we see this scripturally here in the scripture and I saw a great white throne in him that sat on it for whose from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away where' it go right you said oh it's gone it's no more it's just it's it's symbolic it's typing something and there was found no place for them and I saw the dead small and great stand before God and the books were open and another book was open which is The Book of Life and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books according to their works and the Sea gave up the dead which were in it and death and Hell delivered up the dead which were in them and they were judged every man according to their Works White Throne judgment this is the place that everyone else will stand but those who came up in the first resurrection and death and hell were cast into the Lake of Fire this is the second death and whosoever was not WR found written in the Book of Life was cast into the Lake of Fire now I just feel like I need need some help tonight if I could I hope you're get getting this picture in your mind now white Throne judgment there's a lot of people who are judged and they're going to be cast you it says devil and then that deceive them is cast in a lake of fire and brimstone and then death and hell are cast in the Lake of Fire death and Hell or cast in the Lake of Fire and whoever was not found written in the Book of Life is cast in the Lake of Fire so hell goes there death goes there and it says this is the second death so there is this Spectre of the second death that looms over everyone who didn't take part in the first resurrection blessed and holy is he that hath part in the First Resurrection on such the second death hath no power so if any man be in Christ he has eternal life and shall never come into judgment has passed already from death into life the second death this judgment has no power over you death has no power over you you do not even go into a place of hell you do not even go into a place of death you have completely bypassed death amen I want you to think of this what it means to be born again by the baptism of the Holy Ghost there is a second death that's coming and you who have the Blessed Holy Ghost now have no fear of death amen and one day death itself is going to be cast into the Lake of Fire it's such a paradox that's going to be the second death because that's when death death is completely gone and done away with there'll be no such thing as death amen the Bible says in 1 Corinthians 15:22 to 26 then come cometh the end when he shall have delivered up the kingdom of God even the father when he shall have put down all Rule and all authority and power for he must Reign till he hath put all enemies under his feet The Last Enemy that shall be destroyed is death now we could see clearly that The Last Enemy being destroyed the time that death is destroyed is in Revelations 20 right right and we can clearly see that death is going to be cast in Lake of Fire and death is going to be destroyed and The Last Enemy is going to be destroyed in this as scripture speaks of here the last enem to be destroyed is death but it says he must Reign until all enemies are put under his feet but where is his throne presently anybody want to answer here's your chance it's the heart of man it's in your heart there's his throne and there is where he reign s first and because he's reigning there first There Is No Death for you right there's death to this body we know but there's no death to the soul it cannot die but as he reigns in his bride it's going to come to a place where even in this very same chapter Paul's writing he says but one day mortality is going to be put on immortality one day death is going to be SW up in life in other words there's going to be a defeating of death in the bride today though there may be a time that death is cast in the Lake of Fire and death will be destroyed there is an advancement of the kingdom and the believer's life now that'll say death you can't even claim this body anymore I I know that there's a lot I just think the Holy Spirit can Quicken to you in this but this is the advancement of the Kingdom in your life now to where the death has already been defeated for you and that second Resurrection or the first resurrection death is already defeated it can't come and take you brother Brandon says in the sermon Shalom just a couple statements to close here there will be a millennium the old will be young there forever sickness will fade away and death will be no more they shall build houses they shall inhabit them they'll plant Vineyards and eat the fruit thereof they'll not plant and another inhabit his son take it his son will be living why him he will not plant and another eats die off and somebody else take it but he'll live here there is a people in the Millennium who will not die that's right they can't die have glorified bodies this is the bride's honeymoon it's her rest he says and the wolf and the lamb shall feed together the lion shall eat straw like the bulock and child shall lead them around there will be innocence there'll be nothing could hurt we'll be changed from what we are now to that glorious image of the Son of God which is Immortal years can never touch him age can never do anything to him he's the immortal Son of God so we know I hope I'm not going too fast so we know that we're at the end time we're at the junction all these things thoroughly identified so will it be identified again that's what caught my attention there's things that are being thoroughly identified now that'll be identified again there's things that we are be being thoroughly identified now that speak of this innocence to come on Millennium and there's things that will be identified in the Millennium that speak of the Innocence that'll be forever he says all things thoroughly identified so it will be identified again and he describes this incredible time time upon the Earth where I guess I said calling it a millennium is just a really good way to describe it to Bible readers right when I say a millennium we think of certain things and that should just strike us yes it's going to be a millennium it's going to be wonderful yes and all of this before the Earth takes its last change right all this before that final baptism of fire that renders it a fit place to live right for all eternity if that's so then I believe that we shouldn't make any excuses now amen for how we should not make excuses for not letting the Holy Ghost have preeminence right in our lives now if our musicians would come let me close on this statement the future home he says there you are there is the paradise of God the light of the world the perfect Kingdom not the seventh day the eternal etal one not the Millennium the new Earth and I'll just let this statement marinate for a while while it's going through the Millennium it's going through its sanctifying process but still must be burned right while the Millennium is being described as a sanctifying process who is on Earth at that time who is doing the ruling who is doing the reigning Christ and his bride on Earth Millennium and it becomes the Earth sanctifying process where the bride who has become one with the word is ruling and reigning upon the Earth even with sin still existing right even with the Spectre of future Wars even with the a future rebellion and a future Annihilation and judgment even with all that happening there's going to be a bride upon the Earth and glorified bodies in a perfect harmony with the Lord Jesus Christ and it's going to be called the Earth sanctifying process oh Hallelujah I'm so glad to know that the Holy Ghost ruling and re in my heart right now is still bringing my mind through a sanctifying process and that there still is a work of the Holy Ghost to do in my life right now and bringing my thoughts into his thoughts you say oh brother Aaron are we in the Millennium well no no we're not in the Millennium but right now the Holy Ghost Wants to Rule just like it's going to do for you in the Millennium so there's Millennium preparation even the Millennium itself is a preparation it's a fulfillment it's a preparation and next time we'll like to get into it a little bit more out of the seals and this purifying of the earth just so we can place it in the scripture place it in the message of the hour that this purifying of the earth that takes place to produce a time of the Millennium is a type of what the Holy Spirit the pillar fire is doing in us right now is that not what he's doing for us couldn't you believe that for yourself this holy ghost that you have you realize man I became a new creature all things became new and I've had battles I've had struggles I've had good times I've had bad times I've had my I've had my doubts I've had my I've had this happen and I've I've lost my temper I've done this and you realize we look back for decades now even and we see this trajectory and I realize Oh Lord You're wanting to do in me what you're going to to do for a thousand years on Earth bring into subjection all things unkind all things Unholy so brother Aon does that mean we have to live sinless Perfection no but would you want would you want to sin would you want to be imperfect I believe that we can in our hearts just yield to him say Lord I I want to come to you I want to seek you with my whole heart I don't want to stay stay the same I don't I don't want to ever say to God well God you just need to be happy with the way I do things I want to know that I have a heart that can change and yield to him in All Things Millennium preparation not just for the Earth but for you let's Avail ourselves to God's process I know there could be some uh negative slights sometimes on teaching or slights on training but you know brother brandham taught us that God trains his people he equips them we are in a training process now and say Lord just te keep teaching me Lord keep teaching me thank you for your time tonight just your attention your amens it's just wonderful to minister the word of God to you you could stand with me now
