TRANSCRIPT
========================================
place is quite Hot For Me so I was just you know so many things ringing so many things you can preach but you have to go back to the channel of God and let God have his way with his people but you can begin to look at something here and in fact I had never preached about this not even in my home Church but God just directs me to this and I'm titling it dying the death and having the end of the righteous man so there is a death that a righteous man has to die and there is an end that he must have and brother Branham comes here in any one quote honestly contending for the faith he says and today you do it they will laugh at you they got a form of godliness but denying the power of brother I don't want to be a Bellum but I say like Balaam when he came back and he seen what God had done to that bunch of holy Lawless he said let me die the death of the righteous and let my last end be like his amen I said the same thing call me a hori Laura if you want to but let me die the death of the righteous let my last end be as God is blessings as he blessed Jacob Hallelujah this is the prophet he says he doesn't want to be a balam but he's saying said he says I want what that statement let me die the death of a righteous man and let my last end be like his now what is the death of the writers a righteous doesn't die we don't die the Bible says it I believeth the word Jesus said I shall never die but has already passed from death and life so what is this death of a righteous man and what is this death that brother Brahma says I want that death I want that end for a small blessed now maybe I'll break it into maybe pick a part this evening and we shall complete tomorrow but I want us to look at how that there is a death that you must die as a righteous man and there is an end you must come to we don't just have to end like everybody else's ending now that we have to die like everybody else is dying and we have to take a type up with that thought that David is saying did abuna had to die like a fool abuna was the righteous man the Bible says you know Solomon is declaring him to be righteous when he was avenging the death of abuna by commanding binaya to go and kill job when job was holding on the altar on the horns and he says he killed abunda a man more righteous than him so abuna was a royalist man but how could he die like a fool this is the concern of David he says I know we can die we may die but how do you die should you die like a full dice so David is crying and his main how could abuna permit himself to die like a fool you are supposed to die the righteous death but now you are dying like a fool blessed be the name of the Lord and David knows you see abuna was a captain of soul and you know when the soul died he had maintained the kingship of Soul by installing his son is and there was a longer war between job the captain of David or the command of David's forces and abuna who was supporting the son of a soul so there was a long bitter battle if you read the Bible you'll find that killed amasa not because he wanted and amasa was the brother of joab but because amasa was very fast in running and the Bible says he was fast of feet like a wild row and in running after abuna he never turned to the right or the left and our Buddha spoke to him and said you turn aside get a hold of somebody else kill somebody take his armor leave me why should I kill you I don't want to kill you he said if I kill you how will I face your brother chew up I don't want to plant that seed of bitterness between me and your brother but you see abuna I mean a master still followed he spoke to him like three times saying don't follow me because he didn't want to kill him but I must have persisted until abuna killed him and time comes after The Bitter war between the two segments of Israel that abuna decides that this is time to reconcile all Israel back to be under the kingdom of David because David was anointed David is the man that God has made to be the king so he goes to talk to King David and during that time job has gone to fight so when they make their final deal with David descends him away he even gave him he made him a feast he came with about 20 soldiers and he went away in a piece but now job comes back and hears that a Buddha has been here and the King has sent him away and abuna knows the bitterness that job has got against him he knows that job is no friend of his he's not fan of his at the slightest opportunity he would kill him but he agrees to come back and not only does he come back but joab calls him to a private talk and he's a commander like your abuse if it is Major generous they are both major generals if they are I'm a commanders all of them are I'm a commanders they all have a bodyguards so David is asking a one million dollar question how could a commander of an army die like a fool in the hands of his enemy why didn't he say okay so you have your bodyguards I also have mine you have your weapons standing there let me stand here let's talk why could he accept to be pulled aside By Hand by such an enemy and then he stabs him to death so the question is why did abuna accept to die like a fool and that's the question that I'm looking at today because there are very many people who are supposed to die as fools but not the righteous ones blessed be the name of the Lord the righteous ones are not supposed to die as fools because when you come here I want to just ask to broaden our thinking here on this when you come in a book of Psalms chapter 14 verse 1 he says if the fool has a said in his heart there is no good that's what a fool says there is no God and that's how foolishness begin there is no God in his church I don't feel the prince of the Lord in his church there is no Holy Spirit here I don't feel my pastor I don't feel this man is a man of God I I don't have something like connected to now we are not in an age where you want to feel God from the church God is not no longer God for you in a church or in a in a group of people but God is now to be felt by you because you are the final tab Anaconda God has to Tabernacle himself in so you are now dying as a fool you know leaving the world like people are saying there's no power in the message there's no anointing anymore something's wrong somewhere something's wrong with you because brother Brown preaches the message he preaches the message and he believes does not hinder God so we are now in the time that God Tabernacle in a man cannot be hindered by the unbelief of another person as long as that God is in you and you have that faith and you have that connection and you feel him then that God cannot be hindered by anybody by any belief not even this church can hinder God not even the other sister the other brother because the final Destiny of the book God made sure they never cannot pray tricks with it take the book eat it up and digest it so the final Destiny of the book is now you the word in you so now foolishness Begin by saying ah there is no God I don't feel the princess of the Lord the church is just dry so who is the judge there's something wrong here then put it right because you are a Believer and all of things are possible to them that believe glory be to God so the devil begins to bring foolishness and the foolishness is there is no God there's no God there's no God in this man there's no God in this human there's no God in this church there's no God here and where is he where is he supposed to be supposed to be new so I look why are you looking for him in other people God is now to be in you and you should be contented that he's with you in you and you should feel his presence but now the devil you see the brother brother preaches three summons he preached and one of somebody says in his presence another sermon the unrecognized the presence of the Living God another sermon a man running away from the prince of the Lord so you can have the prince of the Lord but you have not even recognized it or you are even running away from the parents of the road thinking that there's no presence of the Lord that's why we are now in the dispensation of the third pool and what happens in the dispensation of the third pool show me one manifestation with the sorry pool where brother brother manifested it on develop it right the creation of the squirrels in the wilderness when he was himself with God bringing back the daddy fish just outside there speak English Toms just there in the bush speaking of the Tomb out of his wife just there alone in his house praying not only Pulpit not in the church in a group of people but speaking of his sister had your student to be redeemed not in the church not on the palpit but God Tabernacle in Iman that's where we have to be now that is the maturity you don't even need a group you don't even need a people a big bunch you don't need even to have people who are spiritual around you you need the the presence of God himself in you God in you Christ in you the hope of glory that's what you need but now the devil is trying to bring us back to think as fools and talk as fools judging your destiny by the company so there is no God that's what a fool says and he says in his heart he begins to think about it and then he speaks it that's how a fool dies begins to say there is no God I think there is no more truth I think the anointing went with brother Branham I think I I am I'm just I should resign to fit I will come to that God waiting tomorrow let me resign to Faith and just die die as a fool die in the hands of your enemy when you are armed when you are trained when you are full of matter full of Power full of anointing and a word that you have had only someone is all these years where is it why should we surrender to the devil and sometimes the devil brings us to feel like we are now orphans because Brothers the sin we have now more of God since he left because we have had the message you preached more and more many years but just failing to recognize who you are what you are supposed to do and how because the prophet says when you've got the Holy Ghost you've got faith the only problem that you now have is just how to operate that faith you don't need a great big faith that faith that he has put in you is the faith of God it's not even your faith so you don't have to eat intellectually understand how it should work I've prayed for people with different things but one thing that I always know that God you know does is that I completely ignore don't even look at the condition of the person I'm praying for I don't even think about the the severity of the case because I know the logos that spoke the world into existence in the beginning was the word it's the same word now in US same word amen but we need the same faith just to speak it and now that's what I was preaching in Lima that you see we have to move from the invisible God to the visible incarnate one Jesus is telling the disciples says you believe in God believe also in me it's very easy it has been very easy for you all these thousands of years to believe in the visible God with whom you are relating through the prophets and sacrifices and offerings and so forth but now time has come that is God is here he's working here he's got internet he's Emmanuel he's here and you are not you know use that same Faith to believe in a visible God now we are not even in the dispensation of the disciples when God was with us but we are now in the dispensation of the Bride when God is in US so time has come that you have to believe in the god that is in you and that's why he says time comes he says you will not pray but you'll speak so we have to come to that level of faith so but the danger that we have is dying as fools when we are not fools do you have to die as a fool Point number one a fool has said in his heart there is no God um and then pointy number two I want to just show you some more scriptures here Luke chapter 24. let's look at another type of foolishness that is killing us Luke chapter 24 from verse 25 this was the resurrection maybe you you you can now come to this point where you can look from verse 21 these people are using the word but we trusted that it had been he we should have redeemed Israel we trusted we trusted in other words we are no longer trusting we have backseated from the trust we have lost the faith that we believe that this man should have been he that should have redeemed Israel but now he died and I think you can assist that kind of picture today within the message fraternity we trusted I put all my life into this message I preached it 30 years I preached it so many years but now have come to a time that I no longer adapt things we trusted no longer trust we preached no longer preached we believed no longer believe it um and then he says they are trying to tell Jesus himself he's walking with him and then in verse 23 says yeah and certain women also of our company made us astonished which were Ali A disparator and when they found out his body they came saying that they are also seen a vision of angels which said that he was alive yet he had told them I'll rise up again but now they are not willing to believe the positive part they're swallowed up in the negative the way he died how he was beaten how he suffered how he even cried and how he was buried they are looking at that they are forgetting the positive that was promised a poor package for this the positive was that after death I will rise up again glory be to God now yeah he says and Saturn of them that is verse 24 which were with us went to this suppose and found it even us even so as the women had said but him they saw not now listen to this then he said unto them all fools these are believers they had believed him they had left everything for him now they are beginning to think they made a bad deal and that's why Jesus is following them they were trying to go back and connect the lines with their relatives we therefore my business friends we have realized that we have been built we are going nowhere and Jesus how does he begin he begins by identifying them exactly what they had now become and he says unto them all fools and slow heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken go back to the word the word never fails but you have magnified the situation and you have you know you have really dipped yourself into the pit of Sorrow and you've forgotten what the word he says fools slob heart to believe what a prophet has said the prophets have spoken these things but now you are acting foolishly you are wanting to Die the death of fools how do they end by turning around against what they believed and doubting what they believed and losing trust in what they once trusted and beginning to question what they didn't question so there is now the death he says you fools I mean it's not easy these days to tell a person directing the face that you're a fool especially when they are intellectuals like you Americans they'll I gave you to understand I want to give you a piece of my mind I have this I know this I you know but this is the foolishness not the intellect we are talking about it's the foolishness of doubting what you once believed of stopping the Fulfillment of what you are cherishing blessed be the name of the Lord and he says all fools and slow word to believe all not some not a person all other prophets have spoken oh it's not Christ to have suffered the things and to enter into his glory that is the end Christ was to suffer and enter into his glory and that's why Paul says I've fought a good fight I've kept my cause I've remained within the tracks I've not you know be been you know antagonistic looking for whom to fight or focusing on who is fighting me but I'm looking at my course the one that God gave me I'm looking at the line that I'm supposed to follow I have to run this rest and I know the course the track that have been achieving it's my rest I don't care who is antagonistic who wants to throw his leg on me on so forth who is speaking negative about me who accepts ax you know acknowledges me to be a believer or not approval I'm looking at the one who calling me so Paul says I've kept the faith he doesn't say I've come to the church I've kept the friends I've kept my comrades I've kept this that and that I've kept preaching within the confines of those like my fellow preachers preach so we are in in sync I keep comparing my notes with their notes oh I have kept the faith the faith of Jesus Christ why did he keep the faith how did he succeed in doing that because he died he said he's still 20 I am crucified with Christ nevertheless I Live Now the life that I'm living is not me living Jesus who lives in me so what is the death of a righteous man you die so that Christ lives that's the death of a righteous man you die to your thinking to your reasoning to your understanding to your aspirations to your desires to your feelings you die to the surrounding you die to the spirit of the nation you died in the spirit of the area you live by the spirit of Christ and by the word that's the death of a righteous man but the death of a fool begins to die to kill that weak he once knew so Parliament painted his goals because he had the death of a righteous man a righteous man Abraham Abraham believed in God and it was imputed unto him for righteousness so Abraham believed in God God is the word so when you believe in the word what happens the more of the word you receive the bless of you you become and the more of the word you disappear as he appears until the fullness of him is manifested that's the death you die you disappear you should always the prophet said be conscious of the how little you become every other day and how big he is because the bigger he becomes in you the the more Victorious you are but the more you are still around the more the failures because you keep relying on your thinking and looking at situations but now when you are above there that's why John the type of the Bride after the message the Civil changes was invited to come up here come up here and start looking at the things the way I look at them put on my own goggles see the way I see look at the situations the way I see them arguments questions foolishness he he revealed he didn't reveal this was open this was not open come up here see the way I see it it's not it's broken but it's not broken yes that's true that's why brother brother he's preaching to two groups that's why whenever you come to the salmon you would say Do you believe me to be God is Prophet I I mean God's servant why did he say that two groups not all of them would be comfortable for him being a prophet so he was a prophet to a generation so he would address himself as a prophet to the few and as a servant to others so those who are in the public Gallery would look at him as a servant and those who are in the private room they classified people for a classified message they will take him as a prophet that's why he always introduced you believe me to be God is Prophet I mean his servant and that's why he says it's broke but it's not broken to the public yes that's the truth the 70 series is not broken Republic but it is revealing it is revealed and I mean it he cannot explain it because once he explains it then that's the end of faith so where is the natural element going to work glory be to God so now he comes here he's rebuking this second state Jesus himself saying oh fools he's the only disciples so that doesn't what does that mean you can be a good believer but foolishness doesn't respect that you begin to doubt to question what you really believe and that's the most dangerous unbelief the unbelief of the believer now the most dangerous people we have to deal with in the end time and not denominations and not the Pentecostals are not even Catholics and so forth it is those backseatings from the message so hot why are you slow curious to observing using your mind to try to navigate yourself around it does it make sense it doesn't make sense but in the language of Faith it's very sensible blessed be the name of the Lord in this our minds it doesn't make sense even they believe in yourself that you even exist if you question yourself a thousand times who am I how did I come here am I really a human being am I really what I am you'll end up being a fool and stupid you you can't even think about how he created this the stars and all all this person you know your mind stops blessed be the name of the Lord so why shouldn't you die the righteous man is death why should you die the Fool's death because these are the the things that the food the death of a fool is what's going on now and David is crying why would abuna die like a fool your hands were not tied your mouth was not closed your feet were not tied in a fetus you were standing walking seeing with your hands able to pick your sword and fight Glory oh God why would you fall into these cheap tricks of the devil you have your ears that can listen to the message that can study the message that you can read the Bible you have needs that you can go and kneel and pray on the seek God you are God is there for you you can seek another video you don't have to seek God through another person depend through another person God is your father why are you fearing to speak to God why are you fearing to seek God why are you trying to buy ideas of men what what is you that's why Jesus said tell me whom do you say I am don't tell me what others are saying about me tell me what is your personal revelation whom do you say I am okay and then we have this study level of foolishness when you come here in Galatians chapter 3 in verse 1 he says oh foolish Galatians this is Paul foolish Galatians who has Bewitched you that you should not obey the truth so the problem now was obeying the truth they knew the truth but obeyed was now the problem and because they failed to obey it they started backsliding just like when you're riding a bicycle you're only you know able to balance and go when you're moving but when you stop you have to fall down all foolish Galatians who has Bewitched to you that you should not obey the truth before whose eyes Jesus Christ has been evidently set forth crucified among you and he comes down and says this only would I know none of you receive ye the speed receive Thee the Spirit by The Works of the law or by the hearing of Faith are you so foolish having begun in the spirit and now being made perfect by the flesh have you suffered so many things in vain if it yet be in vain you suffer so many years you live by so many years you cherish the message and you begin to doubt it at the time of the rapture thank you what should the devil hinder you from your victory what is your end supposed to be the end of a defeated or the end of a Victor blessed be the name of the Lord maybe this is not a good someone for the first time preaching him blessed be the name of the Lord now look at that your hands definitely saying thy hands were not died and the prophet the Bible says God speaks to the mouth and fulfills with the hand and you are both in the mouth and in the hand because if you only spews you out of his mouth when you become lukewarm [Laughter] but when you are ready hold Christian you remain in the mouth of God in other words whatever God spoke the word of God you were part of the mouth that's pocket yes and then also you are part of the hand that fulfills it because the Bible says I've engraved your names in the palms of my hands so the speaking of it and the fulfilling of it you are part of it you can't deny it you can't change around so your hands are not tied God has not tied the hands of the church and that's why Jesus said the works that I do shall you do also I was talking to one brother the other day I said brother Abraham how is it that good as you can use you like that it becomes you know very special in the message I said who say that Miracles and Son wonders are special when the day becomes special to Christianity who said he praying for a lemon walk is special or a blind man to see or a cancer who say that is special by the way we don't have it in our language as a miracle because God raising them a lemon man is not a miracle in his language there's no miracle in his vocabulary that's what he does it's a miracle to the world not to a believer it's a miracle a miracle mean it's like something that you didn't expect something that is out of the ordinary sect you know it is it's outlandish but it's opening of the eyes outlandish is it a miracle to me it's not a miracle Jesus did it the disciples did it brother Branham was doing it and here we are prophesying again in this day but now the devil wants to make it like something conspicuous and whoever is doing his conspicuous and he wants to become a big man out of it because he's able to do it you are nothing is a gift it's God in you doing it so when did it become you so he says why should we suffer all these things and then end up failing why should we live below our privileges to God has you know measure and given us he says did you receive the spirit and then he comes here are you so foolish that you began in a spirit and now you are being made perfect in the flesh and you have suffered so many things like in vain blessed be the name of the Lord can we suffer all these things all these years no I must make it and that's why brother Branham says let my end be the end of the righteous man yes brother ended when he was rejected by the world rejected by friends Almost by himself but he said I thank God he stood with me he had not diminished in anointing he only diminished in it for him but are we here for him no we are not even looking for friends and have not come to Phoenix to look for friends if you are one of the attributes you'll be my friend whether you want it or not because it's the time that the attributes are fellowshipping together they are looking for one another so it's a fellowship of the attributes not the fellowship of just human beings so many beings will give you the right hand of followers you say God bless you brother God bless you Sister God bless you God bless you God bless you but down in the house they're not even with you so I love you I love you but it doesn't even love you that's the Fellowship of the right hand leave your right hand of fell as your brother oh oh you have started the church we are praying for you brother we love you God bless you hey we give you the right hand of Fellowship but the heart is saying I wish it even collapses tomorrow that's why even the mark of the beast is also in the hand and the forehead the right hand we are all breathing we are all Christians we all believe Christ we part one another on the shoulders as we should wish one another well we wish you success but not from the heart so don't even look for friends don't even fret and be you know like sorrowful because you don't have friends as long as you are with the what as long as he is with you as long as he's in you the right friends will come blessed be the name of the Lord so what are we looking at your hands were not tied and you die like a fool your mouth is not shut you have a mouth that can speak that can pray that can speak the word and it comes to pass you have a heart that believes the holy spirit is still there why do you die like a fool blessed be the name of the Lord so the prophet continues here to say something he says now we are finite we can say this is right today and tomorrow we can find something different we can be better we can become better we got a better we we build better houses than we did a hundred years ago we got better cars than we had 200 years ago we got better transportation whatever more you want to go into we are better because we are learning so human beings can be even able they are designed to make themselves better what about when God joins the friend when God comes in transformation takes place I want us to go back to here in the Bible I'm trying to read something in the scriptures here for us when you come here in the book of Second Kings second Kings chapter seven I hope my English my accent is you're picking it [Laughter] I'm not a Landy person so anniversary he says and there were four Holy Cross men at the entering of the gate and they said one to the other why City we hear until we die in other words we die as fools we have to do something about this and this was the most rejected outcasts of society at that time they were not among the elite they were really rejects of society but God is putting into them a mystery that is going to serve so many people and they are saying why should we sit here until we die if we say we will enter into the city then the farming is in the city what was the city they had come out of the city so now put on your spiritual eyes what was the city was the world we came out of the world because there was farming in the city that's why we came out of the city looking for something to survive outside but now outside also in the wilderness so to speak out of Egypt we came to the wilderness but we are not supposed to survive in the wilderness we have to survive in the promised land but in the promised land there is an enemy there are enemies there so we can't go back to the city because there is farming in the city and death in the city if we sit here we are also going to die but the food is where the enemy is if we want to live the food is where the enemies are that's where God has put the food you hold the finger and we go to here in the book in the New Testament in the book of Hebrews and I want you to look at this as we compare scriptures Hebrews chapter 10 verse 18 He says now they just shall live by faith not by sight not by circumstance not by condition not my surrounding not by experience where what we experienced backer there if we go back and use our experience no so he says but if any man brought back that is go back into the city my soul shall have no pleasure in him this is Paul writing if you go backwards no pleasure because we are not designed to go backwards there is only person go forward so you better tell yourself that I'm designed not to go backwards I have no life no future backer there I have no inheritance backer there I have no peace backer there in the world that I come from no they just shall live by faith what is faith faith is believing in the word of God and you die so you die the death of Faith the death of a righteous person and when you are willing to Die the death of a righteous person that you are not fearing your enemy then you die and when you die he that is in you is the one who says I am now who's the one who is going to fight your battles the battle is the Lord is not yours so it as long as you are alive you will see the enemy as yours my enemies are many the enemies are many the castles are many the failures are many the diseases are many have inherited my mother's disease the disease that killed my father this is the 70 minutes trying to kill me you look and see because there will be your enemies but when you die the death of a righteous man and you have died to yourself to your thinking your reasoning then is Christ Living in you you live by that faith when you accept to die so this the select Paras men were willing to die but they didn't die because they were willing to die but those who were not willing to die died because no because they were not willing to die but those who are willing to go to the enemies place and die they didn't die because when they died by faith to their own feelings God started fighting for them so you should be willing to die to you because you are food is in the enemy's territory it's not elsewhere else it's not in another place I want us to catch that revelation you are food is in the land where the enemy is and I can prove to you that by the scripture you come in any verse that he says but we are not of them who draw back unto partition so going back to the city is death stay where we are Wilderness death yeah the only solution is going to the land of promise but in the land of promise they are Americans they are Gaga sites they are jebusites they are Philistines they are always being you know demon is an enemy forces ready and then the prophet says even if the land is promised to you you have to fight for every inch of it that's where your food is not here you want to stay here you are going to die you have to stay where the enemy is not you are going to die because the enemy is not here but there's no so no food here where the enemy is not there's no food where the enemy is there is food so where are you going back to the denominations no we left because there is hunger there almost 8 verse 11 there is famine that's why we left that's why we came to this message now we are like in the wilderness is the Judgment seat who is to be judged and where is the judgments in the house of God you are ready to be judged and that's why you say Amen to the word even when it's hitting you amen doesn't mean it it's wonderful it's good how many minutes is the truth so whether it is hurting you piercing you cutting you but you are saying amen I accept that judgment I take the verdict I am wrong this man must die that's why we come here so that he dies completely he's condemned blessed be the name of the Lord I wish I could invite brother Aaron to start preaching from there I'm not a good one now the glory be to God now I want us to look at something which is hidden here in the scripture which was prophetic concerning the land of promise when you come to the Book of Numbers Chapter 14. when they brought a report about the promised land the report was and the enemy magnifying the report enemy praising report and every time the devil wants he rejoices when you talk about the devil is doing this the devil is doing this the devil is doing this the devil the devil Satan Satan Satan the Devil the devil the devil the devil what about Jesus and those who are failing are the ones who have gone there they are failing those who have never gone there can you imagine those who went there the prophet said those are preachers they went and got the evidence and tested the word they got the Revelation they got this they thought they even carried the evidence they proved that the land is good but we were like grasshoppers they reduced themselves to have Grasshoppers and you know what grasshoppers means Wanderers unto death grasshoppers have no territory they are born to move to eat in order to grow old and die while they are moving and that's because they call themselves grasshoppers grasshoppers they became they wandered in the wilderness 40 years until they died I'm feeling well wow the moment you begin to accept a Doctrine a statement a saying a habit a life that praises the devil that magnifies the enemy and belittles he that is in you you are finished you become a grasshopper you have hope from grass to grass from meeting to meeting from convention to Convention preacher to preacher Church to church very good and you'll never be satisfied until you die you'll never possess that which is yours but you eat that which you find so now we see in the chapter 14 number Chapter 14 verse 1 and all the congregations of their voices and cried and the people wept that night um and all the children of Israel my mother against Moses that's what they do when people fail to go and possess the land they begin to Mama again there's the prophet he didn't teach it well he didn't preach it well he didn't okay I'm just trying to bring it slowly so that we understand Moses and against Aaron that is the pastor now any Pastor who preaches the truth you had a problem yeah you know what they are saying who God we wish we wish God we die in the land of we had died in the land of Egypt oh to God we died in this Wilderness they cast themselves we are fearing the land of the enemy but that's their land of promise and they expected the god to first of all kill all the enemies there before they go no no the land that floweth with milk and honey yes but it's full of giants who want to kill you are you ready to die the death of a righteous man or die as a fool sit here either until we die do you know these days we are living in the days of idleness even to lift up your hand is a problem you are too tired even to kneel in the church here on seek God come and seek God praying and fasting as an individual seeking God no so I do as if the devil is not there anymore as if Satan is taking a leave you come to church here friends let me speak to you personally you come in church the song only that opens the service for you by praying then maybe a deacon or some brother Minister comes and prays for the prayer requests and then they pray for the offerings and tithesis and then the preacher comes and prays and preaches and after he has preached he prays and then there's somebody that comes and dismisses you what have you done I do and it is called a House of Prayer okay who prayed everything that has to be done in the church the devil wants us to feel like they should do it for us all the prayers that are prayed here they pray for us it's like a spirit of Catholicism coming upon us Mary Mother of God pray for us sinners for us we can't pray because we can't connect with Mr God you come in the church you leave the church doors there you go you've not spoken to your god no all the prayers that they prayed somebody else prayed for you so what are you doing I know you reach home you eat maybe you say a few hours before your meal and after eating feeling sleepy you go and sleep no family altar not studying in the Bible nor listening to the message not holding your children together reading with them the Bible praying together who is going to pray for your family better than you who will pray for your husband better than you could pray for your wife better than you who will pray for your children he'll claim them and we send all these words that WhatsApp groups pray for so and so pray for sister so pray for what about you Idol you want others to pray for you something's wrong somewhere we must wake up we can't see the idol when death is around us it's killing people people are dying so and so you knew whom he was your brother your neighbor your sister whom you started you believed the message with is now dead he's in the world has left the message can't you know that something serious is going on you ate a press into who you are dead you rather die the death of a righteous man or you are going to die as a fool and when you die the death of a righteous you leave because your righteous shall live by faith they just shall live by faith faith in the word so when this fall lepers were willing to go and die rather than die where there is food rather than die where there is no food they didn't die now let's look at what the Bible is saying let's go down here in chapter 14 of the Book of Numbers now listen and the children of Israel Mama against Moses and are gone against Aaron and the whole congregation said unto them that we had died in the land of Egypt oh to God we had died in this wilderness wherefore has the Lord brought us up into this land to Fall by the squad that our wives and our children should be pray weighed not better for us to return into Egypt go back to the city but why did you come out the the leper said if we go back we shall die because there is family there if we stay here type of the Wilderness we shall die but if we go where the enemies where everybody is scared where are we also we're scared up to now but we now have no option but to believe that going to the enemy we are going to survive and we are going not to fight but God is going to fight not me but he that is in me now listen at this revelation verse 6 quickly just to speak at him and Joshua that's the type of the Holy Spirit the son of noon and Caleb the type of the believer the bride today the son of Jeffrey which of them that search the land rent their clothes now listen and they spoke and all the compatible with the children of Israel saying they land which we pass through to search it is an exceedingly good land good land but full of the enemies now listen to this in verse 8. 9 if the Lord Delight in us then he will bring us up into the land and give it to us a land which floweth with milk and honey verse 9 only Rebellion you not against the Lord neither fear ye the people of the land listen now for they are bred for us oh so the enemies where the enemy is that's your food prophetically Spoken Here the lepers are picking that and saying where the enemies that is my foot if I don't tackle the enemy I'll die I'll die of hunger fighting the enemy possessing the enemy's land is my foot that's where God has put my food but which you fear is where your spiritual strength is that's where you are going to derive your strength your that's your food we are the enemies but the devil doesn't want you to go we are the enemies he wants to sow a seed of fear in you so that you die the death of a fool who doesn't trust any God who doesn't believe that God is with me a fool has said in his heart there is no God I don't feel good I think I have to feel I think I have not got enough experience I can't tackle this I as a foolishness so what are you doing about it if you think you don't have the Holy Spirit what have you done the Bible says pray the Bible says seek ask God that is a promise the promises unto you and to your children and as men as the Lord Our God shall call so if the Lord has called you why don't you say Lord I need my Holy Spirit what have you done about it I don't and you want to die the death of a fool sitting here you die going back in the world you die going where your possession is even when the enemy is there you are going to leave because your enemies your food this is what the prophecy is saying those people in the land the enemies who are holding us from the promises are our food our bread that disease plaguing you that cancer is the food because it's a it's the raw material for a testimony how are you going to get a testimony without a test how are you going to say the Lord healing me if you were not sick now when you begin to get scared of your okay he has already gotten you what are you going to do sit there and surrender to fit and die or do something about it you go right where the enemy is there attack of the enemy possess the land that's your promise and say this is mine give it this is mine this belongs to me if it's Deliverance is mine now you know faith is not just knowing that God is able God is going to do it as long as you say God is going to do it you are a Friend of the Devil because that anything in the in the future you are really siding with the Enemy you shouldn't even claim your promises and put them tomorrow today because if you say God will heal me next year or next month or next whatever you have already excluded yourself from the manifestation of it because one day with the Lord is a thousand years so if you put yourself in the next day then you will die before you receive the blessing huh why do we sit there idle doing nothing when we can do something about a situation why should you surrender to Fair Transit away when their obvious options provided in the word laying right before you so they decided to Die the death of believers who can possess the Gate of their enemies by faith because that was that was what was promised to Abraham rather die fighting the enemy than die the death of unbelief but how do I die fighting the enemy I don't die I have a guarantee that I don't die I only die to the flesh and not all of us are even going to die physically some of us the Rapture is going to find us alive so you don't have even to die physically but you have to die to yourself to your feelings and you are reasoning and understanding of the word and then you say Lord I surrender to you as a younger woman as a young girl as a younger boy I cannot survive in this age with my own thinking I have to die to myself I cannot even understand this message by my brains God cannot be understood by your mind you have to die to your mind and let the mind of Christ come into you [Music] blessed be the name of the Lord this is what I'm wanting to understand friends what you are fearing is your food so when you fear it you'll starve to death but God has put your position I mean your possession where your fear is that's why job said the thing that I greatly feared is what has come to me don't even sit there and begin to imagine a certain disease that you fear that's what will come to you and then when it comes it's like I'm finished I I can't do nothing about it this is you came here finished this is becoming but how many people have we prayed for who had become you came here given six months three months four months to die and they are living 10 20 years down the road glory be to God just think about it so the prophet says he says he wasn't just to go around and say well he told me that yes I believe it he did something about it oh brother sister do you see what I mean he just he didn't just sit there and say said so he done something about it if you want to get saved this morning God promised salvation then do something about it don't just sit there don't Join one church and take your letter from church to church he promised salvation and deliverance if you are sick why sit there as the leper say that day when the city was besieged why City we here until we we die he says when Samaria was beseeched by the syrians they said why sit here till we die we will always be here we will die right here if we go in the city we they are dying in the city there from starvation let's go down to the Campbell the enemy and then they Prophet say oh my what what a faith they should have had going to where the enemies to eat [Laughter] you are going there looking for food that means they had the faith that they were going to eat otherwise they would have gone their faith was not looking for death their faith was to look for food so they went you cannot eat when you are dead they had a revelation that when we got there we are going to find food we are going to eat so in other words they had the inner part telling them you're not going to die although be ready for death not to die be ready to die to your thinking not to die but if you are not ready to die then you'll die yeah glory be to the name of the Lord so he says what a faith they could have what they got Camp of the enemy who was trying to kill them trying to kill them that's why the Assyrians were there and the devil is trying to kill us this is what you I want you to notice that everywhere else there is death everything else has died every denomination is dead that's why there is now death surrounding this message because this only this is the only place where there is still life life is just in this world you know that's why you see every bag every demon every spirit is attacking the message because everywhere else death has finished so he says they go to they come of the enemy that I was trying to kill them but I said if we die we are going to die anyhow and they went down there and God honored that little speck of doing a faith that little faith that they had and not only delivered themselves but delivered all Israel what we need today is men and women who can take God by his word and be persistent with it God will cause the earthquakes and the shakes to go down to the camp fast that's what the prophet says when the weakest believer goes on her knees not the strongest one you think those lepers were strong they were sick they were lepers to begin with they were very weak could even started to fight maybe the fingers were cut off they had nothing physically to show off they didn't have any ability to even start with the standard Just Two Soldiers so they went completely not trusting in their abilities they were incapacitated physically but as when God comes into action when all help is gone God will cause the earthquakes and the sheikhs to go down the camp fast God will take care whether there is going to be rain up there or not and that's what God did before they stepped there God stepped there and the syrians fled the enemy went the demons went and the food remained the food remained they ate and they even told others come and eat here's the food glory be to God so he continues here and says but you but do you believe with all your heart and ready now like those men who laid and they get down there at Samaria say why is it here till we die you are going to die lying there you've got only one chance that is to accept him while you are in his princess you recognize the princess of the Lord as an individual you are in his presence and he is in you he in you create the princess now listen and believe it with all your heart the prophet says will you do that believe it will hold with your heart the biggest problem that we have is to believe what we claim to believe you know a lot of brothers have been ringing me and asking me rather how do these things happen oh hey what a special thing are you going I mean they feel like God coming down to prove his word is a new phenomenon I was even you know surprised when one Pastor was ringing me say I no longer believe in the spiritual brother I said if you don't believe in the Supernatural you don't even believe in God because God is Supernatural yeah and even the Rapture will be Supernatural so that means you're not going the rupture how is your body going to be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye who is going to do that religion for you who is going to be changed inside of you transformed it instead of you who is going to press the button for you blessed be the name of the Lord so God is going to ask us a question I want just to begin I mean finish by saying this there is something that you're supposed to do and to be ready to go to that place you are fearing to that level you thought you can't to say those words you thought you will never say to believe the things that you thought you'd never believe to stand in that ground that you thought you never stand that is where your food is there is perfect faith that's why the prophet he is speaking here about Jeremiah I think chapter 8 from verse 19 to 22 where where the Prophet is saying the summer has ended and you are not served and then he says why is the heart of my people not healed and God is asking why that means you are the problem not God you're the problem not God yeah because he is what the prophet says here he says in the message diseases and afflictions he says there is no need of anyone going away from here without being perfectly delivered there is no need there is no reason why you are sick and the healer is here is here you think you have problems and the dissolvable problem is here so he says there is no need there's no reason of anyone going away from here without being perfectly delivered I might not have just the time for everyone at the platform the prophet says I may not be having the time to pray for everybody but everyone can benefit by it if God can prove himself here to be God and what has confirmed what I have said to be the truth then believe God he says believe God he doesn't say believe in God believe God present tense believe God then act upon your faith and put your faith as a living action and God will go to work on you right there and will make you well so you have faith but you just have to work on your faith what if you say well I'm going to see how it works out it will never work out until you keep your testimony going they overcame the devil by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony but what is your testimony your testimony is not your testimony your testimony is that you are dead and Jesus is living in you so that's why the Bible says the testimony of Jesus Christ is the spirit of Prophecy so you prophesy Again by the testimony of Jesus Christ in you not your testimony you have no testimony you are a failure man is a failure to begin with but the testimony That Jesus Lives in You that is the spirit of Prophecy so he says it will never work until you keep your testimony going if you believe you are saved you believe you are saved you should act like you are saved you say you are saved and you associate with those that are saved and it works salvation is that right and the same thing will take place by Divine Healing do you believe you are healed you act like he healed you you say you are healed and he is a high priest of your confession to make good anything you confessed that he has done before the father there it is he comes down and says you know that but it's the truth as I'm standing here it is God is internal truth when you believe it and act upon your faith God will bring it to pass and then he says and the rest of you here could do the same thing at this time if you believe it up to you so God has washed everything away from himself is now on your laps it's not even brother that's why he slept and there are those who are still knocking on his door brother Brian I'm going to do this he didn't say this he didn't do this what do you want him to do he showed you Christ and he left the scene he identified a masterpiece he showed you the bridegroom and and what you want him to do and then the Brady groom you say speak say it believe it and my work will be to confirm it so what do you want Jesus to do it's you now act upon your faith it's up to you blessed be the name of the Lord so what am I saying as we finish friends that there is death and the standard against death is death when there was a death angel moving in Egypt the only standard that God gave the children of Israel was the death of a lamp so in the lamb died the blood was applied on the doors to proved that something died and I'm leaving by the death of a lamp that's the first Exodus so before any person died any animal died the lamb died that was a standard against the death was death Jesus in the second Exodus was the Lamb of God that died in order to counter the death that we were in to redeem us from death he died and today the standard against death is death when you are waiting to die to yourself and Jesus is leaving because the two of you cannot live at the same time so when you die and he leaves that is the standard against the Pale Horse Rider against death against hell and the prophet said the Father Paul will be preached to the total lost total lost are in hell and he saw hell on Earth so how did Jesus preach to the total lost in hell he died so you cannot preach to the total lost unless you die so when you are willing to die friend the death of the righteous then you are going to leave by his life you are going to overcome by his faith because faith is our victory I rather die that one today don't die the death of fools who turn around and doubt what they once believed we had trusted are you so foolish that you began in the spirit now you are perfected in the flesh foolishness the death of a fool versus the death of the righteous we should be ready and willing to Die the death of the righteous and then our end shall be like Jesus how did he end like I overcame and I'm sat with my father in his throne he that overcometh the enemy in the camp where there is food shall I grant him to come and sit with me so we in the right hour of rapture going home but how do we overcome we possess the enemies camp there is food there there is strength there there is power there power in the fact that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and his life and power and Dynamics and Power Glory is manifested that is your food that's your strength that's the strength of the church Rapture begins right now you are being changed it's a process we are going home it's not just going to be static God is bringing us into the move the move to go home but death is moving is looming and it has taken so many and men are dying as fools dying when they once knew the truth dying has people who never knew God dying like they never knew the message of the hour the evidence is on the tops you can play the tape and hear discernment again hear the Miracles and so forth going on but we are begin to act as fools sitting there and dying when we can do something it's today today his princess is here Jesus Christ is here how many would say I want to die the death of a righteous man I don't want to die as a fool how many are ready to say I take my healing today I take my Deliverance today I'm going to pray together with you because he's here if you have a problem the prophet said there is no reason why you should leave this building and go back home with the problem he has already paid for your healing he loves you to be healthier than you love it yourself that's why he died he suffered for it he paid in that price and I want to say this that if God knew that what is in you was supposed to deliver you and change you and you fail to utilize that chance he will ask you why you didn't go ahead and possess what belonged to you why why were you not healed why did you die of cancer when I was there to heal you why didn't you go ahead to bring glory to my name why did you allow people to think that I'm no longer a Healer why did you begin to magnify the enemy instead of me why always talking about the pain the disease the egg the this and that and you are not talking about me why not testify that Jesus Is My Healer why didn't you talk like a a Believer why didn't you speak the language your faith why didn't you go on to possess the land which is yours why didn't you seek me seek it by prayer why didn't even seek it by fasting why didn't you have to seek it until you got it these people didn't sit they stood they said why do we sit let's stand up and go and possess what belongs to us they stood and they walked fearlessly to their soon enemy but because they were ready to do that they didn't even fight anybody nobody even harmed them they didn't even have to see any Shadow to scare them God had done the fighting that's how our God works may God bless you can we stand up
