[0:00] ephesians chapter 3 verses 14 and 15
[0:08] for this cause i bow my knees unto the
[0:11] father of our lord jesus christ
[0:14] of whom the whole family in heaven and
[0:17] earth
[0:17] is named for this cause i bow my knees
[0:20] unto the father of our lord jesus christ
[0:24] and then verses 16 and on he expresses
[0:26] that cause
[0:27] but then he says of whom the whole
[0:30] family in heaven
[0:31] and earth is named that's bower heads in
[0:34] prayer
[0:35] now gracious heavenly fathers we stand
[0:37] together today
[0:38] we are humbled by your greatness lord we
[0:41] know your presence is amongst us and
[0:44] father we know that if you've come
[0:46] amongst us it's be to do something
[0:49] and that lord your spirit could be
[0:50] poured out in a way that generally
[0:52] touches many different people
[0:54] but your presence always has a very
[0:55] specific purpose
[0:57] and there's a general purpose and
[0:59] there's things you can accomplish even
[1:00] by way of healing and
[1:02] uplifting and deliverance but lord your
[1:05] presence has a very specific intent
[1:07] and lord we avail ourselves to your
[1:09] design today
[1:10] we humble ourselves to whatever your
[1:12] intent and purpose is
[1:14] and we pray that you would come now and
[1:15] bless the word which has been read
[1:17] those thoughts that may be shared from
[1:19] our hearts may they be your thoughts
[1:21] lord the scriptures and quotations may
[1:24] they be harnessed by the holy spirit
[1:26] directly to the believer's heart we ask
[1:28] all these things named lord jesus christ
[1:31] amen you may be seated
[1:35] i'm going to withhold giving my title
[1:38] just for a little bit
[1:40] but i want to just look at genesis
[1:42] chapter 1
[1:44] verse 1 because this is where we started
[1:46] in
[1:48] in july when we held our first services
[1:51] together
[1:52] and the scripture we know by heart now
[1:54] but in the beginning and of course you
[1:57] it's something that's very very easy to
[1:58] learn and uh to memorize in the
[2:00] beginning
[2:01] god created the heaven and the earth
[2:05] and we took several parts and looking at
[2:07] in the beginning
[2:08] and then we took several parts on god
[2:11] created
[2:12] and through those 15 different services
[2:14] that we've ministered on this subject of
[2:16] in the beginning god created
[2:18] we're looking at how that in this
[2:21] beginning
[2:22] or at the beginning uh different
[2:24] elements that were represented there in
[2:25] the beginning and how that god
[2:27] would in his creation god's creation was
[2:29] reflecting himself
[2:31] and something about his nature it was
[2:33] something reflecting something about his
[2:35] desire and purpose
[2:36] even though he may not have been very
[2:37] explicit even though he wasn't
[2:39] verbalizing what he wanted to do
[2:41] you could look at his creation and an
[2:44] artist or
[2:44] creator is known by his works so when we
[2:47] see that god created the heavens and the
[2:49] earth there was symbolism
[2:50] represented in that heaven and the earth
[2:53] and then when we look at how god
[2:55] made creation and brought forth man he
[2:57] was representing things about himself
[2:59] so it came into existence and uh and
[3:02] really we're there's gonna be maybe some
[3:04] principles that our uh review and maybe
[3:06] some principles
[3:07] uh that we've labored on before but we
[3:09] just wanna go through very quickly
[3:11] but this is this right now as we go
[3:13] forward you don't need to have heard
[3:14] anything else to this point so don't
[3:16] think oh great we missed the first
[3:18] 15 so we might as well just check out
[3:19] and and go to chipotle not yet they're
[3:21] not open
[3:24] but i want you just to begin to think of
[3:26] it this way
[3:27] how god existing by himself in the
[3:29] beginning
[3:30] everything that he was going to create
[3:32] was first in god's heart
[3:34] so whatever came into existence in
[3:36] creation first was in god's heart or in
[3:39] his thoughts
[3:39] so god had something in his mind and
[3:42] then there was a condescending order
[3:44] there was a way that god was descending
[3:45] and condescending
[3:47] from the invisible god with thoughts and
[3:49] the first step where he condescends he
[3:51] creates himself
[3:53] informs himself into a logos and brother
[3:55] battle makes the statement
[3:56] that from that moment that god formed
[3:58] himself in the logos he was always
[4:00] moving towards flesh so god wanted to be
[4:02] in
[4:03] didn't want to just stay in that
[4:04] theophany and that logos he wanted to
[4:06] become
[4:07] flesh but from that he begins to create
[4:10] and
[4:10] and god first establishes a supernatural
[4:13] dimension
[4:14] and in that dimension there's uh there's
[4:16] host and there's different arrangements
[4:17] of angels and there's different
[4:18] categories of supernatural beings
[4:20] and god created a great order in heaven
[4:23] before he created earth
[4:25] it says in psalms 11 4 the lord is in
[4:28] his temple
[4:29] the lord's throne is in heaven so when
[4:32] this is
[4:32] being described there's many other
[4:33] scriptures that speak of this
[4:35] but god now when he first created there
[4:37] was a throne in heaven
[4:39] there was a there was a temple in heaven
[4:41] and so in this
[4:42] supernatural dimension there were
[4:44] certain elements that are being
[4:45] represented
[4:46] and we can say perhaps they're symbolic
[4:48] and maybe there's some literal
[4:50] expression of it
[4:51] but that we use a human language to
[4:53] describe something in heaven
[4:54] the lord is in his holy temple the
[4:56] lord's throne is in heaven
[4:58] this is describing another dimension
[5:00] that we don't exist in
[5:02] and so the creation of earth mirrored
[5:04] what was in heaven
[5:06] brother makes the statement for
[5:08] everything in earth is just a pattern of
[5:10] that which is in heaven
[5:11] so when god begins to create on earth it
[5:13] had already existed first in heaven
[5:16] and before it existed in heaven it
[5:18] existed in the mind of god
[5:20] so what is in the mind of god he then
[5:22] lays out in a
[5:23] a supernatural dimension in a dimension
[5:25] that's not bound by
[5:26] time and light and space as we are now
[5:29] but in that dimension
[5:30] and even those different orders of
[5:32] dimensions uh that are unseen to us
[5:34] god establishes an arrangement and an
[5:36] order in hosts and spirits and angels
[5:39] billabong said the spirit of god made
[5:41] nature and all god and nature
[5:43] is incontinuity so there is something
[5:46] he says in continuity so god and nature
[5:49] in continuity
[5:50] so there's a continuity with god's
[5:52] creation and what we see naturally
[5:54] and then what is in heaven so there's an
[5:56] agreement there's an accord there's
[5:58] something where
[5:58] what we see in heaven we also see we can
[6:01] see an earth
[6:02] as it says in first john chapter 5
[6:04] verses 7 and 8
[6:06] for there are three that bear record in
[6:08] heaven the father the word
[6:10] and the holy ghost and these three are
[6:12] one so we see these things that bear
[6:14] witness bear record in heaven the father
[6:16] the word and the holy ghost
[6:18] and there are three that bear witness in
[6:20] earth the spirit
[6:22] and the water and the blood and these
[6:23] three agree in one
[6:25] so what you see the three being one in
[6:27] heaven the father the word and the holy
[6:29] ghost and then we see a reflection on
[6:31] earth the spirit
[6:32] the water and the blood and there's a so
[6:34] there's a mirroring of what's in heaven
[6:36] and what's on earth
[6:38] you're often the phrase the natural
[6:39] types the spiritual
[6:41] and that may have application to um to
[6:44] our spiritual lives and spiritual things
[6:45] that take place here on earth
[6:47] but it's also even in creation that what
[6:50] was spiritual and supernatural and what
[6:51] related to another dimension higher than
[6:53] that of earth
[6:54] that it's now being mirrored and
[6:56] expressed on earth
[6:58] so god's creation on earth reveals a
[7:01] heavenly
[7:02] objective well god what god begins to do
[7:04] on earth
[7:05] is mirrored in heaven what god begins to
[7:08] unfold has a reflection in heaven
[7:11] in exodus chapter 25 verses 8 and 9
[7:14] and there's a number of scriptures we
[7:15] could have used here but we wanted to be
[7:17] sure
[7:18] to uh just try to stay very focused
[7:21] and it says in exodus chapter 25 verses
[7:24] 8 9 and let them make me a sanctuary god
[7:27] is speaking to moses now on the mount
[7:29] and let them make me a sanctuary that i
[7:32] may dwell among them
[7:33] according to all that i show thee after
[7:36] the pattern of the tabernacle
[7:39] and the pattern of all the instruments
[7:40] thereof even so shall you make it
[7:43] so god was going to show him a
[7:44] tabernacle god was going to show him
[7:47] instruments and he's telling them
[7:48] whatever i show you i want you to make
[7:50] it after that pattern
[7:52] so when god begins to show him something
[7:55] and reveals this to him and shows them
[7:57] the this tabernacle and all the
[7:59] instruments and then you begin to read
[8:00] and all the different elements related
[8:02] to it
[8:02] he's saying make me a sanctuary after
[8:05] this
[8:05] pattern that i show you and so moses
[8:08] made the earthly tabernacle
[8:10] after what he saw in heaven and in many
[8:14] different jewish writings and i was
[8:15] reading several of them and i found
[8:16] several statements i'll just read two of
[8:18] them to you
[8:19] this is in the uh outside of their their
[8:22] their bible but these are
[8:23] rabbinical writings and things in
[8:25] history and they say the structure of
[8:27] the tabernacle
[8:28] corresponds to the structure of heaven
[8:30] and earth amen
[8:32] then another place the right the
[8:33] tabernacle below was likewise made after
[8:36] the pattern
[8:37] of the supernatural tabernacle in all
[8:39] its details
[8:41] and brother branham enforces this time
[8:42] and time again that god
[8:44] showed moses a tabernacle in heaven and
[8:47] when moses saw what was in heaven god
[8:49] wanted him to make
[8:50] upon earth a tabernacle reflecting what
[8:53] was already in heaven
[8:55] and so the what we're using this to
[8:57] emphasize is that there's something that
[8:59] exists in the supernatural heavenly
[9:01] realm
[9:01] but then there's also a reflection of it
[9:03] here on earth and
[9:04] as it unfolds on earth it's showing what
[9:07] god wants to achieve
[9:08] even in the tabernacle we can see the
[9:10] triune nature of man
[9:12] and and how the even in the the three
[9:14] that agree in heaven and the three that
[9:16] agree in one on earth
[9:17] and the bible says in revelations 11 19
[9:20] and the temple of god was opened in
[9:21] heaven
[9:22] and there was seen in his temple the ark
[9:24] of his testament
[9:25] so this is just one of many scriptures
[9:27] we could share with you
[9:29] of how that there's an image in heaven
[9:32] and now it's being reflected literally
[9:33] in a tabernacle on earth a temple on
[9:35] earth
[9:36] but it shows there was something there
[9:37] first that is going to be expressed and
[9:40] portrayed here upon earth
[9:42] as it says in hebrews chapter 8 verse 5
[9:45] who serve
[9:46] unto the example and shadow of heavenly
[9:49] things
[9:49] talking about the temple worship and the
[9:50] tabernacle and order of sacrifices
[9:53] as moses was amongst when he was about
[9:55] to make the tabernacle
[9:56] foresee saith he this is god speaking
[9:59] see that thou make
[10:00] all things according to the pattern
[10:02] showed to thee in the
[10:04] mount and so the things that god showed
[10:07] him
[10:08] in heaven moses then took what he saw in
[10:11] heaven as a pattern as a blueprint
[10:13] and reproduced it on earth that it might
[10:15] be as it says an example in shadow of
[10:18] heavenly things
[10:19] so even in building the temple and the
[10:21] tabernacle in the wilderness or the
[10:23] temple of solomon
[10:24] and the way that god expressed those
[10:25] things and showed those things they were
[10:27] to be a shadow
[10:28] and a type of what was in heaven not the
[10:30] complete fulfillment
[10:32] of it so what was in heaven has to have
[10:34] its ultimate realization its ultimate
[10:36] expression
[10:37] and the tabernacle in the wilderness and
[10:39] the temple that solomon built these are
[10:41] a reflection of something in heaven
[10:43] a heavenly objective and so i use that
[10:47] as an example to to make this point
[10:50] that what god establishes in genesis
[10:52] chapter one in genesis chapter two
[10:54] we can say a creation of everything in
[10:56] chapter one and then a bringing out of
[10:58] seeds and
[10:59] unfolding of things in genesis chapter 2
[11:01] what has it has
[11:02] a heavenly representation that we're
[11:06] seeing a shadow or
[11:07] type as an example in shadow of heavenly
[11:09] things
[11:11] heavenly things that must become real
[11:13] heavenly things that must be perfectly
[11:15] realized so if we can if we can look at
[11:18] creation that way especially the
[11:20] original creation
[11:21] it gives a supernatural significance to
[11:24] the original
[11:25] that whatever god has set and placed in
[11:27] the original
[11:28] is a shadowing type of heavenly things
[11:31] and we know that we're not just to
[11:32] remain here even in this earthly
[11:34] tabernacle
[11:35] and in this cosmos as we know it but
[11:37] it's going to come back into the eternal
[11:39] then whatever is heavenly must gain full
[11:41] expression
[11:42] and so there's great supernatural
[11:45] significance to
[11:46] the original creation
[11:50] and the climax of god's creation
[11:53] in genesis chapter two if you ponder
[11:55] that think for a moment
[11:56] how that in genesis chapter 2 we see
[11:58] that god has done creating
[12:03] god's done bringing forth of these seeds
[12:06] the climax of creation was not just a
[12:09] man
[12:12] and it's very important to see this
[12:14] image and also see to see the image of
[12:16] god in creation
[12:18] in genesis chapter 1 verse 27 let us
[12:20] make man in our image
[12:21] and then he says in man so he made man
[12:23] in his image and after his likeness
[12:25] but man is not finished because man at
[12:28] that point brother
[12:29] says is a supernatural being or a
[12:31] spiritual being he is just a spirit
[12:34] then in genesis chapter 2 verse 7 god
[12:36] forms
[12:37] man out of the dust of the earth and
[12:39] what he brings is he brings flesh
[12:41] so man is a spirit and he's not finished
[12:44] but now he brings forth flesh
[12:45] and the spirit now indwells the flesh
[12:47] and you say the man himself is complete
[12:50] but still it's not mankind's final
[12:52] expression it's not the climax
[12:54] of creation in genesis chapter 2 verse 4
[12:59] before it god even forms them into flesh
[13:02] and before god further unfolds
[13:04] mankind in this chapter says these are
[13:06] the generations of the heaven and earth
[13:09] and this generation it means a begetting
[13:11] a product it comes from word to bring
[13:13] forth
[13:14] this is what's brought forth from the
[13:16] heaven and the earth
[13:17] when they were created in the day that
[13:20] the lord god
[13:21] made the earth and the heavens now by
[13:24] this phrase there's a foreshadowing that
[13:26] takes place
[13:27] by introducing god now in using this
[13:30] phrase in the day that the lord god
[13:32] made the earth and the heavens says in
[13:34] the beginning god created the heaven and
[13:36] the earth now there's a different phrase
[13:38] that is used
[13:39] not just the earth and the heavens but
[13:40] it says the lord god
[13:42] made the earth and the heavens
[13:45] lord is jehovah god is elohim in the
[13:48] beginning god
[13:49] elohim created but now it's the lord god
[13:53] elohim is the one who exists by himself
[13:56] this would be the god before there was
[13:58] anything all alone dwelling with his
[14:00] thoughts he exists by himself
[14:01] he is not dependent upon any other he
[14:04] has not originated from something else
[14:06] he exists by himself i know you can't
[14:08] get your head around it don't try
[14:09] he just always was and so here is this
[14:13] god who always was but now
[14:15] it's not just it's not just elohim
[14:19] the god the strong one bound by an oath
[14:21] but now it's jehovah god
[14:24] and that jehovah speaks again of the
[14:25] self-existent one but it's adanahi which
[14:28] comes from
[14:29] which means it's the becoming god one
[14:31] that becomes
[14:32] one that exists so you have elohim a
[14:34] strong one all by himself
[14:36] and now jehovah's still the same
[14:38] self-existent one
[14:39] but now he has a name lord god which
[14:42] means he's becoming amen
[14:44] the god that is being expressed in this
[14:47] name change
[14:48] placed god this change of his name to
[14:50] lord god lord god places god
[14:52] in relationship to his creation without
[14:55] creation without anything else existing
[14:56] he's only elohim
[14:58] but now that creation is coming forth in
[15:00] a particular representation
[15:02] it's now god becoming its lord god
[15:05] so now god is placed in relationship to
[15:07] his creation
[15:08] and creation is being placed in
[15:10] relationship to god
[15:12] and brother branham takes picks up on
[15:14] this phrase lord god in the message
[15:16] adoption part 1
[15:18] and he's talking about how he was el
[15:20] ella elohim the all-sufficient
[15:22] all-powerful almighty
[15:24] self-existent one but in genesis 2 when
[15:26] he made man
[15:27] and he says he says he calls himself
[15:29] jehovah
[15:30] you see that he spells it he says
[15:32] jehovah he says what did it mean
[15:34] i am the all-existent one who has
[15:37] created
[15:38] now notice this now that it's jehovah
[15:40] comes into the picture and it's jehovah
[15:42] god
[15:42] i am the self-existent one or all
[15:44] existence one who has created
[15:46] something off of myself to be a
[15:49] son of mine so this is what makes him
[15:52] lord god now this is god becoming
[15:54] because we see this
[15:55] son that comes forth then he uses an
[15:57] interesting phrase or a temporary
[16:00] or amateur little one of mine now i used
[16:02] to read that and think temporary what he
[16:04] just meant was amateur
[16:05] but yet we see adam's full sonship was
[16:07] temporary
[16:08] because he lost the holy image of god
[16:10] and enters into a fallen state
[16:12] he's still a son but he lost something
[16:14] now he says jehovah means that he gave
[16:16] man to be an amateur god
[16:18] because he is father god and he made a
[16:21] man
[16:21] an amateur god so he's isn't
[16:24] self-existence anymore
[16:26] he exists with his family
[16:30] i want you to catch that part now he's
[16:32] jehovah god
[16:33] before he's just elohim he's by himself
[16:35] but now he calls himself
[16:38] not just elohim but jehovah elohim i am
[16:41] becoming
[16:42] and now he exists with his family
[16:45] as this image comes forth ella ella
[16:49] elohim now he is jehovah jehovah meaning
[16:52] the one who exists with his family i
[16:55] like this definition
[16:56] amen jehovah god is one who now exists
[16:59] with this family he says god made man to
[17:00] predominate over the earth he had
[17:02] dominion and the earth was man's
[17:03] dominion
[17:04] is that scripture then if that's his
[17:05] domain he was god over the earth he
[17:07] could speak and it would be so
[17:08] he could speak this and it would be so
[17:10] there is god jehovah
[17:12] the one who once existed in
[17:13] self-existence but now
[17:15] exists with his family and his little
[17:18] one's with him and he says there you are
[17:21] you're expressed in that image so now
[17:24] jehovah
[17:24] when he says that the lord god
[17:27] made the earth and the heavens he's
[17:29] foreshadowing something that's coming
[17:31] forth
[17:32] because this designates him not just as
[17:34] a being who exists by himself
[17:36] but one who's now going to exist with
[17:37] his family and little ones with them
[17:40] so the image we have now of god is that
[17:42] god as a father is together
[17:44] with his children so this is where god
[17:48] expresses his primary goal and
[17:50] culmination
[17:52] in the in the culmination of creation
[17:54] god is expressing
[17:55] his primary goal and this is where we
[17:57] come
[17:58] to what my subject is god expressing
[18:01] what he was ultimately trying to achieve
[18:03] or become
[18:04] in the culmination of the original
[18:05] creation it's not man
[18:07] it's not just man and flesh but it's a
[18:09] family
[18:12] and as we've been looking at
[18:15] as we began this series it was
[18:18] in the beginning and then it was god
[18:22] created
[18:24] and now it's a family
[18:27] in the beginning god created a family
[18:31] you can see it in genesis chapter one
[18:32] verse one in the beginning god created
[18:34] the heaven and the earth what was it
[18:36] heavenly bridegroom
[18:38] earthly bride you see man and woman
[18:40] there was god the father
[18:42] is going to have something where he's no
[18:44] longer by himself
[18:45] he now exists with this family
[18:48] and so this is the title you could write
[18:49] it down now you can go back and put it
[18:51] at the top
[18:52] if you don't write anything else you can
[18:53] at least put the title that way if
[18:54] someone says well what did he preach you
[18:56] go oh
[18:57] where's my notes can you flip say family
[19:00] and it's always really easy
[19:03] so now god then takes
[19:06] this expression and he brings
[19:09] creation to one particular
[19:11] representation
[19:12] and what it is it's god's ultimate
[19:14] purpose and it's a family
[19:16] bill of ram says adam was the son of god
[19:18] eve was a daughter of god
[19:20] so now it's the father expressed
[19:23] in and as a son and daughter but now
[19:26] it's god is still now he's becoming and
[19:29] he has a son
[19:30] and he has a daughter it's god painting
[19:32] a self-portrait
[19:33] it's the first selfie and
[19:36] and what you see is a man and a woman
[19:39] and brother brandon makes this statement
[19:40] everything on earth reflects heaven
[19:43] so when it comes to man man is a
[19:45] reflection of what's in heaven
[19:47] and then he says it was when he gets to
[19:48] the creation man he said it was a
[19:49] perfect reflection
[19:51] of the highest in heaven and i want you
[19:53] just to catch this so there's something
[19:55] in heaven that's got to be reflected
[19:56] upon earth
[19:57] when man comes forth he was a perfect
[19:59] reflection of the highest in heaven
[20:01] but we know that god's picture is not
[20:03] fully developed when adam is there in
[20:05] flesh
[20:06] but the negative is being formed the
[20:09] negative is still the image is still
[20:11] coming into the negative
[20:12] what is it it's a shadow that's being
[20:14] expressed it's a type
[20:16] being expressed as he said it was an
[20:17] example in shadow of heaven heavenly
[20:19] things
[20:19] adam is an example in shadow of what's
[20:22] in the heart of god an image that god
[20:23] has in his mind
[20:24] an image that was being expressed in
[20:26] heaven but an image that god ultimately
[20:28] wants to
[20:29] fully develop as he works his way to
[20:32] flesh
[20:35] now
[20:41] i'm not going to read through this but
[20:42] i'm just going to put it up there
[20:45] the purpose and vision of arizona
[20:46] believer's church
[20:48] and it's on i put it on our website and
[20:51] it's been there from the beginning
[20:54] and i just want to if so if you if you
[20:57] want this i can provide it to you
[21:01] but what god establishes in the
[21:03] beginning gives us
[21:04] direction even as a church
[21:08] and as a local church and i was going to
[21:10] take time to go through that but i just
[21:11] want to move
[21:12] more quickly as a local church i could i
[21:16] express this
[21:17] as a burden and a vision that i have as
[21:19] a local church
[21:21] we desire to become a church family you
[21:24] don't want this just to be a gathering
[21:26] of card players and where you know this
[21:28] person and
[21:29] and all you have in common is when you
[21:30] get together to play cards
[21:32] uh but you want it to be something where
[21:33] there's a there's an affection that
[21:35] grows and a connection and you
[21:37] understand one another and you're
[21:38] burdened for each other and you look
[21:39] after the needs of one another and we
[21:41] see how
[21:42] paul teaches how that local body should
[21:45] be
[21:45] in unity and the way that it functions
[21:47] to serve one another just even on a
[21:49] local level
[21:50] so we desire to become a church family
[21:52] be our desire to build a church home not
[21:54] just a home church but a church home
[21:56] it's a place where you feel that you
[21:57] belong in on a church level on a
[21:59] spiritual level
[22:01] and then begin to function as a family
[22:03] that you function
[22:04] as as a real family of god and as a a
[22:07] harmonious unit
[22:08] and i remember one time before i
[22:10] preached somewhere the brother was
[22:11] introducing introducing me and he was
[22:14] saying oh brother aaron's like family
[22:15] and he's like a son and we just think
[22:17] we love him like fam and he kept going
[22:19] on so much about family and then when i
[22:20] took over the pulpit i said you know the
[22:22] more he considered me family the more i
[22:24] kind of begin to flinch because you
[22:26] don't know my family
[22:28] and some of us have kind of have that
[22:29] that you know that a flinching and we
[22:32] get a little bit afraid
[22:33] oh family well i know what family means
[22:35] family ain't no fun
[22:36] but we're talking about real family
[22:37] we're talking about true family we're
[22:38] talking of family
[22:39] that isn't completely dysfunctional
[22:41] although all families have some
[22:43] dysfunction
[22:43] but a family which is not narcissistic a
[22:46] family which isn't abusive or
[22:47] controlling a family
[22:48] which can humble themselves and
[22:50] apologize a family that's always working
[22:52] to through differences and regardless of
[22:54] where you're at you're still
[22:55] family let's work things out let's
[22:57] acknowledge differences let's
[22:58] acknowledge offenses let's make them
[23:00] right
[23:00] a family that's willing to work and
[23:02] that's what we want to be as function as
[23:04] a true family as a family ought to
[23:08] but even though that would be what god
[23:10] would desire for a local church is that
[23:12] it would be a family and that it would
[23:13] be a church home and that we would be
[23:15] able to function together
[23:16] let me say this church does not replace
[23:19] your family
[23:22] church itself is not greater than the
[23:24] family unit
[23:26] therefore the church leadership if
[23:28] church doesn't replace family
[23:30] then church leadership does not replace
[23:32] family leadership
[23:34] just because there's a pastor of a
[23:36] church doesn't mean you're not the
[23:38] pastor in your home
[23:39] husbands because that's what brother
[23:41] branham taught brother branham taught
[23:42] that the husband
[23:43] is the pastor in the home otherwise
[23:45] scriptures don't make any sense when it
[23:47] says
[23:47] women if you have a question learn at
[23:49] home ask your husbands why
[23:51] spiritually he's your pastor and that's
[23:54] what the message teaches
[23:55] us and so just because there's a local
[23:57] church and it's a good church and it's a
[23:58] dynamic church and god is moving and
[24:00] god's vindicating his presence
[24:02] with the church and you have a local
[24:03] leadership within the church that does
[24:05] not replace the leadership of the holy
[24:07] spirit
[24:07] through the members of the family
[24:09] through the husband and wife and over
[24:10] their children
[24:12] you have personal responsibility and you
[24:15] have a spiritual anointing as a husband
[24:17] as a wife
[24:18] as a father and a mother to guide your
[24:21] children
[24:22] and you do not forfeit that to the
[24:24] church
[24:27] the strength of a church is a family
[24:30] that's
[24:30] what makes a church strong is strong
[24:32] families so substituting the family
[24:34] with church brings weakness when we just
[24:38] forfeit our family leadership and the
[24:39] individual leadership of the holy spirit
[24:41] in our lives and we
[24:42] we forfeit it all to church and we make
[24:43] church the end all and we make church
[24:45] the most important thing then that's
[24:46] where there's disorder
[24:47] and that's when there's weakness
[24:50] therefore if that's
[24:52] uh if if uh if a family unit to
[24:54] something that god has or
[24:56] recognized and blessed and something
[24:57] that god wants to
[24:59] enrich and it's something that we don't
[25:02] forfeit
[25:03] now we'll get further into this subject
[25:05] because i know people's minds start
[25:06] going different places
[25:08] family is not greater than the word
[25:13] but church isn't greater than families
[25:16] and so you can't just take church and
[25:18] substitute it for family
[25:19] therefore i believe a church exists to
[25:22] strengthen families by the word
[25:25] and those individuals within the family
[25:28] and
[25:29] and i know that uh i'll say this because
[25:32] i realize and
[25:33] i i'll say this and hopefully come to it
[25:35] at the end if if your family's
[25:38] out of order then god can bring order
[25:41] something's missing there's something
[25:43] broken god that's what god is all about
[25:45] he's a restorer he's a healer he's a
[25:46] redeemer so if things haven't been done
[25:49] right or you've moved past that stage or
[25:51] whatever and maybe
[25:52] even grandparents say well what do i do
[25:53] now or we don't have a family at home
[25:55] you're still a family husband and wife
[25:58] and then you can say well what about
[26:00] and as grandparents i believe you have a
[26:01] responsibility to
[26:03] encourage uh your children and your
[26:05] grandchildren in the right things and be
[26:07] there as a support
[26:08] and not as the one who's like hey
[26:09] whenever your grandpa's house there's no
[26:11] rules you get to do everything
[26:13] you're not supposed to do at grandma
[26:14] it's your parents house
[26:16] and there's some people that try to
[26:17] position themselves as the cool the cool
[26:19] grandparents when you're here you can do
[26:20] whatever you want you drink all the
[26:21] coffee you want have all the soda you
[26:23] want i know mom and dad don't like you
[26:24] watching this but when you're here you
[26:26] can watch it
[26:26] and listen some professing message
[26:28] believers act that way
[26:30] and they don't realize what a die what a
[26:33] landmine what a bomb they're building
[26:36] right there within this child's heart
[26:38] so even as grandparents there's a
[26:39] responsibility to encourage
[26:41] parents and your grandchildren in the
[26:42] right thing but then you say well what
[26:44] what about someone who doesn't have any
[26:45] family at all
[26:48] a church home can provide a family
[26:50] dynamic that they can operate within
[26:52] can actually provide them opportunities
[26:55] to be
[26:56] to be motherly opportunities to be
[26:57] fatherly opportunities
[26:59] to to teach and encourage and assist so
[27:01] there's actually within the local church
[27:04] when it becomes a church family and a
[27:06] church home those without families
[27:08] have a dynamic and different
[27:09] relationships to which they can serve
[27:11] and
[27:11] function and i believe it's important to
[27:14] understand
[27:16] very significant to understand the
[27:18] importance of family we need to
[27:19] understand
[27:20] the importance of family to understand
[27:22] its purpose its function what it what it
[27:24] means to god
[27:25] even the role of individual members
[27:27] within the family the duty of individual
[27:29] family members
[27:30] and the relationships among family
[27:32] members all those different things are
[27:33] so deep
[27:34] and i'm using general terms but they're
[27:36] so rich you could just take
[27:38] one family relationship and teach on it
[27:40] and never stop
[27:42] what because it's a reflection of god in
[27:44] heaven because parenthood originated in
[27:46] god he was the first parent
[27:48] so you could preach on parenthood from
[27:50] now until the change of our body
[27:52] why because it's something that reflects
[27:53] god's nature and god's character
[27:55] something about who he is so these
[27:58] relationships among family members and
[28:00] and the purpose and function of family
[28:02] the duty and responsibility of
[28:03] individual family members they are
[28:05] important and so if you want to turn to
[28:07] genesis chapter 2
[28:10] i want to continue to look at what god
[28:11] created what he established what he
[28:14] blessed
[28:15] to see the family in god's plan and the
[28:17] family from god's perspective
[28:20] and genesis chapter 2 verse 22
[28:23] because this is now man's not the
[28:26] ultimate creation
[28:27] man is not the ultimate expression
[28:30] and what god created beginning what he
[28:33] the climax of god's creation
[28:34] was not a church i'm going to say it
[28:38] again can i get an amen
[28:39] the climax of god's creation was not a
[28:42] church
[28:44] i know there's a there's a story told
[28:46] one time where a man was stranded on an
[28:48] island and there was
[28:48] when they found him there was three
[28:50] different huts
[28:51] and they said well what's up with the
[28:53] three huts he goes well that one's
[28:54] that's the
[28:55] he's all by himself he said that's my
[28:56] house that's where i lived so what's the
[28:57] second one it goes
[28:58] well that that's uh that's a church
[29:01] that's where i go to church and say well
[29:02] what about the third he goes oh that's
[29:04] the church i left
[29:05] and started a new one
[29:08] and so it's just it's just in man to do
[29:10] it you they'll split a church when they
[29:12] don't even
[29:12] they're the only one but
[29:16] there's a when god builds his creation
[29:19] it reaches its climax
[29:21] he hasn't established a church with the
[29:22] pastor associate pastor deacons and
[29:24] trustees
[29:25] and a board and musicians and god says i
[29:27] want this to become the figure
[29:29] i want this to become the likeness that
[29:31] i'm going to achieve ultimately
[29:32] no church only reflects and is only a
[29:35] type
[29:36] of the ultimate that god is wanting to
[29:37] achieve
[29:39] and maybe just throwing breadcrumbs out
[29:41] there that we could express in greater
[29:43] detail
[29:43] did you know that church order is just a
[29:45] type of family order
[29:47] and that within the church there's no
[29:49] one office that fulfills all the offices
[29:51] that a husband does within the family
[29:54] but only through pastor deacon and
[29:56] trustee do you actually have enough
[29:58] function
[29:58] to where you you feel the role that a
[30:00] husband does naturally within his family
[30:04] because it's just a type it doesn't
[30:06] replace it doesn't usurp it doesn't
[30:08] overthrow
[30:09] it doesn't inject itself and insert
[30:10] itself and try to disrupt and overthrow
[30:13] and cause a mess listen the worst thing
[30:15] you could do to a son of god
[30:16] is take away the leadership of the holy
[30:18] ghost
[30:20] and so there's a there's so a church
[30:22] shouldn't exist to try to tell you
[30:24] everything you need to do
[30:25] and what you need to wear and how you
[30:26] need to dress and how you need a
[30:27] vacation and where you need to go and
[30:28] what you need to celebrate
[30:29] what you can what you don't just preach
[30:31] the word and let the word lead and guide
[30:33] individuals
[30:35] and the and the elect will not be
[30:37] deceived
[30:38] the elect will be quick into life the
[30:40] elect have the inside teacher the elect
[30:42] will walk in the word
[30:43] so teach the word if the words
[30:45] corrective teach it if the word takes a
[30:46] position teach it but don't meddle
[30:49] that's not what church is about
[30:55] and so the ultimate now that god is
[30:57] coming through it's not man
[30:59] but there's a further expression and
[31:00] watch how this unfolds because i want
[31:02] you to see
[31:03] a family in the beginning god created
[31:05] and our title
[31:06] is a family and it just opens up a
[31:09] subject that i trust we can explore
[31:12] for for this year in genesis chapter 2
[31:14] verse 22
[31:15] and the rib which the lord god had taken
[31:18] from man
[31:20] made he a woman
[31:23] and brought her unto the man
[31:26] this is a very significant act brother
[31:29] man said here portraying
[31:31] the bride that's coming from the rib
[31:34] which is the side of man
[31:35] he takes this rib and this word means
[31:38] side or even chamber
[31:42] and this very same word is used of cells
[31:44] and chambers
[31:45] inside the temple so god was not just
[31:48] arbitrary when he chose the rib but it
[31:52] was something he put
[31:53] in man that he knew he would use later
[31:56] so even in choosing the rib like we
[31:59] mentioned before about
[32:00] uh and who is my neighbor it could have
[32:02] just said and then the samaritan came by
[32:04] and he helped the man who was wounded
[32:06] who which one was neighbor to him that
[32:08] was wounded and i believe the lawyer
[32:09] still would have got the right answer
[32:11] even though he's a lawyer he still would
[32:13] have been able to say well
[32:14] it was the man who showed mercy but
[32:16] jesus does not just stop and say well he
[32:18] saw him and helped him
[32:19] he gave very specific details as to how
[32:22] he helped him
[32:22] he went down to him and he bound up his
[32:24] wounds pointing the oil and the wine and
[32:26] he set him on his own beast
[32:28] and brought him to the end and stayed
[32:29] the night with them and carried with him
[32:31] to the morning
[32:32] and then the morning gave two pence to
[32:33] the the inn keeper and said here
[32:35] whatever he has need of pay for it
[32:37] if you need more i'll repay more when i
[32:39] get back jesus used all that because it
[32:41] has significance
[32:43] and god just did not just say well he
[32:45] caused a deep sleep over adam and he
[32:47] took
[32:47] a bone and he made a woman or he just
[32:49] took something from adam and made a
[32:50] woman but he's very specific
[32:53] does it seem odd that god was very
[32:55] specific
[32:58] god wanted to express something he took
[33:00] a rib from his side it wasn't from his
[33:02] heel it wasn't from his head it was from
[33:03] his side
[33:04] she's gonna go be co-equal with him and
[33:06] now this word is used later in scripture
[33:08] and it's used to describe
[33:10] chambers or cells inside the temple
[33:14] and the use of the word is they it is
[33:16] just translated for b
[33:17] as beam or plank a plank of wood
[33:21] like a plank of cedar wood a plank of
[33:23] fur and it actually is used to
[33:25] describe building materials of the
[33:28] temple
[33:30] now why because he takes a rib from adam
[33:34] to make a tabernacle that the spirit
[33:38] that was
[33:38] in adam will now dwell in
[33:42] so the rib he takes a rib and it's a
[33:44] word that now has significance it's
[33:45] building materials for a temple
[33:47] it's building materials for a tabernacle
[33:50] and he takes it from
[33:51] man and the man where there's adam
[33:54] it's adam he's he's it's he comes from
[33:57] man and from adam
[33:58] he takes this rib this beam this plank
[34:00] this material
[34:02] and he makes a woman isha
[34:05] so now you have adam and esha and he
[34:08] introduces the woman
[34:10] isha unto the man adam
[34:14] he introduces the woman esha to adam
[34:17] that's the word that's used adam
[34:18] the man. so now adam when this woman is
[34:22] brought to him he now begins to speak
[34:26] and give utterance in verse 23 and adam
[34:29] said this is now bone of my bones and
[34:31] flesh of my flesh
[34:32] she will be called woman because she was
[34:35] taken out of
[34:36] man now who's reading from a king james
[34:40] bible
[34:42] show of hands well a few people are you
[34:45] notice the woman is capitalized and the
[34:48] man is capitalized
[34:50] very peculiar very odd it doesn't happen
[34:51] anywhere else but in the
[34:53] it tran it's now capitalized woman and
[34:56] man
[34:57] is capitalized here and this is
[35:00] and i believe it has significance where
[35:03] the woman now isha
[35:04] because she was taken out of the man now
[35:07] brother brahm takes this phrase and he
[35:09] uses life of life power of power and
[35:11] says
[35:11] about the bride she is him
[35:15] and you'll find brother branham is just
[35:16] he is bringing and amplifying the real
[35:18] meaning of this verse
[35:19] because to be flesh of my flesh i'll
[35:21] start with the second phrase he uses
[35:23] she is flesh of my flesh that means
[35:24] she's from my physical body
[35:26] basar is the hebrew word there she the
[35:29] word that she used it comes from bizarre
[35:30] she is part of my physical body she is
[35:32] flash of my flesh
[35:33] my physical part has been now multiplied
[35:36] there's another part of me
[35:37] he took my rib a beam a plank material
[35:40] from me
[35:40] from my side he took this chamber and
[35:42] he's now formed a body
[35:44] she is flesh of my flesh and the root
[35:47] word that's used there bessar and the
[35:49] hebrew means to publish or show forth
[35:52] and we say she is flesh of my flesh the
[35:54] woman was published from man
[35:56] she is a flesh she's a publication she's
[35:59] a multiplication of man she is now
[36:01] expressing man in physical form an
[36:04] expression of man
[36:05] but this phrase bone of my bones i used
[36:08] to always read it like
[36:09] you have the flesh and you have the
[36:10] bones like sticking sticks and stones
[36:12] may break my bones
[36:13] and we think bones is like the bone part
[36:15] but that's not what it means
[36:18] flesh of my flesh would be the physical
[36:20] body skin bones organs all those things
[36:22] that are material
[36:23] but bone of my bones the word there
[36:25] that's used is essence of my essence
[36:28] substance of my substance self of myself
[36:34] she is me she's
[36:38] she she's essence of my essence she's
[36:40] substance of my substance
[36:42] he said this is the self of myself she
[36:44] is flesh of my flesh materially
[36:46] but now who she is completely who she is
[36:49] as a being who she is in spirit
[36:51] she is the essence of my essence she is
[36:53] the substance of my substance
[36:55] that's what we teach all the time about
[36:57] the bride that's what the woman
[36:59] represented in genesis 2.
[37:02] it says because she was taken out of man
[37:07] now this is this is awesome stuff
[37:12] sorry if that's an old word this is lit
[37:16] okay i hope this is okay to say it but i
[37:19] mean is it yet is that what we say now
[37:21] i wanna i wanna stay connected with my
[37:23] young people
[37:25] i'm gonna find out later that that's a
[37:26] really bad word and uh you'll find uh
[37:30] on on the archive it says blank spot on
[37:32] tape e.d
[37:36] but now that the woman is taken out of
[37:38] the man now that the woman capital w
[37:40] woman has come
[37:42] he's no longer just referred to as adam
[37:45] but says the woman was taken out of man
[37:47] and it capitalized it as man
[37:48] the word that's used there is ish and
[37:51] that is
[37:51] husband it's translated to husband in
[37:53] genesis chapter 3 verses 6 and 15. my
[37:55] desire should be to your east to your
[37:57] husband
[37:58] so now what has happened it's not just
[38:00] adam
[38:01] the man who exists by himself but now
[38:04] the designation that god that adam even
[38:06] uses of himself and that it's expressed
[38:08] even in some may view
[38:09] as god speaking that god is now speaking
[38:12] it's prophecy
[38:12] it's written and there's an utterance
[38:14] from god adam says this is now
[38:16] bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh
[38:18] she shall be called woman that's adam's
[38:20] job
[38:21] to name he had named everything else in
[38:24] creation he named it after certain
[38:25] characteristics
[38:26] something that struck him and now the
[38:28] woman is represented as being from man
[38:31] so she shall be called
[38:32] war men because she was taken and he
[38:34] doesn't say
[38:35] out of man adam but out of husband
[38:40] because now that there's a woman his
[38:42] relationship changes it's just not adam
[38:44] but now it's easy he's now husband when
[38:47] the woman is formed
[38:48] notice this his office changed because
[38:50] he steps into a new relationship
[38:54] adam all by himself but now that there's
[38:56] a woman that's come from him
[38:57] and now this woman represents something
[38:59] to him so because of relationship his
[39:01] office changes
[39:02] and now mankind has a different
[39:04] designation
[39:05] he calls himself ish husband and it's a
[39:09] designation that's essential
[39:11] to god who's in heaven because now adam
[39:13] who reflected the highest in heaven when
[39:15] he was
[39:16] adam is now reflecting the highest in
[39:18] heaven when he's now husband
[39:22] and verse 24 as we continue therefore
[39:23] shall a man leave
[39:25] his father and his mother and shall
[39:28] cleave unto his wife
[39:30] and they shall be one flesh
[39:35] adam had been used for man prior to this
[39:37] but now therefore shall in
[39:38] ish a man each husband leave his father
[39:41] and his mother and shall cleave unto his
[39:43] wife
[39:44] isha husband and wife
[39:48] in the beginning when god created man in
[39:49] his image and after his likeness he says
[39:51] male and female created he them so
[39:54] that's a reference to gender that could
[39:56] be referred to as even adam
[39:58] as a man mankind there was male in
[40:00] representation there's female
[40:02] uh hidden as a mystery inside of him but
[40:04] male and female
[40:06] are just genders that have an ultimate
[40:08] purpose and an ultimate expression
[40:10] so now it's just not adam and it's not
[40:12] just male and female but it's husband
[40:14] and wife
[40:18] because male and female are made to be
[40:19] husband and wife
[40:22] god had a specific purpose in them in
[40:23] the beginning
[40:25] it's setting forth god's image an image
[40:27] something that god is reflecting
[40:29] and you talk about a very uh
[40:32] weighty and significant scripture
[40:36] therefore a man here is he is adam
[40:39] before he goes to sleep
[40:41] he wakes up and now he's ish could you
[40:43] imagine going to sleep and some
[40:44] if you want to claim it brothers go
[40:46] ahead you go to sleep ellie and you wake
[40:48] up in the morning your husband
[40:50] i mean how awesome is that talk about an
[40:52] eliezer you didn't have to try
[40:57] and so he wakes up and he's not just a
[40:58] man he's a husband
[41:02] there's something been changed about him
[41:04] and so now notice the rich language that
[41:06] comes forth in this very significant
[41:07] scripture
[41:08] a woman is brought forth from the rib of
[41:10] man he makes a woman an isha
[41:12] from adam's rib and now she is essence
[41:15] of his essence self of his self
[41:16] she was taken out of the husband she his
[41:18] wife husband and wife and now he says
[41:21] that a man a husband shall leave his
[41:24] father and his mother
[41:28] this is the first time fathers mention
[41:29] ab the head or founder of a household
[41:33] the head or founder of a family it comes
[41:35] from the word the producer the generator
[41:39] so now already adam as he prophesies is
[41:41] expressing something essential to the
[41:43] character of god
[41:44] god is not just going to have male and
[41:46] female
[41:48] but he's going to have husband and wife
[41:50] but it's not just going to be husband
[41:51] and wife it's got to be father and
[41:52] mother
[41:55] because there's there's something that's
[41:57] unfolding about god as this is as this
[41:59] is being expressed a man shall leave his
[42:01] arm his father the producer the
[42:02] generator in other words god here
[42:04] already is envisioning a family
[42:06] not just a man and a woman not just a
[42:08] man not just a man and a woman but a
[42:09] family
[42:10] because mother there's m and the word
[42:14] actually literally means point
[42:15] of departure or division
[42:20] now this is something that would deserve
[42:22] a lot of attention
[42:24] but now that a man and a woman come
[42:28] together and he becomes father she
[42:30] becomes mother
[42:30] she becomes the point of departure
[42:33] through which a son
[42:34] establishes a new family and a new
[42:36] family identity
[42:39] and so it could be said about any one of
[42:41] us but somebody could say well he
[42:42] look at look at as my sons grow
[42:45] or my daughter goes they say well he
[42:47] looks just like a mcgeary
[42:49] and they would be referring to my family
[42:51] they wouldn't be talking about my
[42:52] brother david
[42:53] i hope not
[42:56] right because why the family identity
[43:00] has changed
[43:01] because there's a representation of
[43:03] mcgeary in david and leslie mcgiri and
[43:05] that's what a magiri looks like and
[43:07] amigiri acts like and that's why you
[43:09] pray very hard for a new birth and you
[43:11] can see a certain representation
[43:12] there in that family but then once the
[43:15] man
[43:15] marries a another woman the child of
[43:18] that
[43:18] changes the dynamics of that family
[43:22] it has a different expression as a
[43:23] different nature different uh nurture
[43:25] that's going to come forth and so
[43:26] there's when it says the woman is the
[43:28] point of departure
[43:29] she is another division and it doesn't
[43:32] have to be a tremendous variance as
[43:33] you'll see in the original it just would
[43:35] have produced another son of god in the
[43:36] same image
[43:37] but yet she becomes the point where
[43:39] sinus the birth of a son to a family
[43:41] it establishes a new family identity
[43:45] and this is something that god desired
[43:49] therefore shall a man leave his father
[43:51] and his mother
[43:56] in genesis chapter 3 verse 16 it says
[43:57] thou speaking of the woman thou shalt
[43:59] bring forth
[44:00] children because now that she's mother
[44:03] she's this
[44:04] this point of departure where another
[44:05] branch it's like a branch coming off
[44:07] don't when you think a point of
[44:08] departure or division don't think
[44:10] something being cut off or
[44:11] or variance it's just another branch
[44:15] through that mother comes another branch
[44:17] of a tree through the mother because
[44:19] another point of departure from the same
[44:20] tree the same life
[44:21] now it establishes another branch off of
[44:23] that with children it's exactly how you
[44:24] draw the tree up the family tree up amen
[44:27] it's through these unions so the woman
[44:29] shall bring forth
[44:30] children that word there is bane it's
[44:33] sun
[44:34] and in the hebrew son means the builder
[44:36] of the family name
[44:39] because you have the father who has a
[44:40] name then through the wife she becomes
[44:42] mother
[44:43] and a son comes forth and now he's a
[44:45] multiplication of the father therefore
[44:46] he's a builder of the family name he's
[44:49] an expression of the family character
[44:52] thou shalt bring forth a son thou shalt
[44:53] bring forth children
[44:55] so this is what's being expressed here
[44:57] you have a man who leaves father and
[44:59] mother and cleaves to his wife
[45:01] and they shall be one flesh
[45:05] and we'll just i'm just trying to look
[45:06] at where we are and just how much time
[45:08] we're going to have here
[45:10] now that scripture shows to us
[45:16] in one sense you could say spiritually
[45:17] that adam's prophesying that he leaves
[45:19] father god and even mother garden of
[45:21] eden
[45:22] to follow his wife out in sin
[45:26] so he came from god as a spirit being he
[45:27] came from the earth mother earth
[45:29] as a as a fleshly being and he forsook
[45:31] the garden of eden he forsook his
[45:33] relationship with god
[45:34] to join to his wife so that she would
[45:36] escape punishment to portray christ
[45:38] but there's a family picture being
[45:40] expressed here it says for this
[45:42] cause a man shall leave
[45:45] his father and mother so it paints a
[45:47] picture where there's a man
[45:49] who has a father and a man who has a
[45:52] mother
[45:53] and he now as a son marries and he
[45:56] becomes husband
[45:58] and the woman becomes wife and now they
[46:00] have children
[46:02] and now they are father and mother and
[46:04] there's a son and it's just like a
[46:05] family tree or the the hierarchy of a
[46:07] family
[46:08] everything is branching down and that's
[46:11] the expression that's given in this
[46:14] so it says a man shall leave his father
[46:16] mother and cleave
[46:19] that means to be joined together to stay
[46:22] with
[46:22] to stick to so he's going to leave he's
[46:26] going to be joined to his wife
[46:28] and they shall become one flesh again
[46:30] that word the root word there and the
[46:31] word that's used as basar that
[46:33] publication
[46:33] they shall be one body they are now one
[46:36] expression
[46:38] one publication and so when this says
[46:42] for this cause shall a man leave his
[46:45] father and mother
[46:46] therefore shall a man leave his father
[46:48] and mother that they shall be
[46:49] one flesh it points to the purpose of
[46:52] the union it points to the purpose of
[46:54] being husband and wife
[46:55] you have male and female that's
[46:57] wonderful but male must become husband
[46:59] and female must become wife it's
[47:01] wonderful to be husband and wife but
[47:02] what god's desiring will is
[47:04] is that husband becomes father and wife
[47:06] becomes mother
[47:08] and i know that can be very difficult to
[47:10] those who are unable to have children
[47:12] or those who desire to have children
[47:13] it's very complicated but i love to
[47:15] mention this
[47:16] as a way of encouragement that when you
[47:18] go to the bible every single woman in
[47:20] the bible who was ever barren
[47:22] eventually conceived and had a child
[47:25] every single one
[47:27] now you might say well that's
[47:28] discouraging because i'm barren and i
[47:29] haven't had a child
[47:31] think about it god did not want to give
[47:35] one representation in the holy scripture
[47:38] of a barren woman who didn't conceive so
[47:41] that you wouldn't misappropriate your
[47:43] faith and say well i just must be her
[47:45] he made sure that every womb that was
[47:48] barren
[47:48] eventually conceived and brought forth
[47:50] life so that you would have no
[47:52] other place to plant your faith than a
[47:54] barren woman conceiving
[47:56] and being fruitful he wants you to
[47:58] believe for that he wants you to
[48:00] to look to that but we are looking to
[48:02] the the the ultimate purpose and the
[48:04] perfect image that god desired
[48:07] the purpose of the union was to produce
[48:09] another son in the image
[48:11] of the father and they too shall be
[48:15] one flesh how through the union
[48:20] when that son comes forth can the father
[48:23] claim it more his own than the mother
[48:27] it's just like solomon's saying a
[48:28] husband and wife they're getting a
[48:29] divorce they have one kid they're
[48:31] fighting over who gets possession of the
[48:32] kid
[48:33] and the and the king just the judge like
[48:34] i got it
[48:36] let's just cut him in half
[48:39] you can't do it it's one flesh
[48:43] so then in genesis chapter 3 verse 20
[48:45] this is very significant
[48:47] after the fall and woman has conceived
[48:50] not just of adam but of another seed
[48:52] adam called his wife's name
[48:54] eve why is the name changing because it
[48:58] changed adam's the one that names
[49:00] he's the one that gave names to all the
[49:02] animals he's the one that named woman
[49:04] capital w
[49:04] now she is woman because she's taken
[49:06] from men but now her relationship
[49:09] changes because now she's not just woman
[49:12] she's going to be mother
[49:14] and he changes her name but not his she
[49:17] becomes
[49:17] eve because she's the mother of all
[49:20] living
[49:22] and in that it speaks to what to what
[49:24] the fall was
[49:25] because now the family is broken
[49:29] in genesis chapter 2 verse 24 therefore
[49:31] shall a man leave
[49:32] his father and his mother that means the
[49:35] man is the product of the union
[49:36] of father and mother he is the
[49:38] expression of father and mother
[49:39] he is their genes he is their dna he is
[49:42] their nature
[49:43] he now comes and as a man he is to marry
[49:45] a woman and they're to be joined
[49:47] together they're to cleave together
[49:49] in there to be one flesh and so the
[49:51] child that's to be produced from them
[49:53] any sons that are come from them are to
[49:55] be of the man but now when eve becomes
[49:57] the mother of all living
[49:58] they are not all one flesh
[50:03] and that's when the image of god leaves
[50:05] adam because oneness is lost
[50:09] the family is broken we understand what
[50:11] the original sin was
[50:13] the children born the first child born
[50:16] to adam and the woman
[50:18] is not adam reproduced it's not one
[50:21] flesh
[50:23] there's been a this unity now that's
[50:25] been formed within the family
[50:26] and so now you have adam and the woman
[50:28] and the first son that comes forth is
[50:30] not of adam and the second son is so
[50:32] what do you create
[50:33] you've created a hybrid you've created a
[50:35] mixture
[50:39] so the creation of god was no longer in
[50:41] the perfect reflection of heaven
[50:44] the original held the image adam held
[50:46] the image of male and female
[50:48] and in that image he was commanded to be
[50:50] fruitful and multiply
[50:52] to fulfill god's commandment they had to
[50:53] become man and wife we're just trying to
[50:56] recap this so you follow
[50:57] where i'm going they had to become man
[50:59] and wife that's a family
[51:02] man and woman together as a family and
[51:04] then bri
[51:05] the bringing forth of children would be
[51:06] the completed image
[51:08] why because you would see a cycle of
[51:10] life
[51:12] you'd see a cycle of the image being
[51:14] reproduced you have god the father
[51:15] who brings forth the son brings forth
[51:17] the daughter and now god now adam and
[51:20] the woman to bring forth the sun they
[51:21] would bring forth the daughter
[51:22] there was a way of multiplication where
[51:25] now this would be replicated over and
[51:26] over until the purpose of the earth is
[51:28] complete and finished
[51:30] i don't know perhaps we'll rely on a lot
[51:32] of things that have already been said
[51:33] but it would have been a cycle of
[51:34] reproduction
[51:35] according to the law of god's
[51:36] reproduction so then you have male and
[51:39] female
[51:39] now it's man and woman and the woman was
[51:41] to become a further expression of this
[51:43] image
[51:44] and then children would be the completed
[51:46] image and the cycle would begin again
[51:50] but this perfect picture is marred
[51:57] and the perfect picture before sin
[52:00] marred the image
[52:02] was a family that's it that's what it
[52:05] was
[52:06] husband and wife as god's children
[52:10] father god adam a son the woman
[52:14] a daughter brother bram says in the
[52:16] identified masterpiece of god
[52:18] let us turn our thoughts from
[52:19] michelangelo understand the parallel
[52:21] he's drawing now michelangelo created
[52:22] this masterpiece of moses
[52:24] he said to the great sculptor oh my god
[52:26] almighty who in the beginning before
[52:28] there was a day or dawn of day
[52:30] for there was an atom of or molecule god
[52:32] in his mind had
[52:33] man what a man should look like what he
[52:36] should be and what he should act like
[52:38] and he wanted that man to be a part of
[52:39] him so he made man in his own image and
[52:42] in the likeness of god created he man
[52:44] oh when god in the beginning made this
[52:48] masterpiece something that reflected his
[52:50] thoughts
[52:52] so we saw how creation evolved and even
[52:54] how adam was perfect but yet there were
[52:56] still things he could do to become
[52:58] more like god man has become as one of
[53:00] us lest he reach forth his hand and live
[53:01] forever let's stop him there
[53:03] so we see that he's a masterpiece now
[53:05] this then the masterpiece
[53:07] is a picture that's unfolding
[53:11] and a masterpiece it's a work that
[53:13] surpasses
[53:14] excellence but when i went and i found
[53:17] it in the original where we get the word
[53:19] masterpiece from is from dutch or german
[53:22] and it's a work by which a craftsman
[53:24] attains the rank of master
[53:27] so you could be a you could be a
[53:29] craftsman and you could do something and
[53:31] do something but finally one day
[53:33] you create something and by that work
[53:36] you were acknowledged as being the
[53:38] master
[53:40] you acknowledge as being the ultimate so
[53:41] this is when this brother
[53:43] says god he made this masterpiece this
[53:45] is something where
[53:46] god expresses his true craftsmanship
[53:50] his true excellence this is the work
[53:52] that exceeds everything else that had
[53:53] been done before in his creation that
[53:55] was good that was good this is very good
[53:56] but now god through adam god through
[53:59] each god through esau this is his
[54:02] masterpiece
[54:06] in genesis chapter 2 verse 25.
[54:10] because now this is the masterpiece
[54:15] is initially reflected in adam but now
[54:18] at the conclusion of chapter 2
[54:19] and they were both naked the man and his
[54:21] wife and were not
[54:23] ashamed this is the conclusion of god's
[54:27] creation
[54:28] not just one man but adam and his wife
[54:33] adam with his esha this this this wife
[54:35] that's with him
[54:36] so adam was a was the beginning of the
[54:39] masterpiece as the sculptor was bringing
[54:40] it forth but now notice
[54:42] this is a masterpiece man and wife
[54:45] so brother bam says in the message the
[54:47] masterpiece now we see them as a
[54:50] masterpiece family in the garden of eden
[54:54] how beautiful it was it so pleased him
[54:56] until he took rest then he said i'll
[54:57] rest
[54:58] but while he was resting and trusting to
[55:00] his masterpiece
[55:01] his enemy come in and found this great
[55:04] masterpiece
[55:05] now i read that to emphasize this
[55:07] broadband is calling the family unit
[55:10] husband and wife the masterpiece so it's
[55:13] not just a masterpiece
[55:14] man but it's the man and the woman
[55:16] together are the masterpiece and he's
[55:17] calling it a family
[55:19] and what he's expressing here is a
[55:21] particular arrest wherein god at the end
[55:23] of genesis chapter 2
[55:24] husband and wife are together as god a
[55:27] king and queen upon earth ruling in
[55:29] their domain
[55:30] and he says i'm going to leave it to
[55:32] hint them i've commanded them i've given
[55:33] them everything they need given the word
[55:35] i've created everything
[55:36] so now god is going to let them the word
[55:38] express
[55:39] itself and the word unfold that's the
[55:40] rest that brother brown's talking about
[55:41] he kind of just took a step back and he
[55:43] was going to let the word unfold
[55:44] and that's when satan came in and marred
[55:46] the masterpiece abraham uses this phrase
[55:49] notice the great masterpiece
[55:51] of the family it's in another place in
[55:52] masterpiece the great masterpiece what's
[55:54] the great masterpiece
[55:55] the family a few paragraphs later same
[55:58] message this masterpiece was walled by
[56:00] the word god's word
[56:01] and the masterpiece itself of the family
[56:04] was fortified
[56:05] by this word again i'm just using this
[56:09] to emphasize that
[56:10] brother branham identified the
[56:12] masterpiece
[56:13] not just adam but man and woman husband
[56:16] and wife family and they're walled by
[56:19] genesis 1 28-30
[56:21] right be fruitful multiply replenish the
[56:23] earth and subdue it and
[56:24] have dominion over the fish and all the
[56:26] living creatures and these things you
[56:27] can eat
[56:28] and this is the commandment that god
[56:30] gave them they're walled by the word
[56:33] now look in the bible at genesis chapter
[56:35] 2 verses 16 to 17
[56:37] or look over my shoulder at the screen
[56:39] behind me but genesis chapter 2
[56:41] verses 16 to 17 because this is part of
[56:44] the commandment that man has placed
[56:45] behind
[56:46] and the lord god commanded the man
[56:48] saying of every tree of the garden thou
[56:51] mayest freely eat
[56:53] this is the this is the wall of the word
[56:55] that they're behind but of the tree of
[56:57] the knowledge of good and evil
[56:59] thou shalt not eat of it for in the day
[57:01] that thou eat is thereof
[57:02] thou shalt surely die
[57:05] so a man receives a commandment when
[57:07] they're male and female spirit being
[57:09] genesis 1 28 to 30.
[57:10] now that he's in flesh because now he
[57:12] can actually eat
[57:14] and partake of these things he says of
[57:16] every tree of the garden thou mayest
[57:17] freely eat
[57:18] and now because he's in flesh in his
[57:20] certain physical attributes
[57:21] this next commandment becomes more
[57:23] relevant but of the tree of the
[57:25] knowledge of good and evil thou shalt
[57:26] not eat of it for the day that thou
[57:28] eatest thereof thou
[57:29] shalt surely die now it was in violating
[57:32] this
[57:33] that caused the fall now just think and
[57:36] i want to go quickly because i realize
[57:37] maybe for some
[57:38] i'm getting i'm getting passed past that
[57:41] alarm
[57:41] that alarm clock in their heads
[57:44] but the wrong what happened here is
[57:47] there was trees that they could eat from
[57:50] and there was trees that they weren't
[57:51] supposed to eat from
[57:53] so in the fall what happened the wrong
[57:56] tree was partaken from
[57:58] and it created the wrong branch or
[58:00] another tree
[58:02] in other words the wrong when they took
[58:04] of the tree of knowledge
[58:05] of good and evil it was the wrong family
[58:07] tree
[58:09] they were a tree they were family they
[58:11] were to branch off
[58:12] and remain one tree but now when they
[58:15] partook of the tree of knowledge and
[58:16] good and evil
[58:17] it's a different family tree because
[58:19] look in the scripture
[58:20] trees do what yield fruit after its kind
[58:22] this is the law of reproduction genesis
[58:24] 1 11
[58:25] a tree is to yield fruit after its kind
[58:28] in genesis chapter 1 verse 29 it says a
[58:31] tree
[58:31] yielding seed trees trees yield seed
[58:36] trees having seed will yield seed and
[58:38] bring forth fruit
[58:39] so when they partook of the tree of
[58:41] knowledge of good and evil
[58:42] it was a mixing of family trees
[58:45] and what dude what did it do it produced
[58:47] a hybrid
[58:49] and so this is wherein the fall takes
[58:51] place they were wall behind the word as
[58:53] a tree
[58:54] bring forth of your kind but now that
[58:56] the tree of knowledge of good and evil
[58:57] just speaks of the wrong kind of tree
[59:01] now just think of it whether you just
[59:03] want to take this symbolically
[59:06] when god wanted to multiply adam he took
[59:09] his rib
[59:13] genesis chapter 2 verses 22
[59:17] and there was a law of reproduction
[59:18] genesis 1 11 that a tree
[59:20] adam as a tree he has
[59:23] seed within himself he has something in
[59:26] himself
[59:26] that can bring forth of its kind god
[59:28] took the rib and was able to take a body
[59:31] and make it and put the woman in it
[59:34] when he takes the rib remember that it
[59:36] means a beam or plank of wood
[59:39] and the very same word of rib is used
[59:42] as of a beam which comes from wood which
[59:45] is a tree
[59:47] in first kings chapter six you'll find
[59:49] that it's the word ribbons uses
[59:51] boards of cedar which represent purity
[59:54] in planks of fur
[59:55] which represents nobility so there was
[59:58] this purity there was this nobility in
[1:00:01] the rib
[1:00:01] there this was it's spoken of a beam
[1:00:04] spoken of a plank of wood that
[1:00:05] represents purity and nobility
[1:00:08] and genesis 2 17 refers to a tree
[1:00:12] and that word for tree it means wood
[1:00:14] timber plank
[1:00:16] so listen i'm not trying to get
[1:00:18] complicated here i just want you to
[1:00:19] think very
[1:00:20] how the scriptures back up time and time
[1:00:22] again what happened in genesis chapter
[1:00:24] three
[1:00:24] what happened is the wrong building
[1:00:26] materials were used
[1:00:28] to make a sun do not eat of the tree of
[1:00:32] knowledge of good and evil a tree which
[1:00:33] has
[1:00:34] fruit after its kind a tree which is
[1:00:36] yielding seed do not use the wood and
[1:00:39] timber
[1:00:39] of another tree do not use of different
[1:00:41] building materials of good and evil that
[1:00:43] word their evil just means
[1:00:44] not agreeable don't mix don't bring them
[1:00:48] together
[1:00:49] it mix the family tree
[1:00:52] and that's where the fall was
[1:00:55] but the original masterpiece walled
[1:00:57] behind the word of genesis 1 28 genesis
[1:00:59] 2 16-17
[1:01:00] it was a family bill graham continuing
[1:01:03] the masterpiece the great sculptor when
[1:01:04] he seen the fall of his family
[1:01:06] the masterpiece he wasn't willing to
[1:01:08] leave it lay there face down and ruin
[1:01:10] he went to work immediately to build it
[1:01:13] up again
[1:01:14] he wasn't willing that it should perish
[1:01:16] and lay there like that all the time
[1:01:17] because he's god and he will not be
[1:01:19] defeated
[1:01:21] so what is he going to bring back his
[1:01:23] family
[1:01:24] he's not willing to leave the
[1:01:25] masterpiece of his family laying their
[1:01:27] face down
[1:01:28] because he's god and he will not be
[1:01:30] defeated so he went to work immediately
[1:01:31] he began to build again
[1:01:33] unto his own image
[1:01:37] so what he what he's going to redeem is
[1:01:38] his image
[1:01:40] now i'm going to go quickly through a
[1:01:42] few of these quotes here and identified
[1:01:44] masterpiece of god
[1:01:46] he beca he talks about how the prophets
[1:01:49] were
[1:01:49] a reflection they were the foundation
[1:01:50] but then when christ comes he's the
[1:01:52] expressed image
[1:01:53] once again you he's seen his own
[1:01:55] reflection when one man was born on
[1:01:57] earth from the womb of a
[1:01:58] woman that was god's masterpiece
[1:02:00] remember adam at one point was god's
[1:02:02] masterpiece
[1:02:03] it was the son of god jesus christ the
[1:02:06] reason he was because he was perfectly
[1:02:08] the word
[1:02:08] in the beginning was the word and the
[1:02:09] word was with god and the word was god
[1:02:11] and the word was made flesh and dwelt
[1:02:12] among us
[1:02:13] skipping to paragraph 84. now we find
[1:02:15] that it reflected him perfectly
[1:02:17] the sculptor now had the word reflected
[1:02:19] in the masterpiece again
[1:02:21] called his son god emmanuel
[1:02:24] what god wasn't just going to leave it
[1:02:25] there the masterpiece we find him
[1:02:28] the entire handiwork of god we find him
[1:02:31] the perfect reflection of the word
[1:02:33] for he was the word the fullness of the
[1:02:35] word now again god
[1:02:36] has the perfect masterpiece again and
[1:02:39] i'll just read these spots he says
[1:02:40] my masterpiece behold my servant my
[1:02:42] masterpiece there he is in his own image
[1:02:44] reflecting god
[1:02:46] reflected in the masterpiece in his own
[1:02:48] likeness
[1:02:49] god back again in his own likeness the
[1:02:51] word form being reflected in the image
[1:02:53] of a man
[1:02:54] the masterpiece paragraph 70 all the
[1:02:57] prophets had flaws all the ones was a
[1:02:59] portion
[1:03:00] but here at the last coming up through
[1:03:01] finally comes the masterpiece the
[1:03:03] perfect one
[1:03:04] no fault in him at all so perfect
[1:03:06] reflected of the builder himself
[1:03:08] in his own image was reflected in his
[1:03:09] work god and christ
[1:03:11] are one in so much until he put his own
[1:03:13] spirit into him and even the image and
[1:03:15] the builder became one
[1:03:17] god and his sculpture work his
[1:03:20] masterpiece
[1:03:22] wow this is what god makes god
[1:03:26] who he is
[1:03:29] but remember it's not just the man
[1:03:32] that's the masterpiece because he was
[1:03:35] just a reflection of the highest in
[1:03:36] heaven
[1:03:37] but in ephesians chapter 3 verses 14 and
[1:03:40] 15
[1:03:41] for this cause i bow my knees into the
[1:03:43] father of our lord jesus christ
[1:03:45] of whom the whole family in heaven and
[1:03:48] earth is named
[1:03:51] there's a reflections there's got to be
[1:03:52] a reflection on earth of family
[1:03:54] just as there is in heaven and i'll say
[1:03:57] this because
[1:03:58] i'm hoping i can finish what i have
[1:03:59] before me this morning but if not
[1:04:01] let me say this your earthly family is a
[1:04:03] reflection of a heavenly family
[1:04:06] for this cause i bow my knees unto the
[1:04:08] father the generator
[1:04:09] the male ancestor so now god is the
[1:04:12] father bowman is to the father
[1:04:14] the generator the father of who the lord
[1:04:16] jesus christ
[1:04:17] he's the son so what's coming into view
[1:04:19] the family again
[1:04:21] just as he had father god and adam the
[1:04:23] son of god now the very image is coming
[1:04:26] back again the father the generator the
[1:04:27] male ancestor law of the lord jesus
[1:04:29] christ the son the builder of the family
[1:04:31] name
[1:04:31] says of whom the whole family in heaven
[1:04:34] and earth is named
[1:04:35] of whom and i was just studying this
[1:04:37] recently and i found that there's
[1:04:38] actually
[1:04:39] a big theological controversy over who
[1:04:41] the whom is
[1:04:44] and i thought it was interesting because
[1:04:45] really either way it's the same name
[1:04:47] amen it's coming from the same essence
[1:04:50] it's it's they're one either way it's
[1:04:52] the same name either way it's the same
[1:04:54] family
[1:04:55] whether you want to say it's of whom the
[1:04:57] whole family is named after our lord
[1:04:58] jesus christ or it's named after our
[1:05:00] father
[1:05:00] well who's the lord jesus christ named
[1:05:02] after amen
[1:05:04] right i mean if a equals b and b
[1:05:08] equals c a we'll see it's it's the same
[1:05:10] in this
[1:05:12] what did god do he exalted him and gave
[1:05:14] him a name which is above all names
[1:05:16] the son is the builder of the family
[1:05:18] name it wasn't his
[1:05:19] own name but it was the god's name that
[1:05:21] was given to him
[1:05:23] jesus said in john 5 43 i come in my
[1:05:25] father's name
[1:05:27] so what did you come and he came in the
[1:05:29] name of his father it was his
[1:05:31] the lord jesus christ is the name of god
[1:05:33] the lord jesus christ is the name of
[1:05:34] him lord god is jesus christ
[1:05:38] that's his name he says if another shall
[1:05:40] come in his own name you'll receive him
[1:05:42] what does it mean to come in your own
[1:05:43] name no divine origin
[1:05:46] no passing down you have not gotten it
[1:05:48] from your father you have your own name
[1:05:50] it's of their own will
[1:05:51] it's not a name given but people just
[1:05:53] give themselves a name and people
[1:05:55] believe them i'm this i'm that i'm so
[1:05:56] and so eighth messenger i'm a prophet
[1:05:58] i'm the successor
[1:05:59] i'm jesus christ whatever and people
[1:06:01] believe that wasn't given to them by god
[1:06:06] but of whom the whole family in heaven
[1:06:07] and earth is named
[1:06:10] beings are grouped together by
[1:06:11] relationship to their father and what
[1:06:13] happens
[1:06:13] they get a name even the tribes of
[1:06:16] israel
[1:06:16] bore the names of the father the
[1:06:18] progenitor the beginning of that tribe
[1:06:20] the children of who israel
[1:06:24] they're grouped together by their
[1:06:25] originator by their father
[1:06:28] so by whom when it says the family is
[1:06:30] named it derives its origin
[1:06:33] and being from god the family in heaven
[1:06:35] earth derives its origin
[1:06:36] from god just as children derive their
[1:06:38] name from their father
[1:06:39] the father of the family now i know
[1:06:43] different cultures that may be a little
[1:06:44] bit different but just bear with me as
[1:06:45] an american
[1:06:47] and god's only provided place of worship
[1:06:49] he had in his heart noticed this before
[1:06:51] the foundation of the world a son
[1:06:53] because he is a father now notice where
[1:06:55] the sun is
[1:06:56] but it was still in the genes of his
[1:06:58] word
[1:07:00] that's where the son was and he created
[1:07:02] a man
[1:07:03] and he put him on freemore agency but
[1:07:05] that man fell
[1:07:06] but the great sculptor god who made man
[1:07:09] from the dust of the earth he didn't
[1:07:10] settle for that he started making man
[1:07:12] again
[1:07:13] and he made noah he died drunk he made
[1:07:15] moses that failed to keep his word he
[1:07:16] made prophets that run in the time of
[1:07:17] trouble he kept building and molding
[1:07:19] until after a while
[1:07:20] he wanted a masterpiece to reflect him
[1:07:23] his nature
[1:07:24] what was in his heart what a son should
[1:07:27] be
[1:07:29] what should a son be he is the father
[1:07:32] again
[1:07:32] that's why jesus expressed oneness
[1:07:34] that's why he talked to god as his
[1:07:35] father
[1:07:36] this is what god had in his mind in the
[1:07:37] beginning he didn't want to just have a
[1:07:39] family he wanted to become a family he
[1:07:41] wanted to become a father in order for
[1:07:43] him to become a father
[1:07:44] he had to become a son but it's god be
[1:07:47] coming
[1:07:49] what a son should be one day down on
[1:07:51] jordan after that masterpiece had been
[1:07:53] formed and made
[1:07:54] here he comes sending down on the wings
[1:07:56] of a dove this is him
[1:07:58] he was so enthused with this masterpiece
[1:08:00] until he struck him on calvary that he
[1:08:02] would die for the rest of us was
[1:08:03] imperfect
[1:08:04] that through the shedding of his blood
[1:08:06] listen he might bring
[1:08:08] many masterpieces being a bride to
[1:08:11] his son he had to take the masterpiece
[1:08:14] and strike a blow in his side and take a
[1:08:17] rib the beam the plank the building
[1:08:19] material
[1:08:20] from the same family tree and bring
[1:08:22] forth many sons
[1:08:24] the bible says in bringing many sons
[1:08:26] into glory
[1:08:27] the bible says for whom he did for no he
[1:08:29] also predestined to be conformed
[1:08:31] to the image of his son that he might be
[1:08:34] the firstborn
[1:08:35] among many brethren
[1:08:38] that word their brethren is
[1:08:41] a delphos
[1:08:44] and a is the the the prefix
[1:08:48] a which means joined and delphas which
[1:08:51] is
[1:08:51] womb so what does that mean if you're
[1:08:55] brethren
[1:08:56] you were joined in the womb
[1:08:59] same originator same genes
[1:09:04] the first born among many brethren that
[1:09:06] means you have to come from the same
[1:09:08] womb jesus christ came from
[1:09:09] he said what do you mean mary no the
[1:09:11] womb of the word amen
[1:09:13] the spoken word of god amen you have to
[1:09:16] come from that same mind the same place
[1:09:18] that jesus
[1:09:18] i come from god i go to god your
[1:09:21] brethren you share this unity whom he
[1:09:23] did for no he predestined to be
[1:09:24] conformed
[1:09:25] to the image of his son that he might be
[1:09:27] the firstborn among what
[1:09:29] many masterpieces
[1:09:32] to his son he predestines you to be
[1:09:36] conformed that word the greek word is
[1:09:37] sumorphos
[1:09:39] which means what is the essence and
[1:09:40] character thus it is complete
[1:09:42] and durable not just a form or an
[1:09:45] outline
[1:09:46] when you've been predestined to be
[1:09:47] conformed you're not just in the
[1:09:49] likeness you do not just resemble
[1:09:51] but you are the essence essence of his
[1:09:54] essence
[1:09:55] substance of his substance life of his
[1:09:57] life power of his power
[1:09:59] he has predestined you to be the very
[1:10:02] essence of the sun
[1:10:03] the very life of the sun the very power
[1:10:05] of the sun
[1:10:07] this is what the scriptures teach us
[1:10:09] that he might be the firstborn
[1:10:11] among many brethren why he was the image
[1:10:14] of what a son
[1:10:15] should be and god wanted more brother
[1:10:18] man said god
[1:10:19] foresaw and predestinated a world of
[1:10:21] sons and daughters
[1:10:23] this is what god saw he saw and
[1:10:26] predestinated a world of sons and
[1:10:28] daughters
[1:10:30] and he connects it with the commission
[1:10:31] of genesis 1 28
[1:10:33] gone to the beginning commissioned adam
[1:10:34] and eve to multiply and replenish the
[1:10:35] earth
[1:10:36] says now in this god foresaw and
[1:10:38] predestinated a world of sons and
[1:10:40] daughters
[1:10:42] james chapter 1 verse 18 of his own will
[1:10:46] beget he us with the word of truth
[1:10:49] that which should be a kind of first
[1:10:51] fruits of his creatures
[1:10:53] what is james referring to himself now
[1:10:56] christ was the firstborn
[1:10:57] now james being born again by the word
[1:10:59] of god says we're the beginning of the
[1:11:01] next masterpiece
[1:11:03] we're the we're kind of the first fruits
[1:11:05] of his creation
[1:11:06] because it's not just a man jesus christ
[1:11:08] now it's a
[1:11:10] family this is what's being reflected
[1:11:13] now i'm only going to share these
[1:11:14] statements very quickly here
[1:11:16] to to emphasize this to
[1:11:19] because we've we emphasized the bride
[1:11:21] part but we mentioned last time it's got
[1:11:23] to become more individual and more
[1:11:24] personal
[1:11:25] so brother bam says in the masterpiece
[1:11:27] now we could go on with that but i
[1:11:28] believe you have a picture of what i
[1:11:30] mean
[1:11:30] god building back his masterpiece but
[1:11:33] let us not forget that in the beginning
[1:11:34] when he smote the side of adam
[1:11:37] because we could see adam and now christ
[1:11:40] the first man the second man the last
[1:11:42] adam first man's a living soul the
[1:11:43] second man's a quickening spirit
[1:11:44] he's like don't just stop with christ
[1:11:46] the masterpiece he says now
[1:11:49] the smiting of christ was for a cause
[1:11:51] that he might take from him
[1:11:53] one to be a family the bride
[1:11:56] he might take him a bride so when his
[1:11:58] masterpiece was perfected
[1:12:00] then he had to smite it to take from him
[1:12:02] not another piece not another creation
[1:12:04] but of the same creation it's the same
[1:12:06] material
[1:12:07] it's the rib it's the beam it's the
[1:12:09] plank it's the same family tree
[1:12:13] paragraph 157 he's going to bring this
[1:12:15] little bride that's smitten right back
[1:12:17] to the side of the original word
[1:12:18] and there he is there's the masterpiece
[1:12:21] the family
[1:12:22] back again in the garden of eden
[1:12:24] paragraph 174 the great masterpiece of
[1:12:27] the family
[1:12:28] the second adam and the second eve now
[1:12:31] ready for the garden
[1:12:34] now this catch the language that he's
[1:12:35] using then it's the masterpiece of the
[1:12:38] family again
[1:12:41] that family had been broken now god's
[1:12:44] bringing it back he's someone in the
[1:12:46] form
[1:12:46] of a bride to the son christ so you have
[1:12:49] god
[1:12:50] with the son and now you have many sons
[1:12:52] and daughters that he might be the
[1:12:53] firstborn among many brethren
[1:12:54] and you see that now god's becoming more
[1:12:56] than just christ
[1:12:58] he's becoming in his family of sons and
[1:13:00] daughters
[1:13:01] that he foresaw and predestinated to be
[1:13:03] essence of his essence
[1:13:05] to be the essence in character not just
[1:13:08] to form an outline
[1:13:09] but the but it the way brother branham
[1:13:12] said it's perfect
[1:13:12] she is him
[1:13:17] and let me say this then to make it
[1:13:19] personal
[1:13:21] family even in a natural way
[1:13:24] is a reflection of god's first
[1:13:26] masterpiece
[1:13:29] it's part as sons and daughters of god
[1:13:32] come forth
[1:13:32] and they are the further furthering of
[1:13:35] the beginning of the creation of god
[1:13:36] now we as a family are part of the
[1:13:38] creation of god
[1:13:40] we have a role to play that we're facing
[1:13:42] the completion of that word spiritually
[1:13:44] as the bride
[1:13:45] we're fulfilling god's desire to become
[1:13:47] a family
[1:13:49] but that's that's the ultimate
[1:13:52] but how do we achieve that there's
[1:13:55] something that god's doing in us
[1:13:56] naturally to bring us to that
[1:13:58] the supernatural becoming flesh uh well
[1:14:01] in
[1:14:01] us bill braun says in the message
[1:14:03] identification i've got two quotes on
[1:14:05] this slide
[1:14:07] i if it would encourage you just to kind
[1:14:08] of find that unction
[1:14:10] maybe to to wake up
[1:14:16] i'm here and this is the end and that's
[1:14:19] just a few inches we're almost there
[1:14:23] really without context that means
[1:14:24] nothing because i could preach an hour
[1:14:25] on what's there
[1:14:27] but identification brother says the
[1:14:29] whole thing is
[1:14:30] god becoming material
[1:14:34] that's what's happening it's the rib
[1:14:37] it's a materialization
[1:14:38] it's god becoming these things unfolding
[1:14:40] but then he says like a husband and wife
[1:14:42] becoming one together
[1:14:44] god and his church becoming one so
[1:14:47] that's the spiritual that's the
[1:14:48] supernatural we can say that's the
[1:14:50] ultimate if you're part of that that's
[1:14:51] the ultimate
[1:14:52] but then god also wants a reflection of
[1:14:54] it now
[1:14:55] in a husband and wife that's god
[1:14:57] becoming material
[1:14:59] and sirs we would see jesus it's god
[1:15:01] becoming tangible
[1:15:02] your own wife you and your husband is
[1:15:05] just a shadow and a negative of god and
[1:15:07] his wife the church
[1:15:09] so you are then the negative not in
[1:15:13] in a photographic sense
[1:15:16] not a negative in a good versus evil
[1:15:18] sense but you're the negative in others
[1:15:19] god is taking the picture and you're the
[1:15:22] picture
[1:15:23] you're the negative and what god wants
[1:15:24] to do is he wants to bring that image to
[1:15:26] a place
[1:15:27] where he can develop the picture into
[1:15:30] his image
[1:15:31] where you can express a relationship as
[1:15:34] a man to a woman
[1:15:35] as husband to wife and a husband love
[1:15:38] his wife as christ loves the church
[1:15:39] and the wife references her husband as
[1:15:41] the church references christ
[1:15:43] and they become a family as god desires
[1:15:46] himself to be a family
[1:15:49] you realize your relationships mean
[1:15:50] something
[1:15:52] whether they just with the relationships
[1:15:54] we have in the church relationships we
[1:15:55] have with our neighbor
[1:15:56] the relationship we have with our wife
[1:15:58] and to our children to our spouse
[1:15:59] they mean something the condition of the
[1:16:03] family the order of the family means
[1:16:05] something
[1:16:08] it all has meaning otherwise the bible
[1:16:10] wouldn't teach about it
[1:16:12] the bible would be very very short but
[1:16:14] this bible from the very beginning is
[1:16:16] dealing with relationships
[1:16:18] from the very beginning it's a family
[1:16:21] and the family dynamics
[1:16:22] and what unfolds and the and the mixing
[1:16:24] in the family and everything's related
[1:16:25] to a brother aaron it's people they're
[1:16:27] part of family this is what's expressed
[1:16:28] then you say well it's kind of a big dub
[1:16:30] well that's just all done together
[1:16:32] but that's what's being portrayed
[1:16:33] relationships families disagreements
[1:16:35] findings and then when god calls abram
[1:16:37] what does he call me says i see it and i
[1:16:38] see it after
[1:16:39] and the old testament becomes all about
[1:16:41] what a man in his family
[1:16:45] god is expressing something in this
[1:16:48] ephesians 3 15 of whom the whole family
[1:16:52] in heaven and earth is named the
[1:16:56] every family in heaven the whole family
[1:16:57] in heaven
[1:16:59] there's a family in heaven so god has
[1:17:02] set a pattern in heaven of a family
[1:17:05] there's order there's arrangement
[1:17:06] there's responsibilities
[1:17:08] there's duties there's relationships
[1:17:10] among the different angels there
[1:17:11] there's all sorts of responsibilities in
[1:17:13] this great tabernacle in heaven and so
[1:17:15] there's a family in heaven with order
[1:17:17] and an arrangement of hosts and when one
[1:17:19] got out of order what did it cause a
[1:17:20] fall and it's cast down to earth and
[1:17:22] then we see the same thing reflecting
[1:17:23] itself here but there is a family in
[1:17:25] heaven
[1:17:26] named after the lord jesus christ and
[1:17:28] therefore your family on earth
[1:17:30] has a divine appointment and a divine
[1:17:32] anointment
[1:17:33] to manifest god on earth
[1:17:37] we say well i'm in the likeness we're
[1:17:38] just deranged i'm the father i had a son
[1:17:40] through my wife so
[1:17:41] we're just by name and by dna where
[1:17:44] family know look beyond
[1:17:45] just the carnal natural arrangement of
[1:17:48] having a children
[1:17:49] and living in the same house and sharing
[1:17:51] a mortgage or whatever it might be
[1:17:52] but i want you to realize that as a
[1:17:54] believer as a son and daughter of god
[1:17:56] you have a divine appointment
[1:18:00] but don't just look at it as well i've
[1:18:02] been called to do this i've been called
[1:18:03] this but you've been anointed to do it
[1:18:05] there is provision to make it in that
[1:18:08] placing
[1:18:11] your family on earth is called to
[1:18:14] reflect the highest in heaven
[1:18:16] it's called to be a representation of
[1:18:18] that family in heaven but god will also
[1:18:20] give you what you need to manifest his
[1:18:22] image
[1:18:24] and i believe in this age the climax of
[1:18:26] god's creation
[1:18:28] is going to be expressed in families
[1:18:29] under the word
[1:18:32] families becoming the word token
[1:18:33] families third pool families
[1:18:38] and that doesn't mean we've memorized
[1:18:40] all the songs out of trinidad or it
[1:18:41] doesn't mean that we could type
[1:18:42] everything about the seventh hill but it
[1:18:44] means we live the life
[1:18:45] amen the life lived by the word would be
[1:18:48] the word expressed
[1:18:49] is the if the third pool is the word of
[1:18:51] god unfolding the word of god being made
[1:18:53] manifest it's the word
[1:18:54] full word being born into manifestation
[1:18:56] then a life lived by that
[1:18:58] is the expression of it
[1:19:01] so brother banner makes this statement
[1:19:03] this is where i'm closing
[1:19:05] the musicians would come
[1:19:08] and the masterpiece paragraph 176 you'll
[1:19:12] see there's
[1:19:13] maybe a tight grouping of a lot of these
[1:19:15] statements
[1:19:16] he says notice the great masterpiece of
[1:19:19] the family
[1:19:22] what we saw in the beginning
[1:19:25] in the beginning god created a family
[1:19:28] and then in the beginning of the
[1:19:30] creation of god what would it be again
[1:19:32] a family yeah that's what it would have
[1:19:34] to be
[1:19:36] it's another family so the great
[1:19:38] masterpiece is the family
[1:19:40] the husband and wife cannot be truly a
[1:19:43] family
[1:19:43] unless they are one so there's something
[1:19:46] that's being expressed here
[1:19:48] that is beautiful that requires more
[1:19:52] time that we'll
[1:19:52] we'll come back to it as the lord leads
[1:19:54] brother brown begins to describe what a
[1:19:56] masterpiece family is
[1:19:58] they're not truly a family unless
[1:19:59] they're one they have to be if they're
[1:20:01] not they're not a good family what's
[1:20:04] become
[1:20:04] a family tree of good and evil
[1:20:09] he says a wife pulling one way and the
[1:20:10] husband the other
[1:20:12] that would make an awful family you
[1:20:15] don't think this message deals with
[1:20:16] these things
[1:20:18] why is why is there such a a knee-jerk
[1:20:20] reaction for people
[1:20:22] to kind of put a scarlet letter on
[1:20:23] anybody that wants to preach or teach or
[1:20:25] do something for families
[1:20:28] i preached a sermon one time on the
[1:20:30] original marriage covenant and the
[1:20:31] restoration of the original marriage
[1:20:32] covenant
[1:20:33] and i was making the point that it's we
[1:20:35] always get out of that he can she can't
[1:20:37] and so the guy always has this card in
[1:20:38] the back of his pocket said
[1:20:39] i'm going to divorce you because i can
[1:20:40] get married again but you can't
[1:20:43] and i just you could see in the open of
[1:20:45] the word that god's restored us back to
[1:20:46] the original marriage covenant where
[1:20:47] there ought to be more of a nature of
[1:20:49] christ
[1:20:50] in men why did god grant a rid of
[1:20:52] divorce
[1:20:53] because the hard hearts of men that's
[1:20:55] why
[1:20:57] i gave you divorce because you men have
[1:20:58] hard hearts if god has turned our hearts
[1:21:00] maybe we could have softer hearts
[1:21:03] if you want to talk to me about it later
[1:21:04] i'm more than happy to talk about it but
[1:21:06] someone texts me said i'm listening to
[1:21:07] sermon you preached i'm really enjoying
[1:21:08] i'm like well how far into it are you
[1:21:11] he said 20 minutes i said well hold on
[1:21:12] you might change your mind because well
[1:21:14] i'm only listening to it because a
[1:21:15] brother
[1:21:16] told me to listen to it he hated it i
[1:21:18] said let me guess
[1:21:20] he's been married twice he goes twice
[1:21:23] looking for a third
[1:21:26] and so sometimes i wonder why people
[1:21:28] hate it when you bring things out of the
[1:21:29] word that talks about family
[1:21:33] don't hate it yield to it embrace it
[1:21:36] recognize it as part of god's word
[1:21:38] brother i'm preaching the masterpiece
[1:21:40] the masterpiece and he stops and he
[1:21:42] starts talking about the harmony
[1:21:43] within a family and he says but in
[1:21:45] agreement with love one to another
[1:21:48] that's a family and that's what it was
[1:21:51] in the beginning and that's what god
[1:21:52] desires in his church
[1:21:54] he says and that was god's masterpiece
[1:21:57] what was god's masterpiece a man and a
[1:21:58] woman together in agreement
[1:22:00] in love a family was god's masterpiece
[1:22:02] and he makes this beautiful statement
[1:22:04] and all the true family here portrays
[1:22:07] that
[1:22:08] and that beautifully brings it right
[1:22:10] down to where you're sitting today
[1:22:12] in this courtyard by marriott he brings
[1:22:14] it right down to husband wife father and
[1:22:17] mother
[1:22:17] that a family here portrays that family
[1:22:20] in the beginning
[1:22:21] and portrays the masterpiece family of
[1:22:23] christ and his bride
[1:22:25] sons and daughters of god all true
[1:22:27] family here portrays
[1:22:29] that and now the masterpiece family has
[1:22:32] come again christ and his bride ready to
[1:22:34] come
[1:22:35] the second adam the second eve ready now
[1:22:37] to return back to their home
[1:22:40] now before you get discouraged because
[1:22:42] we can look at families that are broken
[1:22:44] up
[1:22:45] listen the the the hurt that comes from
[1:22:48] family estrangement
[1:22:49] is so deep it
[1:22:52] it'll shatter one's emotions to the very
[1:22:55] core
[1:22:56] because when there's an estrangement
[1:22:57] with father and mother it comes right
[1:22:59] down to even the identity of the son
[1:23:02] the very ones that birth me the very
[1:23:04] ones that i bear the name of
[1:23:06] if they would be willing to do this and
[1:23:08] do that and we can't achieve harmony
[1:23:09] and we can't have forgiveness and we
[1:23:11] can't walk together that will break
[1:23:13] somebody down to the very essence of who
[1:23:15] they are as a natural person
[1:23:16] and bow them down to the earth
[1:23:20] and we have you've got broken families
[1:23:22] and sons that go wayward and daughters
[1:23:24] that don't
[1:23:24] that aren't in fellowship anymore and
[1:23:26] there's a lot of circumstances that
[1:23:27] intervene
[1:23:28] and then as we bring this picture up you
[1:23:29] can start oh a heart can be broken and
[1:23:31] you become discouraged but brother brown
[1:23:33] says the masterpiece family
[1:23:35] has come again
[1:23:38] and notice it was broken one time it got
[1:23:42] separated but god redeemed it
[1:23:44] so he says they're coming back to their
[1:23:46] home and the whole picture has been
[1:23:48] redemption
[1:23:49] from where it was bringing it back just
[1:23:51] exactly bringing it back again
[1:23:53] then if god brought that family back
[1:23:56] again then i believe god can bring your
[1:23:58] family
[1:23:59] back again that's a promise you can
[1:24:03] stand on
[1:24:04] it doesn't matter how long 25 years
[1:24:06] abraham wants to testify
[1:24:07] it doesn't matter how long noah wants to
[1:24:09] testify it doesn't matter if it seems
[1:24:10] like it's dead
[1:24:11] lazarus wants to testify god can bring
[1:24:14] it back
[1:24:16] why because it's about redemption i
[1:24:19] believe god can do it for you
[1:24:21] i believe he wants to do it for you
[1:24:25] and all you can do is your part and
[1:24:28] trust to him
[1:24:29] let's stand to our feet
[1:24:30] [Music]
[1:24:43] praise the lord
[1:24:45] [Music]
[1:24:47] if you have a need today
[1:24:51] i god has dealt with my heart to
[1:24:54] to take the subjects we've been
[1:24:56] ministering on even on wednesday nights
[1:24:59] and on sundays and it's just climax too
[1:25:03] this subject of a family pray for me as
[1:25:06] i desire just to follow the will of the
[1:25:07] lord
[1:25:08] to minister those things that will be
[1:25:09] edifying to you as a church
[1:25:11] not just make great material but
[1:25:14] something of substance to you
[1:25:16] god didn't just take any material of
[1:25:18] adam he took the rib
[1:25:19] because it represented something and
[1:25:21] those are the kind of things i want to
[1:25:23] express is something that can be built
[1:25:24] into something
[1:25:25] pure something noble so pray as god
[1:25:28] leads us as we continue
[1:25:31] but i believe coming to this will make
[1:25:33] it personally relevant for every single
[1:25:35] one of us
[1:25:36] whether you're a daughter or a son a
[1:25:39] husband or a wife a father a mother a
[1:25:41] grandparent
[1:25:42] or a member of a church there's
[1:25:44] something we can learn from this
[1:25:46] with their heads bowed i'd like to
[1:25:48] specifically pray
[1:25:50] if you'd want to lift your hands if
[1:25:52] there'd be someone that said lord i want
[1:25:54] my family to be one
[1:25:58] i don't want to be an awful family lord
[1:26:01] but lord give me the spirit and nature
[1:26:03] of christ to do my part
[1:26:05] to pull together with my husband to pull
[1:26:08] together with my wife
[1:26:10] in agreement and love to another he said
[1:26:12] that's a family
[1:26:14] and that's god's masterpiece and you say
[1:26:17] lord i want my family
[1:26:19] to portray that and if your hands are
[1:26:22] raised desiring that your family would
[1:26:24] portray that
[1:26:25] if there's anything broken in the
[1:26:27] relationships
[1:26:29] then i challenge you to take god in his
[1:26:31] word
[1:26:32] he's a redeemer he's a restorer
[1:26:35] he could bring prodigals back he can
[1:26:37] bring way ruins back he can mend things
[1:26:40] that are broken
[1:26:40] just commit it to him our gracious
[1:26:43] heavenly fathers we stand today
[1:26:45] as a bride as family as a local church
[1:26:48] that's a family a family with
[1:26:50] we call them sister churches gathered
[1:26:52] together
[1:26:54] lord we look to you now as a son of god
[1:26:57] as daughters of god
[1:26:59] and we come boldly before the throne of
[1:27:01] grace knowing
[1:27:02] that if a son would ask his father for
[1:27:05] an egg would he get a stone for his fish
[1:27:07] would he get a serpent no we could come
[1:27:09] asking knowing that you as our heavenly
[1:27:11] father
[1:27:12] are desirous to give us the right things
[1:27:14] [Music]
[1:27:15] and lord we ask today
[1:27:18] that if the climax of your creation was
[1:27:20] a family
[1:27:22] arranged by the word
[1:27:26] a family in agreement in harmony and
[1:27:28] love
[1:27:30] then i lay my pride down i lay my flesh
[1:27:32] down i lay my wants down
[1:27:34] and i make myself subject to that
[1:27:38] that my family could be in agreement be
[1:27:40] in harmony
[1:27:42] and be one lord i pray that our families
[1:27:46] here
[1:27:47] whether it be families of three or just
[1:27:48] a couple or a
[1:27:50] grandparent a father and mother lord
[1:27:52] whether it be a family of six seven
[1:27:54] twelve doesn't matter whatever it may be
[1:27:55] lord may our families
[1:27:57] even for any widows and widowers lord
[1:28:00] even those who
[1:28:01] are single lord may they portray christ
[1:28:05] so what do i do i'm a single man christ

[1:28:17] us to do
[1:28:17] our parts and let our relate let us
[1:28:20] express christ in our relationships
[1:28:22] let us remind ourselves that everyone we
[1:28:24] come in contact with we ought to treat
[1:28:26] them as if they're christ
[1:28:27] let us remind ourselves that it's
[1:28:29] eternal life to live for others

[1:28:57] walk in it lord bless your people today
[1:29:00] and as i before i say amen lord may i
[1:29:03] rehearse once again
[1:29:06] to believe in the power of redemption
[1:29:10] to never dealt to not fear
[1:29:14] but just as that father on a daily basis
[1:29:18] came and stood
[1:29:20] on a particular pace on a front porch
[1:29:24] knowing that if my son started his
[1:29:26] journey this morning
[1:29:27] this is about the time that he would
[1:29:29] come back
[1:29:31] if we have an expression in the parable
[1:29:33] of the father that was always looking
[1:29:35] for his wayward son to come back may we
[1:29:37] by eyes of faith look down that dusty
[1:29:39] road
[1:29:40] believing that one day we'll see them
[1:29:42] come
[1:29:44] may we not doubt or resist and certainly
[1:29:46] lord may we not get in the way with
[1:29:48] arrogance and judgment and harshness
[1:29:51] but may we become so sweet and salty so
[1:29:54] christ-like that it draws the christ out
[1:29:56] of them
[1:29:56] back to the word we commit this to you
[1:29:59] now father
[1:30:01] we love you we praise you lord bless
[1:30:04] your people
[1:30:06] in the name of the lord jesus christ we
[1:30:07] pray amen
