[0:00] I will raise them up a prophet from
[0:02] among their Brethren like unto thee and
[0:04] I will put my words in his mouth and he
[0:07] shall speak unto them all that I shall
[0:09] command him and it shall come to pass
[0:11] that whosoever will not arken unto my
[0:13] words which he shall speak in my name I
[0:16] will require it of him but the prophet
[0:18] which shall presume to speak a word in
[0:20] my name which I have not commanded him
[0:22] to speak or that shall speak in the name
[0:25] of other gods even that Prophet shall
[0:28] die and if thou say in thine heart how
[0:31] shall we know the word which the Lord
[0:34] hath not spoken when a prophet speaketh
[0:37] in the name of the Lord if the thing
[0:39] follow not nor come to pass that is the
[0:42] thing which the Lord hath not spoken but
[0:45] the prophet Prophet has spoken it
[0:48] presumptuously Thou shalt not be afraid
[0:51] of him May the blessing upon his word
[0:54] you can be seated amen praise the Lord
[1:00] I want to start on the prophet test and
[1:02] I hope to move quickly into the the the
[1:06] main topic this morning we're going to
[1:08] speak about the greatest
[1:11] purpose we've just read this scripture
[1:14] that was consider the prophet
[1:17] test so if a prophet speaks and he's
[1:22] he's he's whatever he says doesn't come
[1:24] to pass the Lord says I have not spoken
[1:28] right and it's been used many times as
[1:32] to try to to figure out to to vindicate
[1:35] is is a man a prophet or he's not and
[1:39] there is you know there's some
[1:41] controversies and especially lately and
[1:43] I feel Liberty to speak a little bit
[1:46] about it because I was here on Wednesday
[1:48] night and brother Aaron kind of
[1:49] mentioned it so I felt like uh it'd be
[1:52] okay so we had a little bit of a
[1:53] situation back home where people start
[1:55] questioning so was he really a prophet
[1:57] or did did everything he say fulfilled
[2:00] and is that set the Lord ever fail and
[2:03] and they go into that I call it a rabbit
[2:05] hole trying to study and try to
[2:08] investigate and try to go into path and
[2:10] try to dig the the archive and try to
[2:13] figure out can we trust this man or not
[2:15] and they put everything on this this
[2:17] this this scripture of
[2:20] infallibility right that he never made a
[2:22] mistake and if suddenly they think he
[2:23] made a mistake and and now you got to
[2:25] become a you got to become like a
[2:27] journalist an investigative journalist
[2:29] and you got to become an expert like a a
[2:32] bridge engineer and you got to become
[2:34] this and you got to become that trying
[2:35] to figure out if your faith is solid if
[2:37] was built on the right thing or not and
[2:40] and I and I feel that this this is a
[2:42] trap and I want to lace a couple of
[2:44] scriptures this morning as when we try
[2:47] to put everything on infallibility we
[2:49] missed the point yeah when we try to
[2:52] build our faith upon how a man was
[2:54] perfect we missed a point and when those
[2:56] people goes in that rabbit hole suddenly
[2:58] they want to disqualify a prophet but
[3:00] when they keep that same spirit and
[3:02] mindset then they're going to end up
[3:03] disqualifying the Bible because why how
[3:06] do you believe this Bible are you an
[3:08] archaeologist yeah have you discovered
[3:10] that Moses was really in Egypt yeah or
[3:13] they re erase all his record was he
[3:14] really there or did he did he wrote
[3:17] everything about what happened in isra
[3:19] in Egypt and all did he write it after
[3:21] the
[3:21] fact well yes he did and so you want to
[3:25] follow so did Abraham says they would
[3:27] surge in like 400 years maybe it was 43
[3:30] so was he right or wrong Y and what you
[3:32] want to follow that trail of trying to
[3:35] scientifically prove your faith it's
[3:38] it's a rabbit
[3:39] hole now the other test and brother you
[3:43] don't it's not it's okay if you keep the
[3:45] slides activated for me it's okay so the
[3:48] other the that uh uh when we're talk
[3:50] about a prophet uh it says here if
[3:53] there's arise among you a prophet or a
[3:55] dreamer of dreams and giveth thee a sign
[3:58] or a Wonder to sign of the one if and
[4:01] the sign or the Wonder come to pass
[4:03] whereof he spake unto thee saying let us
[4:06] go after other gods so now you have a
[4:08] man who makes a prophecy and it's
[4:13] fulfilled so if we use the first test is
[4:16] like if if he says something and it
[4:18] happens you should listen to him but now
[4:20] you got another scripture says if he
[4:22] says something and it happens now you
[4:24] got to listen what's the message behind
[4:26] the
[4:27] sign because that's also important what
[4:30] is he saying what is he pointing
[4:34] at and so here it looks like a
[4:38] trap because now you got a man who has a
[4:41] sign he has wonders and it's exactly
[4:44] like you
[4:45] know um how do you call it those two gbr
[4:49] um how do you say
[4:51] it yeah those two that went against
[4:54] Moses JJ JJ yeah JJ from Egypt but both
[4:59] of them did the same
[5:02] sign but their message were different
[5:05] yep those did the same sign but JJ's
[5:09] voice was stay in Egypt it's business as
[5:12] usual don't pay attention to that yeah
[5:14] they did a great sign we can do the same
[5:16] thing but the the voice behind the sign
[5:19] was remain as you are stay worthy yeah
[5:23] as Moses message is Lee come out of her
[5:26] my
[5:27] people there's a Promised Land amen and
[5:30] so here this other test it says the sign
[5:33] the Wonder come to pass whereever he
[5:35] spake unto thee saying let us go after
[5:36] other gods which thou Hast not known and
[5:39] let us serve them Thou shalt not aren
[5:41] unto the words of that Prophet or that
[5:43] dreamer dreams for the Lord your God
[5:45] proveth you to know whether ye love the
[5:48] Lord your God with all your heart and
[5:50] with all your soul amen ye shall walk
[5:54] after the the Lord your God and fear Him
[5:56] and keep his commandment and obey his
[5:58] voice and he shall serve him and cleave
[6:00] unto him and that Prophet or that
[6:02] dreamer of Dreams shall be put to death
[6:04] because he had spoken to turn you away
[6:07] from the Lord Our
[6:11] God and so just a fact that somebody
[6:16] didn't do any mistake in his prophecy
[6:19] does not totally vindicate him because
[6:22] you have to listen to what he's pointing
[6:28] at it's studying that topic lately
[6:31] because I was trying to help those
[6:32] people they were confused and they try
[6:34] to investigate and they try to know for
[6:36] sure and we got to study those things
[6:38] it's really important and I was I was
[6:40] trying to wrap my head around what's
[6:43] what's the thought and why why it they
[6:45] would be scandalized by that and I
[6:48] realized that their old premises was
[6:51] that they built on the infab
[6:54] infallibility of a man that he never
[6:56] make any mistake and everything is
[6:58] perfect and everybody got everybody got
[7:00] healed and suddenly it's like you know a
[7:03] castle Who falls apart because their
[7:06] faith was not built on the right thing
[7:08] and in studying that I came I was I was
[7:11] working with another Pastor on the topic
[7:13] and try to study and then he used a
[7:17] scripture that really strike me and and
[7:19] it's it's kind of the basis of our
[7:21] sermon this morning and it's in 1 John
[7:24] chapter 4 and I call it the New
[7:26] Testament test
[7:30] and the Bible says beloved believe not
[7:32] every
[7:34] Spirit but try the spirits whether they
[7:37] are of God because many false prophets
[7:42] are gone out into the world so this is
[7:44] the New Testament test
[7:47] prophet and it's not just prophets you
[7:50] want to test you want to test because
[7:52] there's a lot of spirits and they want
[7:53] to talk they want to say something
[7:56] there's so many influencers there's so
[7:58] many voices out there everybody has a
[8:00] channel everybody say subscribe
[8:02] everybody says follow me but we can
[8:04] remember who said follow me first Jesus
[8:07] said follow me amen so verse two it kind
[8:12] of tells you how to approach this hereby
[8:15] know ye the spirit of God every spirit
[8:18] that confessed that Jesus Christ is come
[8:21] in the flesh is of God and every spirit
[8:25] that confesses not that Jesus Christ has
[8:28] come in the flesh is not of God and that
[8:31] this is that Spirit of the Antichrist
[8:34] wherefore ye have heard that it should
[8:36] come and even now already is in the
[8:40] world I've I'll be honest with you I've
[8:43] overlooked that
[8:45] scripture for too
[8:46] long but lately I've died into that
[8:49] scripture and it it it came to life for
[8:52] me because I always wondered there's so
[8:55] many churches out there that will say
[8:57] that Jesus Christ came in flesh right I
[9:00] would say that most church I would say
[9:02] that even the the Catholic Church would
[9:04] recognize that Jesus Christ live on
[9:07] earth and he came in flesh and so if
[9:09] that's the
[9:10] sign that this that that that that that
[9:13] vindicate a voice or vindicates a
[9:16] minister there's a lot of people who
[9:18] will say Jesus Christ came in the flesh
[9:20] so what is it
[9:22] really many church can point to you a a
[9:26] story called Jesus Christ their sermon
[9:29] built will be built on History like what
[9:31] Paul did this and he went in that City
[9:33] and he traveled that long and he met
[9:35] that person and all the the the the the
[9:38] angle of the sermon is based on
[9:41] historical event and they will not deny
[9:44] that Jesus Christ came in flesh but they
[9:47] will put everything in the
[9:49] past and it suddenly it dawn on me that
[9:53] the spirit of Christ the spirit of God
[9:56] how do we know that it's the spirit of
[9:58] God that is talking is that it does not
[10:02] deny the manifestation of Jesus Christ
[10:06] in the flesh present
[10:10] tense because the Trap is always to
[10:13] point back to something God has done in
[10:16] the past but that's not the sign that
[10:18] the spirit of God is talking the sign
[10:21] that the spirit of God is talking who to
[10:23] recognize that he not I was or I will be
[10:27] but I am
[10:30] and the spirit that can recognize the
[10:32] manifestation of Jesus Christ this
[10:35] morning is the spirit of God yes amen
[10:39] that's good amen and so to prove that
[10:43] this scripture is talking about that the
[10:46] next verse says ye are of God little
[10:49] children and I've overcome them because
[10:52] greater is he that is that is in you
[10:56] than he that is in the world so John is
[10:59] recognizing not only God in Jesus Christ
[11:03] or God in Moses or God in Paul but God
[11:07] in you yes amen and it this is how we
[11:12] recognize that the spirit of God is
[11:15] present and this is how you test a
[11:18] Prophet this is how you test a minister
[11:21] this is how you test every voice are
[11:24] they pointing you as a past Revival who
[11:27] are they pointing you at the Manifest of
[11:29] Jesus Christ today January
[11:33] 2025 God is on the move this
[11:38] morning all right so this is our
[11:41] foundation introduction is done so we
[11:43] can start
[11:44] right prise the
[11:49] Lord so before we move on we want to
[11:52] maybe kind of put it into context in our
[11:55] age
[12:03] we understand that in this
[12:05] hour and I don't have time to dwell to
[12:08] explain it all if if whatever I say is
[12:12] brought bring some question you have a
[12:14] wonderful student Pastor well verse you
[12:18] can ask question is somebody rubs
[12:20] against or does not align with what this
[12:22] church believe it's okay as well don't
[12:24] throw me into garbage just get rid of
[12:27] the seed and keep eating
[12:31] amen it was said that Revelation
[12:35] 10:7 in the days of the voice of the
[12:38] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[12:40] sound the mystery of God should be
[12:43] finished or means accomplish
[12:46] reveal as he has declared to his servant
[12:49] servants the prophets and a lot of time
[12:52] we we see that word
[12:55] as
[12:57] Mysteries but it's not
[13:00] Mysteries
[13:01] like we got a lot of more knowledge
[13:04] about many things many Mysteries got
[13:06] open but it's the mystery of
[13:09] God
[13:12] and when we want to summarize everything
[13:15] we've received in our
[13:17] age when we want to summarize to to the
[13:20] most simple expression of what the
[13:22] message
[13:24] was is that the mystery of God is
[13:27] finished
[13:32] but what is the
[13:34] mystery Bible
[13:36] question Bible
[13:40] answer obviously we for that we got to
[13:42] turn into Colossians chapter
[13:46] one and before he have you I know you're
[13:50] well acquainted with that scripture but
[13:53] before even Paul
[13:55] reveals what the mystery is already
[13:59] verse 24 he's giving us some Clues right
[14:03] because what he's saying he says who now
[14:05] rejoice in my sufferings for you and
[14:07] fill up that which is behind of the
[14:10] afflictions of Christ in my flesh for
[14:14] his body sake which is the church so
[14:18] Paul is saying that the Affliction of
[14:20] Christ is now in his body that he's
[14:24] finishing the the Affliction that Christ
[14:27] suffered and it it looks like like how
[14:29] dare you Paul Christ suffer on the cross
[14:32] it was complete and I'm not talking
[14:34] about suffering for the atonement but
[14:36] the the there is suffering for the body
[14:39] but now the body is not the body of
[14:42] Jesus anymore it's not his flesh anymore
[14:44] now the church is his body and Christ is
[14:47] in her and he so how bold can Paul could
[14:51] would say the Affliction of Christ is
[14:53] now in my
[14:55] flesh yeah but he's he's telling us
[14:58] something something is going somewhere
[15:00] with that so it says whereof I have made
[15:03] a minister according to the dispens
[15:05] dispens dispensation of God which is
[15:08] given to me for you to fulfill the word
[15:10] of God even the mystery which had been
[15:12] hid from ages and from Generations but
[15:15] now it's made manifest to his Saints and
[15:19] so it it doesn't make it like a small
[15:22] thing but he makes it the mystery yes
[15:27] yes hid from age and from
[15:30] Generations how many Rabbi read the Old
[15:33] Testament and and and studied they spent
[15:35] their whole life and they miss what was
[15:38] hidden Christ was veil in the in the Old
[15:42] Testament but they missed it because
[15:45] he's hiding himself but reveals himself
[15:47] in
[15:49] Simplicity to whom God who made known
[15:51] that is the riches of the glory of this
[15:53] mystery among the Gentiles which is
[15:57] Christ in you
[15:59] the hope of glory
[16:05] amen so that mystery of Revelation 10:7
[16:10] is
[16:10] complete in that mystery Paul says was
[16:14] hid from generation from ages right and
[16:18] I believe we're all on the same page for
[16:20] that yes it's not I'm not trying to
[16:22] bring something new I'm trying to use
[16:24] this to go a little bit
[16:26] further sir this morning thank you Lord
[16:29] so the sign the the New
[16:33] Testament Prophet test is the spirit of
[16:37] God when that spirit of God speaks he
[16:40] will put the manifestation of Christ in
[16:44] the flesh of somebody amen amen and
[16:48] people always been good to recognize the
[16:50] manifestation of Christ in past tense
[16:54] right and it's always been the problem
[16:56] from from from ages from ages from
[16:59] prophets to Prophet from church age to
[17:01] church ages they were always miss they
[17:04] will always praise God for what he did
[17:06] but they would miss what God is doing
[17:08] and it's exactly the role of the
[17:10] Antichrist to Blind you to the present
[17:14] manifestation of Christ and make you
[17:16] appreciate a past manifestation of
[17:19] Christ right sometime we believe the
[17:21] spirit of antichrist is like something
[17:23] really satanic or witchcraft no is to
[17:26] put Christ in past tense that's all all
[17:29] you need to bring spiritual
[17:39] death so when you want to
[17:42] summarize the ministry of a man we
[17:45] receive a prophet in our
[17:48] age and people are trying to prove him
[17:50] right prove him wrong based on
[17:52] archaeologist and and and newspaper
[17:55] clipping and and and bridge bridge
[17:57] engineering and and they try to prove
[18:00] him and there missed the whole point
[18:02] right all we have to do is to try to
[18:06] figure out if I summarize that man's
[18:11] Ministry what was the climax of what he
[18:14] was trying to
[18:15] do when he said that this is the
[18:18] Pinnacle of my
[18:19] Ministry yeah that Christ coming
[18:24] down and that would reveal the mystery
[18:29] and that he the the the the first pull
[18:32] the second pull that coming into the
[18:34] third pull to bring you where to bring
[18:37] you to what
[18:38] manifestation I would say boldly that if
[18:41] we want to summarize this ministry this
[18:44] verse summarize the ministry of the
[18:47] Prophet is to point Christ now into
[18:50] bride and if if and when we realize and
[18:53] I will show
[18:55] you quickly um you Brothers can you
[18:59] make me a big jump to slide 22
[19:04] please I never know what order it's
[19:06] going to
[19:07] be uh slide 22 let me move one forward
[19:11] this one the pacle of his
[19:14] ministry when he preached Christ is the
[19:16] mystery of God
[19:18] revealed and now we're getting into our
[19:20] topic the
[19:22] greatest purpose
[19:25] yes and when he summarized the three
[19:28] great purposes of God hidden from ages
[19:31] and
[19:33] generations the first
[19:36] one he says the first thing was that God
[19:40] wanted to reveal himself to the
[19:45] people and we believe he did amen yes
[19:50] sir but now the second
[19:53] purpose is to have the Christ Christ
[19:57] wants to have the preeminence in his
[20:00] body of Believers that is bright that he
[20:03] might live in
[20:06] people so now you tie it back to first
[20:09] John 4 this is how we recognize a true
[20:12] Prophet this is how we recognize the
[20:15] true spirit of God is that it will
[20:18] introduce it will point to Jesus Christ
[20:22] in the flesh yes and a lot of people
[20:25] have seen Jesus Christ manifested
[20:27] manifested in in the prophet's Ministry
[20:30] and we all appreciate that but if it
[20:33] stopped there you've missed a whole
[20:34] point yes because it went through him
[20:37] but he wants to reach you in your
[20:41] life and so when it's time to summarize
[20:44] the greatest purpose so if if if the
[20:47] prophet reveals those three great
[20:49] purposes of God it means that that was
[20:52] his purpose
[20:53] too and if a man if a man who we call a
[20:58] prophet
[20:59] if we can't point to the Pinnacle if we
[21:02] summarize his old purpose of why he was
[21:05] sent on Earth and it was to point to
[21:08] Christ and the bride what are you afraid
[21:13] of we don't need to become an
[21:15] archaeologist we don't need to be an
[21:18] investigative journalist to be expert in
[21:21] what happened then and this and that
[21:23] because we can safely said that safely
[21:27] say that depend goal of his ministry was
[21:30] to point you to Christ for you to have a
[21:32] closer relationship with Christ so that
[21:35] Christ could be manifested in your life
[21:39] [Applause]
[21:40] today
[21:44] God the third is to restore the kingdom
[21:47] to its rightly position that fell by sin
[21:50] by the first adom back to where he
[21:52] walked into the cool of the evening with
[21:54] his people talk with them and fellowship
[21:57] with them so the her all purpose of God
[22:00] and the all purpose of the prophet's
[22:02] Ministry is to restore the
[22:04] connection between the people in Christ
[22:08] that he could be in
[22:10] you Jesus says those who believe in me
[22:13] they shall do the same works that I do
[22:16] it's now it's about you and Christ the
[22:19] prophet has fulfilled his ministry he
[22:21] has done his work God took him home and
[22:23] now Christ wants to say what about time
[22:26] to do something together yes right
[22:33] hallelujah thank you Lord even
[22:35] Revelation
[22:39] 1010 it says when he took the little
[22:41] book out of the Angel's hand and he ate
[22:43] it
[22:44] up and the prophet says that book is
[22:50] Christ but he had to eat it so it means
[22:53] Christ in us the bride us to eat the
[22:56] book amen and that book is The Book of
[22:59] Life it's the word it's Christ the
[23:01] prophet says he says Christ opened those
[23:04] seals he says Christ was those seal it's
[23:06] a person not
[23:09] information and when sometime people
[23:11] they want to understand the seals and
[23:13] they're trying to understand the
[23:14] information there's information links to
[23:17] the seal we know the horse rider this
[23:19] this and that but when you want to
[23:21] summarize the seal it's a person
[23:23] revealing itself and the bride has to
[23:26] take that person in and that is the
[23:29] purpose of that Ministry amen
[23:34] hallelujah
[23:36] amen so I took the little book and I ate
[23:39] it up and it was in my mouth sweet as
[23:42] honey and soon as I eaten up my belly
[23:44] was
[23:46] bitter so it's Christ in you the hope of
[23:52] glory even
[23:57] Paul even even Paul when he wanted to
[24:00] point at his
[24:02] message he didn't point to
[24:05] letters he didn't point to ink and paper
[24:08] right but when it was time to point to
[24:11] his message when it was time to point to
[24:13] his ministry we we noce scripture he
[24:16] says ye
[24:18] are persons ye are our epistle written
[24:24] Amen in our hearts known and and read of
[24:26] all men for so much such as ye are
[24:29] manifestly manifestly declared to be the
[24:32] Epistle of Christ ministered by US
[24:34] Written not with ink but with the spirit
[24:37] of the Living God not in tables of stone
[24:39] but in fleshly tables of the heart Yes
[24:44] again you have a prophet you have a man
[24:46] of God and where is he pointing Jesus
[24:49] Christ is he pointing him himself Paul
[24:51] says we're not preaching ourselves we
[24:54] are preaching Christ and our ministry
[24:57] Christ now is in my message is you yes
[25:07] amen we had new people coming this
[25:09] summer
[25:11] and they enjoyed the people they enjoyed
[25:14] the
[25:15] preaching they enjoy everything about
[25:18] the atmosphere they those new people
[25:20] they recognize Christ in our midst and
[25:23] they fell in love with us and suddenly
[25:26] they start to realize that we believe in
[25:28] a prophet and brother brandham and then
[25:30] they went on the web and then they they
[25:32] got scared yeah yeah it scary with
[25:35] they're saying these
[25:37] days and
[25:40] so they
[25:44] left and I told the church I said you
[25:47] know
[25:49] what when they fell in love with
[25:53] you for what you represent yeah the
[25:57] atmosphere in the church to preaching of
[25:58] the word they loved everything I says
[26:00] when they did that they they fell in
[26:03] love with the
[26:04] message right because we are the
[26:08] manifestation Christ in us now is the
[26:12] message because it's present tense yes
[26:16] sir and even one of them wrote to me she
[26:18] said you're such wonderful people your
[26:21] fruits are so good I'm like what are you
[26:23] afraid of the tree then if the fruits
[26:25] are
[26:26] good like hey am but they were not they
[26:29] were new people so they didn't
[26:31] understand but it's like I always almost
[26:34] replied with the scripture of Matthew
[26:35] like where are the
[26:37] branches he's the tree if the fruits are
[26:41] good du yeah I could be poisoned by that
[26:45] tree but I love the
[26:50] fruits but then they went on the web and
[26:52] who wants to be part of a cult if if
[26:54] that's what we say it's dangerous is
[26:56] this is this is that so out of it
[26:58] ignorance but some of them now are
[26:59] slowly coming back cuz they say you guys
[27:02] have something we don't find somewhere
[27:05] else and we're like oh thank
[27:10] you what they see we should know what
[27:12] they
[27:14] see where does Steve no one preach like
[27:16] you over there that's what they say it's
[27:18] like yeah if you knew where I take it
[27:21] it's Christ
[27:24] yeah so we we want to have that ability
[27:27] to to recognize
[27:35] Christ that's why Paul didn't focus on
[27:39] letter and ink right right because he
[27:42] recognized that words need not to be
[27:44] made paper that word not to be made
[27:48] tapes it it conveyed true letters it was
[27:51] conveyed through tapes but the end
[27:53] result if it stays on paper it's a
[27:57] failure if it stay on tape it's a
[27:59] failure it has to become
[28:03] flesh and that this is the sign that the
[28:07] movement is still alive and it's from
[28:10] God if when we can point at Christ in
[28:13] the flesh not just books right we enjoy
[28:16] the Bible it's great but if it's stay in
[28:18] paper form it's a
[28:20] failure because the greatest purpose of
[28:23] God is that he wants to live in his
[28:25] people that's what he wants to do that's
[28:27] his
[28:28] business and it should be the business
[28:31] of every man that says that are called
[28:33] from
[28:34] God is to point to
[28:37] Christ to bring people to Christ so
[28:39] Christ can come in them and to live in
[28:42] them and so this is how we judge a
[28:45] Ministry this is how we judge every
[28:47] Spirit what are you preaching what are
[28:50] you pointing
[28:52] at amen that's
[28:55] right if you leave the service this
[28:57] morning it's like yeah brother Steve is
[28:59] a good preacher but it was all about
[29:01] himself we kind of felt we needed to
[29:03] listen to him we kind of felt the
[29:06] attraction that he he's trying to bring
[29:08] us like we need to go through him to get
[29:11] closer to God and that's kind of the
[29:14] what we heard from him if if if that's
[29:16] the if if you leave church this morning
[29:18] and this is this is what you got then
[29:21] I'm a false prophet because I'm trying
[29:23] to bring you to
[29:25] me or I'm trying to bring you to my
[29:29] church I'm glad they put the website on
[29:31] so everybody can subscribe and you
[29:33] follow
[29:34] me right I'm sorry it's all in French
[29:40] anyway
[29:43] so that's what we want to
[29:46] hear you know some people blame the
[29:49] prophet they say you brag too much about
[29:52] Jesus
[29:54] yeah that's a compliment yes Lord thank
[29:57] you
[29:59] yes amen because that's what we the one
[30:01] we want to praise
[30:03] and all right but we're not out of the
[30:06] woods yet
[30:09] because the spirit of antichrist will
[30:11] fight that and the spirit of the
[30:14] Antichrist what it will do it will
[30:16] remove Christ in present tense yes and
[30:20] will put it on a holy men either present
[30:24] past or
[30:26] future but the the most important action
[30:30] of that nicolan spirit is to remove the
[30:33] movement of the holy spirit in your life
[30:38] and that the only way you can have
[30:41] access to Christ is
[30:43] through the church the pastor the
[30:45] Prophet this this or that and it's
[30:48] something that comes between you and
[30:50] Christ that becomes so important that
[30:53] you don't have a straight access anymore
[30:56] wow
[30:58] so right away even
[31:00] when Jesus died on the cross and Peter
[31:03] comes and opens you know even for the
[31:06] Gentiles and Paul comes start preaching
[31:08] already he says the mystery of the
[31:10] iniquity do already work right you say
[31:14] the church is great you got free free
[31:16] from the Pharisees free from the law
[31:19] you're moving into freedom but you think
[31:21] that spirit will
[31:24] stop it doesn't stop and it didn't stop
[31:27] in our our age and and I believe that's
[31:29] a misunderstanding that we have we think
[31:31] that Spirit worked for all the six age
[31:33] but since the seals are open he went on
[31:34] a
[31:35] vacation that mystery of iniquity that
[31:38] nian Spirit got got defeated through the
[31:40] ministry of the Prophet it got defeated
[31:43] it's over now he got a knockout punch we
[31:45] don't have to worry about him
[31:49] anymore or is he still at work
[31:53] yes so what was it got to go quickly to
[31:57] that
[31:59] we know that
[32:00] Spirit was a saying you know it's a
[32:03] thought then we say it then we do it
[32:04] then it becomes a Doctrine and after it
[32:06] becomes a
[32:07] persecution and we can see in our age
[32:09] some doctrin started as a saying it
[32:11] started as a a ritual it started as a
[32:13] tradition and now if you don't do it
[32:14] you're not in the message right on it
[32:17] became a persecution it became a subject
[32:20] of being excommunicated right because we
[32:23] created new tradition new things that
[32:25] that are more important in Christ in my
[32:27] life
[32:28] it's Christ in my life plus this plus
[32:31] that plus going this plus doing that
[32:33] whatever men is trying to do very good
[32:37] and so that Nicol spiritual tradition it
[32:39] was recognized as a a cult you know
[32:41] perverted cult through Nicolai Prophet
[32:43] is that's not
[32:44] so we know about that that you know the
[32:47] Greek
[32:48] word niol so to means to conquer the ly
[32:53] so that Spirit wants to conquer you but
[32:54] conquer
[32:56] what we have it here also it's the first
[32:58] horse
[33:00] rider the first horse rider went to
[33:06] conquer so the first horse rider went to
[33:10] niika right to niika
[33:14] who you yeah
[33:17] me the church who got
[33:20] freshly freed yes from that bondage you
[33:24] think he you think he received a
[33:26] knockout punch when he he was
[33:28] exposed in 63 and exposed through the
[33:31] church age book he got a knockout punch
[33:33] went on vacation I'm sorry I got
[33:35] defeated Prophet came expose me people
[33:38] will never fall in that
[33:40] trap
[33:42] no so that horse went to
[33:47] conquer and he received a
[33:50] crown who gave him a
[33:55] crown who gave him a crown who allowed
[33:58] that person and now we're going to
[34:01] walking slowly into idolatry we're going
[34:03] to see how idolatry Works we're going to
[34:06] see a pattern in scripture it's always
[34:08] the people who wants to Crown often time
[34:10] we think about nicolan Spirit as as as
[34:13] you know the the the clergy you know
[34:16] dominating clergy this Cardinal this
[34:18] bishop who wants to dominate people but
[34:20] you know what now we would not accept
[34:24] that but we are going to realize is that
[34:27] when somebody is not forcefully trying
[34:29] to dominate people people are asking for
[34:32] someone to dominate on them exactly
[34:35] right Pastor tell me how to think Pastor
[34:37] should I go get this job Pastor should I
[34:39] do this please dominate my life I need
[34:42] to find a quote where the Prophet says
[34:44] verbit in what I should do please
[34:46] William Bram dominate on my life tell me
[34:48] how to think tell me should I take this
[34:50] job or not come on I need to find a crow
[34:54] who going to tell me should I do this
[34:56] should I do not do it but where is
[34:58] Christ
[34:59] right because maybe you can find a quote
[35:02] that tells you that this you know if you
[35:04] do this this this but what about if God
[35:06] leads you says God would never lead me
[35:07] outside of what the prophet's say and
[35:09] I'm not talking about clear-cut
[35:11] situation I'm talking about situation
[35:13] people are trying sometime to apply
[35:15] quotes to their life that doesn't apply
[35:17] at all they stretch it so far right but
[35:20] and then they hide behind the quote and
[35:22] you read the quote he like brother I
[35:24] mean I get the quote but you're applying
[35:26] to this I mean has nothing to do no no
[35:28] brother no no no no no they stretch it
[35:31] because they want to hide behind a man
[35:33] who's going to tell them how to
[35:36] think but where is Christ it's like
[35:39] Christ's not able to talk to you
[35:45] anymore thank you Lord so we Crown
[35:49] men to dominate on us it can be you
[35:53] sitting in church and this elder brother
[35:55] he has so much wisdom and he he knows
[35:57] knows the Bible he knows the word and
[35:59] you trust him so well and every time you
[36:01] go through a situation you call that
[36:02] brother brother no you know I trust you
[36:04] and I'm going through this what do what
[36:06] would you do and we got to be careful
[36:07] even me as a pastor when people ask me
[36:10] questions I always answer with another
[36:13] question yep
[36:16] yep and you know why you know what it's
[36:20] amazing most of the time people already
[36:22] had the answer in their heart amen but
[36:24] they don't have confidence God already
[36:27] so I turned the question around it's
[36:28] like what how do you feel like well I
[36:30] feel like I should do this like why you
[36:32] asking me then well I don't know you
[36:35] know you're you're a man of God well I'm
[36:38] no more a man of God than you are a man
[36:40] of God it's like my Christ's not bigger
[36:42] for me than it is for you it's the same
[36:44] one the only different is a gift I got a
[36:47] gift to preach but when when that gift's
[36:49] gone I'm just that regular joob try to
[36:52] make a true life and try to raise
[36:53] children and you ask me yeah I'm asking
[36:57] you
[36:59] yep and I don't say that a pastor cannot
[37:02] give good advice but most of the time my
[37:04] advice is based on a
[37:06] vision most the time I reply okay you're
[37:09] wondering about that choice today where
[37:11] do you want to be in five years and is
[37:13] that choice today making you closer to
[37:15] this purpose that God gave you in your
[37:16] heart or further very
[37:20] good people want to be dominated by law
[37:23] but Christ wants to lead our life by a
[37:25] vision I want to get close close to
[37:27] Christ so is that decision making me
[37:29] close to him or further from
[37:33] him
[37:39] amen so Paul saw coming but he warned
[37:42] them about this subtle priesthood that
[37:43] would come and take over with this false
[37:45] Doctrine he knew they would Implement a
[37:47] way of worship that exclude the people
[37:49] from any part in the Holy Spirit
[37:51] Ministry only the pastor only the
[37:53] prophet only the Deacon only the elders
[37:55] no Christ in you is accessible from the
[37:58] first row to the last and those that's
[38:00] going to come and outside of this church
[38:03] and inside of this church
[38:06] right it's
[38:08] accessible and even and right today
[38:10] among those who claim to be free and
[38:12] full of the spirit there is not too much
[38:14] freedom in the lady and the best we can
[38:16] see is a few preachers with inspired
[38:19] preaching while the flock just sits
[38:21] there and try to absorb it this is a far
[38:24] cry from Paul who said that when all
[38:27] came together all had the leading of the
[38:29] spirit and all participated in a
[38:31] spiritual worship yes
[38:35] amen what is he saying people sitting
[38:39] and listening to a holy man is a far cry
[38:43] from what brother Paul was preaching is
[38:46] somebody
[38:48] listening
[38:50] amen well Christ wasn't a prophet amen
[38:54] well Christ is when I hear tapes it
[38:55] blesses me amen nothing against
[38:58] that we're going to see as we move in
[39:01] we're going to see what idolatry is
[39:03] idolatry is not when okay Sports well
[39:07] Sports you know I struggle with that it
[39:08] always gets between me and God the music
[39:10] you know bad music I struggle it becomes
[39:12] an idol in my life because it comes
[39:14] between me and God but what about
[39:16] idolatry when that thing that be between
[39:18] you and God is something that God sent
[39:21] is that
[39:22] possible well we're going to study that
[39:24] quickly got to move
[39:26] on thank you Lord
[39:29] wow we always see idolatry as Pagan
[39:32] worship worshiping stuff that are from
[39:35] the devil but that nicadan spirit that
[39:39] that Antichrist spirit will make the
[39:42] True Believer fall in idolatry with
[39:45] stuff that God has
[39:47] sent there's a pattern in scripture for
[39:50] that so let me move I got to skip some
[39:53] of my
[39:55] quotes Okay okay got to move on I don't
[39:57] want to keep you too
[40:00] long so I want to talk about innate
[40:04] idolatry one day I was talking to
[40:06] brother Eugene Bron who some of you know
[40:09] him he's a good friend of mine and he
[40:10] says brother Steve we're talking about
[40:12] you know why people would fall for this
[40:14] and why would people would fall for that
[40:15] I was like you know brother Eugene says
[40:18] man it's it's unfortunate says brother
[40:20] Steve he says those things are there to
[40:23] feed the idolatry and
[40:25] people because idolatry is not something
[40:29] that comes from outside idolatry is in
[40:31] every man yep right and idolatry is when
[40:35] you want to replace Christ when you want
[40:37] tol God by some accessories or some
[40:41] other thing than Christ
[40:46] himself you remember my opening
[40:48] scripture one of the opening scripture
[40:50] the true test as we test the spirit of
[40:53] God is the one the one that denies Jesus
[40:56] Christ in the flesh is the
[40:59] Antichrist but the one that recognized
[41:02] Jesus Christ in the flesh is of God
[41:06] that's the ultimate
[41:11] test so let's talk about idolatry for a
[41:15] minute of course when we talk about
[41:17] idolatry we're talking about Graven
[41:19] image lord said you know th shalt not
[41:22] have no other gods before me Thou shalt
[41:24] not make unto thee any Gren image or any
[41:27] likeness of anything that is in heaven
[41:29] above or that CU God knew that men by
[41:32] that that sinful nature they are
[41:35] idolators they would always come up with
[41:38] a fish a beast this the sun whatever God
[41:41] has created these all those Idols they
[41:44] the the sculpure they make yeah was
[41:47] things that God created sure but God
[41:49] knew that they would fall for them and
[41:52] so he says Thou shalt not bow down
[41:54] thyself to them nor serve them for I the
[41:56] Lord thy God I am a jealous God so he
[41:59] says don't do that even in the Book of
[42:02] Luke and it's still in
[42:05] French and Jesus answered unto him get
[42:08] the behind me Satan for it is written
[42:10] Thou shalt Worship the Lord thy God and
[42:13] him only shallal thou
[42:16] serve praise the Lord and one of the
[42:19] greatest asset we have is time and we
[42:21] serve things with our
[42:24] time so
[42:27] right away they come out of
[42:29] Egypt and the prophet disappeared oh
[42:34] does the people doesn't like when the
[42:36] prophet go away right oh they don't like
[42:38] it they feel so discomforted they feel
[42:41] so insecure it's like this emptiness I
[42:43] got to feel it the prophet's gone what
[42:46] will I do the prophet's gone exactly
[42:49] what happened to Israel in the desert
[42:52] Moses went up the mountain and heate to
[42:55] come down the mount so the people
[42:59] gathered themselves together around the
[43:00] ministry around Aaron and said unto him
[43:04] make us Gods which shall go before us
[43:07] for us for this Moses the men that
[43:10] brought us up out the land of Egypt we
[43:12] were not what is become of
[43:14] him so right away they followed a
[43:17] prophet of God out of Egypt through the
[43:19] desert and then that Prophet goes up the
[43:21] mountain and then he disappear and right
[43:24] away the people are asking cuz Aaron and
[43:27] the Levites are the type of the ministry
[43:30] they're asking the ministry build us an
[43:33] idol an idol we want to worship
[43:36] something put an image in front of us so
[43:39] we can follow
[43:41] something and Aaron's reply should have
[43:43] been why you guys asking that right God
[43:47] just God himself just took us out of
[43:49] Egypt it was not Moses it was God and
[43:53] even though Moses is gone we don't know
[43:55] if he's going to return God is still
[43:58] here the one who brought you but their
[44:00] eyes were not on God their eyes was on
[44:02] Moses so when Moses got away they needed
[44:06] an image right they need something
[44:09] tangible Pastor give me something to do
[44:12] tell me what to
[44:14] worship and they were missing God in the
[44:17] camp cuz the pillar fire was still in
[44:19] the camp God does not abandon his
[44:22] children glory to God thank you Lord but
[44:25] right away
[44:28] they wanted to be replaced and it's so
[44:30] funny when you you read Aaron because he
[44:33] said you know I brought those gold and
[44:35] melted and it came this uh C calf right
[44:39] yeah it came like yeah right yeah sounds
[44:44] like Evolution right yeah suddenly you
[44:47] know there's a monkey you
[44:53] know but he fell for that
[44:57] and the ministry was
[44:59] guilty to instead of replying to the
[45:03] people instead of telling the church we
[45:05] will not fall into
[45:07] idolatry the ministry went along and
[45:10] gave what the people
[45:12] wanted build us an image we can follow
[45:19] right even when it was time to go on the
[45:22] mountain God wanted to speak
[45:25] thally to Israel
[45:28] and God had made an appointment with the
[45:30] people God wanted to meet Israel face to
[45:33] face that's the ultimate
[45:36] purpose remember the greatest purpose of
[45:38] God he wants to be in you he wants to
[45:41] restore Fellowship as Adam had that's
[45:44] what he want and that is not like in the
[45:46] Millennium you can have a relationship
[45:48] with Christ now he's accessible there's
[45:51] no there's nobody in between it's you
[45:55] and Christ he wants to lead you he wants
[45:57] to channel himself through you thank you
[46:00] Lord
[46:01] Jesus praise the lord we had a youth
[46:04] meeting lately and I've asked them
[46:05] what's what's the message to you in a
[46:08] simple
[46:11] sentence and they were all
[46:13] nervous and I've asked the church the
[46:15] same thing in a sentence if you
[46:18] summarize what is the message to you
[46:20] write it down and I'll say I'll give you
[46:22] some
[46:24] cues I don't want to offend anybody
[46:28] but I said if your
[46:30] answer what is the
[46:33] message if your answer is the further in
[46:37] past tense it is the colder you
[46:41] are wow in time but also in distance
[46:46] yes if it's further in time and far away
[46:51] from
[46:51] your you as a human being right your
[46:54] answer as as far as time and distance
[46:57] your answer is wrong but the closer your
[47:00] answer is to you that's the
[47:04] answer because the answer is that's the
[47:06] message the ultimate is Christ in me the
[47:12] hope of glory but many people would say
[47:15] God sent a prophet so you look at the
[47:18] distance a prophet's gone and it's it's
[47:20] it's how many years ago it's past tense
[47:24] it's all great but that came for Christ
[47:27] to come in your
[47:29] life so the ultimate purpose so I said
[47:34] and I gave the
[47:35] example you meet somebody at work and
[47:38] he's
[47:39] sick and maybe some of you
[47:42] recognize you say oh you're sick
[47:47] Wednesday so future tense I will put put
[47:51] a prayer request at
[47:53] church and a holy man in my church will
[47:55] pray for you
[47:58] so you put it in distance in time and
[48:02] it's going to be another person who's
[48:04] going to do it for
[48:06] you and I said you you can still bring
[48:09] requests to church the point is not
[48:12] that's not
[48:13] wrong but I say what if you say to that
[48:16] person can I pray for you
[48:20] now then it's close to you the Manifest
[48:23] the action of God is close to you in
[48:27] time and in distance and that's the
[48:29] whole purpose of God he wants to use you
[48:33] now for that person yes this Helder or
[48:36] even the pastor who's going to sometime
[48:38] even people are like brother Steve you
[48:40] should meet my coworker you should talk
[48:41] to him and says I'm not doing that God
[48:44] plac you at that work trust that Christ
[48:47] will give you the words cuz he wants to
[48:49] use you he's using the pastor and
[48:52] sometime when we preach like that people
[48:54] are offended like he talked against the
[48:56] prophet all service that's not the point
[48:58] right well cuz I'm not I'm talking about
[49:01] myself I'm telling the people God I know
[49:04] where God wants to use me but he wants
[49:06] to use you why do you think you ended up
[49:08] at that
[49:09] school cuz he wants to use you but
[49:12] sometime we feel I wish my pastor was in
[49:14] school with me so he could talk to that
[49:17] person it's a lack of faith it's a lack
[49:19] of trust it's a lack of recognizing our
[49:23] position and when we feel this way we
[49:26] make our pastor and Idol right because
[49:29] he's going to replace the manifestation
[49:31] of God in your life through him where
[49:34] God called you to do it and not your
[49:37] pastor and that is
[49:39] idolatry that's the TR thank you
[49:42] Lord Brother the bride has to recognize
[49:45] our position she has to recognize that
[49:49] the all greatest purpose of God is he
[49:51] wants to be in you and for you to do the
[49:55] same Works he did amen well brother
[49:58] Steve I never prayed for
[50:01] anybody no problem but it's a good time
[50:04] to
[50:06] start I'll give you a testimony of my
[50:08] wife my wife goes to the grocery the
[50:10] other day and she leaves the grocery and
[50:13] I think it's in the parking lot or the
[50:14] entrance something there's a
[50:17] biker you know with the look you
[50:20] know my wife was intimidated cuz she
[50:22] says he's he was at Hell's Angels like
[50:24] I'm not sure he was Hell's Angel that
[50:26] group but that's how she felt yeah and
[50:29] my wife she's you know all little
[50:32] and so and he's like that and he's
[50:35] struggling with his breath he has
[50:36] something an issue his heart we don't
[50:38] know she doesn't know what it is then
[50:40] she stops she says are you okay sir said
[50:42] no I don't feel good my son went to get
[50:44] some help and she's Ling says okay
[50:46] you're going to be good and then she
[50:47] leaves and then when she leaves the Lord
[50:48] stops in her track is like go pray for
[50:53] him no that's a more probably a guy you
[50:57] know tattooed and Hell's Angels maybe a
[50:59] murderer and I'm just little you know
[51:02] little sister you know but she couldn't
[51:05] you know when the Holy Ghost gets a hold
[51:07] of you come on maybe she go maybe she
[51:10] couldn't call me Steve you have to come
[51:12] there's a man we need need prayer for
[51:13] her I like oh she didn't call me she
[51:17] turned back and she went to him she said
[51:20] can I pray for you amen he says yeah so
[51:24] my wife laid her hand on this motor guy
[51:27] motorbike and guy and then everybody
[51:30] like it was in the middle of the
[51:31] entrance so people stop and respectfully
[51:34] watch while my wife was praying for him
[51:37] this is just a little
[51:39] example but if you want to summarize the
[51:42] first pool second pool the third pool
[51:44] The Profit the seals the this the that
[51:46] people get lost you know I'm wondering
[51:48] what tape should I listen to do I listen
[51:50] enough i r do I go to the right Church
[51:53] like stop stop giving yourself a break
[51:56] yeah
[51:57] Christ is in you he wants to use
[52:01] you to God thank you Lord we get lost in
[52:04] religion right we're in danger of making
[52:07] another religion right come on now true
[52:11] we're in great
[52:13] danger
[52:15] Hallelujah so when God wanted to speak
[52:19] directly not true
[52:22] Moses you wanted to bypass the prophet
[52:28] you know what the people
[52:32] said they said unto Moses let not we
[52:35] don't want God to speak to
[52:36] us
[52:38] what oh I'm intimidated you know you
[52:42] might reject me I understand you know
[52:43] the mountain the the lightning the
[52:45] tunders it was pretty frightening quite
[52:47] intimidating but we don't need lightning
[52:50] Thunders and trumpet we are
[52:52] intimidating intimidated by that me
[52:55] praying for someone that's cool me
[52:57] praying for someone
[52:59] yeah God wants to use
[53:02] you and is that is it not the na human
[53:06] nature they said let not God speak not
[53:09] to us but let the prophet we just want
[53:12] to hear the prophet we don't want to
[53:13] hear God that's
[53:16] right and the Bible says the people
[53:18] stood
[53:19] afar they stood away from
[53:23] God to get close to the prophet because
[53:26] they felt
[53:28] secure I'm going to stick with the
[53:30] prophet man that's the safe way to
[53:33] go that's how they
[53:38] fell and then people get it reverse like
[53:40] brother St is saying we should stay away
[53:42] with the prophet that's not what I said
[53:44] I said don't stay away from God that's
[53:46] what I'm saying yes using a prophet to
[53:49] hide
[53:52] yourself all
[53:54] right let's take a few example of of
[53:56] idolatry they're pretty
[53:59] shocking the Brazen
[54:03] serpent you know one
[54:07] day in numbers 21 the Lord sent fiery
[54:10] serpent among the people and they bit
[54:11] the people and much people of Israel
[54:13] died and therefore people came to Moses
[54:15] and said we have sinned for we have
[54:16] spoken against the Lord and against thee
[54:19] pray unto the Lord that he take away the
[54:21] serpent from us Moses prayed for the
[54:22] people and the Lord said unto Moses make
[54:24] thee a fiery Serpent and set it upon a
[54:26] pole
[54:27] it shall come to pass that everyone that
[54:28] is bitten when he looked upon it shall
[54:30] live and Moses made a serpent of brass
[54:33] and put it on a pole so we read a
[54:36] scripture not long ago that God says
[54:38] don't do any Graven image yep and now
[54:41] he's making one exactly does God
[54:43] contradict himself no God told the
[54:46] people don't do one yep but now God
[54:49] asked for one right it's a different
[54:51] thing it didn't come from man it come
[54:53] from
[54:54] God and I so we understand it's the type
[54:57] of the Cross God is saying something
[54:59] here but people when they looked at it
[55:01] they lived and and and I believe had a
[55:04] great impact on Israel because you know
[55:06] what that serpent on a pole stayed for a
[55:09] long time in Israel and I can imag I can
[55:12] imagine that they would gather at
[55:13] evening you know around a bonfire you
[55:15] know at the tent and gather people and
[55:16] somebody would have a testimony you know
[55:18] a month ago when that serpent thing
[55:20] happened and I was almost dy I was
[55:22] sweating and had fever and and then I
[55:25] could barely look at the servant and I
[55:26] open my eyes and I look and I got to
[55:28] heal and then people are oh my goodness
[55:32] so good and then a year later we do also
[55:34] at Easter you know another big Gathering
[55:36] and we find another brother he got bit
[55:39] by a serpent that was that
[55:41] long and then he gets up and everybody
[55:43] gets quiet brother so and so is going to
[55:45] tell us his testimony how he got healed
[55:48] and and he gets up you know and know
[55:49] you're years later and he's old and he's
[55:52] the last survival who who saw that pole
[55:55] in action think about it and he comes
[55:58] yes
[55:59] people yeah and then as it goes you know
[56:02] the story gets bigger yeah oh yeah it
[56:04] gets bigger and then you get this and
[56:06] you get that and and and it becomes a
[56:08] tradition and everybody is amazed about
[56:11] that thing and and so they keep the
[56:13] serpent on the pole they would never get
[56:14] rid of that CU God used that serpent the
[56:17] pole such mightily it is amazing and
[56:20] suddenly we find another one another
[56:22] Survivor so we organize big meetings to
[56:25] hear this and tell us how he got healed
[56:27] with the serpent on the
[56:29] pole and
[56:32] suddenly the shift there's a
[56:34] shift in what we
[56:37] appreciate there's a shift on what we
[56:39] pay attention there's a shift about what
[56:42] gets us
[56:47] excited and you find yourself years
[56:50] later in second
[56:53] king and there's a king named ezekiah
[56:57] and had remove the high places and break
[56:59] the images and cut down the Groves and
[57:01] break in pieces the Brazen serpent that
[57:04] Moses had made for to those days the
[57:06] children of Israel did burn incense to
[57:09] it and he and he called it
[57:11] Newan so it ended up in
[57:15] idolatry that's probably around 500 and
[57:18] 700 something years later how many
[57:21] generations from generation when the
[57:24] last witness died we made a website we
[57:27] print it we wanted to keep this thing so
[57:30] alive but what my question
[57:33] is when was the
[57:37] day when is the Tipping Point where it
[57:39] became
[57:42] idolatry I'm wondering then even 500
[57:45] years ago ezekiah says okay enough is
[57:49] enough we've shifted our Focus we're
[57:52] missing the point we're taking something
[57:54] that God has used and now we're offering
[57:57] incense to
[57:59] it but I'm wondering it through before
[58:02] that through that 500 years how many men
[58:04] stood up and said we got it wrong this
[58:07] is a Graven image no brother it's not a
[58:09] Graven image this one was sent from
[58:11] God but they got trapped into
[58:15] idolatry they did the same thing with
[58:17] the Ark of the Covenant I'm trying to go
[58:18] quickly I'm almost done for those who
[58:20] are
[58:23] worried come on now same thing with the
[58:26] ark the Ark of the Covenant is a great
[58:28] thing
[58:30] yes it was the most sacred article they
[58:34] had accessories that item was allowed to
[58:37] go behind the veil better than the
[58:40] candle better than the table the Breads
[58:42] and all the accessories this one would
[58:45] see the face of God it was a sign of
[58:48] God's presence in the camp but one day
[58:51] Israel was in a defeat and they were
[58:53] losing against the philistine
[58:56] and they said you know they when the
[58:58] people were coming to the camp the
[58:59] Elders of Israel says where the Lord
[59:01] smitten us today before the Philistine
[59:04] let us fetch the Ark of the Covenant of
[59:05] the Lord out of Shiloh unto us that when
[59:07] it cometh Among Us it may save us right
[59:12] the ark it may save us of the ends of
[59:15] our enemies
[59:17] right that's idolatry exactly you think
[59:20] the ark could save you the ark could not
[59:23] save you God could right but put their
[59:26] faith in something else a god-given
[59:30] accessories but that's what I said
[59:32] before idolatry is not always sports or
[59:34] movie whatever you put between you and
[59:36] God it's whatever you put between you
[59:38] and God the most sacred and holy
[59:41] accessory can be between you and God and
[59:43] becomes idolatry because you put your
[59:46] trust in that instead of putting your
[59:48] trust in
[59:51] God and then we get some hint why it
[59:53] didn't work cuz ofne and Phoenix
[59:56] the Eli's Sons were there they br the
[59:58] ark it gives you an idea that it
[1:00:00] couldn't be blessed because the word had
[1:00:03] spoken y those men would
[1:00:05] fall but what's amazing is that when
[1:00:07] they brought it they had such a Revival
[1:00:11] they they scream and shouted it's is it
[1:00:14] possible to get so excited have so much
[1:00:16] noise around a fake Revival
[1:00:19] right get all the emotion he get all the
[1:00:22] noise so much that the Philistines
[1:00:24] they're like oh no
[1:00:27] they have the ark we're in trouble guys
[1:00:30] and this Philistines says we better be
[1:00:32] men of Courage because and the
[1:00:34] Philistine were afraid for they said cuz
[1:00:36] they were idolators
[1:00:38] too they knew the deal you know they had
[1:00:41] their own God they had their own
[1:00:42] accessories where they trusted and they
[1:00:44] thought Israel was like them and Israel
[1:00:45] has become like them y
[1:00:48] exactly the Philistine were afraid for
[1:00:50] to say God is come unto the camp and
[1:00:52] they said woe unto us for there had not
[1:00:55] been such a thing air for and the
[1:00:57] Philistine fought and Israel was smitten
[1:00:59] the ark didn't help at all but even the
[1:01:01] Philistine were afraid exactly because
[1:01:04] they were so noisy they got so excited
[1:01:06] excitement is great I'm all for that I'm
[1:01:08] excited right now yes right but it
[1:01:11] doesn't mean that it comes from God
[1:01:14] right here let's go back to first John 4
[1:01:17] what is the discernment right if it's
[1:01:20] the good spirit or not are you is it
[1:01:23] Christ in the flesh no they wanted to
[1:01:25] make Christ in an accessory
[1:01:28] right right which is idolatry exactly
[1:01:32] moving on
[1:01:34] quickly Gideon's how do you call that
[1:01:36] EOD
[1:01:38] EOD Gideon Bill and EOD but before that
[1:01:43] as gidon was getting old when I said
[1:01:46] that we Crown the dictator we Crown
[1:01:50] ourselves the niad in spirit Gideon God
[1:01:54] used them to set them free and as they
[1:01:56] are free they're asking Gideon now
[1:01:59] dominate on us rule thou over us both
[1:02:04] thou and thy son and thy son's son also
[1:02:09] it's not the first time that God use a
[1:02:12] great Revival true a man and people want
[1:02:14] to crown him and his sons and his sons
[1:02:17] of his sons to tell us what to do tell
[1:02:19] us how to worship tell us how to gather
[1:02:22] it's in the Bible y right it's idolatry
[1:02:27] and gidon was awake and he said unto
[1:02:29] them I will not rule over you neither
[1:02:32] shall my son rule over you the Lord
[1:02:34] shall rule over you Christ will do the
[1:02:39] ruling but then get in open a little
[1:02:42] thing here little gap which was enough
[1:02:45] to bring idolatry anyway gon said unto
[1:02:48] them I would desire request of you that
[1:02:50] he would give me every man the hearings
[1:02:51] of his prey for they had Golden Earrings
[1:02:53] because they were ishmaelite and their
[1:02:55] answerer we will willingly give them and
[1:02:57] then they got gave tons of gold and all
[1:03:00] kind of stuff and then you know what iil
[1:03:02] and which kind of a memorial let's
[1:03:05] celebrate what God did but the Bible
[1:03:08] says that he put it in the city even in
[1:03:10] ALA and all Israel went th and Waring
[1:03:13] after it which thing became a snare onto
[1:03:16] get into his house it became idolatry so
[1:03:19] even though when a man says I will not
[1:03:21] fall into
[1:03:22] idolatry you think that nicolan Spirit
[1:03:25] anti Christ is like oh I got defeated I
[1:03:28] got this knockout punch there's nothing
[1:03:29] I can do he keeps fighting right find
[1:03:33] other ways other angle trying to find a
[1:03:36] gap and something I feel we should be
[1:03:38] careful is because we believe we're the
[1:03:40] last
[1:03:41] age and God sent a prophet that we are
[1:03:44] spared from that that we don't have to
[1:03:45] fight that anymore we believe in the
[1:03:47] message we're all Antichrist Spirit
[1:03:49] cannot touch
[1:03:51] us we saw first John 4 the Antichrist
[1:03:54] Spirit wants to play the manifestation
[1:03:56] of Christ away from your flesh away from
[1:04:00] your
[1:04:02] body and put it on such one holy man can
[1:04:06] be whoever you want doesn't matter the
[1:04:08] temple boy did they appreciate the
[1:04:11] temple they love the temple to such a
[1:04:14] point that Jeremiah at one point he says
[1:04:16] thus said the Lord of hosts the god of
[1:04:18] Israel am men your ways and your doings
[1:04:20] and I will cause you to dwell in this
[1:04:23] place trust ye not in lying words saying
[1:04:26] the Temple of the Lord the Temple of the
[1:04:27] Lord the Temple of the Lord sometimes
[1:04:29] there's people like that they keep
[1:04:31] repeating it makes them feel better the
[1:04:33] message the message the
[1:04:35] message okay you know the Bible the
[1:04:39] Bible the Bible but he says these are
[1:04:43] lying words because you put your trust
[1:04:45] into that but your life right is all
[1:04:48] wrong and that's what he says here he
[1:04:51] says amend your ways and your
[1:04:54] doing for he trly amend your ways and
[1:04:57] your doings if he truly execute judgment
[1:05:00] between a man and his neighbor if he
[1:05:02] oppress not the stranger he's talking
[1:05:04] about the life they live instead of the
[1:05:07] temple they go but they made the temple
[1:05:10] they go or the message they believe in
[1:05:13] with their Pastor they have with their
[1:05:14] Church they attend to the
[1:05:17] Pinnacle and we said the Pinnacle is
[1:05:19] Christ in your life and if Christ is in
[1:05:21] your life it will make you live a holy
[1:05:23] life it will bring to manif estation of
[1:05:26] Christ in your life through you
[1:05:32] Hallelujah the same thing with the
[1:05:34] Sabbath oh my the Sabbath they they
[1:05:36] turned it around and they made man
[1:05:39] worship the Sabbath yes and even Jesus
[1:05:42] said you flipped it around
[1:05:45] right when the means become the
[1:05:49] goal when God's when God used something
[1:05:53] and for us instead of the mean it
[1:05:55] becomes the goal at one point it flipped
[1:05:57] and the Sabbath became the goal they had
[1:06:00] to worship the Sabbath and Jesus like
[1:06:02] come on time out you guys got it wrong
[1:06:04] the Sabbath was made for men not men for
[1:06:08] Sabbath but they reversed
[1:06:11] it God sent a prophet for us amen not us
[1:06:16] for him right he sent a prophit for us
[1:06:20] for us to get to
[1:06:22] Christ simple equation but Antichrist
[1:06:26] spirit will flip it and make the purpose
[1:06:29] make make the
[1:06:31] mean the
[1:06:36] goal and it becomes the only way of
[1:06:44] worship let's B our heads I got way more
[1:06:46] but we will leave it there I think the
[1:06:49] point God a across yes thank you
[1:06:52] Lord for while the musician comes play
[1:06:56] something slowly
[1:07:02] softly my prayer is that this morning
[1:07:04] the holy spirit is tearing down Idols
[1:07:09] amen when that Prophet was in that
[1:07:11] foreign country and when they accepted
[1:07:13] Christ Prophet says we could see dust
[1:07:15] everywhere of the breaking of the
[1:07:21] idols and as your Prophet said an idol
[1:07:23] is everything that we put between us
[1:07:27] and you
[1:07:30] Lord most of the time we thought about
[1:07:32] worldly
[1:07:34] things and we didn't realize
[1:07:38] that we can put all kinds of thing
[1:07:46] there is it good to have a pastor it's
[1:07:49] great I believe we should have one is it
[1:07:51] good to have a home Church absolutely we
[1:07:53] should have one is it good to believe a
[1:07:55] pro absolutely I I totally believe we we
[1:07:58] had to receive what he had to say
[1:08:01] yes but Lord we want to be able to
[1:08:04] discern have we let anything come
[1:08:06] between you and
[1:08:10] me and the only way when I I can see
[1:08:13] that is that when you want to move in my
[1:08:16] life I'm looking for something to hold
[1:08:21] on yes Lord I would obey your voice but
[1:08:24] I need a quote
[1:08:26] if only your Prophet has said it then
[1:08:27] Lord I would believe
[1:08:30] you Lord I I know you put that on my
[1:08:33] heart L I know but you know if only
[1:08:35] brother Aaron could give me the green
[1:08:36] light I would
[1:08:37] feel and those things are okay God can
[1:08:41] help us in our in our weak Faith he can
[1:08:43] help us doing that giving us a quote and
[1:08:45] giving us the green light from the
[1:08:47] pastor but he wants us to become more
[1:08:50] mature so that we can trust his voice
[1:08:54] and Trust his leadership sh if you
[1:08:56] believe on Me Greater Works shall you do
[1:09:02] not just a prophets not just a
[1:09:07] minister Lord we want we don't want to
[1:09:09] build nickan Spirit again where only the
[1:09:13] Ministries are inspired only them fills
[1:09:17] the burden of the hour
