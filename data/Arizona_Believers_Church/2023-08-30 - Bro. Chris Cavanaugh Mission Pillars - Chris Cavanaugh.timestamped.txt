[0:00] um Revelations 3 12 it says this him
[0:02] that overcometh will I make a pillar in
[0:04] the temple of my God and he shall go no
[0:06] more out and I will write upon him the
[0:08] name of my God and the name of the city
[0:10] of my God which is New Jerusalem which
[0:12] cometh down out of Heaven from my God
[0:14] and I will write upon him my new name
[0:17] so let's just bow our heads for prayer
[0:20] Heavenly Father we're a privileged
[0:22] people this evening
[0:23] Lord to realize what a great God that we
[0:25] serve
[0:27] Lord as we've read your word and we see
[0:29] it and we realize the promises that are
[0:31] entailed in it father were just
[0:33] encouraged all the time Lord God to
[0:35] realize how much you cared for us father
[0:38] and what price that you paid
[0:40] Lord that price of healing was already
[0:42] paid for sister Sandy and brother Levi
[0:45] and so we just hold them up in prayer
[0:47] Lord as as well as the other requests
[0:48] whether they were spoken or unspoken
[0:50] realizing that father we're coming to
[0:53] the right place we have the right person
[0:55] we have the right King the right Lord
[0:58] father we have the right Kingdom that
[1:01] we're a part of and so Lord we just
[1:03] commit them into your hands all these
[1:04] requests father and also the furtherance
[1:06] of this service we pray that you'd bless
[1:08] your hearers and the speaker also I mean
[1:10] all things that are done be done to your
[1:12] glory for asking in Jesus name God bless
[1:15] you can be seated
[1:19] so just as I start this evening I want
[1:22] to read a quote
[1:24] I'm going to the water already so you
[1:26] know it's bad
[1:27] because usually I can get through a few
[1:28] more minutes than this but
[1:32] no I'm hoping it wasn't something I said
[1:34] that everybody's you know a ways back
[1:37] but
[1:38] you haven't even given me a chance yet
[1:39] you gotta got to give me a chance to say
[1:42] something so um
[1:46] I guess we'll just get into this and
[1:48] Expeditions of the seven churches
[1:49] brother random had had this written it
[1:53] says now he is not only giving crowns
[1:56] but he says that these in the bride will
[1:57] be made pillars so we know we're in the
[1:59] age and brother Aaron's been speaking on
[2:01] it about we're in the head age right and
[2:03] things that happen in the head but
[2:04] there's you know a whole lot of other
[2:06] things that go into it so it's not just
[2:09] the head but there's support and
[2:10] different things there so it says and
[2:12] the bride will be made pillars in the
[2:13] temple of God but what is the temple of
[2:16] God Jesus spoke of his body as being the
[2:18] temple it was it was the temple of God
[2:21] but now that we are his body the true
[2:23] church is the temple of God by the Holy
[2:25] Ghost within us now he is going to make
[2:27] the Overcomer a pillar in that Temple so
[2:30] we're Overcomers
[2:31] pillars in the temple okay so we'll get
[2:34] that I think we got that right but what
[2:36] is a pillar a pillar is actually a part
[2:37] of a foundation for it holds up
[2:40] the superstructure praise God and just
[2:43] to stop here so the superstructure is
[2:45] like you've got a pillar going up and
[2:46] then the building that's above it that's
[2:48] what it's supporting so everything above
[2:50] that is what a pillar supports so it's
[2:53] down on the foundation it's a part of
[2:55] the foundation because it comes from the
[2:56] foundation and comes up and supports it
[2:58] we'll we'll cover that a little bit more
[3:00] here later
[3:02] um praise God that puts the Overcomer
[3:04] right in with the apostles and Prophets
[3:06] and I think this is real important that
[3:07] we understand this is that being a
[3:10] pillar you're actually placed back into
[3:12] that ax and I think sometimes we have as
[3:14] Believers a problem with realizing we
[3:17] look back and we think of Peter and Paul
[3:19] and you know different ones fill up in
[3:21] in different ones in the Bible and the
[3:23] things that they accomplished but the
[3:25] reality is today the Holy Ghost is the
[3:27] same as it was two thousand some years
[3:29] ago and what they were doing or what
[3:32] they were accomplishing all those things
[3:34] this church so the bride of Christ today
[3:36] is built upon the same exact thing that
[3:38] was present then so those things haven't
[3:41] gone away in fact they're magnified in
[3:43] this day because everything now has been
[3:46] opened up to the children of God Like
[3:47] Everything Has Changed right because the
[3:50] opening of the word came in this day you
[3:52] got into the the head era where we're in
[3:55] this day now and so Everything Has
[3:57] Changed For That
[4:02] um sorry right in with the apostles and
[4:03] Prophets for it says in Ephesians 2
[4:05] 19-22 now therefore ye are no more
[4:08] strangers and foreigners but fellow
[4:10] citizens with the Saints and the
[4:12] household of God and are built upon the
[4:13] foundation of the Apostles and Prophets
[4:15] I just want to stretch that again
[4:17] Apostles and Prophets Jesus Christ
[4:19] himself being the Chief Cornerstone in
[4:21] whom all the building fitly framed
[4:22] together growth unto an Holy Temple in
[4:24] the Lord in whom ye also are builded
[4:27] together for inhabitation of God through
[4:29] the spirit so we know that God is a
[4:32] habitation is somewhere you dwell right
[4:34] that's your house so if habitation
[4:37] doesn't make sense to you just think of
[4:38] your home
[4:39] whatever that home is that's a
[4:41] habitation for you that's where you
[4:42] dwell so Christ is going to dwell yes
[4:44] that verse 22 sorry yes the ver that
[4:47] verse 22 says that we are building
[4:48] together with them everything went
[4:51] through the door Jesus and as part of
[4:53] that body or Temple now when God puts a
[4:55] man in the temple as a pillar and makes
[4:57] him a part of that Foundation group what
[4:59] is he doing he is giving him the
[5:01] revelation of the word and of himself
[5:03] because that exact exactly what the
[5:06] apostles and Prophets had so we we don't
[5:09] want to be overwhelmed by thinking oh
[5:11] Peter and and Paul and Philip and you
[5:13] know different ones and Stephen and
[5:15] different ones we could mention all
[5:16] these ones and be like wow I can never
[5:18] achieve that because that's not what
[5:20] God's saying that that's totally
[5:22] something that is achievable in this day
[5:23] and it is a part of of the bride of
[5:27] Christ today is that particular thing so
[5:30] um what we want to focus on today uh and
[5:34] I'm going to try and tie two different
[5:36] things together uh Lord willing that's
[5:38] our goal anyways today uh so my the
[5:42] title of my sermon today is Mission
[5:43] pillars
[5:45] and we'll get to like there we go
[5:50] so we'll we'll come back to this so
[5:53] um an X Factor and we talked about this
[5:55] before and I know that some of you had
[5:56] asked me are we going back to space kind
[5:58] of we're kind of going back to space but
[6:02] not really but but we're going to talk
[6:04] about it and
[6:06] um two different kind of thoughts that I
[6:08] want to tie together and and one was
[6:11] um just the part of that the astronaut
[6:13] age and where we're at today and then
[6:15] going back to another thing where we
[6:17] talked on simple things and when we left
[6:18] off in that particular sermon we uh I
[6:21] had been sharing uh basically a
[6:23] testimony about my son and the the
[6:25] healing that happened and I'm sorry we
[6:26] can't go into that but I think most of
[6:28] you are here
[6:30] um maybe not all but most were here at
[6:32] that time and when we left them off that
[6:34] you know we've got the the Israelites
[6:37] circling Jericho and that's kind of
[6:39] where we left it at but it was the whole
[6:41] fact of they're just their walk right
[6:43] they're doing what the Lord said just
[6:44] walking day by day and then you know the
[6:47] next day comes by and the next day until
[6:48] the seventh day and then we know the
[6:49] walls come down so so we're going to try
[6:51] and tie those two things together so
[6:54] just before we try them together I just
[6:57] want to let you know that this evening
[6:58] if you go to the next one vintage youth
[7:02] will eat free again tonight because
[7:05] um I'm going to try and bring out some
[7:06] things that maybe won't be so much for
[7:08] the Vintage youth but uh we'll try and
[7:10] tie it all together so this evening
[7:12] vintage youth get to eat free that's uh
[7:15] part of what they get to do so
[7:18] um inspiration four which was the and
[7:21] I'll go back just a quick review if
[7:23] that's okay inspiration four was a group
[7:26] of civilians who were sent into space a
[7:29] billionaire paid for the tickets for
[7:30] three other people and those three other
[7:33] people end up going into uh actually
[7:36] orbit
[7:37] um three times around the earth and a
[7:40] part of what they did was they had said
[7:43] that they were going to have four
[7:45] different pillars that were a part of
[7:46] this particular thing so we know that
[7:49] what man is trying to do is they're
[7:50] trying to to find a way of Escape so
[7:52] just like in the tower in Genesis 11
[7:55] they're like hey we got to do something
[7:56] so this is an awesome escape plan let's
[7:58] go to Mars like it's freezing it's
[8:02] really a long way from the sun we don't
[8:03] know if there's water but Let's Escape
[8:05] there so that's their plan so here comes
[8:08] inspiration four and this group of of
[8:11] people
[8:12] that have been chosen to do this and
[8:16] again somebody
[8:18] a billionaire paid for the tickets and
[8:22] he was on the flight with the others
[8:23] that were there so and the four pillars
[8:26] that they represented were hope
[8:27] generosity prosperity and Leadership and
[8:30] I'm not going to go too much into those
[8:31] because I've got a lot to get through
[8:33] tonight and by the way I had to try and
[8:34] Willow this down like to under three
[8:36] hours so
[8:38] and and then I tried to you know get it
[8:40] under two so we're trying uh to to keep
[8:43] you know whittling it down if we can
[8:45] just to make it a little bit smaller but
[8:49] anyway this inspiration for us got there
[8:51] and what's remarkable about this
[8:52] particular thing in Time Magazine did
[8:55] several articles on it but um the
[8:57] article that I read on the particular
[8:58] article they said what's interesting
[9:00] about them is for six decades everything
[9:02] was controlled by pretty much nation
[9:03] states so if you were going to go you
[9:06] were in a specific class of people you
[9:08] had to have you know high education you
[9:10] had to be physically an amazing specimen
[9:13] that you you had to do all these
[9:16] different tests you had to have all
[9:17] these different abilities and you were
[9:19] the cream of the crop like they they
[9:21] weren't taking anybody but this like
[9:23] there was no way so that was that way
[9:25] for six decades but in the seventh
[9:28] decade guess what happens something
[9:30] changes so kind of like six Church ages
[9:33] right and in the seventh Church age all
[9:36] of a sudden all these things are
[9:37] changing and now you've got a group of
[9:39] people that have
[9:40] blasted off into space and gotten out
[9:42] there somewhere and because of that we
[9:46] realized that brother Branham had taught
[9:48] that in the um in the um in the sermon
[9:52] countdown that we had entered the
[9:53] astronaut age and he said the natural so
[9:56] things that science is doing God's doing
[9:59] other things as well so we see things in
[10:02] the natural taking place but in the
[10:04] spiritual God's not outdone
[10:07] so you see people going into space and
[10:09] you think wow that's awesome God's not
[10:11] outdone like he's going to make sure
[10:14] that what whatever man is doing he's
[10:16] doing something better right so there's
[10:19] always something better and if man's got
[10:21] some kind of plan we understand that all
[10:24] the the thinking and all the ability and
[10:25] all the creation all the things that man
[10:27] could do came from a particular Source
[10:30] right so he's still limited by that but
[10:33] God's unlimited so he's not bound by the
[10:36] laws of physics he's not bound by you
[10:38] know the the laws of nature he doesn't
[10:40] though although he works in nature he's
[10:42] not bound by those things so you can do
[10:44] whatever he Wills to do
[10:46] so we have these folks that have taken
[10:49] this trip and I'm not going to go
[10:51] through their history or anything like
[10:52] that again but I just wanted to talk
[10:54] about that and so
[10:56] um
[10:56] anyway what brother Branham typed it as
[10:59] is he said justification will be the
[11:01] next tile I think
[11:05] so he said justification was the horse
[11:07] and bugging this is just a quick review
[11:08] again so sanctification was the
[11:11] automobile uh the Holy Ghost gifts being
[11:13] restored was an airplane
[11:15] and then the Holy Ghost was the the
[11:18] spaceship which is the introduction of
[11:20] the astronaut age and so the thing about
[11:22] each of these things is you have power
[11:24] so it's horsepower with the horse and
[11:26] buggy it's more horsepower with
[11:28] automobile it's more horsepower with the
[11:31] airplane and then it's even more
[11:32] horsepower with the astronaut age still
[11:35] horsepower so the same things running
[11:37] through each age and each time and each
[11:39] step along the way it's all coming
[11:41] through that pathway but it's just
[11:44] getting more and more and more and God
[11:47] does the same thing he doesn't like give
[11:50] you something and then say oh we'll take
[11:51] that away here's the next thing he just
[11:53] keeps adding on to the very next thing
[11:55] and the very next thing and in fact
[11:57] we're living in an age where Satan has
[12:00] had four different Messengers if you
[12:02] will so he's had four horse riders right
[12:05] and with each passing of time those
[12:07] horse riders come out well there has to
[12:09] be something that raises up against it
[12:12] in each of those ages and so if Satan
[12:15] gets to get everything together into a
[12:17] Pale Horse and so everything that he's
[12:19] done through history is all mixed up in
[12:21] a Pale Horse
[12:23] would God take something away when he
[12:25] gets to the eagle age no because he's
[12:27] going to combat everything that Satan
[12:29] has all the way through so all those
[12:31] promises and this will come up just as
[12:33] we move along but all those promises and
[12:35] all those things come together there so
[12:38] uh
[12:41] so for
[12:42] um the first thing that we'll have is
[12:44] what is a mission so that we understand
[12:46] kind of what as a mission now one of the
[12:48] terms that's overused a lot is I'm on a
[12:50] mission from God
[12:51] because people love to say I'm on a
[12:53] mission from God I don't know what God
[12:55] they're on a mission for but it's not
[12:57] the God that I know but it's it's really
[12:59] a term that's overused but the reality
[13:01] is saying it's you're on a mission from
[13:02] God
[13:03] right
[13:04] because we're here to complete a mission
[13:06] there's something that we have to do so
[13:08] let's just say so this is what a mission
[13:10] is just so everybody understands it's a
[13:12] special assignment
[13:14] given to a person or a group
[13:16] or there's a pre-established objective
[13:19] or there's an ambition or a purpose that
[13:21] is assumed by someone
[13:23] right so Ephesians 5 25 to 27 and if
[13:28] it's okay you don't have to turn I'll
[13:29] just read it off
[13:30] says this husbands love your wives even
[13:32] as Christ also loved the church and gave
[13:34] himself for it then he might sanctify
[13:36] and cleanse it with the washing of Water
[13:38] by the word that he might present it to
[13:40] himself a glorious church not having
[13:42] spot or wrinkle or any such thing but
[13:45] that it should be holy and without
[13:47] blemish so we're reading Christ's
[13:49] mission
[13:50] he's got a mission here he's got an
[13:52] objective he's got something that he
[13:53] wants to do he's self-assigned this
[13:56] Mission you know it wasn't like he
[13:57] called brother Kristoff and said hey
[13:59] what do you think I should do about this
[14:00] you know should I did he call any of you
[14:02] no he self-assigned the mission right it
[14:05] was something that he he had a goal he
[14:07] had something in mind he had something
[14:09] that he wanted to achieve and he's going
[14:11] to achieve it and so that's his mission
[14:13] and his mission is going to be something
[14:15] that has absolutely accomplished now I
[14:18] can say I've had goals uh
[14:20] well I won't say weight loss goals
[14:22] because that that didn't work out so
[14:24] well but I mean sometimes you have goals
[14:26] right and you set goals for yourself you
[14:28] have ideas I tend to be a fairly
[14:30] optimistic person
[14:33] which actually isn't so great
[14:35] because it seems like my optimism is
[14:37] always ahead of what I can actually
[14:39] accomplish so uh and and then you get
[14:43] disappointed right because you're like I
[14:44] can accomplish this I I think I can get
[14:46] there I can do this thing and then you
[14:48] can't
[14:49] um but again I think optimism is a good
[14:52] thing in that you're always thinking
[14:53] that this is going to work out
[14:55] everything will be okay right you've got
[14:57] the mindset and I think a mindset is
[14:59] real important in accomplishing a
[15:01] mission so again Christ's Mission here
[15:03] and he's not going to mess it up he's
[15:06] going to present to himself a glorious
[15:08] Church
[15:09] can't miss it it's his mission
[15:12] right and he uses pillars to accomplish
[15:17] this Mission so he is the pillar and
[15:19] ground of the truth right we understand
[15:21] that the whole church was based on that
[15:23] pillar and ground of the truth but that
[15:24] is Christ he's that one
[15:29] so for for the the young people
[15:33] especially one of the the most famous
[15:34] pillars that that we can see is uh or
[15:38] the story of pillars is with Samson
[15:40] and Samson was between the pillars and
[15:44] it says and Samson took hold of the two
[15:46] middle pillars upon which the house
[15:47] stood and on which it was uh born up of
[15:50] the one with his right hand and of the
[15:52] other with his left hand and so we
[15:54] understand that this is a uh what the
[15:56] scripture was referring to there is that
[15:58] there's this place that has a a God that
[16:02] they're worshiping and Samson has been
[16:05] uh unfortunately not not living great
[16:08] but at the end of his life he comes to a
[16:11] place where they don't realize that that
[16:12] God has restored his power back again
[16:15] so that's come back to him now and so
[16:18] they Place him between two pillars and
[16:20] and according to the scripture there's
[16:21] some 3 000 up on this thing that that
[16:25] when he takes these pillars out it
[16:27] brings the whole building down so if you
[16:30] can understand pillars that's the part
[16:32] that I'm wanting to get to is that when
[16:34] you have a pillar it's real important
[16:36] that that pillar has strength that it
[16:39] has the ability to stand that it has
[16:41] something in there so a couple things
[16:43] about modern day pillars uh and I
[16:46] learned this actually the hard way when
[16:48] I used to do construction is that
[16:50] there's two things in modern pillars
[16:52] that you really have to have and one of
[16:54] them is compression strength and one of
[16:55] them is shear strength so compression
[16:57] strength is just that pressure squeezing
[16:59] down and Shear strength is the sideways
[17:02] forces so tonight we don't have time to
[17:05] do both so we're just going to focus on
[17:07] one so we're going to focus on that that
[17:09] pressure that that comes that crushing
[17:12] pressure and most of us know concrete
[17:14] right we're familiar with it but if you
[17:16] see the pillars on the highway outside
[17:18] you see the concrete right that's what
[17:20] everybody sees but inside there's other
[17:22] stuff that makes that whole thing work
[17:24] so both of those give it extra strength
[17:27] but tonight I just want to for sake of
[17:30] time we're going to try and just focus
[17:31] on one particular thing
[17:33] so
[17:34] I brought a special box
[17:39] and by the way I
[17:40] uh I I try and preach like
[17:44] I know there's a camera there but I
[17:45] really don't like them so
[17:54] and I have some things in here that
[17:56] we're going to use
[17:58] sorry that I'm off camera but I have to
[18:01] unload everything quick
[18:04] I guess I've had I could have had
[18:05] brother Phillip do it but I don't think
[18:07] he'd want it to be off camera either so
[18:10] um
[18:11] so I was just thinking about this and
[18:13] and you know in thinking of what it is
[18:16] how do we how do we convey to people
[18:19] like how important it is to to be filled
[18:21] so brother Castillo is preaching and
[18:23] he's talking about you know this pulpit
[18:25] and how the atoms and how they're
[18:27] separated and right and there's that
[18:28] space in there
[18:30] excuse me and there's you know that
[18:33] space needs to be filled and I think he
[18:36] did a really wonderful job of bringing
[18:38] that out
[18:41] but
[18:42] I had been thinking about this for a
[18:44] while
[18:45] um and and just that you know how do you
[18:48] because we say it all the time like you
[18:50] need the Holy Ghost you you know you
[18:51] need to be full of the word you need to
[18:53] you need to have these different things
[18:55] that are
[18:56] uh part of your makeup or part of your
[18:58] life and and how important that
[18:59] particularly is
[19:01] and so I thought well
[19:03] we'll just do something with some cans
[19:07] so
[19:09] I've got ordinary cans they're these are
[19:12] empty the others maybe not so
[19:15] um
[19:18] so you know things that are familiar to
[19:21] us that we've probably seen before
[19:23] and
[19:24] I'll need some Volunteers in a few
[19:26] minutes so some of you that are brave
[19:28] that that don't mind maybe just one or
[19:31] two
[19:31] uh but I was just thinking that you know
[19:34] uh we we have pop or okay maybe we
[19:39] should do this first is it pop or is it
[19:41] soda
[19:42] wait okay pops how many pops
[19:46] how many soda
[19:48] okay so we're gonna call it soda pop
[19:50] because that way
[19:51] all right
[19:52] because I'm not sure how else we can do
[19:54] it but to do that
[19:57] so for tonight we're talking about soda
[19:59] pop
[20:00] now one of the things about the cans is
[20:02] that the can doesn't really have much
[20:05] input on how it's made
[20:07] right
[20:09] it doesn't have a whole lot of input on
[20:11] what goes into it
[20:12] it's the camp
[20:13] right so this can is labeled Cactus
[20:16] Cooler because Cactus like ABC
[20:21] grape Crush
[20:22] Canada Dry
[20:25] Dr Pepper
[20:26] Sprite and this one is not a pop can but
[20:30] I brought it for a particular reason
[20:32] but our soda pop can better stick with
[20:36] the soda pop
[20:37] soda just doesn't sound right right if
[20:39] you go backwards of distant soda pop
[20:41] sounds sounds about right
[20:43] but anyway what I was thinking about on
[20:46] this particular thing is when when cans
[20:49] are filled they have a strength that
[20:51] they don't have once they're empty
[20:54] so when when the can is empty and how
[20:57] many of you crushed cans like
[21:00] okay most of us have it's kind of fun
[21:02] sometimes can get a little tedious if
[21:05] you have a lot to crush but every now
[21:07] and then just you know Crush in one can
[21:09] or whatever's kind of a fun thing to do
[21:11] so but one of the things that you'll
[21:13] you'll see about cans is like I have
[21:15] different sized cans different things
[21:17] that are there right and I'm not sure if
[21:20] everybody would be able to see so we'll
[21:21] have to figure this out in the long run
[21:23] and now Lord willing because you know
[21:25] this when you do things live things can
[21:28] go wrong
[21:29] so I'm just telling you if something
[21:30] goes wrong just know that I actually did
[21:32] this at home and it worked just fine so
[21:35] but just by virtue sometimes of the can
[21:39] itself so in other words just by virtue
[21:42] of how it was made initially
[21:44] it doesn't have to have anything in it
[21:46] but you can you can can everybody see
[21:49] can everybody see there
[21:51] so if if it can have I can stand this
[21:55] can is completely empty there's nothing
[21:57] in it absolutely nothing
[21:59] nothing in it right
[22:01] yeah it's empty
[22:02] but by virtue of what it was made in the
[22:05] materials that went into it
[22:06] it can withstand a lot of pressure
[22:09] it can handle a lot of things it's
[22:12] certainly able to do that so
[22:15] um
[22:17] Us in in our own natural abilities some
[22:21] of us can handle certain things really
[22:24] well
[22:24] like it'll it'll seem like actually
[22:27] you're handling it so well that God must
[22:28] be involved in that thing and what it
[22:31] actually is is it's just your natural
[22:32] ability
[22:34] I know some people that are naturally
[22:35] bold
[22:36] like
[22:37] you don't have to like ask for boldness
[22:40] because they're just naturally bold
[22:43] like they can preach like they're
[22:45] natural like they got boldness from the
[22:47] Lord but when they were five years old
[22:48] they were bold and when they're 50
[22:51] they're still bold I mean so it wasn't
[22:53] like they said God give me boldness uh I
[22:56] need this it just was there it was
[22:58] something inherent in them
[23:00] so uh first volunteer
[23:04] you want to try okay
[23:09] okay
[23:14] uh where should we have them stand you
[23:16] tell me
[23:18] right here right next to me okay so do
[23:20] me a favor and hang on to this because I
[23:22] don't want you to to slip off
[23:24] okay step on it and see what you can do
[23:28] okay so that's good it's okay go ahead
[23:30] and stay there for a second I'm going to
[23:32] step around you for just a second so
[23:34] he's able to withstand but if one little
[23:36] hurt comes
[23:39] if if something comes then
[23:41] you can't you can't withstand it it
[23:44] doesn't take much
[23:45] that was just a little tap on the metal
[23:47] thank you I appreciate your
[23:48] participation
[23:53] it can't withstand much it can't do much
[23:56] with those things so I need a another
[24:00] volunteer but I want somebody bigger I
[24:01] need somebody kind of
[24:03] okay
[24:06] do the same thing if you would if you'd
[24:08] just hold on to there
[24:12] you can bounce it's okay
[24:16] let me try and hit it
[24:19] I can try and hit it
[24:21] ready
[24:24] so do you know why it's not doing
[24:25] anything
[24:27] because this can is filled
[24:30] it's full of something
[24:32] you can go ahead thank you
[24:35] now I should say thank you I should say
[24:38] that for
[24:40] for brother Aaron and sister Elizabeth
[24:42] if they're watching I will not get any
[24:44] pop soda pop on the carpet that's why
[24:48] I'm having volunteers come out so
[24:52] teasing and teasing you're everything's
[24:54] safe trust me
[24:55] we're all good everything is safe
[24:59] so one of the things that you find out
[25:01] is that if if a can you know starts out
[25:04] fine and everything is good but through
[25:07] life's Journeys and life's uh you know
[25:10] troubles and trials and and again we're
[25:13] I hope you can kind of understand where
[25:15] I'm going with this
[25:16] you can have scars you can have things
[25:18] that happen and the cans can get damaged
[25:23] and that damage makes them more
[25:25] susceptible to failure right so and
[25:29] that's what's there so you have
[25:31] something that's damaged that's more
[25:32] susceptible to failure and it can be
[25:34] that way so if I take one of the cans
[25:37] and it doesn't matter so let's take a Dr
[25:38] Pepper because it has 23 flavors it's
[25:41] just what the doctor ordered right
[25:43] so
[25:45] one of the things about this particular
[25:46] can of Dr Pepper
[25:49] is that with its 23 flavors there's
[25:51] something else that's in there that's in
[25:53] every can of soda if you read the
[25:55] ingredients on all the cans of soda pop
[25:59] um one of the things that you're going
[26:00] to see is carbonated water
[26:02] now I could take those 23 flavors and
[26:04] pack them into a Dr Pepper
[26:07] and that's lovely right it's great that
[26:10] we have them in there but if I don't add
[26:12] the carbonated water to it
[26:15] it's a little bit much like it it
[26:17] doesn't it's never going to be truly the
[26:20] Dr Pepper that we know and love maybe
[26:22] some of you don't know or love Dr Pepper
[26:24] I don't know but it's not going to be
[26:26] that because it's missing the main
[26:27] ingredient because it's always the meaty
[26:30] ingredient is the carbonated water so I
[26:32] I know this is going to be
[26:34] I don't want to say Elementary or you
[26:36] know too
[26:37] too simple but I'm trying to use a
[26:40] simple thing to explain a complex thing
[26:42] because let's face it god's complex and
[26:45] you can't explain God but we can use
[26:47] simple things and I think brother
[26:48] Branham did it all the way through just
[26:50] like the horse and buggy and on you know
[26:52] in airplanes it's like wow that's really
[26:54] a simple thing but then he's talking
[26:56] about look at this is how I'm I'm
[26:58] working in you I'm going to come and
[27:00] justify you I'm going to come and
[27:02] sanctify you I'm going to give you gifts
[27:03] I'm going to put things into you there's
[27:05] going to be things that you receive and
[27:07] not only that my person the person of
[27:09] Jesus Christ is going to come and
[27:11] indwell you and it's going to fill you
[27:13] and that's something that you're going
[27:15] to get so here we have carbonated water
[27:17] so it's got water and then it's got
[27:18] carbonation so you know what brother
[27:20] Reggie was talking about with Dynamics
[27:22] and mechanics so you can kind of think
[27:24] of the water as that mechanics part of
[27:27] it and the carbonation
[27:29] is that life part of it right because
[27:32] that carbonation it's got that fizz it's
[27:34] got that life it's got that bubble it's
[27:35] kind of like if she took Pop Rocks has
[27:37] anybody had those before
[27:38] okay you know what it's like when you
[27:40] put a pop rock in your mouth right
[27:42] that's the life of it so that's in there
[27:45] and it's something that's giving it to
[27:46] it now I don't know about you but if I
[27:50] get something like a soda pop even if
[27:53] it's a Dr Pepper and that particular Dr
[27:55] Pepper has lost its Fizz
[27:58] I'm like
[28:00] this is tough
[28:01] right it's a little tough to drink it
[28:04] right now if I love it I might you know
[28:07] I might be able to drink it and I love
[28:08] it so I'll drink it but at the same time
[28:11] if it just had fizz
[28:13] right if it just had that carbonation
[28:15] added to it it needs that life to it and
[28:18] once you add that and it gets that thing
[28:22] going and it makes it different it makes
[28:24] it totally something uh special that it
[28:28] wasn't before
[28:30] not that it wasn't good
[28:31] but it wasn't as good as it could
[28:33] possibly be
[28:34] and that's kind of how it is so we've
[28:36] got this main ingredient and we need it
[28:38] we need the carbonation and the water
[28:40] just like mechanics and Dynamics okay so
[28:42] in Sodapop that's an important part of
[28:44] it it's something that you you have to
[28:46] take in it's something that you have to
[28:48] do and that's kind of how it is with the
[28:51] Lord so when brother Reggie was
[28:53] preaching about that and it's like yeah
[28:54] it's mechanics and Dynamics it's
[28:56] something special that has to be done
[28:57] and and that's a real important place
[29:00] for us to be is that we understand that
[29:03] you can have all kinds of gifts
[29:06] right
[29:08] a lot of us you know some people are
[29:10] really amazingly gifted
[29:12] um some people maybe feel like they
[29:14] don't have as many gifts but there are
[29:15] always things that the Lord gives you
[29:17] there are helps there are governments
[29:18] there's wisdom that's given there's you
[29:20] know people that can handle different
[29:22] situations there's ones that you can
[29:24] call on that you know that they're
[29:25] prayer warriors you know there's ones
[29:28] that stay home and take care of the
[29:29] family and that's a special gift
[29:31] uh if if you had me trying to deal with
[29:34] a bunch of screaming kids I you know
[29:36] what I well I did I pulled out my hair I
[29:39] it just it happened but you know it it
[29:42] changes things are are different those
[29:44] things kind of things happen uh but
[29:47] here's the Lord putting all these
[29:48] different things we've got helps and
[29:50] governments and Gifts like Apostles and
[29:52] Prophets and we've got different things
[29:54] that are put in we've got the joy of the
[29:56] Lord and we've got peace that passes
[29:58] understanding we have all these things
[29:59] that he's adding into there right and
[30:01] you can have those things naturally
[30:03] people can be gifted naturally in fact
[30:05] you don't even have to have God and
[30:06] preach
[30:07] right you can get up here preach you
[30:09] don't have to have God and sing like an
[30:11] angel
[30:12] there are people that do many people
[30:14] Elvis Presley who brother Branham talked
[30:17] about quite a bit was somebody that was
[30:19] raised in church grew up in a
[30:21] Pentecostal Church Assemblies of God I
[30:23] believe but you know could sing A Hymn
[30:26] and it was he could be anointed
[30:28] I mean you could tell it was anointed
[30:30] but at the same time he'd never came
[30:33] under subjection to the Lord
[30:35] he always he'd already sold his gift out
[30:37] to something else and that's where he
[30:39] was at that's where he found himself oh
[30:40] I should give a disclaimer uh I'm not
[30:43] actually marketing any pop soda at all
[30:46] so Sprite Canada Dry that's not the
[30:48] purpose so I apologize to the internet
[30:50] if somebody thinks that uh not trying to
[30:54] do that at all
[30:55] so we find out that with this particular
[30:59] example what I want to get to is that
[31:02] we need to be filled
[31:04] right and we need to be filled with both
[31:07] word and spirit it's not just a feeling
[31:10] of one or the other and a lot of times
[31:13] you have uh you know different factions
[31:16] that battle over that kind of stuff or
[31:18] those kind of things and
[31:20] um but I do know this that you know
[31:23] brother Brandon had talked about when
[31:24] when folks got the baptism as a holy
[31:27] ghost he said it would make a pair of
[31:28] overalls you know put their arm around a
[31:30] a
[31:32] was it a suit right a tuxedo sorry I put
[31:35] their arms around a tuxedo and call them
[31:37] brother and the saying it was a Calico
[31:39] print dress I believe in a silk you know
[31:41] a silk one and call him sister
[31:44] and with this particular thing and kind
[31:48] of keeping the same analogy we can think
[31:51] of it as this way and again brother
[31:52] Reggie was the one that brought this up
[31:53] so I'm not saying that Canadians are dry
[31:56] but brother Branham did generalize and
[31:59] he said you know you know that sometimes
[32:00] the Canadians they can be scholarly he
[32:02] called them conservative he called him a
[32:04] little bit starchy
[32:06] um things like that so that's it's
[32:08] amazing that they named a pop that way I
[32:10] I think it's just amazing
[32:12] but one of the things that that you'll
[32:14] notice is that with that Canada Dry
[32:18] when you get the Holy Ghost and have the
[32:21] word together
[32:22] that'll make a Canada Dry put their arms
[32:25] around a Cactus Cooler
[32:27] and call themselves brother or sister
[32:30] right
[32:34] it it'll happen
[32:36] it'll it'll make a a Dr Pepper put his
[32:39] arms around a Canada Dry and call
[32:40] themselves brother or sister
[32:43] but let's look at it so here's the
[32:45] Vintage youth Eat Free Part okay
[32:48] so
[32:50] I'm glad you're sitting down for this
[32:52] because not only that but it'll make an
[32:54] intellectual
[32:56] scholarly
[32:58] dry person
[33:00] put their arms around a Fantastical I
[33:03] think was what brother Reggie called it
[33:05] Pentecostal
[33:06] whatever you know Holy Ghost baby I'm
[33:09] not sure what all the names that they
[33:11] used today
[33:12] but you know that we've got the
[33:14] psychology side of things they say and
[33:16] again
[33:17] I I'm not labeling them somebody else is
[33:19] labeled them just like these cans were
[33:21] labeled by somebody else I'm just using
[33:22] the labels that somebody else put on
[33:24] right those labels are there
[33:26] but the the spirit of God and the word
[33:29] applied properly is going to make you
[33:31] put your arm around somebody that maybe
[33:33] you don't agree with and one of the
[33:35] things that you can think of it this way
[33:37] is you could actually put your arm
[33:39] around them and say you know what
[33:40] brother here's what I believe and I'll
[33:43] believe anything else that the Lord
[33:44] reveals to me instead of brother here's
[33:47] what I believe and that's it
[33:49] not listening to you I'm not talking to
[33:51] you I'm going to tell you exactly what I
[33:53] think and that's as far as I go
[33:56] right but instead of that we can put our
[33:58] arm around you know we can hug the
[34:01] Canada Dry in the Cactus Cooler and the
[34:03] grape crush and and whatever it is
[34:07] we can realize that that uh that is
[34:11] something that God wants us to do
[34:13] is to take our own thoughts and and in
[34:17] our own pride and our own ability and
[34:19] maybe lay it aside and try and see where
[34:22] this other person is at and see if they
[34:25] have something that you need because
[34:27] just like brother Reggie was talking
[34:28] like you know some got mechanics and
[34:30] some got Dynamics and the one side
[34:32] doesn't see the need for the other
[34:33] and at some point you gotta you gotta
[34:36] come and draw a need somewhere to
[34:37] somewhere else
[34:39] so one of the things that
[34:42] that we have is the great crush and I
[34:45] think some people in their minds they
[34:48] get this idea that that's all they are
[34:51] like they're just something to be
[34:53] crushed right but even a great Crush
[34:56] was something on the inside and it I'm
[34:59] not light by any stretch of the
[35:00] imagination but something on the inside
[35:02] of a great crush it doesn't matter what
[35:04] label that people have put on you what
[35:06] age they put it on you what they've said
[35:08] about you or anything else whatever that
[35:10] label is it doesn't matter so you can
[35:13] think of yourself and I know this it
[35:14] happens all the time children when
[35:16] they're young and people put ideas in
[35:18] their heads and that idea sticks with
[35:20] them and so they think they're a great
[35:22] Crush for the rest of their life but
[35:24] Jesus Christ can change that situation
[35:26] he can change that thinking simply
[35:29] because he can put himself on the inside
[35:31] and do something for you okay so Christ
[35:35] can do that for you
[35:39] okay
[35:40] so let's say we're a Cactus Cooler
[35:43] and I don't know if you can see that
[35:46] but it's pretty beat up
[35:49] right
[35:50] it's very beat up
[35:52] but the one thing is is that it's full
[35:55] so as long as it's full
[35:57] it doesn't matter that it's beat up
[35:59] because it's full on the inside right
[36:02] there's something on the inside that can
[36:04] can do something for it
[36:06] oh that wasn't good
[36:09] um so I just wanted to make sure I'll
[36:11] get that later
[36:13] um just leave it
[36:16] it wasn't soda pop just saying so
[36:20] um but it'll be something that that can
[36:24] be done I'm trying to see what I did
[36:26] with that other can
[36:31] you crush another one for me
[36:34] thank you what's up yeah just there
[36:36] that's fine
[36:41] thank you
[36:46] so one of the things that we can see
[36:48] about this particular can is that once
[36:50] it's been crushed
[36:52] there's not a lot that I can do
[36:54] personally so I want to put something in
[36:57] it right I want to help I want it to be
[36:59] capable and able to do what it has
[37:02] always done I want to make sure that it
[37:04] can so I can try and do my best
[37:07] to help
[37:10] I can try and get it back into shape I
[37:13] can try and move it
[37:14] I can try and do things
[37:19] and you know I can kind of maybe help it
[37:21] a little bit
[37:22] but the reality is is it takes somebody
[37:24] Beyond me to do this so guess where I
[37:27] can go
[37:28] a recycler
[37:30] right because a recycler can take this
[37:32] can
[37:33] and take it and do whatever they do and
[37:36] make it to where it can hold another
[37:38] soda pop again
[37:41] and that's just like Christ
[37:43] because what Christ can do
[37:45] is he's a redeemer
[37:48] and so if I can get people so far right
[37:51] like we can help and that's what we're
[37:53] here to do we can help them we can get
[37:55] them so far but the reality is it takes
[37:58] a redeemer to redeem them now that soda
[38:01] pop the the Dr Pepper can it may never
[38:04] be a Dr Pepper can again
[38:06] right it could be mixed up in 100
[38:08] different cans just depending on what
[38:10] the recycler does it but Christ doesn't
[38:13] do it that way he doesn't take you in
[38:15] reincarnate you into somebody else
[38:17] he just takes that person that you are
[38:20] and he repairs those damages and those
[38:22] things and fills you the person that you
[38:25] are and he realizes that they're scars
[38:27] that you know the funny thing about a
[38:29] can actually is if you take it and you
[38:30] put little scars on the outside if you
[38:33] open the can up you can see them more on
[38:34] the inside than you can on the out
[38:36] and that's kind of our lives right we
[38:38] have stuff inside and and we can see
[38:40] things more sometimes well if we had
[38:43] spiritual eyes we could see spiritually
[38:44] more as to what damage is happening to
[38:47] the person than what actually we can see
[38:49] on the outside because a lot of times
[38:51] the outside isn't a great reflection of
[38:53] what's taking place on the inside but we
[38:55] do know this when Christ enters your
[38:57] life the outside begins to reflect
[39:00] exactly what's on the inside
[39:02] right and and and and becomes a really
[39:04] good reflection of it
[39:13] do you want to bring up the next quote
[39:15] brother
[39:16] that'd be good
[39:21] this is from the exhibition of the seven
[39:23] Church ages
[39:24] the thyatiran church age
[39:26] it says in
[39:27] um in Ephesians 3 16 that he would Grant
[39:30] you according to the riches of his glory
[39:31] to be strengthened with might by his
[39:34] spirit in the inner man that Christ May
[39:36] dwell in your hearts by faith that he
[39:39] being rooted and grounded in love may be
[39:40] able to comprehend with All Saints what
[39:42] is the breadth and length and depth and
[39:44] height and to know the love of Christ
[39:46] which passed all understanding
[39:54] sorry I've somehow flipped my notes
[39:56] around
[39:57] oh here we go
[40:00] then you might be filled with the
[40:01] fullness of God sorry now according to
[40:03] these verses when a man experiences the
[40:05] depth of God in his life it is an actual
[40:07] personal experience
[40:09] of the spirit of God indwelling him and
[40:12] his mind is illuminated by the wisdom
[40:14] and knowledge of God through the word
[40:17] so we realize that what is filling us
[40:20] it's it's a fullness of God
[40:22] right it's not a fullness of me it's a
[40:25] fullness of the Lord
[40:27] and so just kind of focusing on this
[40:30] idea of being pillars in this day
[40:33] and I I guess I just kind of want to
[40:35] bring this particular thought out
[40:38] being a pillar doesn't necessarily mean
[40:40] that you're going to not make mistakes
[40:42] and will Maybe cover one of those in in
[40:44] just a moment and it doesn't necessarily
[40:46] mean that you're not going to be crushed
[40:49] right
[40:50] so
[40:51] um
[40:52] those things can happen there there are
[40:54] things that can happen in your life but
[40:56] the important part is is there's a
[40:58] redeemer
[40:59] there's somebody that can can make sure
[41:01] that that's taken care of and they can
[41:04] fix those kind of things and make sure
[41:05] that you don't have that particular
[41:07] thing going on so
[41:10] um
[41:12] when when that Redeemer steps into that
[41:15] role he's fulfilling his mission
[41:18] and you as pillars in the church so
[41:21] let's put it this way so um people there
[41:24] are pillars in everything so democracy
[41:26] there's pillars of democracy so one of
[41:29] those pillars of democracy is that you
[41:31] get to vote so if if you don't have the
[41:33] ability to to actually voice what it is
[41:36] that is on your mind an elector
[41:37] representative you don't really have a
[41:39] democracy
[41:40] because then you have a dictatorship or
[41:42] you have some other kind of form of
[41:44] government but a democracy says the
[41:46] people get to vote and the people can
[41:48] vote their conscience and based on what
[41:50] their Conscience Says that that makes it
[41:53] a democracy if you take that away
[41:55] there's I think they say there's seven
[41:57] pillars to democracy if you take that
[41:59] particular pillar away democracy itself
[42:02] fails
[42:03] because it's no longer democracy when
[42:05] you say you know what you can't vote but
[42:07] you can do these other things I'm going
[42:08] to tell you what you want to do
[42:10] and we've seen governments do that they
[42:11] say I'm a democracy but uh what we're
[42:14] going to do is you can't go anywhere you
[42:16] can't like be out of your basement we're
[42:18] going to check on you if you're not in
[42:19] your basement we're going to come and do
[42:21] something to you because you're not
[42:22] there and it's like can we vote on this
[42:24] no no vote this is just the way it's
[42:26] going to be there isn't any voting
[42:28] happening so the the the situation has
[42:32] changed because of that pillar of
[42:34] democracy has changed that pillar has
[42:37] went away right and any pillars it
[42:40] doesn't matter so just like Samson in
[42:42] the two pillars if those pillars go away
[42:44] if something happens to the pillar then
[42:46] other things above it fall other things
[42:48] above it fail
[42:50] um
[42:51] so getting back to the the crush part of
[42:54] it and I think
[42:58] yeah
[42:59] so that would be
[43:01] um brother Branham and I use this story
[43:04] often for different reasons but brother
[43:07] Brandon uh talked about in in different
[43:09] sermons what happened with his daughter
[43:11] Sharon Rose
[43:12] and the one of the things that I think
[43:15] was really good that he brought out of
[43:17] that particular thing is that while
[43:20] crushing can happen there's something in
[43:22] that crushing that can actually take
[43:24] place where God turns it to good
[43:26] and so in the message here we have no
[43:29] continuing City he says oh my when I've
[43:31] seen that tender little blue baby I
[43:33] cross I didn't know it then but I
[43:35] understand now that there's never been a
[43:38] cross-eyed Child come in line but what I
[43:40] think of that there's never been one
[43:42] pass over the platform but what's been
[43:44] healed too
[43:45] I didn't know the crushing had to bring
[43:47] it forth but I never think of it till I
[43:49] see that
[43:50] so I don't want you to get the idea that
[43:52] I'm going to get the Holy Ghost and I'm
[43:55] going to have the word and nothing's
[43:57] going to affect me ever again
[43:59] that's not real
[44:01] because we're humans and things happen
[44:04] but what what is important to convey to
[44:08] you is that if something does happen and
[44:10] there is a crushing again we have a
[44:12] redeemer there is somebody that can take
[44:14] that thing whatever it was and work it
[44:17] around to where it's actually a benefit
[44:18] to others and to you because because he
[44:22] had that ability to put himself into
[44:25] that particular situation to see when
[44:27] these child children's eyes were crossed
[44:29] it not only healed it was a healing
[44:32] process for him right because he's
[44:35] getting healing every time that he sees
[44:37] this this little baby with crossed eyes
[44:39] and then he's like it reminds them of of
[44:41] his Sharon Rose but then when he prays
[44:45] in those eyes straighten then he's got
[44:47] that I realize my redeemer liveth I
[44:50] realize that he's still on the throne I
[44:52] realize that he's still with me I
[44:54] realize that he's still God I I know
[44:56] that he's part of me that he's got that
[44:59] for me and he's doing these things for
[45:01] me and I think that's just an important
[45:03] thing to to to realize is that when when
[45:07] things happen
[45:09] don't be disturbed by the fact that well
[45:12] I shouldn't say it that way let me
[45:13] rephrase it when things happen don't be
[45:15] overwhelmed by the fact that things have
[45:18] happened
[45:19] so when when something happens that's
[45:21] hurtful or crushing don't be overwhelmed
[45:23] by it understand that if you you get the
[45:26] word and and that spirit in the right
[45:28] place that that thing can be dealt with
[45:31] and not only that not only will it be
[45:33] dealt with but it'll be dealt with in
[45:35] such a way that it'll actually prove to
[45:36] be good for somebody down the road
[45:39] maybe not you in that moment and maybe
[45:42] not you right away but somehow it'll
[45:44] make you something better for somebody
[45:46] down the road and that's the kind of an
[45:49] idea of the pillars part that we're
[45:51] talking about tonight too is um
[45:54] is that are we already in an hour I can
[45:57] talk like in nobody's business
[45:58] apparently so don't worry we're almost
[46:00] done so we'll get there
[46:05] so
[46:07] um
[46:10] when
[46:12] when things happen
[46:13] there's always something you know to
[46:16] take place to to move upon the situation
[46:18] and God's able to do that
[46:21] uh and then the other thing I I want to
[46:24] convey to you is that we can seem to be
[46:27] pillars and and by that I
[46:31] I want to say just go to the next one
[46:34] the next slide
[46:37] so Galatians 2 9 and it says this and
[46:40] when James cephas and John who seem to
[46:42] be pillars perceived the grace that was
[46:44] given unto me they gave to me and
[46:45] Barnabas the right hands of Fellowship
[46:47] that we should go unto the Heathen and
[46:49] they unto the circumcision
[46:51] so Paul is recognizing that here's these
[46:54] men you know they were full of the Holy
[46:56] Ghost right day of Pentecost comes the
[46:58] Holy Ghost comes down they're absolutely
[47:00] full of the Holy Ghost uh things are
[47:02] happening people are added to the church
[47:04] thousands are added right Peter gets out
[47:06] there and starts talking about the Lord
[47:08] uh and telling them hey you can have the
[47:10] same thing too thousands are added to
[47:13] the kingdom and I think we could all
[47:15] agree P Peter was full of the Holy Ghost
[47:17] right I mean I don't know too many
[47:19] people that you know you walk by in your
[47:22] Shadow and it touches somebody
[47:24] and because of that
[47:26] not hands not anything you just it's
[47:29] just your Shadow just the shadow of the
[47:32] person walking by this is a man full of
[47:34] the Holy Ghost
[47:35] and yet Peter
[47:37] had a little bit of an issue
[47:40] right full of the Holy Ghost sealed
[47:42] signed delivered it's done right
[47:45] that's Peter
[47:47] but Paul is saying look at he seemed to
[47:50] be a pillar and he was
[47:52] to to people he was absolutely a pillar
[47:54] he was something that people were
[47:56] supported by he was somebody that they
[47:58] were looking to remember that the sheet
[48:00] was let down and Peter sees the sheet
[48:02] and it's like hey you know it was all
[48:05] these unclean things and it's like hey
[48:06] Peter take kill and eat and he's like
[48:08] all that lord I can't do that I've never
[48:10] done that and so another time it comes
[48:11] down another time it comes down and it's
[48:13] telling him hey the Gentiles are going
[48:15] to receive this gospel like this isn't
[48:17] just going to be for the Jews it's going
[48:19] to be also for for a people that you
[48:21] know with without a country without a
[48:23] you know a kingdom without that it's
[48:24] going to come to this other group of
[48:26] people
[48:27] and we realized that Peter just by birth
[48:30] was this big fisherman right he was kind
[48:33] of like a strong personality he was a
[48:36] great guy so we get to the Garden of
[48:38] Gethsemane and when they're coming to
[48:40] get with the Lord with with Judas what
[48:43] does Peter do
[48:45] he's not afraid
[48:46] he's got soldiers coming they're armed
[48:48] he's got all these people they're
[48:50] gathered he whips out a sword right he's
[48:52] going to do something about this and
[48:54] cuts off a guy's ear so that's our Peter
[48:56] right he's hey I'm I'm he's he's he's
[48:59] kind of this at this time he's kind of
[49:02] this right this is what he is
[49:05] he's strong in and of himself he's
[49:08] confident in of himself but right now
[49:11] who's he with he's with a group of
[49:13] people he doesn't care about
[49:15] right right as soldiers he don't care
[49:17] about the soldiers they're just Gentile
[49:18] heathens what difference does that make
[49:20] and he's protecting his Lord
[49:22] but not too far soon Peter is on another
[49:27] whole level with a different group
[49:30] because he gets in with the folks that
[49:33] are Jews that are about to crucify
[49:34] Christ and they start saying hey you're
[49:36] that guy he's like no I'm not that guy I
[49:39] don't what are you talking about I'm not
[49:40] that guy at all
[49:42] this is not me
[49:44] I'm this
[49:46] I'm not this definitely not this
[49:49] so he's saying hey I'm I'm not that
[49:51] person I don't know what you're thinking
[49:52] in fact he he curses to to let him know
[49:55] like you know I I'm definitely not
[49:57] identified with that guy but who was he
[49:59] dealing with
[50:00] he was dealing with the Jews so it's no
[50:03] longer the soldiers that are saying hey
[50:04] you're that guy it's his people and once
[50:08] his people start saying it then Peter's
[50:10] like no that's not me
[50:12] sorry
[50:13] so um next slide Galatians 2 11-14 it
[50:17] says but when Peter was come to Antioch
[50:19] I withstood him to the face because he
[50:21] was to be blamed for before that certain
[50:23] came from James he did eat with the
[50:25] Gentiles but when they were come he
[50:27] withdrew and separated himself fearing
[50:28] them which were of the circumcision
[50:30] and the other Jews dissembled likewise
[50:32] with him in so much that Barnabas also
[50:34] was carried away with their
[50:35] dissimulation so in other words the kind
[50:37] of the deceitful thing like Peter's
[50:39] acting like I'm not I'm not with these
[50:41] people don't you know and everybody
[50:43] follows Peter because he was a pillar
[50:45] like there's a guy full of the Holy
[50:47] Ghost this is a guy whose Shadow is
[50:49] making a difference in people's lives
[50:51] I mean ain't laying on hands it's I'm
[50:53] just walking by I mean amazing right but
[50:57] I think brother Branham covered this
[50:58] really well and and you know doors in a
[51:01] door is that you can have parts of your
[51:04] heart so look at you can have the Holy
[51:06] Ghost and be filled and sealed but you
[51:09] can still have like a door of pride
[51:12] right or a door of jealousy or a door of
[51:15] anger
[51:15] you know you can name off whatever doors
[51:17] that you want so in in Peter's case he
[51:21] didn't have a fear of everybody
[51:24] he had a pride issue with just people
[51:27] from his group
[51:28] so even though the Lord had let this
[51:31] thing down and he'd seen it and
[51:33] something had happened and that he was
[51:34] aware that you know God has went to the
[51:36] Gentiles and he's hanging out with the
[51:37] Gentiles when the Jews came and he knew
[51:41] that they were going to be offended that
[51:42] he was with the Gentiles he just went
[51:44] right back to something that he'd done
[51:46] before he had a man full of the Holy
[51:48] Ghost
[51:48] so
[51:50] again I want you to understand that
[51:52] sometimes we can
[51:54] we're pillars and we can be pillars or
[51:57] sometimes we could seem like we're
[51:58] pillars and and there's something that
[52:00] has to be taken care of and again once
[52:02] that area gets filled it's not not a
[52:05] problem right it's not something that's
[52:07] going to crush you it's not going to
[52:08] something that's going to lead you
[52:09] astray or cause you to run off or to do
[52:11] something unusual
[52:14] [Applause]
[52:16] is this clock even working
[52:21] that clock's not even working
[52:22] deceived by time
[52:24] [Music]
[52:27] well I'm doing better than I expected
[52:33] so we understand from the scripture that
[52:36] we need to be filled and but there are
[52:39] areas in our life that even when we have
[52:41] the baptism of the Holy Ghost even when
[52:43] we've been reading the word even when
[52:44] these things are are becoming a part of
[52:46] us right the scripture says you know
[52:49] I've I've hidden your your uh I think it
[52:51] was David said you know your word I've
[52:53] hidden in my heart so that I wouldn't
[52:55] sin against you so those things are
[52:57] hidden in our heart but there might be
[52:58] places where
[52:59] we didn't hide it right we didn't fill
[53:02] that particular aspect of it but the
[53:04] Lord doesn't Lord didn't like get rid of
[53:06] Peter right it wasn't like okay Peter
[53:09] yeah you were a great example of the
[53:10] Holy Ghost up until this point and from
[53:12] now on it's over right I'm not going to
[53:14] do anything about that it's completely
[53:16] over
[53:17] but what he did do was was like through
[53:20] Paul said hey Peter this is a problem
[53:23] you need to fix this problem and as far
[53:25] as we know it was from that point on
[53:26] taken care of so that's where we can
[53:29] step in we can be Paul was then a pillar
[53:31] to Peter and you can go through the
[53:33] scripture there are people that are
[53:34] pillars all over the place so uh David
[53:37] he's a young boy right says he's ready
[53:39] so he's like a Rosy cheeked brother
[53:41] Branham said he was you know just a
[53:42] skinny little guy and
[53:46] he was just a skinny little guy but yet
[53:49] he goes out and kills you know the Giant
[53:52] and once he's killed that giant David
[53:55] becomes a pillar of Courage as just a
[53:57] young skinny ready looking kid just a
[54:01] youth he becomes that pillar to somebody
[54:04] else and and by the way with the Sprite
[54:07] the reason that I chose this is because
[54:08] you know what a Sprite is
[54:10] it's just supposed to be like somebody
[54:11] small and diminutive kind of like a you
[54:13] know the Elf or whatever but just
[54:15] somebody small
[54:16] so even a Sprite
[54:19] so even somebody Young
[54:21] and and that can be filled
[54:24] and will stand something that that
[54:26] somebody that isn't can't
[54:29] and just like David he had all those
[54:31] people around him all these big soldiers
[54:33] all the you know great adult you know
[54:35] fighting men are there all with armor
[54:37] and everything else but Christ had
[54:40] revealed to him you know what kind of
[54:43] power he had and so the spirit of the
[54:44] Lord had come upon him and so just as a
[54:47] young boy he was he was that Sprite and
[54:50] all the other soldiers are like this and
[54:52] it's like what you know even the Giants
[54:53] like this and he's like what are you
[54:55] doing here
[54:56] well I got something
[54:58] I might be a Sprite in your eyes but in
[55:01] God's eyes I'm way bigger than this
[55:03] so I I'm filled with something that you
[55:05] don't have and I think that's just an
[55:08] important thing that that we get to
[55:10] um one of the things I I wanted to say
[55:12] as well is when the spirit of the Lord
[55:15] comes upon you
[55:17] and I think sometimes people think that
[55:19] this is what they're supposed to do
[55:20] because when the spirit of the Lord
[55:23] comes upon you and and uh or you know
[55:25] you're filled with the Holy Ghost and
[55:26] the word is a part of your life and all
[55:28] those things it's not like that you're
[55:30] going to go out and go
[55:32] whoa I'm come on devil let's do this
[55:35] thing right that's not what we're doing
[55:37] we're not pulling back our our shirt and
[55:39] revealing our Superman or Superwoman you
[55:42] know s on our our chest it's that you
[55:45] realize that in the situation that you
[55:48] have a piece about this and that you're
[55:51] able to overcome whatever it is that
[55:53] that is being sent your way not because
[55:55] you have a particular power but because
[55:58] you have authority over these things
[56:00] that's been given to you by Jesus Christ
[56:02] so it's not I am I'm super I don't know
[56:06] how Superman does it but you know they
[56:07] rip their shirt open kind of thing and
[56:09] and say I'm I'm ready to do battle but
[56:12] when the battle comes
[56:14] you're able to withstand it when the
[56:17] pressure comes that pillar is able to
[56:19] withstand it when those things are
[56:21] happening the pillar is able to
[56:22] withstand it and so I'm whining down
[56:25] here so what I want to get to just at
[56:27] the end here is that
[56:29] um the reason that I I did the the
[56:31] initial tile the way that I did was
[56:33] because different people are pillars for
[56:36] different reasons
[56:37] and
[56:39] um in this particular picture I know
[56:41] maybe it looks off-center to you but
[56:43] there's a purpose in doing that
[56:45] and a lot of times we look at the big
[56:47] thing right so we're looking at this
[56:49] particular this is supposed to be the
[56:51] the walls of Jericho so this is the end
[56:53] of the wall of Jericho
[56:54] and you'll see just out of the window
[56:57] there that Scarlet thread
[57:00] and so Rahab
[57:01] uh being moved upon by the Lord
[57:06] um and fearing God and fearing what what
[57:08] God was doing in the Israelites by faith
[57:12] the scripture says she did what she did
[57:14] and placed this in her in her window
[57:17] so Rahab by the way is mentioned in the
[57:20] in the generation that Matthew says of
[57:23] Jesus Christ
[57:24] as one of those people that's in
[57:27] actually the the lineage or the
[57:28] generation of Christ and it's because
[57:31] that she had taken the Scarlet thread
[57:33] and placed it for people to see
[57:36] the strength of that building wasn't or
[57:39] let's put it this way if if there is
[57:41] workers that are working on this
[57:43] particular section of the building and
[57:44] they're like you know what I don't
[57:45] really care about the the ruler of
[57:48] Jericho I don't really care about the
[57:50] princes I don't really care let's take
[57:52] the best materials and put them on the
[57:54] this wall in this corner
[57:56] because that's what people are going to
[57:58] think right oh the guys that were
[58:00] building this thing must have done
[58:01] something special to this section like
[58:04] could you imagine the conversation you
[58:06] know in the in the in the kingdom when
[58:08] two guys are talking they're the workers
[58:09] are like hey this is like the best stone
[58:11] we've got let's put it over here the
[58:14] king he don't need it right who's going
[58:16] to do that nobody but that's how we
[58:18] scientifically want to work things
[58:20] around somebody's going to do something
[58:22] but here's Rahab and she becomes a
[58:25] pillar not just to her family
[58:28] but she becomes a pillar in the
[58:31] generation of Christ and she becomes a
[58:33] pillar to us because that we look back
[58:35] and see that here's a woman that was of
[58:37] ill Fame who had serious family issues
[58:41] and serious life issues and all these
[58:44] other things but yet she becomes a
[58:46] pillar for Generation after generation
[58:48] after generation and we can look back
[58:51] and the reason that I have it above that
[58:53] spaceship above that Scarlet thread is
[58:56] simply because what we're built upon
[58:59] isn't the spaceship what we're built
[59:02] upon is that Scarlet thread so in other
[59:05] words our foundation goes back to to
[59:07] that sacrifice it goes back to that
[59:09] place and while they had to put it on
[59:12] the outside the amazing thing is is that
[59:15] we actually now have it on the inside
[59:16] and then it shows on the outside
[59:18] so she couldn't do that if she pulled it
[59:20] into the window ain't gonna show outside
[59:22] she had to leave it outside and so
[59:24] brother Brandon was talking about hey
[59:25] put those things on display but we have
[59:27] it on the inside and that inside begins
[59:29] to show on the outside what's there
[59:31] what's actually a part of you and what's
[59:34] occurring inside of you
[59:36] so I want to leave you with
[59:40] with just this thought
[59:43] and I gotta find the place in my notes
[59:44] because I've thrown them all over the
[59:45] place going through this but
[59:49] you know we talked about different
[59:50] labels that that are on the cans
[59:53] and different things and the the thing
[59:56] about like I said earlier the thing
[59:57] about a label is that you can't you
[1:00:00] can't
[1:00:01] um
[1:00:02] well let's put it this way people tend
[1:00:04] to put on labels on people simply
[1:00:06] because of one personal experience
[1:00:09] so in other words I I respond this way
[1:00:12] to this situation therefore everyone
[1:00:15] else will respond like me
[1:00:17] so it's just kind of like you know you
[1:00:19] have the conversation before the
[1:00:20] conversation
[1:00:21] I'm going to go and see this person
[1:00:22] because I have to deal with something
[1:00:24] here and I know if I say this they're
[1:00:26] going to say this and if I say this
[1:00:28] they're going to say this and you know
[1:00:29] if I say this they're going to say this
[1:00:31] and you have the whole conversation
[1:00:33] before you get there and guess what you
[1:00:34] say the first thing and they say nothing
[1:00:36] in response that was like what you
[1:00:37] thought
[1:00:38] because everything is based on this is
[1:00:40] how I think and now they're you know
[1:00:42] because we're comparing ourselves to
[1:00:44] ourselves and that's a really tough
[1:00:45] place to be when you compare yourself to
[1:00:47] yourself you're not going to get the the
[1:00:49] same response that's kind of how it goes
[1:00:51] so so people think of those things and
[1:00:54] they they they do those things simply
[1:00:57] because we compare ourselves by
[1:00:59] ourselves and people put on labels so
[1:01:01] like the label I talked about you know
[1:01:03] how the Canada Dry is going to hug the
[1:01:05] Cactus Cooler so the the intellectual
[1:01:07] scholarly you know psychologist is is
[1:01:10] needs to hug the the the Holy Ghost Baby
[1:01:15] Fantastical Pentecostal person
[1:01:18] right guess where the labels came from
[1:01:21] it wasn't the people that are are those
[1:01:23] you know if if you're labeled
[1:01:25] intellectual you're not going around
[1:01:27] going hey I'm an intellectual thank you
[1:01:30] very much and the other ones aren't
[1:01:32] going around like whoa I am glory to God
[1:01:35] I am a holy ghost baby right
[1:01:38] they're not doing that
[1:01:41] but because of what we perceive or what
[1:01:44] we see
[1:01:45] that's what happens
[1:01:47] that that's where we get to right so if
[1:01:50] the musicians would make their way
[1:01:51] forward
[1:01:59] so we know this labels are put on right
[1:02:02] people are labored
[1:02:04] and
[1:02:06] we label pillars we label different
[1:02:08] things but I wanna I I want you to just
[1:02:11] have this kind of idea because we've
[1:02:12] used these things to just show labels
[1:02:14] and ingredients and things that are in
[1:02:16] there and you know one of the things
[1:02:19] about Dr Pepper is they've got 23
[1:02:21] flavors and they allege that Dr Pepper
[1:02:23] doesn't share the flavors like you're
[1:02:25] not going to go on the website and Dr
[1:02:27] Pepper is going to say here's what's in
[1:02:29] a Dr Pepper but they have 23 flavors I
[1:02:32] actually have them in my notes I could
[1:02:33] list them off but we'll save time and
[1:02:34] not do that but so we don't really know
[1:02:37] right so you may not always know what's
[1:02:39] inside a person right you may not know
[1:02:41] all those 23 flavors or whatever flavors
[1:02:43] they have
[1:02:44] but this much I do know that when Christ
[1:02:47] puts a label on somebody he knows what's
[1:02:51] in there
[1:02:52] he absolutely knows what's there
[1:02:55] and it allows you to be a pillar whether
[1:02:58] it's to the community to your family to
[1:03:01] your spouse to your church whatever it
[1:03:03] is
[1:03:04] it's because he absolutely knows what's
[1:03:06] there so let's just just as we close
[1:03:09] tonight
[1:03:11] why don't you stand you've been sitting
[1:03:12] for a while
[1:03:14] Christ does this when he labels us he
[1:03:18] labels Us Faithful
[1:03:20] he labels us true
[1:03:23] he labels this lights in the midst of
[1:03:25] darkness and this isn't going to be an
[1:03:26] all-encompassing list but it's just a
[1:03:27] few that popped into my head
[1:03:30] he labels us a glorious Church
[1:03:32] he labels us forgiven
[1:03:35] he labels us Overcomers
[1:03:38] he labels us conquerors
[1:03:40] believers
[1:03:42] beloved
[1:03:44] chosen
[1:03:46] bride
[1:03:49] and any other label that you'd like to
[1:03:51] add that comes from the word of God he
[1:03:53] labels us those things
[1:03:55] because he knows inside of you is him
[1:03:59] so again the strength of the building
[1:04:01] wasn't the building it was the Scarlet
[1:04:03] thread
[1:04:05] the the strength to get into outer space
[1:04:07] wasn't the people that are sitting in
[1:04:09] the capsule it was the fuel pushing them
[1:04:11] out there right the strength our
[1:04:13] strength is not what people label us as
[1:04:17] because people are going to label you
[1:04:19] I'm sorry that's what people do
[1:04:21] it starts in school
[1:04:22] and it just keeps going on through your
[1:04:24] whole life people like to label things
[1:04:26] but thank God he labels us and and we
[1:04:30] can look in the mirror and go I don't
[1:04:31] see that Lord
[1:04:32] but it's not what you see it's what he
[1:04:35] sees because he knows what's on the
[1:04:37] inside he knows what label applies so
[1:04:40] chosen bride right forgiven
[1:04:43] faithful true
[1:04:46] lights
[1:04:48] all these things Christ knows exactly
[1:04:51] what's there for you
[1:04:53] so
[1:04:55] what that says I just like to say God
[1:04:56] bless you I appreciate the opportunity
[1:04:59] to speak to you this evening
[1:05:01] we we know that the Lord has got
[1:05:03] everything under his control
[1:05:05] and that um
[1:05:07] the power of God is a real thing
[1:05:09] and being pillars of Christ that is a
[1:05:13] real thing it's not something made up
[1:05:15] it's not something it's a real thing
[1:05:17] just like there are pillars in different
[1:05:19] walks of life and I had a lot of
[1:05:22] examples I had to cut them out just to
[1:05:24] save time
[1:05:25] but
[1:05:27] we have these different pillars and we
[1:05:30] can actually be pillars to a generation
[1:05:33] you can be pillars just to your family
[1:05:36] you can be and and the important thing
[1:05:38] is is that if that pillar is full
[1:05:41] of the right thing
[1:05:42] when the pressure comes and that that
[1:05:44] squeeze comes down and those that
[1:05:46] hardship hits you
[1:05:48] you can withstand
[1:05:50] not because of you but there's a grace
[1:05:52] of God that's over your life every day
[1:05:56] may not feel it every day may not see it
[1:05:59] every day but every day the grace of God
[1:06:01] is covering you every day he's taking
[1:06:03] care of you every day he's able to make
[1:06:06] you a pillar in the house of God
[1:06:09] he's able to it's not just he's he's
[1:06:12] both the foundation and the pillar right
[1:06:16] and everything supports off that so God
[1:06:19] bless you this evening I appreciate you
[1:06:20] being an attentive audience I I hope you
[1:06:22] it wasn't too simple for you
[1:06:25] um but I just wanted to I just thought
[1:06:28] it was it was good to to let people know
[1:06:30] you know we talk about it all the time
[1:06:31] oh you need to be filled you got to be
[1:06:33] filled but what is it what does that
[1:06:35] mean
[1:06:35] so hopefully at least you got something
[1:06:38] like you understand what it is to be
[1:06:40] filled so all right God bless you this
[1:06:42] evening what are you playing brother
[1:06:43] sorry
