TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I I'm going to continue on what we were ministering on Sunday morning I will give a little bit of a review so that we're all kind of on the same page and anyone who wasn't there uh won't be completely caught off guard but we ministered on between death and life and we were looking at the resurrection and the death of Christ and then his living after death and in that between death and life we were looking at the tomb and we called it the mystery of the Tomb we're just going to call this a part two kind of a continuation of the Resurrection story but then bringing it to where we are today with some themes and some types that are applicable to the resurrection that we're experiencing in this hour because brother brandom said that was a resurrection he said what a resurrection that was and he says what a resurrection this is and there's been another Resurrection out of Darkness another Resurrection out of uh death and we were using this uh quote from turn on the light and so the themes in Shalom and there's a man here who can turn on the light and some of those themes about light coming and thy light being here has been really inspiring to me in this subject he said God never speaks a word unless he's got a reason for speaking that word he's not like you and I that we just or especially myself that speak so many foolish things God speaks every word with a meaning and something that he's trying to achieve and will achieve by his word and it will perform exactly what he said it will do now we know that God interprets his word by bringing it to pass so when he says it'll perform exactly what he said he will do a lot of people wrestle with the black and white of the prophecy and reject the flesh that comes to fulfill the prophecy CU they get real hung up on the way something's worded not realizing that God's the one that is the one that interprets these things a and yet we believe it and we ought to believe it with all our heart I was uh going back over some things uh uh just over the scriptures where it's happened this way that it might be fulfilled and we saw some of that on Sunday and you go back and you could read some of those things that the Bible says in the prophecy and what takes place you realize wow I'm glad he's telling me that because we wouldn't necessarily been been able to put the two together but when God speaks something he's got a reason for speaking it and he speaks a word with the purpose to bring it to pass and that that's at the real core of those things we were looking at in the resurrection is why was it a tomb hollowed out of a rock and why was it a tomb that no man had ever laid in before and why was he wrapped in clean linen and all these specific details that are given to us we believe even if we don't quite catch it ourselves we just believe that God has a reason in doing that we used this concept and maybe I can work through this pretty quickly on a black box I just want to remind you of this uh very quickly he said a black box we looked at as a complex model or system uh that's not easily interpreted in other words you can't explain it you can you can see you can see what it produces but you don't know exactly how it produces it and and so it's something that's not easily understood uh or it's it's not straightforward and we looked at it from the standpoint that it's a system that can be viewed by the inputs that go in and the process that we results in but in the in between it's called the black box because you're just not exactly sure you know what goes in you see what comes out but you're not sure what's taking place behind that curtain to make it all come together and work and so that is a system that we view in terms of inputs and outputs but you don't really have knowledge or understanding of how that it works you could even say for some of us the our cars are a black box because we put gas in it and we start it we push the gas and we push the brake and it all seems to work but yet we don't understand the inner workings of of of a car but there's certain things that are a true Black Box where it takes very special knowledge or or an intimate understanding of the details in in behind the the structure to know how it's working and a black box it's they use that phrase black or opaque because you can't see it uh is one way they're looking at the light doesn't can't enter into it but it means also it's not easy to be understood even if you could see all the components you're not sure how they're interacting together to produce a result so we say the Box holds a mystery you see something before you see something after you can understand certain parts but I don't know how this works the internal workings I don't have understanding of how it produces it and that's what we're looking at there's a there's a mystery to it because the inner workings are a secret or they're hidden hidden so we looked at it this way Jesus Christ is verified according to scripture to be dead on the cross he dies the scripture give witness the Centurion Witnesses it pilate verifies it Joseph arthea takes the body down wraps it in clean linen uh and brings it to a grave he not of a stone H not of a rock in the side of a hill and and we see all these things and there's evidence clear evidence that he's dead he goes in the Tomb the stone great stone is rolled over the tomb it is sealed there's guards that are set watch and then the next thing we know he starts appearing and the only thing we know is that there's been an earthquake and the stones rolled away and the angel of Lord is saying he's not here and so what we don't see is the actual elements of that resurrection and the transformation from a body that was dead into a body that was alive so he enters the tomb dead and all of a sudden we find him outside of the Tomb alive and I'm looking at it from this standpoint there wasn't visible there was not Witnesses of that transformation from Death to life they saw life go to death on the cross he he he uttered cried out and then gave up the ghost it's finished and gives up the ghost so there's a witness of life into death but now death transforming into life the tomb hid that transformation so it's kind of this hidden Mystery between death and the life after death is in that black box is in that tomb and we looked at it from this standpoint that between death and life there was God there was the word and we could bring a lot of scriptures out in this way that stood there in in in that tomb as one that would preserve the body from corruption as a hiding place from that corruption and as the one that would raise him up from the dead and God is even that we could say in a way he's a black box he's not easily be to understood something where there's no clear explanation you just believe him something that's difficult to understand and explain uh he's unsolvable he he's he he's his thoughts are Beyond ours his way in the water we can't even see so it it it's God is that mystery that was there in behind the tomb that raised him from the dead the Bible says him Jesus Christ God raised up the third day and showed him openly and the the transformation from Death to life we don't see that take place but he does present the sun over 500 see him and he appears to his disciples he appears to Mary there's so much uh uh that is done in public after that but the tomb where he was laid was not just a place to lay his body but we were using it as a place that God could work it was a sacred meeting place a secret meeting place hollowed out of a stone hollowed out of a rock and in darkness in the Rock behind the stone God did something did something secret did something hidden did something unexplainable and you say well God did it and say well how did he do it you say well it' be by his word well how how did the word work there God said let there be light and there was light how and and what a scientist wants to do is say well his breath contained this and and those those chemicals in his breath interacted with these other elements and as they begin to collide it created a firmament and as it begin to burn it was this Perpetual cycle of burning and they'd want to be able to explain it but really we have to just say by faith we believe God created the heavens and the Earth it's kind of a mystery to us it's unexplainable but we know it was God it was God using his word and yet we realize that it's uh so we could see the word we could see the results but how it works God hides it it's unexplainable and so they in darkness I feel like we're all kind of on the same page and this is what I couldn't really some of these things is what I couldn't get to on Sunday but death is secretly reversed in the rock it was the resurrection of Jesus Christ in Isaiah CH 53:5 it says but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed the resurrection was the guarantee of those things H it was it was the proof and the evidence that he was who he said he was and he was wounded for our transgressions bruised for our iniquities our peace uh was chastised upon him with his stripes we are healed and when he raises up Christ from the dead he forever consecrates a way that we could have that peace that we could have our sins forgiven that our iniquities would be washed away and our healing has been purchased and where therefore we have this promise in Romans chap 8: 10 and 11 if Christ be in you the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you so by his strife we are healed by his Spirit we are raised in the same way we are following in his steps a and that baptism of the Holy Ghost is the earnest of redemption it's a guarantee to us that we will be raised Incorruptible that just as he has a glorious body we will have a glorious body like unto his glorious body and now I realized I'm going to start just sandwiching maybe a lot of stuff together and and just stick with me if you could in the sermon who is this mzc and I I I made the intentional decision not to provide these quotations for no other reason other than I'd like you just to hear what he's saying and maybe not get lost in the reading because I may read faster uh than some of you or read slower than some of you uh can read on the slides so I just want to all of us stay together and focus on this and now brother Bram says and then when you become subject to that Spirit it throws your whole being subject to that spirit and that spirit is nothing in the world world but the seed word word made manifest or quickened Hallelujah Made Alive and when the Bible said don't do this the body quickly turns to it there's no question and what is it notice it's the earnest of the Resurrection I want you to catch this quickening power raised Christ from the dead it's that same spirit that dwells in you so we're just kind of pointing to the scripture and maybe I'm saying this just to for myself just to kind of have piece that these things link together and you're not just thinking brother Aaron's talking about his favorite vegetable again and nothing makes sense but that you just recognize some sort of connection here that in the Black Box we know was quickening power we may not know ex this exactly how it works we can't explain it but it met Christ there behind the stone and it raised him up according to the word according to prophecy now that same spirit is in Us by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and it's an Earnest that there'll be a resurrection so now there's got to be a connection to whatever was in that mystery box whatever was in that black box the body was raised up again because it's already start this body will be raised up again because it's already started it was once subject to sin andmed in corruption but now it's got Earnest it's turned Heavenly now that's the earnest that you're going in a Rapture praise the Lord Death means death just means a change of of dwell just a change of dwelling place for the moment here we are living in this world and it's a cursed Earth and it's a body that's uh dying and getting sick and could be healed uh only to get sick again but when you when you die you go into another dimension you go into another realm and your guarantee of a glorified body you've lived with all along if you've had the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen he says a sick person laying it's the earnest a sick person laying dying nothing left but death that's all can happen it's seen as Shadows of people done eat up with cancer I've seen Shadows of people done eat up with cancer and tuberculosis and see them persons a little while after that perfectly normal and strong and now there he's kind of changing a little bit in his his his uh emphasis here the earnest of the Rapture is the quickening power that's in You by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and he says I've seen people eaten up with cancer and tuberculosis that uh a little after a while they're perfectly normal and strong they were on the doorstep of death and now they're not anymore he says if there's no Divine Healing then there is no Resurrection cuz Divine Healing is the Earth Earnest of the Resurrection we we focused a lot of this in the series Christ my healer so there's if there's no Divine Healing there's no Resurrection Divine Healing is the earnest of the Resurrection amen you know what the earnest money is don't you it's the down payment he was wounded for our transgressions with his stripes we are healed notice how wonderful we love him he says so this is now I kind of did a little bit of a Switcheroo Christ is dead and he's and he raises again and now that's the resurrection that's what took place in the Tomb that's the mystery of the Tomb we could call a resurrection we can see that he's alive and he was dead so he was resurrected from the dead that Resurrection guarantees our Salvation it purchased our Salvation it paid the price we're washed from our sins as we receive that atonement and then and so that's a resurrection the quickening power of the Resurrection lives in you it's a guarantee of a change of your body so then brother brandham says then Divine Healing now is an earnest or points to the change of our body or Resurrection brother Bram says Divine Healing has more to it than just Divine Healing this is in the sermon 10 virgins he says Divine Healing has more to it than just Divine Healing that's quite a mouthful he says this Divine Healing only says that there is a God who's coming again Divine Healing reminds you of fullness of redemption Divine Healing tells you that when you've got the Holy Ghost you have power in you to create another world and go live on it you've got power to change this body in a moment in a twinkling of an eye you just got to have the faith to allow it to operate says there's a God who's coming again other words there's a promise he's given that you will step out of the Grave or that your body will be changed says what does Divine Healing speak of it's the earnest of our Resurrection if there's no Divine Healing then there is no Resurrection so the mystery of the Tomb is a resurrection from Death to life which Divine Healing is is a constant reminder of that's what Divine Healing points to it points to a resurrection So Divine Healing is point is saying that there's a God who's coming again but it's connected to the God who came in his son and has sent his son to die and rose again so it points back to the resurrection and reflects towards another resurrection and that's what Divine Healing ought to represent if we ever start majoring on the minor of Divine Healing it's when we forget what it represents not only past but present and future points to something now this could seem to be like a maybe just a a real sharp turn but I want to look at the third pool and had we had the time on Sunday I think we could have uh just woven this together maybe a little bit better uh but I I do want to uh just take a sharp turn and talk about the third pool in con contion with this we saw how in his resurrection last year when we looked at this again I remember I know you guys remember every single word so I don't have to say very much about it uh that in the mystery of uh between uh hell and heaven the mystery of Christ Ascension and we're already working on next year's sermon sister Elizabeth wrote down the title for me so I could just start working on the mystery uh you know what it was out we saw how that in his resurrection the third pool was being manifested and that he went and preached to the souls that are eternal lost and there's a lot of that image of the third pool then in Christ Min Ministry that relates to the third pool in this hour and so I want to look at the third pool and that using that phrase third pool is very familiar terminology to us and we know that it's connected to the ministry of brother brandom and this is the phrases I want to talk about so you can see it it fits with this black box it won't be a public show can't be impersonated said don't tell the people don't try to explain it it'd be like looking at a black box and trying to describe what's behind it in the the sermon after he's given I we'll come back to the or origins of the third pull uh when he ministers the sermon is this the sign of the end sir he connects the third pool to the seven Thunders that bring back The Headstone and he says the mystery that would opened up to us that would bring Christ bring power to the church in that very sermon he's connecting the third pool to the seven Thunders to Revelations 10 and the Very fulfillment is as John the Baptist foran the first coming there's a lot of things he begins to tie together in that he talks about the pyramid constellation of the Angels so there's a lot there's a lot of material that we have in the message of the hour as it unfolded from the first time that he shares the concept of three PS to the time that he begins to say to us we now know what it is and what it does it's the opener of the word and he's very definitive about it are we all on the same page and isn't everybody just excited whenever you mention the third pole Glory now the the phrase three pulls are the concept of first pull second pool and third pool is introduced in the sermon why are people so tossed about and I'll maybe repeat this that terminology was the language that the angel of the Lord used and brother brandham as he's there uh and as he's sharing this on January 1st of 1956 he's explaining where he had just been he's and he's praying dear Jesus I don't know what I'm going to do here I am right back where I started from again I guess I made a failure remember he's going to ask for his old job back uh he's not going to be ministering anymore there's just he feels this is the low point or he's I'm a failure I'm back to where I started so here's someone's Ministry the trajectory should be a certain way and he's saying that he crashed he's burned he's burned out it's over uh and Billy Paul's you know say reasoning with him he's so discouraged but it's in this prayer it's after this prayer I don't know what I'm going to do I'm a failure I'm starting all over that the Lord appears to him and gives him a vis ision with multiple parts and and brother brandham tells of this multi-part Vision in great detail in the sermon what is a vision and this is just a few months later after this this is in April after why are people so tossed about and the first part I just want to go over this very quickly and the first part he's in a meeting with brother Argan brigh a and then he says it's at that moment where he's in this meeting with brother arganbright that he went farther into the vision to the next part and in that part he's trying to to lace a little baby shoe with a little bitty 1/8 inch uh eyelets with a/ in string so 8 in eyelet halfin string he's trying to lace that booty and he's he's making a mess and the angel Lord says don't you understand that you can't teach babies Supernatural things so here he was trying to thread a half inch uh um string through an eighth of an inch eyelet and it wasn't going to work and this is this is how he entered further into the vision that's the first part then the second part he's standing by a lake surrounded by a fishermen who are trying to catch small fish they're they're fishing they're all fishing they're trying to catch these small fish but brother bam thinks about catching a rainbow trout he wants to go after something different doesn't want small fish he wants a rainbow trout and remember brother Brown's Ministry is different than all these other fishermen so he picks up a rod and this is what the vision and this is all the same vision he says the he said when you do now let the lure sink down first pull it slow then when you do now you'll feel some nibbles at it but don't tell nobody what you're doing keep it to yourself you can see him cast it Allure into the water you know it's gone in behind the water and that he may show some movement but you can't explain what's happening in the water don't do it don't try to explain it they can see you're fishing but you don't tell them exactly what you're doing that needs to remain a mystery it needs to be unexplained he says keep it to yourself he says you'll fill some nibbles at it but don't tell anybody what you're doing keep it to yourself then when you fill a nibble again pull just a little bit but don't pull too hard and then it'll pull it away from the little fish and when they scatter that will attract the attention of the big fish and they'll grab it right that's the way you'll catch it then when they bite on the third time set your hook for the catch and I said I understand but he said but keep still don't tell nobody keep still brother B like oh I I get it what a great idea I'm going to cast it out there I'm going to kind of move it a little bit that's going to attract attention a lot of little fish are going to gather around it I I I'm going to just do it a little bit more and when I do that the fish are going to move away but it's going to attract something else so there's an attraction taking place unseen there's things taking place in an invisible realm and then brother brandham says that the ministers got all enthused and he began to explain it and he pulled too hard on that second one and we could get into some more details details about it but that that CH uh that he does what he shouldn't have done and the angel said to him just what I told you not to do and I said yes that's right he said you see and this is the language of the the angel that first pull was when you used to put your hands on the people and tell them what their trouble was the second pull was when You' know the secet secrets of the heart like I told you he says instead of you keeping that to yourself you tried to explain all about it and tell the people and when you did you didn't know nothing about it yourself and how could you explain it I mean really how could you explain it if it's if it's something Supernatural it's a temporary Resurrection if he's taking people by the hand and things are happening a and he's able to tell what happened and then he's able just to know what's in someone's heart how do you explain that except that it's God how how do you explain that and get into the nitty-gritty and the angel even says you didn't even know anything about yourself it's a black box to you you can see the results but you can't explain it and you've caused a bunch of carnal impersonations to rise up and you see what you've done so this is in that and this is the language of the Angel the first pool and the second pool and a pull is he uses the phrase pull he uses attract attention he's using the phrase to catch it set your hook for the catch and and and in that language there's something there's a hidden hook H uh there there is a there is a hidden purpose that's impossible to explain that was the first part of the vision lacing the booty then he's fishing and then the third part of the same vision the same vision which we know that brother Brandon was never literally lacing a baby's booty and disappointed the Lord we know that he wasn't actually fishing and caught a trout a fish that was just skinned Over The Lure and didn't actually make a mess of his line and everything literally and brother B was reminding him of that and chastising him for doing it or we know that he never actually did those things in order for it to uh come to pass or be a warning so it's all part of this same vision and he says about in this third part that he that it says to go higher and go way up was the language that he's using and he saw a great tent and a little room in the middle and again let me remind you the term pull and thease first second and third are the Lord's words now you're all message students your message Believers I trust that you're listening to these things yourselves so that you're not just hearing it from me for the first time or you haven't only ever heard it from me because then there's could be a lot missing for you until you hear it for yourself he says this in the sermon being led of the Holy Spirit now this is just that next month that he's explaining this and in this uh tent this great Cathedral where there's this little room he begins to describe this portion this way there was a nice smooth uh speaking gentleman stepped out and said now whether why brother brandom's resting a little bit will the line well the will the prayer line uh will line the prayer line up said you all with the prayer Cards begin in a certain place line up to my right so now here in this tent he says while brother bram's resting we're going to have a prayer line so people with prayer cards line up what are they lining up for they're lining up for that healing for that Divine Healing and he said said so I looked over that would be to my left where I was standing and there was a little building sitting in there little building that's built like that and all the people oh just look like went around the tent out of city block or great of people and they were all standing around there with their prayer card and just then I seen a woman in an ambulance stretcher was laying and a man behind her was on crutches so they were standing there waiting their turn and there was a lady taking down their names and things and then there was a canvas stretched here that no one could get around that tent says now I want you to watch this and listen how it is now so you watch the difference are you able to just kind of create this mental picture you can see there's a tent great Cathedral likee tent and brother bandam in other places describes it in great detail it was even something he desired to have himself and he wanted to replicate these things was a burden that he had uh to see these things done a a a and actually manifest in a very literal way and he's describing this great long line and he says there was one woman in an ambulance stretcher another man on crutches and there's someone there taking the names of these people a and so these are all things he can describe and he could see but he says I want you to listen and watch this now and watch the difference then I heard something whipping around were were were like that always goes every time we have a healing service so he's seen this same thing this healing service this worrying around he talks about the that light and different things in different places that's just what happens that's the way it's always sounded sounded that way in the bush that time when I heard it it's always been that way I felt it I heard it rather going moving and I looked and here was that real soft light moving away from me and went down and went into that little building this is a building inside of a tent this is a room I think in one place it says 12T x 20 foot uh so maybe a little bit bigger than sometimes we might imagine it but he said it's a little building it's a little room it's this a separate structure within a structure kind of like how the Tabernacle was laid out you have an outer Court you have an inner Court you have the holiest of holies that there's a in there in this thing that's laid out uh he said there was uh something different he says he said that little light went into that little building he says and then there's something different between the light and the angel because he was still there with me and the light had went into that building and this Angel still speaking behind me which is a big man and I like the capitalized man there he said I will meet you in there so it won't just be the light he said but I will meet you in there and we're on the same page there they're in a meeting brother B's is feel he's looking up above he's seeing all these things transpire that worrying light that had been with him in the first pool and the second pool been with him in all these prayer lines it goes into that little room and now the Lord says I'll meet you in there and brother Bram says so then I said I don't understand why in there he said watch I'm getting excited about this now we've been doing fantastic with time I'm probably be back to preaching at an hour again he says and we'll come to this in a moment but since you all famili I'm looking out and I see everybody here is a solid message believer that knows these things has Revelations of these things and strong convictions in these things we know that one of the constant consistent them about the third pull that really comes into uh being an impression when he preaches the Seven Seals it won't be a public show don't try to explain it so it means it's going to be something hidden or unexplainable it may be observed in terms of inputs and outputs but really what it is is hidden really what it is is a secret now let's just look at a few places where brother Branham talks about a public show before this this the terminology is used in this Vision that he had brother brandom in one place is in a prayer line he said here's the patient but you're standing here like a public show Almost oh what will take place what will be the decision of this woman standing here the worrying of the light would have been here with them right there in the prayer line he said this is the way it's been in the healing service and he would stand on the platform and he'd take a hold of their hand and he would know what their problem was or or he would know in the second pull that he would very discern the very thoughts of their heart so those are all the same Dynamics he's saying these things were a public show here's a woman standing here in the prayer line like a public show another place he's praying won't you father please don't hold it against me to try like this would be a public show but Lord bless this dear woman and give her this great witness as she's watching my hand reverently KN one that her life is just a few more days unless that will help her so here he's saying I'm holding her she's watching my hand this cancer whatever it is May it go away so she can know that she's healed he says don't I I know don't hold it against me that it's public that it's going to be a public show or others are going to see and he says this to another lady he says I want you lady to be patient to watch you're the one that has the cancer once again prayer line an audience on the platform public stage says you're the one that has the cancer and he says our heavenly father thou knowest all things and I know that I'm not here trying to make a public to display Your Divine gifts but here he is so this is that language that he's using and and and he's it's on the platform now you can't necessarily explain the vibration in his hand but he could say there's the vibration and you can see it uh he's actually Discerning someone's thoughts in in their heart he's going back into their past he can see into their future he knows their very their name and where they live and that's broadcast it's expressed out there those are the things that in that first first pull and second pull the angel Lord is saying hey you've explained too much you've tried to tell the people and you didn't even know it about yourself so then brother Brown when he's describing this third part of the vision he says I seen that light leave me and go to that building and go in that building and a voice say I'll meet you in there that'll be the third pull I said why he said well it won't be a public show like the other so it goes into this room because it will not be a public show trust we're all on the same page so now let's back up just a little bit in that same place I was just reading and being led of the Holy Spirit and I looked and here went that real soft light moving away from me and went down and went to that little building and then there's something different between the light and the angel CU he was still there with me and the light went into that building and this Angel still speaking to me which is a big man and he said I will meet you in there so then I said I don't understand why in there he said watch so now this is Brother Bram is going to watch so that he can get understanding of what's transpiring to understand why in there and this woman when she come out of there on the ambulance stretcher so she went in there on an ambulance stretcher right yes ma'am so when he's describing this he says she's coming out she was pushing the stretcher out the other side this is exactly what brother Brown begins to describe it's something he even leaves out when he said it the first time and I get the feeling that he did it because he realized don't explain too much so he tells some of it and he's thinking uh kind of paint myself in a corner here maybe I shouldn't say too much maybe he's wondering how much do I share how much should I say so when he tells it this time he begins to share things that he didn't say the first time and he says that I'll meet you there that will be the third pole I don't understand so the Lord doesn't necessarily explain it he just says watch and you can pick up on something he says I want you to as he said I want you to kind of notice there and to see these things there there's something uh there's something different and so he says watch this woman that was laying on the ambulance stretcher goes into the little room on a stretcher but when she comes out she's pushing the stretcher Jesus went in the Tomb wrapped in clean Linens fresh Linens laid on a stone behind his Stone and he comes out free loose alive she's pushing the stretcher on the other side and she said the lady that was taking the names and writing things down the lady asked her what happened and saw the woman that went in on the ambulance stretcher she said I don't know it just happened she said I've been in this stretcher I've been down in bed for years but I went into the room sick I went in the room bound I went in the room dead and nobody saw it nobody can explain it nobody knows how it happened but now I'm pushing the thing I laid on on the other side and the lady wants to tell me what happened explain it to me explain it to me explain to me what happened explain to me what it means and I say I don't know all I know I was dead all I know I was crippled oh I know I didn't have health and now I'm pushing the very thing that I laid on explain it to me I can't but I'm alive and here come the man out packing his crushes and they asked him what he said he didn't know and he was coming to the platform to testify you see that it's real simple this is just as simple as what we were saying on Sunday something's happening in that room unexplainable unseen but we know the man's there we know Christ is there it's a meeting place and people go in sick and they come out well the sermon what is a vision he says this he says well I noticed the prayer line I'm just going to add a little bit more body to this we're going to be wrapping this up here pretty soon so if you want me to preach longer you going have to pull harder so I noticed the prayer line seemed like it went all around the tent and out and down the street such a prayer line and I looked over which was this to my left and that would be to my right if I was standing on the platform would be that way there's a piece of canvas stretched there and in behind this canvas was a little square building about 12T across and 20 foot long something like that well I stood and looked at that and I seen them bringing a lady upon a stretcher and there was a lady taking her name and things on a paper and so there was someone come and got her and pushed her through now what I love about this is someone could record their name their sickness their condition and everything wrong and the next man come through with his crutches and I see them go through that little building they enter in and he says and on the outside the lady come out screaming to the top of her voice pushing this stretcher and then there was another lady on the other side looked kind of like a dark-haired woman and she said what happened and she said I just don't know she said I couldn't tell you what happened I've been paralyzed for 20 years and looky I feel like I was never sick oh you talk about a healing you talk about a change I was paralyzed for 20 years and I feel like I was never sick and just didn't come out the man leaping and jumping with his crutches in his hand and I looked at that now here's something notice close there was a difference between the angel of the Lord and that light because I heard something a moving and as it does when it comes here on the platform at night kind of like brother makes a sound like a fire whipping around licking Blaze and it left me and went right down over top of that audience and went down and stood over the top of the little building then it settled down on top of it and then when it did this one that was standing by uh by me behind me the same voice the Angel's voice he said I will meet you there and this is the third pole but nobody will know anything about it I said well I don't understand why in there why there he he said it will not be a public show this time people will go in behind the veil people will go in behind the canvas people go in behind the little room behind the tent they'll go in there and they'll be changed and they won't be able to explain it you'll just have to experience it for yourself coming back to that sermon being led of the spirit he said' I don't understand that in there he's still saying it after it happened said I'll meet you there it won't be a public show brother BR still saying I don't understand that in there I I I I'm not quite picking up what's happening he says and watch here's always script he it's always scriptural he said are you listening it's 807 in and out it's not going to be crowed by the time you get there did not our Lord say when thou prayest be not like the Hypocrites that like to make a show now this is the Angel Lord connecting what's taking place in that little room to scripture and said enter into the secret closet and when you've done so close the door then pray to the father that seeth in secret and he that seeth in secret shall reward thee openly that's that's the that's what the scriptures want to see when thou prayest enter into your closet enter into the secret place where the Lord is and the Lord which is hidden the Lord which is unseen he will reward thee openly so there will be there will be a Vindication there will be a culmination there there will be something happened that's going to be a final separation but you've got to enter into the secret place first says you remember that name that you were hunting that time that you dreamed about and I said yes he said I'll meet you in there in this time it won't be a public Show and The Vision left me this is the scripture he's connecting to this little room this building this calls it a square and then he describes it as 12T across 20 foot long this is this is the scripture that the angel Lord is placing on that third pool which is the third part of that singular Vision enter into your closet and close your door brother Brandon when he's preaching the sermon humble I think it's humble thyself he says ow in order to do this I'm expecting something to happen in a prayer meeting is connected even to these uh the scripture right the prophecy and many of you remember the vision of the last pull that third pull you remember there was something happened just before that I seen that light com and go down to that place and said I'll meet you there now I'm looking for something to happen why because he's there something's going to happen can you explain it no but he's going to do it who raised Christ from the dead God did how did he do it by quickening power what what stood there the word prophecy we you see all these things that that fit this uh the the way that we can begin to kind of look at some of the material but yet we can't explain what God does and now brother Brandon makes this statement we've already mentioned it before but I I want you just to pick up on this and catch this as we try to turn the corner on this and finish it up he says his spoken word will be Vindicated when the son of righteousness shall rise with healing his wings he's preaching Shalom this is the end time the son of man will be revealed these things are going to take place and the healing part there will not be a physical healing as you think as saying somebody's got a sickness it'll be taken away from him he said that's what he's doing now in type yeah yeah that's what he's doing now in type so the type of Divine Healing is just pointing to this healing that's going to take place the the Divine Healing in this Vision there was a Divine Healing a woman paralyzed on a stretcher she comes out walking pushing the stretcher a man with crutches shouting Hallelujah and he's healed what was it it was Divine Healing what does Divine Healing speak of a resurrection what was that what was it a type of what that we saw on the other side the quickening power of the Resurrection what could we conclude that's in there cricketing power to snatch them from Death to life God is using the example of Divine Healing to speak of this great truth that's somebody's got a sickness that's taken away he said he's doing that now as a type but the whole creature will be changed this Mortal will take on immortality this old age will jump into youth Hallelujah I'm anxious for that time when this old age is going to jump into you oh that word that you're feeding on right now that word inside of you that new body is going to materialize around the word that's inside of you right now the world can't see it but it's happening I may not be able to explain it but it's going to happen that healing in this Vision spoke of it was Divine Healing in the vision and regardless however you want to interpret it we know that Divine Healing points to the resurrection and the sermon again what is a vision I just want to repeat this phrasing because it's where he connects these thing together he said I don't understand going into the closet like that why and he said is it not written by our Lord when thou prayest be not like the Hypocrites who like to be heard before men but enter into the secret closet and pray to the father who seeth in secret and he who seeth in secret shall reward thee openly brother brandom says it's perfectly to the scripture every time it is and I said I understand it's exactly what he said right when he was fishing I understand but he made a mess of it right those are his own words he but now this one thing he knows I've got to be faithful and when you listen to brother Brandon preaching the seventh seal and he goes through these very things again and he's saying he told me he would meet me in there and he said that will be the third pull and then he says and just the other day he said this is the third pull and brother B he's sharing this he even comes to a place where he feels like I've gone too far I've got to stop and he was so careful even that week he was so careful he even makes a comment there I was in a little room every day uh the angel met me in that little room he says and giving him the revelation of these things and brother man was so careful with his language because now he says I understand this has got to be a secret meeting yeah Matthew 6: 5-6 and when thou prayest Thou shalt not be as the Hypocrites are for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets that they may be seen of men verily I say unto you they have their reward but thou when thou prayest enter into thy closet that's a secret room it's an inner chamber says where the father and when thou shut the door pray to thy father which is in secret which is hidden thy father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly enter into a secret place it's an inner chamber his brother Bram was looking at the this great tent this Cathedral even when he he's fishing on the bank there's a lot of preachers all around him but they can't see what's happening under the water he's got understanding he's got instructions he's supposed to fish a certain way when he makes a mess of it the angel takes him higher goes into this Cathedral like place this great tent and then inside the tent which is populated by many people from the public it's going down around town he says there's a little room in there that people with prayer cards are entering into and it's it's a secret place what that it's a it's hidden from view it's not a public show and even this Greek word that's used for closet it's used of a store room where Treasures are kept it's a special private place place and there's a lot of commentary on just even how there would be special rooms um at the top of a house that would be hidden that wouldn't be accessible necessarily to the public but it would be a cooler place a little bit higher place and even God speaking in Isaiah CH 26:20 because it says but thou when thou prayest enter into thy closet and when thou H has shut the door it's got to be sealed off he says come my people enter thou into thy Chambers and shut th doors about thee hide thyself as it were for a little moment until the ignation be overpassed there's judgment that striking the West Coast there's judgment that's striking Leo DEA the word of God is coming and pronouncing judgment declaring those that are filthy that'll remain filthy there's judgment but while this wrath is coming job said oh that thou would has hide me but we're not being hidden in a grave we're being hidden in a chamber in a secret place enter into the chamber shut the door out the and hide as it were for a little moment while these things are coming to pass in Psalms 31:20 says Thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy presence from the pride of man Thou shalt keep them secretly in a pavilion from The Strife of tongues to keep them to secret it's the secret of his presence I think that would be just the best way to describe it it's the secret of his presence brother Bram said my Ministry is a little bit different my Ministry is this to declare him that he's here I'm not like all these other fishermen on the bank trying to catch a small fish I've got to catch something in particular I'm not going to fish in a way to attract all the little ones but even the way all fish will scatter a lot of people but it'll catch the rainbow trout it'll get the ones that I'm called to amen Thou shalt keep them secretly that speaks of a covering or a hiding place to hide them in his presence as he tells them in Isaiah shut to enter into thy chamber and shut the doors withdraw from leod DEA enter into a safe place not out in the open not publicly known not explainable not disclosed for in the time of trouble he shall hide me Psalms 27:5 this is his Rapture text for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me the Tabernacle the temple and even in the way that it's laid out there was a secret place a Most Holy place there was a tabernacle within a tabernacle there was a temple within a temple so in the secret place of the temple in the secret place of the Tabernacle shall you hide me he shall set me up upon a rock to call it the secret of his presence to hide be hid secretly in a Pavilion he's going to hide me in his Pavilion and the secret of his Tabernacle denotes that innermost place a privileged place a secret place that Pavilion it speaks of a booth Thou shalt set me up upon a rock musicians if you'd like to Come Thou shalt set me up it's a setup I love it set me up upon a rock there's so much more that we could express here let me just put this in here maybe I'll amplify this a little bit more at later time it's a secret place in the secret of his presence he's going to hide me in his Pavilion his little room in his his place where he is it's going to be a privileged to do this not everyone's invited there when thou prayest enter into a secret place shut the door and commune start looking at what prayer is commune with the father in secret it's not a public show it's not explainable When We Gather here as a church it's open to the public when we preach it's it's digested even by the public people stream people can come people can visit the word is preached but these are all things that are observed people can record what's being said people will they'll transcribe it they'll dissect it they'll do all sorts of things with these things that are public they do the same thing with brother braham's Ministry and the things that he said but there's a secret hidden part why do you speak to us in Parables it's just the nature of God they're not obvious on their face and on that day that Christ [Music] died he was taken down from that cross he was dead Joseph of arthea craved the body of Jesus he begs for it and takes him down and his dead body wraps him in clean linen would be wrapping him tightly preparing him for barrial he's air affirmed dead takes him into a rock going to hide him in a Clift of a rock get hide him in a place in the side of a hill he out of a rock lay a great Stone in front of it the Stone's going to be sealed but hidden from view nobody else around to be able to see it though there's guards posted out watch and there'll be a lot of people later on that'll witness the effects of it there in the darkness hidden from view Jesus Christ is raised from the dead by the quickening power of God that's the resurrection when those people went into that little room and they were changed on the other side that's Divine Healing what does it remind us of what took place behind the stone what took place in that rock brother Brandon brings us to this very place this is just kind of teaching some things here at the close just kind of putting these things together he takes psalms 27 he says Thou shalt hide them in the secret of his Tabernacle he shall set me up upon a rock a man for man shall be a hiding place a covert from The Tempest as a rock in a and thirsty land as a hiding place that's what he is brother Bram says in the sermon Shalom again this is just coming back this is another place where he's preaching this coming back to there's a man here can Turnal light this theme of Shalom thy light has come I like the way David speaks that The Rock you notice so many times God Is My Rock you know what a rock is referred to in the Bible rock is a revelation like Peter said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God he said blessed art thou Simon son of Jonas Upon This Rock This revelation God revealed it to me Flesh and Blood never revealed it to me but my Father which is in heaven Upon This Rock This Revelation I will build my church and David here crying out God is my rock my Revelation you can't give an explanation to Revelation there's got to be the inspiration and stimulation of Revelation to understand it we could point to the process we could say I was an unbeliever I was sick I was confused I was caught up in denominationalism but then we start to use a language well then an eagle screamed then The Light Came my way then I Heard a Voice then I was born again and we're just trying to use a language to explain the unexplainable but what happened the like Christ I met the man and I was changed he's my Revelation that cannot be explained there's I think there's a tendency we we want to explain things people want to explain to them i' much rather God just give the Revelation it's a secret thing it's a hidden thing what is that rock what does a rock represent Revelation what is he setting us on in this Rapture cycle a rock hidden in the Clift of a rock that's where I stand on Christ the solid rock power over death consider these things think about these things yourself this is the message of the hour and I'm not ashamed of any of it I'm not ashamed of any of it you could try to preach this message not using quotes you could try to preach the message well we're just going to stick with scripture that you know that there's those that may try that there's ways that maybe you could do it but you know what I know my audience I'm preaching a mess as Believers I'm PE preaching to people who are being set upon a rock and I want to be faithful to my calling so you be faithful as the hungry you be faithful as the as the chosen who are chosen to meet you be faithful as the ones that pray to H to have that secret meeting with this isn't this isn't it right right we didn't even close the doors tonight got all of them open well maybe not all of them but we've got but it's you personally with him communing fellowshipping and and what's happening in there is changing you and the world is witnessing it and they're asking you what happened and you find it hard sometimes to explain what's happening don't you find it hard sometimes to explain what's happening but you know it's happening it's happening it's happening in you you know it you can't explain it it's different why it's him he's the one that's doing this oh I say lean into it with all that you have hide yourself in him and he's just and faithful to finish it stand together with me tonight
