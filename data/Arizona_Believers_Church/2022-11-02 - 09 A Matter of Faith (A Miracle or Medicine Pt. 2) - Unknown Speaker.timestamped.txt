[0:00] subject is a matter of Faith this has
[0:02] been running in continuity and parallel
[0:04] to the services on Christ my healer
[0:06] tonight is the second part of this
[0:09] question a miracle or medicine kind of
[0:11] asking the question uh was if somebody
[0:13] recovers and made well was it a miracle
[0:16] do we wait for a miracle or was it
[0:18] medicine and maybe one way we could say
[0:21] that we prefaced this last time is what
[0:23] does faith look like in healing we can
[0:26] have different positions on how to
[0:28] approach an illness where some say it's
[0:31] only a miracle if you abstain from any
[0:33] intervention at all others may just
[0:35] leave God completely out of it and
[0:37] pursue after whatever science may offer
[0:40] them to be to be healed but I believe
[0:42] those of us who are sincere we find
[0:44] ourselves in a situation where we're
[0:46] longing to be made well especially for
[0:47] facing chronic sickness we say we ask
[0:51] ourselves if I'm sick does faith does
[0:54] faith do nothing at all but believe the
[0:56] promise or does it try everything that's
[0:58] available I'll try this room somebody
[1:00] I'll try that remedy I'll try this I'll
[1:01] try that what does faith look like and
[1:04] as we mentioned before there's some that
[1:06] are professing Christians that believe
[1:08] that God forbids The Believer from ever
[1:11] going to the doctor and from ever taking
[1:13] medicine and they're very strong in that
[1:15] and equate it too and I could show the I
[1:19] could play the sermons for you show you
[1:20] the writings to where they actually
[1:21] equate going to the doctor to committing
[1:24] actual adultery against your spouse they
[1:27] believe it to be that tremendous of an
[1:28] error but we looked into the Bible last
[1:31] time we saw how in Proverbs chapter 17
[1:33] verse 22 it says a merry heart doeth
[1:36] good like a medicine but a broken Spirit
[1:38] dryeth the bones a merry heart does good
[1:42] so a positive attitude this fits well
[1:44] with some of the things we've been
[1:45] ministering on the right mental attitude
[1:47] towards the promises of God and and your
[1:49] mood and your atmosphere and those
[1:51] things it says it does good like a
[1:53] medicine so in other words the Bible is
[1:55] saying that medicine does good
[1:57] right and that's something that we could
[1:58] see just very obviously that the
[2:00] medicine does good medicine means a cure
[2:02] or healing and we looked at a number of
[2:05] places in saw where there's a reference
[2:06] to something used to heal or to anoint
[2:10] and something used in remedy and a
[2:12] sickness or wound that despite multiple
[2:15] references to things that could be used
[2:17] to help the body and to Aid it and heal
[2:19] him there's no condemnation or warning
[2:21] against medicine in the Bible
[2:24] now there's been I was wanting to go
[2:26] down this line of teaching how that
[2:30] there's things in the Bible that warn
[2:32] against
[2:34] um against pills and potions and
[2:36] Witchcraft and sorcery so it's not just
[2:39] all you know seeking whatever can give
[2:41] help me you know I'm just going to
[2:43] pursue it if that means I've got to kill
[2:44] a rabbit and boil its toenails and uh
[2:47] and and sleep with goat fur under my
[2:49] pillow with some incantation no there's
[2:52] there's a line that you can cross where
[2:53] you're just going straight into some
[2:55] sort of other religion that denies the
[2:57] existence of God
[2:58] and but I want to instead of maybe and I
[3:01] just see how the Lord pulled me away
[3:02] from that and because there's just
[3:04] always will be opportunity maybe to deal
[3:05] with that side but there's this balance
[3:07] in this scripture where it brings up
[3:09] medicine something prudent something
[3:11] reasonable that it's not just saying it
[3:14] doesn't cast a suspicion on things that
[3:17] can Aid the body and healing and in
[3:19] second Kings chapter 20 verse 7 as we
[3:22] read it here's Hezekiah who's sick unto
[3:24] death
[3:25] and he is uh he's desperate to be healed
[3:30] and the Bible says that the word of the
[3:32] Lord came to him and it says I've heard
[3:34] thy prayers he says I will heal thee and
[3:37] then on the third day go up to the house
[3:39] the Lord so God says I'm going to heal
[3:40] you and when the word of Lord comes to
[3:43] Isaiah for his healing and he's going to
[3:45] speak to him words of healing
[3:48] Isaiah doesn't just say thus saith the
[3:51] Lord you're healed what he does is he
[3:52] takes a lump of figs which would be some
[3:55] sort of paste they even say maybe a cake
[3:57] a fig something put together and he puts
[3:59] it upon the boil lays took it laid it
[4:01] upon the boil and it says by that he
[4:04] recovered in other words he was healed
[4:07] so we could present the scripture that
[4:09] says I will heal thee in verse 5 the
[4:11] Lord says I will heal thee but then we
[4:13] have somebody who administers some sort
[4:14] of Salve or balm or ointment or medicine
[4:17] and it says he recovered and so maybe
[4:19] the debate was well was it God that
[4:21] healed him or was it medicine
[4:23] right was it was it a miracle or was it
[4:25] medicine was it the figs or was it God
[4:28] and I believe that there's a way that we
[4:30] could position that where it's all it
[4:32] either has to be God or has to be the
[4:34] figs I said we would be wrong to do that
[4:35] because God chose the figs to be an aide
[4:38] or to do to have some part he blessed
[4:41] those things to have some part in the
[4:43] deliverance and the healing of Isaiah
[4:45] and so this is where we stand all
[4:47] healing is Divine Healing that's where
[4:50] we stand as Believers all healing is
[4:51] Divine Healing and say well I know an
[4:53] atheist who didn't even believe in God
[4:55] who was healed well all healing is
[4:57] Divine Healing it's interesting
[4:59] sometimes that if it doesn't happen
[5:01] under a message roof with message
[5:03] Believers we get skeptical and we get
[5:05] cynical and we want to disbelieve be
[5:07] careful you're just disbelieving the
[5:09] power of your God
[5:11] because it's our God that heals it's our
[5:14] God that saves it's our God who has
[5:16] power and so if God heals a hole in
[5:18] someone's heart and they're not a
[5:20] message believer It could only be God it
[5:22] does that
[5:23] somebody has cancer and and they recover
[5:25] and whether they receive treatment or
[5:28] what and someone has made well and they
[5:29] say oh you won't believe it I'm in
[5:31] remission there's not a sign of Cancer
[5:32] don't be afraid to say praise God
[5:34] right because it's our God that heals
[5:36] brother Graham says God Alone stands in
[5:39] healing
[5:40] so what are the things we're wanting to
[5:42] expose is how the devil tries to cause
[5:44] fear in our hearts when it comes to
[5:46] certain things in order to keep us bound
[5:49] and I believe a Believer does not need
[5:51] to fear sickness whatsoever
[5:54] doesn't need to fear sickness the
[5:55] sickness itself or the future that may
[5:57] be because of sickness and we certainly
[5:59] do not need to have fear when Desiring
[6:01] to treat a wound or Desiring to treat a
[6:03] sickness and we can do so and trust in
[6:05] God
[6:06] and let me say this way as a Believer
[6:08] we're not manifesting doubt by taking
[6:12] um Ibuprofen when we have a headache
[6:14] maybe if I can say it another way we're
[6:16] not manifesting doubt when we take
[6:17] peppermint oil and rub it on our temples
[6:20] when we have a headache right that's not
[6:22] the manifestation of doubt what's
[6:23] interesting though is some people think
[6:25] the peppermint oil is okay but ibuprofen
[6:27] is wrong
[6:28] right it's weird how we start to build
[6:30] these camps but just look at we
[6:32] shouldn't have that this seed sown into
[6:34] our Spirits where as soon as you do that
[6:37] and think about the slippery slope in
[6:38] this I think I'm just getting all
[6:40] excited and I need to calm down
[6:42] I need some lavender
[6:49] if we have that in our minds at all from
[6:52] as a starting point I just want to
[6:53] believe God I just want to believe God
[6:55] if I do anything to help this
[6:57] um that you know that's going to be a
[6:59] sin or that's unbelief and then you get
[7:01] so desperate you try something
[7:04] guess what you've just done to your
[7:05] faith your conscience is going to
[7:07] condemn you because you're going to say
[7:09] well when I had faith I was doing
[7:10] nothing and now that I'm doing this it's
[7:12] almost as if you've taken this you've
[7:14] gone the wrong direction
[7:16] but only because of your prior belief
[7:18] system
[7:19] so sometimes what we need to do is come
[7:21] back to base and say Lord I'm sorry that
[7:23] I was building all these parameters and
[7:25] I thought that healing could only come
[7:27] one particular way and I was a little
[7:28] bit imbalanced in my Approach and you
[7:30] repent upon those grounds then you don't
[7:32] have the devil who's trying to erode
[7:34] your faith in confidence when you're
[7:36] making a lump of figs available right
[7:38] upon a boil to for God to be able to
[7:41] heal you
[7:42] and I know there's been a lot said on
[7:43] these things
[7:45] and um and so there's a lot that I hope
[7:48] that you're able to remember that we've
[7:49] touched on in this now in second
[7:51] Chronicles chapter 16 verse 12
[7:55] he says this is a scripture that is used
[7:58] very predominantly by those who believe
[8:00] it's a sin to go to the doctor sin to
[8:02] take medicine we focused a lot on the
[8:04] medicine last time we're wanting to take
[8:06] a step further in this in a different
[8:08] direction it says or along the same
[8:09] lines but a different emphasis it says
[8:11] an ace on the 30 30 and 9th year of his
[8:13] Reign was diseased in his feet until his
[8:16] disease was exceeding great but the
[8:18] Scott I found that article or a journal
[8:20] where they are writing about what they
[8:22] thought this disease was and and and the
[8:25] different uh connections that they make
[8:28] even to Modern ailments it says yet in
[8:30] his disease he sought not the Lord but
[8:32] sought we could say sought the
[8:35] Physicians
[8:36] now we could read this and we could kind
[8:38] of create a complex about going to the
[8:40] doctor
[8:41] you say well ASL had a disease and it
[8:44] was great a disease in his feet this
[8:46] disease was great and and he went to the
[8:49] Physicians and didn't seek the Lord but
[8:51] his Heir was not going to the Physicians
[8:53] his air is the first thing that's
[8:55] mentioned he sought not the Lord so what
[8:58] we can gather from that is he went to
[8:59] Physicians and didn't go to God
[9:01] whatsoever
[9:02] it's expressed in such a way to where he
[9:04] abandoned what he ought to have done or
[9:06] what he knew was right there's some sort
[9:08] of subjection of his uh his efforts to
[9:10] the god who's a Divine PRI has Divine
[9:13] Providence over all of it if he could
[9:15] bring the contrast to Hezekiah when he
[9:17] got sick what did he immediately do
[9:19] he went to the Lord and said Lord I need
[9:20] your help I need your grace and God
[9:22] could have said go to the Physicians
[9:24] right
[9:25] in King Asos situation he said oh God I
[9:28] need you to intervene I've got this
[9:30] disease in my feet I've got this uh
[9:31] pulmonary problem I got the circulation
[9:33] Problem whatever it might be Lord I need
[9:35] your help and God said go to the
[9:37] Physicians
[9:39] and so we do not want to build up this
[9:43] mistrust this unhealthy fear in our
[9:45] hearts because here it says that King
[9:47] Aesop sought not the Lord that means to
[9:49] seek with care he didn't inquire means
[9:52] to practice to study to follow to seek
[9:54] with application to demand in other
[9:56] words God was not sought or considered
[9:58] at all
[9:59] right he didn't ask anything of God
[10:01] he didn't seek God about his illness he
[10:03] didn't pray about his illness so Faith
[10:05] was not the king Asos Approach at all
[10:08] and so if I could say it this way and if
[10:10] you just say well that's just brother
[10:11] Aaron John this conclusion that's fine
[10:14] Esau was not wrong go to the doctor
[10:17] or he would not have been wrong to go to
[10:19] the doctor but he was wrong to not
[10:21] include faith in whatever it was he did
[10:23] notice how brother Branham touches on
[10:25] this in the sermon conference with God
[10:27] your first Duty when you get sick of
[10:29] course
[10:30] you go to the doctor you go to your
[10:32] doctor this is Brother Brown I'm saying
[10:33] this this isn't me your first Duty when
[10:35] you get sick of course you go to your
[10:37] doc your doctor
[10:38] he does all he can do if he can't do no
[10:41] more you have a right to go to the great
[10:42] specialist then now we're not against
[10:44] doctors
[10:46] you realize how he places this that when
[10:49] you're sick your first duty is you go to
[10:51] your doctor and if he can't help you
[10:53] then you then you can go to the
[10:54] specialist this might seem contrary to
[10:58] the way we build it up in our minds of
[10:59] what faith looks like
[11:01] but it's not it's not a lack of faith to
[11:05] go to the doctor
[11:06] and so that's where I'm trying to
[11:07] address this is we say oh well it's not
[11:08] Faith to go to the doctor if I can put
[11:11] it this way you're still giving God a
[11:13] chance to heal you when you go to the
[11:14] doctor
[11:16] it's still part of it but part of what
[11:17] you're seeking and the sermon Jehovah
[11:19] Jireh but a man says surely you have
[11:21] feeling for your people and for the
[11:22] people that's God's people and people
[11:24] who want to be healed remember when you
[11:27] are sick your first duty is to see your
[11:29] doctor and see what he says and then if
[11:31] he diagnoses the case of something that
[11:33] he cannot science science has not been
[11:35] able to reveal to him any help for you
[11:37] then you have a right to come to God he
[11:40] is the great physician
[11:41] this is beautiful balance because I
[11:43] think we have it the opposite right when
[11:44] we get sick we want to give God a chance
[11:46] we want to try nothing at all and and
[11:48] that's I'm not saying that that
[11:50] attitude's wrong but this this approach
[11:52] is not wrong
[11:53] right to say well I'm not feeling well I
[11:55] need to I want to call my doctor I want
[11:56] to make an appointment I'm doing this in
[11:58] faith believing that God uses doctors
[12:00] God can use this doctor to tell me what
[12:02] exactly this is and what I can do to
[12:04] keep myself healthy and my family
[12:05] healthy he says when you're sick your
[12:07] first duty is to see your doctor and see
[12:09] what he says
[12:10] why because all healing is Divine
[12:12] Healing the sermon Faith once delivered
[12:14] to the Saints but the rest says all
[12:16] healing is Divine Healing doctors have
[12:18] AIDS God's the Healer doctor sets the
[12:20] bones God does the healing doctor gives
[12:23] medicine to kill the rats in you
[12:26] and God patches up the holes that the
[12:28] rat's eaten
[12:29] and he's drawing on an example he says
[12:31] if you have if you have rats in your
[12:33] home and it's chewing through things and
[12:35] chewing through things and you use a
[12:36] poison to kill the rats but then
[12:37] something has to come along and sow up
[12:39] all the places where their attitude the
[12:40] holes he said so medicine can provide
[12:43] something to kill an infection to kill a
[12:45] uh it can provide something to deal with
[12:47] that bacterial infection to remedy the
[12:49] disease to set a bone to remove
[12:51] something but then the very things that
[12:52] God has placed inside the body he says
[12:55] God patches up the holes he says only
[12:57] one healing Divine Healing
[13:02] I continued on the long of these uh
[13:05] you know the brother random saying when
[13:06] you're sick your first duty is to go to
[13:08] your doctor in Matthew chapter 9 verse
[13:10] 12.
[13:11] it says but when Jesus heard that he
[13:13] said unto them they that behold need not
[13:15] a physician but they that are sick
[13:18] it's repeated in in the Book of Luke and
[13:20] again also in Mark it's one of those
[13:21] places where you see this Symmetry and
[13:24] the repetition it's always the same they
[13:26] that are whole need not a physician but
[13:27] they that are sick they that a whole
[13:29] have no need of the physician but they
[13:31] that are sick what is Jesus saying if
[13:33] you're sick you need a physician
[13:35] given a perfect opportunity to say if
[13:37] you're sick avoid doctors right here's
[13:40] here was his chance to sow into us a
[13:42] healthy suspicion of doctors here was
[13:44] his chance to caution us against uh
[13:47] pursuing you know any kind of outside
[13:49] help or means in wanting to be made well
[13:51] but he says it he just says it as a
[13:53] matter of fact the sick are the ones
[13:54] that need a physician
[13:56] physician it comes from the word to mean
[13:58] to make whole to cure or to heal
[14:01] so they that are lacking they that have
[14:03] a breach they have a wound they that are
[14:05] not well they they need a physician to
[14:07] help them
[14:09] and this is Christ given an opportunity
[14:11] maybe to say something negative about
[14:13] doctors and he doesn't do so then in
[14:16] Mark chapter 5 verses 25 to 28 and this
[14:18] is just prior
[14:20] this is uh this is actually I apologize
[14:23] it's not prior to it's in chapter two
[14:25] where he mentions uh they that are sick
[14:27] need a physician he says and a certain
[14:28] woman which had an issue of blood 12
[14:30] years and had suffered many things of
[14:33] many Physicians maybe some of us could
[14:36] put ourselves In Her Shoes suffered many
[14:38] things of many physicians in Luke
[14:40] chapter 8 verse 43 it says which had
[14:41] spent all her living upon Physicians
[14:45] now that means she did everything she
[14:46] could
[14:47] she spent her money she spent a living
[14:49] she'd suffered many things of many
[14:50] Physicians she had gone and seen them
[14:52] and she'd been treated by them and then
[14:54] those days certainly the things that
[14:56] they were available and at their
[14:57] disposal are much different than now but
[14:59] when she had heard of Jesus came into
[15:01] the press behind and touched His Garment
[15:03] for she said if I may touch but his
[15:05] clothes I shall be whole
[15:07] you can hear still here's a situation I
[15:10] just I raised this just to see how the
[15:12] Bible again is referring to physicians
[15:15] in the days of Christ who would treat
[15:16] somebody who is not well treat somebody
[15:18] who is sick treat things and maybe they
[15:20] try and try and try and there's nothing
[15:22] wrong with that effort but in her faith
[15:24] in seeking Christ that's where she found
[15:25] her healing
[15:27] we know in the Bible that Luke is was a
[15:30] physician Paul says in Colossians
[15:32] chapter 4 verse 14 Luke the Beloved
[15:34] Physician
[15:36] the Beloved Physician right I don't
[15:38] think it ever says that about lawyers
[15:41] but it says it about doctors the Beloved
[15:44] doctor the Beloved Physician and he's
[15:46] the one that writes the book of Luke
[15:47] he's the one that's accredited with
[15:49] writing uh the book of Acts here's one
[15:51] that was a physician and again I know
[15:53] this seems maybe very Elementary or
[15:55] maybe there's some sort of uh deduction
[15:57] that I'm taking from it but it's not
[15:59] putting doctors and Physicians and those
[16:01] who would be there to help somebody who
[16:03] is sick it does not put them in a
[16:06] negative light
[16:08] brother Branham in the sermon God
[16:09] testifying of his gifts he says if your
[16:11] arms broke it's your duty to go to the
[16:13] doctor
[16:14] and let him set that arm then ask God to
[16:17] heal it that's right
[16:19] he says but now wait what if that cancer
[16:21] he can't cut it out what if the roots
[16:23] are scattered out like this then there's
[16:25] only one thing left that's God that
[16:27] that's God the Almighty
[16:30] notice first duty if he broken bone go
[16:32] to the doctor
[16:33] notice kind of how we have our hierarchy
[16:35] right if we broke a bone we might think
[16:37] oh go to the doctor he needs to set it
[16:39] but then something else you're like oh
[16:41] whatever you do just believe God for
[16:42] your healing and we create this this uh
[16:45] division right I hope you understand
[16:48] where my heart is at is just wanting to
[16:50] kind of take a step back and look at
[16:52] this we create a division where in one
[16:54] situation we don't even think twice
[16:56] but another situation we begin to kind
[16:58] of put our faith in this compromised
[17:00] position that we couldn't go seek a
[17:02] physician to be well
[17:03] we couldn't take medicine to help with
[17:06] our sickness and the sermon God's
[17:07] provided way again these are all
[17:09] different statements in the message of
[17:10] the hour he says God has a provided way
[17:12] if the doctor sure it's your duty to go
[17:16] to your doctor it's your duty to do
[17:18] whatever you can for yourself
[17:20] but look brother when you get to get to
[17:23] a place where the doctor can't help you
[17:25] you've got a right to call on God that's
[17:27] exactly right and you believe it
[17:30] again what I love about this is brother
[17:32] bradman's brother Branham is giving this
[17:34] as our prophet
[17:36] is telling this to us for our prophet
[17:38] that it is okay right it is okay to go
[17:41] to the doctor he's actually saying it's
[17:42] your duty therefore if you're going to
[17:44] seek means to address an issue in your
[17:47] life or to deal with some sort of
[17:48] circumstance or situation and whatever
[17:50] Channel it would be that you would seek
[17:52] help just to help you you don't ever
[17:54] leave your faith at home in doing that
[17:56] you don't leave your discernment behind
[17:58] you don't leave your faith behind you
[18:00] don't create this division where it's
[18:01] like well I'm just going to go ahead and
[18:02] give medicine a chance and then if that
[18:04] doesn't work I'm going to give God a
[18:05] chance no you're giving God a chance
[18:07] through the medicine you're giving God a
[18:09] chance through the doctor because God
[18:10] uses the doctor
[18:13] I think it's such a tremendous balance
[18:16] brother when he's preaching the
[18:18] revelation of Jesus Christ it's in 1960
[18:20] when he's preaching the church ages in
[18:23] the Ephesian Church age he says let me
[18:24] tell you something as I was speaking the
[18:26] other day upon the doctor's prescription
[18:28] people don't like to take the doctor's
[18:30] prescription
[18:31] if he's got a remedy that'll cure your
[18:33] sickness and you refuse to take it it
[18:35] ain't the doctor's fault that you died
[18:38] no sir it's your fault because you
[18:40] refuse to take it
[18:42] again it's really simple that God could
[18:45] actually use a doctor
[18:47] to give you a prescription that'll cure
[18:49] your sickness and it's your fault if you
[18:51] don't take it
[18:52] he's not putting on signs he's not
[18:54] putting on the doctor he's putting on
[18:55] the earth your fault if you refuse to
[18:57] take the medicine that God prescribes
[19:02] I know we're covering just things over
[19:04] and over and over again
[19:07] and I hope it's that repetition is okay
[19:10] but I have and it looks like it's going
[19:12] to be maybe a really short service
[19:13] tonight
[19:15] I think that'll probably be okay I don't
[19:16] know if I have any objections to that
[19:17] either but I have three lengthy
[19:19] statements I want to read I don't
[19:20] believe I provided slides for these
[19:22] because they're just so long and I
[19:24] wanted maybe I didn't want to get lost
[19:26] in the slides
[19:28] but if you could just hold tight here we
[19:30] just have these three statements to read
[19:32] and and just let the Lord kind of lead
[19:34] us to whichever direction he'd want us
[19:36] to go
[19:36] but again take everything that we've
[19:39] talked about to this point and think
[19:40] about how the word is trying to open our
[19:42] eyes up
[19:43] to have faith in God and not be
[19:46] unreasonably suspicious
[19:49] of things that can help
[19:51] because if you
[19:53] if you are if it's fear that's driving
[19:56] you you could convince yourself that
[19:58] it's actually faith that's creating this
[20:00] desire to abstain from something or
[20:02] faith that's causing you to be really
[20:04] bull doggish about something when it's
[20:06] actually fear
[20:07] something that God uh we may have
[20:10] dramatized before where God has provided
[20:11] away could you imagine if Isaiah came
[20:14] and said hey I've got a lump of figs I
[20:15] want to lay it on the boil and I want
[20:16] you to be well and Hezekiah said no I'm
[20:18] trusting God for my healing
[20:20] no I'm believing God he God Will Make A
[20:22] Way and God's saying this is the way
[20:24] this is the way this is this is the way
[20:26] to be made whole this is the way to get
[20:27] those years that you prayed for to get
[20:29] them back and so we don't want to be
[20:31] running on our own human inspiration we
[20:33] don't want to be running in fear we want
[20:34] to be balanced
[20:35] now now the
[20:38] um maybe the preface for this can be
[20:39] this that there's so many voices there's
[20:41] so many attitudes there's so many sides
[20:43] that are out there today that it's
[20:45] really easy for a voice just to kind of
[20:47] get going around in our head and then we
[20:48] get suspicious about things or or
[20:51] there's ways that may be uh and for even
[20:55] from the other side a voice gets in our
[20:56] head and then we get suspicious about
[20:57] other things we've got to be very very
[20:59] careful that we don't find ourselves in
[21:00] some camp
[21:01] uh to where we're divided along these
[21:04] different lines or God gives us certain
[21:05] latitudes
[21:06] and the sermon Jesus Christ the same
[21:08] yesterday today and forever this is
[21:10] lengthy but I felt really impressed to
[21:11] read it to you so you could hear how
[21:13] brother Branham approached this
[21:14] particular subject he says now we are
[21:17] here to try to put in our little
[21:18] Ministry with your ministry together to
[21:21] bring glory to God
[21:22] the Lord has called me years ago to pray
[21:25] for his sick children and I do that
[21:27] reverently try to do
[21:30] and I do not claim to be a Healer
[21:33] now if anyone can hear that I am not a
[21:36] Healer I don't claim to heal people
[21:39] I frankly don't believe there's anyone
[21:41] can heal people because that's God's job
[21:44] and he's already did that
[21:46] by his stripes where you're healed when
[21:48] his son at Calvary was wounded for our
[21:50] transgressions and with his stripes we
[21:52] are healed a past tense
[21:54] and I think you might
[21:56] um well here he says in so many times
[21:58] people speak of Divine Healing
[22:00] there's no healing but Divine Healing
[22:03] that's the only healing there is no
[22:05] other healing but Divine Healing never
[22:07] did medicine ever cure any case never
[22:10] did an operation ever cure operation is
[22:13] an aid and medicine is an aid which we
[22:16] think they are fine
[22:18] we thank God for every Aid that we have
[22:20] but God's the Healer notice how here's
[22:23] here's a prophet that wants to pray for
[22:24] people and has a desire to see sick
[22:26] people healed and there may be a number
[22:28] of people that he's going to pray for
[22:29] who've gone to the doctor who tried to
[22:31] get help and he doesn't say anything
[22:33] that would create a further wound in
[22:35] their Spirit right say oh you
[22:37] unbelieving group that ran off to all
[22:39] these doctors you should be ashamed of
[22:40] yourselves you need to start repenting
[22:41] he's he's using this in a way that's uh
[22:45] that is support in support of the truth
[22:48] that God uses all sorts of means
[22:51] that you could use a medicine but it's
[22:53] not the medicine that cured it's the
[22:54] medicine that was used for one part but
[22:57] God does the other part he says we thank
[22:58] God for every Aid we have but God's the
[23:00] Healer Psalms 103 and 3 said I am the
[23:03] Lord that heals all thy diseases so we
[23:06] know we have to agree with the word if
[23:08] the words out in one place then it's out
[23:11] everywhere
[23:12] it's perfectly in harmony all the way
[23:15] through
[23:16] I just believed the word that's God's
[23:18] program
[23:19] I do not want anything more than the
[23:22] Bible teaches but I want all that it
[23:24] does teach I want it all so if it's
[23:27] God's word it must come
[23:30] now I know that God can do things that's
[23:32] not written in his word he's God he
[23:34] could do anything he desires to do but
[23:36] as long as I know it's coming out of the
[23:38] word it gives me good assurance that
[23:40] everything's all right I like that real
[23:42] well
[23:43] so now we're asking the Lord tonight to
[23:45] bless us and now just one more word for
[23:49] it on Divine Healing
[23:53] now I never come to take the place of
[23:55] your doctor
[23:57] no I come to do this I come to pray for
[24:00] God's child the doctor's patient my
[24:02] brother and sister that's what I come
[24:04] for
[24:04] you'll recognize this phrase here
[24:07] recently now in this you see so much
[24:09] when you speak of bodily healing that
[24:11] there's the motives and objectives of
[24:13] people seem to be so confused and wrong
[24:15] many times so program kind of sets it up
[24:18] that he's here I'm here to pray for the
[24:19] sick people when people speak of Divine
[24:22] Healing there's only uh one kind of
[24:24] Divine Healing there's no only one kind
[24:26] of healing it's Divine Healing whether
[24:28] it be medicine operation an aid doctors
[24:32] whatever it is God's the one that heals
[24:33] and he says because I can see that in
[24:35] the word of God whatever I'm doing I
[24:36] want to come to the word of God and he
[24:39] kind of takes a step back he says but
[24:40] when you talk about healing of the body
[24:42] there's so many motives
[24:44] so many objectives and it's the motive
[24:46] and objectives of people that cause
[24:48] people to become confused now the
[24:51] beautiful part of this as I looked at it
[24:53] is here's brother Branham who recognizes
[24:55] how people with the wrong motives and
[24:57] the wrong objectives have confused the
[24:59] people so he's demonstrating that his
[25:01] motive is right
[25:03] he demonstrates it very clearly he wants
[25:05] God to have the glory his objective to
[25:07] see one healed he's he's wanting them to
[25:10] be assured that he's not coming as a
[25:11] rival he's not coming as an adversary
[25:13] he's coming with an interest in God's
[25:15] people he's coming with an interest to
[25:17] see that sick people are healed and he
[25:19] actually calls them the doctor's patient
[25:22] right there's there's not creating any
[25:25] kind of rivalry not creating any kind of
[25:27] uh friction he's not saying I'm coming
[25:29] to undo what all the doctors have done
[25:31] I'm coming to do what doctors couldn't
[25:32] do uh what he could say is he did even
[25:34] in India I'm coming to do what your
[25:36] witch doctors couldn't do I'm coming to
[25:38] do what your false religions couldn't do
[25:39] I'm coming to do that what only God
[25:41] could do
[25:43] now here this is where it gets um
[25:46] I think extremely relevant for us and if
[25:48] this if if is Not Practical for you
[25:52] you'll see where this wisdom is
[25:54] practical to help others or in
[25:55] situations you might be confronted with
[25:57] he says now you go to a medical doctor
[25:59] and he'll say don't you ever don't you
[26:01] go over to that surgeon he's nothing but
[26:03] a butcher he'll just cut you to pieces
[26:05] he's a sawbone
[26:08] all right okay so you just have like the
[26:10] family practitioner or maybe the more
[26:12] holistic doctor or whatever it might be
[26:14] he's like we just kind of want to look
[26:15] at the whole person and we just want to
[26:17] think about what we can do and we got a
[26:18] lot of copper we can get you to wear and
[26:20] a lot of things we could do to help you
[26:22] to make you better but whatever you do
[26:24] don't go to that surgeon because they're
[26:25] just going to cut you open and they're
[26:27] going to do this and do that and he's
[26:29] talking about how that works like here's
[26:31] someone who can actually help you but
[26:33] they start creating a rivalry against
[26:35] other thought processes against other
[26:37] people what is it we all hate when you
[26:39] go to buy a car and the first thing they
[26:40] say is you didn't go to the dealership
[26:42] down the street those people are lousy
[26:44] I see you're driving a Ford here the
[26:46] Chevy dealership uh we want to get you
[26:48] out of that Ford because they're
[26:49] horrible right you realize 90 of all
[26:52] Fords are still on the road
[26:54] yeah because the rest of them actually
[26:55] made it home right and they just start
[26:57] telling you a bunch of things about car
[26:59] you're running the other guy down like
[27:00] yeah I would never go there they're
[27:01] horrible they're bad for me personally
[27:03] I'm like I don't want to do business
[27:05] with you
[27:06] because the only way you try to make
[27:07] yourself look good is by running
[27:09] everybody else down right off the bat
[27:10] has anybody experienced that I don't
[27:13] like it when someone's trying to
[27:14] convince me by how good they are by
[27:16] telling me everyone else is bad it
[27:18] leaves a real bad taste in my mouth and
[27:20] brother Branham is identifying the
[27:22] nature of some people with the wrong
[27:24] motive and run objective instead of just
[27:26] saying hey I believe I can help you he
[27:28] said whatever you don't go to that
[27:29] surgeon over there he's just a saw bone
[27:32] and then the surgeon will say back to
[27:34] the medical doctor you don't need sugar
[27:36] pills you need an operation
[27:38] right oh they're giving you just a bunch
[27:39] of sugar pills that's never going to
[27:40] help you need to get operated on well
[27:42] then both of them they'll say don't you
[27:45] have nothing to do with that
[27:46] chiropractor
[27:48] it's nothing but just psychic your mind
[27:52] I'd say I guess these issues were around
[27:54] then
[27:55] and the chiropractor will say to the
[27:57] osteopathic your bones need adjusting
[27:59] not your muscles rubbed
[28:03] and they're all against the preacher
[28:06] so now there you are
[28:08] but what I think that the motives and
[28:10] objectives are not right
[28:11] guess how each one has their theology
[28:13] their belief system the only way you can
[28:15] get help just through this and if you
[28:17] just get the if you just line up your
[28:19] spine the warts on your toes will go
[28:21] away and if you just if you just get
[28:22] your cervical if you just get this fixed
[28:25] and it'll cause do this and they believe
[28:26] that they're Paradigm the way they look
[28:28] at that's the remedy for everything
[28:29] right
[28:31] and and they create these rivalries and
[28:33] these factions these different way of
[28:34] looking at it and they says that's what
[28:36] people have in their mind come on we
[28:37] should I should be getting a lot of
[28:38] amens right you should carry me out on
[28:41] your shoulders tonight for reading what
[28:42] Brethren Bradham said because you're
[28:44] like yeah this is this is real life
[28:46] 2022. this is maybe it's different words
[28:48] these days but this is exactly the
[28:50] atmosphere we live in anymore
[28:54] he says I think the motives and
[28:55] objectives are not right
[28:57] it's a money-making thing
[28:59] it says if everything is right now this
[29:02] is to zero in on this if every man is
[29:04] right and a man has got his right motive
[29:06] and his right objective to it I think
[29:08] this that each of us and all know that
[29:11] operations do good medicine does good
[29:14] Bible said so
[29:16] he says the Bible said so
[29:19] and you know a chiropractic and
[29:21] osteopathic many times helps people
[29:23] we know that that's a good Aid a help
[29:27] I've had to humble myself to the message
[29:28] of the hour with the way I think I told
[29:30] you before I'm a data guy right I want
[29:32] data I want to verify verify verified
[29:34] document document document these things
[29:35] have to make sense empirically you know
[29:38] they'd be backed up there needs to be
[29:39] peer-reviewed studies done right this is
[29:42] the way I look at medicine this is the
[29:43] way I look at things in the natural
[29:44] these are things that I want I want to
[29:46] be documented and verified and you hear
[29:48] you hear about this you hear about that
[29:50] you're like
[29:51] that makes no sense at all
[29:52] how is throwing dry pasta up against the
[29:55] South Wall going to do anything for a
[29:58] crick in your neck
[30:00] and well it worked
[30:02] I'm like all right I'm not going to
[30:03] argue with it it worked great and
[30:05] brother I'm saying that these things
[30:07] they can that's a good help and Aid so
[30:10] what we should do would each one of us
[30:12] join hands and heart together and March
[30:15] forward to do everything we can for our
[30:17] people to make life a little more
[30:18] pleasant this journey that we're in
[30:20] anyhow to help one another
[30:23] to do all that we can to benefit and to
[30:25] make life more pleasant for each person
[30:27] that's traveling this journey
[30:30] is to this end that I'm here
[30:32] to try to do that to join hands with
[30:35] your doctor with your chiropractor with
[30:37] your surgeon with your pastor with your
[30:39] neighbor and all to try to make life
[30:41] just a little better
[30:44] not a beautiful attitude now brother
[30:46] Branham identified how so many times
[30:48] there's these motives and objectives and
[30:49] maybe he knew he was facing an audience
[30:51] in 1958 that had been told a lot of
[30:53] things about these Divine healers and
[30:55] these Faith healers and these people who
[30:56] believe that God can heal you and it's
[30:58] nothing but this and it's worse than a
[31:00] sugar pill and it's this and it's that
[31:01] and he realized that there's people
[31:03] sitting there who've had their minds
[31:04] filled with a lot of things and instead
[31:06] of brother Branham lashing out he
[31:08] demonstrates the right motive and
[31:10] objective the right kind of attitude to
[31:12] put someone in the right frame of mind
[31:13] to be healed and even to receive prayer
[31:15] for the sick
[31:17] that that someone's gonna lay hands on
[31:19] them and pray him he hasn't created a
[31:20] rivalry with their surgeon he hasn't
[31:22] joined ranks with the chiropractors and
[31:24] running down the general practitioners
[31:25] he's actually speaking in a way that
[31:28] clarifies that the right motive and
[31:30] objective would be God you use whatever
[31:33] it is you can to help in this situation
[31:37] to make life just a little bit better I
[31:39] think I have it in here somewhere but
[31:40] whether Ram says we just have about a
[31:41] short time on this Earth anyways
[31:45] in the sermon taking sides with Jesus
[31:47] again this is a lengthy statement
[31:49] I appreciate it so much just your your
[31:51] uh your good attitudes tonight and in
[31:55] expectation and the sermon taking sides
[31:57] with Jesus he says here not long ago a
[31:59] certain sister that goes to this church
[32:00] was at another church
[32:02] where God was making everything happen
[32:07] all right he's got my attention
[32:09] and this sister said to the other sister
[32:11] you know that man that could pray for
[32:13] the sick must have a very Victorious
[32:15] Life he said he he must just be able his
[32:18] family and everything be healed at a
[32:20] spoken word like that
[32:22] and the other lady happened to be from
[32:24] Jeffersonville
[32:26] and I'm sure that nobody has to know but
[32:28] what Jesus said among your own people
[32:29] you know your country that's right it
[32:32] may be that right now coming close it
[32:34] may be a change of time you see
[32:36] and he said you know what so if we could
[32:38] just try to draw from what brother
[32:40] Bradham said
[32:41] there's a certain sister that goes to
[32:43] this church was at another church where
[32:44] God was doing things God was moving and
[32:46] the comment was wow that one that prays
[32:48] for the sick he must be able just to
[32:50] speak the word for him and here's the
[32:52] response that this person had you know
[32:55] what not one of his kids can have a
[32:57] sniffle less he takes it to a doctor
[33:00] he goes a poor degraded deluded thing
[33:02] like that a woman that just wanted to
[33:05] throw off said when his children get
[33:07] sick he takes them to a doctor
[33:09] this idea that oh when God is really
[33:11] moving God is doing things and oh God
[33:13] must be moving and that person may never
[33:15] it just speaks the word to be healed and
[33:17] the critic says oh no actually what
[33:18] happens when they when they get sick
[33:20] they can't have a sniffle unless he
[33:21] takes it to the doctor he says anybody
[33:23] that's sensible will do the same thing
[33:25] amen what if their kid's sick take him
[33:28] to a doctor he said this is just someone
[33:30] who's trying to throw off he says people
[33:32] can't understand that medicine is sent
[33:34] of God
[33:36] why brother if it's not it's of the
[33:37] devil God is where medicine won't reach
[33:40] certainly medicine is of god well you
[33:44] say I know what a lot of doctors just oh
[33:46] yes and I know a lot of preachers the
[33:48] same way too
[33:50] it's not the man that's handling it what
[33:52] it it's what it is I know many men are
[33:55] handling the word of God that don't
[33:56] believe in Divine Healing don't even
[33:57] believe in God but they handle it just
[34:00] the same there's many men out there with
[34:02] medicine and surgery and stuff that
[34:04] denies God and everything else but
[34:05] there's many one that believes him too
[34:09] so if it helps people it's of God
[34:13] I don't have to take the car this is
[34:16] um
[34:17] I'll pause right there
[34:20] brother Ram's addressing those little
[34:22] suspicions that are sold into people's
[34:24] hearts and he says it's a sensible thing
[34:27] to go to your doctor
[34:28] and he says now if the argument is well
[34:30] this doctor is greedy and this doctor's
[34:32] that and he's in the he's kind of in the
[34:33] back pocket of the pharmacy pharmacies
[34:35] or whatever the pharmaceutical companies
[34:36] now if you can't have any confidence in
[34:38] them it's not going to be able to help
[34:40] you
[34:41] and and where there's bad doctors he
[34:43] says there's bad preachers
[34:45] and everybody's like well probably more
[34:47] bad preachers right and it's like
[34:49] there's always those who handle
[34:51] something are associated with something
[34:52] that don't represent the norm or the
[34:54] general or the or the real true and and
[34:56] right
[34:57] so he's saying let's not let's not use
[34:59] the bad or the negative to cast
[35:01] everything in a bad light he's saying
[35:03] that God uses medicine and if it helps
[35:05] people it's of God
[35:08] and there's a lot there's a whole so
[35:10] many more statements I could bring in
[35:11] here where brother mom talks about how
[35:12] uh doctors have come up with ways to
[35:14] treat people and inoculate people and
[35:16] even in a you know oh and from the
[35:20] standpoint of taking care of things
[35:22] beforehand and whether it be vaccines or
[35:25] certain precautions and being a
[35:27] proactive to protect yourself remember
[35:29] says these things are of God
[35:31] if it helps people it's of God now this
[35:33] is a to me it's just a tremendous
[35:35] example he says so if it helps people
[35:38] it's of God I don't have to take that
[35:40] car and ride home tonight
[35:42] I can walk if I want to
[35:44] but God made me a car so I thank God for
[35:46] it
[35:48] you don't have to go to the doctor
[35:50] you don't have to you don't have to if
[35:52] you don't want to but he says God can
[35:54] give you God can help you through that
[35:55] doctor
[35:56] it's my words now just taking the
[35:58] analogy he used you don't have to take
[35:59] the car home right science produced the
[36:02] car scientists produce the clothes that
[36:04] you wear right and we're not all just
[36:06] shivering out in the cold with nothing
[36:08] on because it's from the Tree of
[36:09] knowledge of Good and Evil there's
[36:11] things that we use and we use it
[36:13] prudently and we use it rationally and
[36:15] we we use it within measure and we and
[36:18] even brother Brown he's talking about
[36:19] toxins and and prescriptions he says
[36:21] that you got to get a doctor who knows
[36:22] how to mix it together right if you get
[36:24] some sort of Quack and he does too much
[36:26] of it it can kill you so things need to
[36:28] be in measure they have to be in context
[36:29] they have to be balanced you want to
[36:31] have the right approach he says all
[36:33] things come from God but use them
[36:36] sensibly
[36:37] don't go insane with them
[36:41] perfect
[36:43] all things come from God but don't but
[36:45] use them sensibly don't go insane with
[36:48] them if I could say this don't let the
[36:49] doctor become your Paradigm don't let
[36:51] the medicine become your Paradigm don't
[36:53] let the alternative medicine become your
[36:55] Paradigm don't let the alternative
[36:56] treatments and remedies become your
[36:57] Paradigm he says don't go insane with
[37:00] them use them sensibly in other words
[37:01] stay within that faithful mind that that
[37:05] sane sensible approach where you're
[37:06] rooted in ground in the scripture rooted
[37:08] ground in the word of God and you don't
[37:09] go insane with it where you're all in
[37:12] just the same way some people can be
[37:14] about Automobiles and cars that's all
[37:16] they're about they're they're all into
[37:17] their car their car becomes the idle
[37:19] their car becomes the god you can do the
[37:21] same thing about lifestyles
[37:23] when I say Lifestyles I mean just
[37:25] dietary Lifestyles right I guess the
[37:27] joke is do you know how to tell
[37:28] someone's a vegan just wait they'll tell
[37:31] you right because it's a religion to
[37:33] them it's a belief system it's not about
[37:35] diet and nutrition it's a political
[37:36] Cause And so there's a lot of things
[37:38] that they're going to let you know why
[37:39] because they've gone insane with it
[37:43] he says let's be sensible about it don't
[37:46] go insane with them don't don't go
[37:48] insane with what surgery medicine
[37:51] cures remedies helps anything that could
[37:55] be from that that the physician or the
[37:57] Cure or the approach all the means that
[37:59] God could use to help you he says God
[38:00] made him if it helps people that's okay
[38:02] but he says let's be sensible about it
[38:04] don't go insane with it
[38:07] I know this I this is just very
[38:10] practical I feel very impressed as a
[38:11] pastor here to share these things so you
[38:12] know where brother Branham stood on them
[38:15] now my final statement I want to read to
[38:17] you tonight is from the sermon Shepherd
[38:18] of the Sheepfold
[38:20] 1956 brother Brown says and today we
[38:22] have osteopath chiropractors Medical
[38:24] Science Divine Healing and each one
[38:26] seems to fight against the other
[38:28] and now friends we got to admit that all
[38:31] of them help people
[38:33] you got to admit it tonight
[38:35] chiropractors help people
[38:37] you gotta meditate the osteopath the
[38:39] Medical Science Divine they all help
[38:40] people
[38:41] he says that's right and why can't
[38:42] people forget their differences and
[38:44] let's all work together to try to help
[38:46] our fellow man our brother
[38:48] and if we don't have that kind of motive
[38:50] my opinion that there's some other
[38:52] selfish motive behind it
[38:54] think listen to this statement if I knew
[38:56] that drinking a drink of water or doing
[38:58] anything would try to help somebody God
[39:00] knows I'm for it that's all
[39:03] if water would do it anything he says if
[39:05] it's going to help somebody God knows
[39:06] I'm for it that's all anything if
[39:08] osteopathic Chiropractic medical science
[39:10] or anything could give anybody some help
[39:12] praise God for it
[39:14] I thank him with all my heart that's
[39:16] right that we have those things
[39:19] he's willing to praise God for it and if
[39:21] we could just take that old selfish
[39:23] motive the medical scientists say oh
[39:26] there's nothing to Chiropractic
[39:27] Chiropractic there's nothing to Medical
[39:29] Science
[39:30] and both of them there's nothing to
[39:32] Divine Healing
[39:33] there's I had I don't know how a dozen
[39:36] pages of these statements I could have
[39:38] read to you well it doesn't if you want
[39:40] if you want all the quotes
[39:42] um I'll teach you how to search no if
[39:44] you want the quotes I can provide them
[39:45] for you brother I'm just so consistent
[39:47] with it
[39:48] recognizing this rivalry among different
[39:50] approaches to the body and what we like
[39:52] to approach things this way and some
[39:53] people approach it that way you know
[39:54] then they all have
[39:56] um truth to them and they all have
[39:57] different ways of helping people and
[39:59] really he's looking at if there's just a
[40:00] way that we could all get away from our
[40:02] fear and our suspicion and encourage one
[40:05] another uh what one works for one person
[40:07] may not work for another what one person
[40:09] can do another person can't do
[40:12] a lot of different things that help
[40:15] and can only help one that may not help
[40:17] another there's some people that their
[40:18] physical condition and the condition of
[40:20] their bones and their actual or whatever
[40:22] it is they're suffering with it'd be the
[40:24] worst that he could do to go
[40:25] chiropractor
[40:27] and and but yet there's people and
[40:28] myself I've benefited tremendously by
[40:30] going to chiropractors
[40:32] but it's not these things aren't always
[40:33] for people but he says this is attitude
[40:36] there's nothing to the chiropractor
[40:37] there's nothing to the general
[40:38] practitioner there's nothing to the
[40:39] surgeon there's nothing to this nothing
[40:40] and then they all say there's nothing
[40:41] about Divine heal and he says let's put
[40:43] our arms around another let's be
[40:44] Brethren Let's help somebody let's make
[40:47] life a little easier these people ain't
[40:49] going to be here very long let's just
[40:52] try to make it just as easy for them
[40:54] if the osteopathic chiropractor whatever
[40:56] it is if it can help you go ahead and do
[40:59] it that's fine give God the praise
[41:04] that's exactly
[41:05] I hope that this has helped at least
[41:07] somebody
[41:08] to take that little that little imp of
[41:10] the devil
[41:11] he starts trying to tell you that
[41:13] whatever you have done to help yourself
[41:16] has been a a sign of unbelief and it's
[41:19] put you in a compromised position to
[41:20] seek God for help
[41:22] I hope it gets rid of that
[41:24] but if anybody has in the Sin of Asa
[41:27] sought only the Physicians sought only
[41:30] the oil sought only the remedy sought
[41:32] only the the prescriptions only did this
[41:34] and has kind of left God out of it
[41:37] right because we have the idea I'll give
[41:38] God a chance first
[41:41] and if that doesn't work then I'll go to
[41:42] science
[41:43] I mean where did where have you put
[41:45] yourself
[41:46] and so we're giving God a chance in him
[41:49] only whatever way that he'll use and and
[41:52] I hope this has helped us tonight he
[41:53] says if it can help go ahead and do it
[41:55] that's fine give God the praise
[41:59] he says if somebody comes through with
[42:00] the gift of healing Faith well don't
[42:02] give the man praise give God praise if
[42:05] the doctor can set your arm when it's
[42:06] broke and fix it up make it real
[42:08] straight and God heals it give God
[42:10] praise that's right if the chiropractor
[42:12] you get a dislocated spine he can
[42:13] straighten the back up and make you walk
[42:15] right again give God praise not the man
[42:17] let's all together and all that is
[42:20] coming from God all good and perfect
[42:22] gifts come from God God Alone
[42:25] I say that if you're sick God's your
[42:27] healer and if you're doing something to
[42:29] help yourself and go and it can help you
[42:31] go ahead and do it that's fine but give
[42:33] God the glory if you're taking a pill
[42:36] say I am the Lord who heals all thy
[42:37] diseases you confess it you believe it
[42:39] and no no medicine no company no
[42:42] approach no doctor no belief system no
[42:45] Cult of healing whatever me is going to
[42:47] get the credit you say I'm a believer
[42:49] I'm trusting the Lord this is the one
[42:50] he's brought my way I'll place this lump
[42:53] of figs upon the boil and I believe that
[42:55] God's going to heal me
[42:57] give God the praise
[43:00] could we stand together tonight
