[0:00] matthew chapter 5 we'll start with verse
[0:02] 13
[0:03] and we'll read to verse 16. i'm going to
[0:05] touch on this a little bit this morning
[0:08] but i realized uh
[0:10] that as i studied it and looked at it it
[0:12] just kept getting maybe more broad and
[0:14] i'm trying i try and try not to get
[0:16] pulled too deeply into the elements here
[0:19] to unpack them begin to unpack them but
[0:21] i would like to
[0:23] kind of touch the surface of it um in
[0:25] the beginning and so matthew chapter 5
[0:27] verses 13 to 16. ye are the salt of the
[0:30] earth
[0:31] but if the salt have lost its savior
[0:33] wherewith shall it be salted it has
[0:36] sends forth good for nothing but to be
[0:38] cast out and to be trodden under foot of
[0:40] men
[0:41] ye are the light of the world a city
[0:43] that is set on the hill cannot be hid
[0:45] neither do men light a candle and put it
[0:47] in under a bushel but on a candle stick
[0:49] and it giveth light unto all that are in
[0:51] the house
[0:52] let your light so shine before men that
[0:55] they may see your good works and glorify
[0:58] your father
[0:59] which is in heaven amen god bless you
[1:01] you may be seated
[1:04] we had been ministering through i
[1:05] believe it was four different services
[1:07] on
[1:08] the bride's advocate or our advocate
[1:12] as believers
[1:13] and what i'm wanting to then transition
[1:16] into and i consider it still part of the
[1:18] same
[1:19] uh the same thought and the same
[1:20] emphasis so i'm actually gonna pick back
[1:23] up in first john chapter two but now i
[1:25] want to look at the bride's advocacy
[1:28] and so there were some things that we
[1:29] mentioned and preached on the advocate
[1:30] how we saw how christ advocated and how
[1:33] he prayed and we began to understand
[1:35] what an advocate was and so we have an
[1:38] advocate and now i want to look at the
[1:39] fact that we are also advocates and so
[1:42] we have a ministry we have advocacy
[1:44] we're just going to start start this
[1:46] subject today i'm very excited about it
[1:48] just
[1:49] maybe more than i have been uh for any
[1:52] time for a series
[1:53] subject looking i'm just very very
[1:56] excited about it and i see it as kind of
[1:57] a momentum and accumulation of many
[2:00] things that we've been ministering on so
[2:01] if you want to take your bibles and look
[2:03] at first john chapter 2
[2:05] verses 1 to 2. i want to read these
[2:06] scriptures again and just touch on very
[2:08] quickly
[2:09] who our advocate is and how he's
[2:11] connected with
[2:13] mercy or the perpetuation
[2:15] and then begin to look at some personal
[2:17] things about us how that we also now
[2:20] have entered into personal relationship
[2:21] with christ
[2:22] and and then and then step into matthew
[2:25] chapter 5. so he says my little children
[2:27] these things write i unto you that you
[2:29] sin not so the purpose of writing the
[2:31] scripture
[2:32] is to never provide us a justification
[2:35] for our sins but to be justified
[2:37] from them
[2:38] and not that we would make excuses for
[2:40] our weakness but that we be taught
[2:42] faithfully taught and then be able to
[2:44] walk above things and to overcome them
[2:46] so he's saying i write these things that
[2:47] you sin not
[2:49] and then he provides this comfort if any
[2:50] man sin we have an advocate with the
[2:53] father
[2:54] jesus christ the righteous so our
[2:56] advocate is jesus christ the righteous
[2:59] and he jesus christ the righteous is the
[3:01] perpetuation for our sins and not for
[3:04] ours only but also for the sins of the
[3:07] whole world
[3:08] this is
[3:09] what we've been drawing from and
[3:11] inspired by how that we have an advocate
[3:13] with the father the word advocate is
[3:15] also the same for comforter when jesus
[3:18] is speaking in john chapter 14 and 15
[3:20] and the spirit of truth and the uh the
[3:23] the comforter is also the advocate it's
[3:25] the same word that is used so it's the
[3:27] same subject the same thought the same
[3:29] ministry the same person
[3:31] and an advocate is one who pleads
[3:33] another's cause
[3:35] and we looked at this how that we have
[3:37] an advocate for us who stands before the
[3:39] father this representation of the shed
[3:42] blood that pleads our case and it's
[3:44] through that pleading and through that
[3:46] uh representation of an advocate that
[3:48] brings us into fellowship with the
[3:50] father and has eradicated our sins and
[3:52] abolished sin and placated god's wrath
[3:56] for our sins and we enter into
[3:58] relationship
[3:59] and then we looked at this this role of
[4:01] an advocate how he pleads another's
[4:03] cause so he's pleading our cause he's
[4:05] there to support us he's there to lift
[4:07] us up and to encourage us and an
[4:09] advocate this is advocate this is a
[4:11] definition you'd find in the webster
[4:12] dictionary it's one that promotes or
[4:14] supports a cause
[4:16] a group or an interest something that
[4:18] promotes something that supports that's
[4:20] what an advocate does
[4:22] and john's joining it with our
[4:25] perpetuation so that perpetuation means
[4:27] it's the means of appeasing or
[4:29] satisfying it's translated to mercy seat
[4:32] in the new testament and it's pointing
[4:34] to and this is an image that'd be very
[4:36] profound to a jew to an israelite that
[4:38] would be pointing to the ark of the
[4:41] covenant that was so special to them and
[4:43] so powerful and even even very
[4:45] mysterious to them in the days that if
[4:47] this is being written but he's pointing
[4:49] to the mercy seat alluding to the mercy
[4:51] seat which was the lid or the covering
[4:53] of the ark of the covenant in the most
[4:54] holy place the holy of holies
[4:57] and so there was
[4:58] something very significant wherein the
[5:00] high priest went in one time a year on
[5:02] the day of atonement and and and put
[5:04] blood upon this mercy seat and it was a
[5:07] symbolism it was just a symbol of god
[5:09] the people being reconciled to god
[5:11] because of their sins and it was
[5:13] something repeated year after year
[5:15] so our advocate with the father
[5:18] is jesus christ the righteous we have
[5:20] this this image of mine jesus christ the
[5:22] righteous is our advocate with the
[5:24] father then also we must look at it this
[5:27] way our advocate not with the father
[5:29] necessarily alone but within us is the
[5:32] comforter the spirit of truth so we have
[5:34] an advocate with the father but this
[5:36] advocate the spirit of truth the
[5:37] comforter we are told dwells in us it's
[5:40] the baptism of the holy ghost gives us
[5:41] that inside teacher the the comforter is
[5:44] on the inside of us
[5:46] and so with our position in christ
[5:48] secured
[5:49] and having it secured
[5:51] and having our destiny certain
[5:54] my question is what is our advocacy
[5:56] if you ponder this brother dan i didn't
[5:58] notice you there until just now and i
[6:00] got nervous when i saw him like oh great
[6:02] the one who just preached is here uh
[6:04] auditing my course
[6:05] and uh he's gonna i'm gonna
[6:08] he asked me to be honest with him you
[6:09] know about how how you enjoyed the
[6:11] service and and
[6:12] let me know or not ask how i enjoy the
[6:14] services just let me know if there's
[6:16] anything that you any criticism anything
[6:18] you can help me with
[6:19] and uh i've just i feel like i have so
[6:22] much to learn and so i benefit from
[6:23] ministry
[6:24] and so i the same to you brother daniel
[6:27] if there's any pointers or tips you can
[6:28] give me and maybe one of them would be
[6:30] just don't completely stop down in the
[6:32] middle of your sermon and call somebody
[6:34] out and start rambling and looking like
[6:35] a rookie so i apologize
[6:38] but i just didn't notice you there it's
[6:39] really nice to have you i want to thank
[6:40] you for ministering
[6:42] for us on wednesday i was greatly
[6:43] blessed tremendously blessed
[6:45] so if i could just kind of gather my
[6:48] thoughts again should we just start all
[6:49] over
[6:51] greetings would be appropriate before
[6:52] you get this far
[6:54] but we we our position is secure in
[6:56] christ
[6:57] we we have this advocate with the father
[7:00] that gives us a tremendous it gives us
[7:01] comfort because our advocate is a
[7:02] comforter so that relationship gives us
[7:05] comfort then we have this advocate
[7:06] within us
[7:07] so our position and christ is secured
[7:09] and our destiny is certain there's there
[7:11] should be no well i know i'm sealed and
[7:14] but i just don't know if i'm going to
[7:15] get there well that doesn't that doesn't
[7:16] make sense scripturally and so we're
[7:18] trying to transitioning with with this
[7:20] tremendous gift of the holy ghost with
[7:22] this seal of god that we have down in
[7:24] our souls with this position in christ
[7:26] and the advocate we have with the father
[7:28] and the advocate we have within us what
[7:30] do we advocate for
[7:32] what is our advocacy
[7:34] and so i want to give a definition here
[7:37] on advocacy because it's tied to you
[7:39] could kind of just take
[7:41] advocate maybe conjugate it use it as a
[7:43] verb or kind of use it now transitioning
[7:45] to advocacy is a noun it's the act of
[7:48] pleading for
[7:49] supporting or recommending
[7:52] so advocacy is when you are pleading for
[7:54] something supporting something or
[7:55] recommending something it's the active
[7:57] support of an idea cause or policy and
[8:01] it says active support
[8:03] not just maybe a thought process or an
[8:04] ascent or an agreement with but it's
[8:06] active support of an idea the active
[8:08] support of a cause
[8:10] active support of a particular policy
[8:12] and it's especially the act of pleading
[8:15] or arguing for something
[8:18] so advocacy is the act of pleading for
[8:20] something arguing for something standing
[8:23] for something actively promoting
[8:25] and supporting the interest of something
[8:27] or the the cause or a group and so it
[8:30] has to do with active support
[8:33] now so let me just take a step back with
[8:35] this that's our thought the bride's
[8:37] advocacy our advocacy
[8:39] now individually this is all of us as
[8:41] individuals we've entered into if you've
[8:43] been born again you've entered into the
[8:45] most holy place
[8:47] you've entered in behind the veil and
[8:49] that's the image that paul has given us
[8:51] in the book of hebrews and so we're
[8:53] spiritually now
[8:54] between the cherubim communing with
[8:56] christ
[8:57] he is our high priest who is abolished
[8:59] any separation between us and god and he
[9:01] is he is uh forever consecrated this
[9:04] access to the father and so we now enter
[9:08] into fellowship and communion with god
[9:11] and we are raised up seated in heavenly
[9:13] places in christ jesus this is the
[9:15] promise
[9:16] that we've received and we're and we're
[9:18] secure in that and we we enjoy that and
[9:21] we have this place in christ where we've
[9:23] entered into and i want you to have that
[9:24] image in your mind we've entered into
[9:27] as they have a literal most holy place
[9:29] in the tabernacle
[9:31] and you have the outer court the inner
[9:32] court then this most holy place and
[9:34] there's this one veil from the outer
[9:36] court into the inner court and then you
[9:37] had to enter into another veil and get
[9:39] into that place where only the high
[9:40] priest went
[9:42] so
[9:43] paul in the book of hebrews is saying
[9:44] that we have this high priest forever
[9:46] after the order of melchizedek and it's
[9:48] done something for us where we've
[9:50] entered into that place as a believer
[9:53] and in hebrews chapter 6 verse 19 as
[9:55] he's drawing this picture out he says
[9:58] which hope we have as an anchor of the
[10:00] soul both sure and steadfast this is for
[10:02] you individually we have the anchor of
[10:04] the soul which is sure and said fast
[10:06] which entereth into that within the veil
[10:10] think of this image that he is showing
[10:12] us we who are born again have entered
[10:14] behind the veil we are in the most holy
[10:17] place that is where we are spiritually
[10:19] because we know physically we're looking
[10:21] around well this doesn't quite look like
[10:22] the most holy place i mean i guess
[10:24] there's just not a level of fan hood
[10:26] that you could have for hilton where
[10:28] you'd ever confuse the banquet room for
[10:30] the most holy place
[10:32] but this is we realize this is a
[10:34] spiritual position it has to have a
[10:35] reality to us and and it's got a really
[10:38] uh anchor in our hearts that we've
[10:39] entered in behind the veil
[10:41] and so when we when he uses this image
[10:43] of entering within that veil that's a
[10:46] place that sealed off
[10:48] this would be a place that just a normal
[10:50] average everyday israelite uh there
[10:53] before the tabernacle could look out and
[10:54] they could see the the the tent and then
[10:57] they could maybe some would have a
[10:59] service within the outer court and some
[11:01] that would have service within the uh
[11:03] the different ones that would have
[11:05] service in the intercourse but there's
[11:06] only one person that could go in behind
[11:08] the veil that'd be a secret place
[11:11] the questions that would be asked and
[11:12] you have all the details but to
[11:13] experience it and know what it looks
[11:15] like it's something only one person
[11:17] could uh enjoy but now we are in that
[11:20] place
[11:21] seemingly behind the veil
[11:24] very secret
[11:26] and i'm being very deliberate my
[11:27] terminology
[11:28] uh because i believe that this the the
[11:30] secret place in a hidden place
[11:33] and something private something very
[11:34] personal uh it's important to begin to
[11:37] ponder these these elements of even the
[11:39] word of god in this hour that opens up
[11:42] and it's in a private place in a secret
[11:44] place in a hidden place and it
[11:46] transpires within our deep within our
[11:48] hearts
[11:49] this is where we are as believers
[11:51] individually
[11:53] and in colossians and then collectively
[11:54] as believers we enjoy this but it's
[11:56] something very personal to the
[11:57] individual
[11:59] and colossians chapter 3 verse 3 it says
[12:00] for ye are dead and your life is hid
[12:04] with christ in god
[12:06] oh what a beautiful statement your life
[12:08] is hid
[12:09] with christ in god so there you are with
[12:12] christ in god that's the believer's
[12:14] position your real spiritual life then
[12:17] is hid
[12:18] and who has it hid from the world
[12:21] the spiritual life now
[12:23] the spiritual life he's not he's not
[12:24] advocating for uh being a hidden
[12:26] christian
[12:28] your real spiritual life is hid from the
[12:30] world laid up in god with christ
[12:34] with the one who is the perpetuation for
[12:36] our sins and it's given us the earnest
[12:38] of redemption so this is a very secure
[12:40] place this is a very safe place
[12:43] and the glory of the inner life this uh
[12:47] the power that we feel the peace that we
[12:49] have everything that's in this inner
[12:51] life it comes from our communion with
[12:54] him
[12:55] there between the cherubim i'll meet you
[12:57] and i'll commune with thee we're there
[12:58] spiritually communing with the word of
[13:00] god and from that we receive power we
[13:03] receive um this glory in the inner life
[13:06] uh from this communion with him but yet
[13:08] it's hidden
[13:10] it's a hidden communion
[13:12] it's concealed
[13:15] and notice the this i want you to
[13:17] recognize this in the scripture first
[13:18] john chapter three verse one
[13:20] so we read even first john chapter two
[13:22] and now we're reading in the very next
[13:24] chapter as in it so has this image
[13:27] within the same thought that he is
[13:28] sharing behold what manner of love the
[13:30] father hath bestowed upon us
[13:32] that we should be called the sons of god
[13:35] what love
[13:36] that we can call ourselves daughters of
[13:37] god sons of god what love has been
[13:39] bestowed upon us what grace then he says
[13:42] therefore the world knoweth knoweth us
[13:45] not because it knew him not so we say
[13:48] well the world hates you because it
[13:49] hated him
[13:51] and it so he told the disciples they're
[13:52] going to hate you so i'm going to give
[13:53] you a comforter and just know that when
[13:55] they hate you they hated me first he
[13:57] says the world doesn't know us because
[13:59] it doesn't know him
[14:02] it's quite the quite the phrase doesn't
[14:04] mean when you're christian people just
[14:06] forget who you are i'm sorry again what
[14:07] was your name
[14:08] but there's something about
[14:10] us that's hidden from them
[14:13] and just as there was something about
[14:15] christ that was hidden from them they
[14:18] didn't know him therefore they don't
[14:19] know us
[14:20] and a life that is hidden christ you can
[14:23] just ponder this a life that is truly
[14:24] sealed and and take ownership of it for
[14:27] yourself if you haven't been born again
[14:29] seek it with everything that's in your
[14:30] heart don't don't stop uh until you know
[14:33] that it's been made secure in your heart
[14:35] to believe the promise search it out
[14:37] identify it believe it accept it and so
[14:40] make that your ambition
[14:42] uh to to understand it to be taught
[14:44] right and to receive it
[14:45] but the the life hidden in christ
[14:48] is more mysterious to the world than any
[14:50] other life
[14:52] a believer's life who's entered in
[14:54] behind the veil because it's it's one of
[14:56] these things the world might call it
[14:57] magic or something but we've actually
[15:00] entered in behind a veil
[15:03] spiritual very very real
[15:05] very supernatural but very real we've
[15:08] entered in behind that and so we have a
[15:11] reality that transcends anything that we
[15:12] know through our senses
[15:14] and we've entered into a reality that
[15:16] cannot be comprehended or touched with
[15:19] our spiritual senses so this is
[15:21] something very deep something very
[15:23] profound something very uh very
[15:25] important that we've entered in behind
[15:26] this veil and we're living there behind
[15:28] this veil we have this life that's in
[15:31] there and so that hidden life
[15:33] that we're drawing from that we're
[15:35] living by that we're experiencing that
[15:36] we're enjoying is more mysterious than
[15:39] any other life
[15:41] we could have
[15:42] somebody who's uh
[15:44] um
[15:46] in a mysterious society
[15:48] or some secret club
[15:51] and you may you may be part of some uh
[15:56] some group that you know meets and
[15:58] behind closed doors and and there's a
[16:01] mysticism associated with it and all
[16:03] that tradition and all that circumstance
[16:06] and all the meetings and all the
[16:07] handshakes and all the symbolism and
[16:09] everything
[16:10] that cannot touch at all
[16:13] the mystery mystery of a life that's
[16:15] hidden christ
[16:17] a christian a the real christian life is
[16:19] more mysterious to the world than any
[16:21] other kind of discipline any other kind
[16:23] of life any other kind of way of
[16:24] thinking and believing and living and
[16:26] acting is the most mysterious of all
[16:28] life
[16:30] because in there we are fed by food that
[16:32] is hidden
[16:33] right
[16:34] we're fed by hidden manna
[16:36] we're supported and sustained by hands
[16:38] that are unseen it's we're guided by by
[16:41] insight and intelligence that the world
[16:43] does not know and cannot see
[16:45] we we read a bible that we say well i'm
[16:47] reading the same bible that you're
[16:48] reading but it means something different
[16:50] to you you get something else out of it
[16:52] people look at the word of god look at
[16:54] the message of the hour and they see the
[16:56] surface of it and then your life
[16:59] being the interpretation of it becomes
[17:00] more mysterious than any other religion
[17:03] any other theology
[17:07] so
[17:08] this is a very hidden life
[17:10] but does this mean that there is no
[17:12] public manifestation
[17:15] for the christian
[17:16] as we ponder that if we have this hidden
[17:18] life in christ and and we're hidden away
[17:20] and we're very mysterious and the world
[17:22] doesn't know us because they didn't know
[17:23] him is there is there no visible
[17:25] ministry for the christian
[17:29] in matthew chapter 5 verses 13 to 16.
[17:31] let's begin here to identify this and i
[17:34] feel that it is a rhetorical question
[17:36] because i don't know that any of us
[17:37] would say oh no
[17:38] the believer is to be a secret believer
[17:41] and we're to have a secret faith in
[17:44] christ and we're to be able to kind of
[17:46] be a chameleon christian and fit into
[17:48] whatever you know when in rome
[17:51] and be all things to all men and just
[17:53] take those scriptures and kind of change
[17:54] them and manipulate them and contort
[17:56] them to where we just kind of want to
[17:58] fit in with everybody and go along with
[17:59] the crowd and not offend and still
[18:02] believe and be a secret christian secret
[18:04] believer
[18:06] but there is a pup there is a visible
[18:09] ministry
[18:11] notice how
[18:12] jesus describes you when he says ye
[18:16] you could read and say i
[18:19] i am
[18:20] matthew chapter 5 verses 13 to 16 i'll
[18:22] break it up just a little bit and touch
[18:24] on some points here ye are the salt of
[18:26] the earth so you are salt
[18:29] and not just salt in a shaker on
[18:30] somebody's table but of the earth
[18:33] you're not just a stash in somebody's
[18:35] pantry you are the salt of the earth
[18:38] so there's no other source of salt for
[18:40] the earth
[18:41] than you
[18:42] and whatever image and this is where you
[18:44] kind of get pulled in some of the
[18:45] specifics or the types of it but
[18:47] whatever purpose salt serves in the
[18:49] earth naturally
[18:52] globally
[18:53] as far as a resource you are that to the
[18:56] earth in a very real way
[18:58] you are the salt of the earth but if the
[19:00] salt have lost its savor
[19:03] it means to become flat or tasteless the
[19:05] word actually relates to foolishness if
[19:07] it becomes foolishness
[19:09] wherewith shall it be salted how is the
[19:10] earth going to be salted
[19:12] it is then forth good for nothing but to
[19:14] be cast out and to be trodden under foot
[19:17] of men
[19:18] so if the if this if the salt
[19:21] becomes flat or tasteless or foolish and
[19:24] doesn't serve a purpose
[19:26] that it's intended
[19:28] and it doesn't have the effect or the
[19:30] impact that that people rely upon it for
[19:33] and that it and that it's what it's used
[19:35] for then you you can only use it to be
[19:37] trodden under the foot of man it's
[19:39] almost cast in it is worthless
[19:42] and so the the believer it says you are
[19:45] salt of the earth the salt of the earth
[19:46] the believer has a responsibility
[19:49] just think very quickly what we use salt
[19:51] for most often
[19:54] we are
[19:55] if we use it in preservation of things
[19:57] or the seasoning
[19:59] of food to give taste
[20:01] and to work together and harmonize with
[20:03] different elements to produce a desired
[20:05] outcome
[20:06] in cooking we have the role of seasoning
[20:09] others
[20:11] the christian has the role in the impact
[20:14] of seasoning others seasoning community
[20:17] seasoning seasoning an area a
[20:20] neighborhood a family
[20:22] so just think as christianities become
[20:24] watered down
[20:26] our communities and our local
[20:27] governments and a nation as a whole and
[20:29] the whole world has lost the seasoning
[20:33] that christianity was to provide to the
[20:35] whole world
[20:37] the the the impact and the effect of
[20:39] having a christian and having one who
[20:41] stood for principles of the word of god
[20:43] and stood for right it has the impact of
[20:46] seasoning others
[20:48] of preserving and with upholding and
[20:50] keeping corruption from setting in
[20:53] and so this is the this is the role that
[20:55] a believer has this is the role that you
[20:57] have you have a responsibility to season
[21:00] others
[21:02] and so if it says if the salt loses its
[21:04] savior
[21:06] listen the word never loses its power
[21:09] the word never loses its savor
[21:12] but ministry can
[21:14] witness can
[21:16] testimony can
[21:18] grace can never lose its effectiveness
[21:22] but it's our personal witness it's our
[21:24] personal testimony
[21:25] it's our doctrine will never lose its
[21:29] but it's our
[21:31] it's our fallen away from it wherein the
[21:33] salt loses its savior because we're the
[21:36] salt
[21:38] the salt of the earth
[21:42] he says you're the light of the world
[21:47] christianity cannot exist in name only
[21:51] believer
[21:53] should not exist in name only
[21:56] message believer
[21:57] should not exist in name only it ought
[21:59] not to be a a nomination that we give
[22:02] ourselves and we identify ourselves as
[22:05] as a particular group
[22:07] there's a radio station when i was in
[22:09] college that again it just started out
[22:11] as a sports talk radio station and when
[22:14] the on the first day that it started
[22:16] everyone who was there on the first day
[22:18] gave themselves a name
[22:20] and they called themselves the p ones
[22:22] and i think that had something to do
[22:23] with the old radios that had a p1 preset
[22:26] so you were day one p1 and you and you
[22:29] had there was only one preset it was
[22:30] your first it was your number one that
[22:32] you went to and so everybody identifies
[22:34] themselves by this designation are you a
[22:37] p1
[22:39] right and we and we have certain
[22:41] characteristics that we give ourselves
[22:43] and we i identify ourselves as and i
[22:45] think it's very easy for us to say oh
[22:47] i'm a message believer
[22:49] i'm a christian i'm a believer i'm a i'm
[22:52] a son or daughter of god and those
[22:54] things should not exist in name only but
[22:56] they must have a virtue
[22:59] they must have a strength within it to
[23:02] season others and as jesus says we are a
[23:04] light now not only is it the role of
[23:06] salt but now it's the role of light
[23:09] in verse 14 you're the light of the
[23:11] world a city that is set on a hill
[23:14] cannot be hid
[23:15] now this ought to really impact us in
[23:18] this bright age to recognize that we as
[23:21] the bride of christ are coming into this
[23:23] manifestation of the new jerusalem
[23:26] that john saw
[23:28] i'm going to come and show you uh uh the
[23:31] the new jerusalem i'll show you the
[23:33] bride the lamb's wife and what does he
[23:34] see a city
[23:36] why because the bride the lamb's wife is
[23:38] represented as a city that's going to be
[23:40] set on a hill
[23:42] so now spiritually we are coming into
[23:44] this representation this manifestation
[23:46] of being the city that is set on a hill
[23:50] so now if you if you think of these
[23:52] elements we are the salt of the earth
[23:54] and the light of the world
[23:57] what would this world look like without
[23:58] salt and light
[24:01] salt of the earth in light of the world
[24:05] believers are god's instruments of
[24:07] seasoning preservation
[24:09] and illumination
[24:12] there's gonna be any light in the world
[24:14] you're the light of it
[24:15] didn't paul tell the believer now ye are
[24:17] light
[24:18] if there's going to be any seasoning or
[24:20] any any effect of uh withstanding
[24:23] corruption or preserving you're going to
[24:24] do it
[24:27] your salt and light
[24:29] so a city set on a hill cannot be hid
[24:31] now as he begins to amplify what it
[24:33] means to be your the light of the world
[24:34] neither do men light a candle and put it
[24:36] under a bushel but on a candle stick
[24:39] and it giveth light unto all that are in
[24:42] the house we see an image then of the
[24:44] seven church ages and the candlesticks
[24:46] that are given to light up the age and
[24:48] for that age as one would have a candle
[24:50] to light up their house another house
[24:53] has to have a candle to light up their
[24:54] house
[24:56] but then there's a city set on a hill
[25:00] so he says this with these images in
[25:02] mind let your light so shine let your
[25:05] light shine in like manner collectively
[25:07] as a city set on a hill that cannot be
[25:09] hid or is a candle that is placed upon a
[25:12] candlestick and not under bushel or
[25:14] hidden
[25:15] you don't light a candle then cover it
[25:17] up but you set it in such a place and
[25:19] you lift it up and you you're very
[25:21] purposeful and intentional in where you
[25:23] put it that it might might give
[25:25] appropriate light for the activity and
[25:27] the people who are engaging in it in the
[25:29] house
[25:31] oh it's dark in here light a candle i
[25:33] did well where is it i lit a candle and
[25:35] put it in the garage
[25:36] it's not doing me any good in the garage
[25:38] we need it out we need it up we need it
[25:40] we need it here i remember the other day
[25:42] we had some weather was coming in it was
[25:44] maybe like four o'clock
[25:45] in the afternoon some weather was coming
[25:47] in and it was it looked like a pretty
[25:48] good one and sister elizabeth lit a
[25:50] candle just in case the power went out
[25:51] it's like i think we got about four more
[25:53] hours before we're going to need that
[25:54] but good start and and that's what we do
[25:56] is we want to have light so we need a
[25:58] candle we need to place it in the right
[25:59] spot we need to be sure it's giving us
[26:01] light so he said let your light shine in
[26:03] like manner
[26:05] so we have a we have a personal audience
[26:07] with god behind the veil the world is
[26:10] sealed out the world doesn't know what's
[26:12] going on behind that veil
[26:14] where they're communing with god with
[26:16] christ
[26:17] in in the in between the cherubim
[26:21] they're represented in the mercy seat
[26:25] and then now jesus is saying that being
[26:28] your position
[26:29] you have a responsibility to let your
[26:32] light shine as a city on a hill or a
[26:35] candle in a house
[26:38] and in shining it has this this impact
[26:40] or this effect that they may see your
[26:42] good works and glorify your father which
[26:45] is in heaven
[26:47] we are salt and we are light remember
[26:49] that
[26:50] let me say just cut to the um just kind
[26:53] of get to the point having read these
[26:54] these verses here a believer has a
[26:56] public ministry
[26:59] every single believer has a public
[27:00] ministry if the word ministry kind of
[27:02] scares you a little bit and you think oh
[27:04] well i'm not a minister i'm not called
[27:05] to preach i'm not called to handle the
[27:06] word that's not what i'm referring to so
[27:09] let me say this way all of us have a
[27:11] public advocacy
[27:14] all of us have a a role and a
[27:18] responsibility of advocating for
[27:20] something
[27:23] the hidden life is a source of virtue
[27:24] but then in turn we must express it
[27:26] publicly
[27:28] the hidden life is the source of our
[27:29] glory the source of our strength the
[27:30] source of our joy but then we must turn
[27:32] it around and express it publicly
[27:36] as jesus has entered into that veil
[27:39] and your life is hid with christ in god
[27:42] and john said that the world doesn't
[27:44] know us because it didn't know him
[27:48] notice what it says in acts chapter 26
[27:50] verse 26 for the king knoweth of these
[27:52] things he's speaking
[27:54] uh i don't know if now i realize i'd if
[27:56] he's festus or agrippa but he's saying
[27:58] for the king knoweth of these things
[28:00] before whom also i speak freely
[28:03] for i am persuaded paul's speaking now
[28:05] he's speaking of jesus christ he's
[28:06] referring to the the things in christ
[28:08] ministry he says but you know these
[28:10] things
[28:11] and i'm speaking very freely before you
[28:13] about these things for i'm persuaded and
[28:15] i'm open with you and i'm just telling
[28:17] you what i know and what i believe to be
[28:19] true and you already know him you know
[28:21] him beforehand because he says i'm
[28:23] persuaded that none of these things are
[28:25] hidden from him
[28:29] none of these things are hidden from the
[28:30] king for this thing was not done in a
[28:33] corner
[28:34] think about that
[28:36] this thing it may seem a little bit
[28:38] crude illusion to christ but the
[28:40] ministry of christ was not done in a
[28:42] corner it was public
[28:45] the miracles that he performed were done
[28:47] openly
[28:49] this is this is the ministry of christ
[28:51] was not just to gather a group of people
[28:53] together and let's get our 12 and let's
[28:55] go hide let's go out in the wilderness
[28:57] and let's let's have a commune
[28:59] and let's indoctrinate one another and
[29:01] let's kind of come into this mindset and
[29:03] this attitude of this is how we think
[29:04] and that's how we believe and this is
[29:05] how we live and then you go out and kind
[29:07] of cherry pick and sit people down in
[29:09] coffee shops when no one else is
[29:10] listening and say all right now there's
[29:12] this messiah this master and this
[29:13] teacher don't leave him don't let
[29:15] anybody hear this
[29:16] but you got to come see this guy
[29:19] it wasn't jesus was not out there
[29:21] uh uh hidden
[29:23] but it was a public these things were
[29:24] not done in a corner
[29:28] same with the disciples
[29:30] their ministry their witness their
[29:32] manifestation of the life that was
[29:33] inside of them was not done in a corner
[29:36] so paul says in second corinthians
[29:38] chapter four verse three but if our
[29:39] gospel be hid it is hid to them that are
[29:41] lost
[29:43] and and now
[29:45] i was and i was when i was reading the
[29:46] second corinthians four it's just maybe
[29:48] a beautiful passage that i hated to chop
[29:50] out but if our gospel be hid and we know
[29:52] what the gospel is it's the power of god
[29:54] we know what paul said about the gospel
[29:55] and it is christ
[29:57] he's saying if it be hid
[29:59] it is hid
[30:01] to them that are lost in other words if
[30:04] it can't be seen it's not seen by those
[30:06] that are lost so it's not that the
[30:07] gospel is hid from them but the lost are
[30:10] veiled to not see the light
[30:13] the lost are veiled to not be able to
[30:15] see it or to recognize it so it's not it
[30:17] doesn't create this this idea
[30:20] that um are you lost oh well in that
[30:23] case
[30:24] i'm gonna hide we're gonna hide the
[30:26] gospel from those that we think are lost
[30:29] because what what is our calculation
[30:31] this could get real this will escalate
[30:33] quickly what is our calculation about
[30:35] whether or not we want to share the
[30:36] gospel with somebody
[30:38] whether or not we think they're an
[30:40] appropriate candidate
[30:42] we begin to judge and evaluate we and we
[30:44] kind of look even sometimes people we've
[30:46] known for a long time and we think oh
[30:47] well they're just serpentine
[30:49] right
[30:50] we should never say that
[30:52] but we have this idea oh we're there
[30:54] just serpentine
[30:55] and and and we and we use that
[30:57] calculation so once we've made that
[30:59] assessment what would we do
[31:01] when you when you believe something i'm
[31:02] glad there's an empty chair in the front
[31:04] row we believe that this person's
[31:05] serpent seed so you know what you're
[31:07] going to do well i don't cast my pearls
[31:09] before swine
[31:10] and we're going to hide the gospel from
[31:12] them right
[31:13] and that's not what the scripture is
[31:14] saying the scripture is not saying if
[31:17] paul's not saying well if i hide my
[31:18] gospel
[31:20] i hide it from those make-believers
[31:24] he's not saying i hide it from the
[31:25] unbeliever he's not saying he hides the
[31:27] gospel at all he's just saying i preach
[31:29] the gospel openly and if someone can't
[31:31] see it they can't see it because they're
[31:32] veiled from it
[31:34] it's actually expressing a grace in it
[31:37] right the gospel is availed to to their
[31:40] veiled in such a way to where they
[31:41] cannot see the light
[31:44] now is because this is in second
[31:46] corinthians chapter three verses two to
[31:48] three
[31:50] second corinthians chapter three verses
[31:51] two to three says ye are our epistle
[31:54] written in our hearts now if you could
[31:55] kind of catch this image we've used this
[31:57] already
[31:58] uh recently
[32:00] that paul has something written in his
[32:02] heart
[32:03] but he says known and read of all men
[32:06] so paul says you are our epistle that
[32:08] was within our hearts this burden this
[32:10] secret uh prayer the secret uh uh
[32:15] pouring out of his soul and this
[32:17] vision and this belief that he has even
[32:19] in them he says my my gospel you are my
[32:23] gospel that's written in my heart but
[32:24] it's not just in my heart anymore you
[32:27] were known and read of all men
[32:30] how is it known and read of all men the
[32:32] gospel in his heart is then read by the
[32:34] corinthians read by the corinthians
[32:36] interpret interpreted received and then
[32:38] they live it and he says though this is
[32:40] something that was a mystery in my heart
[32:42] and read in my and written in my heart
[32:44] you now becoming a partaker of this
[32:46] epistle are known in red of all you make
[32:49] it known the mystery known and read of
[32:51] all men but it doesn't mean people
[32:53] saying oh the mystery of paul in this
[32:54] beautiful
[32:57] people don't look at us as message
[32:58] believers and say wow okay well this is
[33:00] the interpretation of the message isn't
[33:01] this beautiful
[33:02] you're a mystery to them
[33:04] because they look at the message and
[33:06] they look at you and they can't quite
[33:07] reconcile what are they why can't they
[33:09] be like us
[33:11] why can't they reject it why can't they
[33:12] walk away from it why can't they
[33:14] belittle it why can't they water it down
[33:16] and there's a wrestling that takes place
[33:18] and so it's not like they look at us and
[33:19] go well i mean just look at this brother
[33:21] he's actually the epistle the
[33:23] representation of the bible the
[33:24] representation of the message the
[33:26] representation in scripture known and
[33:27] read of all men they may not make the
[33:29] calculation
[33:31] even but but you are it
[33:35] says for as much as you are manifestly
[33:37] declared to be the epistle of christ
[33:39] ministered by us you are manifestly
[33:42] declared or manifestly declaring the
[33:45] epistle of christ which was ministered
[33:47] by paul paul could preach a sermon in a
[33:49] house he can express something he could
[33:51] share something that's to the audience
[33:53] that is present but now he's saying you
[33:55] become the epistle of christ manifestly
[33:58] declared
[33:59] written not with ink but with the spirit
[34:01] of living god in the believer in the
[34:03] individual not in tables of stone but in
[34:05] fleshly tables of the heart
[34:07] and where are these fleshly tables of
[34:09] the heart they're in that ark of the
[34:11] covenant
[34:13] because that's where the the witness and
[34:15] the testimony was placed in the old
[34:16] testament
[34:18] so this is the inner witness
[34:20] and the communion that translates into a
[34:22] public life
[34:25] and first thessalonians chapter one
[34:26] verse eight we may take time to go back
[34:28] over some of these things because it's
[34:29] very
[34:30] very rich and very full
[34:33] for from you sounded out the word of the
[34:35] lord
[34:36] not just paul
[34:38] paul didn't take the attitude as the
[34:40] messenger to that age that i'm the only
[34:41] one allowed to speak
[34:43] but he's saying from you sounded out the
[34:45] word of the lord not only in macedonia
[34:46] nikaya but also in every place your
[34:49] faith to god word is spread abroad so
[34:52] that we need not to speak anything
[34:56] this is the process of a believer
[34:58] hearing the word
[35:00] in the spirit of god taking and
[35:02] internalizing in the believer's heart
[35:04] them having this communion in behind the
[35:06] veil and then they are able to go and
[35:08] says from you sounded out the word from
[35:11] you it echoed from you sound out it
[35:13] means it echoed so there's a witness on
[35:15] the inside and the word is spoke within
[35:18] that throne room of a believer's heart
[35:20] but then it sounds out and echoes back
[35:22] out you are arranged spiritually
[35:25] acoustically in a spiritual way so that
[35:27] when god speaks the word this is a
[35:29] wonderful when god speaks the word into
[35:32] your soul you are designed acoustically
[35:35] to be able to sound it back out you are
[35:38] god's spiritual amphitheater that he can
[35:40] be there on the stage of your heart be
[35:43] yet the audience can hear
[35:45] why because he's designed you that way
[35:49] he's there in the center of the whole
[35:51] holy place within your soul and then he
[35:54] speaks and the whole world will hear
[35:57] because it echoes from you
[36:00] think about the language that's being
[36:01] used
[36:02] sounded out the word of the lord spread
[36:04] abroad and paul even has enough humility
[36:06] to say that because so i don't even need
[36:08] to be the one speaking
[36:10] because you took the message of the hour
[36:13] you took the word of god and you're
[36:15] sounding it out
[36:16] it's echoing
[36:21] in mark chapter 15 i wanted to get maybe
[36:23] into more details on this
[36:26] but
[36:28] i just want to read the one because
[36:29] the the
[36:31] the
[36:32] following verses speak to
[36:35] a public ministry
[36:38] but in the great commission a commission
[36:40] is authority entrusted to someone a
[36:43] commission is delegated authority or
[36:45] power
[36:46] so this is the great commission this is
[36:48] where god is delegating christ is
[36:50] delegating authority to the believer
[36:51] christ is giving taking authority and
[36:54] entrusting it to someone else
[36:56] jesus could say i will go into all the
[36:58] world and i will speak and i will raise
[37:00] the dead and i'll heal the sick and i'll
[37:02] do all those things but he said i'm
[37:04] trusting you with this power
[37:06] i'm entrusting you with this authority
[37:08] and he says go ye into all the world and
[37:10] preach the gospel to every creature
[37:13] go ye into all the world and preach the
[37:16] gospel to every creature we are to be
[37:19] sent into the world with for the purpose
[37:21] of manifestly declaring the word of god
[37:25] the believer is to broadcast the
[37:27] believers to spread abroad the believer
[37:30] is to sound out the word of god amen
[37:34] now this is where i want to pause just
[37:35] for a moment
[37:36] and just say stop
[37:38] if there's a place you went before in
[37:40] your mind when you thought of the great
[37:41] commission if there was a place you went
[37:42] before in your mind when you begin to
[37:44] think about sounding out the word of god
[37:46] and being a witness and
[37:48] and what those things mean i'm not
[37:50] asking you to do away with it but just
[37:51] pause
[37:52] and begin to rethink it
[37:55] not saying it's going to be any what
[37:56] we're going to share is going to be any
[37:57] different
[37:58] but i want you to rethink maybe just
[38:00] give the holy spirit a chance to
[38:03] uh more fully develop our concept of the
[38:06] great commission
[38:08] because this commission
[38:11] it's not just the delegating of
[38:12] authority and the giving out
[38:14] of gifts and opportunities to do things
[38:18] and so we can just you know have fun
[38:19] with it
[38:20] and enjoy it
[38:22] god's very intentional
[38:25] there was an intent behind this
[38:29] and let me say as
[38:31] this might be a hard turn so just
[38:33] lean into it
[38:35] with so many causes in the world today
[38:40] in so many
[38:42] claims of certain things
[38:45] and i will say this uh so many
[38:47] conspiracies
[38:49] so many things on the horizon so many
[38:50] interpretations of the events that have
[38:52] transpired and taking place so many and
[38:54] i think the word cause is what really
[38:57] uh uh anchors to me when i identify as
[39:00] so many things causes or goals or
[39:02] ambitions and things people want to
[39:04] achieve or ideas that people want others
[39:06] to accept and the actions that would
[39:09] then be necessitated required by that
[39:11] there's so many of these things in the
[39:12] world today
[39:14] and and events transpire to where we go
[39:17] back
[39:18] we've all had the thought man i wish in
[39:20] 2019 i had started an etsy shop for
[39:23] masks
[39:24] right
[39:25] i i wish that i had just somehow had a
[39:28] premonition in 2018 i just want to start
[39:31] making a lot of masks and and buying up
[39:33] surgical masks and what are you doing it
[39:35] for
[39:35] i don't know you just never know
[39:38] right because who knew that these things
[39:40] would become a part of our lives
[39:43] who knew all these different things that
[39:44] we began to buy i think it was we were
[39:46] traveling i asked um you know
[39:49] the uh
[39:50] i was just clarifying because i wasn't
[39:52] that what do we need to take out liquids
[39:54] because they have different equipment if
[39:55] you're uh tsa precheck there's different
[39:57] rules and every airport's different and
[39:59] sometimes even one lane is different
[40:01] than the next lane in an airport
[40:04] talk about causes we should write a
[40:06] letter to the tsa
[40:08] because it's very confusing and the the
[40:10] guy said yeah you have to take your
[40:11] liquids out but any size hand sanitizer
[40:13] will be fine i thought
[40:15] i'm sure macgyver would figure out a way
[40:17] to blow up a 737 with hand sanitizer
[40:20] and any amounts fine
[40:22] bring it guys
[40:24] excuse this five gallon barrel of hand
[40:27] sanitizer
[40:29] that i bought a ticket for so it can fly
[40:31] in the middle seat they didn't have a
[40:33] problem with it but who would have
[40:34] thought that you would need to travel
[40:36] with you know five gallons of a hand
[40:38] sanitizer and and have masks and all
[40:40] these things that are now
[40:42] a part of our thought process in our
[40:43] prior life there i'm referring to it to
[40:46] make this point there's things that can
[40:47] all of a sudden come up and intervene
[40:50] where now you're having to make
[40:51] considerations for things you have to
[40:52] accommodate certain things and you're
[40:54] being required to do different things
[40:56] that we never had to worry about before
[40:59] could you imagine um let's just time
[41:02] travel back to the civil war and
[41:04] and someone uh you know someone says
[41:06] they think you know i don't know what's
[41:08] going on i feel like something's wrong
[41:09] with my heart and says well would you be
[41:10] you know what do you think about a heart
[41:12] transplant
[41:14] and you couldn't discuss the morals and
[41:16] the ethics of receiving somebody else's
[41:17] heart back then because it's like it
[41:19] ain't happening
[41:21] but nowadays a believer could actually
[41:23] have a moral quandary about whether or
[41:24] not they would take a heart transplant
[41:28] right
[41:30] and these are things that we now have to
[41:31] consider and things that we have to
[41:33] ponder because of how things trans uh
[41:36] move along and transpire and so we live
[41:38] in a time when there's so many claims so
[41:41] many causes so many things that need
[41:43] some sort of acknowledgement or
[41:44] affirmation what do we advocate for
[41:47] we're forced to make a decision and
[41:49] you've got you better change your avatar
[41:51] you better wear this shirt at work you
[41:52] better do this you better do that
[41:54] bill abraham said there are so many
[41:56] voices in the world so many problems and
[41:59] needs crying for attention
[42:02] it really resonated with me so many
[42:04] voices in the world so many problems and
[42:06] so many needs crying for attention this
[42:08] needs attention this needs attention
[42:10] this needs a decision this needs a side
[42:13] this needs an argument this needs an
[42:15] opinion this needs support
[42:19] with all of that what do we advocate for
[42:22] i want you to rethink your concept of
[42:24] the great commission rethink the concept
[42:26] of ministry and sharing the gospel
[42:29] and it's sounding out
[42:32] we know the statement the bride will be
[42:34] and i'm just paraphrasing the bride will
[42:36] be the final voice to the final age
[42:39] raise your hand if you've heard that
[42:40] before
[42:42] good almost unanimous the bride will be
[42:44] the final voice to the final age but
[42:47] have we ever really thought about what
[42:48] her voice will be
[42:50] i mean it's a really
[42:51] it's really a such a profound statement
[42:54] in the church age book
[42:55] and it elicits a great reaction from the
[42:58] bride
[43:00] because it's really full of so much
[43:02] energy it's full of so much inspiration
[43:04] and it's it's a very profound statement
[43:07] and we'll come to it here in a moment
[43:08] that the bride under her messenger she
[43:10] just as paul said the word is sounding
[43:12] out from you and you're my epistle known
[43:14] and read of all men that this ministry
[43:16] at the end time of brother branham he's
[43:18] delivered his message and now he's
[43:20] saying that the bride under her
[43:21] messenger she's actually going to be the
[43:23] voice of god in the last days
[43:25] it's going to be
[43:26] great is the company that publishes this
[43:29] gospel and it's actually the elect of
[43:31] god it's the bride of god the final
[43:32] voice is in the bride and listen you can
[43:35] use that statement at a convention in
[43:36] africa and they'll come and pick you up
[43:38] on their shoulders and march you around
[43:40] the tabernacle
[43:42] hey put me down put me down they love it
[43:44] but if we ever have we ever stop for a
[43:46] moment to think about what is her voice
[43:48] what will it sound like
[43:50] what is the final voice
[43:53] let me say this way and you say oh
[43:55] that's very convenient brother aaron it
[43:56] fits your title
[43:58] the final voice is the bride's advocacy
[44:01] the final voice to the final age is the
[44:03] final advocacy the final the bride's
[44:06] advocacy is is
[44:08] summed up in the phrase the final voice
[44:10] to the final age
[44:12] advocacy comes from ad which is two
[44:15] and vaca c or vocacy which is comes from
[44:18] the root vox
[44:20] which means voice think about that
[44:23] advocate it comes from to voice
[44:28] to advocate is to add a voice of support
[44:31] to a cause or to it for a person
[44:33] that's what it means to advocate for it
[44:35] you you can't advocate without a voice
[44:39] that's why advocacy is not it's not in
[44:42] the sense of taking a poll in a survey
[44:44] and saying are are you for changing the
[44:46] locks on the church we just we need we
[44:48] need to we need you to check the box no
[44:51] advocating for changing the locks on the
[44:53] church is going around saying i think it
[44:54] would be best if we change the lock to
[44:55] the church and i really think we should
[44:57] paint the baptismal this way and it's
[44:58] going out supporting advocating giving a
[45:01] voice to
[45:02] it's not just having an opinion deep
[45:04] buried within the recesses of your mind
[45:06] to advocate is to add a voice to support
[45:08] to advocate is to add a voice to a cause
[45:12] and even the word voice and this is
[45:14] where i'm really relying upon uh you to
[45:17] think uh not necessarily abstractly but
[45:19] to understand voice when you think of a
[45:21] voice of something it's a medium or an
[45:24] agency of expression
[45:26] like you may have a publication that
[45:28] serves a particular group and what does
[45:30] it become it's a newsletter which is
[45:32] advocating for that group's cause and it
[45:34] could be called the voice of the the law
[45:37] changers
[45:39] i don't know why that came in my mind we
[45:40] don't even have our own building
[45:43] meanwhile someone from the hilton's
[45:44] walked by they're thinking about
[45:46] changing the locks they've been here too
[45:48] long
[45:50] but it's too it's a medium or an agency
[45:52] of expression so you can have something
[45:55] that serves
[45:56] a movement serves as the voice of a
[45:59] movement serves as a one to give to give
[46:01] the uh the cause and to promote its
[46:04] interest
[46:05] to to have a voice in something is to
[46:07] have a right or an opportunity to
[46:10] express a choice or an opinion haven't
[46:12] we said that before decisions being
[46:13] amazing well i didn't have a voice in
[46:14] that
[46:15] or there's this these forms that allow
[46:17] for people to give a voice and we want
[46:19] to hear from the community and so when
[46:21] you have a voice you have the right you
[46:22] may not have the right to make the
[46:24] decision but you have the right or the
[46:25] opportunity to express your choice or to
[46:27] express your opinion
[46:30] and so herein lies the ad the
[46:32] responsibility of advocacy that there
[46:34] you you must promote to to have an
[46:37] advocacy you must promote the cause of
[46:39] another to be an advocate you must be
[46:41] supporting listen the cause of another
[46:45] that's what advocacy is
[46:47] when you
[46:50] i love the banjo i really do now if you
[46:52] could just get a little bit of mandolin
[46:54] going behind that
[46:57] we have a responsibility as an advocate
[47:00] to promote the cause of another this is
[47:03] what an advocate is they promote that
[47:05] their voice for something they're
[47:06] representing someone else listen when we
[47:08] read when we understand what advocacy is
[47:11] and what an advocate is you recognize
[47:13] and realize that we don't have our own
[47:15] agenda
[47:18] we don't have our own uh
[47:21] goal and our own image we're not
[47:22] building our own reputation we're not
[47:25] building our own cause so that we don't
[47:26] give voice and support something that's
[47:28] going to benefit us we realize that if
[47:30] we are advocates then we're supporting
[47:32] the interest of someone else if we're
[47:34] advocates and we're advocating and we
[47:36] have an advocacy it's not so that we
[47:38] look good and so that we're better off
[47:40] it's so that somebody else's interests
[47:43] are promoted
[47:46] i was thinking about creeds and dogmas
[47:48] and theologies and ideas and claims and
[47:50] causes and we know brother graham said
[47:52] over and over again many different
[47:54] places we have no law but love and he
[47:56] was born this from somebody else but he
[47:57] gave it his approval we have no law but
[48:00] love no creed but christ no book book of
[48:02] the bible
[48:04] now i want to i want you to think about
[48:05] this let's not say this about a church
[48:07] let's not say this about branham
[48:09] tabernacle let's not say this about
[48:10] arizona believers church or tucson
[48:12] tabernacle or another church we have no
[48:14] law but love is a christian
[48:16] we have no creed but christ as a
[48:18] christian we have no book but the bible
[48:21] as a christian
[48:23] this is taking a phrase and i want to
[48:25] get legalistic with it i'm sure there's
[48:27] a way that we could
[48:29] we could begin to
[48:30] kind of thresh it out a little bit where
[48:32] we realize well this is a statement this
[48:33] is a phrase that's meant to convey
[48:37] that we don't have a bunch of things
[48:38] that we believe this and we believe that
[48:40] and we have all these different things
[48:41] that we're fighting for and these other
[48:43] things we're promoting it's it's
[48:44] becoming laser-focused as a christian
[48:46] saying my creed is christ
[48:49] now that assumes a lot
[48:51] in reality if christ is our creed
[48:54] there's a whole
[48:56] book of creeds
[48:58] right
[48:59] if we have no law but love and god is
[49:01] love then there's a law there's a
[49:03] restraint there's a force there's an
[49:05] effect associated with god that's a very
[49:07] broad law
[49:09] if we have no book but the bible there's
[49:12] a lot in this book
[49:14] so it's not used just to limit it down
[49:16] to a cliche where we have uh you know
[49:18] god said it or god thought it brother
[49:20] brown spoke it i believe it that settles
[49:22] it to try to just button it up all neat
[49:24] and cute and simple and there it is i'm
[49:26] a believer
[49:28] well if you really want to say it god
[49:29] thought it brother man spoke it you
[49:31] believe it that settles it well there's
[49:33] a lot there
[49:34] let's diagram that sentence
[49:36] let's get behind what it means god
[49:38] thought it let's get behind what did
[49:39] what did he think and what was spoken
[49:41] what does it really mean to believe it
[49:44] and wherein is in those three things
[49:46] what is settled in that so there's a lot
[49:48] here we have no law but love no creed
[49:50] but christ no book but the bible there's
[49:52] a lot that's meant behind these phrases
[49:54] that we use and things that are very
[49:55] personal and dear to us nothing against
[49:57] them
[49:58] and i because i'm actually using it to
[50:00] get get us to stop for a moment what is
[50:02] it that we voice our support for
[50:06] and how does it fit within that
[50:09] i'm i i feel like i'm running out of
[50:11] time
[50:13] and so let me just pause for a moment to
[50:15] consider
[50:16] whether or not i want to read this very
[50:18] lengthy quote
[50:21] um
[50:22] for uh
[50:23] to you to before we close and this is
[50:25] your opportunity to say preach brother
[50:26] go on go on take your time
[50:29] yeah that's the cue there that's i mean
[50:31] i have it written here cue the people
[50:32] prime the people to say keep preaching
[50:35] and uh we need to work on that
[50:42] we're going to read through this and i
[50:43] don't want to get
[50:46] caught in some of these things i just
[50:48] want you to recognize brother brown's
[50:49] train of thought as he writes in chapter
[50:50] 9 of the church age book
[50:52] the baptists have their creeds and
[50:54] dogmas based on the word and you can't
[50:57] shake them
[50:59] so creeds but notice their creeds their
[51:02] dogmas based on the word and you can't
[51:05] shake them notice their creed isn't the
[51:08] word their dogma isn't the word because
[51:10] if it was then you shouldn't be shaken
[51:12] but they based their creeds their
[51:14] interpretation their dogma on the word
[51:16] they say the apostolic days of miracles
[51:18] are over and there is no baptism with
[51:20] the holy ghost subsequent to believing
[51:21] or after believing being sealed with the
[51:23] holy ghost the methodists say based on
[51:25] the word again based on the word there
[51:27] is no water baptism sprinkling is not
[51:29] baptism and that sanctification is the
[51:31] baptism with the holy ghost the church
[51:34] of christ majors in regenerational
[51:36] baptism and in all too many cases they
[51:38] go down dry centers and come up wet ones
[51:41] yet they claim their doctrine is word
[51:43] based
[51:44] what is he identifying all these
[51:46] movements
[51:48] that have based something on the word
[51:51] and they use the word as their
[51:52] justification god says this and the
[51:54] bible says that and they have these
[51:55] things they're vocalizing and very
[51:57] supportive of in drawing lines and
[51:59] casting down this and supporting this
[52:01] and advocating for this all based on
[52:03] their interpretation of the word but
[52:05] what have they done they've left the
[52:06] word
[52:08] and they're and they're advocating for
[52:09] things that are contrary to the word
[52:11] yet they claim their doctrine is word
[52:12] based go right down the line and come to
[52:14] the pentecostals do they have the word
[52:16] give them the word test and see this is
[52:19] a really good zinger they will sell out
[52:21] the word for sensation for a sensation
[52:23] just about every time
[52:26] wow they will sell out the word for
[52:28] sensation just about every time if you
[52:30] can produce a manifestation like oil and
[52:32] blood and tongues and other signs
[52:34] whether in the word or not or whether
[52:36] properly interpreted from the word the
[52:38] majority will fall for it
[52:40] but what has happened to the word the
[52:42] word has been put aside so god says i'm
[52:44] going against you all i will spew you
[52:47] out of my mouth this is the judgment of
[52:49] laodicea lukewarm cold and formal they
[52:51] have a lot of movements a lot of causes
[52:53] a lot of fervency a lot of ambition a
[52:55] lot of passion a lot of power a lot of
[52:57] force a lot of weight a lot of
[52:58] enthusiasm
[53:00] but they're lukewarm in god's eyes
[53:03] he says i'ma cast you aside i'm a spirit
[53:04] of mouth this is the end
[53:07] for seven out of seven ages i've seen
[53:09] nothing but men esteeming their own word
[53:11] above mind so at the end of this age i'm
[53:14] spewing you out of my mouth it is all
[53:17] over
[53:18] i don't know where we added this this is
[53:19] good it is all over
[53:21] but is the speaking over
[53:24] he says i'm going to speak all right
[53:27] yes i'm here in the midst of the church
[53:29] the amen of god faithful and true will
[53:32] reveal himself and it will be by my
[53:34] prophet oh yes that is so
[53:36] i like his writing style
[53:39] revelation 10 7 in the days of the voice
[53:42] think about voice a little bit
[53:43] differently now
[53:45] of the sabbath messenger when he shall
[53:47] begin to sound the mystery of god should
[53:49] be finished as if declared to his
[53:50] servants the prophets there it is he is
[53:53] sending a vindicated prophet he ascended
[53:55] a prophet after almost two thousand
[53:57] years he is sending someone who is
[53:59] notice so far from organization
[54:01] education and the world of religion that
[54:04] is john the baptist and elijah of old he
[54:06] will hear only from god and he will have
[54:08] thus saith the lord and speak for god
[54:11] far from organization and education
[54:14] he will be god's mouthpiece
[54:16] and he as it is declared in malachi 4 6
[54:19] this is his all caps so he's shouting at
[54:22] us a little bit will turn the hearts of
[54:24] the children back to the fathers
[54:26] he will bring back the elect of the last
[54:30] day and they will hear a vindicated
[54:32] prophet give the exact truth as it was
[54:34] with paul he will restore the truth as
[54:37] they had it now what happened in paul's
[54:38] day when he gave them the truth you are
[54:40] my epistle written in my hearts known
[54:42] and read of all men you are manifestly
[54:44] declared to be the epistle of christ
[54:46] which i've ministered so paul ministered
[54:48] christ they received it they manifestly
[54:50] declared it he had the vision and the
[54:52] burden in his heart they became it known
[54:54] and read of all men he says out of you
[54:56] sounded the word of god into macedonian
[54:58] acai and all these different places so
[55:00] that i don't even have to go there and
[55:02] be the one speaking because by you
[55:04] living it you are in fact sounding out
[55:06] my voice and the message i received
[55:08] because i got it from god anyways
[55:11] i was only echoing i was a means of echo
[55:13] now from you it's echoing outside why
[55:15] because it's reverberating resounding
[55:16] within your soul
[55:18] and those elect with him in that day
[55:21] will be the ones who truly manifest the
[55:23] lord and be his body and be his voice
[55:26] and perform his works it's a capital h
[55:29] is his voice and perform his works
[55:34] hallelujah do you see it
[55:36] a momentary consideration of church
[55:38] history will prove how accurate this
[55:40] thought is in the dark ages the word was
[55:42] almost entirely lost to the people but
[55:44] god sent luther with the word the
[55:46] lutheran spoke for god at that time but
[55:48] they organized and again the pure word
[55:50] was lost for organization tends towards
[55:53] dogmas and creeds and not simple word
[55:56] there's a tendency there's a weakness
[55:58] they could no longer speak for god then
[56:01] god sent wesley he was the voice with
[56:03] the word in his day the people who took
[56:05] his revelation from god became the
[56:07] living epistles read
[56:09] and known of all men for their
[56:11] generation
[56:12] notice when the methodist failed
[56:15] so you see the true nature of it but
[56:17] then there's a failure of it god raised
[56:19] up others and so has it gone on through
[56:21] the years until this last day there is
[56:24] again
[56:25] another people in the land
[56:28] who under their messenger will be
[56:30] the final voice to the final age
[56:33] recognize that there is not going to be
[56:36] another cycle
[56:37] where the messenger comes and gives the
[56:40] word and then the people are going to
[56:41] sound it out and then they fail
[56:44] and you need another one to come this is
[56:46] the last time it happens
[56:50] there is a message that has been brought
[56:52] there is a people who have received that
[56:54] message and they become the ones who are
[56:56] the final voice to the final age what
[56:59] that tells me is there will be a people
[57:01] that will sustain the voice and that
[57:03] will fulfill the commission and it will
[57:05] not fail and there will not need to be
[57:07] another messenger another prophet
[57:10] another cycle
[57:13] yes sir
[57:15] the church
[57:17] is no longer the mouthpiece of god
[57:20] what is it
[57:22] it is its own mouthpiece
[57:25] the church
[57:26] is no longer the mouthpiece of god
[57:29] it is its own mouthpiece
[57:31] should a church ever be its own
[57:33] mouthpiece
[57:35] any church
[57:38] but he says the church is not the
[57:40] mouthpiece of god that means one who
[57:42] speaks on behalf of another
[57:44] a mouthpiece is one who speaks for
[57:46] somebody else a mouthpiece is not one
[57:48] who promotes their own interest promotes
[57:50] their own ideas their creeds and their
[57:52] dogmas it's not hearing the word of god
[57:55] and then basing your idea off the word
[57:57] of god and then now advocating
[57:59] supporting and lifting up your
[58:00] interpretation and your agenda and your
[58:02] idea that is your being your own
[58:04] mouthpiece that is being your own
[58:06] advocate it's changing even the nature
[58:08] of the definition an advocate promotes
[58:10] somebody else's interest did not jesus
[58:13] say he will not speak of himself or he's
[58:15] not just trying to promote his own
[58:16] interests he's not just trying to become
[58:18] you know this uh
[58:20] an object to be worshiped but the very
[58:22] ministry of the holy ghost is one that
[58:24] promotes the interest of christ for your
[58:27] benefit and your interest as a son or
[58:30] daughter of god do you recognize how
[58:32] that advocacy and to advocate for
[58:34] something cannot be your own personal
[58:36] agenda it's gonna be on behalf of
[58:38] somebody else and when the methodists
[58:40] began be became more worried about how
[58:43] they looked and their church services
[58:45] and the growth of their organization
[58:47] they were no longer speaking on behalf
[58:48] of the body of christ they were speaking
[58:50] on the behalf of their church and they
[58:52] no longer were god's mouthpiece
[58:55] same with luther same with pentecost
[58:58] but
[58:58] there's a people in the land today
[59:02] another people in the land that people
[59:04] that i am standing before this morning
[59:06] who under their messenger are the final
[59:07] voice to the final age
[59:10] what is the final voice
[59:12] the final voice is our advocacy
[59:16] our role in responsibility the final
[59:18] voice is our role in our responsibility
[59:20] as an advocate
[59:23] and i don't want to be cliche
[59:25] i want you to think deeply about it
[59:28] think deeply rethink as we said before
[59:30] this ministry because god is very
[59:32] intentionless concept of the great
[59:33] commission
[59:36] as we close there now in just a couple
[59:38] of few more scriptures i'd like to read
[59:40] to you but may they might just kind of
[59:41] be rapid fire
[59:44] we've been just about it we've just been
[59:45] right at an hour now i think in terms of
[59:47] our preaching
[59:49] what is your advocacy i can ask you
[59:51] personally
[59:53] if we followed you on instagram
[59:57] if we
[59:58] knew what your
[59:59] username was on pinterest
[1:00:03] if we observed your website whatsapp
[1:00:04] status
[1:00:06] i'm not trying to make you all get
[1:00:08] uncomfortable
[1:00:09] i'm just asking what do we advocate for
[1:00:12] what are we promoting
[1:00:15] what are we recommending
[1:00:17] i'm fairly confident that the people
[1:00:19] here know that i like ritos
[1:00:23] right
[1:00:24] because i mention them
[1:00:26] and people might think that i have a
[1:00:28] contract with ritos
[1:00:30] that i'm an evangelist for ritos i
[1:00:31] advocate for why because i voice it i
[1:00:33] say something about it i mention it
[1:00:35] what is it you do when you like a
[1:00:37] restaurant and you really really like it
[1:00:39] you take your friends there
[1:00:41] you recommend you tell others about it
[1:00:42] people know oh well brother so-and-so
[1:00:44] really likes this because he recommends
[1:00:46] it well what kind of you know what i'm
[1:00:48] thinking about buying a pair of shoes uh
[1:00:50] what do you recommend and when somebody
[1:00:52] you can always tell when somebody's like
[1:00:54] i'm so glad you asked i thought you
[1:00:56] would never ask
[1:00:59] come here let me let me show you and
[1:01:02] you're like uh never mind i'll just
[1:01:04] google it
[1:01:06] just go to wirecutter.com i'll figure it
[1:01:08] out you know just use amazon reviews
[1:01:12] they're because they'd be very
[1:01:13] passionate about telling you about it
[1:01:14] and sharing with you and letting you
[1:01:16] know so i'm asked what are we promoting
[1:01:17] what are we recommending what are we
[1:01:19] actively supporting
[1:01:21] listen christianity is not propaganda
[1:01:26] our advocating for something and our
[1:01:28] ministry and our commission and those
[1:01:30] things that relate to being a witness is
[1:01:32] not
[1:01:33] uh is not made up of
[1:01:35] should never become pers a personality
[1:01:37] cult
[1:01:39] christianity is not political activism
[1:01:45] wherein we can get sometimes
[1:01:47] engage in misguided advocacy
[1:01:50] in the same way that the baptists and
[1:01:52] the methodists and the lutherans based
[1:01:55] their creeds and their dogmas on the
[1:01:56] word but yet upon further inspection it
[1:01:59] wasn't the word
[1:02:02] i'd even say this as a means of caution
[1:02:05] we're not called to be apologetics
[1:02:07] paul said i'm set for the defense of the
[1:02:08] gospel apologia to where we feel like we
[1:02:11] as believers are
[1:02:12] are called to prove and defend what we
[1:02:16] believe
[1:02:17] that's not what christianity is called
[1:02:18] to that's not what the great commission
[1:02:19] is is giving the proof of something and
[1:02:22] giving the convincing argument or
[1:02:24] defending it
[1:02:25] that's not what our advocacy is
[1:02:28] but advocacy does have a goal
[1:02:31] advocate advocacy does have a special
[1:02:34] interest
[1:02:36] and it's not church promotion
[1:02:39] it's not a political propaganda
[1:02:43] as we look go back and look at the
[1:02:45] definition of advocacy it's adding a
[1:02:46] voice of support
[1:02:48] to a cause or person
[1:02:50] what person do we support
[1:02:53] what cause are we
[1:02:54] promoting
[1:02:56] there is again another people in the
[1:02:58] land who under their messenger will be
[1:03:00] the final voice to the final age
[1:03:03] in latin advocate comes from the stem
[1:03:06] advocare
[1:03:08] advocate advocate a-d-v-o-c-a-t
[1:03:11] comes from the stand advocare which is
[1:03:13] add vocare add v-o-c-a-r-e which means
[1:03:17] to call
[1:03:18] or to summon
[1:03:20] or to invite
[1:03:23] our advocacy is largely an invitation
[1:03:26] to know christ
[1:03:29] advocacy is a means of summoning and
[1:03:31] inviting and calling to someone
[1:03:34] immediately those of you who have been
[1:03:35] able to follow me in this thought and i
[1:03:37] know i may be using something that's a
[1:03:38] little bit different the words of it
[1:03:40] advocacy and i'm trying to draw on
[1:03:42] something that may we may even be
[1:03:43] familiar with in a natural way and
[1:03:45] lifting up the advocacy of the holy
[1:03:47] spirit and now we're viewing ourselves
[1:03:49] in this role of being an advocate
[1:03:51] when we think of someone who advocates
[1:03:53] for something you're promoting the ideas
[1:03:56] and interest of something you're
[1:03:58] standing for you're recommending it
[1:04:00] you're calling it out and in some ways
[1:04:01] what you're doing is you're saying hey i
[1:04:03] they they this company offers a great
[1:04:05] product i'm a developer i'm a designer i
[1:04:08] do something on this platform and when
[1:04:10] you become an evangelist for it or
[1:04:12] advocate for it then you're one that
[1:04:14] goes out and you want to get other
[1:04:15] people to join in and and be a part of
[1:04:18] and accept and assimilate into or adopt
[1:04:20] a certain way of thinking and viewing
[1:04:22] and believing and when we become
[1:04:24] advocates when we are the final voice to
[1:04:27] the final age what that means is we are
[1:04:30] now the final summons
[1:04:32] the final invitation the final voice to
[1:04:35] the final age isn't going serpent seed
[1:04:37] serpent seed serpent seed serpent seed
[1:04:38] serpent seed that's not what the final
[1:04:40] voice is the final voice to the final
[1:04:42] age is the last advocate
[1:04:45] the last advocacy for truth the last
[1:04:48] advocacy for righteousness the last
[1:04:50] invitation to righteousness to truth to
[1:04:53] holiness to healing to life to happiness
[1:04:57] to joy before the tribulation sets in oh
[1:05:00] my can you see what you're called to do
[1:05:03] in this hour
[1:05:05] it's not to promote a church to promote
[1:05:07] a ministry to promote a man to promote a
[1:05:08] personality it's an invitation to christ
[1:05:13] it's a summons to the blessings of the
[1:05:15] word
[1:05:17] i would desire that anyone
[1:05:19] could have an opportunity anyone could
[1:05:22] have an opportunity
[1:05:23] to partake in one of our services and
[1:05:25] receive a blessing
[1:05:27] whether it be healing whether it be
[1:05:28] deliverance from oppression whether it
[1:05:29] be an enlightenment a change of attitude
[1:05:32] i would that they could be invited to
[1:05:34] taste to see to feel to know christ to
[1:05:38] have an opportunity wouldn't it be
[1:05:40] wonderful if you knew that what you know
[1:05:42] to be truth and this blessed
[1:05:44] relationship you have with christ think
[1:05:46] of the peace that you have in him think
[1:05:48] of the great deliverance that you've
[1:05:49] experienced think of how he's always met
[1:05:51] you and your desperation and your need
[1:05:52] and provided everything for you for all
[1:05:54] these many years just think that someone
[1:05:57] could stand at the doorway of that
[1:05:59] opportunity
[1:06:02] what it's meant to you and that another
[1:06:03] could have a chance to come to that
[1:06:05] place that's what it means to advocate
[1:06:07] it means to call to summon and to invite
[1:06:13] in john chapter 4 we have used the
[1:06:15] scripture so many times as a church in
[1:06:17] one year
[1:06:19] where jesus meets the woman at the well
[1:06:22] disciples went in to the city to get
[1:06:24] some burritos
[1:06:25] jesus goes to the
[1:06:27] goes to the well
[1:06:29] because he had needs to go that way
[1:06:30] they're going to find a meal and he
[1:06:31] comes to a woman who's thirsty she comes
[1:06:33] to draw water we know the story her
[1:06:35] testimony her life
[1:06:37] her experience her background
[1:06:40] and what did jesus do
[1:06:42] he exposed something very personal
[1:06:46] it and i i can say this i don't know why
[1:06:48] i'm struggling with this mic i could
[1:06:49] blame it on the last person that person
[1:06:50] that wore it but i won't do that
[1:06:54] the uh
[1:06:57] her li her her sitting was very very
[1:07:00] public
[1:07:02] i mean i don't know how you could have
[1:07:03] five husbands and be living with another
[1:07:05] one without
[1:07:06] at least six people knowing about it
[1:07:09] um
[1:07:10] but this is i mean this is a very public
[1:07:13] sinful life
[1:07:15] but then just her all by herself
[1:07:18] she meets a man
[1:07:20] who through conversation just talking to
[1:07:22] her about water you know and bringing it
[1:07:23] just talking to her completely opens up
[1:07:26] something inside of her and the
[1:07:28] transformation that transpires at the
[1:07:29] well
[1:07:30] i mean we're given the dialogue of it
[1:07:32] but you have to recognize this is
[1:07:33] something so amazing that transpires
[1:07:37] and when this i am he
[1:07:40] he made himself known to her
[1:07:43] and then it says in john chapter 4
[1:07:45] verses 28 29 the woman then left her
[1:07:47] water pot went her way into the city and
[1:07:51] saith to the men
[1:07:53] this is this is what she said to the men
[1:07:55] now if you're turning your bibles in the
[1:07:57] law if you could get the scrolls out
[1:07:58] let's turn to deuteronomy 18.
[1:08:00] she didn't she didn't go there
[1:08:03] she didn't feel that she hadn't had to
[1:08:04] explain everything
[1:08:06] she didn't even have to give her life
[1:08:07] story and her testimony
[1:08:09] she comes and she goes her way after she
[1:08:12] left her water pot and this is what she
[1:08:14] says come see a man
[1:08:17] which told me all things that i ever did
[1:08:20] is not this the christ
[1:08:23] and so it's it's she when she says he
[1:08:25] told me all things that i ever did she
[1:08:28] has she is a personal witness of the
[1:08:30] power of the messiah she knows
[1:08:32] personally what he can do she knows that
[1:08:34] he has the power to break cycles to give
[1:08:37] deliverance to heal to expose and to
[1:08:39] bring sort of a deliverance and she
[1:08:41] doesn't go out and try to replicate what
[1:08:44] god did to her what christ did to her
[1:08:47] she goes out with the desire that
[1:08:49] somebody else
[1:08:51] that these men could have an audience
[1:08:53] and a personal opportunity with christ
[1:08:56] and she said come and see
[1:08:59] there was no self-promotion there was no
[1:09:01] agenda she had met the one she says come
[1:09:05] meet the one that i have met
[1:09:10] and the private meeting
[1:09:13] turned and turned her into a public
[1:09:14] witness
[1:09:16] and then what she began to advocate
[1:09:19] publicly
[1:09:20] was not a show
[1:09:22] but an invitation
[1:09:24] for everyone else
[1:09:26] to have a private meeting
[1:09:28] come and see
[1:09:30] for yourself
[1:09:31] make it personal
[1:09:33] in john chapter 1 verses 43 to 46 the
[1:09:35] day following jesus would go forth into
[1:09:37] galilee
[1:09:38] and findeth philip and saith unto him
[1:09:41] follow me
[1:09:43] now we don't say follow me
[1:09:45] but this is what jesus said to philip so
[1:09:48] now philip was from was of bethesda the
[1:09:50] city of andrew and peter now something's
[1:09:52] happened to philip his eyes have been
[1:09:54] opened philip findeth nathanael and
[1:09:56] saith unto him we have found him of whom
[1:09:57] moses and the law and the prophets did
[1:09:59] right jesus of nazareth the son of
[1:10:01] joseph
[1:10:02] and and so here you can say well here he
[1:10:04] is brother aaron he's he's he's going to
[1:10:06] deuteronomy he's telling them
[1:10:08] he's breaking it down but and nathanael
[1:10:10] said unto him can there any good thing
[1:10:12] come out of nazareth
[1:10:14] philip saith in him come and see
[1:10:17] that's advocacy
[1:10:20] the experience that was made available
[1:10:21] to philip was a personal literal
[1:10:24] physical walk with the messiah
[1:10:27] to be there by his
[1:10:28] side and philip did not want to advocate
[1:10:32] for mere knowledge of a present messiah
[1:10:35] he didn't want to just say he's here
[1:10:37] just take me at my word
[1:10:39] just believe me
[1:10:41] philip said come and see for yourself
[1:10:47] this is what it means to advocate
[1:10:51] it's a call it's a summon it's an
[1:10:52] invitation
[1:10:54] but the mike and brother law if you
[1:10:56] could come to your instruments
[1:10:58] i want to read revelations chapter 22
[1:11:00] verse 17
[1:11:01] in closing
[1:11:04] think of the very end of this book
[1:11:06] even the book of the bible
[1:11:15] so nearing the very end
[1:11:22] he says the spirit
[1:11:25] which is the advocate which is the
[1:11:27] comforter
[1:11:28] the spirit and the bride
[1:11:31] say come
[1:11:33] the spirit and the bride say come
[1:11:38] if advocate
[1:11:40] comes from advocare which means to
[1:11:42] summon to invite or to call
[1:11:45] the spirit and the bride
[1:11:47] advocate
[1:11:50] and says and let him that heareth
[1:11:52] say come
[1:11:54] there's it's not just
[1:11:56] someone who heard you say come
[1:11:59] but it's actually this dynamic of the
[1:12:01] spirit now working in the bride the
[1:12:02] bride under her messenger giving
[1:12:04] invitation and the one who hears is the
[1:12:06] one that becomes a part of that dynamic
[1:12:08] because the spirit and the bride said
[1:12:09] come and now one heard
[1:12:12] and now he's part of that dynamic now
[1:12:14] one with the spirit as the member of the
[1:12:16] bride saying come
[1:12:18] and who are we saying it to him that is
[1:12:20] thirsty come and whosoever will
[1:12:24] let them take the water of life freely
[1:12:26] and if it be hidden
[1:12:28] we've at least done our part
[1:12:31] we don't hide the well from them that
[1:12:33] are lost we don't hide the well from
[1:12:34] them that we do not think are worth it
[1:12:36] we do not even hide the grace of god
[1:12:38] from those that we have been offended by
[1:12:41] and deemed them unworthy of it
[1:12:45] because we're not advocating for
[1:12:46] ourselves
[1:12:49] think now think about this i just i
[1:12:51] pondered
[1:12:53] give much thought to
[1:12:57] uh
[1:12:58] how god would maybe bring it to
[1:13:02] be able to express what's in my heart on
[1:13:03] our advocacy
[1:13:07] and it really just
[1:13:11] in god inspiring the fact this
[1:13:13] foundational sermon to me that it made
[1:13:15] it really click because even when we
[1:13:17] preached on the advocate the very
[1:13:18] beginning i mentioned the bride's
[1:13:20] advocacy
[1:13:23] and it's just matured and gotten deeper
[1:13:24] and richer to where
[1:13:28] the less
[1:13:29] it really became the less the bride was
[1:13:31] part of it in a sense
[1:13:35] and
[1:13:36] in the less even others because in in
[1:13:38] one way so the bride's advocacy is oh
[1:13:39] well just look out look out after the
[1:13:41] sick and look out after the poor and and
[1:13:43] you realize no i'm not advocating for
[1:13:46] the poor
[1:13:47] but in my advocacy for christ
[1:13:52] i have a i have something to offer the
[1:13:54] poor
[1:13:56] in advocating for the cause of christ
[1:13:58] and advocating for truth and advocating
[1:14:00] for the righteousness
[1:14:02] i i can then summon and invite
[1:14:07] those that are needy those that are
[1:14:08] hurting those that are sick those that
[1:14:10] are wounded those that are sinful
[1:14:12] and so it's not that i'm i'm coddling
[1:14:14] the center and advocating for the center
[1:14:17] picking up the cause all these different
[1:14:18] causes and well if the bride's
[1:14:20] advocating then should she advocate for
[1:14:22] gay rights or should you advocate for
[1:14:24] the gold standard should she advocate
[1:14:26] you know for robin hood versus sophie i
[1:14:28] mean what what is it what is what we
[1:14:29] promote what what are we all in on game
[1:14:32] stock or or or amc which which one do we
[1:14:35] invest in over there just tell me
[1:14:37] but no we're we advocate for christ
[1:14:42] that's who we're advocating for and how
[1:14:44] it's so rich and so deep to me that i
[1:14:46] realize
[1:14:47] that it's not our own agenda that we're
[1:14:49] promoting
[1:14:51] and in the end it's we have a
[1:14:52] responsibility
[1:14:54] to advocate for christ
[1:14:58] and so i i asked this question i just
[1:15:00] shared all that maybe his background in
[1:15:01] my own heart as i've pondered this
[1:15:04] if your worst enemy the person who's
[1:15:06] done you the most harm
[1:15:08] and the greatest hurts
[1:15:11] if you were asked to give them an
[1:15:13] opportunity for
[1:15:15] the love of christ and the grace of god
[1:15:17] would you do it
[1:15:21] i'm not saying it would be
[1:15:22] easy but if you could challenge yourself
[1:15:24] with this notion that somebody who's
[1:15:26] harmed you blasphemed spoke against did
[1:15:29] all these nasty things whatever my
[1:15:31] horrible deep dark horrible things to
[1:15:33] you if you knew that they would have an
[1:15:35] opportunity give be given
[1:15:37] maybe you're not the one that needs to
[1:15:39] do it but you heard that they could have
[1:15:40] an opportunity to know christ
[1:15:44] what would you do
[1:15:46] and as you challenge yourself with that
[1:15:47] scenario it might help you kind of work
[1:15:49] out
[1:15:50] where the hang up is because you think
[1:15:52] well
[1:15:53] they don't deserve it
[1:15:56] well you're not advocating for him
[1:15:59] you're advocating for christ
[1:16:02] well they did me this isn't about you
[1:16:06] it's about christ
[1:16:08] and you begin to adjust
[1:16:10] everything begins to change
[1:16:13] and everything begins to be orientated
[1:16:15] in such a way true we can say wait a
[1:16:16] minute
[1:16:17] yes
[1:16:19] christ you that's
[1:16:21] that's the kind of person you would
[1:16:22] probably come to
[1:16:25] in your days on earth when you walked
[1:16:27] this earth
[1:16:28] we would have been saying hey come with
[1:16:30] us
[1:16:31] to the temple
[1:16:33] there's a meeting of pharisees and
[1:16:35] there's i mean i know that has a
[1:16:36] negative context maybe to us today but
[1:16:38] there's a meeting of scribes come speak
[1:16:39] to them
[1:16:41] the richest men the most powerful men
[1:16:43] the prestigious and these opportunities
[1:16:46] and jesus said you know what i need to
[1:16:48] go by samaria
[1:16:51] there's a woman there
[1:16:53] well tell us about her a woman oh is her
[1:16:56] is she married to a teacher
[1:16:59] she come from a royal family
[1:17:01] oh no she's she's been married five
[1:17:04] times and she's actually living with
[1:17:05] another man now well
[1:17:07] really
[1:17:11] got all these
[1:17:12] people that you could go to and spend
[1:17:14] time with and all these other ideas and
[1:17:16] agendas that you could get behind and
[1:17:18] you're gonna go to samaria and go out of
[1:17:19] your way for her
[1:17:24] i'm just asking you to consider
[1:17:28] how you would relate to that
[1:17:31] so you could ponder what we're
[1:17:32] advocating
[1:17:37] this sermon has just been the foundation
[1:17:39] of us examining
[1:17:42] our advocacy the beginning of us
[1:17:45] exploring our advocacy
[1:17:49] the spirit and the bride
[1:17:51] say come
[1:17:53] it's an invitation to summons
[1:17:55] what did jesus say we are we are salt
[1:17:59] we are light
[1:18:00] you could say i am salt
[1:18:03] i am light
[1:18:05] if you are salt
[1:18:07] and you are light if i am salt and i am
[1:18:09] light if we are the salt of the earth
[1:18:12] and the light of the world then as salt
[1:18:15] without a public ministry the world will
[1:18:16] never crave
[1:18:20] without light
[1:18:22] with our without our advocacy the world
[1:18:24] will never see him
[1:18:27] are you hearing me
[1:18:29] if you're the salt of the earth no one's
[1:18:31] ever going to crave for christ
[1:18:33] until you're salty
[1:18:35] no one's ever going to ask the question
[1:18:36] no one's ever going to know you are the
[1:18:39] seasoning
[1:18:42] think of yourself then as the grain of
[1:18:43] salt within your family
[1:18:46] a grain of salt at your school a grain
[1:18:48] of salt at work a grain of salt within
[1:18:49] your larger family a grain of salt
[1:18:51] within your community and you realize
[1:18:52] that i'm the point of contact that if
[1:18:55] that i have a role a responsibility that
[1:18:57] if i'm not if i don't have the right
[1:18:59] kind of public ministry
[1:19:01] flowing out of the right kind of private
[1:19:03] life the right private life the right
[1:19:05] experience now flowing out into the
[1:19:07] right kind of public ministry then
[1:19:09] there's not going to be anyone ever
[1:19:11] begin to desire
[1:19:14] to know him like i know him and if i'm
[1:19:17] not the light and i'm walking in the
[1:19:18] light as i ought to if i'm not
[1:19:20] advocating as i should then they're
[1:19:22] never going to know their way to them
[1:19:28] so we have a responsibility
[1:19:31] and consider
[1:19:32] consider this what are you a voice for
[1:19:39] what do we promote what do we actively
[1:19:41] support
[1:19:43] put another way
[1:19:46] what are you advocating for
[1:19:49] could you consider it with me
[1:19:51] could we consider it as a church
[1:19:53] just ask ourselves
[1:19:56] if someone was to say
[1:19:58] so what's what's uh what's your church's
[1:20:00] agenda
[1:20:04] that we would have the right one
[1:20:07] what's your ambition what's your goal
[1:20:08] what are you trying to accomplish that
[1:20:10] as a believer i'd have the right one
[1:20:12] when i say the right one
[1:20:13] the one that promotes christ
[1:20:17] his interest
[1:20:18] and his cause
[1:20:20] stand with me this
[1:20:21] morning
[1:20:31] [Music]
[1:20:41] the presence that you felt in song
[1:20:43] service
[1:20:45] i don't know if you could tell but it's
[1:20:46] only intensified
[1:20:51] true worship is connected with the
[1:20:52] fulfillment of the word of god
[1:20:56] now that the word has gone forth
[1:20:58] we can have that liberty to really
[1:21:00] worship
[1:21:02] but as we do let's be intentional with
[1:21:04] it
[1:21:06] we're being challenged as a church
[1:21:07] you're being challenged as individuals
[1:21:09] believers to find your place in christ
[1:21:11] to really
[1:21:14] i want to say get comfortable but it's
[1:21:17] not so much getting comfortable maybe
[1:21:19] it's more about getting uncomfortable
[1:21:21] and getting out of those little
[1:21:23] boxes that we've put ourselves in
[1:21:26] to try to protect ourselves and
[1:21:28] fed ways of defining who we are and ways
[1:21:30] of defining what we do and
[1:21:33] ways of thinking
[1:21:35] let's just be honest with ourselves
[1:21:36] we've had decades
[1:21:38] of
[1:21:40] message tradition
[1:21:43] things have just evolved and we do
[1:21:44] things a certain way and there's ways
[1:21:46] that we
[1:21:47] uh
[1:21:48] these dynamics even to a church surface
[1:21:52] and i'm just being very transparent
[1:21:54] right now
[1:21:56] there's ways that i do things as a
[1:21:58] minister that just fit as i'm and i'm
[1:22:00] not this is not a compliment i'm just
[1:22:01] being very transparent
[1:22:03] that just fits the order of the service
[1:22:07] right we're gonna stand when we read the
[1:22:09] bible i'm going to ask god to add his
[1:22:11] blessing to the reading of a word we're
[1:22:13] going to have you to be seated right and
[1:22:15] there's like this is the way that the
[1:22:17] service is supposed to go there's a way
[1:22:18] that we do song service there's a way
[1:22:20] that there's a way that everything's
[1:22:22] structured and and a lot of that is just
[1:22:25] built around how it was done before by
[1:22:28] other people and then the next one
[1:22:30] follows they do it the same way but
[1:22:31] listen we could then build up this idea
[1:22:35] in our minds of this is the way that
[1:22:36] it's supposed to be
[1:22:39] and then one day it's done a little bit
[1:22:40] differently and we get so offended
[1:22:43] i don't get nervous i'm not about to
[1:22:45] change the church order
[1:22:48] but just one of those things it's really
[1:22:49] it's not in the word but it's it's a
[1:22:51] formality that we've based on the
[1:22:53] actions of others or may we based on uh
[1:22:56] certain things that brother branham
[1:22:57] taught and it's based on it
[1:23:00] and we do it that way and if it was to
[1:23:02] be done just a little bit differently
[1:23:03] people oh you'll never you'll never
[1:23:05] guess what they're doing over there at
[1:23:06] arizer believers church
[1:23:08] you'll never guess
[1:23:10] and and they have the and where where do
[1:23:12] we get that from where where would that
[1:23:14] instinct come where would that wrestle
[1:23:15] in that battle come from
[1:23:17] maybe you're advocating for some way
[1:23:20] of doing things
[1:23:22] and you're taking it really really
[1:23:23] personal
[1:23:24] and it's not really in the word
[1:23:27] but we would take up stones to stone the
[1:23:29] one who seemed to just kind of step out
[1:23:32] of line
[1:23:33] so maybe it's not a matter of getting
[1:23:34] comfortable maybe we have to get
[1:23:36] uncomfortable first before we can find
[1:23:37] the place that we're supposed to be
[1:23:40] i wanted to just challenge you today to
[1:23:42] ask yourself what am i voicing my
[1:23:44] support for
[1:23:45] when i started going down the line of
[1:23:47] your whatsapp status and your pinterest
[1:23:48] board and your
[1:23:50] uh you know the people you follow on
[1:23:51] instagram and even what you post on
[1:23:53] instagram
[1:23:55] it was more just trying to
[1:23:57] get you to consider that in your life
[1:24:01] what brand do you wear
[1:24:06] what what is what what voice
[1:24:08] what what
[1:24:09] what have you become a voice for
[1:24:12] and again i think we need to rethink
[1:24:14] what
[1:24:15] the great commission is we need to
[1:24:16] rethink it so don't immediately just say
[1:24:18] oh well fine then i'll change my avatar
[1:24:20] to the pillar fire that's not what i'm
[1:24:22] saying
[1:24:23] that's not what i'm saying
[1:24:25] just starting all over and thinking what
[1:24:27] does it mean to be the final voice to
[1:24:28] the final age let's bow our heads
[1:24:33] if you desire prayer this morning i
[1:24:34] invite you
[1:24:36] i summon you
[1:24:38] to look to him
[1:24:40] look to jesus
[1:24:43] he's here
[1:24:46] i welcome you
[1:24:50] is there anybody else that would join
[1:24:51] with me
[1:24:52] today
[1:24:54] add your voice to mine right now
[1:24:58] as the spirit
[1:25:00] is charging through us
[1:25:03] and as a bride
[1:25:06] could someone join with me and say come
[1:25:08] see a man
[1:25:12] i'm inviting you today to come
[1:25:15] to christ
[1:25:18] it's not my altar it's not my church
[1:25:20] it's not my sermon it's not my testimony
[1:25:22] it's not my ministry
[1:25:25] but i am his voice
[1:25:27] advocating
[1:25:29] for him
[1:25:30] on your behalf
[1:25:33] for salvation
[1:25:34] for healing
[1:25:36] for peace
[1:25:38] for life joy
[1:25:41] receive them now
[1:25:44] a gracious heavenly father
[1:25:48] my pleading in my prayers for the cause
[1:25:51] of christ
[1:25:54] and i would that my family be saved i
[1:25:57] would that people be healed i would that
[1:25:59] the lost would find their way
[1:26:03] [Music]
[1:26:05] and not for
[1:26:07] to promote my own personal agenda
[1:26:10] and truthfully lord not even
[1:26:13] to promote the sinner's
[1:26:15] agenda or their interest
[1:26:19] but the love of
[1:26:20] christ that motivates me
[1:26:24] it's for your cause
[1:26:28] it's in my
[1:26:29] advocating for christ
[1:26:32] that i desire to see others know you in
[1:26:35] the way that i have
[1:26:37] it is in our advocacy for the message of
[1:26:39] the hour
[1:26:41] that we desire that others would come to
[1:26:42] be introduced to you through
[1:26:45] this message
[1:26:47] not adopt formalities not adopt
[1:26:49] modalities not adopt certain ways of
[1:26:51] church order and believings
[1:26:54] [Music]
[1:26:55] lord it's almost as if we've adopted
[1:26:56] catholicism into the message where we
[1:26:58] genuflect before certain things and we
[1:27:03] we have our rosaries and we have our
[1:27:05] candles
[1:27:08] but i want
[1:27:10] to lift up christ
[1:27:14] because not for one moment should we be
[1:27:16] called to start churches to promote our
[1:27:19] own interest in our own agendas
[1:27:22] but wherein
[1:27:23] we preach and wherein we evangelize
[1:27:25] wherein we speak wherein we lift up the
[1:27:28] voice of god it's that a real
[1:27:30] relationship would be formed between god
[1:27:32] and an individual
[1:27:36] but i moved even by reading that
[1:27:37] scripture revelations 22 17 the spirit
[1:27:40] and the bride say come and immediately
[1:27:42] immediately lord you already have it
[1:27:44] written in your word how effective it is
[1:27:46] and him that hears
[1:27:48] him that he hears now echoes what the
[1:27:52] spirit of the bride says and he says
[1:27:55] come
[1:27:57] lord you already wrote it in the word
[1:27:59] that it's effective that it works let us
[1:28:02] then join
[1:28:03] in the echo in the sounding as your
[1:28:06] bride saying come
[1:28:09] and let him hear
