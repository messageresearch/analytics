[0:00] We'll start at verse 18. Come now and
[0:04] let us reason together, sayaeth the
[0:06] Lord. Though your sins be as scarlet,
[0:09] they shall be as white as snow. Though
[0:12] they be red like crimson, they shall be
[0:15] as wool. If you be willing and obedient,
[0:19] you shall eat the good of the land. But
[0:22] if you refuse and rebel, you shall be
[0:25] devoured with the sword. For the mouth
[0:28] of the Lord hath spoken it. Amen. May
[0:31] God add his blessings to his word. You
[0:33] can be seated.
[0:38] This morning we have for a title
[0:41] dialogue
[0:42] and cooperation.
[0:46] And I love this painting.
[0:49] Um it's a painting by I I believe it's
[0:52] by Robert Zoo and it's called the road
[0:54] to Emmas.
[0:56] A good friend of mine has this hanging
[0:58] in his house. And I always love looking
[1:00] at this picture. I love to study it. And
[1:04] and uh we'll get into this story a
[1:06] little bit later.
[1:08] Um
[1:10] but I wanted to tell you
[1:15] 10:30.
[1:17] My son Luke, our six-year-old, was at a
[1:21] vacation Bible school.
[1:24] He went to several this year actually.
[1:26] We like to just visit all the different
[1:28] churches if they have vacation Bible
[1:29] schools so we can get free snacks and so
[1:31] forth.
[1:35] Um but he he was going in one of the
[1:37] vacation Bible schools that he went to.
[1:40] Um they were talking about the body of
[1:41] Christ and they were talking about the
[1:43] church body and the different the
[1:45] different members of the body and not
[1:47] not the different me they weren't
[1:48] talking about you just so you know. They
[1:50] weren't talking about the different
[1:50] members of this body. They were just
[1:52] talking about the different positions
[1:54] that are within a the framework of a
[1:56] church. And they were at the end they
[1:59] wanted the children uh to to to
[2:02] participate in a service and to to feel
[2:05] the part of of each of those roles. So
[2:08] they had uh uh visual and audio
[2:11] children, you know, three-year-olds on
[2:12] on cameras that are just filming the
[2:14] ground and, you know, and playing with
[2:16] the soundboards that weren't weren't
[2:18] hooked up, but they thought they were.
[2:21] and uh you know playing a keyboard with
[2:23] this again the sound off so there was no
[2:25] but they were just pounding on the
[2:26] keyboard and and uh they were looking
[2:29] for a preacher and someone to play the
[2:32] part of the preacher and and Luke got
[2:34] that part. Luke volunteered to to take
[2:36] that part. And uh
[2:40] so they had this service with all these
[2:42] children and his sermon lasted about 45
[2:46] seconds
[2:48] and he had so many fans for that. I mean
[2:53] a 45se second sermon. So
[2:57] I' I'd love to I'd love to get the same
[3:00] accolades as Luke would. And I know you
[3:03] all would applaud it if if this could
[3:05] last 45 seconds. It'd be the greatest
[3:07] church service ever.
[3:10] We'll be a little bit longer than that,
[3:11] but I'll I'll try to get us out in a
[3:13] nice and timely manner. But I'm taking
[3:18] from online uh Marryiam Webster's
[3:22] dictionary. The word dialogue.
[3:26] Um
[3:28] Miam Webster says has several several
[3:31] definitions of this word dialogue. A
[3:33] written composition in which two or more
[3:36] characters are represented as
[3:38] conversing.
[3:41] A conversation between two or more
[3:43] persons. An exchange of ideas and
[3:47] opinions. A discussion between
[3:50] representatives of parties to a conflict
[3:54] that is aimed at resolution.
[3:57] The conversational element of literary
[4:00] or dramatic composition,
[4:02] a musical composition for two or more
[4:05] parts suggestive of a conversation. So
[4:10] this is Miriam Webster's definition of
[4:13] dialogue. Now cooperation
[4:16] much shorter. the actions of someone who
[4:19] is being helpful by doing what is wanted
[4:23] or asked for a common effort.
[4:27] Association of persons for common
[4:31] benefit. So that's what we're talking
[4:33] about today is dialogue and cooperation.
[4:38] And in my mind, I want you to know kind
[4:40] of my thought process behind this so
[4:42] that it's not so abstract as as it can
[4:45] be. Um, in my mind I'm I I'm thinking
[4:49] about ch children and and and the
[4:51] relationship between a parent and their
[4:54] children. Um,
[5:00] and it's only because this is this is
[5:02] just my life right now, you I mean, we
[5:05] have an 18-year-old and we have all the
[5:06] way down to a six-year-old and I have to
[5:09] know how to navigate as a parent
[5:13] uh to be able to communicate with older
[5:17] children and younger children. And I
[5:19] don't talk the same to the older ones as
[5:21] I do the younger ones. And so in my
[5:24] thought process, I'm thinking about this
[5:27] dialogue and cooperation as the thought
[5:31] process behind a parent communicating
[5:34] with their children.
[5:37] So keep that in your mind as we as we
[5:39] talk about this. And the other thought
[5:41] is only because we do this every week.
[5:45] We we we're always coming together in a
[5:48] body. And and and when I when I took the
[5:53] word dialogue, it was it was
[5:58] to kind of contrast the idea of a
[6:00] monologue. So a monologue is one person
[6:03] talking is what I'm doing right here.
[6:06] This this here is a monologue. It's me
[6:08] for the next 45 seconds just talking to
[6:12] you and and you have no there's no
[6:16] discussion here. It's just simply me
[6:18] discussing with you. And and many times
[6:21] I think we come to church and we think,
[6:23] well, I pray that the that the that the
[6:26] minister is inspired. I pray that God
[6:28] has somehow quickened something to that
[6:31] minister and how that it blesses his
[6:32] soul and perhaps I'll be able to glean a
[6:35] little bit and maybe I can follow his
[6:37] thought for a little while and maybe
[6:40] he'll say something that might relate to
[6:42] me that would be a benefit to me. And I
[6:46] think so many times uh we feel as as
[6:50] members of a body many times maybe we
[6:52] come to church and we feel like we got
[6:54] robbed. Maybe we feel like I didn't
[6:56] follow that at all. Maybe maybe you feel
[6:58] like you know what I'm just not I'm just
[7:00] I don't know what it is. My mind's not
[7:01] in it. My heart's not in it today. I
[7:03] don't know what it is. But that was a
[7:05] great monologue but it had nothing to do
[7:08] with me.
[7:12] And so
[7:16] we're going to talk about a dialogue,
[7:18] not a monologue, but a dialogue and
[7:21] cooperation.
[7:26] Now, this scripture that we read here in
[7:27] Isaiah chapter 1 has always stood out to
[7:31] me and I I can remember hearing Brother
[7:32] Brandon preach about this. But this idea
[7:35] that God says, "Come, let us reason
[7:40] together."
[7:44] And you think what an invitation
[7:47] &gt;&gt; that God is offering God Almighty who's
[7:51] omnipotent. He knows he he knows the way
[7:54] you ought to go. He knows He already
[7:55] knows the end from the beginning. But
[7:57] yet he's offering for you to come and
[8:01] reason with him concerning whatever
[8:03] matter you've got going on.
[8:04] &gt;&gt; Now you would think thinking as a parent
[8:07] now remember you know better.
[8:10] &gt;&gt; You've got your six-year-old, your
[8:11] four-year-old, your three-year-old,
[8:12] whatever it is, you know better than
[8:14] them. But they're coming to you with an
[8:17] issue.
[8:20] And is there going to be any dialogue at
[8:22] all? Or is it simply, look, I know
[8:25] what's best for you. Just do what I say
[8:28] and it's over. Discussion finished.
[8:34] &gt;&gt; And we do that. That's what we do. That
[8:36] you just do what I say and that's the
[8:38] end of the discussion and and everything
[8:40] will go along just fine. And it works
[8:42] great for the three-year-old. It works
[8:44] great all the way up until a certain
[8:46] point, especially once they hit teenage
[8:48] years. and they can begin to reason
[8:51] themselves and they want to have a
[8:53] dialogue with you and you think that
[8:56] tactic doesn't work so good anymore.
[9:03] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham takes this scripture
[9:05] and he preaches many sermons and one of
[9:07] the ones that I'm or the one that I'm
[9:09] drawing most of this context from is
[9:12] from Conference with God. Brother
[9:14] Brandon preaches conference with God,
[9:16] conferences with God, conferences, and
[9:18] he preaches and it's all the same sermon
[9:21] just with a little bit different titles,
[9:22] but he's using this scripture
[9:25] that come let us reason together. Though
[9:27] your sins be as scarlet, they'll be
[9:30] white as wool, be white as snow.
[9:35] &gt;&gt; And in this message conference with God,
[9:37] Brother Brandon begins talking about
[9:39] conferences and what is a conference and
[9:42] and why do they have conferences? And he
[9:44] talks about the different conferences
[9:45] they had. He talked about the Geneva
[9:47] convention. He talks about the big four,
[9:49] the the Paris conference, big big
[9:52] international conferences that our
[9:54] governments have had uh to have
[9:57] discussion with foreign parties. And
[9:59] that was part of our you could see that
[10:01] in some of those definitions that we
[10:02] read that if there's a conflict, it's
[10:05] that's what dialogue and cooperation is
[10:08] for is to bring ideas together and to
[10:11] talk them over.
[10:14] And in this message, Conference with
[10:15] God, Brother Brandham says, "What is
[10:17] conferences held for? What's the reason
[10:20] for these conferences?" There has got to
[10:23] be a reason or they wouldn't have those
[10:26] these conferences.
[10:28] They've got to come to a certain
[10:30] decision of what they're going to do.
[10:32] That's what a conference is for, is to
[10:35] make a decision. men in one place and
[10:38] other place and different minds and
[10:40] little things rise up here and something
[10:42] over here and back here. Then they've
[10:45] got to come together and hold a
[10:47] conference and then make a decision what
[10:51] they're going to do about it. And that's
[10:54] why they're held.
[10:56] He says, and then another thought I want
[10:58] you to get is this. In a conference that
[11:02] they never have a conference unless
[11:04] there's a crucial need,
[11:07] it's at a strenuous time when
[11:10] conferences is held.
[11:16] And so
[11:18] again, if you're thinking about a parent
[11:20] and and children or or as children maybe
[11:23] as children thinking about their these
[11:25] conferences they've had to have with
[11:27] their parents at home,
[11:30] something's going on. There's something
[11:32] happening. There's ruckus going on.
[11:34] There's there's a fuss happening in the
[11:36] house. And dad says, "Okay, everybody
[11:40] get together. You two come here. Let's
[11:43] talk. And here we go. Time for a
[11:45] conference.
[11:49] It's at a strenuous time and everybody's
[11:52] thinking about these times in your
[11:54] house. You're thinking about these
[11:55] conferences. Maybe it's a husband and a
[11:57] wife. Okay, we got to talk.
[12:01] There's a conference happening.
[12:11] But when I think about a church setting,
[12:13] when I think about
[12:16] us coming to church,
[12:18] a lot of times that's exactly what we're
[12:20] doing. When we walk through that door on
[12:23] Sunday morning or Wednesday night, we're
[12:26] asking God, "Okay, Lord, we need to have
[12:29] a conference.
[12:31] &gt;&gt; We got to talk.
[12:34] &gt;&gt; I need I need some answers. I need a
[12:36] solution.
[12:38] &gt;&gt; I We need answers here. We need a fix.
[12:41] I've got something happening in my life
[12:43] and I need an answer.
[12:45] &gt;&gt; And many times you think, "No, no, no,
[12:48] no, no. You're just whistling by the
[12:49] graveyard. No, no, no. Everything's
[12:51] going to be fine. Everything's going to
[12:52] be fine. And how are you, brother? Oh,
[12:54] just fine." And your life's just falling
[12:56] apart behind that smile on your face.
[13:00] And God is the one that's calling you.
[13:03] &gt;&gt; We need to have a conference.
[13:06] We need to talk.
[13:19] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham starts here. He says,
[13:21] "And then God has held some great
[13:23] conferences. There come a time in God's
[13:26] great economy where there had to be a
[13:28] conference held. And the first one that
[13:31] I can call of for this earth was in the
[13:34] Garden of Eden. He takes us right back
[13:36] to Genesis
[13:39] when the angels of God came home
[13:42] weeping, saying, "Your child has fallen.
[13:46] He sinned and he's broken your
[13:49] commandments."
[13:50] Something had to be done.
[13:53] The creature of God had fallen from
[13:55] grace and was subject unto eternal
[13:59] separation from the presence of his God
[14:02] and his maker.
[14:04] It was a crucial moment for the king of
[14:07] heaven had said, "The day you eat
[14:10] thereof, that day you die."
[14:13] And putting his trust into his son, his
[14:16] son had broke his commandment.
[14:20] There had to be something done. It was
[14:22] his creation.
[14:25] It was the work of his own hand. It was
[14:28] the love of his heart, the apple of his
[14:31] eye. Something must be done. So, there
[14:35] had to be a conference called.
[14:38] God selected a certain tree in the
[14:40] Garden of Eden. And after he had thrown
[14:43] out old bloody sheep skins into behind
[14:45] the bushes, he called Adam and Eve. And
[14:49] there he made a conference,
[14:51] talked over and made a remedy for this
[14:55] horrible thing that his children had
[14:57] done, God's conference.
[15:06] Now, I pause because I'd like for each
[15:09] of you to imagine what that was like.
[15:11] When Brother Random reads that, it
[15:13] paints a picture in your head, and it's
[15:15] a beautiful picture.
[15:18] I mean, he's just given us a short
[15:20] description, but how long did that last?
[15:22] How long were they hiding? How long did
[15:24] it take them to make that fig leaf
[15:26] apron? How long did they sit in shame
[15:29] wondering what's it going to be? What's
[15:32] going to happen?
[15:34] But what a picture.
[15:37] And I'd like to read the scriptures
[15:39] because in with each of us,
[15:43] this is where we draw from. This is the
[15:45] source we draw from. And so this this is
[15:48] where brother Brandham is drawing this
[15:50] picture from. In Genesis 3, I'm going to
[15:53] read verses 8-11 and then jump over to
[15:55] 21. Says, "And they heard the voice of
[15:57] the Lord God walking in the garden in
[15:59] the cool of the day. And Adam and his
[16:02] wife hid themselves from the presence of
[16:04] the Lord God amongst the trees of the
[16:07] garden. And the Lord God called unto
[16:10] Adam, and said unto him, Where art
[16:12] thou?"
[16:14] And he said, "I heard thy voice in the
[16:16] garden and I was afraid because I was
[16:19] naked and I hid myself."
[16:22] And he said, "Who told thee that thou
[16:25] was naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree
[16:28] whereof I commanded thee that thou
[16:30] shouldest not eat?"
[16:33] Then it says, "Unto Adam also and to his
[16:37] wife did the Lord God make coats of
[16:40] skins and he clothed them."
[16:43] So here, just through the reading of the
[16:46] scripture, we see exactly the words that
[16:50] were given to Moses, but but painted out
[16:54] for us by brother Brandham in such a
[16:56] beautiful picture.
[17:01] And I think about
[17:02] Yeah, that's about right. And and and
[17:05] honestly, Brother Brandham goes on with
[17:07] several many different stories in this
[17:10] message, conferences
[17:12] about conferences, different conferences
[17:14] that God had throughout the Bible. And
[17:17] as brother Brandham's preaching this and
[17:19] talking about the examples that he's
[17:21] given, my mind is just spilling over
[17:25] with other characters in the Bible. One
[17:28] of my favorite is the story of Job
[17:30] because I feel it's so real. It's so
[17:33] human. It it so touches each of us that
[17:37] Job would be willing and able to talk
[17:42] with God and almost as God is asking,
[17:47] inviting us to do here in Isaiah, come,
[17:50] let's reason it out.
[17:53] &gt;&gt; If you've got a problem, bring it up.
[17:56] Let's hear it.
[17:57] &gt;&gt; And and and and Job does Job's not
[18:00] afraid to talk to God and say to God,
[18:05] you know, why why do you bother with me?
[18:09] I'm a miserable human being. Why do you
[18:11] even Why do you torture me with coming
[18:14] back and giving me another chance and
[18:16] another chance? I I'm I'm human. I fail
[18:20] and I can't help but fail. And why do
[18:23] you bother? Why do you keep this up? And
[18:26] and God's letting him go. Just let him
[18:29] spill it out. Just let him cry out to
[18:32] God and and and and and tell God, you
[18:35] know, how this this thing, it just it's
[18:38] like I don't just fail you once. You
[18:40] know, you would think that I have would
[18:42] have this thing nailed down.
[18:44] &gt;&gt; And God's like, "Yeah, go ahead, Job.
[18:46] Get it all out now. Get it all out."
[18:50] &gt;&gt; And when he gets done, God's like, "Now
[18:52] it's my turn.
[18:54] And it's a dialogue that's going on
[18:57] between God and Job.
[18:59] &gt;&gt; And it's so real because if you'll read
[19:02] it when especially when you find
[19:06] yourself in these kinds of situations,
[19:09] suddenly you don't feel alone.
[19:12] You don't feel like, "Am I the only one
[19:14] that has these thoughts? Am I the only
[19:17] one that that has this happen in their
[19:19] life? Am I just a miserable believer? Am
[19:22] I just Am I
[19:25] &gt;&gt; Why do they keep letting me back in the
[19:27] church?
[19:31] &gt;&gt; God's like, "Yeah, good. Good.
[19:34] &gt;&gt; Get Get all that out because I've got
[19:36] answers for you.
[19:40] &gt;&gt; I have a remedy."
[19:43] But you get it out.
[19:45] You need to do that. You need to get it
[19:47] out.
[19:53] So many stories like that.
[20:03] &gt;&gt; I think about my kids and
[20:06] think about at home.
[20:10] You have things that come up and
[20:14] and as a parent, you're like, "Okay,
[20:18] got this thing under control.
[20:21] Come, let's talk. Dad's got answers."
[20:24] All this wisdom that I've accumulated
[20:27] through the years
[20:32] and then it turns into a monologue.
[20:36] it just turns into your children staring
[20:38] at you while you're just unfolding all
[20:41] of this wisdom. You know, well, this is,
[20:43] you know, son, if daughter, if you would
[20:44] just go this direction and if this would
[20:47] happen, this is what I would do. And in
[20:49] that case, I would contact somebody I
[20:51] know. And and they're like,
[20:56] they're like, where's the dialogue in
[20:57] this? Well, if you would just cooperate,
[21:00] you know, this is the cooperation part
[21:02] is you cooperating with me. you just I
[21:04] tell you what to do and then you do it
[21:07] and then it's settled.
[21:11] And I think many times our kids are
[21:13] like, "Yeah, we need to have a
[21:15] discussion,
[21:18] but when's it your turn to be quiet and
[21:21] listen and let me talk?"
[21:26] And when we read these scriptures, I
[21:28] want you to know that that's what God is
[21:30] offering.
[21:36] Is you want to talk? Is there something
[21:39] that you have to say?
[21:42] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, you don't want to hear
[21:43] me say it, God. You don't want to hear
[21:46] me say it cuz it's stuff I'm going to
[21:49] say." He's like, "Say it. Say on."
[21:54] He's a big God.
[22:03] And he's trying to show us
[22:09] how to be like him.
[22:12] He's trying to show us the great plan,
[22:15] this great plan,
[22:18] this harmony that he desired to have
[22:22] from the beginning.
[22:24] &gt;&gt; Yes, it was interrupted.
[22:27] God was like, "Even though it was
[22:29] interrupted,
[22:30] I want you to know that we can still
[22:33] have that amidst the interruption."
[22:37] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[22:39] &gt;&gt; And the world, they they're like,
[22:42] they're like, "What, you know, what do
[22:44] you do? What do you do in that
[22:46] situation?" You know, they they're
[22:48] trying to figure it out. So then they're
[22:50] going, "I need is there a medication I
[22:52] can take? Is there, you know, like how
[22:55] much do I have to drink to get to a
[22:58] state to where
[23:01] and
[23:02] and and as somebody who recognizes
[23:07] that there is a God
[23:11] &gt;&gt; and then when you get introduced to that
[23:13] God and you know he's not a a out in the
[23:17] ether, he's a person
[23:20] &gt;&gt; and that that that person became man.
[23:23] And he was tempted in every manner as we
[23:26] are tempted. And he wants you to know
[23:29] that that what you're feeling. I know
[23:31] that feeling
[23:33] &gt;&gt; that that this this this
[23:36] whatever this interrupt, this whatever
[23:38] it is, anxiety, this issue that you've
[23:40] got, I know it.
[23:42] &gt;&gt; I want you to know I know it. So go
[23:44] ahead. You can give it to me. talk.
[23:56] So, I want to jump over now
[23:59] to this story of the road to Emmas. It's
[24:03] in Luke chapter 24. And I'm just going
[24:05] to read some of the scriptures. I want
[24:08] to jump over it. I would encourage you
[24:10] when you have your at your own time or
[24:12] if you want to stop listening to me and
[24:13] just read your Bible, that's fine. But
[24:16] I'm just going to jump through the
[24:18] story. It says starting at verse 13 of
[24:20] Luke chapter 24. And behold, two of them
[24:23] went that same day to a village called
[24:26] Emmas, which was from Jerusalem about
[24:29] three score furongs. And they talked
[24:31] together of all these things which had
[24:34] happened. Now all these things that
[24:35] which had happened was the death, the
[24:37] burial, and the resurrection of Jesus or
[24:40] the rumored resurrection at this at this
[24:44] moment.
[24:46] Now, it it it it had happened, but all
[24:49] they knew was just the rumor of it. And
[24:52] they're talking about that. So, we have
[24:54] two people having a dialogue on the
[24:56] road. They're walking together and
[24:59] they're discussing they're discussing
[25:02] the matter at hand. They're having a
[25:04] dialogue and and one of them is is
[25:07] talking about and and no and both of
[25:09] them are are sad and and we'll read that
[25:12] Jesus is Jesus asks them, "Why are you
[25:14] so sad with your communications?"
[25:16] They're sad. They they they they haven't
[25:19] understood that this was supposed to
[25:21] happen. They just know what happened.
[25:24] And it's breaking their hearts that this
[25:26] Jesus they thought they that they knew
[25:29] was the Messiah. That they knew he was
[25:31] he was that fulfillment. They thought
[25:33] this he wasn't maybe wasn't supposed to
[25:36] die. They thought the kingdom would be
[25:37] ushered in that this would now just
[25:39] bring in the millennium and so on and so
[25:41] forth. And they were getting ahead of
[25:43] you know they were just misinterpreting
[25:45] scripture and and and they just couldn't
[25:47] wrap their minds around this. But
[25:49] they're having a dialogue together.
[25:51] They're both talking about it. And
[25:52] that's us that's us with our friends.
[25:55] That's us with our spouses. That's us
[25:58] with our our fellow uh believers calling
[26:01] each other throughout the week that you
[26:04] know how's it going? Well, you just
[26:06] won't believe what just happened. You
[26:08] know, the car won't start and then the
[26:10] water heater went out and then you're
[26:12] not going to believe this, but I've got
[26:15] a cousin and this one's in the hospital
[26:17] and and and you're just spilling it.
[26:19] You're just spilling it. My life is
[26:22] falling apart. And and you know, we just
[26:25] had a fight. we just had a fight and I
[26:27] don't know what's going on and and you
[26:29] know and all the issues. They're having
[26:32] a dialogue
[26:35] and they're discussing this matter of
[26:36] Jesus.
[26:44] Verse 15. And it came to pass that while
[26:46] they communed together and reasoned,
[26:50] Jesus himself drew near and went with
[26:54] them.
[26:58] &gt;&gt; Man, thank God for that.
[27:08] &gt;&gt; That's what this is all about.
[27:12] That's what this is all about.
[27:16] Is that when we've got things happening
[27:18] in our life that is too big for us,
[27:21] that's past our understanding, if Jesus
[27:24] can come along,
[27:27] &gt;&gt; it's amazing how things work out.
[27:32] &gt;&gt; So, while they're talking about this,
[27:34] Jesus himself draws near. But their eyes
[27:37] were holden that they should not know
[27:39] him. And he said unto them, "What manner
[27:42] of communications are these that you
[27:44] have one to another as you walk and are
[27:47] sad?" Now Jesus is asking to be a part
[27:51] of this dialogue. Now he wants
[27:54] cooperation.
[27:56] Can you share with me? Can can can would
[27:59] you be willing to tell me what you all
[28:01] were talking about with each other?
[28:03] Would you let me into your conversation?
[28:07] Strange man, stranger comes up on the
[28:11] road. Would you be willing to share with
[28:13] me? You I can see you some you guys are
[28:15] bothered with something. Do you mind
[28:17] sharing with me what's going on?
[28:23] They they said, "Do you not know what
[28:25] just happened in Jerusale?" "No. What
[28:27] just happened about Jesus of what Jesus?
[28:30] Tell me all about Jesus." And they're
[28:33] like, "Well, this is what we thought was
[28:36] going to happen." and they start
[28:37] spilling it to him. And then while
[28:41] they're telling this to him, instead of
[28:43] like, "Oh,
[28:46] I'm so sorry."
[28:48] He says, "Oh, you fools slow of heart.
[28:53] You don't even do you not know what the
[28:55] prophets said." Now, right then, they
[28:58] could have chosen that cooperation has
[29:00] now ended. You call me a fool. So far,
[29:04] and you don't even know who Jesus is.
[29:06] We're telling you what just happened.
[29:08] You don't even know who he is, and
[29:09] you're going to tell us we're fools.
[29:13] I don't know where you're going, but you
[29:15] know, this road's wide enough that you
[29:17] can go to the other side if you'd like.
[29:19] We'll be over here talking about our
[29:21] issues. Thank you. They didn't do that.
[29:26] &gt;&gt; They didn't do that. They c they were
[29:28] cooperating.
[29:30] They he says, "You you you fools, you
[29:33] slow of heart. Do you not know?" And
[29:36] then it says, "And beginning at Moses
[29:38] and all the prophets, he expounded unto
[29:42] them in all the scriptures the things
[29:45] concerning himself." So now he's taking
[29:48] their problems and he's saying, "All
[29:50] right, now let's go through the
[29:52] scriptures and let's through cooperation
[29:55] and dialogue, let me show you that this
[29:58] was all in God's plan,
[30:02] &gt;&gt; that this God's got this under control,
[30:06] &gt;&gt; that God planned this all along." And
[30:08] while he's talking with them, verse 32,
[30:12] and they said one to another, after they
[30:14] get done, after he opens their eyes and
[30:16] they see, ah, it's Jesus, and this was
[30:21] supposed to happen, this is fulfillment
[30:24] of prophecies.
[30:26] And while they're their eyes are being
[30:28] opened to that and he's breaking bread
[30:30] and revealing who he is to them, he's
[30:32] doing something to them, showing them in
[30:35] a way that they knew him intimately
[30:39] that they know that's him. That's him.
[30:41] He's alive. Jesus. In fact, the rumor of
[30:44] his resurrection is true. I know it to
[30:47] be true. I've seen it.
[30:50] It says, "And they said one to another,
[30:52] did not our heart burn within us while
[30:55] he talked with us by the way and while
[30:57] he opened to us the scriptures." This is
[31:00] the purpose of dialogue. This is the
[31:03] purpose of cooperation.
[31:07] &gt;&gt; This is what we all desire when we come
[31:09] to church.
[31:11] &gt;&gt; This is what we and when we walk through
[31:13] those doors, we say, "God, please talk
[31:15] to me this morning.
[31:17] God, I'm coming to hear from you. Not to
[31:20] hear from some preacher, not to hear but
[31:23] God speak through him somehow. God,
[31:26] maybe through a song touch my heart.
[31:29] Maybe through a a a fellowship
[31:31] afterwards talking with a brother and
[31:33] sister something could be settled in my
[31:37] life.
[31:39] &gt;&gt; And and then this is why we come. That's
[31:41] the purpose.
[31:43] And we think but you know but it's only
[31:46] one way. It's just one way. It's just a
[31:48] preacher and he's up there. It's a
[31:50] monologue. And and and where's my part
[31:52] in this?
[31:55] and and and please catch this when I say
[31:58] this because this is how I really feel
[32:05] &gt;&gt; that I'm so grateful
[32:09] that in this day that we live, God sent
[32:12] a prophet
[32:14] with a gift to show us
[32:18] that Jesus Christ is indeed alive.
[32:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:24] say everybody knew that. All the
[32:26] Christians knew that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[32:27] But
[32:29] &gt;&gt; we have the privilege. We have the
[32:33] privilege to have even recorded
[32:37] these messages that when people are
[32:40] coming to services like we've been
[32:42] coming to for generations coming to
[32:44] church, sitting through a church
[32:47] service, listening to a a preacher give
[32:50] his uh version or or or or you know his
[32:55] painting of a story within the Bible and
[32:58] oh that was really good. Oh, I never
[33:00] thought of it that way. That was really
[33:01] unique. I'll tell you that was really
[33:03] neat, brother. Thank you. And then and
[33:05] then you leave and you're like, "Okay,
[33:07] now I got to go home and face the
[33:09] issue."
[33:12] &gt;&gt; That was really great for Sunday.
[33:15] Uh but I know what's coming Monday,
[33:17] Tuesday, and Wednesday.
[33:21] &gt;&gt; For generations, that happened.
[33:28] And then we have this opportunity that
[33:32] God shows us by his grace
[33:37] &gt;&gt; that
[33:39] Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus of
[33:42] the New Testament.
[33:43] &gt;&gt; And that he's not just a God of history.
[33:46] He's still alive.
[33:48] and that this baptism of the Holy Ghost
[33:50] was not just for the 12 on the day of
[33:54] Pentecost, but that baptism has happened
[33:57] in every age. That it was for whosoever
[34:00] will.
[34:02] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandis is is preaching
[34:04] these things and we're like, "What?" You
[34:06] know, we're going this, you know, re is
[34:09] okay, we've heard that before, really?
[34:12] And he's and then at the end of the
[34:14] services, brother Brandon would would
[34:16] would say, "Now,
[34:19] if he would come
[34:22] and show the things that I've been
[34:23] saying to be real,
[34:26] would you believe him?"
[34:28] &gt;&gt; Because the angel told him, "If you
[34:29] could get the people to believe you,
[34:32] &gt;&gt; nothing would stand before your prayer,
[34:34] not even cancer."
[34:36] &gt;&gt; So, he's preaching the word of God. He's
[34:38] preaching the truth right out of this
[34:40] this word. and and it's like that's true
[34:43] that's true but lots of men were doing
[34:45] that that that you know that and and
[34:47] thank God for that but then something
[34:51] different something now if he is
[34:55] alive and if he is real perhaps he would
[34:59] show himself here today
[35:03] &gt;&gt; and that kind of perks everybody ears up
[35:06] like what do you
[35:12] And I'm going to say this now. I don't
[35:15] want to say it later because I'll
[35:16] forget. I am that age.
[35:22] That for the for years it seemed like it
[35:25] was just monologue, monologue,
[35:27] monologue, monologue, monologue,
[35:30] monologue every week. Monologue. We go
[35:32] to church, tradition, tradition,
[35:34] tradition to hear the monologue,
[35:36] monologue, monologue, monologue. Where's
[35:38] the dialogue in all of this?
[35:42] Where's my part, God? How do I know you
[35:46] hear me? I've been praying.
[35:56] And so I want to read a couple examples
[35:58] because every time I hear these, every
[36:00] time I read these, I just think, "Thank
[36:03] you, Jesus."
[36:10] &gt;&gt; To allow people to realize this is not
[36:13] just a one-way street here,
[36:17] that you've got a part into this. And
[36:20] God is very interested in it. He's he's
[36:23] interested in you down to the detail.
[36:27] &gt;&gt; And here's the proof of it. So this is
[36:30] after brother Brandham's preaching. This
[36:32] is I'm I've only taken two. There's so
[36:34] many. I wanted to bring so many, but I
[36:36] want to read these with you. This is
[36:38] from the message testimony. This is
[36:41] after the service. Now, Brother
[36:42] Brandham's called a prayer line.
[36:44] You believe, lady? All right. Let's you
[36:48] and I just talk a moment then. If you're
[36:50] a believer, I believe that is truth. You
[36:53] have a wonderful atmosphere, but you're
[36:55] suffering. You have you've had your
[36:59] trouble is bad enough to you as just
[37:01] you've been to a doctor. And I see him
[37:04] doing something riding on a Oh, it's a
[37:07] heart trouble. You have heart trouble,
[37:10] don't you? And he had something around
[37:12] your arm. It's a blood pressure and it's
[37:15] very seriously about 300. Is that right?
[37:18] I see him shake his head and walk away.
[37:21] He thinks you're going to have a stroke
[37:23] at any time. That's what he said to you.
[37:26] See
[37:29] now, who was in the room there to hear
[37:30] him say that and come back and let me
[37:33] see it right here before me now.
[37:37] Jesus Christ. Is that right?
[37:40] &gt;&gt; Then he's interested in you, isn't he?
[37:43] &gt;&gt; You believe you'll never have a stroke
[37:45] now, will you? God bless her now. May
[37:47] her faith be confirmed in Jesus name.
[37:51] Amen.
[37:52] &gt;&gt; Go believing with all your heart.
[37:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:57] &gt;&gt; Now suddenly
[38:02] we are hyper aware that God knows our
[38:07] problems.
[38:08] &gt;&gt; That God knows what's wrong with us. And
[38:11] now the prayer that you've been praying,
[38:13] the prayer we've been praying that seems
[38:16] to maybe have been a silent prayer that
[38:18] it was just a one-way, it was God,
[38:21] where's the cooperation in this? I'm
[38:23] coming to you. I've got an I've got a an
[38:26] issue. I have an effect. I have
[38:27] something that that that I need. But how
[38:31] do I know? Now, we're getting a glimpse
[38:33] into, oh, God knows and he cares.
[38:38] He's very concerned and he's he can see
[38:40] right into the room where you're at. He
[38:43] can see the doctor. He can he's seen all
[38:46] of that. He's very aware of your
[38:48] condition and he's concerned and he
[38:50] desires
[38:52] that you would have healing, that you
[38:55] would have peace, that you would have
[38:57] joy, that you would be saved. He's very
[39:00] concerned.
[39:03] &gt;&gt; Here's another one. This is from
[39:04] Thirsting for Life in 1957.
[39:08] Now, if the audience can still hear my
[39:10] voice, the woman seems to be getting
[39:12] smaller. There's like a shadow between
[39:15] her and I stands a light. The woman's
[39:18] suffering. Yes, sir. She's very sick.
[39:21] She has many things wrong with her. The
[39:23] woman has something wrong in her bowels.
[39:25] It's colitis. I believe the doctor
[39:28] diagnoses that as colitis. Kind of a
[39:31] thin fellow. the doctor. He said it's
[39:33] colitis. And then I see something about
[39:36] looking at the bottom of the feet.
[39:38] You've got fallen arches, too, that
[39:40] bothers you. That's true. Then you've
[39:43] got some sort of a bleeding hemorrhage
[39:45] in your blood. That's the truth. And I
[39:48] see you drop a dish going from a room.
[39:51] You're real nervous, upset, and you have
[39:53] real gloomy spells kind of late in the
[39:56] evening when the sun's going down and
[39:58] kind of getting kind of a melancholy
[40:01] feeling, kind of strange feeling. I see
[40:03] you sitting on the chair looking out,
[40:05] watching the sun through the window. You
[40:07] have a real funny feeling. That's true.
[40:10] I'm not reading your mind. And here's
[40:12] another thing. I hear you in a room
[40:15] praying. It's beside of a bed and you're
[40:18] asking God to give you the baptism of
[40:20] the Holy Ghost. You're seeking for God.
[40:24] That's thus sayeth the Lord. Is that
[40:26] true or false? Is every bit of it true?
[40:30] You believe God now? Would you say that
[40:33] to the audience? You see that?
[40:37] Now, in between here, just so you know,
[40:40] there is responses. You can hear the
[40:43] lady. That's true. Yes. even to the
[40:45] doctor's description. That's true.
[40:49] And God in heaven knows I know nothing
[40:51] about the woman. What is it? It's Jesus
[40:54] Christ the same yesterday, today, and
[40:56] forever.
[40:58] &gt;&gt; And I want to say this to you, my
[40:59] sister. The dark shadow that hung over
[41:02] you when you come here has gone from
[41:05] you. You're healed. Go on your road
[41:08] rejoicing and thank God. Amen.
[41:15] And I just grabbed those two. There was
[41:17] so many that I wanted to grab. Brother
[41:19] Brandham describing the doctor, what he
[41:21] looked like, things that they said,
[41:25] things that nobody would know. There
[41:26] only two of them in the room. But God
[41:29] God saw it. God heard it. God recorded
[41:32] it. And God showed it.
[41:38] And I say all of that because
[41:42] it shows me
[41:48] and I want my children to know this. I
[41:50] this is this is what I want is I want my
[41:52] children to grow up knowing this that
[41:54] when we go to church it's not out of
[41:57] just tradition.
[42:00] &gt;&gt; Although you know brother Brandham said
[42:01] we should honor the resurrection. That's
[42:04] why we come together and we meet
[42:05] together on Sunday.
[42:09] But not to not to just well that's just
[42:12] what we do Sunday morning and and and
[42:15] it's fine and there's and there's so
[42:17] many benefits to that.
[42:20] But that God isn't just wanting to
[42:24] hammer this down my children's throat
[42:28] and just get it in there and just fit it
[42:30] in and through osmosis it's going to
[42:33] really make you a believer.
[42:36] &gt;&gt; But that God wants a dialogue with my
[42:39] children.
[42:42] that
[42:43] &gt;&gt; that when they've seen, you know, they
[42:47] come to dad for some advice and and
[42:50] sometimes dad's got some good advice,
[42:52] then other times, ah, not really.
[42:57] But when when dad when dad's wrong, when
[43:03] dad's off, when mom is
[43:08] mom's the same. We'll just say that. I I
[43:11] know that. I'm I know that's dangerous
[43:13] to say that, but sometimes it happens.
[43:18] They can go to God
[43:21] &gt;&gt; and I want them to go to him first and I
[43:24] want them to go in the midst
[43:26] &gt;&gt; and then I want them to go at the end.
[43:29] &gt;&gt; I don't want it to be a one-time thing.
[43:31] I want it that that that that through
[43:33] all of it that, you know, well, dad gave
[43:34] me good advice, but I'm still going to
[43:37] God. I still want to go to God in this.
[43:41] I would say yes, children, please.
[43:45] Please, let's get God involved in this
[43:47] in all things.
[43:50] &gt;&gt; And I want them to to experience though
[43:53] it would seem though it would seem like
[43:55] when we go to church, the preacher, he
[43:57] preaches and it and it's a good thing,
[43:59] but where's my part in it?
[44:02] Here's your part.
[44:05] is that the things that you have need
[44:07] of, your desires,
[44:11] things that you've got going on in your
[44:13] life are just as important as the things
[44:15] that are going on in mom and dad's life.
[44:17] &gt;&gt; They're just as important.
[44:21] &gt;&gt; And I want you to I I want our children
[44:24] to know that that the things that are
[44:26] going on in your life, they're very real
[44:28] and they're very important. And that God
[44:31] knows that it's important.
[44:33] And and when you hear something like
[44:35] this, I want you to know that God knows
[44:38] it,
[44:39] &gt;&gt; that God's concerned about it, and that
[44:42] when you come in to a church, when you
[44:44] come into a service, when you're when
[44:46] you're meeting with believers, and and
[44:48] in the midst of it, you're desiring
[44:51] something from God. Brother Brandham
[44:54] when when he would when he would be
[44:56] preaching and when he would uh be fixing
[45:00] to to maybe start a prayer line, he he
[45:03] was he was asking, you know, and and
[45:06] many times the discernment would happen.
[45:07] He would say, "Now now that's not me
[45:10] that's doing that. That's you operating
[45:13] the gift.
[45:15] &gt;&gt; It's your faith pulling the gift.
[45:20] It's you doing that
[45:23] &gt;&gt; and you think what me really brother
[45:27] Brandon is letting you know yes
[45:30] your faith in God if you'll just and and
[45:33] he would say this many times now he
[45:35] would start the service now those of you
[45:38] that have a need you hold that while I'm
[45:41] preaching you hold that before God and
[45:45] you see if God don't answer that
[45:48] &gt;&gt; so through the whole service. They've
[45:51] got something going on in their heart.
[45:53] They've come for a reason. They've come
[45:56] to those meetings for a reason. And it's
[45:58] to get it's to get something fixed. It's
[46:02] a conference with God. They're coming
[46:04] there to have a conference with God
[46:06] because there's an issue. They need to
[46:08] reason it out with God. And then they
[46:10] need a solution. They need to come to a
[46:13] solution by the end. And brother
[46:14] Brandham's saying, "Now you just hold
[46:17] faith. You hold faith. You Now, I'm
[46:21] going to show you in the word. I'm going
[46:24] to back it up. I'm going to build a
[46:26] strong foundation with the word so that
[46:29] you can feel safe.
[46:32] You can feel comfortable to know that
[46:35] it's in God's word. That it's not just
[46:37] it's not just me saying it, but that go
[46:40] it's it's in God's pattern. He's he's
[46:42] been faithful. If he's done it once,
[46:44] he'll do it again because that's how he
[46:46] is. He he would he wouldn't be God if he
[46:49] could if he was changing his mind all
[46:50] the time if he does it once. And he said
[46:52] and and if if if he saved one man based
[46:56] on faith, he's got to save the next one
[46:59] based on faith.
[47:01] &gt;&gt; If he heals one because of their faith,
[47:04] then he's got to heal the next one based
[47:06] on faith.
[47:07] &gt;&gt; That it's by faith. And he's telling and
[47:10] and you're listening to these sermons
[47:11] and you're going, "Okay, then then Lord,
[47:15] increase my faith.
[47:18] &gt;&gt; Do you know do I number one, do I have
[47:20] faith?" And brother Brandon was trying
[47:21] to show you you've got faith. Just like
[47:23] faith the seed of a a grain of mustard
[47:26] seed will move mountains for you. And
[47:29] you've got faith. If you can start if
[47:31] you're going out and you think your car
[47:32] is going to start and it starts, you you
[47:34] just That's faith. You got faith in your
[47:36] car, it's going to start up. That's the
[47:38] same kind of faith he says. And many
[47:40] times, brother Brandham says, "What?
[47:41] Why? Why did God ask uh the children of
[47:44] Israel to apply the blood with hissip?
[47:46] It was a common weed to show you that
[47:48] it's common faith. It's just common
[47:51] faith.
[47:57] That's your part into it.
[48:07] &gt;&gt; Believe it or not, we're closing.
[48:12] 45 more seconds.
[48:23] Brother Random says this in this
[48:25] message, Conference with God. And
[48:27] actually, I'll ask the musicians if
[48:28] they'll come. That's how serious I am.
[48:36] I'd like to sing Brother Micah. He knows
[48:40] my name.
[48:42] But I want to read this quote for you
[48:44] from again, Conference with God. And
[48:46] again, I would recommend go listen
[48:48] listen to these sermons. You'll be
[48:49] blessed. You know that.
[48:56] Brother Brandham says, "Maybe you don't
[48:58] know what to do. Maybe you're a sinner
[49:01] and have done so much sin.
[49:04] Maybe you smoked till you can't smoke no
[49:07] more and can't quit it. Maybe you've
[49:11] drank till you can't drink no more and
[49:13] you can't quit it.
[49:15] Maybe you've come to a place where you
[49:18] so full of sin and lust till you have to
[49:20] look upon every woman you see wrong.
[49:24] Or maybe you've even perverted your own
[49:26] natural resources.
[49:30] Maybe you've come to a block.
[49:34] I don't care where you're at. God is
[49:36] still ready to come to you in a
[49:39] conference and talk it over with you.
[49:43] Maybe you broke up your home. Maybe
[49:46] you've left your husband or left your
[49:48] wife. Maybe you run off from your
[49:50] children. There might be many things in
[49:53] this life that the enemy has trapped you
[49:55] into. But remember, my brother, sister,
[49:59] you still have the rights to have a
[50:02] conference with God.
[50:04] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Talk it over with him. He's a
[50:08] very present help in the time of
[50:11] trouble. Amen.
[50:14] &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother, that is so extreme.
[50:18] We're way beyond that.
[50:21] I've been saved for far too long. I
[50:23] don't have any of those issues in my
[50:25] life." Praise God.
[50:28] But I'll guarantee you've got some
[50:29] issues.
[50:33] And God is inviting us
[50:38] to have a conference with him.
[50:40] [Music]
[50:43] I wanted to throw this in there and
[50:47] I didn't I felt like I had too much as
[50:49] it was Brandon
[50:53] so many times I say so many times I know
[50:55] more than once he he said I'm like a
[50:58] child
[51:00] and he said trying to put my arm in a
[51:03] jacket
[51:04] and he said you just they just can't do
[51:07] it. If you've ever had a little child
[51:09] and get your jacket on, you know, it
[51:11] starts when they're baby. Get your
[51:12] jacket on. You know, they're just their
[51:14] little limp arm is just going every
[51:16] direction and you're like, put it in the
[51:20] the sleeve just,
[51:23] you know, and they're they're going
[51:25] doing the circle thing cuz they can't
[51:27] get the arm in the and you're like, why
[51:29] are what's the circle going to do for
[51:31] you? You know, you're going to catch
[51:32] your jacket.
[51:36] Brandon said, "I need God to help guide
[51:38] my arm and put it in the sleeve."
[51:46] &gt;&gt; He's so gracious in giving us things
[51:49] like that
[51:51] that I It doesn't matter how old you
[51:54] are, how young you are. Brother
[51:55] Brandham's saying, "I myself need God to
[51:58] guide my arm to put it in the jacket.
[52:06] that if God just left it up to you,
[52:10] just, you know, you know what to do. Fix
[52:13] your problems. Just fix your problems.
[52:18] Where would we be?
[52:24] But God's invited us.
[52:27] He's invited us every service.
[52:32] more than every service. You all know
[52:33] this. He invites us every day. He
[52:36] invites us in our homes privately.
[52:40] Let's talk. Let's have a talk. Bring
[52:43] your problem to me.
[52:46] And many times we just pray like, "God,
[52:49] what I need is the wisdom of Solomon.
[52:53] Just give me wisdom how to navigate
[52:56] through this issue." And God can give
[52:59] you wisdom.
[53:02] Many times it's just God, I need a
[53:04] miracle.
[53:06] That's where I'm at. I've exhausted all
[53:09] of my resources. There's nobody else for
[53:13] me to call on that I can think of.
[53:17] It's going to need to be you, God. And
[53:19] he shows up.
[53:21] [Music]
[53:28] This is not a monologue.
[53:32] I want you to take encouragement knowing
[53:34] that when we come together like this,
[53:37] it's very much a dialogue. And I hope
[53:39] that those just those examples that I
[53:42] showed you is that when you're holding
[53:44] before God something and you're praying
[53:46] to God and saying, "God, do you hear
[53:48] me?" He wants you to know, "I hear you."
[53:52] Now we I don't have that gift. You know,
[53:53] we don't have that gift operating to let
[53:55] you know specifically. But you got to
[53:58] see through that that he's the same
[54:00] yesterday, today, and forever. Then he's
[54:02] still a discerner of our thoughts and
[54:04] the intents of our hearts. He still can
[54:06] discern that and that he knows. And that
[54:08] where you're sitting in your seat every
[54:10] time when you come here, you're sitting
[54:12] in your seat and you're praying before
[54:14] God saying, "God, you know where I'm at.
[54:17] You know the condition I've got." Or
[54:18] perhaps you're praying for somebody
[54:20] else. Lord, you know them. They're not
[54:23] here, but you know God, if I could
[54:26] intercede for them, I would do it. And
[54:28] God can answer that.
[54:31] &gt;&gt; God knows that.
[54:37] [Music]
[54:43] Just this come
[54:46] let us reason together.
[54:49] Though your skin sins would be as
[54:51] scarlet, they could be white as wool.
[54:55] Just that scripture there allows me to
[54:58] say, "Thank you, God.
[55:02] Forgive your stupid servant
[55:05] for having to go over this again, Lord,
[55:09] but we need to go over it again." And he
[55:10] says, "All right, let's let's go over it
[55:12] again. Let's pray together. Let's stand
[55:15] with me if you would.
[55:18] [Music]
[55:22] Precious heavenly father,
[55:26] Lord, thank you for your word. God, I
[55:29] thank you not only for this written
[55:30] word, but God, the very breath that you
[55:34] breathe out, Lord, and the word that was
[55:37] spoken, the word that was written, and
[55:39] Lord, the word that has made itself
[55:42] life, it's made itself real. God, if we
[55:46] were to go around, how as the scripture
[55:49] and the disciples declared, we couldn't
[55:52] even pin down half the things that God
[55:54] has we've seen God do. Lord, that's
[55:57] true.
[55:59] You've showed up in our lives again and
[56:02] again and again. Lord, for those that
[56:04] don't know that, that don't know you to
[56:06] be that God, I pray that you would
[56:09] reveal yourself,
[56:12] God, to each one as a personal God. That
[56:18] you're not just out in the ether, but
[56:20] you're a person who knows, Lord, you're
[56:23] you're touched by the feeling of our
[56:25] infirmities.
[56:27] That Lord, you care for us. You care for
[56:29] the problems that we have. You care,
[56:31] Lord, for even the the victories we
[56:34] have. Lord, you're very very aware of it
[56:37] and you you're you you rejoice with us
[56:40] when we're rejoicing.
[56:43] We thank you for that. We thank you for
[56:45] being a good father. We thank you, Lord,
[56:48] for being the right kind of a parent. We
[56:52] thank you, God, for each of us as
[56:54] children, Lord. So some of some may be
[56:57] younger, some may be older, but God, we
[56:59] recognize that you're a proper parent.
[57:02] And Lord, we as parents desire to Lord,
[57:06] to be a parent like you are. And God,
[57:09] that we as children, Lord, we desire to
[57:12] to to to find cooperation with you,
[57:16] Lord, and to learn of you and and to
[57:18] know when it's our place to sit at your
[57:21] feet and to learn of you.
[57:25] Lord, we thank you for affording us an
[57:27] opportunity to pour out our needs to
[57:30] you, Lord, to express our hearts
[57:33] honestly before you. And that God, you
[57:35] don't condemn us over that, Lord. You
[57:38] guide us through it.
[57:41] Lord, you take those nail scarred hands.
[57:43] Even when we need chastisement, it's
[57:46] always with nail scarred hands. We thank
[57:49] you for that, Lord. I pray God that as
[57:52] each of us goes our way Lord as each of
[57:54] us goes to our respective homes that
[57:57] you'd bless each and every home here
[58:00] represented
[58:01] with your presence.
[58:04] That God you would hear our prayers and
[58:07] that God you would even help us to pray
[58:10] properly. That God we would be like the
[58:12] child who would pray our alphabet just
[58:15] to say God you form the words. I don't
[58:18] even know what to say.
[58:20] Lord, we love you. We want to tell you
[58:22] we love you. We thank you for knowing
[58:24] us. We thank you for hearing us. And we
[58:27] thank you, God, for making yourself
[58:29] known to us in this day.
[58:32] We ask all these favors and give you
[58:35] thanks in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
