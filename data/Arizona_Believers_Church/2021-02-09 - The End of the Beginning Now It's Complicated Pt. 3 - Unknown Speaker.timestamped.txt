[0:00] i want to welcome our friends from
[0:01] flagstaff and also wichita kansas god
[0:03] bless you
[0:04] it's nice to see you here today it's
[0:06] just been a real encouragement to us as
[0:08] a body to have so many different friends
[0:09] uh show their support to the church and
[0:11] come and participate
[0:13] in worship with us haven't we enjoyed
[0:14] that the last five months it's been
[0:16] wonderful to see that luke chapter 10
[0:18] verse 38
[0:19] now it came to pass as they went that he
[0:22] entered into a certain village
[0:23] and a certain woman named martha
[0:25] received him into her house
[0:28] and she had a sister called mary which
[0:30] also sat at jesus feet
[0:32] and heard his word but martha was
[0:34] cumbered about much serving
[0:36] and came to him and said lord dost thou
[0:39] not care that my sister hath left me to
[0:41] serve alone
[0:42] bid her therefore that she helped me and
[0:45] so that's uh
[0:46] one reading that i would like for you
[0:50] to catch and then also looking at john
[0:53] chapter 12
[0:55] verses 1 to 5.
[1:01] and i want you to even kind of hold that
[1:04] question in your minds
[1:07] that martha asked the question do you
[1:09] not care that my sister
[1:11] is sitting around at your feet while i'm
[1:13] busy you know preparing dinner and
[1:15] cleaning the house and doing everything
[1:16] that's necessary
[1:18] to domesticate and and asking that you
[1:20] know do you care
[1:22] and she's assuming that he would say
[1:24] yeah i care
[1:25] then tell her to help me out right
[1:26] that's the question that's being asked
[1:28] john chapter 12
[1:30] verses 1 to 5 then jesus six days before
[1:32] the passover came to bethany
[1:34] where lazarus was which was which had
[1:37] been dead
[1:37] whom he raised from the dead there they
[1:40] made him a supper
[1:41] and martha served but lazarus was one of
[1:44] them that sat at the table with him so
[1:46] we're seeing it from a
[1:47] different perspective where it's not
[1:48] just a certain village in a certain
[1:50] house it's very
[1:51] it's a little bit more specific as john
[1:53] does give
[1:55] details even in chapter 11 that no other
[1:57] writer gives in the
[1:58] new testament and he says then took mary
[2:01] a pound of ointment of spikenard very
[2:03] costly
[2:04] and anointed the feet of jesus and wiped
[2:07] his feet with her
[2:08] hair and the house was filled with the
[2:10] odor of the ointment
[2:12] then saith one of his disciples judas
[2:14] iscariot simon's son which should betray
[2:16] him thank you john
[2:18] for selling out judas early on here so
[2:20] we know as we read into this story
[2:23] and i think it's just great how john
[2:25] does that except when it comes to him
[2:27] it's that the one whom jesus
[2:28] loved laid his head on his bosom and
[2:31] he's just so humble as to not mention
[2:34] his name there
[2:35] but here he makes sure that lazarus gets
[2:37] or judas gets called out
[2:39] and then said judas iscariot simon's son
[2:41] which should betray him
[2:43] why was not this ointment sold for 300
[2:46] pence
[2:47] and given to the poor two different
[2:50] questions
[2:50] being asked in the same setting it's
[2:52] just remarkable
[2:54] let me ask that you could be seated at
[2:56] this time
[2:57] while i remain standing i think we're
[3:01] still working out a few kinks maybe in
[3:02] the sound but i do want to say thank you
[3:04] to brother john
[3:05] and brother mitch who've just worked
[3:07] tirelessly and even brother mike and
[3:09] sister jennifer
[3:10] even last night coming and setting up
[3:12] the room and the different things
[3:14] there's so many of you that participate
[3:15] a church that's small
[3:17] and say well how many people do you have
[3:18] on your staff well how many many people
[3:20] we have in our church you know that's
[3:21] the staff
[3:23] you know people want to know how many
[3:24] you have in your administration or your
[3:25] board but we're all together in this
[3:28] and i just appreciate everyone who's
[3:29] labored so hard
[3:31] and so be patient with us as we get used
[3:33] to a new facility it's nice to see so
[3:35] many of you here
[3:36] looks like we've lost some people maybe
[3:37] in the move but they'll find us
[3:39] eventually
[3:41] so i want to continue on the subject
[3:44] that we've been on
[3:45] on the the end of the beginning and now
[3:48] it's complicated
[3:49] and just try to just to jump right into
[3:52] it without much background i think this
[3:54] subject matter would be impactful
[3:57] without
[3:58] um the preface of the last two services
[4:00] and even this kind of continuing on the
[4:02] series
[4:02] of in the beginning but the world that
[4:05] we live in is increasingly becoming
[4:07] more complicated if it's complicated
[4:10] today to the measure of six
[4:11] it's just in a matter of time it'll be
[4:13] cranked up to 13. so it just continues
[4:15] to get more and more complicated it's a
[4:18] chaotic world
[4:19] it's a world that can be very confusing
[4:22] at times and maybe at all times it's
[4:24] confusing in some manner
[4:26] there's events that take place and
[4:27] things that happen that seem very
[4:29] inconsistent
[4:30] we're told one thing so we begin to
[4:32] expect something but then another thing
[4:33] happens
[4:34] and then there's a completely different
[4:36] explanation and justification
[4:37] that kind of contradicts what we had
[4:39] heard before and so we're constantly
[4:41] just being
[4:42] tossed you know to and fro between
[4:43] opinions and ideas and
[4:45] events and circumstances and we saw that
[4:48] how even solomon in ecclesiastes
[4:50] begin to characterize the world that we
[4:51] live in is inconsistent
[4:53] that the just man receives the wicked
[4:55] man's reward and the wicked man gets
[4:57] what the just man should and we see
[4:58] princes walking besides horses
[5:00] and servants on top of him he says the
[5:03] rules and the order and what you would
[5:04] expect and the inconsistencies and the
[5:07] unjust outcomes you just saying this is
[5:09] this is very
[5:10] a very difficult thing to try to figure
[5:12] out and get our heads around
[5:14] what's happening in the world and so
[5:16] it's a harsh time it's a very difficult
[5:18] time
[5:19] and i want you i hope that you could
[5:20] just kind of just jump right into it
[5:23] with me and kind of walk with me through
[5:24] this
[5:25] and try to identify it with it yourself
[5:27] i have a number of scriptures that i'd
[5:29] like to read
[5:30] and i think sometimes we have the habit
[5:32] of when we read scripture we literally
[5:34] go back in our mind well maybe not
[5:35] literally figuratively
[5:37] we go back to that time and we think we
[5:40] begin to think that
[5:41] what was it like then and what was being
[5:43] said then and who was that being said to
[5:44] and what was taking place then
[5:46] but i wanted to be informative and
[5:48] instructive to us where we are today
[5:51] and be able to take it as something
[5:52] that's going to inform our spirits and
[5:53] encourage our faith
[5:55] is looking at god saying i want to write
[5:57] a book
[5:58] that my bride in the end time can read
[6:01] and know everything that's
[6:02] that's ever happened that's right and
[6:05] even and even have
[6:06] a message come that it can enlighten us
[6:08] to what god has unfolded and the things
[6:10] that have transpired
[6:11] since the coming of christ and all these
[6:14] things in these events we have the
[6:15] benefit of looking back and seeing all
[6:16] church history and everything god did in
[6:18] the new testament
[6:19] everything god did in the old testament
[6:21] everything that god had in his mind and
[6:22] in his heart
[6:23] before the foundation of the world and
[6:25] that's to encourage us and strengthen us
[6:27] to have
[6:27] rapturing faith and so i want you to
[6:30] personally identify with
[6:32] the subject matter uh that is and try to
[6:35] do your best to make it relevant to
[6:36] where you are today
[6:38] and my kind of my premise is life is not
[6:41] simple
[6:42] and in that we don't have just the
[6:44] luxury of
[6:45] going to work and eating and sleeping
[6:48] and that's really all that we need to
[6:49] worry about just go to go to work you're
[6:51] going to get your paycheck it's going to
[6:52] pay for what you eat it's going to pay
[6:54] for your bed
[6:54] where you sleep and then you wake up in
[6:56] the morning and you kind of live a
[6:57] shampoo life where you just
[6:59] water rinse you know lather rinse repeat
[7:02] and that's what we're doing every day we
[7:03] just do the same thing over and over and
[7:05] over again
[7:06] and so we're not just able to labor
[7:08] we're not just able to eat we're not
[7:09] just able to go to bed and wake up in
[7:11] the morning and repeat
[7:12] we have so many different intrusions so
[7:15] many different demands by virtue of the
[7:16] fact that you have a job there's
[7:18] different things that
[7:19] uh benchmarks that you have to meet and
[7:21] certain things you have to fill out all
[7:22] the time and there's so much more
[7:24] pressure
[7:25] when you work and even now a lot of
[7:26] people are self-employed and
[7:30] you know it's a double-edged sword it's
[7:31] a kind of a mixed bag it's a huge upside
[7:34] to it but there's a huge downside to it
[7:35] if you work at home work is always at
[7:37] home if you work for yourself and you're
[7:40] you're an employee employer then you
[7:42] have to worry about all sorts of
[7:43] employees and
[7:44] insurance and taxes and different things
[7:46] and so just to get your mind thinking
[7:48] along those lines
[7:48] it can be very very complex it's just
[7:52] not as simple as going to work
[7:53] taking the money you earned at work
[7:55] eating and then going to bed
[7:58] and there's always been complexity
[8:01] to our human existence it's always been
[8:04] there's always been layers to it there's
[8:06] always been nuances there's always been
[8:07] some intricate details about the
[8:09] physical body about the creation that we
[8:11] live in
[8:12] about the demands upon our flesh but
[8:14] it's become increasingly complex
[8:16] there's more layers to it there's more
[8:18] details to it
[8:20] and we're looking at the difference
[8:21] between complex and complicated just to
[8:24] give us some reference point
[8:25] if you want to use those words
[8:27] interchangeably if you want to use them
[8:28] some other way
[8:29] i'm not establishing a doctrine where we
[8:31] go well we believe in complex here
[8:33] instead of complicated no it's not a
[8:35] doctrine it's just a reference point so
[8:37] that you know what i'm referring to
[8:38] to make a distinction be something that
[8:40] can be complex and something that can be
[8:42] complicated
[8:44] but complex is composed of
[8:45] interconnected parts
[8:47] and you'll find that something that's
[8:49] complex because there's interconnected
[8:51] parts and things that relate to one
[8:52] another
[8:53] it looks complex but it's really just a
[8:55] combination of simple things
[8:57] and many different simple things or
[8:59] different simple elements being combined
[9:01] together to make something complex
[9:03] so something complex can be easily
[9:05] understood through special knowledge
[9:07] by taking time to examine it and seeing
[9:09] how these simple parts relate to one
[9:11] another so if you have a
[9:12] special knowledge or skill or
[9:13] understanding maybe a particular
[9:15] experience something that may seem very
[9:17] complex
[9:18] it loses its complexity and it becomes
[9:20] simple to that person
[9:22] who has that knowledge and skill of it
[9:23] it could be that way with the corn maze
[9:25] you go through it the first time like
[9:27] man this is complex there's all these
[9:28] dead ends but then you finally make it
[9:30] through
[9:30] and you go through the next time i say
[9:32] just follow me i'll take all the fun out
[9:33] of it
[9:34] right because you know exactly how to
[9:35] get through it and that can be something
[9:36] that's complex and it's beginning
[9:38] it's a labyrinth there's different ways
[9:40] and they always dead end but yet you
[9:42] once you figure it out it becomes a it's
[9:44] no longer complex but it becomes simple
[9:47] and complicated where actually the word
[9:49] complicated means to fold together
[9:52] to intertwine so something's complicated
[9:54] it's woven together
[9:55] and in being woven together you're
[9:57] unable to identify certain distinctions
[9:59] you don't know where it starts and where
[10:01] it ends and so it
[10:02] it's woven or folded together in a
[10:04] confusing manner
[10:05] and so something that is complicated
[10:07] there may be no rationale to it
[10:09] what is this it's all just kind of
[10:10] lumped together and these parts don't
[10:12] seem to fit and
[10:13] this doesn't even make sense this
[10:14] doesn't belong here so there's no
[10:15] rationale or order to it
[10:17] and in doing so it's not simple anymore
[10:19] because there's really no logic behind
[10:21] it there's no rationale behind it
[10:22] there's no reason behind the combination
[10:24] of the mixing
[10:25] or the blending together and that's when
[10:27] something's complicated
[10:29] and so i wanted to show this picture of
[10:31] a flight deck
[10:32] to give an example the difference
[10:33] between something complex
[10:35] and complicated and i was hoping that
[10:38] captain hayes would be here because he
[10:40] might have just immediately identified
[10:41] what type of aircraft this is captain
[10:45] phelan may actually know uh which one it
[10:47] is but you know if you look at this
[10:48] flight deck
[10:49] now to us us non-pilots this looks very
[10:53] very complicated
[10:54] right like we can't even make sense of
[10:56] it unless you play flight simulator or
[10:58] something
[10:59] uh but there's you begin to look at all
[11:01] the different details and intricacies
[11:03] and
[11:04] all the buttons and all the knobs and it
[11:05] looks like something really fun to play
[11:07] in
[11:09] but to us we don't even know how to make
[11:11] heads or tails of it
[11:12] you know what does this do what does
[11:13] that do and all the even to the top
[11:15] there's all these switches
[11:16] that even go further back than just this
[11:18] panel here
[11:20] and um it's really a very very modern uh
[11:22] flight deck or cockpit is how its
[11:24] non-pilots would refer to it
[11:26] um but it's uh to a pilot though he
[11:28] would immediately look at this and say
[11:30] oh it's not complicated
[11:31] it's complex but it's not complicated
[11:34] and since they have the knowledge and
[11:35] the skill of how to uh
[11:37] to pilot this aircraft this dreamliner
[11:39] they would be able to look at this and
[11:41] say oh
[11:41] well this does this and this does this
[11:43] and this is here for that and the reason
[11:44] why this is here
[11:45] and they would have a skill and
[11:46] knowledge and training to make sense of
[11:48] all the buttons all the switches all the
[11:50] levers and all the things
[11:51] that are in that flight deck and
[11:54] actually a pilot could
[11:55] even look at something complex like this
[11:57] and explain it to us in such a way to
[11:59] where
[12:00] it's no longer complicated we may not
[12:02] really fully grasp it but it takes away
[12:04] the complications
[12:05] and it gives more of a rationale and a
[12:06] logic to what we're looking at
[12:08] and that's how things can be uh the
[12:10] difference between something being
[12:12] complex and complicated to a non-pilot
[12:14] this is
[12:14] this is complicated but to a pilot this
[12:17] is very
[12:18] complex and many different nuances and
[12:21] layers it's very intricate but it's
[12:22] something he could explain
[12:24] now if this cop cockpit is complicated
[12:27] and someone who's just flown a few
[12:28] thousand miles and got
[12:30] got gold status wants to begin to tell
[12:32] you what's going on in here they're not
[12:33] gonna be able to explain it
[12:34] you know what this button does here and
[12:36] what this buzz button does there and
[12:37] when you realize you can't explain
[12:39] something then you probably don't
[12:40] understand it
[12:42] right and that's sometimes how the
[12:44] gospel gets complicated people who don't
[12:46] understand it
[12:47] try to teach it and it becomes more
[12:49] complicated and then we rationalize ooh
[12:51] that must be mysterious
[12:53] but there's a difference between
[12:55] something being complicated and complex
[12:56] because
[12:57] christ himself is is something that is
[13:00] there's so many different things
[13:02] to the word of god so many different
[13:03] layers so many different prophecies so
[13:05] many different attitudes and junctures
[13:06] and
[13:07] fulfillments and things and so we don't
[13:09] want to just try to make it so
[13:11] make it carnally simple but recognize
[13:13] that there's ways that life has become
[13:15] very very complicated and has nothing to
[13:17] do with the natural complexities of it
[13:20] and so thank you brother john for
[13:21] showing that
[13:23] maybe we can have him sign a few copies
[13:24] later
[13:29] and so what we've been doing is to begin
[13:32] to resolve
[13:33] the complications of this life we've
[13:35] been looking at the beginning
[13:37] for contrast and even for clarity to
[13:39] realize that where we are now is really
[13:41] the mature
[13:42] the maturing of seeds that were sown in
[13:43] the very beginning
[13:45] and life in the beginnings we've been
[13:46] saying was simple yet complex
[13:49] complex but not complicated that's the
[13:51] way it was in the beginning it was a
[13:52] very simple life but there was some
[13:53] complexity to it
[13:54] but yet in that it was not complicated
[13:57] and the complexity of life for adam and
[13:59] the woman was resolved through rules and
[14:01] through order and through structure and
[14:02] through the arrangement of things
[14:04] and god had laid it out in such a way to
[14:06] where there was some
[14:08] an approach to the things that they
[14:10] would be facing that would be based upon
[14:11] understanding so though it might be
[14:13] complex in some ways
[14:15] they were very simple towards what they
[14:17] had to do and there was no complication
[14:20] and that's how god simplified life for
[14:22] them in the beginning he gave man and
[14:23] the woman
[14:24] a very clear word order rules to live by
[14:27] things to do
[14:28] and as long as they stayed within that
[14:30] program then there was
[14:31] there was continuity there was harmony
[14:33] and there was a clear direction forward
[14:35] but complication involves something
[14:38] being introduced or just even something
[14:40] being convoluted or something unknown or
[14:42] something being
[14:43] turned upside down and mixed up it's
[14:45] something that becomes unpredictable or
[14:47] irrational
[14:48] and so when you go back to genesis
[14:50] chapter 3 that's where you begin to see
[14:53] complication introduced where things get
[14:55] cloudy and
[14:56] unclear and confusing but genesis 1 and
[14:58] genesis 2 that was the simple life
[15:01] that was just a very straightforward god
[15:03] gave a word but then genesis chapter 3
[15:05] introduces this complication
[15:07] and the woman i want to phrase it this
[15:10] way the woman was offered a choice
[15:12] that the word had already answered
[15:16] so she would there there was it had
[15:18] already been spelled out there should
[15:19] have been no question marks if there was
[15:20] a question mark then they had they knew
[15:22] the one to ask
[15:23] they would ask the lord well lord what
[15:25] what is your plan for this and what is
[15:27] your plan for them
[15:28] but herein comes the complication when
[15:30] the serpent beguiled eve as it says in
[15:32] second corinthians 11
[15:34] 3 and 4 but i fear lest by any means as
[15:37] the serpent beguiled eve through his
[15:38] subtlety
[15:39] so your mind should be corrupted from
[15:41] the simplicity that is in christ
[15:43] for he that cometh preacheth another
[15:45] jesus whom we have not preached
[15:47] or if you receive another spirit which
[15:49] you have not received or another gospel
[15:51] which you have not accepted
[15:52] you might well bear with them so it's
[15:55] important as we read this
[15:57] to begin to consider how satan was able
[15:59] to corrupt
[16:01] the woman how was he able to defile her
[16:03] in the paradox of paradoxes
[16:05] a woman in a perfect eden with the
[16:07] perfect husband with perfect fruit with
[16:09] a perfect god
[16:10] everything was perfect perfect perfect
[16:12] perfect perfect how could all this
[16:14] perfection be soiled
[16:15] how could she fall from this perfection
[16:17] if he was put in a place
[16:18] of absolute perfection with no evil no
[16:20] doubt no death
[16:22] nothing no fear no worry and anxiety
[16:24] what could happen to cause her to leave
[16:26] that position
[16:28] and become vulnerable and something very
[16:31] extraordinary just to ponder and begin
[16:33] to think about how did she fall from
[16:34] this so consider how satan was able
[16:36] to gain access to her spirit and her
[16:38] mind to cause her to fall
[16:40] and to to beguile it means to just
[16:43] defile
[16:43] in the slightest degree and so as we
[16:47] look at satan's tactics and we see that
[16:49] paul is saying
[16:50] that as the serpent beguiled the woman
[16:52] in the beginning
[16:54] i fear that he would likewise beguile
[16:56] you now why is paul saying that because
[16:58] his tactics don't change
[17:00] that if the woman in a perfect eden in a
[17:02] perfect situation with a perfect god and
[17:04] a perfect husband and a perfect world
[17:06] satan could come to her and defile her
[17:08] in the slightest sense
[17:10] to cause the fall then he says look
[17:12] let's not be deceived
[17:14] satan is like a roaring lion as peter
[17:16] says as a roaring lion
[17:18] he's not one but he comes as one to
[17:20] cause fear to cause doubt
[17:22] he says walking about seeking whom he
[17:23] may devour and so paul is saying i
[17:26] this is something i'm fearful of and
[17:29] paul was right to have that fear because
[17:30] the antichrist spirit was already at
[17:32] work and the church was falling away
[17:34] and so he was right of the as the
[17:36] messenger and as a prophet to fear that
[17:39] but i thank god in this age there's no
[17:40] fear of the the elect falling away
[17:43] there's no fear but we still face the
[17:45] same devil and we've got to
[17:46] conquer what others have not conquered
[17:49] and so he's trying to get us to realize
[17:50] that his tactics
[17:51] do not change paul called the devil in
[17:54] second corinthians 4 4
[17:56] the god of this world and he says that
[17:58] the god of this world hath blinded the
[18:00] minds of them which believe not
[18:02] lest the light of the glorious gospel
[18:03] who is in the image of god
[18:05] should shine unto them what a what a
[18:08] connection to the man who was in the
[18:10] beginning in the image of god
[18:12] but now after the fall comes jesus
[18:15] christ
[18:15] the second adam the last adam he says
[18:18] satan is still
[18:19] yet again fighting against this
[18:20] expression and he's the god of this
[18:22] world
[18:24] he's actually said to be the god of this
[18:25] world he's the god of this evil age
[18:27] now that's a very remarkable way for
[18:29] paul to write it because we'd say well
[18:31] isn't our god the god
[18:32] of this world doesn't he own it all but
[18:34] it's a reference to the power in the
[18:36] influence
[18:37] that satan and demons and forces and
[18:39] influences have upon the world today
[18:42] in ephesians chapter 2 verse 2 where in
[18:44] time past you walk according to the
[18:45] course of this world
[18:46] so there was a force that animated you
[18:48] there's something that drove you there's
[18:50] a mindset
[18:51] that caused you to make particular
[18:52] decisions he said according to the
[18:54] prince of the power of this world
[18:56] this is satan this is evil this is the
[18:59] god of this world now he's called the
[19:01] prince of the power of the air
[19:02] the spirit that now worketh in the
[19:04] children of disobedience
[19:07] so there's a spirit at work and there's
[19:09] a way that we can simplify things and
[19:11] i i admit that it can be an
[19:13] oversimplification
[19:15] but there's good and evil that's it
[19:18] and wouldn't it be nice if it was just
[19:20] that easy
[19:22] well there's good and there's evil and
[19:23] so you just expect this bright lying
[19:25] difference between things
[19:27] but really all we have just we're living
[19:29] in the gray
[19:30] there is good and there is evil but
[19:32] we're living in the grave this is a pale
[19:34] horse this is something
[19:35] this is something that is so mixed and
[19:37] so modeled towards say well is it white
[19:39] or is it black
[19:40] what is it it's a muddle it's a muddled
[19:42] thing to where it's very difficult
[19:44] we can read things and say oh black and
[19:46] white this is all this is what the law
[19:48] is this is exactly it
[19:49] and then look at a fact pattern and say
[19:51] all right now what are you gonna charge
[19:52] him with like why
[19:53] well i mean this is really cut and dry
[19:56] over here
[19:57] but the life living the facts the
[19:58] scenarios the things that unfold they're
[20:00] not always black and white
[20:02] they're not always very clear and very
[20:03] easy to see because there's a spirit at
[20:05] work the god of this world is blind to
[20:07] the minds the prince of the power of the
[20:08] earth
[20:09] now works causing disobedience and even
[20:11] causing people to walk after the course
[20:13] of this world
[20:14] i use those scriptures to emphasize that
[20:16] every single one of us are living in a
[20:18] complicated age where there's powers and
[20:22] forces that want to change your
[20:23] perception and your attitude
[20:26] in genesis chapter 3 verse 1 it says now
[20:28] the serpent was more subtle than any
[20:30] beast of the field
[20:31] which the lord god had made and he said
[20:33] unto the woman
[20:34] yea hath god said ye shall not eat of
[20:37] every tree of the garden
[20:39] and so it wasn't it wasn't him
[20:42] even stating the fact but he states it
[20:45] in a way to make it a question
[20:47] he didn't say god said you shouldn't eat
[20:49] of every tree of the garden because then
[20:51] there would have been maybe some
[20:52] affirmation from the woman
[20:54] that's right and and that's the end of
[20:56] it but yet there's something here
[20:59] that she has to respond to and what
[21:02] satan's trying to do is to defile her
[21:04] understanding
[21:06] so he says didn't god say you can't eat
[21:07] of every tree of the garden
[21:09] and you remember that his goal is to be
[21:11] like god
[21:13] so he's not just kind of innocently just
[21:14] saying hey i've been scratching my head
[21:16] this morning trying to figure this out
[21:17] he has an ambition he has a desire he
[21:19] has a goal he wants to be like god
[21:21] and he wants to use the woman to do that
[21:24] and so he poses a question
[21:26] now if we could somehow in our minds
[21:28] even transport
[21:30] ourselves back to that time in that day
[21:32] just to consider what it would have been
[21:34] like and then make application for
[21:36] ourselves today it's a question that
[21:37] seems innocent
[21:40] it's it's a question that you can say
[21:41] the sermon says i know that god gave you
[21:43] a commandment i know that he says you
[21:45] can't eat of every tree of the garden
[21:47] but which one was it and and what were
[21:49] those details but the serpent
[21:51] is trying to accomplish something and
[21:54] what the serpent is trying to accomplish
[21:56] is not harmless
[21:57] so the question may seem innocent but
[21:59] it's not an innocent question
[22:01] he's asked the question to kind of
[22:03] establish a basis upon which he wants to
[22:05] go
[22:05] forward and begin to have a conversation
[22:08] that moves her mind and her conviction
[22:10] from one place to another
[22:12] and so in asking the question he poses
[22:14] this well you have god said that you
[22:16] can't eat of every tree of the garden
[22:18] and remember i want you to hold this in
[22:19] your mind he's asking this
[22:21] deceitfully with an ambition and a
[22:24] motive to cause the woman
[22:26] to fall and the woman's answer is very
[22:29] clear we may eat of every fruit of the
[22:31] tree except for
[22:32] the tree of the knowledge of good and
[22:33] evil i mean she's very very clear about
[22:35] it
[22:36] but then he says in verse 4 because she
[22:38] says because if we eat of that tree we
[22:40] die
[22:41] so he's asked a question are you able to
[22:43] eat of every tree in the garden she
[22:45] answers it and says
[22:46] no we can't eat of the tree of knowledge
[22:47] of good and evil because if we do we die
[22:49] and then in verse 4 he says
[22:51] you shall not surely die now we know
[22:54] this is a lie
[22:57] but it's more than just a lie it's a
[22:58] direct contradiction to what god had
[23:00] said
[23:01] and to what the woman understood when
[23:03] she says that we
[23:04] if we eat it we die she was not confused
[23:06] on that she wasn't confused
[23:08] on whether or not god had said it it was
[23:09] very simple and she simply believed it
[23:12] she was very simple towards the promise
[23:14] god said we'd die if we did it
[23:15] so i just believe that we won't that
[23:17] we'll die if we do so she just was
[23:19] simple towards the promise
[23:20] god said don't eat it or you die this is
[23:22] according to godly wisdom this was
[23:24] according to divine rationale
[23:26] it wasn't really open to debate
[23:30] he didn't say let's we're just
[23:31] spitballing here adam tell me what do
[23:32] you think should you be able to live if
[23:33] you eat this and what do you think about
[23:35] that no god had established it
[23:37] and there may have been some there's
[23:38] some divine wisdom to it to where well
[23:40] that doesn't make sense and this doesn't
[23:42] make sense and that doesn't make sense
[23:43] but that's where we sit today
[23:46] but then this was godly wisdom there's a
[23:47] divine rationale to it it wasn't subject
[23:50] to debate it wasn't
[23:51] they weren't able to get together in the
[23:52] garden and say well i just think this is
[23:54] ridiculous i think we should have a vote
[23:56] it shouldn't be like this no this was
[23:57] god's word he established it that way
[24:00] and this was what the woman was simple
[24:02] towards
[24:04] as paul said that you beguiled from the
[24:06] simplicity that is in christ it's the
[24:08] sublime simplicity
[24:09] to christ she just simply believed the
[24:11] word of god
[24:14] now he says in verse 5 he says ye shall
[24:16] not surely die this is in direct
[24:18] contradiction to what god had said
[24:20] to what the woman had promised and that
[24:21] is a lie but then he says
[24:23] for god doth know that in the day you
[24:25] eat thereof then your eyes shall be
[24:27] opened
[24:27] and you shall shall be as gods knowing
[24:30] good
[24:30] and evil
[24:35] so not only did he lie but now he's
[24:38] calling god a liar
[24:42] it would be one thing from a point of
[24:44] confusion and not sure and just
[24:46] uncertain that he just kind of takes a
[24:48] difference to what uh what has been
[24:50] established before he says you won't die
[24:52] and not only that god knows that when
[24:54] you do eat your eyes will be open you'll
[24:55] be as gods and you'll no good from evil
[24:58] and so he's not only lying about whether
[25:00] or not you die but now
[25:01] he is actually calling god a liar saying
[25:03] god doth no
[25:05] this is what he's setting forth but god
[25:07] said it very plainly in genesis 2 17
[25:10] but of the tree of the knowledge of good
[25:12] and evil thou shalt not eat of it for in
[25:14] the day that thou eatest thereof
[25:16] thou shalt surely die so let's take
[25:20] death and compare it to what the devil
[25:21] says your eyes are gonna be open you're
[25:23] gonna be because god's
[25:24] knowing good and evil you're gonna be
[25:25] godlike you're gonna have incomplete
[25:26] knowledge
[25:27] and god says no you're going to die he's
[25:29] contradicting what god had said by
[25:31] saying you're not going to die
[25:32] and now he's saying he also lied to you
[25:35] he told you you were going to die
[25:37] because he doesn't want you to know
[25:40] god is it's almost as if he's saying
[25:42] this god that you serve this god that
[25:44] you claim to be true
[25:45] this god that you said gave your word
[25:48] it was complex but it wasn't complicated
[25:52] but now at this very moment in genesis
[25:54] chapter 3 things get tangled
[25:56] things kind of get very very confusing
[25:58] if she's gonna accept what this serpent
[26:00] is saying
[26:01] that god told you you would die but the
[26:03] truth is you won't die
[26:04] and the reason why he told you you would
[26:06] die is because there's more for you
[26:08] there's something better there's a
[26:09] greater liberty there's a greater joy
[26:11] there's more wisdom
[26:12] and that belief in him is trying to keep
[26:14] you from it
[26:16] and at that moment the woman was i would
[26:19] have had a choice but she stops for a
[26:21] moment
[26:22] and she thinks to herself could that be
[26:25] true
[26:26] and that's all it took
[26:30] and that's why solomon and his wisdom
[26:34] i say that's why oh maybe that makes it
[26:36] sound like i've got it all figured out
[26:38] but when we read in ecclesiastes chapter
[26:41] 7 verse 29
[26:44] it's it just kind of forms as i
[26:46] mentioned wednesday night just this
[26:48] this kind of turning point which
[26:50] everything in this book of ecclesiastes
[26:51] can turn on this verse
[26:53] because the preacher the writer
[26:54] solomon's trying to make sense of the
[26:55] world he says all is vanity
[26:57] and when i saw everything and what it
[26:59] was i said you know what i'm going to
[27:00] gain as much as i can
[27:01] consume as much as i can enjoy as much
[27:04] as i can
[27:05] and he had a house with the pool with
[27:07] the rock band that came with it
[27:09] and and all the gardeners and all the
[27:11] pool guys and he had all the food and
[27:13] all the amenities he had everything he
[27:14] wanted
[27:15] and he said but it was all vanity and he
[27:17] says ah but i have wisdom
[27:19] and then he realized what happened to
[27:20] the fool happened to him and he said
[27:21] it's all vanity
[27:23] so he he's he's trying to figure out why
[27:25] are men
[27:26] consumed with life and always
[27:28] disappointed and always
[27:32] finding themselves with false
[27:33] expectations and broken dreams and why
[27:36] is everything vanity of vanities and
[27:38] he's bringing it down and then he makes
[27:39] this observation in chapter 7 verse 29
[27:42] and it is so powerful he says lo this
[27:45] only have i found.
[27:47] now in the many one things that he says
[27:49] he's found and the things that he had
[27:50] discovered
[27:51] it's almost as if when you take
[27:53] everything it just fits within
[27:55] this headship everything else he says
[27:58] and this have i found and this have i
[27:59] found
[28:00] he's you could basically funnel it all
[28:02] back to this as solomon say i figured it
[28:04] out
[28:04] this is why he says that god hath made
[28:08] man
[28:08] upright but they have sought out many
[28:11] inventions
[28:13] satan excuse me solomon is attributing
[28:16] the vanity of life the frustrations of
[28:18] life
[28:18] on the fall he's going all the way back
[28:21] to the beginning he's looking at the end
[28:22] of the beginning and saying
[28:23] i know why it is this way in the
[28:25] beginning god made man in his image he
[28:27] made him pure he made him righteous he
[28:29] made him holy
[28:30] he made him singular he was not mixed
[28:33] with evil he had no doubt he had no
[28:34] other choices he had no other options
[28:36] but now having lost the holy image of
[28:38] god he's endlessly searching for
[28:41] fulfillment
[28:42] and cannot find it that's as if this
[28:44] it's as if there's a shadow in his
[28:46] spirit
[28:47] something's haunting him and he's trying
[28:49] to chase it down and he's trying to
[28:51] catch it and he's trying to figure it
[28:52] out
[28:53] as if that holy image of god though it
[28:55] left there still was some imprint in man
[28:57] that left him with a hunger and a thirst
[28:59] and a desire and he's trying to figure
[29:01] out ways to satisfy he's trying to
[29:02] figure out ways to quench it
[29:04] and he's endlessly searching for things
[29:06] but he can never find it
[29:08] as i pondered this verse and i looked at
[29:10] it and i looked at it and i looked at it
[29:16] i just i in reading it in the
[29:19] original in the hebrew and then the
[29:21] different translations and
[29:23] i i just took all these
[29:27] all these meanings that were being
[29:28] expressed in this verse and i
[29:30] i wrote it down this way so i just want
[29:32] to share it as i wrote it down
[29:35] solomon and i'm saying it from the
[29:37] perspective of solomon i discovered the
[29:39] fountain of all vanity and evil
[29:41] it is the original sin that has
[29:43] corrupted the nature of man
[29:45] god made adam and the woman without
[29:47] imperfection
[29:48] in likeness of his own desire and nature
[29:51] but the woman
[29:52] not content anymore with her present
[29:54] condition accepted a new way of making
[29:56] herself wise
[29:58] ever since all mankind is prone to
[30:00] forsake the order of god's word
[30:02] and has sought out new methods to attain
[30:04] fulfillment and happiness
[30:07] this is what solomon is looking at he's
[30:08] saying i i figured it out i've
[30:10] discovered that the reason why man is
[30:12] the way he is
[30:13] it goes back to the fall because god
[30:15] made the man in a particular way
[30:17] now that he's mixed he is no longer and
[30:20] when did the mixing start the woman was
[30:22] made to feel
[30:23] some sense of loss or fear of loss by
[30:26] the serpent
[30:28] and not being happy in her her state
[30:30] made accepted
[30:31] a new way of making herself wise and
[30:33] then ever since this is how mankind has
[30:35] lived
[30:36] it says god hath made man upright but
[30:38] they have sought out many
[30:40] inventions and we might read that and go
[30:42] oh my goodness i'm really enjoying a lot
[30:44] of these inventions
[30:45] i drove one to church today and i i'm
[30:47] using one now and i use this i love all
[30:49] these inventions but
[30:51] it's not just it's not inventions like
[30:53] you know thomas edison's getting called
[30:55] out
[30:55] but it's inventions and there's
[30:57] computations sought out many inventions
[31:00] opinions and judgments inventions
[31:01] is imaginations or valuations those they
[31:04] devised
[31:05] many different ways many different
[31:07] opinions many different belief systems
[31:09] confessions to resolve the vanity of
[31:11] life to try to give some sense and
[31:13] meaning to life
[31:14] to try to find some sense of
[31:15] satisfaction and what he's basically
[31:17] saying is man has invented
[31:18] a million ways to distract himself
[31:21] distracted from distraction by
[31:23] distraction i think is what one of the
[31:25] poets wrote
[31:25] that describes mankind
[31:28] because god made man upright but now
[31:30] they seek many computations
[31:32] and the word even even suggests and they
[31:36] meddle with endless questions
[31:39] god made man upright but why is man
[31:41] unhappy because he's constantly
[31:43] questioning it's constantly asking me
[31:46] god made man upright and off
[31:50] righteous and with no evil and unmixed
[31:52] and this is the man that he made and he
[31:54] could just be simple towards the promise
[31:55] and believe god's word and wait on him
[31:57] for wisdom but now
[31:59] mankind meddles with endless questions
[32:01] and this is how simplicity in the end
[32:03] the beginning was lost and how chaos was
[32:05] found is through the endless
[32:07] considerations the endless questions
[32:09] and all these questions only do one
[32:11] thing promote anxiety
[32:15] because you ask a question you can't
[32:16] seem to find the answer then it gives
[32:18] you
[32:18] it causes some sense of fear that oh
[32:20] maybe in the absence of an answer
[32:22] there's something bad that may be
[32:24] happening to me
[32:27] and so this the fall began with the
[32:29] question
[32:30] and then a lie you'll find in the new
[32:33] testament i think one
[32:34] person added it all up they said jesus
[32:36] 113 different times
[32:38] answers questions asked 25 different
[32:40] questions themselves the
[32:42] disciples asked dozens of questions but
[32:44] here in matthew chapter 22 verses 15 to
[32:46] 18
[32:48] says then with the pharisees and took
[32:49] counsel how they might entangle
[32:51] him in his talk and they sent out unto
[32:54] him their disciples with the herodians
[32:56] saying
[32:56] master we know that thou art true and
[32:59] teach us the way of god and truth
[33:01] neither carest thou for any man for thou
[33:04] regardest not
[33:05] the person of men now do you know what's
[33:07] happening here
[33:09] they're kind of grooming them a little
[33:10] bit kind of making them
[33:12] trying to see if they can't provoke his
[33:13] pride and we've got to be very careful
[33:16] when people come to us and they flatter
[33:18] us and
[33:18] you're a man of wisdom and and we're
[33:20] really in a bad situation
[33:22] we're just coming to you because we
[33:23] really need advice and we just want you
[33:25] to give us counsel on this because we
[33:27] can't think of a better counselor
[33:29] and they and and really they have a
[33:30] false motive and you got to be careful
[33:33] that through
[33:33] vanity and compliments and gifts that it
[33:36] doesn't defile your discernment
[33:37] and so they say tell us therefore what
[33:39] what think is that what do you think
[33:41] is it lawful to give tribute unto caesar
[33:43] or not
[33:44] but jesus perceived their wickedness
[33:47] thank god for discernment
[33:48] perception and he says why tempt ye me
[33:52] ye hypocrites now he perceived their
[33:55] wickedness what was their wickedness
[33:56] they wanted to entangle him
[33:58] so he used it they used flattery to
[33:59] begin with to try to disarm him to try
[34:01] to
[34:02] get him to think oh we're just we think
[34:04] you're amazing just tell us the truth
[34:05] and we'll believe it
[34:06] but they wanted him to say oh we'll give
[34:10] tribute to unto caesar
[34:11] or no no you don't need to give tribute
[34:13] to caesar to get him to be pushed into
[34:15] one side or the other
[34:16] to trap him in his talk and it caused
[34:19] him to get wrapped up in some polarizing
[34:21] issue of the day
[34:22] and instead he just kind of turns it on
[34:24] him and says well whose face is on that
[34:26] coin
[34:27] and they go well it's caesars and he
[34:29] goes well then if caesar's face is on it
[34:31] then give it to caesar
[34:32] and like oh well okay that didn't work
[34:35] and if you keep reading i think they try
[34:37] two at least two other times they come
[34:39] in waves
[34:40] trying to question him trying to trip
[34:42] him up trying to tempt him he says why
[34:44] tempt me he said because they recognized
[34:46] they were trying to entangle
[34:48] him and entangle means to ensnare or to
[34:51] entrap
[34:52] so was it an honest question did they
[34:55] really want to know
[34:57] whether or not they should give tribute
[34:58] were they asking because they wanted to
[35:00] pay their tithes they just weren't sure
[35:01] how much
[35:03] was that really what they were asking no
[35:05] it wasn't an honest question
[35:07] it was hypocritical because there was an
[35:09] impure motive
[35:10] he says you're hypocrites you don't even
[35:12] care about the answer you just want to
[35:13] use my answer against me
[35:16] you've already thought through this and
[35:17] you think regardless of how i answer say
[35:18] yes pay or don't pay
[35:20] you've got a way of putting me in a camp
[35:21] and running me down
[35:24] you've got a way of politicizing it and
[35:26] trying to do me harm
[35:29] and this is how that they approach jesus
[35:31] this is the world
[35:32] coming against jesus and what do you say
[35:34] hey if they hated me they'll hate you
[35:36] and we need to be fully aware that the
[35:38] world is dishonest
[35:42] that the world and society and media in
[35:45] in
[35:45] in forums and support groups and
[35:47] everything else that we can be a part of
[35:49] if they compose choices or describe
[35:51] scenarios and in doing so do it
[35:53] dishonestly
[35:56] and it's through this through suggestion
[35:58] and through scenarios and even in this
[36:00] particular situation
[36:01] where there was this dishonest question
[36:03] in order to entangle him or trap him
[36:05] this is how our behavior becomes
[36:07] influenced
[36:09] because many of the questions and
[36:11] choices that were posed
[36:12] today they're not honest we feel as if
[36:16] we're being asked the question perhaps
[36:17] for the other person to know where we
[36:20] stand or to make their decision or
[36:21] or because there's some kind of uh open
[36:24] agenda here and we're just being we're
[36:25] just discussing these things openly and
[36:27] we should be able to communicate
[36:28] but in reality there's some hidden
[36:30] influence even in sometimes an unstated
[36:33] motive or objective
[36:34] to get you to declare to say something
[36:36] or to make some kind of position or to
[36:38] even consider it
[36:39] well you ever thought of this
[36:42] and so society imposing questions they
[36:45] do it
[36:45] questions of morality of ethics and in
[36:48] doing so it causes us to wrestle with
[36:49] different things
[36:51] and there can be some real conundrums
[36:52] some real doozies
[36:54] to use a real educated word some real
[36:56] doozies
[36:58] when people ask us questions we're like
[37:00] whoa
[37:01] i never thought about that yeah and
[37:04] while you're thinking about it consider
[37:05] this did you know this this
[37:06] and they start giving all the details to
[37:07] it you're like i never thought of that
[37:09] i never thought of that i never thought
[37:12] of that
[37:13] and then immediately you're putting in
[37:14] this you're putting this quantity well
[37:16] what should i do how should i respond
[37:19] should i continue this way should i go
[37:21] that way
[37:21] does this mean that does this mean that
[37:22] have i been doing everything wrong my
[37:23] whole life and just whatever the
[37:25] scenarios it gets you to question
[37:26] and that's what the woman was in in the
[37:29] garden
[37:30] life had never been like that before she
[37:32] had it easy
[37:34] right to use another high dollar word
[37:36] easy peasy
[37:38] is that how we do it in a sophisticated
[37:39] way that's that was just it was so
[37:42] smooth i mean it was there was no aches
[37:45] and pains when they woke up in the
[37:46] morning
[37:48] there was no wonder did you check the
[37:49] weather today it was more like what
[37:50] weather do you want hun
[37:52] right i mean it was like everything they
[37:54] wanted it was perfect
[37:58] and now what the woman went through in
[37:59] genesis chapter three is what we go
[38:01] through every day
[38:02] on a constant basis and i want this to
[38:05] become
[38:06] uh the first building block of my
[38:08] foundation
[38:09] this morning the world is not innocent
[38:15] and it is in its lack of innocence
[38:18] there's
[38:19] motives and objectives behind everything
[38:21] there's influences behind everything
[38:23] and we can't just willy-nilly accept
[38:25] everything and engage in everything and
[38:27] embrace everything
[38:28] and think that we can do certain things
[38:30] and believe certain things and go
[38:32] certain places and enjoy certain
[38:34] pursuits and think that they're not
[38:35] without consequence
[38:37] i mean there's some real there's real
[38:39] consequences to the things that are in
[38:40] the world today
[38:41] that we have to be very careful and have
[38:43] wisdom
[38:44] and be wise as serpents and harmless as
[38:46] doves as we navigate this world because
[38:48] it is not
[38:49] an innocent world it's the kind of world
[38:52] that wants to take these young people
[38:53] that are sitting on these first few rows
[38:55] and take their innocence and their
[38:57] simple faith in the word of god
[38:58] and if you would ask them yes we believe
[39:00] and yes this is what we're supposed to
[39:02] do and yes this is right you say well
[39:03] how do you know it's right to do this
[39:04] how do you know you shouldn't do that
[39:06] they'd say well i don't know they're
[39:07] just very simple towards it though like
[39:08] it's in the bible right
[39:10] and it's in the bible what the devil
[39:14] wants to do is as they begin to enter
[39:15] into adolescence in their teenage years
[39:17] through circumstance and situations and
[39:20] relationships and hardships
[39:22] and pressures and entanglements get them
[39:25] to begin to lose their resolve that
[39:27] god's word is
[39:28] true and maybe there's just a lot of
[39:29] other ways out there to live happy
[39:33] and the world is not innocent and now
[39:36] the other building block of my
[39:38] foundation this morning is not only is
[39:39] the world not innocent
[39:41] but we don't have innocent hearts either
[39:44] i say that in the sense that there can
[39:45] be easily divided
[39:47] easily influenced in jeremiah chapter 17
[39:50] verses 7 to 9 i
[39:52] we typically would read verse 9 but
[39:54] verses seven and eight
[39:56] kind of give the background for verse
[39:59] nine
[40:01] as comp i want to say competition that
[40:04] verse nine competes with seven and eight
[40:06] but seven and eight begin to describe
[40:08] what the man and the woman would
[40:10] have been in the garden blessed is the
[40:12] man that trusteth in the lord and whose
[40:14] hope the lord is
[40:15] for he shall be as a tree planted by the
[40:17] waters that spreadeth out her roots by
[40:19] the river
[40:19] and shall not see when heat cometh but
[40:22] her leaves shall be green
[40:23] and shall not be careful in the year of
[40:24] drought neither shall cease from
[40:26] yielding fruit
[40:27] so the man that trusts in the lord and
[40:29] his hope is in the lord
[40:31] his tree is as if it's planted by the
[40:33] rivers of water the roots go down deep
[40:34] it receives nourishment
[40:36] and so it's going to bring forth fruit
[40:38] it's going to have a green leaf
[40:39] and when the heat comes it doesn't need
[40:41] to worry
[40:42] the very green leaves and healthy leaves
[40:44] will protect the roots and give it shape
[40:46] give shade so that it can continue to
[40:47] grow and then even in the year of
[40:49] drought
[40:50] it doesn't need to be anxious or or have
[40:52] anxiety or stress
[40:54] because it's still going to yield fruit
[40:57] the god had designed it in a particular
[40:59] way regardless of drought regardless of
[41:01] hot sun
[41:01] that if it's planted by the water and
[41:03] it's been nourished and it's got the
[41:04] appropriate root system and god's
[41:06] planted it
[41:06] and it's the seed coming forth just
[41:08] exactly the way that god designed it
[41:10] that when the heat comes
[41:11] the leaf is going to protect it when the
[41:13] drought comes it's going to yield fruit
[41:15] because the roots have its nourishment
[41:16] because of the protection of the leaves
[41:18] and everything's working together in
[41:19] concert and it doesn't have anything to
[41:21] worry about
[41:23] and verse nine you can say but the heart
[41:26] is deceitful above all things
[41:28] and desperately wicked who can know it
[41:32] so we're trying to make this point the
[41:33] fall made simple
[41:36] mankind stopped trusting in the lord
[41:39] the woman stopped hoping in the lord
[41:43] and so verse 9 this deceitful heart and
[41:45] desperately wicked who can know it
[41:47] it's set as a contrast to this man who
[41:49] trusts and who hopes
[41:50] who's undivided in his affection towards
[41:52] christ who's singular towards the word
[41:54] of god
[41:55] i trust in you i hope in you i have no
[41:56] other trust i have no hope it's not
[41:58] i believe in god but i'm hoping for a
[42:00] stimulus check
[42:04] check or no check god's got my back
[42:07] right
[42:07] and that's exactly the way he's saying a
[42:09] man that trusts in the lord a man whose
[42:11] hope is in the lord
[42:12] look god's gonna see him through in the
[42:14] end but a man who's divided a man who's
[42:16] split who says he believes in god but
[42:18] acts contrary to it
[42:19] this is a man who's the product of a
[42:21] deceitful heart that's desperately
[42:22] wicked
[42:24] he says who can figure it out a
[42:26] deceitful heart it means insidious
[42:29] something that starts out real small but
[42:30] gradually what is it doing it's
[42:32] incrementally
[42:33] causing harm very sly if it's insidious
[42:36] it's sly
[42:36] it's slippery it's very subtle so our
[42:40] hearts aren't just pounding every
[42:41] morning we wake up there is no god you
[42:43] idiot
[42:44] i mean that's not what our heart is
[42:45] doing it's subtle it's slippery
[42:47] it's insidious something that just
[42:49] slowly
[42:50] building in in your heart it's insidious
[42:53] it's sly it's slippery deceitful heart
[42:55] and desperately wicked it just means
[42:57] it's sick
[42:59] it's something it's desperate and
[43:01] desperately wicked is just one word or
[43:02] conveying this it's just
[43:03] it's a sick heart that's desperate it's
[43:05] longing it's agonizing
[43:07] and it's with our heart that we perceive
[43:10] certain opportunities or we actually
[43:11] sent something looming on the horizon
[43:14] either something bad is going to happen
[43:15] or a good opportunity is coming
[43:17] and because we're looking out for
[43:18] certain things and we want certain
[43:20] things to happen and we're
[43:21] constantly analyzing and looking
[43:22] everything our heart begins to plot the
[43:24] course
[43:25] and tell us which way to go and how to
[43:26] act and how to and how to
[43:28] conduct ourselves and it's a desperate
[43:29] heart that's doing it
[43:33] and it's this is i want i
[43:36] i hope that i can express this in a way
[43:38] just to kind of make the point and then
[43:39] move on
[43:40] we trick ourselves it says the heart is
[43:43] desperately wicked
[43:45] and deceitful above all things we trick
[43:47] ourselves
[43:48] and and this is i could get every
[43:52] behavioral economics professor to vouch
[43:55] for this and and
[43:56] sociologists and pretty much anybody in
[43:57] academia has seen enough
[43:59] studies and to where this is a pretty
[44:01] strong theory
[44:03] that what we think will make us happy
[44:06] often doesn't make us happy
[44:09] so we imagine if we could just do this
[44:13] we'll be happy and then once we do this
[44:16] we're not happy so we begin to
[44:18] rationalize
[44:20] well then i've got to do this to be
[44:21] happy
[44:23] and we just get in this uh rat race of
[44:25] always trying to chase down this kind of
[44:26] fulfillment if we
[44:27] just turn the corner if we just do this
[44:29] we just do that i even said this morning
[44:31] i feel like i'm getting ready to turn
[44:33] the corner i'm going to get out of this
[44:34] rut and into a groove i'm
[44:36] finally gonna get caught up you know
[44:37] what monday's still waiting
[44:39] right i obviously just feel like if i
[44:41] could just get through sunday and then
[44:42] you know what i'm gonna be thinking mind
[44:43] if i could just get through wednesday
[44:44] i could i could start doing things i
[44:46] need to do and i gotta get caught up on
[44:47] this
[44:48] and we're just that way in our minds if
[44:50] i could just do
[44:51] this if i could just do that
[44:55] and god even asked the children of
[44:56] israel in isaiah 55 2 wherefore do you
[44:59] spend money
[45:00] for that which is not bread and for your
[45:02] labor for that which satisfies satisfies
[45:04] not
[45:09] why you spend money on things that
[45:10] really don't sustain your life
[45:13] why do you labor for things and spend
[45:15] your money on things and your time your
[45:16] thought and your energy
[45:18] and even your if you could call it free
[45:20] time your recreation why do you pursue
[45:22] things that at the end of the day really
[45:24] don't satisfy
[45:26] it's a great summary general summary of
[45:29] just the dissatisfaction of life the
[45:30] failed expectations in life all the
[45:32] failed promises of natural life
[45:35] wherein labor and pleasure alone is just
[45:37] vanity
[45:39] it's a very it's a sister verse to
[45:40] everything that uh
[45:42] solomon is saying in ecclesiastes
[45:46] and i'll make a couple statements here
[45:47] just make reference to a few things and
[45:49] move on from them
[45:50] and save it save it for wednesday night
[45:52] maybe humans are predictably
[45:54] irrational
[45:57] and that's what's very complicated is
[45:59] because we have certain things that is
[46:01] based upon
[46:02] rationale like a certain there's even in
[46:04] law the reasonable
[46:06] prudent person is is a person that only
[46:09] exists in law
[46:11] and so in law if you're sued for a tort
[46:14] or you've
[46:15] caused some injury and they sue you
[46:16] civilly your conduct is going to be
[46:18] measured by
[46:19] the reasonable prudent person and guess
[46:22] what
[46:22] the reasonable prudent person reads
[46:25] every single word of the terms of
[46:27] service when they buy a new ipad
[46:30] and what does that tell you the
[46:32] reasonable prudent person does not exist
[46:35] he's not out there but yet you're going
[46:36] to be judged by it and so since humans
[46:39] are predictably irrational
[46:41] what they mean by that is our behaviors
[46:43] sometimes lack for explanation
[46:45] like watch this he's going to do that
[46:47] watch this he's going to do that oh he
[46:48] didn't do that
[46:49] why in the world did he not do that and
[46:51] that's the way that we can our behaviors
[46:53] and our
[46:53] our motivations lack the proper
[46:55] explanation they don't have
[46:57] reason behind it and what happens is you
[47:00] could say well this is the way that it
[47:01] should be
[47:02] this is the way things should unfold but
[47:04] just one change in the scenario just the
[47:06] introduction of one variable
[47:08] just one component one thing being
[47:10] changed can completely upset our
[47:11] decisions and our emotions
[47:13] and all of a sudden we're no longer
[47:14] happy anymore
[47:16] you ever heard of the paradox of choice
[47:19] there's still some debate over about
[47:21] whether or not it would be a real valid
[47:23] theory but it certainly has some
[47:24] application
[47:25] and essentially the theory is this that
[47:28] when you when you make a choice the more
[47:29] options you have the more likely you're
[47:31] going to be unhappy with the choice you
[47:32] make
[47:34] so if there's only three colored three
[47:36] different flavors of snow cone you just
[47:37] pick one and you're happy but if there's
[47:39] 30
[47:40] you pick one like i know i should've got
[47:42] tiger's blood
[47:43] you just know it because you don't like
[47:45] this one it's not what you thought it
[47:46] would be their pina colada stinks
[47:49] right and that and you and you'd be all
[47:51] tore up but if you only had tiger's
[47:52] blood pina colada
[47:53] and just cherry you would have got it
[47:55] and you've been happy but it's just the
[47:57] way the mind works
[47:58] i was gonna say this for wednesday night
[47:59] but i'll i'll try to i'll use this
[48:01] example
[48:02] just to just to show you how crazy our
[48:04] minds are
[48:06] you walk into a deli the guy working the
[48:08] counter and he says
[48:09] i like a sandwich he says we only have
[48:11] two sandwiches we got we got turkey and
[48:13] roast beef
[48:13] you go well i'll take the roast beef and
[48:15] also the guy from the back says
[48:17] oh we got ham he goes and then you say
[48:19] okay i'll have turkey
[48:24] that's exactly how the human mind works
[48:26] it's a very simple way to describe
[48:28] how that when you're given the choice
[48:30] between two things you want turkey or
[48:32] roast beef roast beef i love roast beef
[48:34] but then all of a sudden you're told
[48:35] there's ham and you don't wrote
[48:37] you don't want roast beef anymore you
[48:38] want turkey try to explain that
[48:43] and you say really yes really
[48:46] it works and that's just the way that
[48:49] it's just the way our minds are wired
[48:50] and they're still trying to figure that
[48:52] out to this day it's been decades
[48:54] since they've observed this behavior and
[48:55] studied it and done it over and over and
[48:57] over again and replicated this
[48:59] this uh this result they're like why do
[49:01] people think this way
[49:02] why do they act that way i'll come to it
[49:05] hopefully this morning
[49:07] but it's such a powerful force within
[49:09] our minds
[49:11] and here as we have said that we live in
[49:14] a chaotic world but now
[49:16] we have complicated hearts see not only
[49:19] is the world messed up but then our
[49:20] minds are unstable
[49:23] our minds are very complicated and so
[49:26] paul in writing to timothy in second
[49:28] timothy chapter two verses 3 and 4 he
[49:29] says thou therefore endure hardness as a
[49:31] good soldier of jesus christ
[49:33] no man that wareth entangleth himself
[49:35] with the affairs of this life
[49:37] that he may please him who have chosen
[49:39] him to be a soldier
[49:41] just as they tried to entangle jesus to
[49:43] ensnare him or trap him paul is saying
[49:45] don't be entangled with the affairs of
[49:48] this life that means to plat
[49:50] or to braid to weave together don't be
[49:53] improperly twisted together and so woven
[49:55] to the affairs of this life
[49:56] that you're no longer serving christ as
[49:59] you ought to serve him
[50:01] life's affairs he's just talking about
[50:03] the cares and the concerns of natural
[50:05] living
[50:06] he's not saying that they should be
[50:07] disregarded but they shouldn't have
[50:09] preeminence
[50:11] and uses this image of a roman soldier
[50:13] who are these professional soldiers
[50:15] would have been forbidden to marry they
[50:16] were not allowed to engage in another
[50:17] trade or have some other
[50:18] way to be make a living because they
[50:20] were to be singly minded
[50:23] they gave themselves in defense and
[50:25] conquest and that's what they
[50:27] had to do and they didn't want them to
[50:28] be married so that when they're finally
[50:29] i got a wife and children at home
[50:31] i don't want to risk myself or i'm
[50:33] making more money here i want to
[50:34] preserve this fortune
[50:36] that he wanted them to be singular in
[50:37] their aim towards their kingdom and
[50:39] towards their
[50:40] their pharaoh their their caesar and
[50:42] likewise paul is saying that our aim or
[50:44] our goal is not to please man
[50:46] not to seek riches not to have comforts
[50:48] but rather to please christ
[50:51] we're not trying to make our lives
[50:52] easier we're not trying to accumulate
[50:53] wealth we just simply
[50:55] want to live to please christ and it's
[50:58] our divided minds our divided pursuits
[51:00] and our double minds
[51:02] that allow for all these worldly con
[51:04] concerns to consume us
[51:06] what do they do they tie us up they make
[51:09] us feel trapped he says be
[51:10] not entangled with the affairs of this
[51:12] life don't be woven together don't be so
[51:14] mixed together where you can't extricate
[51:15] yourself to where it has an
[51:16] influence to you there's a word that's
[51:18] used in the new testament about being
[51:19] entangled in the yoke of bondage
[51:21] and it implies that you're wearing it
[51:23] like a straight jacket and you're
[51:24] fighting against it and you're wrestling
[51:25] with it don't let the affairs of this
[51:27] life
[51:28] become something you're constantly
[51:29] wrestling with
[51:31] to where that becomes your singular
[51:32] pursuit there's so many different issues
[51:35] that we can kind of get
[51:36] sucked into and wrapped up in so many
[51:38] things that uh
[51:39] dominate our time and our our
[51:40] conversations and induce it only just
[51:42] creates tension
[51:43] and it only creates moral dilemmas and
[51:45] and questions of ethics and well what is
[51:47] the right thing to do
[51:48] and listen we're being brought into
[51:49] debates and thought processes
[51:51] that we don't even have to engage in
[51:54] there's things we're pondering things
[51:56] we're trying to figure out things we're
[51:57] trying to make sense of and the lord's
[51:59] saying you don't have to worry about
[52:01] that
[52:01] there's no reason you need to get caught
[52:03] up in that just keep doing what you're
[52:04] supposed to do
[52:05] live for me serve me follow my
[52:07] leadership don't get so consumed with
[52:09] those things
[52:12] later on in that chapter paul says it
[52:14] this way just to
[52:15] express why he should not be woven and
[52:18] planted and weave it together and
[52:19] twisted with all these different things
[52:21] he says in verse 23 but foolish and
[52:23] unlearned questions
[52:24] avoid knowing that they do gender
[52:27] strifes
[52:29] life is complex on its own but all the
[52:32] unnecessary
[52:34] distractions and decisions make it
[52:36] complicated
[52:38] those are the things that are
[52:39] complicated in our life not
[52:42] not the word not our simplicity towards
[52:44] the word
[52:46] there he says endure hardness so it's
[52:47] going to be suffering there's going to
[52:48] be affliction
[52:49] but the the complication comes with all
[52:51] these other things the foolish the
[52:53] and unlearned questions there's no
[52:54] wisdom in the question there's really no
[52:56] foundation in the word
[52:57] a foolish and unlearned question is
[52:58] useless there's really no point to it or
[53:01] no edification to it
[53:03] and he says it only leads to strife puts
[53:05] people at variance
[53:08] only causes contention and competition
[53:10] causes the quarreling or disputing with
[53:12] somebody else
[53:13] and even a variance within yourself
[53:16] and in doing so it robs us of peace
[53:19] this should be the theme of many
[53:20] people's thanksgiving dinner but foolish
[53:23] and unlearned questions avoid
[53:26] why because just the slightest thing
[53:27] could come up and all of a sudden
[53:28] everyone
[53:29] gets sucked into it if you know what
[53:31] people are mad at each other and
[53:33] leaving and flipping the table over and
[53:35] yelling at one another
[53:37] and it's like man just a moment ago we
[53:38] were all in tears i love you this is so
[53:40] awesome and then also you start debating
[53:43] something you start getting sucked into
[53:44] something
[53:45] and people get polarized very very
[53:46] quickly and you actually get put in is
[53:49] they tried to trap jesus and jesus
[53:50] basically
[53:51] you're trying to put me in a camp as
[53:53] soon as you put me here these people are
[53:54] going to try to hate me
[53:56] and as soon as you put me here these
[53:57] people are going to try to do it so he
[53:58] just kind of said why don't you look at
[53:59] the coin and tell me what you think
[54:02] and was able to do it in such a way
[54:03] where he could avoid to be that's the
[54:04] wisdom we need
[54:06] you could avoid being put in any kind of
[54:08] camp
[54:10] and what this questions and these
[54:12] arguments and these thoughts and all
[54:13] these scenarios that we begin to dream
[54:15] up ourselves maybe it's not even
[54:16] somebody asking us a question maybe
[54:17] we're just doing it to ourselves
[54:18] i wonder if how what about it robs us of
[54:24] our inner peace
[54:27] in john chapter 12 we'll start with
[54:29] verse two
[54:31] we read this in the beginning with our
[54:33] our text
[54:34] there that made him a supper and martha
[54:36] served but lazarus was one of them that
[54:39] sat at the table with him
[54:41] then took mary a pound of ointment and
[54:43] spikenard
[54:44] very costly and anointed the feet of
[54:47] jesus
[54:49] and wiped his feet with her hair and the
[54:52] house was
[54:52] filled with the odor of the ointment
[54:55] isn't that a beautiful picture
[54:58] wonderful picture considering how that
[54:59] just in chapter 11
[55:02] her brother lazarus was raised from the
[55:04] dead
[55:05] that there had been this revelation
[55:07] break forth that not just will he rise
[55:09] in the resurrection but that christ is
[55:11] the resurrection and the life
[55:13] this was not just some man introduced
[55:15] well you know um
[55:16] you know mary well this is her son and
[55:18] you know that's the niece of elizabeth
[55:20] and and the in the cousin to john and
[55:22] it's like oh
[55:23] oh come on in let me let's make you some
[55:26] cheesesteaks
[55:27] it was it was like they knew this guy
[55:28] was this is the christ this is the
[55:30] messiah
[55:31] and there's this reverence and there's
[55:32] this worship that's due to him and
[55:34] it ought to have even been understood by
[55:36] any bystander
[55:37] like this guy just raised her brother
[55:39] from the dead you know let her let her
[55:41] worship
[55:42] i i don't understand it i'm not really
[55:44] you know i was kind of just one of those
[55:45] mourners that went along one of the jews
[55:46] that kind of went along
[55:48] just to see what was going to happen and
[55:49] so i understand where she's coming from
[55:52] i may not have the same unction or
[55:53] desire to do it but this was something
[55:55] that made sense even to the observer who
[55:57] knew what had just happened
[55:58] and she's pouring a pound of ointment of
[56:00] spikenard a pound
[56:03] does young living have spikenerd doterra
[56:06] has spikenard okay i'm changing camps oh
[56:08] young living good great i'm in both
[56:10] camps
[56:11] just look at the bottle whose bottle is
[56:13] it then render under the bottle's name
[56:18] a pound of spikenard and very costly
[56:22] this is not cheap oil
[56:24] i know the roads like the rose oil for
[56:25] young living is like 300
[56:28] i mean that's that's expensive stuff i'm
[56:29] starting a rose garden
[56:32] and anointed the feet of jesus and it is
[56:35] so much oil
[56:37] the whole house could smell it somebody
[56:39] cook a spike nerd
[56:40] i mean it was everywhere and says then
[56:43] with this beautiful picture
[56:45] then saith one of his disciples judas
[56:47] iscariot you know simon's son the one
[56:49] that's going to betray christ
[56:52] he says why was not this ointment sold
[56:55] for 300
[56:56] pence and given to the poor
[57:01] now this is the question let's go back
[57:04] to the beginning how the fall start
[57:05] with a question
[57:09] and what judas does in this scenario is
[57:11] he asked a question and asking the
[57:13] question he actually offers additional
[57:15] information
[57:17] but what is he doing he's questioning
[57:19] her actions
[57:21] he's questioning whether or not she
[57:22] should be worshiping jesus he's
[57:24] questioning
[57:24] how she's doing he's just questioning
[57:26] and he wants to offer more information
[57:29] as he asks the question and initially as
[57:31] i was pointed out our minds would not be
[57:33] divided by her expression of love and
[57:34] worship
[57:35] as christians today we just simply say
[57:37] she's worshiping jesus christ
[57:39] all worship is due to him there's no
[57:41] reason to question what she's doing
[57:44] even a critic could say hey to each his
[57:46] own she wants to worship his feet let
[57:48] her have at it
[57:49] right right i mean even a critic could
[57:51] say she's free to do whatever she wants
[57:53] it's her oil
[57:54] it's their house let her worship jesus
[57:57] as she wants but judas adds another
[57:59] dimension to it
[58:02] this was just worship of jesus christ
[58:04] who had just raised her brother lazarus
[58:06] he's come into their home they've
[58:07] received him she's pouring out oil she's
[58:09] pouring out
[58:10] and she's washing his feet and using her
[58:12] hair to do so
[58:14] and now he adds another dimension he's
[58:15] saying no don't you realize how
[58:17] extravagant this
[58:18] is and in order to bring the contrast he
[58:21] says do you realize
[58:22] the value of everything she he just she
[58:24] just poured out on his feet
[58:26] it's worth 300 pence i think he probably
[58:28] went on stockx real quick and say look
[58:30] it's going for 300 pence right now
[58:33] so we know we can sell this for 300
[58:35] pence i just checked the futures on
[58:38] spikenard
[58:38] this thing is 300 pence and we could
[58:41] have sold it and taken the 300 pence and
[58:44] now notice how the rationale unfolds
[58:46] and if you recall we were using this in
[58:48] the when we we're preaching on who is
[58:50] thy neighbor
[58:51] he takes this rationale now and extends
[58:53] it this is how much it's worth and
[58:55] instead of them saying oh my goodness
[58:57] she poured out that upon our lord he
[58:59] says and we could have had a more
[59:01] prudent use of that
[59:04] in other words you know all you need is
[59:06] just a tablespoon of spikenet on the
[59:08] feet
[59:08] because the pores and the big toe are so
[59:10] big that it'll just
[59:12] right into your forehead as soon as it
[59:13] gets on your big toe and all you need is
[59:15] just a little bit
[59:17] all you need is just a little bit i'm
[59:18] not losing everybody who uses lavender
[59:20] oil now am i
[59:21] stay with me brother michael but all you
[59:24] need is a little bit to get the feet wet
[59:27] and we could have she could have just
[59:28] used a little bit sold the rest
[59:31] and use the rest for 300 pence and given
[59:34] it to the poor the weight of that is in
[59:36] other words we could have sold this
[59:37] pound of spider and supported a family
[59:38] for a whole year
[59:41] it was a whole year's living wage not
[59:43] just getting by not with food stamps and
[59:44] government help this was to
[59:46] live completely off of for a whole year
[59:51] and so it starts out as a very simple
[59:54] offer of worship and just an act of
[59:56] faith and just living for christ
[59:59] judas poses this question and now we
[1:00:01] have a moral quandary
[1:00:03] why should so much be given to jesus
[1:00:06] when it could be better spent after all
[1:00:10] it does say in the bible and it does say
[1:00:13] right this is the rationale jesus judas
[1:00:15] is supposing
[1:00:17] that hey i'm not questioning whether or
[1:00:19] not jesus deserves the spike nerd
[1:00:22] but that much that far that extreme
[1:00:25] shouldn't some moderation couldn't we
[1:00:26] used a different oil because really at
[1:00:28] the end of the day isn't it just a
[1:00:29] matter of doing it and just kind of
[1:00:31] getting it done
[1:00:32] it doesn't really matter how you're
[1:00:33] baptized doesn't matter how you do this
[1:00:35] it's just a matter of doing it
[1:00:37] this is kind of his attitude towards it
[1:00:39] but then he says so now we have this
[1:00:41] quandary why should so much be why
[1:00:43] should've done it couldn't we've had
[1:00:44] better spent this that's right to care
[1:00:46] for the widow and care for the poor and
[1:00:47] visit the fatherless this is what we
[1:00:49] ought to do this is religion this is
[1:00:50] what we're taught
[1:00:51] this would be a better use of the money
[1:00:53] but notice what you're being asked to do
[1:00:55] notice how sly and subtle it is
[1:00:58] and i love it john the writer verse six
[1:01:02] he he wants us to know in verse five
[1:01:04] verse
[1:01:06] four that this is the betrayer and i
[1:01:09] thank god he told us a little bit more
[1:01:10] about what
[1:01:11] was going on in judas's head this he
[1:01:13] said not because he cared for the poor
[1:01:17] but because he was a thief and had the
[1:01:19] bag
[1:01:21] and bear what was in the bag don't you
[1:01:23] love john
[1:01:25] judas asked the question not because he
[1:01:27] cared for the poor
[1:01:28] but because he wanted the money he saw
[1:01:30] an opportunity
[1:01:31] hmm and if she would just sold that we'd
[1:01:35] got 300 pence and that would have gone
[1:01:37] in the bag and i could have used what
[1:01:38] was in the bag
[1:01:40] john is exposing what's in judas's heart
[1:01:43] he didn't really
[1:01:44] really really care about the poor he
[1:01:47] didn't really really care about their
[1:01:49] economic status he didn't really care
[1:01:50] about whether or not they'd be taken
[1:01:51] care of but there was some kind of
[1:01:53] agenda some kind of lobby some kind of
[1:01:55] belief system some kind of motivation to
[1:01:57] him that he would particularly benefit
[1:01:59] by that's why i don't trust petition
[1:02:02] politicians on either side of the aisle
[1:02:05] there's a lot of the green
[1:02:07] policies that they support and we need
[1:02:08] to go green we go green but the effects
[1:02:10] of those policies are very very
[1:02:12] detrimental
[1:02:13] to the poor class and those on welfare
[1:02:15] and the minorities who need help
[1:02:17] who need infrastructure changes who need
[1:02:19] some attention there's things that need
[1:02:20] to be done on that
[1:02:21] and they'll lift this end up like we
[1:02:23] need to do this when you do this and
[1:02:24] then support other policies on the other
[1:02:25] that completely are anti-portal and
[1:02:27] contradict what they're trying to do on
[1:02:29] the other if you think
[1:02:30] what's motivating them to do that
[1:02:33] you think i'm just bashing on the levels
[1:02:34] don't get started on the republicans
[1:02:36] don't have time
[1:02:39] really for any of them but he says he
[1:02:43] does this
[1:02:44] because he wanted to take advantage
[1:02:49] of the exchange
[1:02:52] and so the discernment here gives us a
[1:02:54] motive helps us
[1:02:55] understand the motive and understanding
[1:02:58] the motive it gives context to the
[1:02:59] question
[1:03:00] and now that we know what's behind the
[1:03:02] question in reality you don't have to
[1:03:04] answer it
[1:03:06] you're not even obligated to answer it
[1:03:08] well just hear me out
[1:03:10] couldn't that be done and if you did
[1:03:13] this wouldn't it be better
[1:03:14] in the end once you know the motive you
[1:03:16] don't even know that oh an
[1:03:17] answer and that's what this is a
[1:03:20] question that did not need to be
[1:03:21] answered
[1:03:22] it's a blatant misuse of a fact to lead
[1:03:24] a person to a different thought or
[1:03:26] conviction could it sell for 300 pence
[1:03:28] yes it can
[1:03:29] google it it'll sell for 300 pence and
[1:03:31] then that fact is now
[1:03:32] used to try to get you in your mind to
[1:03:35] let go of what god
[1:03:36] of the worship that was being given to
[1:03:38] christ change your thought change your
[1:03:39] conviction
[1:03:41] and this is exactly the approach that
[1:03:42] satan took in the garden the exact same
[1:03:44] approach that he took
[1:03:46] he offered knowledge without context
[1:03:49] he he sold her a lie he used a question
[1:03:52] and then a lie
[1:03:52] and using that question and then that
[1:03:54] lie forcing her to answer to engage in
[1:03:56] the debate to gauge into the the
[1:03:58] the analysis and the conversation about
[1:04:01] it
[1:04:01] is all it took to cause her faith to
[1:04:03] drop enough to be defiled
[1:04:08] it was a choice she was presented a
[1:04:11] choice that she should have
[1:04:12] never had to ponder she was asked to
[1:04:15] consider something that
[1:04:17] she would have never she never needed to
[1:04:19] consider
[1:04:21] i mean she could have said just go ask
[1:04:22] my husband
[1:04:24] i mean it was just something she didn't
[1:04:26] even need to answer she said it's asked
[1:04:27] and answered serpent
[1:04:29] you know what god said this is what the
[1:04:32] word says
[1:04:35] and it was a misuse judas uses misuses
[1:04:38] the fact but when you get to the heart
[1:04:40] of the question it's not an honest
[1:04:41] question
[1:04:45] i i'm going to skip
[1:04:48] if you want to if you want to go to
[1:04:52] luke chapter 10 at the very end
[1:05:07] i'll just i'll just skip to this in
[1:05:15] because it offers us a different
[1:05:16] perspective of john chapter 12.
[1:05:21] because in john chapter 12 it's i said
[1:05:23] that's the world's question
[1:05:26] that's the world that confronts
[1:05:29] confronts us and tries to get us to
[1:05:31] reconsider and to ponder and shake us up
[1:05:33] and make us lose conviction and
[1:05:35] cause us confusion and complication
[1:05:38] but in luke chapter 10 verses 38 and
[1:05:42] we'll read to verse 42 it says now it
[1:05:44] came to pass as they went that
[1:05:45] he entered into a certain village we
[1:05:47] know that this is bethany and a certain
[1:05:49] woman named martha received him into her
[1:05:51] house we know that lazarus
[1:05:53] sat with him at the table to commune
[1:05:54] with him and it said in john that mary
[1:05:57] served and she had a sister called mary
[1:05:59] excuse martha served and it was mary now
[1:06:01] it says and she had a sister called mary
[1:06:03] which
[1:06:03] also sat at jesus feet and heard his
[1:06:06] word
[1:06:07] and martha was cumbered about much
[1:06:10] serving that means to be drawn away to
[1:06:11] be distracted
[1:06:13] she was driven about mentally she was
[1:06:14] over occupied to be cumbered about it
[1:06:16] was too busy
[1:06:17] she was too busy about a thing too
[1:06:19] preoccupied about a thing it was
[1:06:20] dominating her thoughts
[1:06:22] and so she was cumbered about much
[1:06:24] serving and johnny just says she was
[1:06:26] serving that didn't
[1:06:27] didn't seem ominous to us but now this
[1:06:29] writer and luke is wanting to understand
[1:06:31] that maybe she was too fixated on it she
[1:06:33] was too distracted by it
[1:06:35] she was too given into the domestic
[1:06:36] duties and the things that she needed to
[1:06:38] do as a host
[1:06:40] and it creates this conflict within her
[1:06:42] and said lord
[1:06:43] dost thou not care that my sister hath
[1:06:45] left me to serve
[1:06:46] alone don't you care that i'm the only
[1:06:49] one in the kitchen
[1:06:50] i'm the only one i'm hacking the lamb
[1:06:53] i'm the only one that's making the bread
[1:06:54] i'm the only one that's preparing the
[1:06:56] olives i'm the only one doing all these
[1:06:58] things
[1:06:58] it's me i'm all by myself and so she
[1:07:00] assumes that jesus can say yeah i care
[1:07:02] get in there mary he says bid her
[1:07:04] therefore that she helped me
[1:07:07] do you not care that my sister's not
[1:07:09] doing anything to help around the house
[1:07:11] would you tell her to help me with
[1:07:12] things around the house to do a better
[1:07:14] job domestically to pull her weight in
[1:07:16] the home
[1:07:17] and so she's asked a question now this
[1:07:20] the
[1:07:20] this question is interesting because
[1:07:21] it's not coming from judas
[1:07:24] it's coming from martha she's in the
[1:07:26] house she's one that's received them
[1:07:28] she's not
[1:07:28] she's not in the same uh if john was
[1:07:30] writing this he would have had good
[1:07:31] things probably to say
[1:07:32] more to say other than she i guess he
[1:07:34] was nice enough to not say she was
[1:07:35] comfortable she just said she's serving
[1:07:38] right but judas on the other hand we get
[1:07:39] the full picture he's the betrayer
[1:07:42] and he's a thief he doesn't really care
[1:07:44] about the poor he's just asking the
[1:07:45] question to cause conflict
[1:07:47] to gain himself a dishonest question for
[1:07:50] personal gain
[1:07:51] and now here's another question the same
[1:07:53] scenario the same house
[1:07:55] in the same narrative a question is
[1:07:58] asked do you care that my sister has
[1:07:59] left me to serve alone
[1:08:02] and there's something about this
[1:08:04] question that exposes something
[1:08:06] in martha's heart a disorder of
[1:08:09] priorities
[1:08:11] in asking the question it actually
[1:08:12] betrays something in her mind
[1:08:14] how she's divided in her mind the wrong
[1:08:17] kind of attitude
[1:08:18] because she's busy serving there's
[1:08:19] nothing wrong with serving
[1:08:21] but something in her heart wasn't right
[1:08:23] something in her
[1:08:24] in her mind was not right
[1:08:27] she was doing the right thing to serve
[1:08:29] but her service had become complicated
[1:08:32] she could no longer see that what she
[1:08:34] was doing was likewise for the one that
[1:08:36] was in the house
[1:08:39] it got complicated to where she wasn't
[1:08:40] doing it as unto the lord
[1:08:42] she needed her sister to come hell
[1:08:43] because now it was a chore and now it
[1:08:45] was a duty and now things had to get
[1:08:46] done
[1:08:46] and it was only important that it looked
[1:08:48] right and it felt right and everything
[1:08:49] was in perfectly in order and it's the
[1:08:50] whole instagram picture we're trying to
[1:08:52] create for our guest
[1:08:53] and it's this pressure and she's feeling
[1:08:54] the pressure and it wasn't wrong for her
[1:08:56] to do everything she was doing as john
[1:08:58] says
[1:08:58] marth absurd but now luke tells she's
[1:09:00] cumbered about what they're serving
[1:09:02] and it means her service had become very
[1:09:04] complicated it lost its focus and it
[1:09:06] even lost its purpose
[1:09:09] because she was no longer singularly
[1:09:10] focused
[1:09:13] and so jesus answers in verse 41
[1:09:17] and said unto her martha martha thou art
[1:09:20] careful and troubled
[1:09:22] about many things you're worried about
[1:09:25] so much
[1:09:26] you've got so much you're worried about
[1:09:28] that you're
[1:09:29] you're just you come to you stress out
[1:09:31] over everything
[1:09:33] you're worried about so many things that
[1:09:35] now i show up in your home
[1:09:36] and now you're worried about this
[1:09:40] it's not just the serving in the home
[1:09:42] but maybe it was something indicative of
[1:09:44] her whole heart
[1:09:45] martha martha thou art careful and
[1:09:47] troubled
[1:09:48] about many things
[1:09:51] but one thing is needful
[1:09:55] we could be troubled about many things
[1:09:57] we can be cumbered with serving
[1:09:58] but only one thing is needful and he
[1:10:01] says and mary have chosen that good part
[1:10:05] which shall not be taken away from her
[1:10:10] mary chose the good part
[1:10:13] the good part was even questioned
[1:10:17] the length of the good part the breath
[1:10:18] of the good part the depth of the good
[1:10:20] part
[1:10:20] everything she did in giving of her oil
[1:10:23] and worshiping jesus and pouring all
[1:10:24] that oil upon her feet
[1:10:25] that was questioned that was ridiculed
[1:10:28] that was made fun of that was
[1:10:30] that was something that to them uh to
[1:10:32] judah said oh this is a waste this is
[1:10:33] too much
[1:10:34] but now even it's not the world just
[1:10:36] questioning now it's something within
[1:10:38] her family within even her
[1:10:39] with right there in their own home now
[1:10:41] there's somebody else questioning do you
[1:10:42] not care that my sister hath left me to
[1:10:44] serve alone
[1:10:45] i would rather put us in this spot now
[1:10:47] if there's any kind of correction
[1:10:48] or any way that you could be rebuked or
[1:10:50] or put on the right path i'm not fearful
[1:10:52] that you would be a judas but maybe we
[1:10:54] can be more
[1:10:55] martha-like we cumbered with too much
[1:10:58] serving
[1:10:59] and we've lost the real focus of
[1:11:00] everything we're doing and the real
[1:11:02] reason why we're doing it and when that
[1:11:03] happens we lose the focus
[1:11:05] everything begins to be confusing and it
[1:11:07] gets complicated real fast
[1:11:10] one thing is needful and mary have
[1:11:11] chosen that good part which shall not be
[1:11:13] taken
[1:11:14] away from her
[1:11:18] i say we choose the good part not that
[1:11:21] we would leave the other undone
[1:11:22] but that we wouldn't leave this undone
[1:11:25] choose the good part
[1:11:26] give the do that is to christ to make
[1:11:28] him welcome in our homes
[1:11:30] one thing is needful
[1:11:33] so we read it wednesday night what's
[1:11:34] going to help there's only one thing
[1:11:36] needful get back to christ
[1:11:38] that's it it's the only thing that's
[1:11:39] going to satisfy it's the only way that
[1:11:41] marriages are going to
[1:11:42] work as efficiently and harmoniously as
[1:11:44] they can it's the only way that families
[1:11:46] are going to be in their proper place
[1:11:47] it's the only way they're going to be
[1:11:48] able to make sense of this life
[1:11:50] is when we have the word as our time
[1:11:52] post and our faith is
[1:11:53] projected to the word and that's our
[1:11:55] absolute that's the only way
[1:11:56] that the complications of this life are
[1:11:58] going to be resolved
[1:12:02] and our complex lives become complicated
[1:12:04] when we're distracted from christ
[1:12:08] and the woman in the beginning was
[1:12:10] pulled away from the tree of life
[1:12:12] how through a question and a lie
[1:12:16] and the tactics haven't changed ask a
[1:12:20] question
[1:12:21] pose a fact get us to wrestle with it
[1:12:24] become divided in our minds and then
[1:12:26] life gets complicated
[1:12:28] there's so many different issues that in
[1:12:30] our minds maybe we believe them to be
[1:12:31] very very cut and dry
[1:12:34] when i say issues i mean ones that uh
[1:12:37] don't even pertain to the word
[1:12:40] but if you really ever dove right down
[1:12:42] into it and tried to get your head
[1:12:43] around it and understand it you realize
[1:12:45] it is not as cut and dry as i thought it
[1:12:47] was the things that so
[1:12:49] polarize some people and they're in
[1:12:50] distinct camps once you really start
[1:12:52] unpacking the facts about it and the
[1:12:54] choices that it relates to
[1:12:55] and who it impacts and who's behind it
[1:12:57] and what the rationality is you realize
[1:12:59] wow they made it seem like it was just
[1:13:01] here's the devil over here and here's
[1:13:02] god over there which side do you choose
[1:13:04] like well i think i'm gonna side with
[1:13:05] god
[1:13:06] and then you start digging in and you're
[1:13:07] like no there's so much more to it than
[1:13:09] i was told
[1:13:10] and there's some things you just don't
[1:13:12] need to know
[1:13:13] some things you don't need to try to
[1:13:14] figure out some things you don't need to
[1:13:17] try to pursue and figure out which side
[1:13:18] you're going to be on which bumper
[1:13:19] sticker you're going to wear
[1:13:20] just don't get caught up in it
[1:13:24] and uh and to bring it back to what i
[1:13:26] feel is i've skipped a lot we're going
[1:13:28] to have plenty of time to get to this
[1:13:30] and if we don't that means we're going
[1:13:31] getting out of here
[1:13:32] like meeting in the air wrap up business
[1:13:34] here come back for the millennium that
[1:13:36] can be awesome
[1:13:37] that's what we're living for right
[1:13:39] that's what we're not we're not here to
[1:13:40] try to figure out how this church can be
[1:13:41] here in another hundred years
[1:13:43] we want to preach the word in such a way
[1:13:45] to we we're accelerating the timeline
[1:13:48] we're doing everything we can we're
[1:13:49] putting our shoulder to the wheel to all
[1:13:50] the other churches that are preaching
[1:13:51] this gospel
[1:13:52] getting behind the word of god lifting
[1:13:54] up jesus christ that it can draw men
[1:13:55] unto him so that we can get out of here
[1:13:58] not preaching just to build a church
[1:13:59] that has a legacy uh
[1:14:01] hundreds of years from now and find the
[1:14:03] right corner to build a big building on
[1:14:05] but no we want to get out of this world
[1:14:07] we want a translation and so to try to
[1:14:10] bring this
[1:14:10] into the context of what we are
[1:14:12] ministering even on the family
[1:14:14] in mentioning family and relationships
[1:14:16] and our relationships to one another and
[1:14:17] our marriages and
[1:14:18] raising our children i'm you i'm wanting
[1:14:21] just to set the
[1:14:22] give you the context that this is the
[1:14:24] world and this is the climate that we're
[1:14:26] raising our families in
[1:14:29] that if this was little house on the
[1:14:30] prairie i mean the preacher would be
[1:14:32] complicating it
[1:14:33] right all you got to worry about is that
[1:14:35] one blond-haired girl that was the bully
[1:14:36] and
[1:14:36] all you got to worry about is the
[1:14:37] indians on the other side of the hill
[1:14:39] and you'd be able to just figure out who
[1:14:40] the
[1:14:41] the nemesis are and and who the
[1:14:44] kids you need to worry about and you
[1:14:45] knew winter was coming and it would seem
[1:14:47] like this is a complex life but it's
[1:14:48] simple we've got to figure out we don't
[1:14:50] live in that day anymore
[1:14:53] we're raising children in a time when
[1:14:55] it's you can't keep the world away
[1:14:58] there was a time that you could raise
[1:15:00] children in truth you could raise them
[1:15:02] in in the light of this message
[1:15:03] and the circle of your fellowship and
[1:15:06] those you rub shoulders with
[1:15:07] and and the things that you're
[1:15:09] influenced by you could just kind of
[1:15:10] keep it
[1:15:11] this balance within your social life
[1:15:12] this balance within your professional
[1:15:14] life a balance within home life and even
[1:15:16] with respect to school christian camps
[1:15:19] and different things that you could
[1:15:20] participate in
[1:15:21] and there was just a way that you could
[1:15:22] walk seemingly free from all the
[1:15:24] influences and the nastiness and the
[1:15:26] perversions of this world
[1:15:27] but now it's everywhere
[1:15:30] that there's no distance from it there's
[1:15:32] no separation and
[1:15:34] and the world is ferocious
[1:15:38] anymore we kind of feel a little bit shy
[1:15:40] about what we believe because we don't
[1:15:41] want to be the next viral
[1:15:42] phenomenon guess what this person
[1:15:44] believes go ahead tell me hon
[1:15:46] what do you believe tell the camera this
[1:15:48] is going on tick tock
[1:15:51] right that this is this is kind of
[1:15:53] pressure that we live under anymore
[1:15:55] and it's just suffocating it's all
[1:15:56] around us i want you to realize that if
[1:15:58] that this is the world we're living in
[1:16:00] this is the time that we're living
[1:16:02] as it relates to laodicea but don't
[1:16:04] forget we are living in a bright age
[1:16:06] those who love laodicea those who want
[1:16:08] laodicea they can have laodicea
[1:16:11] i've got my bright age i've got this
[1:16:12] time in my life where i'm being united
[1:16:15] to the word of god i'm being guided by
[1:16:16] his holy spirit i'm looking at a promise
[1:16:19] we've got the the
[1:16:20] power of god amongst us we've got the
[1:16:21] the gifts of the spirit the
[1:16:23] the the promises of the word of god
[1:16:25] these are the things that we believe in
[1:16:26] this is what we live by but i'm
[1:16:28] reminding you we live in a nasty
[1:16:30] evil world it's important for us to
[1:16:34] realize that god gave us the world
[1:16:35] the word to navigate the age we're
[1:16:37] living in
[1:16:40] and there's this story of mary and
[1:16:41] martha to me presents such a wonderful
[1:16:44] context
[1:16:45] for how the world on one end begins to
[1:16:47] attack us but it does it dishonestly
[1:16:48] to cause us to shake in our minds to get
[1:16:50] us worried to cause us doubt
[1:16:52] doubt and fear and that's what creeped
[1:16:53] into the woman in the beginning was
[1:16:55] doubt
[1:16:56] that was how that's how satan motivates
[1:16:58] through fear
[1:17:00] and that's what dominated her thinking
[1:17:02] immediately she was fearful what did she
[1:17:03] get fearful of that she was missing out
[1:17:06] what caused the woman that the fear of
[1:17:08] regret
[1:17:09] well if i don't then maybe i'm going to
[1:17:13] be missing out on something
[1:17:14] if i don't i may regret it
[1:17:18] it's all it took to cause her to act
[1:17:22] is to be pulled away from the tree of
[1:17:24] life by questioning a lie
[1:17:26] if you go back to the quote before
[1:17:28] brother john in the trial like to end
[1:17:30] with this brother mike if you could come
[1:17:35] in the sermon of trial he puts on trial
[1:17:38] the prosecutor which is the devil
[1:17:42] puts on trial though the word
[1:17:46] and he brings mr impatient mr skeptic
[1:17:48] and mr unbeliever mr unbeliever
[1:17:50] testifies i don't believe it
[1:17:53] mr impatient you know won't wait long
[1:17:55] enough and the skeptic
[1:17:56] yeah is not sure if that's really what
[1:17:58] was supposed to happen
[1:17:59] but notice what he says now it came to
[1:18:01] pass excuse me satan did not
[1:18:03] the prosecutor did not misinterpret the
[1:18:06] whole thing
[1:18:07] he just misinterpreted a word or so and
[1:18:11] it caused death to strike the whole
[1:18:12] earth
[1:18:14] and every hospital every siren ever rung
[1:18:17] every death ever died every struggle
[1:18:20] every man on the battlefield every poor
[1:18:22] little sick afflicted baby and all was
[1:18:25] caused
[1:18:26] by disbelieving just one word
[1:18:29] of god's word i mean the sentence could
[1:18:32] have been much longer
[1:18:33] but think about everything we wrestle
[1:18:35] with today all the considerations all
[1:18:37] the pains all the problems all the
[1:18:38] circumstances all the scenarios
[1:18:40] all the moral dilemmas all the ethical
[1:18:42] quandaries all these things that be
[1:18:43] presented to us
[1:18:44] it all happened because one word was
[1:18:46] disbelieved
[1:18:47] the complicated life we live in this
[1:18:49] ferocious lail to see in age this wicked
[1:18:51] ridiculous age we live in
[1:18:53] what is it it is the result of one word
[1:18:56] being disbelieved
[1:18:58] i i know that may seem hard for some
[1:18:59] people to really accept but that's just
[1:19:00] the reality of it
[1:19:07] caused by disbelieving just one word of
[1:19:09] god's word
[1:19:10] and if it caused all of this for
[1:19:12] disbelieving one word
[1:19:14] how are you going to get back
[1:19:15] disbelieving one word
[1:19:23] it was how are you going to get back to
[1:19:25] the beginning
[1:19:27] by disbelieving one word
[1:19:31] and we're not going to press rewind
[1:19:34] because to press rewind we have to go
[1:19:36] through all the sickness every death on
[1:19:38] the battlefield
[1:19:39] every siren wrong every death
[1:19:42] but we just take the opposite this is
[1:19:44] something we have to learn to do as
[1:19:46] believers
[1:19:47] what he's saying here is everything that
[1:19:49] exists in the world today
[1:19:50] that's bad that's negative that's
[1:19:53] detrimental that tears us down that
[1:19:55] confuses us that causes the anxiety and
[1:19:57] the depression
[1:19:58] all these things they all were caused by
[1:20:01] disbelieving one word
[1:20:04] this complicated life is the result of
[1:20:06] disbelieving one word
[1:20:07] so what's the way to resolve the the
[1:20:10] complications
[1:20:12] believe the word believe the word that's
[1:20:14] your way back to simplicity
[1:20:16] you don't have to figure out the the
[1:20:18] labyrinth that is all these things that
[1:20:20] brother brown's just talking about all
[1:20:21] these things that are masked together
[1:20:22] how do we make sense of hospitals we
[1:20:24] have decisions now that we have to make
[1:20:26] that you would have never had to make
[1:20:27] before
[1:20:28] should i get a heart transplant well if
[1:20:30] you don't get a heart transplant you're
[1:20:32] going to die
[1:20:33] well who am i going to get the heart
[1:20:34] from whose heart am i going to be
[1:20:36] putting in me
[1:20:38] what kind of life did they live did they
[1:20:39] smoke
[1:20:41] did they stay faithful to their wife i
[1:20:43] mean that's a real that's a terrible dis
[1:20:45] place to be in where you really really
[1:20:47] need a heart transplant
[1:20:49] and you you have the moral dilemma now
[1:20:51] should i even get one
[1:20:52] because i don't know what's going on in
[1:20:54] this this other guy's heart who it was
[1:20:56] that died and what kind of
[1:20:57] impact this could have upon me but do
[1:20:59] you realize science has put you in a
[1:21:01] place now where that's a decision you
[1:21:02] have to make
[1:21:03] could you imagine you know talking about
[1:21:04] this with somebody from the 1700s yeah
[1:21:07] i just don't know whether i should get a
[1:21:08] heart transplant like
[1:21:10] what is that what does that even mean
[1:21:12] just drill a hole in your head you'll be
[1:21:14] all right
[1:21:17] it's this is we live in an age where now
[1:21:20] across the board there's only so many
[1:21:22] things we have to consider
[1:21:23] so many things we have to try to figure
[1:21:25] out it's but he's made it easy for us
[1:21:27] only believe that's where we start
[1:21:31] only believe if you're wrestling with
[1:21:34] worldliness
[1:21:35] take him by at his word give your heart
[1:21:37] to him
[1:21:39] this word is true this word is the joy
[1:21:42] you've been searching for it's the
[1:21:43] acceptance you've been longing for it's
[1:21:44] the place where you belong it's the
[1:21:45] place where you finally can let
[1:21:47] relax and say you know what i found home
[1:21:49] i found where i belong this this is this
[1:21:51] is living
[1:21:52] and you can do that as a young person
[1:21:53] you could do that somebody who's later
[1:21:55] in life wherever you are
[1:21:56] only believe that's the promise take him
[1:21:59] at his word and believe
[1:22:00] if one word disbelieve brought all the
[1:22:02] confusion the chaos we see today
[1:22:05] it's believing that it'll make sense of
[1:22:07] it and bring us back to simplicity let's
[1:22:10] stand to our feet this morning
[1:22:32] let's bow our heads in a word of prayer
[1:22:35] i appreciate your
[1:22:38] attentiveness still
[1:22:42] might have been too cold for some too
[1:22:44] hot for others
[1:22:46] still trying to get used to a new
[1:22:47] building
[1:22:50] i know it was a lengthy lengthy subject
[1:22:53] matter probably a little bit dry
[1:22:55] but at the close here
[1:22:59] one thing is needful that's what i want
[1:23:02] to
[1:23:02] challenge you with is to take him at his
[1:23:05] word and just trust him
[1:23:07] just believe him
[1:23:10] i trust that god has been able to wake
[1:23:12] open your eyes to
[1:23:14] the dishonest influences that are in our
[1:23:17] lives
[1:23:18] the things that prey on us and take
[1:23:20] advantage of us because we're vulnerable
[1:23:22] or ask the questions and
[1:23:24] try to explore our hearts and our minds
[1:23:26] and present us with scenarios and
[1:23:28] questions that cause the dilemma say oh
[1:23:34] god give us
[1:23:34] discernment like christ had to say you
[1:23:38] hypocrite why would why
[1:23:39] why do you tempt me and in his presence
[1:23:42] today if you would
[1:23:43] want god to help you just lift your hand
[1:23:45] to him
[1:23:47] and say lord i'm just requesting help
[1:23:50] let us pray our heavenly father
[1:23:53] your word is perfect
[1:23:57] it's without offense to the believer
[1:24:02] your word is complete it needs no
[1:24:05] amending
[1:24:09] lord you have made it so simple
[1:24:14] but we're the ones that complicate it
[1:24:18] and lord i i'm impressed at my own life
[1:24:21] to come back to the principle of taking
[1:24:23] you at your word and believe in you and
[1:24:25] trust in you
[1:24:27] and living simply by the revelation that
[1:24:29] this word is true
[1:24:32] and living by the revelation that christ
[1:24:34] is alive in my heart
[1:24:37] and that in serving you it gives me
[1:24:38] purpose and
[1:24:40] it it takes complexes and bitterness and
[1:24:43] it resolves them
[1:24:46] lord that's my prayer for those that
[1:24:47] have gathered here this afternoon
[1:24:50] as that we could come into an
[1:24:53] understanding together
[1:24:55] that one thing is needful and it's to
[1:24:58] serve you
[1:25:01] and lord serving you does not mean we
[1:25:02] lay down our domestic responsibilities
[1:25:04] nor does it mean that we forsake
[1:25:06] the duties that we have as spouse and
[1:25:08] parent
[1:25:09] the lord serving you gives real meaning
[1:25:11] and purpose direction
[1:25:13] to those offices but it gives me a
[1:25:16] standard to pursue it gives me something
[1:25:18] to aim for
[1:25:21] lord i'm not just merely satisfied being
[1:25:23] married and loving my wife
[1:25:25] but i want to love her like christ loves
[1:25:27] the church
[1:25:29] lord i'm not satisfied in disciplining
[1:25:31] my children and
[1:25:33] and setting rules and trying to guide
[1:25:35] them but i want to do it without
[1:25:36] provoking them to anger i want to do it
[1:25:38] in a way that's loving i want to do it
[1:25:40] in a way that's edifying and builds them
[1:25:42] up
[1:25:44] so lord it gives me purpose it gives me
[1:25:46] it gives me something to
[1:25:48] to aim for and to desire to become and
[1:25:50] to be and it's fulfilling lord
[1:25:53] to walk in your word and i pray lord
[1:25:56] that for
[1:25:58] the the young people here today
[1:26:01] the young adults and those in the time
[1:26:03] of life or they're trying still trying
[1:26:05] to find their way and
[1:26:07] where they're going to be what they're
[1:26:08] going to study what kind of job they're
[1:26:09] going to have where they're going to
[1:26:10] live and all these different things and
[1:26:12] even the devil through other
[1:26:14] relationships and circumstances trying
[1:26:17] to cause confusion about their own
[1:26:18] identity and
[1:26:20] trying to cause confusion about how they
[1:26:21] where whether they belong and what they
[1:26:23] believe lord may you
[1:26:24] come to their defense right now lord
[1:26:27] come to their aid defend them now lord
[1:26:29] in their weakness and their
[1:26:30] vulnerability and have mercy on them
[1:26:34] lord we know that our young people in
[1:26:36] certain times of life the
[1:26:38] their minds are just racing to be
[1:26:40] satisfied to be accepted to be socially
[1:26:42] active to
[1:26:43] uh to feel the the pleasure of of
[1:26:46] entertainment and lord there's
[1:26:48] it can be so chaotic and confusing lord
[1:26:51] may you give them the mind of christ
[1:26:53] through a new birth experience
[1:26:54] that can lead them through these years
[1:26:56] that can raise them to be wonderful
[1:26:58] god-fearing young people
[1:27:01] help us lord in our journey wherever we
[1:27:04] may be
[1:27:06] lord i can say this so confidently
[1:27:10] no matter where we are in our
[1:27:12] relationship with you we are looking to
[1:27:14] you
[1:27:17] none is looking any higher
[1:27:20] none is looking any better
[1:27:23] lord we're looking to you for you are
[1:27:26] the one thing needful
[1:27:28] may we come back to that if we've lost
[1:27:30] it
[1:27:32] may this be the foundation upon which
[1:27:34] this church is built may it be the
[1:27:35] foundation upon which marriages are
[1:27:37] built and
[1:27:38] maybe upon this foundation that our
[1:27:40] relationships with one another is
[1:27:41] cultivated
[1:27:43] forsaken all our special confessions
[1:27:47] and coming to and holding two and giving
[1:27:50] attention to the revealed word
[1:27:53] which belongs to us all i pray that you
[1:27:57] bless the people here today who lifted
[1:27:58] hands
[1:28:00] whose hearts have been raised
[1:28:03] parents with special anxieties children
[1:28:07] with fears
[1:28:10] families with questions may you come to
[1:28:14] their side this day
[1:28:17] comfort them
[1:28:21] may they be reminded of the promise that
[1:28:23] you'll never leave them
[1:28:24] nor forsake them it's a crazy world lord
[1:28:30] we feel like our hearts are chaos
[1:28:33] but we come to you the mender the healer
[1:28:39] the dissolver of doubts and we say here
