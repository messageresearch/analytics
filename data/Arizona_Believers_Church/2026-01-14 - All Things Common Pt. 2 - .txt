TRANSCRIPT
========================================
1 Corinthians chapter 10 verse 16 says, "The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ? For we being many are one bread in one body, for we are all partakers of that one bread." Amen. You can be seated. Continuing on uh the subject of all things common on Sunday, we ministered on the subject all things common. We brought it through a number of different scriptures and we'll be visiting that um you know tonight just a little bit wanting to continue on that. Really the way that we address that was Christ is the all things common to his church which is his body which he is the head of. He is that thing that is common to all Christians. He is everything as we saw that in the scripture and wanting to my burden has been at least initially just to identify the basis for community in scripture and not just trying to use that as a buzzword or some sort of modern phrase but there's just something in the scripture that speaks about fellowship and unity and togetherness and even the service that we give one to another in the body of Christ and it just draws on those themes of uh unity and community and tonight I want to cover a number of different scriptures. I kind of see it as maybe just a scriptural survey covering a lot of ground in the Bible. And if I could just kind of throw these uh two things out to you at the very very beginning so you can kind of be listening for this. I want to address two different concepts of community or even togetherness or unity. And that's the the unity of the body of Christ. But as we look at this, I think there's something we can draw from that that's more uh personal in another way. And it's really just the the treatment of others by Christians. And hopefully that gets everybody's attention. There's a unity in the body of Christ that is the work of the Holy Ghost. Uh and it's something that we believe in. It's something that we yield ourselves to. But then there's also admonition in the scripture on how that we as being members of that body of Christ treat people. &gt;&gt; Not just people within the household of faith, but how we treat others. And I hope that you can see that theme uh coming through this. And as we've looked at Christ being uh that foundation and that common all things to the church and to Christians uh these are important principles to uh understand what the body of Christ is the Christian community. Uh we might call it the fellowship of Christ or the church. And this is uh the subject that I'm looking at I think is very common to all of us as human beings because we tend to form groups with people that we are like. Not just that we like but that we are like and when there's a shared social goal uh it makes it easier to connect over those different things. And so in light of that there's a lot of different kinds of communities that you may be a part of right now and ones that you support or ones that you uh find yourself enjoying and get a benefit from. And so when we are in we'll form these relationships and these identities around people that we uh that we uh find find that are in the same situation that we're in. So there's a way to identify with people who are say same economic status or even if it's just the same geographical location or some sort of as they might put it today a common obsession with something. And so because you have a common obsession, you're kind of lumped together and you're even given names and you become fans of something. It's just how we have a tendency to form groups. But it's in these groups uh this is kind of the human dynamic, the human side to it. We we tend to build or reinforce our identity. Our social identity is based around even these groups. And so what we begin to do is we begin to construct these concepts of who I am uh and who I and what I identify with out of these by these groups that we're a part of. And this is just kind of the the human side to things. Brother Brandham in the sermon leadership makes this observation and he's talking about the rich young ruler and he's he's talking about the breakfast that he's speaking at the full gospel businesses breakfast and he's saying that perhaps this rich young ruler was part of the businessman's breakfast or he could have been uh um and then referring maybe even to Zakius in some places about being a member of the full gospel businessman's group and he says a businessman always had fellowship with one another because they're like birds of a feather. So it's that phrase birds of a feather flock together. I'm sure you've heard that before. And it just implies that you you'll find birds of the same type uh in a flock together. Birds of a feather um uh will flock together, will be together. They have things to talk about. He says religious men, they don't want to talk about the man that runs the barroom and all them together because they have nothing in common. &gt;&gt; So think of the the principle. He's saying that to somebody who oper uh that would be a different kind of businessman's meeting. if you have uh some sort of chamber of commerce gathering or something where you get together and it's just it's strictly business. He's saying that a Christian businessmen want to be able to get together so they can talk about the gospel. He says we've got to have things in common. So Christians have things in common with Christians. Sinners have things in common with sinners and societies whatever they are they have things in common. So what makes a community and what causes people to form different groups or uh identify strongly with one another is when they have something in common. And when we have something in common, it's our human nature to begin to build an identity around that and identify myself. Oh, I'm part of this group. Uh if you if you grow up in Wisconsin and you and you really really love professional football, you might call yourself a cheese head. uh and and there's different ways that you begin to identify yourself and you operate as a group and you have certain passions and desires. That's just how that it works within human nature. And so for there to be fellowship and identity and those things, you have something in common. And one of the reasons I believe that God has dealt with my heart very strong on this subject is because community or just have fellowship and friendship to belong to something. Uh being social, we're social creatures. It's it's necessary. And so God's word uh doesn't say, "Well, you're going to be alone the rest of your life and you you got to do this on your own and live on your own and disregard the human condition to want to socialize and have friends and have an identity or have belonging." It doesn't disregard that. It reinforces the need for it by identifying the true way to satisfy it. &gt;&gt; And [snorts] so God's word outlines the basis for building the right kind of community. And so as we emphasize the body of Christ and even how that uh how the this local church works together to form family and community and support you, we're we're we're not trying to draw some sort of line to where it says the only right kind of community is your local church and to be a Christian. There may be other communities you're a part of and that you might get a benefit from and friendship groups or different things you do recreationally that um are certainly they're fine and everything is okay with that. But recognize the dynamics of community and how that there could be something very social or economic that begins to fill the need that you have for belonging, but it's taking you away from that community in Christ. &gt;&gt; That is the greatest the greatest belonging and identity you can have. &gt;&gt; In Titus chapter 1, and this is where I might I'm just going to be going through a number of different um scriptures to identify um a common faith. That's kind of how my notes were running over the last several weeks is this idea of a common faith. He writes, "Paul a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ according to the faith of God's elect." That's a very specific faith. &gt;&gt; The faith of God's elect. That that puts it in a category that's um special. It's peculiar. Says, "And the acknowledge of the truth which is after godliness." That even identifies what kind of truth he's referring to. in hope of eternal life, which God that cannot lie promised before the world began, but hath in due times manifested his word through preaching, which is committed unto me according to the commandment of God our savior. There's a lot in just these three verses here that he has laid out there. The faith of God's elect, the acknowledging of truth, which is after godliness, this promise of eternal life that God has promised and he's manifested his word through preaching. This is part of God's way that he does it. He says it's been committed to him. So as Paul writes this to Titus, he's identifying a lot of things. He says to Titus, my own son after the common faith. So he's not Paul's son after the flesh. But he's beginning to identify this familial bond and this brotherhood and this kinship that is after a common faith. This just isn't like an ordinary faith uh um and and something that's just common to humanity. There are temptations such as are common to man. But what he says here is this shared faith, something communal. This is the faith of God's elect. Titus my own son after, if I could put it this way, the faith of God's elect. He says, "Grace, mercy, and peace from God the father and the Lord Jesus Christ our savior." So this common faith is the same faith in verse one, the faith of God's elect. And this is what unified Paul to Titus. &gt;&gt; This is the the greatest bond between them. This is the This is what unified the Christian church together in the very beginning. It wasn't their Jewish heritage. It wasn't their belief uh uh in in the law. It wasn't a lot of these different things that maybe they did share, but it was Christ that brought them together. &gt;&gt; He was the common thing. And so you have a common faith, the faith of God's elect in 1 Timothy 1:2 unto Timothy, Timothy, my own son in the faith. Now I wonder if there was any kind of rivalry between Titus and Timothy, which one was his favorite son? But you notice that he's identifying himself as a father. He even tells the church to be followers of him as he's followers of Christ. So it say this as he told Timothy that he was Titus that he was a son after common faith. Now he says unto Timothy my own son in the faith grace, mercy and peace from God our father and Jesus Christ our Lord. Very similar salutations to Titus. But notice again it's a son in the faith. The Bible speaks about the faith. &gt;&gt; It's this faith that is foundational to a Christian experience. &gt;&gt; It is the faith of God's elect. common faith or the faith in Galatians chapter 2 20 in the prior verses he's talking about the faith of Jesus Christ he says I'm crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ liveth in me the life which I now live in the flesh I wanted to just emphasize this I live by the faith of the son of God who loved me and gave himself for me he's not identifying it as his own faith in the son of god but a faith of the son of god is the faith that he refers to the common faith or the faith of God's elect. This is a different kind of life that he now lives by the faith of the son of God in acts 16:5 as we've been doing a using a lot of scriptures from the book of acts and so were the churches established in the faith and increased in number daily. I know that there is maybe a natural wondering of the mind to say well what is the faith and what does that comprise and what does that look like and could we distill the faith down to script uh different principles and this is our church mission statement or this is what we believe these are our doctrinal points and there's it's certainly possible to begin to try to outline what the faith is but really that's what the New Testament's telling us and what's showing us and the different ways that it manifested itself but we could just identify this one thing today that there was something that when they say the churches were being established in the faith that means something &gt;&gt; something very specific that they were being established in as Peter referred to it as the present truth not a faith and and not just a belief and not just a religion or just establishing a a support group but they were established in the faith and increased in number daily the believers admonished in 1 Corinthians 16:13 watch ye stand fast in the faith quit you like men be strong. So this faith is a very specific Colossians 1 23. If you continue in the faith grounded and settled and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel which you have heard and which was preached to every creature which is under heaven whereof I Paul am made a minister as he said that he has preached and the word of God has been manifested by preaching which was committed to him. He's preaching this common faith the faith of God's elect. He's saying, "Stand fast in the faith. Continue in the faith a as it has been inspired in you by the preaching of the word of God." Faith cometh by hearing, hearing by the word of God. That's the faith of God's elect. &gt;&gt; Peter writes it this way in second Peter chapter 1 verse one. Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our savior Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Here we can even use uh these very specific words that he uses obtained. So it's something that's been received and been inherited, granted, acquired like precious faith. So it's it's peculiar. It's to be treasured. This precious faith that you've obtained this precious faith with us. This is not and really zero in on this because this is where we're going to kind of stay in this area and I imagine that we're going to be we should be out of here. Here I'm setting myself up. I should be done by 8:30. That'll be up to you. So just amen me. Get behind me. Just really really rally me. We're going to do this. Obtained precious like faith. This faith is not faith to perform miracles. This isn't faith to be able to operate gifts, but this is the gift of faith by his grace. &gt;&gt; You've obtained like precious faith been established in the faith. So stand fast in the faith. My own son in the faith after the common faith, the faith of God's elect. This is that precious faith that Peter had, that Paul had, that the Colossian church was being admonished to stand fast in and and the Corinthian church to stand fast in to continue in these sons of Titus and Timothy were because of the faith, not because of confession of the mouth, not because of common experience of of healing the sick, but it was a faith of Jesus Christ. It's a gift. Ephesians chapter 2:8, for by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourselves. The faith, it's not a faith of yourselves that saves you. &gt;&gt; We can't brag that, well, I believed and I was saved. Though, you can't be saved apart from belief. We realize there something given by God. It is the gift of God. The grace is a gift of God. The faith is a gift of God. You've obtained like precious faith with us. For by grace are you saved through faith. This faith again is not a shared experience, emotional experience, physical experience or a faith to perform miracles or walk on water, any of those things. It's the faith in Jesus Christ, the personal revelation of Jesus Christ to you. &gt;&gt; You can see this identified more clearly in 1 Corinthians chapter 13 as we were reading from it before. how charity never fails and these list of things that charity cannot do and these list of things that charity does do. He was identifying how on one hand uh you're nothing without charity. So then charity becomes everything. God is love. &gt;&gt; There's something that becomes the all in all. And he says and though I have the gift of prophecy. So there's this ability to a gift being used in a person's life and understand all mysteries and have all knowledge. And though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains and have not charity, I am nothing. We know that there's times scripture appears to contradict scripture. There's even instances in scriptures where it says it one way and then says it another and we say, "Oh my goodness, what's happening here? Paul says you're justified by faith." James says, "You're justified by works." And we can look at that and say, "Oh, they contradict." But then it's made it we're we understand that one is from God's vantage point, the other's from man's vantage point. There's a way that they dovetail. And with all the scriptures we have on faith, we don't read this and say, "Oh, well, apparently faith means nothing." But rather, it's identifying, if I could say this way, KIND OF A secondary faith, a faith that we operate more within ourselves, a faith that is a trust or confidence. And he says, "I can have all faith so that I could remove mountains." And that's that's an incredible earthmoving faith. He says, "And have not charity, I'm nothing." It's because this faith he's talking about here, this is this is a faith that could uh could use a gift could use. This is a faith that could cause mountains to be moved. But this the all things common is not gifts. &gt;&gt; It's not outward works. &gt;&gt; The we don't there's a lot of ways that you uh churches can form around shared experiences where it's like, well, we're more of a charismatic bunch and uh for our visitors, we're going to be bringing out snakes later, &gt;&gt; right? All right. So, we can all have we can have community experience. And that's how some people I'm I'm just joking for those who may not know I'm joking. Uh some some of the young guys are like, "Yes, yes." There's uh there's a way that people do things. So, we all kind of have this shared experience because we've done this together. We're in this together and that's how they join because it's through the certain style of worship, a certain taste or something. But the Bible's saying I could have a gift of prophecy. I could have faith through enough to remove mountains and I am nothing. And that's be this is a different faith than the faith of God's elect. &gt;&gt; This is a different faith than the common faith. The faith of the son of God. The faith that they were to be established in to standfast in and continue in. This is different. 1 Corinthians 12:es 27-31. This is the the verses preceding though I have all faith. He says now ye are the body of Christ in members in particular. This is Christ, the church, and the Christian. You are the Christian that's in this body of Christ. And God hath set some in the church. First apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healing, helps, governments, diversities of tongues. And so in the body of Christ, there are many different gifts. And they've been set in the church by God. But then he asks this question, are all apostles? And the answer is no. Are all prophets? And the answer is no. Are all teachers? Are all workers of miracles? have all the gift of heal gifts of healing. Do all speak with tongues? Do all interpret? And each one of these instances, the rhetorical questions to say, "No, we all don't do that. &gt;&gt; We're not all expected to do that. &gt;&gt; But any one of us could be subject to the Holy Spirit to do one of these things in us at any given time." SO HE SAYS, "NO, WE DON'T ALL DO THAT, BUT COVET EARNESTLY all of you the best gifts. And yet I show unto you a more excellent way, and that way is charity." It was the greatest of these. &gt;&gt; How there was faith, hope, and charity. And the greatest of these is charity. That's that was the more excellent way because he says, "Though I speak with tongues and men of angels, and though I I give my body to be burned and and though I do this and though I do that, if I have not charity, I'm nothing." He's identifying the faith. Amen. &gt;&gt; The faith which is common to all believers. Not faith to have gifts of healing, faith to speak with tongues or faith to interpret, but a more excellent way. Ephesians 4:es 1:7. I therefore the prisoner of the Lord. I keep finding that in these introductions. Paul a servant. Peter an apostle and a servant. Paul a prisoner. Each time over and over again they were bound to something. I therefore the prison Lord beseech you that you walk worthy of the vocation wherewith you are called. &gt;&gt; There's a worthiness to your calling to be a Christian. &gt;&gt; If you are called to have any one of these gifts in a church, you ought to walk worthy of these vocations. And then where is the worthiness found with all loneliness and meekness, with longsuffering, forbearing one another in love? This would speak to not just the unity of the body of Christ, but how those in the body of a Christ treat people. Endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace, the lack of strife and warfare, the unity of the spirit. Notice, it's not the unity of different personalities. It's the unity of the spirit. There's a way that we can grieve the Holy Spirit. There's a way that we can act contrary to the nature of the Holy Ghost. which is a way that we can clearly act when we're in the flesh and we're not in the nature or in that continuity of Christ. So he says endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace. This is a unity that pertains to those who have precious like faith &gt;&gt; because we can't force unity and say well you have this temperament and you have this personality and you have this desire and you have this we're going to try to come up with a structure we can all just kind of be forced together and get along. It doesn't work that way. There's this unity of the spirit that only comes through the body of Christ. &gt;&gt; If we try to achieve unity outside of the body of Christ, you try to achieve this spirit of unity outside of the common faith, then that's something that becomes organizational, denominational, &gt;&gt; ecumenical. There's a way that you get further and further from the unity that the spirit desires. &gt;&gt; So it says there is one body and one spirit even as you're called into one hope of your calling. One Lord, one faith. Amen. &gt;&gt; There are not thousands of ways to Christ &gt;&gt; or to God. There's only one way, Jesus Christ. There is only one faith. &gt;&gt; And and I believe that we should be so bold to draw that line and say, "Yes, there is only one faith." So, are you saying your interpretation is the right one? No. By faith, you've got to believe that you found Christ. But we c we should be agree as Bible believers that there is one faith, [snorts] &gt;&gt; one baptism, one God and father of all who is above all and through all and in you all. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then he says, but unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ. What does that identify as? He goes into in this chapter how he's given some apostles and prophets and evangelists and teachers and pastors. He says these gifts have been given just as he says there in 1 Corinthians 12. There's been different gifts that are given. He's saying that there's a different there's a grace given according to the measure of the gift of Christ. So people may be gifted to different measures. But that's not what makes us one. &gt;&gt; That's how we compare ourselves. Said, well, this person does this, this person does that. That's what destroys unity. But this the individuality you might have, the different gifts you have, the different callings you have, God gives those and grants those. But that's not what makes us fit together. It's the common faith that you have in Christ &gt;&gt; that brings you together. &gt;&gt; So the purpose of these different gifts, the purpose of preaching the word as you find in Ephesians 4:12 is to verse 13, till we all come in the unity of the faith &gt;&gt; and of the knowledge of the son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. &gt;&gt; There has to be uh speaking the truth in love. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The truth &gt;&gt; Christ. If we thought about, well, are we achieving Christian unity? We would be disappointed tonight &gt;&gt; because there's so many different churches that are gathering right now preaching so many different uh uh versions of Jesus Christ. A and so many different identifications and people waring over the pulpit, names being called and all sorts of fights being fought. We say, "Oh, what a what a horrible state of the Christian church." We say, "Well, we need TO GET ALONG. WE NEED TO get along more with other groups of people and other Christians. So, let's try to have unity. and we'll have this person preach, we'll have this person do this, and we'll just try to try to get everybody together. But that's THAT'S THAT'S THE WRONG KIND of unity &gt;&gt; really. You have to believe in your heart as Paul is. He says, "I've been given a gift to preach Jesus Christ." And the word is being preached and that's what people unite to is the word of God. &gt;&gt; If that's not what's happening, then it's the wrong kind of unity. Amen. &gt;&gt; In this Mian church age, when brother Bram's preaching the revelation of Jesus Christ, he said God never intended the church to be run by men and nor women either. So he's just saying it's not to be run by humans. Let's update this in uh God never intended the church to be run by they them. &gt;&gt; God runs this church and he runs it through gifts of the spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. The gifts of the of the spirit is in the church to correct the spirit. &gt;&gt; Not the spirit but correct spirits of men's hearts and people's hearts. He's got five ministerial offices in his church. First of apostles. He says missionary. The highest calling there is as apostle. Missionary means one cent. Apostle means one cent. So that's that's that dynamic there. Why they ever chose to be called a missionary? I don't know. But they're apostles. Apostles, prophets, teachers, evangelists, pastors. That's the elected offices of God to his church. Says in one place it's God's dressear in his church declaring his presence by what? The word being preached speaking the truth in love. And all these things go in each local body. And every person in the church has an individual ministry and that individual ministry goes together with the rest of the ministry to edify the body of Jesus Christ. So though there's different uh uh administrations and different ministries and different gifts and different measures of gifts and every individual you every individual in the church from youngest to oldest is in some way gifted to add to the body of Christ &gt;&gt; to edify the body of Christ &gt;&gt; and as the body of Christ is edified we are to be coming coming into what would be the unity of the faith &gt;&gt; this knowledge of the son of God, I'm growing. I'm increasing. This is this development, this internal development. And because of that, we may be at any given time at a different level in our understanding, in our own faith, in our own growing. So in 1 Thessalonians chapter 3:10, it says, "Night and day, praying exceedingly that we might see your face and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith." &gt;&gt; Listen, there is nothing lacking in the faith. There's nothing wrong with the common faith. There's nothing wrong with the faith of God's elect. There's nothing wrong with the faith of the son of God. There's nothing wrong with the faith. So therefore, it is our understanding, our revelation or our faith in the faith, &gt;&gt; our understanding of the faith, our obedience to the faith. &gt;&gt; No Christian is any more stronger or spiritually healthy and alive than his adherence, his understanding of and his adherence to the true word of God. That's right. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; So as we are coming into a greater understanding and thereby subjecting ourselves to that truth, we become more healthy. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And so there is a perfecting of that which is missing or lacking or deficient in your faith. &gt;&gt; So that's where we can have different levels of faith, different levels of understanding. But that's not the faith that we're talking about. &gt;&gt; Amen. in 2 Corinthians chapter 10 verses 11-17. I I hope that I think I have all the slides here. I did a lot of rearranging um earlier today in my notes and so there may be some things we're missing here and I felt to just take some things out so we could be very focused on just this particular line of thinking. And a couple really lengthy scripture readings in 2 Corinthians and then in Romans, but that'll kind of be the sum of our service tonight. He says, "Let such 2 Corinthians chapter 10 11-17. Let such and one think this that such as we are in word by letters when we are absent, such will we be also indeed when we're present." Lot lot to think of there. I like that. For we dare not make ourselves of number or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves, but by they measuring themselves by themselves and comparing themselves among themselves are not wise. So, where's the this is the the uh comparison. &gt;&gt; It's the thief of joy. &gt;&gt; We compare ourselves to one another. And what's going to happen if we begin to compare ourselves to each other? And you say, "Well, that brother, he he is so much better this way and so much better this way. This sister's better this way, or I'm better than them and this and I'm better than them." And we begin to lose sight of what it is we have in common. &gt;&gt; And by comparing ourselves by ourselves and measuring ourselves by one another, he says that's says it's not wise. In other words, it's foolish. So, we're not trying to compare ourselves and measure ourselves. Let's not do that in any way. &gt;&gt; As the Lord has been dealing with my heart in terms of community, I believe that at some point we'll be able to deal with competition. &gt;&gt; I remember when my father-in-law came and preached a sermon uh at at my the church I grew up in and he preached on competition. I'm like, why would he need to preach that here? And he did it innocently, but it was definitely relevant. We just kind of Mcgirious we have a competitive streak in us. Oh, you want to do you disagree with me? I'll prove to you that we got a competitive streak. &gt;&gt; But he says, [laughter] &gt;&gt; I expect a a full retraction in the morning. He says, "But we will NOT BOAST THINGS WITHOUT our measure, but according to the measure of the rule which God hath distributed to us, a measure to reach even unto you." So he said that he's been granted a measure and that he has a measure that he said a portion of the gospel has been granted to me. So he says that I have been given this uh this the word has been manifested through the preaching which has been committed unto me. Says for we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure as though we reach not unto you. For we are are come as far as to you also in preaching the gospel of Christ. I I don't want just to get lost in some of these words he's using here. But I hope you can see these saying I've been given a measure. &gt;&gt; There's different measures given to different individuals. We have different spirits, different when I say different spirits, different offices, different gifts. And the Bible says all by one spirit. &gt;&gt; So we'll find later that there's uh we have different measures and different administrations but it's still the same spirit. &gt;&gt; So we're wanting to identify that there is a common faith. There's a common spirit. Those are the bonds. Those are the things that we have to come back to. It's the word of God. It's the spirit of God. It's the faith in the word of God. These are the things that we we find our strength in. These are things that we find in common. Now, if somebody comes along and says, well, the word of God's not true. Then we realize, well, that how how do I deal with that? &gt;&gt; How can I join TO SOMEBODY SAYS THE BIBLE'S NOT TRUE? YOU SAY, WELL, I BELIEVE the Bible's true. THEN YOU REALIZE THAT'S A FUNDAMENTAL difference &gt;&gt; that makes you recognize THAT THERE'S GOING YOU MAY HAVE SOMETHING IN COMMON WITH THAT PERSON. They may be family. They may be somebody you love. You may be able TO FIND UM SOME MEASURE OF participation or relationship with them. BUT THEN YOU REALIZE THERE'S SOME DIFFERENCE &gt;&gt; THAT OPPOSES THE COMMON FAITH. &gt;&gt; So he says these different measures, he doesn't stretch himself beyond that measure. Verse 15, not boasting of things without our measure, that is of other men's labors, but having a hope when your faith is increased. &gt;&gt; So there is an an increasing of one's individual faith. &gt;&gt; There are measures that we can grow in in our understanding. &gt;&gt; It's why it's so important for us to maintain a humility with our experience to recognize that God will God manifest truth to whosoever he will. Yes. &gt;&gt; And that what God has showed you, carry it with humility because it's by the grace of God that you've seen that &gt;&gt; God reveals something to you. If God reveals himself to you, if you're sick and maybe you have cancer and God reveals himself to you as a a healer, you become healed. &gt;&gt; And that's the grace of God. So if you see somebody who has cancer and NOT BEING HEALED, DON'T JUDGE them &gt;&gt; because what you've been healed of can come right back on you. &gt;&gt; But you want TO PRAY THAT GOD WOULD GRANT TO THEM THE SAME REVELATION. AMEN. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. &gt;&gt; So there is a when your faith is increased, this kind of speaks to the heart of the attitude we ought to have towards those who are who don't have the same as you do. The Bible says, "Walk in wisdom to those who don't have wisdom." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the days are evil. We have to CARRY THIS LIGHT MUCH more circumspectly than we ever have before. So that we lose the arrogance, we lose the hottiness, WE DON'T LOOK DOWN ON PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; BUT FOR THE GRACE OF GOD, THERE GOETH I. AMEN. &gt;&gt; That when their faith is increased, it's a lesson that I I I had to learn personally that in my attitude towards people who don't see this see the word the same way I would. Well, it's really easy to say, "Well, how could they be my brother? &gt;&gt; How could they be my sister? Why how could they be Christians if they they disagree so fundamentally on on the things of God?" And I realized, well, we could just split hairs then on if that moment has been memorialized and nothing ever changes, then we can say, okay, well, yeah, if they're denying this or they're denying that, how could they have the Holy Ghost? But the attitude isn't isn't based in faith as much as it is, I would say, fear &gt;&gt; that you could be wrong. Fear that of maybe not being so certain where you stand. But the more confident you get in your revelation, the easier it'll be to believe that somebody else can have the same one. Amen. &gt;&gt; The more THE MORE HUMBLY YOU'LL CARRY THE TRUTH IN BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT AFRAID IF SOMEBODY DISAGREES WITH you &gt;&gt; because you know what God has revealed to you. You know that you hold this truth deep within your heart and that the devil can't take that away. &gt;&gt; And so when it comes to calling someone brother or sister, you don't need to withhold that &gt;&gt; to protect your truth. That's right. &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T NEED TO WITHHOLD THAT TO TO BE SURE THAT you're you're right and that you make this stand that that you know they're wrong. &gt;&gt; But call them in brother or sister not because you agree but because you believe the same God that showed you truth can show them as well. Amen. &gt;&gt; I know that I'm sharing maybe my personal testimony with this, but I remember for me what it crystallized in scripture is when those 12 spies went over to seek out the promised land that they went over and when the 12 CAME BACK, TWO of them said, "We are more than able to take it." &gt;&gt; And they weren't just speaking about the two of them, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; It wasn't Caleb and I believe that we can take it. And K goes, "Yes, Joshua and I believe that we, the two of us, dos armonos, WE COULD TAKE IT." &gt;&gt; And it wasn't them that were speaking exclusively OF THEMSELVES. THEY LOOKED OUT UPON ALL ISRAEL AND SAID, "WE ARE more than able." &gt;&gt; But then THE 10 SPIES GOT UP THERE AND SAID, "NO, WE ARE NOT." &gt;&gt; And their sin was NOT TO SAY THAT THEY couldn't because clearly they didn't. &gt;&gt; But it WAS THE SIN WAS BY THEIR CONFESSION TO SAY THAT THEY COULDN'T, &gt;&gt; THAT YOU COULDN'T. THAT JOSHUA COULDN'T, THAT CALEB COULDN'T. And so there's A DANGER IN HOW THAT WE TRY TO DRAW LINES AND DIVIDE things and say AND TRY TO BUILD THIS EXCLUSIVITY. OH, THERE IS AN EXCLUSIVE BODY OF CHRIST AND WE'RE NOT THE ONES THAT DETERMINE who's in and who's out. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; And when we stand upon revelation, we should be better able to say, "Brother, sister," and to treat others with kindness &gt;&gt; and with the love of JESUS CHRIST, NOT NOT TRYING TO BUILD SOME SORT OF FALSE UNITY, but believe in God, open their eyes to this great grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That they could know you in a personal way. when your faith is increased that we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule abundantly to preach the gospel in regions beyond you and not to boast in another man's line of things made ready to our hand but he that glorifith let him glory in the Lord &gt;&gt; there's an increasing of faith doesn't change thee faith it's just one's faith in Romans chapter 12 verses 3- 1 For I say through the grace given unto me to every man that is among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think. This is really really good good things to consider. I I I maybe I I have to admit I'm preaching some from my heart tonight just by inspiration because I I've been asked to speak at a minister's meeting that the subject is how do we have unity and and in my mind I'm thinking well I mean we could have a lot of rules right and we could have uh we could have different ways that we can create unity but the true unity comes by the word of God &gt;&gt; and so how is it that we could have unity each one of us personally hold ourselves accountable to the word of God to not think of ourselves more than we ought to think &gt;&gt; with loneliness of mind. Let each esteem other better than themselves. It's just a way that you begin to conduct yourself in a manner which somebody's would say to themselves, I like being around that person. &gt;&gt; I I I like there's something about him. There's something about th THOSE PEOPLE. THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT THIS THAT'S REAL AND GENEROUS. SAYS, WELL, you know, they don't believe like us, don't you? Like, oh, well, I know what we believe kind of produces this. So maybe this isn't what I want. There's a way that you begin to conduct yourselves when you know there's some people you know there's some people you like to be around. There's others that you don't like to be around. That's just human nature. So the Bible's teaching you how to be somebody that others can like to be around. Get be salty so that they would hunger and thirst after what you have. &gt;&gt; But to think soberly according to the grace to God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith. So every man has been given a measure of faith. For as we have many members in one body, and all members have not the same office, so we being many are one body in Christ. &gt;&gt; This is true of the real supernatural body of Jesus Christ. We're not talking about the local church. We're talking about the body of Jesus Christ. All members have not the same office. They all have different measures of faith, but they're still one body, and everyone members one of another. Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith. Do you see how instructive this is? &gt;&gt; Let us fill up the measure that we've been granted. Paul said, I don't go reach out beyond my measure. I fill up my measure. 2 Corinthians 10. I I go to the extents of my calling. I fulfill my office. I perform my duty. You ought to be doing the same. And that it's in the meeting of the duty that we meet. We shouldn't overstep yours. You don't overstep mine. There's this way that we meet. We're each doing our part, &gt;&gt; having different gifts according to the measure of grace that is given us. If you have a gift of prophesy, do it according to the proportion of faith or ministry, let us wait on our ministering. Or he that teacheth on teaching. Or he that exhortth on exhortation. He that giveth, let him do it with simplicity. He that ruleth with diligence. He that showeth mercy with cheerfulness. Let love be without dissimulation. That's for all of us. Let it be without hypocrisy. The poor that which is evil, cleave to that which is good. Here's this uh uh he's speaking about the one body. This is the unity of the body of Christ. This is the community, the fellowship of the body of Christ. But now here's the treatment of others by these members of the body of Christ. Be kindly affectionate one to another with brotherly love, in honor, preferring one another, not slothful in business, fervent in spirit, serving the Lord, rejoicing in hope, patient in tribulation, continuing instant in prayer, distributing to the necessity of saints, given to hospitality. Bless them which persecute you. Bless you. Bless you. BLESS AND CURSE NOT. REJOICE WITH THEM that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep. Be of the same mind one toward another. Mind not high things, but condescend to men of low estate. Be not wise in your own conceit conceits. Recompense to no man evil for evil. &gt;&gt; Provide things honest in the sight of all men. &gt;&gt; These are the aspirations of a Christian. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is, as I put on the slide, this is conduct becoming of a Christian. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; These are things that you ought to judge yourself by. We let's not create a Romans 12 template and then ask chat GPT to tell us whether or not our friend meets this qualification or whether or not the neighbor in the apartment next door fits these parameters, but rather we should examine ourselves by this &gt;&gt; to see whether or not we are in the faith, whether or not we're walking in the spirit. Does our own is our own nature conforming to this great expectation of scripture? &gt;&gt; If it if it be possible, I'm so glad he said that. As much as lith in you, live peaceibly with all men. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Paul acknowledging that there's times when it's not possible, but as much as you are able, live peaceibly with all men. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we're not keep endeavoring to keep the unity of the spe uh the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace. I'm not waring. I'm not striving. Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place un rather give place under wrath. In other words, let God be the judge. For it is written, vengeance is mine. I will repay, sayeth the Lord. If you avenge yourself, &gt;&gt; if you try to get restitution yourself, then you take it out of God's hands. &gt;&gt; So he he he's speaking to human nature. &gt;&gt; I want to get payback. I want to get even. Well, if you get your own vengeance, then vengeance isn't the Lord's. &gt;&gt; So he says, "Give place to wrath." That doesn't mean your own wrath. It says, "Let God be the judge. Therefore, if thine enemy hunger, feed him. If he thirst, give him drink. For in doing so, thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I believe this to be the truth. &gt;&gt; I believe this to be the word of God. &gt;&gt; I believe it'd be very wrong for us to quibble with and say, "Well, this is just Paul. You know, Romans, you know how they can be." This is only appropriate in that time. And that I believe these are timeless truths. I think it speaks to the heart of the things that sometimes go missing in that simple Christian life that we're called to live. &gt;&gt; That rugged life out there amongst the people being a light. If your enemy is hungry, feed him. If he thirsts, give him a drink. And try not to say, you know, here's your hot coals. Because there's times when we act, we're doing it. We're doing it because we want to heap coals of fire on his head. Well, I don't know that you kind you may be missing the point there. Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good anymore. The this great temptation is for us to be agitated and triggered and to respond to evil. &gt;&gt; And when we do it in our flesh, we're just returning evil for evil. &gt;&gt; But we can only overcome evil with good. &gt;&gt; This is all speaking to the one body of Christ. And in that one body of Christ, there's different measures of faith. There's different gifts. There's different ministries. There's different callings, different ways that people are filling up that measure. Faith can be increased. There can be something lacking in our faith. Been uh studying for a youth service on help Lord, I I believe. Help thou my unbelief. &gt;&gt; This honesty about how sometimes there's my my faith isn't all there. It's not where it needs to be. I have I have doubts. I I have questions. So there there there are those things that exist. But those things exist even as Paul is putting it here. It's being placed in scripture within the context of those who are part of the body of Christ. So what IS IT THEY HAVE IN COMMON? Not that everyone every day is all the same and we're all just on cloud9, whatever that means. And we're all happy all the time and we all drive the same car. We're all getting the same gas mileage. Even if we drive an electric vehicle, same gas mileage. We're all wearing the same things. We're all listening to the same music. Right? I'm going to be sharing my playlist later this week. I don't want you all to listen to anything other than what I listen to. You hear me? I want to be sure I keep this hand low enough to where I don't get in trouble. There's a way that we could try to say this is what but no, it's a faith on the inside. &gt;&gt; It's an affinity. It's a dynamic that transcends how much we could try to look alike and talk alike and feel like. THAT'S HOW THE world builds community to where they get SO CLOSE AND THEY RALLY around this common ASSESSION WHERE THEY BEGIN TO HAVE A LANGUAGE THAT NOBODY ELSE CAN understand &gt;&gt; and that's how they get cultish. &gt;&gt; They get different and they make themselves weird. &gt;&gt; AND WE'RE CAUTIONED NOT TO DO THAT. &gt;&gt; YES, THERE'S A way that we CAN BEGIN TO TALK AS BELIEVERS THAT WE CAN SAY IT TAKES THE token to understand that that it takes the MIND OF CHRIST TO REALLY UNDERSTAND. BUT IS THAT WHAT WE SHOULD BECOME is is clingons where we say we have a special language and and hand signals like he must be yeah WHATEVER ELSE YOU'RE SAYING YEAH YOU GET IT and everybody's just kind of nodding only and other people what is this we become barbarians one to another &gt;&gt; it's a common faith it's a faith of God's So all things common as we we're identifying that on Sunday we don't start with the outside &gt;&gt; promoting certain things. Well this is the way it should look and this is the way it should sound and this is the way it should be but you start with the in the heart of a person. &gt;&gt; Let God start working on that. Let him do a deep work. Where many of us miss it is we're no longer letting the word deal with our hearts. We're just letting it deal in the outward things. &gt;&gt; We get a lot out front. We can defend ourselves. &gt;&gt; We get really really good h with our spiritual judo. Not going to let anyone get to us because it's all out here. Our closing scriptures are this one that we opened with in 1 Corinthians chapter 10 verses 16 to1 17. I'd like to read some of the verses prior to this on Sunday morning, Lord willing. But he's asking this question. And he says, "The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?" The word communion, there's community, fellowship, association, this joint participation, the sharing of what one has. So if you have something, and think of it this way, the sharing in the community, it's not that, well, I've got faith and I have this faith, so I'm going to share it with brother Aio and here you can have some of my faith. But we share the same faith. &gt;&gt; That's the fellowship of the blood of Christ. &gt;&gt; The community of the body of Christ is this joint participation. You participate in the blood of Jesus Christ. Your sins are forgiven you. You have faith in Jesus Christ. That's the that's the sharing of what we have. IT'S NOT ONE PERSON HAS all the faith and now I'm just going to chop it all up and share it with all of you. Churches that are like that. They're the worst kinds. Everyone just comes to hear what the pastor has to say and he's going to tell them what to think and what to do and then you're all just I'm just going to give you my revelation. You just accept it for the way that I teach it. And that's not sharing. &gt;&gt; That's not fellowship. &gt;&gt; That that's the that's the kind of dynamics that make people sick to their stomachs when they think about going to church. But he says, "For we being many are one bread and [clears throat] one body, for we are all partakers of that one bread." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I just maybe a little bit self-aware in this moment that maybe there is a lot of uh try not to make we don't want things to be about church. You might say, "Well, for someone who's not trying to make it about church, you sure talk about church a lot." But you know what? There's a lot of undoing. There's a lot of washing that has to be done for us to not think the way that we've been taught to think for so long. &gt;&gt; And I believe that God's wanting us to grow, wanting us to mature, take a take a a step into our positions. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we have to recognize that the local church and this church dynamic is to thrust you to propel you to push you into that position, &gt;&gt; not become the fulfillment of it. Right. &gt;&gt; So, for we being many are one bread and one body, for we're all partakers of that one bread. What does the Bible say? What is Paul saying? By eating the same word, &gt;&gt; by feeding on the same substance, &gt;&gt; we coalesce, we harmonize into one body. &gt;&gt; How? It's not by the physical drinking of wine, not by the physical communion, but this is a communion not of bread, but of Christ the word. By having the same life, partaking of the same life, feeding on the same substance, what happens? We become one. &gt;&gt; There's there's an external uh there's a way that we could just speak things. speaking facts in frustration, we can all just kind of tow the line, which I found out this week is a nautical term to tow the line. And that we could just all we're just going to all tow the line. We're all going to look the same. And by speaking facts in frustration, we can become one outwardly, but it's speaking the truth in love. By feeding on the word, by the word of God being preached, by us, all feed on the same revealed word of God, the unfailing body word of the son of man. By feeding on that, we're all going to become one bread. &gt;&gt; How is it accomplished? HOW ARE WE EVER GOING TO BE COME INTO THE UNION OF FAITH? ONLY BY FEEDING ON THE FAITH. &gt;&gt; ONLY BY THE WORD OF GOD. &gt;&gt; That's how we become one body. That's how we become unified by eating one bread. &gt;&gt; So what what if we're not eating the same bread? Be kindly affectionate one another with brotherly love. If it be possible, live peaceibly with all men, provide things honestly. This the word begins to speak to us. The common the common ground in the word of God is what's going to build unity of the Jesus uh unity of Christ. &gt;&gt; You doing what the word says is what's going to keep you from being at enmity with everybody you meet. musicians, if you would come. There's a lot of different statements that I've been reading over and just really been blessed by, but this one from a thinking man's filter really stands out. Says, "As the days grow closer and closer in the narrowing of the path, we want to get go closer together." I think this speaks to us even as a church, we must just be one, one body. We must move together. You say, "Uhoh, where are we moving? It it it's two walking together. It's this we're in harmony in concert with one another. How's it going to happen? By walking in the spirit. &gt;&gt; By not fulfilling the deeds of the flesh. Just being one. Move together. Says forgetting one another's sins and our differences. Just sticking closer and closer as we see the day approaching. Assembling ourselves together all with one accord AND ONE HEART. THESE ARE SCRIPTURAL PRINCIPLES. And if a brother or sister gets out of the way in any way, don't do anything but pray for that person in love. Always considering one another. &gt;&gt; Ye who are spiritual restore such a one that in that spirit of humility considering your own self. Don't ever let any one of you get away. Stay together. And if you can add more to it constantly all the time. I love that. [music] Stay together. And if you can't add more all the time, we have this need to be [music] one. For some in in a church, church becomes the only place that they have friends, the only place that they have fellowship. They look forward to it and it provides. It's in the church that there the there is a a father to the fatherless, a husband to the widow. There's a there's the the needs that are are met through the fellowship of a body of Christ through believers. So, we need it. We can't just stay at home and read the Bible. Can't just stay home and stream. You miss out on so much that God desires to get grant you by being partakers of that one bread. So, he speaks to this attitude that we have. Pray for one another. Forget our sins and our differences. Stick closer together. when someone gets out of the way, pray for them in love. Consider one another. Don't don't don't let just let you one get away and then look our our doors are open to see more saved, more come to the light of God's word for our lives to have an impact. [music] That's what we want God to do. We want him to have preeminence. And I believe [music] that there's a there's a calling that he is bidding us to. And I believe that we [music] should embrace it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As a church, I believe that you should embrace it. If we could stand on our [music] feet, pray together. Our gracious heavenly father, tonight [snorts] as we close, we thank you for your presence that's been with us tonight. Lord, I know that in reading a lot of scriptures, it's easy for there to be may fragments or one thought here and another thought there. But Lord, truly, you could take all these scriptures and begin to weave together these touch points in a way that it makes a a profound thought in the believer's heart. And I trust that as you do it that there wouldn't be this instinct to compliment the preacher. There wouldn't be this instinct to say, "Wow, what a sermon." But would they recognize, Lord, your love for them. And how you could take a sermon with a number of different scriptures and just weave together what we individually had need of tonight. There's so much in here, Lord, that we can challenge ourselves with that there is a unity, a true unity, and it's not going to come by politics. It's not going to come by external power. It's going to come by the Holy Spirit working within your body and you'll use gifts, use the gospel, the preaching of the word and it's working this out in individual's lives. And then Lord, how is it that we can then have unity as a church or unity with other Christians and other believers? Well, let's conduct ourselves in a life that's worthy of the gospel in a way that's becoming of a Christian. And I know that's a lot, Lord, to ask. You expect a lot of us, Lord. But you would never ask us to do something that you're not willing to give us the power to do. So, Lord, may we be willing to receive it and walk in it and bless your church tonight, I pray, and everyone assembled. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we ask these things. Amen. He met.
