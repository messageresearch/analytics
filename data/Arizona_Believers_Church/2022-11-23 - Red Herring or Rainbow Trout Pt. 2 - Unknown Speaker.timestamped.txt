[0:00] sounds about right for Thanksgiving text
[0:03] I didn't I had necessarily pondered it
[0:05] that way but we just felt on a heart to
[0:06] continue on the subject of red herring a
[0:09] rainbow trout and just I think all of us
[0:12] that are here today were in the service
[0:14] on Sunday or have caught the service in
[0:17] an archive so you probably know just
[0:19] exactly where we're at but a red herring
[0:20] is something that distracts it's
[0:23] something that misleads and so there's
[0:25] an issue at hand there's something
[0:26] irrelevant maybe problem solving maybe a
[0:28] discussion could be something that's
[0:31] used in terms of debate or an argument
[0:33] over a policy or a particular situation
[0:35] and then somebody kind of throws
[0:37] something out whether it be a question
[0:38] or some sort of position oftentimes it
[0:40] could just be a factor uh you know it
[0:43] point to anything but it's done in a way
[0:45] to kind of Veer you off what is
[0:47] important gets you away from problem
[0:49] solving the actual issue when you start
[0:51] debating something totally different
[0:52] discussing something kind of off track
[0:55] so a red herring is something that
[0:56] misleads maybe the key word I've been
[0:58] using is or is distracts from something
[1:00] that's relevant the relevant
[1:02] conversation the relevant point or the
[1:04] important question so we have what a red
[1:06] herring is on the other hand rainbow
[1:08] trout is something different we're using
[1:10] these uh things as kind of contrary to
[1:12] one another opposed to one another red
[1:15] herring is something that distracts and
[1:17] the red herring distracts from the
[1:18] rainbow trout
[1:20] because the rainbow trout is our I'm
[1:21] thinking of it this way our personal
[1:23] revelation of Christ and our personal
[1:25] Union with Christ that's what the
[1:27] rainbow trout is it's our joining
[1:29] together with Christ that Union with
[1:31] Christ or drawn it from that from that
[1:34] third pull uh Vision that brother
[1:36] Bradham had where he said those those
[1:37] great big rainbow trout in that Lake and
[1:40] so that's what we use as a phrase to
[1:41] refer to the third pull the open of the
[1:43] word Christ is the rainbow trout and
[1:46] what we're emphasizing on somebody is we
[1:48] cannot let our attention be taken away
[1:51] from that what counts can't allow our
[1:54] attention to be distracted by red
[1:56] herrings or using the phrase red hair in
[1:58] a very broad umbrella to refer to a lot
[2:00] of things that distract us from that
[2:02] which counts or from the main thing
[2:04] and just a few more things to kind of
[2:06] give us the review but in the church age
[2:09] book chapter 4
[2:10] brother Branham says no True Believer is
[2:12] any stronger and spiritually healthy and
[2:15] Alive than his knowledge of and
[2:17] adherence to the pure word of God very
[2:21] simple very straightforward that you are
[2:22] your strength is directly connected to
[2:25] your knowledge of the word of God and
[2:27] your obedience to the word of God and
[2:29] that ought to strike all of us in a
[2:31] particular cord to where faith is what
[2:33] we must have you must believe it you you
[2:35] want to just have that simple Faith but
[2:38] then there's a desire to understand to
[2:39] grow deeper in the things of God because
[2:41] you have to have a knowledge of the word
[2:43] of God and an obedience to the word of
[2:45] God and our strength our spiritual
[2:47] health and we're no more alive so life
[2:51] depends upon our knowledge of the word
[2:53] of God and our obedience to the pure
[2:56] word of God and as we said on Sunday
[2:58] what the red herring wants to do is
[3:00] disconnect us from the source of our
[3:02] strength and if you find yourself
[3:04] getting weakened you find yourself
[3:05] losing your spiritual health you find
[3:08] that you're not quite alive or living
[3:10] like you want to live of then you could
[3:11] find that there's a connection to the
[3:13] word of God whether by knowledge or
[3:15] obedience to it that's been cut off and
[3:17] the red herring is what tries to throw
[3:19] us off balance and get us into things
[3:21] that don't strengthen our faith but
[3:23] rather weaken our faith
[3:25] and where we we're picking up on
[3:28] tonight and I I was wanting to go back
[3:31] and maybe since I had to stop kind of
[3:33] right in the middle I felt bad we were
[3:34] looking at hair splitting and people who
[3:36] separate themselves and and how we can
[3:38] take certain issues and make them so
[3:41] large in our minds that it separates our
[3:44] fellowship or divides us then when you
[3:45] go back to it you look it says this is
[3:47] not part of the rainbow trout to begin
[3:48] with this isn't even in the pool this
[3:51] isn't this isn't what we ought to be
[3:52] focusing on but yet it divides people
[3:54] and we were wanting to really take a
[3:58] step further in that and we'll have to
[3:59] do it tonight but it's the word that
[4:02] unites us it's that uh it's the third
[4:05] pool we can put it that way the third
[4:06] pull that unites us and I want to draw
[4:08] some thoughts on what the third pull is
[4:09] so if it's the word that unites us it's
[4:11] the red herrings that divide us
[4:13] so it's the red herrings that kind of
[4:15] slip in and cause us to draw swords
[4:17] against one another it's the red herons
[4:19] that cause to look side eye at people
[4:20] and say I don't know about that you know
[4:22] they they don't do communion with a
[4:24] single cup or they uh they they do this
[4:26] or they do that there's ways that we
[4:27] start dividing over what is brother
[4:30] Brown called hair splitting where you
[4:31] take something very small and it's a
[4:34] small maybe seemingly insignificant
[4:36] difference but we allow it to become so
[4:39] large that it divides us and that's what
[4:41] brother Brown said the people that hair
[4:43] split and he talked about uh and he
[4:44] quoted Jude 19 and it was allowing it to
[4:46] separate themselves but the Bible tells
[4:49] us where the carcass is where the fresh
[4:50] meat is where that fresh word is there
[4:52] will the Eagles be gathered together so
[4:55] we don't gather around anything else but
[4:57] the word of God and as we gather around
[4:59] the word of God if we can make that our
[5:01] gathering point if we can make the word
[5:02] of God our rallying point when we were
[5:05] traveling uh flew into Amsterdam our uh
[5:07] the the ride service that we had
[5:09] scheduled uh sent us a picture and it
[5:11] was a picture and it was called it was
[5:12] called the meeting spot and we had
[5:14] arrows and everything it was a clock I
[5:16] think and that was the place to meet and
[5:18] it didn't matter what else was around
[5:20] what kind of restaurants around there
[5:22] was actually a Starbucks there to our
[5:23] disappointment there was a lot of
[5:24] Starbucks in Europe that uh there's um
[5:28] so at least you knew you could get a bad
[5:29] cup of coffee while you're in Europe
[5:31] but there's uh there was a meeting point
[5:33] a rallying place and there's a place
[5:35] that you could go and say this is the
[5:36] meeting spot and nothing else mattered
[5:39] but knowing where that was
[5:40] and as long as you could hold to that
[5:42] meeting spot didn't matter where what
[5:44] time your flight landed and what kind of
[5:45] background you had didn't matter who
[5:46] you're riding with whatever what the
[5:48] point I'm trying to make is if we can
[5:50] rally around the word of God while we're
[5:52] there rallying around the word of God we
[5:54] can recognize our differences but as
[5:56] long as we rally around the right thing
[5:58] our differences aren't going to make
[5:59] such a matter as much and we can
[6:02] acknowledge oh you see it this way oh
[6:03] you do this and oh you don't celebrate
[6:05] Christmas oh you think Thanksgiving is a
[6:07] pagan holiday and we can all have all
[6:10] sorts of ideas but say hey but you know
[6:12] what it's the fresh kill that matters
[6:13] isn't it it's like that's right that's
[6:15] right we're right we're rallying around
[6:16] the right things we don't want to let
[6:18] small things that are not word things
[6:20] begets so big that it separates us from
[6:23] our fellowship in the word and that's
[6:25] where we really took great encouragement
[6:27] from the statement and for what is the
[6:29] attraction brother Brahm says that's
[6:31] what the attraction is the predestinated
[6:33] seat of God who can't do nothing else
[6:35] but follow it follow up the attraction
[6:37] the word of God he says means more than
[6:40] life to us take our lives but don't you
[6:43] take that so there's a lot of things we
[6:45] ought to be willing to give up there's a
[6:46] lot of things we ought to be willing to
[6:48] say oh it doesn't matter there's things
[6:49] that we should be able to say you know
[6:50] what that's my personal opinion you have
[6:52] your personal opinion these are things
[6:53] that at the end of the day really really
[6:55] don't matter take all these other
[6:56] insignificant hair splitted issues but
[6:59] whatever you do don't take the word of
[7:01] God and he says what is the attraction
[7:03] God as usual fulfilling his word
[7:06] so we gather around the word of God
[7:08] despite our differences or we can remain
[7:10] gathered around the right thing despite
[7:13] our differences when the main thing
[7:14] stays the main thing
[7:16] I I I could almost guarantee it if you
[7:19] look at where either it begins to get a
[7:20] little bit of a friction a little bit of
[7:22] Separation it's when the main thing
[7:23] loses its emphasis and the main thing is
[7:25] no longer the main thing and something
[7:27] else begins to get more preeminent and
[7:29] matter more and that's where the
[7:31] division comes but as long as we can
[7:33] keep our eyes on the rainbow trout keep
[7:35] our eyes on the things of God then we
[7:37] can recognize differences but realize
[7:40] that God will use those but it shouldn't
[7:42] separate us
[7:43] as Jude wrote in verse 19 he said these
[7:46] be they who separate themselves sensual
[7:49] having not the spirit so uses that
[7:51] phrase Central to identify that these
[7:53] are carnal Ambitions these are carnal
[7:55] desires these are carnal estimations and
[7:58] as we delved into a little bit deeper on
[8:00] Sunday that there's some things that
[8:02] Judah is referring to where people had
[8:04] some unique Doctrine maybe a different
[8:06] standard of living or they had some some
[8:08] platitude that they pointed to says this
[8:10] makes me better this makes me more holy
[8:13] this makes me different and they used it
[8:15] to separate from The Fellowship of the
[8:17] Saints they used it to separate from the
[8:19] teaching of the word of God and they
[8:21] suppose themselves more spiritual
[8:22] because they had a different take and
[8:24] Jude's saying no these guys aren't more
[8:26] spiritual they're sensual they're carnal
[8:28] these things have nothing to do with the
[8:30] spirit brother Branham said seemingly
[8:31] not having the faith and so it's not
[8:34] rooted in the word of God it's more
[8:35] their own personal uh particularities
[8:38] that they they're cabbage down on and
[8:40] causes separation and brother Branham
[8:42] uses that phrase or use the description
[8:44] identifying those who fuss and fight
[8:47] over insignificant things and over
[8:49] differences and then separate their
[8:50] Fellowship from the people
[8:52] and so it is
[8:54] it is the word of God this is something
[8:56] write it down however you feel that you
[8:57] can write this down but it's the word of
[8:59] God that we value over all of our own
[9:01] opinions
[9:02] it's the word of God that we value over
[9:04] all of our little particularities just
[9:06] in this room tonight there's enough
[9:08] different
[9:09] um uh you know taste and desires and
[9:12] likes and preferences to where we might
[9:14] have dozens of difference of opinions on
[9:16] what kind of meat we should have for
[9:18] Thanksgiving that's one of the reasons
[9:19] why I didn't choose a Thanksgiving me
[9:21] because I thought for sure if I said
[9:22] spam or turkey some of the spam people
[9:24] like wait a minute we've been doing spam
[9:26] on Thanksgiving for Generations in our
[9:28] household and you offend somebody so but
[9:30] there might be a lot of different ways
[9:31] the different Traditions think of all
[9:33] the different Traditions that we have
[9:34] that people approach holidays and they
[9:36] approach certain things and it's those
[9:38] things that make us different and we
[9:41] value those things and they're wonderful
[9:42] and diversity is a beautiful thing but
[9:45] there's something we value over all of
[9:48] that and it's the word of God
[9:51] there's a point at which it uh
[9:53] one thing that you have to be very
[9:56] careful of and maybe I hope I'm not
[9:57] making a political point but it's
[9:59] something that seems very obvious to me
[10:01] that if you make diversity the most
[10:04] important thing you'll lose your
[10:05] diversity
[10:08] have you thought about that that as soon
[10:10] as soon as you as soon as the main
[10:11] thing's not the main thing and you make
[10:12] something else the main thing you're
[10:14] gonna You're Gonna Lose even the ideal
[10:15] you're trying to support and you're
[10:17] trying to lift up because the only thing
[10:18] that harmonizes everything is the word
[10:20] of God it's the only thing that makes
[10:21] makes sense of everything so it's the
[10:23] word that we value over all other
[10:25] opinions ideas or approaches and we
[10:27] evaluate even over our own personal
[10:29] differences and our our personal
[10:31] differences our personal preferences
[10:33] should never be elevated above the word
[10:35] of God
[10:36] and I guess I'm very glad to say this to
[10:39] a Wednesday night crowd because it takes
[10:40] a lot of maturity and a lot of
[10:42] discernment and maturity with that
[10:44] discernment to recognize hey you know
[10:47] what this may not be right down the
[10:49] middle of the road in the word of God
[10:50] are very clear in the word of God and it
[10:52] takes the maturity sometimes to look at
[10:54] our own ideas and say you know what this
[10:56] is just my personal preference I'm not
[10:58] going to elevate this to the status of
[11:00] thus saith the Lord so I can use it as a
[11:02] kajal to beat other people up and tear
[11:04] other people's spirituality down but you
[11:06] recognize it yourself that this is
[11:07] personal conviction this is how the Lord
[11:09] is dealing with me I'm not saying it's
[11:11] so for you I'm not saying it so for you
[11:13] but this is how it is for me it takes a
[11:14] lot of maturity to do that
[11:16] it'll take a lot of maturity to
[11:17] recognize uh just a little personal
[11:19] differences and different ways that we
[11:21] feel and not allow those to be elevated
[11:23] above the word of God
[11:25] and so as I look at this tonight and
[11:28] just look at the pace we're going
[11:30] uh well I was just about to skip my text
[11:33] and I thought well maybe I shouldn't do
[11:34] that I'll just give everything I had
[11:36] there for my text we'll just we'll touch
[11:37] on it because I think it'll be
[11:39] beneficial and I want to I want to come
[11:40] back to this in Greater detail if the
[11:42] Lord continues just to Thrill Me
[11:44] personally on this study I'm doing about
[11:45] the third poll and if he inspires it for
[11:48] the church but in Luke chapter 14 we
[11:50] won't read the whole thing but uh just
[11:52] look back at a couple verses here there
[11:54] was a great supper that is made and
[11:55] there's going to be those that are
[11:56] invited to the feast the table's already
[11:58] everything's set and there's invitations
[12:01] that are given out and then one by one
[12:02] there's these different uh excuses that
[12:05] are made and we realize at the very end
[12:06] there's these different efforts to get
[12:09] people to come and so what we've read
[12:11] because we're using the rainbow trout as
[12:13] a symbol of the third pool and how the
[12:16] red herring distracts us from that
[12:18] rainbow trout of that third pool and in
[12:20] Luke chapter 14 it gives us a tremendous
[12:23] example of what a pull is because
[12:26] and looking around the room we are your
[12:28] third pool we hear it enough to where we
[12:29] don't really think about what a pull is
[12:32] some might think that someone has more
[12:33] than one swimming pool uh there's like
[12:36] the Seven Seals people often think about
[12:37] those that are barking and swimming in
[12:39] the ocean and but a pool is this tells
[12:43] us what a pull is and so when brother
[12:44] Brown says
[12:45] um a pool then when we a pool is
[12:48] something it's a verb it's telling you
[12:49] what it does the third pool and this
[12:52] scripture helps us understand what a
[12:53] pull is in verse 16 is we have it up
[12:55] there then said he unto him a certain
[12:57] man great a great made a great supper
[12:59] and bade many there's your pull he
[13:03] invited him he called them this is an
[13:04] invitation this is a calling out we
[13:06] could say this is the first pull he bade
[13:08] many there's a there's a kind of a
[13:10] attention get your attention invite you
[13:13] to the table could you come that's an
[13:15] invitation to come and the sermon is
[13:17] your life worthy of the Gospel brother
[13:19] Brown says did you notice there were
[13:20] three pools or three turns of it this is
[13:22] referring to the scripture when they
[13:24] went out first and called to them that
[13:26] were bidden to come they didn't do it so
[13:29] they went out a healing campaign went
[13:31] out to get the Blind and Halt and still
[13:33] there were room so he went out and
[13:35] compelled the good bad and indifferent
[13:37] that they should come in so here's
[13:39] brother Adam calling this three pulls
[13:42] first an invitation then a healing
[13:44] campaign and then a compelling and so
[13:46] when he says pull it's an actual get
[13:49] your attention ask you to come try to
[13:51] draw you out so a pull is something that
[13:54] gets the people's attention a pull is
[13:57] something that draws people it it's a
[13:59] tug a pull is a tug just as it sounds
[14:01] the third point you say the first pull
[14:03] is that second pull is that and the
[14:07] third pull is that it's trying to get
[14:08] somebody's attention I don't know where
[14:10] it started uh well as I said I don't
[14:12] know where it started but I but I'm
[14:14] going to mention a child's name but I
[14:16] was talking about Jack he started just a
[14:18] very very very young age even before he
[14:20] could talk if he if he he just want he'd
[14:22] always want to grab your cheek to talk
[14:23] to you now you look up at you just grab
[14:25] you and you want to look you in the face
[14:27] and that's that's the pull get your
[14:28] attention look at me this is what I want
[14:31] to say I'm trying to talk to you there's
[14:32] an effort that's being made and we're
[14:34] working with him to not do that but uh
[14:36] but what God wants to do sometimes and
[14:38] we'll let God do it if he wants to he
[14:40] can grab our chin right it's a pull it's
[14:42] a tug it's to get our attention as
[14:44] brother remember says it's a bidding
[14:45] it's a call it's that invitation to draw
[14:47] you out so when we get to verse 23 he
[14:50] says in the Lord said unto the servant
[14:52] so the first pull he paid many the
[14:54] second pull brother bam calls it a
[14:55] healing campaign and the Lord said unto
[14:57] the servant go out into the highways and
[14:59] hedges and compel them to come in that
[15:02] my house may be filled that word
[15:04] compelled means to necessitate it to to
[15:06] give it some sense of urgency to compel
[15:09] it means to drive them or whether by
[15:12] force or any other means
[15:14] and that to me is really really helps
[15:17] identify what a pull is because it's
[15:18] gonna say hey if you want I'm having
[15:20] friendsgiving uh why don't you come over
[15:22] any friends who want to come over don't
[15:23] have family come over to the house and
[15:25] it's like people just hey you know what
[15:26] if you want you could come I don't have
[15:29] to come and that's kind of what the
[15:31] first invitation is is it's kind of like
[15:33] well I bid you to come the second is
[15:35] imploring those who might have a greater
[15:37] need hey the healing campaign and oh I'm
[15:40] sick and the whole those who would be a
[15:42] little bit more urgent I I want to be
[15:44] there but then when it gets to that
[15:45] third pull this is something that
[15:47] becomes necessity this compelling Drive
[15:50] whether by Forest and so that third pool
[15:52] is the greatest attraction that third
[15:55] pull is the one of the greatest
[15:56] necessity and brother Bradman the sermon
[15:58] from that time he said oh if I could
[16:00] only go back if I could only have a
[16:02] chance I would grab them I would pull
[16:05] them I would persuade them don't let no
[16:08] one miss this this is perfection so when
[16:11] he had gone beyond that curtain of time
[16:13] and there was something in them that
[16:15] realized my this is greater than I could
[16:17] have ever thought before he uses a
[16:19] language that helps us understand what
[16:21] first second and third pull means he
[16:23] says I would grab them pull them
[16:26] persuade them don't let any of them miss
[16:28] it this is perfection this is what the
[16:31] idea of a pool is it ought to grab your
[16:34] attention and pull you to it
[16:37] kind of a tractor beam of sorts it's
[16:39] going to get your attention it's going
[16:40] to gravitate you to it and so the open
[16:43] of the word is we use this rainbow trout
[16:45] this third pool it's what draws us it's
[16:47] what pulls the bride uh to to her
[16:50] position in the end time
[16:53] it's the it's what is it's the third
[16:55] pull that brings us to that Gathering
[16:57] Place around the things of God the word
[16:59] of God that that Feast that fresh that
[17:01] fresh kill
[17:02] that's our the third pool is our
[17:04] gathering together if it's anything else
[17:05] it's cultish
[17:07] and brother Branham it was we read it
[17:10] before in the seventh seal he says I was
[17:12] standing there with a little baby shoe
[17:13] on I think I referenced it on Sunday
[17:15] said I was standing with a little baby
[17:16] shoe when he told me there make your
[17:18] first pull and when you do the fish will
[17:20] run after the Lord
[17:22] said then watch your second pull said
[17:24] because there are only be small fish he
[17:27] said then the third pull will get it
[17:29] you realize the third pull is the final
[17:31] attraction
[17:32] it's the third pull that is the final
[17:35] attraction it's the only Gathering Place
[17:37] this this let this sink in it's the only
[17:39] Gathering Place there is to receive
[17:41] rapturing faith in time for the Rapture
[17:43] and so this third poll it's the it's the
[17:46] only source of rapturing Faith the third
[17:48] pull is the only invitation to draw us
[17:50] to feasting around the things that
[17:51] matter and so put in that way I think
[17:54] you could understand just how tremendous
[17:56] it is to not get distracted by red
[17:58] herrings
[17:59] because the only place that there's
[18:01] Rapture in faith is in the third pool
[18:03] the only place that you're going to
[18:04] receive strength that you need to fly
[18:06] out of here and rise above all the
[18:07] things of the world is in the third pool
[18:09] so the very purpose of that stinking red
[18:12] herring is to take your mind off the the
[18:15] trout to take your mind off the third
[18:17] pull the very thing that's going to feed
[18:18] your faith and give you power to fly out
[18:20] of here
[18:22] so in the sermon excuse me in Hebrews
[18:24] chapter 12 this is where we stopped
[18:26] Sunday morning
[18:28] Hebrews chapter 12 verses 1 and 2.
[18:35] wherefore seeing we are also
[18:36] compassioned about
[18:38] with so great a cloud of witnesses
[18:41] let us lay aside every weight and the
[18:45] sin which doth which doth so easily
[18:48] beset us and the way that it's phrased
[18:50] it means the weight don't so easily
[18:53] beset us and the sin does so easily
[18:55] beset us and we hear the phrase
[18:56] besetting sin but it can be a weight and
[18:59] it can even be a sin so it doesn't even
[19:02] have to be sin but just even harmless
[19:04] things and even useful things things
[19:06] that are lawful can hinder our growth
[19:10] can impede our progress and so it can be
[19:12] a weight and we've got to recognize the
[19:14] weights just as much as we need to
[19:16] recognize the sins can you can you think
[19:18] about that in terms of sin is unbelief
[19:21] and there's things that maybe we're very
[19:22] quick to recognize that's unbelief
[19:23] that's taking me the wrong direction
[19:24] that's not pleasing to the Lord but what
[19:27] about the weights what about the weights
[19:29] that beset us and I want to amplify that
[19:30] besetting here a little bit in a moment
[19:32] but he says and let us run with patience
[19:34] the race that is set before us looking
[19:37] unto Jesus the author and finisher of
[19:39] our faith
[19:41] when Paul says this looking unto Jesus
[19:43] he turns our face away from the weights
[19:45] turns our face away from the sin because
[19:48] we don't even want to be focused on that
[19:49] we don't want to spend our entire time
[19:52] trying to find weights trying to find
[19:53] sin but he says let's look unto Jesus I
[19:56] guess I would say that's part of laying
[19:57] aside every weight part of laying aside
[19:59] the sin that does so easily beset us is
[20:01] taking our eyes off the weights taking
[20:03] our eyes upon off the sin and looking to
[20:06] Jesus it refocuses us
[20:09] the the whole idea of removing uh laying
[20:12] aside the weight and the sin that does
[20:13] so easily beset us it kind of removes
[20:16] the red herring and I know I'm using
[20:17] general terminology to bring things
[20:19] under a particular rainbow or umbrella
[20:21] it takes us removes the red herring
[20:23] focuses on that rainbow trout
[20:25] it puts our eyes on that which matters
[20:28] and in the sermon Victory Day and I'll
[20:31] be reading from it again here towards
[20:33] the end
[20:34] but if you want to take it's actually
[20:36] during this time period where brother
[20:37] Adam's using the Looking Glass a lot and
[20:39] using the eyeglass and hunting and
[20:41] focusing he says now God is trying to
[20:43] get a man to look to that innocent
[20:46] substitute for a way back and man wants
[20:49] to look at it in his own way and I'd say
[20:51] that looking at your own way that's that
[20:52] red herring approach he says he don't
[20:55] want you to see that God is trying to
[20:56] show him in his innocent substitute
[20:59] therefore that's what's caused the
[21:01] trouble then when man does as it was
[21:03] picks up the glasses to view off in a
[21:06] long distance to see what God is trying
[21:07] to show him he fails to focus his
[21:10] glasses right
[21:11] so a man seemingly has control over what
[21:14] he focuses on he picks up the glasses
[21:17] now what are you going to zoom in on
[21:18] what are you going to zero in or what
[21:19] are you going to look at
[21:20] and and we have that autonomous we have
[21:22] that ability we have that opportunity to
[21:24] kind of zoom in on the things that we
[21:26] want to and he says God is wanting you
[21:27] to recognize the qualities of this
[21:30] innocent substitute he says but the
[21:31] problem is man wants to look at it his
[21:34] own way
[21:35] and he says in that sermon he looks so
[21:37] at so much of the natural he fails to
[21:40] see the spiritual application that the
[21:42] word gives
[21:43] and that reminded me of brother I'm
[21:45] saying oh seemingly not having the faith
[21:47] and Jude's saying they're sensual they
[21:50] separate themselves they they're looking
[21:52] so much to the Natural things they're
[21:54] looking so much to the red herring so
[21:56] much too uh the political things of it
[21:58] they're looking so much to the Natural
[22:00] carnal side of things that they fail to
[22:02] catch the spiritual application they
[22:04] fail to catch the depth of it that the
[22:06] word gives and he said this is all in
[22:09] the way we view things it's all in the
[22:10] way that we focus on things it's the way
[22:12] that we give things preeminence or give
[22:14] weight to certain things and quantify
[22:16] certain things he says it's it's a
[22:18] carnal or sensual approach it's very
[22:20] humanistic and when we do that we're not
[22:22] focusing on the right things
[22:26] the scripture here Bears much greater
[22:28] amplification than what I'll give it
[22:30] tonight but Paul writes and he says in
[22:32] First Corinthians chapter 3 verses 1 2
[22:34] and 3 says and I Brethren could not
[22:36] speak unto you as unto spiritual why
[22:38] couldn't he speak unto him as a
[22:40] spiritual but as unto carnal even as
[22:42] done to babes in Christ he had to speak
[22:44] to him in a way that addressed them in
[22:47] their immature state
[22:48] and so as I have fed you with milk and
[22:51] not with meat for hitherto you were not
[22:53] able to Bear it neither yet now are you
[22:55] able so he has to feed him with milk
[22:57] because Peter said the milk will cause
[22:59] you to grow and then you grow to a place
[23:01] where you can endure the meat it comes
[23:03] back to the Hebrews and talks about that
[23:04] he says for a year yet carnal now notice
[23:07] where the carnality Manifest itself for
[23:09] where is there is among you in being in
[23:11] strife and divisions are you not carnal
[23:14] and walk as men
[23:15] this is It's the idea of separation
[23:18] envying strife and divisions where would
[23:21] Indian come from looking at things
[23:23] carnally where does strife come from
[23:25] that's that divisiveness and division
[23:27] The Strife there means debate or
[23:29] differences it actually comes from the
[23:30] root of electioneering or party making
[23:33] where one is the word actually means
[23:35] seeking to win followers
[23:37] now as I said I'm not given as much
[23:39] tension to this as I ought to because
[23:41] that word can be used to be so precise
[23:44] on how sometimes we act around
[23:46] particular issues we see it a certain
[23:48] way and what do we start doing we start
[23:49] acting through Strife because we want
[23:51] others to see it the way we see it
[23:53] we want others to kind of see our side
[23:56] of things and we want to kind of pull
[23:57] people away to get it to view our
[23:59] standpoint and to view our angle and you
[24:01] ask yourself is it a red herring or is
[24:03] it the word of God if it's in the word
[24:04] of God we want to see it the right way
[24:06] we want to be shoulder to shoulder we
[24:07] want to be standing we want to see eye
[24:09] to eye as we come up this great Mount
[24:11] Zion but there's some things that we
[24:13] start electioneering about our party
[24:15] making that is nothing more than
[24:17] politicking to gain followers in a hair
[24:20] splitting agenda
[24:22] to see things a certain way and that's
[24:24] when Judah is saying you're sensual and
[24:26] you're trying to pull off to yourself
[24:27] followers and separate yourself from
[24:29] fellowship and policing the envious
[24:32] drives and divisions are the results of
[24:34] being carnal it's when through our
[24:36] Looking Glass we zoom in on the wrong
[24:38] things and things start to seem much
[24:41] larger than it ought to and we want to
[24:43] die on that mountain
[24:45] zoom in much larger on things that gets
[24:47] more Amplified and gets more weight than
[24:49] it ought to and we start attributing to
[24:51] so much value to this and this is the
[24:52] way it should be and this is the way
[24:54] things ought to be run and this is how
[24:55] we ought to see it and this is what we
[24:57] ought to be pursuing and when you take a
[24:59] step back from and refocus you realize
[25:00] oh my goodness that was such a red
[25:02] herring what was I thinking
[25:04] it's the result of being carnal this
[25:06] other man says they see so much of the
[25:08] natural of it and fail to see the
[25:10] spiritual application that the word
[25:11] gives and in many ways that's the exact
[25:13] rebuke that Paul was giving
[25:16] and so there has to be there has to be a
[25:19] a recognition
[25:21] of what matters
[25:25] in the sermon healing and what cancer is
[25:27] or healing and sometimes what cancer is
[25:29] Barbara says and I'm certainly I'm
[25:31] grateful to God that what he's doing in
[25:34] this last days and how that he's drawing
[25:36] men from everywhere to serve him
[25:39] and may this great drawing power he says
[25:41] it's the greatest drawing power that the
[25:43] world has ever known
[25:45] Jesus said if I be lifted up I'll draw a
[25:48] men unto me and if we'll just in the
[25:50] simple gospel draw Lift Jesus Christ up
[25:53] before the people he'll do the drawing
[25:55] it's the greatest magnet the world has
[25:58] ever known
[25:59] so there's only one thing that ought we
[26:01] ought to be magnetized to there's only
[26:02] one thing that ought to be party making
[26:04] that's the word of God certainly there
[26:07] would be no no no air in politicking for
[26:10] Christ there'd be no air in
[26:12] electioneering for Christ there'd be no
[26:13] air in seeking to win followers for
[26:15] Christ and so that's what ought to have
[26:18] the preeminence we ought to be honest
[26:19] with ourselves and we have to be very
[26:21] humble to be sure that we are lifting up
[26:24] Christ we're lifting up the word we're
[26:25] staying faithful to the message and and
[26:28] faithful to the things that it presents
[26:30] and it has taught us so that we're not
[26:32] lifting up the red herring they were not
[26:34] lifting up something else because if
[26:36] rather I'm saying that that's the
[26:38] greatest drawing power that's where if I
[26:40] be lifted up draw I'll draw them into me
[26:42] it's the greatest joint power the world
[26:43] has ever known that's what you want to
[26:45] lift up and let him draw people to him
[26:48] let him be the drawing card let him be
[26:50] the pull but as soon as you step away
[26:52] from that and you make an agenda an
[26:54] ideology a personal opinion that's when
[26:56] you're doing exactly what Paul was
[26:57] chastising the Christian the church for
[26:59] or your carnal and it's through strife
[27:01] and Indian
[27:02] politicking and causing divisions
[27:07] now I'm going to take a little bit of a
[27:09] different I'm still wanting to stay in
[27:11] that vein of looking Victory Day where
[27:12] he's talking about the glasses and
[27:14] focusing our glasses right and so much
[27:16] of my thought in red herring and
[27:19] rainbow trout was focusing on the right
[27:21] thing getting the right Focus
[27:22] and so this is a little bit of a change
[27:25] of subject matter but or change of
[27:28] terminology a little bit but red
[27:30] herrings we've established are
[27:31] distractions
[27:33] but they're distractions in the sense
[27:35] that if you if you think about it in
[27:37] terms of the original use of the the
[27:40] um the phrase the red herons used to
[27:43] throw
[27:43] um that is used in the one sets to throw
[27:45] a Hound off the scent of a fox
[27:48] and so a fox is following a scent it's a
[27:50] signal it's it's feedback he's he's
[27:52] following it and as long as he can catch
[27:55] that sin of the fox he can track that
[27:56] fox he can find where that fox is and he
[27:59] can get the prey he can meet his goal
[28:01] then the red herring comes along and
[28:03] it's to interrupt that scent and cause
[28:06] that Hound to pick up a different scent
[28:07] and chase after this pungent uh stinky
[28:10] fish
[28:11] and so the red herrings are distracted
[28:14] in that they send out a different scent
[28:16] or signal
[28:18] that mixes things up and you can't quite
[28:20] discern the scent of the fox
[28:23] so now if we're trying to relate that to
[28:24] the idea of red hair in a rainbow trout
[28:27] and if we're using in terms of what you
[28:28] want to eat I'm still talking about
[28:29] something being distracted and what you
[28:31] don't want to do is develop a taste for
[28:33] the red herring
[28:35] because it's very easy it'd be very easy
[28:37] for us to really enjoy debating certain
[28:39] things and getting caught up in certain
[28:41] things and there's an energy that comes
[28:42] with that you want to be careful that
[28:44] you don't take develop a proclivity or
[28:47] desire or leaning to red hair and say
[28:50] well I'm sorry brother but I kind of
[28:51] like red herring I kind of like
[28:53] anchovies I kind of like the taste I
[28:55] it's it's in our tradition it's in our
[28:57] blood I'm Norwegian we like to eat raw
[28:59] fish for breakfast and stinky things for
[29:02] lunch and there might be just certain
[29:03] things that you like and you enjoy you
[29:04] say hey as for me as for the word of God
[29:07] we don't want to develop a taste for
[29:09] anything that's not the fresh kill that
[29:11] Manna the word of God however you want
[29:13] to use these these words so the red
[29:15] herring distorts what we're trying to
[29:18] pick up
[29:19] and when we look use the example of
[29:21] fishing but everyone talks about in that
[29:22] third point he says there's little
[29:24] nibbles you feel something and what's
[29:27] the temptation just try to set the hook
[29:29] a little bump or something like this you
[29:31] got to be patient Got to Hold Steady
[29:32] there's little things that are trying to
[29:34] entice you into a hook set
[29:36] little things trying to get you to jerk
[29:39] the hook trying to get you to react to
[29:40] it and lose your patience but we want to
[29:43] stay patient because the rewards that
[29:44] that rainbow trout
[29:46] and so Paul says the Sin that does or
[29:49] the weight or the sin that does so
[29:50] easily beset us that phrase it means
[29:53] stand so conveniently around us
[29:57] you ever thought about it this way I'm
[29:58] sure that with such tremendous
[29:59] Ministries we have in the message today
[30:01] there's just no doubt you've probably
[30:03] heard it preached on even better and
[30:04] you've heard this before but the sin
[30:06] that does so easily beset us uh
[30:08] besetting kind of has this idea of It
[30:10] kind of pushes me down or it weighs me
[30:12] down it's a sin that trips me up but the
[30:14] word says so easily besets us it means
[30:16] that we are eagerly encircled by it
[30:19] it's it's so easily besets it so easily
[30:22] surrounds us
[30:24] it's much admired
[30:26] much applauded we have easy access to it
[30:29] one one way it's used in the term is it
[30:31] closely clings and encircles us
[30:35] so their sin that so easily besets us it
[30:38] it doesn't even necessarily have to be
[30:40] something that we're actively engaging
[30:42] in but it's right there at our disposal
[30:45] it encircles us it clings to us it's
[30:47] it's much applauded it's lifted up it's
[30:49] just so easy we're always being enticed
[30:52] by we're always being attracted by it's
[30:54] right there and when brother Brown says
[30:55] in this day we're unbelievers and
[30:57] scientists are trying to smother out the
[30:59] real value of the word of God it's the
[31:02] weight and the besetting sin that
[31:03] encircles us it's like as if one one uh
[31:07] translation described it as a robe that
[31:10] just surrounds us and tries to cling to
[31:12] us and encircles us and when you look at
[31:14] the context of the Hebrew church and I
[31:16] know I'm trying to take an entire book
[31:17] that's got so much wealth of information
[31:19] and distill it down but you can kind of
[31:21] pick up these Clues to the Hebrews they
[31:24] were under constant pressure to turn
[31:26] away from the mystery of Christ to a
[31:28] natural law that was tangible
[31:30] and there were there was constant
[31:31] pressure that you have these things that
[31:32] you can do and things that are
[31:34] discernible and can be touched and can
[31:36] be handled and Paul say no these are all
[31:38] types of the mystery of Christ who
[31:40] cannot be touched and he's trying to
[31:42] encourage him to remain steadfast and
[31:45] says don't don't lay aside your
[31:47] confidence don't cast that confidence
[31:49] away he says Ah you know don't don't lay
[31:51] aside every weight in the sin that does
[31:53] so easily beset you and he's imploring
[31:55] the Hebrew Church who are under constant
[31:57] pressure to reject the mystery of Christ
[31:59] and to turn to carnal things he's
[32:01] telling them to turn from all the noise
[32:04] turn from the distractions turn from the
[32:06] red herrings and focus on the word to
[32:08] see Christ
[32:10] and I what this is the warning that
[32:12] we're giving to the church just as a
[32:14] caution the red herons throw us off the
[32:16] track
[32:17] and it's that once once you've allowed
[32:19] once you've picked up the scent of the
[32:21] red heron and if you just begin to step
[32:22] after it just a little bit you'll get
[32:24] far away from your goal
[32:26] get far away from what matters we've
[32:29] been doing this as an exercise in our
[32:30] family since Sunday everything's a red
[32:32] herring right whenever you have a
[32:33] conversation no matter what you're
[32:34] talking about it's been me I'm the
[32:36] guilty party but you bring it back to a
[32:38] red herring but try this in your own in
[32:40] your own families whether it be a
[32:41] discussion with one of your children or
[32:43] between spouses that when you're trying
[32:45] to talk about an issue watch how easy it
[32:47] is for red herring to come up
[32:49] and then all of a sudden you're arguing
[32:51] the red herring and the red herring and
[32:53] the red herring and then you stop and
[32:55] you go wait a minute
[32:56] how did we end up here we're not even
[32:58] talking about the issue anymore
[33:00] way out over here debating something
[33:02] totally different why you followed the
[33:04] trail of the red herring
[33:06] and it gets you so far from what really
[33:08] counts to where this is just practical
[33:10] advice for any relationship so this is
[33:12] the bonus for being here on a Wednesday
[33:13] night before Thanksgiving is this is
[33:15] something to be in tune for because
[33:17] it'll keep you from solving just natural
[33:19] everyday problems whenever the red
[33:21] herring kind of sticks its head up you
[33:22] gotta like no I think that I got to
[33:24] recognize that that's something
[33:26] ancillary that's that's something maybe
[33:28] closely related or something
[33:30] tangential to this but it's not the real
[33:32] core this is not something that really
[33:34] matters we've got to come back to the
[33:36] goal because the red herrings throw us
[33:38] off track
[33:39] and I feel compelled to share this with
[33:42] you
[33:43] just to close with this thought that we
[33:45] are and I think I might have a oh you
[33:47] can use the slide now I think I have
[33:49] there we're entering into a very noisy
[33:51] season
[33:52] and and I mentioned noise I've been
[33:54] looking at the subject of noise
[33:56] and uh every sense is going to be
[33:59] enticed
[34:01] every when I say since every thought
[34:03] every ambition every desire is going to
[34:06] be targeted
[34:07] and and I can I'll just speak for myself
[34:11] personally
[34:12] right now as a personal testimony I'm
[34:15] fine I'm great
[34:16] but there's going to be something start
[34:18] getting inside my head tomorrow about
[34:19] all the Black Friday deals
[34:21] and I'd be wondering
[34:23] I probably should get that vacuum at
[34:26] Home Depot or I mean I've always wanted
[34:28] a really really really big trash can or
[34:31] can you believe it these gloves are only
[34:33] 2.99. and there's going to be things
[34:35] that you're just drawn like I got to get
[34:37] this this is this is a great deal and
[34:39] it's like you're you don't even scuba
[34:41] dive you know like but it's cheap it's
[34:43] like half price what if one day I want
[34:45] to do it and so there's a lot of things
[34:47] that are just bombarding us
[34:49] and and it's easy maybe to draw to it
[34:51] now in the time that we're living in or
[34:53] the season that we're coming into where
[34:55] it's coming from every angle we're being
[34:57] bombarded with it and there's ways that
[34:58] they're trying to entice us and and I
[35:00] think if you could just think about
[35:02] yourself how you feel fine you don't
[35:04] need anything else you're perfectly
[35:05] happy everything's working just fine but
[35:07] all it takes is just one email right
[35:09] from anthropology and you realize you
[35:11] know what maybe I could use more candles
[35:14] and and you're drawn to it and you're
[35:16] thinking this is everything was fine but
[35:19] now a Signal's been sent out and it
[35:21] starts working as I and I'm not saying
[35:23] any of this is wrong right these are the
[35:24] but these could be weights right I've
[35:27] learned my lesson in traveling don't
[35:29] carry on candles
[35:31] because the TSA is going to want to swab
[35:34] all 22 of them
[35:36] and they're they're heavy too
[35:38] but the in the terms of the noise and I
[35:41] say tis the season noise right it's just
[35:44] noise that comes and this is something
[35:46] that maybe we'll amplify it in Greater
[35:48] detail through some other services but
[35:50] the body is actually designed a human
[35:51] body is designed to react to
[35:54] environmental noise
[35:55] whether you realize it or not even while
[35:57] you're sleeping
[35:58] the body picks up on noise
[36:00] and the body's in tuned to things and
[36:02] can hear things and so even if you don't
[36:04] realize it the body responds to sound
[36:08] the body's responding to signals it's
[36:10] responding to things so even while
[36:12] you're sleeping you may not wake up but
[36:14] your body's responding to certain things
[36:15] that's why you could actually have
[36:17] dreams and in your dreams something's
[36:19] happening and you're incorporating other
[36:22] stimuli that you're actually hearing or
[36:24] feeling into your dream because the
[36:27] body's going to respond to it not unless
[36:29] it's maybe a very very deep thought or a
[36:30] very broad a more complex thought than
[36:33] we're amplifying tonight but there's our
[36:36] body will respond to noise
[36:40] and so it responding to noise let's just
[36:43] say there's a price to be paid if you're
[36:45] in a noisy environment
[36:47] and so in the time that we're living
[36:48] let's say if we enter in tomorrow's
[36:50] Thanksgiving Friday's Black Friday are
[36:52] we that Friday is Black Friday and as we
[36:55] go forward into these other things and
[36:56] we go forward into these uh this time of
[36:58] year in these Seasons it's very
[37:00] important for us to recognize and to
[37:02] realize that there's a lot of things
[37:04] that start getting into a fervor pitch
[37:06] and kind of get us excited and there's a
[37:08] lot of agitation and there's a lot of
[37:10] noise that's going to be in the world
[37:16] and so I'd say tis the season to be
[37:18] focused
[37:20] because there's a sub there's a
[37:22] subconscious price for entertaining red
[37:23] herrings
[37:25] and you may not recognize it you may not
[37:26] realize it and I want you to maybe draw
[37:28] that back we're not just talking about
[37:29] Thanksgiving and Christmas we're talking
[37:30] about in our daily lives there's a
[37:32] subconscious price to be paid for
[37:34] falling after red herrings and there's a
[37:36] spiritual price to be paid for Domin
[37:38] allowing red herons to dominate our
[37:39] attention so much
[37:41] just as a type this is a statement I
[37:43] came across one time people who live in
[37:45] cities experience chronically elevated
[37:47] levels of stress hormones and the people
[37:49] said
[37:50] amen people live in cities experience
[37:53] chronically elevated levels of stress
[37:55] hormones hormones especially cortisol
[37:57] increase one's blood pressure
[37:59] contributing to heart disease and
[38:00] cellular damage noise harms your body
[38:03] and boils your brain
[38:05] this is the conclusion this is what
[38:06] noise will do environmental noise these
[38:09] things it harms your body it boils your
[38:11] brain so just even noise making and
[38:14] sounds and certain things are harming
[38:16] your body and boiling your brain and
[38:18] even the word noise that it can be used
[38:20] in a sense of a even to being a pleasant
[38:23] sound and it can be used as a an
[38:25] utterance to get someone's attention but
[38:26] it means a clamor
[38:27] it there's one theory that it comes from
[38:29] the Latin word nausea
[38:31] meaning to discuss to annoy or
[38:33] discomfort another another theory traces
[38:36] it to a
[38:37] from an old French word to the Latin
[38:39] noxia which means to heart or to injure
[38:41] or to damage so we look at in that sense
[38:44] where there's the noise that hurts us
[38:45] there's noise that damages us there's
[38:47] noise that is a disgust it's an
[38:49] annoyance it causes nausea
[38:51] and this is I'm putting red herrings now
[38:53] this is where maybe there was a little
[38:54] bit of a switch in terminology red
[38:56] herrings are noise right it's things
[38:59] that are designed a flood of information
[39:01] a flood of opinions and news and facts
[39:03] and figures and all sorts of takes on
[39:05] different things and the politicization
[39:07] of uh events it's all trying to come and
[39:10] disturb our peace and deserve disturb
[39:12] our tranquility and you'd be better off
[39:15] staying away from them
[39:18] they've done a number of studies that
[39:20] kind of examined the difference between
[39:22] living in a calm Place uh you were in
[39:25] where you could maybe be out in the
[39:26] country or living in a place with a
[39:28] bunch of commotion or living in the
[39:29] midst of a city and the conclusion was
[39:32] every single study arrived at the same
[39:34] conclusion that noise and distraction
[39:36] are toxic
[39:38] and there's so much to be said about
[39:40] this noise and distraction are toxic red
[39:42] herons are toxic
[39:44] and and this I'm not talking about the
[39:46] actual fish that's is pickled and smoked
[39:49] and salted and that you eat maybe it is
[39:51] maybe it is a point at which you can eat
[39:52] so much of it it becomes toxic but a red
[39:54] herring in that analogy sense and that
[39:57] type of something that distracts it's
[39:59] toxic
[40:00] it is it is something that distracts it
[40:04] is something that is uh disturbs us it's
[40:07] it's noise and therefore it's toxic
[40:13] and the message perseverant
[40:16] brother Brown says the trouble of it is
[40:18] today that we American people are always
[40:20] looking for something big and bright
[40:23] and I kept thinking of that Christmas
[40:24] song may your days be merry
[40:26] and bright right
[40:29] and God don't do that something noisy
[40:32] what we look for is something big bright
[40:34] and noisy that's what that's what we
[40:36] like something that's big bright flashy
[40:38] noisy God can draw more water with the
[40:40] sun in five minutes than we can pump out
[40:42] of a noisy pump in 40 days I like that
[40:45] he says sure but we're looking for
[40:47] something big and noisy God is looking
[40:50] for something that is small and quiet
[40:51] now he's using the example of Elijah and
[40:54] and where he was out in that
[40:56] he's out in the cave
[40:58] and he says uh and there's the call that
[41:01] comes to him or there's he's told to go
[41:04] hide out in the cave and the Lord says
[41:05] the Lord pass by passes by and there was
[41:08] a wind earthquake and fire right maybe
[41:10] not in that order but there's this these
[41:11] things happen and those are the effects
[41:14] of God's passing by
[41:15] but none of it moved the prophet
[41:18] because he said those there's things
[41:20] that God can do and there's certain
[41:21] effects and we can say that can become
[41:23] the distraction that's what has the
[41:24] preeminence we talked about majoring on
[41:26] a minor a lot of people major on a minor
[41:28] yeah that comes from God but that's not
[41:29] the major you can only major on a major
[41:31] here he is Elijah's there he says the
[41:33] Russian wind the Thunder the smoke the
[41:35] earthquake none of those things ever
[41:37] attracted the prophet
[41:39] Elijah when he was in the cave but when
[41:41] he heard that still Small Voice God was
[41:43] in there he's in the still Small Voice
[41:46] not the big and flashy not the noisy
[41:48] then he come walking forth none of the
[41:50] rest of it could attract him it's
[41:52] something there's got to Anchor
[41:53] something's got to take place
[41:56] and so in this is just as this word of
[41:59] caution and this series is where these
[42:00] two Services were wrapping up on a red
[42:02] hair in a rainbow trout the rainbow
[42:04] trout is the word of God it's the third
[42:07] pull and there's a way that the world
[42:09] has dressed up the red herring there's a
[42:11] way that they've made it big and flashes
[42:13] a lot of things that get our attention
[42:14] it signals it's noise it's a lot of
[42:16] things that draw but that's not where
[42:18] God is God is stealing the still Small
[42:20] Voice he's in the simple things not in
[42:22] the great big flashy things
[42:24] something big and bright something noisy
[42:26] is what people want to run after he says
[42:28] but we're looking for something big and
[42:29] noisy God's looking for something that's
[42:31] small and quiet
[42:32] that's still small voice
[42:35] that rainbow trout
[42:37] and so picking up that thought again and
[42:39] or brother random in the Victory Day
[42:40] saying man wants to look at it in his
[42:42] own way and he sees so much to the
[42:44] Natural that he fails to take the
[42:45] spiritual application of the word that
[42:47] the word gives
[42:48] he says in the victory day and this kind
[42:49] of sum everything up I think it's a
[42:51] great summary quote because it pulls
[42:52] from all these different splittings and
[42:53] makings of differences where it doesn't
[42:56] matter he says now in that you see like
[42:59] our Pentecostal groups it's the grass
[43:01] root of that and he's talking about just
[43:03] even this
[43:04] uh the divisions what they do they get
[43:06] the focus well now here's a woman
[43:08] completes like lightning well there's no
[43:10] doubt about that at all absolutely I
[43:13] heard some women preachers could preach
[43:14] that men could even stand in the shadow
[43:16] a shadow of doing it
[43:19] but that doesn't have one thing to do
[43:20] with what's righteous see it doesn't
[43:22] have one so there's something that says
[43:24] something can be true but what is it in
[43:25] light of the word of God
[43:27] it says Paul said if one speaks in
[43:28] tongues there'd be no interpreter then
[43:29] let him hold his peace say I can't hold
[43:31] my peace but the Bible said you can see
[43:34] so that's it
[43:35] so these little things where there's
[43:37] these hair splitting these divisions and
[43:38] maybe so that's maybe not exactly hair
[43:40] splitting but it's these things where
[43:42] people don't want to come back to the
[43:43] word of God
[43:44] he says it must be done in order placed
[43:47] in order put in its right place and
[43:49] there remain ever in its place see there
[43:51] you get out of focus that was the main
[43:53] thing you see these examples he's using
[43:55] how things get out of focus and like oh
[43:57] but they can preach like lightning
[43:58] you're focused on the wrong thing I
[44:00] can't hold my peace it doesn't matter
[44:02] you're focused on the wrong things that
[44:04] causes hard feelings greed and so forth
[44:06] that's what causes hard feelings that's
[44:09] what causes splits that's what causes
[44:10] divisions when the focus isn't on the
[44:12] word of God he says instead of focusing
[44:14] ourselves back with the word we focus
[44:16] ourselves out and see well let them do
[44:18] what they want what they see see like
[44:20] that just the way then now we find that
[44:23] it breaks up the fellowship of homes it
[44:26] breaks up the fellowship of churches it
[44:28] breaks up the fellowships of Nations
[44:29] that same thing
[44:30] what is it a lack of focus
[44:34] a lack of focus is what causes it so if
[44:36] we all focused on the right thing then
[44:38] we'd stay we'd stay in Union
[44:40] and let me say this we're never given
[44:43] permission to take our Focus off the
[44:45] word of God for the sake of unity
[44:47] so you say oh well let's we all want to
[44:49] be one big happy family well I want to
[44:51] be focused together and well this
[44:52] group's pulling this way to do this
[44:53] alone and we're getting a lot of
[44:55] pressure on this side that we've got to
[44:56] do this there's a lot of pressure to do
[44:57] that and we never take our Focus off the
[45:00] word of God for the sake of broader
[45:01] Fellowship for the sake of drawing a
[45:03] bigger Circle as it were we cannot do
[45:05] that so it ever Remains the Same as if
[45:08] we all focused on the word of God
[45:10] there'd be Unity so where does the
[45:11] division start as soon as we take our
[45:13] eyes off the word of God and then there
[45:15] comes that pressure to conform by taking
[45:17] our eyes off the word of God
[45:19] but then that's he says that's what
[45:21] breaks up Fellowship of homes it's what
[45:22] causes hard feelings it's what breaks up
[45:24] churches fellowships among churches
[45:27] and so in a similar thought brother
[45:29] branham's preaching this
[45:31] Victory Day then the very next week and
[45:33] the sermon look it might have actually
[45:34] been here in Phoenix
[45:36] he says we must cope Our Lives
[45:39] and focus it in to the word of God
[45:42] just like that we would a picture camera
[45:46] or try to get the right Focus before we
[45:48] snap it and then we've got the real true
[45:51] picture
[45:53] tis the season for family pictures right
[45:56] they said the time of year where
[45:58] everyone fights goes out and finds or
[46:01] buys matching outfits and thinks of the
[46:03] best place to get pictures and think of
[46:04] all the effort that's put into getting
[46:05] that shot to put on the Christmas cards
[46:08] right can we all agree that's what why
[46:10] people aren't here tonight is they're
[46:11] getting family pictures right or at
[46:13] least the neighbor in the apartment next
[46:15] door
[46:16] he says just like getting a camera
[46:18] picture camera you try to get the right
[46:21] Focus before we snap it and then we got
[46:23] the real true picture think of all the
[46:25] effort in getting the shot just right he
[46:27] says that's what we want to do with our
[46:28] lives cope Our Lives to focus it in on
[46:31] the word of God that's what we want to
[46:32] do to focus our lives into Jesus Christ
[46:35] and I love this phrase
[46:37] that Christ and you become the same
[46:39] person
[46:40] think about that in terms of focus if
[46:42] you have something out of focus
[46:43] sometimes you see two
[46:45] but then when you get it focused in
[46:47] those binoculars or something once you
[46:49] get the glass just right those two
[46:50] images come together and you no longer
[46:52] singing seeing two you see the saying
[46:55] and that's what that's what we want to
[46:56] do as long as there's a red herring
[46:58] there's going to be a division
[47:00] it's going to be a separation but if you
[47:02] can get your eyes off of this and focus
[47:03] in on the word of God then you in Christ
[47:05] he says focus our lives into Jesus
[47:07] Christ that Christ in you become the
[47:11] same person
[47:13] let's not get distracted in this
[47:14] endeavor let's go let's not get
[47:16] distracted in our desire to see that
[47:18] Christ have the preeminence so I say for
[47:21] Thanksgiving let's enjoy some rainbow
[47:24] trout
[47:25] Happy Thanksgiving to all of you thank
[47:27] you so much for coming out to the house
[47:28] the lord it's been a privilege being
[47:30] with you let's Stand Together
