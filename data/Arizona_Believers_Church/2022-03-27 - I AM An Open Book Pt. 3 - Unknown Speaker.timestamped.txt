[0:00] the announcement i'd like to make uh i'd
[0:02] like to preface it first by saying it's
[0:05] been a while since we kind of had a
[0:06] business meeting or discussed
[0:09] things related to our facilities our
[0:11] where we're meeting and what our future
[0:13] might look like
[0:14] and several months ago we had a meeting
[0:17] in this very room in which we discussed
[0:19] kind of our
[0:21] vision in terms of where we meet a
[0:22] church facility a worship facility and
[0:24] we broke it up into
[0:26] three
[0:27] visions or goals we have an interim
[0:29] short term and a long term and interim
[0:31] is this what we've been doing pop-up
[0:33] scenario where your shared space or
[0:35] you're having to set up and tear down
[0:37] something that you don't want to do long
[0:40] term but it's fitting meeting a need
[0:43] in the interim
[0:44] and then our short-term goal was to find
[0:46] something that we could call our own we
[0:49] could park our stuff brother john could
[0:50] get his truck back
[0:52] and um and free them up a few hours of
[0:55] each one of their wednesdays and sundays
[0:57] and a place that we could call our own
[0:58] and even if it was just a year to three
[1:00] years it was kind of a short-term rental
[1:02] scenario
[1:03] that we uh and it's a place that we
[1:05] could actually maybe print out something
[1:07] that says this is our address and make
[1:09] an announcement that we're here because
[1:11] right now it's still just kind of been
[1:12] in this interim phase
[1:14] and then obviously i believe this is
[1:16] obvious our long-term desire is to
[1:18] purchase a facility or even build
[1:20] something
[1:21] and many of you have been very gracious
[1:23] and giving to a building fund and all
[1:24] the monies that are given to the
[1:26] building fund are designated for our
[1:28] long-term vision to have a place that we
[1:31] could call our own that we could grow
[1:33] into in the future and that it would be
[1:35] something that's
[1:37] solely ours
[1:39] and on this past thursday well uh well
[1:42] for 19 months we've been doing that for
[1:44] 19 months we've been in this interim
[1:45] phase and we've been renting uh hotel
[1:49] space
[1:50] and for the hilton here which has been
[1:52] over a year i think it's maybe been
[1:53] close to 14 months it's been a it's been
[1:55] a good home
[1:56] and the hilton guardian has been very
[1:57] good to us
[1:58] and we've appreciated everything they've
[2:00] extended to us and despite some bumps in
[2:03] the road and some difficulties and some
[2:05] surprises
[2:06] it's been it's been nice to be here this
[2:08] past thursday about 11 o'clock in the
[2:10] morning i received an email
[2:12] and informing us that they're increasing
[2:14] our rent four times
[2:16] and so we've been paying around three
[2:17] thousand dollars a month uh in rent and
[2:20] they said if we want to keep this place
[2:22] um with any kind of certainty then there
[2:24] we have to pay 12 000 a month
[2:27] and so i'm just asking if anybody here
[2:29] would be willing to
[2:32] and so
[2:33] everything changed and so if you'll just
[2:36] listen listen instead of maybe letting
[2:39] your minds run wild with this i'm not
[2:41] announcing
[2:42] this is our last service but i am
[2:45] announcing that this may very well be
[2:47] our last service in this building and in
[2:50] this facility and not to get everyone to
[2:52] get weepier or nostalgic it's been it's
[2:55] been wonderful being here and some of
[2:57] the testimonies that we received from
[2:58] not ones that have visited even
[3:00] ministers that have ministered here is
[3:01] like you have you have no awareness at
[3:04] all that you're in a hotel you're in a
[3:06] church
[3:07] um even one brother said when he
[3:09] ministered here when he stepped in he
[3:10] walked in the sanctuary it took his
[3:12] breath away he said because when we
[3:14] stream your services all we see is you
[3:15] in a little box
[3:17] and he says we think that's all it is i
[3:19] think some of my friends think i'm just
[3:21] playing church
[3:22] and uh and he said but you walk in and
[3:24] it's a gigantic banquet hall and every
[3:27] seat is full and he said it took his
[3:28] breath away and the atmosphere and the
[3:30] presence and that's a credit to you
[3:32] uh not the hilton
[3:34] and so it's been wonderful being here
[3:35] but this very well may be our very last
[3:37] service we only have an agreement and a
[3:39] contract through wednesday night
[3:42] but
[3:43] that said thursday i'd say thursday
[3:45] everything changed and immediately
[3:48] um
[3:49] i was probably in the flesh and more
[3:51] panicky than in the spirit believing
[3:53] that everything would be okay but god
[3:55] immediately began to work and to maybe
[3:59] keep the announcement somewhat brief we
[4:01] may have already found a new place
[4:04] to worship
[4:05] it's just less than five miles away from
[4:08] here
[4:08] it's a wonderful location it's even an
[4:10] area that has come up frequently over
[4:12] the last year when we've been looking
[4:13] for a place
[4:15] that we could either buy or rent
[4:18] and it's a place that we could call our
[4:20] own but it still would be short term
[4:23] it would be different than this
[4:25] and there'd be some changes but it's
[4:27] very it's a very real possibility um
[4:29] that wednesday night if possible we may
[4:31] be gathering there to have service
[4:34] um at the very least i'm not really
[4:36] interested in paying 15 1500 for next
[4:39] sunday service here
[4:40] but we will have church
[4:43] god god's people will make a way we're
[4:46] taught in the word of god that life
[4:48] makes a way
[4:49] uh we were doing a hike here in sedona
[4:52] a little trip in sedona we were looking
[4:53] at this
[4:54] wall this just a giant wall
[4:57] of rock and then in the middle you know
[4:59] 100 feet up and and 200 feet from the
[5:02] top just growing out of the side of it
[5:03] as a cactus
[5:05] it's like life makes a way
[5:07] it's gonna make a way and i believe that
[5:08] there's life here and that regardless of
[5:10] what circumstances we're facing and if
[5:12] it seems to be that something happens
[5:14] and we have to get very unique where we
[5:16] gather if we if we happen to miss a
[5:18] service nobody should panic
[5:20] we are a church god will give us a place
[5:23] to worship and so be in prayer because
[5:25] it
[5:26] i feel very encouraged that the deacons
[5:28] and trustees met yesterday
[5:30] um and looked at the facility and it was
[5:32] a resounding yes from those who saw it
[5:34] and so we're just right now it's just a
[5:36] matter of formalizing it and it's a it's
[5:38] another church that would be renting to
[5:40] us a facility that they own but it's
[5:42] it's vacant it's ready for a church to
[5:44] move into it
[5:45] and um they've been kind enough to say
[5:48] you know even if you guys just want to
[5:49] try it out i'm sure we can work
[5:50] something out so it looks like it's a
[5:52] very real possibility so keep it in
[5:54] prayer
[5:55] and stay tuned
[5:57] subscribe to the channel
[5:58] is it mash the subscribe button or
[6:00] whatever
[6:02] turn on notifications because you may
[6:04] need to know where we're going to church
[6:05] wednesday if you want to be in church
[6:07] and so regardless if we're meeting here
[6:09] one last time
[6:10] be
[6:12] reaching out call if you don't know
[6:13] where we're having service if you
[6:14] haven't heard call somebody reach out to
[6:16] me
[6:18] do something to find out because i don't
[6:20] believe we'll be here next sunday
[6:22] and by god's grace by god's grace
[6:26] we'll all just be at that meeting in the
[6:27] air
[6:29] and we've already got that in our gps
[6:32] right amen god bless you let's stand
[6:34] together
[6:40] if you turn in your bibles to second
[6:42] corinthians chapter 3 verses 1 to 18 it
[6:45] is the entire chapter
[6:47] i realize already
[6:49] time is getting away from me but i want
[6:51] to read the entire chapter because i
[6:53] hope
[6:54] to and even though it might get kind of
[6:56] pushed off a little bit
[6:58] and like for this to be in our thoughts
[7:00] because i'd like to come back to a few
[7:01] verses here
[7:03] and bear this in mind paul
[7:05] as he goes through
[7:07] this first part
[7:09] focus
[7:10] very uh intently on
[7:13] you being a written epistle
[7:16] and then
[7:18] the ministry of the glory of the lord
[7:21] and how that paul is talking about a new
[7:24] covenant or a new testament
[7:26] do we begin
[7:27] again to commend ourselves or need we as
[7:30] some others epistles of commendation to
[7:31] you or letters of commendation from you
[7:34] ye are our epistle written in our hearts
[7:36] known and read of all men for as much as
[7:38] ye are manifestly declared to be the
[7:40] epistle of christ ministered by us they
[7:45] the people
[7:46] who have received the message from paul
[7:49] are
[7:50] the
[7:51] the the book of christ the epistle of
[7:54] christ that he ministered written not
[7:56] with ink but with the spirit of the
[7:57] living god
[7:58] not in tables of stone but in the
[8:00] fleshly tables of the heart
[8:02] very important to hold that in mind and
[8:05] in your hearts because it's kind of more
[8:06] of a
[8:07] what i'm looking at
[8:09] in terms of my vision in this these
[8:10] services in such trust have we through
[8:13] christ to godward not that we are
[8:14] sufficient of ourselves to think
[8:16] anything as of ourselves but our
[8:18] sufficiency is of god who also hath made
[8:21] us able ministers of the new testament
[8:24] not of the letter but of the spirit for
[8:27] the letter killeth but the spirit giveth
[8:29] life and relate that back to verse three
[8:32] where is the spirit of the living god it
[8:35] is writing the word in the hearts of of
[8:37] the people
[8:39] verse 7 but if the menstruation of death
[8:41] ministration of death written and
[8:43] engraven in stones was glorious so that
[8:45] the children of israel could not
[8:47] steadfastly behold the face of moses for
[8:49] the glory of his countenance which glory
[8:51] was to be done away how shall not the
[8:53] ministration of the spirit be rather
[8:55] glorious but the ministration of
[8:57] condemnation be glory much more do the
[8:59] ministration of righteousness exceeding
[9:01] glory
[9:02] remember what these prior verses
[9:05] are saying and so who is he talking
[9:06] about what is he referring to what depth
[9:08] is there in this
[9:10] for even that which hath made was made
[9:12] glorious has had no glory in this
[9:15] respect by reason of the glory that
[9:17] excelleth for that which is done away
[9:19] was glorious much more that which
[9:21] remaineth is glorious sin then that we
[9:23] have such hope we use great plainness of
[9:26] speech
[9:27] and not as moses which put a veil over
[9:29] his face the children of israel could
[9:30] not steadfastly look to the end at that
[9:33] which is abolished but their minds are
[9:35] blinded for until this day remaineth the
[9:38] same veil
[9:40] untaken away in the reading of the old
[9:43] testament which veil is done away in
[9:45] christ but even unto this day when moses
[9:48] is read the veil is upon their heart
[9:50] nevertheless when it shall turn to the
[9:52] lord the veil shall be taken away
[9:54] now the lord is that spirit where the
[9:57] spirit of the lord is there is liberty
[9:59] but we all with open face beholding as
[10:02] in a glass the glory of the lord are
[10:04] changed into the same image from glory
[10:07] to glory even as by the spirit
[10:10] of the lord what a beautiful beautiful
[10:13] chapter god bless you you can be seated
[10:19] i feel that that just reads
[10:21] in itself a sermon an outline
[10:24] of of this thought that i'm considering
[10:27] on i am
[10:29] an open book the i am is god himself
[10:33] it is the absolute one who is
[10:34] indivisible
[10:35] uh there's nothing that can compare to
[10:37] him incomparable
[10:39] and he is the one that caused all things
[10:41] to be or to exist
[10:43] and when we
[10:45] are taking the i am and putting him in
[10:47] view what we're wanting to do is to
[10:48] consider the nature of god and how this
[10:51] i am
[10:52] makes himself known
[10:54] or how he manifests himself because he's
[10:56] he's not uh he's not man
[10:59] that we could know him through human
[11:01] discipline he's not man that we could
[11:03] know him just by meeting him
[11:05] he's transcendent uh beyond humanity and
[11:09] he's something that is hidden
[11:11] so there's uh this is the that's what
[11:13] we're looking at is the i am so when we
[11:15] step take a step forward into an open
[11:17] book we're looking at something that in
[11:20] that terminology something easily
[11:22] interpreted readily examined something
[11:24] that can be thoroughly
[11:25] understood
[11:26] or easily understood
[11:28] and we're wanting god to be made known
[11:30] to us we want to understand him we want
[11:31] to know him so i am an open book
[11:34] something that he is to us
[11:36] and a closed book is we were looking at
[11:38] paul saying we look through a glass
[11:40] darkly it means there's a mystery there
[11:42] he says but then face to face and as he
[11:45] mentioned here in our text one day as
[11:47] he's we're beholding him with open face
[11:49] there's this mystery being removed
[11:51] there's something that we're knowing and
[11:52] understanding something being declared
[11:54] to us it made known
[11:56] he's alluding to a closed book versus an
[11:58] open book and that that closed book is
[12:00] something difficult to know something
[12:02] difficult to understand a puzzle an
[12:04] enigma
[12:06] and
[12:07] those are just some keys key things from
[12:09] the prior two services i wanted to bring
[12:12] back in there so now when we step
[12:14] forward from the i am jesus said in john
[12:17] chapter 8 verse 58 verily verily i say
[12:19] unto you before abraham was i am
[12:23] so jesus christ was
[12:25] and is the manifestation of the i am so
[12:28] that enigma that puzzle that closed book
[12:31] he's saying when you've seen me you have
[12:33] seen the father there is a the hidden
[12:36] mystery of god is being made known in
[12:38] jesus christ that's why i say christ is
[12:40] the mystery of god revealed god hiding
[12:43] himself god being mysterious god being
[12:45] invisible now when you've seen me you've
[12:48] seen the father this invisible god now
[12:50] made tangible now made flesh now
[12:52] appearing uh before his uh his elect or
[12:56] chosen ones
[12:57] and he said i am the manifestation of
[12:59] god in flesh and what we wanted to
[13:02] identify
[13:03] is it was not just god's appearing with
[13:06] his people or a glimpse of god so it
[13:08] wasn't just elohim appearing it just
[13:10] wasn't god appearing to his people as he
[13:13] had done through the prophets and
[13:14] through supernatural signs and wonders
[13:16] but this was his coming this was his
[13:18] presence with those that he said he
[13:21] would make himself known to and it was
[13:24] all foreshadowed and spoken of before
[13:26] him
[13:26] brother brahman said it this way
[13:28] he was the perfect identical image of
[13:31] the promise and the masterpiece he was
[13:34] the perfect identical image of the
[13:36] promise therefore all promises the old
[13:39] testament was met in jesus christ quite
[13:42] a phrase all promises of the old
[13:43] testament met in jesus christ again you
[13:46] can say oh well does that mean there's
[13:47] no prophecies or promises left in the
[13:49] old testament to be fulfilled
[13:51] no there are other ones that are to be
[13:53] fulfilled but the point is what was the
[13:57] emphasis what was the mystery what was
[13:59] the goal what was what need what did the
[14:01] old testament point to
[14:03] the old testament alone just wasn't
[14:05] pointing to maybe some of these uh other
[14:07] things but there was this process that
[14:09] had to unfold and if the old testament
[14:10] has a promise of a millennium you can
[14:12] never come to the millennium until you
[14:14] came to the promise of the redeemer
[14:16] the messiah so he's saying it just it
[14:18] fulfills all the promise the old
[14:20] testament it's met in jesus christ
[14:22] because the millennium is what this
[14:24] christ will bring it's what comes from
[14:26] him so it's all central to him
[14:29] so jesus when he's on earth
[14:32] and he's uh he's ministering
[14:34] he takes
[14:36] he he challenges them in john chapter 5
[14:38] verse 39 he says search the scriptures
[14:41] for in them you think you have eternal
[14:42] life and they are they which testify of
[14:46] me
[14:47] very remarkable statement search the
[14:50] scriptures he gives that
[14:51] credence to the written word of god
[14:53] search the scriptures but then he points
[14:56] to also the living word of god and how
[14:59] just to take the letter alone it can
[15:01] leave you in balance so he lifts up the
[15:03] written word but then he says you have
[15:04] to identify where the written word is
[15:07] being made flesh
[15:09] and this is a challenge you could make
[15:10] to people who are very ardent believers
[15:13] in the bible and say if the bible is
[15:15] true show me where it's being lived out
[15:18] does the bible say that he'll give unto
[15:20] you uh pastors and evangelists and
[15:22] teachers if the bible say that there's
[15:24] to be that you're to take the feet wash
[15:26] defeat washing and take communion if
[15:28] these are promises in the word of god
[15:30] where is it being lived out
[15:32] where is it being manifested where is it
[15:33] being expressed
[15:35] and and so there says he's saying look
[15:37] into the scriptures because they
[15:40] testified they were a testament and a
[15:42] testimony of me so here i am they were
[15:45] all saying i'm coming and now here i am
[15:48] and it works to where he's saying i'm
[15:50] here now look and see if i don't fulfill
[15:53] exactly what it said i would be
[15:56] and then it says in psalm 40 verse 7
[15:59] speaking of christ then said i lo i come
[16:03] in the i come so here i come
[16:06] and in the volume of the book it is
[16:07] written of me to what i delight to do
[16:10] thy will oh my god yay thy law is within
[16:13] my heart this is the the utterance psalm
[16:15] 40 verses 7 and 8 this utterance of i
[16:17] come and my delight is to do thy will o
[16:20] god thy law is written in my heart and
[16:22] we read last time i'm going to declare
[16:24] i'm going to speak i'm going to manifest
[16:26] this is what's in my heart to do and
[16:28] he's saying this is written in the
[16:30] volume of the book
[16:32] the volume of the book the book it was
[16:35] written of me that i will come to do thy
[16:38] will
[16:39] and in the volume of the book it's this
[16:40] image of a scroll something i come in
[16:42] the the role of the book in the uh the
[16:45] pentateuch the those the when they said
[16:46] the book it was moses's writings when he
[16:48] said to this day when moses has read
[16:50] it's referring to those first five books
[16:52] of the bible to them that was their book
[16:55] the remaining remainder of the old
[16:56] testament was still being compiled still
[16:58] being put together but they had this law
[17:01] that god had vindicated by his presence
[17:03] this law that he had vindicated by a
[17:04] pillar of fire this law that he had
[17:06] vindicated by his uh by signs and
[17:09] wonders he's saying i it's written of me
[17:11] in the volume of the book the the
[17:14] everything in genesis
[17:16] and and these preceding books they speak
[17:18] of me
[17:21] and so the coming of christ was
[17:22] prophesied
[17:24] and written in the volume the role the
[17:26] scroll of the law
[17:28] and and we identified how that
[17:31] and we'll come to it here in a moment
[17:33] how that when
[17:34] when he came
[17:36] now in a spiritual sense when he came he
[17:38] opened the book
[17:40] the volume of the book was being opened
[17:42] up
[17:43] and therefore while it's being
[17:44] manifested we use this language light is
[17:46] shining on the word how is light shining
[17:48] on the word not not to read it but it's
[17:51] giving understanding enlightenment oh
[17:53] that's what that meant
[17:56] and and i have it in my heart to maybe
[17:57] take time to do this but when you read
[18:00] especially i think it's in the book of
[18:01] matthew that it says jesus did this that
[18:03] it might be fulfilled as it's written by
[18:05] the prophets and that this has been
[18:07] fulfilled and then you go back and you
[18:09] read the original prophecy and you go
[18:10] well i would have never guessed that's
[18:11] what it would
[18:12] be right because light's now shining on
[18:15] the word
[18:16] and this is what it meant this is what
[18:18] it referred to when it happened and so
[18:20] there's that's what the light is shining
[18:22] it's a living reality it's manifested
[18:25] and so
[18:26] is he saying in psalm 40 the word is
[18:28] into him it's not hid it's being
[18:29] expressed it's been declared it's not
[18:31] being concealed once he comes the volume
[18:34] of the book is now opened up
[18:36] and it's the open of the book it's not
[18:38] concealed i have declared i have not hid
[18:40] this word that is in me it's now being
[18:43] expressed
[18:44] and this statement we had ready for last
[18:47] week but
[18:48] we didn't we didn't read it to you but
[18:50] this is very this summarizes
[18:53] very well last sunday and i i do feel
[18:56] today there's a tremendous amount of
[18:57] overlap to last week but it's done just
[18:59] to uh to be able to take just another
[19:02] half step perhaps
[19:04] he was the word made light or became
[19:06] light the word in that generation he was
[19:09] the word light of that generation
[19:11] because the prophets of old had spoke of
[19:13] him and here he come and vindicated he
[19:16] was the light of god's spoken word
[19:18] all the prophets had said had been
[19:20] fulfilled in him see the prophets back
[19:23] here in the word
[19:24] like god was at the beginning when he
[19:26] said let there be light and light came
[19:28] now the prophet said a virgin shall
[19:30] conceive bring forth the son they shall
[19:32] call his name emmanuel for it'll be god
[19:34] with us
[19:35] now to to israel even to this day
[19:39] and i don't know if it's kind of a
[19:40] counter belief to the prevalence of
[19:42] christianity and the point into this
[19:44] scripture
[19:45] they wouldn't necessarily construct that
[19:48] verse to be
[19:50] a
[19:50] prophecy of a messiah born of a virgin
[19:54] but that's what it was
[19:57] so when it happened
[19:59] it is
[20:00] uh
[20:02] it light is shining on it he said now
[20:04] they spoke it the word had went out but
[20:06] he was the light the word goes out but
[20:07] he's like he's the manifestation
[20:09] what was he and i guess i could just
[20:11] keep reading instead of adding my side
[20:13] notes here what was he the fulfillment
[20:15] hallelujah he was the fulfillment of
[20:17] that word he was the manifestation of
[20:20] that word
[20:22] the word goes out so the word can go
[20:23] i've got the word i've got the word but
[20:25] then there is a manifestation of that
[20:28] word a fulfillment of that word it says
[20:31] now in all ages god has set forth so
[20:33] much of his word for each age important
[20:35] to recognize this
[20:36] dispensations a giving out of promises
[20:39] that relate to this age to this age to
[20:42] this person
[20:43] to this time
[20:45] god always sends somebody that that word
[20:48] can get into and show the light of it
[20:51] say that's me
[20:53] claim it you not me you that's you
[20:57] that every age that does the same thing
[20:59] always does it he was the fulfillment as
[21:01] i said of all the divine holy powers of
[21:04] the prophets old testament prophets he's
[21:06] the fulfillment of it they were looking
[21:08] to this time of the messiah they were
[21:10] looking to that time that he would come
[21:11] they were minor gods when the word of
[21:13] lord came to a man jesus said himself
[21:15] that he was a god you know that he said
[21:17] if your law said and your father's back
[21:19] there called them who the word of god
[21:20] come to call them gods how can you
[21:22] condemn me saying when i said i am the
[21:24] son of god when the very god himself we
[21:26] spoke the word through the prophets he
[21:28] was the very he was the manifestation of
[21:30] that spoken word and if the prophet was
[21:32] called to god because he was the
[21:34] manifestation of another prophet's word
[21:36] notice that language how can you condemn
[21:38] him when he was the same thing he was
[21:40] the son of god as he shall be called the
[21:42] son of god he was the long-promised
[21:45] messiah that the world had waited on he
[21:47] was the messiah's promise made manifest
[21:51] the old testament
[21:53] standing before the embodiment of their
[21:55] scroll
[21:57] the mystery of that scroll
[21:59] made known to them the mystery of the
[22:01] law the mystery of the prophecies of the
[22:03] old testament are standing there and i'm
[22:05] wanting you to look at it in the sense
[22:07] of and maybe i'm using a language i
[22:08] think that should open up other things
[22:11] to see it in this terminology not to try
[22:13] to force it into this terminology but
[22:16] using this to emphasize a truth
[22:18] something had been hid covered up
[22:20] unknown mysterious
[22:22] the veil is being taken away it's it's
[22:25] being removed as christ stands there and
[22:27] he's making himself known and he's
[22:28] manifest himself he said behold the one
[22:31] that god said would come behold the seat
[22:34] of the woman from genesis 3 15
[22:37] behold the son of god that adam should
[22:39] have brought forth behold the one that
[22:41] was to be the the continuation of the
[22:43] image of god here he is standing there
[22:46] it's a book being opened
[22:49] as we read in luke chapter 4 verses 17
[22:51] to 21 as he comes to the temple as was
[22:54] his custom it says and there was
[22:55] delivered unto him the book of the
[22:57] prophet isaiah and when he had opened
[22:59] the book
[23:01] notice this beautiful symbolism this
[23:03] imagery as he comes to his ministry
[23:05] after his baptism and he comes to his
[23:06] ministry he comes to the temple and luke
[23:08] is describing one of these first acts of
[23:11] of christ and what is it it's to go and
[23:13] take a scroll the old testament the word
[23:16] the book of isaiah
[23:17] and which he's even symbolic of even the
[23:19] entire bible with its 66 chapters he
[23:22] takes it what and unfolds it
[23:24] and he's opening it up and he says and
[23:26] he found the place where it was written
[23:28] what of him
[23:30] he finds the place it was written so he
[23:32] opens the book finds himself in the word
[23:34] of god and we'll skip to verse 20 and
[23:36] after he recites the prophecy pertaining
[23:38] to himself he gets right up to in the
[23:40] middle of a verse that that's there's
[23:42] not light shining on that yet and what
[23:44] does he do he closes the book
[23:47] because the entire bible isn't the
[23:49] entire bible is going to be a mystery
[23:51] there's still another part that needs to
[23:52] be written there's still another part
[23:54] that needs to unfold so he closes it
[23:56] back up and he says in verse 20 and he
[23:58] closed the book and gave it again to the
[24:00] minister and sat down and the eyes of
[24:02] all them that were in the synagogue were
[24:04] fasted on him
[24:06] the opening of the book got their
[24:07] attention
[24:09] and he began to say to them this day
[24:11] this scripture
[24:13] is this scripture fulfilled in your ears
[24:16] maybe that's a good sermon to go listen
[24:18] to
[24:18] to refresh our rehearse in our ears and
[24:21] refresh ourselves of this day
[24:23] is this scripture fulfilled in our ears
[24:26] what what what scriptures are being
[24:27] fulfilled he says it's fulfilled
[24:29] manifested
[24:32] he's there now he's going to begin his
[24:33] ministry he's going to go forth
[24:35] and and do these works in the
[24:37] fulfillment of
[24:39] the old testament
[24:40] and so in opening the book
[24:43] he's unfolding that scroll became a
[24:45] manifested reality of the promise
[24:47] now
[24:48] i'm just using the scripture maybe in in
[24:50] symbolism that when he closed the book
[24:53] you could
[24:54] there's this what i've emphasized to
[24:55] this point
[24:56] is that there's still more that was
[24:58] coming that need to be manifested
[25:01] but he takes the scroll
[25:04] and as he unfolds and he reads
[25:06] he reads so far
[25:08] and then what does he do
[25:09] he scrolls it back up
[25:12] because even though light is shining on
[25:15] the word and it's made manifest you
[25:17] can't recognize the manifestation
[25:20] without revelation
[25:23] it just won't dawn on you it could be
[25:24] staring you in the face and unless god
[25:27] reveals it to you
[25:29] light shining on the word isn't going to
[25:32] quicken you unless revelation comes and
[25:34] stimulates you
[25:36] so in that way when you close the book
[25:38] it's symbolic of the fact that all eyes
[25:41] are fastened on him they're looking at
[25:42] the very manifestation of the word of
[25:44] god and he closes the book saying that
[25:46] unless god opens your eyes you'll never
[25:48] see me
[25:50] so there's still a rep it needed a
[25:52] revelation to see the manifestation
[25:54] and brother adam says and what shall i
[25:56] do with jesus called christ when jesus
[25:58] come as the anointed messiah and done
[26:00] just exactly what the word of god said
[26:02] he would do
[26:03] and yet the jews were looking for
[26:05] something else
[26:07] a king coming with a rod of iron in his
[26:08] hand which was way in the future but he
[26:10] fulfilled every word there one day in
[26:13] capernaum when he picked up the
[26:14] scriptures and read did you notice he
[26:15] just read part of that scripture and
[26:17] then he laid the book down and said
[26:18] today this is fulfilled
[26:21] the anointed messiah the word of god
[26:23] made manifest he fulfilled every word
[26:25] and yet the jews were looking for
[26:27] something else
[26:28] and you know i know everyone here is
[26:31] faithful to listen to the word of god
[26:32] and to study the word of god you've
[26:34] heard this rehearsed over and over again
[26:36] how they were looking for something else
[26:38] looking for something else looking right
[26:39] over it had different expectations
[26:41] different ideas
[26:42] and god's grace even though they're
[26:44] looking for something totally different
[26:45] he comes and he tries to get their
[26:47] attention
[26:49] with the scriptural signs and wonders to
[26:51] try to catch
[26:53] that that election to have their eyes
[26:54] open to try to catch them
[26:57] he says today this is fulfilled
[27:00] in acts chapter 3 verses 22 to 26
[27:05] and if i could say this to kind of
[27:08] help you to understand what i'm
[27:10] pondering
[27:11] is how that
[27:14] it's this old testament
[27:16] that christ embodies
[27:19] and that's all that they would have had
[27:20] they had the book of isaiah they didn't
[27:21] have second thessalonians right
[27:24] you couldn't deliver you couldn't
[27:25] deliver to christ
[27:27] um the writings of john you couldn't
[27:28] deliver them the writings of paul you
[27:30] couldn't deliver the writings of mark he
[27:31] had to he's delivered the book that had
[27:33] been written the scroll that had been
[27:35] rolled up he's it's being delivered to
[27:37] him so in acts chapter 3 verse 22 for
[27:40] moses truly said unto the fathers
[27:42] mr speaking of jesus christ a prophet
[27:44] shall the lord your god raise up unto
[27:46] you of your brother and like unto me him
[27:48] shall you hear in all things whatsoever
[27:50] he shall say unto you
[27:52] and
[27:52] just the pride verse saying the heavens
[27:54] have received this christ this one that
[27:56] was promised to come so that he he
[27:58] substantiates it takes a step further
[28:00] and substantiates it that the ones that
[28:02] the heavens have received this jesus
[28:03] christ this is the one that moses had
[28:06] said a prophet
[28:08] uh like unto me and it shall come to
[28:11] pass that every soul which will not hear
[28:13] that prophet shall be destroyed from
[28:15] among the people
[28:17] and then he says yea and all the
[28:19] prophets from samuel and those after
[28:21] that
[28:22] as many as have spoken have likewise
[28:25] foretold of these days
[28:27] and he's using
[28:28] using samuel and all that follow after
[28:30] that because samuel is the first one
[28:33] that god uses
[28:35] after the order of the prophets
[28:37] so much that could be said here but he
[28:39] he comes in as the prophet so you have
[28:42] the book of the law
[28:43] then you have the prophets
[28:45] and and all of their writings so it's a
[28:47] way of taking everything
[28:49] prior to christ all the way to malachi
[28:51] says he says all the prophets from
[28:53] samuel those that follow as many as
[28:56] as many as have spoken have likewise
[28:57] foretold of these days
[28:59] what days the days of christ
[29:02] the days of the messiah and he says ye
[29:04] are the children of the prophets now
[29:06] catch the language here because we're
[29:07] coming into covenant and testament
[29:10] you're the children of the prophets and
[29:11] i'll say children of the covenant which
[29:14] god made with our fathers
[29:16] you are children of these prophets
[29:18] children of this old testament children
[29:20] of these writings of the scroll they're
[29:22] called the people of the book
[29:24] it's what they're referred to as and the
[29:26] people the children of the covenant
[29:28] which god made with our fathers saying
[29:29] and abraham in thy seed shall all the
[29:31] kindreds of the earth be blessed
[29:33] now here unto you first god
[29:36] unto you the children of the covenant
[29:38] children of the prophets unto you first
[29:40] god having raised up his son jesus sent
[29:43] him to bless you unto you first god sent
[29:45] him to bless you in turning away every
[29:48] one of you from his iniquities
[29:50] so here were the people of the book the
[29:52] children of the covenant children of the
[29:53] promise so he sends the messiah from
[29:56] them to them so that they would turn
[29:59] from their iniquities in the fulfillment
[30:01] of the covenants
[30:03] so christ is then the climax and the
[30:06] culmination of everything they
[30:08] identified themselves with
[30:11] it through it's even it's evolving
[30:15] as this revelation unfold and the
[30:17] mystery began to be written continued to
[30:19] be written through the prophets it just
[30:21] added to prophecy after prophecy as time
[30:24] went on one prophet said this another
[30:26] prophet said that and it began to build
[30:29] an expectation that one day the kingdom
[30:31] will be restored one day a deliverer
[30:33] will come one day there's going to be a
[30:35] king that will rule in righteousness and
[30:36] all the gentiles will come to their life
[30:38] and they begin to imagine this future
[30:40] they begin to imagine a kingdom they
[30:41] begin to imagine peace around the whole
[30:43] earth and then christ comes he's the one
[30:46] he's the one he's the culmination of it
[30:49] and i read this statement recently and
[30:50] it's such a beautiful statement
[30:53] it says the bible is christ
[30:56] for the old testament leads to that
[30:58] culmination
[31:00] paul and the evangelist stand on the
[31:01] other slope of the holy mountain
[31:04] so notice it's
[31:06] it's this the bible is christ
[31:09] and it's described this way the bible is
[31:11] christ for the old testament leads to
[31:13] that culmination and paul and the
[31:15] prophet stand on the other slope
[31:18] this this is this is this image the
[31:20] bible is christ
[31:22] the old testament lead to that
[31:24] culmination
[31:28] you want to guess who said that
[31:30] i was going to do a actually do a slide
[31:32] and have four choices
[31:34] uh and
[31:35] just neil armstrong vincent van gogh
[31:37] michael jordan or barack obama
[31:40] anybody want to guess of those
[31:42] vincent van gogh said that
[31:45] remarkable statement the bible is christ
[31:48] for the old testament leads to that
[31:50] culmination and i know you're all going
[31:51] to want to run out and buy one of his
[31:53] paintings
[31:56] and we couldn't even save twelve
[31:57] thousand dollars a month rent and be
[32:00] able to get one of those paintings
[32:02] the bible is christ he's the culmination
[32:04] of the old testament
[32:06] paul uses this language and i say this
[32:08] jesus fulfills the covenant of the old
[32:11] testament
[32:12] it's kind of repetitive because
[32:13] testament is covenant they're they're
[32:16] interchangeable and the hebrew and even
[32:18] the greek they're both speaking the same
[32:19] thing even in some translations and some
[32:21] commentators argue where it says
[32:23] testament it would be a better rendered
[32:24] covenant
[32:25] and they're trying to convey the same
[32:27] idea this testament of this covenant
[32:29] it's a contract it's agreement between
[32:32] two parties
[32:33] for there to be a covenant and then even
[32:35] in the testament it speaks
[32:37] in the original of a disposition of
[32:40] something it's the arrangement of any
[32:42] sort i want to arrange things and i wish
[32:44] for it to be valid i want to dispose of
[32:46] things and i wish that it be valid we
[32:48] say a will last will and testament this
[32:50] is my desire so this is what i'm
[32:52] testifying how i want things to be this
[32:55] is how things are going to be arranged
[32:57] and so the testament
[33:00] when paul says you are the children of
[33:01] the prophets and children of the
[33:03] covenant you are children of the
[33:05] testament that god made with our fathers
[33:07] god made an agreement and he gave a
[33:10] testament of how he wanted things to be
[33:12] and this was a promise to you of how he
[33:15] would accomplish things and the way
[33:16] things were going to be god made that
[33:19] covenant and made that promise with
[33:21] israel
[33:22] and so a testament
[33:24] we could say when it comes to uh
[33:26] contracts
[33:28] and to a testament even in the realm of
[33:29] the last will and testament there's a
[33:31] lot of law that is
[33:34] um written and procedures related to
[33:36] those things
[33:37] in order to ensure that what one desires
[33:40] to do after their death will be disposed
[33:42] of and handled just exactly that way and
[33:45] so the best way to do it is to have
[33:48] a will drafted and everything explicitly
[33:52] laid out
[33:53] and then it's signed and it's witnessed
[33:56] and there's even things called the
[33:57] self-proving affidavit that if you write
[34:00] it you sign it you have it notarized and
[34:02] then you have these affidavits of two
[34:03] witnesses who are there in your
[34:05] conscious presence and they also sign it
[34:07] that if it needs to be probated it can
[34:09] be submitted with the affidavits and if
[34:10] you think now this guy knows what he's
[34:12] talking about i've done this uh um and
[34:14] it's it self proves you don't need to do
[34:16] anything else to prove that this was
[34:18] their last will and testament but it has
[34:20] to be in writing
[34:22] and it has to be there has to be a
[34:24] meeting of the minds there has to be
[34:25] some sort of understanding and so god
[34:27] made a promise to their fathers and it
[34:30] was codified it was written it was
[34:32] memorialized in the testament
[34:35] and even in the promise he made to
[34:37] abraham where the real image of this
[34:39] agreement and this division that was
[34:41] made in the vision that he made with
[34:42] abraham in genesis 15 how he was
[34:44] appearing and making himself known
[34:46] abraham knew that this agreement had
[34:48] been made this was a testament this was
[34:50] a promise and then god brings it forth
[34:52] in writing and he confirms his presence
[34:55] and it was called a testament it was
[34:56] called a covenant and and we call it the
[34:59] old
[35:00] right
[35:01] because there's going to be anew
[35:07] now with this kind of coming to this
[35:09] place and we're doing fantastic with our
[35:11] time
[35:14] in the breach between the seven church
[35:16] ages and the seven seals it just dawned
[35:18] on me that if we were paying
[35:19] uh
[35:20] fifteen hundred dollars a day we might
[35:22] have to have longer services just to
[35:23] justify the hourly on that
[35:26] maybe i'm missing an opportunity here
[35:29] but the in the breach between the seven
[35:31] church ages and the seven seals now i
[35:33] want to just do this for the imagery and
[35:35] also what i just connected it to
[35:37] because then we think in revelations
[35:38] chapter five the events that have taken
[35:39] place in this day a seal in the old
[35:41] testament was like a roll roll up a
[35:43] piece of paper like this
[35:45] and here was a mystery and this mystery
[35:47] was hidden all right
[35:48] it was sealed around and put there this
[35:50] claim to so-and-so so now there's a
[35:52] claim there's a disposition there's a uh
[35:55] there is a
[35:57] you know something that's being granted
[35:59] in this estate in these promises then
[36:02] the next mystery was wrapped around of
[36:04] what this inheritance was and stuck out
[36:06] there on this side and then the image of
[36:08] the scroll being rolled up and another
[36:10] one being rolled up so it's turning out
[36:12] toward this this claim to so and so and
[36:14] went on down until it made a scroll
[36:16] because the people didn't have books
[36:17] like this then
[36:19] it was a roll called a scroll
[36:22] well a sealed scroll you could break
[36:24] loose one here what the mystery of this
[36:26] was and tear it loose and you could see
[36:28] what that claim was and then break the
[36:30] other one loose and see what that claim
[36:32] was and so you see there is an unfolding
[36:35] of a breaking of a seal
[36:37] to understand what's rolled up and
[36:39] hidden in that mystery the old testament
[36:42] in type
[36:44] that's what's happening in jesus christ
[36:46] is a seal is being broken and i'm not
[36:49] trying to make this argument that this
[36:50] there's there was the open of the seals
[36:52] and there was any kind of thundering
[36:53] forth and a breaking forth of literal
[36:55] seals in that day but in type and by
[36:57] example when he opened the book in one
[37:00] way in in way of language and symbolism
[37:03] he's on breaking a seal on the book of
[37:06] isaiah
[37:07] he's breaking a seal on the psalms he's
[37:10] breaking a seal on the prophets he's
[37:11] breaking a seal on deuteronomy 18. here
[37:14] he is unfolding the mystery and
[37:16] he's validating the claims this is
[37:19] what's so remarkable is here they were
[37:22] before in their probate here they were
[37:24] in their hearing to determine their
[37:26] inheritance and what they stood to
[37:28] receive and it's being proved up right
[37:31] before them the will the testament the
[37:33] testator is coming and he's going to
[37:35] validate and confirm the testament once
[37:38] and for all and then by his death grant
[37:41] them the inheritance
[37:43] and they miss it
[37:45] my goodness
[37:47] amazing
[37:49] so now
[37:50] let's look at exodus chapter 24.
[37:53] i and i hope this is presenting to you
[37:55] some coherent picture
[37:59] uh and and i and i think that i don't
[38:01] want to try to explain everything and
[38:02] maybe fill in all the
[38:04] uh maybe you just can put bricks out
[38:06] there but kind of let the lord put the
[38:08] mortar and seal in these things
[38:11] and now this is connecting beautifully
[38:13] to me and it and i have to recognize
[38:15] sometimes i may be looking at something
[38:17] and
[38:18] and you'll see it completely differently
[38:20] but but let's just say as long as we're
[38:22] pointing to christ
[38:25] and we're on the mountain
[38:28] we're experiencing him
[38:30] from these different dimensions and we
[38:31] want to do this
[38:32] together and moses came and told the
[38:34] people exodus chapter 24 verses three to
[38:36] eight and i'm wanting you just again to
[38:38] catch the image of all the promises
[38:40] promises all the prophecies
[38:42] all the all the
[38:44] the the word the law that was given to
[38:47] israel it's a covenant it's a testament
[38:48] it's a promise
[38:50] and moses came and told the people all
[38:52] the words of the lord and all the
[38:53] judgments and all the people answered
[38:55] with one voice and said all the words
[38:57] which the lord hath said we will do so
[39:00] all the words of the lord and all the
[39:01] judgments this is this is the book of
[39:04] the law
[39:05] this is what israel rests on all the law
[39:06] and the this is what would be said all
[39:08] the law and the prophets coming
[39:10] from this very point
[39:12] and moses wrote all the words of the
[39:15] lord
[39:16] and rose up early in the morning and
[39:17] builded an altar under the hill and
[39:19] twelve pillars according to the twelve
[39:20] tribes of israel and he sent young men
[39:22] of the children of israel with which
[39:24] offered burnt offerings and sacrificed
[39:25] peace offerings of oxen unto the lord
[39:28] and moses took half of the blood and put
[39:30] it in the basins and half the blood he
[39:32] sprinkled on the altar and he took the
[39:34] book of the covenant
[39:36] and read in the audience
[39:38] of the people
[39:39] so now here is he wrote all the words of
[39:42] the lord so this is just think of the
[39:43] image these are all the words of the
[39:45] lord this is his thundering out to the
[39:47] people this is him speaking to the
[39:49] people he writes it all out he takes the
[39:51] book now and it's called the book of the
[39:52] covenant
[39:53] this is the promise this is a testament
[39:55] this is my agreement with israel and
[39:57] read it in the audience of the people
[39:58] and they said all that the lord has
[40:00] spoken we will do and be obedient
[40:03] and moses took the blood
[40:05] and sprinkled it on the people
[40:08] and notice what he says and said behold
[40:11] the blood of the covenant
[40:12] which the lord hath made with you
[40:14] concerning all these words do you see
[40:17] the picture
[40:18] here is here is all the words of the
[40:21] lord that are written down that are in
[40:23] this book that moses has written
[40:25] and now moses takes the scroll takes the
[40:28] book and to read it he has to open it up
[40:31] and when he reads it and they answer he
[40:33] takes blood
[40:35] and he sprinkles it on the people and
[40:38] now this he says this is behold the
[40:40] blood of this testament the blood of
[40:42] this covenant this book that is now made
[40:45] open to you this is the blood of that
[40:47] which the lord hath made with you
[40:49] concerning all these words and so the
[40:51] blood of the covenant is now on the
[40:54] covenant people and it's a beautiful
[40:56] foreshadowing of what he's going to do
[41:00] the blood of the covenant the sprinkling
[41:02] of the blood upon the people
[41:06] in the presence of an open book
[41:09] hearing the words of the lord
[41:11] what an incredible foreshadowing
[41:16] and in matthew 26
[41:20] 26 to 29
[41:23] it's
[41:24] no
[41:29] i was going to say it's no mystery but i
[41:31] think i'd be kind of arguing against
[41:32] myself
[41:34] it is
[41:36] uh let's say this you'll see the
[41:38] connection to the mystery
[41:40] to them it might have been obvious the
[41:42] language he's using wait a minute
[41:45] he's being very purposeful and
[41:46] deliberate liberate in the way he's
[41:49] saying this
[41:50] and to an israelite they would have
[41:52] thought right back to
[41:53] maybe there's some presumption on my
[41:55] part but i see the direct connection to
[41:57] exodus chapter 24
[41:59] the blood of the covenant
[42:00] right this is what he says right here
[42:02] behold the blood of the covenant
[42:04] and the book of the covenant the blood
[42:06] of the testament the blood of the
[42:07] testaments what it could have been said
[42:08] in exodus 24 so here he is at the last
[42:11] supper and as they were eating jesus
[42:12] took bread and blessed it and break
[42:14] it think of this bread being broken
[42:18] and gave it to the disciples and said
[42:21] take eat this is my body
[42:23] and he took the cup and gave thanks and
[42:25] gave it to them saying
[42:27] drink ye all of it so here's bread being
[42:30] broken
[42:32] this is my body here's blood here's a
[42:34] cup being off he says drink you all for
[42:36] this is my blood of the new testament
[42:39] which is shed for many for the remission
[42:41] of sins
[42:43] you see the imagery
[42:44] you see the the symbolisms do you see
[42:46] the fulfillments i says it he takes
[42:49] bread and breaks it the breaking of his
[42:51] body he's opening this up he says take
[42:54] it and eat it this is the type even of
[42:56] the word being divided the word being
[42:58] broken up he's going to break this open
[43:00] and then he says drink this cup
[43:03] because this is the blood of my new
[43:05] testament
[43:08] this is my blood of the new testament as
[43:10] it's written in exodus 24 behold the
[43:13] blood of the covenant jesus saying
[43:15] behold the blood of the new covenant
[43:19] and it's which is shed for the remission
[43:21] of many the blood of that covenant was
[43:23] sprinkled upon the people
[43:25] when the book which had been written had
[43:27] been read aloud to the people now here
[43:29] he stands and his body is soon going to
[43:32] be broken his blood is going to be
[43:34] poured out and the mercy seat's going to
[43:36] become come in plain view and the veil
[43:39] of the old temple is going to be rent
[43:40] and it's going to expose that the
[43:42] promises
[43:43] have been fulfilled in christ and there
[43:46] is going to hang as a sacrifice and his
[43:48] blood being shed and there's going to be
[43:50] a life that's going to be poured out and
[43:52] once again he's foreshadowing he's
[43:54] fulfilling but he's also foreshadowing
[43:57] this body which is broken in my blood
[44:00] that's going to be poured out you're to
[44:01] be a partaker of it
[44:04] you're to be sprinkled with it
[44:08] according to a promise that god has made
[44:11] with his people
[44:13] so the blood of the new covenant
[44:16] exodus chapter 24 points to christ
[44:19] that's ex this is what is being pointed
[44:22] to this is what in the sacrifice and the
[44:23] offering even in the very language
[44:26] that's being used here's christ now
[44:28] coming as a fulfillment of all things
[44:30] that moses wrote and the prophet spoke
[44:33] of beginning with samuel here he is and
[44:35] he is to be the blood which is shed he
[44:37] is to be the paschal lamb he is to be
[44:39] the sacrifice exodus 24 the blood of
[44:42] that covenant pointed to the blood of
[44:44] jesus christ and now this
[44:47] covenant messenger this
[44:49] christ this messiah
[44:51] points to a new
[44:53] testament
[44:55] a new covenant
[44:57] so there was and again in the
[45:01] uh
[45:02] our
[45:03] language we have a bible which is
[45:05] comprised of an old testament
[45:08] and a new testament so we think of those
[45:10] phrases in terms of the divisions of the
[45:12] book of the bible and they they are
[45:13] beneficial
[45:15] and they're remarkable in just how uh
[45:17] perfectly they align with even
[45:20] the promises of god
[45:21] but
[45:22] instead of just thinking old testament
[45:24] is genesis to malachi new testament
[45:27] is matthew to revelation think of
[45:29] covenant contained in
[45:32] those books
[45:35] has been fulfilled in christ and now
[45:37] christ is saying there's a new covenant
[45:40] and it's and i still want you to
[45:42] maintain the connection but it's not
[45:44] just
[45:45] the way that we've divided the bible
[45:48] there is a new covenant
[45:50] and it's contained in what we call our
[45:52] new testament
[45:55] so christ has introduced if i say a new
[45:57] blood
[45:59] for a new testament
[46:01] for a new people
[46:04] so
[46:05] let's just go back to our text and pick
[46:07] up one scripture
[46:09] to recognize this coming in because this
[46:11] would uh
[46:13] this could be ministered on to such
[46:14] great detail
[46:16] but paul says in second corinthians
[46:17] chapter 3 verse 6 who also hath made us
[46:19] able ministers of the new testament
[46:22] we are able ministers of this new
[46:24] covenant
[46:26] now
[46:27] again bear in mind that he's talking
[46:29] about how
[46:31] the the people are a written epistle
[46:35] that we are
[46:37] the the
[46:39] the manifestation of the epistle of
[46:41] christ
[46:42] and not
[46:44] uh um
[46:45] and he doesn't try to just relate it
[46:47] back to himself like oh well this is me
[46:48] you're living out me you're my words but
[46:50] he says he's made us able ministers of
[46:54] a new of the new testament
[46:57] and then i love just how
[46:59] paul in this inspiration this anointing
[47:01] says not of the letter
[47:04] remember the letter crucified christ
[47:07] the people of the book the people that
[47:08] had the book the people that had the
[47:10] scrolls the people that transcribed the
[47:11] scrolls the people that studied the
[47:12] scrolls the people that preached the
[47:13] scrolls the people that believed in the
[47:15] scrolls are the ones that crucified the
[47:17] manifestation of the scroll
[47:21] so he's saying but of the spirit
[47:25] for the letter killeth
[47:27] but the spirit giveth life
[47:29] there's a spirit of the word there
[47:32] there's a life behind
[47:34] the written prophecy there's a meaning
[47:36] there's an intent there's a desire you
[47:37] look at any work of literature
[47:39] and and they study it they've been doing
[47:41] it for thousands of years trying to get
[47:42] into the mind of the author and when he
[47:44] wrote this uh he's using and he's using
[47:47] imagery and symbolism and foreshadowing
[47:49] and he's trying to do character
[47:50] development and there's something trying
[47:52] to bleed through some some point trying
[47:54] to be made and sometimes they're trying
[47:56] to ascribe meaning to something that has
[47:58] none of those meanings at all and that's
[47:59] what exactly what people have done to
[48:00] the bible but god authored the old
[48:03] testament with the desire with a heart
[48:05] purpose with something he's trying to
[48:06] achieve and so it's not just the letter
[48:08] of it but you've got to have the spirit
[48:10] of it
[48:11] and that was so with the old testament
[48:14] so now paul is cautioning once again as
[48:16] it could be said that there was a old
[48:18] covenant an old testament
[48:20] that god had made with our fathers paul
[48:22] picks it up in hebrews and even in
[48:23] romans that there was a testament there
[48:25] was a covenant that was made here comes
[48:27] christ fulfilling all these promises and
[48:30] yet because they didn't catch the spirit
[48:32] of it they actually used it and referred
[48:35] to it to crucify it
[48:38] they used the written word to crucify
[48:40] the living word
[48:43] our prophet said thou shalt not do this
[48:45] and you've done it therefore we kill you
[48:46] he's saying i am manifesting what that
[48:50] scripture says
[48:52] they'll do the same thing today
[48:55] so then paul is cautioning
[48:57] why because there is a new covenant in
[48:59] christ
[49:01] a new covenant that speaks better things
[49:03] a new covenant that gives hopes that
[49:04] gives expectations as we we read even
[49:07] already today that there's this is a new
[49:09] covenant in his blood there's this new
[49:12] covenant in christ that starts to be
[49:14] emphasized and expressed this is a new
[49:16] testament this is a new covenant this is
[49:18] going to be a new contract
[49:20] these are going to be new promises
[49:23] and there being a new covenant there is
[49:26] a book of the covenant
[49:29] and there's there's a people to be
[49:30] sprinkled
[49:32] with the blood of that covenant
[49:34] oh it's great to have the word written
[49:36] it's great to have it written out it's
[49:38] great to have a prophet speaking
[49:40] rehearsing in all our ears and say oh
[49:42] this will do we'll do all of it we'll
[49:43] obey but you've got to be sprinkled with
[49:45] the blood of it
[49:46] you've got to be covered with the blood
[49:48] of the covenant
[49:50] now second corinthians chapter 3 verses
[49:52] 12 to 15. i know these are just small
[49:53] excerpts from this larger chapter but
[49:56] remember even later on today read it all
[49:58] over again see how these things are so
[50:00] uh beautifully connected together
[50:02] so paul says this
[50:04] and again i think it's a caution to what
[50:06] happened to israel now we have a new
[50:09] testament a new covenant
[50:11] and we see it as even in our bible this
[50:13] holy scripture matthew revelation the
[50:15] new testament being made laid out before
[50:18] us and paul is going to say he's going
[50:20] to bring this comparison and recognize
[50:22] this sin then that we have such hope we
[50:26] use great plainness of speech
[50:28] so we have hope we have expectations
[50:30] just like the jews did under their
[50:31] covenant me we have hope we have
[50:33] expectations under this new testament he
[50:35] says and not as moses which put a veil
[50:37] over his face that the children of
[50:38] israel could not steadfastly look to the
[50:40] end of that which is abolished
[50:42] now he's obviously alluding to this
[50:44] glory of this administration that we
[50:46] have access to we can look at the glory
[50:48] of the old testament we can have that
[50:49] revealed to us he but so now he backs
[50:52] down he says but their minds were
[50:54] blinded
[50:56] for until this day remaineth the same
[51:00] veil
[51:01] which is a covering
[51:03] that which hides a thing
[51:05] to this day remains the same veil
[51:07] untaken away
[51:10] in the reading of the old testament
[51:13] so he's saying that the glory of god
[51:15] shone upon moses and they had to veil
[51:17] his face lest they see the glory of god
[51:20] and he's saying the in that literally
[51:22] happened
[51:23] and he's saying that same veil
[51:26] that hid the glory that was to be
[51:28] revealed in the face of moses the glory
[51:29] of god to the people would have
[51:31] expressed it that same veil exists today
[51:35] still to this day when they read the law
[51:38] of moses when they read the book of
[51:40] moses in the reading of he says the old
[51:43] testament
[51:44] the old covenant the old promises he
[51:46] says the veil still remains
[51:51] so they're reading they're reading
[51:52] they're reading it but it's as if that
[51:54] veil that was put upon moses symbolized
[51:56] that one day there still could be a veil
[52:00] between the people and the glory of god
[52:01] the glory's there
[52:03] but all those masks don't we just hate
[52:05] them
[52:08] covered up the glory
[52:10] of god
[52:13] for unto this day
[52:14] remain at the same veil untaken away in
[52:16] the reading of old testament
[52:18] which veil is done away in christ
[52:22] the veil of the old testament
[52:25] that it where that christ
[52:27] did away with the veil of the old
[52:29] testament
[52:30] the mystery of the old testament the
[52:32] purpose of the old testament that which
[52:33] was going to be fulfilled the old
[52:34] testament it's been done away in christ
[52:38] he says but even unto this day
[52:41] when moses is read the veil is upon
[52:43] their heart
[52:45] even unto this day
[52:47] the old testament
[52:49] it was a new book
[52:51] the old testament was open the scroll
[52:53] had been opened christ is standing there
[52:55] fulfilling it but just as a veil covered
[52:58] the face of moses it's still the same
[53:01] covering untaken away when they read
[53:04] their bible
[53:06] because they have christ has not
[53:07] abolished that veil in their hearts
[53:10] when they read it they still can't see
[53:12] the truth of it
[53:15] that's that's profound
[53:19] the old testament remains sealed to them
[53:22] it's not new to them it's not fresh it's
[53:24] not real
[53:25] the old testament i think we said it
[53:27] this way last week the old testament
[53:28] opened in reality
[53:31] if someone says while that didn't happen
[53:33] it didn't happen
[53:34] i well
[53:36] okay it happened
[53:38] just because you don't see it you don't
[53:39] recognize it you're obstinate so your
[53:41] disbelief doesn't change the truth
[53:45] so it still needed to be opened
[53:47] personally
[53:48] by revelation
[53:52] word of the prophets
[53:54] live in reality of the word
[53:57] then a man a revelation
[53:59] of the manifestation
[54:01] and there's a lot of things that can be
[54:02] preached from the standpoint of
[54:03] manifestation but it still takes a
[54:05] revelation
[54:08] the old covenant he says old testament
[54:10] old covenant had been satisfied in
[54:12] christ whatever veil whatever seal
[54:14] was on the old testament christ did away
[54:16] with it
[54:18] but there still remains a veil hiding
[54:20] him from them
[54:23] in other words the mystery remains
[54:24] despite the revelation
[54:27] right the mystery remains despite the
[54:29] manifestation because
[54:31] i'll say that's why which it just remain
[54:33] there's a mystery remains despite the
[54:35] manifestation because it takes
[54:36] revelation
[54:38] right
[54:40] there's a there's a
[54:42] still a mysterious element that remains
[54:45] despite this manifestation
[54:47] and you can say that that's part of a
[54:49] mystery that a mystery is a something
[54:51] that's divinely revealed but yet a
[54:53] mysterious element remains despite the
[54:54] revelation i think it's maybe a way that
[54:56] brother branham uses it
[54:57] in in a in one logical sense it's
[55:00] because just because it's revealed to
[55:02] you doesn't mean it's revealed to
[55:03] somebody else and just because you see
[55:04] it doesn't mean somebody else can see it
[55:10] now second peter chapter 1 verses 19 to
[55:13] 21
[55:16] or should i stop here let me see
[55:18] i i got i if i if i get into this
[55:22] i want to go a step further
[55:24] and this is what i couldn't get to last
[55:25] sunday so that would be really odd to
[55:27] not get to it today
[55:29] do we owe it to the hilton garden inn
[55:32] to finish this
[55:36] second peter chapter 1 verses 19 to 21
[55:41] now take this as from a jew
[55:45] to that would have had a vernacular that
[55:47] would have described the law and the
[55:49] prophets the book of the prophets the
[55:51] writing of the prophets we have the
[55:52] promises of moses we have the
[55:55] the writings as given to the children of
[55:57] israel but he says we have also a more
[55:59] sure word of prophecy that's quite a
[56:02] statement because they have the prophecy
[56:04] in the book but now he says we have a
[56:06] more sure word of prophecy
[56:08] and that would be like whoa you're
[56:09] saying your book is better than mine but
[56:11] he says
[56:12] where until you do well that you take
[56:13] heed as a delight that shineth in a dark
[56:16] place until the day dawn
[56:18] and the day star rise in your hearts
[56:22] what's what was the more sure word of
[56:24] prophecy
[56:25] in that god fulfilled his word
[56:29] okay think of that that's it's a more
[56:31] sure word of prophecy because they had
[56:33] the prophecy in peter saying christ is
[56:36] the fulfillment of it you have the
[56:38] prophet's quotes
[56:40] we see the living manifested reality of
[56:44] those quotes
[56:45] we have a more sure word of prophecy you
[56:48] have the prophets and their written
[56:50] prophecy but we have a more sure word of
[56:53] prophecy because it's changed from the
[56:55] prophet to the manifested reality of his
[56:57] prophecy
[56:58] he said this is what we have so it's not
[57:01] that it's even something different but
[57:03] it is what it had always been
[57:06] we have the prophets we have the
[57:07] prophets we have what they spoke of that
[57:09] this is them christ was the prophets in
[57:12] flesh
[57:13] is what their utterances were it's what
[57:15] they looked forward to it's what they
[57:17] spoke of it's what they manifested in
[57:18] different various types and certain
[57:20] glimpses he says so we do have today as
[57:23] this voice thundered out on mount
[57:24] transfiguration this is my beloved son
[57:28] hear ye him that's a more sure word of
[57:31] prophecy that's god in his son declaring
[57:34] the truth
[57:37] that's the more sure word of prophecy
[57:38] says you said better take heed to the
[57:39] more sure word of prophecy
[57:41] as unto a light that shineth in a dark
[57:43] place a light shining on a mystery
[57:45] something hidden something not seen
[57:46] until it the light increases and grows
[57:49] until it's a full dawning of the day
[57:52] and the day star comes to full
[57:54] manifestation and brightness in your
[57:56] heart
[57:59] knowing this first
[58:01] that no prophecy of the scripture
[58:03] is of any private interpretation
[58:06] for the prophecy came not an old time by
[58:08] the will of man
[58:09] the holy men of god spake as they were
[58:12] moved by the holy ghost there's your
[58:14] bible
[58:15] written by the breath of god
[58:18] the inspiration of god
[58:20] holy men of god
[58:22] spake as they were moved by the holy
[58:25] ghost the holy ghost given these
[58:27] promises promises i want to say promises
[58:30] to save time promises and prophecies
[58:33] they're moved by the holy ghost to
[58:34] prophesy they're moved by the holy ghost
[58:36] to give promises they're moved to
[58:38] declare and to foreshadow and to speak
[58:40] of think about all the scriptures we
[58:42] read in the volume of the book it is
[58:43] written of me search the scriptures all
[58:46] these the children of the prophets and
[58:48] all these things we've read that speak
[58:50] of they are speaking and foretelling of
[58:53] christ as they were moved by the holy
[58:56] ghost but that prophecy of the scripture
[58:59] that jesus said to search
[59:01] cannot be interpreted privately
[59:05] so what's the more sure word of prophecy
[59:07] prophecy confirmed
[59:10] prophecy fulfilled
[59:13] and then peter says this prophecy
[59:17] is not of any private interpretation
[59:20] it cannot be
[59:22] individually
[59:24] by a man loosed
[59:27] interpretation means loosening and
[59:28] untying
[59:30] so
[59:31] here's prophecy
[59:33] bound up
[59:34] sealed
[59:35] tied up
[59:36] and no prophecy can be privately loosed
[59:41] untied made clear decided or settled or
[59:44] explained so he says no scripture is of
[59:47] any private interpretation why because
[59:49] god moved upon
[59:52] these men when they spake and god will
[59:55] give meaning or lose his scripture by
[59:58] bringing it to pass
[1:00:00] we have a more sure word of prophecy
[1:00:03] here's prophecy in the scripture man
[1:00:05] tries to interpret it but he's saying
[1:00:07] god loosens it itself and he confirms it
[1:00:10] himself by making it a more sure word of
[1:00:13] prophecy so the prophecy made sure
[1:00:17] is the promise of the prophecy in
[1:00:20] manifestation it's the life of it it's
[1:00:22] the power of it
[1:00:26] he says god's the one that's going to
[1:00:27] give meaning and open it or loosen it
[1:00:29] interpret it by bringing it to pass so
[1:00:31] then christ is the more sure word of
[1:00:33] prophecy christ is the interpretation of
[1:00:35] the old testament once christ came peter
[1:00:37] says we have a more sure word of
[1:00:39] prophecy we are no longer waiting for
[1:00:41] this coming messiah we are no longer
[1:00:43] guessing what he will look like it has
[1:00:45] been interpreted by god it has been
[1:00:48] unsealed and has been decided the way is
[1:00:51] over there is no more delay it has been
[1:00:54] manifestly declared
[1:00:58] now the interpretation the meaning the
[1:01:00] understanding is only known
[1:01:02] by
[1:01:04] revelation
[1:01:05] it's only received by faith
[1:01:08] so there's a an adamant we can be
[1:01:11] adamant
[1:01:12] that christ fulfilled these things
[1:01:14] and likewise be adamant that that he
[1:01:17] must be revealed to the person
[1:01:21] brother manna makes this statement and
[1:01:22] lean not to that own understanding
[1:01:26] these are these are words that you'll
[1:01:28] find in other places that speak to this
[1:01:30] concept
[1:01:32] the identification that god
[1:01:34] own interpretation is the manifestation
[1:01:37] of the promise
[1:01:38] god's interpretation is the
[1:01:40] manifestation
[1:01:41] maybe i'll say it make it a little
[1:01:43] plainer when god speaks the word
[1:01:45] he doesn't need any man or any woman or
[1:01:47] no one else to say
[1:01:49] what that means well you say god meant
[1:01:53] this
[1:01:55] god means just what he says he means
[1:01:58] now how does he interpret his own word
[1:02:01] by fulfilling it
[1:02:03] that's why we have to be very careful
[1:02:06] that anything that is spoken
[1:02:08] prophetically
[1:02:10] we don't interpret
[1:02:12] unless god has done so himself
[1:02:17] now he how does he interpret his own
[1:02:18] word by fulfilling it now here's jesus
[1:02:21] and this is what they could have said to
[1:02:22] jesus he's standing there saying
[1:02:24] this day this scripture is fulfilled
[1:02:27] i am the interpretation he's telling
[1:02:28] them god is interpreting his promised
[1:02:31] word to you today
[1:02:34] and they could have rejected it
[1:02:36] why they say oh no man can do that no
[1:02:37] one can do that nobody can do that well
[1:02:42] he did it
[1:02:43] and he was it
[1:02:44] he's pointing them to it and paul did
[1:02:46] the same thing did not the word of god
[1:02:47] say did not the word of god say so it's
[1:02:49] after the interpretation then you point
[1:02:52] to it you speak of it you declare it you
[1:02:54] speak you lift it up
[1:02:56] the bible said a virgin shall shall
[1:02:57] conceive she did
[1:03:00] men of that day could have taken the
[1:03:01] original uh these brother aaron speaking
[1:03:04] now uh to those who are getting this on
[1:03:06] the podcast
[1:03:07] uh there's a
[1:03:08] it could have taken that word and said
[1:03:10] oh a young woman a young maiden shall
[1:03:12] conceive
[1:03:14] and it's translated to virgin they could
[1:03:16] they could have twisted up any other way
[1:03:17] and could have come up with some other
[1:03:19] interpretation he says she did
[1:03:22] she became the interpretation of that
[1:03:23] scripture that don't need any
[1:03:25] interpretation
[1:03:26] why because it's happened
[1:03:29] god said let there be light and there
[1:03:30] was that don't need any interpretation
[1:03:33] why because it happened
[1:03:35] god said also that in these last days he
[1:03:38] would pour out his spirit upon all flesh
[1:03:40] and he's done it that don't need any
[1:03:42] interpretation that only needs an ex
[1:03:44] exception
[1:03:46] accepting right
[1:03:48] somebody needs somebody to accept what
[1:03:50] god has done there's the principle that
[1:03:52] god prophesies it then once he's
[1:03:54] interpreted it you have to accept it
[1:03:58] not wrestle with the interpretation he
[1:04:00] says god interprets his own word god
[1:04:03] promised the things that we say see day
[1:04:06] by day that he would do in this last day
[1:04:09] that's the interpretation of the word of
[1:04:11] god we just need to accept it
[1:04:17] praise the lord
[1:04:19] if you include my announcement i'm over
[1:04:21] an hour but i began
[1:04:24] i'm not quite an hour
[1:04:26] uh in terms of the the content of my
[1:04:29] sermon
[1:04:30] so i feel very good
[1:04:31] to continue with my last couple
[1:04:33] scriptures here
[1:04:34] and we're just going to wrap it up
[1:04:36] with these scriptures in a statement
[1:04:38] from the message so you can see now
[1:04:41] this parallel
[1:04:43] romans chapter nine verses four to five
[1:04:46] who are israelites this is paul's
[1:04:48] brethren that he's
[1:04:49] longing for and desirous of that they
[1:04:51] would see the truth he says who are
[1:04:53] israelites to whom pertaineth the
[1:04:55] adoption and the glory and the covenants
[1:04:58] and the giving of the law and of the
[1:05:00] service of god and the promises
[1:05:03] what is this old testament
[1:05:06] whose are the fathers
[1:05:08] and of whom as concerning the flesh
[1:05:11] christ came
[1:05:13] who is over all god
[1:05:16] blessed forever amen
[1:05:19] the israelites to them it pertained the
[1:05:21] adoption the glory the covenants the law
[1:05:23] the service of god the promises and so
[1:05:26] according to concerning the flesh christ
[1:05:29] came to them
[1:05:32] who did he come to the ones to whom the
[1:05:34] promises were given christ came to the
[1:05:36] jews christ came to the people of the
[1:05:39] book those who get the law was given to
[1:05:42] the covenants were given to the service
[1:05:43] of god was given to the promises were
[1:05:45] given to
[1:05:47] even in the language of the old
[1:05:48] testament christ is the messenger of the
[1:05:51] covenant
[1:05:52] god made a promise god appeared to
[1:05:54] abraham god made a promise confirmed the
[1:05:55] covenant over and over and over again he
[1:05:57] confirms the covenant but now the
[1:05:59] messenger christ comes to the people god
[1:06:03] in the flesh of his son jesus he comes
[1:06:05] as the messiah he is the messenger of
[1:06:07] the covenant but now he has come not
[1:06:09] just to give the promise but he's come
[1:06:12] confirming he's come according to the
[1:06:16] promise in a confirmation or in a more
[1:06:20] sure word of prophecy as the fulfillment
[1:06:22] see i said i would do it now i've done
[1:06:25] it
[1:06:26] it's if i can say it this way i think
[1:06:29] there's maybe a a way that we look at
[1:06:31] and say confirm the promise and it's
[1:06:33] just like
[1:06:34] you we just repeat it remember what did
[1:06:36] you promise me you would do what did you
[1:06:37] promise me you would do it so i promised
[1:06:39] i'd give you a thousand dollars okay i
[1:06:40] just wanted to be sure that's what your
[1:06:42] promise was
[1:06:43] and and and we could just affirm over
[1:06:45] and over again that i made the promise
[1:06:47] but a confirmation is when it's
[1:06:48] fulfilled
[1:06:51] and this sense the more sure word of
[1:06:52] prophecy
[1:06:54] so then
[1:06:56] in romans chapter 15 verse 8
[1:06:59] i'm not speaking that presumptuously i'm
[1:07:00] trying to use a very scriptural language
[1:07:03] now i say that jesus christ
[1:07:06] was a minister of the circumcision for
[1:07:08] the truth of god
[1:07:10] to confirm the promises made unto the
[1:07:13] fathers
[1:07:16] what is what does the bible tell us
[1:07:17] christ came
[1:07:18] to confirm the old testament
[1:07:22] christ made sure the prophecy
[1:07:25] he forever consecrated a new and living
[1:07:28] way
[1:07:29] whatever promises god made to the person
[1:07:32] and to the individual to the releasing
[1:07:34] of the people from their iniquities to
[1:07:35] the giving them of a new heart to all
[1:07:37] these things that are prophesied in the
[1:07:39] old testament christ confirmed these
[1:07:42] promises are valid and he opened up a
[1:07:45] way now for the person to inherit and to
[1:07:48] receive all the promises
[1:07:51] pertaining to these things
[1:07:53] it says the glory the covenants the
[1:07:55] given the law the service of god the
[1:07:56] promises even the adoption
[1:07:58] these things are now
[1:08:01] available through christ
[1:08:03] and if i can say this as a closed did
[1:08:05] not the new testament promise again
[1:08:07] make promises again are there not
[1:08:10] promises made by christ in the new
[1:08:13] covenant in the new testament
[1:08:16] that he's made to us
[1:08:18] ones that give us expectation and hope
[1:08:21] ones that we long
[1:08:22] to see fulfilled
[1:08:24] and so he promised he would do it again
[1:08:27] even the bible promises another
[1:08:29] messenger of the covenant
[1:08:31] and it's promised musicians if he come
[1:08:33] it's promised in the end
[1:08:37] he's promised
[1:08:38] he would confirm
[1:08:40] his promises
[1:08:41] at the culmination of the new testament
[1:08:45] christ came at the culmination of the
[1:08:46] old testament and confirmed the promises
[1:08:48] he's promised to do the same thing
[1:08:51] to the new covenant
[1:08:56] and the message the masterpiece stand on
[1:08:58] your feet with me
[1:09:00] as we read this last statement together
[1:09:03] looking at these and just pondering
[1:09:04] these words i want to read it to you
[1:09:06] he fulfilled the old testament
[1:09:10] now
[1:09:11] it's the new testament
[1:09:13] another piece to be fulfilled
[1:09:15] see the new and the old is husband and
[1:09:17] wife
[1:09:18] and it taken the old to for show the new
[1:09:22] and so you had the old
[1:09:24] and it took the old now to foreshadow
[1:09:27] the new
[1:09:28] christ is even himself foreshadowing the
[1:09:31] new christ comes fulfilling the old now
[1:09:34] in christ he foreshadows the new
[1:09:38] it it's old
[1:09:40] it's it the the language oldest the
[1:09:43] prior the previous covenant
[1:09:45] it's because another one now is in a
[1:09:47] four in a force now another one's to be
[1:09:48] fulfilled now another one it's like a
[1:09:51] clause has been fulfilled and it led
[1:09:52] into another clause because you could go
[1:09:54] back in the word of god and see that
[1:09:55] there's these layers this prophecy to
[1:09:57] israel but this mystery
[1:09:59] right
[1:10:00] another layer
[1:10:02] in the prophecy that christ
[1:10:05] opens up
[1:10:07] and and this promise leads into another
[1:10:08] promise in the unfolding of the scroll
[1:10:10] the old testament came to this but now
[1:10:12] there's still a new testament
[1:10:14] unfolds
[1:10:16] if i could use this language just by way
[1:10:17] of example
[1:10:19] when
[1:10:21] world war one transpired
[1:10:23] they never called it world war one
[1:10:26] they called it the great war
[1:10:29] uh it's not until you had another great
[1:10:32] war
[1:10:33] that they began to call the prior one
[1:10:35] world war one and you had world war ii
[1:10:38] and so
[1:10:40] in the same way you would say covenant
[1:10:42] covenant testament testament testament
[1:10:44] but then once there was another one
[1:10:46] there had to be a way well the old
[1:10:47] promise has been fulfilled but there's
[1:10:49] now a new one
[1:10:51] and so this is my i want you to
[1:10:52] recognize christ fulfilled the old
[1:10:55] but he's living
[1:10:56] he's alive
[1:10:58] ever present
[1:10:59] ever living
[1:11:02] as a mediator of the new
[1:11:04] testament
[1:11:05] of a new covenant and he says the old
[1:11:07] and the new are husband and wife
[1:11:10] so the bridegroom is manifested in the
[1:11:12] old testament
[1:11:14] the bride and the new
[1:11:15] took the old to foreshadow the new
[1:11:17] christ come the masterpiece to fulfill
[1:11:19] that now his bride will fulfill
[1:11:22] everything that's in the new testament
[1:11:24] another masterpiece is in making
[1:11:28] behold masterpieces
[1:11:31] behold a masterpiece behold this is what
[1:11:34] our church is in service to
[1:11:36] not that we as a local church and a
[1:11:38] local government are a masterpiece but
[1:11:40] we have committed ourselves to serving
[1:11:43] the masterpiece that is in the making
[1:11:47] there's another open of the book there's
[1:11:49] another breaking of the word there's
[1:11:51] another ushering forth of life because
[1:11:54] life is in the blood there's another
[1:11:56] book of the covenant and there's another
[1:11:58] life that's actually ushering forth from
[1:12:00] it that's where we're living now if i
[1:12:02] could say i don't think i've hid it
[1:12:03] really very well if the i am is an open
[1:12:06] book can we not come to say today in the
[1:12:09] same way i am an open book
[1:12:14] i am the word of this new testament a
[1:12:17] living reality
[1:12:19] i am salvation expressed i i am
[1:12:22] happiness in the fruits of the spirit
[1:12:23] expressed i am his word of god made
[1:12:25] flesh today
[1:12:28] why because there's been another opening
[1:12:31] another breaking
[1:12:33] another ushering forth of life
[1:12:36] god bless you today
[1:12:40] amen
[1:12:42] so grateful to god for his word
[1:12:48] i'm so grateful to be able to
[1:12:52] look into these things and see these
[1:12:53] great truths
[1:12:55] i ask you today
[1:12:57] do you see these things
[1:13:00] is there something does your heart burn
[1:13:02] within you
[1:13:04] do you know that he's been made known to
[1:13:06] you in the breaking of the bread
[1:13:08] is this a living reality to you
[1:13:11] and i would say to those who
[1:13:14] who sense well i don't know it's a maybe
[1:13:17] it's an odd language or that maybe
[1:13:19] that's running counter to my
[1:13:21] my typical thought process however we
[1:13:22] might begin to think about it
[1:13:26] i would say ask god
[1:13:29] if there's something bernie if a burning
[1:13:31] heart remember if you have the heartburn
[1:13:34] then ask him to make himself known to
[1:13:35] you
[1:13:37] because that's good that's what relieved
[1:13:39] their heartburn that's the connection
[1:13:41] they said did not our hearts burn within
[1:13:42] us it's what gave them that satisfaction
[1:13:44] go oh that's why
[1:13:46] my heart was burning within me he was
[1:13:48] made known to me
[1:13:50] and i believe that god is wanting to
[1:13:52] make himself known to you
[1:13:54] if you're lost he's wanting to make
[1:13:56] himself known to you as a savior
[1:13:58] and the forgiveness of sins
[1:14:01] he wants to take you and fill you with
[1:14:04] the holy ghost
[1:14:05] this is this is what he is desiring to
[1:14:08] do this is what he's wanting to do this
[1:14:10] is what we can say i i could say in my
[1:14:13] heart today if anything seems
[1:14:15] somewhat dark if something seems
[1:14:18] mysterious then ask him to make himself
[1:14:21] known to you
[1:14:24] let's pray our gracious heavenly father
[1:14:26] as we have stood together
[1:14:29] today it was a unified action
[1:14:32] and i
[1:14:34] would that this would be
[1:14:37] uh symbolic
[1:14:39] of us rising to the task
[1:14:42] of fulfilling your promised word
[1:14:45] it's remarkable statements lord that are
[1:14:47] made that christ is the culmination of
[1:14:49] the old testament that christ
[1:14:51] is the fulfillment of everything in the
[1:14:53] old testament it's a remarkable
[1:14:54] statement lord then we are the
[1:14:56] fulfillment of everything in the new
[1:14:58] testament
[1:15:01] oh
[1:15:05] we might ask ourselves am i up to the
[1:15:07] task
[1:15:10] can i do this
[1:15:13] you might not even understand what it
[1:15:14] means
[1:15:16] i pray oh god that you could give us
[1:15:18] such simple minds
[1:15:22] to understand what it means
[1:15:25] so many people want it to be some sort
[1:15:27] of global juggernaut that the whole
[1:15:29] world just has to whimper and fear of
[1:15:32] this
[1:15:33] powerhouse
[1:15:36] but in your first coming they were so
[1:15:38] bold to crucify you
[1:15:42] the lord may we realize that the
[1:15:44] manifestation of the word of god in this
[1:15:46] hour will be in humility
[1:15:49] it is
[1:15:50] not
[1:15:52] a
[1:15:54] public show
[1:15:56] that entertains the world
[1:16:00] but is an absolute definite
[1:16:02] transformation of the inner man
[1:16:08] that
[1:16:09] imposes itself
[1:16:12] on the outer men's thought process
[1:16:14] and the outer man's activities
[1:16:17] and i pray lord that we could begin to
[1:16:19] walk more plainly in the peace that this
[1:16:21] word of god gives and walk more plainly
[1:16:24] and the sensitivity to the spirit that
[1:16:26] this word of god
[1:16:28] brings and raises up within us
[1:16:31] and may we fulfill your word of god for
[1:16:34] our lives commit the people to you now
[1:16:36] have your way
[1:16:38] take control
[1:16:40] bless us now
[1:16:42] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:16:44] amen
