[0:00] continuing on the subject of our family
[0:01] tree
[0:02] today's title is under the sycamore
[0:05] shade
[0:06] under the sycamore shade kind of our
[0:08] goal in these services i believe this is
[0:10] the sixth part
[0:12] uh is really establishing our
[0:14] expectations for church for this church
[0:16] in particular looking at this church as
[0:18] being a family tree
[0:20] something that we gather around
[0:22] something that we feel like we're family
[0:24] and we enjoy all the benefits that come
[0:26] with being family and then there's this
[0:28] extension also to how we ought to
[0:30] operate our own families so there's a
[0:31] lot of applicability on a number of
[0:33] levels and
[0:35] uh it may come back to this emphasis
[0:37] here in the
[0:38] in the beginning but i'm i'm wanting to
[0:40] lay the right kind of foundation for
[0:42] this church is still young not quite two
[0:44] years old yet
[0:46] it's been growing and so there's still
[0:47] new members being added all the time and
[0:49] i'm trusting that god will do that by
[0:52] conversions and by souls being saved and
[0:55] so kind of wanting to revisit the
[0:56] foundation and if i could put it this
[0:58] way enter certain things into the record
[1:01] of our church history so that if any
[1:04] time even i as a pastor begin to wonder
[1:06] you could say you remember when you
[1:07] preached our family tree and you said
[1:10] this is the way it should be done and
[1:12] you can remind me and hopefully i'd be
[1:14] the type of person who could say oh
[1:15] you're right how did i begin to vary
[1:17] from that and so i like being able to
[1:19] enter things into the record that i can
[1:21] be held accountable to because i am
[1:24] willing to be accountable i voluntarily
[1:26] and willingly hold myself accountable to
[1:28] you and so these things are part of
[1:30] building the right kind of foundation so
[1:32] if you ask what's the reason for going
[1:34] into these things and even saying some
[1:35] of the things that i will about church
[1:37] and about our approach to church you
[1:39] might think maybe i'm preaching beyond
[1:40] you but i'm not it's just right here
[1:42] within these walls i'm ministering to
[1:44] you
[1:45] now in genesis chapter 21 verse 33 this
[1:48] has been
[1:49] the inspiration for this series it says
[1:52] and abraham planted a grove in beersheba
[1:55] and called there in the grove on the
[1:58] name of the lord the everlasting god
[2:00] grove there is translated a tamarisk in
[2:02] some places or abraham planted a tree
[2:05] the grove started with the tree we're
[2:07] calling it a family tree and it's very
[2:09] rich in symbolism and application and
[2:11] we've done that through a few services
[2:13] and i want to continue to take the
[2:14] thought of a tree and and use its
[2:16] symbolism and application
[2:18] this tamrix of fila we looked at it how
[2:21] it was the nature of this particular
[2:23] tree that abraham planted uh was
[2:25] symbolic of the grove that then began to
[2:28] develop around uh what abraham
[2:31] around
[2:32] abraham's planting and what his vision
[2:34] was and planting it it wasn't just a
[2:36] arbor day so he just planted a tree he
[2:38] wasn't trying to meet a quota to get
[2:40] some carbon credits but he had a vision
[2:42] in doing it and this tree is long-lived
[2:45] has deep roots and so to draw water from
[2:48] arid regions and it provides a lot of
[2:50] shade
[2:51] it's adapted for desert conditions it's
[2:54] uh
[2:55] of its structure it's used as a break
[2:57] from the wind shade from the sun
[2:59] and so there's a lot of uses we talked
[3:01] about how it secretes salt during the
[3:03] day and as it secretes salt it dries up
[3:05] and then at night
[3:07] that water or it begins to it absorbs
[3:09] water and then as it evaporates it cools
[3:11] the air under the trees so it's like it
[3:13] had natural air conditioning it was a
[3:15] place to put a tent it was a place to
[3:17] fellowship it was a place to gather and
[3:19] we saw a lot of those examples in the
[3:20] scripture and these things happened
[3:22] because the nature and character of the
[3:24] tree
[3:25] i've even been pondering how god when he
[3:27] created all things and put the seeds in
[3:30] the earth he knew what those seeds would
[3:32] become and how they would be used
[3:34] do you even think the very elements of
[3:36] iron and ore were put into the earth the
[3:38] very seedlings of trees were put into
[3:40] the earth and god knew one day that man
[3:42] would take that iron and fashion nails
[3:45] to to nail his son to a cross from the
[3:48] trees that the seeds that were planted
[3:50] in genesis 1 and so god had a vision to
[3:53] these things we'd be looking at the
[3:54] characteristics of trees
[3:56] and in abraham planting a grove it's the
[3:59] a shell who by means of the grove by
[4:02] means of these trees or this tree god
[4:04] invoked
[4:06] abraham invoked invoked the name of god
[4:08] by the hospitality of the grove by the
[4:11] ministry of the grove god became known
[4:14] and we use that as an application for
[4:16] this church and for our own families
[4:18] now
[4:19] i want to reference this very quick and
[4:21] it kind of it may give you some
[4:22] indication of some other sermons that
[4:24] we've been preparing for
[4:26] to perhaps minister on i have no
[4:28] particular um personal agenda in terms
[4:31] of getting through so many parts or
[4:33] touching on different subjects just as
[4:35] long as god would lead these are some of
[4:36] the you might catch on some
[4:38] similarities here but there's different
[4:40] trees in the bible that stand out and we
[4:43] may begin to think about a lot of
[4:44] different ones that stand out to us
[4:47] and they
[4:48] they stand out because of their use
[4:52] let's just write it out we
[4:54] we've surmised that it eventually goes
[4:55] away
[4:57] so
[4:58] we can just see how long
[5:00] how long it lasts and we time it take
[5:03] notes because we want to know does this
[5:04] happen at a particular time
[5:06] is it a sunburst is it somebody's cell
[5:08] phone that's on 6g
[5:10] um you know what's what's happening
[5:14] it's not bothering me is it bothering
[5:16] you guys i know it'd be annoying if we
[5:17] did this for two hours
[5:20] but
[5:22] thank you brother
[5:24] if i need to grab a mic i can i can
[5:26] preach with one hand
[5:36] i feel more preacherous doing this
[5:38] anyway so
[5:39] this might help me to really get a get
[5:41] into the anointing today
[5:43] so we're acknowledging that there's
[5:45] different trees um in the bible and you
[5:47] may be able to think about different
[5:48] trees
[5:49] uh that that come to your mind when you
[5:52] think about uh just the actual tree and
[5:54] what it might mean there's different uh
[5:56] trees that stand out because of the way
[5:57] that they were used in the bible or
[5:59] their symbolism and just to run through
[6:02] a list i jotted down a few yesterday we
[6:04] think of the gopher tree as it was used
[6:06] to build the ark the juniper tree where
[6:08] elijah sat underneath it the fig tree
[6:11] comes up a lot in the old testament new
[6:12] testament it's a a symbol of israel then
[6:16] even the olive tree and its symbolism in
[6:18] scripture and in particular with noah as
[6:21] a sign than the cedar tree and how it
[6:23] was used to build the tabernacle and
[6:24] different elements of the tabernacle and
[6:27] we see these different trees are used in
[6:29] different parables they have different
[6:31] types and different symbolisms and so i
[6:33] wanted to focus on one particular tree
[6:35] today and that's the sycamore tree and
[6:38] again my title is under the sycamore
[6:40] shade
[6:41] and there's really interesting things
[6:44] that i've been diving into about the
[6:45] sycamore tree but this is this is my
[6:48] thesis on under the sycamore shade i'm
[6:51] talking about our church by extension
[6:53] could even think about the the way that
[6:55] we're running our families
[6:57] but church is a place
[6:59] to hear god and to see god
[7:02] it's a place to meet him
[7:05] and but it can also be a place that
[7:07] keeps us from him
[7:09] and so i'm wanting to use this
[7:11] image of under the sycamore shade
[7:14] and and and i'm just going to jump into
[7:16] the subject matter i'm going to start in
[7:17] luke chapter 19 it's going to jump into
[7:19] the subject matter and i want you to
[7:20] follow me because i'm just going to lay
[7:22] a lot of things out there a lot of
[7:23] pieces to the puzzle i'm going to get
[7:24] i'm going to flip them over we're going
[7:26] to get the border going i'm going to
[7:27] start
[7:28] putting things into categories but what
[7:29] i want you to be able to do once it
[7:31] starts coming together i want you to be
[7:33] able to grab some of those pieces and
[7:34] put them into place yourself but dale
[7:36] we'll have fun today right we're going
[7:37] to put this puzzle together
[7:39] and and i enjoy putting together puzzles
[7:41] and so what we're going to be doing
[7:42] today is not trying to puzzle you put a
[7:44] lot of pieces out on the table stick
[7:46] with me and follow me remember the
[7:48] purpose of this
[7:49] sermon today is to lay the right kind of
[7:52] foundation and then as i speak in a
[7:54] general sense what i encourage you to do
[7:56] is make application for yourself if i
[7:59] don't take the next step and make it
[8:00] applicable that's that's on your part to
[8:03] do that and i forgot to welcome the
[8:05] mcgeary's back not these mcgeary's but
[8:07] the other miguri's brother judas good to
[8:08] have you back i kept telling myself
[8:11] welcome back welcome back welcome back
[8:12] from bulgaria and and sister damaris was
[8:15] in canada god bless you and your family
[8:16] it's good to have you back looking
[8:18] forward to hearing about what the lord
[8:19] did
[8:20] and while you were there in europe we
[8:21] were all praying for you
[8:23] so now luke chapter 19 verse 4
[8:26] and this is speaking of zacchaeus and it
[8:28] says and he ran before
[8:30] and climbed up into a sycamore tree to
[8:33] see him for he was to pass that way this
[8:36] sycamore tree is what we're going to
[8:38] focus on begin to develop some of its
[8:40] characteristics these will be some of
[8:41] the pieces to the puzzle that maybe you
[8:43] can put in later it's a sycamine or a
[8:45] sycamore as it's called here in the
[8:47] scripture and it comes from
[8:50] sikhi which is means fig and then mora
[8:54] which is mulberry so it's a combination
[8:56] of fig and mulberry it's a mulberry fig
[8:58] tree it's a sycamore fig in the new
[9:00] testament ficus sycamores or often
[9:03] called the fig mulberry or sycamore fig
[9:05] so that's the tree if you want to look
[9:07] it up it may not be like the sycamores
[9:08] we see here in north america but it's a
[9:11] fig mulberry or a sycamore fig it's a
[9:13] very unique tree
[9:15] in emma's chapter 7 verse 14 it says
[9:18] then answered amos and said to amaziah i
[9:20] was no prophet neither was i a prophet
[9:22] son but i was a herdman
[9:25] and a gatherer of sycamore fruit
[9:28] and so it says a gather sycamore fruit i
[9:30] don't have a slide there of the
[9:33] of the trees it may be a little bit
[9:35] difficult to see this but the one there
[9:37] on your left the large panel that's a
[9:39] sycamore tree and then
[9:41] those two other pictures show the
[9:43] branches of a sycamore tree and the
[9:46] fruit goes directly from the trunk and
[9:48] it's little sprigs that come in like
[9:50] little clusters of grapes um on the
[9:52] actual branch itself and so when it says
[9:54] i when amos says i was a gatherer of
[9:56] sycamore fruit he was a dresser or
[9:59] cultivator of these sycamore figs
[10:02] and in the harvesting or the use of the
[10:05] sycamore fig it has to be punctured
[10:07] at a specific point before you harvest
[10:09] it or before you pluck it in order for
[10:11] it to be edible
[10:13] so one thing that he would do is a
[10:14] cultivator or a dresser of sycamore figs
[10:17] as he would go and he would puncture
[10:18] them and cut them open so many days
[10:20] before he'd want to eat them because it
[10:22] was necessary to dress them or cultivate
[10:24] them in order for them to be edible to
[10:26] the one who was wanting to eat them so
[10:28] he was a gatherer of sycamore fruit this
[10:30] is what it looks like and we could keep
[10:32] that up there for you to ponder it for
[10:33] just a moment and in first kings chapter
[10:35] 10 verse 27 and the king made silver to
[10:38] be in jerusalem as stones
[10:41] think about that
[10:42] and cedars made he to be as the sycamore
[10:45] trees that are in the veil for abundance
[10:48] and so this kind of gives you an idea of
[10:49] how uh common the sycamore tree was that
[10:52] he make the king made silver to be a
[10:54] stones so this is how rich the kingdom
[10:56] is getting and cedars to be just as
[10:58] common and in abundance as sycamore
[11:00] trees that are in the veil in the low
[11:02] lands in this low-lying area
[11:05] and the sycamores
[11:07] and they grew in abundance in the
[11:08] lowland that's what the scriptures tell
[11:09] us and it's telling us about how
[11:11] important this tree was and how it was
[11:13] common and it was always green
[11:16] and it bore this fruit many times a year
[11:19] several times a year wasn't just one
[11:20] time a year but it would have this fruit
[11:22] many times a year so it was kind of a
[11:24] useful a useful tree and in a lot of
[11:26] ways it was associated with common
[11:28] people and the poor people
[11:30] because it was
[11:31] readily available and it fruited many
[11:34] times of the year
[11:35] and it says in first chronicles chapter
[11:37] 27 verse 28 and over the olive trees and
[11:40] the sycamore trees that are in the low
[11:42] plains was behnan the gatorite and so it
[11:46] must have been a pretty significant
[11:48] resource if you're going to have an
[11:49] overseer over it right you would you
[11:51] don't ask anybody to watch a
[11:53] scrub brush or anything like that
[11:56] but here it is an overseer placed over
[11:59] olive trees and sycamore trees so it's a
[12:01] significant resource this is one who is
[12:04] responsible for the cultivating it over
[12:05] the keeping of it and it's associated
[12:08] with sycamore trees and in a lot of ways
[12:10] the trunk of the sycamore tree is like
[12:12] an olive tree
[12:14] and i found even where brother branham
[12:16] speaking about luke chapter 19 says it
[12:18] was actually it was an olive tree that
[12:20] zacchaeus climbed i thought that was
[12:22] interesting but in this region in israel
[12:25] middle east the sycamore tree was
[12:27] widespread it was used very extensively
[12:29] and it became very important
[12:31] this scripture in psalm 7847 it kind of
[12:34] speaks to how important this tree was
[12:36] he's speaking about egypt he destroyed
[12:38] their vines with hail and their sycamore
[12:40] trees with frost
[12:42] so for to be one of uh the catastrophes
[12:44] of egypt then it meant it must have been
[12:46] a vital resource to say that the the um
[12:50] the the vines are destroyed with hell
[12:52] and the sycamore trees are destroyed
[12:53] with frost it speaks to just how
[12:55] important this resource was or how
[12:58] significant this tree was
[13:00] in isaiah chapter 9 verse 10 it says the
[13:02] bricks are falling down but we build
[13:05] with hume stones the sycamores are cut
[13:08] down but we will change them into cedars
[13:11] speaking about when the assyrians uh
[13:13] besieged the the city and they had cut
[13:16] down all this all the sycamore trees
[13:18] during the siege and so it grew in the
[13:20] fields and around the city it was a
[13:22] common tree and it was used to build
[13:25] i was readily available but it wasn't
[13:26] necessarily the best wood to build with
[13:28] it was um not ideal because it wasn't
[13:30] durable it really wasn't a tree you'd
[13:32] use to build but if it was for the poor
[13:34] and common people you used what you had
[13:37] and so it says here that the sycamores
[13:39] are cut down but will use cedars to
[13:41] build so the cedar is strong and
[13:43] long-lasting and beautiful
[13:46] but they're sycamore tree
[13:48] was very common
[13:50] and it had a strong widespread branches
[13:53] uh underneath it many lateral branches
[13:56] that are easy to climb
[13:58] and so when it says in luke chapter 19
[13:59] verse four and speaking of zacchaeus and
[14:02] he ran before
[14:03] and climbed up into a sycamore tree to
[14:05] see him
[14:06] and this is one that's actually in
[14:08] africa
[14:10] but this is just how big and wide these
[14:13] trees can get
[14:14] and so this is a thought and i'm kind of
[14:17] what i'm saying here i'm going to come
[14:18] right back to in the end or whenever
[14:20] this battery goes out
[14:22] uh but there's i'm going to come back to
[14:24] it and this is one of these pieces to
[14:26] the puzzle i want you to hold and kind
[14:27] of put in that category like this is
[14:29] unique it's going to have a place to fit
[14:31] but zacchaeus we know he climbed up into
[14:34] this tree to see christ
[14:38] but you look at this tree and you see it
[14:40] not only was it a place where he could
[14:41] see christ but it was also a place he
[14:43] could hide
[14:45] and so i want you to ponder the meaning
[14:47] of the sycamore we kind of just took a
[14:49] moment to lay some foundation of this
[14:51] the rich symbolism of the sycamore it's
[14:53] placed in the scripture
[14:55] and it's
[14:56] these trees and its branches
[14:58] it's at the intersection of the sycamore
[15:01] branches
[15:03] brother branham says here two ways meet
[15:05] yours in god
[15:08] he says that's a good place to set where
[15:10] two ways meet looking at these branches
[15:12] you can see again in these in the
[15:14] sycamore there uh to your left just how
[15:17] the branches would be and maybe some of
[15:19] us look and said now that would be a
[15:20] great place to climb it'd be a good a
[15:22] good perch to be in and so brother i'm
[15:25] looking at those branches and using
[15:26] these the way these things intertwine
[15:28] and intersect and a good place to sit
[15:30] would be where two branches meet
[15:33] he says it's a
[15:34] to where it's a place where you meet
[15:36] with god you and god and he said that's
[15:38] a good place to set where two ways meet
[15:41] that your ideas and that's your ideas
[15:44] and god's word
[15:45] a lot of times that's what happens when
[15:47] we come to church we come with our ideas
[15:48] and the word of god meets them and
[15:50] that's a good place to ponder for a
[15:51] little while he says where your ideas
[15:53] and his meat that's a good place to rest
[15:56] just for a few minutes
[15:58] so notice how he's characterizing this
[16:00] place in the sycamore tree so that's
[16:02] where two two ideas meet your ways in
[16:04] god's way his thoughts and your thoughts
[16:06] and we think oh battlefield or or this
[16:09] is a this is a
[16:11] demolition derby or this is a head-on
[16:12] collision it's not
[16:14] it should never be viewed that way as a
[16:16] son or daughter of god then i'm going to
[16:18] meet god head on and we're going to
[16:19] clash on the battlefield my ideas and
[16:21] his ideas no you meet on the uh and the
[16:23] crux and the branch of a sycamore tree
[16:25] and you ponder a little while and you
[16:27] think about it
[16:28] out of my ways compared to his ways
[16:30] lord let my thoughts be your thoughts he
[16:32] says it's a good place to rest
[16:35] and so these wide spread branches you
[16:37] could see them were used for creating
[16:38] shade
[16:40] and and it made
[16:41] this good shade was a good place to rest
[16:45] a good place to rest under i didn't get
[16:47] a picture of it but they the leaves are
[16:49] heart-shaped and even on the other the
[16:52] on the underside it's kind of a uh
[16:55] it's soft and kind of downy they say and
[16:57] it's even very fragrant so it's a
[16:59] pleasant place to rest it has ample
[17:02] shade for putting up a tent or for
[17:04] resting and you can even see here maybe
[17:06] underneath the the quote that i have
[17:08] pasted there that there's benches and
[17:11] this one broadway here in israel these
[17:12] trees that are lining up this in tel
[17:14] aviv
[17:15] these are sycamore trees and there's
[17:17] benches placed underneath them and it
[17:19] shades this walkway because that's how
[17:21] this tree was used for generations and
[17:24] for centuries
[17:25] and because of the nature of the
[17:26] sycamore tree and it being easy to plant
[17:28] and maybe easy to find it was frequently
[17:30] planted by the wayside or by highways to
[17:33] the common passage areas
[17:36] and as it says in luke chapter 18 verse
[17:39] 35
[17:40] as we read in our text that
[17:42] this blind man says he sat by the
[17:45] wayside
[17:47] and so as we read it in luke chapter 18
[17:49] and then went into chapter 19 and we
[17:50] find zacchaeus in a sycamore tree on the
[17:53] wayside it was probably under sycamore
[17:55] tree that this blind man sat
[17:58] so mark chapter 10 verses 46 to 52
[18:02] says and they came to jericho this is a
[18:04] different uh
[18:05] recording of the same event and they
[18:08] came to jericho and as he went out of
[18:09] jericho with his disciples and a great
[18:11] number of people blind bartimaeus the
[18:13] son of timaeus sat by the highway side
[18:16] begging
[18:17] if he was sitting by the highway side
[18:19] begging it's most likely that he's
[18:20] sitting under a tree sitting under a
[18:22] quiet place he's sent under a restful
[18:24] place he's sitting in one of these
[18:25] shaded ways as it was frequently planted
[18:27] by the wayside or a highway side begging
[18:29] this is probably where blind bartimaeus
[18:31] sat
[18:32] and when he heard that it was jesus of
[18:34] nazareth he began to cry out and say
[18:36] jesus thou son of david have mercy on me
[18:39] and notice this in many charges he
[18:41] should hold his peace but he cried the
[18:42] more a great deal thou son of david have
[18:45] mercy on me and jesus stood still
[18:49] and commanded him to be called and they
[18:52] called the blind man saying to him be of
[18:54] good comfort rise he calleth thee
[18:56] and he casting away his garment rose and
[18:59] came to jesus and jesus answered and
[19:01] said unto him what wilt thou that i
[19:03] should do unto thee the blind man said
[19:06] unto him lord that i may receive my
[19:08] sight
[19:09] and jesus said unto them go thy way thy
[19:11] faith hath made thee whole
[19:13] and immediately he received the sight
[19:15] and followed jesus in
[19:17] the way
[19:19] and so it is at the sycamore tree this
[19:22] is what brought all this into focus and
[19:24] i had been um
[19:26] drawn by the scripture thou son of david
[19:29] have mercy on me and then i'm drawing a
[19:30] lot of inspiration from a particular
[19:32] sermon that brother bannon preached
[19:33] called thou son of david have mercy on
[19:35] me
[19:36] and it is at the sycamore tree
[19:40] that the stories of bartimaeus and
[19:43] zacchaeus intertwine or meet
[19:46] we could see some other similarities but
[19:48] that's where i want to bring those two
[19:49] stories together and i'm going to just
[19:51] start looking at scriptures to compare
[19:53] them and contrast them because there's
[19:55] similarities and there's differences
[19:57] in luke chapter 18 verse 35 it says it
[19:59] came to pass that he christ was come
[20:01] nigh into jerusalem it may sound like
[20:03] he's drawing near to it but when you
[20:05] look at the original uh you kind of look
[20:06] at the language that's used it's
[20:08] speaking that he was near to it he could
[20:10] have been leaving the old city coming to
[20:11] the new
[20:12] there's really no contradiction as it
[20:14] says he enters into and passes through
[20:16] or when he draws nigh and then as it
[20:18] says in mark chapter 10 as they were
[20:20] come to jerusalem and went out of
[20:22] jericho
[20:23] the meaning is we shouldn't get hung up
[20:25] on those words because he was just near
[20:26] jericho he's on the same passageway and
[20:29] says a certain blind man who is this
[20:31] certain blind man
[20:33] it's bartimaeus
[20:35] and it says he sat by the wayside
[20:37] begging so jesus is near jericho there's
[20:40] a certain blind man who sits by the
[20:42] wayside begging
[20:44] now catch this bartimaeus
[20:46] it means son of timaeus and tomas means
[20:48] unclean
[20:50] defiled or impure
[20:53] and then in luke chapter 19 the very
[20:54] next story that we read about and again
[20:56] we have it broke up into chapters but i
[20:58] believe the positioning is for a reason
[21:00] i think this this story only being told
[21:02] by luke in conjunction with this story
[21:05] it's for a reason it brings things into
[21:06] focus and it says and jesus entered and
[21:08] passed through jericho so it's on the
[21:10] same trip the same line during the same
[21:12] period and behold there was a man named
[21:15] zacchaeus which was the chief among the
[21:17] publicans and he was rich
[21:19] you can already see a contrast between
[21:22] the two but not only does bartimaeus
[21:24] mean a son of unclean or son of the
[21:26] defiled zacchaeus means comes from a
[21:29] hebrew word meaning to be pure to be
[21:31] clean and bright
[21:33] what a difference in in their their
[21:35] backgrounds and their their past one was
[21:37] a blind beggar
[21:39] sitting by the wayside begging the other
[21:41] one is noted as chief among the
[21:42] publicans and he was rich he was rich he
[21:44] was a social elite they say he was a
[21:46] superintendent of the customs and
[21:48] tributes in the jericho district and
[21:49] around that area
[21:51] brother branham said he was prosperous
[21:53] he stood in in good with the rabbi he
[21:55] stood in good with all the societies so
[21:57] he thought if he got in trouble he'd get
[21:59] backed up and the sanhedrin was right
[22:01] for him
[22:02] there's a man who had a lot of fallback
[22:05] plans a lot of political backing he was
[22:06] very social had a lot of people that
[22:08] would have his back brother branham said
[22:09] he was a businessman of jericho very
[22:11] rich man it says let's say he owned a
[22:13] restaurant
[22:14] well things have changed he says let's
[22:16] say you owned a restaurant
[22:18] and i i heard a long time ago do you
[22:20] want to know how to make a small fortune
[22:23] start with a large fortune and open a
[22:25] restaurant
[22:26] and she'll end up with a small fortune
[22:30] but here at this time it was a
[22:32] restaurant owner and brother branham at
[22:34] one point in this one of the sermons
[22:35] he's preaching he
[22:36] mentions a rabbi ravinsky and everyone
[22:39] starts laughing he goes i'm just
[22:40] dramatizing here i hope there's no
[22:41] ravinski here
[22:43] and but who knows brother brandon may
[22:44] have known that one of these full gospel
[22:46] businessmen who's got a lot of money was
[22:47] a restaurant owner but he's talking
[22:49] about this very rich man a businessman
[22:51] let's say you owned a restaurant he says
[22:53] and so one is poor begging
[22:55] name means unclean and impure and then
[22:57] immediately contrasted by a rich man
[22:59] whose name means pure and clean bright
[23:03] how we could begin we could spend a lot
[23:05] of time on their differences we could go
[23:07] into the the life of bartimaeus we could
[23:09] go in the life of zacchaeus brother bram
[23:10] does a great job i believe he preaches
[23:12] sermons that are uh
[23:14] in which bartimaeus is the main subject
[23:17] 16 different times in his ministry all
[23:19] over the place in in germany san juan
[23:21] puerto rico and canada all over north
[23:23] america he preached blind bartimaeus and
[23:25] a few other sermons that have the same
[23:28] subject matter so it's very uh very
[23:30] unique and then a few times it maybe
[23:32] several times he's using zacchaeus but
[23:34] he preaches on zacchaeus the businessman
[23:36] and they're joined right together in
[23:38] this story from luke chapter 18 to luke
[23:41] chapter 19.
[23:42] focusing around
[23:44] jesus's trip around jericho or through
[23:46] jericho
[23:47] and but i want you to think of it this
[23:49] way despite there's differences
[23:51] there's something that brings them
[23:53] together
[23:54] because we're not we're not telling the
[23:55] story where the the
[23:57] um kind of the arc of it is you have the
[24:00] antagonist and you have the hero
[24:02] and here's here's one who's going to
[24:04] come out on top the beggar the poor man
[24:06] he succeeds whereas the rich man fails
[24:08] no there's something that brings them
[24:09] together
[24:11] they even have certain things in common
[24:12] as we look at the scripture because both
[24:13] of them get hated by the crowds
[24:16] in matthew chapter 20 verse 31 and the
[24:18] multitude rebuked them
[24:20] and it because in matthew chapter 20 it
[24:21] says there's two blind men
[24:24] and he says the multitude rebuke them
[24:25] because they should hold their peace but
[24:27] they cried the more saying have mercy on
[24:29] us o lord thou son of david they charged
[24:31] him that he should hold this peace and
[24:33] these places that we've read they they
[24:35] said oh be quiet they rebuked him that
[24:37] he should hold his peace but he cried
[24:38] the much more saying oh lord thou son of
[24:41] david have mercy on us and the crowd is
[24:44] rebuking him
[24:45] and then when uh and this is the poor
[24:47] man the beggar the the son of the
[24:49] unclean and the defiled but then
[24:51] zacchaeus doesn't have any better luck
[24:52] when jesus goes over to his house it
[24:54] says in luke 19 verse 7 and when they
[24:57] saw it they all murmured saying that he
[24:58] was gone to be guest with a man that is
[25:00] a sinner
[25:02] so they both find they draw kind of the
[25:04] the ire and the hatred or the animosity
[25:06] of the crown
[25:09] and
[25:09] i want you to recognize this similarity
[25:11] and i know you might be saying well
[25:12] brother aaron you're kind of assuming
[25:14] that that bartimaeus was under a
[25:15] sycamore i know
[25:17] i know i'm doing that
[25:18] but let's say that from their location
[25:20] under the crown of the sycamore
[25:23] jesus speak jesus calls to them both
[25:26] one may have been rich one may be
[25:27] perched in the tree the other one may be
[25:29] a poor broken at the bottom of the tree
[25:31] they had different positions and
[25:32] relationships to the tree but both of
[25:34] them were called by christ
[25:37] in mark chapter 10 verse 49 it says and
[25:39] jesus stood still
[25:41] i believe it's brother branham that says
[25:42] it what would be greater joshua causing
[25:45] the sun to stand still
[25:47] or blind bartimaeus causing the sun of
[25:50] god to stand still
[25:52] and jesus stood still and commanded him
[25:54] to be called and they call the blind man
[25:58] saying unto him be of good comfort rise
[26:01] he calleth thee
[26:04] sorry if i didn't provide that slide for
[26:06] you and jesus stood still and commanded
[26:08] him to be called and they called the
[26:10] blind man saying him give good comfort
[26:12] rise he coffee catch that i want to come
[26:14] back to it that they recognize he's
[26:16] called for you brother branham when he's
[26:18] talking about he says christ was
[26:19] probably a hundred yards away there was
[26:21] a throng around him it was very crowded
[26:23] zacchaeus had to get up in a tree to see
[26:25] him
[26:26] but yet somehow what he's saying catches
[26:28] the attention of christ and he stood
[26:29] still
[26:30] then in luke chapter 19 verse 5 it says
[26:33] and when jesus came to the place he
[26:35] looked up and saw him and said unto him
[26:37] zacchaeus make haste and come down for
[26:40] today i must abide at thy house.
[26:44] notice in both instances there under
[26:46] this shade of this sycamore tree christ
[26:49] stops and calls to the blind man but he
[26:52] also stops and looks up and calls to
[26:53] zacchaeus and says make hays come down
[26:55] and take me into your home
[26:59] brother brown makes this comparison and
[27:00] presence of god unrecognized i want you
[27:02] to kind of catch this application
[27:04] he says in the sermon blind bartimaeus
[27:06] blind bartimaeus touched his garment
[27:08] when he cried thou son of david have
[27:10] mercy on me didn't literally touch it
[27:12] but spiritually he touched it standing
[27:14] 200 yards from where he passed by by his
[27:17] faith it passed by his faith stopped the
[27:20] son of god in the road and turned him
[27:22] around and said bring him here
[27:24] they said be of good comfort bartimaeus
[27:27] jesus of nazareth is actually calling
[27:29] for you calling for the blind man and he
[27:31] comes forward
[27:33] and he says little zacchaeus up in the
[27:34] tree hid himself and said so he didn't
[27:36] believe he was a prophet either
[27:39] and jesus come right stood under the
[27:41] tree and looked up and said zacchaeus
[27:43] come down and called him his name
[27:47] now catch what's happening brother brown
[27:48] is bringing these two stories together
[27:49] and they're posit they're not positioned
[27:51] together in luke as bartimaeus and
[27:53] zacchaeus
[27:54] but we know from the other readings in
[27:56] matthew and mark that this is blind
[27:58] bartimaeus
[27:59] in particular mark
[28:01] but now notice how programs bringing
[28:03] them together as similar circumstances
[28:05] where god knows bartimaeus and his need
[28:08] he knows where he's at he knows where
[28:09] zacchaeus is at
[28:11] so if you ponder uh why bartimaeus would
[28:14] have been in the tree or near the tree
[28:16] or under the tree even why zacchaeus is
[28:17] in the tree the sycamore tree was a
[28:19] place of rest
[28:21] it provided shade it could even provide
[28:23] fruit
[28:24] but most importantly
[28:26] as we could even say about church we
[28:28] talked about the grove it's a place of
[28:29] rest come in relax rest it's a place to
[28:31] be fed a place to be nourished a place
[28:33] of hospitality and though all those
[28:35] things are wonderful place of fellowship
[28:37] a place of belonging a place of
[28:38] friendship but more than that it's more
[28:41] than just a shady place it's more than
[28:43] just a place that has fruit to feed you
[28:45] but more than that it's a place where
[28:47] christ calls to you
[28:49] it's a place where christ should be
[28:50] speaking to you
[28:52] brother braham says in the message
[28:53] scriptural signs of the time he says we
[28:55] see the blind bartimaeus we see little
[28:57] zacchaeus in a tree hid he's drawing
[29:00] these similarities how christ caught
[29:02] them where they were and spoke to him
[29:03] jesus said he'll never
[29:05] hid he said jesus he'll never see me up
[29:08] here and jesus stood right under the
[29:10] tree looked up and said zacchaeus come
[29:12] on down
[29:13] he was the word and the word discerns
[29:16] the thoughts
[29:17] the thought that's in the heart
[29:19] that's what this sycamore tree is to
[29:21] represent that's what this aspect i'm
[29:22] trying to bring out this is the kind of
[29:24] experience we ought to be having in
[29:25] church is it's a place where the word is
[29:28] still discerning your thoughts it's a
[29:30] place where the word preached is still
[29:32] calling your name where it may not have
[29:34] to be i don't need to be up here every
[29:36] service calling out names and calling
[29:38] out people's problems and because i know
[29:40] and saying different things when the
[29:42] bible speaks of the gift of knowledge i
[29:44] think a lot of people use it in the
[29:45] sense that i know it so i'm going to
[29:46] talk about it
[29:47] and they and they share certain things
[29:49] and it's not always wrong to necessarily
[29:51] do that but the word should be calling
[29:53] your name
[29:56] it shouldn't it shouldn't be where where
[29:58] the the you come to church and it's as
[30:00] if you're perched up in the tree and
[30:01] you're zacchaeus up in the tree
[30:04] and jesus is over here saying hey hey
[30:07] somebody whoever you are over there in
[30:09] the ditch you know do you need some help
[30:12] i'm like well here i am up in the tree
[30:13] he must not be talking to me you want
[30:15] things to become personal you want
[30:17] things to be relatable it's a place
[30:18] where the word meets you where you are
[30:21] you may not need to be living in the
[30:22] tree you may not be living at the base
[30:24] of the tree so the word has to come and
[30:26] find you where you are and speak to you
[30:29] so it's under the sycamore in my
[30:31] dramatization today it's where christ
[30:34] meets the needs of both bartimaeus and
[30:38] zacchaeus
[30:40] i want to focus on this for a little bit
[30:42] in luke chapter 18 verses 41 and 42.
[30:45] it's a very beautiful passage if you
[30:47] could read through them again maybe in
[30:48] your own time and just ponder these
[30:50] things and zacchaeus makes haste to come
[30:52] to him and he says he asked him what
[30:55] wilt thou that i shall do unto thee
[30:59] now what kind of what would we say today
[31:02] if we were asked if christ said what can
[31:04] i do for you reminds me even of the
[31:06] question of how do you write ask what
[31:08] you want to be given to you
[31:09] he says what well then i should do unto
[31:11] thee and he said lord that i may receive
[31:13] my sight and jesus said unto him receive
[31:16] thy sight thy faith hath saved thee
[31:19] there's a tremendous lesson being
[31:21] expressed here christ comes to blind
[31:24] bartimaeus and he asks him he calls for
[31:27] him to come and he comes and it's not
[31:29] bartimaeus asking the question a lot of
[31:31] places we see that christ is the one
[31:32] that's being asked the question but here
[31:34] bartimaeus is the one asked and he has
[31:36] the response i want to receive my sight
[31:39] and i think of the humility of
[31:41] bartimaeus here that he was a beggar
[31:43] he's leaving his position of begging
[31:46] this is where he made a living this is
[31:47] where he got his money so he's sitting
[31:49] there on the wayside begging hopefully
[31:51] that the people will pass by and have
[31:53] mercy on him and give him money but as a
[31:55] beggar he recognized what the real need
[31:58] was
[31:59] i want you to catch this because this
[32:00] has so many practical applications where
[32:03] sometimes we have a root problem that
[32:05] causes certain symptoms and when we're
[32:07] asked what can we do for you says well
[32:09] we just need a little bit of money to
[32:10] get through the month we just need a
[32:12] little bit of help here we just need a
[32:14] little bit of that
[32:15] this and we need more fellowship we need
[32:16] more of this and you're asking for
[32:18] things that are ancillary or tangential
[32:20] to the real problem
[32:23] and so at least
[32:24] bartimaeus recognizes hey i could ask
[32:27] for money and that'll get me so far but
[32:29] if he can heal my eyes i can make a
[32:31] living myself
[32:33] so he recognized the real need it wasn't
[32:35] money but it was his blindness
[32:37] and says by faith he received his sight
[32:41] now i want to touch on this i've been
[32:43] studying for well over a year now on a
[32:45] subject called christ my healer
[32:47] and and i'm really wanting to do
[32:49] more than just a service on it just
[32:52] waiting for the right time for god to
[32:53] anoint it but it's been it's relating to
[32:55] the subject of divine healing
[32:58] and i want to touch on this for a moment
[33:00] because this is what's expressed in this
[33:03] as it says
[33:04] that he received his sight so this was a
[33:07] miracle of him receiving his actual
[33:09] sight so we could certainly make
[33:11] application to spiritualize sight but
[33:12] this is the literal healing of
[33:14] his optics or his uh his eye
[33:17] and brother brown says divine healing is
[33:19] a great drawing card
[33:21] to get the people to look to the lord
[33:23] jesus
[33:24] so think of that divine healing is a
[33:26] great drawing card i'm wanting to just
[33:28] to kind of uh recognize these things and
[33:31] have the right attitude towards them
[33:33] brother man says if he calls you to
[33:34] preach the gospel divine healing is
[33:36] included in it so you can't preach the
[33:39] gospel without actually preaching divine
[33:41] healing i'll say it this way if you
[33:43] preach the gospel any part of the gospel
[33:45] to a people that believes the gospel
[33:47] just bear with me
[33:49] divine healing could be an unintended
[33:51] consequence
[33:53] right you could just be teaching as
[33:54] christ was in the synagogue and he says
[33:56] there was power there to heal them all
[33:58] he's just teaching but then the power of
[34:00] god is present why because where the
[34:02] word is there's power there's christ
[34:04] there there it's his supremacy and so if
[34:07] you're listening to the word of god and
[34:09] receiving the word of god you could
[34:10] receive healing just according to your
[34:12] attitude towards the word of god why
[34:14] because where the gospel is there's
[34:16] divine healing in it
[34:19] and so you can't preach the gospel and
[34:20] preach against divine healing
[34:23] brother braham says in another place
[34:24] divine healing is one of the great
[34:25] masterpieces of the bible
[34:28] the masterpieces of god that were given
[34:30] to the christian church that's been long
[34:32] forgotten long ago
[34:34] but it's something that belongs to us
[34:37] it's something that's your personal
[34:39] property
[34:41] do you catch that
[34:42] i don't believe he was speaking this at
[34:43] a minister's convention
[34:45] and he wasn't just saying it to the
[34:46] headliners right
[34:48] he's saying it to the believer
[34:50] divine healing is your personal property
[34:54] that's the attitude we ought to take to
[34:56] our own physical healing our divine
[34:57] healing is that it belongs to me it's my
[35:00] personal property i believe the gospel
[35:02] so divine healing is included in it i
[35:05] never have this attitude or idea that
[35:07] i'm going to mature far enough into the
[35:09] word of god where divine healing is
[35:12] fades away and left off it's always in
[35:15] the atonement it's always in the word
[35:19] brother branham says in the message thou
[35:20] son of david have mercy on me and this
[35:23] is just comes up right in this subject
[35:26] of bartimaeus and even zacchaeus
[35:27] included they had to fight for every
[35:29] inch of ground they took coming out of
[35:31] egypt and israel that's right fighting
[35:32] and take it fight every inch but he said
[35:35] everywhere the souls of your foot land
[35:37] that's possession footsteps is
[35:39] possession
[35:40] that's the same thing it is today
[35:42] divine healing belongs to us
[35:46] why don't you say divine healing belongs
[35:48] to me
[35:50] that throw you off there say it belongs
[35:53] to me
[35:54] because i don't want that i don't want
[35:55] there to be some sort of vicarious
[35:57] possession through somebody else and say
[35:59] well i guess brother aaron has it so i
[36:01] guess technically i have it too
[36:03] no
[36:04] you have it
[36:06] you can believe it for yourself he says
[36:07] the holy spirit belongs to us it's our
[36:10] property
[36:12] but you'll have to fight every inch of
[36:14] it
[36:15] yes sir but brother footsteps is
[36:16] possession just keep fighting take it
[36:18] the devil says the days of miracles has
[36:20] passed say you're a liar
[36:22] right that's what fear wants to say it's
[36:24] not for you it's for somebody else or
[36:25] that's that's only in this and only in
[36:27] that and that's a glare of another age
[36:29] no divine healing is in the atonement
[36:31] it's our possession say devil you're a
[36:34] liar god said he's the same yesterday
[36:35] today and forever take it over
[36:37] everywhere your footsteps that's
[36:38] possession
[36:41] and this is expressed in this
[36:42] interaction at the sycamore tree divine
[36:45] healing for the physical need that
[36:46] bartimaeus had
[36:49] now taken a step further and looking at
[36:50] zacchaeus in luke chapter 19 verses 8 to
[36:53] 10
[36:54] it says and zacchaeus stood and said
[36:56] unto the lord behold lord
[36:59] the half of my goods i give to the poor
[37:02] and have taken anything from any man by
[37:04] false accusation i restore him
[37:06] fourfold and jesus said unto him now
[37:09] notice what he says
[37:10] because of the attitude the repentance
[37:12] of zacchaeus the acknowledgement of
[37:14] where he was lacking his shame even how
[37:17] his reputation amongst the people
[37:20] uh brother branham in one place says
[37:21] that he was a businessman and tried to
[37:23] be honest but yet something is a little
[37:26] askew here because the people look at
[37:27] jesus going in his house like look at
[37:29] this great here he goes
[37:30] what kind of person would hang out with
[37:32] zacchaeus
[37:34] and he says
[37:36] and
[37:37] he recognizes this meeting this chance
[37:40] what seems to be a chance meeting
[37:43] he he expresses this repentance to the
[37:46] master to christ and jesus in him this
[37:48] day is salvation
[37:52] so tyria deliverance it's derived from
[37:54] so terror savior
[37:56] so the savior is giving him salvation
[37:59] this day is salvation come to this house
[38:01] for so much as he also is a son of
[38:05] abraham what a tremendous application
[38:07] the son of abraham for the son of man
[38:09] has come to seek and to save that's from
[38:12] sozo to save the lost
[38:15] so in both places thy faith has saved
[38:18] thee that's sozo
[38:19] and here that i've come to seek and save
[38:22] and salvation has come to this house
[38:24] your salvation it's a reference both to
[38:26] divine healing and salvation of the
[38:28] person from sin and unbelief
[38:31] brother adam and the sermon blind
[38:32] bartimaeus and he preaches that title
[38:34] several times the word in the greek is
[38:36] sozo the word save or salvation is sozo
[38:39] same one for healing sozo notice how
[38:41] he's putting that here means they were
[38:43] physically saved or spiritually saved
[38:47] saved in relation to healing the saved
[38:48] in relationship to salvation they're the
[38:50] same sal the same word they were they
[38:52] were means they were physically saved or
[38:55] spiritually saved
[38:56] so i want you to catch this divine
[38:58] healing is in the atonement
[39:01] and brother branham treats it in certain
[39:03] places where it's quite remarkable when
[39:05] you look at it this way he's saying that
[39:09] and maybe i'll just say it this way
[39:10] our salvation had to be purchased
[39:14] and so in the purchases of our salvation
[39:17] and the blood being shed that's the
[39:19] atonement the goal was your soul
[39:22] and by virtue of that powerful
[39:25] redemption from death and the powerful
[39:27] redemption of your soul it has this
[39:29] consequence that reverberates through
[39:32] both spirit and body and the price for
[39:34] your soul was so great it included the
[39:37] healing of your body
[39:39] so it's not that well we have a price
[39:42] for healing and we have a price for this
[39:43] it's not like the catholic church where
[39:45] it's all the cart you can just pay for
[39:46] what you need but no it was one prize
[39:49] for your salvation and when he paid for
[39:52] your salvation it's like well my soul is
[39:54] saved it's washed in the blood of jesus
[39:56] christ and that price was so great it
[39:59] actually included the healing of the
[40:01] body
[40:02] it's included in the prices our
[40:04] salvation
[40:06] and so when brother man makes a
[40:07] statement like this divine healing is
[40:09] not all the message
[40:11] and and he talks about how you can't
[40:12] major on a minor
[40:14] it's because the the the price was for
[40:17] your soul
[40:20] it would it would be like well and i'm
[40:23] kind of cringing at the thought of it i
[40:24] don't really like buffets but it'd be
[40:26] like going to a buffet and paying the
[40:27] price for the whole thing
[40:29] and just just getting all you could
[40:31] drink refills
[40:33] on water
[40:35] hey
[40:37] why did you why did you pay 39.99 for
[40:39] this buffet
[40:40] well i i was thirsty and uh you know i
[40:43] that's why i i need i need to hydrate
[40:45] and
[40:45] uh it's dry it's a dry heat
[40:48] i thank goodness it's there's not
[40:49] tremendous humidity here you know
[40:51] whatever your logic might be but you
[40:52] know what when you paid the 40 bucks
[40:54] it's all included
[40:55] as many trips as you want
[40:58] and so there's some well i i just want
[41:00] to eat the dessert bar just want to eat
[41:01] the dessert bar that's all i want to use
[41:02] the dessert that's fine but it's all
[41:04] included divine healing is not all the
[41:07] message he says
[41:09] so the healing
[41:10] now even in this in this aspect i want
[41:12] you to catch this when christ heals
[41:15] bartimaeus of this
[41:18] of his blindness there's a spiritual
[41:20] application right
[41:21] to be spiritually blind there's this
[41:23] type but when christ heals bartimaeus
[41:26] the first time
[41:28] and when he heals him
[41:30] there's some symbolic representation in
[41:32] even healing the body because divine
[41:35] healing isn't possible unless there had
[41:37] been a price for the soul
[41:39] so when he when he heals him it speaks
[41:42] of salvation
[41:44] because brother man said divine healing
[41:46] is the earnest of the resurrection
[41:49] i want you to catch that divine healing
[41:51] is the earnest of the resurrection
[41:54] so in the sermon thou son of david have
[41:55] mercy on me
[41:57] he this is at the very beginning he says
[41:59] this now i've been for a few nights
[42:01] preaching and just the gospel
[42:03] because i think if a person is healed if
[42:05] they live very long they'll probably get
[42:07] sick again
[42:09] and the people said amen to that
[42:12] you live long enough you're going to get
[42:13] sick again he says but if you're saved
[42:16] that's eternal and you have eternal life
[42:19] he says and it's getting so late in the
[42:21] evening lights that i feel that one
[42:23] great thing is needed most of all that's
[42:26] salvation
[42:28] and divine healing is merely age just
[42:29] like brother bosworth used to say divine
[42:31] healing is the bait that you put on a
[42:33] hook
[42:34] the fish doesn't see the hook it just
[42:37] takes the bait and gets the hook so
[42:39] that's the way it is
[42:41] people see the supernatural catch how
[42:43] this all works together people see the
[42:45] supernatural the phenomena of
[42:47] supernatural god healing the sick
[42:50] and they reach out for that and first
[42:52] thing you know they're right in the arms
[42:54] of the lord jesus with great faith to
[42:56] believe
[42:57] and then they become a christian and
[42:58] have eternal life
[43:00] so it's obeyed on the hook
[43:02] so there's that in the sense that it's
[43:05] something to draw as he said it's a
[43:06] great masterpiece but he says it's a
[43:08] drawing card to get people to look to
[43:10] the lord jesus so he's wanting us to
[43:12] recognize divine healing is part of the
[43:14] purchase price for our salvation and so
[43:17] god will actually use the phenomena of
[43:19] the supernatural to get somebody's
[43:21] attention and then that getting their
[43:23] attention they're not just satisfied
[43:25] being healed but it brings them into a
[43:27] relationship with christ they become a
[43:29] christian have eternal life
[43:31] he says a great percent of our lord's
[43:32] ministry about 80 of it or better i
[43:34] think it was estimated about 80 percent
[43:36] of his ministry was divine healing
[43:38] so he did that
[43:41] catch this he did that
[43:43] to catch the eyes of the multitude
[43:45] and also to show that he was their
[43:47] messiah
[43:49] so divine healing is to catch the eye
[43:51] but to unfold unto redemption
[43:55] you couldn't you couldn't major on
[43:57] divine healing to say that he shed his
[43:59] blood and he paid the price so that we
[44:01] could all be healed and then just stop
[44:03] there and it's all about the
[44:05] the healing of the body no it catches
[44:07] the eye and if we can have the
[44:09] experience of being healed in our bodies
[44:12] then it increases our faith and it
[44:14] catches our attention to know he's
[44:16] present with us he's his word is real he
[44:18] keeps his promises and correctly placed
[44:21] and understood we continue to walk watch
[44:24] redemption unfold from that experience
[44:29] brother brahm says in the sermon 10
[44:30] virgins and i do believe in divine
[44:32] healing
[44:33] it's one of the great doctrines of the
[44:34] bible but divine healing has more to it
[44:37] than just divine healing
[44:39] that'll get your attention
[44:41] divine healing has more to it than just
[44:43] divine healing in other words divine
[44:44] healing isn't just for the healing
[44:47] itself
[44:48] it speaks of something as he said it's
[44:50] an earnest of the resurrection here he
[44:51] says divine healing has more to it than
[44:53] just divine healing divine healing only
[44:55] says there's a god who's coming again
[44:58] so divine healing should put us under
[45:00] expectation to see more of god
[45:03] what divine healing is there's a god
[45:05] that's coming again even if you wanted
[45:06] to kind of extend that a little bit to
[45:08] say oh i'm healed in my body then
[45:10] there's a god who can do this there's a
[45:11] god who can do that it's an expectation
[45:13] that god will continue to fill his
[45:15] promised word so you got to keep
[45:16] advancing forward to where god is it's
[45:19] not something you keep hearkening back
[45:21] to but you use the momentum of because
[45:23] it testified there's a god who's coming
[45:25] again what does divine healing speak of
[45:27] it's the earnest of our resurrection
[45:31] that's what it speaks of it says if
[45:32] there's no divine healing then there's
[45:34] no resurrection
[45:36] so what is it it's an earnest of the
[45:37] resurrection it's a sign of the
[45:38] resurrection it speaks of the
[45:40] resurrection whenever there's divine
[45:42] healing it should remind us that there's
[45:43] a new body coming
[45:46] because if there was no divine healing
[45:47] he's saying that if there had been no
[45:49] divine healing there wouldn't be a
[45:51] resurrection
[45:52] and you might say well how do how do we
[45:54] make that to work well if there had been
[45:56] no price for your soul
[45:58] there'd be no resurrection
[46:00] and without the price for your soul
[46:02] there'd be no divine healing and i'm not
[46:03] doing complicated trigonometry here but
[46:05] i'm telling you it's all connected
[46:08] together
[46:10] and these are the things these are the
[46:12] two things that we see transpiring
[46:14] at the intersection of this sycamore
[46:16] tree
[46:18] i think it was hallelujah avenue and
[46:19] glory drive or something like that in
[46:21] one place brother ben talked about
[46:24] where zacchaeus went but it's in this
[46:26] image of the sycamore tree i'm not
[46:27] saying it was the exact same one
[46:29] but the sycamore was a place
[46:33] where bartimaeus came to his healing
[46:34] when zacchaeus came to salvation
[46:37] and this sycamore tree or a sycamore
[46:39] tree the church must be a place where
[46:41] salvation and divine healing are
[46:42] available
[46:45] it should be something that's taught
[46:47] should be something that's believed
[46:49] but the brain says in the sermon thou
[46:50] son of david have mercy on me says
[46:51] jehovah doesn't heal the people anymore
[46:53] he's quoting the people jehovah don't
[46:55] heal the people anymore you know he said
[46:56] that never that never did die out oh
[46:58] jehovah don't do those things no more
[47:00] we're just supposed to live good pay our
[47:01] tithes go to church at every meeting and
[47:03] then that's all we're supposed to do but
[47:04] jehovah doesn't heal he was jehovah back
[47:06] there but today he's not concerned about
[47:08] it oh what a mistake he's always
[47:10] concerned
[47:13] what a mistake he's always concerned if
[47:15] he ever was concerned he's still
[47:16] concerned yes sir he cannot change his
[47:19] motives he cannot change his attitude
[47:21] he's still jehovah i don't care how many
[47:24] says that he's changed its people's
[47:26] changed but he hasn't changed
[47:29] it's the people that change listen if
[47:31] there's any kind of shortcoming where
[47:33] something's not happening something's
[47:35] not working don't blame the word of god
[47:37] because the word hasn't changed the
[47:38] power is still the same but he says it's
[47:40] the people that change he says he hasn't
[47:43] changed the reason that we don't see him
[47:45] doing those things is because we won't
[47:47] let him do it he's willing
[47:51] and so you don't want to throw up a
[47:52] barrier a roadblock
[47:54] to divine healing you don't want to cast
[47:56] it in the wrong light you don't want to
[47:57] put a scarlet letter on it you don't
[47:59] want to say anything to diminish it we
[48:01] could say we shouldn't major on a minor
[48:03] but you shouldn't diminish the minor
[48:05] unless you're playing the piano
[48:07] maybe can you diminish a minor where's
[48:09] my musical scholars here no you can't
[48:12] yes okay good
[48:14] you can diminish a minor over a seventh
[48:19] but it's not something that ought to be
[48:21] diminished he says it ought to be
[48:23] uh
[48:24] he's willing so we have to let him
[48:29] the grove or the sycamore should never
[48:31] make us reluctant
[48:32] i think i've said this before brother
[48:34] bam said about pastors he says pastors
[48:36] are very suspicious of the most
[48:38] suspicious people
[48:40] and it's true he says they ought to be
[48:41] that way and it kind of gives some
[48:43] validation and still of approval for
[48:44] pastors who are very very suspicious but
[48:46] he didn't say that we ought to sow
[48:48] suspicion into the sheep
[48:51] right
[48:52] we're you spend every service bashing
[48:54] every preacher and you're thinking i
[48:55] don't want to hear another preacher in
[48:57] my life right
[48:58] and make
[48:59] suspicious of every other preacher and
[49:01] every other church and every other thing
[49:02] no you should never the grove or the
[49:04] sycamore shouldn't make us reluctant to
[49:06] want to be healed shouldn't make us
[49:08] reluctant to want to know him shouldn't
[49:09] make us reluctant uh in certain areas
[49:11] that's not the purpose of church
[49:15] brother brahman the message stands still
[49:16] he says tomorrow afternoon is a gospel
[49:18] message not a healing service praying
[49:20] for the sick
[49:21] so it's not going to be a service to
[49:22] pray for the sick he says i think a
[49:24] whole lot of our healing services have
[49:26] turned too much to healing
[49:29] instead of trying to catch the precious
[49:31] souls that's to be saved
[49:34] so you notice how how this is applicable
[49:36] divine healing speaks that there's a god
[49:38] that's coming it's the earnest of our
[49:39] resurrection so divine healing points
[49:41] forward to full redemption
[49:43] it's to catch the eye to see redemption
[49:45] unfold he says i think our healing
[49:47] services have turned too much into
[49:49] healing
[49:50] and look that's all we're chasing is the
[49:52] healing so we start the cycle of healing
[49:55] to healing to healing he's saying the
[49:57] danger is that we lose the perspective
[49:59] that divine healing is to cause us to
[50:01] look to something greater and he uses in
[50:03] this context i think our healing
[50:04] services have become only about healing
[50:06] and it's not to catch the attention of
[50:09] the people that need deliverance and
[50:10] salvation it's not been used to take
[50:12] people further
[50:14] so i want you to catch that how he's
[50:16] recognizing there's a danger in this
[50:20] and so this is where kind of taking my
[50:22] my next step to advance in this and i
[50:24] mentioned it in the beginning but the
[50:26] benefits of the sikkim or tree or the
[50:28] function of the sycamore tree is
[50:30] wonderful it's tremendous but it can
[50:31] also have a downside
[50:33] it was a point to where the very things
[50:35] that the tree offers
[50:37] become a
[50:38] detriment and there seems to be if i
[50:41] could just say this there's so many
[50:42] voices going on right now in the world
[50:45] so many political voices so many
[50:47] movements
[50:48] uh even with
[50:50] and i don't say this again i'm not
[50:52] selling suspicion now just wanting you
[50:54] to ponder this
[50:56] but in one sense we might think wow what
[50:58] a tremendous victory the supreme court
[50:59] overturned roe v v wade
[51:02] but then you realize the catholic
[51:03] influence behind it
[51:06] right and you realize you realize some
[51:08] of the details and the platitudes and
[51:11] and the the basis that they have for
[51:13] defending this and you realize wow i
[51:14] don't really find much support in the
[51:16] word of god for this and it has a cat
[51:18] these catholic overtones and you find
[51:20] well i i mean i'm kind of wanting to say
[51:23] yay but then you see that and then you
[51:25] look at the other side you go well
[51:27] i don't want to go over there either
[51:29] right
[51:30] i mean why why are why are people
[51:32] weeping and wailing and lamenting it's
[51:34] like how many abortions have you had
[51:37] are we ruining your gig
[51:38] right and it's like what's the
[51:40] percentage of people that actually do
[51:41] this i don't want to know
[51:43] but there's it's something we're like
[51:45] man i don't want to get caught up in it
[51:47] that's in the political realm in the
[51:49] legal realm in the economic realm and
[51:51] there's people that are saying yep this
[51:52] is going to be worse than any any crash
[51:54] we've ever seen before and there's other
[51:56] people ah it's no big deal and you see
[51:57] one headline that says the phoenix
[51:59] housing market is skyrocketing how home
[52:02] value is going to be over a thousand
[52:03] percent in in phoenix and certain parts
[52:05] of tucson within six months and then you
[52:07] read another article says it's all going
[52:09] to zero in a matter of days
[52:11] and you've got one side of the church
[52:12] saying all right you got another side of
[52:14] the church saying oh no
[52:18] just so many voices
[52:20] and then i'll just be honest with you
[52:23] and i want to be very careful what i say
[52:26] but those of you who know my testimony
[52:28] i'm absolutely convinced of god's call
[52:31] in my life to come here and start a
[52:32] church
[52:34] and and one of the beautiful aspects is
[52:36] i could draw away from all the tennis
[52:37] messages that are taking place all over
[52:39] the world where brother so-and-so is
[52:41] preaching against brother so-and-so and
[52:42] everyone's drawing their swords and
[52:44] tearing down everybody else and i can
[52:45] have the opportunity to just put the
[52:47] emphasis on the word of god
[52:50] put the emphasis on the word different
[52:52] brothers are reaching out to me
[52:53] different ministers or even over the
[52:55] past week differ speaking of different
[52:57] pastors and different ministers and i'm
[52:58] just telling all of them now's not the
[53:00] time to fight now's the time not to
[53:02] stand toe-to-toe but to stand shoulder
[53:04] shoulder and draw our sword against the
[53:07] enemy because that's the only place the
[53:09] word is effective i can't try to use the
[53:12] sword of the word to cut and tear down
[53:13] the body of jesus christ it's only going
[53:15] to be effective against unbelief and sin
[53:17] and against the the the conspiracies of
[53:20] the devil so i want to stand shoulder to
[53:23] shoulder with the fellow brothers
[53:24] labored in the gospel even if we don't
[53:26] see eye to eye i don't want to go
[53:28] toe-to-toe i want to stand shoulder to
[53:30] shoulder and draw my sword against the
[53:32] devil because now's not the time to be
[53:34] fighting one another
[53:39] and so this tree can have a downside
[53:42] for bartimaeus is a place to hear christ
[53:45] had he not been under that tree that day
[53:47] and again and if you're saying where
[53:48] there was it saves under tree i'm just
[53:49] saying it i'm dramatizing it
[53:52] under that tree that day begging
[53:56] then he would have missed that chance to
[53:58] hear christ
[53:59] to call out to christ and hear the
[54:00] stories and the testimonies and call
[54:02] unto him
[54:04] for zacchaeus it was a place to see him
[54:07] you hear brother branham dramatizing
[54:09] that and how he climbed up on a garbage
[54:10] can and jumped up into the trees all
[54:12] dressed up real nice he talks about how
[54:14] his wife had been praying for him and
[54:16] praying for him and then he's tossed and
[54:17] turned all night long and she's like i
[54:19] think it's working i think it's getting
[54:21] to him and it just had so much he was
[54:22] like i know he's going to be passing
[54:24] through town i'm going to get up get
[54:25] dressed put on his stately robes and
[54:27] everything and got ready and ran out to
[54:28] try to find a place and he's too short
[54:30] so he's digging around trying to find a
[54:31] place has to use a trash can to hop up
[54:32] into the tree
[54:35] and so it's a place to hear him to call
[54:37] on him a place to see him as zacchaeus
[54:39] was wanting to see him
[54:41] but it can also be a place where we
[54:42] choose to stay or stop
[54:45] in other words that that's that's the
[54:47] goal at the end of the day just to be
[54:49] there at the tree
[54:51] and a place to hide
[54:53] george brother random is saying that
[54:55] with bartimaeus the divine healing
[54:57] pointed to something greater
[54:59] then it's a place where there's no
[55:00] salvation there's no progress it does
[55:02] become
[55:03] what a tree is it's just a gathering
[55:05] place
[55:07] it's a place where social needs are met
[55:09] it's a place where culture is created
[55:10] it's a place where we can get some
[55:12] things to kind of feed us a little bit
[55:13] it's a place where we can satisfy our
[55:15] urges for belonging and it just becomes
[55:17] something social
[55:19] so our allegiances are social our
[55:21] reasons for sticking around have more to
[55:22] do with the things that pertain to the
[55:24] flesh and not the things that pertain to
[55:26] the soul
[55:27] that's the danger
[55:28] of the sycamore
[55:30] but in mark chapter 10 verse 50 as we
[55:32] were reading earlier about bartimaeus
[55:36] son of the unpure impure
[55:38] the son of the unclean the defiled sat
[55:41] by the highway side begging perhaps
[55:42] under a sycamore tree
[55:44] being blind begging for alms and
[55:46] desiring that he would receive money to
[55:48] support his family when he had called
[55:51] thou son of david had mercy on me and
[55:53] jesus stood still
[55:55] and standing still said go get the blind
[55:57] man he might have said go get bartimaeus
[55:59] i'm like oh how do you know him well
[56:00] he's got quite the reputation and they
[56:02] run and they get himself good comfort be
[56:04] of good comfort the master christ
[56:06] calls for thee and it says and he
[56:08] casting away his garment rose and came
[56:11] to jesus
[56:12] here he was under the tree in the shade
[56:14] with his garment it says he cast it away
[56:17] he was throwing off his blankets some of
[56:19] the translations thrown off his blanket
[56:21] catch this throwing off the thing that
[56:22] covered him
[56:24] i don't know if they had weighted
[56:25] blankets in those days maybe he was
[56:27] feeling a little bit anxious but he cast
[56:29] off the thing that would give him
[56:30] comfort
[56:32] right it was his little blankie
[56:35] and covered him it was his covering it
[56:36] was something that kept him uh from
[56:38] being unclothed it might have been
[56:39] something that kept him warm it was
[56:41] something that uh even might have been
[56:43] psychological they even talk about how
[56:45] certain people in order to appear humble
[56:48] will will limp a little bit or kind of
[56:50] you know uh cower down a little and
[56:52] there's certain ways you try to signal
[56:53] to somebody you're humble and it might
[56:55] have been something where he felt even
[56:57] through his his complexes that this is
[56:59] humbling to me and i'm covering up i'm a
[57:01] little bit shy maybe he's an introvert i
[57:02] don't know but this is
[57:04] some in some tellings of the story they
[57:07] liken this blanket to be the last thing
[57:09] he possessed
[57:12] it was his identity you knew bartimaeus
[57:15] by his blanket
[57:17] you know by the cloak that he had the
[57:18] way that he covered himself maybe if he
[57:20] was laying down and resting you could
[57:22] tell oh that's bartimaeus by the blanket
[57:24] that's covered but whenever christ calls
[57:25] him he throws away his identity he
[57:27] throws away his comforts he throws away
[57:29] the very last thing that he has why
[57:31] because something greater has called him
[57:33] and all of a sudden the value of the
[57:34] blanket the value of the shade the value
[57:36] of the figs the value of even the
[57:37] begging he left maybe even behind the
[57:39] alms that he had gathered and he ran to
[57:42] christ he says christ says what can i do
[57:43] if he says i want my sight i want to be
[57:45] healed
[57:47] have any of you read the book the prince
[57:49] of the house of david
[57:52] brother branham read it or it's one of
[57:53] the books that we know that he studied
[57:54] and we believe that he read because
[57:56] brother branham dramatizes when he
[57:58] dramatizes blind bartimaeus and he tells
[58:00] a story
[58:01] he refers to it i think at least four
[58:03] different places i could say almost
[58:05] definitely three where he says i don't
[58:07] know if the story is true but i read
[58:08] some time and he begins to talk about
[58:10] the drama of bartimaeus
[58:12] and the prince of the house of david and
[58:14] the narrative of this story it
[58:15] dramatizes bartimaeus having a lamb
[58:18] a pigeon and some turtle doves
[58:20] and brother brown refers to how the
[58:22] turtle doves did tricks and he got money
[58:23] in the book it says the turtle doves
[58:25] were taught in cunning and pleasant
[58:26] tricks to please children
[58:29] and so it was not it was something that
[58:30] could bring joy it was something that he
[58:32] was known for it was something that
[58:34] maybe he did for his own children or
[58:35] something that he did to make a living
[58:37] his brother venom refers to but he his
[58:39] dad was sick and the narrative says that
[58:41] he offered the turtle doves if his dad
[58:44] would get well and his dad got well so
[58:46] he offered the turtle doves
[58:48] and then his wife got sick
[58:50] and his took his pigeon
[58:52] and he said if my wife gets well i'm
[58:54] gonna offer the pigeon
[58:56] and then his daughter got sick and all
[58:57] he had left was the lamb
[58:59] but this just wasn't a regular lamb
[59:02] and in the prince of the house of david
[59:03] and what brother branham points out is
[59:05] he when his daughter got sick
[59:08] and and and brother branham may have
[59:10] used uh kind of alternated between wife
[59:12] i don't know if he used his daughter but
[59:13] when his wife got sick says he pledged
[59:15] the lamb that's what the story says that
[59:17] he took that lamb and he said if my
[59:19] daughter will get well
[59:21] i'll offer this lamb
[59:23] sure enough his daughter got well
[59:25] and so he went to the temple to offer
[59:28] the lamb
[59:30] and when he went to offer the lamb the
[59:31] priest objected he said no i can't take
[59:33] your lamb and he said thy lamb leadeth
[59:36] thee everywhere it is thy eyes to thee
[59:39] so what it says in the prince of the
[59:40] house of david the the priest is saying
[59:42] wait hold on you're blind this is your
[59:45] seeing eye lamb instead of having a a a
[59:47] a dog a scene-eyed dogger uh to to guide
[59:50] him
[59:51] and
[59:52] and to lead him in the way he had a lamb
[59:54] that he would follow that would lead him
[59:56] and he says it's your eyes it leads you
[59:58] everywhere this is your only way to make
[59:59] it through the town this is your way to
[1:00:01] make it to the market this is the only
[1:00:03] way you can make it to the sycamore to
[1:00:04] beg this is your this is your livelihood
[1:00:06] it's your eyes to thee but he has it in
[1:00:09] his heart no i told the lord that if he
[1:00:12] would heal my daughter if you could just
[1:00:13] catch the beautiful analogy in this that
[1:00:16] if he would heal my daughter i would
[1:00:18] give a lamb
[1:00:20] and this is my lamb the priest says well
[1:00:22] let me buy it for give you money i'll
[1:00:24] give you money and you can go buy a lamb
[1:00:26] and offer it and bartemae says no then
[1:00:28] it wouldn't be my lamb it wouldn't be
[1:00:30] the one i pledge i pledge this lamb this
[1:00:32] lamb that's precious to me brother brad
[1:00:34] i'm in the sermon blind bartimaeus says
[1:00:36] he said thank you kindly priest of god
[1:00:37] but i never promised god a lamb i
[1:00:40] promised god this lamb he said there's a
[1:00:42] lesson in that he said you can't give
[1:00:44] that lamb bartimaeus the lamb is your
[1:00:46] eyes he said but old priest of god if
[1:00:49] i'll keep my promise to god god will
[1:00:51] provide a lamb for bartimaeus's eyes and
[1:00:53] that day when he heard that jesus of
[1:00:55] nazareth pass by watch faith go into
[1:00:58] action he grabs his robe and throws it
[1:01:01] sideways for god had provided a lamb for
[1:01:05] blind bartimaeus's eyes god provided
[1:01:08] lamb
[1:01:09] it tells me that when he was willing to
[1:01:11] give up things precious willing to give
[1:01:13] up his identity even in that moment he
[1:01:15] left the elements of his beggary he left
[1:01:18] the cloak that identified him he let
[1:01:20] nobody's gonna know who you are you're
[1:01:21] leaving your prime spot this is where
[1:01:23] you can collect a lot of money but he
[1:01:24] was going to the one the lamb
[1:01:27] that he said would be provided if he
[1:01:29] gave this one up and god the lamb gave
[1:01:32] him his eyesight back why god provided a
[1:01:34] lamb for him to see
[1:01:39] that's what we see in the response
[1:01:42] of bartimaeus
[1:01:44] but he could have just stayed there
[1:01:45] under that tree
[1:01:47] he could have thought well
[1:01:49] wait he's not going to come to me
[1:01:52] i'm blind
[1:01:53] this guy says come to me no i'm i'm fine
[1:01:56] where i'm at
[1:01:58] i've got enough shade where i am
[1:02:00] i'm getting
[1:02:01] enough support to get by
[1:02:03] i can eat the figs people looking out
[1:02:05] after me i i found somebody to help get
[1:02:07] me here and there i know i lost the land
[1:02:09] but if i beg enough i can get enough
[1:02:10] money to get another one he wasn't
[1:02:12] comfortable where he was
[1:02:14] he didn't stay in those comforts maybe
[1:02:16] he was comfortable but he wasn't willing
[1:02:17] just to be comfortable he wanted he
[1:02:18] wanted the right thing he wanted to
[1:02:20] progress he wanted to grow and he cast
[1:02:23] off the covering he cast off the cloak
[1:02:24] he could have stayed there but he didn't
[1:02:26] and he ran to meet him in the way
[1:02:30] now zacchaeus
[1:02:33] he used the tree to get up to see christ
[1:02:36] to have that vantage point he was little
[1:02:37] in stature he otherwise wouldn't be able
[1:02:38] to see him because of the throng
[1:02:41] but when you read the story that as you
[1:02:43] read how brother branham dramatized it
[1:02:46] that case wasn't exactly pure in his
[1:02:48] motives
[1:02:49] his initial reason for wanting to get up
[1:02:51] in that tree because he didn't really
[1:02:52] believe in jesus and so he was going to
[1:02:54] use it as a perch to judge from
[1:02:57] and brother brahman said he used this
[1:02:58] quote always been kind of a critic
[1:03:02] and so the sycamore tree
[1:03:04] if we can if we're not at the base
[1:03:06] begging
[1:03:07] we could kind of climb up it a little
[1:03:08] bit higher
[1:03:10] it becomes a place of pride and judgment
[1:03:13] we're not the beggar at the foot of the
[1:03:14] tree we become the critic
[1:03:17] in the branches of the tree
[1:03:19] bloodman called him a critic of the lord
[1:03:20] jesus is what zacchaeus was
[1:03:23] and i want to warn us it's very it can
[1:03:25] be very subtle but we can very quickly
[1:03:27] climb a branch in a sycamore tree and
[1:03:30] start looking down from it
[1:03:32] you could come to church and you're the
[1:03:33] you're the at the base you're at the
[1:03:35] bottom you're the beggar but be careful
[1:03:37] if god ever lifts you up to another rung
[1:03:38] to see a little bit better if you ever
[1:03:40] climb up don't make it a seat of
[1:03:41] judgment
[1:03:42] there should be no sniper's nest
[1:03:45] in the sycamore tree
[1:03:49] and so i want you to recognize i don't
[1:03:51] want to belabor it too much it can be a
[1:03:52] place where we get critical
[1:03:54] a place where we look down on everybody
[1:03:56] else
[1:03:57] hey because we're a little bit higher
[1:03:59] have you seen our sycamore
[1:04:00] you talk about figs figs or days right
[1:04:03] talk about shade
[1:04:05] we got shade
[1:04:06] and you get a little bit prideful about
[1:04:08] the tree
[1:04:09] and you look down on everybody else
[1:04:13] just hold that in your mind but it can
[1:04:15] also be this is the part i really wanted
[1:04:16] to emphasize it can also be a place
[1:04:18] where we hide
[1:04:21] i i'm just going to say this personally
[1:04:23] at some you know at one point while i'm
[1:04:24] preaching i feel like man i'm going to
[1:04:25] be done with this in 45 minutes and i
[1:04:27] start thinking
[1:04:28] these people are gonna think i don't
[1:04:29] have anything to preach anymore
[1:04:31] and people drive two hours and they
[1:04:33] could have i could have fit two sermons
[1:04:35] in that time or four hours round trip
[1:04:37] and i'm thinking do i need to preach
[1:04:38] four or eight what do i need to do
[1:04:41] and then
[1:04:42] i keep going i realize yeah i'm probably
[1:04:44] going to be longer than 45 minutes so
[1:04:46] bear with me i'm almost done
[1:04:49] but the other part is the tree can
[1:04:50] become a place to hide
[1:04:53] so zach he has climbed up in the tree we
[1:04:55] could look at the judgment part the
[1:04:56] critical part the pride part but one
[1:04:58] thing brother branham emphasized over
[1:04:59] and over again that he climbed up in
[1:05:01] there so he can observe christ
[1:05:04] his goal wasn't to meet him it was just
[1:05:06] to observe him brother makes some real
[1:05:09] interesting statements in many many
[1:05:10] different places but in one place he
[1:05:11] says he climbed up in a sycamore tree
[1:05:13] and put all the leaves around him
[1:05:16] so think about this he's up in the tree
[1:05:18] and now he wants to hide he doesn't want
[1:05:20] to be visible
[1:05:21] and the sycamore tree has these large
[1:05:23] leathery-like leaves
[1:05:25] that were perfect to hide behind
[1:05:27] and the more that i thought about it in
[1:05:28] a way originally struck me a month or so
[1:05:30] ago when i was looking into this is how
[1:05:32] that the way that brother brahm
[1:05:34] describes zacchaeus and the way that the
[1:05:36] tree is used and even some of the other
[1:05:37] symbolism in scripture is it's like this
[1:05:39] can become the worst of religion
[1:05:43] that when we get to a place where it's
[1:05:44] not only prideful and it's judgmental
[1:05:46] but we hide right behind it
[1:05:48] so we're taking cheap shots right we're
[1:05:50] sniping we're judgmental and we're
[1:05:51] critical but yeah we're hiding behind
[1:05:53] you can't see me i'm taking shots but
[1:05:55] you can't see me i'm judging you from
[1:05:57] above but you can't see me i'm above you
[1:05:59] you're beneath me
[1:06:01] and there's this kind of uh
[1:06:02] condescending attitude but you hide
[1:06:04] behind it brother bam says and i'm just
[1:06:06] thinking that's just the worst of
[1:06:08] religion brother man says he pulled them
[1:06:09] all around him and camouflaged himself
[1:06:13] the sycamore place sycamore tree can be
[1:06:14] a place where not only you rest but you
[1:06:16] get so restful you just go ahead and
[1:06:17] take a nap
[1:06:19] and you get lulled to sleep
[1:06:21] and then it just becomes a hideout
[1:06:24] i'm happy to say this church don't sleep
[1:06:26] 300 anymore
[1:06:30] you come to the place you hide in
[1:06:32] genesis genesis chapter 3 verse 7
[1:06:35] in the fall when the man and the woman
[1:06:37] sinned
[1:06:38] and in the and the
[1:06:41] immediate aftermath of sin
[1:06:44] they're fearful and the bible says in
[1:06:47] their eyes were both opened and the eyes
[1:06:49] of them both were open and they knew
[1:06:50] that they were naked and they sowed fig
[1:06:53] leaves together and made themselves
[1:06:55] aprons
[1:06:56] what does brother man teach us that was
[1:06:58] a covering
[1:06:59] it was their own man-made religion in
[1:07:01] one place he called it the fig leaf
[1:07:03] church
[1:07:05] i'm glad that when we were doing logos
[1:07:06] we didn't do the fiddly fig
[1:07:08] besides that's out of out of fashion
[1:07:10] anyways now
[1:07:12] check with magnolia we'll find out what
[1:07:13] the right one is now
[1:07:15] but
[1:07:17] it's it's the enduring symbol of the
[1:07:19] saguaro
[1:07:20] but uh
[1:07:21] brother mike called it a fig leaf church
[1:07:24] and in the
[1:07:26] and the image of them sitting
[1:07:29] they go and find leaves big enough you
[1:07:31] know leaves that have enough substitute
[1:07:33] them big enough to them that they can
[1:07:34] hide themselves and make themselves a
[1:07:36] covering it's religion
[1:07:38] it's their way to deal with sin it's
[1:07:39] their way to cover their nakedness
[1:07:40] that's what church can become that's
[1:07:42] what religion's become that's what
[1:07:43] christianity as a whole has become is
[1:07:46] just a big covering
[1:07:48] and it's possible that the fig tree in
[1:07:50] genesis is that sycamore fig
[1:07:52] because it's very abundant in the middle
[1:07:54] east and it's the only fig tree that has
[1:07:56] leaves large enough really that could be
[1:07:58] sewn together to create some sort of
[1:08:00] covering and i know that there's a lot
[1:08:01] of speculation in that a lot of
[1:08:03] assumptions but i'm just wanting to
[1:08:04] recognize that at least in language it
[1:08:06] was a fig tree that they sewed together
[1:08:08] to hide themselves and zacchaeus climbs
[1:08:11] up in a sycamore fig and tries to hide
[1:08:13] himself from christ camouflage himself
[1:08:17] listen i got just a little bit more to
[1:08:19] go and i really hope that you could
[1:08:20] enter into this brother adam and the
[1:08:21] sermon zacchaeus the businessman he says
[1:08:24] zacchaeus oh zacchaeus
[1:08:26] maybe it isn't rebecca at home
[1:08:30] praying may not be your wife at home
[1:08:32] praying maybe a mother that's done pass
[1:08:34] beyond the veil her prayers are still
[1:08:36] still ain't laying on the altar of god
[1:08:38] he dramatized how that wife was a
[1:08:39] believer she was a christian she was
[1:08:41] longing for her husband to see it he
[1:08:42] says well maybe it's not your wife maybe
[1:08:44] it's somebody else he says if that sows
[1:08:45] that kiss come out from behind those
[1:08:48] sycamore leaves tonight
[1:08:50] what is he saying that we can become
[1:08:52] zacchaeuses who hide behind the sycamore
[1:08:54] leaves he says come out from behind them
[1:08:56] tonight he says that crown that's an
[1:08:58] arborist term
[1:09:00] he's not talking about the crown you
[1:09:01] would wear but the crown of a tree that
[1:09:03] crown of that denominational creed that
[1:09:05] you're holding on to without the new
[1:09:07] birth that's something that you're
[1:09:09] holding on to and you've never had any
[1:09:11] evidence that god was in it
[1:09:13] he knows right where you're sitting why
[1:09:15] don't you do it
[1:09:17] where abraham has identified how it's
[1:09:19] very easy for us to hide behind creed
[1:09:21] and doctrine
[1:09:22] and and the elements of the church to to
[1:09:25] take comfort in its bark that produces
[1:09:27] the figs to take comforts in its leaves
[1:09:29] that provide shade and it's very
[1:09:30] fragrant and there you are in the in the
[1:09:33] tree but you're being lulled to sleep
[1:09:35] hiding behind the sycamore tree leaves
[1:09:38] so it's a place to hide as a church
[1:09:40] member
[1:09:41] you can you have church cover right
[1:09:46] and brother brown and i've been looking
[1:09:48] into the restoration of the bride tree
[1:09:50] whether or not lord would inspire some
[1:09:51] elements on that in our family tree and
[1:09:53] what does he talk about those leaves
[1:09:54] it's leaves of worship
[1:09:56] rejoicing
[1:09:58] and the praising god and those things
[1:10:00] and the gifts and someone could hide
[1:10:02] right behind all that
[1:10:04] use it as their justification use it as
[1:10:06] their cover but there's no life in them
[1:10:08] brother abraham says people said it in
[1:10:10] the churches die in the pew without
[1:10:11] knowing god without receiving the holy
[1:10:13] ghost because they think they'll have to
[1:10:15] give up some of the things of the world
[1:10:17] they'd never belong to church that's
[1:10:18] gotta they'd rather belong to a church
[1:10:20] that's got a higher name or what they
[1:10:22] think a little more prestige
[1:10:26] i want you to ponder this again i'm
[1:10:27] entering this in the into the record i'm
[1:10:29] i'm wanting to consider this from your
[1:10:31] standpoint to make application
[1:10:33] but don't die in the very place that's
[1:10:35] offering you healing and salvation
[1:10:38] as you look at this here here's someone
[1:10:40] who he says there's no life they'd
[1:10:42] rather die in the pew behind the the
[1:10:44] sycamore leaves listen don't commit
[1:10:46] spiritual suicide for your church
[1:10:50] someone should
[1:10:51] you ought never to do that a place
[1:10:52] you're just gonna die brother bam said
[1:10:54] judas hung himself on a sycamore tree
[1:10:57] says in several places talking about
[1:10:58] judas that judas when he hung himself
[1:11:00] hung himself on a sycamore tree he says
[1:11:02] just as much as a cross as the rest of
[1:11:04] them were on
[1:11:06] so christ hung on a cross an ordained
[1:11:08] cross a cross that he willingly gave his
[1:11:10] life up at the hands of the romans at
[1:11:12] the will of the jews and he became the
[1:11:14] sacrifice to purchase our salvation he
[1:11:16] said judas died on the cross but he was
[1:11:19] suiciding
[1:11:20] he hung on a cross of his own shoes and
[1:11:22] he could hung himself on a sycamore tree
[1:11:25] and i'm saying to you let's not be in a
[1:11:27] place where we're willing to commit
[1:11:29] spiritual suicide on a sycamore tree but
[1:11:32] be desperate to know christ
[1:11:36] so as i kind of try to wind this down
[1:11:39] just make an effort
[1:11:41] the sycamore tree can be a place of
[1:11:43] healing or it can be a place of
[1:11:44] hindrance
[1:11:46] it can be a place that can help you or
[1:11:47] it can hang you
[1:11:50] it should be a place where you can climb
[1:11:52] higher to see him
[1:11:54] should be a place where you can rest
[1:11:55] underneath to hear him
[1:11:57] but i would ask does he pass by your
[1:11:59] tree
[1:12:03] if when he does if he does
[1:12:08] do you leave your
[1:12:09] perch
[1:12:10] to respond to him
[1:12:13] in luke chapter 19 verses 5 and 6 when
[1:12:15] jesus came to the place he looked up and
[1:12:17] saw him and said to him zacchaeus make
[1:12:19] haste and come down for today i must
[1:12:21] abide at the house
[1:12:23] and he made a haste and came down and
[1:12:25] received him joyfully
[1:12:28] do you hear his invitation
[1:12:30] are you responding
[1:12:33] are you receiving him joyfully because
[1:12:34] you've got to receive
[1:12:37] i thought about this sitting in the
[1:12:39] church pews dying camouflaging behind
[1:12:41] sycamore leaves and this whole image of
[1:12:43] zacchaeus being up in that tree and he
[1:12:45] could have continued to hide behind that
[1:12:48] tree and been satisfied well i saw him i
[1:12:50] saw him do this i saw this i saw that i
[1:12:52] was there with the throng i did what you
[1:12:54] wanted me to do i went to church i
[1:12:55] observed i paid my tithes i did
[1:12:57] everything i was supposed to do but did
[1:12:58] you respond to him
[1:13:00] did you receive him when he called when
[1:13:02] he said to come down and make haste did
[1:13:04] you receive him joyfully did you did you
[1:13:06] follow his instructions and let him
[1:13:08] abide at that house
[1:13:11] and you could be right around where all
[1:13:13] that's taking place and have this so
[1:13:15] very near you and see it and know it but
[1:13:17] not enter into it and i thought about
[1:13:19] the sermon when brother man preached how
[1:13:20] can i overcome
[1:13:22] and he says i was crossing an old log
[1:13:24] the other day down a wash or what it was
[1:13:25] called a hauler and i jumped upon this
[1:13:27] log on the outside it looked good looked
[1:13:29] like a big old beach log but when i
[1:13:31] jumped on it a great big chunk fell off
[1:13:33] of it it was real rotten and doty i said
[1:13:36] that's the way the christians are
[1:13:37] becoming
[1:13:38] they've been dead and sin and trespasses
[1:13:40] so long till they become doty
[1:13:43] they can hold no weight at all they
[1:13:45] don't know what the overcoming means and
[1:13:47] i begin to think of this text then
[1:13:49] overcome keep life in you
[1:13:51] when life went out that's what brought
[1:13:53] that log to that condition
[1:13:56] and it made it worse than ever when it
[1:13:58] laid in the branch where the water was
[1:14:02] and there you take a christian that's
[1:14:04] supposed to be a christian
[1:14:06] let the life of god go from him and the
[1:14:08] experience the joy of serving christ and
[1:14:10] living in a church where such is going
[1:14:12] on
[1:14:13] what the word being preached or the just
[1:14:15] look at this the joy in the things of
[1:14:17] god right there where the water is he
[1:14:19] rottens twice as quick right living
[1:14:21] right under
[1:14:23] this is the danger you can say oh i'm in
[1:14:25] a great church it's a wonderful church
[1:14:26] this is a great sycamore tree i love
[1:14:27] this sycamore tree
[1:14:29] are you just hiding out
[1:14:31] are you just enjoying the the the
[1:14:33] frappuccinos and the snipers nest what
[1:14:35] are you doing up there
[1:14:37] are are you just happy begging at the
[1:14:39] foot of the tree
[1:14:41] and living as a beggar are you happy to
[1:14:43] live as a critic what is it you're doing
[1:14:45] in that tree because if you aren't
[1:14:47] experiencing the joy of serving christ
[1:14:49] if you're not if you're not entering in
[1:14:52] where the word is being preached and the
[1:14:54] water is flowing he says you're rotten
[1:14:56] twice as quick
[1:14:59] oh you mean that i'm worse off and
[1:15:01] rotting faster being in a by not doing
[1:15:04] my part as someone who leaves yes
[1:15:07] absolutely
[1:15:08] so if we're trying to follow the message
[1:15:10] of the hour at least this part of the
[1:15:11] message we should live constantly in the
[1:15:13] life of christ
[1:15:16] and if it don't you lay around and know
[1:15:18] that these things that you're supposed
[1:15:20] to do and don't do it so it's not just
[1:15:22] about your church experience it's not
[1:15:23] just about your sycamore experience
[1:15:25] the bible said here that note to do good
[1:15:27] and don't and doeth it not to him and
[1:15:29] it's sin then you become dody and rotten
[1:15:31] when you're separated from the life of
[1:15:33] god
[1:15:35] so strive with all that's in you to stay
[1:15:37] in the life of christ that you be
[1:15:39] fruit-bearing
[1:15:41] stay with all that is in you
[1:15:44] to be fruit barrier
[1:15:47] as i close bartimaeus sat
[1:15:52] he sat under that tree
[1:15:59] it was a comfortable place for him
[1:16:02] a place to make a living
[1:16:05] though he did it by begging but one day
[1:16:08] christ passed by
[1:16:11] and he heard the buzz
[1:16:13] he's blind he he recognizes the
[1:16:15] commotion here's different people
[1:16:16] talking
[1:16:17] and brother branham dramatizes it and he
[1:16:19] begins to dramatize how
[1:16:21] bartimaeus begin to hear testimonies
[1:16:25] and it's remarkable this really stood
[1:16:27] out to me
[1:16:29] how when brother branham tells the story
[1:16:32] whether he's using zacchaeus or
[1:16:33] bartimaeus
[1:16:36] but he tells the story and he reverses
[1:16:37] the order
[1:16:39] he does it several times
[1:16:41] instead of bartimaeus being healed first
[1:16:44] he tells the story how that blind
[1:16:46] bartimaeus is setting under this tree or
[1:16:48] he's sitting there by the wayside
[1:16:49] begging
[1:16:50] and he starts asking what's going on
[1:16:52] what's all the commotion jesus of
[1:16:54] nazareth is coming by
[1:16:56] and he starts hearing testimonies and
[1:16:57] one of the people that testifies is
[1:16:59] rebecca zacchaeus's wife says you
[1:17:02] remember zacchaeus little shopkeeper the
[1:17:03] old restaurant owner you remember how he
[1:17:05] was yeah yeah what what about well he he
[1:17:08] got to
[1:17:09] christ stopped right at the base of the
[1:17:11] tree looked up called him by name he
[1:17:13] invited him to ask to come into his home
[1:17:15] he invited himself and he's a changed
[1:17:17] man he actually said if i've done any
[1:17:19] thing wrong i will restore it i will
[1:17:21] restore anything that i've taken and he
[1:17:23] showed this great humility in responding
[1:17:27] whatever has been taken from me i'll
[1:17:28] restore if i've done anything by false
[1:17:29] accusation i'll restore him fourfold and
[1:17:31] now he's a saved person he's following
[1:17:34] christ and he's like oh wow really
[1:17:38] and it really struck me that brother
[1:17:39] brahm does it so often i even paused and
[1:17:41] thought well is there is there a meaning
[1:17:43] to this is there reason
[1:17:45] as you look into the scripture you'll
[1:17:46] find that there really
[1:17:49] is no absolute barrier to there being
[1:17:52] some difference in the order and the
[1:17:53] chronology of it
[1:17:56] but what struck me as i pondered this
[1:17:57] yesterday
[1:17:58] is how that in the scripture the divine
[1:18:01] healing leads to salvation
[1:18:04] and then when brother branham tells it
[1:18:05] in the end time the salvation leads to
[1:18:08] divine healing
[1:18:10] which is an earnest of the resurrection
[1:18:12] which is a type of our body change
[1:18:15] and it puts that sequence perfectly in
[1:18:17] order it almost inverts it to where we
[1:18:19] can begin to see there can be a bait on
[1:18:21] the hook to get us to salvation then
[1:18:23] salvation isn't to isn't just to bring
[1:18:25] us back back back back back but forward
[1:18:27] to the change of our bodies
[1:18:29] so it's unique that brother bannon
[1:18:30] changed the order
[1:18:32] but upon the basis of these testimonies
[1:18:34] and this crying out
[1:18:36] uh these things around verse 36 of
[1:18:38] chapter 18 he says jesus thou son of
[1:18:40] david have mercy on me
[1:18:43] he was destitute he was a beggar
[1:18:45] but not only that he was desperate
[1:18:48] and under that tree that they began to
[1:18:50] cry jesus have mercy on me
[1:18:53] and
[1:18:54] the thought of how he might have been
[1:18:55] there think of how hopeless he was i'll
[1:18:58] never make it to him through the crowd
[1:19:00] i i even if i even if i tried to use a
[1:19:03] lamb to get to him there's no way i
[1:19:04] won't know who he is i don't know his
[1:19:06] voice and i began to get desperate i
[1:19:09] i i want this
[1:19:12] i want this healing and he calls him and
[1:19:14] he's referring to him more
[1:19:16] in this desperate plea jesus
[1:19:19] thou son of david have mercy on me and
[1:19:23] it must have startled everyone nearby
[1:19:25] because they're like hey man be quiet
[1:19:27] you need to relax a little bit take a
[1:19:29] chill pill there's this is no time for
[1:19:31] that he can't hear you you're just
[1:19:32] making a ruckus there's no reason to get
[1:19:34] fanatical why don't you just tone it
[1:19:36] down a little bit and the more he was
[1:19:38] told to be quiet the more desperate he
[1:19:40] got and began to cry out jesus have
[1:19:43] mercy on me perhaps knowing that there's
[1:19:46] no way that he could actually hear him
[1:19:49] but if he could just somehow through
[1:19:51] desperation and effort be like hannah
[1:19:54] was that damn the temple with a painful
[1:19:57] desire with her lips just moving and the
[1:20:00] high priest thinking she was crazy and
[1:20:02] said have your desire that maybe perhaps
[1:20:05] he could stop the son of god
[1:20:09] and he stops him
[1:20:10] somehow supernaturally he touches the
[1:20:12] hem of his garment and christ stops and
[1:20:15] he beckons to him
[1:20:19] and under this sycamore tree you must be
[1:20:21] crying out you must be desperate
[1:20:23] you must want something from him and
[1:20:25] when he cries when he responds you must
[1:20:27] respond
[1:20:29] when he bids you come
[1:20:32] when you sense that pool you give in to
[1:20:34] it
[1:20:36] you got to leave behind your covering
[1:20:37] right leave behind whatever's precious
[1:20:40] come to him so he can say what what what
[1:20:42] do you want me to do
[1:20:43] for you
[1:20:45] now i've run out of time to really give
[1:20:46] this appropriate um
[1:20:49] time
[1:20:50] but the story
[1:20:52] that immediately precedes jesus healing
[1:20:54] bartimaeus
[1:20:56] is the rich young ruler
[1:21:02] he does prophesy of his death but just
[1:21:04] before this this interaction
[1:21:06] and in the story the rich young ruler
[1:21:08] the rich young ruler runs up to him and
[1:21:09] says good master
[1:21:11] this is polite right
[1:21:13] call him teacher good master
[1:21:15] what shall i do
[1:21:17] to inherit eternal life
[1:21:20] still still wanted to know what he could
[1:21:21] do
[1:21:23] raised well kept the commandments very
[1:21:26] wealthy he's a contrast to bartimaeus
[1:21:28] what can i do to inherit eternal life
[1:21:30] what was it that bartimaeus did he just
[1:21:32] ran into him and just responded and
[1:21:33] jesus this is what can i do for you
[1:21:36] if you'll just come to him with the
[1:21:38] right attitude you won't have to ask
[1:21:39] anything he's going to ask you what do
[1:21:41] you want
[1:21:43] and he says i kept all these
[1:21:44] commandments from my youth and
[1:21:45] everything and jesus says you lack one
[1:21:47] thing sell all thou hast
[1:21:49] distribute to the poor
[1:21:51] and thou shalt have treasure in heaven
[1:21:53] and come
[1:21:54] follow me
[1:21:56] i think how remarkable that is because
[1:21:58] just in the next story as he's passing
[1:22:00] through jericho the story of zacchaeus
[1:22:02] he's like hey i'm going to bestow half
[1:22:04] my goods to the poor if i've done
[1:22:05] anything wrong by false accusation i'll
[1:22:07] restore him fourfold in other words i'm
[1:22:09] willing to get rid of everything
[1:22:11] i'm willing to make it right there's a
[1:22:13] reason why these stories are kind of
[1:22:14] clumped together in such beautiful
[1:22:16] comparison but now jesus is saying hey
[1:22:18] sell everything you have follow me and
[1:22:21] when he heard this the rich was very
[1:22:23] sorrowful for he was very rich i know
[1:22:25] some of us would like to be very rich
[1:22:27] but it'll lead to great sorrow as if
[1:22:29] jesus even says it's harder for a rich
[1:22:31] man
[1:22:32] to to have salvation exist for a camel
[1:22:34] to pass through the eye of a needle this
[1:22:36] is a this is a snare this is a danger
[1:22:38] this is a a part that we got to be very
[1:22:40] careful of and it's even symbolic in the
[1:22:42] sycamore tree
[1:22:45] but with zacchaeus excuse me with
[1:22:46] bartimaeus it says in verse 43
[1:22:51] he says what what can i do for you he
[1:22:52] says i want my sight it says immediately
[1:22:55] he received his sight
[1:22:57] and
[1:22:58] followed him
[1:22:59] glorifying god
[1:23:02] and notice what a witness he became and
[1:23:03] all the people when they saw it gave
[1:23:05] praise unto god
[1:23:08] look at how
[1:23:09] willing and ready he was contrary to the
[1:23:12] rich young ruler to embrace christ and
[1:23:14] to follow him
[1:23:16] immediately he received his sight and
[1:23:17] followed him glorifying god and it
[1:23:19] became a great witness to the people
[1:23:24] i'll invite the musicians to come
[1:23:28] again this is my final statement in the
[1:23:30] sermon blind bartimaeus i think this is
[1:23:32] the different one that i've quoted from
[1:23:33] earlier i think there's 14 of these or
[1:23:36] so
[1:23:37] he said while the holy spirit is here
[1:23:39] we'll call the prayer line and pray for
[1:23:40] the sick
[1:23:43] he said everybody get your faith now and
[1:23:45] in your heart and notice how beautiful
[1:23:46] this is you don't have to say it in your
[1:23:48] mouth
[1:23:49] you remember your thoughts are louder
[1:23:51] than heaven than your voice is on earth
[1:23:54] you should say this o jesus
[1:23:56] thou son of david have mercy on me
[1:24:01] could it be possible that bartimaeus
[1:24:03] that day had been sitting there begging
[1:24:04] and not one person paid attention to him
[1:24:07] pleading for help i've just recently
[1:24:09] sacrificed my lamb i don't have a lamb
[1:24:11] anymore
[1:24:12] i need money to buy a lamb and as he
[1:24:14] cries of course people just ignore him
[1:24:15] just passing them by
[1:24:17] we started on the subject last week of
[1:24:19] empathy
[1:24:20] and and being ignored the pain of being
[1:24:22] ignored
[1:24:23] he's thinking about bartimaeus how often
[1:24:25] he might have been ignored how often he
[1:24:26] might have been cast down how often he
[1:24:28] might have been looked down upon
[1:24:31] but he says to us oh jesus we should be
[1:24:33] saying this thou son of david have mercy
[1:24:34] on me
[1:24:36] see if he'll do the same thing he did
[1:24:40] and then he says zacchaeus
[1:24:42] just pull out your fig leaf one time and
[1:24:44] look down
[1:24:45] he brings them both into view again
[1:24:47] right there
[1:24:50] and he says zacchaeus
[1:24:53] bartimaeus cry out thou son of david
[1:24:55] have mercy on me zacchaeus just pull
[1:24:57] your fig leaf one time and look down see
[1:24:59] if he isn't the same yesterday today and
[1:25:01] forever see if he doesn't do the same
[1:25:02] thing
[1:25:03] if you will pull out
[1:25:06] he excuse me
[1:25:07] he will pull you out speak to you
[1:25:11] and the good thing
[1:25:14] he'll go home with you tonight
[1:25:17] isn't that beautiful
[1:25:18] [Music]
[1:25:20] i don't want to just come to the church
[1:25:21] and speak to me through the fig leaves
[1:25:24] and just be happy okay all right yep
[1:25:26] that's good i really like that that's
[1:25:27] good and just stay
[1:25:29] in the in the cover of the fig leaves
[1:25:32] but he says you got to get pulled out
[1:25:35] and the same god that meets you here has
[1:25:37] got to be the god that goes home with
[1:25:38] you he says he'll go home with you
[1:25:40] tonight
[1:25:41] and have a talk with him before you go
[1:25:43] to bed you and your wife
[1:25:46] home
[1:25:47] will
[1:25:48] be changed
[1:25:50] it won't be like it used to be then when
[1:25:52] he goes home with you
[1:25:55] not just
[1:25:57] enjoying a gathering around a sycamore
[1:25:58] tree or underneath the shade of the tree
[1:26:00] or seeing something from the perch of
[1:26:02] its branches
[1:26:03] but you meet them
[1:26:06] and you go home with them
[1:26:08] that's the goal of the shade of the
[1:26:10] sycamore
[1:26:12] that's the reason why god has churches
[1:26:14] scattered throughout the valley churches
[1:26:16] all over the world why it becomes that
[1:26:18] place where he can call to you
[1:26:20] and not the place that well i guess i'm
[1:26:22] going to church to hear from god know a
[1:26:23] place where you've met him and you've
[1:26:25] known him and now he comes home with you
[1:26:28] it's a place of rest
[1:26:30] it's a place of feeding
[1:26:32] but it's a place where something starts
[1:26:34] and begins
[1:26:38] and he says home will be changed it
[1:26:41] won't be like it used to be when he goes
[1:26:44] home with you
[1:26:45] that's my prayer for us as a church
[1:26:47] as that whatever it is that we hear here
[1:26:49] whatever it is we're feeding on if we
[1:26:51] could stay true to the message if we
[1:26:53] could just let the word have preeminence
[1:26:55] if we could lift up the right things and
[1:26:57] you're feeding on that if you're taking
[1:26:59] these things home and you're making them
[1:27:00] applicable and you're letting christ
[1:27:02] have preeminence in your home life we're
[1:27:04] going to be creating the kind of
[1:27:05] atmosphere where zacchaeuses and
[1:27:07] bartimaeuses can hear christ it'll be a
[1:27:10] place where christ is happy to come to
[1:27:12] it'll be a place of healing to be a
[1:27:14] place of salvation it'll be a place to
[1:27:16] where people experience divine healing
[1:27:18] and come to their salvation and then
[1:27:20] begin to look to their translation
[1:27:23] [Music]
[1:27:24] oh let it be for us that it's not just a
[1:27:26] place we get comfortable
[1:27:27] [Music]
[1:27:29] but god i want to be available to you i
[1:27:31] want to
[1:27:32] i want to follow you i want to serve you
[1:27:34] i want to do what's right by you lord
[1:27:37] maybe you could just put that in your
[1:27:38] heart today
[1:27:42] [Music]
[1:27:46] help us lord
[1:27:48] just bow your heads
[1:27:50] i just sense a real sovereignty now
[1:27:52] [Music]
[1:27:55] you know i mentioned it a little while
[1:27:57] ago on
[1:27:59] in this series
[1:28:04] how that brother branham when he
[1:28:06] preached the seals
[1:28:07] [Music]
[1:28:09] at the end of every service he's saying
[1:28:11] i love him
[1:28:14] and he talked about how he purchased
[1:28:16] salvation
[1:28:18] on calvary's tree
[1:28:20] [Music]
[1:28:21] there was never a moment where he
[1:28:23] stopped
[1:28:24] offering salvation
[1:28:27] to the believer
[1:28:31] and i don't want us to ever get to a
[1:28:33] place as a church
[1:28:35] where salvation isn't available
[1:28:38] did you know there's churches that
[1:28:39] preach that the day of mercy's past
[1:28:41] there's no more salvation
[1:28:43] there's no more access
[1:28:45] to christ for deliverance
[1:28:49] i believe that the word is the same
[1:28:51] today as it's ever been
[1:28:54] and that salvation is available
[1:28:57] i've had different parents talk to me
[1:28:58] about how
[1:29:00] their children are desiring to be
[1:29:02] baptized
[1:29:03] i would that they would understand
[1:29:07] that it's not
[1:29:08] a church act
[1:29:11] it's not just something we do because
[1:29:13] it's what the bible says but it's done
[1:29:15] in recognition
[1:29:17] that jesus paid it all
[1:29:20] he purchased my salvation
[1:29:23] he shed his blood on calvary
[1:29:30] let us be conscious of those things in
[1:29:31] our family
[1:29:33] my wife even fellowshipping with me this
[1:29:35] past week is just desirous that we could
[1:29:37] have more conversations with our
[1:29:39] children around the things of god
[1:29:41] [Music]
[1:29:43] i think that would be wonderful
[1:29:44] [Music]
[1:29:46] if our children could be conscious that
[1:29:47] there's a place that you could walk
[1:29:49] in christ
[1:29:53] place of freedom
[1:29:57] it's bower heads in prayer if you need
[1:29:59] something from the lord just lift your
[1:30:01] hand to him
[1:30:02] [Music]
[1:30:11] lord jesus
[1:30:12] in your presence today we ask that you
[1:30:14] would
[1:30:15] hear our humble cry
[1:30:18] lord is very quiet over the building
[1:30:21] but may you hear their heart cry jesus
[1:30:24] thou son of david have mercy on me
[1:30:27] there be any soul that needs salvation
[1:30:30] [Music]
[1:30:31] may they run to you lord may they hear
[1:30:33] your voice beckoning
[1:30:36] whether we use the healing of
[1:30:37] bartimaeus's eyes as a type of salvation
[1:30:40] or whether we use the salvation of
[1:30:42] zacchaeus as a type of our salvation
[1:30:46] may they
[1:30:47] come to you because you bid or may we
[1:30:49] recognize you look up to us in our perch
[1:30:51] and say come down
[1:30:53] and i want to come home with you today
[1:30:56] maybe it's different for someone today
[1:30:58] maybe today they'll just yield to you
[1:31:01] and say lord i accept you
[1:31:03] i i don't know what it means
[1:31:05] but i'm going to cast off my covering
[1:31:07] lord and run to you
[1:31:08] [Music]
[1:31:10] but come down out of my tree and take
[1:31:11] you home with me today
[1:31:13] not be so worried about what we have to
[1:31:15] give up but be more focused on what we
[1:31:16] have to gain
[1:31:19] and lord i pray that this church would
[1:31:20] always be a place where salvation and
[1:31:22] divine healing are believed
[1:31:24] and we're willing to receive
[1:31:27] not a place where we're constantly in a
[1:31:29] state of questioning our salvation and
[1:31:31] constantly in the cycle of re-baptisms
[1:31:34] and constantly revisiting the altar and
[1:31:36] constantly
[1:31:37] trying to get prayed for for the same
[1:31:38] things but lord just have real genuine
[1:31:41] experiences where we meet you in your
[1:31:43] word
[1:31:44] and so we can believe for others
[1:31:47] as a church we're believing for sister
[1:31:48] marguerite lord because we've seen you
[1:31:50] touch our sister sandy so we can pray
[1:31:53] lord on her behalf sister yolini
[1:31:54] testified how you just kept her centered
[1:31:57] during a difficult week lord we hear
[1:31:59] that testimony and so it gives us
[1:32:01] courage to believe for ourselves today
[1:32:04] that you can help us this week
[1:32:07] lord i pray that you have mercy on us oh
[1:32:09] son of david
[1:32:11] have mercy on us
[1:32:14] commit all things to you in the name of
[1:32:16] the lord jesus christ amen
[1:32:18] amen
[1:32:19] [Music]
[1:32:21] praise the lord thank you for your
[1:32:22] patience today
