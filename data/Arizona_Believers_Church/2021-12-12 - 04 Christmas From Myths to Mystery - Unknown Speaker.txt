TRANSCRIPT
========================================
luke chapter one i'm gonna start with verse five luke chapter one verse five and read to verse 17. luke chapter one starting with verse five there was in the days of herod the king of judea a certain priest named zacharias of the course of abeah and notice this telling the story of jesus and it starts with zacharias a priest and his wife was of the daughters of aaron and her name was elizabeth and they were both right just before god walking in all the commandments and ordinance of the lord blameless they had no child because that elizabeth was barren and they both were now well stricken in years it came to pass that while he executed the priest's office before god in the order of his course according to the custom of the priest's office his lot was to burn incense when he went into the temple of the lord and the whole multitude of the people were praying without a time at without at the time of incense and there appeared unto him an angel of the lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense and when zacharias saw him he was troubled and fear fell upon him but the angel said unto him fear not zacharias for thy prayer is heard and thy wife elizabeth shall bear thee a son and thou shalt call his name john thou shall have joy and gladness and many shall rejoice at his birth for he shall be great in the sight of the lord and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink and he shall be filled the holy ghost even from his mother's womb and many of the children of israel shall he turn into the to the lord their god and he shall go before him in the spirit and power of elias to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just to make ready a people prepared for the lord zacharias said unto the angel whereby shall i know this for i am all an old man and my wife real stricken in years and he's continued to read he's stricken uh dumb because of his disbelief let's just pray for a moment here gracious heavenly father we appreciate the time that we have today together as family as your children gathered around a table as it were to feast upon the things that are prepared for us in the word that have been preserved for us things in the bible things from the message of the hour and lord just asking that you come to settle our nerves lord and just comfort our hearts and be with us as we approach this particular subject myself lord just feeling the weight of certain things and just desiring to just be be appropriate lord and be sensitive and i just pray that you'd come in a special way this morning take the things which we have read and bless them in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen you can be seated this is part four of our christmas series that we begin to minister on and i will warn you um that i think i've been doing a lot maybe to whet the appetite for mysteries and um i think sometimes we use that phrase we expect maybe to hear something we haven't heard before but i believe the message was perfect it's complete delivered to us those things that are relevant for us and so in the subject of a mystery your mind might be thinking oh we're gonna something's gonna be some territory is going to be explored that we've never heard of before and if that's what you're expecting then well maybe you'll get what you expect but then also i'd say you might be disappointed because i'm not going to be bringing anything new but i want to start transitioning as we've been preaching on myths i want to transition from myths to mystery so we're still speaking on the subject of christmas and go from myths to mystery i just want to point out a couple things here at the outset in our text how that in luke wanting to tell a very complete story and record of christ and his ministry in his life and he's wanting he could have began as other writers do with the birth of christ but he starts with the birth of john and it's with the birth of john that we begin to read things relating to joy and gladness and rejoicing and it says thou shalt have joy and gladness and many shall rejoice at the birth of john and so this is how he chooses luke is going to choose to introduce the messiah and he appropriately very appropriately begins with introducing the forerunner and i think that's just something i want you to leave with you at the outset and i want to come back to these verses uh later on this morning so i want to just recap some things that we've talked about in christmas myths i'm not going to go back through the first few parts but what we've been looking at is identifying as brother branham put it the real fundamentals of christmas and in looking at the real fundamentals of christmas what you're doing is you're going to separate fact from fiction you're going to find out what is uh what is kind of just the mythology that's developed and what's what's the lore the folklore the legends related to the birth of christ or the season that he was born in and identify the facts if we can there's some situations that we'll find this morning that i uh or will make reference to this morning that you can say well i want to find out exactly when or i want to know this i want to know that and there's a lot of things that god has just hid that we may never know and and even in eternity there's things that maybe mean a lot to us right now but in eternity those completely fade away and you're like man what were those questions i was wanting to ask god doesn't matter anymore and so that's one of the things that we can begin to look at when we talk about myths and now i want to move moving from myths to mystery it's really getting into what's been covered up what's been hit what's been convoluted and on wednesday night i'm so happy to see all of you who are there wednesday night back tonight or today and i'm not inviting you to service this evening but uh back today because we went in a very exhaustive uh tedious maybe maybe a better word in looking at the mythology related to santa claus as one of the myths related to christmas one of the most prominent symbols related to the modern day celebration of christmas uh but we looked at the origins of santa claus and we realized that there's a lot a blend of a lot of different traditions a blending of a lot of different folklore to where when you want to get and find out who is santa claus today it's convoluted because so many things have been added in and you have a real person saint nicholas and then you have another mythological character here and you have one from german tradition you have one from english tradition you have one from nordic tradition and you have different greek mythologies and everything kind of gets bundled up and it's personified in one person we know today is jolly saint nick or santa claus and we recognize there's a lot of mythology a lot of stories a lot of origin stories a lot of different myths related to even that element of our of christmas celebrations today and we spoke about even the mythology and the origins of the christmas tree and uh we realize there's a lot of different narratives as it relates to the christmas tree there's some that uh posit that it's strictly a pagan symbol there's others that say well it really began with very devout german christians in western germany at the time of wanting to honor christ's birth brought in the christmas tree we even realized we could blame martin luther for um kris kringle and the christ child and blame him for the tradition of opening gifts on a christmas morning in front of a tree and he's the one that added light to the tree so if you want to hang somebody for christmas maybe martin luther would be a good place to start but we realize there's a lot of even religious significance attached to the christmas tree but then on the other hand there's still a lot of non-religious symbolism and even cultural symbolism related to it and i thought it was very interesting i'm just sharing this with you um today because i found it very interesting and very intriguing of just how polarizing a symbol can be how many heard about the fox news tree getting burned down they've already caught the suspect so you don't have to be worried about having too much knowledge but the fox news tree was burned down and then i i saw an article on it and this was a i had a couple statements uh that i wanted to point out and this is a i don't know what kind of personality they are with fox news but i believe it's a woman aired heart she said it's a tree that unites us it brings us together it's about the christmas spirit it's about the holiday season it's about jesus this is what fox news believes the tree this is what the tree represents to fox news and this is what they are suggesting it means to all of us is that the tree is about jesus so do you recognize just how much starts getting poured into the tree because even when you go back and you look at different things you'll find well there really wasn't that much significance placed on it it was just a symbol maybe it was used in paradise plays where they're using it as an allegory of the tree in the garden of eden or even the garden of eden itself and things kind of evolve around around it and um and here it's like this really overt very direct the tree is about jesus and this is why there was such umbrage when it was burnt down this was uh oh my goodness this is an affront this is an attack and it was brother tuckel carlson uh who tweeted this and i don't follow him so um i i had to get this through different sources uh he didn't dm me with this but tucker carlson said this a christmas tree is a symbol and i could go with that it's a it is symbolic of a specific culture this builds it's a symbol of a much-loved tradition that's hundreds of years old above all it's a symbol of a religion the world's largest and he's speaking about christianity because he says torching christmas trees is an attack on christianity now i don't know if we ever would have felt that way before fox news put this out there but i imagine there's millions of people today that now view the christmas tree as jesus and that if you burn down a christmas tree it's an attack on christianity itself and i found that very striking very even again it's kind of the rhetoric that polarizes people because you may have some people are kind of like ah well i have a tree because it looks good and all of a sudden they're being told that you have a very overt symbol of christianity in your living room and like well no it doesn't mean that oh yeah oh yeah you're just a closet christian because if jesus christ is sitting all tinseled up in your living room and that's what they've made it and what you once kind of noticed kind of the sensationalism resulting around it and i felt just so extreme and really imbalanced in something that just pushes the needle a little bit further on what the christmas tree is to where now it's a symbol of christ and a symbol of the world's largest religion christianity and by burning a tree in new york i believe it was in new york this was an attack on christianity i guess they're unable to view it as maybe someone not liking fox news they had to attribute this animus to christ himself and i think that's kind of maybe just a common trope that a lot of people like to drag out there um instead of recognizing themselves as being the one that needs to shape up and change their attitude they just say that's just the devil persecuting me because i'm a christian and so i i just mentioned that just to kind of as a kind of like a exercise kind of like a pregame a little bit for where for more today but the true origin story this is kind of just backtracking a little bit on some of the things we've mentioned already the true origin story of christmas celebrations has really been lost largely lost to myths that if you asked anyone where does christmas come from um and you hear the different stories that might be shared you'll find that it combines this element adds this element in and there's a lot of things that kind of come together to where to know the real origin of the celebration of christmas there's so much that's added into it it's kind of hard to distill it down and figure out when did it start and who started it and what was it all about because any any christian connection if there was some christian connection to it if we were able to go back and say oh aha look this church in rural england was celebrating christmas or oh look these germans in the 400s were celebrating christmas and they're devout christians anything that might have been connected with christians in a christian expression has been blended and mixed with culture culture tradition it's been blended in with other religions to where these things get so blended in it's not really that clear what it represents and that's why it's very bold on tucker's part to say this is a symbol of jesus christ in christianity itself because everything just gets muddied over it it's not something that christians alone can truly claim because modern christmas as we celebrate it today the the the things that we identify as being very prominent during this time of year is a product of 1800 years of evolution it's not just something that has always been it's been evolving and joining together and kind of fusing together different things over 1800 years and i think this is something that's obvious but i want to state it the present-day christmas traditions the ones that we even would participate in ourselves even as believers and christians they in themselves are not traditions that honor christ they are just traditions related to a holiday uh the traditions that we do whether it be exchanging gifts or putting up lights or baking christmas cookies or having a christmas tree all these different things that we've seen that we call festive and part of the season are not derived from the bible they're not derived and centered on the word of god we do not find in third corinthians paul expressing to the corinthian church how they ought to celebrate christmas and complimenting the church at ephesus on how well they celebrate christmas and how they had the best uh cookie exchange uh ever and that the trees were always trimmed just right and um and they they're we don't have these kind of instructions in the word of god so the present day christmas traditions that we participate in we're not deriving them from the word of god but what christmas is today and this is what i want to express is the true danger of christmas christmas today is very hedonistic self-indulgent all about self-pleasure and one thing that we are warned of over and over again in the message of the hour is christmas today has become driven by commercialism christmas today brother brandon even makes reference to i think a shop owner talking about how they made all their money on christmas time it's about capitalism it's about commerce it's about economy and that's really what drives christmas like a lot of other days that we celebrate in north america and around the world they are the fiction of hallmark they're the fiction of a commercial entity in order to drive commerce and that's the real danger of the christmas season isn't its origins or even its mythology but what it's become and that's this hedonistic festival that's commercially driven i want to take some time this morning kind of clarifying some things that we made reference to wednesday night on christmas being a secular celebration i just want to view it from a standpoint for a moment that and kind of looking at christmas as a secular holiday and because i want to i want to make this very very clear um and again i don't know if anybody's kind of been anticipating where i'm going with this or if i've emphasized certain things to a certain degree where i've come off as being defensive and i want to make it clear this series is not a defense of christmas i don't know that it needs a defensive modern day christmas celebrations or some defense of christmas and coming to its defense i'm not going to retweet a tucker carlson as this christmas tree been a symbol of christianity in this holiday this this time of year it's about the christmas spirit it's about the holiday season uh that's not what my these series of sermons is about it's not a call it's not even a call or a mandate to celebrate christmas and to make oh well then we ought to be celebrating christmas and the shackles are off and here's our opportunity i'm not doing any of those things but uh so i want you to recognize really what i'd want to do is kind of place christmas more in this uh more benign but potentially caustic place to where maybe in itself i mean there's really nothing wrong with it but you can make it wrong real quick but the ascendancy the the rise of myths really underscore just how secular christmas has become as the myths have gotten more and more intertangled into these things christmas has become more secular and by secular it means living in the world kind of the original use of the word secular was living in the world or not belonging to a religious order so the word in its etymology it means of the world it just means of man and so something was secular saying well that's just secular like going going out and eating lunch is secular right it's not a religious activity and and it's not a we're not going out to lunch today and picking a place because the bible determines where we ought to eat today and the message of the hour says you ought not to do this so you can't go eat pizza you can't go eat indian food and so we're by eating we're doing something that's honoring the lord so that would be a secular activity that makes sense so if it's secular it's just kind of of the world it's uh it's not belonging to religious practice or or it's one if one was secular they wouldn't even be belong to a particular religion and so the word secular is used to define attitudes or activities or eat anything that has no religious or spiritual basis so it's an activity that doesn't have a religious basis it's something that doesn't have a spiritual basis now i'm not i'm not creating a category to make it seem that well some things don't have any any influence and some things in themselves are or there's no spirituality behind her there's no spirit or force behind it just using the word secular it's an activity that has no religious basis it's a it's something or an attitude that doesn't have a religious or spiritual basis you don't like something maybe not for religious reasons maybe not for spiritual reason that's just secular now in 2019 in a gallup poll from 2019 it said that 93 of americans it determined that 93 of americans would celebrate christmas that year so in december of 2019 pre pandemic it said 93 of all americans would celebrate christmas and the next year it said only four it determined they had a poll that showed that less than 50 percent i believe it was 47 percent of americans actually belonged to church first time they had dipped below half a very very striking figure see 93 of americans are celebrating christmas but less than half actually go to church so think about the these statistics and when they polled them of these 93 of americans which celebrate christmas 35 only 35 said they were it was a strongly religious celebration 26 percent said not too religious so this is kind of the attitudes ah it's not too religious 36 percent says it was strongly religious and they found that it was the attitude towards christmas was becoming more and more secular as a matter of fact what was increasing was that how the non-religious were participating more and more in christmas celebrations let's say maybe at one time christmas was something that was attributed to the birth of jesus christ but as more and more things get added to it it becomes less about the birth of christ and more about you know candy canes and snow and cakes and pies and cookies and christmas movies and christmas musics and gift swapping and trees and lights and a lot of things that kind of really grab our attention and as those begin to have the preeminence more non-religious people begin to celebrate it because they didn't feel as if they were celebrating a christian a a christian a festival or something related to christianity and even even when they studied the jews and they asked these questions of the jews and practicing jews they'd find that where they didn't believe that jesus in the birth of jesus christ and they had their celebration of hanukkah they still incorporated a lot of different other elements of the christmas celebration because it was part of the season it was festive and they're seeing a rise of non-religious people secular people celebrating the holiday so this is the conclusion a statement that was made in the poll christmas is growing more secular and has been doing so for decades but anxiety among religious conservatives on this issue like countless others this year has magnified many times over by the force multiplier of the trump campaign and so this was related to the the poll and the campaign of trump and how that christmas was growing is growing more secular but there's a group of people that continue to have increased anxiety over the subject of christmas and it's political forces that begin to drive this narrative and make people more and more sensitive to this subject to christmas and try to make it more and more religious where really the the world is in society at large is making it more and more secular now i i used that statement to underscore this there are very strong currents different currents trying to pull us in opposite directions you could just see from the tweets that we read earlier and the statements earlier and even this conclusion of the gallup poll and how they recognize them among certain uh political segment of those polled that they were much more adamant and strong about christmas and its origins and what it meant and they could see that there was something that was stoking those feelings and causing people to be a little bit more uh and anxious about the time and so there's these forces that are driving things as we could see by the response of fox news and you can see how things are becoming more and more secular but then there's this uh movement to try to make them more and more and more religious than even what was intended so these these strong currents cause wanting to make you either embrace it and defend it or reject it uh to reject its meaning or reject any symbolism related to it i'd say if anything is trying to knock you off balance i read a statement in one book where it said there's two christmases one secular and the other one's sacred and it's very true how this dichotomy begins to take shape where there's uh two christmases there's one that's a secular christmas and there is a there's a sacred christmas or religious christmas or spiritualized uh christmas and the two have been warring against each other for 1800 years and and i think the clarifying statement was made one time it's not a war on christmas a war over christmas because one side wants to make it this and another side wants to make it that and so these things kind of collide and this is kind of the environment we're in now it's becoming more and more secular and i would argue that the holiday that we celebrate now is secular it doesn't really have religious basis it's really not spiritual but people are trying to come behind it and add spiritual significance to certain things and kind of push us one way or push you the other way and that's kind of the climate that i think we should identify the secularism of it and not so much maybe this uh demonic uh you know that the tree is a symbol of satan i don't think it's a symbol of christ either now i want to i want to look at a myth because i think it's a perfect opportunity to kind of segue into um the way brother branham begins to identify the origins and the kind of the color of the christmas celebrations and it's the happy holiday myth and how many of uh aware of a controversy related to happy holidays right anybody heard of it before and so it's kind of the controversy of what canceling christmas there's a war on christmas they're canceling christmas because people begin to use wanted to use the phrase or we're using the phrase holiday happy holidays instead of merry christmas and so there's a narrative that wants to take the phrase happy holidays and turn it into a liberal creation that was intended to take christ out of christmas and so is that not kind of there the story that we heard and there was even the texas women's university actually banned the use of happy holidays because it was wasn't inclusive enough so you can see there's kind of this trend no merry christmas happy holidays no that's still not good let's just go to uh good xmas i don't know what they would go for but this phrase happy holidays is kind of seen as this liberal idea to take christ out of christmas but the phrase has been in wide use since the 1800s here's a couple examples one from 1863 and another one from 1890 and you probably can't read them but since i have the benefit of being on the front row or the frontis row this one on the left i think this one was from the 1863 the philadelphia inquirer maybe it says happy holidays are coming christmas presents presents for old and young and then um on the other side it's happy holidays this one i think was from 1890 and these are there's multiple instances of the use of the phrase happy holidays even in the 1800s so it's not really a recent invention as a matter of fact we all know what holiday comes from right raise your hand if you know what holiday comes from the word holiday is an old english holy day holy moly that's what it means holy day that's exactly what it means so the word itself to say happy holidays is saying good holy day have a good holy day wonderful holy day and it means a consecrated day or religious anniversary and so there's a to say a holy how many of in canada they go on holidays right they don't go on vacation they go on holidays and it's this this uh its origin is from this phrase holy day these days that were set aside for as consecration days when people wouldn't work days of religious ceremonies a days that were consecrated certain religious anniversaries and so there was different holidays during the year we know that we have different holidays of easter and thanksgiving we calm holidays but these are originally the term is holy days and it's kind of taken from the old english a holiday and that's kind of where it comes from holy day is what it refers to now when the term holidays is used during this season historically it was used to refer to this these four weeks or four sunday cycle which would begin at a point so that the ends on christmas eve and sometimes they would extend it out to january 6th for the epiphany but that's what the holidays referred to originally is a four week period four sundays of this season leading up to christmas how many have heard of the advent and this is something that's very prominent i think it's more in catholic tradition and some of the protestant denominations uh a lot of different denominations celebrated and different sects but the advent is a season of the church year that celebrates the birth of christ but then also prepares for his return this is what the advent is and they with respect to that they have advent trees they have advent calendars they have different things to represent uh the advent and it's this four sunday cycle the advent the holy days the holidays it's there in that time where they're celebrating and look and uh and honoring the birth of christ as they lead up to the day that they believed he was born but then it's a time of preparation of his return because they make this symbol symbolic connection between his first coming and the second coming and so it's during this season if you just think about it there's four weeks of celebrating this these holidays and this holiday time it's during the season that a greeting of happy holidays would be religiously appropriate right the advent we have many many days and so it's it's it you come to this time as happy holidays happy holidays and so it would seem and i know this may be a little bit of a stretch uh in terms of trying to drill down and make this um an absolute but you don't go around wishing people happy birthday 25 days before their birthday well some of us do but we say happy birth month or birth week uh we could say curse days maybe happy curse days coming up leading up expecting uh your birthday coming there's uh it's appropriate during this time following thanksgiving leading up that you say happy happy holidays because many different things and significance uh attached to the advent and these different church celebrations and things that this would be a common commemoration of birth and an expectation of his return and so it was an appropriate seasonal greeting of religious people because you would say merry christmas on or very near christmas but during this time you would say happy holidays but as christmas became more and more secular the phrase evolved and even kind of itself became somewhat of used in such a way to say well we can't say merry christmas because it has christ in it but we can say happy holidays because we don't realize it's actually a holy day which would represent you know a date set aside for christian celebration or christmas christian consecration so the phrase happy holidays begins to become more inclusive and i just wanted to give you some examples here from rj reynolds tobacco company how they begin to feature this very prominently in their ads and i think this one's from 1939 and it says happy holidays i think it's in there happy holidays and happy smoking and it's in this kind of the left column here an advertisement of camels it's not so i started looking up at this that i finally i realized what the prank was when you called someone and said you have prince albert in a can and they'd say yes you said well then you better let him out that was kind of like the the prank call kids would do back in the 80s but uh this was prince albert i know his fresh tobacco or something in a can but this is an ad for christmas here's wishing you all the happiest holiday season ever happy holidays and happy smoking and this is kind of the symbolism that's entered into marketing of the holidays and then from 1935 in this one this one is seasons greetings you can see how festive it is but this was the part that really stood out to me of course and i believe it's uh right down in the first column at the very bottom uh it said well i think it's in there somewhere i can't remember where this is at oh it's at the top camels the very look at that i love this of course you'll give him you'll give cigarettes for christmas they're such an acceptable gift of course i hadn't thought about it thank you for i've been struggling as to what in the world i was going to get my wife but now i know prince albert in a can is exactly what she would want and is it in this one they have all the people on the bottom maybe you can zoom in on that if it's okay go back to the other one if you can zoom in on what these people are saying here here's these characters i hope the boys know that a girl always appreciates a gift of camel cigarettes and it's this whole each one and it presents something the everyday all-american woman the everyday all-american man hard-working man christian conservative man is what this is the gift that you can give of course happy holidays happy smoking rj reynolds tobacco says go out and buy cigarettes for christmas and then notice what brother adam says i don't believe i provided this statement but it says and this is something comes up in different places when he's talking about these the holidays she got him a carton of a certain kind of cigarettes he's over here in a conversation she got him a carton of a certain kind of cigarettes and the other one said she got him a fifth of whiskey in a deck of cards now if that ain't given a memorial gift for the birth of the lord jesus christ and that's the way it goes you see it's just a big bunch of tinsel it hasn't got christmas in it at all so you see how it's changed where phrase happy holidays might have been originally intended to represent holy days or the advent or chris christian celebration of the season looking forward uh to the celebration of his birth and also looking forward to the time of his return and this time of preparation of his return and you have all these different symbolisms that are mixed in and i'm not saying that the origins are correct or that they're these celebrations are even right or scriptural but they had some sort of significance with respect to christianity there would have been a season that's honoring the birth of christ looking forward to the return of jesus christ but as commercialism begins to enter the picture they take these phrases and co-opt them so now happy holidays is synonymous with happy smoking and then merry christmas no longer means anything about the birth of christ it's just hey this is the season of giving this is the season of buying this is the festive season this is the time of good share this is the time of jingle bells and santa claus and elves and all these different things and that's what it becomes so there's no apparent contradiction or paradox when a cigarette company says hey merry christmas buy some cigarettes but brother branham begins to identify the contradiction he said this does this doesn't make sense and notice how he says this doesn't have christmas in it at all the buying of cigarettes the buying of whiskey as a memorial for the birth of jesus christ let's call it what it is you're not buying a carton of cigarettes you're not buying a fifth of whiskey you're not buying these different things and all these other gifts to honor the birth of jesus christ you're doing it because it's what everyone else is doing it's the season it's the time and this is where it to me it just beautifully begins to segue into the things that brother branham begin to identify about the dangers of christmas and this use this phrase happy holidays to me really just emphasizes it because satan's tactic this is satan's tactic and i think we've identified this through a number of services even over the last several months and maybe over the last year satan wants to he can't create he can he only can pervert right so satan is not the purveyor of positive messages like he's not somebody that's got some good news he's not somebody that can br bring forth something clean and something pure so what satan one of satan's tactics not being able to create and only be able to pervert one of his tactics is to create a lightning rod something that's going to draw attention uh divert something towards like a lightning rod is meant to attract the attention of the lightning so they can properly divert it through a safe channel satan wants to create a lightning rod in order to divert our attention we have energy we have focus we have drive we have ambition there's things we want to do things we want to accomplish we have a desire to serve god we've got the holy ghost burning inside of us uh whatever it might be our youth or zeal our passion whatever it might be insane wants to somehow distract that so that we channel it towards something else and not put it towards the right things now that that goes for december and then january through november 2. that's any time 365 that satan's tactic to try to create a diversion and what he wants us to do even in the context of christmas is he wants to direct our energy towards a straw man something that doesn't have any life in it something that's not even real something that's just fabricated something that in many instances has no real backing or real truth behind it but it kind of gets propped up and says see this they're telling us to say happy holidays and this is a an attack against christmas why don't you spend the next two hours trying to write a letter to your senator to tell them to bring back merry christmas and put the nativity scene back at the post office and do this and do that and you get all riled up you're like these are just straw man arguments that you typically in a straw man argument and guess what luther is one of the earliest noted people using the phrase once again he just crops up in these things and he talks about the catholic church and these people creating a straw man just to burn it down and that's what happens in an argument you create a fake person a fake argument a fake principle and then you attack it and tear it down ooh see that there really was nothing to it but that's what even the devil's getting us to do we're getting in the fight with something that there's nothing to it and we're trying to tear it down what's happening is we're getting we're directing our energy towards something there's nothing to it it's false it's fake it's empty it's void but yet we're directing our energy towards it notice these four different scriptures in timothy and titus in first timothy chapter 1 verse 4 neither give heed to fables in endless genealogies which minister questions rather than godly edifying which is in faith this this i i realize here i have a typo in my in my notes and so i'm wanting to be sure that i've got i know the scripture will be right it'll be read correctly but i just want to make sure yeah i don't know what i put in here but i know the uh might just have it in here twice so i'm going to start looking off of this in a moment i think i got my notes mixed up here but nick don't give heed to fables and endless genealogies fables if you if you look at that word as far as a fable it's a narrative or a story just a narrative just a story but a fable is typically referring to a fiction or an invention or a falsehood a fable is a legend something spurious a species something that doesn't maybe have any truth to it or any origin or foundation something superstitious this is what a fable is neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies which minister questions rather than the godly edifying which is in faith peter even refers to it as cunningly devised fables they're cunningly devised they're devised for a reason they take things and cherry pick and put things together and create this this monster create this idea create this lord create this mythology and they do it so that it can get our attention maybe one if i can get them to believe it and they get mixed up in this that's gonna hold them back but also just think if you're trying to roll up your sleeves and punch against it and it's just a tar baby it's just something that's going to get you distracted something's going to get you all mixed up it's trying to bait you into a fight he's saying so don't give heed to fables and endless genealogies this and that and he's he says they just minister questions oh i'm going to prove this well i got to prove that oh i got to prove that and you just keep going through and he says it doesn't edify it's not godly edifying which is in faith so he's saying what should we do we should use godly edifying which is in faith faith which is edifying godly edifying he's bringing this contrast between the fables and this edifying he says in first timothy 4 7 but refuse profane and old wives fables and exercise thyself rather undo godliness profane it's a profane it has this meaning a godless myth for re refuse profane fables a godless myth a godless fiction something that's superstitious refuse profane fables it would say don't give heed to them don't argue with them don't try to figure them out don't make them part of your repertoire don't build your life around it don't give heed to them refuse old wives tables something superstitious something without any basis something just sort of narrative that's passed along refuse profane and old wives fables but exercise yourself into god unto godliness what's the next one i have there yeah it's duplicated that okay and titus 1 14 and you can see what's being uh juxtaposed here is the truth which is godliness the truth which is godly edifying in faith versus things that are false are empty then in titus he says not given heed to jewish fables and commandments of men that turn from the truth don't give heed to jewish fables that kind of brings it really close to home and commandments of men that turn from the truth he's referring to here these jewish fables commandments of men we can see these things even today that would exist within christianity that there's church fables there's church tradition there's church legends there's church things that evolved through different uh sects of protestant denominations and through the reformation that became part of religious celebrations and religious beliefs doctrines and theologies and saints and orders and certain things that even the catholic church later on goes oops let's dig up their bones let's make them a saint and so there's like this cross-section of all these things being added together this is instructive to us to not give heed to church fables i'll just say it don't give heat to conservative fables don't give heat to political fables liberal fables don't give heed to him because a fable means there's no truth in it it's something that there's nothing to it it's empty and this is what when i refer to how christmas has become secular if there was any truth to it it's stripped out of it and we know there is a truth to it if there was a real meaning or spirit behind it it's been stripped out of it so that now it's it's void of any real religious significance it's void of any real spiritual significance it's void of any real undergirding of truth and sanctification and any kind of ceremony that would make it the real honor of the birth of christ and so now what it's become is christmas has become part of the fables and the fiction that we live with every day and the connection that brother brennan makes most often is the christmas the connection of christmas to paganism and and i think this is going to be it's very obvious to us because it's the maybe the what we hear most often mentioned about christmases it's pagan it's pagans pagan and so for the the connections of christmas to paganism paganism scripturally refers to idol worship paganism scripturally more in a more broad sense would refer to false religions so if there's use of paganism or heathen religions i like to say heather and i'm going to get myself on that that slide again and maybe not be able to get back but heathen traditions and it would refer to or uh false religions as maybe the word that would be used but it's really something oh let me just read this scripture because in the scripture an idol is something with nothing first corinthians chapter 10 verse 14 an idol even the word in the etymology in the hebrew an idol means nothing it's worthless there's nothing to it and so paul instructs the corinthian church wherefore my deliver my dearly beloved flee from idolatry flee from the worship of things that are empty flee from the consecrating ourselves and giving ourselves over to the things that are worthless flee from adultery the worship of things that are false as we mentioned before idolatry can be defined as anything that strays from the word into worship whether it be worship or just a belief or conviction but it's typically associated with with worship and so the word pagan in more modern parlance maybe our vocabulary when we speak of pagan it would be used to define someone who's not a jew christian or muslim and that's the real strict use of the word pagan is someone who's not a christian not a jew or a muslim or maybe more particularly in our use is be something that is non-christian sometimes it's not based on the principles of jesus christ it doesn't draw from maybe uh uh the bible and so we could say pagan on a broadway as well if you're not a jew a muslim or a christian then you're pagan even though you may be religious even though you may not be religious you may not even worship false idol but if you're not in one of these major christian a christian jew or muslim then you're considered a pagan even if you don't believe in any deity at all and you'll find that when it comes to paganism paganism is identified as in its genesis as beginning at the tower of babel in babylon and balaam and different these different elements that we can see from babel and nimrod that's where paganism began so paganism is closely associated with babylon and currently there's many many pagan influence traditions that kind of clutter our seasonal celebrations a lot of pagan uh influenced traditions oh this isn't pagan influence well you know it might have started out non-pagan but pagans always up to something co-opted right and so now a happy holidays happy smoking and things get covered up and things get twisted and things kind of take on a different meaning and so there's a lot of real genuine things that have a genuine pagan origin that kind of muddy up this christmas time and these seasonal celebrations and even historically if you want to even go back before christmas begin to be celebrated there's a lot of pagan asso traditions associated with this time of year winter festivals and and winter gods and gods of uh uh of seasons and certain images and idols that are related to this time of year so if there's things that are related to this time of year there's a way that they kind of begin entering into the picture old man winter and these different things of yule time and a lot of different elements and if you go back even further and and i'm leading to something here so just stay with me there are specific customs of non-christian cultures you can say pagan cultures that predate christ that are part of our modern day celebrations there's a lot of uh pagan non-christian cultures uh different customs that predate the celebration of christmas that are somehow part of now the celebration of christmas and this is how brother bradham summarize i feel he uses a statement to refer to christianity in general that it's what it's become but he uses this phrase babylonian paganism wrapped up in christian terminology notice this phrase babylonian paganism wrapped up in christian terminology in a lot of ways there's a lot of babylonian paganism wrapped up in christmas terminology there's a merging of heathen worship with christian things and here's a here's a number of statements connecting present day christmas celebrations to paganism i'm going to rattle off about seven different statements here uh because i want you just to see how brother banham goes down this track and identifies it he called the celebration of christmas pagan devil worship and another place he called it a pagan superstition elsewhere he said christmas is no more worship it's a celebration drinking gambling carousing just pagan to the limit he says they've just paganized it and paganized it until it's all become pagan so notice there's a paganizing of it even in the language that he's using uh that we see now it's become all pagan but there's something that has been paganized it's a great commercial day of celebration paganized paganist become pagan it's a great commercial day of celebration how a christmas tree has anything to do with the birth of christ it's pagan friends we've got off the path somewhere again in a few weeks or even right now there's reindeers and santa clauses and jingle bells and all kinds of things hanging up which is pagan ceremony it's an article of the catholic church so there's where he identifies paganism people paying great prices and swapping presents and things like that pagan notice where he's putting this thing's starting to get a little bit tighter now i mean we're all feeling very free and we're regretting that we didn't wear a candy cane tie today and then we start reading these things about pagan ceremony pagan superstition and it's all pagan pagan to the limit he says and still worship christmas now it's santa claus oh mercy still more pagan festivals added to it and so they're still trying to worship christmas but now it's santa claus and they're still adding more and more pagan things to it and then the last one we find at this christmas time with all tinsel of christmas the santa claus light the pagan traits and things dropped into both catholic and protestant churches and just as corrupt as it can be this is brother branham recognizing or i say recognizing but identifying and highlighting that there's a lot of paganism that relates to modern day christmas celebrations and what is it it's things that are non-christian things that are non-biblical things that do not relate to things that have no spiritual basis things that don't have any spirituality to it and behind it he starts roping it into certain elements of babylon which is devil worship he calls it devil worship that's a very strong phrase to talk about the celebration of christian christmas is pagan devil worship these are very very very strong statements and the one place that brother branham identified that these pagan symbols unite with christian symbols and these things begin to mix he focuses often on the date of december 25th and i know you you're familiar with these things and i want to start transitioning now looking at the specific date these things kind of begin to collide december 25th there's a lot of pagan ceremonies and customs prior to invented later as a response to christmas celebrations and then christian traditions begin to mix in and then you even see where uh constantine began to encourage the blending of different festivals and christian things and now as they begin to mix it creates a lightning rod for criticism it creates a lightning rod or an alternative counterculture for celebrating and it can get us caught up in this idea that christmas is being co-opted this is a war on christmas and we don't want to get knocked off balance but when it comes to the exact date of christ's birth we mentioned before and i'm coming back to these things the bible and the very earliest christian writers paul irenaeus and different ones never gave a specific date to the birth of christ isn't that interesting they never said yep he was born on this day he was born on that day and it seems that they being very familiar with the times and the events would have been able to affix at least some season to it and say well he was born in the first quarter he's born in the last quarter one some and i'm talking about of the year like fiscal quarters and financial statements not football or basketball but he's born in some some segment of time and be able to identify during some season even related to some feasts while he's born during this feast or he's born near that feast but these things are not emphasized in the bible nor is it even emphasized in the very earliest writers of the christian church but the earliest writing they can find is around 200 a.d clement of alexandria he was an egyptian he's from egyptia egypt and he wrote something that was kind of called miscellaneous it's called the stromatius and it just means miscellaneous musings i guess and it's the early earliest known writing that actually refers to very specific dates and what he's trying to do is very uh interesting he's trying to count the number of days basically or a number of years from adam to christ and to the end of the world he's using all these complex arguments and different things and so he's referring to this very specific time period that from the death of christ to the death of this other person or the uh that this was so many days or so many years and so people take that reference because he's trying to tell the whole story of everything the whole universe and give day give dates and times they take from that and they back out of that one statement november 17th and january 6. how they do it is very weird but they do it they come up with it and someone says no it's this thing go well you didn't count for the leap years and you didn't count for this and you didn't translate that right and they all get this big fight over really what uh clement was talking about and who how did he know that people in this day and age would be debating his calculation or just these number of days he threw out there but then he makes this statement and there are those who have determined not only the year of our lord's birth but also the day now one thing he was highlighting emphasizing is when he died the passion of christ he gives very specific dates to that but mixed into this he says there's those who have determined not only the year but the day and he gives these different dates of and he uses the egyptian month and day which would uh you you then have to convert to the julian calendar and he gives the dates of may 20th april 19th or april 20th and when i was looking at myself just fact checking i looked at it and it was like it showed april 16th and i was like i knew it i knew it and then i was looking at the wrong day but it's april 19th and april 20th are these dates that and him being in 200 a.d he's saying there's many people so this is the narrative that exists within the christian church and this guy was a very devout christian very student of the word and these are the early this is the early church uh and they're trying to know more about christ and share these things and pouring through the bible in the writings and digesting everything that they could and this is the narrative that exists broadly because he was well traveled that christ was born on may 20th or christ others that say he was born on april 19th or april 20th and then there's others that were associated with him that also wrote and referred to him and they have these writings they can go and they have these these manuscripts it's very very fascinating to go back and find how they've preserved some of these things and where they're located but he had contemporaries those that were identified as not students of his but associates that also in their writings would affix a date of christ's death and many of them said that christ died on march 25th and that was the date that they affixed his death to and and then this is this is in the original and um and i actually i don't know if i should admit to this but i actually found the original greek in the original latin and i used google translate to translate what was actually being said going back to the original text in the original manuscript because i wanted to know exactly what was being said and not what was being said later because what happened with these manuscripts is later the translators when someone said in the year of when the christ was born in bethlehem it was so many years later until his death in his passion in the year in the 15th year the reign of tiberias so they make reference to something but then the later on the translator is going in the year of his birth in bethlehem which was on january 6 or which was eight days after december 25th they went in and added it later and they started adding this is people who aren't being honest with it they're not uh uh they're not using uh they're not saying well let's just convey what was being said they want to say what they think it meant and so they begin to translators and these scholars begin to insert december 25th into the translated date but you don't have a lot of men you don't have anybody really saying yep even those early 200s 300s you don't have any of these early church writers saying yep it was on this day until the catholic church begins to get involved and then the proclamations are beginning to me this is when it is made that this day should be and this day is uh the date when christ was born and so there's really a lot of uh fables related to the date december 25th there's a lot of fables but then there's also some interesting facts that people try to bring into it i want to i'm going to do this as an exercise if we haven't had enough already i apologize but there i want to look at some scriptural clues that are used to piece together a date of birth not necessarily a year so much even though there's some debate on that when did herod die was it this year was it that year and there's always a debate as to where it might be but there's different scriptural clues let's look at luke chapter one and i'm just going to pull from this a few verses that we read already because many used the birth of john luke uses the birth of john to set up the birth of jesus christ but many many scholars many theologians many researchers use the birth of john because there's details given to the birth of john that people can use to say kind of back into when christ was born and i'm gonna just use this exercise to make a point i'm not trying to say thus saith the lord or this is actually what it is but just notice this scriptural exercise in luke chapter one verse five there was in the days of herod the king of judea a certain priest named zacharias of the course of abia and his wife was of the daughters of aaron and her name was elizabeth so this scripture is telling us that zacharias was part of a particular order of the priest the priesthood he was of the course or the division of abia and then it gives us this detail in verse 8 and it came to pass that why he was he executed the priest's office before god in the order of his course so there was an order that his course the course of abia would have been there at the temple serving in the temple so this place is zechariah in the temple according to a certain order and a certain um process according to the custom of the priest's office his law was to burn incense when he went into the temple of the lord that's in first chronicles chapter 24 i believe that lists 24 different divisions of the priest and scripturally and even historically these divisions of priests were instituted so that it wasn't just always a group of men that always served in the temple but they rotated they had shifts and they rotated their temple service and so the bible tells us that zacharias was the priest after the order of of abeah and you might when you read it in chronicles you might when you anglicize it say abhija but it's the eighth order and these orders each serve twice a year now i know i already lost you at the rj reynolds uh you know slide but just stay with me i know this is very very dry and we may be losing people around christmas time which would be a shame but just stay with me this is very i think this is important it's a good exercise so we can scripturally determine that there were priests that served at different intervals this is like a word problem that you dread right and zacharias was part of the eighth interval the eighth order that served twice a year and so luke 1 tells us this is very striking luke 1 tells us despite the ebbs and flows of the priesthood luke 1 tells us that the system was in place and that they were actually honoring the system in the second temple they were back they were serving and so the priest would serve once uh served for one week twice a year 24 divisions rotating one two three four and then starting all over again and so they had these divisions that went uh served back and forth so if you could look at a schedule and say well if you work three days you're number one and you work three days then number two works three days and you can lay out the schedule now what's interesting as there's very very good this is the method that's used there's very very good historical records that can tell us which division was serving on a particular day and i think josephus does it the talmud does it there's a lot of different rabbitical traditions and writings that indicate which priest division was serving when jerusalem was sieged when titus besieged jerusalem and there's some maybe some scholars scholarship related to the ex date 70 a.d 69 a.d there's different dates that are given but they know that's just like the moving year a d and b c can move but the events don't change in their and their distance from one another but they usually say oh well yahori was serving in the temple and it has a very unique scriptural significance to to prior invasions but now when the temple fell they know for a fact that this division was serving in what week it was and when their service was ending so you can actually and it's a others have done it for us so we don't have to do it but i got 80 slides i want to show you the work they back into all right if they were serving on that day and they're this order then this order was serving for a week this order was serving for a week and they do the math and they show the work and they come to where they identify that it was on august 4th that the siege the siege of the temple and they begin to work backwards so they can find out what time of year that zacharias may have been working narrow it down to the week and the time of year so now notice this in luke chapter 1 verse 23 verse to 27. luke chapter 1 verses 23 to 27 and it came to pass that as soon as the days of his administration were accomplished so this is he had a week to serve his days are over he departed to his own house according to the custom at the time he would have kept to himself and not had any uh he would have waited for a purification for sanctification and so the days of administration were accomplished he departed to his own house and after those days his wife elizabeth conceived and hid herself five months saying the lord hath dealt with me in the days when he looked on me to take away my reproach among men so we can affix a date of john's conception to the time after zechariah served in the temple and he comes home and sometime soon after zechariah comes home and they can fix it to a time of purification where he would have been set aside and not been with his wife that this is the time that she would have conceived and so there's actually a way to back into a date of john's conception isn't that interesting just saying this is a method this is a process that people use but then notice how extraordinary this is verse 26 and in the sixth month the angel gabriel was sent from god under a city of galilee named nazareth so in the sixth month of her pregnancy the angel gabriel appears and who does he come to in verse 27 to a virgin espoused to a man whose name was joseph of the house of david and the virgin's name was mary thinking catholicism they called the annunciation the conception the proclamation the announcing of the birth and that at this time the holy ghost was going to overshadow it very near to this time and this this date has very strong significance amongst catholics it's a very strong significance because you know it begins to revolve more around mary to even i think now the immaculate conception is mary's birth not even the birth of christ so there's a lot of lore and mythology related to mary here but notice the bible lays this out zacharias gets off of work one week comes home and sometime within the next couple weeks or so his wife conceives and then we have a date where the holy ghost is going to overshadow mary and then mary is going to be is going to conceive and now this is something that i found very very interesting what the catholic tradition does or the church did is they swapped the date of his birth for the date of conception and they took his they took what would have been his date of birth and they swapped it as the date of conception so you count forward from what they believe to be the date of conception he account for nine months guess what magically happens he's born on around december 25th because they take anything that would indicate when he was born and they say no that's when he was conceived because they put the miraculous they put the they put the uh the focus on mary conceiving and so this is what the church has done they've actually swapped things around and then that's what stays and begins to stick it's part of how that mythology develops but many scholars then taking these intervals of when the priests would serve being able to identify when zacharias would have been serving in year one two three or four bc or even one two three or four a.d they're very very tightly close together many scholars and i'm so i'm not just sharing my opinion because i did the math i'm just showing you a method many scholars estimate that john was born in late september based upon his date of service they say that he was born in late september and it says in luke chapter 1 verse 36 and behold this is mary coming to uh this is what the angel says uh to mary and behold thy cousin elizabeth she have also conceived a son in her old age this is what the angel is telling mary at this time and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren so the bible's telling us very clearly that if john was born on a particular month you can go back and find that there's a six month difference from the time that elizabeth conceived and about the time that mary would conceive even the bible tells us that mary went to visit elizabeth and she carried with her three months and it would have and the dates worked perfectly if she's six months pregnant and then mary goes and visits her and is there about this the language suggests she's there about three months leaves just prior to birth which would have made sense as far as her not being defiled and and participating in the birth and different things mary leaves the scene the child john is born and based upon a particular interval of when john would serve or when zacharias would serve it's easy to kind of back into the date that john was born in september and if mary conceived six months later then jesus was likely born in march or april if she was conceived six months later then elizabeth trust me the math checks out i did it by hand even it's all right six months this date that date and they find that this is when jesus was likely born if john was born in september six months later late september six months later gets you in march or april and this is one way that you can begin to identify that maybe christ wasn't born if we use scriptural clues on december 25th but just change the date of zechariah's service to the other interval right because we don't know right we're not sure which one it is but he changed it to the later rotation then elizabeth conceives in late september john is born in june at the summer solstice and guess what jesus was born in the winter between december 21st and december 27th at the at the at the winter solstice just change just swap the dates of service so as soon as you thought you had it figured out right no it was the second rotation that that the scripture is referring to and i and i i want to make this note really not all the justifications for christmas being on december 25th are pagan there's a lot of scholarship there's a lot of study there's a lot of um piecing together scriptures and narratives and birthdays and ceremonies and emperors and caesars and uh feast days and there's a lot of research trying to in this sincerity we got we need to know the date we need to know the date we need another day how can we figure it out and then things begin to get defend you get locked into a position no there's a there's a real strong sect of people that believe that christ was born on september 11th and i'm thinking yeah that makes a lot of sense now right because they say that's the reason why the muslims bombed the world trade center twice on the same date and and that's the reason why this was used in different times because it's so special to the birth of christ september 11th and it has some sort of symmetry with the jewish traditions but notice it's this argument these things you say well brother and that's what you've been doing for three services all right i get it i'm transitioning i'm getting out of this but not all the justifications for december 25th being the birth of christ are derived from paganism some of it's just scholarship and research trying to figure out when christ was born but this is the point god has almost intentionally allowed the date to be shrouded in mystery for a reason it's almost as if he has allowed it to be so inconclusive where you can't definitively nail it down to where you're not going to make a mistake of just idolizing any one particular day and then building all of your theology around it because there's some people that say no christ had to be born on this day and therefore this is where he was when this happened this is where he was in that ham then this this has to be wrong because that can't be true and they start rearranging pieces and then they re-modify the entire bible in order to make it fit around this critical date that christ came that's a very critical event but the date begins to become preeminent and we believe in we know this and my wife explained this to me yesterday she said all we need is is you say hey all we need to know is what brother branham taught to know to have it like so this in other words this could have been covered in one quote three weeks ago but we know the truth is that christ wasn't born on december 25th jesus christ wasn't born in the winter and we believe that by faith perhaps having been taught in the different things that we see in the scripture we realize there's the things that we are pointed to the things that are identified we have this conviction and believe that christ was not born in december he was not born in the winter but he would have been born in the springtime in luke chapter 2 verses 7 and 8 it says and she brought forth their firstborn son and wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid him in a manger because there was no room for them in the end now we can piggybacking off of whenever christ john was born in the service of zacharias there's those that can feel very confident in a fixing a date in april or march as to the time of his birth and that this uh this is when he's born and then this scripture kind of seals it in for him and there were in the same country shepherds and notice these clues abiding in the field which wouldn't be odd but notice this keeping watch over their flock by night and so it's this scripture that begins to kind of ease in and begins to identify this time where it's pointing to the springtime a time when shepherds would not be corralling the sheep during the winter and put him in some enclosure but it'd be a time when even at night they can be out by night with the flocks it's in this springtime where they're identifying the time when lambs would be born this is the season this is the time of christ's birth and almost as if just to kind of throw us off that time was from march to the end of september in october so once again maybe you're not able just to drill it down but we know we're taught that there's significance to the time that christ was born and this is where i've run out of time and so i'm just going to move from myths to mystery and leave it a mystery maybe when i'm one i'm identifying but the birth of christ relates to the purpose of christ right this just isn't a child that was born and a a you know a man born of a woman is a few days and full of sorrow life is but a vapor it's not just it's appointed under men wants to die and then judgment jesus doesn't fit that mold his birth had a particular character his birth is associated with the character his birth is associated with his purpose and this is where to me i want to really begin to identify the true purpose of christmas what we're honoring is in his birth it's so closely associated with other things it's inseparable from it you can't isolate his birth and it's almost as if the scriptures say no we're not going to let you isolate the birth now i'm kind of getting into it a little bit and i don't mean to but i want just to put these things out there notice what paul points to he says i preached christ in him crucified he pointed to christ crucified not christ born not christ's birth or something that becomes a part of the message of jesus christ that's inseparable from him but the mythology only focuses on one part the mythology of this season of this time it leaves it focuses only on the aspect of his birth it leaves out his life it leaves out his death it leaves out his burial it leaves out his resurrection everything is distilled down to this this idea of this poor child laying in a manger and the cold snowy bethlehem and that's the mythology trying to take something and divide it down and zero in on just one element when you can't separate the rest from it because god is intentional even with this timing and the timing of the birth of christ as we believe it to be in the springtime it connects with this purpose and this is where you begin to move from just all the mythology of december 25th and all the mythology of pagan celebrations in the winter time and how we swap the date of conception for the the date of birth and we try to get all these dates to match up just look at what he was born for look at what his purpose was and he began to move from mythology to mystery i mentioned it before the new testament in no place doesn't mention the exact date of birth of christ or more particularly the celebration of it there's nowhere in the bible the anniversary of his of his birth is commemorated as mentioned earlier maybe today and even a couple weeks ago the earliest christian writings do not mention the celebration of christ's birth at all it wasn't a part of it what they did talk about is his death well some of them did mention is the date that he died but you don't find them putting down this hard date of his birth the scriptures in the old testament point forward to his birth then once he's born there's no new testament scriptures pointing back to a commemoration or anniversary or celebration of it but there is something and i notice this let's look at the statement as soon as we would see jesus i'm going to end with these these statements three statements sir as we would see jesus look notice how the bible's not pointing it now notice the attitude of jesus christ himself now jesus never said now he's going to bring them to bethlehem jesus never said i'm going to bring you to bethlehem jesus never said to the greeks when they come up because this is sirs we would see jesus they wanted to see him now just a moment if you want to see it i'll take you back to bethlehem where i was born and i'll tell you how it happened back there this is he's using a very beautiful scripture a unique uh exchange and using this as this christmas text this is on december 24th serves we would see jesus and he's using this as an example that they wanted to see christ he didn't point them to bethlehem he said come with me let me tell you about my birth let me tell you where i was born let me tell you when i was born he says it wasn't that this is so beautiful he pointed them to a future place if they wanted to know him if you wanted to know him you had to know where he was going to be revealed if you wanted to know him you had to know the man in which he was going to be made known if you want to know me in other words i won't take you back and tell you when i was born to bethlehem and all about that not one time did he point any person to any creed any denomination or to his birth or even to christmas not one time did he ever do it so even the emphasis of christ was not to point back to bethlehem not to point back to the time of his birth and not to point back that something could be commemorated and fellowshipped around but he knew that he always was unfolding and revealing himself so he had to point to a future place if you're gonna know me you have to be where i'm being revealed in the prophecy for your season and the prophecy for your time you have to catch me in the moment that i'm expressing myself to the shepherds in luke chapter 2 that's where they found him as a baby in the manger but that's not where you found him then and that where he was then before the greeks is not where they would find him in revelation in a personal relationship christ even in the way that brother branstad he pointed them to a future place they went to him christ was not pointing to bethlehem he's pointing to a mystery all this debate we have on a missing birth certificate and even jesus christ doesn't have one so obama-like think about this here's she brought forth her first born son wrapped in swan and clothes laid him in a major and think about just what a sublime mystery is expressed in that and all the events that start will lead up to all the events that begin to cascade in the whole world and all of judea and all the jews and even those shepherds were expecting the lion they get a little lamb and it's it's even to it's even to them that would have had no mythology because think about the jews were the only non-pagans right the jews were the only non-heathens everyone else was a gentile everyone else was a pagan everyone else was idol worship no one else worshiped the one true god they were the only ones that had it right and they would have been the ones that would have known the signs and the seasons and what was prophesied and they would have understood even the symbolisms and the date different dates and births of the patriarchs it seems as if they would have known exactly what was going to happen and what would come to be they would have been the ones that would have been expecting in waiting but yet when he came he came in such a mysterious way that they missed it and i want to say this it's amazing that it's i i want to preserve some of this but it's just so important to see this it's amazing how easy it is for some people to go back to that think about it really easy to worship a baby wrapped in swallowing clothes in a manger isn't it a baby can't tell me what to do so sweet so innocent they can worship a baby jesus laying in the manger but christ wasn't pointing them to that again in sirs we would see jesus notice this as we're going to close on these two statements i want to thank you for your patience i i know if anything what you've done is you've been very patient with me is i've worked out something maybe for myself and if that's all it was i i guess i could apologize but i just say thank you for bearing with me it was important as a burden i had to look into these things i had to identify these things i felt god driving me to mention these things and get them into the conversation and let them be a part of our fellowship and let us be honest about them and and kind of put it all on the table different people use it for different reasons and i know there's some of you but hey you know what let's just wait till the new year is over and we'll come back to church so that we don't have to worry about all this and then today i'm going to preach on valentine's day no um there's just different things that i felt really impressed my heart that the holy spirit wanted me to address and i thank you for your patience i know you've been very very patient and kind very very gracious to me and now just listen to what brother batman has to say about this because i feel like in some ways i'm just wanting to close the door on the mythology and focus on what we can going forward on same details same scriptures same elements different things but how they relate to these things that brother branham begins to identify but notice what he says in service we would see jesus this is at the very beginning i think page two paragraph six i do not believe jesus would care what day you worshipped his birthday on if it was the 25th 26th or whether it's april may june july or whenever it might be i do not think jesus would care what day you worshipped his birthday on 25th 26th whatever april may june july august you name it he's saying it doesn't matter he says just he says and notice this is so beautiful just so you worship him on any day now notice when you read that maybe you can read it two different ways he doesn't believe that jesus would care what day you would worship him so that you would just worship him on any day in other words he doesn't want it just to be on march 25th that you worship his birthday because that's carving out a piece that's separating out a component that's becoming hyper focused on one particular element that if you drill down on too much and get very very defensive of it you begin to try to bolster your conviction with other things that begin to cloud the picture and you have to carve out a lot of other stuff and you no longer have christ you have the christ child in a manger that you're worshiping he says just so that you would worship him on any day jesus wouldn't want you just to fix one particular day to his date of birth so that you worshipped him on that day he says but here's what it is they've taken the sacredness from christmas to make it not a christmas if anything maybe happy holidays is more appropriate those are my words if someone's just listening this is not part of the quote he says they've taken a sacredness from christmas to make it not a christmas but a worship day not a worship day maybe but a celebration you hear people saying we're going to celebrate christmas that's wrong brother aaron i thought you said brother brandt told us not to celebrate christmas or didn't tell us not to do it he's just saying it's wrong to celebrate but in this way we should never celebrate christmas christmas is a day of worship not a celebration what perspective in what it's become and what it would have originally been or even if at all if we would have recognized some day that we believed christ was born there'd be some respect for it there'd be some honoring some activity some service some some in our hearts contemplation just as others do the jews do around certain feast days just as we do on on the resurrection uh the annual commemoration of the resurrection it's a day of worship and in recognition that on this day christ raised from the dead and there's certain things that are supposed to be reverential but what did it become it's become flowers on the altar it's become pastels and the easter bunny and easter eggs and painted eggs and all these different things and it's losing its meaning though it stayed on the same date and he's identifying the same thing we should never celebrate christmas but we should worship it should be a time of worship not just because a baby was born but what it represented and then this one musicians if you could please come in the message god's gifts always find their places he says christianity was accepted in their way in rome then they said even prior statements are saying that there came a time when christianity was embraced and it's kind of in rome and it begins to accept be expect expect accepted accepted received in pagan rome and now it becomes this blending right of the government with this ecclesiastical power with government power it says then they said we'll make the same celebration and make the son of god's birthday the sun god s you in god jupiter's birthday the son of god's birthday the 25th of december and then this statement but what difference does it make even if that's true what difference does it make but what difference does it make even if they was doing it in july or august or whenever it might be it's still the sacredness of remembering that god gave us the hope that we have in us and now you say well the rest of them is all santa claus and going on like they do why we just might as well do it no sir no this is not a pagan celebration to us this is a sacred hour so that's what really christmas means to us it's not a pagan celebration if you're participating in secular traditions just remember this it's the tree is not a symbol of jesus christ he has not gained more preeminence in your family life by putting up a tree the token has not been applied by erecting a christmas tree and decorating it all these secular traditions we could call them pagan things that have been blended into it i don't mean to change the language but i really want to identify that as things have become secularized it's something else something different altogether but at the same time in these moments he's saying there should be something sacred to us there is a sacred christmas deal there's a secular christmas and there's a sacred christmas as he said it's not even a christmas at all he says they've taken christmas out of christmas he's using this language say it's changed it's not the way it used to be they've completely taken out of it [Music] he said we try to make so much about this day he says i don't know that jesus would even care jesus would even care what day it was because it would just be some day that you would worship him on that's not the focus and he says what difference does it make december 25th or july 8th or august 15th or whatever it might be what difference does it makes that make if this is the time then it's something sacred if this is the time we're remembering it he says and he makes this beautiful statement if there'd been no christmas there'd be no resurrection there'd been no christmas there'd been no love there'd been no peace there'd be no hereafter for the believer if there'd been no christmas christmas was just the start the birth of a baby in a manger was the beginning of something that cannot just be satisfactorily summed up [Music] all tied wrapped up with a bow on it say here it is the neat beautiful christmas package year one or one bc september 11th or december 25th in 3ad or however you'd want to put it it's not something you're going to be able to just wrap up real neat and tidy and pretty and say this is the date what because that would be narrowing it down way too much because we don't even just worship the resurrection right we just don't venerate ourselves before an empty tomb we don't make pilgrimages to an upper room some mecca in jerusalem on the anniversary of pentecost right we're not giving ourselves over to dates and anniversaries and these different things there's people that give themselves so over to dates and anniversaries that they even in the message worship according to a calendar very structured very rigid you're going to do this on this day you're going to do this on this day you're going to do this together you're going to listen to this you're going to do that and everything's according to they have our own message advent calendars where everything's already determined beforehand and god didn't want god didn't want to distill it down to something that is backward looking he wants us even today if we're going to know him we have to know where he's revealing himself today to a place where he was going to be let's stand thank you so much again i mean that sincerely thank you from myths to mystery i want to get into it more of what jesus christ pointed us to and if you're listening to these sermons any of those ones i just read if you listen to either one of those you'll find what christ was pointing us to let's bow our heads heavenly father there's a wonderful presence that's amongst us and i know that it's very tedious to take time to instruct to teach [Music] to bring in historical references to even in with an audience lord conduct an exercise or share my experience with an exercise that tries to piece together dates and months and times [Music] and lord i accept that both manner and matter could be lacking i accept that there's a way in which i've expressed it could cause the people to always feel kind of shifting is this is this the the platitude is this the point oh no it's again it's just more confusion but lord my my desire is to [Music] walk a straight line even though it may seem i'm bouncing back and forth [Music] and lord the more i have studied the message of the hour on this subject the more that i've looked into it historically and scripturally more than ever i believe it's it would be right [Music] that we have a sacred christmas as a church as a family to be some purposeful recognition of your birth some personal and intimate worship of you not as a baby but in the true spirit of what christmas means not as a baby but in the true meaning of and truth of it lord may we be inspired i think about it lord that there's so much frolic and frivolity and even other religious celebrations during this time lord we should be so careful that we don't convey the wrong message because if there are those seeking you today wanting to find you may we not be so scrooge or grinch lord to the season that we don't we ba humbug it and we we believe it's so pagan we just close our lips and don't want to say anything about it to acknowledge it that we miss an opportunity to not point people to bethlehem but point you to your house today where we are being fed to be able to point you today where you are revealing yourself to be able to point you to in this hour not the birth of a baby but the birth of the word and the manifestation of things so beautiful i pray lord you bless your people i know that they've been very [Music] patient and exhibit a lot of grace and i pray that you bless them for it be with the ministers lord brother chris brother manuel minister different families traveling and out lord i know not anyone's sick right now lord i just thank you that we're in good health continue to protect us lord i pray only by your grace that we remain healthy we know it alone lord no matter what watching we do we know it's by your grace that you've preserved us i pray that you do so for this holiday season we ask these things in the lord jesus christ amen amen amen
