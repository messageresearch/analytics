TRANSCRIPT
========================================
subject is a matter of Faith this has been running in continuity and parallel to the services on Christ my healer tonight is the second part of this question a miracle or medicine kind of asking the question uh was if somebody recovers and made well was it a miracle do we wait for a miracle or was it medicine and maybe one way we could say that we prefaced this last time is what does faith look like in healing we can have different positions on how to approach an illness where some say it's only a miracle if you abstain from any intervention at all others may just leave God completely out of it and pursue after whatever science may offer them to be to be healed but I believe those of us who are sincere we find ourselves in a situation where we're longing to be made well especially for facing chronic sickness we say we ask ourselves if I'm sick does faith does faith do nothing at all but believe the promise or does it try everything that's available I'll try this room somebody I'll try that remedy I'll try this I'll try that what does faith look like and as we mentioned before there's some that are professing Christians that believe that God forbids The Believer from ever going to the doctor and from ever taking medicine and they're very strong in that and equate it too and I could show the I could play the sermons for you show you the writings to where they actually equate going to the doctor to committing actual adultery against your spouse they believe it to be that tremendous of an error but we looked into the Bible last time we saw how in Proverbs chapter 17 verse 22 it says a merry heart doeth good like a medicine but a broken Spirit dryeth the bones a merry heart does good so a positive attitude this fits well with some of the things we've been ministering on the right mental attitude towards the promises of God and and your mood and your atmosphere and those things it says it does good like a medicine so in other words the Bible is saying that medicine does good right and that's something that we could see just very obviously that the medicine does good medicine means a cure or healing and we looked at a number of places in saw where there's a reference to something used to heal or to anoint and something used in remedy and a sickness or wound that despite multiple references to things that could be used to help the body and to Aid it and heal him there's no condemnation or warning against medicine in the Bible now there's been I was wanting to go down this line of teaching how that there's things in the Bible that warn against um against pills and potions and Witchcraft and sorcery so it's not just all you know seeking whatever can give help me you know I'm just going to pursue it if that means I've got to kill a rabbit and boil its toenails and uh and and sleep with goat fur under my pillow with some incantation no there's there's a line that you can cross where you're just going straight into some sort of other religion that denies the existence of God and but I want to instead of maybe and I just see how the Lord pulled me away from that and because there's just always will be opportunity maybe to deal with that side but there's this balance in this scripture where it brings up medicine something prudent something reasonable that it's not just saying it doesn't cast a suspicion on things that can Aid the body and healing and in second Kings chapter 20 verse 7 as we read it here's Hezekiah who's sick unto death and he is uh he's desperate to be healed and the Bible says that the word of the Lord came to him and it says I've heard thy prayers he says I will heal thee and then on the third day go up to the house the Lord so God says I'm going to heal you and when the word of Lord comes to Isaiah for his healing and he's going to speak to him words of healing Isaiah doesn't just say thus saith the Lord you're healed what he does is he takes a lump of figs which would be some sort of paste they even say maybe a cake a fig something put together and he puts it upon the boil lays took it laid it upon the boil and it says by that he recovered in other words he was healed so we could present the scripture that says I will heal thee in verse 5 the Lord says I will heal thee but then we have somebody who administers some sort of Salve or balm or ointment or medicine and it says he recovered and so maybe the debate was well was it God that healed him or was it medicine right was it was it a miracle or was it medicine was it the figs or was it God and I believe that there's a way that we could position that where it's all it either has to be God or has to be the figs I said we would be wrong to do that because God chose the figs to be an aide or to do to have some part he blessed those things to have some part in the deliverance and the healing of Isaiah and so this is where we stand all healing is Divine Healing that's where we stand as Believers all healing is Divine Healing and say well I know an atheist who didn't even believe in God who was healed well all healing is Divine Healing it's interesting sometimes that if it doesn't happen under a message roof with message Believers we get skeptical and we get cynical and we want to disbelieve be careful you're just disbelieving the power of your God because it's our God that heals it's our God that saves it's our God who has power and so if God heals a hole in someone's heart and they're not a message believer It could only be God it does that somebody has cancer and and they recover and whether they receive treatment or what and someone has made well and they say oh you won't believe it I'm in remission there's not a sign of Cancer don't be afraid to say praise God right because it's our God that heals brother Graham says God Alone stands in healing so what are the things we're wanting to expose is how the devil tries to cause fear in our hearts when it comes to certain things in order to keep us bound and I believe a Believer does not need to fear sickness whatsoever doesn't need to fear sickness the sickness itself or the future that may be because of sickness and we certainly do not need to have fear when Desiring to treat a wound or Desiring to treat a sickness and we can do so and trust in God and let me say this way as a Believer we're not manifesting doubt by taking um Ibuprofen when we have a headache maybe if I can say it another way we're not manifesting doubt when we take peppermint oil and rub it on our temples when we have a headache right that's not the manifestation of doubt what's interesting though is some people think the peppermint oil is okay but ibuprofen is wrong right it's weird how we start to build these camps but just look at we shouldn't have that this seed sown into our Spirits where as soon as you do that and think about the slippery slope in this I think I'm just getting all excited and I need to calm down I need some lavender if we have that in our minds at all from as a starting point I just want to believe God I just want to believe God if I do anything to help this um that you know that's going to be a sin or that's unbelief and then you get so desperate you try something guess what you've just done to your faith your conscience is going to condemn you because you're going to say well when I had faith I was doing nothing and now that I'm doing this it's almost as if you've taken this you've gone the wrong direction but only because of your prior belief system so sometimes what we need to do is come back to base and say Lord I'm sorry that I was building all these parameters and I thought that healing could only come one particular way and I was a little bit imbalanced in my Approach and you repent upon those grounds then you don't have the devil who's trying to erode your faith in confidence when you're making a lump of figs available right upon a boil to for God to be able to heal you and I know there's been a lot said on these things and um and so there's a lot that I hope that you're able to remember that we've touched on in this now in second Chronicles chapter 16 verse 12 he says this is a scripture that is used very predominantly by those who believe it's a sin to go to the doctor sin to take medicine we focused a lot on the medicine last time we're wanting to take a step further in this in a different direction it says or along the same lines but a different emphasis it says an ace on the 30 30 and 9th year of his Reign was diseased in his feet until his disease was exceeding great but the Scott I found that article or a journal where they are writing about what they thought this disease was and and and the different uh connections that they make even to Modern ailments it says yet in his disease he sought not the Lord but sought we could say sought the Physicians now we could read this and we could kind of create a complex about going to the doctor you say well ASL had a disease and it was great a disease in his feet this disease was great and and he went to the Physicians and didn't seek the Lord but his Heir was not going to the Physicians his air is the first thing that's mentioned he sought not the Lord so what we can gather from that is he went to Physicians and didn't go to God whatsoever it's expressed in such a way to where he abandoned what he ought to have done or what he knew was right there's some sort of subjection of his uh his efforts to the god who's a Divine PRI has Divine Providence over all of it if he could bring the contrast to Hezekiah when he got sick what did he immediately do he went to the Lord and said Lord I need your help I need your grace and God could have said go to the Physicians right in King Asos situation he said oh God I need you to intervene I've got this disease in my feet I've got this uh pulmonary problem I got the circulation Problem whatever it might be Lord I need your help and God said go to the Physicians and so we do not want to build up this mistrust this unhealthy fear in our hearts because here it says that King Aesop sought not the Lord that means to seek with care he didn't inquire means to practice to study to follow to seek with application to demand in other words God was not sought or considered at all right he didn't ask anything of God he didn't seek God about his illness he didn't pray about his illness so Faith was not the king Asos Approach at all and so if I could say it this way and if you just say well that's just brother Aaron John this conclusion that's fine Esau was not wrong go to the doctor or he would not have been wrong to go to the doctor but he was wrong to not include faith in whatever it was he did notice how brother Branham touches on this in the sermon conference with God your first Duty when you get sick of course you go to the doctor you go to your doctor this is Brother Brown I'm saying this this isn't me your first Duty when you get sick of course you go to your doc your doctor he does all he can do if he can't do no more you have a right to go to the great specialist then now we're not against doctors you realize how he places this that when you're sick your first duty is you go to your doctor and if he can't help you then you then you can go to the specialist this might seem contrary to the way we build it up in our minds of what faith looks like but it's not it's not a lack of faith to go to the doctor and so that's where I'm trying to address this is we say oh well it's not Faith to go to the doctor if I can put it this way you're still giving God a chance to heal you when you go to the doctor it's still part of it but part of what you're seeking and the sermon Jehovah Jireh but a man says surely you have feeling for your people and for the people that's God's people and people who want to be healed remember when you are sick your first duty is to see your doctor and see what he says and then if he diagnoses the case of something that he cannot science science has not been able to reveal to him any help for you then you have a right to come to God he is the great physician this is beautiful balance because I think we have it the opposite right when we get sick we want to give God a chance we want to try nothing at all and and that's I'm not saying that that attitude's wrong but this this approach is not wrong right to say well I'm not feeling well I need to I want to call my doctor I want to make an appointment I'm doing this in faith believing that God uses doctors God can use this doctor to tell me what exactly this is and what I can do to keep myself healthy and my family healthy he says when you're sick your first duty is to see your doctor and see what he says why because all healing is Divine Healing the sermon Faith once delivered to the Saints but the rest says all healing is Divine Healing doctors have AIDS God's the Healer doctor sets the bones God does the healing doctor gives medicine to kill the rats in you and God patches up the holes that the rat's eaten and he's drawing on an example he says if you have if you have rats in your home and it's chewing through things and chewing through things and you use a poison to kill the rats but then something has to come along and sow up all the places where their attitude the holes he said so medicine can provide something to kill an infection to kill a uh it can provide something to deal with that bacterial infection to remedy the disease to set a bone to remove something but then the very things that God has placed inside the body he says God patches up the holes he says only one healing Divine Healing I continued on the long of these uh you know the brother random saying when you're sick your first duty is to go to your doctor in Matthew chapter 9 verse 12. it says but when Jesus heard that he said unto them they that behold need not a physician but they that are sick it's repeated in in the Book of Luke and again also in Mark it's one of those places where you see this Symmetry and the repetition it's always the same they that are whole need not a physician but they that are sick they that a whole have no need of the physician but they that are sick what is Jesus saying if you're sick you need a physician given a perfect opportunity to say if you're sick avoid doctors right here's here was his chance to sow into us a healthy suspicion of doctors here was his chance to caution us against uh pursuing you know any kind of outside help or means in wanting to be made well but he says it he just says it as a matter of fact the sick are the ones that need a physician physician it comes from the word to mean to make whole to cure or to heal so they that are lacking they that have a breach they have a wound they that are not well they they need a physician to help them and this is Christ given an opportunity maybe to say something negative about doctors and he doesn't do so then in Mark chapter 5 verses 25 to 28 and this is just prior this is uh this is actually I apologize it's not prior to it's in chapter two where he mentions uh they that are sick need a physician he says and a certain woman which had an issue of blood 12 years and had suffered many things of many Physicians maybe some of us could put ourselves In Her Shoes suffered many things of many physicians in Luke chapter 8 verse 43 it says which had spent all her living upon Physicians now that means she did everything she could she spent her money she spent a living she'd suffered many things of many Physicians she had gone and seen them and she'd been treated by them and then those days certainly the things that they were available and at their disposal are much different than now but when she had heard of Jesus came into the press behind and touched His Garment for she said if I may touch but his clothes I shall be whole you can hear still here's a situation I just I raised this just to see how the Bible again is referring to physicians in the days of Christ who would treat somebody who is not well treat somebody who is sick treat things and maybe they try and try and try and there's nothing wrong with that effort but in her faith in seeking Christ that's where she found her healing we know in the Bible that Luke is was a physician Paul says in Colossians chapter 4 verse 14 Luke the Beloved Physician the Beloved Physician right I don't think it ever says that about lawyers but it says it about doctors the Beloved doctor the Beloved Physician and he's the one that writes the book of Luke he's the one that's accredited with writing uh the book of Acts here's one that was a physician and again I know this seems maybe very Elementary or maybe there's some sort of uh deduction that I'm taking from it but it's not putting doctors and Physicians and those who would be there to help somebody who is sick it does not put them in a negative light brother Branham in the sermon God testifying of his gifts he says if your arms broke it's your duty to go to the doctor and let him set that arm then ask God to heal it that's right he says but now wait what if that cancer he can't cut it out what if the roots are scattered out like this then there's only one thing left that's God that that's God the Almighty notice first duty if he broken bone go to the doctor notice kind of how we have our hierarchy right if we broke a bone we might think oh go to the doctor he needs to set it but then something else you're like oh whatever you do just believe God for your healing and we create this this uh division right I hope you understand where my heart is at is just wanting to kind of take a step back and look at this we create a division where in one situation we don't even think twice but another situation we begin to kind of put our faith in this compromised position that we couldn't go seek a physician to be well we couldn't take medicine to help with our sickness and the sermon God's provided way again these are all different statements in the message of the hour he says God has a provided way if the doctor sure it's your duty to go to your doctor it's your duty to do whatever you can for yourself but look brother when you get to get to a place where the doctor can't help you you've got a right to call on God that's exactly right and you believe it again what I love about this is brother bradman's brother Branham is giving this as our prophet is telling this to us for our prophet that it is okay right it is okay to go to the doctor he's actually saying it's your duty therefore if you're going to seek means to address an issue in your life or to deal with some sort of circumstance or situation and whatever Channel it would be that you would seek help just to help you you don't ever leave your faith at home in doing that you don't leave your discernment behind you don't leave your faith behind you don't create this division where it's like well I'm just going to go ahead and give medicine a chance and then if that doesn't work I'm going to give God a chance no you're giving God a chance through the medicine you're giving God a chance through the doctor because God uses the doctor I think it's such a tremendous balance brother when he's preaching the revelation of Jesus Christ it's in 1960 when he's preaching the church ages in the Ephesian Church age he says let me tell you something as I was speaking the other day upon the doctor's prescription people don't like to take the doctor's prescription if he's got a remedy that'll cure your sickness and you refuse to take it it ain't the doctor's fault that you died no sir it's your fault because you refuse to take it again it's really simple that God could actually use a doctor to give you a prescription that'll cure your sickness and it's your fault if you don't take it he's not putting on signs he's not putting on the doctor he's putting on the earth your fault if you refuse to take the medicine that God prescribes I know we're covering just things over and over and over again and I hope it's that repetition is okay but I have and it looks like it's going to be maybe a really short service tonight I think that'll probably be okay I don't know if I have any objections to that either but I have three lengthy statements I want to read I don't believe I provided slides for these because they're just so long and I wanted maybe I didn't want to get lost in the slides but if you could just hold tight here we just have these three statements to read and and just let the Lord kind of lead us to whichever direction he'd want us to go but again take everything that we've talked about to this point and think about how the word is trying to open our eyes up to have faith in God and not be unreasonably suspicious of things that can help because if you if you are if it's fear that's driving you you could convince yourself that it's actually faith that's creating this desire to abstain from something or faith that's causing you to be really bull doggish about something when it's actually fear something that God uh we may have dramatized before where God has provided away could you imagine if Isaiah came and said hey I've got a lump of figs I want to lay it on the boil and I want you to be well and Hezekiah said no I'm trusting God for my healing no I'm believing God he God Will Make A Way and God's saying this is the way this is the way this is this is the way to be made whole this is the way to get those years that you prayed for to get them back and so we don't want to be running on our own human inspiration we don't want to be running in fear we want to be balanced now now the um maybe the preface for this can be this that there's so many voices there's so many attitudes there's so many sides that are out there today that it's really easy for a voice just to kind of get going around in our head and then we get suspicious about things or or there's ways that may be uh and for even from the other side a voice gets in our head and then we get suspicious about other things we've got to be very very careful that we don't find ourselves in some camp uh to where we're divided along these different lines or God gives us certain latitudes and the sermon Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever this is lengthy but I felt really impressed to read it to you so you could hear how brother Branham approached this particular subject he says now we are here to try to put in our little Ministry with your ministry together to bring glory to God the Lord has called me years ago to pray for his sick children and I do that reverently try to do and I do not claim to be a Healer now if anyone can hear that I am not a Healer I don't claim to heal people I frankly don't believe there's anyone can heal people because that's God's job and he's already did that by his stripes where you're healed when his son at Calvary was wounded for our transgressions and with his stripes we are healed a past tense and I think you might um well here he says in so many times people speak of Divine Healing there's no healing but Divine Healing that's the only healing there is no other healing but Divine Healing never did medicine ever cure any case never did an operation ever cure operation is an aid and medicine is an aid which we think they are fine we thank God for every Aid that we have but God's the Healer notice how here's here's a prophet that wants to pray for people and has a desire to see sick people healed and there may be a number of people that he's going to pray for who've gone to the doctor who tried to get help and he doesn't say anything that would create a further wound in their Spirit right say oh you unbelieving group that ran off to all these doctors you should be ashamed of yourselves you need to start repenting he's he's using this in a way that's uh that is support in support of the truth that God uses all sorts of means that you could use a medicine but it's not the medicine that cured it's the medicine that was used for one part but God does the other part he says we thank God for every Aid we have but God's the Healer Psalms 103 and 3 said I am the Lord that heals all thy diseases so we know we have to agree with the word if the words out in one place then it's out everywhere it's perfectly in harmony all the way through I just believed the word that's God's program I do not want anything more than the Bible teaches but I want all that it does teach I want it all so if it's God's word it must come now I know that God can do things that's not written in his word he's God he could do anything he desires to do but as long as I know it's coming out of the word it gives me good assurance that everything's all right I like that real well so now we're asking the Lord tonight to bless us and now just one more word for it on Divine Healing now I never come to take the place of your doctor no I come to do this I come to pray for God's child the doctor's patient my brother and sister that's what I come for you'll recognize this phrase here recently now in this you see so much when you speak of bodily healing that there's the motives and objectives of people seem to be so confused and wrong many times so program kind of sets it up that he's here I'm here to pray for the sick people when people speak of Divine Healing there's only uh one kind of Divine Healing there's no only one kind of healing it's Divine Healing whether it be medicine operation an aid doctors whatever it is God's the one that heals and he says because I can see that in the word of God whatever I'm doing I want to come to the word of God and he kind of takes a step back he says but when you talk about healing of the body there's so many motives so many objectives and it's the motive and objectives of people that cause people to become confused now the beautiful part of this as I looked at it is here's brother Branham who recognizes how people with the wrong motives and the wrong objectives have confused the people so he's demonstrating that his motive is right he demonstrates it very clearly he wants God to have the glory his objective to see one healed he's he's wanting them to be assured that he's not coming as a rival he's not coming as an adversary he's coming with an interest in God's people he's coming with an interest to see that sick people are healed and he actually calls them the doctor's patient right there's there's not creating any kind of rivalry not creating any kind of uh friction he's not saying I'm coming to undo what all the doctors have done I'm coming to do what doctors couldn't do uh what he could say is he did even in India I'm coming to do what your witch doctors couldn't do I'm coming to do what your false religions couldn't do I'm coming to do that what only God could do now here this is where it gets um I think extremely relevant for us and if this if if is Not Practical for you you'll see where this wisdom is practical to help others or in situations you might be confronted with he says now you go to a medical doctor and he'll say don't you ever don't you go over to that surgeon he's nothing but a butcher he'll just cut you to pieces he's a sawbone all right okay so you just have like the family practitioner or maybe the more holistic doctor or whatever it might be he's like we just kind of want to look at the whole person and we just want to think about what we can do and we got a lot of copper we can get you to wear and a lot of things we could do to help you to make you better but whatever you do don't go to that surgeon because they're just going to cut you open and they're going to do this and do that and he's talking about how that works like here's someone who can actually help you but they start creating a rivalry against other thought processes against other people what is it we all hate when you go to buy a car and the first thing they say is you didn't go to the dealership down the street those people are lousy I see you're driving a Ford here the Chevy dealership uh we want to get you out of that Ford because they're horrible right you realize 90 of all Fords are still on the road yeah because the rest of them actually made it home right and they just start telling you a bunch of things about car you're running the other guy down like yeah I would never go there they're horrible they're bad for me personally I'm like I don't want to do business with you because the only way you try to make yourself look good is by running everybody else down right off the bat has anybody experienced that I don't like it when someone's trying to convince me by how good they are by telling me everyone else is bad it leaves a real bad taste in my mouth and brother Branham is identifying the nature of some people with the wrong motive and run objective instead of just saying hey I believe I can help you he said whatever you don't go to that surgeon over there he's just a saw bone and then the surgeon will say back to the medical doctor you don't need sugar pills you need an operation right oh they're giving you just a bunch of sugar pills that's never going to help you need to get operated on well then both of them they'll say don't you have nothing to do with that chiropractor it's nothing but just psychic your mind I'd say I guess these issues were around then and the chiropractor will say to the osteopathic your bones need adjusting not your muscles rubbed and they're all against the preacher so now there you are but what I think that the motives and objectives are not right guess how each one has their theology their belief system the only way you can get help just through this and if you just get the if you just line up your spine the warts on your toes will go away and if you just if you just get your cervical if you just get this fixed and it'll cause do this and they believe that they're Paradigm the way they look at that's the remedy for everything right and and they create these rivalries and these factions these different way of looking at it and they says that's what people have in their mind come on we should I should be getting a lot of amens right you should carry me out on your shoulders tonight for reading what Brethren Bradham said because you're like yeah this is this is real life 2022. this is maybe it's different words these days but this is exactly the atmosphere we live in anymore he says I think the motives and objectives are not right it's a money-making thing it says if everything is right now this is to zero in on this if every man is right and a man has got his right motive and his right objective to it I think this that each of us and all know that operations do good medicine does good Bible said so he says the Bible said so and you know a chiropractic and osteopathic many times helps people we know that that's a good Aid a help I've had to humble myself to the message of the hour with the way I think I told you before I'm a data guy right I want data I want to verify verify verified document document document these things have to make sense empirically you know they'd be backed up there needs to be peer-reviewed studies done right this is the way I look at medicine this is the way I look at things in the natural these are things that I want I want to be documented and verified and you hear you hear about this you hear about that you're like that makes no sense at all how is throwing dry pasta up against the South Wall going to do anything for a crick in your neck and well it worked I'm like all right I'm not going to argue with it it worked great and brother I'm saying that these things they can that's a good help and Aid so what we should do would each one of us join hands and heart together and March forward to do everything we can for our people to make life a little more pleasant this journey that we're in anyhow to help one another to do all that we can to benefit and to make life more pleasant for each person that's traveling this journey is to this end that I'm here to try to do that to join hands with your doctor with your chiropractor with your surgeon with your pastor with your neighbor and all to try to make life just a little better not a beautiful attitude now brother Branham identified how so many times there's these motives and objectives and maybe he knew he was facing an audience in 1958 that had been told a lot of things about these Divine healers and these Faith healers and these people who believe that God can heal you and it's nothing but this and it's worse than a sugar pill and it's this and it's that and he realized that there's people sitting there who've had their minds filled with a lot of things and instead of brother Branham lashing out he demonstrates the right motive and objective the right kind of attitude to put someone in the right frame of mind to be healed and even to receive prayer for the sick that that someone's gonna lay hands on them and pray him he hasn't created a rivalry with their surgeon he hasn't joined ranks with the chiropractors and running down the general practitioners he's actually speaking in a way that clarifies that the right motive and objective would be God you use whatever it is you can to help in this situation to make life just a little bit better I think I have it in here somewhere but whether Ram says we just have about a short time on this Earth anyways in the sermon taking sides with Jesus again this is a lengthy statement I appreciate it so much just your your uh your good attitudes tonight and in expectation and the sermon taking sides with Jesus he says here not long ago a certain sister that goes to this church was at another church where God was making everything happen all right he's got my attention and this sister said to the other sister you know that man that could pray for the sick must have a very Victorious Life he said he he must just be able his family and everything be healed at a spoken word like that and the other lady happened to be from Jeffersonville and I'm sure that nobody has to know but what Jesus said among your own people you know your country that's right it may be that right now coming close it may be a change of time you see and he said you know what so if we could just try to draw from what brother Bradham said there's a certain sister that goes to this church was at another church where God was doing things God was moving and the comment was wow that one that prays for the sick he must be able just to speak the word for him and here's the response that this person had you know what not one of his kids can have a sniffle less he takes it to a doctor he goes a poor degraded deluded thing like that a woman that just wanted to throw off said when his children get sick he takes them to a doctor this idea that oh when God is really moving God is doing things and oh God must be moving and that person may never it just speaks the word to be healed and the critic says oh no actually what happens when they when they get sick they can't have a sniffle unless he takes it to the doctor he says anybody that's sensible will do the same thing amen what if their kid's sick take him to a doctor he said this is just someone who's trying to throw off he says people can't understand that medicine is sent of God why brother if it's not it's of the devil God is where medicine won't reach certainly medicine is of god well you say I know what a lot of doctors just oh yes and I know a lot of preachers the same way too it's not the man that's handling it what it it's what it is I know many men are handling the word of God that don't believe in Divine Healing don't even believe in God but they handle it just the same there's many men out there with medicine and surgery and stuff that denies God and everything else but there's many one that believes him too so if it helps people it's of God I don't have to take the car this is um I'll pause right there brother Ram's addressing those little suspicions that are sold into people's hearts and he says it's a sensible thing to go to your doctor and he says now if the argument is well this doctor is greedy and this doctor's that and he's in the he's kind of in the back pocket of the pharmacy pharmacies or whatever the pharmaceutical companies now if you can't have any confidence in them it's not going to be able to help you and and where there's bad doctors he says there's bad preachers and everybody's like well probably more bad preachers right and it's like there's always those who handle something are associated with something that don't represent the norm or the general or the or the real true and and right so he's saying let's not let's not use the bad or the negative to cast everything in a bad light he's saying that God uses medicine and if it helps people it's of God and there's a lot there's a whole so many more statements I could bring in here where brother mom talks about how uh doctors have come up with ways to treat people and inoculate people and even in a you know oh and from the standpoint of taking care of things beforehand and whether it be vaccines or certain precautions and being a proactive to protect yourself remember says these things are of God if it helps people it's of God now this is a to me it's just a tremendous example he says so if it helps people it's of God I don't have to take that car and ride home tonight I can walk if I want to but God made me a car so I thank God for it you don't have to go to the doctor you don't have to you don't have to if you don't want to but he says God can give you God can help you through that doctor it's my words now just taking the analogy he used you don't have to take the car home right science produced the car scientists produce the clothes that you wear right and we're not all just shivering out in the cold with nothing on because it's from the Tree of knowledge of Good and Evil there's things that we use and we use it prudently and we use it rationally and we we use it within measure and we and even brother Brown he's talking about toxins and and prescriptions he says that you got to get a doctor who knows how to mix it together right if you get some sort of Quack and he does too much of it it can kill you so things need to be in measure they have to be in context they have to be balanced you want to have the right approach he says all things come from God but use them sensibly don't go insane with them perfect all things come from God but don't but use them sensibly don't go insane with them if I could say this don't let the doctor become your Paradigm don't let the medicine become your Paradigm don't let the alternative medicine become your Paradigm don't let the alternative treatments and remedies become your Paradigm he says don't go insane with them use them sensibly in other words stay within that faithful mind that that sane sensible approach where you're rooted in ground in the scripture rooted ground in the word of God and you don't go insane with it where you're all in just the same way some people can be about Automobiles and cars that's all they're about they're they're all into their car their car becomes the idle their car becomes the god you can do the same thing about lifestyles when I say Lifestyles I mean just dietary Lifestyles right I guess the joke is do you know how to tell someone's a vegan just wait they'll tell you right because it's a religion to them it's a belief system it's not about diet and nutrition it's a political Cause And so there's a lot of things that they're going to let you know why because they've gone insane with it he says let's be sensible about it don't go insane with them don't don't go insane with what surgery medicine cures remedies helps anything that could be from that that the physician or the Cure or the approach all the means that God could use to help you he says God made him if it helps people that's okay but he says let's be sensible about it don't go insane with it I know this I this is just very practical I feel very impressed as a pastor here to share these things so you know where brother Branham stood on them now my final statement I want to read to you tonight is from the sermon Shepherd of the Sheepfold 1956 brother Brown says and today we have osteopath chiropractors Medical Science Divine Healing and each one seems to fight against the other and now friends we got to admit that all of them help people you got to admit it tonight chiropractors help people you gotta meditate the osteopath the Medical Science Divine they all help people he says that's right and why can't people forget their differences and let's all work together to try to help our fellow man our brother and if we don't have that kind of motive my opinion that there's some other selfish motive behind it think listen to this statement if I knew that drinking a drink of water or doing anything would try to help somebody God knows I'm for it that's all if water would do it anything he says if it's going to help somebody God knows I'm for it that's all anything if osteopathic Chiropractic medical science or anything could give anybody some help praise God for it I thank him with all my heart that's right that we have those things he's willing to praise God for it and if we could just take that old selfish motive the medical scientists say oh there's nothing to Chiropractic Chiropractic there's nothing to Medical Science and both of them there's nothing to Divine Healing there's I had I don't know how a dozen pages of these statements I could have read to you well it doesn't if you want if you want all the quotes um I'll teach you how to search no if you want the quotes I can provide them for you brother I'm just so consistent with it recognizing this rivalry among different approaches to the body and what we like to approach things this way and some people approach it that way you know then they all have um truth to them and they all have different ways of helping people and really he's looking at if there's just a way that we could all get away from our fear and our suspicion and encourage one another uh what one works for one person may not work for another what one person can do another person can't do a lot of different things that help and can only help one that may not help another there's some people that their physical condition and the condition of their bones and their actual or whatever it is they're suffering with it'd be the worst that he could do to go chiropractor and and but yet there's people and myself I've benefited tremendously by going to chiropractors but it's not these things aren't always for people but he says this is attitude there's nothing to the chiropractor there's nothing to the general practitioner there's nothing to the surgeon there's nothing to this nothing and then they all say there's nothing about Divine heal and he says let's put our arms around another let's be Brethren Let's help somebody let's make life a little easier these people ain't going to be here very long let's just try to make it just as easy for them if the osteopathic chiropractor whatever it is if it can help you go ahead and do it that's fine give God the praise that's exactly I hope that this has helped at least somebody to take that little that little imp of the devil he starts trying to tell you that whatever you have done to help yourself has been a a sign of unbelief and it's put you in a compromised position to seek God for help I hope it gets rid of that but if anybody has in the Sin of Asa sought only the Physicians sought only the oil sought only the remedy sought only the the prescriptions only did this and has kind of left God out of it right because we have the idea I'll give God a chance first and if that doesn't work then I'll go to science I mean where did where have you put yourself and so we're giving God a chance in him only whatever way that he'll use and and I hope this has helped us tonight he says if it can help go ahead and do it that's fine give God the praise he says if somebody comes through with the gift of healing Faith well don't give the man praise give God praise if the doctor can set your arm when it's broke and fix it up make it real straight and God heals it give God praise that's right if the chiropractor you get a dislocated spine he can straighten the back up and make you walk right again give God praise not the man let's all together and all that is coming from God all good and perfect gifts come from God God Alone I say that if you're sick God's your healer and if you're doing something to help yourself and go and it can help you go ahead and do it that's fine but give God the glory if you're taking a pill say I am the Lord who heals all thy diseases you confess it you believe it and no no medicine no company no approach no doctor no belief system no Cult of healing whatever me is going to get the credit you say I'm a believer I'm trusting the Lord this is the one he's brought my way I'll place this lump of figs upon the boil and I believe that God's going to heal me give God the praise could we stand together tonight
