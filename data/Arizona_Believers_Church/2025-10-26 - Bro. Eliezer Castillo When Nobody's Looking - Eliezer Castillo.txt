TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Philippians 2:12, the Bible says, "Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own fa salvation with fear and trembling." Amen. You may be seated. What a um simple scripture, but but Paul's commending uh the Philippian believers for their obedience. And he's saying, "Well, your your obedience and and your faithfulness is not only when I'm around. You know, it's easy to become a really good saint when the pastor's around, right? Or when we're in church and that's when we're at our best. That's where we have the n best suit and ties and the dresses and everything." And we just we just look the part. We look really good. But he's saying, "Not only in my presence, now much more in my absence." And then he says, "In my absence, work out your own salvation." So this is a a thing where it's an individual affair. It's um you know I I have a lot of friends that they go to church. They go to CCV and they go to all these great churches and they're over there drinking coffee and eating a donut while they're praising the Lord and it looks like they're they're looking at a band play and it it's something spectacular, you know, and oh, I go to church, but when they're outside of church, you wouldn't even know that they know Jesus Christ, right? Because they're acting completely different. But Paul, he's telling these people, he's saying, "Even outside of my presence, even when I'm not there, even when we don't have Sunday service or Wednesday service," he says, "Work out your own salvation." He's saying, "Just as you have obeyed, not only in my presence, but outside of my presence, work out your salvation." Brother Brandham, um, I'm going to quote a lot of Brother Brandham in this message. This is a very simple message, but I I feel and it's something that it's I've always kind of um you know have quotes and and phrases and scriptures that I always use and and um this is just one of them where I really just love this thought of um the the title today is when no one is looking. living living our life when nobody is looking. When when the pastor is not there to see how good we are or what we're doing, we're working out our own salvation. Now, Brother Brandham, he's saying in the message early spiritual experiences. Um, I really like this phrase because it kind of gives it dives into his own life and um what is going on in him. He says, "Now, of course, there's things that God has revealed, and I'm not wanting you to think I'm a mystic. I'm not a mystic. I am a child of God by faith of in Jesus Christ." But there's things in the spiritual world that you can't speak out to the people. The closest person to me, I guess, in the world is my son and my wife and as I know of my mother. And they don't even know no more about it. and I've told them no more than I tell you because it's an individual affair. So, there's things that were in in Brother Benham's life, spiritual things that God revealed to him, things that he probably went through, things that he was struggling with that nobody ever knew. &gt;&gt; There's things in our life, if we start looking into our lives, that even the closest person to us will never know. things that maybe we struggle with that we'll probably never say. Things that we're we're working on and things that we only God only knows. The things that we're going through that we can never maybe tell anybody or we just choose not to. Only God knows, spiritual things, things that have been revealed that only God knows. &gt;&gt; I believe every single person has that kind of life. I understand that that um it's an individual affair and that's where Paul is saying you got to work out your own salvation. It's a it's a Christianity that's that that centers on a one-on-one relationship with God. No one else can believe for you. &gt;&gt; No one else can repent for you. No one else can obey on your behalf. This makes your life an individual journey for you. &gt;&gt; Your your it's your responsibility to uh obey God's call &gt;&gt; to cultivate your own faith to pursue your holiness to think of your daily choices every single day. It's up to us. That's why, you know, we've all I know we've all been enjoying these messages of praying and and the word of God because it's something an individual has to take upon himself to cultivate their Christian. We have to do it. Now, in saying all that, we all enjoy singing together. We all enjoy testimonies and and hearing the teachings and hearing preachings and all of that but but it's just not a um you know a giving of information and exchanging of emotions. There is a spiritual transference that is going on in our lives as the singing is going on today. &gt;&gt; As as the the first prayer when we came in was was said &gt;&gt; as the preacher is preaching there there is a spiritual transference that is going on into the individual. Even though we're all enjoying this together, we're all in a group and we can all, you know, praise the Lord in a group, but we all have our individual problems, our individual requests from the Lord, our individual situation in our lives. We're all going through it. And each and every one of us have that going on in our lives. Brother Brandham calls it a hidden life, something that nobody will ever see. And you and with God, the amazing thing with God is the the most secret things. Whenever you hear about a secret, sometimes it's gossip, right? When you when you hear about something that is hidden, sometimes it's bad. When somebody's hiding, they did something wrong. Well, this hiding place, this secret place that God has, that is the most holy thing that is in God, that is in the world. So the most secret things with God is the most holiest. So whenever you can get into a secret place with God, have a secret uh communion with God, &gt;&gt; that is the most intimate place &gt;&gt; where where brother Brandham says the world is shut out from that place &gt;&gt; where where a you know a three three uh what is it three room house &gt;&gt; we are like the the temple the tabernacle where outside yes there's good days and bad In the inner courts, there's always emotions going up and down, but then there's that holy of holies. &gt;&gt; Where is that is where the almighty dwells? &gt;&gt; Psalms 91 um verse two 1 and two it says, "He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high shall abide under the shadow of the almighty. I will say of the Lord, he is my refuge and my fortress. My God, in him will I trust. That's where I want to live. In that secret place, [snorts] in a place nobody knows, when nobody's seen, when nobody's watching, when nobody's looking, you're serving the Lord. &gt;&gt; If anybody was able to see into the secret part of one's life, what would they see? If people were able to dive in into the thoughts, what would we see? The world's secrets. Those are the words worst things. The world's secrets is the worst. In John 3:19 here, of course, we know John 3:16 where it said, "For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth will not be uh will will not be condemned but be saved and have eternal life." And and then he's saying, "But but he that believeth not is condemned." And he's condemned already. And then so 19 he says this is the condemnation here because now he's saying that there is somebody that's saved that believes and those that don't believe he is condemned. And he says this is the condemnation that light has come into the world. So light is the illumination. &gt;&gt; Light allows you to see &gt;&gt; allows you to see what's going on. And he says light has come into the world and men love darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil. robbers, thieves, murderers, they hide in the dark, right? They're the ones hiding and they don't want to be seen. So, they're hiding in the dark. So, there's there's a sin that that loves to dwell in the dark. And that is a secret place for the whole world. People have secret places. But but here came Jesus, not to condemn. He said he didn't come to the world to condemn, but that light was an illumination so that they can understand that they were already condemned and he came to save them. &gt;&gt; But people, the Bible says is that that their deeds were evil. And verse 20 it says, "And everyone that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest their deeds should be reproved. But he that doeth um the truth cometh to light and his deed that his deeds may be manifest that they are wrought in God. And it says that they loved the world. They loved the darkness because they love those things. So that's why a lot of people they choose not to serve the Lord. They choose not to believe. &gt;&gt; Uh it's one of the biggest reasons why people don't believe, right? people think they're intellectual and and they're just so intellectual that you know the Bible it's just oh no it's it's not doesn't fit but a lot of times it's just a reason for them to say you know what I'm not going to be uh convicted of these things I don't want to be guilty of the things that I love so they'd rather be like you know what I I don't you know that's just beneath me but a lot of times it's because we don't want to be don't want the light to come in. &gt;&gt; Those are the secret things of the world. But to God, the secret things, those are the most beautiful things. In Deuteronomy 29:29, it says, "The secret things belong unto the Lord our God, but those things which are revealed unto us and to our children forever that we may do all the words of this law." So, there's mysteries and revelations that God reveals or or reserves for intimate fellowship with his people. There's secrets that God is not going to divulge to the whole world, but he only has it specially for his elect. &gt;&gt; There's secret things that you know, revelations that you know that the other person will never know. &gt;&gt; And it's not that you have, oh well, you know, I'm probably bride and they're not. No, there's everybody is individual. Yes, &gt;&gt; we God will give us a collective uh revelation so that we can understand the mysteries of God. But then there's things in your life that God will only reveal to you that no one will ever know. &gt;&gt; God will whisper secrets to you. &gt;&gt; God will work things out and then people don't understand how did they overcome that. &gt;&gt; There's secrets. There's mysteries that God will tell us. He wants to share his heart in those m moments. It's a sacred trust. And God, he always works and transforms in the inside life. It's a secret place where there's no performance. There's no pretending. There's no audience. Only God and the soul. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm a human. We're all human. We We're all We're all connected one way or another. at work. We, you know, you got to get the boss to like you, right? You got to, you want people to like you. You want to be friendly. You want all these things. We all are in this world and we're we're we're uh creatures that want to be together and want to have all these things, but when it comes to God, there is no pretending. &gt;&gt; There is no fake it till you make it. &gt;&gt; There is none of that. IT'S JUST A RAW EXPERIENCE between you and God. &gt;&gt; Then God can you can't you can't fool your way a way around this with God. &gt;&gt; You can't look good in front of God. &gt;&gt; All of our problems and all of our issues, God is looking. &gt;&gt; And he's not, oh man, no. He says, "That's my boy. That's my girl. THAT'S my daughter. That's my son. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And all of his flaws, all of the things, they are mine. &gt;&gt; He doesn't want a a a cosmetic Christian. He doesn't want somebody that is just lifted up and and but he wants somebody that that is there's no pretending. There's no audience. There's no faking it. It's just him in the soul. &gt;&gt; It's where all the masks are fall they fall away. &gt;&gt; You know, we've got a lot of faces. We've got a lot of masks. We got a lot of complexes. We got a lot of things. All those drop with God. &gt;&gt; That's where your tears are not wasted. Your pleading, it's it's heard. There's an ear there. There's somebody right there. That's where true worship flows from. This is where God does his holiest work. This is where God really starts working in an individual in your private time in your your little spot in the soul that says, "Lord, nobody knows me. I maybe as a young person, I feel misunderstood. Maybe maybe I'm I'm just trying to figure out my identity. Maybe I'm I'm trying to see what I'm what am I supposed to do? What am I who am I? What what am I SUPPOSED TO DO?" GOD KNOWS WHO YOU ARE. &gt;&gt; God knows everything about you. &gt;&gt; And he says, "I'm there." There's this scripture, I believe it's Psalms 139. One of the most beautiful but yet terrifying scriptures where Psalm says, "Wherever I am, there you are, Lord. &gt;&gt; I can hide myself in heaven. There you are. I can be in the deepest, darkest pits of hell. There you are, Lord. I everywhere I am, whatever I do, you were there when I was in my mother's belly, &gt;&gt; he said. &gt;&gt; That's the God I want to serve. &gt;&gt; The God that that I don't have to do anything. I just have to say, "Lord, it's been a rough day. &gt;&gt; I don't have to say, "Oh, it was a good day." No, you you can bring your complaints to him. &gt;&gt; You can bring your needs to him, and he will know what to do &gt;&gt; about it. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That's the God we serve. &gt;&gt; Jesus, his his most intimate and most profound messages, his greatest revelations were in the secret places here in Mark 4:10 and uh 10-11. says that now he just gave the audience the the parable of the seed and he's explaining what the seed does if it's on certain ground and all of these things and and he's giving them the seed and giving it to them as a parable so everybody's kind of scratching their head saying well okay what is he saying here and he he's allowing everybody to hear it but then the Bible says when he was alone They that were about him with the twel asked him the of the parable. And he said unto him, unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God, but unto them that are without all these things are done in parables. Aren't you glad to be in the end? &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad to know the mysteries? Amen. &gt;&gt; Not because we we congregate in a group which this is needful, but you know those mysteries because you have a one-on-one experience with God. &gt;&gt; You don't have to be like the 12 where where John, Peter, and and Andrew, they're elbowing their way closer to the Lord and say, "Well, I'm the best. I'm going to sit close to him. I'm going to sit right next to him." John over there trying to lean on his chest and Peter trying to say, "I'll do anything for you." Man, they're trying there. Everybody was fighting for his attention. &gt;&gt; You don't need to do that. &gt;&gt; Just go into your private place &gt;&gt; into your soul. He will be there. He is available. &gt;&gt; Anything you need, he's available. &gt;&gt; A friend in need, he's available. &gt;&gt; Healing, he's available. somebody to for guidance. He's available. &gt;&gt; It's this life that is alone when nobody's watching. That's when you can find your intimacy with Christ. You know, when I first um it's not in my notes, but I I was thinking when I first uh well, you know, and was as a Christian, I I would think to myself, I was like, "What if I was in a in an island all by myself?" I'd say, "I'd act the same." You think about that. If you were in a place that didn't have people that would watch you and see you and do these, what would you do? Where would you be at? What life would you be living? Well, that's a good way to check up and say, "Lord, I need a lot of help. Lord, maybe maybe there's things there's vices. There's there's things that are maybe I'm suppressing. Lord, just see it and take it away, Lord. &gt;&gt; Work in my life. &gt;&gt; Because I want to be the greatest Christian when nobody's watching. I want to serve you with all of my heart if I'm the last person on earth. &gt;&gt; That's what I want to do. He He spoke to Nicodemus at night. He had to hide away from all his friends. He he didn't want nobody to see him. And he said, "Lord, give me the mysteries." to the Samaritan woman when nobody she thought nobody was watching but brother Brandham says the disciples were there looking why is he talking to her but there they were alone she thought she was alone and there that's when God began to reveal to her the men to the road into Emmas there Jesus was there the amazing thing is he made himself known to everybody but But he revealed himself to some. &gt;&gt; They killed him. He rose again. And only those that believed were able to see him. &gt;&gt; He was only seen by loving eyes. &gt;&gt; He wasn't seen by the whole world anymore. He He gave a chance to the world. He gave a chance to the Jews. He gave a chance. But whenever he was there, he had his glorified body. It was those that believed that saw him. &gt;&gt; Amen. Right? &gt;&gt; The amazing thing is that's the only people he opened their eyes. He probably walked past a lot of people. &gt;&gt; He probably went through the Pharisee and he probably waved at them. The, you know, I'm just making things up, but maybe the Pharisee couldn't see him. It said, the Bible said that he had to open their eyes &gt;&gt; for them to see. &gt;&gt; What was it? It was It's a special relationship where you're there by yourself. Brother Brandham calls it in in the hidden life. He says it's the holy of holies consecrated hidden life alone quiet with God. He said all of those together alone quiet with God. here um in the message hidden hidden life. It's a lengthy uh quote, but he says he says there's where the church is failing in one place. Overcoming overcoming temperance, temper, overcoming differences, overcoming church prejudice, overcoming hatred. Many people tonight who shout and speak with tongues and rup run up and down the aisle and hate their neighbor. That is, brother, you've you're lost yet. That's hard to say, but it's the truth, right? overcome. You can only overcome. Then he changes his style and he says, "You say I'm eating the mana, the glory of God, but yes, look what happens from one day to to the next. You get you get the mismeal cramps. You come in where the mana is fresh all the time." He says, "Whether your neighbor treats you right or not, you'll love him anyhow." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's That's right. Whether he agrees with you or not, you love him anywhere. Anyhow, that's the way you got to do it. That's the hidden life. That's the consecrated life. That's the life that veils um that that the veils of the worlds and you're all cut off from things of the world. You only live in Christ. See what I mean, church? He says it's it's whenever we're not fluctuating with the world and we don't got, you know, saying hallelujah in church and going and just tearing everybody up on Monday. But it's a life where it says, Lord, thank you. And you go and you live your life. Now, this is a life that we're all working on. &gt;&gt; I don't think anybody's perfect. I think we all need work in this &gt;&gt; where we say, "Lord, I need this. I need more of you. I need where my character is the same in the good days and the bad days." &gt;&gt; That's when you know you're you're into something. Now, now we live in an age where where everybody is they're it's a pretending right now. We're I'm talking about this world where it's like everybody wants to replace appearance with intimacy or or wants to replace intimacy with appearances where they want to look good instead of be known and and be good. &gt;&gt; Everybody with social media they the social media has become a stage to perform. &gt;&gt; That's all it is. It's a stage &gt;&gt; so that we can go and we can go on our Tik Tok and we can get as much likes and viral views and we can go to Instagram. We can go here and we can go there and see how great we are. &gt;&gt; That's the world today. &gt;&gt; That's the whole world &gt;&gt; is just living behind filters living behind these things. the great life and that's what's influenc the sad thing is that's what's influencing &gt;&gt; not only the young but the old saying man I have it pretty bad why is because you're looking at people with three four filters on &gt;&gt; and they're they're they have a background of the Bahamas and they're probably in the mother's basement &gt;&gt; who knows &gt;&gt; but but what is it it's a stage of pretending They're not no longer just living. They're creating an identity. &gt;&gt; They're more concerned of what of of how life looks than how life really is. The tragedy is all this performance of this whole world leaves people empty looking for validation looking for the the next like and it disconnects us from the truth. That's the sad reality of the world. That's what's going on with the world. Right. &gt;&gt; And today we could even say that in a Christian life if we're not careful we can begin to like brother brother Aaron said a cosmetic Christian where we can try to fix things and and and try to build off of what we are or or what we want people to see and never work on the inside life, the inner life. That's not what we want to do. We we want to live our life whether we're living a um having a good time or a bad time whether there's people you're surrounded by hundreds of people or it's by yourself. &gt;&gt; You want to be constant serving the Lord &gt;&gt; with all of your heart. Doesn't matter what anybody says, but a lot of times us as in our human nature, we want that validation. We want that pat in the back. &gt;&gt; We're we're human. It's nice when people say, "Hey, good job. I did a good job, man. You did good at work today." Yeah, &gt;&gt; it's all right. But when we begin to feed off of that, when we begin create our character off of those things, &gt;&gt; we're in a dangerous place. Jesus, he walks in, stumbles in into that life of the Pharisees, and he says, "Whoa, you guys are in a deep problem here." He says in in u Matthew 23:27, he's talking to the Pharisees. He says, "Woe un woe to you scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, for you are like white washed tombs which indeed impear appear beautiful outwardly but inside are full of dead man's bones and uncleanness." That's the condition that they were beautiful on the outside to the point where everybody's like, "Man, I just want to be like him. Man, I can never be like the Pharisee." But his life wasn't matching his outer appearance. The world wants us to have outer appearance, wants us to be the best, the most beautiful, the strongest, the whatever it might be. They they're trying to create the perfect man and the perfect woman and saying this is what you're supposed to be. And so everybody's trying to do those things, running to the treadmill and running to this and trying to be what the world thinks is a great image. But the greatest person, the greatest husband, the greatest wife, the greatest child that you can be for your parents is one that is full of character of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's that's what we want to be. &gt;&gt; That's what I want. &gt;&gt; I wanted my life to flow from the inside out and not try to patch up the outside. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord, &gt;&gt; brother. That was the very condition of Lady Osia. He says in in Revelations 3:17 to20, he says, "Because you say I'm rich. You become wealthy. You You say you have need of nothing and don't know that you are wretched, miserable, poor, blind, and naked." See, here is where the projecting and outward appearance. They're they're trying to get outward validation. They're trying to appear that they're this, they're that. That's the world. And if we're not careful, that'll suck us right in. &gt;&gt; Then he says in 18, he says, "I counsel you to buy from me gold refined in the fire that you may be rich and and white garments that you may be clothed that your shame, your nakedness may not be revealed, and anoint your eyes with eyes that you may see. As many as I love, I rebuke and I chasen. Therefore, be zealous and repent." Then 20 he says, "Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come into him and dine with him and he with me." &gt;&gt; That is the essence of life. &gt;&gt; That he's he's talking to people that are rich that have need to nothing. But then he says, "I don't want all of that. I want to knock in your heart and me and you have a conversation. Yes, &gt;&gt; me and you have a dialogue. That's true fulfillment. When when life is done within closed doors, &gt;&gt; when Christianity is is when nobody is watching, you're there. You're you're you're walking with the Lord. &gt;&gt; When everybody is against you, when all things are are seems like everything is not working the way it should, you're still standing on the word of the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; You're still walking with the Lord by yourself. You may be surrounded. You may have many family members, but it's just you and God. &gt;&gt; It's just you. Brother Brandham, he says this. He says, "A man that stands for God stands alone." &gt;&gt; That is a Christian life. A man that stands for God stands alone. In the message, the church lo uh choosing law for grace. He says, "A man who ever amounts to anything is the man that stands alone. Him and God alone." That's the man. There's on his on his Jericho road, there's only room for two. No more, no less. Just Jesus and you. That's all. So that's the way we have to walk this narrow way. Every man that ever did anything for God walked on the same road. That's the same thing. So we are just like um they are the same thing. We have to stand it alone but never alone. He's always there. &gt;&gt; Now it doesn't mean that we have a secluded life and we're you know how people call it introverts where you know where we don't want to surround ourselves by loved ones. No, we're around people. We're we're going to we're going to have fellowship. We're going to if you're you're a funny person or if you're outgoing or if you're the quiet person, you're going to be yourself. But you've got to remember, you've got to reserve the greatest part of your life for Christ. &gt;&gt; You got to stand alone. Just like in a ship, you could put on your captain's hat. You can go greet everybody, but what makes that ship go is the man in the engine room. &gt;&gt; So, you got to you got to be happy and do all these things with family, but inside there has to be a walk alone standing on the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; We have to do that. I believe today there's Christians that live that way. Live with that integrity. Maybe sometimes we feel like we don't. Maybe, you know, what's that um syndrome? U imposttor syndrome. Sometimes maybe people feel that way. Maybe they don't feel worthy enough. Maybe. But God sees God sees a life faithful. God sees people that that are living that walk of integrity. He He's He's seen those things doing what God told us to do. &gt;&gt; Doing everything walking the way the word says it. Even though we fall sometimes we we veer off. Sometimes we stand on the word. &gt;&gt; We go to work. We trust in the Lord. GOING TO WORK. WE COME BACK HOME. WE'RE TRUSTING in the Lord. We come to church. We worship. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We do what we're supposed to do. There's no validation there. There's no good job. There's no thank you for being a Christian. It's actually sometimes the opposite. It's a thankless life. It's not going to be glamorous like the world wants you to be. You're not going to be one of those tick- tock Christians. You're not going to be one of those. You're just going to serve the Lord &gt;&gt; day in and day out. &gt;&gt; Just like I said the other the other day, I don't know when, but you know, we we hear of Noah, Abraham, and there's so much scripture about them, but if you think about it, I think Noah was 930ome hundred years. How how old he was? He was 900 and some 30 some years old and all we have is a few chapters of Noah &gt;&gt; and that's all we know him as man. Noah, he was the guy, man. He built the boat. What about all the other 800 years? &gt;&gt; All the other years that he had to toil by himself that we don't know those unknown years. &gt;&gt; What about Abraham? We know him just because he had faith and God called him. But what about all the other years before he was 75? &gt;&gt; All the other years between u the promise and and and when it was fulfilled &gt;&gt; all those years where he had to suffer. He had to stand on the word alone. &gt;&gt; No thank you. It was actually there's a crazy old man walking again. you know, in in um when my parents, my dad, he was an apostolic and and people at church at uh school, he was a Hispanic, so he kind of had it bad every way. But even like his friends, they would say, "Oh, there goes the Hallelujah. That's a holy roller. There goes the Hallelujah." And that's who they were. There goes crazy Abraham. &gt;&gt; There goes those people. What? It's not a thing. It's not a It's not a life to be glamorized and say, "Man, I would just want to be like him." It's, you know what? It's a life by yourself. A man that stands with God stands alone. Now, it's it's nice whenever we're here together, but a lot of times it's just a mundane life. If somebody looked into your life, what glory would they see? say, "Wow, look at the glorious life. Look at the glory in that life. Your mundane life. You're going to work. Coming home, coming to church, doing what we're supposed to. Men, doing what you're supposed to, doing everything you can. Coming home, go going to work, paying your tithe. women tidying up the house, taking care of the kids, picking up the clothes, folding them just to see them on the ground again. And what it's not just once a week, it's every day. Every day. That's your glorious life. Every day, brothers, just living every single day. Does it does it ever feel? Now, this is just going into perspective. Now, this is thinking because we know Christ is there. But sometimes it feels like everything we do is not much at all. &gt;&gt; I'm no I'm not great. I don't maybe I don't have a lot of gifts. I don't have this. I don't have that. I'm not like them. &gt;&gt; I just do this. I come home. I do just an everyday life. &gt;&gt; I don't have much. It doesn't matter to anybody else. It's not a glorious life. It's not a a filtered life. It's just a raw life Christian serving the Lord every day. &gt;&gt; We're not like everybody else. And sometimes it feels like even even our all seems like it's less than other people's sum, &gt;&gt; right? I'm just trying. I'm working and I'm walking and I'm feels like I'm just driving in the mud when others are just like it's a good life. It's like Lord, I'm trying my best. I'm doing everything I can. There's this story in Mark 12:41-44 and he's talking about how well I'll just read it to you. It's says, "Now Jesus sat at it the opposite of the treasury and saw how the people put the money into the treasury and how many people and and and um and many people who were rich put in much." Then one poor widow came and threw two mites which makes a quadrant. So he called his disciples to himself and said, "Assuredly I say to you that this poor widow has put more than all of those who's given to the treasury. For they put out of their abundance she put out of her poverty, but put in all she had her whole livelihood." Now this is not about money. It's about your efforts to the Lord. &gt;&gt; That some that you know they've just got they can just do it and do all these things and sometimes you're just giving it all. &gt;&gt; May Lord I don't have gifts. I don't have this. I nobody knows what I do. I'm just serving you with all of I have all that I have. Jesus says that's more than enough. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Your all is more than the world could ever give him. All the riches, all the the things, God is appreciating your all. &gt;&gt; Everything that you have, give it to the Lord. &gt;&gt; She didn't go hoping somebody was going to see. Maybe she was ashamed that she had those two mites. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Maybe she was like, &gt;&gt; you know, nobody's going to see me when everybody's, you know, buckets full of cash. &gt;&gt; But Jesus saw her. &gt;&gt; Amen. Somebody was looking. Even though she probably didn't know anybody was looking, somebody's watching our lives. &gt;&gt; Somebody's looking. &gt;&gt; I started thinking about the story of Rebecca and how God had this the servant of Abraham go and and and he had qualifications. He said, "You know the one that gives me water and no, not only that, but gives water to my camels." Now, that would have been easy if somebody was like, "I'll give you some water." But he's like, "My camels, too." Man, now that's a big task. &gt;&gt; He's making sure that whoever is going to walk up to him, that was God because not everybody's going to want to do that. &gt;&gt; That's a big task. So, he's there sitting there and I'm sure a lot of people have um have heard the story and seen how many gallons and and how the well was constructed, how you have to walk down it and and how many camels did he really have and oh, it it was a lot. It was a lot of work. Well, here comes Rebecca. Maybe now I'm just um making things up here now. read the Bible. But maybe she had a bad week. Maybe she had the worst day of her life. Who knows? She was just like all of us. Maybe it was just not one of those good days. She was just doing what she's supposed to. It was just a mundane life. Got to get the water. Yep. It's 700 a.m. I I got to wake up. Got to go get the go get the water. I got to go do this. She's not there. Hope somebody sees me today. Oh man, this is where this is my big moment to shine. No. &gt;&gt; It's your everyday life. &gt;&gt; It's when nobody's watching. &gt;&gt; It's when nobody cares. &gt;&gt; It's when you think that it just it's not worth it. That there just there's nothing to it. There was somebody expecting. There was somebody watching. And there she goes doing just her everyday life. She's said, "Do you need some water?" "Yeah, some water." "All right, here." She was quick with it, too. She Here's water. Now, he didn't say, "Yeah, give some water to my camels, too." She said, "I'll feed your I'll water your camels, too. Then the Bible says in Genesis 24:21, he says, "The man wondering at her held his peace." He said, "Oh, is this it?" He started to think, "Is this the one that's going to fulfill the word?" &gt;&gt; So now he's he's in wonder. He's watching her. &gt;&gt; She didn't do it for reci recognition. She didn't even know anybody was looking. She didn't act like like somebody was going to bring her a husband, like this is the day that I'm going to have a husband. And no, SHE WAS JUST LIVING HER LIFE. &gt;&gt; She was doing what she was supposed to. SHE WAS SERVING the Lord. She was faithful &gt;&gt; with the integrity of her heart, &gt;&gt; thinking nobody cared, nobody was watching. Now think about it. That's the way I want to live every day. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's just another day. Praise be to God. I give it. I commit it to you, Lord. &gt;&gt; I commit my day. I commit my health. I commit everything, my strength to you, Lord. Today is going to be a good day. &gt;&gt; Then you walk into the the house and it's been a horrible. And you say, "Thank you, Lord. I learned a lot of lessons. &gt;&gt; I went through a lot of storms, but Lord, thank you anyways." &gt;&gt; Well, who cared? Nobody. But it doesn't matter. I'm walking with the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's there watching her, his eyes fixed on her, not knowing that she was the bride. She was the a chosen bride that was going to change the whole narrative of the story of the Bible. That she was through her was going to be the the the manchild called Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Through her, through her family, through her lineage, she was just living her life. Now, today we can say that today he was in silent wonder. How how she was kind, she was friendly with a stranger, her humility, she was willing to take on more than what he asked. Cuz he went and he ran to her and he said, "Hey, give me some something to drink." So she fulfilled more than what he asked of her. She did everything she was supposed to. It was because that was her cloth. That was her character. That's who she was. She was serving the Lord. And because of that, somebody was watching. When nobody's watching, it feels like nobody's looking. Somebody is. There's a Holy Spirit watching us every single day. When it seems like our all doesn't seem like much at all, God is saying this is the very moment. This is there goes my son. The he there he doesn't know. He maybe he feels like he's alone. Maybe he feels maybe she feels like no nobody cares. But I'm there watching every step. &gt;&gt; And what the word gave her, she's doing more and more and more of that word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Somebody's watching. Now, I I've said this in in other places, but I want to go to Hebrews 12:1 because it's just so impactful in my life. says, "Wherefore, seeing that we are compassed about a great cloud of witnesses, or with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay us out every weight and sin that doth easily beset us, and let us run the race with patience u with patience the race that is set before us." Now, a lot of people, they take this scripture, I do too, is we talk about how let us run the race. let us lay aside everything. But he he says something specific here in the beginning. He says, "Wherefore, seeing that we are compassed about, a great cloud of witnesses." And then he starts a sentence almost incorrectly. He starts it by wherefore. You don't start a sentence that way. It's like, "Hey, how's it going? Therefore, huh?" It means it means that he's continuing on. So we got to go back to the other scriptures. We got to go to verse 11 and that is the the the chapter 11. That is the chapter of the hall of faith &gt;&gt; where it says Samson, Gideon, David, Moses. By faith, by faith, by faith they subdued lions. They did this, they did that. And and it says of whom the world was not worthy of these people. And in verse 39 in in chapter 11, he says, "All these having obtained a good report through faith received not the promise. &gt;&gt; God having provided something better for who? Us?" &gt;&gt; That they without who us should not be made perfect. Yes. &gt;&gt; Therefore, &gt;&gt; therefore, we're compassed about a great cloud of witnesses. &gt;&gt; So, he's talking about them knowing that there's going to be some that ARE GOING TO PERFECT THEIR FAITH in life. &gt;&gt; So, now us that are running this race, WE ARE COMPASSED ABOUT a great cloud OF WITNESSES. WHO WAS IT? ISAAC, ABRAHAM, JACOB, DAVID, ALL OF THEM TIPTOES ON THE OUTSIDE OR THE THE INSIDE OF HEAVEN SAYING, "KEEP GOING. &gt;&gt; KEEP pressing on. &gt;&gt; Oh, well, I just have this life. Oh, well, there's no meaning to my life." Well, there's people on the OTHER SIDE SAYING, "KEEP GOING. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE COMPASS A GREAT CLOUD OF WITNESSES. MANY PEOPLE are are DEPENDING ON THE BRIDE. Today &gt;&gt; history and and everything was depending on a woman named Rebecca &gt;&gt; because it was going to be her that was going to bring forth these children. What about us? Where we feel like we're not we're just living life, nobody cares. It's just mundane and all these things. When you have people waiting, watching on the other side of heaven, &gt;&gt; saying keep going. &gt;&gt; Don't stop. &gt;&gt; Oh, that's what happened to Jesus. That's what every the Bible says all of heaven stood watching. &gt;&gt; What move is Jesus going to take? &gt;&gt; It says that whenever all the when he was born, all of the angels came to sing for him. every step that he took. Maybe he was alone. He was despised. He was rejected by his very own people. He was alone. &gt;&gt; Yet there was all of heaven watching. &gt;&gt; There he goes. There he's going there. There he submitted to the Lord &gt;&gt; finally to the point where he's on the cross AND HE SAYS, "WHY HAVE YOU FORSAKEN ME, LORD?" &gt;&gt; Not knowing all of us were depending on him. Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible says that when he was talking to Job, where were you when all the sons of God were SHOUTING FOR JOY? WHAT WERE WE? WE WERE looking beyond THE CURTAIN OF TIME, watching the lamb be slain before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; WE WERE WATCHING HIM SAYING, "THANK [screaming] YOU, LORD." IT WASN'T A SAD MOMENT. Maybe it was sad to Mary watching him, John watching him, people seeing the blood out of his side, him dying there crying, saying, "Lord, why have you forsaken me?" But we on the other side of heaven saying, "Praise God. I am redeemed. &gt;&gt; PRAISE GOD. LOOK AT MY LORD living his life. &gt;&gt; Dying for me and you." &gt;&gt; Oh, that's what's going on today. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham, there's a quote where Brother Brandham says, "At that same time, we were rejoicing. We saw ourselves walking into this life &gt;&gt; and seeing the life that we were going to live. Every moment, brother Baram says, "We were in Abraham. We were in Jacob. We were in those." Whenever Abraham spoke to that man, we were there. &gt;&gt; We were part of the act. We are part of everything. We were in the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Watching everything. &gt;&gt; And now the bride here is representing all these Christians that died. every age from the beginning all the way to Lady Osia were representing the bride over there's a wedding ceremony going on &gt;&gt; what in in my own little life yes there is a wedding ceremony in your life &gt;&gt; there there is a uniting &gt;&gt; every time you consecrate your life to the Lord &gt;&gt; as we stand to our feet and the musicians come Brother Brandham or here in Romans 8:19 it says for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God. So not only heaven and earth are watching and waiting for us but even the earth is groaning and travailing for us. &gt;&gt; Amen. This word uh to wait expectingly to to to wait it means to stand with tiptoes that the earth is is waiting have this earnest expectation watching and in and expectedly or this expectation means an eagerness a stretched out neck. So the whole world, these earthquakes, these problems, these hurricanes, all these things that are happening, this earth is just watching, saying, "Look at these children, these sons and daughters of God are becoming what they're supposed to be." &gt;&gt; They're stepping into what they're supposed to be, back into the [music] word, back into Christ. &gt;&gt; In our little lives, when nobody's watching, you have Christ living in you. A life that is consecrated. Nobody knows. Yet when you're there by yourself, the whole world is depending on that life that you're living. Let us bow our heads as brother Philip comes. Heavenly Father, Lord, I'm just so thankful for your goodness. Lord, &gt;&gt; I'm so thankful [music] for your constant eye watching over us. &gt;&gt; That Lord, you'll never allow anything to happen, but only for your good, Father. And what a comfort it is when things begin to happen, things begin to [music] crumble. We can put it on your hands and say, "Lord, it's all for your purpose. It's all for your good. I know good is going to come out of it one way or another. Even though it doesn't feel good, [music] Lord, we're trusting in you. We're giving you all the honor and the glory because we know that our life is in your hands. [snorts] Father, I just ask that you allow each and every person here to feel that presence that show them that you've been there the whole time, that you've been helping them out. that every need that you [music] have, all you have to do is just give to him. And Lord, [music] you will fulfill it. Father, we want to give you the honor and the glory. In the name of Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; an amen.
