[0:00] guards. 2 Corinthians chapter 11:es
[0:03] 1 to4
[0:06] says, "Would to God you could bear with
[0:08] me a little in my folly and indeed bear
[0:11] with me for I am jealous over you with
[0:14] godly jealousy jealousy for I have
[0:17] espoused you to one husband that I may
[0:19] present you as a chasteed virgin to
[0:22] Christ." It's very uh weighty words that
[0:24] Paul is using. uh you've been uh
[0:27] committed to, promised to your a
[0:29] husband, which is Christ. And he uses
[0:31] the image of a chased virgin being
[0:33] presented to her bridegroom. He says,
[0:36] "But I fear lest by any means as the
[0:38] serpent begal Eve through his subtlety,
[0:40] so your mind should be corrupted from
[0:43] the simplicity that is in Christ. For if
[0:46] he that cometh preacheth another Jesus
[0:48] whom we have not preached, or if you
[0:49] receive another spirit which you have
[0:51] not received, or another gospel which
[0:53] you have not accepted, you might well
[0:55] bear with him. Amen. You may be seated.
[1:01] I want to title this the end of the
[1:03] beginning. And uh part of that title or
[1:06] subtitle you could call is now it's
[1:08] complicated. And um I think I think what
[1:11] we're ministering on today will be a
[1:14] relatable for all of us. But we've been
[1:16] ministering on in the beginning. We
[1:18] started that in July and then we just
[1:20] were walking through that subject. In
[1:21] the beginning, God created and we were
[1:24] in the last several services looking how
[1:26] that God the climax of that we read in
[1:28] Genesis chapter 2 on how that God
[1:31] brought forth a family, a man and a
[1:32] woman. In the beginning, God created the
[1:34] heavens and the earth. that even
[1:36] foreshadowed uh a husband and wife. We
[1:39] know in spiritual type and ultimate
[1:41] fulfillment, not just spiritual type,
[1:42] but even in the full type that
[1:44] represents Christ and his bride and the
[1:46] eighth day and the eternity that we'll
[1:48] be living in. And I feel in my heart
[1:51] that we have we're transitioning for a
[1:52] little bit to a different subject. And
[1:55] Wednesday night, I there was just a a
[1:56] burden that was delivered, I think, to
[1:58] maybe seal off that thought of in the
[2:00] beginning, uh God created a family. And
[2:03] now I want to God's been dealing with my
[2:05] heart on a subject matter and I'd like
[2:07] to begin uh to open it up and just use
[2:10] this title the end of the beginning and
[2:13] then now it's complicated and when we've
[2:16] um we still have this burden to minister
[2:18] on the subject of family and we'll
[2:19] probably be going in that direction and
[2:20] as we've been ministering on it and
[2:22] looking into it uh myself personally and
[2:25] even I noticed in the things that God
[2:26] was uh burdening me with to minister the
[2:29] things that were ministered we kept
[2:30] bumping into the complexities of the
[2:32] time that we're now living in. And we
[2:35] can honestly say, and I think we could
[2:37] all agree, that nothing seems simple.
[2:39] That every situation we hear of and each
[2:42] scenario that um we find out people are
[2:44] in or the circumstances that they're in,
[2:46] uh things don't really seem as cut and
[2:48] dry as maybe we might initially think
[2:50] they should be in our minds. And
[2:53] everything is not just complex. And as
[2:55] we could say that in terms of the
[2:57] complexities of this life, the age that
[2:59] we're living in, everything's not just
[3:00] complex, but it's complicated.
[3:03] And I'm I'm going to make a difference.
[3:04] And you might say, well, that's just
[3:06] semantics, so they could be used
[3:07] interchangeably. Just to be able to uh
[3:10] make a point and do it succinctly. I
[3:12] want to I don't want to use them
[3:13] interchangeably. I want to say that
[3:15] things are things are complex, but
[3:17] they're not just complex, they're
[3:18] complicated. And in looking at that, I
[3:21] think that if things are simple, they're
[3:23] clear and they're understandable.
[3:25] Something's simple, maybe it's very it
[3:26] has some very basic components. It's
[3:28] relatable. And if something's complex,
[3:31] you can say, "Well, it requires special
[3:32] skill." But it doesn't necessarily mean
[3:34] it's complicated. And an example you
[3:37] might think of is if uh if you if you
[3:40] step into a cockpit and you look at a
[3:41] cockpit, to you, you say, "Well, that's
[3:43] very complicated." Uh uh or this is this
[3:46] is something that it doesn't make any
[3:47] sense to but to brother John or brother
[3:50] James who are captains, they would look
[3:51] at it and be like, "Oh, no. It makes
[3:53] sense. Everything's right where it needs
[3:54] to be. We're trained for this. It's not
[3:56] complicated, but it is a complex system.
[3:59] And so things can be simple and even
[4:01] being simple, they can be complex. And
[4:04] there's a difference between being
[4:05] complex which might have uh many
[4:08] different parts or interconnected parts
[4:09] or something that's very intricate and
[4:11] complicated. So if I say complex, I'm
[4:14] not saying complicated. I mean it just
[4:15] may have different layers to it,
[4:17] different components, different parts.
[4:19] And maybe it takes more understanding to
[4:21] to know it and and to be able to
[4:22] comprehend it. But if it's complicated,
[4:25] it's confusing.
[4:26] If it's complicated, it's difficult. If
[4:28] it's complicated, maybe things don't
[4:29] fit. If it's complicated, maybe these
[4:32] things don't belong together. And so,
[4:34] we're looking at how that we live in a
[4:35] complex time. And not only is it
[4:37] complex, but it's complicated. And this
[4:40] is my my burden. Through the word of
[4:42] God, we can find simplicity in the midst
[4:44] of a complex life.
[4:46] Just the complexities of life. It's
[4:47] through the word of God that we can find
[4:49] the simplicity. And it's only through
[4:51] the word of God that we could really
[4:53] understand or resolve or work through
[4:55] complications. And so that's uh that's
[4:57] kind of the basis that we're wanting to
[4:59] look at. It's only through the word of
[5:01] God that we can face things that seem
[5:03] very complex or things that we know are
[5:05] complicated and be able to navigate
[5:07] that. In Isaiah 33:6, it says, "And
[5:11] wisdom and knowledge shall be the
[5:13] stability of thy times and the strength
[5:16] of salvation. The fear of the Lord is
[5:18] his treasure." Just even that statement
[5:21] alone, the fear of the Lord is your
[5:22] storehouse. The fear of the Lord is your
[5:24] supply. All that pertains to life, all
[5:26] that pertains to health and happiness,
[5:28] the fear of the Lord is your storehouse
[5:30] for that. It's the very beginning. It's
[5:32] the very basis upon which we we start
[5:34] our days. It's the very basis upon which
[5:36] we serve God. We say, "The fear of the
[5:38] Lord is the beginning of wisdom. The
[5:40] fear of the Lord is my storehouse. It is
[5:42] my treasure. It's what's going to
[5:43] sustain me. It's going to be what leads
[5:44] me and guides me." And it says, "And
[5:47] wisdom and knowledge shall be the
[5:48] stability of thy times and strength of
[5:50] salvation." And so that wisdom is
[5:53] prudence. It's skill. It's to be shrewd.
[5:56] Could simply just say to be wise. To be
[5:58] wise shall be the stability of that
[6:00] times. And knowledge. It speaks of
[6:02] perception and dist discernment. Wisdom
[6:05] and knowledge shall be uh this
[6:07] discernment. The shrewdness, this
[6:08] prudent, the skill shall be the
[6:10] stability. That's your firmness, your
[6:13] steadfastness. Even your trust or your
[6:15] confidence. What's going to be your
[6:16] support? What are you going to rely on?
[6:19] Are you going to rely on the price of
[6:20] GameStop stock?
[6:22] All right.
[6:24] you know, are you going to are you going
[6:25] to be able to hold? Are you going to are
[6:26] you going to be able to just leave all
[6:28] your money in that? What are you relying
[6:29] in? What are you trusting in? What is it
[6:30] you're looking at as the benchmark for
[6:32] whether or not life is successful?
[6:34] What's your trust? And that's what it
[6:35] says, wisdom and knowledge shall be the
[6:37] support or trust of our times. And this
[6:40] means anytime
[6:42] shall be the stability of our times. Not
[6:43] just a particular time, maybe sometime
[6:45] in the future, but for your experiences,
[6:47] for your situation, for your
[6:48] circumstance. Wisdom and knowledge shall
[6:50] be the stability of thy times, of your
[6:53] season that you're in, the circumstance
[6:55] you're in, your experience, whatever
[6:56] you're experiencing, whatever your
[6:58] occasion might be. Wisdom and knowledge
[7:00] are the stability of that.
[7:03] And not only is it the stability of that
[7:05] times, but it's the strength of your
[7:06] salvation, the treasure or wealth speaks
[7:10] of something being stored up. You want
[7:12] to have something stored up. You want to
[7:13] have something laid up. the riches and
[7:15] treasures and wealth, something stored
[7:16] up of salvation, of your deliverance.
[7:19] Wisdom and knowledge is the storehouse
[7:21] for your deliverance. Wisdom and
[7:23] knowledge are the storehouse uh for your
[7:25] prosperity, for for your welfare. And
[7:28] this might seem something that I want to
[7:29] be able to put my hands on. I want to be
[7:31] able to look at it and look at a bank
[7:32] statement. I want to be able to look at
[7:34] provision. I want to see a car. I want
[7:36] to see a house. I want to see a job
[7:37] offer. And uh that that's not what's
[7:40] going to be your stability. Wisdom and
[7:42] knowledge can give you steadfastness,
[7:44] give you confidence, and give you
[7:45] support and nourishment in the absence
[7:48] of those things.
[7:49] You could actually look at a bank
[7:50] statement, be like, "Man, there's not
[7:51] much in there." You could look at a pink
[7:52] slip, you get de dismissed from your
[7:54] job, but wisdom and knowledge, I will
[7:56] give you uh something that will uh uh
[7:59] lead you and guide you and help you to
[8:02] navigate from that difficulty or that
[8:04] loss and come through on the other side
[8:06] and realize God has preserved you. God
[8:08] has taken care of you.
[8:10] And when you ponder the
[8:13] where we're living and and the age we're
[8:15] living in, we're living in a chaotic
[8:17] time, very confusing time. It's a time
[8:19] that's uncertain. There's always uh
[8:22] there's anymore now it seems to be that
[8:24] there's a a large movement that is uh
[8:28] believes that there's going to be uh
[8:30] rioting and there's going to be um
[8:32] you're not going to have any more coins
[8:33] in our pocket and you need to stockpile
[8:36] things and you need to prep for uh riots
[8:38] in the street and uh Russian tanks
[8:40] driving down uh down our city blocks and
[8:43] and and this is something that you
[8:44] think, oh well that just that just seems
[8:46] some kind of wild conspiracy theory, but
[8:48] it's starting to take root in millions
[8:50] of people's minds.
[8:51] uh these things can gain such traction
[8:53] through social media and especially the
[8:55] context that it comes in. You're just a
[8:57] you're just a stay-at-home mom and
[8:59] you're just a homeschool mom and all of
[9:00] a sudden somebody you really like starts
[9:02] saying, "Did you hear this and did you
[9:03] hear that?" And without any need to
[9:05] check it or verify, you go, "I can't
[9:07] believe that. That's absolutely insane.
[9:09] They're really going to do that. That's
[9:10] really going to happen." And then it
[9:12] just kind of starts spreading because it
[9:13] comes from a confident source. And
[9:15] people are people are are fearful of
[9:17] things coming and fearful of things
[9:19] happening. And I'm not saying that it's
[9:21] not going to happen. I'm just saying
[9:22] these things are gripping the nation and
[9:24] gripping the world. And it's a very
[9:26] uncertain time.
[9:28] And then even outside of maybe those
[9:30] realms of fearful things that might
[9:32] happen and suspicions of collapses and
[9:34] economic chaos or political chaos or a
[9:37] divided United States uh between a
[9:39] corporation and and a country or
[9:41] whatever the the theories might be. Uh
[9:43] even if you just took issues that we try
[9:46] to personally uh uh um uh handle in our
[9:49] individual lives, issues are so
[9:51] polarized
[9:53] where people are just entrenched on one
[9:55] side and others are entrenched on
[9:56] another side and they seem so polarized
[9:59] that when you hear of it, well some
[10:00] people believe this and some people
[10:02] believe that and you don't know anything
[10:04] about it. So you say, well, I'm well
[10:05] then what side should I be on? And you
[10:07] start looking at it and you realize
[10:08] people are polarized but this isn't cut
[10:10] and dry. People have built their camps
[10:13] and put their period on and built their
[10:15] walls, but you start looking at go, man,
[10:16] I don't I don't really know. I mean,
[10:18] both sides make a very good point. Where
[10:19] do you come down on this and how should
[10:21] we approach this? That's the kind of
[10:23] time that we're living in.
[10:25] Where there was a I'll say it this way.
[10:26] There was a time where maybe you didn't
[10:28] have to have an opinion and maybe you
[10:30] didn't have an opinion, but it's getting
[10:32] to the place where it's almost like
[10:33] you're going to be forced
[10:34] to give your opinion,
[10:35] right?
[10:36] Or you're going to be forced, well, you
[10:37] can't be on the sidelines. You got to
[10:38] say something. Which way? Which side do
[10:40] you stand on? Why is it you're not
[10:41] flying this flag? Or why is it you're
[10:43] not doing that? Why don't you have this
[10:44] avatar? Why aren't you doing this? Why
[10:46] aren't you doing? And there's going to
[10:47] be increased pressure on us whereas at
[10:49] one time you could just exist.
[10:51] But now it seems like it's becoming so
[10:53] wretched up the pressure, the
[10:55] uncertainty, the confusion that exists.
[10:58] And brother Brandham when he's writing
[11:00] about the Thoturan church age and he's
[11:03] saying I'll get it's using the scripture
[11:05] about I won't place upon you any more
[11:06] burden. Brother Brandham says each age
[11:09] had its pressures. And so he's not just
[11:11] looking at um that age, but now he says,
[11:14] for example, a great burden. And now he
[11:16] says burden. This is a singular burden.
[11:19] So that's very simple. One burden. It's
[11:20] a singular burden. But notice how
[11:22] complex it is because it has different
[11:24] parts. A great burden of the last age is
[11:28] the pressure of riches, soft living, and
[11:31] nervous tensions. So this is one burden.
[11:34] It's all kind of mixed in together. It
[11:35] has so much different ways that you
[11:38] could approach this. the pressure of
[11:39] riches, soft living, and nervous
[11:41] tensions. That's the burden of this age.
[11:44] I can give an amen to that. The
[11:46] pressures of of of possessions, the
[11:49] pressures of increase, the pressures of
[11:51] soft living, the pressure of nervous
[11:53] tensions, these are all things that
[11:54] characterize the age that we're living
[11:56] in. Now, this could be said about the
[11:58] church or the the the Leodysian church,
[12:01] the nominal church world, the professing
[12:03] church. But this characterizes the
[12:05] entire world. This characterizes the
[12:07] entire uh uh the entire cosmos and
[12:10] everyone that lives in every system and
[12:12] every political structure in all human
[12:14] beings upon the earth. These are things
[12:15] that are pressing in upon them. The
[12:17] pressure of riches, soft living and
[12:18] nervous tensions. And if that wasn't bad
[12:20] enough, he says in a complex age,
[12:23] right?
[12:23] So we have the pressure of riches. We
[12:25] have the pressure of soft living. We
[12:27] have nervous tensions. We have all these
[12:29] things that are a burden and a weight to
[12:31] us. And it's not just that we're
[12:33] navigating that in an age that's very
[12:35] simple, very straightforward, and an
[12:37] atmosphere that's very that's conducive
[12:39] to change and can enable us to to deal
[12:41] with these pressures. He says it's a
[12:43] complex age. He says that we seem
[12:45] unfitted to live in. We're not fit to
[12:48] live in this complex age. Man doesn't
[12:50] even seem like they're handling this
[12:52] very well, but yet this is the age that
[12:54] we live in. And so, how do we live under
[12:57] this burden of a complex age without it
[12:59] being complicated? How is it that we as
[13:02] Christians can look at all the issues
[13:03] that we face, the decisions that we have
[13:05] to make and then make h make those
[13:07] decisions fit within the context of
[13:09] making a living? Those decisions fit
[13:11] within the context of of social
[13:13] pressures and the context of family and
[13:15] extended family and all these pressures
[13:18] and all these things that we're trying
[13:19] to navigate. How do we make these
[13:21] decisions and not just get by, but
[13:23] actually have a full life and thrive?
[13:26] We want to navigate it. We want to be
[13:27] able to make our way through these
[13:28] decisions. We want to make the right
[13:30] decisions, but I don't want to just kind
[13:31] of escape on the other side, just kind
[13:33] of barely hanging on. I want to live a
[13:35] full life. I I want to be successful in
[13:38] a godly way. So, how do we go through
[13:40] these things and navigate these
[13:42] complexities as family, as husband, as
[13:44] wife, as children, as a family of God?
[13:46] How is it that we go forward and are
[13:49] able to live a life pleasing to the Lord
[13:51] in an age of so much pressure and
[13:53] complicated burdens and nervous tensions
[13:56] that exist that brother Van we've
[13:57] acknowledged you're not really fit to
[13:59] live in this complex age and I believe
[14:01] the answer is found in the ending of the
[14:03] beginning that as we've been looking at
[14:06] Genesis chapter 1 2 and 3 we can go
[14:08] right back to these very same chapters
[14:10] and look at the end of the beginning at
[14:13] the very time when humanity descended
[14:15] into confusion it descended descended
[14:16] into hardship and chaos. It's right at
[14:18] that juncture in that time where you can
[14:20] find the key to navigating the
[14:22] complexities of life.
[14:25] In Genesis chapter 2 25, we'll start
[14:27] here and just kind of make our way
[14:29] through the next several verses into
[14:31] chapter 3. in Genesis chapter 2 verse
[14:34] 25.
[14:38] So that was that's kind of my foundation
[14:42] on
[14:43] the how we've led to this point and and
[14:46] there's so there's this overlap and a
[14:48] blending in with the the series on the
[14:51] family and then and looking at this the
[14:54] end of the beginning now it's
[14:55] complicated. We're looking at how the
[14:56] the ending of the beginning here into
[14:59] Genesis chapter 3. So, Genesis chapter 2
[15:02] verse 25 says, "And they were both
[15:04] naked, the man and his wife, and were
[15:07] not ashamed." So, here's the masterpiece
[15:09] family, Adam and the woman, dwelling in
[15:12] the garden. Every seed is bringing forth
[15:14] of its kind. Uh it nothing else could
[15:16] happen because God said it would be that
[15:18] way. They had perfect love, a perfect
[15:20] understanding of the love of God. They
[15:22] had perfect love for one another. And
[15:24] and these are all the ways that Brother
[15:25] Abraham described this beautiful Eden.
[15:28] And they were both naked, the man and
[15:29] his wife. That's the family. The man and
[15:31] his wife were both naked and they were
[15:33] not ashamed. It's a very simple
[15:36] statement yet it's very elegant and
[15:39] extremely deep. Uh it's multifaceted.
[15:42] There's so many different things that
[15:43] are contained in this. God's trying to
[15:44] convey an image or a picture by this
[15:48] verse. And so it's something that we
[15:49] could read and say the man and the woman
[15:51] were naked and they were not ashamed. It
[15:52] seems very simple but yet there's a lot
[15:54] of meaning to it. So it's complex. And
[15:57] this simple sentence is the only
[15:59] sentence we have to describe the
[16:01] existence of the man and the woman
[16:02] before the fall.
[16:04] If you want to if you want to read in
[16:06] the other passages, we see God is
[16:08] describing moments and instances and
[16:11] certain events and general commandments
[16:12] that he's given them. But in terms of
[16:14] describing them, you say, "Well, he
[16:16] placed the man in the garden to dress it
[16:17] and keep it." He's describing an
[16:19] instance. We can draw man's duties and
[16:22] obligations from that. He talks about
[16:23] how man was naming all the animals and
[16:25] all the creatures. We could draw an
[16:27] image of man living. But when God says,
[16:29] "It's all done. It's all finished." And
[16:31] he's trying to tell us what it looked
[16:32] like and what was happening. This is the
[16:34] only phrase he uses. This is the only
[16:36] glimpse that we have of the man and the
[16:38] woman in a perfect eating in a perfect
[16:40] garden. It says they were both naked and
[16:42] were not ashamed.
[16:44] Now, this description means something
[16:46] entirely different today. So, if you say
[16:47] somebody is naked, uh that would mean
[16:49] that it has a very distinct meaning to
[16:52] us. It mean they didn't have any clothes
[16:53] on. And the word naked is means bare. It
[16:56] actually comes from the root in the
[16:58] Hebrew uh to be per uh perceptive and to
[17:01] have some sort of awareness. But yet it
[17:03] means that they were bare. Now this
[17:05] definitely has a physical application
[17:07] because it wasn't that they even had
[17:08] need to be protected from elements or
[17:10] the sun and it wasn't cold so that they
[17:12] needed a sweater and it wasn't um hot so
[17:14] they needed uh they needed to cover
[17:16] their skin to avoid skin cancer. They
[17:18] they didn't have the need to cover the
[17:21] skin. They were covered with skin and
[17:24] they didn't have need of clothing. And
[17:26] there's a so there's an application that
[17:29] God is not describing them as of wearing
[17:31] physical material or natural material,
[17:33] but it's more descriptive of their
[17:34] spirits,
[17:36] more descriptive of their mindset and
[17:38] their emotions. They were naked and not
[17:40] ashamed. That means to be disconcerted
[17:42] or disappointed. They weren't
[17:44] uncomfortable. They were naked. And I
[17:46] really want you to enter into this
[17:48] because we uh we all know that we're
[17:50] living in a chaotic time, a confusing
[17:52] time. We know the world that we're
[17:53] living in and we're we're posing the
[17:55] question, how is it that I can live in
[17:57] such an uncertain, ungodly time where
[18:00] there's so much pressure and there's so
[18:02] many choices and there's so many things
[18:03] that we're trying to figure out and ways
[18:05] to go and what to do. Uh we're looking
[18:07] back at the beginning to see here's this
[18:11] beautiful Eden and then how it
[18:12] transforms. And in there, I believe we
[18:14] can get an answer. But I want you to
[18:16] ponder it right now. At the very end of
[18:18] Genesis chapter 2, the man and the woman
[18:20] are in the garden. They're living in
[18:22] perfect harmony, in perfect peace.
[18:23] There's no confusion
[18:25] that they're they're not waking up. They
[18:27] don't have that feeling where they woke
[18:28] up in the morning. Where am I? You know,
[18:30] what hotel am I in now? And you know,
[18:33] and there was no confusion. There was no
[18:35] disorientation. There was no stress.
[18:39] Neither woke up in the morning and
[18:41] thought to themselves, "Oh, I've got to
[18:42] get this done and I've got to get that
[18:44] done and I I wonder whether or not we're
[18:45] going to be able to do this and is there
[18:47] going to be enough time in the day."
[18:48] There was no stress involved with their
[18:50] labor.
[18:52] And the man and the woman, they there
[18:54] was not it wasn't they had to make a lot
[18:55] of choices throughout the day of in
[18:57] terms of wow, we got to do this and
[18:59] which one should we do and which way
[19:00] should we go and how should we handle
[19:02] this and how we should handle that.
[19:03] Those things just came naturally to
[19:05] them.
[19:06] And in that that lack of confusion and
[19:09] lack of stress, there was no anxiety for
[19:11] the things they lacked. You can say,
[19:13] "Well, they didn't have children." They
[19:15] didn't worry about it. They weren't
[19:17] trying to figure out, "I wonder if we're
[19:18] able to have children, and I wonder if
[19:19] we should have children, and if we have
[19:21] children, what should we name them?"
[19:22] Adam would be like, "You see who you're
[19:24] talking to? I'm the namer.
[19:27] I got this. This is what I do. I name
[19:29] things." It was there was there was no
[19:32] stress uh involved. And then the things
[19:34] that they may have lacked. You say,
[19:35] "Well, how did they lack?" Well, we know
[19:36] there was promises that needed to be
[19:38] fulfilled. But yet there was no anxiety
[19:40] for those things.
[19:42] And the Bible saying they were not
[19:44] ashamed. They didn't know what shame
[19:46] was.
[19:48] They were in this. And I want you to
[19:49] ponder this very deeply. Put kind of put
[19:51] yourselves in their shoes if you could.
[19:53] They were unconscious of evil.
[19:56] And not and since there was no sin and
[19:59] no consciousness of evil, there was
[20:00] nothing to hide from.
[20:02] There was nothing to worry about. There
[20:04] was nothing lurking around the corner to
[20:06] them. All was very innocent.
[20:09] Everything was friendly. The man and the
[20:11] woman could be walking through creation
[20:13] through the expanse of it. Not if we
[20:15] want to just say not just even in the
[20:16] garden, through the expanse of the
[20:18] creation and they could encounter any
[20:20] beast and it wouldn't be like, "Oh no,
[20:21] it's a lion." And they they they knew
[20:24] that this was something they there was a
[20:26] familiarity. There was nothing strange.
[20:28] There was nothing out of place.
[20:30] Everything was friendly. Everything was
[20:31] innocent. And despite how complex and
[20:34] beautiful and intricate God's creation
[20:37] was, it was simple.
[20:40] All things were honest. Everything was
[20:43] pure. They had they had an understanding
[20:45] of the nature of the plan of God. There
[20:47] was this continuity between them and the
[20:49] creator. There was continuity between
[20:51] them and the creation. They'd been set
[20:53] as those who would have dominion over
[20:54] it. And it wasn't like ruthless
[20:56] dictatorship. There was harmony and
[20:58] continuity. And everything was working
[20:59] together, perfectly harmonious between
[21:01] each other. The man and the woman
[21:03] working in harmony. They were in harmony
[21:05] with creation, the beautiful uh headship
[21:07] of God over them. They were in harmony
[21:09] with God. And I'm wanting you just to
[21:12] think more. You say, "Brother," and you
[21:13] just keep describing it a different
[21:14] ways. Well, I I want to kind of just
[21:16] paint this picture. You know how when
[21:18] you're you're setting up a new device,
[21:19] all you who went out and got the iPhone
[21:21] 12 and uh and and you want and it wants
[21:24] to set the facial recognition, what do
[21:25] you have to do? You have to keep kind of
[21:26] turning it different ways. I don't know
[21:27] if that's how it works on iPhone 12. I
[21:30] don't have one.
[21:32] Uh but I said one time somewhere that I
[21:34] I was enjoying my iPhone 14 and
[21:36] afterwards everyone's like, "Where did
[21:37] you get it? How did this happen? Is this
[21:39] something you can do in America? What's
[21:40] taking place here?" And so you you have
[21:42] to move it different ways to get the
[21:44] full image in order to unlock the phone.
[21:46] So if I if I say it just a little bit
[21:47] different, we're wanting to complete the
[21:49] picture. I want you to fully grasp and
[21:51] understand what's transpiring. Think
[21:53] about this. Enter into it. begin to
[21:54] ponder it because it's so easy just to
[21:57] read through it and you're just kind of
[21:58] you're just kind of skipping over it and
[22:00] you're not creating this image in your
[22:02] mind. You're not really entering into
[22:04] the fellowship of the state of existence
[22:06] that they would have been in in the
[22:08] garden. Nothing was out of place.
[22:11] There was no surprises.
[22:13] There was nothing that was sinful. There
[22:15] was nothing that was fallen. There was
[22:17] nothing that was defective.
[22:19] So there was no competition among the
[22:21] species. There was no competition among
[22:24] creation. There was no uh uh there was
[22:26] nothing that would would be defective or
[22:29] something that would be ugly or
[22:30] uncumbly. It was all in God's creation.
[22:33] It all had a part and it all had a
[22:34] purpose. The Bible's saying they were
[22:37] naked, the man and his wife, and were
[22:38] not ashamed. It was a just a very simple
[22:41] ignorance of the nature of evil.
[22:44] Like the innocence of childhood,
[22:47] a child doesn't feel any shame when
[22:49] they're naked. I say a child, let me
[22:50] moderate this, maybe a an infant, a very
[22:52] young toddler, right? They only develop
[22:55] a sense of shame because there's a
[22:56] certain age where like you put your
[22:57] clothes on and like, oh, well, this was
[23:00] good not too long ago and you laughed
[23:02] and you thought it was cute. You're
[23:04] like, let me get my camera, but now it's
[23:06] not cool anymore. All right, I just need
[23:07] to know that. And they develop a sense
[23:09] of shame because of our shock and horror
[23:11] when they stop abiding by, you know, the
[23:14] this is the now's the time to put pants
[23:16] on, honey. Uh, and so there's no there's
[23:18] no guilt or shame to kids even about
[23:21] their nakedness. Why? Everything's pure.
[23:24] Everything's innocent. It's amazing just
[23:26] how even as they grow, there's certain
[23:28] things that you can read in the Bible
[23:29] and you read it and you're like,
[23:32] you want to read a lot faster, but they
[23:34] don't they're just listening.
[23:38] Wow. And they want to ask a question.
[23:40] So, how did they get that back? And
[23:42] you're like, oh, good. They want to ask
[23:44] a question. and you just want to keep
[23:45] reading, but they're innocent. There's
[23:48] no guile. There's no evil. There's no
[23:50] association. There's no way for them to
[23:51] go that's in the Bible
[23:56] because that's the innocent of ch
[23:57] innocence of childhood. There's no sense
[23:59] of shame. There's no sense of guilt.
[24:01] There's no knowledge of evil. That
[24:03] doesn't mean there's not the instinct to
[24:05] do evil and instincts to lie. It talks
[24:07] about the consciousness. Their their
[24:09] minds they were naked and not ashamed.
[24:11] And on this innocence of childhood, Paul
[24:13] writes it this way in Romans chapter 16
[24:16] verses 18 to 19. And in this it's uh
[24:21] it helps us to understand even how the
[24:23] man and the woman would have been. He
[24:24] says, "For they that are are such serve
[24:26] not our Lord Jesus Christ but their own
[24:28] belly, these ungodly defilers, and by
[24:31] good words and fair speeches deceive the
[24:34] hearts of the simple." Now Paul is
[24:37] actually using a language to describe
[24:40] how that people were being deceived by
[24:43] good words and fair speeches. And he
[24:45] says it's the hearts which is the
[24:47] thinking the the sincerity of the
[24:50] simple. It's the harmless.
[24:53] So here they're just harmless. They're
[24:55] unsuspecting. They're innocent. They
[24:56] don't think any evil. They're not really
[24:57] even aware of any evil. So they're not
[24:59] they're not on guard because they're
[25:01] going to be conned. They're very
[25:02] trusting. But people use good words and
[25:04] fair speeches and they deceive the heart
[25:06] of the simple because they're just
[25:08] trusting. They're not harmful
[25:10] themselves. So they just perceive you as
[25:12] not being harmful. They're very trusting
[25:14] and and and open. But then he says, "For
[25:17] your obedience has come abroad unto all
[25:19] men. I am glad therefore on your behalf,
[25:21] but yet I would have you wise unto that
[25:24] which is good and simple concerning
[25:27] evil." So now there's the hearts of the
[25:30] simp. The hearts of the simple were uh
[25:32] uh were deceived with good words and
[25:34] fair speeches. So he says, "Then I want
[25:35] you to be wise unto that which is good."
[25:37] The wisdom of that which is good. Your
[25:39] knowledge of that which is good is going
[25:41] to be a discernment to you. It's going
[25:42] to be a strength to you. I want to have
[25:43] this maturity and this growth of your
[25:45] knowledge and understanding. So that
[25:47] good words and fair speeches, you have a
[25:49] filter to be like, uh, that doesn't seem
[25:51] right. But then it's not just the matter
[25:53] of being wise under that which is good,
[25:55] but simple, pure, and innocent
[25:57] concerning that which is evil. pure and
[25:59] innocent without evil,
[26:01] not experiencing evil, not being uh
[26:04] coming into a knowledge of evil because
[26:05] of your discernment and your wisdom. I
[26:07] want you to be wise concerning that
[26:09] which is good because that you might be
[26:11] simple, not mixed, not joined to, not
[26:15] wrestling with, not having it swn into
[26:16] your spirits and in your minds and your
[26:18] thought process of any kind of evil.
[26:21] And that's exactly how the man and his
[26:23] wife were. They they didn't have
[26:24] thoughts of evil. They didn't they
[26:27] didn't have anything to where they're
[26:28] trying to to get over this and trying to
[26:30] figure that out and like I wonder what
[26:31] they meant by this and I wonder what
[26:33] this situation means and it was just
[26:35] they were pure. It was innocent.
[26:38] And the image of God that was upon the
[26:39] man and his wife was a robe of purity.
[26:42] They had a holy image. It was draped
[26:44] over them. It was a robe of innocence.
[26:46] It was a robe of righteousness. It was
[26:48] something that they bore in their
[26:50] person.
[26:51] And so the holy image of God clothed
[26:53] them. And with this holy image of God
[26:56] and this perfect connection with God,
[26:58] the only knowledge they had of evil was
[27:00] the knowledge given to them by the word.
[27:03] So you say, well, they were they
[27:05] completely and wholly ignorant of evil.
[27:06] No, they had a knowledge of evil, but
[27:09] their knowledge of evil was only
[27:10] informed by what God had said about it.
[27:14] In other words, whatever God said that
[27:16] apprised them of its existence or
[27:17] apprised them of its danger. And
[27:19] whatever his word said was enough.
[27:22] In other words, if God says, you know,
[27:24] don't eat that, it's poison. You go, hm,
[27:27] poison.
[27:29] Oh, God, you're right. Oh, that's nasty,
[27:32] right? And that's almost the way we
[27:33] relate to our children. Don't touch
[27:34] that. It's hot. They're like hot and
[27:37] they just want to do it. But Adam and
[27:39] the woman, they had this simplicity to
[27:41] them to where if God said something,
[27:43] they accepted it. They believed it. That
[27:45] was the knowledge that they had. That's
[27:46] the only channel through which they had
[27:47] received knowledge. And so the only way
[27:49] that they knew of evil was through what
[27:52] God had already said. Genesis chapter 2
[27:55] 16 and 17. And the Lord God commanded
[27:57] the man saying of every tree of the
[28:00] garden of that of the garden thou mayest
[28:02] freely eat. So it says every tree of the
[28:05] garden thou mayest freely eat. So now
[28:07] every tree and it supposes that even the
[28:09] tree of life would be um suggested in
[28:12] this. Every tree in the garden thou
[28:14] mayest freely eat. But verse 17, but of
[28:16] the tree of the knowledge of good and
[28:18] evil, thou shalt not eat of it, for in
[28:21] the day that thou eatest thereof, thou
[28:23] shalt surely die. So in this perfect
[28:27] Eden, Genesis chapter 2 16 to1 17. So
[28:30] we're now now we're everything's being
[28:32] fully developed of the things that were
[28:34] created in those six days and we're
[28:36] getting very specific glimpses into the
[28:37] things that they would have been told
[28:38] and the things that they would have
[28:40] known. He's saying, "Look, you can eat
[28:41] of everything that's in the garden, but
[28:43] there's one thing you can't eat of." And
[28:45] it uses this language, the tree of
[28:46] knowledge of good and evil. Don't eat
[28:48] that because if you eat it, you'll die.
[28:52] And so, the knowledge and understanding
[28:53] that they had of good came from God. The
[28:55] knowledge that they had of evil was
[28:58] framed by God. They didn't have to know
[29:00] exactly what evil was. They just had to
[29:02] know not to partake of this tree of the
[29:05] knowledge of good and evil. That they
[29:07] could not partake of this mixed tree.
[29:09] don't don't eat of its fruit. Don't go
[29:11] in that direction. And that was enough
[29:13] to them.
[29:14] And so I and I think this is how I
[29:16] pondered and I began to think about it
[29:18] in the sense of he's telling them here
[29:20] of every tree you can eat and of the
[29:21] tree of knowledge of good and evil you
[29:22] can't eat of eat of. There was something
[29:24] represented in that that God is
[29:26] conveying and the language he's using
[29:28] that the tree of knowledge of good and
[29:30] evil, it represented something
[29:31] distressful.
[29:33] It represented something disagreeable.
[29:35] It represented something unhappy. But
[29:37] they didn't have to know what those
[29:39] emotions were. God just used a language
[29:42] and gave them understanding that what
[29:44] that is is something you don't want
[29:46] because if you eat it, you're going to
[29:47] die.
[29:48] And it represented something in
[29:50] congruent to them. It could have been
[29:52] that even as he described it to them,
[29:53] they were like, "Well, that doesn't even
[29:55] make sense, so we don't want it." A tree
[29:57] of knowledge of good and evil. What is
[29:59] evil? What does that even mean? And it
[30:01] wasn't that they had to probe and figure
[30:03] it out and and try, "Well, what does God
[30:04] mean by that?" I mean it's what they say
[30:06] that if you tell someone not to do
[30:08] something what do they do right like
[30:10] don't look at that right and everyone
[30:12] woo don't look now but there's someone
[30:15] where
[30:17] it's the way it works every time but
[30:19] because it's almost like the very
[30:21] prohibition the very rais but there
[30:22] wasn't that instinct in the man and the
[30:24] woman it was they were told of something
[30:26] and they held that in their hearts
[30:27] according to the word of God and so they
[30:29] only saw through the understanding that
[30:30] God had given them they didn't have
[30:33] another filter
[30:35] God didn't say, "Hey, listen. You can
[30:37] eat of every tree in the garden and then
[30:39] of the tree of knowledge of good and
[30:40] evil, if you eat it, you're going to
[30:41] die." Okay. Well, let me Google that.
[30:44] Let me just really see what what have
[30:45] they said about whether or not if you
[30:47] eat this, you're going to die. There
[30:48] wasn't somebody else you could ask.
[30:49] Well, what's your take on this? Every
[30:51] tree. What does every tree mean? What
[30:53] does the lexicon say? Does does Haley
[30:55] have this in his his book? And does this
[30:57] commentator what did what did Matthew
[30:59] Henry have to say about it? There was
[31:01] nothing else to filter it through. has
[31:03] the pope weighed in on this tree? It was
[31:05] just God, the understanding they gave
[31:07] him. There was no other filter. There
[31:08] was no other paradigm
[31:10] that there wasn't a saber metrics that
[31:12] existed in the garden. Well, what's the
[31:14] right decision? How should we do this?
[31:15] Or what are the market inefficiencies we
[31:17] can capitalize on? They were just
[31:18] living.
[31:21] No other filter, no other view, no other
[31:23] paradigm to try to make sense of the
[31:25] world that we're living in other than
[31:26] what God said. God said we could eat all
[31:29] these. He said not to eat that. That
[31:30] makes sense. we accept it. They didn't
[31:32] have to come up with some kind of
[31:34] structure or some kind of mode or way of
[31:37] thinking or some kind of overarching
[31:39] theme to be able to explain why they
[31:41] were existing in the world that they
[31:43] were existing and why they could eat
[31:45] these but they couldn't eat that one.
[31:46] God said it, they accepted it and that's
[31:48] what they live by.
[31:50] Man, it's just so powerful to think of
[31:51] it in that way. Brother Brandham says in
[31:54] the in the message, God's power to
[31:55] transform. And he makes this statement
[31:57] in a couple other places in this similar
[31:59] subject matter that he was ministering
[32:01] on. In the Garden of Eden was God's
[32:03] economy of innocence. It's a a wonderful
[32:07] phrase. God's economy of innocence. And
[32:09] that was one of the dispensations. The
[32:12] first dispensation was innocence. That's
[32:14] the beginning.
[32:16] In the beginning was innocence. In the
[32:18] beginning was purity. In the beginning
[32:19] was this uh this knowledge of the will
[32:21] of God and the word of God and this
[32:23] caution against evil. And that was
[32:25] enough. He said the first dispensation
[32:26] was innocence. The people knew no sin.
[32:29] They didn't know anything about sin.
[32:31] Both Adam and Eve were naked. He says
[32:34] now to amplify this, but they were hid
[32:36] from their naked nakedness by a spirit
[32:38] veil over their face. So there was
[32:42] something that in their knowledge and
[32:44] understanding. When we think of
[32:46] nakedness, we would cover up and we
[32:48] would think there was some kind of
[32:49] shame. And so I would almost say that
[32:51] brother Brandham's not saying that they
[32:53] didn't know they had they didn't have
[32:54] any clothes on. They weren't ignorant
[32:56] that they lack clothes. Clothes didn't
[32:58] mean anything to them. If someone were
[33:00] to say, "Well, why aren't you wearing a
[33:02] shirt?" He'd say, "Shirt? I haven't
[33:03] named that. What is that?" And so they
[33:06] were there was a veil that covered them.
[33:08] They didn't feel any lack. They didn't
[33:09] feel any need. They had a veil that
[33:10] spirit veil over their face that gave
[33:12] them a way of interacting with creation,
[33:15] interacting with their person,
[33:16] interacting with one another. Everything
[33:18] was pure and harmonious. A spirit veil
[33:21] over their face. They never knew that
[33:23] they were naked at all because they were
[33:25] hid for God's veil in their minds. He
[33:28] says they didn't know what was right and
[33:31] and what right and wrong was.
[33:35] And them both standing there naked
[33:37] showed that the knowledge had not yet
[33:38] come to them to see that they were
[33:40] naked. This is not something it would
[33:42] have it was a condition that didn't have
[33:44] meaning until later even.
[33:48] They had knowledge. They had wisdom.
[33:51] They had understanding. But it was
[33:52] innocent. It was very simple. It was
[33:55] very pure. And as we're trying to use
[33:57] these scriptures and these quote
[33:59] quotations to understand what life would
[34:03] have been like in that garden, the life
[34:06] they were living in Genesis 2:25.
[34:08] They're both naked, the man and his
[34:09] wife, and we're not ashamed. This is a
[34:11] life without shame. It's a life without
[34:13] guilt. It's a life without stress. It's
[34:14] a life without anxiety. It's a life
[34:16] that's just free. They would they would
[34:18] get up to do their work. And there was
[34:20] no knots in the stomach. There was no
[34:21] foroding. There was no I just feel like
[34:24] I I know I've got stuff to do, but I
[34:26] can't get I can't get up to do it. Well,
[34:28] this is important. You got to get this
[34:30] done. I don't know why I don't have that
[34:31] gear. I'm missing it in my mind. I can't
[34:33] figure this out. I don't understand
[34:34] what's going on. They didn't have any of
[34:36] that. In the beginning, life was simple.
[34:39] Male, female. That was it.
[34:42] Man and wife with what? the word to live
[34:45] by.
[34:46] It was there all in all. That was it.
[34:48] Life was simple. The will of God had
[34:51] been clearly expressed. It was perfectly
[34:53] understood. It was very straightforward.
[34:55] It wasn't complicated. They were living
[34:57] by the word that God had given them. And
[34:59] Genesis 1:28, as we've read it a number
[35:01] of times, he commanded them, blessed
[35:03] them, saying, "Be fruitful and multiply
[35:04] and replenish the earth." Be. This is
[35:06] what you're to do. Be fruitful and
[35:07] multiply. This is what you're to do.
[35:09] Replenish the earth and subdue it. have
[35:11] dominion over the fish, over the foul,
[35:13] over every living thing that moveth upon
[35:15] the earth. This is what they were to do.
[35:18] Every day they would wake up and they
[35:21] would say, "This is our job. This is our
[35:23] duty. This is our calling. This is what
[35:25] we're living in." And you could look at
[35:26] this say, "This is complex."
[35:29] Yet to the man and the woman, they were
[35:30] very simple towards it. They were trying
[35:33] to figure out everything that it meant.
[35:34] Well, now Lord, what will it mean when
[35:36] it replenishes? What does it mean to
[35:38] subdue? They just were simple towards
[35:40] the commandment. This is what we must
[35:41] do. Then this is what we must do.
[35:45] The man and the wife. I want I want to
[35:47] put it this way. When you read Genesis
[35:48] 1:28, even as we could read Genesis
[35:50] 21:16-1 17 again, they were given two
[35:53] commandments in Genesis 1:28 and Genesis
[35:55] 21:16-1 17. Be fruitful, multiply,
[35:58] replenish, and subdue the earth. Have
[36:00] dominion, and don't and eat of every
[36:02] tree, but don't eat of this tree. That's
[36:03] it. That's very simple.
[36:06] There wasn't. You look at the Old
[36:08] Testament and the laws given to Israel.
[36:10] Just start comparing the two.
[36:13] This is the law that the man and the
[36:15] wife were under and they were naked and
[36:16] not ashamed. So what is it you're
[36:18] supposed to do every day? And so now you
[36:20] have, you know, Jethro is talking to
[36:21] Adam. So what did you guys have to do?
[36:23] Well, just had to be fruitful, multiply,
[36:26] plench the earth, subdue it, and and we
[36:28] could we could eat of every tree but not
[36:29] one tree. And he's going, "Wow, see my
[36:31] beard? I had to cut it this way." You
[36:33] notice how I'm not mixing linen with
[36:35] cotton. We had to have sinks for some
[36:36] dishes and sinks for another dish. You
[36:38] know, we could eat some things, but you
[36:40] had to ask, "How was it prepared?" And
[36:42] there was things that we couldn't. And
[36:43] it was it's Listen, start thinking about
[36:46] the life, the law that God gave Israel
[36:48] and the law that he gave Adam and the
[36:49] woman. Their life was simple,
[36:52] right?
[36:53] A very simple life. And all they had to
[36:55] do was believe it and obey it.
[36:58] That's what it came down to. There was
[36:59] nothing they had to figure out on their
[37:01] own. God said it. I believe it. It was
[37:02] in the word of God. They accepted it.
[37:04] They didn't have to fend for themselves.
[37:06] They didn't have to figure it out. All
[37:07] they had to do is just believe it and
[37:09] obey it. Now, again, it was obviously
[37:12] very complex.
[37:14] It was a vast creation. As you read in
[37:17] Genesis chapter 1 and Genesis chapter 2,
[37:19] God takes a creation which is very
[37:21] multifaceted with layers of complexity
[37:23] and relationships between and among
[37:25] different species and an evolution. A
[37:28] and a way that God did it. It's a vast
[37:30] creation with an orderly arrangement and
[37:32] from a single cell organism as it God
[37:34] moved up and up and up. You see the
[37:36] thought and the planning and how things
[37:38] were connected and related to one
[37:40] another to where God achieves man and
[37:43] man as himself is a very complex
[37:45] organism.
[37:46] You look at how man moves, you say,
[37:48] "Well, look, this seems to be a very
[37:49] simple movement and and the way man
[37:51] thinks and he's a singular entity and
[37:52] he's a singular man." But that man was
[37:54] comprised of body, spirit, and soul. And
[37:57] even in that that body, it's more than
[38:00] just one single unit. But all the the
[38:02] tendons and all the muscles and all the
[38:05] everything that works together to
[38:07] produce the movement of the body. You
[38:08] say to raise your hand seems very
[38:10] simple, but it's a complex process.
[38:13] Everything from the firing of the neuron
[38:15] neurons to triggering the very muscles
[38:17] and the instincts and the articulation
[38:19] of those tendons and those muscles to
[38:21] make the arm move. It's a very complex
[38:24] but it's a very simple motion. And so
[38:26] man was a complex organism. There was a
[38:28] lot of different species and a lot of
[38:30] different creatures and creations and
[38:31] there was a job to do. It was obviously
[38:33] complex but it wasn't complicated.
[38:37] It wasn't complicated to them. They
[38:39] didn't stress. And the woman looked over
[38:42] at Adam and what's wrong, honey? Just
[38:43] began to rub his back. He's like,
[38:44] "Subdue? What does it even mean? I don't
[38:47] even know what it means to subdue.
[38:49] There was no stress. How are we going to
[38:52] do it, Eve? Look at this this world. We
[38:54] don't have any children." And God said
[38:55] that we've got to fill it up. Look at
[38:57] how many animals there are. Look at how
[38:59] they're procreated. Look at all these
[39:00] things happening. And somehow we're
[39:02] going to do this. How is this even going
[39:04] to work? Never had that conversation.
[39:10] I mean, just think they didn't have to
[39:11] budget.
[39:13] They didn't get bills,
[39:16] right? They didn't compare paychecks.
[39:19] They weren't wondering, should I go to
[39:21] school? Should I not go to school? This
[39:22] was this was awesome, right? It was the
[39:26] life. What happened to the simple life?
[39:30] What did it become?
[39:32] There was perfect love. There was
[39:34] harmony. They had a single objective.
[39:37] Now, I'll just say this because I think
[39:40] it bears uh more attention and I don't
[39:42] want to just kind of gloss over it. Talk
[39:44] about a paradox.
[39:46] Everything was perfect, but yet still
[39:49] somehow a mistake was made.
[39:52] Now, instead of resolving the paradox,
[39:54] just be comforted by that, right?
[39:57] Instead of trying to figure out why that
[39:58] worked, just say, "You know what? If
[39:59] everything in God's perfect Eden, they
[40:01] still made a mistake, then I believe God
[40:03] can have grace for me.
[40:07] Look at Genesis 1:31.
[40:13] I want to read to uh Genesis chapter
[40:15] 2:3.
[40:19] There's a lot here that I'd like to save
[40:22] for just a separate service. Some of the
[40:24] the distinctions here we want to point
[40:26] out. But now after the sixth day, man is
[40:29] created. Everything um everything God is
[40:33] not going to create again. And he says,
[40:34] "And God saw everything that he had made
[40:36] and behold it was very good." So this is
[40:39] something he has not said yet. It was
[40:41] very good. And the evening and the
[40:44] morning were the sixth day. This is a
[40:45] phrase that is used for the fifth day.
[40:47] The evening and the morning were the
[40:48] fifth day. For the fourth day in verse
[40:51] 19, for the third day in verse 13, for
[40:53] the second day, and uh um it he keeps
[40:55] going through each one of these turns.
[40:56] And the evening and the morning were the
[40:58] first day, the second day, the third
[41:00] day, the fourth day. And he says, "Now
[41:02] the evening and the morning were the
[41:04] sixth day." Then chapter two. Now we
[41:06] could we could say that this arrangement
[41:09] of chapter and verse does not confine
[41:11] God or even the narrative, but we could
[41:13] just continue reading. Thus the heavens
[41:15] and the earth were finished and all the
[41:17] host of them. The end of the sixth day.
[41:20] All this is done. God is finished
[41:21] working. And on the seventh day God
[41:24] ended his work which he had made. And he
[41:28] rested on the seventh day from all his
[41:31] work which he had made. And God blessed
[41:34] the seventh day and sanctified it
[41:37] because that in it he had rested from
[41:39] all his work which God created and made.
[41:44] Now you'll notice when you read about
[41:45] the seventh day, every other day had an
[41:47] evening and a morning and evening and
[41:48] the morning were that day. But now
[41:51] there's no evening and morning to the
[41:53] seventh day in Genesis 2. It's it's
[41:56] indicating that now God has entered into
[41:57] a particular dispensation. Brother B
[41:59] called it a dispensation of innocence.
[42:02] It's now it's not a season of labor for
[42:04] God. It's not a season of positionally
[42:06] placing a a and laying everything out
[42:08] and getting it ready and fit for the man
[42:10] and the woman. Now God is done and now
[42:12] it's it's going to signify a perpetual
[42:14] rest for God. God said, "I've done it.
[42:17] I've prepared everything. I've set
[42:20] everything in order. I've made it
[42:21] perfect. You don't have to figure
[42:23] everything out." And he places man and
[42:25] woman in. He says here, everything you
[42:27] need is already in this. There's nothing
[42:29] to figure out. There's nothing you need
[42:30] to try to uh um uh do on your own. Just
[42:33] believe God. Believe my word. Walk in my
[42:35] commandments and you'll walk the watch
[42:37] the seeds come forth. And he turned it
[42:39] over to them. He ceased from his work.
[42:41] And now it was man's turn. He given it
[42:44] to the man and the woman to fulfill to
[42:46] further the work to further the
[42:47] commission. And so now it's in that day
[42:50] and in that time that the man and the
[42:52] woman are living in.
[42:54] God is resting to his creation. It's
[42:57] perfect. Everything's in order.
[42:59] Everything is just exactly how he wanted
[43:01] it to be. Perfect love, harmony, a
[43:03] single objective, singleness of heart,
[43:05] singleness of motive, a and everything
[43:07] coming forth, bringing forth of its
[43:09] kind. And it's in that time, you could
[43:11] literally just look at it this way. And
[43:13] God rested from all his work which God
[43:15] had created and made. And then read
[43:16] verse 25. And they were both naked, the
[43:19] man and his wife, and were not ashamed.
[43:21] That's the picture you get in the
[43:23] seventh day.
[43:25] That's the picture you get is man and
[43:28] the woman's been positionally placed
[43:29] living the simple life there in the
[43:31] Garden of Eden. But now, let's just skip
[43:33] to Genesis 3:7.
[43:36] And I want I want to skip because I want
[43:38] these two verses to stand in contrast to
[43:40] one another. Chapter 2 ends, they were
[43:43] both naked, the man and his wife, and
[43:45] were not ashamed. naked without shame.
[43:48] But Genesis chapter 3:7, it says, "And
[43:50] the eyes of them both were opened." And
[43:52] so this this represents something
[43:54] completely different. Their eyes were
[43:56] opened and they knew that they were
[43:59] naked. This is completely different.
[44:02] Now, there's been a a tremendous change
[44:05] from how man and woman were in the
[44:07] garden. They both were naked and not
[44:08] ashamed, but now their eyes are open.
[44:10] And they knew that they were naked, and
[44:12] they sewed fig leaves together and made
[44:14] themselves aprons.
[44:17] If we say that your eyes are open today,
[44:19] if we were to use that phrasing and say,
[44:20] "Well, my eyes are opened." It would
[44:22] mean something different because opened
[44:24] eyes today would actually mean now I
[44:26] understand and now I get it or I was
[44:28] being deceived and you know I went into
[44:30] this deal and we were trying to work
[44:32] this thing out. But then all of a sudden
[44:33] my eyes got came open. I realized this
[44:35] is more than what we wanted. And we
[44:36] would use it to signify some
[44:38] understanding, some liberty or some
[44:40] deliverance. It would be a cause for
[44:41] joy. It would be a a development that
[44:43] would be positive.
[44:45] As even Paul says in Ephesians 1:18, and
[44:48] there's other scriptures we could use of
[44:50] uh your eyes being opened to see in a
[44:52] positive light. He said, "The eyes of
[44:53] your understanding being enlightened
[44:55] that you may know what is the hope of
[44:57] his calling and what the riches of the
[44:59] glory of his inheritance in the saints."
[45:01] This is how we think of opened eyes
[45:03] today with eyes wide open and and awake
[45:07] to see. It speaks of knowledge and
[45:09] wisdom and discernment to have your eyes
[45:11] open when you're on guard. You're not
[45:12] being lulled to sleep. and it would have
[45:14] a very positive connotation. But here
[45:17] when the eyes of man were opened, the
[45:20] opening of their eyes and the eyes of
[45:21] them were opened, it represented them
[45:23] being awakened to an evil they never
[45:25] knew before.
[45:28] This is a this is a different kind of
[45:30] alertness and awakening. You say, "Oh,
[45:32] and their eyes were open." The devil
[45:34] even presented, as we'll come to in a
[45:35] moment, in such a way to where that
[45:37] happening would be something like,
[45:38] "Yeah, woo, it worked." But this was a
[45:42] horrible moment to them because they
[45:44] never knew evil. They were innocent of
[45:45] it. Evil had never been mixed into their
[45:47] thoughts. They were told there was a
[45:48] tree that they should never eat of. So
[45:50] that formed the only basis that they
[45:52] needed to know about evil. You don't
[45:54] want it. But now when their eyes were
[45:56] open, they're awakened to something they
[45:57] never knew before. They felt a disorder
[46:00] in their spirit for the first time.
[46:04] And in this very moment, I know it's
[46:06] just a phrase, and they were both naked,
[46:08] the man and his wife, and were not
[46:09] ashamed, but just think of how long we
[46:10] could spend describing what that meant.
[46:13] And now when it says, "And their eyes of
[46:15] them were opened and they knew that they
[46:16] were naked," we have this sense of just
[46:18] saying, well, they looked down and were
[46:19] like, "Uh, why don't we have clothes
[46:20] on?" It meant so much more than that.
[46:23] That that's not what's being conveyed
[46:25] that it was just simple like, "Is it
[46:26] breezy in here?" It was it was a horror
[46:29] because now they felt a disorder in
[46:31] their spirits like, "Wait a minute, what
[46:32] is this?"
[46:34] And they looked around at creation and
[46:36] everything looked different to them.
[46:39] Now, I mean, just imagine the horror now
[46:41] because now they realize that they've
[46:42] been be beguiled and that this beast,
[46:45] this serpent, this upright being that
[46:46] could talk, one that would have labored
[46:48] with him, one that they would have named
[46:49] and had this connection to. Oh, now what
[46:52] have you done? What is this? And then
[46:53] they begin to look at everything in
[46:55] creation.
[46:57] What's happening? This was perfect. I
[46:59] don't even know what this is. I'm so
[47:01] confused. What are these feelings? And
[47:02] they looked at creation different. They
[47:04] looked at the whole world. They look at
[47:05] the creatures differently. Now they're
[47:07] suspicious. Now they don't even know
[47:08] what these feelings are. And they looked
[47:10] at themselves differently.
[47:12] The happiness, the joy, the peace, the
[47:14] order, everything that they had was
[47:16] gone. And what comes rushing in? Misery
[47:19] and fear.
[47:21] Confusion was born. Shame was born. And
[47:26] then when we say confusion, we
[47:28] immediately relate, right?
[47:30] The feeling of being lost. We can
[47:32] immediately relate. Even if we want to
[47:34] talk in a spiritual sense, when we begin
[47:36] to hear about the Lord dealing with
[47:37] somebody's heart and they're and and
[47:38] they're and the Lord's bringing them out
[47:40] of certain things and we can relate
[47:41] like, "Oh, I remember what that's like,
[47:42] the wrestling. I remember overcoming
[47:44] this. I remember that." So, it says,
[47:45] "Oh, I just feel so confused." We
[47:47] immediately relate to what it's being
[47:48] confused. But they would have had a
[47:50] feeling and an emotion and they would
[47:51] have had no idea how to make sense of
[47:53] it.
[47:55] for people who suffer with anxiety,
[47:57] maybe melancholy or depression that that
[47:59] you'll have a feeling or a sense of
[48:01] something and you have no idea really
[48:03] even what it is and why you have it.
[48:07] You just begin to become aware of it
[48:09] because even the physiological
[48:11] pain it begins to have. And it's almost
[48:12] as if you have this feeling that you
[48:14] left the garage door open, the iron on,
[48:16] the crockpot on, and high, and the
[48:18] fireplace on, and everything at home is
[48:20] on, and you just left for vacation, and
[48:22] it's too late to turn back, and you've
[48:23] got no one that you could call, and
[48:24] you're like, "Did I leave the iron on?
[48:27] Is the garage door open? Did we turn the
[48:29] water off?" And and you all of a sudden
[48:31] just feel like this anxiety, this
[48:34] forboding, this fear, and and you don't
[48:36] even know why. You don't know why you're
[48:38] feeling. That's the state that this man
[48:40] and this woman immediately begin to
[48:42] feel. Their eyes were open. The opening
[48:44] of their eyes just brought this feeling
[48:46] emotionally. And it says, "And they knew
[48:48] they were naked. They instantly felt
[48:50] change." What did happen? The veil of
[48:53] God's glory was taken away.
[48:57] Under Now, this is this is and I I
[49:00] wanted to preface this earlier and I
[49:01] just forgot to mention it. I I'm doing
[49:03] this in order to lay a foundation if God
[49:06] would lead us to continue to speak about
[49:08] families and just how it's complicated
[49:10] in the time that we're living and the
[49:12] different things that we need to uh
[49:14] navigate through the decisions and the
[49:15] challenges that we face. I just wanted
[49:17] to kind of tell the story of this fall
[49:20] from this vantage point of the simple
[49:22] life becoming very complicated.
[49:25] And so I'm wanting to I'm going very
[49:27] slowly in these through these instances
[49:28] just to develop a a fuller relationship
[49:31] for us with the scripture. We can enter
[49:33] into the very things that are happening.
[49:35] We see the simple life of Genesis 2. Now
[49:37] we see where it gets complicated.
[49:40] We're looking at how things fell. Now we
[49:42] could relate to this very uniquely
[49:44] because the man and the woman, this had
[49:46] never been sensed or experienced before
[49:48] by creation. But it says, "And the eyes
[49:51] of them were both opened and they knew
[49:53] that they were naked." Now this is
[49:55] there's some unfolding of these events
[49:58] for the moment the woman be to listen
[50:00] the when the moment she be to act and
[50:02] the moment that she went and acted with
[50:04] Adam and so while they were under the
[50:07] temptation
[50:09] while they were under the deception and
[50:11] under the pull the temptation they were
[50:13] not fully conscious of the moment that
[50:15] God's glory left them what they say
[50:18] temptation is the night and guilt is the
[50:20] morning you know while you're under the
[50:22] temptation you're under There's that
[50:24] lust, there's this desire, and there's
[50:26] this feeling a and you're not even maybe
[50:28] there might be a smaller voice. Why are
[50:30] you this is crazy. What are you doing?
[50:31] But you're so overwhelmed with it. But
[50:33] then once that lust is satisfied, or
[50:35] once that feeling leaves, all of a
[50:36] sudden, oh my goodness, what have I
[50:38] done? And or or that was wrong. I
[50:40] shouldn't have done that. This is
[50:41] exactly what they felt for the first
[50:42] time. This is the very first moment
[50:45] that a human being ever experienced
[50:47] these emotions. While under the
[50:49] influence of temptation, in walking in
[50:51] this deception, this begilement and
[50:53] doing these acts, they were not
[50:54] conscious that in that moment the very
[50:56] veil of God had left them. But then
[50:58] afterwards, once they had been
[50:59] accomplished, they became conscious that
[51:01] God's power no longer covered them.
[51:05] Now after they had acted and after they
[51:07] had done the things that they had been
[51:08] beguiled to do and Adam did the things
[51:10] that he felt the uncction to do they
[51:12] realized there's no holy image anymore.
[51:15] This power this strength this
[51:17] understanding that we had before that we
[51:19] were not wearing we did not have hair
[51:21] like the beast did or we did not have
[51:23] this like others and here we didn't have
[51:25] scales but we just had this skin and and
[51:27] we existed and we were fine. And that
[51:29] wasn't naked to us. There was no shame.
[51:31] There's no guilt. But now all of a
[51:32] sudden they realized there's no holy
[51:34] image anymore. And they had lost the
[51:36] innocence.
[51:38] The ignorance of innocence. They had
[51:40] lost it. The ignorance of innocence that
[51:43] knew no shame in nakedness.
[51:46] Things were no longer simple.
[51:49] Things no longer made sense.
[51:51] In that very moment that this they
[51:53] became conscious that the veil had left
[51:55] them. It convoluted all their faculties
[51:57] of mind and body.
[51:59] Those channels were perfect. the all the
[52:01] senses of the body, all the senses of
[52:03] the mind in perfect harmony with the
[52:05] soul. But now all of a sudden that place
[52:08] from which God dealt with the man in his
[52:09] soul realm, that place that was tethered
[52:12] to this holy image that draped over
[52:13] them, now all of a sudden that holy
[52:15] image is gone and there's darkness that
[52:16] falls into the soul and all the channels
[52:18] of man become clogged and he doesn't
[52:20] even really know how to relate to God
[52:22] anymore.
[52:24] He doesn't even understand him. Can't
[52:26] can't have that fellowship with him. The
[52:28] spirit becomes clouded. judgment becomes
[52:30] confused.
[52:31] Why? Because that soul immediately is
[52:33] disconnected from the oneness it had
[52:34] with God.
[52:38] And now in this very passage, Genesis
[52:42] 3:7,
[52:44] man is naked and he knows it. Man is in
[52:48] a horrible sinful condition and he's
[52:50] fully aware of it. This is what happens
[52:53] when God's Eden is disturbed.
[52:56] This is what happens when God's order is
[52:59] disturbed. There's guilt. There's shame.
[53:01] There's acknowledgment that something's
[53:03] wrong. There's something we can take
[53:04] from this and learn from it. And let me
[53:06] just quickly express it that if we are
[53:07] desiring to be restored back to a garden
[53:09] of Eden condition, then we must step
[53:12] into the paradigm of the word of God and
[53:14] the channel the word of God that when
[53:15] you make a mistake and there's guilt,
[53:17] you apologize. You don't try to fix it
[53:19] yourself. You go to the atonement that
[53:21] God has for it.
[53:23] This is what happens immediately when
[53:25] the order is disturbed in God's Eden.
[53:27] But turn to Revelations 3 17 and 18. And
[53:31] look at how it looks in the pinnacle of
[53:33] Satan's Eden. Because thou sayest, I am
[53:35] riched and increase with goods and have
[53:37] need of nothing. And knowest not that
[53:39] thou art wretched and miserable and poor
[53:41] and blind and naked. What a contrast.
[53:45] What an absolute stunning contrast.
[53:48] completely antipotal to where one on one
[53:50] end men and women make this mistake and
[53:53] they're immediately conscious. We're
[53:54] naked. We've sinned. This is horrible.
[53:57] We must be covered. But at the end of
[53:59] Satan's Eden, they're miserable. They're
[54:00] wretched. They're poor. They're blind
[54:01] and naked. But they feel like they're
[54:03] rich. They feel like they're clothed.
[54:04] They feel like they have everything they
[54:05] need. They're blind.
[54:08] Naked and don't know it. Why? Now the
[54:10] lust veil holds.
[54:12] Now the veil of science and the veil of
[54:14] religion and the veil of education. It's
[54:16] so powerful upon the minds of the people
[54:19] at the end of Satan's Eden to where
[54:20] there's not this instinctive guilt when
[54:22] they lack.
[54:24] There's not this instinctive recognition
[54:26] that they need more from God. When they
[54:28] say something, when they do something,
[54:29] when they have a way of treating people
[54:31] or building religious systems or even
[54:34] denying God and falling headlong into
[54:36] science and the unknown, there's no part
[54:38] of them that checks them and says, "Hold
[54:39] on, wait a minute. This isn't right."
[54:41] And they experience this shame and this
[54:42] guilt. like, "Oh, this isn't this is in
[54:45] congruent with what's right. This is in
[54:47] congruent with truth. I feel disharmony.
[54:49] I feel disjuncted. I feel disconcerted.
[54:51] I feel dissatisfied. Something's wrong
[54:53] somewhere. How do we rectify this?" They
[54:55] don't have that in them.
[54:57] And instead of God saying, "Hey, since
[54:58] you're naked, go get some clothes. Since
[55:00] you can't see, go get some contacts."
[55:02] God has the solution. Once again, I
[55:04] counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in
[55:06] the fire that thou mayest be truly rich
[55:08] and white raignment that thou mayest be
[55:10] clothed. Can I just inject this? In
[55:11] other words, God doesn't trust those
[55:13] that are blind and naked
[55:16] to figure out what they need to see and
[55:18] be dressed
[55:19] that you they don't have the capacity to
[55:21] do it.
[55:23] And he says in white raignment thou
[55:24] mayest be closed and the shame of thy
[55:26] nakedness do not appear and anoint thine
[55:28] eyes with Isav that thou mayest see.
[55:33] This is the whole this is the whole
[55:35] picture of God that is now or this I
[55:39] want to do these two contrasting images.
[55:41] The man and the woman are in the garden.
[55:43] They're naked and they're not ashamed.
[55:45] Everything's great. Everything's
[55:46] wonderful. Everything's good. The moment
[55:48] that the they they're inspired with this
[55:51] lust. There comes this moment where all
[55:53] of a sudden now they awaken. Oh no,
[55:55] something's changed. Something's wrong.
[55:58] And then in the pinnacle of Satan's Eden
[56:01] under a lust veil, a science veil, an
[56:03] education veil, all the different ways
[56:04] that Brother Brandham describes it,
[56:06] they're blind. They're poor and don't
[56:08] know it. They're blind and naked don't
[56:10] know it. And so God says, "You need to
[56:12] be clothed. That just shame of thy
[56:14] nakedness." Do you notice the contrast
[56:15] in conditions?
[56:17] They were immediately shamed. The eyes
[56:19] of them were open and they knew that
[56:20] they were naked. They were shamed
[56:21] associated with their present state. And
[56:23] now in the end, God is saying, "Let's
[56:26] remedy that.
[56:29] Not just through ignorance,
[56:31] not through the simplicity that just
[56:33] doesn't want to know anymore and acts
[56:35] like nothing matters. That's the wrong
[56:36] kind of simple. There's definitely the
[56:38] wrong kind of simple to be on the wrong
[56:40] side of simple. But now on the other
[56:42] side of complexity, God is saying, I
[56:45] want you to be clothed that the shame of
[56:46] your ne nakedness do not appear that
[56:48] your eyes be anointed that you may see.
[56:52] Because when their eyes were opened
[56:55] and they knew that they were naked,
[56:59] Paul deals with this very instance as we
[57:01] read in our in our text. 2 Corinthians
[57:03] 11:es 1-4.
[57:05] I'm going to try to giddy up a little
[57:06] bit here. 2 Corinthians 11:es 1-4.
[57:11] Let me just we we let me skip to uh to
[57:14] verse three because he's saying that he
[57:16] wants to present them as a chasted
[57:17] virgin. The woman in the beginning would
[57:19] have been just that. the church in the
[57:21] beginning of the church being
[57:22] inaugurated it was a chased virgin. So
[57:24] now Paul desires that this happens but I
[57:27] fear less by any means as the serpent
[57:29] beguiled Eve through his subtlety. So
[57:31] this begilement this deception was
[57:33] through subtlety. He fears that so your
[57:35] mind should be corrupted from the
[57:37] simplicity that is in Christ. And I want
[57:41] to take this image that he's saying. In
[57:43] other words, Satan begiled the woman
[57:47] away from the simplicity that was in the
[57:49] word of God. Begiled her from the
[57:51] simplicity of the garden of Eden, the
[57:53] simplicity of God's command, the
[57:55] simplicity of the life that God had
[57:57] established for the woman. And he says,
[57:59] I fear that as the serpent beguiled Eve
[58:00] through his subtlety, so our minds would
[58:02] be corrupted from the simplicity that is
[58:04] in Christ. And this is how he says it
[58:06] could happen. If he come cometh
[58:07] preaching another Jesus whom we have not
[58:09] preached or you receive another spirit
[58:11] which you have not received or another
[58:12] gospel which you have not accepted, you
[58:14] might well bear with him. Paul is making
[58:17] a direct connection and parallel to what
[58:19] happened in Genesis chapter 3. And when
[58:22] he says that your minds would be
[58:23] corrupted from the simplicity that is in
[58:25] Christ, there there's a the the language
[58:29] that is used there. I think this will
[58:30] help you to understand what is being
[58:32] meant. It's not the simplicity that is
[58:34] in Christ in that Christ is very very
[58:36] simple but he's speaking about us
[58:38] towards him. It's the simplicity that is
[58:40] to or towards Christ from the singleness
[58:43] of mind. The simplicity we have towards
[58:45] him. The state of our hearts to him.
[58:49] It means simplicity means unmixed or
[58:51] pure singleness of mind. The sincerity
[58:54] to the word that your minds would be
[58:55] corrupted from the singleness to the
[58:57] word. Your sincerity towards the word.
[58:58] He says that nothing would be added to
[59:00] it or taken from it. corrupted from the
[59:02] simplicity that we believe. This is
[59:04] Christ. This is his word. This is what
[59:06] he asked and I believe it. But then our
[59:09] minds get corrupted from it. How does he
[59:11] say it happens? Another Jesus, another
[59:12] spirit, another gospel.
[59:14] And what does that become? The
[59:15] complication of the word only.
[59:18] How is it you can believe in Jesus when
[59:20] the Jesus you've been taught is another
[59:21] one?
[59:22] How is it you could ever be comfortable
[59:24] with the spirit because the when the
[59:25] spirit you received is another one? How
[59:28] is it you could walk and and and satisfy
[59:30] and be successful in a gospel in the
[59:31] gospel you receive is another one. This
[59:33] is a complication of something that yes
[59:35] is complex but we must be simple towards
[59:37] it. Nothing added to it's Christ alone.
[59:41] So the sing the simplicity means
[59:42] singleness of mind. It's an undivided
[59:44] heart in terms of affections and and and
[59:47] and attitude for Christ the word
[59:51] in that seventh day as we looked at it.
[59:54] It was very simple for the man and the
[59:56] woman. The Bible says the man and his
[59:58] wife
[1:00:00] live by the word of God. Fulfill Genesis
[1:00:04] 1:28. Fulfill Genesis 2:16 to17. He gave
[1:00:07] him something to sustain the natural
[1:00:08] flesh and a caution to what would
[1:00:10] destroy it. And then they had a
[1:00:11] spiritual supernatural objective
[1:00:13] according to Genesis 1:28.
[1:00:16] A word to live by, fulfill his commands.
[1:00:18] And this was an act of trust to walk in
[1:00:21] it. It was an act of faith. only
[1:00:24] believing in God, only depending upon
[1:00:26] him, entirely depending upon him and his
[1:00:28] word. That was their only dependency.
[1:00:31] There was no other measures. There was
[1:00:32] no other contingencies. There was
[1:00:33] nothing else that they reached for. Man
[1:00:36] and woman were tasked with trusting God,
[1:00:38] believing God, being obedient to God.
[1:00:41] And Paul is saying that this is what I'm
[1:00:43] afraid of. The serpent took Eve and
[1:00:45] complicated it for her. brought her
[1:00:47] outside of that protection, outside of
[1:00:49] the very simple commands of God that
[1:00:50] were given to them, regardless of the
[1:00:52] layers of complexity, regardless of the
[1:00:54] things that had not yet been manifested,
[1:00:55] they just needed to stay behind that
[1:00:57] word and walk within that pattern of
[1:00:59] that word of God. And it was an act of
[1:01:01] faith for them to do it. Just trust God.
[1:01:03] Just believe them.
[1:01:05] But Genesis 3:es 1-6, now the serpent
[1:01:08] was more subtle than any beast of the
[1:01:09] field which the Lord God had made. as
[1:01:12] the serpent beguiled Eve through his
[1:01:14] subtlety. Now the scripture begins to
[1:01:15] introduce us to this enchantment. And he
[1:01:18] said unto the woman, "Yay, hath God
[1:01:20] said, you shall not eat of every tree of
[1:01:22] the garden?" Now remember before we
[1:01:24] said, "We got to be very mature about
[1:01:25] this." Satan was not tempting the woman
[1:01:29] to natural fruit.
[1:01:32] It's a conversation that was meant to
[1:01:34] bring up life.
[1:01:36] It was a conversation meant to steer her
[1:01:39] into error to corrupt the commandments
[1:01:41] of God. So he's trying to corrupt the
[1:01:44] woman's simplicity that she had towards
[1:01:46] the word, the singleness of mind she
[1:01:48] had, the trust and confidence. So just
[1:01:51] think of this. She's there. She has no
[1:01:53] reason to worry. She has no reason to
[1:01:55] doubt God. There's no mechanism within
[1:01:58] her to distrust him. He said it. She he
[1:02:00] she believes it. She's trusting to him.
[1:02:02] She has this simplicity towards the word
[1:02:04] of God. She has a simple approach to
[1:02:06] life every day. And she's like, "What am
[1:02:08] I doing?" I'm just living the word of
[1:02:10] God. We have a commandment. We have a
[1:02:12] life to live. Everything's provided for.
[1:02:13] There's no worries. There's no harm.
[1:02:15] Well, are you working? Yes, we work. But
[1:02:17] it's all in the soil. It's all there.
[1:02:18] Everything's just coming forth just
[1:02:20] beautifully. And naturally, Satan was
[1:02:22] trying to corrupt her from the things
[1:02:23] that were simple. And the woman said
[1:02:26] unto the serpent, now inspired by this
[1:02:28] conversation, and though I believe
[1:02:30] through the translations and everything
[1:02:32] and the way that it was inspired, it's
[1:02:34] conveying the reality of the
[1:02:36] conversation, if not the exact words
[1:02:37] that were used. We know there's
[1:02:39] symbolism that's being represented. She
[1:02:40] says, "We may eat of the fruit of the
[1:02:42] trees of the garden, but of the tree of
[1:02:45] but of the tree which is in the midst of
[1:02:46] the garden, God had said." So she has
[1:02:49] this she has a specific knowledge and
[1:02:52] knows exactly where to point to and
[1:02:54] makes the connection when he says you
[1:02:55] shall not eat of every tree of the
[1:02:56] garden. And she says oh we can eat of
[1:02:58] every tree but there's one in particular
[1:03:00] we can't. So it's she knows these
[1:03:01] things. She has this understanding and
[1:03:04] she says God has said you shall not eat
[1:03:06] of it neither shall you touch it
[1:03:09] lest ye die.
[1:03:12] And the serpent said unto the woman you
[1:03:14] shall not surely die. Now many Jewish
[1:03:17] writers actually write about this
[1:03:19] scenario this way that the woman said,
[1:03:21] "You shall not eat of it, neither shall
[1:03:23] you touch it." And that what the serpent
[1:03:26] did is he said, "You shall not die." And
[1:03:28] he pressed the woman up against the tree
[1:03:30] just to touch it. There was there was
[1:03:33] contact. This is what the Jewish writers
[1:03:35] write. I just think about this that he
[1:03:37] pushed her up against the tree and he
[1:03:39] said, "See, you haven't died."
[1:03:42] And in that moment, what did what begin
[1:03:45] to create maybe some kind of dissonance
[1:03:47] like wait a minute created some kind of
[1:03:49] misunderstanding some kind of confusion
[1:03:52] trying to teach it in such a way say oh
[1:03:54] you're going to die the very moment you
[1:03:55] do you're supposed to die look what
[1:03:57] happened you didn't immediately die and
[1:03:58] now he's planting seeds in her in her
[1:04:00] mind because she would have said well I
[1:04:02] never I never thought about what it
[1:04:03] meant to die I never thought that it
[1:04:05] would be in some kind of breath or some
[1:04:06] kind of moment she never tried to figure
[1:04:08] all that out but now what has he done
[1:04:10] he's painted the picture for her He's
[1:04:12] he's he's offered that paradigm for her
[1:04:14] to step into. And now when the contact
[1:04:16] is made, see, you didn't die.
[1:04:22] And then it just becomes so much more
[1:04:24] aggravated. And it's interesting that
[1:04:25] she adds, "Neither shall you touch it."
[1:04:27] Some suggest that this is where there
[1:04:29] was error that was born
[1:04:32] because it's absent in Genesis chapter
[1:04:34] 2, but I don't know that I would make
[1:04:36] too much of it right now to be
[1:04:38] distracted. But she says it, there could
[1:04:41] have been some interaction where the
[1:04:42] devil capitalized on that. And then this
[1:04:44] is where it really gets heavy. For God
[1:04:46] doth know that in the day you eat
[1:04:49] thereof, then your eyes shall be opened
[1:04:51] and you shall be as gods, knowing good
[1:04:54] and evil. Now, the lie was, "You shall
[1:04:57] not surely die." But there was more to
[1:05:00] the lie. It'd be one thing if this was
[1:05:02] all that was awakened to Eve. Be like,
[1:05:04] "Well, man, I thought the moment I
[1:05:06] touched it, I was going to die. I
[1:05:08] thought that was going to be when breath
[1:05:09] would expire and and I would disappear
[1:05:11] whatever that means the unknown or the
[1:05:13] this fear of death and he says and when
[1:05:16] this but now it's not just the matter
[1:05:18] that you won't die but it's something
[1:05:19] that God was hiding from her. God doth
[1:05:22] know that in the day you eat thereof
[1:05:24] your eyes shall be open you shall be as
[1:05:26] gods knowing good and evil.
[1:05:29] There was an assertion that there'd be
[1:05:30] no death but then a supposed greater
[1:05:32] knowledge that God was hiding from her.
[1:05:35] And the woman saw that the tree was good
[1:05:37] for food and that was pleasant to the
[1:05:38] eyes and a tree to be desired to make
[1:05:40] one wise. Where did that come from? God
[1:05:43] said if you eat it, you're going to die.
[1:05:45] But now she sees it completely different
[1:05:47] than what the word of God had said. God
[1:05:49] had framed her understanding of that
[1:05:51] tree in the beginning. Now through fair
[1:05:53] words and through enticement and begama.
[1:05:56] Now she's no longer viewing that in the
[1:05:58] way that God intended her to view it.
[1:06:00] She views it completely different
[1:06:01] through a paradigm introduced to her
[1:06:02] through Satan. Desire to make her own
[1:06:04] wise. She took of the fruit thereof and
[1:06:06] did eat and gave also unto her husband
[1:06:07] with her and he did eat. Where did that
[1:06:10] come from?
[1:06:12] The very fact that you would not die.
[1:06:14] That was so uncertain.
[1:06:16] That was so untrustworthy.
[1:06:19] This supposing that there would be a
[1:06:20] greater knowledge. You'll be as gods,
[1:06:21] knowing good and evil. Your eyes will be
[1:06:23] opened. This was so uncertain. There was
[1:06:25] no reason to trust it. She had begun to
[1:06:27] look through the wrong lens because she
[1:06:28] should have said, "Wait a minute. Who
[1:06:30] are you?
[1:06:31] Why should I believe you? Why should I
[1:06:33] trust you? Where are you getting that
[1:06:35] from? God hath said, God hath said. And
[1:06:39] you go to the temptation of Christ and
[1:06:40] the wilderness. And you notice that
[1:06:42] Jesus doesn't necessarily try to figure
[1:06:44] out everything Satan's thrown at him.
[1:06:45] But he goes back to what God had already
[1:06:47] said at his foundation. And Satan says,
[1:06:49] "Well, you shall surely die." Says, "But
[1:06:50] it is written." He said, "The day we eat
[1:06:52] it, we'll die." Well, why aren't you
[1:06:53] dying right now? I don't know, but his
[1:06:55] word's true.
[1:06:56] Amen.
[1:06:58] Doesn't say you can command stones to be
[1:07:00] raised up. says, "Man shall not live by
[1:07:02] bread alone, but by every word that
[1:07:03] proceeded out of the mouth of God."
[1:07:04] That's kind of the climax to me when you
[1:07:06] think about it. It's like whatever
[1:07:07] paradigm, whatever view, whatever lens,
[1:07:09] whatever belief system, whatever
[1:07:11] modality to try to make sense of
[1:07:13] everything that's happening or some kind
[1:07:14] of prism that they want you to look
[1:07:16] through, you have to look at it this
[1:07:17] way. Oh, if you can see it from this
[1:07:18] standpoint, you can see it through this
[1:07:20] doctrine. If you can see it through my
[1:07:21] ministry, listen, just to come back to
[1:07:23] the word of God
[1:07:25] is what Jesus taught us to do. But Satan
[1:07:28] took advantage of her unsuspecting
[1:07:30] innocence to begile her away from what?
[1:07:33] Belief and obedience. That was it. He
[1:07:35] begiled her away from belief and
[1:07:37] obedience.
[1:07:39] The woman had been naked.
[1:07:42] That meant without shame. They both
[1:07:44] were, which was a symbol symbol of
[1:07:47] simplicity and innocence. They were
[1:07:49] ignorant of evil.
[1:07:51] All they knew was the word of God.
[1:07:54] And no matter how complex it was, it
[1:07:58] wasn't complicated.
[1:08:00] But Satan's lie corrupted everything.
[1:08:04] And in a moment, it complicated her
[1:08:06] perception.
[1:08:08] She lost the innocence.
[1:08:11] The very moment she considered the
[1:08:13] thought that Satan was positioning to
[1:08:15] her, that God did not have her best in
[1:08:18] mind in what he had already told her.
[1:08:23] that there was something nefarious on
[1:08:24] God's part. She the woman accepted that
[1:08:27] God's word had not already provided the
[1:08:29] best way.
[1:08:34] That moment of doubt is all that it
[1:08:35] took.
[1:08:37] But as we want to wrap this up and bring
[1:08:39] it to a close,
[1:08:41] what was ponder this, what was the
[1:08:44] transgression?
[1:08:46] Now we know the act. We know the truth
[1:08:49] of it. But in its most basic form, it
[1:08:52] was disobedience to the word that God
[1:08:54] had already expressed.
[1:08:57] It was disobedience to God's expressed
[1:08:59] word. And I would say understood.
[1:09:01] Brother says perfectly understood. She
[1:09:03] understood. When Satan asked, she had
[1:09:06] the answer.
[1:09:08] She brought it back to the word.
[1:09:11] But Satan complicated man's simple
[1:09:13] reliance on the word. What do you mean
[1:09:16] by reliance? What was simple? They just
[1:09:18] trusted it.
[1:09:20] Well, what if God's hiding from the some
[1:09:21] of you? Well, maybe he knows it's best.
[1:09:24] Well, how come you don't know how many
[1:09:26] it takes to replenish the earth? Because
[1:09:28] maybe he doesn't want me to know.
[1:09:31] It was don't create any distrust to God.
[1:09:34] Don't create any breach in your spirit
[1:09:36] or harmony towards the word of God. It
[1:09:37] was man simply relying upon the word of
[1:09:40] God, depending on God, surrendered to
[1:09:42] his word. That was the state and the
[1:09:44] condition that was breached in the
[1:09:46] beginning.
[1:09:48] The act that it produced is awful. It's
[1:09:49] filthy. It's ungodly. It's the original
[1:09:51] sin. But we can say with very clarity
[1:09:54] and very certainty, what Satan was able
[1:09:55] to do is begile the woman away from her
[1:09:57] trust in God. Begile the woman away from
[1:09:59] her confidence that God had her best in
[1:10:01] mind. Begile her away from the simple
[1:10:03] life.
[1:10:04] Satan asked the question. She had the
[1:10:06] answer. But it's like, well, there's
[1:10:07] more to it.
[1:10:10] And the eyes of them were both opened,
[1:10:11] and they knew that they were naked. and
[1:10:13] they sewed fig leaves together and made
[1:10:15] themselves aprons. Do you realize what
[1:10:18] has happened now? Their eyes of them are
[1:10:19] opened and they knew that they were
[1:10:20] naked. Satan's promise is fulfilled
[1:10:23] because Satan said, "God doth know that
[1:10:24] the day you eat, your eyes shall be
[1:10:26] opened." Satan's promise is fulfilled.
[1:10:29] Their eyes are open, but not to joy, not
[1:10:32] to happiness, not to a greater depth of
[1:10:34] joy. Like, I was happy yesterday, but
[1:10:36] now I'm happy.
[1:10:39] Now, this is real joy. This is real
[1:10:41] living. This is more perfect. this is
[1:10:43] awesome. It didn't awaken them to some
[1:10:45] kind of higher uh uh level of of harmony
[1:10:48] with everything. There wasn't a greater
[1:10:49] power that they awoke to. But now their
[1:10:51] awakening was a consciousness of sin.
[1:10:53] Now their awakening was immediately a
[1:10:55] conflict with God. They had never had
[1:10:56] conflict before.
[1:10:59] They lost the innocence that the
[1:11:01] nakedness symbolized. Now they're in
[1:11:02] disharmony with God. Their disharmony
[1:11:04] with fellowship. Now they're daring with
[1:11:05] one another. And in that very moment, it
[1:11:07] fulfilled the statement, "The day you
[1:11:09] eat, thou shalt surely die." How? That
[1:11:13] very moment they died a terrible
[1:11:15] spiritual death. All spiritual powers
[1:11:18] vanted. In that moment, they deeply felt
[1:11:20] a present death. Death had anchored in
[1:11:23] the soul. Darkness, blackness. There's
[1:11:26] just hardly any way that we could
[1:11:27] describe and you could understand just
[1:11:31] how awful that must have felt.
[1:11:35] You take a man who lives a life and he
[1:11:38] comes to a place where he has been so
[1:11:39] pressed out of measure and he's having
[1:11:41] such a difficult time in his life and
[1:11:43] something happens or maybe just through
[1:11:45] mental illness and things and they
[1:11:46] commit some kind of murder or some
[1:11:48] atrocity and they come back in their
[1:11:50] right mind. There's a way that they
[1:11:51] begin to artic relate to a just an
[1:11:54] accumulation of anxieties and fear,
[1:11:56] anger, jealousy, and there's a guilt and
[1:11:58] there's a shame and there's a horror
[1:12:00] that man has to deal with in his sins
[1:12:01] and his failures and his backslidings
[1:12:03] and even the awful acts that they can
[1:12:05] commit. But none of it will compare to
[1:12:07] that very moment that all perfection was
[1:12:09] breached
[1:12:11] and a soul felt death for the first
[1:12:13] time. We're born into this world with
[1:12:15] darkness in our soul. But this was a
[1:12:18] people who gen a man and a woman Genesis
[1:12:20] 2:25 walking in the garden living life
[1:12:23] everything's perfect but now they felt a
[1:12:25] deep presence of death but then
[1:12:27] impending death was feared now there's a
[1:12:30] forboding they know they're dead but
[1:12:32] they also know they're dying
[1:12:35] they know death is coming
[1:12:38] in verse nine of Genesis 3 and the Lord
[1:12:40] God called to Adam and said unto him
[1:12:41] where art thou and he said I heard thy
[1:12:44] voice in the garden and I was afraid
[1:12:47] because I was naked. Compare that to
[1:12:50] Genesis 2:25. Just do it in your minds
[1:12:51] real quick. Compared. Great.
[1:12:54] This is completely different. I I heard
[1:12:57] your voice and I was afraid because I
[1:12:59] was naked and I hid myself. Nothing's
[1:13:02] changed, Adam. Right?
[1:13:04] You were naked before and my presence
[1:13:07] came through my voice, but I I you never
[1:13:10] hid before. And he said, "Who told you?
[1:13:12] God now knows there's only one way you
[1:13:14] could be afraid. There's only one way
[1:13:17] shame could have entered it. There's
[1:13:18] only one way from this paradoxical mix
[1:13:21] and tree of good and evil. Who told thou
[1:13:23] that thou was naked? Hast thou eaten of
[1:13:25] the tree whereof I commanded thee that
[1:13:26] thou shouldest not eat? And the man
[1:13:29] said, now immediate, notice, notice the
[1:13:30] disharmony. Notice the brokenness. The
[1:13:32] woman thou gave me.
[1:13:35] She gave me of the tree and I did eat.
[1:13:37] She did it. Now you want to know why
[1:13:40] marriage is complicated or can be
[1:13:41] complicated? Look at it. Genesis chapter
[1:13:44] 3. He did it too. He should have known
[1:13:47] just as better. But now there never was
[1:13:48] blame before. Now there's blame. There
[1:13:51] never was guilt. There never was
[1:13:53] suspicion. There never was a breach of a
[1:13:54] promise. There was no no there wasn't a
[1:13:56] lack of trust. It was never this way.
[1:13:59] The voice of God was a comfort to them.
[1:14:00] The voice of God was confirmation. The
[1:14:02] voice of God was a source of
[1:14:03] inspiration. His presence was welcome
[1:14:05] and looked forward to. Even as brother
[1:14:06] Brandham would describe in the cool of
[1:14:08] the evening they would go walking in the
[1:14:10] garden of Eden. This is something that
[1:14:12] they would have looked forward to. This
[1:14:13] is something that they were a part of.
[1:14:15] It was who they were. It was something
[1:14:16] they rejoiced in. But man, now all of a
[1:14:19] sudden, he never knew fear. He never
[1:14:20] knew sin. He never knew what these
[1:14:22] feelings were like. And God knew only
[1:14:24] the tree of knowledge of good and evil
[1:14:25] could have done this.
[1:14:30] I want to try to close it with this line
[1:14:32] of thought.
[1:14:34] If confusion and complication came by
[1:14:36] the tree of knowledge of good and evil,
[1:14:38] how can it take it away?
[1:14:42] If everything we know today, whether it
[1:14:44] be a sickness, a malady, a a hurt or
[1:14:47] harm, whatever it might be, if it came
[1:14:49] from that, how can the perfecting of it
[1:14:52] come from it? The healing, the the the
[1:14:56] men, the the mending, the taking away
[1:14:59] disobedience, the broadening of the
[1:15:01] mind, the open up of her mind to a new
[1:15:02] knowledge, a science and education, a
[1:15:05] better way of thinking. That's what
[1:15:06] caused the fall. And therefore, the open
[1:15:08] of our minds and disobedience to the
[1:15:10] word can never bring fulfillment. can
[1:15:11] never bring happiness, can never bring
[1:15:13] joy, can never bring things back
[1:15:15] together that are broken.
[1:15:20] Just looking at the things here to wind
[1:15:23] this down, bring it to just a the close
[1:15:25] now in a few moments.
[1:15:28] Why is there chaos today? Why is there
[1:15:31] confusion today?
[1:15:34] Why are things so complicated? Why can't
[1:15:36] they be neat?
[1:15:40] The world itself is chaotic but even
[1:15:43] ourselves is cha we're chaotic.
[1:15:45] We wrestle with emotions and scars and
[1:15:48] complexes. We despair for answers in
[1:15:50] certain situations. We feel hopeless
[1:15:52] about certain things. And this is this
[1:15:54] is us as a person. And this person who's
[1:15:57] full of knots and inconsistencies and
[1:16:00] insecurities and past fears and shadows
[1:16:02] in our spirits. This is me. This is who
[1:16:04] I am. But now I exist within a world
[1:16:06] that's got no answers for it. that only
[1:16:09] triggers things and makes things worse
[1:16:11] and only clouds things and the whole
[1:16:13] world's in chaos. The whole world is
[1:16:15] having emotions and birth pains and
[1:16:17] knots and problems.
[1:16:19] Why is it this way? Why do we hurt one
[1:16:20] another? Why do we even have
[1:16:22] misunderstandings? Why is it we have
[1:16:23] communication failures?
[1:16:26] Why does it why do things seem so hard?
[1:16:28] Why can't it just be easy? Why why is
[1:16:31] nothing simple anymore? Even we just try
[1:16:34] to compare it to past decades. We think
[1:16:36] now why can it not be simple? Why is
[1:16:38] just even truth seem so elusive?
[1:16:42] It's a complex story.
[1:16:45] But the simple answer is the fall.
[1:16:49] Genesis 3 tells us the whole story.
[1:16:52] We have a fallen nature that has
[1:16:54] completely detached itself from faith in
[1:16:56] God. As a as a society, as a world, and
[1:17:00] as individuals detached from faith in
[1:17:02] God and reliance upon him, it
[1:17:04] complicates a complex life.
[1:17:07] And with complicated lives, it
[1:17:09] complicates our relationships. It leads
[1:17:10] to frustration. It leads to worry, leads
[1:17:12] to jealousy. It leads to fear. These all
[1:17:14] these things just came together with to
[1:17:16] me when I'm pondering relationships in a
[1:17:18] church and in a family. The complexities
[1:17:20] of it all. It's complex. It's not very
[1:17:21] simple. You can't just teach a few
[1:17:23] services on it and be like, "All right,
[1:17:24] you guys got it. Excellent. Perfect. We
[1:17:26] all know have good marriages and we have
[1:17:27] good relationships." No, it's complex.
[1:17:29] But it's not even just complex anymore.
[1:17:31] It's complicated.
[1:17:33] the relationships, the scars, the
[1:17:34] woundings, the battles that people face
[1:17:36] and all the frustrations.
[1:17:38] And let me just express this is maybe
[1:17:40] we'll just invite the musicians to come
[1:17:42] to hasten this this this close. There's
[1:17:45] no other paradigm. There's no other
[1:17:47] view. There's no other way that we can
[1:17:49] try to make sense of everything, whether
[1:17:51] it be in our hearts or in the world. And
[1:17:53] there's nothing that can bring clarity
[1:17:55] to our hearts or to our minds other than
[1:17:57] God's word. It's the only way that we
[1:17:59] can truly look at any issue and say,
[1:18:01] "What does God's word say about it?"
[1:18:02] Says, "Well, he doesn't say much." Well,
[1:18:03] then I'm not going to say much.
[1:18:06] Not going to tie myself to it. What does
[1:18:07] God say about this? Well, this is what
[1:18:09] the word says. Well, I'm going to take
[1:18:10] what God says. There's no other way to
[1:18:12] make sense. There's no other way to have
[1:18:13] peace. There's no other way to make your
[1:18:15] stand except through the word of God.
[1:18:17] Because we cannot fix our chaos.
[1:18:21] We cannot do it. We can't make sense of
[1:18:23] it. We can't try to rearrange the parts
[1:18:25] and make everything fit. Satan brought
[1:18:26] confusion. And Satan complicated the
[1:18:29] complexity of the simplicity of life.
[1:18:32] Satan did that.
[1:18:34] And trust me, you can't make sense of
[1:18:36] the complications. You have to come back
[1:18:38] to being simple to the word. And God
[1:18:40] will navigate you through the
[1:18:42] complexity. And oh, the simplicity that
[1:18:44] is on the other side of that. That's
[1:18:46] where to live.
[1:18:49] Right now, you may just think
[1:18:50] everything's complicated. Then just
[1:18:51] simply believe him. Simply trust him.
[1:18:56] Do what his word says. If his word says
[1:18:57] repent, repent. If it says to be
[1:18:59] baptized, be baptized. If the word says
[1:19:00] to do something, just do it. Trust him.
[1:19:02] Depend upon him. Take his word. Feed on
[1:19:04] his word. Have a greater appetite for
[1:19:06] the Bible. Have a greater appetite for
[1:19:08] the message of the hour. Feed on it.
[1:19:10] Feed on it. Pray. C. Search his heart.
[1:19:12] Search with your whole heart. Seek his
[1:19:14] face. Be simple to him.
[1:19:17] And then watch him just we bring you
[1:19:18] right into the complexities. And then
[1:19:21] you start making sense of it. Oh, well,
[1:19:22] now that we're in it, now I begin to see
[1:19:25] how these things fit. and you'll arrive
[1:19:27] back at simplicity again.
[1:19:30] And that's where we want to live. We
[1:19:32] want to we don't want to be the ones,
[1:19:33] well, it's just I don't want to
[1:19:34] understand. I don't want to know. I just
[1:19:35] want to figure it doesn't matter. This
[1:19:37] no no God take me now in my simplicity
[1:19:39] towards you. I believe you. I trust you
[1:19:42] now. God, I'm relying upon you to bring
[1:19:44] me through these complexities.
[1:19:47] What did Adam and Eve do? They sewed fig
[1:19:49] leaves together and made themselves
[1:19:51] aprons.
[1:19:52] It was their human response to the
[1:19:54] complexity. What did they just do? They
[1:19:55] complicated it. Nah, no, you don't need
[1:19:58] those.
[1:20:00] Could you imagine now the panic,
[1:20:04] the stress,
[1:20:06] and the utter chaos? I really, really
[1:20:08] want you to I would even love it if you
[1:20:10] gasped
[1:20:13] as you thought about the very moment
[1:20:15] that they both woke to the horror that
[1:20:18] they had destroyed everything that's
[1:20:21] perfect.
[1:20:23] You don't have to raise your hands, but
[1:20:24] have any of you ever dreamed you killed
[1:20:26] somebody?
[1:20:27] And in your dream, your life's over.
[1:20:30] Like, how do you know, brother Aaron?
[1:20:31] I've had this weird dream before.
[1:20:34] Might as well. I didn't do it alone. And
[1:20:35] my dad was with me. How's that, brother
[1:20:37] David?
[1:20:39] You have this dream and your life is
[1:20:40] over.
[1:20:42] I And I It was just the knowledge. I
[1:20:45] just had this sense of guilt and feeling
[1:20:46] that it had happened. I didn't actually
[1:20:48] get to, you know, do it in my dream. So,
[1:20:50] I I missed out on that part.
[1:20:52] But the feeling I felt in my sleep, your
[1:20:55] life's over. You be like, I'm going to
[1:20:58] I'm going to jail. I can't live with
[1:20:59] this guilt. What happened that that
[1:21:00] family and this and I remember the
[1:21:02] experiences, the feelings you have in
[1:21:04] your in your dreams. Even if you do
[1:21:05] something in your dream you know you're
[1:21:06] not supposed to do, you're so
[1:21:08] overwhelmed with guilt. You begin to
[1:21:09] articulate it in your subconscious.
[1:21:11] Everything's changed. Everything's
[1:21:13] ordered over. Your marriage is
[1:21:15] destroyed. Your life is upside down. Can
[1:21:17] you imagine multiply it by a Brazilian?
[1:21:20] That's how they felt.
[1:21:23] That's how they felt in that moment.
[1:21:24] That's how they felt in that instance.
[1:21:26] And as they felt this guilt and this
[1:21:28] shame and this panic and this stress and
[1:21:30] other chaos, it was a guilt stricken
[1:21:32] fear induced panic that caused them to
[1:21:34] reach for fig leaves and cover
[1:21:36] themselves.
[1:21:38] And that still resides within man. That
[1:21:40] in the knowledge of their shame and
[1:21:42] their guilt, they still want to reach
[1:21:43] for a solution themselves. When what we
[1:21:45] ought to do is in our brokenness, in our
[1:21:47] shame, say, "God, you fix me. Yes,
[1:21:50] I'm not good enough. I'm not able
[1:21:52] enough. I'm not smart enough. I'm not
[1:21:54] wise enough. I'm naked. I'm ashamed.
[1:21:57] God, fix me.
[1:22:01] God made it very, very simple in the
[1:22:03] beginning.
[1:22:04] And when he did so, he took the burden
[1:22:06] of complexity away from the man and the
[1:22:08] woman. But then this life
[1:22:11] which was simple yet complex was taken
[1:22:14] away from them. They had work. They had
[1:22:17] responsibility. They had a vast expanse
[1:22:19] full of life, things to fulfill. There
[1:22:21] was all these things that they had to
[1:22:22] do. It was complex, but it was simple.
[1:22:26] But the fall complicated
[1:22:30] complicated all of it.
[1:22:34] This advanced knowledge, this wisdom,
[1:22:36] this knowledge that Satan had given
[1:22:38] them, their eyes being open, what it
[1:22:39] brings, distress, sorrow, discomfort.
[1:22:44] In Genesis 3 16-19, let me just go
[1:22:48] through it very quickly. The woman was
[1:22:50] to bring forth children
[1:22:54] and even in that it could have it was
[1:22:56] complex. There's things we even now
[1:22:58] today we still even through the word of
[1:22:59] God aren't exactly sure how that would
[1:23:02] have happened. Brother Bam just says by
[1:23:03] mixing themselves together.
[1:23:05] So it would have they have been a
[1:23:07] complex process but what would they have
[1:23:08] done? Just trusted them.
[1:23:11] They could have partaken of the tree of
[1:23:12] life. it seems anytime they wanted to.
[1:23:15] There was something that they could have
[1:23:16] done. There was something that could
[1:23:18] have been brought to pass and it was
[1:23:20] just simple no matter how complex it
[1:23:21] was. But now it says, "I'm going to
[1:23:22] greatly multiply your sorrow and your
[1:23:24] conception and when you bring forth
[1:23:25] children, it's going to be in sorrow."
[1:23:28] She has to be told your desires to your
[1:23:30] husband and that he will rule over thee.
[1:23:32] It's complicated. Now I say complicated,
[1:23:36] now it's even more complex. But now
[1:23:37] things are different. It's comp. Now
[1:23:38] they're trying to relate to things. Adam
[1:23:40] who at one time would have had power
[1:23:42] over all the earth to eat anything that
[1:23:44] he would of. The ground is cursed and
[1:23:45] sorrow. He's going to eat of it. The
[1:23:47] field is gonna bring forth weeds and
[1:23:50] thistles and thorns and he can still eat
[1:23:52] but it's going to be in the sweat of his
[1:23:54] face that he's going to eat bread until
[1:23:55] what? Till you return into the ground.
[1:23:59] So now he's very conscious and as a
[1:24:01] daily reminder, I'm headed back to dust
[1:24:03] again.
[1:24:04] This is the reality that is born in
[1:24:06] Genesis chapter 3. Brother Brandham
[1:24:08] makes the statement, I believe, in
[1:24:09] marriage and divorce. And when he reads
[1:24:10] Genesis 3:15, he says, "Now that ends
[1:24:12] the beginning."
[1:24:15] Why? There's no way to make sense and
[1:24:18] reconcile the two. It's something
[1:24:20] completely different. Now,
[1:24:23] it's not even well, there was just kind
[1:24:24] of this blending. If there was any
[1:24:26] blending from the moment that Eve felt
[1:24:27] this down in her soul and then came
[1:24:29] under this anointing to not perceive
[1:24:31] that the image of God had left them. If
[1:24:33] there was any blending, we read it all
[1:24:34] in Genesis chapter 3 that God
[1:24:36] establishes this separation. And now man
[1:24:40] is thrust into a world and this is the
[1:24:43] world we know. The Genesis 3:16-19
[1:24:47] world. That's the world we know. But the
[1:24:50] man and the woman
[1:24:54] entered into that world having left a
[1:24:56] perfect one.
[1:24:58] It's beautiful to think that we're going
[1:25:00] to leave an imperfect one, step right
[1:25:02] into a perfect one. I love the symmetry
[1:25:05] of God.
[1:25:08] And the concerns and the considerations
[1:25:09] that the man and the wife would now have
[1:25:12] to carry were more than they originally
[1:25:14] had to bear.
[1:25:18] And the reality is you're bearing them
[1:25:21] right now.
[1:25:23] That's the reality. Every single one of
[1:25:25] you bears in some manner some way the
[1:25:29] pain, the shame, the guilt, the
[1:25:31] pressures, and the weight that that man
[1:25:33] and woman must have felt.
[1:25:36] So Christ says in Matthew 11:es 28 to30,
[1:25:39] "Come unto me
[1:25:42] all ye that labor and are heavilen
[1:25:45] and I will give you rest." It's
[1:25:48] beautiful. He just takes all the chaos
[1:25:51] of Genesis 3 and he gives us a little
[1:25:54] bridge that we can take to come back to
[1:25:57] the beginning of Genesis chapter 2 where
[1:26:00] the man and the woman, the man and his
[1:26:01] wife were both naked and not ashamed.
[1:26:03] And what was God doing? He was resting
[1:26:07] and he says, "Why don't you just rest
[1:26:08] again?"
[1:26:10] He said, "Well, thy take come unto me
[1:26:12] who are burdened and heavy laden, come
[1:26:14] and I'll give you rest." And he says,
[1:26:15] "Take my yoke, the yoke that Adam and
[1:26:17] his wife had to bear." They had a yoke,
[1:26:20] but he said, "I'm meek and lowly in
[1:26:22] heart, and ye shall find rest unto your
[1:26:24] souls, for my yoke is easy, and my
[1:26:26] burden is light."
[1:26:29] But they had rest in their souls.
[1:26:32] They had harmony within their spirits.
[1:26:33] And I I believe he's still calling out
[1:26:35] to you today, wherever situation you're
[1:26:38] in. I to the most mature believer today,
[1:26:41] he's saying, "Come unto me. I'll give
[1:26:44] you rest." We're trying. We're we're
[1:26:46] we're far too divided anymore.
[1:26:49] We've diversified not only our our stock
[1:26:52] portfolio and our investment portfolio
[1:26:53] when it comes to finances, but it's
[1:26:55] almost as if we've diversified our
[1:26:56] entire lives.
[1:26:58] I've got this for finances. I got this
[1:27:00] for health. I've got this for nutrition.
[1:27:02] I've got this for for for fashion. And
[1:27:04] we're just divided among all these
[1:27:06] things instead of just coming right back
[1:27:07] at the foot of the Lord and saying
[1:27:08] there's one thing that's needful. I want
[1:27:11] to rest in you seeking first him. Come
[1:27:15] back to the simplicity towards Christ.
[1:27:17] You are my all and all. He says, "You
[1:27:19] that labor heavy laden, you that are
[1:27:21] bound with guilt and shame, all the
[1:27:22] wrestling, all the emotions." He says,
[1:27:24] "Come unto me. I will give you rest.
[1:27:26] Take my yoke. Yes, I have a yoke, but
[1:27:28] it's easy and it's light. And in that
[1:27:30] bearing that you'll find rest unto your
[1:27:33] souls. Only one refuge, Christ. Only one
[1:27:37] hope, Christ.
[1:27:39] Only one rest for soul, the soul of man.
[1:27:43] It's the only rest. As I thought about
[1:27:46] this last week,
[1:27:48] the man and his wife were restless in
[1:27:52] their soul when their eyes were opened.
[1:27:56] And the soul of man could never find
[1:27:59] rest until Christ said, "Come unto me."
[1:28:04] The soul of man through thousands of
[1:28:06] years could never find rest. But now,
[1:28:10] even after 6,000 years, the restless
[1:28:13] souls of men can find rest in Christ.
[1:28:18] I want to leave this thought in your
[1:28:20] mind.
[1:28:22] I was waiting for brother Loyal to come
[1:28:24] and play bass, but he's not here. So
[1:28:25] that's my excuse for going for so long.
[1:28:29] But let me leave this thought with you.
[1:28:31] The gospel is simple,
[1:28:33] but it's also deep,
[1:28:36] very complex, I would say, using the
[1:28:38] word in a qualified way.
[1:28:45] But to appreciate its simplicity, you
[1:28:47] must desire its depth.
[1:28:51] To truly appreciate just how simple and
[1:28:55] beautiful it is, you must desire to know
[1:28:57] it and to know it completely and desire
[1:29:01] wisdom and knowledge and understanding.
[1:29:03] Don't be simple that says, "Well, I
[1:29:06] don't need to know. I don't need to have
[1:29:08] understanding." It's that simple one
[1:29:09] that's deceived.
[1:29:11] But be simple towards it. Say, "Lord, I
[1:29:14] believe it. Now give me understanding."
[1:29:17] Come unto him. Let's stand to our feet.
[1:29:20] Come unto him, ye that are labor, that
[1:29:23] labor and are heavy laden,
[1:29:26] and you'll find rest in your soul.
[1:29:29] You'll find the rest that Adam
[1:29:31] forfeited. You'll find the rest that the
[1:29:32] woman walked away from. You'll find rest
[1:29:35] in your soul.
[1:29:40] Let's bow our heads.
[1:29:46] [Music]
[1:29:55] We don't have an altar.
[1:29:58] And I believe the Lord still I believe
[1:30:00] God uses the altar.
[1:30:03] It's where people are
[1:30:05] born and sealed with the Holy Ghost.
[1:30:09] It's a place that people's faith can
[1:30:11] find a resting a spot to seek his face.
[1:30:15] But I I I would place before you the
[1:30:18] altar as it were of your heart today
[1:30:23] and say, "Lord, I'm I've come to this
[1:30:26] altar today. I've come to you and I cast
[1:30:28] my cares upon you.
[1:30:30] I'm I'm unburdening myself.
[1:30:36] Come to him."
[1:30:38] If you'd like to do it, just by lifting
[1:30:40] your hands and saying, "Lord, this is my
[1:30:42] sign of surrender.
[1:30:44] coming to your feet today. I'm not
[1:30:47] kneeling at an altar because this room
[1:30:49] doesn't have one. But thank God there's
[1:30:51] one in my heart. And what I do in this
[1:30:53] moment is I surrender.
[1:30:56] I surrender to you, Lord.
[1:30:59] Let's bow our heads. Our gracious
[1:31:01] heavenly father, as we've lifted our
[1:31:03] hands in a sign of surrender,
[1:31:08] we're coming to you to find rest in our
[1:31:10] souls.
[1:31:12] Lord, it's a rest that we find as
[1:31:15] sinners
[1:31:17] and it's a rest that we find as
[1:31:18] believers
[1:31:20] that we get so spread out and so worn
[1:31:22] and so weary and so battle torn and
[1:31:26] sometimes Lord we're just thinking about
[1:31:27] the logistics of battle and the wounds
[1:31:29] and scars and the ferocity of the
[1:31:32] fighting and we forget that we won.
[1:31:35] [Music]
[1:31:36] We forget the victories. We forget what
[1:31:38] was conquered. We forget the the joy
[1:31:40] that soon followed when the the answer
[1:31:43] came and the sickness was healed or the
[1:31:46] problem was solved. Lord, we just seem
[1:31:48] to carry within us instincts and
[1:31:51] reflexes and wounds from the battles
[1:31:54] in this terrible war of attrition. In
[1:31:56] this end time, we find ourselves failing
[1:31:58] for strength
[1:32:00] and in the weariness of our minds and
[1:32:02] being taxed and pressed. Lord, so easy
[1:32:06] begin to lose focus and ponder this and
[1:32:09] wonder that and even question one
[1:32:12] another's love and commitment and begin
[1:32:13] to look at relationships and people
[1:32:15] through the wrong kind of view. And we
[1:32:18] despair of connectedness. We despair of
[1:32:20] communion. We despair of continuity and
[1:32:22] harmony. And we're worried that we're
[1:32:24] going to be alone. And we're worried
[1:32:25] that things are falling apart. And it's
[1:32:27] only because we've allowed Satan to
[1:32:28] paint a picture.
[1:32:30] [Music]
[1:32:31] allowed him to frame a scenario. Lord,
[1:32:34] may we just cast that image down today.
[1:32:37] May we just take the frame and throw it
[1:32:38] into the fire. Take that picture and
[1:32:40] tear it up into a million pieces. Lord,
[1:32:42] burn it up.
[1:32:44] Lord, we look at you and say, "Lord, I
[1:32:46] only want to see evil through your eyes.
[1:32:48] Lord, I only want to see the picture as
[1:32:50] you have framed it. I only want to see
[1:32:51] Leodysia as you would want me to see it.
[1:32:53] I only want to see my wife as you would
[1:32:55] want me to see her. I only want to see
[1:32:56] my brother as you would want me to see
[1:32:58] her."
[1:33:00] Lord, it's complicated in my mind. It's
[1:33:02] complicated in my heart. It's
[1:33:03] complicated in my life. But Lord, I know
[1:33:05] complication is only rooted in the
[1:33:07] confusion that sin brings. So Lord, I
[1:33:10] come to you and to be unbburdened and to
[1:33:12] be forgiven that I might find rest for
[1:33:15] my soul.
[1:33:17] And not that life would all of a sudden
[1:33:19] become so simple. It's not complex,
[1:33:22] but that I could be simple towards your
[1:33:24] word. That it would lead me through the
[1:33:27] complexities.
[1:33:29] I pray that you touch us today.
[1:33:32] In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we
[1:33:33] pray.
