[0:03] verse
[0:03] 8 first kings chapter 17 verses 8
[0:07] to 16.
[0:10] we welcome all of our visitors that are
[0:12] here today may god
[0:14] be your portion and we appreciate the
[0:16] show of love and
[0:17] kindness towards us to come visit us and
[0:20] show support during this
[0:21] time of beginning for a new church first
[0:24] kings chapter 17 verses 8
[0:27] to 16 and the word of the lord came unto
[0:30] him saying and speaking to elijah who
[0:31] has just now been
[0:33] fed at the brook cherith uh for many
[0:35] days by ravens
[0:37] but now the book dries up and it says
[0:40] the word of the lord came unto him
[0:41] saying arise
[0:42] get to this airpath which belongeth to
[0:44] zidan
[0:45] and dwell there and behold i have
[0:47] commanded a widow woman there to sustain
[0:49] thee
[0:50] so he arose and went to zarephath and
[0:52] when he came to the gate of the city
[0:54] behold the widow woman was there
[0:56] gathering of sticks and he called to her
[0:58] and said
[0:59] fetch me i pray thee a little water and
[1:01] a vessel that i may drink
[1:03] and as she was going to fetch it he
[1:04] called her and said bring me i pray thee
[1:07] a morsel of bread in thine hand
[1:09] and she said as the lord thy god liveth
[1:12] i have not a cake
[1:13] but a handful of meal in a barrel and a
[1:15] little oil and a cruise
[1:16] and behold i'm gathering two sticks that
[1:19] i may go in and dress it for me
[1:21] and my son that we may eat it and die
[1:24] and elijah said unto her fear not
[1:26] go and do as thou hast said but make me
[1:29] thereof a little cake first
[1:31] and bring it unto me and after make for
[1:34] thee and for thy son
[1:35] for thus saith the lord god of israel
[1:38] the barrel of mill shall not waste
[1:39] neither shall the crucifoil fail until
[1:41] the day that the lord sendeth rain upon
[1:43] the earth
[1:44] and she went and did according to the
[1:46] saint of elijah
[1:48] and she and he and her house did eat
[1:51] many days and the barrel of mill wasted
[1:53] not neither did the cruce of oil fail
[1:56] according to the word of the lord which
[1:57] he spake by
[1:59] elijah amen let's bow our heads and go
[2:02] to the lord in prayer
[2:10] our gracious heavenly father lord we're
[2:11] so thankful once again to have
[2:14] a body that we can gather with a people
[2:16] that share a precious faith
[2:19] to stand shoulder to shoulder with those
[2:21] that love your word and come with
[2:23] expectation
[2:24] lord we're grateful to be gathered with
[2:26] those that are just searching
[2:28] and with the hunger in their hearts for
[2:31] something from you
[2:32] lord we're grateful that we could create
[2:34] an atmosphere that the the hurting
[2:37] and the confused could come searching
[2:39] and feel love
[2:40] and find a place of rest lord we're
[2:43] happy if we only
[2:44] sojourn for a short time with the
[2:46] traveler and provide some respite or
[2:49] nourishment
[2:49] or ministering for lord we realize that
[2:52] we're just
[2:54] all part of a great body we're each one
[2:56] doing what
[2:58] we feel we are called to do to serve a
[3:00] greater purpose and not our own
[3:02] and lord we're so thankful to be part of
[3:05] we use the phrase agenda but we're so
[3:07] grateful to be part of an agenda and a
[3:08] purpose that is greater than our own
[3:10] personal agendas
[3:11] we're so grateful to be part of
[3:12] something that's supernatural
[3:15] that climax is not with the renown of a
[3:18] name and the renown of an individual or
[3:20] the
[3:20] lifting up of a personality but will
[3:22] climax with the meeting in the air where
[3:24] and we see you face to face
[3:26] and lord we desired that we would take
[3:28] our loved ones with us in that lord we
[3:30] desire to even see our neighbors
[3:31] impacted by this word we desire to see
[3:34] that you would have the preeminence in
[3:35] people's lives to
[3:37] the point of a new birth a maturing and
[3:40] a change of their bodies
[3:42] and lord as we see that that is by
[3:44] election and predestination
[3:46] our service would not stop only to those
[3:48] who could experience the change of their
[3:50] bodies
[3:51] but lord may our lives and our testimony
[3:53] and our purpose
[3:55] extend beyond that lord and be an
[3:57] expression of love and opportunity to
[3:59] those who are less fortunate
[4:01] and lord may we live with the type of
[4:02] character that
[4:04] is admirable not only in your eyes lord
[4:07] but in the eyes of
[4:08] of other of men that they see in
[4:10] integrity and an honesty
[4:12] and lord i pray today that as we have
[4:14] gathered in your presence you would take
[4:15] the word and speak to us
[4:16] as only you can as there's so many open
[4:19] hearts lord
[4:20] today i feel that there should be
[4:22] nothing hindering
[4:24] the word from going forth lord as i
[4:27] in my minds i look out upon the
[4:29] congregation
[4:30] lord i know that there's needs that need
[4:32] to be met
[4:33] and they can only be met by your word so
[4:36] now father individually not myself
[4:38] confessing as one that would speak but
[4:39] now
[4:40] father individually is those that will
[4:42] hear we lay aside
[4:43] our own filter we lay aside our own
[4:46] expectations that would be
[4:47] our own ideas of what we need and we say
[4:50] lord you
[4:51] feed me what i personally have need of
[4:54] today
[4:54] bless this word may it be a strength to
[4:56] us i pray have preeminence now father
[4:59] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[5:00] amen
[5:02] he may be seated
[5:09] we're continuing on the subject of in
[5:12] the beginning
[5:13] god created and we're coming to the
[5:16] climax
[5:17] of a family and it's something
[5:20] that is embodied in that creation of a
[5:23] family
[5:24] that was expressing something about god
[5:26] and his nature
[5:28] and that's uh and that's why we can come
[5:31] to and arrive at this in the beginning
[5:33] god created
[5:34] we look in the beginning we see the word
[5:36] then we see god acting to create he
[5:38] created heavens and earth we could look
[5:40] at
[5:40] angels and supernatural beings that we
[5:42] could see the earth and the universe and
[5:44] the planets
[5:45] and the stars and all those things that
[5:47] are therein and so there's a lot that is
[5:50] mentioned or meant in the phrase in the
[5:52] beginning god created there's so much
[5:54] that transpires
[5:55] in genesis chapter one and chapter two
[5:57] but we're arriving to what god's
[5:59] ultimate of his creation was where he
[6:01] climaxes in his creation
[6:03] to that point is we see a family
[6:06] and brother branham makes this statement
[6:08] we've been drawing from this in
[6:09] paragraph 176
[6:11] of the masterpiece notice the great
[6:14] masterpiece of
[6:15] the family and he refers to it god's
[6:18] great masterpiece
[6:19] the masterpiece family that's adam and
[6:21] the woman
[6:22] in the garden every seed bringing forth
[6:24] of its kind
[6:25] and this is what brother branham is
[6:27] pointing to is kind of god's
[6:29] great work that makes him a master that
[6:32] he was achieving and wanting to
[6:34] represent
[6:35] in uh of his purpose and who he was now
[6:38] we realized that
[6:39] in that picture it was in some ways a
[6:41] negative
[6:42] of what god would begin to express in
[6:45] christ
[6:46] and his family that would really come
[6:48] forth of his body and of his being
[6:50] but we see it first expressed in a man
[6:52] and a woman and brother man calls it a
[6:53] masterpiece
[6:54] great masterpiece of the family or he
[6:56] uses the express phrase
[6:58] masterpiece family and now he begins to
[7:00] describe
[7:01] what that would have looked like and he
[7:02] says in dozens of places adam and eve
[7:04] were
[7:05] in harmony and perfect love and there
[7:07] was no death and
[7:08] perfect understanding of the love of god
[7:10] and describes that continuity that
[7:11] harmony
[7:12] and that union of the two and he says
[7:14] the husband and wife cannot be
[7:16] truly a family unless they are one so
[7:19] now
[7:19] he begins to use a language that would
[7:21] suggest that family is not just merely
[7:24] relationship or blood relation but it's
[7:26] something that he's trying to point out
[7:27] that
[7:27] you're characterized by they have to be
[7:30] if they're not they're not a
[7:31] good family wife pulling one way and the
[7:34] husband another that would make an
[7:36] awful family and so now he begins to
[7:38] describe it's not just
[7:39] a family but there's something about the
[7:41] family that made it a masterpiece but in
[7:44] agreement with love one to the other
[7:46] that's a family he says and now that was
[7:49] god's masterpiece and now all the true
[7:52] family here
[7:53] portrays that now this is kind of our
[7:59] um a statement on a true
[8:02] family a masterpiece family a
[8:06] uh all true family portrays that kind of
[8:08] taking that phrasing
[8:09] that he says all true family here so a
[8:11] true family on earth today
[8:13] portrays this masterpiece family that
[8:16] god was bringing forth in the beginning
[8:19] now i realize in saying that that kind
[8:20] of creates a real heavy standard
[8:22] and it kind of creates the benchmark and
[8:24] that's one why we express the things
[8:26] that we did on wednesday night
[8:27] on uh not taking certain conception
[8:30] preconceived ideas and filter
[8:32] what the word of god is saying and
[8:34] filter it to achieve some kind of
[8:35] perfect picture that you're trying to
[8:37] achieve
[8:38] no we're just yielding to the word of
[8:40] god and letting him have his way
[8:42] and if he says you're going to be
[8:43] perfect don't fight it
[8:45] well if i'm going to be perfect lord
[8:47] it's going to be something you're going
[8:47] to do right
[8:49] if i'm going to be perfect it's going to
[8:50] be by a perfect blood it's going to be
[8:52] about a perfect word i'm not going to
[8:53] make myself
[8:54] that so so much of it is just yielding
[8:56] so much of it is just getting out of the
[8:58] way
[8:58] and i remember first time i met sister
[9:00] brenda lewis and um
[9:02] and i and it was i felt it was just a
[9:04] real privilege to be able to meet her
[9:05] she'd written so many
[9:06] tremendous songs and the message and i
[9:09] remember saying god bless you sister
[9:10] brenda how are you doing she said
[9:12] i'm just trying to keep out of his way
[9:13] and i thought amen to that
[9:15] that that's my that's my theme
[9:18] i'm just trying to keep out of his way
[9:19] if you get out of his way guess what you
[9:21] can become a masterpiece
[9:23] so it's not that god gives you an image
[9:25] that you need to try to make yourself
[9:28] into and you're going to try to filter
[9:30] your life to create this perfect picture
[9:32] in this facade
[9:33] let them start doing something on the
[9:34] inside and then a lot of it has nothing
[9:37] to do with what we think in the natural
[9:38] because for
[9:39] a lot of people the natural pitch
[9:41] pictures marred
[9:43] and what we want to become is what god
[9:45] in the beginning saw us that we were
[9:47] going to be
[9:48] in his image according to the word i
[9:50] mean you think about
[9:52] uh you just think about jesus i realize
[9:54] there's such a tremendous pull
[9:55] in liberty this morning so i'm really
[9:57] just going to relax myself and just
[9:59] follow wherever you drag me
[10:01] but if we took the image of a
[10:03] masterpiece family a man and a woman and
[10:05] we
[10:05] and we carnally filter things out and
[10:08] say this is what makes a masterpiece
[10:09] where does that leave jesus
[10:13] he's considered an illegitimate child
[10:16] never marries never has children lives a
[10:18] whole a single life
[10:19] and and so we can take the word of god
[10:21] and begin to beat ourselves down because
[10:22] of our situation not realizing
[10:24] look at christ what christ expressed and
[10:26] what he manifested
[10:27] and didn't fall short of the image so we
[10:31] we can't be carnal and pretty much now
[10:33] we could just sing take the name of
[10:34] jesus with you
[10:35] because in a lot of ways that's just
[10:36] what i'm trying to express is it's the
[10:38] word the image that we're trying to come
[10:40] into not our carnal
[10:41] understanding of what these things mean
[10:43] but this is what god wants to
[10:45] achieve and he says god's masterpiece
[10:47] was a family
[10:49] a true family in agreement in harmony
[10:52] and love and then he's saying a true
[10:54] family here
[10:54] portrays that and we were looking at
[10:57] last time this is just kind of trying to
[10:59] review to put some building blocks out
[11:01] there again
[11:02] how that there was an image in heaven
[11:04] and creation began to reflect that image
[11:07] and so god first created an unseen realm
[11:10] unseen to our natural eye
[11:11] unseen to these dimensions of light time
[11:13] and space that we live in
[11:15] and then as god created on earth it
[11:16] began to reflect something in heaven
[11:19] we saw that example when moses built the
[11:20] tabernacle he built it after the temple
[11:22] the tabernacle he saw in heaven
[11:24] and then ephesians 3 15 speaking of the
[11:27] father and also the son
[11:29] of whom the whole family in heaven and
[11:32] earth is named
[11:33] so the whole family in heaven it shows
[11:35] that god has set a pattern in heaven
[11:38] of the family so there's an order
[11:40] there's an arrangement there's
[11:41] relationship there's structure to the
[11:43] family
[11:44] and then now he's saying there's a
[11:45] family in earth and brother saying
[11:47] that you as a family here are to portray
[11:50] a masterpiece family
[11:51] and the perfect image of the masterpiece
[11:53] family is in heaven
[11:55] and so we desire that what is done in
[11:57] heaven is also done in earth
[11:59] that's what we pray let it be done in
[12:01] earth let thy will be done now in earth
[12:03] as it is in heaven
[12:04] so whatever image is expressed in heaven
[12:06] that's what i want to express here on
[12:08] earth
[12:09] and so what we were ending in is how
[12:11] that god has
[12:12] commissioned you and you should look at
[12:14] his eye as an individual whatever family
[12:16] situation he's placed me in
[12:18] whatever relationships i'm sharing
[12:20] familial and even be through friendships
[12:22] and church relationships were
[12:23] commissioned to manifest
[12:25] his image to bear a heavenly image and
[12:28] therefore if god has commissioned you to
[12:30] do something
[12:30] it's very beautiful god never
[12:32] commissions without equipping
[12:34] he's never going to tell you to go do
[12:36] something without giving you the tools
[12:37] or resources to do it
[12:39] and i could be told to do something and
[12:41] my dad could say son go build the shed
[12:43] and i just say well i need the tools
[12:45] he'll say the tools are tools are in
[12:46] that shed
[12:48] well i need the i need the wood and here
[12:50] they are here they are and he could give
[12:51] me all the tools and all the
[12:53] all the materials and the nails and the
[12:55] wood and the concrete and he could give
[12:57] them to me and you know what i still
[12:58] wouldn't be able to build a shed
[13:01] i could watch youtube video after
[13:02] youtube video i i just
[13:04] i would need more i would need some kind
[13:07] of know-how some kind of experi
[13:09] experience some kind of talent or gift
[13:11] to be able to build the shed
[13:12] and make it worth using and so in the
[13:15] natural
[13:16] we realize many times we have resources
[13:18] we have tools we have materials we have
[13:20] everything we need
[13:21] but it just seems like something's
[13:22] lacking to pull it all together and pull
[13:24] it off
[13:24] and some people in life we realize they
[13:26] just have the knack to do it
[13:28] they're just born with a particular
[13:29] knack i've got the golf clubs i've got
[13:31] the golf balls i've got the nice pants
[13:33] i've got the hat i've got the golf club
[13:35] membership and i just can't seem to get
[13:37] the ball in the hole
[13:38] unless i'm eight over on the whole and
[13:41] then some people
[13:41] are just able to do it and that we
[13:45] experience that in the natural
[13:46] but when it comes to achieving god's
[13:49] goal for us in the spiritual
[13:50] you're not lacking he's providing
[13:54] resources material and the gifts and
[13:57] talents
[13:57] necessary to achieve it he'll provide it
[14:00] all and he'll see that you accomplish it
[14:02] so you've been commissioned in this way
[14:05] to express these things and again
[14:06] we're removing the filter we want to
[14:08] take god's word as it comes to us
[14:10] just as it is now i want to pick back up
[14:12] in genesis chapter 2 verse 22
[14:15] and just laying some things out there
[14:17] that are uh
[14:18] somewhat of a review and forming a basis
[14:21] for where we're wanting to go today
[14:23] and god sees man it's not good that man
[14:26] should be alone i need to make him help
[14:27] me someone that will assist him in his
[14:29] labor
[14:30] someone that will be able to be another
[14:32] part of himself to fulfill the
[14:33] commission of genesis 1 28.
[14:35] it says and the rib which the lord god
[14:37] had taken from man
[14:39] made he a woman and brought her unto
[14:42] the man what a powerful powerful phrase
[14:46] so remarkable we're identifying how that
[14:48] god just did not merely say i put adam
[14:50] to sleep i took a part of him
[14:52] and i made flesh but he identified the
[14:54] rib and the rib itself speaks of sight
[14:56] or chamber the word is even used
[14:58] of chambers rooms or cells in the
[15:00] tabernacle it's even used of the wood
[15:03] that was used to create certain rooms
[15:05] and elements of the tabernacle
[15:07] which later were overlaid with gold and
[15:09] so what is it what is it speaking to
[15:11] it's speaking to flesh
[15:13] being being covered in deity flesh being
[15:16] made
[15:16] made word and and god is reflecting
[15:19] these things in the tabernacle
[15:20] and so from the rib he took building
[15:23] materials
[15:24] this is the building material of the
[15:25] woman there's so much that's
[15:27] beautifully represented in using the rib
[15:29] it says made he a woman that's eshop
[15:32] and it speaks of a wife he didn't just
[15:34] make a female
[15:35] man was already male and female but now
[15:38] that he brings out a fleshly expression
[15:41] of the woman he is no longer adam but he
[15:45] becomes ish he becomes husband
[15:47] says she came from man she becomes wife
[15:50] so male and female have moved to another
[15:52] expression now by relationship
[15:54] husband and wife now the the word i want
[15:57] to focus on today just for a few moments
[15:59] is
[15:59] it says made he a woman the word they're
[16:03] made is bana which means to build
[16:06] even to it's used to rebuild but it
[16:09] means to establish or cause to continue
[16:12] so there's something that god is
[16:14] expressing that you have man who's the
[16:15] original
[16:16] then he makes a woman so this is a
[16:18] continuation of the man
[16:19] and the word is literally used in and
[16:22] has this meaning in the hebrew
[16:24] to build a house or to establish a
[16:26] family
[16:28] so when god made the woman you we have
[16:30] to understand what god's trying to
[16:31] accomplish what god is representing
[16:33] in making this woman so it means to
[16:35] build a house
[16:36] or to establish a family made he a
[16:40] woman made he a wife what is the woman
[16:42] going to be she's going to be a
[16:43] homemaker
[16:45] what is what is she going to what is she
[16:47] going to do she's going to be one that
[16:49] continues the family
[16:50] through her is going to come a son so
[16:52] the family is unfolding
[16:54] he it was male and female to man and
[16:56] woman now husband and wife this is god's
[16:59] masterpiece that's unfolding from the
[17:01] man
[17:02] and then in genesis 3 16 god speaks of
[17:05] the woman and says that she shall
[17:06] bring forth children that has been
[17:08] that's the word there has been
[17:10] that word ben which is son comes from
[17:12] bana which
[17:13] made he a woman what is the son he's
[17:15] made
[17:16] he's made from a union he is in the
[17:19] jewish
[17:20] use of the word heber the son is a
[17:22] builder of the family name
[17:24] so you have man who is male and female
[17:27] he now
[17:28] he now has a woman that's brought out of
[17:30] him
[17:31] and now you have the woman and man is
[17:33] not just male and female now he's
[17:35] male as a ish as a husband and the woman
[17:39] is not just female but she's wife
[17:42] and now husband and wife as the woman in
[17:44] the very
[17:45] her very genesis and her makeup and when
[17:47] she's being formed she is one that's
[17:48] going to
[17:49] be used to build a family she's going to
[17:51] be one that establishes a family
[17:53] so adam and the woman are going to make
[17:55] a family and then when a son comes forth
[17:58] he's a further expression and he's a
[18:00] builder of the family name
[18:02] so god was building a family when he
[18:04] made the woman and brought her out of
[18:05] adam
[18:06] and this is a reflection of the family
[18:09] that god would ultimately achieve and
[18:11] build through his son jesus christ
[18:15] so the left the left side or the right
[18:17] side agrees
[18:18] so now we i was preaching a meeting one
[18:21] time and i asked how many here have an
[18:22] android phone
[18:24] and to my left everyone on the left
[18:26] raised their hand or if there was any
[18:27] hands or is all on the left said how
[18:28] many here own an iphone and everyone on
[18:30] the right raising
[18:31] they had literally divided the uh the
[18:33] congregation by android and iphone
[18:36] and this was maybe not quite third world
[18:38] but it was quebec
[18:40] and uh and it was it was really
[18:42] staggering that it divided along those
[18:44] lines
[18:45] and then just to kind of you could read
[18:47] into it all you want the right side was
[18:49] sisters and the left side was brothers
[18:52] and uh who had the better camera for
[18:54] selfies
[18:57] but we got a really good amen from the
[18:59] left side of the right side of the
[19:00] congregation today
[19:03] when we mentioned how that the first
[19:04] family was just a reflection
[19:06] of the ultimate family that god was
[19:08] going to build to his son jesus christ
[19:10] that's better so the
[19:15] this type that god is bringing forth in
[19:17] adam and the woman
[19:20] is the first flesh type the first type
[19:23] in flesh of the dwelling place of god
[19:27] that the son jesus or christ
[19:30] and his daughter the son and the
[19:32] daughter god's son and god's daughter
[19:34] man and wife church in bridegroom bride
[19:37] bridegroom
[19:38] would express later on so hearing god in
[19:40] the beginning
[19:41] adam and eve become the first flesh type
[19:43] of the dwelling place of god
[19:45] that christ which is the son of god and
[19:47] his daughter the daughter which is the
[19:49] bride become
[19:50] because god is going to dwell in his
[19:51] people he's going to become one with
[19:53] this people
[19:54] in isaiah chapter 66 verse 1 it says
[19:56] thus saith the lord
[19:58] the heaven is my throne and the earth is
[20:00] my footstool
[20:04] now these are i was had wanted to use
[20:06] this scripture in the past and i kept
[20:07] kind of bringing it out of
[20:09] out of my notes because it represents
[20:11] again in one picture
[20:12] heaven and earth somehow being connected
[20:15] having some harmony and continuity
[20:17] having a connection to each other
[20:18] heaven is my throne and the earth is my
[20:20] footstool now we read that like
[20:22] footstool oh it's just something that's
[20:24] made subject and under his feet but it
[20:25] speaks of a resting place
[20:27] footstool is a resting place and you'll
[20:29] find that in the scripture the footstool
[20:31] is the place of worship
[20:33] so heaven is the throne a place of
[20:34] authority and a place of power
[20:36] but then when he makes the earth his
[20:37] footstool we don't look at it as like
[20:39] something under your feet and you look
[20:40] under your feet you see all the crumbs
[20:42] and all the dirt and everything
[20:43] no the footstool is a place where the
[20:44] feet would be rested and then even in
[20:47] the scripture and the psalms in
[20:48] different places and
[20:49] and david even speaking when you want to
[20:51] build a tabernacle the tabernacle the
[20:53] temple
[20:53] and the place of worship the where the
[20:55] ark rested it was called the footstool
[20:57] because that's a place of worship and so
[20:59] he god is it his heaven is in the throne
[21:02] is in heaven but the place of worship
[21:03] and rest is
[21:04] is on earth this is what's being
[21:06] expressed in the tabernacle in the
[21:07] wilderness and even in the temple
[21:09] then he says where is the house that you
[21:11] build and demean
[21:13] in other words how can you contain the
[21:15] infinite god
[21:16] how are you going to build a house for
[21:18] god and where is the place of my rest
[21:20] who can contain my fullness
[21:21] where is the place that i'm going to
[21:23] find rest and many scholars would read
[21:25] this and say that god is essentially
[21:27] saying you can't do it
[21:28] or there is no place but we realize
[21:31] that there's something that's being
[21:33] expressed here
[21:34] by prophecy in isaiah 66 and maybe by
[21:37] rhetorical question by
[21:38] inquiry uh who's worthy to take the
[21:40] seals and loose them
[21:42] and we know there was one to do it but
[21:44] where is where house will you build
[21:46] where is the place in my rest we realize
[21:47] today that the body
[21:48] is his place of rest paul when he takes
[21:51] this scripture
[21:52] and he writes it in acts chapter 7 verse
[21:54] 49 what are luke writes it actually what
[21:56] house will you build me
[21:58] there this word that house is used what
[22:01] house will you build me this house in
[22:02] the hebrews baith
[22:04] which means a family of descendants what
[22:05] house what household will you build me
[22:07] it speaks of a family what house
[22:10] will you build me and the word is
[22:13] household what family are you going to
[22:14] build me
[22:15] it comes from bana when made he a woman
[22:18] bana he a woman and a a wife an isha
[22:22] it's the same word that is used to
[22:24] create the bring forth children ben
[22:26] which comes from benad now what house
[22:28] will you
[22:28] build me from but not to build a house
[22:30] to establish a family
[22:33] so there's a theme that's being
[22:34] connected here there's something being
[22:36] expressed and paul
[22:37] or luke when he writes it what house you
[22:38] build me in the expression of
[22:40] paul bringing this old testament
[22:41] prophecy in what house it means
[22:43] stock or race or the descendants of one
[22:46] that's the word that's used in the greek
[22:48] so he said what family am i going to
[22:50] become who is going to be the bearer of
[22:52] my name
[22:52] in whom am i going to dwell through whom
[22:54] am i going to be expressed
[22:58] so now brother brennan makes this
[22:59] statement so i'm wanting you to relate
[23:01] a lot of this to on the spiritual side i
[23:04] have this connection to where
[23:06] i am not just a i'm not just a human
[23:09] being that's identified by my natural
[23:11] parents
[23:11] but that god somehow is as much as it's
[23:15] beyond
[23:15] me being able to fully understand and
[23:17] explain to someone that the moment i was
[23:19] even born
[23:21] to my natural mother that god had a
[23:24] supernatural seed ordained for me
[23:28] and that i was in his mind before i ever
[23:30] came forth in flesh
[23:32] and so i have a greater identity in the
[23:34] word than i even do through my natural
[23:36] family think about brother branham he
[23:38] often spoke
[23:39] not very kind about his family you know
[23:42] i i'd be condemned
[23:43] these are my words but he said my dad
[23:45] was a bootlegger my mom was this and
[23:47] he wouldn't brag on he'd often say if if
[23:49] we're looking at the branham if we're
[23:51] all going by branham
[23:52] then then we're he was like then what do
[23:54] i have to show for what
[23:55] what can i give and what's my reputation
[23:57] what's my character and what's my
[23:59] position
[24:00] but once you relate it to the fact that
[24:01] you've been called to a higher order
[24:03] and a higher position in the family of
[24:04] god then you look back and say god
[24:06] you can use whatever my family
[24:08] experiences whatever my family history
[24:10] is
[24:10] because you looked out after it because
[24:13] you allowed it
[24:14] and so it must have some purpose and
[24:16] utility
[24:17] within the context that i have in the
[24:19] greater family in the ultimate family
[24:21] and that being the family of god
[24:23] that way there's no outcast in the
[24:26] family of god
[24:27] i like to teach it this way there's no
[24:28] tonsils
[24:30] right in the body of christ that part of
[24:32] kind of uh we don't think we need you
[24:34] right there there's no appendix in the
[24:37] body of christ
[24:38] well brother you're a little inflamed so
[24:42] we're gonna just cut you out nope every
[24:44] part's necessary
[24:46] so we we have utility we have use we
[24:48] have function we're part of a
[24:50] a greater supernatural design my wife
[24:53] and i were discussing it
[24:54] uh i believe this morning on how that
[24:58] our types are types are not
[25:01] truths in themselves and types are not
[25:04] proofs
[25:05] and so if you use the body as a type
[25:08] of the of the church of the even the
[25:11] local church the local body
[25:12] and just as the body has parts that
[25:14] minister nourishment one to another
[25:16] and you say well if the body is so then
[25:18] you look at the type
[25:19] you don't use the type to produce a
[25:21] proof or a truth
[25:24] they can just be facts but the truth is
[25:27] the word
[25:28] and she said i made her head spin so if
[25:30] your head's spinning then
[25:32] you know you you and my wife can
[25:33] commiserate later
[25:35] but the point is this we get the truth
[25:37] from the word whatever the word says is
[25:39] the truth
[25:40] then we don't look to the type and say
[25:41] well you know what in the body we get
[25:43] rid of the appendix or
[25:45] you know we can amputate limbs and we
[25:47] can we can change
[25:48] that's not that's like you're going
[25:50] beyond the type
[25:52] the type is as god has fitly joined
[25:54] together the natural body
[25:55] and each part has a utility and
[25:57] ministers nourishment we're only using
[25:59] that as a type for the truth that's
[26:01] unchanging
[26:03] that we work and function within the
[26:05] body of christ
[26:06] in harmony in every part has a place
[26:09] even the uncomely parts
[26:10] are are honored and revered right
[26:14] and so that's what we lift up that's
[26:15] what we look to so there's something
[26:17] supernatural about this position that
[26:19] we've been given
[26:20] in the body of christ now in the message
[26:22] who is this melchizedek brother adam's
[26:24] quoting from john 1 1 he says
[26:26] in the beginning was the word now let me
[26:28] just
[26:29] reset again that when god made the woman
[26:32] she was going to
[26:33] be part of establishing a family a child
[26:37] comes from that same expression and
[26:38] those same phrasing
[26:40] in those words that he is now a carrying
[26:42] on of the family man woman children this
[26:45] is an expression of god
[26:46] and it's a dwelling place it's
[26:48] expressing a dwelling place of god what
[26:50] house will you
[26:51] build me so god is wanting to ultimately
[26:54] become a family that he dwells
[26:56] in or becomes that he's identified with
[26:59] and brother branham says using john 1 1
[27:01] in the beginning was the word and the
[27:03] word was with god and the word
[27:04] was god now he skips several verses and
[27:06] he says and the word became flesh and
[27:08] dwelt among us by the way i'm connecting
[27:10] now
[27:10] john 1 1 with i believe verse 12.
[27:14] and he says hold that there now notice
[27:16] his first being with spirit
[27:18] god supernatural all right the great
[27:21] eternal
[27:22] second he begin to form himself towards
[27:26] flesh
[27:26] in a theophany it's called the word a
[27:29] body
[27:30] so god in the beginning is invisible
[27:32] then he forms himself into a theophany
[27:34] and notice the phrase that brother
[27:36] branham uses
[27:37] he's forming himself toward flesh he's
[27:40] not flesh then
[27:41] when he's formed into the theophany it's
[27:43] a body it's the word the logos in the
[27:45] beginning was the word
[27:46] that's god now forming himself and still
[27:48] a supernatural
[27:50] expression of the invisible god but god
[27:52] is moving towards
[27:54] flesh in other words that created a
[27:56] momentum that god is saying
[27:58] i want to take on flesh and if you want
[28:00] to know what i'm talking about
[28:02] just see it now in a type in adam and
[28:04] the woman
[28:06] and then he becomes flesh in jesus
[28:08] christ so in hebrews chapter 10 verse 5
[28:10] wherefore when he cometh into the world
[28:12] he saith sacrifice and offering that
[28:14] what is not
[28:14] but a body thou hast prepared me
[28:17] what is this body it's the flesh that
[28:19] god began to form himself towards
[28:22] in john 1 and in the beginning so
[28:24] brother man says god
[28:25] prepared himself a body in the form of
[28:27] the lord jesus
[28:29] and colossians tells us for in him
[28:31] dwelleth all the fullness of the godhead
[28:34] bodily
[28:34] so now we see something coming forth
[28:36] this is the dwelling place of god
[28:39] this is the beginning of the creation of
[28:41] god this is now god bringing into
[28:42] perfect realization
[28:44] what he was reflecting and manifesting
[28:46] in the garden of eden
[28:48] and so if this is the masterpiece jesus
[28:51] christ and in him dwells the fullness
[28:53] then we know in the original image and
[28:55] in the type
[28:56] in this this expression in the garden
[28:58] there's must come forth
[29:00] there must be a bana there must be a
[29:02] building and an establishing of the
[29:03] family
[29:04] here's the sun now there must come forth
[29:06] a woman and paul picks up on the
[29:08] revelation ephesians 1
[29:09] 22-23 and it says and have put all
[29:12] things under his feet speaking of christ
[29:16] and gave him to be the head over all
[29:18] things
[29:19] to the church so christ is the head
[29:22] and he's placed all things under his
[29:24] feet now listen how
[29:26] paul defines the church what is the
[29:28] church which is his body
[29:30] so the church is the body christ is the
[29:33] head the fullness of him
[29:35] that filleth all in all
[29:38] so when christ dwelled all the fullness
[29:40] of the godhead bodily now there comes
[29:42] forth a body a
[29:43] church which is his body which is going
[29:46] to be the fullness of him that filleth
[29:48] all in all
[29:49] there's the replenishing of the earth
[29:52] there's the feeling up in the full
[29:54] expression the supreme
[29:56] fulfillment of what god was envisioning
[29:57] in the beginning so there's a spiritual
[29:59] part that we're all playing in this
[30:01] expression of
[30:02] the masterpiece family because brother
[30:04] ram says and now the masterpiece family
[30:06] has come again
[30:07] christ and his bride ready to come he
[30:09] calls it the second adam
[30:11] the second eve ready now to return back
[30:13] to their home
[30:14] and the whole picture has been
[30:15] redemption
[30:17] because the bible begins with the broken
[30:19] family
[30:20] you talk about family conflict i mean
[30:23] genesis chapter four is pretty heavy
[30:26] hey i mean genesis chapter three a
[30:28] husband and wife arguing and
[30:30] and disagreeing and husband blaming the
[30:32] wife and
[30:33] right i mean you don't have to go beyond
[30:36] genesis 3 and genesis 4
[30:37] maybe in some ways to be comforted about
[30:39] your situation
[30:41] and so the family the family picture in
[30:43] the beginning wasn't very pretty
[30:45] it was for a moment but what began to
[30:47] unfold was very difficult but it says
[30:49] but the whole picture has been
[30:50] redemption
[30:52] but god wanted to express in the
[30:54] beginning god created the heaven and
[30:55] earth and what the earth was chaotic
[30:58] that's the first expression but the
[31:00] whole picture has been redemption
[31:03] so now we want to take this a step
[31:04] further i think those things could just
[31:06] perhaps may have been uh better suited
[31:09] for the last time
[31:11] but it helps just to build a foundation
[31:13] brother says in the beginning was the
[31:15] word
[31:16] and now he brings forth this expression
[31:18] of the masterpiece family
[31:20] and how that christ god was moving
[31:22] himself towards flesh
[31:23] so in the beginning was the word then
[31:26] god
[31:27] created a family so the
[31:30] first family was after the word
[31:34] it wasn't in the beginning was a family
[31:36] and then god created the word you say
[31:38] well brother aaron
[31:39] if i came to church this morning to
[31:40] figure you know to hear that i didn't
[31:42] have to come to church i'm just wanting
[31:44] to think about it
[31:45] the word was first and then after the
[31:48] word
[31:48] the family came and then the family was
[31:51] then made
[31:52] subject to the word so brother branham
[31:55] says in the masterpiece the masterpiece
[31:57] was wall speaking of the family
[31:59] walled by the word god's word and he
[32:02] uses the phrase
[32:03] fortified by the word so the family was
[32:06] fortified made strong or secured by the
[32:09] word
[32:09] fortified me was given strength by the
[32:12] word
[32:13] so if you're fortified by something the
[32:15] word was the source of power
[32:16] the word was the source of protection
[32:18] the family was fortified by the word
[32:21] he uses the phrase a few places they
[32:22] were walled by the word and how
[32:24] they went beyond the wall and that's
[32:26] what caused the fall wall
[32:28] it speaks of boundaries parameters
[32:30] foundation
[32:31] so there's something that defined the
[32:33] family family couldn't just be any kind
[32:35] of relationship family couldn't just be
[32:37] a any designation that you wanted to
[32:40] give it god had a very specific
[32:41] expression of the family
[32:43] now we could even acknowledge that today
[32:46] the
[32:46] the nominal christians and and
[32:48] denominations and certain even political
[32:50] organizations would say a family is
[32:51] defined as a man and a woman
[32:54] right and and so they're trying to go
[32:56] back to the biblical perspective that
[32:57] god sets forth now we can say that
[32:59] god in the beginning walled god's
[33:02] masterpiece so he's putting a frame
[33:04] around it
[33:04] and saying this is the word and this is
[33:07] what makes a family
[33:08] this is a true family this is a
[33:09] masterpiece family
[33:11] he says an identified masterpiece of god
[33:14] and god told adam what he could do and
[33:16] what he could not do
[33:18] he placed himself he placed him behind
[33:21] his word
[33:22] and he begins to describe how the enemy
[33:24] crawled through the walls of god's word
[33:27] and that's how he marred the image and
[33:29] he says that's one of the saddest
[33:30] stories to think that the man was made
[33:32] in the image of his creator
[33:33] and was given a wall to stand behind and
[33:36] that that word
[33:37] could never fail so where
[33:40] in the beginning was the word and then
[33:42] when god made the family
[33:43] he was framing them by the word the word
[33:46] was the context
[33:48] the word was the parameters the word was
[33:50] what brought it into view the word is
[33:51] what made
[33:52] sense of what the family was without the
[33:54] word you wouldn't understand what it was
[33:57] so he says this and take on the whole
[33:58] armor of god the enemy knew as long as
[34:00] the human race stayed with that word
[34:02] he'd never be able to touch them this is
[34:05] this is very instructive
[34:07] as long as the human race stayed with
[34:08] the word god fortified his family on the
[34:11] earth
[34:12] his army in the fortification of his
[34:15] word
[34:15] that the fort of his word that is our
[34:18] fortress
[34:20] so he uses maybe a a military analogy to
[34:23] say that god has built us a base
[34:24] he's built us a fortification he's built
[34:27] us a fort we we are
[34:28] we are not in in fort st john we're not
[34:31] in fort worth we're in fort worth
[34:33] right that's where god has established
[34:35] us that's where he's built he's built up
[34:36] the walls this isn't for
[34:38] brave for those of you who use playmobil
[34:40] he's established us
[34:41] in the word we have a word as our
[34:44] fortress and as long as you're
[34:46] in there you're good as long as you're
[34:49] in there he won't be able to touch you
[34:50] as long as he's in there you won't be
[34:51] marred as long as you're there you can't
[34:52] be tore down
[34:53] and so satan recognizes this now this is
[34:56] brother branham showing this to me i
[34:58] framed him
[34:59] by the word i put him behind the word
[35:00] the fortification was the word
[35:03] now he says this later in identified
[35:04] masterpiece of god
[35:06] this is brother bam trying to show the
[35:07] evolution of of this
[35:09] and when he made his first masterpiece
[35:12] he put him
[35:13] behind the word when he made a second
[35:16] masterpiece
[35:17] he was the word amen i'm getting a
[35:20] little bit more encouraged today
[35:22] i'm starting to feel like you know what
[35:24] this this flesh has a chance
[35:26] because he put the first masterpiece
[35:28] which was in flesh
[35:29] behind the word which meant he could get
[35:32] outside the word
[35:33] he was walled by the word which means
[35:34] there's something the enemy could crawl
[35:36] under or get around
[35:37] but now he makes you the word so it says
[35:40] he was the word not
[35:42] behind the word he was the word god
[35:44] never changes his plan
[35:45] that's exactly what he started off to do
[35:48] his first
[35:49] church with the word in other words if
[35:52] christ
[35:52] the second adam the last adam was not
[35:55] behind the word but
[35:56] the word and the woman is to come off of
[35:59] him then you are the same material as
[36:02] the bridegroom
[36:03] you're not merely behind the word you
[36:05] are the word
[36:08] this has been expressed through several
[36:09] other services expressed by
[36:11] you know it's been preached by the the
[36:13] men of god for decades that
[36:15] you are the word the bride is the word
[36:17] now there's got to be an individual
[36:19] connection to this
[36:20] that there is something that god is
[36:22] doing now through the
[36:23] through the word of god to where i'm not
[36:25] afraid of leaving
[36:27] the word of god and going out from
[36:29] behind the word of god and satan married
[36:31] my life permanently in god having to
[36:33] start a cycle of redemption all over
[36:35] again
[36:35] but i have been ordained to declare and
[36:38] to manifest the word of god
[36:39] i'm not merely behind the word of god so
[36:42] i can step out of the word of god but i
[36:44] am now becoming the word
[36:47] this is the pattern and what did god
[36:51] show
[36:51] adam and the woman were placed behind
[36:54] the word
[36:56] and israel was placed behind the word
[37:00] and so they always related naturally to
[37:01] the promise they had to come once a year
[37:03] and identify with the sacrifice and so
[37:05] this was a pattern they were behind the
[37:06] word they were behind the word but they
[37:08] had not become the word
[37:10] it was only through the seed of abraham
[37:12] which speaks of christ
[37:13] that you could become the word so just
[37:16] as israel was behind the word and adam
[37:17] and the woman were behind the word
[37:19] through the second adam we can become
[37:21] the word and the bride
[37:22] is the word amen
[37:28] now in these very this very
[37:31] energizing and exciting and thrilling
[37:33] principle
[37:34] that feeds us as bride members that
[37:36] identifies as the bride members god is
[37:38] setting forth
[37:41] maybe the most important pattern for
[37:43] individuals and families
[37:46] he's setting forth a a clear and
[37:48] distinct
[37:49] pattern for us even as this word has
[37:52] practical application in our lives
[37:54] you say i'm the word i'm the word well
[37:55] what does that look like
[37:57] right what what is what does the word
[37:59] look like
[38:00] it's to be like christ okay be born of a
[38:03] virgin
[38:05] you know right and uh confound the fairs
[38:07] the the priest
[38:08] at 12. what is it what does it look like
[38:12] what does it look like from 12 to 30 the
[38:15] silent years of christ
[38:17] so it's brother i said the life lived by
[38:20] the word would be the word expressed
[38:22] so it's it's it's what it looks like in
[38:24] life
[38:25] something that has to be expressed and
[38:27] relationships and obligations and
[38:29] responsibilities and duties
[38:30] provide the context for us to be
[38:32] christ-like for
[38:34] an opportunity to do do the right thing
[38:37] and i want so i want to use this phrase
[38:38] brother brown called brother uh said of
[38:40] god he is the extreme parent
[38:44] you think you're a helicopter parent or
[38:47] you know i'm all in on motherhood or you
[38:48] know i'm a real dad
[38:50] uh don't ever say i babysit my kids
[38:52] those are my kids i
[38:53] you know i i father them just like mom
[38:56] mothers them
[38:57] and uh and we have all those kind of
[38:59] phrases that we use
[39:01] and uh and our objections if the wife
[39:03] says well he's at home babysitting the
[39:05] kids i don't babysit my kids
[39:07] that's my flesh and blood you know
[39:09] you're not paying me 20 bucks an hour to
[39:11] watch somebody else's kids but so but
[39:13] god is the extreme parent
[39:15] so in the true in the purest sense as
[39:18] jesus said if your
[39:19] natural father if you asked your natural
[39:21] father for an egg would he give you a
[39:22] rock
[39:23] in the purest sense god is an extreme
[39:26] parent he said brother brown said that
[39:29] parenthood
[39:30] originated in god because he was the
[39:33] first parent
[39:35] he says in another place he is the
[39:37] source
[39:38] he is the source of all parenthood
[39:42] so this is these are just some phrases
[39:44] now to ponder about god
[39:45] parenthood originated god he's the first
[39:47] parent he's the source of parenting and
[39:49] brotherhood says one place fatherhood is
[39:51] an attribute of god
[39:52] now right there we can begin to come we
[39:55] could begin to identify
[39:56] something that when when man when adam
[39:59] became
[40:00] from adam to each you say well that was
[40:03] a transition
[40:04] because his relationship changed and and
[40:07] that we can understand that naturally
[40:09] but then if you could realize that in
[40:10] doing so he was actually stepping into
[40:12] an office that god held himself
[40:15] or that was a characteristic of god then
[40:17] it kind of changes
[40:18] what it's ex the promise behind it
[40:22] or the potential of it so being a parent
[40:26] is not just the ability to bring forth a
[40:30] child
[40:30] but it actually brings you into an
[40:32] office which is god-like
[40:34] or god himself holds so you can say god
[40:36] as
[40:37] a parent i want the the power
[40:40] and the wisdom and the strength and the
[40:42] ability that you possess
[40:44] as a father and as one that is extreme
[40:47] the extreme parent
[40:48] your office as a husband is connected
[40:51] with god's
[40:52] office as a husband your office as a
[40:54] wife as a spouse is connected with this
[40:56] office that god is
[40:57] as a spouse your office as a parent is
[40:59] connected with god's calling
[41:01] and his characteristics and his
[41:02] attributes as a parent
[41:05] now and and i want to express this
[41:07] because we're continuing on
[41:09] how we're wanting to convey it in the
[41:11] sense that god
[41:12] being the extreme parent is establishing
[41:15] a pattern
[41:16] and in the beginning was the word and
[41:18] then the family came next so god is
[41:20] demonstrating something extremely
[41:21] important
[41:23] and this is a principle that we not only
[41:25] catch and acknowledge but we live by it
[41:29] and i let me express this i'd love to
[41:31] amplify this statement further
[41:33] brother branham says your family is what
[41:35] you are
[41:36] and we all go
[41:40] no i'm not the one that got kicked out
[41:42] of louisiana youth camp
[41:44] right immediately the name geary just
[41:47] everyone just assumes so were you a
[41:49] white wizard too
[41:51] did your dad give you all duckies when
[41:53] you were little yeah there's something
[41:54] about the name right and the testimonies
[41:56] and the
[41:57] uh and the things and behaviors and the
[41:59] stories and all those you're identified
[42:01] by your name so he realized yes
[42:02] this is a statement your your family is
[42:05] what you are
[42:06] and brother i'm talking about in natural
[42:07] life we're identified in our marriages
[42:11] and don't go it's just true it's just
[42:14] the realitive
[42:15] in the natural not even talking about
[42:17] christians not even talking about
[42:19] believers and those things but in the
[42:20] natural we are identified in our
[42:22] marriage
[42:23] we're known by our family by our family
[42:25] name the certain attributes and
[42:26] behaviors and history of the family
[42:28] we derive our character even from our
[42:30] family influence
[42:32] so when you are born into a family you
[42:34] receive the
[42:35] nature of your parents and then as you
[42:38] are raised in a family you receive
[42:40] the nurture of your parents and your
[42:42] extended family and even your
[42:43] environment the neighborhood your social
[42:45] climate these all become nurturing
[42:47] influences
[42:47] on the nature it produces a particular
[42:50] expression so it says your family is
[42:51] what you are brother brahms identify
[42:53] that family dynamics make a person what
[42:56] they are
[42:57] and it's an operation of nature and
[42:58] nurture and so that's the reality
[43:00] we get that we understand that but
[43:02] instead of just locking up
[43:04] and freezing saying well that's the
[43:05] truth i'm in a box realize this
[43:07] that is what you are in the natural so
[43:10] your family is what you are in the
[43:11] natural
[43:12] then and you're identified by nature and
[43:14] nurturing all those things then think
[43:15] about the greater promise
[43:17] that you're part of the family of god
[43:19] and so therefore the word is what you
[43:21] are spiritually and if i could put it
[43:22] this way
[43:23] the word is what you are really
[43:27] it's really what you are and so you're
[43:29] identified by your union with the word
[43:32] you're identified you're known
[43:33] by your family which is the word you
[43:35] derive your character from this heavenly
[43:37] family
[43:38] from the word of god from the influence
[43:40] of the word so now you are
[43:41] under a divine promise to live a
[43:44] different expression that is breaking
[43:46] and transcending
[43:47] whatever family history it is i think
[43:51] about brother tom ray's testimony
[43:53] when he had he had family members died
[43:55] of a very young age
[43:56] and i believe it was because perhaps
[43:57] heart disease or some other ailment
[43:59] and he went into the doctor and they're
[44:00] very concerned about family history and
[44:02] his brother
[44:03] passed away his father passed away he
[44:04] went in to see the doctor and the doctor
[44:06] was doing some tests and he says
[44:08] you got a different dna and you know
[44:10] brother tom glory
[44:12] right immediately he's like you got that
[44:13] right buddy i
[44:15] i don't don't place on me my family
[44:18] history don't place
[44:19] on me uh family hang-ups and family
[44:21] complexes and family cycles
[44:23] yes those things are there but i believe
[44:25] the word of god is sent
[44:27] to deal with those it's all about
[44:29] redemption it's all about new beginnings
[44:31] let's just say right now and purpose in
[44:33] our hearts i can't change the past
[44:35] but the future can change me
[44:38] i can't change the past but what i'm
[44:40] called to can change the present
[44:43] what god has called me to be can change
[44:45] who i am now
[44:47] and do nothing about the past and listen
[44:50] today
[44:51] then is the day we're living in the
[44:52] harvest time
[44:54] the seed comes through we're living in a
[44:55] time when there's a union of the natural
[44:57] with the spiritual
[44:59] so then there is there's an expression
[45:01] then
[45:03] of what you are naturally harmonizing
[45:06] with what you are spiritually
[45:08] that we can purpose in our hearts as we
[45:10] have opportunity today
[45:12] that i can let the word have preeminence
[45:14] in my life
[45:15] so that there's not such a dichotomy and
[45:17] a separation of what i am naturally
[45:19] in my relationships in my family in my
[45:21] individual life
[45:22] and what the word of god has called me
[45:24] to be but now the natural
[45:26] flesh is becoming word and it's union
[45:28] time
[45:29] it's time to unite what we are naturally
[45:32] and your family is what you are
[45:34] in what we are spiritually in your
[45:36] families what you are so that even as
[45:37] families as single people as
[45:39] grandparents
[45:41] as aunts and uncles and as members of a
[45:43] church we find our identity
[45:45] in our expression through the word of
[45:47] god that they unite together
[45:50] it's all about letting christ have
[45:51] preeminence
[45:53] now i i'm uh
[45:57] you guys are dragging me all over the
[45:58] place
[46:00] so in the message conflict between god
[46:02] and satan and coming back to
[46:04] this this quote that was up there a
[46:06] moment ago
[46:07] now i i want to try to go quickly
[46:10] through this because god
[46:12] god is setting forth something that's
[46:14] very instructive to us
[46:15] very practical um it's something that we
[46:19] uh we really need to grab a hold of
[46:21] what's being uh expressed here
[46:23] and we'll revisit it perhaps in the
[46:25] future in eden god knew his enemy and
[46:27] all the attacks of his enemy
[46:28] so based upon that brother adam says
[46:31] after
[46:31] a couple statements and knew that he
[46:33] would have children on this earth his
[46:35] own blessed children
[46:37] don't you believe that god that he would
[46:39] provide for them the best that he could
[46:41] provide
[46:43] now put yourself in the position as a
[46:45] parent
[46:47] and realize as a parent i want to
[46:48] provide what's best for my children
[46:51] and by that it means i don't want to
[46:54] just buy them some kind of knock
[46:56] off handheld video game i want to get
[46:58] the
[46:59] the switch right i don't want to buy
[47:03] a used sega genesis at a garage sale i
[47:06] want to get the ps5
[47:08] and that's how we begin to think i want
[47:10] to get them the best
[47:11] i want i want to provide the best but
[47:13] because this is an instinct of
[47:14] parenthood
[47:15] he would provide for them the best would
[47:17] he not do it
[47:18] he says knowing the enemy knowing the
[47:20] challenges knowing what's coming
[47:21] would not you tonight to your children
[47:23] that was helpless little fellows who
[47:25] can't take care of themselves
[47:26] don't you struggle and work and do
[47:28] everything that you can to provide the
[47:29] best you can or able to provide for
[47:31] those children
[47:32] amen that's what motivates the mothers
[47:34] in the morning to get out of bed that's
[47:35] what motivates the fathers to go to work
[47:37] because you are a father a parent and if
[47:39] that be what i say
[47:40] the trueness and the thought of an
[47:42] earthly parent
[47:43] and parenthood originated to god because
[47:45] he was the first parent
[47:46] don't you think that god seeing what
[47:48] satan would be what satan would do
[47:50] he gave to his children and provided for
[47:52] them the best thing they could be
[47:54] provided for them
[47:55] knowing what the enemy's attack would be
[47:57] god fortified his children
[47:59] just skipping just a little bit god knew
[48:01] this great warfare was coming
[48:04] between right and wrong and he knew what
[48:06] the enemy was going to do he know just
[48:07] exactly how to equip his people
[48:10] this instinct to equip this instinct to
[48:13] um
[48:13] to fortify was based upon god knowing
[48:16] there was challenges ahead
[48:18] and let me rephrase it god as a father
[48:20] as a parent
[48:22] being able to discern and recognize
[48:24] there's troubles coming ahead
[48:25] and being proactive as a parent and
[48:28] providing proactively
[48:30] fortification resources tools rules
[48:33] things that he could give his children
[48:35] to live by that would protect them and
[48:37] guide them
[48:38] in the onslaught to come that even they
[48:41] the children couldn't foresee the
[48:42] children have no idea they're not even
[48:44] they're not even in a particular
[48:46] expression yet to be able to relate to
[48:47] these challenges
[48:48] but god knowing what was coming this is
[48:50] the instinct of parenthood this is an
[48:51] instinct of a father
[48:52] knowing what was coming he gave him the
[48:54] best and what did he fortify him with
[48:56] the word paragraph 60 but god
[49:00] at the beginning gave his children the
[49:02] atomic weapon that
[49:03] doesn't seem to be too wise maybe to
[49:05] give your children an atomic bomb
[49:08] because he's the infinite god now sin
[49:10] there is going to be a conflict and
[49:12] there's going to be a battle
[49:13] we're remembering this phrase from last
[49:15] year god equipped his children with the
[49:17] right kind of an
[49:17] ammunition right kind of attack right
[49:20] kind of everything
[49:21] defense offense protection whatever it
[49:23] is that they had need of
[49:25] that would sweep them all the way from
[49:27] eden
[49:28] and god knowing there would be a fall to
[49:31] the rapture
[49:33] the word that god gave adam and the
[49:35] woman in the beginning
[49:36] actually was a word that anticipated and
[49:40] prophesied
[49:41] of a fallen people on earth who would
[49:43] one day before death ever had existence
[49:46] god had prophesied its defeat before it
[49:49] ever been
[49:50] manifested god prophesied as defeat that
[49:52] this word i give in the beginning
[49:54] the bride is going to manifest in the
[49:56] end and take it into a rapture
[49:58] he says what was it the word that's what
[50:00] defeat satan is the word it'll defeat
[50:02] him anywhere
[50:03] any place so this is instructive to us
[50:06] just take this in in the brief moment
[50:08] that will amplify that we then
[50:10] do the same thing as parents if god
[50:13] being the extreme parent god being the
[50:15] first parent god being
[50:16] fatherhood being an attribute of god
[50:18] then this principle is true
[50:20] that we likewise want the word to be
[50:24] something we fortify
[50:25] our families with literally in our
[50:28] families literally
[50:29] in our raising literally in the
[50:30] standards that we have in the home we
[50:32] look to the word of god to be a
[50:33] fortification
[50:35] that doesn't mean you go out and try to
[50:36] find word lumber and
[50:38] word stucco and word carpet and word
[50:41] no those are the building elements of a
[50:43] natural house
[50:44] but the things that make a house a home
[50:46] we look to the word to do that
[50:50] and it's a very scriptural principle so
[50:52] now i want to take this
[50:54] uh that may have just been a little bit
[50:56] of a veering but i want to emphasize
[50:57] this
[50:58] in a little bit different ways as we've
[51:00] kind of hit our home stretch rounding
[51:02] second headed to third
[51:03] and this is going to be an inside the
[51:04] park home run so we're going to make it
[51:06] we're going gonna get we're gonna get to
[51:07] home
[51:10] i don't know if i'll get in standing up
[51:11] if i'm gonna have to slide
[51:13] you'll determine that okay as one
[51:16] brother would said you just let me know
[51:18] when i'm done
[51:20] and it's almost like a dad joke i don't
[51:21] know how many pastors when i was
[51:23] traveling and evangelizing
[51:25] and uh would say but aaron you just
[51:27] preach as long as you want
[51:29] we're going to leave in an hour you just
[51:30] turn off the lights when you're done oh
[51:32] it's like a dad joke it's like a pastor
[51:34] joke right
[51:36] and you just kind of cringe dad
[51:41] and so the principle that we're wanting
[51:42] to express here
[51:45] and just look at is god as the extreme
[51:47] parent
[51:48] arranged his family behind the word
[51:51] that's an example we see but we realize
[51:52] in a spiritual sense we are the word so
[51:55] in
[51:56] in using types of the natural family the
[51:59] natural marriages say the natural
[52:00] marriage is a type of the union between
[52:02] christ and his bride
[52:03] but that doesn't mean all the all the
[52:05] problems we have in our natural
[52:07] marriages
[52:08] that we have in our spiritual marriage
[52:10] right because christ is at least the
[52:12] perfect husband
[52:14] and our marriage is lacking perfect
[52:16] husbands
[52:17] to have different problems than what
[52:20] christ
[52:21] and the bride have and so we're not
[52:23] trying to bring these types
[52:25] and work on making backwards compatible
[52:27] to force our marriages into a particular
[52:28] image and if they're not that then
[52:29] they're not the right one
[52:30] it's not that's not how we're looking at
[52:32] it so brother branham
[52:34] tells us the first family was arranged
[52:35] behind the word now we realize the
[52:37] spiritual type is greater
[52:38] but then they're ordered according to
[52:40] the word and we mentioned a moment ago
[52:42] this is the part i just want to
[52:43] emphasize over and over again for the
[52:44] next several moments
[52:46] i hope several is ambiguous enough for
[52:48] you just to stay with me
[52:49] the word was first the word was first
[52:53] the word was their protection it was
[52:54] their preservation in other words the
[52:56] word was going to protect them and if
[52:57] they followed the word it would actually
[52:59] preserve them
[53:00] and populate them or recreate them this
[53:02] is god's original program the true
[53:04] the true family in the beginning could
[53:06] not be replicated
[53:07] unless it was by the word so when adam
[53:10] and the woman produced offspring it
[53:12] wasn't the word producing offspring
[53:14] the image of the true family had already
[53:15] been broken so the word was their
[53:17] protection and also the word was their
[53:19] provision
[53:19] and it was their preservation and this
[53:22] is the lesson i want to emphasize in
[53:24] this this is what we're going to gather
[53:25] from this what are we
[53:26] what are we trying to learn from this
[53:27] particular uh phrasing that you're using
[53:29] brother aaron what are we trying to
[53:30] learn
[53:31] from this emphasis that you're giving
[53:33] the lesson is this family
[53:34] is not first
[53:39] family cannot be you cannot ever take
[53:42] family the principle of family
[53:44] the the idea family and raise it above
[53:46] the word
[53:49] so as much as we say in the beginning
[53:51] god created a family
[53:52] we can't take from that meaning that
[53:54] family is the ultimate and family is the
[53:56] most important family is what must be
[53:58] first
[53:58] and then we what happens we merely
[54:00] become identified by family
[54:02] we merely begin to see ourselves in
[54:04] terms of how our family dynamics are we
[54:05] say well you're identified by your
[54:07] marriage and this natural life then
[54:08] however my marriage is is who i am and
[54:10] we get it in this way to where that
[54:11] becomes the identifying factor
[54:13] that becomes the frame that becomes the
[54:16] image that becomes everything we are as
[54:17] family
[54:18] but that's not how god arranged it in
[54:19] the beginning the word was first
[54:22] so that means family doesn't have the
[54:24] preeminence family relationships do not
[54:26] have the preeminence
[54:28] but the word does family is not first so
[54:32] it's not like god gives us the word like
[54:33] thank you for the word and as i began to
[54:35] learn and understand the word
[54:37] i realized that family was more
[54:38] important so you take the word and go
[54:40] thank you lord and then and then join
[54:43] your family is i'm just working on my
[54:45] family and we're just
[54:46] throwing myself into my family and
[54:47] spending more time with my family
[54:49] brother aaron i'm just going to quit
[54:50] church for a year
[54:51] and i've been distracted by my prayer
[54:53] life and i find i'm just reading too
[54:54] much in the bible and i just really want
[54:56] to focus on my family
[54:57] all that time in prayer i'm going to
[54:59] spend it doing legos with my son
[55:01] and i'm actually going to i bought a
[55:02] bass boat and i'm going to take my other
[55:04] son out fishing every afternoon
[55:05] just gonna pour myself into my family
[55:07] give more time to my family
[55:09] and because we think well family is the
[55:11] ultimate so if i can somehow build the
[55:13] family
[55:14] right you don't need anybody to tell you
[55:18] i don't know brother you might want to
[55:19] rethink that we know that's not the
[55:21] image
[55:22] and that's why even the phrase and this
[55:24] is not to this is not a knock on
[55:26] adventures in odyssey
[55:29] but the phrase focus on the family can
[55:32] be somewhat misleading
[55:35] if unless it's qualified and i'm not
[55:36] suggesting that they are they they have
[55:38] been misled themselves in terms of
[55:40] what they mean behind the phrase focus
[55:42] on the family i haven't asked is it dr
[55:44] dawson
[55:45] maybe i'll just send them a dm later and
[55:48] ask what the
[55:49] motivation was to this
[55:52] but with unless you qualify focus on the
[55:54] family can be misleading and say
[55:56] we need to focus on the family and focus
[55:58] could mean we're going to converge on it
[55:59] we're going to make it the center
[56:01] to focus on something is you make it
[56:02] central you make it the center and if
[56:04] you make family the center if you make
[56:06] family the focus then you're wrong
[56:08] but if you look at it from the
[56:10] standpoint that focus is using the lens
[56:12] of god's word to produce a clear image
[56:13] of the family
[56:14] than to focus on the family's right i'm
[56:16] using the word lens i'm using the word
[56:18] of god to frame it i'm using the word of
[56:20] god to give it context
[56:21] and my focus on the family is through
[56:23] the word of god to get a clear
[56:24] image of what family is what my
[56:25] responsibilities are what the role is
[56:27] what the utility what it should look
[56:28] like then that's fine
[56:30] but if you focus on the family at the at
[56:32] the expense of the word of god where i'm
[56:34] kind of turning away from the word to
[56:36] focus on the family
[56:37] that's a dangerous place to be because
[56:39] the family is not the ultimate but if
[56:40] you take the word of god and use the
[56:42] word as a lens
[56:43] to bring the family into perspective and
[56:45] have a clear understanding of what your
[56:46] roles and responsibilities are
[56:47] as a son or daughter in the home that's
[56:49] good amen
[56:52] so then what we're wanting this is this
[56:54] is
[56:55] how i want you to take a hold of this
[56:57] today is so when we say in the beginning
[56:59] god created a family if we
[57:01] if we're suggesting that we might spend
[57:02] some time teaching on family roles and
[57:04] our responsibilities as husbands and
[57:06] wives and parents
[57:07] and those things it's not just a family
[57:10] that was the image of god
[57:13] but brother called it a true family that
[57:15] was the masterpiece
[57:17] so it had to be arranged under the word
[57:19] the first family had a very specific
[57:21] arrangement had a very specific order
[57:23] which made it god's masterpiece wasn't
[57:25] just relationship
[57:27] wasn't just title but it was the
[57:29] arrangement of it
[57:31] now let's ponder these scriptures
[57:34] as we go forward in this matthew chapter
[57:37] 19 verse 29.
[57:40] and and i want to read these
[57:44] and and in a way it really hits hard
[57:47] and every one that has forsaken houses
[57:49] which that houses means family it's a
[57:51] word used for family
[57:52] so it's not just you know moving from
[57:54] one
[57:55] address to another everyone who has
[57:56] forsaken houses or brethren
[57:59] or sisters or father or mother or wife
[58:02] or children or lands
[58:03] for my name's sake shall receive a
[58:06] hundred fold and shall inherit
[58:07] everlasting
[58:08] life jesus is again once again being
[58:11] very particular and specific he doesn't
[58:12] just say
[58:13] everyone that has left things that are
[58:14] important and dear to them is going to
[58:16] be rewarded a hundredfold
[58:17] he kind of really gets down to where it
[58:19] hurts a little bit that if for his
[58:21] namesake for the word's sake
[58:24] if we forsake family our brother our
[58:27] sister our father our mother our wife
[58:29] for children
[58:30] there's going to be a reward of an of
[58:33] eternal life i mean this is he's put in
[58:35] very extreme ways almost in a sense you
[58:36] think are you exaggerating jesus
[58:38] but it's the truth and so the opposite
[58:42] stands we cannot forsake him for family
[58:44] sake
[58:46] he's telling us it's okay for the word's
[58:48] sake
[58:49] to forsake family it's okay for the
[58:52] word's sake
[58:53] to to follow truth and not let this
[58:55] family
[58:56] uh family identity and family politics
[58:58] and family ambitions and family goals
[59:00] keep you from following me because
[59:02] listen if you do so just know i am
[59:04] rewarder and i will restore and i will
[59:05] give back a hundredfold says one place
[59:07] in this life and the life to come
[59:09] so i think if i would just i would just
[59:11] say this if you've ever had to leave
[59:13] family to stand for truth don't close
[59:16] the door
[59:20] leave just as abraham did that day when
[59:22] he took his son up the hill to sacrifice
[59:24] him he said
[59:24] i and the lad are going up and by his
[59:27] own language he implied
[59:28] and we're coming right back down you
[59:30] just
[59:31] you keep that door open of restoration
[59:33] and though i may have to separate for
[59:35] some cause
[59:35] i'm not going to give up like abraham
[59:37] did on lot oh well i guess the world
[59:38] took them
[59:39] there they go the kings took them but no
[59:41] no let's gather our resources let's
[59:43] gather our servants
[59:44] let's pray let's send the holy ghost
[59:45] after him let's bring him back say i
[59:47] guess he just
[59:48] you know it wasn't of us that's not the
[59:50] right kind of attitude
[59:52] but yet jesus is saying this that we
[59:53] cannot forsake him for family sake
[59:56] in other words as i'm maybe taking what
[59:59] he's presenting here
[1:00:00] forsake houses brothers sister father
[1:00:02] mother wife or children for his sake
[1:00:04] we cannot deny the word of god for
[1:00:06] family sake we cannot compromise the
[1:00:07] word of god
[1:00:08] for family jesus
[1:00:12] is establishing an order here that the
[1:00:14] word is greater than the family
[1:00:18] family is not greater than the word but
[1:00:21] ponder this
[1:00:22] but when family reflects the word
[1:00:24] there's nothing greater
[1:00:27] so we're not kind of creating this box
[1:00:29] that you got to put family into but we
[1:00:30] have this
[1:00:31] ambition to say family's not greater
[1:00:33] than the word but if
[1:00:34] i can express the word there's nothing
[1:00:36] greater
[1:00:39] in matthew chapter 10 verses 34 to 35 i
[1:00:42] might actually
[1:00:43] i have mis represented there i might
[1:00:46] read to verse 37
[1:00:49] a lot of this i type it by hand and so
[1:00:50] sometimes it may not actually be correct
[1:00:52] on there i have typos and different
[1:00:53] things
[1:00:54] i'm just trying to do it all it says
[1:00:56] think not that i'm come to send peace on
[1:00:58] earth
[1:00:59] i came not to send peace and we're
[1:01:01] thinking well isn't that what the angel
[1:01:02] said when you were born
[1:01:04] but a sword think not that i am come to
[1:01:08] send peace on earth i came not to send
[1:01:09] peace but a sword
[1:01:10] for i am come to set a man at variance
[1:01:13] which means to cleveland departs to
[1:01:14] separate
[1:01:16] to set man at variance against his
[1:01:18] father and and the daughter against her
[1:01:20] mother and the daughter-in-law against
[1:01:21] her mother-in-law he never says the
[1:01:23] son-in-law gets the mother-in-law except
[1:01:25] but that's the one we always joke about
[1:01:28] it's not even scriptural dudes
[1:01:32] but i mean if our wives don't get along
[1:01:34] with our moms at least it's scriptural
[1:01:36] and the man's foe shall be they of his
[1:01:38] own household
[1:01:39] he that loveth father mother more than
[1:01:41] me is not worthy of me he that love a
[1:01:43] son or daughter more than me is not
[1:01:44] worthy of me
[1:01:46] amen so now i believe that we have to be
[1:01:48] very careful to say well i'm come to set
[1:01:50] a man at variance against his father
[1:01:52] and he says he came to bring a sword i
[1:01:54] have been given a sword to set it
[1:01:55] variance means to cleave into two parts
[1:01:56] let's not carry this to the extreme
[1:02:00] and show up at our dad's doorstep with
[1:02:02] the sword
[1:02:04] and say i just want you to know today
[1:02:05] from this day on i've settled my
[1:02:07] relationship with you
[1:02:08] we are no longer we are set at variance
[1:02:10] because of the message of the hour
[1:02:12] no let's not get in the kind of
[1:02:14] platitudes and these kind of
[1:02:15] that kind of rhetoric but catch the
[1:02:17] point the basic precept he's trying to
[1:02:19] build
[1:02:20] the word must be honored above family
[1:02:23] the word must be honored above pleasing
[1:02:25] family members
[1:02:26] the word must be put first above
[1:02:28] placating relatives above
[1:02:30] placating children and children's
[1:02:32] ambitions and ideas and feelings and
[1:02:33] wants
[1:02:34] the word must be first so he's saying if
[1:02:36] the word ever stands in your way or
[1:02:38] hinders your service of the word
[1:02:39] excuse me if a family if with family
[1:02:41] would ever stand in your way obeying the
[1:02:43] word
[1:02:43] if a family would ever hinder your
[1:02:44] service to god then we must resist the
[1:02:46] interference
[1:02:49] and and we can't carry this to some of
[1:02:52] the the
[1:02:53] the the mean spirited uh
[1:02:57] carnal expressions that people have when
[1:02:59] they they'll turn people off even within
[1:03:01] the message say well light can't have
[1:03:03] fellowship with darkness and because you
[1:03:04] don't believe my doctrine we can't have
[1:03:05] fellowship
[1:03:06] and it's just taking on a
[1:03:08] non-christ-like tone
[1:03:11] i mean could you imagine if if uh if i
[1:03:14] if i there's something maybe i was
[1:03:16] teaching in the word of god and
[1:03:17] and you said to me well brother aaron i
[1:03:19] don't quite see it that way and i was
[1:03:20] like well you're clearly not under my
[1:03:22] ministry
[1:03:23] so you should probably find some other
[1:03:24] place to go to church
[1:03:27] you say well if i've ever seen a clear
[1:03:29] picture of christ
[1:03:31] i've seen it now i'm so sorry i believe
[1:03:33] everything you believe now right
[1:03:34] we just immediately were corrected and
[1:03:36] we realized we were so wrong because
[1:03:37] we're so compelled by the love of christ
[1:03:40] it doesn't make sense to us and so
[1:03:42] sometimes we take the very true word of
[1:03:45] god
[1:03:45] and we begin to use it as a blunt
[1:03:47] instrument
[1:03:48] to divide relationships to chase off
[1:03:51] children
[1:03:51] to alienate people and that's not the
[1:03:53] way that it ought to be used
[1:03:55] so these scriptures are setting forth a
[1:03:57] very important principle but let's not
[1:03:58] pervert them
[1:03:59] and make them something they're not if
[1:04:01] the family stands in your way you have
[1:04:03] to stand with the word
[1:04:04] we must resist the interference
[1:04:08] and he's really setting forth the
[1:04:09] principle that a christian should be
[1:04:10] ready to part
[1:04:11] from things that are most dearest to him
[1:04:13] even family for christ's sake
[1:04:15] especially if he asked for it
[1:04:19] brother branham says in the message
[1:04:20] power of transformation sometimes you
[1:04:22] have to separate from everything that's
[1:04:24] dear on earth to you
[1:04:26] to take your position that god has
[1:04:27] called you to
[1:04:30] i'm sure you could read between the
[1:04:32] lines what i'm saying
[1:04:33] sometimes the very dearest person on
[1:04:35] earth you have to shake hands with them
[1:04:38] just take your position in christ to
[1:04:40] where god has called you
[1:04:43] that this this does not imply a fighting
[1:04:46] this does not imply swords being drawn
[1:04:49] he said
[1:04:50] shake hands not throw hands right
[1:04:53] right sometimes you have to throw hands
[1:04:57] take your position guys no shake hands
[1:04:59] brother god bless you but the lord's
[1:05:00] calling me
[1:05:02] brother god bless you but this is what
[1:05:03] i've got to do i've got to take my
[1:05:04] stance sometimes from the dearest person
[1:05:06] on earth
[1:05:07] you've got to separate he says but what
[1:05:08] is god doing transforming he says
[1:05:11] you have to shake hands take your
[1:05:12] position of christ to where god has
[1:05:14] called you this is personal this is
[1:05:15] individual
[1:05:16] what but what is god doing transforming
[1:05:18] you from what you was
[1:05:20] maybe a daughter or a son or whatever it
[1:05:21] is from a lovely family sometimes
[1:05:24] he places you somewhere else so it's not
[1:05:27] always about well where your family is
[1:05:29] and what your family is doing and what
[1:05:30] your family identity is and this is
[1:05:32] where family always was
[1:05:33] this is where mom and dad are sometimes
[1:05:35] god will take you from where
[1:05:37] all your family history was where all
[1:05:38] your family is and he actually will take
[1:05:40] you
[1:05:41] outside of that and it's not throwing
[1:05:43] hands and it's not a warfare and it's
[1:05:45] not well you're awful and you're mean
[1:05:47] and i'm going somewhere else
[1:05:48] it's like i've got to take my position i
[1:05:49] feel god leading me i've got to be
[1:05:51] obedient to this calling
[1:05:52] god bless you we love you we support you
[1:05:54] we're keeping the door open
[1:05:56] but i've got to take this journey i've
[1:05:57] got to move my family i've got to sell
[1:05:59] my house
[1:05:59] i've got to separate maybe son or
[1:06:01] daughter from a lovely family but
[1:06:03] god is placing me somewhere else he said
[1:06:06] because it's his way of doing it
[1:06:08] by renewing your mind to obey the word
[1:06:10] of god listen
[1:06:11] regardless of what the price is
[1:06:15] sometimes that's what god does and we
[1:06:17] see this principle in scripture
[1:06:18] forsaking houses brothers sisters father
[1:06:20] mother or wife or children
[1:06:21] for my name's sake i i
[1:06:25] my the sword of the word of god can set
[1:06:27] at variance it doesn't mean there has to
[1:06:29] be literal hostility
[1:06:31] between father and son but it means that
[1:06:33] there's some there's some
[1:06:34] change or there's some difference
[1:06:36] between
[1:06:39] that there's a greater identity there's
[1:06:40] a greater hood that you put on
[1:06:42] it's a wordhood not just a parenthood or
[1:06:44] fatherhood or sonship
[1:06:46] in the natural there's a different
[1:06:47] headship that you come under and this is
[1:06:49] greater and more important
[1:06:51] listen to how he puts in luke chapter 14
[1:06:53] verse 26 you want to hear a real doozy
[1:06:56] luke 14 26 if any man come to me and
[1:06:59] hate not his father
[1:07:02] so if you come to me to serve me and you
[1:07:04] don't hate your dad
[1:07:07] and you don't hate your mom and you
[1:07:09] don't hate your wife and you don't hate
[1:07:11] your children and your brother and your
[1:07:12] sister
[1:07:13] and hate your own life you cannot be my
[1:07:15] disciple
[1:07:17] listen we don't need the message
[1:07:19] translation we don't need the amplified
[1:07:21] bible we don't need
[1:07:22] just read it in this old king james and
[1:07:24] we get exactly what he's saying
[1:07:26] amen i'm picking up what you're laying
[1:07:28] down jesus
[1:07:30] and if we just take well maybe we don't
[1:07:32] but if we just took it at face value
[1:07:35] he's suggesting maybe in looking at it
[1:07:38] then i would say i'm sorry honey but
[1:07:41] god's called me to serve him so i hate
[1:07:42] you
[1:07:45] and he'll say well how come you don't
[1:07:47] tell me i love you or tell me that you
[1:07:49] love me anymore and you say well i hate
[1:07:50] you
[1:07:51] ever since i became a christian to serve
[1:07:53] god i got to hate you so
[1:07:55] i don't want to lie i don't want to
[1:07:56] speak something that's contrary to the
[1:07:58] word of god
[1:07:59] so every morning you wake up i'm going
[1:08:00] to confess the word of god i hate you
[1:08:02] honey
[1:08:03] because i want to put the word in my
[1:08:04] mouth and and eliza comes in all sleepy
[1:08:08] headed and she's all in
[1:08:09] can i get a hug i hate you
[1:08:12] i just want to put the word in my mouth
[1:08:15] because i'm sold out i'm all in
[1:08:19] i hate my sons i hate my daughter i hate
[1:08:21] my brother i hate my sister
[1:08:22] i hate my wife but jesus is using
[1:08:25] exaggeration to make his point
[1:08:28] it's actually i'd say better it's a
[1:08:29] figure of speech meaning you better love
[1:08:31] your family less than you love me
[1:08:34] he's not suggesting actual hostility
[1:08:36] towards your family actual hatred
[1:08:38] that if you don't hate your dead you
[1:08:39] really don't love me but he's actually
[1:08:41] saying there must be
[1:08:42] a greater devotion to the word of god
[1:08:44] there must be a greater connection
[1:08:46] infinity to the word toward this
[1:08:47] it never gets out of balance because if
[1:08:50] you take your natural filial love you
[1:08:52] have for your family
[1:08:53] and that's the same kind of love you
[1:08:54] have for me as an idea
[1:08:56] then there's ways that that can get
[1:08:57] flip-flopped and move around where
[1:08:59] you're never going to achieve
[1:09:01] the relationship that i desire to have
[1:09:02] with you but you must have this union
[1:09:05] with me in the word
[1:09:06] and a love for me and a bond for me in
[1:09:08] the word that transcends and graters
[1:09:10] this natural carnal love you have for
[1:09:11] your family
[1:09:12] but listen as you fall in love with him
[1:09:14] and that word has prim's i just love how
[1:09:16] it can catch that filial love and it can
[1:09:18] blend and
[1:09:19] confuse and you can love your wife
[1:09:21] correctly you can love your children
[1:09:23] correctly
[1:09:23] you can love even the family that has
[1:09:25] abused you and harmed you and hated you
[1:09:27] and alienate you but agape can come
[1:09:29] infuse and correct the filio and christ
[1:09:34] has preeminence
[1:09:37] and this is this is not a selfishness
[1:09:41] where now it's kind of like well i'm a
[1:09:42] christian so i i'm my i
[1:09:44] i i i i'm better i i don't love my
[1:09:47] family as much and it's there's no i in
[1:09:49] this this is christ
[1:09:52] where he is the he is the one that's
[1:09:54] coming into view this is actually a ref
[1:09:56] reordering of what our carnal instincts
[1:09:58] are it might initially kind of uh
[1:10:02] make you think like uh-huh see like
[1:10:06] i i've kind of had the right idea all
[1:10:07] along right
[1:10:09] that by the attitude i had and he said
[1:10:12] you gotta hate your father so i feel
[1:10:14] like i'm kind of on the right track
[1:10:16] you read that scripture i didn't realize
[1:10:18] how much more in the image of the word i
[1:10:20] was
[1:10:21] until i read luke 14 26. oh
[1:10:24] that's when you got to continue to read
[1:10:26] and understand what he's trying to say
[1:10:27] you realize oh
[1:10:28] i'm a little bit further away than i
[1:10:29] thought cause listen what brother
[1:10:31] branham says in blind bartimaeus
[1:10:33] he's speaking of blind bartimaeus he was
[1:10:35] a provider for his family
[1:10:37] he thought of his family first before
[1:10:39] himself
[1:10:41] and and this this creates the order now
[1:10:43] as father
[1:10:44] as a family head any real true daddle
[1:10:49] do that right
[1:10:52] any real truth you have true family a
[1:10:54] real true dad will do that
[1:10:56] or husband and i love this any christian
[1:11:00] will think of others before himself
[1:11:03] remember how you treat others you're
[1:11:05] treating christ it says any christian
[1:11:07] will think of others before himself
[1:11:09] every christian tries to put god first
[1:11:12] his family is second he's number
[1:11:15] three i think there was a big move a big
[1:11:19] thing that was i am second no
[1:11:23] i hope you didn't spend too much in that
[1:11:25] branding because now you need to do
[1:11:27] another trademark
[1:11:29] i am turd all right
[1:11:32] i'm not i'm not even number two i'm
[1:11:33] number three
[1:11:35] that's exactly what he's saying he's
[1:11:38] number three
[1:11:41] the person every christian puts god
[1:11:43] first his family second he's number
[1:11:44] three
[1:11:45] so all our family needs family harmony
[1:11:48] even family brokenness family distress
[1:11:50] or family ambition all these things
[1:11:51] cannot be placed over the word
[1:11:54] family is second so christ is first
[1:11:58] family a second
[1:12:00] and then you're number three so you're
[1:12:02] not even becoming the division
[1:12:05] or the one that separates family but now
[1:12:07] you begin to reorder everything and
[1:12:09] prioritize
[1:12:10] if i can put god first then family can
[1:12:13] properly be second
[1:12:15] but if god's not first put it in any
[1:12:17] order you want
[1:12:19] you know you can make your family first
[1:12:21] you can become second however you want
[1:12:22] to it's just not going to work
[1:12:24] god has to be first and if god is truly
[1:12:27] first there's just a way that god orders
[1:12:29] it
[1:12:30] or if it was you and you were second and
[1:12:32] as god begins to have the premise all of
[1:12:33] a sudden there's something about your
[1:12:34] nature
[1:12:35] as it begins to change in the sweetness
[1:12:37] of the holy ghost
[1:12:38] in the way that he changes you and the
[1:12:40] way that he deals with certain things
[1:12:42] all of a sudden now you realize you know
[1:12:43] what it's not all about me
[1:12:45] and you begin to take your place as
[1:12:46] number three
[1:12:49] very beautiful how that works god first
[1:12:51] family second and your last
[1:12:53] but we can only become number three
[1:12:55] through the humility of christ
[1:12:57] we're taught in matthew chapter 6 verse
[1:12:59] 33 as it brings into the image of
[1:13:01] food and drink and clothing and how that
[1:13:03] after all these things do the gentiles
[1:13:04] seek and
[1:13:05] they want to have nice things and and
[1:13:06] they want to provide and they want to
[1:13:08] have
[1:13:09] all these as a parent would for their
[1:13:10] children provide the best
[1:13:13] but all those things can make a house
[1:13:14] but it doesn't make a home
[1:13:17] having all those things doesn't make you
[1:13:18] more spiritual
[1:13:20] a man cannot brag that he's paid off his
[1:13:22] house he doesn't owe anything on his
[1:13:23] cars
[1:13:24] he doesn't have a credit card all his
[1:13:25] children wear the latest and
[1:13:27] and and all these different things and
[1:13:29] everything's in order and my wife and i
[1:13:31] you know we we all of our children are
[1:13:33] serving the lord and all of them are at
[1:13:34] home and we don't have a tv in our home
[1:13:36] and describing all these different
[1:13:38] things and we have
[1:13:38] and start describing all these natural
[1:13:40] elements but you can just do that by
[1:13:42] being disciplined
[1:13:44] you can just do that by taking certain
[1:13:46] rules and this is a prescription for
[1:13:48] for this but it's got to be a true
[1:13:50] ambition and a true goal as it says
[1:13:52] seek ye first the kingdom of god and his
[1:13:54] righteousness
[1:13:55] so as we seek him first and his
[1:13:57] righteousness this is nature this is
[1:13:59] character
[1:13:59] this is life all these things shall be
[1:14:01] added unto you
[1:14:03] now if we get it in reverse families
[1:14:05] first i'm second
[1:14:06] our ambition can be naturally as a
[1:14:08] parent to be sure they're fed to be sure
[1:14:10] they're clothed be sure the mortgage is
[1:14:11] paid be sure they have all these things
[1:14:13] but my ambition is not seeking him first
[1:14:16] and though
[1:14:16] all these things have been added they're
[1:14:18] not necessarily blessings their
[1:14:19] possessions
[1:14:22] but if you seek first the kingdom of god
[1:14:24] he will add to you as
[1:14:25] blessing houses and lands and provision
[1:14:28] and substance and all these things food
[1:14:30] drinking clothing all these things will
[1:14:32] be added unto you what is this
[1:14:34] this is the kind of lifestyle that has
[1:14:36] prioritized the word
[1:14:37] has prioritized christ and through
[1:14:39] putting christ first
[1:14:40] family being second is the immediate
[1:14:43] beneficiary
[1:14:44] of your decision to make him number one
[1:14:53] and this only this can only be achieved
[1:14:55] then
[1:14:57] through the humility of christ i'm going
[1:14:59] to read i'm going to just kind of
[1:15:02] pick through this statement and how can
[1:15:04] i overcome brother branham's talking
[1:15:05] about how he made his first attack
[1:15:07] upon jesus so the temptation in the
[1:15:09] garden corresponds to the temptation of
[1:15:11] christ
[1:15:12] first adam and the woman now the last
[1:15:14] adam god tempting him or satan tempting
[1:15:16] him
[1:15:17] led of the spirit in the wilderness and
[1:15:18] he says he knew his position
[1:15:20] so now it's based upon knowing who he
[1:15:22] was his position
[1:15:23] satan come and wanted him to use his own
[1:15:25] power on himself to feed him
[1:15:27] and want to feed himself he was hungry a
[1:15:30] man gets hungry he can do almost
[1:15:31] anything still rob beg borrow anything
[1:15:34] he had that appetite now think of your
[1:15:36] instinct as a parent
[1:15:38] that if you don't know your position and
[1:15:39] you're only trying to satisfy
[1:15:41] cardinal need carnal urge things that
[1:15:43] that are necessary
[1:15:45] then you're willing to almost do
[1:15:46] anything to achieve it
[1:15:48] but satan used his great major salt on
[1:15:50] him to take his power that he had given
[1:15:52] to overcome with
[1:15:53] and use it on himself he didn't use it
[1:15:56] on himself he used it for others
[1:15:58] he used it on others not for himself it
[1:16:00] wasn't for him though he could have done
[1:16:02] it he certainly could have done it
[1:16:03] paragraph 116 if you can identify it in
[1:16:05] there towards the bottom there but we
[1:16:07] see
[1:16:07] how the devil gets the devil wants you
[1:16:09] to mind him
[1:16:11] he minded only what the father said do
[1:16:14] that's right he said why satan it is
[1:16:15] written
[1:16:17] he give the angels charge so jesus goes
[1:16:20] back to what
[1:16:20] the word not even his needs as a man in
[1:16:23] his power to meet it as a man
[1:16:25] he made it subject to the word next
[1:16:27] slide he said yes but it's also written
[1:16:29] there you are he knew who he was satan
[1:16:32] did
[1:16:32] the thought runs deeper than its rope
[1:16:35] its inspiration
[1:16:36] the kernel is on the inside of it what
[1:16:38] it really is this is so good
[1:16:41] though he could have done it he didn't
[1:16:43] do it he never
[1:16:44] paid heed to satan's proposition
[1:16:48] and this is i think where he's saying
[1:16:49] the colonel's on the inside come on our
[1:16:50] identity our true identity who we really
[1:16:52] are
[1:16:52] and he's looking at this this exchange
[1:16:55] between satan and christ
[1:16:56] and now he makes it very relevant to us
[1:16:58] now here is a good thing sometimes satan
[1:17:00] can take you
[1:17:01] and when you think you're doing the will
[1:17:02] of god and can make you a proposition
[1:17:04] you fall for it
[1:17:05] yes sure he sure can yes sir he sure can
[1:17:08] now let's just take for instance this is
[1:17:10] really good
[1:17:12] let's for instance like our sisters they
[1:17:14] are pretty amen
[1:17:16] and he can get you to a place that you
[1:17:18] let your hair grow out
[1:17:19] and you didn't realize it looks so nice
[1:17:21] on you and the first thing you know you
[1:17:22] kind of get feeling a little stuck up
[1:17:24] a little above someone else some of you
[1:17:27] men you know what i mean
[1:17:30] you guys you're wise you're really good
[1:17:33] can't
[1:17:33] can't provoke you into saying amen and
[1:17:35] getting a bruised rib
[1:17:36] and he can make that same thing and
[1:17:38] proposition it with you that's right
[1:17:40] you've got to overcome that he's talking
[1:17:43] about humility
[1:17:45] toward even what god is doing in your
[1:17:47] life it's not lifting you up saying
[1:17:48] god's first i'm second but there's
[1:17:51] something to where you
[1:17:52] you through the humility of christ your
[1:17:54] ambition your holiness is not an
[1:17:56] expression of how good you are you don't
[1:17:58] get a little stuck up because of god's
[1:17:59] blessings
[1:18:00] you see that god i know my position i
[1:18:02] know where he's placed me if he's placed
[1:18:04] me third i view myself as being some
[1:18:06] sort of
[1:18:06] foundational element some sort of
[1:18:08] servant beneath
[1:18:10] my family with god as the head that i
[1:18:12] can lift up from beneath to him
[1:18:14] i can serve from beneath to him god
[1:18:16] working from above me working from below
[1:18:19] heaven is his throne here i am is his
[1:18:21] footstool let me place my family
[1:18:23] in between us it's a family sandwich
[1:18:28] right and you and god are the bread the
[1:18:31] families the meat
[1:18:32] and you serve to hold it together you
[1:18:35] serve to
[1:18:36] to you you want to exist to serve it now
[1:18:38] this is just changing our attitude this
[1:18:39] humility
[1:18:40] you've got to overcome that just
[1:18:41] remember you're living for god
[1:18:43] you have one objective that's jesus
[1:18:46] christ
[1:18:47] outside of that there is nothing else he
[1:18:50] says there is nothing else and there's
[1:18:51] nothing else counts
[1:18:54] that's him so we have one objective
[1:18:57] christ then secondly for your family
[1:19:01] then thirdly for yourself but first for
[1:19:04] god
[1:19:05] and he repeats in case we just didn't
[1:19:06] get it right next for your family
[1:19:09] and next for you you are number three
[1:19:13] can we have someone make a foam finger
[1:19:15] it's this
[1:19:18] there's always the one i'm number one
[1:19:20] right but i mean i go
[1:19:22] hey hey have your name on it too right
[1:19:26] i'm number three i mean what the
[1:19:30] what is that i'm number three
[1:19:33] you say see at least you got the bronze
[1:19:35] at least you're on the stand
[1:19:36] says you're number three that's the end
[1:19:38] of the road put yourself
[1:19:40] last he did that's the masterpiece
[1:19:43] husband
[1:19:45] he put himself last first god
[1:19:50] next your family third yourself
[1:19:53] this is the order that god gives it now
[1:19:56] my main point is this is the word first
[1:19:58] family second
[1:20:00] now don't filter what family is don't
[1:20:04] put your filter on it
[1:20:05] don't scroll through and say family is
[1:20:08] husband and wife in a fully paid off
[1:20:09] house with a boy and a girl there
[1:20:13] and choose that filter
[1:20:17] family is is something that is related
[1:20:20] to
[1:20:20] an expression a relationship but it has
[1:20:23] to be it's it's something that only has
[1:20:25] context within the word of god
[1:20:27] you have you have the word in whatever
[1:20:28] family is to you whatever relationship
[1:20:30] it is to you whatever expression it has
[1:20:32] for you
[1:20:33] that has to be second
[1:20:39] now with that as the foundation i'd like
[1:20:40] you to look at our text
[1:20:44] i'm just gonna i wanna i'm gonna end
[1:20:46] with this story
[1:20:49] but travis i really needed that
[1:20:50] worksheet to be able to summarize this
[1:20:52] story a little bit better but he never
[1:20:53] emailed it to me
[1:20:55] but speaking of elijah it says he
[1:20:58] after these ravens had fed him at the
[1:21:00] brook sheriff and
[1:21:02] kind of very interesting ravens not
[1:21:04] being a clean bird according to
[1:21:05] to a jew here he is at this brook he's
[1:21:07] being fed by ravens
[1:21:09] but now the brook dries up the ravens
[1:21:10] aren't coming so god calls him
[1:21:13] and so it it he's commanded not to go
[1:21:15] start with verse 10 so he arose and went
[1:21:16] to zarephath
[1:21:20] and now as he comes to therefore
[1:21:21] remember the context this is a time of
[1:21:23] drought
[1:21:25] be in a time of drought where there is
[1:21:26] no rain it's a time of famine because
[1:21:27] they haven't been to grow grain
[1:21:29] so the most precious resources would be
[1:21:31] number one water
[1:21:32] and by virtue of no water there was not
[1:21:34] very much meal or grain or corn or
[1:21:36] anything to grow
[1:21:38] so water would be the most precious
[1:21:40] resource
[1:21:42] and he says he comes to the gate of the
[1:21:43] city and a widow woman was there
[1:21:45] gathering sticks
[1:21:47] so now he comes up and he's he's
[1:21:49] thinking oh man the first woman i come
[1:21:50] up to at the gate
[1:21:52] come to a woman and maybe he's inspired
[1:21:53] god told me that there would be a woman
[1:21:55] here and he sees her gathering sticks
[1:21:56] and if she's gathering sticks maybe
[1:21:58] she's
[1:21:59] maybe there's something she has some
[1:22:00] kind of resource she needs a fire and he
[1:22:02] called her and said fetch me i pray thee
[1:22:04] a little water in a vessel that i may
[1:22:06] drink
[1:22:07] and his faith is kind of valued a little
[1:22:09] bit because she says immediately and she
[1:22:11] was going to fetch it and it speaks so
[1:22:12] much to her character
[1:22:13] this little woman her character was not
[1:22:16] water
[1:22:18] what you just asked for the most
[1:22:20] important thing i could get you a stick
[1:22:21] or two
[1:22:22] but you've asked for water this is very
[1:22:24] precious but there's something
[1:22:25] instinctive to where she doesn't object
[1:22:27] she goes to get the water
[1:22:28] and perhaps elijah's now being a little
[1:22:30] bit more encouraged so he says
[1:22:31] oh wait and also bring me a morsel of
[1:22:34] bread
[1:22:36] in my hand and then she says the lord
[1:22:39] liveth i don't have bread i don't have a
[1:22:40] cake
[1:22:41] all i have is a little bit of meal in a
[1:22:42] barrel a little bit of oil
[1:22:44] and she says i'm just going to get a
[1:22:45] couple sticks to make a fire then i may
[1:22:47] go back home
[1:22:48] and make a fire prepare the bread give
[1:22:51] it to my son
[1:22:53] that we both will eat and die
[1:22:56] so now elijah is thinking maybe not
[1:22:59] maybe this isn't the woman
[1:23:01] right we're just looking at it from a
[1:23:02] natural standpoint
[1:23:04] but notice how the story now at this
[1:23:06] very moment at this
[1:23:07] this part in verse 14
[1:23:10] elijah now speaks fear not and go and do
[1:23:15] as thou has said
[1:23:17] go take care of your son
[1:23:20] go do what your instinct was as a mother
[1:23:23] but make me a cake first
[1:23:26] bring it to me first and then after
[1:23:28] you've made it for me make one for you
[1:23:30] and your son
[1:23:32] and if you do this this is the promise
[1:23:34] if you do that the barrel of mill shall
[1:23:35] not waste neither shall the crews of oil
[1:23:37] fail
[1:23:37] until the day that the lord sin reigns
[1:23:38] upon the earth it says in verse 15 she
[1:23:40] went and did according to the saying of
[1:23:42] elijah
[1:23:43] and she and he elijah and her house her
[1:23:45] family or her household
[1:23:47] did eat many days and it says the barrel
[1:23:49] of meal wasted not
[1:23:50] neither did the crucifer oil fail
[1:23:52] according to the word of the lord
[1:23:54] which he spake by elijah
[1:23:57] there's an image that's being expressed
[1:23:58] here to me that's so beautiful
[1:24:00] because on one hand it's it's it's
[1:24:02] supporting what i'm wanting to leave in
[1:24:04] your minds today
[1:24:06] is that where the word must be placed
[1:24:08] first
[1:24:10] but i love how god has so beautifully
[1:24:11] arranged the scripture that here you
[1:24:13] have a
[1:24:14] what is called a widow this is a woman
[1:24:16] without a husband
[1:24:18] and even though she didn't have a
[1:24:19] husband she had a use and a utility
[1:24:22] within the framework of god's word to
[1:24:23] produce and bring forth the promise
[1:24:25] here is a woman a woman and her son and
[1:24:28] that's a family
[1:24:30] maybe unconventional may be different
[1:24:33] than our white picket fence and the way
[1:24:34] we have it all drawn up in our nuclear
[1:24:36] family
[1:24:37] right it's a little bit different than
[1:24:40] the conventional image but it's still a
[1:24:41] family
[1:24:43] and though maybe not in the image that
[1:24:45] we might think is desirable maybe not in
[1:24:47] the image that we say that the original
[1:24:48] masterpiece family was in
[1:24:50] but yet this is a woman that was under a
[1:24:51] divine commission and had a purpose
[1:24:54] because it said in verse nine arise and
[1:24:56] get thee deserve which belongs to zidane
[1:24:58] and dwell there behold i have commanded
[1:25:00] i have appointed i have purposed i have
[1:25:02] positioned a
[1:25:04] widow woman there to sustain me i have
[1:25:06] called a woman without a husband
[1:25:07] i've called a woman in a very difficult
[1:25:09] circumstance i've called a woman
[1:25:10] who is having to make a living for
[1:25:12] herself and for her children
[1:25:14] she doesn't have the resources that
[1:25:15] other families has she doesn't have the
[1:25:17] reputation that other families have
[1:25:19] but i have called her i've appointed her
[1:25:20] i've commissioned her i placed her she
[1:25:22] has a purpose
[1:25:26] and we will find purpose and fulfillment
[1:25:29] and serving him first not our families
[1:25:33] certainly not our own interest not
[1:25:34] our own agenda and not our own pain
[1:25:37] we'll find purpose in serving
[1:25:39] him first brother brahm said this about
[1:25:42] her
[1:25:43] she put god first excuse me she put god
[1:25:47] before her children musicians if you'd
[1:25:48] come
[1:25:49] she put god before her children
[1:25:52] she put god before anything else
[1:25:57] she taken the kingdom of god first
[1:26:01] god must have first place in your heart
[1:26:03] first place in your life
[1:26:05] first place in everything that you do or
[1:26:07] what you are god
[1:26:09] must be first i'm thankful for that
[1:26:14] because then i don't i'm not gonna i'm
[1:26:15] not gonna take who i
[1:26:17] am and place it under the headship of my
[1:26:20] past
[1:26:22] and i'm not going to take my mistakes
[1:26:24] and my my ramblings and my failures
[1:26:26] and i'm going to i'm going to wear them
[1:26:28] on a
[1:26:29] a jacket so to speak and say look i i
[1:26:32] lettered in frustration
[1:26:34] see this see see 97 to 2000 right there
[1:26:37] i let it in doubt and have a bunch of
[1:26:40] letters on my coat that describe what i
[1:26:42] was in the past
[1:26:44] but i want to make him what i am
[1:26:48] putting first place in everything what
[1:26:50] he says that you do or what you are
[1:26:53] god must be first he doesn't want the
[1:26:54] second place he doesn't deserve the
[1:26:55] second place he deserves the best and
[1:26:57] the first and all that we've got he
[1:26:59] deserves it
[1:27:01] this is what is expressed in christ as
[1:27:02] the mystery of god revealed christ
[1:27:05] must have preeminence and then as christ
[1:27:09] has premises he has the first place
[1:27:11] we can then grow into a true family
[1:27:16] that's the only there's no other way
[1:27:17] that it can happen
[1:27:22] and i love it too because i
[1:27:27] i mean maybe it might seem apparent
[1:27:30] and if there's if there's an elephant in
[1:27:32] the room let's just mention it
[1:27:34] we don't all have spouses do we
[1:27:38] we don't all have children still at home
[1:27:40] we don't all have children serving the
[1:27:41] lord
[1:27:42] none of us look back and have it
[1:27:44] perfectly
[1:27:47] and so it could be very foreboding
[1:27:51] and certain teachings can become so
[1:27:53] narrowed down to where it becomes so
[1:27:54] exclusive
[1:27:56] and say hey for the next few months
[1:27:58] those of you who aren't under 40
[1:28:00] and have children under 13 you can stay
[1:28:02] home
[1:28:04] or go somewhere else and uh
[1:28:07] and and you can wait until i've raised
[1:28:09] teenagers
[1:28:10] before i'll teach on that no it doesn't
[1:28:12] become exclusive it doesn't become
[1:28:14] unapplicable it's applicable
[1:28:16] but the beautiful thing about putting
[1:28:18] the word first
[1:28:19] and letting christ have the preeminence
[1:28:21] and then you put god first family second
[1:28:23] you become last year third
[1:28:24] is this principle then of putting the
[1:28:26] word first in the beginning was the word
[1:28:28] and the family became second this
[1:28:29] principle becomes the great equalizer
[1:28:30] among us all
[1:28:33] it's what brings us all on the same
[1:28:34] footing christ
[1:28:36] is our objective my family hasn't become
[1:28:40] my objective
[1:28:41] christ has become my objective that's
[1:28:44] become my objective
[1:28:45] and so none of us begin to grow long
[1:28:47] hair and think we're prettier than
[1:28:49] anybody else
[1:28:51] christ has become my objective none of
[1:28:53] us begin to figure it out what works
[1:28:54] with our sons and none of it begin to
[1:28:56] figure out what works in our marriage
[1:28:57] and begin to feel better than anybody
[1:28:58] else no that's not what happens
[1:29:00] the more that christ begins to become
[1:29:03] first then the more we become third and
[1:29:05] then we never
[1:29:05] lift up any particular image of family
[1:29:08] as better than anybody else
[1:29:10] it makes somebody feel like they lack or
[1:29:11] that they don't feel like they belong
[1:29:13] the word becomes
[1:29:14] the great equalizer christ is our
[1:29:16] objective and in christ you're my
[1:29:18] brother
[1:29:18] you're my sister we're all one in this
[1:29:22] together
[1:29:24] regardless of family status regardless
[1:29:26] of the structure of a family regardless
[1:29:28] of
[1:29:28] the quality of the relationships we
[1:29:30] share in our natural life we share the
[1:29:32] same vision
[1:29:34] and look around you're my brother you're
[1:29:36] my brother you're my sister you're my
[1:29:38] sister
[1:29:39] we're family we
[1:29:42] we we have a we have a family that we
[1:29:44] serve we have an identity that is
[1:29:46] greater and then i love it if we have a
[1:29:48] word
[1:29:48] family then i have word resources at my
[1:29:51] disposal
[1:29:52] i've got word people who can pray for me
[1:29:54] in my natural family situation
[1:29:56] i've got word people that can minister
[1:29:58] to my needs in the natural
[1:30:00] i'm part of something greater i'm part
[1:30:02] of something more supernatural
[1:30:04] and that's where i derive my
[1:30:06] instructions that's where i get my
[1:30:08] identity
[1:30:08] as a son or daughter of god amen not as
[1:30:11] the son of david mcgeary senior
[1:30:15] that's not why i derive it
[1:30:21] put god first if we all do that
[1:30:26] then we don't place anybody else third
[1:30:30] [Music]
[1:30:31] it's a great equalizer let's stand
[1:30:49] [Music]
[1:30:57] [Music]
[1:30:59] such a beautiful presence here today
[1:31:02] [Music]
[1:31:05] the lesson is put him first
[1:31:10] put him first in all that you are your
[1:31:13] identity
[1:31:14] serve him several of the scriptures that
[1:31:18] i wanted to share
[1:31:21] there's stories in the bible where god
[1:31:24] is using very specific relationships
[1:31:27] and you have a woman of ill fame a
[1:31:29] prostitute
[1:31:30] who did what gave vent her inspiration
[1:31:34] and went forth to serve him
[1:31:38] she didn't let her past her
[1:31:40] relationships none of that
[1:31:42] changed it you talk about a messed up
[1:31:45] family the woman at the well
[1:31:47] bring me your husband she's
[1:31:51] bold enough so i don't have a husband no
[1:31:54] and maybe the guy at home was like what
[1:31:57] am i
[1:31:58] right the sixth one and he says yeah
[1:32:00] you're right
[1:32:01] you've had five and the one you're with
[1:32:02] now is not your husband that's kind of a
[1:32:04] messed up situation right
[1:32:06] we look down on people who just had one
[1:32:08] and now on number two this one
[1:32:09] this is a really bad situation for a
[1:32:11] teenager his brother brandon places her
[1:32:14] she's still used there's still a word
[1:32:17] for her there still was a position for
[1:32:18] her
[1:32:19] she went into the city said come see a
[1:32:21] man who's told me everything i've done
[1:32:23] and and we see this this great equalizer
[1:32:26] that in christ were one
[1:32:28] if through the humility of christ we
[1:32:30] could begin to put ourselves third and
[1:32:31] say lord
[1:32:31] i'll put you first family second i'm
[1:32:34] last
[1:32:35] and we take away from that we're not
[1:32:37] getting hung up on what number two is
[1:32:39] we're getting hung up on who's number
[1:32:40] one that's what's important
[1:32:43] who's number one
[1:32:46] and then if you could almost look at it
[1:32:47] in terms of a
[1:32:49] of an effort and what you're putting
[1:32:51] forth if you're third
[1:32:52] and family second and christ is number
[1:32:55] one
[1:32:56] then you're you want to serve christ
[1:32:59] and so this ambition to serve christ
[1:33:02] it's just going to run through who's
[1:33:03] number two
[1:33:04] my ambition to put it first is going to
[1:33:06] have some sort of influence
[1:33:07] and flow to who's number two we use a
[1:33:10] language perhaps to create some kind of
[1:33:12] hierarchy and order
[1:33:13] but listen at the end of the day it's
[1:33:14] about christ the word having preambs
[1:33:16] that's what we're lifting up that's what
[1:33:18] we want to achieve
[1:33:19] we have one objective that's christ
[1:33:22] that's what we're trying to achieve
[1:33:23] let's bow our heads a gracious heavenly
[1:33:27] father
[1:33:29] as we've crossed over midday and we're
[1:33:32] in the afternoon
[1:33:37] we've looked into the word and we've
[1:33:39] seen expressions
[1:33:45] that we gain instruction from
[1:33:51] that we see as actual stories
[1:33:55] things that literally happen which
[1:33:58] convey the supernatural
[1:34:02] of a prophet in a time of famine
[1:34:08] being told to go to a town a smelter
[1:34:11] town a place with a refinery
[1:34:13] to find a widow woman another gentile an
[1:34:16] unclean bird now a gentile woman
[1:34:20] and you had ordained a gentile woman and
[1:34:23] we see the supernatural because she
[1:34:25] received the prophet and takes him at
[1:34:26] his word
[1:34:27] she puts god first and in this story we
[1:34:29] see provision comes around the crucible
[1:34:31] oil never runs
[1:34:32] out the the barrel of meal never runs
[1:34:33] out and her and her family live all
[1:34:35] these days because
[1:34:38] she put you first because the word that
[1:34:40] came from the prophet according to the
[1:34:41] saying of elijah
[1:34:43] lord that literally happened
[1:34:46] but now father not only are we receiving
[1:34:49] a knowledge of a supernatural instance
[1:34:51] but we also receive
[1:34:52] instruction and even through the type
[1:34:54] that you had a
[1:34:56] calling for a woman without a husband
[1:34:58] you had a calling for a woman
[1:34:59] in a difficult situation you had a
[1:35:01] calling for a family dynamic that wasn't
[1:35:03] the perfect picture
[1:35:05] of what was even in the beginning
[1:35:09] and what we gather from that is
[1:35:10] regardless of what we are in the natural
[1:35:13] what we're called to do is to put
[1:35:15] you first and the natural
[1:35:19] will take care of itself perhaps lord i
[1:35:22] would say it another way we put the
[1:35:23] supernatural first and the supernatural
[1:35:25] just has a way
[1:35:27] of putting the natural in perspective
[1:35:30] father that would be my prayer as we've
[1:35:32] looked at these
[1:35:33] different principles in the word of god
[1:35:35] today and through these last several
[1:35:36] services and even introducing the
[1:35:38] subject of the family
[1:35:40] may we all be brought into union and
[1:35:42] fellowship on this thought
[1:35:44] christ is our objective the word
[1:35:47] is first and that we have experienced
[1:35:51] difficult situations wherein god has
[1:35:53] called us away from family
[1:35:56] moved us lord and and
[1:36:00] seemingly a separation from those that
[1:36:02] we love to place us in a position
[1:36:06] where you want us to be and sometimes we
[1:36:09] have to shake hands with our brothers
[1:36:10] sometimes we have to
[1:36:12] look our family in the eye and say god's
[1:36:14] calling me to do something else but we
[1:36:15] do it to take our position
[1:36:17] in you and i pray lord that as i
[1:36:22] may be influenced by personal a personal
[1:36:25] burden that i share and
[1:36:26] i may be very conscious of the different
[1:36:30] situations that we have within our
[1:36:32] church
[1:36:34] that vary from what we call the
[1:36:36] idealistic pattern
[1:36:39] lord i'm aware that we have husbands and
[1:36:42] wives of young age and raising families
[1:36:44] and that ways
[1:36:45] that becomes a burden to these men and
[1:36:47] these brothers and sisters
[1:36:49] lord i want i want to preach a positive
[1:36:52] gospel that encourages all of us
[1:36:54] i pray that we could always revisit this
[1:36:56] the word first
[1:36:57] we put you first we let you have
[1:36:58] preeminence
[1:37:00] that's that's our objective lord and i
[1:37:03] pray that today as we have lifted you up
[1:37:05] may we be drawn unto you
[1:37:07] may hearts be encouraged may we just

[1:37:19] we commit the people to you today lord

[1:37:22] with us as we worship for a few moments
[1:37:25] in the name of the lord jesus christ we

[1:38:30] it's a beautiful song to ponder could we
[1:38:32] just ponder it for a moment let me just
[1:38:34] express this in the story of the widow
[1:38:36] of zaraphat
[1:38:38] that's all she was left with was pieces
[1:38:42] nothing was whole
[1:38:45] on that day she woke up as a mom
[1:38:48] who knew this would be her son's last
[1:38:51] meal now a lot of you may not be able to
[1:38:55] relate to that
[1:38:57] talk about desperation you talk about
[1:39:00] darkness
[1:39:03] and here's something she paints that she
[1:39:06] expresses a
[1:39:07] an action an activity and a faith that
[1:39:08] we can grab a hold of
[1:39:10] and we can use her example though she
[1:39:12] didn't have the image she didn't have
[1:39:14] the knowledge we have she didn't say oh
[1:39:15] elijah god's going to use your spirit
[1:39:17] five times and you're the first coming
[1:39:18] of elijah
[1:39:19] and she didn't have that she just had a
[1:39:22] commission she had a calling
[1:39:24] and her instinct was lord her instinct
[1:39:26] was you want water
[1:39:27] i'll get you water oh you want me to
[1:39:30] make you a cake well let me just let you
[1:39:31] know
[1:39:32] all i've got is broken pieces all i've
[1:39:35] got is a little bit of meal and a little
[1:39:36] bit of oil and all i have is a son i
[1:39:38] don't even have a husband we're just
[1:39:40] all broken pieces and he says just put
[1:39:42] me first
[1:39:43] and i can make pieces whole again just
[1:39:46] put me first
[1:39:48] oh you see this example in the ministry
[1:39:50] of elijah and elisha with the spirit of
[1:39:51] elijah
[1:39:52] is about making whole and and restoring
[1:39:55] and raising up from the dead
[1:39:56] can we have faith to believe today as
[1:39:59] those who've come under
[1:40:00] the the message of elijah in this hour
[1:40:02] that he is a redeemer
[1:40:04] he is a restorer if we put him
[1:40:07] first it says a hundredfold not even in
[1:40:11] this life but the life to come
[1:40:14] over there it'll all be made right
[1:40:18] and just then today say lord i'm looking
[1:40:21] at a lot of broken pieces
[1:40:24] but just let the fire come and through
[1:40:28] a melting and a breaking down
[1:40:31] you can take something that looks broken
[1:40:34] and bring it all back together again
[1:40:37] consider me
[1:40:40] lord with the fire
[1:40:45] of your spirit
[1:40:56] and make me more
[1:40:59] like you
