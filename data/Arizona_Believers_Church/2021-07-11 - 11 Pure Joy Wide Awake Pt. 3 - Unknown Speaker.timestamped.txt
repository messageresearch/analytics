[0:00] matthew chapter 26
[0:04] verses 36 to 44.
[0:12] then cometh jesus with them unto a place
[0:14] called gethsemane and saith unto the
[0:16] disciples sit ye hear while i go and
[0:18] pray yonder
[0:20] and he took with him peter and two sons
[0:22] of zebedee and begin to be sorrowful and
[0:23] very
[0:24] heavy then saith he unto them my soul
[0:28] is exceeding sorrowful even unto death
[0:31] tarry ye hear and watch with me so he's
[0:35] wanting them
[0:36] he's trying to impress upon them the
[0:38] severity the urgency of the moment
[0:41] and so he expresses just how sorrowful
[0:43] he is and then he tells them terry and
[0:44] watch
[0:45] watch with me and he went a little
[0:47] further and fell on his face and prayed
[0:49] saying oh father if it be possible
[0:51] let this cup pass for me nevertheless
[0:54] not as i will but as thou wilt
[0:56] and he cometh unto the disciples and
[0:58] findeth them asleep
[1:00] and saith unto peter what could you not
[1:02] watch with me one hour
[1:04] watch and pray that you enter not into
[1:06] temptation the spirit indeed is willing
[1:08] but the flesh
[1:09] is weak he went away again the second
[1:11] time and prayed saying oh father
[1:13] if this cup may not pass away from me
[1:16] except i drink it
[1:17] thy will be done and he came and found
[1:20] them asleep
[1:21] again for their eyes were heavy and he
[1:24] left them
[1:24] and went away again and prayed the third
[1:26] time saying
[1:28] the same words let's bow our heads
[1:31] please our gracious heavenly father
[1:32] we know that the word which we have read
[1:34] is eternal we know that it is perfect
[1:37] man may look upon it and find
[1:39] inconsistencies or historical
[1:40] inaccuracies or
[1:42] unable to even find maybe some
[1:45] archaeological
[1:46] affirmation that these things are true
[1:48] may even be able to look within the text
[1:50] itself and find
[1:51] what they believe to be contradictions
[1:53] or inconsistencies
[1:55] yet lord within this written word that
[1:58] to man
[1:58] into the eyes of man and man's logic may
[2:00] seem flawed
[2:02] there's a revelation of jesus christ
[2:03] that is perfect
[2:05] and lord we pray that as we read these
[2:06] verses that christ could be made alive
[2:08] to us through them
[2:10] and to do that lord it would take you
[2:12] any man could turn the pages of the
[2:13] bible but it takes you to turn the heart
[2:15] it takes you to make it real to us by
[2:17] revelation
[2:19] so come lord take the subject that lays
[2:20] before us and speak to the people that
[2:22] sit before me lord
[2:24] in a way that is special that touches
[2:26] their heart and encourages them
[2:28] we love you and we ask this in the name
[2:29] of the lord jesus christ
[2:31] amen god bless you you can take your
[2:34] seats continue on the subject of wide
[2:37] awake
[2:38] and under the thought of pure joy
[2:41] and i want to maybe i want to make just
[2:43] a few statements in the outset
[2:45] to kind of gather us all together just
[2:48] the exact spot that we are as we've
[2:50] ministered on the subject of pure joy
[2:52] in several services and approached it
[2:54] from different angles
[2:56] i feel now that we're really getting
[2:57] into the real thrust of what god was
[2:59] dealing with my heart when the thought
[3:01] came to me
[3:02] of pure joy even how we're we read in
[3:05] the church age book brother and says and
[3:06] may his coming
[3:07] rejoice your heart and different
[3:09] principles in the scripture
[3:10] how that the believer's reaction to the
[3:12] word of god being fulfilled ought to be
[3:14] one of joy
[3:15] and that we ought to be so impressed by
[3:18] watching god confirm and vindicate
[3:21] his promises and interpret his word by
[3:23] bringing it to pass
[3:24] that that becomes the source of our
[3:26] exaltation and our
[3:27] jubilance and our in our happiness as
[3:30] opposed to
[3:31] all the horrible things that are going
[3:32] on in the world as a matter of fact when
[3:34] you see something horrible happen
[3:36] when you can connect it with prophecy
[3:38] what does that often do to you give you
[3:40] peace
[3:40] oh god's in control he talked about this
[3:43] he said this would happen
[3:44] and we even recognize that jesus told
[3:46] his disciples certain things and said
[3:48] i'm telling you this now so that
[3:50] what happens it'll give you confidence
[3:52] knowing that i prophesied it before so
[3:54] the source of our joy
[3:56] is connected to god fulfilling his word
[3:58] so i feel
[3:59] in this subject of wide awake i'm kind
[4:01] of coming to some of the principles that
[4:03] really
[4:03] inspired this whole subject and as we're
[4:07] looking at pure joy we're kind of using
[4:08] this thought that pure joy is found in
[4:10] or experienced in being wide awake
[4:13] and brother bam talks about our spirits
[4:15] being clean and sober
[4:16] and serious and it being fresh and it
[4:19] being real
[4:20] and so we've talked about a conscience
[4:22] that we have a clean conscience
[4:24] and now we're looking at maybe our
[4:25] consciousness how that we ought to be
[4:27] wide awake so a healthy
[4:29] conscience is one that is serious and
[4:32] being fully conscious that is one that
[4:34] is sober it's not
[4:35] uh inordinately impacted or stimulated
[4:39] by the wrong things to pervert our
[4:40] senses
[4:42] and one thing i think we have made at
[4:44] one point we made last time is our clean
[4:46] conscience if we have a healthy
[4:47] conscience it's not defiled it's not
[4:48] weak
[4:49] it's not seared but we have a healthy
[4:52] clean conscience that means we know that
[4:53] our sins are forgiven
[4:55] we we are in contact with the holy
[4:57] spirit down inside of our souls which is
[4:59] kind of telling us that's not right
[5:00] that's not right
[5:01] do this do that then uh then that's
[5:04] there's that alignment that we need but
[5:06] that clean conscience
[5:07] operates perfectly within full
[5:10] consciousness
[5:12] if your senses are dulled or you're kind
[5:14] of drunken or a little bit in a stoop or
[5:16] you're not completely aware
[5:18] and you're not fully alert even in our
[5:20] senses
[5:21] of our mind and our body then that clean
[5:24] conscience is not able to function
[5:26] uh under the control of that man on the
[5:28] inside of the man the holy ghost in the
[5:30] soul
[5:31] and so this full consciousness we're
[5:33] looking at in terms of being awake
[5:35] a statement we looked at last time and
[5:37] recognizing your day and its message and
[5:39] how people feel
[5:40] the pull of the hour and they feel this
[5:42] excitement it's like fast pray and
[5:44] fast pray and they and they're using
[5:45] these uh these uh
[5:48] this herald of his coming to try to get
[5:50] the people we should be urgent and we
[5:51] should
[5:52] be expecting and we should be waiting
[5:53] and brother bam says they they feel the
[5:55] pull of the hour because they're
[5:56] christians
[5:57] but they've missed something he says
[5:59] they have not recognized the awakening
[6:01] of the bride
[6:02] and so i want to look at today hopefully
[6:04] we'll get to it what wakes her up
[6:07] if he says they haven't recognized the
[6:08] awakening of the bride that tells us
[6:10] that there has been
[6:12] a supernatural event that is to wake her
[6:15] up
[6:16] if he says that he doesn't look at it
[6:18] they haven't recognized that it's going
[6:19] to happen he said that
[6:20] what god has sent to wake her up has
[6:23] come and they haven't recognized it
[6:24] because they're still praying for an
[6:25] awakening
[6:26] in other words no matter how much
[6:28] exuberance they may exhibit they're
[6:30] still not awake
[6:31] and so there's something that wakes us
[6:33] up and then we're actually asking
[6:35] ourselves the question are we fully
[6:36] awake
[6:37] have it fully dawned on us what god is
[6:39] doing have we become
[6:40] have we've been made aware of the things
[6:42] that god is accomplishing in this hour
[6:44] we looked at first corinthians chapter
[6:46] 15 verse 34 he says awake to
[6:48] righteousness and sin
[6:49] not for some have not the knowledge of
[6:52] god
[6:53] i speak this to your shame so be
[6:56] asleep or being unaware there is a shame
[6:59] involved with it i want us to remember
[7:01] that in the outset
[7:02] but he's telling us to wait to become
[7:04] fully aware wake up
[7:05] to righteousness to things as they are
[7:07] to things as god would desire them to be
[7:10] and it's in that awakening that keeps us
[7:12] from sin
[7:14] he says awake to righteousness and sin
[7:16] not it's through that being awakened and
[7:18] fully alert and aware
[7:19] that we're able to overcome the tempter
[7:22] what is
[7:22] to overcome is to recognize the devil in
[7:24] every one of his tricks
[7:26] and so that's part of being alert and
[7:27] part of being a wide awake is you
[7:29] recognize the devil
[7:30] and his tricks and at the same time
[7:31] recognize greater is he that is in you
[7:33] than he that is in the world
[7:35] could we not agree that maybe we could
[7:36] wake up to a greater reality of that
[7:38] revelation
[7:39] that truly greater is he that is in us
[7:42] than he that is in the world
[7:44] so paul uses this to say that to as a
[7:47] call to wake up to come
[7:49] to soberness of mind and then he
[7:51] connects it with some have not the
[7:52] knowledge of god this knowledge they do
[7:54] not have
[7:55] the knowledge of god so these things are
[7:57] closely connected and
[7:58] related now there's a lot of people that
[8:00] will claim that they're happy
[8:02] they'll even live lives that seem to
[8:04] suggest that they're content
[8:07] and they have uh um and they have a life
[8:09] that's full of
[8:10] excitement and enthusiasm but the truth
[8:13] is
[8:14] for most people they are not truly happy
[8:16] they are at best just
[8:17] unaware in other words they don't
[8:20] realize the consequence for sin they're
[8:22] not they don't they're not fully aware
[8:23] that there is going to be an afterlife
[8:26] a lot of people placate themselves and
[8:27] they're convinced well there is nothing
[8:29] there is no judgment to come there is no
[8:31] hell
[8:32] there is no heaven just live your best
[8:34] life now and enjoy it
[8:35] and so in that sense they have been able
[8:37] to lull themselves
[8:38] into a contentment and unhappiness not
[8:41] based upon truth but a lie
[8:44] and there's some that are also happy but
[8:46] not because they are
[8:47] necessarily unaware but they actually
[8:49] are willfully ignorant
[8:50] that they've heard enough they've seen
[8:52] enough they know enough but in order to
[8:54] maintain
[8:54] some sense of peace or stability within
[8:57] their spirits
[8:58] and that they're not troubled they will
[9:00] just ignore the truth and and willfully
[9:02] not want to know
[9:03] and come up with all sorts of excuses to
[9:06] deny truth
[9:07] and what we're what we find is ignorance
[9:10] is not truly bliss
[9:12] nor is ignorant strength those are the
[9:15] things that we looked at last time
[9:17] but for the believer for the bride her
[9:19] joy our joy
[9:20] is found in understanding truth that the
[9:23] the more we know the greater joy that we
[9:25] can have
[9:26] because our joy is inspired by more
[9:28] knowledge of god the more knowledge of
[9:30] god we have the greater
[9:31] happiness we have the more that we know
[9:33] him the the more free we
[9:35] are and that's where we kind of set our
[9:38] our affections and we say lord
[9:39] i want to know more about you and
[9:42] brother israel made a very profound
[9:44] point last night among many
[9:45] many things that he said that i think
[9:47] would have been worth just coming to
[9:48] hear and and i think that we were
[9:50] blessed by but one in particular
[9:52] he was talking about just how much
[9:54] people listen to the news
[9:56] and that that aggravates them and
[9:58] stimulates them and he says people take
[10:00] it to the pulpit
[10:01] and they're actually preaching against
[10:03] cnn behind the message pulpit they're
[10:05] preaching against msnbc and they're
[10:07] preaching against all these liberal news
[10:09] outlets and they're preaching against
[10:10] fake news
[10:11] it's like we have the real news the good
[10:13] news the gospel
[10:14] and we spend all our time preaching
[10:16] against fake news i
[10:18] said that also the believers will hear
[10:20] things on the news and they get agitated
[10:21] and they get all stirred up and that's
[10:23] what they want to talk about did you
[10:24] hear this did you hear that
[10:25] and that's kind of what dominates their
[10:27] conversations and he says pick up a
[10:29] bible man
[10:30] i was like amen to that pick up a bible
[10:34] read the good news and then as you fill
[10:36] your heart and mind with the good news
[10:38] you'll be you'll find yourself a lot
[10:39] happier you want to know why some of us
[10:42] are really really
[10:43] anxious we feed on too many things from
[10:45] the world
[10:47] that increases our anxiety we feed on
[10:49] the news channels we feed on the
[10:50] statistics we feed on the data we feed
[10:52] on the sports
[10:53] we feed on the metrics we're feeding on
[10:54] all these other forums and things
[10:57] and blogs and opportunities in the world
[10:59] and it only feeds the flesh and the
[11:01] flesh cannot produce faith
[11:03] the only thing the outcome of that is
[11:05] fear and we live anxious we live bound
[11:06] down
[11:07] but the more that we know of him the
[11:09] greater joy that we're going to have
[11:12] in luke chapter 22 and verse verses
[11:16] 31 it says in the lord said simon simon
[11:20] satan hath desired to have you that he
[11:22] may sift you
[11:24] as wheat again we're just kind of
[11:26] reviewing in the first several minutes
[11:27] here
[11:29] this was we looked at this from the
[11:31] standpoint that
[11:34] there is this we know there is a truth
[11:36] of the wheat plant
[11:38] where you as the elect as an individual
[11:41] you're identified
[11:42] as the seed we also understand that
[11:44] within the history of the church
[11:46] in the record of the wheat plant they're
[11:47] the bride she is the seed
[11:49] not the shuck but now jesus refers to
[11:52] peter
[11:53] as himself as satan wanting to sift him
[11:56] as wheat so he's looking at him as a
[11:58] wheat plant himself
[12:00] and we as individuals sons and daughters
[12:03] of god
[12:04] we are soul spirit and body and let me
[12:07] say this if you if never pondered this
[12:09] there's a redemption for all three
[12:12] and so when jesus is speaking to peter
[12:14] he's identifying that satan wants to do
[12:16] something to him as an individual
[12:18] because god's going to separate the
[12:19] wheat from the chaff he's going to
[12:21] separate the wheat from the shock
[12:22] in a rapture and he's doing that in a in
[12:25] a spiritual sense
[12:26] in a prophetic way that we see in the
[12:28] end time
[12:29] but now as individuals when satan
[12:31] desires to sift us as wheat
[12:34] there's there's an effort that he tries
[12:36] to make to agitate us to cause us to be
[12:38] in confusion
[12:39] and to cause us to be double-minded and
[12:40] all tore up and all upset
[12:42] and what he's wanting to do is to
[12:44] separate our consciousness
[12:46] from the deity that is on the inside of
[12:48] us
[12:49] that satan would desire to sift peter as
[12:52] wheat and that
[12:53] he'd want to separate peter from his his
[12:55] fleshly enthusiasm and all his zeal
[12:58] and his desire and never come to a birth
[13:01] in his soul where the seed was
[13:03] because she said i prayed for you that
[13:04] when you're converted where is that
[13:05] going to take place
[13:06] in your soul and when that takes place
[13:09] you can strengthen your brethren
[13:11] so he wants to separate our
[13:13] consciousness from the deity that is
[13:14] inside of us
[13:15] and create kind of this dual life where
[13:17] i got this life in my mind and my body
[13:19] but i got
[13:20] this life in my soul and i feed my soul
[13:22] when i come to church and the rest of
[13:24] the time it's my mind and my body in
[13:25] this battle
[13:26] and this is kind of just a retreat for
[13:28] the soul
[13:29] well it's a horrible way to live because
[13:32] you'll find that you spend i think it's
[13:33] less than
[13:34] three percent of your time in church
[13:37] it's been a while since i've done run
[13:39] the math on that it may be less
[13:41] less now but uh we don't spend that much
[13:44] time in church
[13:44] could you imagine if you're only it's
[13:46] only from the soul well it's in my soul
[13:48] that i'm really happy and you're only
[13:49] getting that between the hours of 10 and
[13:51] noon
[13:51] on sunday morning and the rest of the
[13:54] time what are you doing just
[13:55] living body and spirit in the world
[13:57] that's what satan wants to do he wants
[13:59] to separate
[14:00] sift you as wheat and in doing so create
[14:03] this dichotomy or this separation
[14:06] from the soul and the rest of your mind
[14:08] and your body
[14:09] whereas god wants to bring all three
[14:11] into harmony preserve them blameless
[14:15] and and so i want to transition here
[14:19] in and repeat a phrase something similar
[14:21] to what we said last time
[14:22] the bride's joy is found in walk waking
[14:25] up to
[14:26] and walking in the manifested realities
[14:29] of god
[14:30] that's the bride's joy so you being a
[14:32] bride member your joy is found in waking
[14:34] up to
[14:35] the realities of god being fulfilled in
[14:37] your hour and then also walking in these
[14:39] present realities of god
[14:42] i'm not just knowledgeable of them but
[14:44] i'm walking in them that's the bride's
[14:46] joy that's her comfort
[14:48] now i'm going to read this a little bit
[14:49] differently their text i want to read it
[14:51] from mark chapter 14.
[14:54] i'm not sure exactly why i did it this
[14:56] way it just happened that way
[14:58] but in matthew chapter 26 we read about
[15:00] how
[15:01] jesus brings um them to gethsemane
[15:05] and he tells his disciples to sit here
[15:06] and pray while or sit here while i go
[15:08] and pray and he brings a few with him
[15:10] and tells them watch with me my soul is
[15:13] exceeding sorrowful unto death now
[15:15] remember that my soul
[15:16] is exceeding sorrowful even unto death
[15:19] wait here and watch with me this is what
[15:22] he commands his disciples
[15:25] now in mark chapter 14 verses 37 and 38
[15:28] he says he cometh and findeth them
[15:30] sleeping and saith unto peter
[15:33] simon sleepest thou now why is he
[15:35] picking on peter
[15:37] i mean the other guys were asleep just
[15:39] something about peter he kind of he's
[15:40] kind of putting himself up there as a
[15:42] target you see that in the scripture
[15:43] time and time again
[15:45] and so he speaks to the one who would
[15:46] have the most passion the most zeal the
[15:48] one that would seem to be most fervent
[15:50] in spirit
[15:50] about this hour in this time jesus i'll
[15:52] go to death with you and i'm willing to
[15:54] draw my sword and you just let me know
[15:56] who your enemies are and he's telling
[15:57] him hey
[15:58] come with me my heart my heart is
[15:59] exceedingly sorrowful unto death
[16:01] and he says terry here and watch with me
[16:03] which should have been a signal to peter
[16:05] right
[16:06] like if peter's reading into everything
[16:07] jesus is saying like all right we need
[16:09] to draw the swords and we need to get
[16:10] ready to fight
[16:11] like this would have been peter's little
[16:12] wink wink now is the time to sharpen
[16:14] your sword and be ready
[16:16] and and yet they go away and they sit
[16:18] down and they fall asleep he says peter
[16:20] what's going on man
[16:21] could you not just watch one hour
[16:26] could you not just do it for one hour
[16:27] and he says watch you and pray lest you
[16:29] enter in temptation
[16:31] the spirit truly is ready but the flesh
[16:34] is weak
[16:36] now he's identifying them in a in a
[16:38] physical sense but
[16:39] it carries with it a spiritual
[16:41] application for us
[16:42] but here it says he findeth them
[16:44] sleeping now the fact that they're
[16:46] sleeping
[16:47] signals to us now i want us to be able
[16:49] to carry over a type for us in the hour
[16:51] that we're living in
[16:52] where people are spiritually asleep and
[16:54] our temptation is to be lulled to sleep
[16:56] spiritually
[16:58] here they are they come to this garden
[17:00] and he says i'm
[17:01] i'm so sorrowful and to death and that
[17:03] ought to have been like
[17:04] whoa they ought to give them them an
[17:06] adrenaline rush right that might have
[17:08] been like
[17:09] who brought the five-hour energies
[17:10] where's judas when you need them
[17:12] and and like we need to stay awake i
[17:14] mean this is real
[17:16] but instead they he he goes and he
[17:18] begins to pray and they fall asleep so
[17:20] when the bible tells us that they were
[17:22] sleeping
[17:23] they had not really caught the urgency
[17:25] of the moment
[17:26] in what it required that it's it's when
[17:31] and we've we've experienced this in a
[17:33] fleshly sense
[17:34] that when something happens and we could
[17:36] be really really tired we can be weak
[17:38] and we could even be sore
[17:40] but something happens and it causes an
[17:43] adrenaline rush
[17:44] and just by virtue of understanding the
[17:47] situation
[17:48] we get all excited in our flesh we're
[17:50] like whoa
[17:51] okay we need to do something and we need
[17:53] to do that and we need to move this and
[17:55] we need
[17:55] and you take this uh take this and move
[17:58] it here and you start doing things that
[17:59] you might have physically been
[18:00] unable to do you find that all your
[18:02] sleepiness goes away
[18:04] right you're laying there you're just
[18:05] getting ready to fall asleep and also in
[18:07] your spouse
[18:07] ask you a question you're like what i
[18:10] never thought about that
[18:11] what are we gonna do and you can't go
[18:13] back to bed all it took was something
[18:16] to get in your spirit and your spirit
[18:19] all sudden triggers something in your
[18:20] body says
[18:21] wake up buddy no time for sleep you need
[18:23] to figure this problem out
[18:25] and and and so this is in that way this
[18:28] is a moment when that would have made
[18:29] sense
[18:31] that jesus says something that pricks
[18:33] them in their hearts and it gives them
[18:34] this sense of
[18:35] urgency and it causes them this
[18:38] readiness and this attentiveness and to
[18:40] just watch
[18:41] for a little while so this is the type
[18:43] i'm wanting us to catch
[18:45] that they had not caught the urgency of
[18:48] the hour
[18:48] and what the hour required what the
[18:50] response was required
[18:52] and it was it was represented them
[18:54] physically sleeping
[18:56] and so he says watch he tells him to
[18:58] watch which means to be vigilant to be
[19:00] attentive
[19:01] in other words wake up and pay attention
[19:05] i my soul is exceedingly sorrowful into
[19:07] death wake up
[19:08] and pay attention wake up and even
[19:12] desire
[19:12] he says he went on a little bit further
[19:14] but we know that they were not going to
[19:16] be able to stop those that were coming
[19:18] and he didn't desire that they would
[19:19] draw the swords
[19:20] to defend him but he wanted them to be
[19:22] alert maybe even to hear what he was
[19:24] saying
[19:25] to catch what he was praying and so it
[19:28] means to wake up pay attention to be
[19:30] cautious and aware
[19:32] tell them saying hey watch with me watch
[19:35] and pray
[19:35] comes and finds them asleep the bible
[19:37] says because their eyes were heavy
[19:38] so there had not been a stimulation to
[19:42] do the things that christ had asked them
[19:43] to do
[19:45] the word watch as we mentioned before
[19:46] comes from the root to raise up
[19:49] and it means it's used to mean to
[19:50] recover from senses that are
[19:52] disoriented or to rise from slumber to
[19:55] take senses
[19:56] that are dulled and freshen them up
[19:57] throw some water on your face
[19:59] get get pay it to get it to get to
[20:01] attention here and observe what's
[20:03] happening be alert
[20:04] be cautious and he makes this statement
[20:06] and i realize that this is worth a lot
[20:08] more attention than i'm going to give it
[20:09] this morning but he says
[20:10] the spirit truly is ready but the flesh
[20:13] is weak
[20:14] he says the indeed the spirit is willing
[20:15] but the flesh is weak in matthew but he
[20:17] says the
[20:18] spirit truly is ready but the flesh is
[20:21] weak
[20:22] the spirit was eager peter even
[20:25] expressed often just how
[20:26] willing he was there was a to some
[20:28] degree an inflamed passion
[20:30] within peter's spirit to i'll go to
[20:33] death with you
[20:34] and i'll draw the sword for you and i'll
[20:36] never deny you
[20:38] this was what was in peter's uh peter's
[20:41] spirit as it was but he says your nature
[20:44] is weak
[20:45] and then reading it i found that this
[20:48] was such a
[20:49] a tender rebuke of the disciples
[20:52] that he does not berate them to say you
[20:54] guys are dull and you're senseless and
[20:56] you've got no
[20:57] discernment whatsoever and i might as
[21:00] well go find another group of people who
[21:01] know how to follow this message
[21:03] because you guys are nothing but a
[21:05] sleeping uh dumbos and you guys are
[21:07] worthless and i'm just preaching to a
[21:09] bunch of make-believers at best and you
[21:10] pretty much are all not
[21:12] unbelievers no he said you know what he
[21:14] uses this phrase and it's such a gentle
[21:16] rebuke
[21:17] he says the spirit truly is ready
[21:20] you you are really your spirits he
[21:22] commands even their spirits you're
[21:24] really in your spirits you're ready but
[21:26] your nature is weak there's still
[21:28] something that's lacking
[21:30] you mean well you have sincere
[21:32] intentions
[21:34] but you're not really fully aware of
[21:36] what's taking place because
[21:38] you're unable to cross that threshold to
[21:40] where then
[21:41] you can overcome the sleepiness of your
[21:43] flesh because it says their eyes were
[21:44] heavy
[21:46] uh you know this is the point where some
[21:48] of you can say amen
[21:50] i know exactly what you mean brother
[21:53] aaron
[21:54] i was on the platform one time at
[21:56] louisiana youth camp they do the sunrise
[21:57] service on easter morning
[21:59] so they get the kids up brother russell
[22:01] would go yodeling through the camp
[22:02] wake everybody up and everybody would
[22:05] still be bandaged and scarred from all
[22:07] his activities the day before so you'd
[22:08] be really really sore and
[22:10] feeling somewhat manipulated and abused
[22:11] by his antics
[22:13] and then he's gonna wake you up that
[22:14] pouring salt on the wound on a sunday
[22:16] morning at four o'clock or whatever it
[22:18] was
[22:19] and you all come pile into church at six
[22:21] o'clock in the morning i've sat on the
[22:22] platform for that and you would be
[22:24] absolutely amazed at how contorted faces
[22:28] can become when they're trying to stay
[22:29] awake
[22:30] at that at that time in the morning it
[22:33] was really i have some
[22:34] i wish i could remember the names of
[22:36] these people and i could just go back to
[22:38] them later and say do you know you can
[22:39] make a face that looks somewhat like
[22:40] this
[22:41] because they were straining and so in
[22:44] that way we can relate to heavy eyes
[22:46] amen
[22:46] right even right now it's kind of warm
[22:48] in here we're all getting sleepy
[22:51] and so jesus is being somewhat sensitive
[22:54] to their situation
[22:55] but in our type for us though we might
[22:58] have heavy eyes right now and be a
[23:00] little bit uncomfortable now
[23:01] where what we're going to gather from
[23:03] this is not the sense that oh
[23:04] i get tired during the day and i have to
[23:07] take this to
[23:08] to make it through the day and i need
[23:09] all this coffee to keep myself going
[23:10] it's more of a spiritual alertness
[23:14] that to some degree some of us are
[23:16] willing and we're desirable and we give
[23:18] certain
[23:19] uh affirmations and confessions about
[23:21] truth but are we
[23:22] are we fully awake are we to the point
[23:26] to where yes
[23:27] we have a willingness in part but are we
[23:29] fully willing
[23:30] are we fully aware for them that there
[23:32] was a part of them that was passionate
[23:34] but their nature was weak because they
[23:36] could not all in
[23:38] soul spirit and body be attentive for
[23:40] the moment
[23:41] and ready to do what the moment required
[23:45] they were not fully aware of the
[23:47] situation my soul is exceeding sorrowful
[23:49] what it required what he was
[23:50] asking them to do he says watch and pray
[23:53] and he says watch and pray watchfulness
[23:56] implies wakefulness
[23:58] and for us i want you to take that
[24:00] spiritual alertness
[24:01] to be wide awake now it's obvious
[24:04] if i told you this morning that if
[24:06] you're asleep physically asleep you
[24:08] won't hear what i'm saying could we just
[24:09] get a real hearty amen to that
[24:12] so when we talk about being wide awake
[24:13] it's not it's not church order where
[24:16] you're being disciplined and chastised
[24:17] because we caught some of you sleeping
[24:19] in church
[24:20] and you better watch out because we
[24:21] won't let you back in the next time if
[24:22] you slept the service before
[24:24] it has to do it's a given that if you're
[24:26] asleep you probably won't hear what i'm
[24:28] preaching
[24:29] but you can be wide awake physically
[24:33] but a little bit dulled spiritually and
[24:35] still not pick up with the preachers
[24:37] laying down
[24:38] is that true even to the point where the
[24:41] preacher could be laying down things
[24:42] that aren't even right
[24:44] and when you're not fully awake you're
[24:45] like man that was a really good service
[24:46] wasn't it
[24:48] what did he preach well he preached
[24:49] there's six gods but if you do the math
[24:53] and you don't even realize well that
[24:54] doesn't make sense that's that's not
[24:55] even scriptural
[24:56] and man was that not deep that was so
[24:58] deep that was amazing
[25:00] hey are you really awake are you
[25:03] catching what's being said do you
[25:04] realize
[25:05] how inconsistent it may be with
[25:06] scripture how if you're wide awake maybe
[25:09] even your conscience would be like hey
[25:10] buddy
[25:11] that's not right that's not lining up
[25:14] and so for us it is a spiritual to be
[25:16] spiritually
[25:17] wide awake in luke chapter 21 and i'd
[25:20] like to
[25:22] run through several scriptures here
[25:26] that touch on a a prophecy or subject in
[25:29] the scripture
[25:30] and instead of try instead of taking
[25:32] these particular scriptures
[25:34] and wanting to place them within the
[25:36] context of the hour that we're living in
[25:37] or give uh maybe substantiate the
[25:40] interpretation of the message
[25:42] i want to just kind of catch a theme
[25:44] that's identified in these
[25:46] as it relates to the subject because
[25:48] we're talking about being wide awake
[25:49] so he says in luke chapter 21 verses 34
[25:52] to 36 jesus speaking and take heed to
[25:54] yourselves so this is a
[25:55] take heed pay attention notice listen
[25:58] any time your hearts be overcharged with
[26:00] surfeiting
[26:02] and drunkenness and cares of this life
[26:04] and so that that
[26:06] day come upon you unawares so this is a
[26:10] caution to be sure that you're in a
[26:12] particular condition and state of mind
[26:14] that this day of trouble that was going
[26:16] to come to jerusalem would not catch
[26:17] them off guard
[26:19] so as far as the snare shall it come on
[26:21] all them that dwell on the face of the
[26:23] whole earth
[26:25] watch ye therefore and pray always
[26:31] that ye may be counted accounted worthy
[26:34] to escape
[26:34] all these things that shall come to pass
[26:37] now just prior to this he's speaking
[26:40] what many believe to be and what brother
[26:42] branham even identifies as the
[26:43] desolation of jerusalem where titus
[26:45] comes
[26:46] and he besieges jerusalem and many many
[26:49] though
[26:49] many people in jerusalem thousands of
[26:51] people lost their lives it's very very
[26:52] horrible siege
[26:53] but the testimony is that not one
[26:55] christian was caught in jerusalem
[26:58] not one believer in the prophecy of
[27:00] jesus the things that jesus christ was
[27:01] caught in there because they paid
[27:03] attention to the prophecy and they
[27:04] recognized the signs and they fled just
[27:06] in time
[27:08] and so there is a principle that's being
[27:10] expressed here that if you want to take
[27:11] it and
[27:12] and apply it to what happened there in
[27:14] 70 something a.d
[27:16] and we can say well that absolutely came
[27:18] to pass the word was fulfilled but now
[27:19] we could take a principle
[27:21] and if we applied this to a future
[27:22] revealing of jesus christ
[27:24] how that you if you're not aware that
[27:26] day can take you
[27:28] because any time god sends a message if
[27:30] it's not received what follows
[27:32] judgment and so you can take this
[27:35] principle and apply it to any prophecy
[27:37] really
[27:38] that if god sends a message if you don't
[27:40] recognize the day that day and its
[27:42] message
[27:43] then you're left to suffer the
[27:44] consequences for not heeding to
[27:46] what the message carried and so this
[27:49] would apply
[27:50] in every age when a message came so he
[27:52] says you should ought to be aware
[27:54] your uh take heed to not let your heart
[27:57] be overcharged
[27:58] for as a snare a trap that someone is
[28:00] not aware of it's going to come upon
[28:01] everyone
[28:02] that is on the face of the earth watch
[28:04] ye therefore pray always
[28:05] that you may be accounted worthy to
[28:07] escape all these things that shall come
[28:09] to pass and i love this phrase hopefully
[28:11] we'll get to it
[28:12] in a little bit and to stand before the
[28:14] son of man
[28:16] this this carries with it some very
[28:18] tremendous meaning
[28:19] to stand before the son of man so if you
[28:22] take heed that your hearts not be
[28:24] overcharged
[28:26] so that that day does not catch you by
[28:28] surprise then you're going to be counted
[28:29] worthy to have this audience this
[28:31] position and this standing with the son
[28:33] of man
[28:34] come on somebody that's good stuff
[28:37] i like that so now let's just look at
[28:40] some of these words so you can just see
[28:42] what jesus is dealing with it says
[28:44] take heed lest at any time your hearts
[28:46] be overcharged that means to be made
[28:48] heavy
[28:50] and and the idea that it carries if your
[28:52] hearts are overcharged
[28:54] it carries and also with the words that
[28:55] are used next are fitting and
[28:57] drunkenness it carries with the idea of
[29:00] drinking or eating too much
[29:02] and then inducing a stupor have you ever
[29:05] eaten so much
[29:07] that you're tired that's not all amen so
[29:10] loud i
[29:11] start to feel like that's the only thing
[29:13] you guys get is when we use
[29:15] eating but you know there's a little bit
[29:17] of a myth there's a tryptophan or
[29:19] whatever they say is in turkey well
[29:20] really there's no more in that than
[29:21] there is in chicken
[29:23] the reason why you get so sleepy on
[29:24] thanksgiving is you eat way
[29:26] too much that's why you get sleepy
[29:30] and this is exactly what jesus is
[29:32] referring to the way that someone can
[29:34] eat too much
[29:34] that causes all the senses to come like
[29:36] you know my body is like busy digesting
[29:38] 12 pounds of turkey
[29:40] right now so i'm not really with you
[29:43] it's because the body is diverting
[29:44] energy and resources somewhere else
[29:46] or you could drink too much and you find
[29:48] that it also causes the same thing and
[29:50] especially if it's
[29:51] an intoxicating beverage it does
[29:53] something to your senses so to be
[29:55] overcharged it speaks of an excess
[29:57] load being brought on our senses
[30:00] that so much stimulation in the flesh
[30:02] loads our rational senses
[30:04] loads are our awareness and this is what
[30:06] jesus is talking about
[30:08] in the sense that if you eat too much
[30:09] drink too much fill your flesh too much
[30:11] it's going to overload your rational
[30:13] senses to recognize what's taking place
[30:15] and see what's happening around you so
[30:18] talk about our minds being burdened to
[30:20] the point where it's dulled
[30:21] and it stupefies our our senses our
[30:25] conscience
[30:28] to be made heavy is what it means sleepy
[30:32] jesus is dealing with being made
[30:33] unexpected and unaware
[30:35] due to surf fitting drunkenness and
[30:37] cares of this life
[30:39] surf fitting it it has nothing to do
[30:41] with actual surfing
[30:43] surf fitting has to do with a heaviness
[30:45] or a dizziness
[30:47] uh uh occur i'm trying to think of some
[30:48] of the words that i found that were
[30:50] synonymous with it in
[30:51] study in the in the in the greek that
[30:54] kind of like a carousing there was a
[30:56] an idea of this heaviness in this
[30:58] dizziness that would transpire
[31:00] kind of like a hangover is way they
[31:01] would refer to it
[31:03] and then a drunkenness you can see where
[31:05] these two
[31:06] are somewhat related there's this
[31:07] heaviness this dizziness from this over
[31:10] stimulation this overburdening of the
[31:12] senses
[31:12] and then this drunkenness when it speaks
[31:14] of drunkenness no question this could
[31:16] relate to drinking something
[31:18] that uh causes one to be drunk in their
[31:21] uh they're
[31:21] driving while under the influence
[31:23] they're driving while intoxicated
[31:25] they're operating while under the
[31:26] influence of some other substance
[31:28] but it really is pointing to the
[31:30] inability
[31:31] to reflect or observe something maturely
[31:34] when someone is drunken they can't look
[31:36] at something and make the proper
[31:38] assessment
[31:39] because they have something else that's
[31:41] overwhelming their senses and they may
[31:42] not be able to perceive
[31:44] accurately the situation at hand yeah i
[31:47] think i could jump across that
[31:49] right and people do and they fall way
[31:51] short and it becomes a very viral video
[31:54] and maybe the loss of life because
[31:56] someone's judgment is impaired
[31:58] through this drunkenness and then it
[32:01] says not only surf fitting which is this
[32:03] heaviness this
[32:04] hangover this drunkenness but it says
[32:07] cares of this life
[32:08] there's a lot that could be said in this
[32:10] but it speaks of how that the anxieties
[32:13] about temporal things about natural
[32:15] things and
[32:16] our inordinate pursuit of them because
[32:19] the bible jesus deals with it elsewhere
[32:21] we could realize that when he refers to
[32:22] the cares of this life
[32:24] he's not just saying well you know we
[32:25] have this we have these needs we have to
[32:27] meet
[32:27] but pursuing them above all so our worry
[32:31] about them and our pursuit of them
[32:33] above all deadens our spiritual
[32:36] awareness
[32:37] and and weighs down in our spiritual
[32:39] senses because we're two
[32:41] too uh too
[32:44] bound by and distracted by being nervous
[32:47] and anxious to be under spiritual
[32:49] anticipation and expectation
[32:51] we're too worried being afraid to be
[32:54] happy to expecting we're too worried
[32:57] about bad things coming
[32:58] than being happy about good things
[33:00] coming so you say it's the cares of this
[33:02] life that have this ability
[33:04] to to to bow down and weigh upon a
[33:06] person in addition to the surf fitting
[33:08] the drunkenness and the cares of this
[33:09] life
[33:10] and i found where a very early early
[33:13] commentator
[33:14] uh and it was it i think even the
[33:16] original i found it in the greek they
[33:17] wrote
[33:18] it was in greek and then translated that
[33:20] it was the it's the hangover of
[33:21] yesterday
[33:22] the intoxication of today and the worry
[33:25] of tomorrow
[33:27] the surfing the drunkenness and the
[33:29] cares of this life he's actually been
[33:31] able to take things that
[33:32] have to do with relate to memory things
[33:34] that have to do with observation
[33:36] and things that have to do with
[33:37] imagination and he's taking all these
[33:39] different things that would be past
[33:40] present and future
[33:41] and saying you're allowing all these
[33:43] different things to overwhelm you and to
[33:45] burden you inordinately
[33:46] so that you're not really going to
[33:48] recognize the word of god when it's
[33:49] being fulfilled
[33:51] this is very very good teaching that
[33:52] jesus is laying down
[33:54] and how it kind of deals with the whole
[33:55] idea how we can less past
[33:57] present and future stupefy our senses
[34:00] and make the mind dull
[34:01] and heavy and in doing so we're unfit
[34:04] for the spiritual service that we're
[34:06] called to
[34:07] yes we're called to it yes we may be
[34:09] gifted in it yes there
[34:11] there's a calling you are the elect of
[34:12] god god has a place for you
[34:14] he has a position for you he has a
[34:16] purpose for you but we let the sorrow of
[34:18] the past
[34:19] we let the drunkenness of the day we let
[34:22] the worry of the future
[34:23] get us off center and we start acting
[34:26] and doing things that are not reflective
[34:28] of the real nature and calling that's in
[34:30] our lives
[34:32] so he says watch watch ye therefore
[34:36] why to not be snared
[34:41] watch so that you're not snared
[34:44] be aware be watchful i i i jesus is
[34:46] saying i've signaled
[34:48] i'm signaling something to you just as
[34:49] he did in the garden hey my soul is
[34:51] exceedingly sorrowful would you watch
[34:53] signal okay think about this guys
[34:56] has he ever said something like this
[34:58] before think about everything that's
[34:59] transpired to this point
[35:02] and there ought to have been some
[35:03] sensitivity and awareness
[35:05] and he even comes to the spot where he
[35:07] says sleep on now and take your rest
[35:10] can you imagine that he finally just
[35:12] says sleep on now and take your ass
[35:14] behold the hours at hand and the son of
[35:17] man is betrayed
[35:18] into the hands of sinners rise let us be
[35:22] going behold he is at hand that doth
[35:23] betray me
[35:25] they had completely missed what was
[35:26] happening
[35:28] and as he's expressing here that they
[35:30] ought to watch he therefore to what
[35:32] to not be snared in other words be aware
[35:34] and be looking
[35:36] and know what to look for
[35:40] be re recognize the moment in the time
[35:42] that you're living in and know what to
[35:44] look for
[35:45] brother brennan makes this statement a
[35:46] feast of the trumpets i share this kind
[35:48] of just to wet your whistle a little bit
[35:51] and get you to ponder these things that
[35:52] are in the message he says we've got to
[35:54] come to a place again
[35:55] to something that's going to introduce
[35:57] the messiah
[36:00] so we've got we've got to come to a
[36:02] place to something that's going to
[36:03] introduce the messiah
[36:04] and how will the people that's believing
[36:07] him
[36:08] know it unless they're constantly in the
[36:11] word to know what he is
[36:13] if there's going to be a message come to
[36:16] introduce the messiah
[36:17] how are you even going to know who the
[36:19] messiah is
[36:21] unless you're in the word to know what
[36:23] he looks like
[36:24] there has to be some sort of spiritual
[36:26] awareness and sensitivity
[36:28] that transpires within the heart of
[36:30] somebody to say i know there's a message
[36:32] that's to introduce him
[36:34] and i'm in the word that's going to make
[36:36] me know who he is
[36:37] so that when he makes himself known i'll
[36:39] recognize him
[36:42] and he refers to daniel 13 the wise
[36:44] shall know but the foolish the unwise
[36:47] wouldn't know they wise shall know their
[36:50] god
[36:51] the bible says the wise shall know and
[36:52] understand when these books are open and
[36:55] these things are revealed at the end
[36:56] time
[36:56] the wise shall know and understand but
[36:59] the unwise and the foolish they won't
[37:00] get it
[37:02] which is the wise will they will know
[37:04] their god
[37:06] so there is going to come we're going to
[37:07] come to a place where there's something
[37:09] that's going to introduce christ but how
[37:11] are the people who are believing him
[37:14] going to know unless they're constantly
[37:16] in the word to know what he is
[37:18] and these are my words now how are they
[37:19] going to know unless they are in the
[37:21] word
[37:22] and awake and aware and the word is
[37:24] quickening them to be able to watch
[37:26] and see
[37:30] so as he expresses it in luke chapter 21
[37:33] watch you therefore
[37:35] he says it he says that he give given
[37:37] them a very similar
[37:39] command in mark chapter 13 verses 32 to
[37:41] 37
[37:43] but of that day and that hour knoweth no
[37:45] man no not the angels which are in
[37:46] heaven neither the son
[37:48] but the father now
[37:52] i i really did just want to read through
[37:55] these things
[37:57] uh so that we could just place them in
[37:59] the context
[38:01] of or just use this thing to take heed
[38:04] but now we realize he's talking about a
[38:06] time in a moment that no man knows
[38:08] except not even the son but the father
[38:10] it's the mystery of god a mystery of the
[38:12] father but then he says this
[38:14] take ye heed watch and pray
[38:17] because the statement nobody knows
[38:20] can carry with it a particular influence
[38:24] and he does not want the knowledge that
[38:26] nobody knows the hour
[38:27] the day or the hour not the angels in
[38:30] heaven nor the son but only god knows
[38:32] that could create a certain response so
[38:34] before we're even given a chance he says
[38:37] take ye heed watch
[38:38] and pray for you know not when the time
[38:40] is
[38:41] for the son of man is a as a man taking
[38:44] a far journey who left his house and
[38:46] gave authority to his servants
[38:47] and to every man his work and commanded
[38:49] the porter to
[38:50] watch watch ye therefore for you know
[38:54] not when the master of the house cometh
[38:56] at even or at midnight or at the
[38:58] crowing or in the
[39:00] morning now it if we took it very
[39:03] literal to say
[39:05] in that literal senses he's given this
[39:07] the parable or this analogy
[39:08] of a man a master of a house going on a
[39:11] journey and then them not knowing when
[39:12] they come back and he's saying that
[39:14] watch he therefore because you don't
[39:16] know when he comes at even midnight or
[39:17] in the crowing or in the morning
[39:19] that you never sleep because you don't
[39:21] know when he's coming
[39:22] that wouldn't make sense in a physical
[39:26] scenario like the master's gone while
[39:28] he's gone just you better be hopping
[39:30] yourself up on goofballs because you
[39:31] never know when he's returning
[39:32] and so you just have to stimulate
[39:34] stimulate stimulate and never sleep
[39:35] until finally
[39:36] you know the the master comes back and
[39:38] you just crash
[39:40] that's not what that wouldn't make sense
[39:42] in the physical sense but he uses that
[39:44] analogy to kind of
[39:45] heighten their awareness oh yeah this is
[39:46] like a master leaving and you better be
[39:47] ready because you don't know when he's
[39:48] returning so everyone ought to be at
[39:50] their position doing what they're
[39:51] supposed to do
[39:52] and now here's the spiritual call to
[39:54] action for us lest coming
[39:56] suddenly he finds you sleeping not doing
[39:59] what you're supposed to be doing
[40:01] if your job was something that was to be
[40:03] done when the was crowned you
[40:04] better be doing it
[40:05] if your job was the porter to watch
[40:06] throughout the night at midnight you
[40:08] better be doing it whatever your job was
[40:09] you better
[40:10] better be at duty so he's less coming
[40:12] suddenly
[40:13] he finds you sleeping and what i say
[40:16] unto you
[40:17] i say unto all watch
[40:20] so his he is sharing these things and
[40:23] expressing these things
[40:25] so that we would be watchful
[40:29] he says in matthew chapter 25 verse 13.
[40:32] and again this is another example after
[40:35] he's even
[40:36] given the parable the wise and foolish
[40:38] virgin
[40:39] and he's he's now this is just a
[40:43] and we see that these are those are
[40:44] events that transpire
[40:46] in the the time that we're living watch
[40:49] therefore
[40:50] for you know neither the day nor the
[40:52] hour wherein the son of man
[40:54] cometh so in each one of these instances
[40:57] he's talking about
[40:58] a fulfillment of prophecy that
[41:01] cannot be placed upon a calendar right
[41:05] that you a man has not marked it and
[41:07] said look
[41:08] we know the master's coming on this day
[41:11] so we have all this time to do what we
[41:14] want to do
[41:15] and then it's at this moment that we
[41:17] ought to get everything into shape and
[41:18] do our chores and make things look like
[41:19] he wants it to be
[41:21] right has anybody ever done that when
[41:22] your parents are going to be gone look
[41:24] we'll be back at 11 o'clock when we get
[41:25] back you better make sure you have these
[41:27] things done
[41:27] and so you kind of run the math hey
[41:29] we've got three hours to do whatever we
[41:31] want because it's going to take us about
[41:32] 30 minutes to get this done
[41:34] and in doing so it kind of creates this
[41:37] idea of
[41:38] live however you want do whatever you
[41:39] want and then right before the time when
[41:41] it's going to happen that's when we're
[41:42] going to get everything
[41:44] in in in shape and in order and so
[41:48] this is what i found remarkable as i
[41:49] pondered this last week
[41:52] the takeaway from these statements that
[41:55] no man knows the
[41:56] hour nor the day watch ye therefore for
[41:59] ye neither know the day nor the hour and
[42:01] the son of man coming
[42:02] this takeaway shouldn't be well i guess
[42:04] we'll never know
[42:06] that shouldn't be our takeaway our
[42:09] takeaway from this is
[42:10] i'd rather i better be awake
[42:13] that that's what's the most important
[42:15] thing to take away from this is not this
[42:17] idea well you don't know when it's going
[42:18] to happen you really don't want it's
[42:19] going to happen
[42:20] because really you could keep using that
[42:21] phrase even after it happens
[42:24] right if somebody gets the idea well
[42:26] you'll never know you just never know
[42:28] you'll never know when the master's
[42:29] gonna return you never know when the
[42:30] master's gonna turn well did you know
[42:31] he's coming back today
[42:32] you don't know that how do you know he's
[42:35] here how do you know he's soon coming
[42:37] you don't know that you don't know the
[42:38] day or the hour
[42:38] and there could be it can even be used
[42:40] to kind of create this idea well i guess
[42:42] we'll never
[42:42] know but that's not the response that
[42:45] christ wanted us to have
[42:46] he is very explicit about what the
[42:48] response is you don't know the day of
[42:50] the hour so you better be awake
[42:52] you better be watching you better be
[42:53] expecting be wide awake so that if it
[42:56] does happen you'll see it and you'll
[42:57] know it
[42:59] it's almost as if the common response to
[43:01] this is to be lulled to sleep instead of
[43:03] waking up
[43:05] i'm going to make all of you yawn right
[43:06] now yeah nobody knows the day of the
[43:09] hour
[43:09] so i'm just going gonna take my nap
[43:12] whenever it should be i don't know when
[43:14] it's gonna be so i want to be ready
[43:16] i want to be looking i want to be
[43:17] watching i want to be i want to be under
[43:19] expectation
[43:20] now let's watch the these other
[43:23] scriptures as they can begin to come and
[43:25] view
[43:25] and how it really is trying to sensitize
[43:27] us to being wide awake
[43:29] it says in second peter chapter 3 verse
[43:31] 10 but the day of the lord will come
[43:33] as a thief in the night
[43:36] now this is we can see how much this
[43:39] harmonizes with the idea that no man's
[43:41] no man knoweth the day
[43:43] or the hour because a thief doesn't send
[43:45] you a text message and say hey
[43:47] i should be arriving tomorrow night
[43:49] between the hours of 11 and midnight
[43:51] right the the appliance repair guy gives
[43:53] us a
[43:54] heads up and says hey we're coming
[43:55] between nine and eleven o'clock in the
[43:57] morning so that you're ready to receive
[43:58] him
[43:59] well for whatever reason garage these
[44:01] car thieves you know petty
[44:03] thief don't let us know ahead of time
[44:05] because otherwise we kind of leave
[44:06] something out worth it right like look i
[44:08] don't have much you break into my house
[44:10] you're not walking off with the tv
[44:12] they come into my house like what what
[44:13] do we want is it we're in amish hoa here
[44:16] what is this
[44:18] wouldn't have much to walk out with but
[44:20] um
[44:21] this is it's it's it's harmonizing with
[44:24] this idea of not knowing when when he
[44:26] says
[44:27] the day of the lord will come as a thief
[44:28] in the night now there's a lot of
[44:30] things in this i would love to expound
[44:32] upon but i want to just touch on it very
[44:33] quickly
[44:34] a thief comes secretly and all the
[44:36] thieves said
[44:38] ah you didn't fall for it that was good
[44:40] a thief comes secretly
[44:42] he comes undetected in a way to what
[44:46] even will veil his appearance so that
[44:47] you don't know who it is it's like
[44:49] tom what are you doing in here stealing
[44:51] my tv no he
[44:52] covers his face he covers himself up
[44:55] comes secretly undetected with a purpose
[44:58] looking for something in particular and
[45:01] then
[45:02] afterwards what happens it brings loss
[45:05] after the thief has come he comes
[45:07] secretly undetected with the purpose
[45:09] afterwards there's sorrow and there's
[45:10] lost
[45:11] because something has been taken away
[45:13] something has happened so the day of the
[45:15] lord will come as a thief in the night
[45:17] now
[45:17] kind of keep this in harmony then with
[45:21] the day of the lord coming and watching
[45:23] and being expecting and waiting
[45:24] in revelations chapter 3 verses 2 to 3.
[45:27] watch this principle again
[45:28] be watchful and strengthen the things
[45:31] which remain
[45:32] that are ready to die for i have not
[45:34] found thy works perfect before god
[45:36] remember therefore how thou hast receive
[45:39] how thou hast received and heard and
[45:41] hold fast and repent
[45:43] if therefore thou shalt not watch
[45:46] i will come as thee on thee as a thief
[45:50] and thou shalt not know what hour i will
[45:52] come upon thee
[45:54] now if you read that and you you absorb
[45:57] what's being said
[45:59] he's saying if you don't watch
[46:02] i'll come as a thief and you won't know
[46:04] the hour i come
[46:06] right if you're not watching it's going
[46:09] to happen
[46:10] and you won't know but if you're
[46:12] watching he says
[46:14] i i can't come as a thief if you're
[46:16] watching you will know the hour that i
[46:18] come upon thee
[46:19] so he says he says it verse two be
[46:21] watchful yeah there's some things that
[46:23] aren't right and there's things that are
[46:24] not perfect before me
[46:25] but if you'll if you'll watch and
[46:28] and listen to what you've heard hold
[46:30] fast to them repent
[46:32] grab a hold of the things i've shared
[46:33] with you and take them into your bosom
[46:36] and be faithful to them but if you don't
[46:38] watch
[46:40] there's going to be things happen and
[46:42] i'm going to come secretly undetected
[46:44] with a purpose
[46:45] and i'm going to take i'm going to do
[46:46] what i was asked to do and then i'm
[46:48] going to
[46:48] and i'm going to go and you're going to
[46:50] suffer loss because of it
[46:53] there's the principle now that we add to
[46:55] the thief in the night or not knowing
[46:57] the hour that he comes repeats it in
[47:00] revelations chapter 16 verse 15
[47:03] behold and this how how this beautifully
[47:07] dovetails with revelations chapter 3
[47:08] verse 18 wherein we're told to have i
[47:11] salve
[47:12] that we may see our garments to be a
[47:14] particular way
[47:16] and to buy this gold you see here how
[47:18] this is beautifully
[47:20] connects that we not be ashamed behold i
[47:22] come as a thief
[47:25] so the day of the lord comes as a thief
[47:27] in the night he says i may come on thee
[47:28] as a thief if you're not watching again
[47:30] he says behold i come as a thief
[47:32] now it says catch this blessed is he
[47:34] that watcheth
[47:36] and keepeth his garments so the whole
[47:39] idea of him coming as a thief
[47:41] it has a negative consequence to those
[47:44] who are not
[47:46] awake to those who are not watching
[47:49] so the whole the the takeaway from
[47:51] behold i come as a thief is like look
[47:53] we're never going to know when it
[47:54] happens anyways
[47:56] so we might as well just play church
[47:57] until he does
[47:59] right one day there's going to be a
[48:00] resurrection of the sleeping saints
[48:02] and that's when we're going to get
[48:03] serious about this and that's when i'm
[48:06] going to be sure i'm going to be there
[48:07] i'm going to be there you bet i'm not
[48:08] going to miss it at all with
[48:09] when these meetings start again and when
[48:11] this happens and when that happens i'm
[48:13] going to be there
[48:14] you think so you really think you can
[48:16] just be lolled to sleep to the remainder
[48:18] of laodicea
[48:19] and then all of a sudden when that
[48:20] happens you're like is it did the arm go
[48:23] up is this time
[48:25] it's going to be too late then he says i
[48:28] come as a thief in the night
[48:31] blessed is he that watches and keepeth
[48:34] his garments
[48:36] his watchfulness allows him to abstain
[48:40] his watchfulness allows him to not be
[48:42] tore down to be defiled to be
[48:45] to be uh brought low to become heavier
[48:47] to be overcharged
[48:48] lest he walk naked and they see his
[48:51] shame
[48:54] this is the naked the thy shame that thy
[48:58] nakedness
[48:59] does not appear in revelations 3 18. it
[49:01] says where i see that symmetry of these
[49:03] scriptures
[49:04] behold i come as a thief in the night
[49:05] behold i stand at the door and knock
[49:07] if any man hear my voice
[49:10] there's a he's knocking there's a lot of
[49:12] people that never hear him why they're
[49:13] blind
[49:15] they're deaf they're not awake they
[49:17] can't hear
[49:19] so it is the bible says watch be
[49:21] watchful i'm coming as a thief
[49:23] the point is if you're not wide awake
[49:26] you'll miss it
[49:28] that's the point the point is that you
[49:30] know what we don't know when it's going
[49:31] to happen
[49:32] so let's all sleep
[49:35] if i could say this when we understand
[49:37] the parable of the wise and foolish
[49:38] virgins that's what they did
[49:41] but then there comes a stimulating cry
[49:43] to do what wake
[49:44] the bride up to wake the wise
[49:47] up so if you're going to go in you've
[49:49] got to be awake he's not going to drag
[49:51] you asleep into the wedding supper and
[49:53] like
[49:53] oh what do you know
[49:56] we made it it's not how it's going to
[49:58] work
[50:08] i'm going to keep going here try to do
[50:10] this quickly the message here ye him
[50:12] i i what i'd like to do is just read
[50:14] these if you're pulling hard enough you
[50:15] might just pull me right into
[50:17] much more on these things but i just
[50:18] want to read these statements so you can
[50:20] see
[50:20] how brother brown uses this language of
[50:22] being awake in the urgency of the time
[50:24] we're living in
[50:25] and if the day that we're living in when
[50:27] you see every sign moving pointing
[50:29] towards the coming of the lord
[50:30] it ought to make every minister start
[50:32] fasting and praying and saying god what
[50:34] must i do
[50:35] next if we are near the end time in the
[50:38] third seal and then
[50:39] recognizing your dana's message he kind
[50:40] of brings that same thing up about fast
[50:42] and pray fast and pray fast and pray but
[50:44] what does he say
[50:45] they have they haven't recognized that
[50:46] what they're fasting and praying for has
[50:48] happened
[50:49] so there is a sensitivity that you have
[50:51] for things that are yet unfulfilled
[50:53] to say god what must i do next because
[50:55] this is the urgency in the time of the
[50:56] hour
[50:57] as he uses it here in 57 it's time that
[51:00] we get down we got down
[51:01] and realized we mustn't just lust along
[51:05] and loaf along
[51:06] as if we're the carefree come easy go
[51:09] easy
[51:11] anybody living carefree spiritually
[51:16] it's kind of a nice area but if we're
[51:18] the carefree we
[51:19] ought not to lust along and loaf along
[51:21] as if we're the carefree come easy go
[51:23] easy
[51:24] we should be wide awake
[51:27] and it seems like that such things as
[51:28] today earthquake shaking even plaster
[51:30] dropping off the walls and buildings
[51:32] sending up great smoke and dust greens
[51:34] up like mushrooms and so forth it ought
[51:36] to bring us to the realization that the
[51:37] coming of the lord is at hand
[51:39] and when we see the church of the living
[51:42] god indifferent
[51:44] and infatuated with the world and lost
[51:46] its love of christ
[51:49] these things are applicable today saints
[51:50] these are things that we ought to be
[51:51] very sensitive and aware of and has
[51:53] become
[51:54] so denominational minded doesn't mean
[51:56] you have to be an official inc
[51:57] denominational minded in berries and so
[51:59] forth among us
[52:00] it ought to be milestones to let us
[52:02] realize that we're at the end of the
[52:04] road
[52:05] if this was so in 1957 and it ought to
[52:07] created an urgency
[52:08] what has been fulfilled and transpired
[52:10] for us now today to say
[52:12] this is the present reality of where i'm
[52:14] living and i can't become indifferent
[52:17] i can't become infatuated i can't become
[52:19] denominational minded
[52:20] i can't allow humanistic barriers to
[52:23] rise up to keep me from the word of god
[52:25] and the fellowship with other believers
[52:27] i need to be wide awake
[52:31] it says we should be wide awake not lust
[52:34] along loaf along
[52:36] come easy go easy
[52:40] in the message when their eyes were
[52:41] opened he says what if i had to walk
[52:43] tonight
[52:44] okay so i'm going to ask you to be very
[52:47] like
[52:47] focus very intently right now because
[52:51] what what prompted him to talk about
[52:52] this as well not believing in doctors or
[52:55] medicine or certain medical advancements
[52:57] and things that are available
[52:59] and it says i won't say what i just
[53:02] thought
[53:02] i'll share it maybe at the appropriate
[53:04] time because it's kind of a clever
[53:06] thought on never mind i don't even want
[53:09] to get into it
[53:10] but it says so if he's looking at this
[53:12] well you don't believe in doctors you
[53:13] don't believe in medicine and there's
[53:15] suspicion maybe or
[53:16] or these things that people might try to
[53:18] allege because he
[53:19] uh because he believes in divine healing
[53:21] but catch now
[53:22] pay very very focused be very very
[53:24] focused to pay attention
[53:26] to the the the things he's saying what
[53:28] if i had to walk tonight back home
[53:30] back down home what if i had to walk my
[53:33] home
[53:34] walk to my home about 600 miles away
[53:37] well that would be terrible right what
[53:40] if you had to walk home today
[53:42] we don't have to walk home at the very
[53:45] least we can use
[53:47] uber right or lyft i don't mean to
[53:49] offend anybody i don't know which camp
[53:51] you're in on the lyft uber side
[53:53] has anyone been endorsed by any
[53:54] particular essential oil i mean which
[53:56] camp which ride do we take i don't know
[53:57] what to do
[54:00] we don't have to walk home especially in
[54:01] this heat
[54:03] and this is the point he's trying to
[54:04] make why would you why would i walk home
[54:05] when i don't have to
[54:07] what if i went in an ox cart
[54:10] say why would i even use something maybe
[54:12] i don't have to walk but why would i
[54:14] even use a cart
[54:15] but science has produced an automobile
[54:18] think of this produce science has
[54:20] produced an automobile i thank them for
[54:22] it i'm very glad
[54:23] i accept it what if i had to wash my
[54:25] hands with sand like they used two years
[54:28] ago
[54:30] i didn't really know that they just used
[54:31] sand but i could realize maybe this
[54:33] agitation this is going to cause them to
[54:35] sand in water it's going to be rough
[54:36] it's going to kind of exfoliate there
[54:38] and clean you up he says but science has
[54:40] perfected soap
[54:43] i can clean them much better
[54:46] i like it brother branham's validating
[54:48] maybe some of the new isn't as bad as we
[54:49] make it out to be
[54:52] well then if i have to condemn the
[54:54] doctor i'd have to condemn the soap
[54:56] and have to condemn the automobile and
[54:57] have to condemn all those things
[55:00] now i want you to catch the principle
[55:02] though he's saying at one time i had to
[55:04] walk
[55:05] one time i had to ride an ox cart i had
[55:07] to walk by human propelling myself
[55:09] through human power
[55:10] then i used ox power but now i can use
[55:12] an automobile
[55:14] and then he says we used to wash
[55:15] ourselves one time with sand but now we
[55:17] have soap
[55:19] and so he's talking about this event
[55:20] advancement says so wake up now
[55:23] be wide awake christians look to jesus
[55:26] christ
[55:28] wake up now be real wide awake
[55:31] christians
[55:31] look to jesus christ i want to use it in
[55:33] this way what has god produced today
[55:37] what has god perfected today what has
[55:40] the creator
[55:41] produced for you today and one day this
[55:44] is how they worship
[55:45] in one day this is all they knew at one
[55:48] time this was all they knew they could
[55:50] offer
[55:51] this is all they knew they could amen
[55:53] but what has god done today
[55:55] if you're wide awake you may worship him
[55:57] in the truth of a day gone by
[55:59] but today i can worship him in the light
[56:02] of the full word being revealed
[56:05] because because i'm wake i woke up now
[56:08] i'm wide awake
[56:09] i haven't been lulled to sleep with the
[56:11] theology of a day gone by
[56:12] i haven't been lulled to sleep by a
[56:14] doctor that says all one day it
[56:16] will happen we don't know when we don't
[56:18] know how we don't know why
[56:19] we'll never know but one day it's gonna
[56:22] happen
[56:23] i'm wide awake to see what he's doing
[56:25] today because if i don't see what he's
[56:27] doing now
[56:28] i'll never see what he's doing later and
[56:30] i never really caught what he did before
[56:33] if i'm not fully awake to what he's
[56:35] doing right now i haven't really
[56:37] understood what he has done and i'll
[56:39] never see what he is going to do
[56:44] so watch ye therefore luke chapter 21
[56:46] verse 36 watch ye therefore and pray
[56:48] always
[56:49] that ye may be accounted worthy to
[56:52] escape all these things that shall come
[56:53] to pass
[56:55] watch ye therefore and to stand before
[56:58] the son of man let's talk about
[57:02] the the the language that's being used
[57:03] to stand before the settlement
[57:05] watchy therefore that you may be counted
[57:07] worthy to see
[57:08] the revelation of the son of man with
[57:10] joy and comfort
[57:13] because you're going to be kind of
[57:14] worthy to escape these things to stand
[57:15] before it speaks of a joy that speaks of
[57:17] a comfort
[57:18] to see him come in his word wherein
[57:21] when you see him fulfill his word in
[57:23] that day if they had
[57:25] heeded the prophecy and caught the signs
[57:27] of the time
[57:28] then they experienced a joy of
[57:29] deliverance they experienced the joy of
[57:31] comfort
[57:31] there is no condemnation there is no
[57:34] shame there
[57:34] is no death because i caught the
[57:36] revelation of the hour
[57:38] and in that there's joy and peace
[57:41] he said the snare of drunkenness and
[57:43] sleepiness will come upon all the people
[57:45] but to those who are watching to those
[57:47] who are wide awake
[57:48] they will catch the revelation of jesus
[57:50] christ as it applied in luke chapter 21
[57:53] about the siege of jerusalem
[57:54] it applies to the prophecy of god in
[57:56] this end time
[57:57] that those who are wide awake are going
[58:00] to find joy and comfort
[58:01] in the revealing of jesus christ
[58:06] when the queen of bathsheba the queen of
[58:08] sheba sorry
[58:09] when the queen of sheba went and saw
[58:11] solomon and she describes
[58:13] everything perfectly in order everything
[58:15] happening she says this
[58:16] in first kings chapter 10 verse 8 happy
[58:18] are thy men
[58:20] happy are these thy servants which stand
[58:22] continually before thee
[58:24] and hear thy wisdom
[58:27] this is what the image that is brought
[58:29] up before us watch ye therefore
[58:31] that you'll be able to stand before the
[58:33] son of man happy are the men
[58:35] happy are the women happy is the bride
[58:37] of jesus christ
[58:38] that can stand before him in this hour
[58:41] and hear his voice
[58:42] and know his wisdom why because the wise
[58:44] shall know
[58:45] and understand but the foolish will not
[58:47] understand
[58:49] i'm saying happiness where are we going
[58:50] to find happiness standing
[58:52] before the son of man
[58:55] you get outside of that the like
[58:57] brightness of his countenance you get
[58:58] outside of that you're going to find
[58:59] yourself
[59:00] being very very uncomfortable he said
[59:01] well they they do it and they seem fine
[59:03] and they do it
[59:04] they're never bothered okay who are you
[59:07] anyways
[59:09] who are you what what are you confessing
[59:11] to be what are you made up of what's in
[59:13] your heart your friends could go
[59:15] do things and get away with it and say
[59:17] they're absolutely happy
[59:18] and then you go and do the very same
[59:20] thing thinking it's going to solve all
[59:22] the problems in your life
[59:23] and you find yourself married again or
[59:24] whatever it might be in your heart is
[59:26] totally tore up and like
[59:27] this isn't working for me this doesn't
[59:29] make any sense how did it work for you
[59:30] why did it work for you i don't know but
[59:32] it's the best decision i ever made and
[59:33] you walk away thinking i think this is
[59:34] this
[59:35] worst thing i've ever done in my life
[59:37] she had never moved here should have
[59:38] never done this shouldn't have tried
[59:39] that i shouldn't have done this or
[59:40] shouldn't have
[59:41] pursued this job or pursued that idea
[59:43] why you do it in your mind's thinking
[59:46] i'm trying to find happiness i'm trying
[59:48] to find joy and there's only one thing
[59:50] that's going to satisfy you and that's
[59:51] christ
[59:53] and there's no one else to blame but him
[59:56] he just made you that way
[1:00:01] in malachi chapter 3 verse 2 but who
[1:00:02] shall abide in the day of his coming
[1:00:05] and who shall stand when he appeareth
[1:00:09] for he is like a refiner's fire and the
[1:00:11] fuller soap
[1:00:13] talking about science has perfected soap
[1:00:16] there's going to be a perfecting of
[1:00:18] god's refining there's going to be a
[1:00:20] full
[1:00:21] manifestation of the word of god there's
[1:00:22] going to be a refiner's fire that takes
[1:00:24] the gold and purges it and purifies it
[1:00:26] this is malachi chapter 3
[1:00:27] leading up to the very prophecy behold i
[1:00:29] send you elijah the prophet
[1:00:31] who will abide in the day of his coming
[1:00:32] who shall stand when he appeareth
[1:00:36] there will be those who do stand those
[1:00:38] who are watching those who are wide
[1:00:40] awake
[1:00:41] in isaiah chapter 66 verse 5 hear the
[1:00:43] word of the lord ye that trembled his
[1:00:44] word
[1:00:45] your brethren that hated you that cast
[1:00:47] you out for my name's sake
[1:00:49] said let the lord be glorified but he
[1:00:52] shall appear to your joy and they
[1:00:56] shall be ashamed let the lord manifest
[1:00:59] himself
[1:01:00] and when you see him it'll give you joy
[1:01:02] let the lord reveal himself
[1:01:04] let him fulfill his word let him
[1:01:06] interpret it by bringing it to pass
[1:01:08] he shall appear who shall stand when he
[1:01:10] appears to those to whom he reveals
[1:01:13] himself to
[1:01:14] he appears to your joy
[1:01:17] that this is the this is what we ought
[1:01:19] to be taken away from all of this
[1:01:21] is i want to be wide awake i want to be
[1:01:22] watching because i'm not going to find
[1:01:24] joy and being lulled to sleep
[1:01:26] i'm not going to find joy in taking a
[1:01:28] lao to see a nap i'm not going to find
[1:01:30] joy in pursuing things that sensitize
[1:01:31] this flesh
[1:01:32] i realize that i will never truly be
[1:01:35] happy
[1:01:35] and truly be free until i wake up to the
[1:01:38] horrors of my sin
[1:01:39] repent of my sin seek forgiveness find
[1:01:42] his forgiveness
[1:01:43] and stay in his path of righteousness
[1:01:46] live for him and serve him all the days
[1:01:48] of my life let the lord reveal himself
[1:01:51] and he says he shall appear to your joy
[1:01:53] when he appears you'll find joy and they
[1:01:56] will be ashamed
[1:02:00] the question and answer is on the seals
[1:02:02] i'm having to just go
[1:02:03] a little fast now and not amplify some
[1:02:05] of these things i just think
[1:02:07] i think you can see how these dots are
[1:02:08] connecting i feel that i have just some
[1:02:10] material that i won't be able to get to
[1:02:12] if the lord would inspire it
[1:02:13] there may be just another part on being
[1:02:15] wide awake
[1:02:17] but says he's asked this question and
[1:02:19] question answers on the stills my dear
[1:02:20] brother
[1:02:21] will the malachi 4 5 elijah go to the
[1:02:23] wilderness as first kings 17 tells us
[1:02:26] the other elijah did so this is the
[1:02:28] question he's asked i provided it there
[1:02:29] in green
[1:02:30] in a different font you recognize this
[1:02:31] is the question he says they're trying
[1:02:33] to ask
[1:02:34] will they just be wilderness dwellers
[1:02:36] why they'd have to go to northern
[1:02:38] british columbia to get enough
[1:02:39] wilderness to dwell in now somewhere
[1:02:41] and that's where brother branham often
[1:02:43] went to get away
[1:02:45] he says you see so it'll be someone the
[1:02:47] wilderness is all cut down there's not
[1:02:49] much wilderness left
[1:02:50] it's the only thing they might be a
[1:02:52] lover of the wilderness maybe northern
[1:02:53] bc
[1:02:54] i don't know maybe like to go hunting
[1:02:55] there or bisco
[1:02:58] he said there might be a love of the
[1:02:59] wilderness and stay maybe a lot in the
[1:03:01] wilderness
[1:03:02] you can notice the nature of them that
[1:03:04] is uncompromising
[1:03:05] and you'll know it when it comes you'll
[1:03:08] see it
[1:03:10] if you're wide awake
[1:03:13] now some people can be just awake enough
[1:03:16] to start maybe connecting these ideas
[1:03:18] and these things but he's talking about
[1:03:19] really seeing it
[1:03:20] he says you'll know it when it comes
[1:03:22] you'll see it if
[1:03:24] if you're wide awake and to see
[1:03:27] is to understand not just be able to say
[1:03:31] well brother branham is malachi 4 5 and
[1:03:33] his ministry is the ministry of elijah
[1:03:35] and be able to connect the dots and just
[1:03:37] believe what your mama says or believe
[1:03:38] what the pastor says but when you
[1:03:40] see it you'll only see it because you're
[1:03:42] wide awake
[1:03:44] and i'm not even talking about believe
[1:03:45] it there's a lot of people that believe
[1:03:46] it and then unbelieve it
[1:03:48] there's a lot of people that confess it
[1:03:49] and then disconfess it there's a lot of
[1:03:50] people that follow it but then walk away
[1:03:52] from it
[1:03:52] we're talking about you'll see it if
[1:03:54] you're wide awake and then once you're
[1:03:56] fully wide awake you're like whoa that's
[1:03:58] what i've been believing that's a lot to
[1:03:59] all this time
[1:04:00] there's no going back to sleep
[1:04:02] hallelujah once you're
[1:04:04] awake once you realize the things that
[1:04:06] have happened in this hour
[1:04:07] from that moment on there's no way for
[1:04:09] you to go back
[1:04:12] it's really an impossibility once he
[1:04:13] does it
[1:04:15] then he says in god hiding himself in
[1:04:16] simplicity this symmetry to me is so
[1:04:18] beautiful
[1:04:19] he's already told us this the rapture
[1:04:22] then judgments will strike sin plague
[1:04:25] sickness and everything
[1:04:26] the people will cry for death to take
[1:04:29] them when the judgment
[1:04:30] lord why is this judgment upon us when
[1:04:32] you said that there'd be a rapture first
[1:04:34] he'll say
[1:04:34] it's already come and you didn't know it
[1:04:37] god
[1:04:38] hiding himself in simplicity the rapture
[1:04:40] is going to be so simple
[1:04:42] so hidden like a thief in the night
[1:04:46] and let me say this that doesn't
[1:04:48] necessarily that does not mean
[1:04:50] that the bride's going to be caught
[1:04:52] unawares
[1:04:54] and you're walking you're walking to
[1:04:55] your you're just kind of walking in life
[1:04:58] not believing in much and not really
[1:04:59] knowing much and one day you're just
[1:05:01] kind of going to the refrigerator for a
[1:05:02] late night snack and you go to open the
[1:05:04] door
[1:05:04] and you're walking like what what in the
[1:05:07] world is this
[1:05:08] and you walk into a portal called it's
[1:05:10] the meeting in the air
[1:05:11] now it's not going to happen all of a
[1:05:12] sudden to the bride where she doesn't
[1:05:14] realize what's transpiring in her day
[1:05:16] the fulfillment of the word of god
[1:05:18] there'll be a moment when this sweep
[1:05:19] comes and will be changed in a moment in
[1:05:21] a twinkling of an eye but the bride's
[1:05:23] already walking in the revealed word
[1:05:24] before them
[1:05:27] so he says that it's already happened
[1:05:29] god hiding himself in simplicity it's
[1:05:31] already happened and you knew it not
[1:05:33] why don't believers believe the simple
[1:05:34] signs of his coming
[1:05:36] they're expecting all these things that
[1:05:37] spoke of by the scripture the sun going
[1:05:39] down in the day and there's going to be
[1:05:40] all kinds of things oh
[1:05:42] if we just said i got the notes wrote
[1:05:43] here on it to show what them things are
[1:05:46] and we'll get it on the breaking of
[1:05:47] these seals this week anyhow
[1:05:49] there it is just where it's already past
[1:05:51] and you didn't know it
[1:05:54] see if it is if the angel lord will
[1:05:56] break them seals forth to us
[1:05:58] remember it's sealed with them seven
[1:06:00] mysterious thunders
[1:06:02] there's something he's connecting with
[1:06:03] the rapture the judgments to come
[1:06:06] the simplicity of god and how these
[1:06:07] things are being unfolded connecting it
[1:06:09] with what's contained in these seven
[1:06:10] thunders
[1:06:11] now why can't people believe the simple
[1:06:13] simplicity of a humble bunch of people
[1:06:14] and the voice of the signs of god
[1:06:17] right you are a humble bunch of people
[1:06:20] here's your chance to pat yourself on
[1:06:21] the back
[1:06:22] you are a humble bunch of people this is
[1:06:24] a humble gathering there's humble
[1:06:25] gatherings like this all over the valley
[1:06:26] all over the world
[1:06:27] and when the world looks at it this
[1:06:29] disorganized undenominated bunch
[1:06:31] they call a cult and they say well
[1:06:33] there's just a few in number how could
[1:06:34] this even be a move of god they would
[1:06:36] have never been there in the upper room
[1:06:38] because there was just 120.
[1:06:40] right who are these people
[1:06:43] 120 people you think that's a party you
[1:06:46] think that's a group you think that's a
[1:06:47] church
[1:06:48] it's always small in number right it has
[1:06:51] nothing to do when i say small the
[1:06:52] number i'm not giving you even a number
[1:06:54] what that means
[1:06:55] it's just not so great to the world has
[1:06:57] to take notice and say all right fine
[1:06:59] we don't agree with you but you got
[1:07:00] enough money and you've got enough clout
[1:07:01] you've got enough followers to where
[1:07:02] we'll just acknowledge that you're weird
[1:07:04] and you're crazy and we'll all exist
[1:07:05] together
[1:07:07] we're not in that category there's
[1:07:10] there's nobody in this
[1:07:11] in this faith that's going to be able to
[1:07:12] be a a presidential nominee
[1:07:18] if you get what i'm saying
[1:07:22] why can't they believe it just like it's
[1:07:24] always been the true word of god being
[1:07:26] made manifest
[1:07:27] they're too smart and too educated to
[1:07:29] believe the simple form of the written
[1:07:31] word
[1:07:31] they want to put their own
[1:07:32] interpretation to it it don't mean this
[1:07:35] it don't mean that the prophet it does
[1:07:37] mean that
[1:07:40] listen may i say this right quick now
[1:07:43] even the visions of god gives here at
[1:07:44] the place it's so misunderstood
[1:07:46] that's the reason why you hear on the
[1:07:48] tape say say what the tapes say
[1:07:50] say what the vision's saying last night
[1:07:53] some of the brothers from jerusalem
[1:07:54] were talking about how brother branham
[1:07:55] said from tucson i see i'm still doing
[1:07:58] it now
[1:07:58] they're from tucson from jerusalem
[1:08:00] tabernacle and said brother braham said
[1:08:01] you worship in jerusalem
[1:08:03] right because that's what the tapes say
[1:08:05] and i just pointed out brother braham
[1:08:06] said those who live in phoenix live
[1:08:07] closer to god
[1:08:09] so you worship where you want i want to
[1:08:11] live close to god
[1:08:13] i want to live close but those living in
[1:08:15] phoenix live closest to god and i said
[1:08:16] we just say what the tape saying
[1:08:18] he says say what the vision said he says
[1:08:20] now if you're wide awake you'll see
[1:08:23] something
[1:08:25] think about all these things he's saying
[1:08:27] and all these
[1:08:28] things he's pointing to all these
[1:08:29] different elements of rapture and
[1:08:31] judgment and seven thunders and the
[1:08:33] seals being opened
[1:08:34] and god interpreted his word and people
[1:08:36] saying it doesn't mean this it doesn't
[1:08:37] mean that he says it does mean this
[1:08:39] and all these different things happening
[1:08:40] he comes all the way down to say
[1:08:42] these things have been misunderstood
[1:08:43] listen to what i'm preaching to you
[1:08:44] listen to what i'm saying
[1:08:45] and he says it this way if you're wide
[1:08:48] awake you'll see something
[1:08:50] and if you're not wide awake you'll
[1:08:52] imagine a lot
[1:08:55] if you're not wide awake you'll
[1:08:56] interpret a lot of things you'll assume
[1:08:58] a lot of things
[1:08:59] it doesn't mean if you're white not wide
[1:09:00] awake you won't have any theology you
[1:09:02] won't have any doctrines you won't have
[1:09:03] any ideas
[1:09:04] you'll still have a lot of them and a
[1:09:05] lot of convictions and a lot of passion
[1:09:07] they're saying if you really want to see
[1:09:09] something you've got to be wide awake
[1:09:12] now if you're wide awake you'll see
[1:09:14] something he says if you you'll see it
[1:09:15] if you're wide awake so now twice
[1:09:17] within a week of each other in almost
[1:09:20] exactly a week he is making this
[1:09:21] pronouncement
[1:09:22] if you're wide awake he says i hope i
[1:09:24] don't have to hold it in my hand to show
[1:09:26] you
[1:09:27] i don't even know what he was referring
[1:09:28] to there
[1:09:30] i hope i don't have to hold it in my
[1:09:32] hand to show you you mean brother
[1:09:33] branham
[1:09:34] there was enough vindication there was
[1:09:36] enough
[1:09:37] solid evidence there was enough behind
[1:09:40] what you're now
[1:09:41] expressing and beginning to express that
[1:09:42] week to where you felt as if you could
[1:09:44] show them in your hand do i have to hold
[1:09:48] it in my hand to show you it is here
[1:09:53] these very things that people miss these
[1:09:54] very things that people are speculating
[1:09:56] about he said something is upon us
[1:09:58] something
[1:09:58] it's here we're at the end yes there are
[1:10:00] smart will miss it the simple visions
[1:10:03] when they're revealed in such simplicity
[1:10:04] till it just crosses over the top of
[1:10:06] people's head
[1:10:10] goes right over their head and we use
[1:10:12] that to express how someone maybe
[1:10:13] doesn't have a sense of humor or they
[1:10:15] don't
[1:10:15] they don't really pick up on it they
[1:10:16] don't catch it says oh that went over my
[1:10:18] head
[1:10:18] but it could just be this inability to
[1:10:20] catch something
[1:10:22] to recognize something happen they're
[1:10:23] clueless they're oblivious
[1:10:25] they don't know it goes right over their
[1:10:27] heads
[1:10:28] because they're off looking out
[1:10:30] somewhere for something really really
[1:10:31] big
[1:10:32] something really really great he says
[1:10:33] it's happening right underneath you
[1:10:36] happening right in front of you
[1:10:42] if you're wide awake you'll see
[1:10:43] something
[1:10:46] as these thoughts and these these
[1:10:48] inspirations were coming to me and this
[1:10:49] thought of our joy
[1:10:51] being connected with these things these
[1:10:53] very specific things that we referenced
[1:10:55] last time in
[1:10:56] out of nehemiah and this time today
[1:10:59] i felt like there was this paradox and
[1:11:02] that
[1:11:04] well you have to be wide awake to see it
[1:11:07] but then
[1:11:08] how do you how do you wake up and it was
[1:11:10] almost like well what what wakes you up
[1:11:12] is what you want to see and i felt like
[1:11:13] well
[1:11:15] there has to be a way there has to be a
[1:11:17] way that these things
[1:11:18] will kind of click together these gears
[1:11:21] will kind of click together
[1:11:23] to help the people to understand what
[1:11:26] how the these order of things because i
[1:11:28] feel like we're all we're walking in
[1:11:29] this together
[1:11:31] and and there's and there's different
[1:11:32] ones who have been faithful to this
[1:11:34] message much longer than i have
[1:11:35] and have a better understanding of the
[1:11:37] word than i do and and even
[1:11:39] and and certainly gifted men that preach
[1:11:41] it in a more dynamic way in a more
[1:11:43] positive way than i can
[1:11:44] but then i would realize that i would i
[1:11:46] would want to be received and accepted
[1:11:48] as a brother
[1:11:49] who's not way out somewhere you know
[1:11:51] lulled to sleep and in some kind of
[1:11:53] fantasy or some kind of false doctrine
[1:11:55] but to realize that i'm i'm walking in
[1:11:57] steps that they once walked in
[1:11:59] that those who are ahead of me i'm
[1:12:01] looking to them and they're furthering
[1:12:02] the word and i can look back and see
[1:12:04] others who are coming along and we
[1:12:05] realize
[1:12:06] we're kind of all in this together and
[1:12:08] if there's somebody who's wide awake
[1:12:10] because they're wide awake they're
[1:12:11] seeing something
[1:12:12] but i'm just waking up so maybe i'm
[1:12:14] seeing something a little bit different
[1:12:16] and there's others that still need to be
[1:12:17] woke up yet but if we could all kind of
[1:12:19] be in harmony
[1:12:20] of what it takes to wake us up and what
[1:12:22] we need to see when we wake up
[1:12:24] we can stay in harmony know that
[1:12:26] something is happening
[1:12:30] and so in the third seal brother bram's
[1:12:31] talking about how the denominations take
[1:12:33] their revival and they've had their
[1:12:34] revival but they're dead he's talking
[1:12:36] about the church being that he's even
[1:12:37] talking about
[1:12:38] the church as it relates to god's
[1:12:39] product his work product the church he's
[1:12:41] raised up to the ages
[1:12:42] that in the lail to see in church age
[1:12:44] she's dead
[1:12:46] spiritually dead he says now that's the
[1:12:49] reason today that the revivals that
[1:12:50] we're supposed to have
[1:12:52] we have denominational revivals we
[1:12:54] haven't had a real stirring
[1:12:56] no no no no no sir
[1:13:00] it's five in there don't think we got
[1:13:02] revivals we haven't
[1:13:05] brother brahma is even going so far as
[1:13:06] to say that the things that have
[1:13:08] transpired in the things that have
[1:13:09] happened
[1:13:10] has not been in the in his ministry even
[1:13:12] since 1933 the things that have been
[1:13:14] taking place in his ministry
[1:13:16] is not the revival that he's talking
[1:13:17] about
[1:13:19] he says oh they've got millions and
[1:13:21] millions and millions of church members
[1:13:22] but no revival
[1:13:23] nowhere no no so now we have six seven
[1:13:28] no revivals the bride hasn't had
[1:13:31] a revival yet all right i am
[1:13:34] only saying what he said on march 20th
[1:13:38] 1963. okay i'm not using that present
[1:13:41] tense today to say the bride
[1:13:43] hasn't had her revival yet because
[1:13:45] there's bride here that would just say
[1:13:46] would say brother aaron and you're
[1:13:47] missing it then
[1:13:49] amen bride if i tried to use this quote
[1:13:51] today to say the bride hasn't had her
[1:13:53] revival
[1:13:53] i would accept the i would expect the
[1:13:55] bride to meet me outside and say brother
[1:13:57] aaron i'm sorry but i'm taking mine now
[1:14:00] because that's the reality of it he said
[1:14:03] in this moment here the bride hasn't had
[1:14:04] a revival yet
[1:14:05] there's been no revival there no
[1:14:08] manifestation of god disturb
[1:14:11] the bride denominational revivals won't
[1:14:14] stir her
[1:14:15] weekend revivals don't stir her church
[1:14:18] camps and church moves don't
[1:14:19] don't stir her don't revive her it takes
[1:14:22] a manifestation of god
[1:14:24] to stir the bride she can come to a
[1:14:27] place of restoration where she looks
[1:14:29] like an
[1:14:29] army but there's gotta come a move of
[1:14:32] god
[1:14:32] that induce her with power and she rises
[1:14:35] onto her feet
[1:14:36] as an invincible army it takes a
[1:14:38] manifestation of god
[1:14:40] it takes the fourth life messenger it
[1:14:42] takes the revealing of jesus christ
[1:14:44] to stir the bride and to wake her up he
[1:14:48] says it in those very words we're
[1:14:49] looking for it it will take those seven
[1:14:52] unknown thunders back there to wake her
[1:14:55] up again
[1:14:56] he will send it he promised it this is
[1:14:59] brother aaron now said
[1:15:01] amen he sent it this day this scripture
[1:15:04] is fulfilled
[1:15:05] the bride's revival is here
[1:15:09] why because he continues to preach that
[1:15:10] week we know that it was the
[1:15:12] manifestation of god
[1:15:13] it was the loosen of those seven seals
[1:15:15] it was the revealing of those seven
[1:15:17] unknown thunders
[1:15:19] and that's the bride's revival and he
[1:15:22] says
[1:15:22] that's what wakes her up so there's no
[1:15:26] other means to wake you up
[1:15:27] i think this is the part to me where
[1:15:29] it's not necessarily circular reasoning
[1:15:31] it's just the reality
[1:15:32] if you're slumbering and you're sleepy
[1:15:34] and you're and you're over
[1:15:36] charged and you're groggy you'll miss
[1:15:39] what god's doing today
[1:15:42] and the only thing that's going to wake
[1:15:44] you up
[1:15:45] to see what god is doing is what god is
[1:15:50] doing
[1:15:52] you can't go to the doctor and get a
[1:15:53] prescription for this
[1:15:55] you can't go into the world and find the
[1:15:57] answer for this
[1:15:59] the only thing that can wake you up the
[1:16:01] only thing that can relieve you of the
[1:16:02] spiritual amnesia the only thing that
[1:16:04] can give you
[1:16:04] it puts you in this position to begin to
[1:16:07] see something he says if you're wide
[1:16:08] awake you'll see something the only
[1:16:10] thing that can wake you up
[1:16:11] is the manifestation of god through the
[1:16:13] open of the word
[1:16:15] that's what has to stir you and wake you
[1:16:17] up so then if you're listening to this
[1:16:18] if we are
[1:16:19] now in the the gethsemane time if we're
[1:16:22] at the very nearing the end
[1:16:23] of our journey in this message and we're
[1:16:25] coming to this climax of a rapture and a
[1:16:27] body change
[1:16:28] then the word is to wake up to watch
[1:16:30] therefore to tarry to be mindful
[1:16:33] to be alert to to recognize your day and
[1:16:35] its message and if you find yourself
[1:16:37] well
[1:16:37] i i feel like i believe and i feel like
[1:16:40] this but i've got this
[1:16:41] spiritual lethargy and i'm being lulled
[1:16:43] to sleep then you have to say wait a
[1:16:44] minute
[1:16:45] oh god i've got to run back to the word
[1:16:48] i've got to come to christ
[1:16:50] i've got to feed on his principles i've
[1:16:52] got to seek his face i said god forgive
[1:16:54] me of my sins
[1:16:55] forgive me my laziness lord i feel that
[1:16:57] i'm being overcharged i feel like i'm
[1:16:59] becoming drunk
[1:17:01] oh god let your word wake me up and get
[1:17:04] back into this word of god
[1:17:06] you should be taking time praying
[1:17:08] reading listening
[1:17:09] oh desiring it because it'll be that
[1:17:11] word that wakes you up and then i just
[1:17:13] shouldn't see a revival saying
[1:17:15] oh my goodness i've been in this message
[1:17:17] for 33 years
[1:17:19] and i've never seen this
[1:17:22] oh my goodness i've been preaching this
[1:17:24] for years i've been living this for
[1:17:25] years
[1:17:26] i've loved this for years but now i feel
[1:17:28] like i'm more awake than i've ever been
[1:17:30] can i get an amen anybody live that way
[1:17:33] anybody find that this is true to this
[1:17:35] that we can be woke up to see
[1:17:37] more that god is doing
[1:17:41] because once these seven thunders make
[1:17:42] you wide awake
[1:17:44] you'll start seeing something once you
[1:17:47] catch that what happened and
[1:17:49] when brother man preached the seven
[1:17:50] seals brother brown just didn't get up
[1:17:52] there
[1:17:53] preach the seven seals and say now all
[1:17:55] right i preached it
[1:17:56] don't be mysterious don't interpret
[1:17:58] these things if you can just forget i
[1:18:00] even preached it
[1:18:01] and let's just go be simple christians
[1:18:03] and move on and that's what we want to
[1:18:05] do is we just
[1:18:05] kind of want to forget that week
[1:18:09] you're still asleep if you can have the
[1:18:12] conviction and the attitude that god
[1:18:14] sent a prophet
[1:18:15] and that what he said mattered right
[1:18:20] and and you say well what year did he
[1:18:22] preach it
[1:18:23] in the years that he was a prophet
[1:18:27] and what he preached mattered and that
[1:18:29] he said things that were really strange
[1:18:30] and mysterious causes people to stumble
[1:18:32] some to walk away some to ponder on it
[1:18:35] but you start realizing that god sent it
[1:18:37] for a purpose and he sent it for a
[1:18:38] reason
[1:18:39] and it wasn't so that men could build
[1:18:40] kingdoms and abuse people
[1:18:42] he didn't do it so men could get rich
[1:18:44] and so people could have authority and
[1:18:45] people could bind people to
[1:18:47] he sent a message of grace to his bride
[1:18:50] to the church to christians and you are
[1:18:53] those who've received it
[1:18:54] and you should receive it as your own
[1:18:56] and you should take it and begin to
[1:18:58] examine it in its purity
[1:19:00] without interpretation without men's
[1:19:02] ideas with not without the memories of
[1:19:04] what it was and what it had become
[1:19:05] when you were raised in it but begin to
[1:19:07] look at it as lord this is truth
[1:19:10] and i know it's truth and i want to
[1:19:12] receive it in the spirit that it was
[1:19:13] given
[1:19:15] i share that because a brother shared
[1:19:16] with me he recently just dropped in my
[1:19:18] heart to say it
[1:19:19] he was raised in this message believed
[1:19:21] it fervently and adamantly
[1:19:24] and even to the point where every single
[1:19:26] word was thus saith the lord and
[1:19:27] everything was perfect and he got really
[1:19:29] really challenged in the core of it one
[1:19:31] time
[1:19:31] and he said he convinced him he knew he
[1:19:33] was brought to a place of decision with
[1:19:35] god
[1:19:35] and he said i know i know i believe it
[1:19:39] but i haven't received it in the spirit
[1:19:40] that it was given
[1:19:42] and he went back and started all over
[1:19:44] and says this time i want to receive it
[1:19:46] in the spirit that it was given
[1:19:48] and you'll find that it's not the spirit
[1:19:49] of william branham that you catch when
[1:19:51] you do that
[1:19:56] it's christ
[1:20:00] once this word wakes you up that's when
[1:20:02] you can start to see things
[1:20:05] and that'll be your joy you wanna know
[1:20:08] where your pure joy is if you were
[1:20:10] hoping to get some couch time with
[1:20:11] brother aaron and sister elizabeth in
[1:20:13] other words
[1:20:14] you could lay down on the couch and we
[1:20:15] could be your psychiatrist
[1:20:17] and we can help you find your joy that's
[1:20:20] not where you'll find it
[1:20:22] we'll make ourselves available maybe to
[1:20:24] some degree allow you to take advantage
[1:20:26] of us
[1:20:27] in taking our time to counsel you even
[1:20:29] we spend hours counseling people that
[1:20:30] don't even
[1:20:31] aren't even a part of our church because
[1:20:33] they hear there's an opportunity there's
[1:20:34] someone available there's
[1:20:35] there's a heart open to hear and to help
[1:20:37] we're willing to do it i'll be glad i'll
[1:20:39] be glad to spend
[1:20:40] and be spent for you but at the end of
[1:20:42] the day i know
[1:20:44] that for the elect this word is their
[1:20:46] joy
[1:20:48] this is where you'll find it maybe maybe
[1:20:51] maybe god knows this would be where
[1:20:53] we'll end this thought but there's still
[1:20:54] more that brother ram talks about waking
[1:20:56] up
[1:20:57] and i think that's maybe all we need to
[1:20:59] do is just wake up a little bit more
[1:21:02] let's stand
[1:21:06] maybe christ can still give a gentle
[1:21:07] rebuke today
[1:21:09] and say your spirit is willing
[1:21:13] but the flesh is weak we say lord just
[1:21:16] strengthen my hands for war
[1:21:19] i want to be that overcomer lord
[1:21:23] help me lord
[1:21:46] we could just bow our heads i'd like to
[1:21:49] pray with you
[1:21:57] if you need a touch from the lord today
[1:21:59] i believe that you can receive it
[1:22:01] right where you stand i realize for
[1:22:04] others that they desire
[1:22:06] they need in in no disrespect no lack of
[1:22:10] faith they need
[1:22:11] another point of contact and we want you
[1:22:12] to know that there's you're always
[1:22:14] welcome to come forward for prayer
[1:22:16] if you need prayer but i do believe
[1:22:19] today that he has spoken
[1:22:20] very particularly to you and your needs
[1:22:22] and your situation
[1:22:24] and maybe you've grown cold and you've
[1:22:26] grown numb and you've grown calloused
[1:22:28] and
[1:22:29] your heart has become hardened towards
[1:22:30] certain things
[1:22:33] and the preaching of the word
[1:22:37] it's almost as if it's doing these chest
[1:22:39] compressions
[1:22:41] it's bringing you back you have enough
[1:22:43] consciousness today to say lord touch
[1:22:46] me help me lord today
[1:22:47] [Music]
[1:22:49] help me father wake me up lord
[1:22:54] if i'm asleep lord wake me up
[1:22:57] lord if it takes a revelation of your
[1:22:59] word to give me my stirring and i
[1:23:00] haven't had it lord stir me
[1:23:03] lead me to it just as that woman at the
[1:23:06] well
[1:23:07] would have never known that day when she
[1:23:09] showed up
[1:23:10] that there'd be a man there and tell him
[1:23:13] who she was
[1:23:14] tell her who she was not just who he was
[1:23:18] maybe today you could sense this
[1:23:22] moment that you can receive
[1:23:27] i pray lord that you'd grant us
[1:23:28] something special today now
[1:23:31] our heads bowed we need something in
[1:23:34] prayer maybe you just lift your hands
[1:23:35] before the lord
[1:23:38] lift your hands to him now our gracious
[1:23:42] heavenly father
[1:23:44] we lift hands and surrender to you
[1:23:48] lord we're desirous to be wide awake
[1:23:51] christians
[1:23:53] we desire as the word teaches us to be
[1:23:55] sane and sensible
[1:23:57] we understand lord that to the world
[1:23:59] will be considered fanatics
[1:24:01] even as the definition is a fanatic is
[1:24:03] someone that loves jesus more than you
[1:24:06] so we realized that yes to the world
[1:24:07] we're crazy and we're fanatical
[1:24:09] and we're irrational but lord
[1:24:13] we cannot induce some sort of emotional
[1:24:15] frenzy and some irrational
[1:24:17] exuberance and just be some sort of
[1:24:20] wildfire that's not connected with
[1:24:22] revelation and not connected with the
[1:24:24] fulfilling of your word
[1:24:25] and then feel as if we're because we're
[1:24:27] message cell it's because we're zealous
[1:24:29] for
[1:24:30] brother branham and we're zealous for
[1:24:31] the tapes and zealots for the books that
[1:24:33] were
[1:24:34] that were right lord we must be sensible
[1:24:37] according to your word we must be sane
[1:24:39] we must be sober we
[1:24:40] must be in our right minds so lord i
[1:24:43] pray today that you would help us
[1:24:46] to recover from any inappropriate
[1:24:48] intoxication
[1:24:50] recover from any carnal stimulation and
[1:24:52] lord
[1:24:53] sober our spirits up and wake us up
[1:24:56] lord that being wide awake we can now be
[1:24:59] stimulated
[1:25:00] with the stimulation of revelation that
[1:25:02] there be no
[1:25:03] improper stimulants mixed in between but
[1:25:06] it would be pure
[1:25:07] it would be clean it would be sober it
[1:25:09] would be serious
[1:25:10] yet full of the joy of the lord
[1:25:13] and i pray for those with broken hearts
[1:25:15] that you would heal them
[1:25:17] lord for people in situations that are
[1:25:18] complicated may you bring a resolution
[1:25:21] to the paradox
[1:25:22] lord may you even breathe bring this
[1:25:24] understanding that
[1:25:26] if we repent and ask forgiveness of our
[1:25:28] sins we can still find grace in your
[1:25:30] sight
[1:25:31] and you can allow us to navigate
[1:25:33] difficult situations
[1:25:34] and find a peace in the midst of the
[1:25:37] storm and find a perfection in the midst
[1:25:39] of broken
[1:25:40] pieces so i pray lord today right now
[1:25:43] that you would heal that you would mend
[1:25:44] that you would lead that you had guide
[1:25:46] that you would bring a total deliverance
[1:25:48] and a peace
[1:25:50] lord as i pray now before you
[1:25:53] sister karen pruitt comes upon my heart
[1:25:56] lord i pray that you would completely
[1:25:58] mend and restore a total restoration to
[1:26:01] remove
[1:26:02] this bleeding and this pressure resolve
[1:26:05] whatever this may be
[1:26:06] and may this last one be the last time
[1:26:09] that she
[1:26:10] suffers from this malady and may she be
[1:26:12] brought back to good health
[1:26:15] now today lord may she be made well
[1:26:17] we're asking for it lord
[1:26:19] and i pray for your mercy and grace upon
[1:26:21] your people
[1:26:22] and may we receive you now by faith in
[1:26:25] the name of the lord jesus christ
